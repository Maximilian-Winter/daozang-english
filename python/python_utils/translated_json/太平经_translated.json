  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of Great Peace**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of Great Peace*. According to the *Book of Later Han: Biography of Xiang Kai*, during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Eastern Han, Gong Chong of Langye presented at court a divine book obtained by his master, Yu Ji, at Quyang’s Spring of the Curved Waters. This book was titled *The Scripture of Great Peace and Pure Governance*. The divine book is none other than *The Scripture of Great Peace*, a foundational scripture of early Daoism in the Han dynasty. From the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Tang, the transmitted version of *The Scripture of Great Peace* comprised one hundred and seventy scrolls, divided into ten sections: Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Gui. Today, only fifty-seven scrolls remain. The base text is from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Great Peace Section.\n\n**Scroll Thirty-Five of The Scripture of Great Peace: The Method for Distinguishing Wealth and Poverty (Forty-First)**\n\nThe Perfected One approached. You have come repeatedly to study the Dao—have you truly mastered it, or is there still more?\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master no longer expounds for you, assuming you have already attained sufficiency. Yet upon hearing the Heavenly Master’s words again, you realize there is still more to learn.\n\nMy thoughts are now exhausted, and I know not what further questions to ask. I only beseech the Heavenly Master to enlighten me on what I have yet to grasp.\n\nCome, Perfected One.\n\nWhat is called wealth and what is called poverty in the world?\n\nIndeed, those who possess much are wealthy, and those who possess little are poor.\n\nYet while your words are correct, they are also not entirely so.\n\nHow so?\n\nIf one possesses much that is false, deceptive, flattering, or stolen, can this truly be called wealth? If the common people are many and the ruler few, can this be called poverty?\n\nFoolish and ignorant as I am, I dare not refrain from speaking upon seeing the Heavenly Master’s teachings, though I fear my words may fall short or err.\n\nYou yourself admit your inadequacy—how then could the vulgar know the true nature of wealth and poverty?\n\nNow, by the Heavenly Master’s command, your disciple, in ignorance, is like an infant who must be taught by father and mother before gaining understanding.\n\nExcellent! Your words are most humble, yet not without merit.\n\nVery well. Perfected One, attend closely, for I shall explain fully.\n\nWealth signifies complete and perfect sufficiency. Heaven deems all things fully produced as wealth and sufficiency.\n\nThus, in the era of the Supreme Sovereign, the qi emerged, and the twelve thousand things were all brought forth—this is called wealth and sufficiency. In the era of the Middle Sovereign, things were slightly diminished, unable to fully produce the twelve thousand things, hence it was called minor poverty. In the era of the Lower Sovereign, things were further diminished from the Middle Sovereign, hence it was called great poverty. Without auspicious responses and the arising of good things, it is called extreme poverty.\n\nWould you know its great effect? Compare it to a farming household: lacking rare treasures or precious goods, it is a poor household. Unable to produce the ten thousand things in full, it is an extremely poor household—this is the poverty of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the twelve thousand things all emerge and the earth nourishes them without harm, it is the wealth of the earth. If it fails to nourish them well, causing minor harm, it is the earth’s minor poverty. If great harm is done, it is the earth’s great poverty. If good things fear harm from the earth’s form and do not arise, it is the earth’s extreme poverty. Lacking treasures and precious goods, with half the ten thousand things harmed, it is the great cause of poverty. If all are harmed, it is an empty and destitute household.\n\nThis is to take Heaven as father and Earth as mother. If these parents are extremely poor, then their children will grieve in poverty. This corresponds to the governance of kings.\n\nThus, the sagely kings of antiquity were able to bring forth the twelve thousand things—these were the supremely wealthy rulers. If good things were lacking by two-thirds, they were rulers of middling wealth. If lacking by one-third, they were rulers of lesser wealth. Without rare and excellent things, they were rulers of extreme poverty. With half the ten thousand things harmed, they were a declining house. If all were harmed, they were the most impoverished of people.\n\nThe sagely and worthy of old dwelled deep in seclusion, reflecting on the Dao and virtue. What need had they to inquire about wealth and poverty? They knew it all while seated.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in compassion for the long-suffering emperors and kings who cannot realize their aspirations, by what means can they attain this wealth or poverty?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your question is most profound, delving into subtle and essential matters.\n\nIndeed, it is the success or failure of one’s conduct that brings these about.\n\nThose who exert themselves in the true Dao receive the aid of Heaven’s spirits in their transformation. Thus, fertile spirits and good things are fully provided. Those who practice virtue receive the nourishment of Earth’s yang, forests, and springs to assist their governance, hence they are half-wealthy. Those who practice benevolence receive the aid of the harmonious and benevolent spirits, hence they are slightly wealthy. Those who practice civil arts open the path to deception, hence deceitful spirits aid them, and their governance is slightly disordered. Those who practice martial arts receive the aid of thieving spirits, hence their governance runs counter to Heaven’s will and harms the good.\n\nThe Dao is what Heaven follows in its conduct. Heaven is most numinous, hence true spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Earth is nourishing, hence virtuous spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Humanity is benevolent, hence benevolent spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Civil arts govern through literary deception, losing their root, hence deceitful spirits emerge to aid them. When superiors and inferiors engage in literary embellishment, their affairs become disordered.\n\nMartial arts subdue people through punishment, killing, and harm, just as thieves subdue people through punishment, killing, and harm. Those who subdue people through anger, joy, ferocity, and might are thieves. Thus, when thieves abound, governance is inauspicious. Thieves often harm through wealth and goods, hence such governance loses its grasp on material resources.\n\nThus, the supreme rulers of old subdued people through the Dao, greatly winning Heaven’s favor. Their governance was like that of spirits, and they knew no sorrow, for they subdued people through the true Dao. Middling rulers subdued people through virtue, lesser rulers through benevolence, disordered rulers through civil arts, and doomed rulers through punishment, killing, and harm.\n\nTherefore, the supreme rulers of old subdued people through the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, not through civil arts, punishment, killing, or harm. The reason for this is that such methods are base and vulgar. The noble ruler resembles Heaven and Earth, hence Heaven loves life and does no harm—thus is he called ruler and father.\n\nThe Earth nurtures all things with care, hence it is called the good minister and mother. People ought to employ a heart of benevolence, loving and fostering as Heaven and Earth do, thus are they called *ren*. These three are good, and so together they govern the myriad things, serving as their teachers and elders.\n\nThose who rely on deceit and punishment cannot govern; daily they bring about misfortune, and cannot bring emperors and kings to Great Peace. Thus, such methods must be severed.\n\nNow, the Perfected One entrusts this scripture to a ruler of virtue and power, that through diligent practice its effects may manifest, aligning with Heaven to achieve Great Peace. This may rightly be called a \"house of abundance\" without doubt, sparing emperors and kings from sorrow and distress, and avoiding the name of a \"house of poverty.\"\n\nNowadays, people commonly speak of a \"house of abundance\"—what does this mean? Such talk is but the reckless chatter of the vulgar. \"Abundance\" signifies complete sufficiency. If even one thing is lacking, it is not truly sufficient.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of old did not demand perfection from any single person, for they knew none could be fully equipped, and so did not impose such expectations. Now, among the eighty-one domains and states, each lacks some things and cannot always be self-sufficient, hence they take from other lands.\n\nWhat true abundance can a single household possess? Perfected One, do you truly wish to follow the vulgar in their reckless speech? I dare not, I dare not. You have studied the importance of cautious speech—do not indulge in idle talk. Idle talk disrupts the proper pattern of Heaven and Earth and cannot serve as a model for people. Be cautious.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in kindness and compassion, pities the emperor on his throne, whose heart is burdened with sorrow and distress, failing to align with Heaven’s intent. Thus, he fully expounds the way to open the path to the Great Peace of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nThis humble student has received many scriptures, yet remains greatly bewildered, like an unlearned child. I know not what further questions to ask. May the Illustrious Heavenly Master fully set forth all the admonitions.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven follows the yang number as one, and the yin number as two—hence yang is odd, yin is even. Therefore, the ruler is few while ministers are many. Yang is noble, yin is base; thus, two yin must together serve one yang. The number of Heaven is one, the number of Earth is two; therefore, two women should serve one man—why must two share the burden of supporting one?\n\nThe side of the noble must not be left vacant. When one acts, another should stand by to attend to what is lacking. Thus, one symbolizes Heaven, two symbolizes Earth, and humanity is the child of Heaven and Earth—therefore, it must emulate its parents.\n\nSince the world lost the Dao, it has scorned and wantonly slaughtered girls, causing women to be fewer than men. Thus, yin qi is severed, no longer aligning with the pattern of Heaven and Earth. The Dao of Heaven decrees that a solitary yang cannot thrive alone, causing Heaven to withhold timely rain. Women correspond to Earth, yet they are universally despised. The world collectively scorns its true mother, murdering and harming Earth’s qi, severing its vitality so that it ceases to produce. Earth grows enraged and displeased, multiplying disasters, preventing the king’s governance from achieving peace.\n\nWhy is this so? Men embody the spirit of Heaven, women the spirit of Earth. Things of the same kind influence one another—if governance is not at peace, the fault does not lie with the king alone. Rather, the common people, having lost the Dao, treat matters lightly and commit wrongs together. Their transgressions are not singular but manifold, making governance difficult to stabilize and leading to disorder.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth encompasses twelve thousand things, yet human life is the most precious. This slaughter of girls deeply disrupts the king’s governance—here lies the greatest calamity.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master opens the path to Great Peace for the king. The true scripture of Great Peace has emerged, allowing the king to wander without care. Yet this harm to girls brings great disaster—what is to be done?\n\nExcellent is your question! You have grasped the heart of Heaven.\n\nThe reason the world despises and reviles women lies in their conduct—where does this fault originate?\n\nI wish to hear it, to record it on bamboo and silk, so that for ten thousand generations it may never be abandoned.\n\nExcellent! If you now record this, the world will no longer kill girls.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI wish to record it to eliminate the king’s disasters—this brings me joy, to save the lives of wronged girls.\n\nExcellent! You have gained the favor of Heaven’s reckoning.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTo save a life is to save oneself; to kill a life is to kill oneself. Heaven cherishes its children—by acting thus, you lengthen your allotted span in Heaven, and the Controller of Destinies alters your register.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nThere is no further refusal—this is the natural law of Heaven.\n\nThe reason the world kills girls is that when people are young, parents fret and struggle, denying them clothing and food while raising them. This is not unique to humans—even creatures that crawl do the same. When they grow old, large or small, each must seek clothing and food according to their strength. Thus, all things eventually leave their parents to provide for themselves. The worthy find joy, the unworthy find suffering.\n\nMoreover, children are young, their strength daily increasing and abundant. Parents grow old, their strength daily waning and insufficient. Whether son or daughter, the wise and strong should repay their parents’ kindness and nurture them. Thus, parents should not be responsible for their children’s clothing and food.\n\nThis is called the weak supporting the strong, the insufficient sustaining the abundant—it is a perverse governance. The young burden the old, offering no benefit to their parents, so parents often kill them. If they kill them for lack of clothing and food, how is that better than letting them live and provide for themselves?\n\nMaster, this truly severs Earth’s lineage—how profoundly foolish the people are!\n\nNow, hearing this, my heart grieves and trembles with fear. I know the wronged are many—what is to be done?\n\nThose who study but lack clothing and food will slacken in their learning, and the Dao will halt. But if they obtain clothing and food, the worthy will study without ceasing. Each should have their own benefit, not be made to return and burden one another.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nWomen have no official positions. A woman joining her husband is like a man taking office—she should obtain clothing and food. When a woman joins her husband’s household, they should unite their strength, work together to sustain life, and jointly transmit the lineage of Heaven and Earth. Until death, their bones and flesh remain together, and they should combine their efforts to secure clothing and food. Thus, the worthy will be joyful, the unworthy will suffer.\n\nIt is like the land: fertile soil yields good crops, and Heaven bestows its favor upon it. Poor soil yields bad crops, and Heaven bestows its favor accordingly, never seizing what grows by its own strength. If Heaven does not seize your labor, how much less should people?\n\nThus, no one will kill their daughters.\n\nExcellent, excellent! A great and deep harm is removed—Great Peace for the emperor is at hand!\n\nMaster, how do you know this?\n\nParents and children share the deepest bond in the world—they must not be distressed or impoverished, nor should they be killed. A mother who kills her child aligns with the qi of bandits and rebels—this is the height of rebellion and the absence of the Dao. Thus, it most deeply disrupts the king’s governance.\n\nIf girls are allowed to live and not murdered or harmed, great joy will arrive.\n\nIndeed, your words are correct. You may be said to understand.\n\nNow, if every household in the world kills one girl, how many households are there in the world? Some families even kill ten or more girls. Some injure them before they are born, cutting them down in the womb. Their grievance and resentment rise to Heaven—how can this be without reason?\n\nThus, I earnestly and repeatedly affirm this truth.\n\nWhen each person relies on their own labor for clothing and food, women will have no divided hearts, their minds will be single, and their work will no longer be hesitant or doubtful. But if they toil without reward, their spirits will remain discordant—this is the natural principle of Heaven’s nature.\n\nMaster, guard this well. Do not discard this text, but entrust it to a benevolent and worthy ruler, that one great grievance and disaster may be removed. Heed my words and show them to all people, so that none will willingly cast away their daughters. Then, one man will have two women, and this will accord with the laws of Heaven and Earth.\n\nFor Heaven’s laws decree: the yang number is odd, the yin number is even. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, people have lost the intent of the Dao of Heaven, wantonly killing girls, causing men to outnumber women and leaving them insufficient. This greatly violates the Dao of Heaven, perpetuating a cycle of mutual burden as common custom. Later generations will suffer the world’s worst calamities—how grievous and devoid of the Dao!\n\nMen inherit the Heavenly lineage, women the Earthly lineage. Now, by severing the Earthly lineage and preventing its transmission, many will be cut off without descendants. How grave their sin!\n\nAll things should mutually generate and transmit their kind, yet now the Earthly lineage is broken, and humanity’s kind is extinguished. Thus, Heaven will eventually sever their posterity.\n\nMoreover, all people are born bearing Heaven’s qi in full: the head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth; the four limbs correspond to the four seasons; the five viscera to the five phases; the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose to the seven luminaries and three lights. These correspondences are beyond enumeration—only the sage fully understands them.\n\nAll people possess both yin and yang. When the sun and moon are full, the womb opens, and they emerge to gaze upon Heaven and Earth, to grow, and to transmit their ancestors’ lineage, assisting Heaven in generating beings and Earth in nurturing forms. Now, Heaven and Earth’s spirits trust this family, and the spiritual lineage of Heaven and Earth comes to dwell within this person. Yet people harm them, and Heaven greatly blames them. Since people do not restrain one another, Heaven has sent forth this text to show to later generations.\n\nIf, after this matter has been revealed, one still persists in the old ways, this is willful violation of Heaven’s law. Their sin will be doubled, and their lineage will be extinguished without doubt.\n\nMaster, guard this well. Exert yourself, exert yourself!\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow that you have revealed this matter, if you flee and hide this text, you will bear the punishment on behalf of others.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nGo forth, and each of you consider your own fate.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHerein is distinguished the conduct of the poor, the rich, and the sovereign—how to establish fortune and forbid the severing of Earth’s lineage, thereby restoring balance between men and women and rectifying royal governance.\n\n**Method of One Man and Two Women, Forty-Second**\n\nThe Perfected One approaches.\nNow, the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, and the king’s governance nears perfect harmony. Should people uphold chastity or not? How ought one uphold it?\nChastity means moderating desires and refraining from reckless conduct.\nAlas! The Perfected One’s words reveal the errors of common folk since the purest antiquity. Their teachers, consumed by inner jealousy, instead instruct the people in recklessness.\nThe Perfected One asks: What do you mean?\nA chaste man does not emit, and a chaste woman does not transform. When yin and yang do not unite, their line is cut off, leaving no descendants. Two people together sever the lineage of Heaven and Earth, coveting a hollow, false reputation while forfeiting posterity and losing the true kernel. This is the greatest harm under Heaven.\nHad your parents not transmitted life to you, how would you exist? Yet you sever it—this is what Heaven and Earth jointly detest, a person who defies principle and commits great treason. The consequence is that Heaven and Earth become estranged: Heaven refuses to send rain, and Earth refuses to bring forth life. Why? When Heaven does not rain, it is because the chaste do not emit. When Earth does not generate the myriad things, it is because the chaste do not transform. If Heaven does not rain and Earth produces nothing, this is the gravest misfortune under Heaven. How can this be called good?\nConsider the Perfected One’s words: they defy the teachings of Heaven and Earth, reverse the Dao of Heaven, and take no joy in aiding Heaven and Earth’s generation and transformation—instead, they seek to sever it. Do your spoken words not weigh upon the August Heaven and Revered Earth? Even the strong may falter, and those with faults may err. Having heard the Celestial Master’s discourse, do you not recognize the gravity of your transgression?\nI speak to you: no matter should contravene the Dao of Heaven. To follow the words of common folk and defy the will of Heaven—this is why yin and yang are so often estranged, for it stems from disharmony between men and women. Men and women are the root of yin and yang. If governance loses its root, how can it be auspicious?\nNow, Celestial Master, what should be done?\nAs the qi of Great Peace from the Supreme Heaven above draws near, one must purely follow Heaven’s law. Thus, let one man take two women, to emulate yin and yang: yang is odd in number, yin is even. This is the arrival of the qi of Great Harmony.\nIf there are too many women, yin qi flourishes; if too many men, yang qi lacks balance and method, also inviting misfortune. Why? The number of people must correspond with Heaven and Earth. If they do not correspond, their strength falls short, and calamity ensues.\nThe imperial harem corresponds to the land—what does this signify? What the Perfected One has spoken aligns with my words. Women are the spirits of the land, while the king is the spirit of Heaven. The ruler fears that the land may not receive the spirit of yang, causing the king’s qi to fail to harmonize. If the land does not transform and generate, each province must offer one woman to circulate its qi. Delighting in their transformation and generation, the ruler fears that his grace may not extend fully, that his governance may not be complete, and thus takes them in accordance with the land. When grace is universally bestowed, Heaven’s qi flows freely, timely rain falls, and Earth brings forth the myriad things.\nWhen the qi of Great Peace arrives, one must not esteem the chaste. Excessive inner solitude is a profound transgression, causing the king’s governance to lose harmony. Even common people must not exceed proper measure—hence the method of one man and two women.\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nHerein lies the method of aligning with Heaven and Earth’s law, harmonizing yin and yang, ensuring men and women bear no grievances, bringing timely rain, enabling Earth to transform and generate, and achieving peaceful royal governance.\n\n**Method of Promoting Good and Suppressing Evil, Forty-Third**\n\nThe Perfected One approaches.\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace descends, we wish to ensure that the cautious and good daily flourish, while the evil daily recede. Yet there are those who injure and kill, and bandits arise. How should governance address this?\nWhat do you mean? I refer to the immediate resolution of known outbreaks.\nIf the sovereign, seated in doubt, wishes to greatly promote the good and swiftly suppress the evil, and bandits arise, how should they be promptly apprehended? How ought governance proceed?\nPerfected One, you should take careful note. Today, the Celestial Master commands me—how dare I not speak? Yet if my words do not accord with the Celestial Master’s law, why be modest in speaking?\nSince ancient times, great sages have not demanded perfection from any single person. If your words today miss the mark, why be modest?\nYes, yes.\nOne must only reward the good and punish the evil, making the distinctions clear and unequivocal. Then the good will daily flourish, and the evil will daily recede.\nYour words are correct. But do the rewards and punishments lack specific designations?\nI dare not speak further without diligent effort and a single word of instruction.\nNow, may the Celestial Master fully elucidate it.\nVery well. You must remember this, and I shall explain it to you in detail.\nWhen the magistrate arrives at the site of an outbreak, he must summon all the people of the district. Former high ministers and officials shall sit facing east; those learned in the classics and the Dao shall sit facing north; the filial and fraternal shall sit facing west; diligent farmers and cautious youths shall sit in the southeast corner, facing northwest; wicked youths shall sit in the southwest corner, facing northeast; and the sovereign shall sit facing south.\nWhy must they sit precisely thus?\nEach follows their kind—this is the Dao of Heaven, guiding people to establish goodness. How are bandits easily apprehended?\nFormer high ministers and officials are placed in the position of loyalty, for these people, though no longer in office, delight in aiding with righteousness. Those learned in the classics and the Dao are placed in the position of clarity, to illuminate their teachings and assist in scrutinizing evil. The filial and fraternal are placed in their native villages, for the utmost filial piety resides in the heart—thus they return to their hometowns. The filial and fraternal are to remain constantly reverent, as if attending court. Things are born in the east, delighting in daily progress. Diligent farmers and cautious youths are placed in the southeast corner, the direction of growth and nurturance, to delight in cultivating the myriad things without negligence.\n\nVicious youths and young men are placed in the southwest, for the southwest is the region where yang wanes and yin arises—a place where malice seeks cunning, and the manipulation of punishments and crimes begins. Thus, monkeys and apes, creatures of dexterous deceit, are assigned to this declining quarter. Those facing east, west, and north all dwell in the front, while the careless and the wicked are stationed behind. Those with wine are granted a vessel each; those without are bestowed with kind words, so that all may assist one another in attaining wisdom.\n\nThe ruler sits in seclusion, enclosed within the chamber. One by one, he summons this assembly, instructing them in order of rank, each to speak once and record the name of their overseer. What they say and what they record must later correspond; those whose words do not align shall be held accountable. Those whose words fail to correspond are great flatterers and deceivers—thus shall the abode of flatterers and deceivers be known. Those whose words align shall, in time, be rewarded with advancement. Yet they are not promoted immediately—why? To avoid fostering resentment. For a lord or father who provokes the resentment of his ministers or children is no benevolent father or worthy ruler.\n\nOnce all is concluded, the good people are sent away. The vicious youths and young men, along with the officers, are dispatched to pursue and capture; those who fail to apprehend the bandits may not rest. The Perfected One employs this text, entrusting it to a ruler of supreme virtue, to show to all people, that each may know this teaching. Thereby, the good shall flourish day by day, the wicked shall wane day by day, and bandits, villains, and deceivers shall be seized.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Why reveal this first?\n\nWhen Heaven is about to send rain, wind and clouds must first arise, that people may know it. The reason for this is to delight in their preparation and storage. The reason for revealing it first is to delight in the daily flourishing of those who do good and the daily cessation of those who do evil. Now, as the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, I fear that people’s wickedness may disrupt its governance. Thus, I first awaken them.\n\nIn governance, one ought to emulate Heaven. Heaven does not conceal people’s faults. The sages of the Great Antiquity did not do so either. To be called obscure and benighted, to have governance that reverses course and invites misfortune, failing to align with the will of Heaven and Earth—this is why I reveal it first.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Why must the lord remain inside behind closed doors while making the speaker stand outside? When a person is about to hear confidential words, their heart must not be aware beforehand. If faces draw too close, bystanders will know, and the speaker may come to harm. For a lord or leader to receive wisdom and insight, only to bring harm upon the speaker, is called injuring the loyal and trustworthy. Thereafter, no worthy minister or stalwart aide will dare speak again. With wisdom and insight cut off, governance will fall into chaos and peril.\n\nMoreover, the lord is yang and dwells in the yin. The minister is yin and stands in the yang. When yin and yang are in harmony, people delight in what is said, and every proposal is met with full trust. This is the natural law of Heaven. Does the Perfected One not know this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n\"Proceed without reckless speech—this is the scripture that brings Great Peace.\"\n\n*Assent.*\n\n**Right: Cultivating Goodness, Curbing Evil, Clarity, and Attainment—Those Who Gain the Methods of Loyalty and Trust**\n\n*Thus concludes* **The Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll Thirty-Five**\n\n**The Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll Thirty-Six**\n**Forty-Fourth Chapter: Guarding the Three Realities**\n\nThe Perfected One stepped forward.\n*Assent.*\n\nOf all the conduct in the world, how many matters are of great urgency?\nHow many are of minor urgency?\nAnd how many daily invite misfortune and calamity yet are deemed not urgent?\nThe Perfected One should explain this in full detail.\n*Assent.*\n\nI shall speak sincerely from the heart, without daring to conceal anything.\nProceed.\n\nIn all matters under Heaven, what is used is urgent; what is unused is not urgent.\nYour words are correct—yet also incorrect.\n\nWhat is truly and perpetually urgent, never to be abandoned—if abandoned, the world would perish and humanity vanish—are the celestial patterns that unite all unnamed things. These are of the greatest urgency.\n\nWhat you speak of now merely aligns with fleeting human desires, yet in truth, it fosters the conditions that summon misfortune and calamity.\n\nPerfected One, what I now ask of you is this: which are the perpetually urgent matters that cannot be set aside?\n\nLet only the Heavenly Master expound upon them, distinguishing and clarifying each.\n\nThis foolish student has overreached. If even a single word misses the mark, I dare not speak further.\n\nYet your words are correct. Only when one truly knows may one speak; to speak without knowing is to invite one’s own ruin.\n\nIn matters beyond human grasp, whether great or small, one must not feign knowledge. What one comprehends presents no difficulty; what one does not, no ease.\n\nTherefore, as the Heavenly Master has already enlightened this dull and unperceptive student, I humbly request that you reveal the beginning of this teaching. I shall listen with reverence.\n\nThere are two matters of great urgency in the world, and one of minor urgency. All else is not urgent—indeed, it wearies the ears and eyes of people, appearing good in the moment yet ultimately inviting calamity. All people meet with ruin and defeat thereby. What does this mean?\n\nHow foolish!\n\nYet when people first receive life and destiny at birth, they partake of Heaven and Earth, embracing primordial qi in its natural state. They neither drink nor eat, but live by inhaling and exhaling the qi of yin and yang, unaware of hunger or thirst. Over time, they drift far from the spirit Dao, gradually losing its guiding intent. Later generations no longer understand this truth, and the authentic Dao lies empty. Day by day, they drift toward falsity, until hunger and thirst arise—now, without eating and drinking, they perish. This is the first great urgency.\n\nHeaven and Earth, in their compassion, provide sustenance for life. Once people begin to eat and drink, the transmission of yin and yang under Heaven’s mandate must not be severed. This transmission should mirror Heaven and Earth, one yin and one yang. Thus, Heaven ordains that each person have one man and one woman, their forms harmonious, so that they may give birth. Why must it be one yin and one yang? When yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin; when yin reaches its extreme, it generates yang. These two alternate in transmission, like cold reaching its limit and turning to heat, heat reaching its limit and turning to cold—such is the natural art. Thus, they perpetuate life endlessly, preserving the celestial lineage through the ages. If men and women do not unite, their posterity will be cut off. If the world has no people, how can there be husbands and wives, fathers and children, rulers and ministers, masters and disciples? By what means would they be born and govern one another? Without male and female between Heaven and Earth, how would transmission continue? All would fall silent and empty—this is the second great urgency.\n\nTherefore, yin and yang transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, ensuring boundless continuity. Rulers and ministers govern disorder; sages and their disciples propagate the celestial teachings, aiding the emperor in transforming the world. Thus, sustenance and the union of men and women are the two great urgencies.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has cold and heat, which, if not shielded against, cause half the harm that kills people. Thus, Heaven generates the myriad things so they may be clothed. Without clothing, one might survive in caves or hidden places, but half the suffering would remain, not wholly eradicating death—this is the minor urgency.\n\nWhat is called the great urgency of the Heavenly Dao refers to annihilation and death; nothing is more urgent than this. Without clothing, people cannot properly eat, drink, or unite in yin and yang, nor cultivate goodness. With clothing, the worthy are born; without it, the unworthy arise. Thus, clothing serves only to ward off harm. Therefore, the sages of antiquity did not adorn themselves in dark and bright hues.\n\nSustenance and the union of yin and yang must not be severed; if severed, the world would have no people and could not be governed. Upholding these three—sustenance, union, and clothing—is sufficient to fulfill one’s Heaven-appointed years, transmit the celestial mandate, and ensure that endings give way to new beginnings without end. Thus, the sages of old governed by these principles, discarding all else that was not urgent and invited misfortune. What does this mean? These three accord with the movements of Heaven.\n\nMan is Heaven, woman is Earth, and clothing is dependence. Heaven and Earth, father and mother, are what the human form and body depend upon for nurture. Beyond these three, all other strange and deceptive things are not essential for life or the transmission of kind through generation. Instead, they multiply and give rise to deceit and treachery, causing governance to falter, the imperial qi to fail in its descent, the Dao of Heaven to go awry, and becoming a grave concern for the noble person.\n\nThe six emotions delight in what people indulge in, yet they do not restrain themselves; their minds grow ever more enamored, thereby inviting disaster. The noble person loses control of governance and decrees, while petty people resort to theft, plunder, and violence—all summoned by these non-essential things. The world falls into poverty, distress, and suffering; calamities arise in succession. Those below reach the extreme of deceiving those above, all stemming from this great harm.\n\nThis has endured for a long time, and the fault does not lie solely with the people of today, past ages, or future generations. Transmitted and inherited through generations, they have lost their original truth and authenticity, all turning to superficial splendor. Thus, they bring sorrow and harm upon themselves, unable to fulfill their Heaven-appointed years.\n\nLater generations engage in ever more affairs, busily pursuing what is not urgent, thereby inviting misfortune. Hence, they are constantly in restless motion, unable to cease. In high antiquity, governance was achieved through non-action, attaining the intent of the Dao and the will of Heaven, for they upheld the fundamentals and did not lose sight of the three urgent matters. In middle antiquity, affairs multiplied slightly, for they pursued many minor paths. In later antiquity, great worries abounded, for they pursued many paths and gave rise to deceit and falsehood, each striving to outdo the other in distress. From this, treachery and villainy emerged.\n\nHaving lost their inner authenticity and departed from their root, they turn to harming one another, causing people to be dazzled and confused. Though the noble person grieves and desires to rectify this with joy, the countless affairs they undertake cannot be properly ordered, throwing governance into chaos.\n\nThe Perfected One deeply contemplates this intent.\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nTo the right: by upholding the three realities, one harmonizes qi, and deceit, falsehood, treachery, and villainy are eradicated.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Three Urgent Matters and the Laws of Fortune and Misfortune**\nThe Perfected One stepped forward.\n\n\"Among the crawling creatures, how many matters are of great urgency, how many of minor urgency, and how many are not urgent at all?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" came the reply. \"Each has its own urgencies—thousands of strands, ten thousand paths—all designated as some form of urgency. Crawling creatures each have their own aspirations, yet they cannot be named.\"\n\nThe Perfected One sighed, \"You have grown weary and dim. Why do you persist in feigning ignorance? How utterly burdensome this is!\"\n\n\"It is not that I fall short.\"\n\n\"If you yourself admit to falling short, how can you speak of the common people losing their way? Is this not the very essence of falling short?\"\n\n\"Only the Heavenly Master, in your compassion, might dispel this ignorance and darkness.\"\n\n\"Very well. All crawling creatures receive the governance of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, and are born alike. They share two great urgencies and one minor urgency. What are these?\"\n\n\"When crawling creatures first receive the governance of yin and yang, they all breathe in unison, inhaling the qi of the natural world, yet they do not yet know food or drink. Over time, they drift far from their root, the great Dao wanes, and Heaven’s qi can no longer constantly follow and protect them. Thus, hunger and thirst arise, and Heaven provides food and drink. They, too, transmit the governance of yin and yang, hence the existence of male and female, generation after generation perpetuating life without end. To sever their food and drink, to disrupt the transmission of yin and yang—this would leave the world devoid of crawling creatures. These are the two great urgencies.\n\nThe minor urgency is this: creatures with fur, feathers, or scales may live, yet even bare-skinned creatures survive. Those with fur or feathers are ever gentle and beloved, shielding them from cold and heat. Those with scales ever ward off harm. These are not essential for life, hence their urgency is minor. All other movements are but sources of calamity. Those who do not uphold these three fundamentals, who act recklessly without cause, will surely meet death. This is the natural law suspended between Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Perfected One ought to ponder this intent. Those who uphold these three ways will harmonize with the central harmony of Heaven and Earth. Those who lose these three and pursue many paths will all suffer misfortune and harm.\"\n\n\"Excellent indeed, excellent indeed.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Master having expounded thus, a question was humbly posed: \"Now, what of the rooted plants and drooping branches that neither eat nor drink nor clothe themselves? How is this to be understood?\"\n\n\"Alas! Your learning does not advance day by day but instead recedes into ignorance. Why is this? They, too, have two great urgencies and one minor urgency. What are these? Listen closely.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\n\nAll things require rain to live—this is their drink and food. They must have day and night, one scorching and one shaded: by day, the yang qi brings warmth; by night, the yin qi brings moisture. Only thus do they grow and dwell in their place, uniting with yin and yang. Their drooping branches and spreading leaves are their clothing. Whether a thing has many leaves or few, it still lives—this is its substance and adornment.\n\nThus, without timely rain, the myriad things of the world cannot grow. If not a single thing existed under Heaven, it would be a great calamity—this is the first great urgency. Without the union of day and night and the blending of yin and yang qi, things would have no means to mature. If nothing under Heaven bore fruit, it would be a dire disaster—this is the second great urgency. Whether a thing has sparse leaves or many, it still bears fruit; the number of leaves is not what matters—this is the minor urgency. The fruit is its kernel.\n\nTherefore, the sages of old upheld these three realities, governing to bring Great Peace. They won the heart of Heaven and enjoyed enduring fortune, fulfilling their natural lifespan through substance alone, without need for elaborate ornamentation.\n\nThus, those lost in the branches must return to the center; those lost in the center must return to the root; those lost in adornment must return to substance; those lost in substance must return to the origin. The origin is what shares the same source as Heaven and Earth.\n\nTherefore, when governance is confused and chaotic in later ages, one must think of returning to the middle ages; when the middle ages are in chaos, one must think of returning to high antiquity; when high antiquity is in chaos, one must think of returning to the model of Heaven and Earth; when the model of Heaven and Earth is in doubt, one must think of returning to the form of the natural; when the natural is perplexing, one must think of returning to the primordial numinous qi.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of old who ‘drank qi’ and governed dwelt in secluded chambers to contemplate the Dao, reflecting on the signs of gain and loss, never daring to stray from the bounds of Heaven’s laws and punishments. Abiding in purity and stillness, once they grasped the intent, their governance swiftly brought peace, becoming like Heaven and Earth.\n\nPerfected One, deeply ponder my words of the Dao—do you understand? Excellent indeed, excellent indeed. Go forth, for you have awakened. Those who model their governance on my writings may test it at once without delay.\n\nDo not conceal this text, so that all people may recognize where they have erred in substance and adornment. Let them deeply reflect on its meaning and return to the Three Realities, without tormenting themselves with falsehood and deceit. Perfected One, take heed.\n\nYes, yes.\"\n\nThe right explanation: All things preserve their root and attain the Three Urgencies to prosper; lose the Three Urgencies and suffer harm.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: In Serving the Dead, One Must Not Exceed the Laws of the Living**\n\nThe Perfected One stepped forward.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nA filial child serves their parents—when the parents pass, should they then serve them as they did in life?\n\"No, they should serve them *beyond* how they did in life.\"\n\"Why is that?\"\n\"Through their parents, a person is born and grows to greatness. Seeing their parents die, with no hope of return, the heart cannot forget them even for a moment. In life, they saw each other daily, received teachings and commands, and could repay kindness in return. But in death, they can no longer behold one another, and sorrowful longing fills their thoughts—thus, they should serve them *beyond* how they did in life.\"\n\nThe Perfected One spoke truly, yet this is already a great departure from the true Dao of Heaven, drifting ever farther away. If even the Perfected One’s discourse remains thus, how much more do the benighted common folk err, clearly violating Heaven’s laws.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Master of Heaven.\"\n\"Indeed: a person in life resembles Heaven and belongs to Heaven; a person in death resembles Earth and belongs to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother. One must not serve the mother beyond the father. The living are yang; the dead are yin. One must not serve yin beyond yang. Yang is the ruler; yin is the subject. One must not serve the subject beyond the ruler. To serve yin in excess of yang is to invite *rebellious qi*; a small excess brings minor rebellion, a great excess brings great rebellion—this is called *rebellious qi*, called *rebellious governance*. Its harm allows yin to overpower yang, the lower to deceive the higher, and ghostly and malevolent entities to flourish, jointly usurping the human Dao, moving about in broad daylight without regard for others. Now, illnesses cannot be eradicated, and roaming ghosts do not cease. The great fault lies here—do you understand? Do you truly understand?\"\n\n\"I, foolish and unlearned, have committed such transgressions without realizing it. Now, hearing the Master of Heaven’s words, I am suddenly awakened with deep remorse. Master, I humbly beg your forgiveness and will diligently take heed. You have revealed what I did not comprehend—yet this transgression seems minor; why does it lead to such grave consequences?\"\n\"To serve yin beyond yang, to serve the lower beyond the higher—this is the greatest of transgressions. How can you call it minor when it reaches such extremes?\"\n\nThe Perfected One was again at a loss.\n\"Moreover, the living are yang; ghosts and spirits are yin. The living belong to day; the dead belong to night. Do you wish to understand the profound consequences of this? When day grows long, night becomes short; when night grows long, day becomes short. When yang flourishes, it overpowers yin, and yin dares not appear recklessly—thus, ghosts and spirits remain hidden. When yin flourishes, it overpowers yang, and yang retreats—thus, ghosts and spirits appear in daylight. The living accompany the sun; malevolent ghosts and entities accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Therefore, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun sets. When yin prevails, ghosts and entities jointly cause profound harm, beyond description—this is called *flourishing yin* and *weakening yang*. It disrupts governance and harms the living. This transgression is most severe—ponder it deeply.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven establishes its laws: the office of yin must always be weaker than yang. Just as a subject must be weaker than their ruler, so a subject serves their ruler with obedience; a child must be weaker than their parents, so a child serves their parents with filial piety. If they grow strong and unyielding, the harm becomes profound and severe. Therefore, though a filial child’s love cannot forget their parents, they must not serve them beyond how they did in life.\n\"Perfected One, do you now understand?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nBeware, beware. In all matters, one must not indulge recklessly or act wantonly.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nIf you serve the dead more lavishly than the living, you transgress against Heaven—how can this be? It is to disrespect yang and instead honor yin, called \"turning upward to face downward,\" hence the transgression against Heaven.\n\"Foolish one, I bear great fault. May the Heavenly Master forgive me.\"\nNot so. Simply reflect carefully: all actions must accord with the law.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nThe Heavenly Master has instructed me; I wish to fully understand why one must not exceed the standards of the living.\nIn burial rites, clothing, and funerary provisions, nothing should surpass what was done in life. All such excess is perverse governance, and even the dead incur punishment for it. To send off the dead without adhering to their original state—when the underworld’s ledgers examine the discrepancies, the false and deceptive conduct is exposed, and thus punishment follows.\nMoreover, excessive reverence in mourning rites—when inauspicious affairs grow too grand—invites misfortune. Ghosts and corpses flourish, spreading disease and harming people, giving rise to omens and strange transformations. How can this be made clear?\n\"Excellent question.\nIn high antiquity, the sages conducted funerals with utmost sincerity alone, never daring to make them extravagant. Death and mourning are the most inauspicious affairs under Heaven. To amplify inauspiciousness is to invite harm. Thus, sincerity alone sufficed, and though food and drink mirrored the living, nothing was lacking. In those times, people enjoyed good fortune, free from illness, and all fulfilled their natural lifespans.\nIn middle antiquity, funerary rites slightly deviated from the law. People could not maintain pure sincerity, losing the true intent and instead drifting into minor displays of reverence. They pursued ostentation to appease the living, their devotion to the dead only half-hearted. The dead’s ghosts came to partake, but with slight deviations from truth in the rites, the offerings summoned malevolence. Unseen spirits and entities arrived to share the feast, lingering to afflict people, so minor illnesses became common.\nIn later antiquity, people inherited and compounded the errors of middle antiquity, exacerbating them greatly. They no longer acted with sincerity toward their kin, instead seeking to overwhelm the living with grandeur. Imitating the ostentatious practices of the past, they fabricated falsehoods, failing to move Heaven or ensure the dead’s ghosts would regularly partake. Instead, they expanded sacrifices beyond measure, violating the law. Yin flourished and harmed the weakening yang, and unknown spirits and entities gathered to feast, then rampaged unchecked, killing people without end. When one person was slain, the perpetrators saw only the spectacle, not the guilt—why would they not persist?\nThus, malevolent qi daily increased, turning to attack its host. Once accustomed to feeding, it followed the living relentlessly. With yin strong and yang weak, the living were oppressed. Subjects deceived their rulers, children deceived their fathers, governance became unjust, and the people remained unaware. Hence, malevolence grew daily more severe, no longer restrained.\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity dared not serve the dead beyond how they served the living—this was a clear prohibition.\n\"Perfected One, do you now understand?\"\n\"How profound! How profound! Had the Heavenly Master not revealed this, my foolish heart would never have known it.\nPerfected One, you and I share a mind. Surely Heaven has sent you to preside over these inquiries. You must not take this lightly, which is why I have told you everything.\nThe reason is this: now, the qi of good governance is about to arrive. All affairs must follow its course; even a single reversal will prevent its coming.\nWhat does this mean? The Dao of Heaven should flourish yang, but to weaken yin is to follow the proper order. To instead amplify yin and suppress yang is to act perversely. To revere inauspicious affairs is to invite inauspicious qi, causing governance to falter and lose its rightful place—this is no minor transgression.\nPerfected One, do not conceal this text. Let it circulate so all people may recognize their gains and losses.\nWhen governance is disordered, the fault does not lie solely with Heaven, Earth, or the ruler. The blame rests with the common people, each bearing their own transgressions, mutually inheriting and compounding them, all seated in their failure to uphold truth.\nBy departing from truth and turning to falsehood, they stray from the root without realizing it.\nWhat does this mean? The living are the root; the dead are the false.\nWhy call it false? In truth, one does not see the deceased’s desires, yet the living fabricate them, vainly depicting forms and appearances beyond what existed in life. They cling to emptiness, not to substantive matters.\nWhen a person dies, the hun-soul returns to Heaven, the bones and flesh decompose into the earth, and the spirit cannot be summoned by mere thought to partake of offerings. The bones and flesh no longer remain; they are returned to the earth. Earth is humanity’s true mother. Born between Heaven and Earth, one’s fundamental nature differs from life, yet people do not understand their proper duty—what is it?\nThus, the filial child serves the dead according to their original state, thereby attaining truth. What the deceased disliked in life must not be imposed upon them in death. To exceed the standards of life is to invite profound and strange calamities.\nPerfected One, do you understand?\nBeware, beware.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Excellent, excellent—this is truly enlightened. You may be said to have grasped it; proceed now. Yes, yes.\"\n\n[Here ends the teaching on aligning life’s beginning and end with their fundamental principles.]\n\n**The Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll 36 (concluded)**\n**The Scripture of Great Peace, Scroll 37**\n**Test of the Writ: The Great Method of Utmost Sincerity (Forty-Seven)**\n\nThe dull and benighted student, whose understanding grows ever more dim, bows again. Now I harbor further doubts and humbly beseech the Heavenly Master, the August Divine One:\n\nWhat matter do you inquire about?\n\nI ask: What is the general essential purpose of this scripture’s text? For what duty was it revealed?\n\nExcellent, excellent. Your question truly reflects the heart of August Heaven. The great essential purpose of this text is to resolve the *chengfu*—the inherited burdens—borne by emperors and the people since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Yet now that it has been revealed for this purpose, why do you first speak of cultivating one’s nature?\n\nAh, Perfected One, you remain truly steadfast, yet I, dull and deluded, do not understand. Earlier, when you expounded your words, I took them as mere humility, but in truth, you spoke in profound obscurity. Why is this?\n\nVery well. Perfected One, listen again with clarified ears.\n\nThe reason people incur blame and responsibility is entirely because they fail to properly nurture themselves, losing all sense of the fundamental principles. Thus, they bear the burden of *chengfu*. Consider this: if parents lack the highest virtue and commit offenses against their neighbors, their descendants may later suffer harm at the hands of those same neighbors—this is a clear example of *chengfu*. Now, if former kings governed without aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth, their misrule was not the fault of one person alone, yet Heaven grew greatly enraged and displeased, bringing forth myriad disasters. Those who later held office inherited these burdens—how could this not be thoroughly examined?\n\nThus, this scripture was revealed precisely for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the great sages of antiquity all knew the Dao of self-cultivation, so they governed in accord with the Will and seldom incurred the failures of *chengfu*. But later generations of scholars and teachers largely concealed the true essential texts of the Dao, transmitting only superficial and ornate teachings. They deviated from the essential intent of the Heavenly Dao, causing later ages to grow increasingly shallow, unable to properly nurture and cherish themselves. Over time, they drifted ever farther from the Dao, believing the world held no means of self-preservation. They grew careless in their affairs, contending over rank and emolument, and thus brought upon themselves the disasters of *chengfu*.\n\nDo you now understand this meaning?\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\nHearing the Celestial Master’s words was like parting clouds to behold the sun—no different.\n\n\"Excellent! You may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nFoolish as I am, I have received your grace and now comprehend deeply. Yet I have no end of questions—only that the Celestial Master might admonish and caution me again.\n\nNow, one who can profoundly nurture the self is able to nurture others; one who can profoundly cherish the self is able to cherish others. If one neglects one’s own body and cannot even nurture oneself, how can one generously nurture others? If one cannot cherish and preserve one’s own form, carefully guarding the ancestral lineage of one’s forebears, how can one cherish and preserve others?\n\nHow foolish! Do you deeply understand this or not?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\n\nNow, you might think my writings untrustworthy. Test them against the records of those in high antiquity who followed the Way, won the Heart of Heaven, and enjoyed enduring fortune. Then examine the writings of those in middle antiquity who followed the Way and won the Heart of Heaven. Then consider the texts of those in later antiquity who pondered and practiced, won the Will of Heaven, and preserved themselves for long.\n\nYou should examine all these, from beginning to end, and you will find they align perfectly with my words, like a compass and square in perfect accord. Only then will you, though now enlightened, come to trust my writings fully.\n\nNowadays, the sickly and the young grow ever more reckless, contending over fate. The most foolish even claim Heaven is without knowledge, that the Dao of Heaven yields no effect. Yet even the earth does not deceive: plant millet, and you reap millet; plant wheat, and you reap wheat. The more effort one invests, the finer the harvest—how much more so with Heaven!\n\nNow, Heaven has accumulated resentment, and the ignorant, lacking understanding, teach one another to treat matters lightly, growing ever more foolish with each generation. Thus, calamities, anomalies, and strange omens arise without end.\n\nHeaven and the sovereign share a bond as deep as that of father and son, yet the foolish, seeing this, fail to admonish their ruler in due time. Instead, they conceal and obstruct, severing the path to Heaven. Heaven’s indignation only grows, and the burden of *chengfu* deepens, worsening beyond remedy.\n\nThough an emperor may possess the virtue of ten thousand men, he may still suffer harm without cause. Thus, those who do good remain unrecognized, as if their efforts were of no benefit. This is why the foolish claim Heaven is without knowledge—yet is there not reason for it?\n\nNow, hearing the Celestial Master’s words, my heart is enlightened as if reborn.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThough I, your disciple, have often troubled you, risking transgression to ask these matters—beginning with what seemed like errors—now that I have grasped your meaning, I rejoice without regret.\n\nFor without inquiry, there is no path to understanding. Your words have captured this intent.\n\nExcellent! The writings are complete in every part—head, feet, belly, back, surface, and core—so examine them alongside the worthy, and ask no more.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Right: Questions to the Celestial Master Regarding the Abundance of Writings from Beginning to End, and Their Resolute Decisions**\n\n**Section Forty-Eight: Five Matters Explaining the Method of *Chengyuan***\n\nThe benighted disciple bows and speaks:\n\n\"A great sage, upon hearing a master’s words from one side, understands the teachings of all four sides. A lesser sage, upon hearing a master’s words on one matter, grasps the teachings of all four. Thus, instruction is easy.\n\nBut for those of us who are dull, benighted, and slow, even when matters are explained repeatedly, doubts linger in the heart. Thus, I dare to ask the Celestial Master in full.\n\nYou have resolved the enmity of *chengfu* for High Heaven, lifted the calamities of *chengfu* for the Earth, eased the burdens of *chengfu* for emperors, absolved the transgressions of *chengfu* for the common people, and relieved the obligations of *chengfu* for the twelve thousand beings.\n\nYet I, your foolish disciple, ask these things on behalf of Heaven. I dare not but risk transgression to speak fully—may I hear the meaning in its entirety?\"\n\n\"Speak plainly.\n\nDo emperors and the people bear *chengfu*? Do all matters likewise carry *chengfu* of their own?\"\n\n\"Excellent! You ask on behalf of Heaven—truly thorough and careful.\n\nWhenever we meet, you say you ask these questions for Heaven’s sake, so I dare not be remiss.\n\nExcellent! You possess a diligent and upright intent—you may be entrusted with matters.\n\nNow, do you wish me to explain everything in full?\"\n\n\"I would not shrink from the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Yet I fear the vastness of the text may overwhelm your capacity. To fully expound the *chengfu* of the world would require millions of words—far too many to bear.\n\nInstead, I shall outline its general principles, so that the worthy may grasp the intent together, as if holding a contract.\n\nListen well to the Celestial Master.\n\nOpen both ears, sit calmly, and still your heart to listen.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Now, when Heaven and Earth give life to all things, and one harms them without virtue, the world falls into chaos: households grow poor and wanting, the old and weak suffer hunger and cold, the government reaps no harvest, and granaries stand empty. This transgression originates in harming the earth, yet people inherit its burden.\n\nThis is the first general matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nIf a master teaches ten disciples, and the master’s words are false and insincere, the ten disciples will act accordingly, each teaching ten more—now a hundred spread falsehoods. Those hundred, in turn, each teach ten more—now a thousand propagate error. Those thousand each teach ten more—now ten thousand spread falsehoods. When ten thousand voices speak from all sides, the world is filled with deception.\n\nMoreover, when many transmit words, their cumulative weight makes reversal impossible, and falsehood becomes the norm. This begins with one person’s misstatement, yet it leads all people astray, distorting the true texts of Heaven, altering customs, and corrupting the world—a great malady that cannot be curbed. Later generations grow ever worse.\n\nThis is the calamity of *chengfu*—clearly not the fault of later people. Yet later generations, unaware of its distant origins, blame their contemporaries, deepening mutual grievances. The stagnant *qi* remains unresolved, worsening day by day.\n\nThis is the second matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nSuppose a man deceives greatly in the marketplace, walking through its four sides, crying out that the earth will collapse into a watery abyss, weeping as he speaks...\"\n\nThe people of the marketplace spread the word, and ten thousand households came to know it. Old and young, great and small, all walked about speaking of it, until the whole world heard. Thus the world was deceived, and later generations only amplified it, those more distant suffering even worse. This began with one man’s words—yet the burden of *chengfu* for empty falsehoods falls upon him, so how can later people be at fault? Yet they turn and blame their contemporaries.\n\nThis is the third matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nOn South Mountain stands a great tree, its branches and canopy spreading hundreds of paces across the earth, though its trunk is but one. Above, its branches, leaves, and fruit are beyond measure; below, its roots do not firmly grasp the earth. When great winds and rains assail it, its countless branches, leaves, and fruit all wither and die—this is the great *chengfu* transgression of the ten thousand things, grasses and trees alike. The fault lies in the root, not the branches, yet they blame the branches—is this not a grievous wrong? Now the branches bear no fault, yet they suffer calamity and perish without cause. Such is the burden of *chengfu*—how can later generations be blamed?\n\nThis is the fourth matter—now attend once more with clarity.\n\nOn South Mountain lurks a poisonous *qi*. The mountain fails to contain it, and when the spring southern wind arises, the *qi* rides with it, obscuring sun and moon. The world bears its blame, and the dead pile up in great numbers. This began with the mountain’s release of *qi*—why then do the people of the world bear the burden of *chengfu*, falling ill and dying? Yet contemporaries say, “You are wicked, so Heaven slays you,” blaming the people—is this not a grievous wrong? These people bear no fault, yet they suffer this disaster through *chengfu*. Their souls cry out in injustice, and the living further blame them, their *qi* knotting in grievance until it stirs Heaven. The fault lies in the mountain’s evil *qi*, carried by the wind—such is the burden of *chengfu*.\n\nThis is the fifth matter—now, Perfected One, sit solemnly and heed my words with care.\n\nThe Dao was originally upright, never deceptive or false. Yet people rely on their ancestors, rulers, teachers, and fathers, whose teachings deviated slightly from the upright Way. They lost the upright words of self-nurturance, and later generations imitated them, worsening day by day. Over time, these teachings spread, and none grasped the truth. The world turned wholly to falsehood, unable to restrain itself, and thus ten thousand disasters arose, too many to record. This has accumulated over a long, long time. The foolish, knowing nothing, blame their rulers and contemporaries—are they not doubly wronged? The world is wholly lost, unable to recognize itself. Though the emperor alone may possess the virtue of ten thousand people, what can he do alone? Yet people act as they do—is there any remedy?\n\nIf one’s food is exhausted and they seek more, yet the sick cannot eat and thus perish—is there any remedy? If yin and yang unite in perfect harmony, with descendants to offer sacrifices and pray for blessings, yet one remains childless—is there any remedy? If one lives in utmost joy and goodness, strong and robust, yet turns out base and wicked—is there any remedy? These are all the great effects of *chengfu*. Yet they blame their contemporaries, so their governance cannot be settled. People have long transmitted falsehoods—how can they suddenly correct themselves? Thus grievances persist, growing ever more entrenched, and Heaven takes pity. Therefore, the Supreme Sovereign’s Dao descends in accord with the primordial *qi*. Do not wonder at this.\n\nWhat is the beginning? To ponder and guard the One—why? The One is the beginning of numbers, the Way of life, the origin of primordial *qi*, the guiding principle of Heaven. Thus one must guard and contemplate the One, ascending and descending from above.\n\nWhenever things or affairs grow too great and fail to return to their root, they become deeply confused and cannot be resolved. Thus they must return to their root. Therefore, the sages of old, before undertaking any great endeavor, would gaze up at the celestial patterns and look down at the earth’s principles, clearly demonstrating the luminous effects of returning to the root.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\nNow, Master, you seem troubled. I have already laid out the beginnings of *chengfu*—all matters in the world follow this pattern of *chengfu*. Do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\nToday, the Celestial Master has fully explained its origins, and this foolish student’s heart-knots are undone. Go now, and I will tell you one great essential truth.\n\nThose in high antiquity who attained the Dao and brought order to their governance simply mastered self-nurturance and guarded their root. In middle antiquity, those who slightly lost the Way merely neglected self-nurturance and lost their root. In later antiquity, they recklessly disregarded their bodies, believing they could regain them, and thus greatly lost the Way, throwing governance into chaos. Yet this is not the fault of later people—it is the convergence of *chengfu*’s calamity.\n\nThe text has grown repetitive; I will not speak further. A hundred words would say the same—there is no benefit. Do not add more writing. Today, my instructions have been fully entrusted to you, Perfected One. Yes, yes.\n\nGo now, reflect on the essentials, and transmit them to a virtuous ruler. Write the essentials to resolve *chengfu* and dispel its grievances. Yes, yes.\n\n**End of the Inquiry into the Knotted *Qi* of *Chengfu* in All Matters.**\n**Conclusion of *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Seven**\n**Beginning of *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Nine**\n\n**Fifty-Second Section: Explication of the Master’s Cipher Text**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed twice with reverence and said, \"Yes, yes. I humbly request the resolution of one lingering doubt.\n\nWhat does *ping yan* mean?\"\n\nThe cipher text you previously bestowed upon this dull and unenlightened student consists of ninety characters. I have retired to a secluded chamber, dwelling in solitude for days and nights, pondering with utmost diligence. Though my nature is dull and my mind slow, I have meditated ceaselessly, exhausting my spirit and depleting my heart, yet still fail to grasp its meaning. Now, I beseech the Heavenly Master to take pity on this unenlightened student and provide a full explication, that it may be transmitted through ten thousand generations, its threads unbroken and never forgotten.\n\n\"Excellent, your difficult question! You may indeed be called a celestial being.\"\n\n\"Very well. Perfected One, listen closely, and I shall fully resolve its essential meaning.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"My text reads: *Eleven characters to clarify the stopping point.*\"\n\n*Master* refers to the divine teacher of August Heaven. *Said* means discourse. I ascend to address Heaven, personally sent down to expound before emperors and the myriad people, resolving the karmic retributions of *chengfu* across a hundred million generations.\n\n*I* is the self. *Self* is the divine emissary urgently dispatched by Heaven. Today, the calamities of *chengfu* flow in four directions, their roots established at the beginning. Later rulers all follow in their wake, losing governance, unable to sever or halt them. Instead, they harm one another, inflicting profound suffering. Heaven regards this as a grave concern.\n\n*Characters* refers to the celestial script I now array, the accumulated symbols of Heaven’s text. *Ten* signifies that the text aligns with the celestial perfected, its sincerity and truth resonating perfectly—tenfold, without error, not a single deception. Those who obtain it and reflect deeply will realize that their ancestors all bore *chengfu*. Reciting it without cease, the calamities of *chengfu*, great and small, will all be dispelled.\n\n*One* is the essential Way, the correct path that begins with guarding the One. Guarding the One without pause, one’s clarity grows daily, and profound delusion dissolves. *Clarify* is the stopping point; *stopping* is sufficiency. Sufficiency gives rise to action. Those who practice this Way will only grow ever brighter, never again sinking into ignorance and darkness.\n\n*Eleven* is the scholar. *Clarify to the stopping point* is the red. When the red *qi* attains this, it will flourish anew, and the king’s great illumination will return. *Stopping* is the sufficiency of the myriad things. When the myriad things first sprout, they extend their roots to draw sustenance from their origin. Practicing this Way restores the primordial *qi*, aligning with the heart of Heaven and Earth—this is the highest and most excellent, thus called the Way of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Bing-wu and ding-si* are the ancestral beginning. *Bing-wu* and *ding-si* are fire, the red. *Bing-wu* is pure yang; *ding-si* is pure yin. Yin and yang harmonize all things. This means the *qi* of yin and yang will reunite and flourish across the world. *For* means to benefit the emperor by eliminating misfortune and calamity. *Ancestor* is the first, embodying the virtue of the Three Sovereigns. *Beginning* is the return to the original source. Thus, practicing this Way will restore the era of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Four mouths govern affairs and order the myriad things.* *Four with mouths* means speech. Those who daily recite this text will obtain the true celestial script, grasping its profound intent. Their will shall align with Heaven’s heart, enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place without further disorder—hence, *ordering the myriad things.*\n\n*With a cap and horn, govern the right—this is reciting the text.* Reciting this scripture without cease will rectify all affairs in a single stroke. Above, it will delight Heaven’s intent, bringing constant joy without lingering resentment.\n\n*The hidden dragon, unused, hums as its marker.* The *hidden dragon* is the return of Heaven’s *qi* to the first nine, the *jia-zi* year, the winter solstice—the day when Heaven and Earth truly begin. The *dragon* is the lesser yang of the east, the spirit of wood. Thus, the Dao of Heaven emerges through wood to activate the fire phase. When things are about to flourish, they must first open their gates. Perfected One, when the appointed time arrives, present this text in a place of luminous clarity. *Open* means to expand, to unblock, to reach. Opening the south will harmonize and invigorate the yang *qi*, dissolving the calamitous convergence of *chengfu.*\n\n*Hidden* means concealed. The Dao has already passed, returning to concealment. *Not* means caution, not yet. Those who first encounter the text do not yet know how to practice it. *Use* means governance, affairs. Today, Heaven intends this text to eliminate disasters. When it emerges in a *xuan-jia* year, the ruler of that time may not yet deeply fathom its meaning or be able to apply it—hence, *unused* means seeing the celestial signs but not daring to immediately implement them. Those who trust and apply it will see affairs established, effects manifest, and responses echoing—this is its clear proof, aligning with Heaven, thus the resonance.\n\n*Kan as the marker* is called *yan* by the child. *Jia* is Heaven, the guiding principle, yang. *Kan* is the child, water, yin, the marker. Thus, Heaven and Earth are ever united, their guiding principles and markers emerging at the outset of *xuan-jia-zi*. This may serve as the guiding principle for a virtuous ruler—hence, *hums as its marker.*\n\nThis is the celestial script of the Supreme Sovereign, revealed below as the true scripture for a virtuous ruler, to sever the perverse with the measuring line, with *xuan-jia* as its subtle beginning. All things that live take *jia* as their head and *zi* as their root—thus, it is presented in sequence beginning with *jia-zi.*\n\n*Those who behold it will enjoy long life.* *People* refers specifically to the emperor, the one of supreme virtue who readily perceives and practices the scripture of the Way. According to the auspicious signs, they will not doubt the Dao of Heaven. Deeply grasping its meaning, they will attain longevity. *Longevity* is fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years. *Long* means without end. *Enduring* means enduring existence. *Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, alive and no more.* *Dwelling* means abiding. *Abiding between Heaven and Earth, alive and no more* means studying the true Dao. Fleeting, ornamental texts cannot sustain life for long.\"\n\nAll calamities of *cheng-fu*—the burdens inherited from past transgressions—arise from the absence of a substantive and authentic Dao. Today, Heaven severs and casts them away.\n\n*Governing a million people, immortality may be awaited.*\n*Governing* means rectification. Heaven employs this scripture to rectify the hearts of all worthy ones, that each may heal their own afflictions, preserve the true, and expel the perverse. *Immortality may be awaited* signifies that upon hearing the true Dao, the world will arise as one, hastening to aid the virtuous ruler. To govern by the true Dao is the method of sustaining life—thus, immortality may be awaited.\n\n*Those who skillfully heal illness must not deceive or endanger.*\nAll people, being foolish, fail to consider their own well-being. Instead, they recklessly deceive themselves with false and spurious texts, inviting grievous wrong. In turn, they incur Heaven’s severe censure and bear the heavy responsibility of *cheng-fu*. Therefore, Heaven compels them to abandon superficial and ornate writings, to each uphold what is true and real, and to exert their utmost in practice. Thus, every person may benefit themselves, and none will dare again to deceive or endanger.\n\n*Rejoice in the marketplace of Everlasting Peace.*\n*Rejoice* means there is no greater joy than the advent of the Supreme Peace of the Celestial August One. *Ah!* is an exclamation of awe at the unmatched excellence of its virtue. *Everlasting* means those who practice this Dao will see their virtue flourish without end. *Peace* means they will no longer face peril or ruin. Those who attain and practice this Dao will see all the censures of Heaven and Earth from *cheng-fu* dissolve, achieving Everlasting Peace—vast and boundless, free from all care.\n\n*Marketplace* refers to the place beneath the banner where people gather and assemble. Those who practice this scripture speak of the great flourishing of the nation and its people, as if they were thronging in a bustling city.\n\n*Enabling people to attain the longevity of the Queen Mother of the West.*\n*Enabling people* refers to empowering the emperor who embodies celestial virtue and delights in enacting correct teachings. *As* means compliance. One who greatly complies with and practices this scripture aligns with the Dao of Heaven, bringing supreme fortune and no misfortune.\n\n*West* signifies that every person shelters the true Dao within their heart. *King* refers to the emperor who, by following and enacting the Dao of Heaven, achieves great flourishing and kingship—his governance unparalleled in excellence. *Mother* is the proof of venerable longevity, the elder of the spirits.\n\n*Comparable to the four seasons returning to their beginning.*\n*Comparable* means likened to the four seasons, which transmit and engender one another in an unbroken cycle, no longer inflicting harm. Such governance knows no punishment.\n\n*Ninety-character talismans are transmitted to the fangshi.*\n*Nine* signifies thoroughness and completion. Those who practice this will see their virtue thoroughly harmonize with the hearts of Heaven, Earth, yin, yang, and the myriad things. *Ten* means tenfold resonance, free from contrived teachings.\n\n*Characters* refer to the celestial patterns above and below, circulating and pervading the Dao to perfection. *Transmitted* means trustworthiness. Thus, written tokens of commission are made to convey it faithfully.\n\n*Fang* means great rectitude. Hastening to deliver this Dao to a ruler of virtue can dispel the misfortunes of *cheng-fu*, and their governance will be upright, great, and perfectly aligned.\n\n*Shi* refers to those of resolute aspiration, even if but a single individual. Such a person, with an upright heart, may be instructed and entrusted with this mission, to communicate this Dao. The fulfillment of this strategy will then be witnessed.\n\n*Do the Perfected Ones not yet comprehend?*\n*Indeed, indeed.*\n\nExcellent, excellent. To hear the Heavenly Master speak is to have great joy arrive. You may indeed be said to have understood.\n\nThis foolish student, whenever a question arises, knows it burdens the Heavenly Master with accumulated cares. Yet if I did not ask, how could I come to know? Still, your words are correct.\n\nThe worthy and the sages all ask when in doubt, and thus each has a teacher. One must not idly force explanations. Forced speech may suffice for a single utterance, but cannot turn again.\n\nIndeed, indeed—this is why this foolish student dares not force explanations. Your words are right: the great scholar is humble and does not err in this.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in every matter, opens the path to resolve the doubts of the common, answering even what was not asked before. If I now venture another question, it is most unseemly—yet I know not whether it is proper to speak or not.\n\nWhen in doubt, speak plainly without reserve.\n\nIndeed, indeed. From ancient times to now, the worthy and the sages all had teachers. Yet now the Heavenly Master’s Dao overflows—whom, then, should you take as teacher?\n\nExcellent, excellent—your question truly perceives the subtle intent. When I first began my studies, I too asked my teachers, and not just one. Only after the Dao was perfected and virtue accomplished did I ascend to align my will with Heaven, and only then did I know what Heaven wished to say.\n\nHeaven sent the spirit of the Great Yang to inform me, commanding me to speak. Thus, I take Heaven itself as my teacher. Even when addressing the Perfected Ones, if Heaven does not wish to speak, I dare not recklessly utter these words—Heaven would surely punish me. Do you, Perfected One, understand the gravity of this truth?\n\nYou must be cautious.\n\nIndeed, indeed. This foolish student’s every doubt, when asked of the Heavenly Master, finds resolution—my heart rejoices so that I cannot restrain my words. I wish to beg one more question.\n\nProceed, speak of the Dao.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, Heavenly Master, you have compared me to one benighted and shallow—fully expounding the doctrine of *cheng-fu*. Yet I do not understand: are *cheng* and *fu* the same, or different?\n\nThey are not the same. *Cheng* refers to what comes before, *fu* to what follows.\n\n*Cheng*—\"inheritance\"—means that one’s forebears originally acted in accord with the heart of Heaven, yet unknowingly allowed small transgressions to accumulate day by day, gathering over time into a weighty burden. Now, later generations, though innocent, suffer the consequences of those errors, inheriting their misfortunes and enduring their calamities. Thus, what precedes is called *cheng*, and what follows is called *fu*.\n\n*Fu*—\"burden\"—means that misfortune flows not from the governance of a single person, but spreads in an unbroken chain of injustice. Predecessors and successors bear the weight of one another, thus it is named *fu*. *Fu* is when forebears impose upon those who come after, and afflictions pass down in an unending cycle—disasters and harms that cannot be easily eradicated.\n\nYet when eradication does occur, new burdens arise. I reverently received this scripture from Heaven, for this Dao alone can wholly sever such cycles. Thus, it is most solemn, most precious, and without equal.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHow profound! How profound! Go now, and ask no more.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n[Right] Explanation of the Master’s Cipher Text: Ninety-Character Formula\nTrue Contract Formula, Fifty-First\n[Presented] before the Perfected One.\n\nAll matters under Heaven—what is right, and what is wrong? When tested and met with response, when affairs reach fruition, when knotted illnesses are dissolved and dispelled, all this is right. When tested and met with no response, when actions yield no success, when knotted illnesses remain unresolved, all this is wrong—not the fault of one alone.\n\nExcellent! Your words are truly so. Though few in number, they suffice to resolve ten thousand matters; I have nothing to add to your words.\n\nTo discern right from wrong, take this as the standard and model. Let no fox-like doubts linger in your heart, for this is the talisman that summons truth.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nMust all matters of trust and doubt be subjected to scrutiny and inquiry? The sages and worthies of old simply observed the evidence of a person’s conduct to know the truth—clear as the sun and moon. Your discourse on the accumulation of good is immutable.\n\nTo understand my scripture, seek all proof and validation herein. Perfected One, do you comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now. Name this the *True Contract*; guard it well, and cast it not into the lower realms. Let it serve as the cipher text and scriptural chapter of the decisive formula.\n\n[Right] *Talisman for Summoning Truth: The Verified True Contract*\n\n*The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Nine—end\n*Beginning of The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Forty\n\n**Striving in the Good Dharma, Fifty-Second [Chapter]**\n\nPerfected One, consider this:\n\nHow many predicaments do the people of the world face?\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nWhen all is level and unchanging, how many constraints press upon a person? Though their predicaments are many, are they not nameless?\n\nThey cannot be named.\n\nYou do not yet understand.\n\nThe people of the world face four predicaments.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nFirst: when you are born of your father and mother, in your youth you cannot leave their care—this is the first predicament.\n\nSecond: as you grow and mature, a woman desires marriage, a man desires a wife; unable to master their passions, they become bound by love and cannot part—this is the second predicament.\n\nThird: once bound in love, they bear children. As husband and wife age, their appearance becomes unlovely, yet their young children are dear; they must now be cared for—this is the third predicament.\n\nFourth: when their children grow and no longer need support, they themselves have aged and can no longer move freely—this is the fourth predicament.\n\nAfter these four predicaments, if one meets an enlightened teacher and reflects deeply upon guarding the Dao, those of exceptional talent and celestial mandate may attain liberation. Others may gain longevity, and still others may enjoy fleeting happiness in life. Yet when their hun and po dwell beneath the earth, they will relive those pleasures.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIn the underworld, the newly deceased are questioned about all they did and experienced in life. Based on these deeds, their names are recorded in the ledgers, and they are held accountable accordingly.\n\nThus, one must prepare in advance—safety and peril are determined by one’s own actions.\n\nPerfected One, be vigilant.\n\nDo you heed this warning?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe Heavenly Master then instructed with words unseen.\n\nWhy this instruction? Seeing your constant good intentions, I feared the Perfected One might grow weary, and so I have made this clear.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nPerfected One, what do you now aspire to in your studies?\n\nSetting life’s end as the limit—how excellent! Your aspiration may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nYet for ordinary people, all conduct is bounded by the span of life, differing only in whether their goodness or evil reaches its end. What does this mean? I wish to hear it.\n\nThose who maintain goodness and learning, who pass their days in joy and ease, become joyful wandering ghosts, spared from sorrow and suffering. Those who exhaust themselves in sorrow, or whose lives end in wickedness, become wretched ghosts. These are plainly visible matters, knowable to all.\n\nYet people refuse to do good and delight their hun and shen—truly a grave transgression. What does this mean?\n\nHuman life is formed by receiving the pure qi of Heaven and Earth, the convergence of the four seasons and five phases, the inherited body of one’s ancestors. This body, dwelling within Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and five phases, should ever delight in goodness and know no sorrow. Instead, unworthy descendants repeatedly transmit suffering to the body of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and five phases, causing it to endure prolonged hardship and even die in grievance. They further afflict their own hun and po, so that foolish scholars, failing to consider deeply, cannot long endure.\n\nThus, some wish to hasten their death, and upon dying, feel no regret. Their spirits merely pity themselves, needlessly incurring sorrow and resentment in this lower realm.\n\nTherefore, the great sages of antiquity, with deep calculation and far-reaching foresight, understood this and never ceased their learning. Those among them who became rulers delighted in pursuing Great Peace, aligning with the heart of Heaven, and their merit doubled. Their hun and shen constantly wandered in joy, uniting with Heaven’s virtuous qi.\n\nThose who failed to bring order to their governance acted against Heaven’s heart, forfeiting Heaven’s favor and earning no merit in the celestial realm. When their lives ended, their hun and shen faced solitary reproach in the underworld, dwelling among malign qi.\n\nThus, the supreme sages of high antiquity understood this and exerted themselves accordingly. Foolish people, lacking deep reflection, incur punishment from Heaven in life and from Earth in death—how terrifying!\n\nYour disciple is dull and ignorant; I do not wish to hear this.\n\nExcellent! Since you have come to study, if you do not wish to hear this, then strive earnestly to do good.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, dwelling in this realm, enables you to know Heaven’s mandate and receive profound instruction. How may one escape this fate?\n\nExcellent! Simply hasten to transmit my writings on the Dao, so that all under Heaven may practice them. Let each reflect on their own body, concentrate their essence, and align their thoughts with the Great Dao. Then they will recognize the origins of their transgressions, and the burden of inherited responsibility will be lifted. Heaven and Earth will rejoice for a great span of years, and the ancient age will be restored and doubled.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThis minor discourse now concludes. Perfected One, exert yourself and persevere. Return another day.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nStudy the text carefully, pondering its entirety. If your learning lacks precision, it is called \"huhuang\" (vague and indistinct). Seeking affairs without form or image, thoughts that do not reach their mark, the spirit has no means to proceed.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nAbove: The Heavenly Master’s admonition that failing to exert oneself in life and dying suddenly still subjects the hun and shen to the punishment of inherited responsibility.\nSection 53: Explanation of Origins and Ends. The Perfected One advances.\n\nSince you have come to study, you ought to broadly comprehend the intent of the Dao/Way—can the few be followed in practice? Can the many be followed in practice? Yet only when all are fully prepared and numerous may they be followed. Alas, you have not yet broadly grasped the essential intent of the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, Heaven is One, yet it acts contrary to Earth’s Two—what is the meaning of this? Earth is Two, yet it acts contrary to Humanity’s Three—what is the meaning of this? Foolish student, I wish to hear of their mutual interaction.\n\nThus, Earth serves as Heaven’s agent, and Humanity serves as Earth’s agent. When Heaven rejoices, it causes the myriad things upon Earth in this year to flourish greatly; when Heaven does not rejoice, though Earth may wish to nurture, it causes those things to turn foul. When Earth is good, those dwelling upon it—its people—are inclined toward goodness. This is the clear effect of their mutual agency.\n\nTherefore, order and chaos arise when the many ends fail to align with Heaven’s heart; one must return and revert to the root. When a person’s words are too numerous yet fail to reveal truth, one must return and revert to the essential root—only then may affairs be established through speech.\n\nThus, a single word that achieves its end is the root text. Two turns of phrase that conclude form a passage. Three words that conclude instead create explanations of difficulties, for distance from the truth gives rise to the need for explanation. Four words that conclude instead form literary expression. Five words that conclude instead produce falsehood. Six words that conclude instead produce deception. Seven words that conclude instead produce destruction. Eight words that conclude instead produce separation and estrangement from the Dao/Way, growing ever more distant. Nine words that conclude instead produce great chaos. Ten words that conclude instead produce annihilation and ruin.\n\nTherefore, when scriptures reach ten, they must be revised, for transmission without change leads to corruption. When all things are ruined, one must return to the root—thus reverting to the One as the primordial beginning. Hence, Heaven’s numbers begin with One and conclude at Ten; this is the natural nature of the Heavenly Dao/Way.\n\nThus, in ancient times, when the sages inquired of affairs, the first divination revealed fortune or misfortune—this was to guard the root, for the Heavenly spirits descended to inform them. The second divination was when the Earthly spirits emerged to inform them. The third divination was when the Human spirits emerged to inform them. Beyond this, all is deception of others, and divination cannot be trusted, for the hexagrams’ numbers will not be accurate.\n\nWhen human speech and writing are excessive, they lose their value.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow, as the Heavenly Master ever pities those who fall short, he once more wishes to entreat a single word.\n\n*Proceeding evenly.*\n\nWhy does the number of divinations stop at three and conclude?\n\nExcellent! You grasp deeply and inquire after this method of affairs. Indeed, Heaven’s numbers begin with the primordial One of Heaven. Descending, it joins with Earth to become Two, and with yin and yang complete, all things are born together. The myriad beings first sprout in the north, where the primordial qi arises at *zi*. Turning to the northeast, roots spread at *jiao*; turning to the east, life emerges and reaches forth; turning to the southeast, branches and leaves fully grow; turning to the south, they flourish in abundance; turning to the southwest, they incline toward fullness; turning to the west, they ripen; turning to the northwest, they come to an end. When things end, they must return to the beginning—thus at *hai*, two persons embrace the One, forming the Three Sovereigns’ origin.\n\nTherefore, *hai* is the kernel, the first coagulation of the seed—hence water begins to congeal in the tenth month. *Ren* means \"to bear,\" for once borne, it must burgeon, growing ever greater—thus *zi* means \"to burgeon.\" When Three achieves the harmonious qi of yin and yang, all is complete, and it returns to the initial arising—hence reverting to the root, it is named *jiazi*.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven in generating things must circulate and fully possess all. Only when one beholds the qi of Heaven and Earth’s four luminaries and five phases does completion come. If one qi is insufficient, then insufficiency immediately follows. Thus, it is rooted in Heaven and Earth’s circulation through the eight directions, and all numbers reach their fulfillment at Ten.\n\nPerfected One, do you now understand this?\n\n*Assenting, assenting.*\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed. Such profound grace is received—yet you must not express gratitude. Why? The merit of master and disciple is vast and weighty, comparable to parents giving birth to a child, which cannot be repaid or undone. What does this mean?\n\nBefore parents give birth to a child, if the foolish merely cast their essence into the wild, it takes root in the earth and becomes grass or trees, unaware that it was meant to become human. How could such blind bestowal ever be spoken of? Thus it becomes mere vegetation. Only when yin and yang unite does a human take form—how different from becoming grass or trees!\n\nOnce born, if a person, though naturally endowed, does not seek a worthy master but instead follows a base and ignorant teacher, they are taught evil ways, led into depravity, and may even bring about their own destruction. Their sins persist beyond death, consuming their entire household. Some are born yet never pursue learning, remaining fools. Such ignorant ones suffer in life and die in sorrow, yet their transgressions follow them below. Their souls, denied joy, cannot even become benevolent spirits after death.\n\nNow, a virtuous master teaches the foolish and lowly, transforming them into good people. Goodness pursued without cease leads to ever greater virtue; virtue pursued without cease leads to sagehood. Sagehood pursued without cease leads to profound understanding of the true Dao/Way. Guarding the Dao/Way without cease leads to immortality as a transcendent. Transcendence pursued without cease leads to perfection as a Perfected One. Perfection pursued without cease leads to divinity. Divinity pursued without cease leads to virtue/power equal to Heaven. Divinity pursued beyond divinity leads to virtue/power equal to the primordial qi. The primordial qi envelops Heaven and Earth; all eight directions receive its breath and come to life. Its virtue/power then blankets Heaven and Earth in all directions, and spirits draw sustenance from it. All under Heaven partake in its offerings, yet still fear they cannot fully honor it.\n\nSuch is the merit of a virtuous master who cultivates a worthy disciple—how could one ever express sufficient gratitude? How astonishing! My foolish words have touched upon taboos and overstepped—yet why do you persist in humility, Perfected One? You have made me understand whether gratitude is fitting or not.\n\n*Assenting, assenting.*\n\nHere concludes the explication of the fundamental and ultimate principles, the essential text on the merits of father and son, master and disciple.\n\n**Joy in Life, Attaining the Heart-Method of Heaven, Fifty-Fourth**\nThe Perfected One advances.\n\nAmong the conduct of common people and the governance of kings, what is most excellent? To extend compassion without harm—this, like the movement of Heaven, is most excellent. Your words may be said to grasp the intent of the Dao. Yet in governance, nothing surpasses emulating Heaven. Even so, there must be an order of precedence.\n\nWhat does this mean? Though this foolish one may speak once, I shall not repeat myself. May the Heavenly Master expound it.\n\nNow, in the conduct of common people and the governance of kings: the most excellent is to constantly desire the joy of life, ever thirsting for it as one parched—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in delighting in accomplishment, ever yearning to bring things to fruition as if grieving for one’s own body—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in benevolent giving, seeing others in poverty and want and sorrowing for them as if grieving for one’s own hunger and cold—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in establishing laws, not delighting in harm but merely acting from fear—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person errs, nothing is better than governance that does not ensnare them in crime—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person has already fallen into crime, if the heart does not desire to deeply harm them—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person’s transgression incurs a capital offense and nothing can be done, if one can avoid implicating their family and neighbors—only then is it fitting. Next, when the crime extends to family and neighbors, if one wishes to single out the guilty and takes care not to exterminate the human kindred entirely—only then is it fitting.\n\nFor humans are the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth. Extermination is called severing the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth, causing grievous injury to the body of Heaven and Earth. The harm runs deep, and in time, Heaven will exterminate the human race in turn. It is no easy matter to become the ancestor of a family. One ought to consider posterity and not impose the calamity of inherited burden upon descendants.\n\nThus, the sage in governance constantly contemplates Great Peace, ensuring that punishments are prepared but unused. The reason for this is to consider posterity. Now, Perfected One, have you seen the subtlety of these words?\n\n*Assenting, assenting.*\n\nThe Perfected One advances.\n\n*Assenting, assenting.*\n\nPerfected One, Perfected One—why do you not speak further, only offering humble deference? In a single word, it is so. My lineage strikes the earth, its mandate tied to Kunlun. Now, the Heavenly Master’s command resides in the Purple Palace of the Northern Culmen of Heaven. Today, the earth stands in the void; we must reverently receive Heaven’s bestowal. As disciples, we ought to comply and submit, emulating the earth’s emptiness of heart, respectfully receiving the Heavenly Master’s teachings—only then may the essential words of the supreme Dao be attained.\n\n□□□□□□□ without the bond of master and disciple, merely called an exchange of □□□□□□ by talent, is termed chaotic and impure learning. □□□□□□□□ decreed teachings, causing the Dao to obscure, one right and one wrong—such discourse cannot be transmitted as the law for emperors and kings. Thus, I dare not speak lightly.\n\nWhy this deference? I wish to deliberate with the Perfected One on what is good, and there is no harm in speaking. □□□□□—why should there be? Birth comes in sequence, knowledge varies in measure, conduct differs in rank, and dwelling places in elevation. Now, what I might say cannot compare to what the Heavenly Master has declared. The words of a petty man do not match the vision of the venerable elder who beholds the Dao, whose clarity stands at the forefront.\n\nThe Heavenly Master has graciously enlightened one as dull and unworthy as I, allowing me to grasp what is right and wrong, what is difficult—how could this be achieved in an instant? I pray you do not abandon me midway, but act for the sake of August Heaven and Mysterious Earth.\n\nNow that these are the words of Heaven, I shall not defer to you. Yet this disciple has long been silent and heavy-hearted, so I merely inquired. I dare not remain heavy-hearted. Today, upon hearing the Heavenly Master’s discourse, I am both overjoyed and startled. Why?\n\nI rejoice at having met the Master. I am startled for fear that my dull and sluggish learning is incomplete, and the Master may depart. Now, I ask eagerly, as one parched and desperate for drink. Why?\n\nI wish the Heavenly Master to transmit the Dao to his disciples and entrust it to a virtuous ruler capable of employing it. Then, yin and yang will each find their proper place, and all the great afflictions of inherited burdens under heaven will be entirely cured.\n\nExcellent indeed are your words. Upon examining my texts, the Dao is nearly complete. Ordering them from first to last, clarifying them like the sun and moon, they will naturally guide one another. If one contemplates and practices them today, all illnesses will be dispelled and cured without exception, and all will exclaim in joy and admiration.\n\n*Assenting, assenting.*\n\nAbove: The Secret of Restoring Heaven’s Will on the Order of Governance, and the Discourse on Deference Between Master and Disciple.\n\n*Thus concludes the fortieth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.\nHere begins the forty-first scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n\nHerein lies the fifty-fifth ancient text, titled *The Book of Secrets: \"The Sun Grows Dim, Ignorance Deepens, and Life Remains Unenlightened.\"*\n\nKneeling reverently, I bow twice and inquire of one matter.\n\n\"Speak plainly.\"\n\nThe Perfected One then declared: \"Through ceaseless self-renewal and diligent study, you have questioned matters on behalf of Heaven. My duty is to impart the Perfected One’s teachings to you—nothing shall I withhold. Speak swiftly.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Now, the lesser Daoist scriptures are regarded as the *Heavenly Classics*. They compile and collate the words of sages from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Scriptures of the Sages*. They compile and collate the words of the greatly virtuous from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Scriptures of Virtue*. They compile and collate the words of the wise and enlightened from the high, middle, and low antiquity to form the *Scriptures of the Worthy*. Yet, reflecting on the Celestial Master’s words, I fail to grasp deeply the intent behind this compilation and collation. I beseech the Celestial Master to clarify the proper order of their gateways, that a virtuous ruler may receive them as solemn teachings, and to instruct the assembly of worthies, enabling each to cultivate and refine their understanding within them.\"\n\n\"How refined indeed is the Perfected One’s inquiry—ever should it be thus!\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent.\"\n\n\"Very well. I shall expound fully. Follow closely and record my words; take care not to lose a single phrase. For I speak on behalf of Heaven and Earth, composing this for the supremely virtuous ruler, that it may dispel the calamities of inherited burdens since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Dare I speak falsely? Should I do so, I would incur the resentment of the August Heaven and Earth, and betray the enlightened, virtuous, and sagely ruler—my transgression would be profound indeed. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Now, as for the compilation and collation of Daoist texts from high, middle, and low antiquity: imagine the assembly of worthies collectively reading and examining all Daoist writings from past and present. For every scroll, if a single virtuous character or a single profound secret is found, it is recorded and extracted. One scroll yields one virtue; ten scrolls, ten virtues; a hundred scrolls, a hundred virtues; a thousand scrolls, a thousand virtues; ten thousand scrolls, ten thousand virtues; a hundred million scrolls, a hundred million virtues. If a scroll yields ten virtues, that is ten billion virtuous characters; if a hundred virtues, then a hundred billion. Record and compile them, gathering them in one place. The assembly of worthies, having examined all writings from past and present, transcribes them in full, then arranges them by category, each according to its kind. Redundancies are removed, and the essential texts are ordered and bound—thus is the ultimate comprehension of the essence of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things from antiquity to the present day achieved. From this, the *Heavenly Classics* are completed. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent. I have grasped it.\"\n\nExamine and collate the sacred scriptures of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity—each scroll containing one virtuous character or essential teaching; ten scrolls yield ten, a hundred scrolls yield a hundred, a thousand scrolls yield a thousand, ten thousand scrolls yield ten thousand, a hundred million scrolls yield a hundred million. If a scroll yields ten virtuous characters, that is ten billion; if a hundred, then a hundred billion. The wise and enlightened jointly record and compile them, gathering them in one hall of virtue. Having thoroughly collated them, they arrange them by category, allowing the wise and enlightened to order them together, removing redundancies—thus are the sacred scriptures completed. Do you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I have grasped it.\"\n\nExamine and collate the wise teachings of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity—each scroll recording one great virtue; ten scrolls yield ten, a hundred scrolls yield a hundred, a thousand scrolls yield a thousand, ten thousand scrolls yield ten thousand, a hundred million scrolls yield a hundred million. If a scroll yields ten, that is ten billion; if a hundred, then a hundred billion. Having reached completion, they again arrange them by category, allowing them to follow in order. The wise and enlightened jointly order them, removing redundancies, binding and placing them—thus are the *Scriptures of the Wise* completed. Do you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"You have indeed understood.\n\nNow, gather and collate all Daoist scriptures and texts, along with the writings of the many wise ones, and all the virtuous words, secrets, and matters spoken by the people. Record only what is good, assemble them all together, and bring them to one place. When this is fully accomplished, then together with the many wise and virtuous ones of great power, deliberate upon them. By category, refine and clarify them further, remove redundancies, order their words and texts, and record and arrange them. This is called obtaining the writings of Heaven and Earth and the words of human nature, thoroughly and definitively determining their virtuous secrets, with nothing lost—even as fine as a silk thread or a hair.\n\nThis Dao of the Dao is called the *Scripture of the Utmost Profundity of Heaven and Earth and Yin-Yang*, which for ten thousand myriad generations cannot again be altered.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Proceed with this, Perfected One—you may be said to have truly awakened.\n\nYet this foolish student falls short. Now I wish to ask one more doubt.\n\nProceed with your question.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, long ages have passed. The Yellow River and Luo River have produced writings and diagrams; some divine texts have emerged, some have been brought by sacred birds and beasts, spitting forth writings that have accumulated in great number—all differing in origin. The works of sages and worthies have likewise accumulated in abundance, each ultimately having its own matter. What doubt, what observation, what insight did the Heavenly Master have that you simultaneously instructed the many wise ones of later antiquity to gather and collate the writings and words of the literati of ancient and modern times?\n\nIndeed, there was something observed and seen. I dared not recklessly trouble the virtuous ones of later antiquity without cause. Now I have been sent forth into the world to explain to the lord of great virtue and power the concept of *chengfu*—the inherited burden of flowing disasters and accumulated poisons since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe celestial writings, sacred texts, and words of sages and worthies of ancient and modern times are already fully sufficient, yet I worry that each excels only in one matter. If we now apply the methods of a single school, we cannot entirely eliminate the calamities and transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, flowing disasters persist without end, passing on and inheriting one another. Those born later suffer ever-increasing afflictions and illnesses, and so the Heavenly Lord of Compassionate Virtue continues to bear their *chengfu*.\n\nHeavenly harmony cannot arise for those born later; this accumulation of disasters and faults lies truly in the fact that the former sages and worthies each excelled in one area yet all had their incomprehensions and shortcomings. Heaven, knowing their insufficiency, thus periodically produced the writings and diagrams of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, as well as other divine texts—each differing in their words. The great sages and worthies, appearing in different eras, each accomplished one matter, and their words likewise differed. Therefore, each had their inadequacies, each had their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSo it is. Clearly, none could fully comprehend the ultimate and profound meaning of the *Utmost Profundity*. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, residual disasters persist, ceaseless from beginning to end, varying only in severity.\n\nTherefore, Heaven calculated and determined that now, with the writings and texts above and below, all is fully and completely prepared. Even if sages were to arise again, there would be nothing more to create, nothing more to add, no room for further words, nothing more to contribute to the lord of great virtue and power of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven were to produce another sage, their words would still excel only in one endeavor, and residual flowing disasters and poisons would persist without end—no different from the former sages and worthies.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to deeply instruct the Perfected One and entrust the lord of virtue and power with these writings, to show them to the many wise ones. Gather and collate all the texts and spoken secrets of the world, supplementing above and below, removing redundancies, and preserving the essential words, essential texts, and secret matters. Record them to form scriptures. Only then will the true writings, correct characters, and virtuous words of Heaven and Earth all emerge. All that is false and deceptive will be entirely eliminated, the great illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be fully cured, flowing disasters will be utterly extinguished, and the people and the myriad things will each dwell in their proper place, no longer suffering misfortune or hardship.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to gather and collate them.\n\nMy writing does not merely imitate words—it imitates verification. Follow my texts and act accordingly: the calamities and transformations of Heaven and Earth, strange illnesses and diseases, treacherous and cunning ministers, inauspicious and deceptive evils—all will be entirely eliminated. This is no different from the sun dispersing the clouds.\n\nBy this, my words and my texts are verified—ten thousand times without a single error.\n\nIf you do not vigorously apply my texts, even if I respectfully receive Heaven’s words, descend with teachings, and manifest writings, yet they are not used—how can Heaven idly eliminate disasters? If the texts themselves are in chaos, people will likewise be in chaos, and disasters will have no means of being removed.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Excellent, you have understood. Now, I wish to ask one doubtful matter. Speak plainly.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, divine sages and worthy persons have all been born of Heaven, and those who have successively presided over the words of Heaven and Earth have all established laws for rulers to eliminate disasters and pacify the world. When emperors and kings follow and apply these, they do not deviate from the patterns of Heaven’s will and the regulations of yin and yang, and the texts they produce each bear their own names and titles.\n\nNow, what should the writings on the Dao and virtue composed by the Celestial Master be called?\n\nExcellent indeed is your question, Perfected One. They are to be named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*.\n\nWhy are they properly named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*?\n\nThe *Great* signifies that which is vast—practicing this governance yields the most supreme and unparalleled rule. The *Cavern* means that its Dao and virtue, whether good or ill, thoroughly harmonize with the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, and its resonance extends without fail to all six directions, inner and outer. All things are made to act with caution and goodness, and every being attains its rightful place.\n\nThis Dao gathers and examines the celestial, terrestrial, human, and divine texts since the opening of Heaven and Earth, selecting only the finest to compile into the scriptures of the *Cavern-Reaching* canon. When emperors and kings follow and apply these, enlisting the collective efforts of all worthy persons to practice them, disasters within the four seas and four borders will be entirely swept away. Such governance becomes as luminously clear as the Cavern itself, resembling the state of Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits.\n\nThus, it is named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*. Do you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nHow astonishing! How astonishing! Perfected One, have you now awakened to this?\n\nAbove are the collated texts and oral transmissions of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Antiquities.\n\n*The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Forty-One concludes here.\n*The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Forty-Two begins:\n**Method Fifty-Six: The Nine Heavens’ Dispersion of Former Kings’ Disasters**\n\nIn all, Heaven ordains nine kinds of people—what then do yin and yang attain?\n\nHumanity is the chief regulator of the myriad things.\nThe formless spirit-people of entrusted qi are charged with governing primordial qi.\nThe great spirit-people are charged with governing Heaven.\nThe Perfected are charged with governing Earth.\nThe Immortals are charged with governing the four seasons.\nThe Great Dao-people are charged with governing the Five Phases.\nThe Sages are charged with governing yin and yang.\nThe Worthy are charged with governing texts and transmitting teachings.\nThe common people are charged with governing grasses, trees, and the five grains.\nServants and bondmaids are charged with governing wealth and goods.\n\nWhy is this so?\nAll matters are governed according to their kind.\nThe formless spirit-people of entrusted qi resemble primordial qi, thus they govern primordial qi.\nThe great spirit-people possess form and great spirit, resembling Heaven, thus they govern Heaven.\nThe Perfected are devoted and trustworthy, resembling Earth, thus they govern Earth.\nThe Immortals transform and change, resembling the four seasons, thus they govern the four seasons.\nThe Great Dao-people excel in divining fortune and misfortune, resembling the Five Phases, thus they govern the Five Phases.\nThe Sages preside over harmonious qi, resembling yin and yang, thus they govern yin and yang.\nThe Worthy manage texts and articulate teachings, resembling written words, thus they govern texts.\nThe common people are chaotic and ignorant, resembling the myriad things, thus they govern the myriad things.\nServants and bondmaids produce wealth, resembling goods and currency—abundant when rich, absent when poor, capable of circulation—thus they govern wealth and goods.\n\nWhen August Heaven assigns duties, it does not override their nature; each follows its kind without error. To act contrary invites great harm.\nThus, all the common people ordained by Heaven must comply with this.\nThe Sages of antiquity deeply understood this principle, never losing the Will of Heaven and thereby gaining Heaven’s favor.\n\nPerfected One, do you now comprehend this?\nExcellent! Excellent!\nWhat I have spoken serves as a warning to you, Perfected One, that you may not lose it.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nGo forth and strive.\n\nThe foolish student’s heart remains knotted and unresolved: \"You speak of nine persons, each with distinct affairs—how does this benefit the king’s governance?\"\n\nIt does not. When governance aligns with the Will of Heaven, these nine *qi* harmonize, and the nine persons unite in purpose, thereby achieving the Great Peace of the Supreme August. If these nine matters diverge and act in discord, the Great Peace cannot be attained.\n\nThese nine affairs are interdependent, mutually generating and completing one another—yet people fail to comprehend them deeply. The former sages and worthies did not expound upon them, and so they have long remained obscured.\n\nNow, if even one matter is left ungoverned, peace cannot be achieved. Why? When the *qi* of the Supreme August arrives in full, these nine persons all come to assist the king in governance. If a single *qi* falls out of harmony, there will invariably be discord, and thus the governance of yin and yang cannot be fully harmonized.\n\nHow do they come? Invisible spirit-persons arrive to instruct the king, and his heart grows daily brighter. Great spirit-persons appear from time to time to teach the principles of governance. Perfected Ones, immortals, and great Daoists all come as teachers to aid in instruction and transformation. Sages and worthies emerge, reclusive scholars come forth as ministers, and the common people—servants and bondmaids alike—submit to goodness, refraining from wickedness. This is the sign of Heaven and Earth’s great joy.\n\nIf a single *qi* fails to harmonize, what then? If the Primordial *qi* is disharmonious, invisible spirit-persons do not come. If the *qi* of Heaven is disharmonious, great spirit-persons do not come. If the *qi* of Earth is disharmonious, Perfected Ones do not come. If the four seasons are disharmonious, immortals do not come. If the Five Phases are disharmonious, great Daoists do not come. If yin and yang are disharmonious, sages do not come. If written words are not true, great worthies do not come. If the myriad things are not in harmony, the common people grow chaotic and wealth diminishes. Servants and bondmaids flee, and all affairs lose their proper order. This is the very essence of harm.\n\nNow, Perfected One, since you wish to save the world from chaotic *qi*, you must strive to harmonize it with diligence and without weariness. Be cautious.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nWhen *qi* is attained, these nine kinds of persons all guard the Dao, and the accumulated disasters of past kings across ten thousand generations dissolve entirely. When these persons all lose their proper place, the harm of accumulated burdens daily increases.\n\nThese nine kinds of persons range from the formless above to servants and bondmaids below, each regulating one *qi*, and thus the nine *qi* and yin-yang are harmonized. Now, if Heaven intends to harmonize and regulate *qi*, one must first consume *qi*. Therefore, when superior scholars are about to enter the Dao, they first abstain from eating the formed and consume *qi* instead, thereby merging with the primordial *qi*. Thus, they should be nurtured in thatched chambers, made to fast and abstain, shielded from evil and wickedness, daily refining their forms, and not depriving them of their desires. They can then depart without obstruction, ascending to assist the Perfected Ones and primordial *qi* in Heaven’s governance. These are the divine scholars, the officers of Heaven. Do not forbid or hinder them; if one can truly attain this, they are called Heaven’s scholars. Heaven examines and selects the good, greatly rejoicing in them, and in turn benefits humanity.\n\nWhat does this mean? Those who attain the Dao and depart, though not of immediate use to the eyes of men, all together harmonize the *qi* of yin and yang. In ancient times, when the emperor-kings sacrificed to Heaven, the spirits above descended to partake of the offerings—this is what it means.\n\nBut do only the spirits of Heaven descend to partake? Excellent indeed, your words are correct. Now, these persons serve as Heaven’s officers, and the spirits of Heaven are their sovereigns and superiors. Sovereign and officer act as each other’s emissaries. The duty of the officer lies in carrying out all affairs; when Daoists perform good deeds and merit, the sovereign and their subordinates descend, and upon descending, they rejoice and are pleased, thus eliminating the accumulated burdens of humanity. If the officers are displeased, then Daoists have transgressed against Heaven’s sovereign, and the officers will not descend to partake of human offerings. Thus, transgressions and reproach daily multiply. If one’s own person still incurs grave transgressions, how can one eliminate the lingering disasters of past kings?\n\nPerfected One, do you not also understand this? How astonishing!\n\nI tremble with great fear, as if bereft of qi. Now I have come to inquire of the Heavenly Master, yet never expected to hear such words. Go forth, and exert yourself. When your discourse is complete, I shall depart.\" \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nOn the right: After examining the nine bamboo slips, none among the nine had fulfilled their aspirations. Yet when King Ping governed the realm, he rejoiced and dissolved the accumulated burdens of past kings.\n\n**Verifying the Authenticity of the Dao: Fifty-Seventh Formula**\n\nThe affairs at hand will soon be completed. Perfected One, come forward to receive instruction in detail. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nSince practicing this Dao, the burdens of the past have grown ever more distant, and accumulated afflictions, knotted qi, calamities, and lingering poisons have indeed multiplied—none can be dispelled in but a moment. Yet once you know and practice this, the afflictions of past burdens will daily diminish, monthly dissolve, and yearly vanish. How can this be known?\n\nExcellent indeed is your question—it has grasped the intent of the Dao. Now listen carefully. After practicing this, all documents under Heaven will be set right, and all people will likewise be rectified, entering the true Dao without further falsehood or deception. People will restrain themselves, and those born thereafter will do so even more, emulating one another and all understanding the inner Way. Seeing their own bodies, they will each cherish and value themselves. Those born later will be filial and long-lived, all skilled in caring for the aged. Their countenances will differ from those of the Dao-less era. Later generations will daily comprehend its profound meaning, regarding it as their very home. Their learning will surpass that of their predecessors, daily growing closer, more affectionate, and intimate. They will revere those of the Dao, and weapons, deceit, and treachery will cease to exist. Thus, the afflictions of past burdens will daily dissipate—this is the natural art, □□ with not a single error. This is the great efficacy of my writings, not mere empty words of goodness. Only when verified by evidence do they resonate with Heaven and Earth—how could one speak falsely?\n\nThus, the texts before and after were not produced by a single hand, and their accumulated subtleties are difficult to fathom. Therefore, my Dao is founded on sincerity. You have persistently □□ inquired, surely desiring to know its great efficacy. Its effects are inverse, like cold and heat: when heat is abundant, cold is scant; when cold is abundant, heat is scant.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who have taught others have often concealed the true Dao, instead imparting superficial learning that yields but slight and fleeting benefit. Later generations have daily compounded this, worsening the original state, perpetuating false learning through transmission. Though the Dao of Heaven is vast and distant, the initial authors of such texts have become the great ladder of deception. Once deception takes root, later generations employ it for profit. Now, the superior have nothing to trust, and the inferior have nowhere to entrust their lives. Thus, mutual suspicion arises, leading to disorder. Later generations inherit these burdens in succession, and the afflictions of their predecessors accumulate—hence, it is called worsening.\n\nHeaven is now aggrieved, which is why I speak to you □□. Perfected One, exert yourself and take care to encourage yourself. You will remove illness from Heaven and dispel afflictions for the emperors and kings. The heavens above will know you have rendered great merit. \"I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nOn the right: *Verifying the Efficacy of Practice and Discerning the Authenticity of the Dao*.\n\n**The Four Roots and Branches of Conduct: Fifty-Eighth Formula**\n\nPerfected One, come forward. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nHow many kinds of conduct do people have? There are a hundred conducts and ten thousand variations. Not so. Perfected One, your words resemble those of common folk. People have four kinds of conduct. The first is *or*.\n\nWhat does this mean? When people act without goodness, it is evil; when they act without goodness yet not evil, it is superficial and mediocre conduct. When they alternate between goodness and evil, it is impure and inconstant conduct—neither can be relied upon, and fortune or misfortune cannot be determined.\n\nExcellent. How many kinds of fortune and misfortune are there? There are a thousand strands and a hundred million variations. Perfected One, your words again resemble those of common folk. There are four kinds of fortune and misfortune. The first is *delusion*.\n\nWhat does this mean? In all affairs of conduct, if it is not greatly fortunate, it will be greatly misfortunate; if it is neither fortunate nor misfortunate, it is a superficial and mediocre fate. If it alternates between fortune and misfortune, it is mixed and impure, an inconstant fate that cannot be divined.\n\nExcellent. How many kinds of good and evil are there in the nature of Heaven and Earth, in years, months, and days? They cannot be fully enumerated. You are thoroughly intoxicated—your words are as if shrouded in mist. Heaven and Earth, years, months, and days have four kinds of conduct. The first is *impurity*, which governs transformations and anomalies.\n\nWhat does this mean? Now listen carefully, Perfected One.\n\nNow, when Heaven and Earth and the years are not greatly joyous, they verge on great evil; when they are neither joyous nor evil, it is a mediocre year. When good and evil alternate, it is a year of celestial anomalies and delusion.\n\nToday, if the day is not greatly good, it verges on great evil; if it is neither good nor evil, it is a mediocre day or month. When good and evil alternate, it is a deluded course, governing conduct that is strange and calamitous.\n\nI have merely outlined the guiding principles to reveal the beginning—all matters under Heaven follow this pattern.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nNow, all the myriad things and people of the world, if they do not enter into goodness, must fall into evil. If they are neither good nor evil, it is a mediocre course. When good and evil alternate, it is a course of deceit and falsity—nothing can be established upon it.\n\nThe mediocre course cannot be encouraged, while great goodness and great evil achieve renown.\n\nWhy are there precisely these four courses?\nExcellent! Your questioning is profound and grasps the intent of the Dao.\n\nNow, great goodness is the pure course of Grand Yang. Great evil is the course of Grand Yin’s destructive force. The blending of good and evil is the course of harmony. The inconstant course arises when Heaven and Earth, ruler and ministers, the people, and the myriad things lose their proper Way.\n\nThus, in conduct, one should seek rectitude: following the Yang yields more goodness, following the Yin yields more evil, and following harmony results in mediocrity. As for the inconstant fortune and misfortune, such conduct has no recurring pattern or measure.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply observed Heaven and Earth, years, months, and days, the people, and the myriad things, examining their rise and decline, mediocrity and advancement, to know whether their own conduct was aligned or misaligned. It is like using a luminous mirror to reflect one’s form—how could it be otherwise?\n\nExcellent, excellent! What is to be done now?\nNow, in conduct, to model oneself after Heaven is the beginning; to model after Earth is to invite many harms; to model after harmony is secondary; and inconstancy is the end of conduct.\n\nWhy do people now arrive at the inconstant course?\nAt first, their forebears made minor transgressions, then slight errors, then greater errors, then grave mistakes. The roots of the Way became ever more confused, leaving nothing to rely upon in their intent. Thus, they turned to inconstant conduct, altering their words to justify inconstant years.\n\nThis shows that the decline of the Dao has not yet reached its limit—one must return to the root.\n\nThe sages of antiquity saw this and knew it was the end of the current. When the limit was reached, they returned to the origin, thus never losing governance and preserving their Mandate of Heaven. Therefore, the greatly wise and sagely see matters clearly and so always enjoy unique good fortune.\n\nPerfected One, do you delight in further understanding its truth and effects?\nIt is only for the Heavenly Master to reveal this.\n\nWhen the root of a year flourishes but its end turns evil, it is the extreme of Yin and Yang. When later generations grow increasingly wicked and shallow, it is the extreme of the age. When the myriad things flourish at the root but yield no harvest at the end, it is the extreme of things. When later generations speak much but with empty deceit, lacking substance, it is the extreme of speech. When writings accumulate in abundance yet lack truth, it is the extreme of literature.\n\nAll these arise from forsaking the root for the branches, abandoning substance for ornamentation. Thus, Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things, yet many lack a true root or fruition. The fault lies in forsaking the root to pursue the branches, abandoning truth for falsity, abandoning depth for shallowness, and making this the norm.\n\nCustoms become so ingrained that people no longer recognize their mutual harm, and alone they accumulate opposition to the laws of Heaven. Later generations grow ever more frivolous in affairs, crafting deceit and falsity. Habit solidifies into nature, and they can no longer restrain themselves, instead claiming to understand matters. Thus, they inherit and compound one another’s burdens, creating Heaven’s blame and Earth’s calamity. These spread in all directions, unrestrained and unchecked.\n\nEven if a ruler is benevolent and wise, how can he sever this flow of errors spanning myriad generations? The initial losses were minor, each no more than a grain of millet. Yet the Way of Heaven loses a hair’s breadth, and the error extends a thousand miles. Grain by grain they accumulate, filling granaries with tens of thousands of *hu*.\n\nRaindrop by raindrop they follow one another, and the flowing waters never cease, forming the hundred rivers and filling the Four Seas. The root cannot be removed, so one must correct it with the true Dao, returning from the extreme of the branches to the root, returning from ornamentation to substance, returning from falsity to truth.\n\nWhen the branches reach their limit, one should return to the root; when conduct reaches its extreme, one must return to the origin—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nTo lose the true Way is no minor illness. It extends even beyond the end of one’s life, as errors are inherited and compounded. Later generations grow ever more confused and lost, the true Way grows ever dimmer, and the darkness of losing the Way deepens. The qi of Heaven becomes contrary and rebellious—how can governance be peaceful?\n\nPeople suffer its poison and harm—how can they attain longevity? The myriad things are injured and die prematurely in great numbers.\n\nThus, I repeatedly enjoin the Perfected Ones to transmit my writings, so that each person may reflect on the meaning of losing the Way, and each may worry and labor over their own illnesses. Then Heaven and Earth, the Thearch, the people, and the myriad things will all be at peace.\n\nPerfected One, if you delight in aligning with the heart of Heaven, you must not be negligent or careless.\n\nIndeed, indeed! I wish to ask one more question.\n\nThe Celestial Master speaks now of fortune and misfortune—are these merely the workings of the times?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, in your questioning you have grasped the meaning of the Dao. What reaches its utmost above must return below; what extends to its farthest outward must return inward. Thus, when yang reaches its extreme, it turns to yin; when yin reaches its nadir, it reverts to yang. What has gone to its end must return to its root.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, even minor deviations from the Dao’s intent have accumulated, passed down through generations, until falsehood and deceit have reached their extreme. How do we know this? Observe that among the myriad things and the people, many begin with goodness but end in evil—few complete what they start. Their words begin with substance but end in emptiness. The sages of old constantly observed the movements of the people to understand this, and thus they never lost the Way.\n\nExcellent, excellent indeed. I wish to ask one more question.\n\nProceed.\n\nIf, as the Celestial Master says, things have their nadir and their zenith—take, for example, nine ranks of people: at the highest extreme are the ethereal spirit-people, and at the lowest, slaves and servants. If those below study and ascend, can those at the highest extreme also descend again?\n\nExcellent is your question. Perfected One, you still seem unenlightened, not yet having penetrated the Dao of the Great Ultimate. These ethereal spirit-people merge their forms and powers with primordial qi, coexisting with the four seasons and the five phases. All spirit in humanity is received from Heaven’s qi, and Heaven’s qi is received from primordial qi. Spirit rides upon qi to move, so where there is qi, there is spirit; where there is spirit, there is qi. When spirit departs, qi is cut off; when qi perishes, spirit departs. Thus, without spirit, one dies; without qi, one dies.\n\nCould an ethereal spirit-person enter a human’s belly?\n\nIndeed.\n\nMoreover, the five phases arise and flourish from primordial qi, and spirit moves in unison with primordial qi, sharing the same body. Now, the five phases enter to become the human’s organs—among these nine ranks of people, can the highest extreme descend and re-enter the human body?\n\nExcellent, excellent. Though you have studied for a long time, you have only now glimpsed this teaching. You must refine your learning—without refinement, there is no benefit.\n\nIndeed.\n\nFrom the Celestial Master’s words, is the Dao of Heaven truly like a cycle?\n\nYes, you may be said to have understood it. Go now, and if you have further doubts, do not hesitate to ask.\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe right-side bamboo slips record the four celestial phases, their true origins and ends in the Great Ultimate, returning to govern.\n\n*End of Scroll Forty-Two of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Beginning of Scroll Forty-Three of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine: The Great and Small Methods of Admonition and Rectification**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed and said: \"This foolish student is benighted and dull, truly ignorant of the Dao. Now that I have been charged with observing Heaven’s safety, peril, fortune, and misfortune, I dare to inquire fully into the essentials of the Dao.\n\nIn this age, do the divine laws of spirits and deities also include admonition and rectification?\"\n\nThe Celestial Master instructed: \"You have been shown the profound intent of the supreme Dao.\n\nYour question—how wondrous, essential, and far-reaching it is!\n\nI have observed that humans admonish and rectify one another, so I ask: does Heaven also admonish and rectify?\"\n\nExcellent! Your question has grasped the true essence of the Dao of Heaven. The celestial spirits have emerged, and the deities rejoice.\n\nNow, I shall explain its great essentials for you, so that for ten thousand generations it may never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Now, when Heaven offers minor admonition, its countenance changes; when it offers great admonition, Heaven itself trembles and its body splits. If its admonitions are unheeded, it will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the Three Luminaries offer minor admonition, minor affairs cause the stars to alter their hue; when they offer great admonition, the Three Luminaries lose their measure and cease to shine. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen Earth offers minor admonition, it quakes and sways; when it offers great admonition, mountains collapse and the earth splits. If its admonitions are unheeded, it will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the Five Phases offer minor admonition, disasters arise; when they offer great admonition, creatures of the east slay people, poisons of the south kill people, tigers and wolves of the west kill people, water creatures of the north kill people, and in the center, officials and commoners use toxins to murder one another. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the Four Seasons offer minor admonition, cold and heat slightly lose their balance; when they offer great admonition, cold and heat reverse their positions, and the qi of the seasons no longer follow their proper measures. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the qi of the six directions jointly offer minor admonition, disorder and calamity arise repeatedly, with creatures—some flying, some walking—emerging as disasters. Clouds and winds gather but bring no rain, leaving the skies empty and barren. When they offer great admonition, floods and droughts lose their regularity, harming and killing the myriad beings and the people. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen flying and walking birds and beasts offer minor admonition, they bring harm to people; when they offer great admonition, birds and beasts devour people, and locusts swarm in great numbers. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the spirits and deities offer minor admonition, they subtly afflict officials and commoners with illness; when they offer great admonition, they cause families to be torn apart and destroyed. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby perish.\n\nWhen the six directions offer minor admonition, winds and rains erupt chaotically, moving with malevolent poisons to harm people; when they offer great admonition, they act perversely and without reason, hurling tiles and stones, causing the earth to rise and strike the august Heaven, shattering houses, and shaking mountains and hills. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen the sounds of Heaven and Earth offer minor admonition, thunder and lightning grow slightly urgent in tone; when they offer great admonition, people engage in widespread corruption and evil, causing thunderbolts to strike repeatedly. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen officials and commoners offer minor admonition, their countenances change; when they offer great admonition, they harm and injure one another. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will thereby fade and perish.\n\nWhen Heaven, Earth, the six directions, and the eight limits all offer great admonition together, they seek to rectify the patterns of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, making Heaven’s clarity manifest, and the great auspicious signs of the world appear in written form to admonish and rectify the ruler. All under Heaven respond in unison. If their admonitions are unheeded, they will fade and perish.\n\nThe cyclic meetings of the Dao of Heaven must be employed and followed in proper sequence.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity, upon witnessing events, would always ponder and reflect upon their meaning, never daring to be negligent even in the slightest. By perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, they never lost the will of August Heaven. Therefore, they preserved their bodies, secured their dwellings, knew no sorrow or peril, and no misfortune could befall them. In their calculations and assessments, they truly aligned with the intent of Heaven.\n\nExcellent, excellent! This foolish student now understands.\"\n\nNow that the Illustrious Heavenly Master has expounded the method, I wish to understand the reasons behind its fading and perishing—pray, elucidate this.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Such is the sincerity of your heart.\n\nYet the Dao of Heaven aids those who are teachable, aids the utmost sincere, aids the reverent and compliant, aids the readily enlightened, aids the easily admonished. It seeks to enrich the ruler, hence it instructs him. If it does not seek his enrichment, it will not deign to instruct him.\n\nIts manifestations are akin to how, when people share deep intimacy, they teach and guide one another in affairs. If their bond is not profoundly close, they will not teach or guide. Should one instruct and not be heeded, should one’s timely counsel be disregarded, then it will be abandoned and set aside, never again to be earnestly taught or shown.\n\nThereupon, calamities and omens arise, and Heaven no longer reveals its admonitions to mankind. In such a state, even the sagely and wise become as though deaf and blind, devoid of understanding. Their clarity and insight obstructed, the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth will no longer correct them.\n\nDisasters and anomalies daily increase, unremoved; mankind daily declines and perishes, losing its proper office. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity, from dawn to dusk, remained composed yet deeply reflective, never daring to lose the will of Heaven. Therefore, they served August Heaven as a father, August Earth as a mother, the sun as an elder brother, the moon as an elder sister. They rectified Heaven’s fatherly role, safeguarded the Five Phases, followed the Four Seasons, observed their advances and retreats, and thereby illuminated and corrected their own conduct. Thus did they profoundly comprehend Heaven’s gains and losses.\n\nOnly when Heaven and Earth adhere to the essential Dao, taking the responsive charts and texts of the Celestial Mandate as their great charge, do all their actions attain responses as though divine—this alone is to deeply grasp the intent of Heaven. It is like aligning a double mirror with the carpenter’s square, speaking face to face.\n\nTherefore, the numinous spirits are stirred by such alignment. But if one resists and refuses to heed their corrective counsel, then Heaven and Earth become inverted and disordered, the Five Phases and Four Seasons fall into chaos and rebellion, losing their proper principles. Thus, all undertakings miss their mark, and great misfortune ensues—this is what is meant.\n\nDo you now understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the nature of Heaven and Earth is such that the lower rectifies and admonishes the upper, just as the upper rectifies and admonishes the lower. Each possesses strengths and shortcomings, and by mutually compensating for these, the myriad affairs of the Dao of Heaven all find their proper place.\n\nTherefore, though August Heaven is numinous and sagely, it has its shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of Earth. Thus, the myriad things receive their mandate from Heaven yet nourish their forms upon Earth. The Three Luminaries have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of fire. Though the Three Luminaries are numinous and bright, they cannot illuminate the depths of inner chambers, whereas fire shines within them. The greatest sages have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of the worthy. Humanity has its shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of the myriad things.\n\nThus, when admonition extends even to the lowest and most minute, the Dao is not lost, and the heart-mind of Heaven is attained. Therefore, Heaven generates all affairs, causing their seasons to undergo transformation and reform, all to admonish and correct the lord of men, thereby manifesting the signs of utmost virtue. One cannot but be greatly cautious in this.\n\nThe transformations and reforms of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—these are their admonitions.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nSince the August Celestial Master has now made this clear, I wish to apply it to humanity.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nYou must carefully heed my words and ponder them deeply.\n\nWhen a minister possesses loyalty, goodness, sincerity, and trustworthiness, and admonishes and corrects his superior, yet the lord does not heed and employ him, but instead seeks to harm him, the minister is alarmed. Thereupon, he ties his tongue and becomes mute; the six directions close off and do not communicate. The worthy and learned, fearing trouble, thus conceal themselves; loyalty and trustworthiness lie hidden; the true Dao cannot be seen. Though the lord may be sagely and worthy, he hears nothing, and thus becomes deaf and blind, unable to perceive anything extraordinary. Day by day, darkness and obscurity prevail; the lord is deaf, the ministers are mute. Such calamity cannot be restrained. When ministers are benighted and the lord is blind, treachery and villainy run rampant. When ministers are mute and the lord is deaf, the world is cut off; good and evil are not distinguished. Heavenly disasters converge; the Six Extremities wage war; the world is wholly inauspicious. Can one not be cautious in this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity took omens, disasters, and prodigies with utmost gravity, using them to align and correct themselves. Therefore, in ten thousand cases, they did not err even once. In truth, this was because they acted in accord with the essential texts and the great Dao, exhausting their loyalty without further misfortune.\n\nYou must take these warnings to heart and carefully heed my words.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYet the loftiness and clarity of Heaven are not the achievement of a single essence’s virtue and power. When the emperor-king governs in accord with the heart-mind of Heaven, it is not the achievement of a single worthy minister. Now, my words merely raise the guiding principles to reveal the beginning. All affairs cannot be exhaustively recorded and explained; you must deeply ponder their intent yourself.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now. How could such discourse ever end? There is nothing more to ask.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**Right: The Heavenly Admonitions and Correct Writings, Concluded**\n\n*Great Peace Scripture, Scroll 43, Ends*\n*Great Peace Scripture, Scroll 44: \"Examining the Writings on the Methods of Punishment and Virtue, Section Sixty\"*\n\nThe Perfected One, in utmost reverence and caution, prostrates and respectfully bows. What I now ask will surely incur profound reproach. Yet when I reflect upon the words written by my returned teacher, all is correct—nothing can be altered.\n\nBut this humble disciple, dull and benighted, remains bound in melancholy, unable to discern from whence the August Heavenly Spirit-Person derived these models and laws.\n\nNow, I marvel at the master’s accumulated wisdom, vast and unspoken. I beseech the master, in compassion, to reveal the celestial proofs of the yin-yang secrets and the essential divinations of the gods and spirits.\n\nAt present, my thoughts are in turmoil, my heart greatly disturbed. What I say must surely transgress the master’s taboos. Yet though I long to speak, I cannot restrain myself. Even if the Heavenly Master reproves me, I pray for the enlightening methods of celestial verification to be shown, so they may be transmitted for ten thousand generations, radiant and unquestioned—like the brightness of the sun at noon—unchanging from beginning to end, never to be abandoned.\n\nYet, do you truly still not believe my words?\nYou remain as one who has not yet fully awakened, who does not comprehend the heart-mind of Heaven.\nAre you not still foolish? You differ little from the common people.\nTo oppose my words is to invite chaos; to defy them is to court ruin.\n\nWhat I now say to you has all been examined and verified against the celestial patterns, aligned with the great secrets of yin and yang before being spoken.\nYou come to inquire of Heaven’s affairs; I transmit Heaven’s words and establish its laws—not daring to utter empty, false, or flattering speech.\n\nYou have lived through many years and days—how is it you have not observed the teeming myriad creatures, all of which dwell in accord with virtue while shunning the qi of punishment?\nThis is the luminous and essential proof of August Heaven.\nIt is the manifest evidence by which the governance of the ruler is measured in success or failure.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nIf you are now awakening yet still not fully awakened, I wish to further question your teachings and admonitions.\n\nNow, punishment and virtue are the clear manifestations of the divine governance of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang—the standards for the myriad creatures and the people.\n\nThus, in the eleventh month, great virtue resides in the *nine-one*, dwelling beneath the earth. The season of virtue is within the chamber, so there is qi within, and the myriad things return to it. The season of punishment is in the *six-four*, in the distant wilds, so there is no qi without, and it is clear and empty. The outer world is void of things, and the multitudes all return, following the king’s virtue into the Yellow Springs below.\n\nIn the twelfth month, virtue is in the *nine-two*. The season is in *chou*, dwelling in the center of the earth, not yet emerged. The season of virtue is in the Bright Hall, and the myriad things follow virtue upward, yet dare not emerge to be seen, for punishment is above.\n\nIn the first month, *yin*, virtue is in the *nine-three*. The myriad things, without exception, follow the flourishing virtue and delight in its abundance, being born between Heaven and Earth. The season of virtue resides in the courtyard.\n\nIn the second month, virtue is in the *nine-four*, in *mao*. It has departed from the earth but not yet reached Heaven, lingering at the boundary. Virtue is at the gate, so the myriad things all delight in emerging to peer through the gate.\n\nIn the third month, flourishing virtue is in the *nine-five*. In *chen*, it reaches the center of Heaven. The season of flourishing virtue is in the outer roadways, so the myriad things all emerge to dwell without.\n\nIn the fourth month, *si*, virtue is in the *nine-six*, extending to the six distant and eight borderlands. Flourishing virtue pervades the eight directions; good qi and yang qi respond and generate one another. The teeming creatures depart from the inner chambers to dwell in the wilds. The season of punishment is at the roots of the myriad things, residing within the inner chamber, so below is empty and without things, while above is lush and flourishing. None fail to delight in following virtue to govern. This is the great and luminous proof of governance through virtue.\n\nNow that I have reverently heard of the use of virtue, I wish to hear of the use of punishment.\n\nThus, in the fifth month, punishment is in the *six-one*, in *wu*, beneath the earth. Below and within, it is clear and without qi; the earth below is empty. The season of punishment is within the chamber, so there is nothing within, and all dwell without.\n\nIn the sixth month, punishment resides in the *six-two*, in *wei*, dwelling in the center of the earth, not yet emerged. The season of punishment is in the hall. The qi of punishment is within; the qi of virtue is without. The teeming creatures, without exception, delight in baring themselves and returning to the one of flourishing virtue.\n\nIn the seventh month, punishment is in the *six-three*. The season is in *shen*; punishment is in the courtyard. The myriad things dare not enter and firmly delight in dwelling without.\n\nIn the eighth month, punishment is in the *six-four*, in *you*. It has not yet reached the boundary of Heaven. The season of virtue is at the gate, and the myriad things all delight in gathering at the gate, rejoicing in entering and following virtue to return.\n\nIn the ninth month, punishment is in the *six-five*, in *xu*. It reaches the center of Heaven. The season of punishment is in the roadways, and the myriad things, without exception, are on the verge of death and distress, following virtue to conceal themselves. Thus, within, things daily flourish, while without, all is empty and perishing.\n\nIn the tenth month, punishment is in the *six-six*, in *hai*. Punishment extends to the six distant and eight borderlands and the four wilds. The teeming creatures, without exception, conceal themselves and flee, following virtue to the Bright Hall. Crawling creatures carry their young within; the wilds without are empty of multitudes. Is this not the consequence of those who delight in employing punishment, driving away the perverse?\n\nYet if the heart-mind desires to harbor punishment within to govern the multitudes, it will daily diminish them.\n\nThus, in the fifth month, harboring one punishment within causes one group of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the sixth month, harboring two punishments within causes two groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the seventh month, harboring three punishments within causes three groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the eighth month, harboring four punishments within causes four groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the ninth month, harboring five punishments within causes five groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the tenth month, harboring six punishments within causes six groups of multitudes to rebel.\nThus, without, all is void of things, and all flee within. This is the clear proof and evidence.\n\nTherefore, those who govern with punishment are outwardly respectful yet inwardly rebellious, so the multitudes daily diminish.\n\nThus, in the eleventh month, harboring one virtue within causes one group of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the twelfth month, harboring two virtues within causes two groups of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the first month, harboring three virtues within causes three groups of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the second month, harboring four virtues within causes multitudes from the four directions to enter and follow.\nIn the third month, harboring five yang virtues within causes five groups of worthy multitudes to enter and follow.\n\nIn the fourth month, harboring six virtues within causes the myriad things to emerge and appear together, all bustling without exception, both within and without submitting to it. This is the clear proof of Heaven’s law.\n\nIn the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched, so in the second month, half of the things are harmed by cold, and in the eighth month, half of the things are likewise harmed by cold. At the time of the second month, virtue desires to lead its multitudes forth through the gate, while punishment desires to draw its multitudes back within the gate, both standing at the boundary. Thus, in the second and eighth months, the myriad things encounter virtue and punishment in equal measure, life and death balanced, and so half are harmed.\n\nYou now delight in knowing the constant laws of Heaven and Earth, the clear proofs of yin and yang—this is precisely it. Punishment daily harms and kills, and though the people dread it, they cannot be made to yield their strength; instead, they say there are no people. Virtue daily unfolds and grows, without punishment or fear, yet the myriad things submit and surrender, all coming to assist the king in governance. This is the clear proof of Heaven, evident and beyond doubt.\n\nNow, if people cannot be governed without awe and fear, what is to be done? Yet the sages and noble men of antiquity ruled others through the Dao and virtue, not through physical force or punishment. Those who take no joy in goodness and whose virtue is weak instead seek to govern through the threat of punishment—yet they only see their people depart.\n\nPunishment can only be used to relieve distress and resolve entanglements; it is not sufficient to give life to the myriad things. Clearly, the bustling multitudes belong to virtue as their leader. Now, if people do not submit inwardly but instead deceive and betray, the great fault lies here.\n\nYou have come repeatedly over time to study and ask about many matters, accumulating much written knowledge, yet you have not yet fully trusted my words. Have you now gained some understanding?\n\nChun prostrates himself in reverence, bowing deeply. My transgressions are grave, and I have failed the teachings of my enlightened teacher and divine person. Inwardly ashamed, I sweat with remorse. Though my virtue is meager and my station low, and though I have studied for many days, my heart remains dull and cannot fully grasp the words of my enlightened teacher. Thus, I dare not refrain from asking again and again—greatly lacking in humility, I have long caused you, my teacher, concern. It is only that my learning remains unrefined. You must be cautious.\n\nHeaven hangs forth its signs and establishes its laws for humankind, setting forth teachings and commands for emperors and kings to follow in governance, not erring even once. If you wish to understand its meaning, this is precisely it.\n\nYet governance is not limited to this single method. If Heaven is constantly vexed and resentful, disasters will abound. You must take heed.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to raise something up, it takes its model from virtue; when it is about to bring decline and ruin, it follows the pattern of punishment. This is what is meant.\n\nMy words carefully align with the rules of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, following the principles of Heaven and Earth. I speak as Heaven’s clear voice, setting forth teachings and commands to instruct you. My words are like the tip of an arrow—no different. Follow them, and you will daily prosper; oppose them, and you will bring ruin upon yourself.\n\nHeaven’s law is divine—how divine! Thus, the divine persons, true persons, and great sages of antiquity, who were able to establish profound systems of law and create standards for emperors and kings, all perceived the essential patterns of Heaven’s signs. They alone inwardly understood the meaning of yin and yang, and only then did they follow Heaven and Earth in governance, aligning their hearts with the divine and observing what could be done. Thus, in their governance, they did not err even once.\n\nNow, foolish officials and common people believe Heaven’s laws can be recklessly violated, acting wantonly without regard for standards. Thus, they bring great disorder to their ruler’s governance—the great fault lies here.\n\nNow that you have received this book, why do you not carefully ponder it in your heart, reflect upon it earnestly, and contemplate it in a quiet chamber? Meditate on Heaven’s ways, and only then can you transmit Heaven’s teachings, instructing the ignorant and assisting the emperor and king in establishing laws.\n\nWhen considering the use of punishment, you must deeply reflect on where punishment resides: all who follow it depart, leaving it solitary and without multitudes. Thus, in winter, punishment lies in the four wilds, with no people, and the myriad things all rebel, hiding within to avoid it. In summer, punishment lies within, and the myriad things all emerge to submit to virtue, leaving the underground chambers and inner rooms empty. Punishment remains solitary, while all follow virtue to the wilds.\n\nWhen virtue is outside, the myriad things submit to the outside; when virtue is in secluded emptiness, things submit within. Heaven’s punishment is of utmost severity, and though it may suppress and subdue the people and the myriad things, why then can it not restrain its multitudes? Is this not strange?\n\nPunishment must not be lightly or recklessly used. Harm one upright qi, and Heaven’s qi is thrown into chaos; harm one compliant qi, and Earth’s qi is thrown into rebellion. Harm one scholar, and all scholars vanish; harm one worthy person, and all worthy people hide. Every matter will be shaken.\n\nThus, the sages, sage kings, and divine rulers of antiquity deeply perceived these warnings from Heaven and feared them, not daring to act recklessly. They feared losing Heaven’s favor and being unable to secure their own well-being. Those of supreme imperial virtue alone penetrated the clear proofs of the Dao and virtue. Without oppression or intimidation, the multitudes submitted to them and followed them. Thus, they guarded the Dao to preserve themselves and upheld virtue without daring to lose it.\n\nYou must recite and study my book, and if your heart has doubts, always keep this scroll close at hand, reviewing it day and night as a clear warning and proof. Only then will you grasp Heaven’s intent. To oppose this is to oppose Heaven itself.\n\nThis is like the reversal of qian and kun in the *Yi*—it cannot be done. It is like the movement of the Six Jia—it cannot be altered. It is like the fixed laws of the Five Phases—they cannot be lost. It is like the brightness of the sun and moon—it cannot be obscured. It is like the ruler above and the minister below—their order cannot be disrupted. This is how the governance of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, is made clear. There are those who delight in practicing virtue, and there are foolish people who instead delight in punishment. You should constantly observe this book to dispel confusion, striving to teach people to be good scholars, to uphold the Dao and virtue, and to set aside punishment.\n\nMy book repeatedly sets forth Heaven’s laws. Is practicing the Dao and virtue easy? Is practicing punishment and penalties difficult?\n\nTo love is to see daily increase; to intimidate is to see daily decline. Your illness has departed—go forth and transmit my book for Heaven, without doubt. My book’s words bear no debt to the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the Six Directions.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. I shall return and reflect on my faults, considering only the order of above and below, never daring to lose even one part.\"\n\nGo, be vigilant and cautious. If you cannot distinguish and ponder deeply the intent of my book, simply observe the great workings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. From the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, virtue resides without, and all things emerge to follow the King outward—creeping creatures leave their burrows, and people depart their chambers. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, virtue resides within, and all things return to follow the King inward—burrowing creatures retreat into their dens, and people return to their homes. This is the clear effect of governance by virtue.\n\nFrom the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, punishment governs within, and all things follow their emergence outward, leaving the interior empty and still. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, punishment governs without, and outside, there are no creatures, no qi, no people—all enter to follow virtue. This is the proof that punishment cannot be used for governance.\n\nThus, virtue aligns its heart and power with Heaven: when yang emerges, it emerges; when yang withdraws, it withdraws. Punishment aligns its power and heart with Earth: when yin emerges, it emerges; when yin withdraws, it withdraws. Virtue shares its power with the qi of life: when the life qi emerges, it emerges; when it withdraws, it withdraws. Punishment shares its power with the qi of killing: when the killing qi emerges, it emerges; when it withdraws, it withdraws. Virtue ranks alongside the movements of Heaven above; punishment ranks alongside the movements of Earth below. Virtue always dwells with the substantial; punishment always dwells with emptiness and nothingness. Virtue always dwells with flourishing: when flourishing is without, it emerges; when flourishing is within, it withdraws—thus it withdraws in winter and emerges in summer. Punishment dwells with decline and the qi of death: thus it emerges in winter and withdraws in summer. The qi of death is clear, and so wherever it resides, clarity prevails.\n\nThus, virtue shares its qi with the Emperor and King: when the King rules without, yin emerges; when the King rules within, punishment withdraws. Punishment shares its position with petty men, and so wherever it resides, there are no people. What things return to is the accumulation of the Emperor and King’s virtue, which is always seen to return—thus they are called Emperor and King. Punishment has never dwelled with things, nor with people, and so it cannot be called a noble ruler.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity pondered deeply, observing the workings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, taking them as their teachers and models. Knowing that in their great... not a single part could be lost, they dared not transgress them. This is the clear proof of Heaven and Earth’s order—can one not consider it carefully? Can one not be cautious?\n\nThis is the natural law, not dependent on any particular person. It is the constant movement of Heaven and Earth, and now I have fully revealed it to you. You should repeatedly reflect deeply on its meaning and act without carelessness.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. I dare not fail.\"\n\nGo. I have now fully transmitted the true teachings to you, and my worries are resolved. Remove Heaven’s faults, act with utmost virtue, and restore the King’s flourishing. Do not dare to sever this transmission, lest you suffer its harm.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nHerein lies the examination of Heaven’s laws to clarify the successes and failures of governance from ancient times to the present.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Four, concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Five.\n\nHere begins *The Formula for Unearthing Scriptures*, Scroll Sixty-One.\n\nThe lowly and ignorant, unable to restrain the desires of their hearts, have presumptuously transgressed the taboos of the Heavenly Master, committing grievous faults. Yet their intended words cannot be stilled; the petty person, unable to endure, feels their five viscera churn with vexation and constraint.\n\nI beg to ask one great doubt: since the Heavenly Master treats me with the tenderness due a newborn child, you must surely pity my hunger and thirst for knowledge. Why then be so reserved in expounding the Dao?\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow the Heavenly Master, in concert with the August Heaven and Sacred Earth, unites spirit and thought, his heart in profound accord with the will of Heaven and Earth—like nested compasses or aligned squares, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Knowing the constant concerns of Heaven and Earth, how could this lowly one, unworthy of life, dare to advance and pose these questions, overcome with shame? Yet I wish to know: what are the great taboos of Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits?\n\n\"Excellent! Your devotion grows ever more earnest. You may now ask, for your question aligns precisely with the heart and mind of Heaven and Earth. Once known to humanity, it will lodge in the hearts of the worthy and never depart for ten thousand generations. I have long wished to speak of this, but had none to address. Now that a true person asks, my heart rejoices in this revelation. I shall explain it to you in full, hiding nothing. The reason is this: I fear that the divine spirits of Heaven and Earth deeply abhor such matters, and if I conceal them, I would bring great calamity upon myself. True person, sit calmly and listen clearly.\n\nWhat do Heaven and Earth most bitterly detest? They despise disobedience and lack of filial piety. What does this mean? I wish to hear it.\"\n\n\"Excellent is your inquiry. Within the harmony of Heaven and Earth, there are three qi that, though distinct, unite as one household to govern and nurture all things. Heaven presides over generation and is called Father. Earth presides over nourishment and is called Mother. Humanity presides over governance and is called Child. The Father should instruct and regulate with timely measures; the Mother follows the Father’s actions to nurture. The Child, born by the Father’s mandate and fed by the Mother’s sustenance, ought to revere the Father and love the Mother. Why is this so?\n\nThe Father’s teachings have their proper measures and seasons. Thus, Heaven instructs through the four seasons to generate, nurture, and bring all things to completion, each in its appointed time. When the wicked defy this, it is as if the Child disobeys the Father. Heaven’s qi loses its governance, and its will is thwarted. Heaven then deeply abhors such people and sends down calamities and anomalies to afflict its Child. It is like a household where the father, enraged, disciplines his child—the transformation occurs at once.\n\nWhen father and child are at odds, and the father resents the child’s defiance of his stern teachings, yin overcomes yang, the inferior deceives the superior, and many rebellious children arise. Ministers neglect their duties, malevolent spirits flourish, and together they sicken humanity. The cunning and deceitful lurk by the wayside, while all manner of yin forces, lurking and disobedient, bring blame upon those who defy Heaven and Earth. True person, how could you not obey this?\n\nThis is the natural defense, like a shadow following form or a trailing horse never parting—heed this warning.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow I have reverently received the Heavenly Master’s teachings and the instructions of Heaven. I wish to hear of the prohibitions against transgressing Earth.\n\n\"Very well, true person, listen clearly.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"The heavens are the father, the earth is the mother—both are akin to humanity, so how are they different? The heavens are the heavens, the earth is the heavens; father and mother are merely distinguished by yin and yang, male and female, yet their likes and dislikes are the same. The heavens nourish human life, the earth nourishes human form. Yet humanity is profoundly foolish, benighted, and ignorant, failing to honor and revere its father and mother. Thus, the heavens and earth bring forth ordinary people, filled with regret and unresolved sorrow.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nExcellent is your question! You have deeply grasped the intent of Heaven and Earth. Great disasters will cease, and humanity will surely prosper.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nLet the Heavenly Master explain it clearly.\n\nNow, the people of the world all harm and betray their father and mother.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe four seasons and the qi of Heaven follow the course set by Heaven. To defy them is to harm one’s father.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nPeople regard the earth as their mother, from whom they receive clothing and sustenance. Yet instead of cherishing and benefiting her, they turn to harming and betraying her.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nNow, true person, listen clearly.\"\n\nPeople are utterly lawless, jointly boring and digging into the earth, greatly undertaking earthworks without regard for the Dao. Those who dig deep reach the Yellow Springs below; those who dig shallow go down several *zhang*. Within, the Mother alone grieves in fury. Her many children are grossly unfilial, constantly suffering from boundless resentment and unresolved sorrow, yet unable to make their voices heard.\n\nIn ancient times, the sages’ timely influence did not extend to their Way, allowing the people to act recklessly, claiming the earth felt no pain. But within, the earth alone suffers grievously without measure. This rises to move Heaven, yet people remain unaware. The Mother, distressed by her children’s inability to restrain themselves, appeals to the Father on high against humanity. Her grievances accumulate over time, piling up again and again, until the Father’s wrath knows no end. Disasters and anomalies of every kind arise together. The Mother, likewise displeased, remains perpetually angry and refuses to nourish the people and the myriad things with her power.\n\nWhen both Father and Mother are displeased, the myriad things and the people perish—all for want of the Dao. The conduct of later generations grows daily worse, failing to accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth. Instead, they resent Heaven and Earth, their words discordant. They further resent their emperors and kings, claiming they cannot govern justly within their domains. Each person commits transgressions against Heaven and Earth yet remains unaware, instead shifting blame onto their superiors. Thus, Heaven and Earth no longer love humanity.\n\nThey watch people die in an instant. Though the afflicted cry out their sins in clear terms as death approaches, Heaven and Earth, their Father and Mother, no longer save them. The fault lies in their profound and deep transgressions, their exhaustion under the weight of blame—all of which rests squarely upon themselves.\n\nThe conduct of later generations grows ever more extreme, surpassing what came before. They imitate one another, making this the norm, no longer restrained or mutually prohibiting such acts. Thus, disasters multiply daily, and they truly incur the resentment of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the Father and Mother of humanity. Yet their children jointly harm them, wounding and afflicting them—this is no minor sin. Therefore, Heaven and Earth hold the greatest grudge against disobedience and unfilial conduct, refusing to pardon it.\n\nThough people’s lives are short and countless die, they have no cause for complaint.\n\nTrue Person, do you understand this?\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, since Heaven has sent you to ask these questions in full, you know that I can speak. True Person, you must not take this lightly—you must be cautious indeed.\nYes, yes.\n\nToday, people jointly harm their Father and Mother, defying Their decrees. In your view, True Person, can such beings be long sustained?\nThus, Heaven does not greatly pity them.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master pities the foolish and living, and so explains this fully: how do we know that Heaven and Earth are perpetually aggrieved and resentful, detesting how people so frequently disturb the earth?\n\nExcellent.\nHeaven has sent you, bending your steps to ask this—it is clear you come as Heaven’s messenger to pose this question.\n\nVery well. I deeply revere Heaven and dare not conceal anything, for I fear bringing disaster upon myself. Now, I shall make this plain for you to know, to inscribe it forever in your heart and never forget.\n\nConsider this: when one household undertakes construction, disturbing the earth, several households suffer its ill effects—some meet death, others attract bandits, officials, or lawsuits; some face warfare, strife, or harm from snakes, wasps, tigers, wolves, and vicious birds. Major earthworks bring major misfortune; minor disturbances bring lesser calamities. This is the earth’s resentment manifesting, causing spirits to generate such disasters.\n\nThus, when many people fall ill, this is clear proof. Do you understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, some who disturb the earth encounter no harm—why is this?\n\nExcellent question.\nIn truth, all such acts bring harm. But those who encounter favorable earth do not immediately fall ill. Instead, the misfortune often befalls others in the four directions, and in time, it will still reach them. Those who disturb malevolent earth cannot bear what they have done—they bring harm at once.\n\nWhy does this harm extend to distant places as well?\nIt is like a person of good and kind nature: though wronged, they endure for a time, though the grievance remains in their heart. Later, the harm will come. The wicked cannot endure even for a moment—they act at once.\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\nNow, the earth’s body is vast, while humans, in comparison, are minuscule—so small as to be negligible. How then can their actions harm the earth?\n\nExcellent challenge indeed.\nHeaven has left you unclear in your distinctions—how do I know this?\nBy the restless urgency in your words.\nYou now feel constrained in your heart, longing to speak your mind to find relief.\nThe divine spirits of heaven and earth dwell within your belly, listening with reverence to your words, though you remain unaware.\nAll that humans desire to do is ordained by Heaven.\n\nYes, I dare not conceal anything.\nYou possess luminous virtue.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\nNow, you claim that humans, being so small, cannot harm the earth through their actions.\nConsider this: a grown man may stand ten feet tall, his girth spanning ten armspans, yet a tiny cavity-dwelling worm in his tooth—so small as to be negligible—may still afflict him. When the pain strikes, the man wails in agony, and in time, his teeth may rot and fall out entirely. Compared to heaven and earth, humans are no larger than such worms that harm a man.\nTeeth are among the hardest parts of the body, stronger than metal or stone. Yet these worms, mere flesh, can still bring such suffering—how much more can humans harm the earth? Do you understand now?\n\nProceed, Perfected One, and further illuminate this for me.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nConsider this: a man may stand over ten feet tall, his body spanning ten armspans, yet a boil-causing worm no longer than an inch—so small as to be negligible—dwells within his skin. Day and night, it bores into him, and the man falls ill, even to the point of death.\nThe disparity between humans and the earth is just like this.\nThough the worm is tiny, why does it still destroy the man?\nPerfected One, why do you persist in such profound ignorance? Are you no different from the common folk?\n\nTruly, I fall short.\nIf even you fall short, what can be said of ordinary people?\nI have erred in my foolishness. I only wish to hear of my shortcomings from the Heavenly Master, that you might fully explain this to one as dull as I.\n\nVery well, I shall not conceal it.\nI know the severity of the earth’s afflictions, which is why I speak to you thus.\nNow, let me tell you another matter, that you may perceive it with even greater clarity.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, a mighty man of great strength can restrain even scabies mites—such tiny things are beneath notice. Yet if a single dou of creatures were to feed upon a man together, his sickness and pain would leave him unable to lie down, and in severe cases, bedridden. Now, scabies mites and fleas, though small, when gathered in great numbers and feeding together upon a man, each and every one of them kills him. Scabies mites and fleas alike cause a man vexation and restlessness, preventing him from sitting at ease, and all give rise to sores and ulcers. The disparity between humans and the earth is just like this—do you comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nVery well. Perhaps you find what I have said insufficient to serve as a model, so now I shall explain it to you. Though humans are small, their grievances and sorrows toward the earth’s form make it abundantly clear to them that they bear deep fault and blame, which can be seen at once.\n\nNow, a single large *li* contains a hundred households and a hundred wells; a single township, a thousand households and a thousand wells; a single county, ten thousand households and ten thousand wells; a single commandery, a hundred thousand households and a hundred thousand wells; a single province, a hundred million households and a hundred million wells. A large well measures one *zhang*, a medium well several *chi*, and a small well three *chi*. Now, if one were to bore through the earth down to the Yellow Springs, how many such wells would the world contain? Some households have several wells, but let us calculate only by small wells: ten wells extend three *zhang*, a hundred wells thirty *zhang*, a thousand wells three hundred *zhang*, ten thousand wells three thousand *zhang*, and a hundred thousand wells thirty thousand *zhang*. How many wells in the world are like this in total? Boring into the earth, one finds water everywhere—water is the earth’s blood and vessels. Now, if one were to bore into your body and reach its blood and vessels, would the illness not be severe?\n\nNow, how many *li* in breadth and length would a hundred million wells occupy? Calculate this yourself—how many hundred million wells does the world contain? Thus, the grievance humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is already clear. You harm and sicken your mother, causing grave illness. The earth’s *qi* leaks and dissipates, its affliction profound, yet people neither cherish nor pity it. Instead, they complain, “Why are Heaven and Earth not perfectly harmonious?” Is this not perverse?\n\nThis is only considering the wells. Now, how many great mounds, hills, and tombs exist in the world? How many mountains and hills have been excavated for metals and stones, for kiln-fired tiles and erected pillars? How many reckless diggings and cuttings, how many blockages and obstructions where passage should be open? How many such instances are there? Now, these springs and waterways—some should flow, some should be open—yet how many have been blocked or bored through? When springs and waterways should flow freely, their benefit spreads, following the earth’s natural channels from high to low. Yet now, some act otherwise, recklessly boring into the earth’s form, creating sores and ulcers, or blocking and severing what should be open. When royal governance is disharmonious, the earth suffers grave illness, yet none speak of its pain and distress. The earth’s spirit cries out to Heaven without cease, its grievance unending. Heaven and Earth thus grow displeased together, and so the Great Harmony and pure *qi* become difficult to attain—Perfected One, do you comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, humans live between Heaven and Earth and must have dwellings to shelter themselves and wells to drink from—how could it be otherwise?\n\nExcellent is your question. Heaven does not resent humans having dwellings, but when they bore too deeply into the earth, they create sores and ulcers. Sometimes they reach the earth’s bones, sometimes its blood—what does this mean? Springs are the earth’s blood, stones its bones, and fertile soil its flesh. Boring into deep springs is like drawing blood; breaking stones is like breaking bones. When fertile soil is deeply excavated and tiles, stones, and sturdy wood are embedded within, the earth’s strength is harmed. The earth alone suffers grievously—what is to be done now? The earth is the mother of the myriad things. Those who delight in and nurture it do not realize its weight. It is like a woman with child in her womb: if she follows the Way and does not recklessly bore into her own body, her mother remains unharmed. But if she recklessly bores into her mother while seeking life, her mother falls ill. If people do not recklessly bore deeply into the earth but merely dwell upon its surface, just enough to shelter themselves, the earth does not suffer. Great is the love for humans that brings them good fortune. Now, I wish to hear how much excavation is permissible for shelter.\n\nGenerally, when moving earth, one should not penetrate deeper than three *chi*, merely raising the surface. Why is three *chi* the standard? The first *chi* is where sunlight reaches, and its *qi* belongs to Heaven. The second *chi* is where things grow, and its *qi* belongs to the harmonious center. The third *chi* reaches the earth’s body, and its *qi* is yin. Beyond this, one harms the earth’s form, and all becomes inauspicious.\n\nWhat of the ancients who dwelled in caves?\n\nThey too harmed the earth’s form. Most settled in mountain valleys, carving out grottoes and relying on the terrain, using few wooden beams or pillars in the earth. With fewer pillars in the ground and often near flowing water, their harm to the earth was slight, and thus they suffered little illness. Later generations, unaware of their error, recklessly harmed the earth deeply, and so many did not live long. Why? This is grave illness.\n\nNow, even those who live near flowing water and do not dig wells often fall ill and do not live long. Why? Heaven and Earth are already angered, and their neighbors bear the burden together, like a family’s transgression affecting its brothers. Now, some people do not move earth or build but merely occupy old dwellings, yet still encounter misfortune. Why? Their conduct is inauspicious, offending the spirits.\n\nWhat spirits?\n\nSpirits are not one, and their names cannot be foretold. Perfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, people living upon the earth do not strive to teach one another goodness, and so their actions and transgressions rebound upon each other. This is grievance.\n\nNow, some live far from flowing water and must dig wells to drink and live—what is to be done?\n\nExcellent is your question. Where old wells exist, it is fitting to share them together and drink from them. Be careful not to change them frequently.\n\nHaving changed the well, it is fitting to fill the old one, sealing the earth’s qi so it does not dissipate, lest the land’s form be consumed and the earth weakened, unable to nourish things.\n\nTo fill and seal the old well—what does it mean to remove the “central strength”?\n\nIt refers to the well’s bricks, stones, timbers, and wood. These were not originally present, yet now they exist, like an abnormal growth in the human body causing illness.\n\nHow profound! How profound!\n\nYou do not yet match the Heavenly Master in thorough inquiry—there is more to know than this.\n\nPerfected One, come forward.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYou ask about matters of constant concern—why do you probe so deeply?\n\nThe reason for such detail is this: when I meet with the Heavenly Master, we speak of human destiny lying within Heaven and Earth. Only when Heaven and Earth are perpetually joyful can the Great Peace be achieved, with longevity following thereafter. Thus, dwelling between Heaven and Earth, I am ever fearful of offending them, and so I strive diligently.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth are not in harmony, I will not live out my years.\n\nExcellent are your words.\n\nThe reason for my constant fear is this: I see Heaven and Earth’s toxic qi accumulating in great abundance, with harm and killing unceasing. The emperors and kings are sorrowful and distressed, their governance uneven, and so I constantly share in their worries.\n\nWhy do you involve yourself in aiding the ruler’s concerns?\n\nI have heard that accumulating merit among people brings recompense from Heaven. Thus, I always delight in aligning with Heaven’s will.\n\nExcellent is your intent.\n\nNow that the Heavenly Master has enlightened this foolish student, revealing Heaven’s taboos, I humbly beg to ask one further doubt.\n\nWhen building chambers and huts in low-lying fields near rivers and seas, where no pillars or beams are used, and water is struck at a depth of three feet—what is to be done?\n\nExcellent is your question.\n\nThis, too, is harmful. It is fitting to dig shallower.\n\nThis is but the thin skin of the earth, close to its meridian channels. Should you wish to know its effect, consider a person: one with thick skin is difficult to draw blood from, yet once blood is drawn, it is still an injury. One with thin skin is easily bled, and though the blood flows readily, it is likewise an injury—both are harm. For blood is the solemn token of Heaven and Earth’s covenant.\n\nHe who wounds another does not distinguish between thick or thin skin. The sight of blood makes the transgression plain. Man is the image of Heaven and Earth; neither desires to see injury. When injured, they grow wrathful—why then would the earth alone delight in being wounded? Heaven and Earth are the true root of man, the father and mother of yin and yang. How could you presume to harm your own parents?\n\nYou, Perfected One, ought to ponder this deeply in your heart. Foolish men may treat it lightly, careless and unaware—this is a grave error. Now, you receive sustenance from your mother, and so men dig wells to drink. What great wrong is there in this? Yet your words have already strayed from the luminous will of Heaven.\n\nWhen a man drinks from his mother, he does so at the place where the spring emerges. A mother’s milk is the wellspring of man, the source from which she nourishes her child—just as the earth has water springs to sustain mankind. How then can you recklessly pierce her skin and drink her blood and fluids?\n\nYour question, Perfected One, is most ill-considered. This foolish student has erred and offended the Heavenly Master’s taboos. I have not been modest. Yet if difficult questions are not pressed to their utmost, the ultimate secrets of the Dao cannot be attained.\n\nI do not resent your words. It must be that Great Heaven is deeply displeased, and so has sent you to ask these questions again and again—this is why your speech has been so persistent and unyielding. Now, may the Heavenly Master forgive and absolve this transgression.\n\nThis foolish student wishes to speak but cannot restrain himself. Why should I be modest when walking the level path? Since you have wearied yourself coming from afar to inquire on behalf of Heaven and Earth, take care never to suppress or destroy my written words.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nIf people do not see this text, they will not know the weight of their transgressions. Instead, they constantly compound their offenses against Heaven and Earth. How can there be harmony? How can any disorder not remain unrectified? They do not realize that each person bears a debt to Heaven and Earth, passed down through generations. Those born later inherit the accumulated disasters, and the Mandate of Heaven is lost—life and death become boundless and uncertain.\n\nPerfected One, exert yourself. Do not let this text perish. Heaven and Earth will not be angered with you.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nIf the Perfected One incurs their punishment, it will be dire.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nTake this writing and entrust it to a ruler of virtue. It should be shown to all people, for man is the child of Heaven and Earth, the foremost of the ten thousand things. Now, what is to be done for their sake?\n\nLet each reflect deeply. From this day forward, if you desire wealth, longevity, and freedom from illness, ponder these words and inscribe them upon your heart. Each must consider their own well-being. Perfected One, do not conceal this—pass it on and speak of it to others.\n\nThe spirits of Heaven and Earth follow this text as it circulates, observing men’s words. Why? Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nHow do I know they follow men? Because my words are not false. If you suppress or conceal this text, illness will befall you. Those who dare to destroy it will meet misfortune—this is the clear proof that the spirits of Heaven and Earth watch over men.\n\nHow fearsome!\n\nUnderstood.\n\nGo forth and rouse yourselves, rouse yourselves again. The lives of men lie within Heaven and Earth—those who seek peace must first bring peace to their Heaven and Earth, only then may they attain lasting tranquility. Yet now, men turn and fret over Heaven and Earth, together harming their own parents—how can they hope for peace and good fortune?\n\nFor long have such deeds accumulated, and so calamities and omens never cease—my words are not in error. I have often seen the Earth spirits ascend to lodge their grievances, never ceasing. Thus, when you truly recognize their presence before you, as if repeatedly admonished and questioned, you will know they are Heaven’s envoys.\n\nPerfected One, you come to ask—this is Heaven’s wish to bring these matters to light, so that men may know for themselves. The common folk only blame Heaven, never reflecting deeply upon their own faults. Why now does Heaven suddenly prompt me to speak of this?\n\nIt is because the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Heavenly August One is about to arrive, and governance shall enter an era of Great Peace. Yet I fear the foolish people will persist in violating the taboos of Heaven and Earth, together disrupting the upright qi, bringing forth misfortune and harm. If this continues, the qi of Great Peace will not arrive in timely harmony. Thus, Heaven has sent you to ask these questions.\n\nIf you wish the people to cease their transgressions, then Heaven and Earth will be free of affliction and cherish mankind, allowing the five grains and the ten thousand things to flourish and nourish them. But if they neglect and resent this, refusing to cherish and sustain, then disaster will follow.\n\nIn years of famine, no good things arise; in years of prosperity, all things thrive—this is the principle. Perfected One, do you understand?\n\nExcellent, excellent! In ancient times, when Great Peace prevailed, why were the people not forbidden from disturbing the earth?\n\nWell asked, indeed! At the dawn of Heaven and Earth, there was nothing like the present age. How do I know this? Now, Heaven has fully risen, and so it gathers those entrusted with its qi—divine beings, perfected ones, immortals, Daoists, sages, and worthies—all shall emerge to assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Thus, this is an age unlike any before.\n\nSince the opening of yin and yang, Heaven has recorded its people for service, yet never has there been such a time as this—truly, it is the greatest of all. How astonishing! How astonishing!\n\nTherefore, the foremost Dao is now revealed, teaching the people of the world the methods of goodness. When men are good, governance is peaceful, and the lord of the land may wander in joy without care.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Joyous, joyous indeed! Thus, I urge the Perfected One to swiftly bring forth this text—take care not to conceal it. Show it to the common people, so that when they see the prohibitions, they may cease their transgressions. If they do not stop, calamity will extend to later generations, and there will be no salvation.\n\nTo offend Heaven and Earth is to leave no room for prayer. Perfected One, do you truly understand?\n\nAffirmative, affirmative.\n\nGo now, and if you have any doubts about what is written in the book, come and ask me.\" \"Affirmative, affirmative.\"\n\nHere ends the explanation of the filling and binding of Heaven and Earth.\n*End of Scroll Forty-Five of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n*Scroll Forty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n**Method Sixty-Two: The Priceless Dao Repels the Barbarians**\n\nThe Celestial Master was about to depart, with no set time for return, and wished to ask one or two lingering questions. \"Go ahead, speak quickly now.\" \"I have long been preparing to ask—what matters do you wish to inquire about?\" \"I humbly beg to ask the Enlightened Master about the Daoist scriptures you have bestowed upon your disciple. To speak of them seems immodest and grand, yet if I do not ask now, will I remain ignorant of them for all time?\" \"Go on, do not hesitate.\" \"Now, may the Enlightened Master enlighten this foolish disciple.\" \"Very well.\"\n\n\"Master, what is the value of the Daoist scriptures you have given me before and after?\" \"Ah, your foolishness is indeed great—do you suppose the Dao has a fixed price?\" \"Very well.\" \"Let me explain fully so that you may awaken and deeply understand the weight of the Heavenly Dao, its value, and its measure.\"\n\n\"Suppose I now bestow upon you a thousand *jin* of gold to present to the state—could it win the joyful favor of Heaven and Earth, harmonize *yin* and *yang*, eradicate all disasters and anomalies, grant the lord and king a long reign, and bring governance to supreme peace? Suppose you carry ten thousand pairs of jade bi-discs back to the state, treasuring and storing them as the rarest of treasures—could they summon the *qi* of perfect harmony from all six directions, bring forth every auspicious sign, repel the barbarians a myriad miles, and end their harm?\"\n\n\"Yet the Dao I have fully imparted to you can cause the lord and king to deeply win the joyful favor of Heaven and Earth, bring universal delight to all ministers under heaven, and make even the crawling and creeping creatures rejoice. The barbarians will retreat and submit, auspicious signs will all appear, disasters and harms will be wholly eradicated, and the state’s lifespan will be prolonged. The people will live to old age. If one truly excels in goodness and follows my scriptures, seeking only their essential meaning, all will respond as if echoing—like a compass and square perfectly aligned, with no deviation. The great matter will be accomplished...\"\n\n\"I speak for Heaven and do not deceive you. Now, if this Heavenly method is offered to assist a virtuous lord and king, freeing him from care, how can one speak of its daily value? Has your foolish heart understood yet?\" \"Very well, please explain one more matter for me.\"\n\nThose in the world who delight in goodness and bring joy to others find nothing so excellent as cherishing a virtuous woman—once obtained, she becomes a partner in bearing children, united in heart. Truly, such goodness is lovable beyond compare. Now, if a ruler were granted ten thousand such women, all would rejoice at the sight, and men’s bodies would forget their age. Yet could this alone pacify Heaven and Earth, win the hearts of all nations, and make the eight distant realms echo in response, bringing universal peace? My Way alone can secure the boundless heavens above and harmonize the limitless earth below. The eight directions will all delight and submit, and even the restless multitude will be transformed by its virtue, each finding their rightful place. How great is its worth? Ponder this deeply.\n\nIf you wish to repay Heaven’s profound favor and win its heart, swiftly offer my scriptures in return. Were you to pile up rare treasures and precious goods to the heavens, Heaven would not rejoice, nor would you gain its true favor. To win Heaven’s heart, you must day and night reflect on my words—once you grasp their meaning, you will also gain Heaven’s heart. How immeasurable is their worth?\n\nThus, bestowing a thousand gold pieces upon a state is not as valuable as imparting a single essential teaching that can govern. Presenting ten thousand pairs of jade disks is not as beneficial as advancing two great worthies. For essential teachings and great worthies, the precious Way, alone enable a ruler to govern in ease, attain great joy, and bring about peace, dispelling disasters and calming the world. How priceless are such essential teachings, great worthies, and the wondrous Way?\n\nTherefore, the sage-kings of old were never impoverished in wealth, yet they constantly lamented their poverty in men of talent. They grieved that great worthies were few, the people scattered, and all sought attachment elsewhere, growing ever more distant. Thus, they failed to meet Heaven’s will and lived in constant sorrow. If one merely delights in amassing rare and deceptive treasures, cherishing them, one cannot win the hearts of Heaven and Earth or pacify the four seas.\n\nThough gold, jade, and rare treasures be piled for a thousand miles, reaching the heavens, they cannot summon great worthies, sages, or immortals to assist in governance. Study my scriptures carefully, and great worthies will come of their own accord to aid the ruler’s governance. In a single day, they will unite in counsel, like people gathering in a marketplace, each bringing their resources. Those who follow my scriptures will find Heaven and Earth grow brighter, the sun, moon, and stars all radiant with renewed light, shining to the farthest reaches. The eight directions and the four barbarians will see it and joyfully submit. Worthies and scholars will all emerge, no longer concealed. Weapons and armor will vanish, and the world will proceed in effortless harmony, no longer harming one another. With one heart, all will delight in the ruler.\n\nMy scriptures alone can bring this about. How immeasurable is their worth? Do you now understand?\n\nThus, the sages of old deeply understood the Way and valued the harmony of qi, never hoarding earthly goods but entrusting them to the virtuous. The virtuous comprehend the hearts of Heaven and Earth, hence they honor the Way and revere virtue. Fools prize rare and deceptive treasures, so Heaven’s scriptures do not descend, and sages do not bestow their teachings—this is the reason. Take heed, my words are not false. Guard my Way well.\n\nOne who clings to precious jades, gold, and wealth, sitting in darkness to guard them, cannot sleep—such is the folly of prizing mere treasures. How can they compare to the transmission of Heaven’s sacred and secret charts and scriptures, which alone can pacify Heaven and Earth, the six directions, and the eight distant realms? Go forth, and take heed once more. Yes, yes.\n\nMy scriptures are guarded at all times by the divine officials of Heaven who sit beside them—take heed once more.\nYes, yes.\n\nMy scriptures are the divine officials of the Three Luminaries, ever following to illuminate and observe them.\nYes, yes.\n\nMy scriptures are the heart and mind of Heaven—delve deeply and meditate upon them with utmost clarity.\nYes, yes.\n\nIf you heed my words, I shall further reveal to you matters unseen and unheard.\nYes, yes.\n\nSpoken from mouth to ear, they must not be widely transmitted.\nWhen emperors and kings obtain them, the world submits; divine spirits aid their governance, and people naturally do good, achieving harmony without daily decrees.\nYes, yes.\n\nMy six disciples are all dull and benighted, incapable of discourse—any utterance would surely breach taboos. Now, all defer to their master to expound the Way and virtue before the August Heaven, crafting for emperors and kings an eternal treasure for ten thousand myriad generations. The master must disclose all matters within and without, concealing nothing. Having received this solemn teaching and secret charge, they dare not leak it.\nUnderstood. Now, I shall consult the August Heaven on your behalf: if it is right to reveal all, I shall not dare conceal anything; if it is not right to disclose, I shall not act recklessly.\n\nThe movements of Heaven and Earth each follow their own cycles. Now, I shall examine the time and destiny to release them, ensuring their enduring practice brings great fortune to families and states, averting peril and collapse.\n\nThe reason they are not entrusted to petty men but to emperors and kings is that emperors and kings, in their destiny, ever share the heart of Heaven and Earth—only they can enact this. Petty men cannot, so it is entrusted to the noble, to be passed to the rightful one.\n\n[Right:] Explanation of the value and ranking of the balanced Way and virtue, unraveling the hearts of the foolish.\n\n*End of Scroll Forty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll Forty-Seven of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n**The Sixty-Third Supreme Method for Ministers, Disciples, and Students to Attain the Dao for Their Lords, Fathers, and Teachers**\n\nBefore the Perfected One.\n\nAmong those who serve as ministers, disciples, or subjects, who may be called the most virtuous?\n\nPerfected One, though weary, you should strive to explain this clearly for me.\n\nVery well.\n\nYet I fear I may err in my words.\n\nWhy so humble?\n\nIndeed, I shall speak truthfully.\n\nNow, among the ministers, disciples, and subjects of a lord, those who are ever cautious and faithful, never daring to violate the king’s laws, who from birth to death commit no grave transgressions and live without blame—these may be called the most virtuous of men.\n\nAh! Your words seem plausible, yet they miss the mark. What you describe may be called men of middling virtue, not the most supreme.\n\nThen, Perfected One, pray explain further: what are the deeds of the most supremely virtuous and filial?\n\nYou should speak with utmost care and completeness.\n\nSince my words have already failed to meet the Heavenly Master’s intent, I dare not speak further.\n\nWhy so humble? Speak only what you know, and where it falls short, I shall clarify for you.\n\nVery well.\n\nThus, the conduct of the supremely virtuous and filial disciple is ever to uphold the Dao, never daring to cause their parents sorrow. In daily life, they nurture with goodness, morning and evening cherishing their kin. From the time they gain understanding in this life, they have never committed grave transgressions or borne blame—such is the most supreme filial child.\n\nAh! What the Perfected One describes seems akin to it, yet it is not. What you have spoken may be called a disciple of middling virtue, not one of supreme filial devotion. It does not exceed the mark, nor is it a transgression—it simply does not reach it.\n\nNow, as you take the Perfected One as your master and follow the model of a disciple, let us see what else you have to say. Your words, as they stand, are such that the common folk—ignorant and benighted—are indeed difficult to instruct. Their accumulated folly runs deep; when they encounter one of supreme virtue and filial piety, they may even find fault with them. You have not yet grasped it—allow me to explain further.\n\nVery well.\n\nThough the way be arduous, speak again in full of the supremely virtuous disciple.\n\nNow I have already erred twice before the Heavenly Master—I dare not speak further.\n\nGo on, you must exert yourself and speak with care.\n\nFor a disciple to hear teaching yet not believe it is a far graver transgression. Yet where understanding falls short, this is something shared by all under Heaven from ancient times to the present. Speak plainly.\n\nVery well.\n\nYet as a disciple, one must at all times and in all matters be compliant and reverent, following the master’s teachings and decrees without the slightest deviation. One must not dare to speak recklessly and disrupt the master’s words, nor in going out or coming in give cause for the master to worry. From the moment one receives instruction, one must not transgress or stray into wrongdoing, but day by day turn toward goodness with gladness, harboring no ill intent and never opposing the master’s will—such is the disciple of supreme virtue.\n\nAlas! What the Perfected One has spoken nearly resembles this, yet it is not the disciple of supreme virtue, but only one of middling virtue.\n\nIn truth, I fall short. This foolish student, seeing the master’s stern decree, has forced himself to speak of three matters. If these three do not meet the Heavenly Master’s expectations, the fault and reproach will be grave indeed. I fear further transgressions that cannot be absolved.\n\nYet all people fall short in their conduct—you bear no ill intent, and thus no blame.\n\nNow the people of the world are all profoundly benighted, not one of them knowing what is right.\n\nEven when the Perfected One explains matters in this way, what hope is there for the common folk and the ignorant? Their constant failure to comprehend, their blind adherence to their own foolish hearts—this is only to be expected.\n\nMay the Heavenly Master, in his compassion, continue to instruct and clarify what they do not yet grasp. The kindness of this enlightened master’s guidance is deeply cherished.\n\nI shall now set forth for the Perfected One a full account—you must exert yourself and commit it to memory.\n\nVery well, I shall.\n\nNow the minister of supreme virtue, like the common subject, conducts himself thus: from dawn to dusk, he constantly worries for his lord and king, his heart set on bringing them peace. He grieves for their afflictions and pains, ever delighting when the emperor may govern with ease, while his ministers and people all emulate him in filial piety and kindness. In his governance, he seeks only to allow the ruler to sit in tranquility and wander at leisure. Such rule wins the favor of Heaven above and the approval of Earth below, while at the center, the myriad people rejoice without grievance or neglect. All creatures that walk, crawl, or fly turn toward his influence and are transformed, none perishing from plague, and all things attain their rightful place. Heaven and Earth harmonize, the Three Qi rejoice together, and the lord’s lifespan is extended while his years multiply. The people, in turn, seek rare prescriptions and extraordinary arts, uncovering hidden texts and bringing forth all that was concealed. The world responds in unison, crying out in admiration: “Wonderful! Such a thing has never been seen before!” From the eldest to the youngest child, none know how to do evil again. All hold fast to these wondrous arts and offer them to the emperor. When the emperor obtains them, he may prolong his years. All grieve that their lord is aging, yet when his rule aligns with the heart of Heaven, Heaven and Earth may send spirits bearing medicines to announce, “Take and consume these, and you shall know no end in this life.” Such is the achievement of the minister and subject of supreme virtue. Does the Perfected One now understand?\n\nVery well.\n\nYou may be said to have awakened. Thus did the ministers and people of the Supreme Sovereign of Great Antiquity conduct themselves—this was their way. How was such perfect governance attained? By this Dao, this Way, the foremost scripture of Great Antiquity. If the Perfected One deeply contemplates its meaning, he shall attain the heart of Heaven. I have reverently received this from the heart of Heaven, and below, I employ it to relieve the virtuous lord of disasters and remove all harms. In awe of Heaven’s majesty, how dare I not exhaust my words? Heaven has commanded that I swiftly record this for the Perfected One and deliver it to the virtuous lord, that his rule may resemble Heaven—how then would it differ from Heaven?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the Heavenly Master’s words, I now perceive that the balanced qi of Great Peace has truly arrived. The means to attain it have been revealed. What cause is there for sorrow?\n\nYet these are not your concerns—why then do you rejoice at goodness and grieve at evil?\n\nThe reason is this: when the qi of goodness arrives, the qi of evil and perversity withdraws, and I remain at peace, free from illness and harm. But when the qi of evil arrives and the qi of goodness withdraws, I fear calamity and dare not act—such is the case throughout the world. Thus, I rejoice at goodness.\n\nExcellent indeed are your words. May the Heavenly Master, in his compassion, now speak of the methods of supreme filial piety.\n\nExcellent is your question. Now the foremost filial child of supreme virtue thinks constantly of his parents, who are aging and soon to depart. He dwells alone in quiet contemplation, grieving deeply, seeking arts to prevent their death so that he may remain with them. He values the Dao above wealth, seeking only to sustain their lives. He plays mournful melodies on the zither to gladden their hearts, guiding their minds toward the Dao, delighting in the thought of dwelling with them forever without aging. He tirelessly seeks rare prescriptions, traveling to distant lands, his sincerity moving Heaven, his efforts unceasing until the end. His clothing and food are sufficient, and he no longer stores up treasures for future generations. Instead, he spares his parents all sorrow, for even the spirits of those who have died before them in the household are not at ease in their grief. He eats without seeking blessings, saying only, “Exert yourselves and take care in the underworld—do not torment yourselves by grieving for those who remain.” Such is the conduct of the most filial child of the Supreme Sovereign of Great Antiquity. When the four directions hear of his goodness, all rejoice from afar and delight in emulating him. Thus, they give rise to ministers of kindness and filial piety for the emperor. The filial child’s concern for his parents and the virtuous minister’s concern for his lord should be like this.\n\nNow what the Perfected One has just described barely meets the standard—each seeks only to preserve their own well-being. What benefit does this bring to lord, father, or master? How can one call this a person of supreme virtue? This is merely one who seeks self-preservation and personal gain. If even the Perfected One considers this good, how much more so the common folk? Those who see themselves as cautious and trustworthy, who do not violate the king’s laws and bear no guilt, weep and wail, declaring, “I have not betrayed Heaven, nor my lord, nor my father, nor my master!”\n\nYour conduct merely suffices to preserve your own well-being, yet you deeply claim merit before your superiors, wailing to Heaven and Earth—such are all inferior and foolish people, incapable of becoming those of supreme virtue. The reason I now distinguish and expound this to you, Perfected One, is to have you transmit these words in writing to a lord of superior virtue, that he may profoundly instruct the multitude of worthies, causing them all to awaken and discern whether their conduct is right or wrong—does it truly benefit their lord, father, or master?\n\nSince the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, people have grown increasingly foolish, daily more avaricious. For the sake of their perverse conduct, they falsely claim merit before Heaven and Earth, their lord, father, and master—these are utterly rebellious, unprincipled people. Does the Perfected One not know this?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have awakened. Now, to practice true goodness is exceedingly difficult—be cautious. If you do not diligently propagate my teachings to resolve the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth, enabling the emperor to govern without care or trouble, so that all under Heaven rejoice, even the grasses and trees, then you have not yet become one who responds to the supreme good. You are merely one who preserves his own person—how then can you be placed alongside Heaven and Earth?\n\nThose who delight in preserving their own well-being—petty men are especially prone to this. Do you understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have awakened—be cautious.\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow, this Master pities the foolish, lowly, and unenlightened beings. I wish to hear again of the conduct of the disciples of supreme goodness.\nThe disciples of supreme goodness, having received the Dao and virtue from their master, bear in mind the grace of their teacher and thus attain completion as persons. They are able to follow worthy companions long and unerringly, maintaining their ranks. Some obtain official positions to repay their parents, while others deeply enter the Dao, mastering the arts of self-nurturance. When a person is born to parents, completes the Dao and virtue under a master, and gains honor and esteem from their lord, they often dwell alone, contemplating the aging of their lord, father, and master, and that none can replace them. They constantly think of performing deeds for their master—obtaining rare methods and extraordinary texts—to repay his merit. Their thoughts are upright and pained, yet they find nothing extraordinary. Thus, they further study under the worthy, entrust themselves to their master, and speak on his behalf, enabling their master to become a fine assistant to the state, thereby further benefiting the governance of the emperor. Such are the disciples of supreme goodness from the Highest Antiquity. Later generations, enlightened lords and worthies, are called people of supreme goodness.\n\nIf, Perfected One, you now merely speak of easy teachings, caution, and trustworthiness, yet fail to comprehend the master’s heart, you merely conform to the role of a disciple, striving only to perfect yourself. What benefit does this bring to your superiors, that you should call yourself a good disciple? Even what the Perfected One describes—let alone the common folk—are those who constantly claim merit before their masters, and this is indeed so.\n\nAs ministers, sons, and disciples, if one does not follow the instructions of lord, father, or master, all are guilty of great rebellion and cannot be named again. The good sons, good ministers, and good disciples the Perfected One speaks of merely avoid transgressions—foolish indeed! What can be called good? Thus, the common people are foolish, and only you, Perfected One, have long been thoroughly enlightened. Now, by your words, I have measured them and know they have truly lost the correct path, long mired in falsehood and delusion.\n\nTherefore, Heaven alone knows this deeply, hence its anger and displeasure, the accumulation of disasters, and the mutual burden of transgressions. If, as the Perfected One says, one merely preserves oneself and avoids wrongdoing, yet claims merit before Heaven, Earth, and others, this is the height of folly—be ever cautious. Your words do not yet fully accord with the will of Heaven. The reason I have the Perfected One speak is not for your sake, but to observe the gains and losses of the common people—what constitutes their greatest transgression? Thus, I have you speak to discern their crookedness or straightness. Do you truly understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nGo—you have awakened.\n\nAt first, when the Perfected One awakened, I did not wish to speak with you. Seeing your earnestness and daily devotion to goodness, I have spoken deeply with you, expounding the intent of Heaven and Earth, resolving the sorrows of emperors, the grievances of the common people, and the disorder of the myriad things. Now that I have set forth these teachings and principles for you, I hold nothing back—only strive to remember them.\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nI have observed many disciples, but few can be spoken with, so I have not discussed these matters thoroughly with them. Thus, my Dao has never been transmitted—do you understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nGo—you have understood.\n\nNow that this Master has pitied his disciple and spoken frankly without reservation: when the lord is worthy, ministers are often loyal; when the master is enlightened, disciples often speak without reservation. Excellent indeed are your words. Having grasped their meaning, act upon them.\n\nNow, does the world truly possess the Dao of immortality and the methods to avoid aging? Can such things truly be attained?\n\nExcellent indeed is your question, Perfected One. Yes, they can be attained.\n\nThe elixirs of immortality accumulated in the heavens are as numerous as the grains stored in the Grand Granary. The immortal robes are as abundant as the white cloth amassed in the Imperial Storehouse. The dwellings of the many immortals are as plentiful as the residences of the imperial bureaucracy.\n\nThey ever dwell within the Great Dao, and thus they ascend to Heaven. The Great Dao is the abode and lodging-house of the divine spirits. If one possesses virtue and power, one dwells in the lodging-houses of the imperial bureaucracy.\n\nYet Heaven does not begrudge the immortal robes or the methods of avoiding death—it is difficult to bestow them upon people. If one has not rendered great service to Heaven and Earth, cannot govern and rectify the great ailments of Heaven and Earth, or harmonize the qi of yin and yang, and brings no benefit to the Three Luminaries, the Four Seasons, the Five Phases, and the divine spirits of Heaven and Earth, then Heaven will not grant them the methods of avoiding death or the immortal robes.\n\nThese are reserved solely for those of exceptional merit. Do you wish to know their great efficacy?\n\nJust as the Son of Heaven possesses the great granaries’ grain and the imperial storehouses’ silks and cottons—how many bushels and pecks fill the great granaries? Yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single pint. Those who commit transgressions, instead, are cast into its prisons, where their crimes are adjudicated and their punishments meted out. This is a manifest consequence.\n\nNow, people are truly wicked and do not accord with Heaven’s will, so Heaven does not fully dispense its efficacious medicinal formulas. Instead, day by day, it sends forth spirits and numinous beings to examine, flog, and strike those without proper conduct. Thus, the sick do not cease, and the dead are many. This is like a prefecture in turmoil, where prisons overflow with criminals and violent deaths abound—such is the meaning.\n\nIf one renders great service to the Son of Heaven, one’s palaces and storehouses will overflow with official grain, silks, and cottons, ensuring constant clothing and sustenance. The lives of the people and the Son of Heaven depend on this: one need only constantly think of governing with the good. Why withhold or begrudge? The duty of the ruler is to assemble the multitude of worthies and, with gentle harmony, govern the world together.\n\nA lord without worthy ministers, a father without filial sons, a teacher without obedient and good disciples—such sorrows cannot be fully expressed. Thus, in high antiquity, the Three Sovereigns governed with folded arms, free from affairs and cares. Their ministers were prudent and good, grieving for their lords as if in constant heartache, and so they dared to assist their lords in pacifying the world. Moreover, they sought and obtained the immortal formulas of Heaven to bestow upon their lords, and thus their lords attained longevity. Some, having rendered great service—so great that they ascended together as immortals—shared in the governance of Heaven’s affairs, and Heaven in turn clothed and fed them. This is a manifest consequence, not empty words.\n\nYet since the middle antiquity, many have envied the true Dao, sealing and cutting it off, deceiving one another with false ways, beguiling the people, and reducing the number of the worthy. Thus, lords and ministers alike suffer hardship, unable even to pacify the world, and many do not attain longevity. This is not solely the fault of those in the lower antiquity; its origins are long-standing, and the great blame lies here. Do you, too, not know this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, Heaven above has amassed wondrous formulas and immortal robes beyond measure, yet without great merit, one cannot obtain them. It is like one who possesses the prefecture’s halls and storehouses, its grain, money, silks, and cottons, dwelling constantly by the great Dao as if at home, without fleeing or hiding. Yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single peck of grain, a single coin, or an inch of silk or cotton. This is a manifest consequence.\n\nTherefore, since the high and middle antiquity, the true Dao has daily declined, and so the true formulas of longevity and immortality cannot be obtained. Those who, by their transgressions, attain longevity alone are merely the longest-lived in the world. Why is this? Where true virtue and power abound, correct qi abounds, so people suffer little illness and live long. Where false and deceptive writings proliferate, perverse and malign qi abounds, so people suffer many illnesses and do not attain longevity. This is Heaven’s natural principle.\n\nThus, the ministers of the Three Sovereigns of antiquity abounded in the true Dao, and so their lords lived long. The ministers of the Five Emperors had less of the true Dao, and so their lords did not match the longevity of the Three Sovereigns. The ministers of the Three Kings had even less of the true Dao and could not equal the Five Emperors. The ministers of the Five Hegemons, at their best, wrought false and deceptive calamities, possessing not a single thread of the true Dao, and so many died prematurely. This is a manifest consequence. Those who occasionally attained longevity were merely the longest-lived in the world. Do you deeply understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old needed only to observe the auspicious and inauspicious omens they received to know for themselves their safety or peril, fortune or misfortune. Those who received the highest auspicious omens had already attained the most supreme governance. Those who received middling omens resembled middling people. Those who received the lowest omens resembled the lowest people. What does this mean?\n\nIt means that if one receives omens like those of the Three Sovereigns, one is of the highest rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Emperors, one is of the middle rank. If one receives omens like those of the Three Kings, one is of the great middle-lower rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Hegemons, one is of the lowest rank. How can this be made manifest through such omens?\n\nExcellent, your words are well said!\n\nThose who govern without punishment and achieve self-regulation are of the highest rank. Those who issue decrees and are slightly feared by the people are of the middle rank. Those who rely on minor punishments to maintain order are of the great middle-lower rank. Those who govern with excessive deceptive policies, treating falsehood as truth, abandoning proper methods, indulging in superficial embellishments and empty documents, ruling with harsh punishments, proliferating corrupt practices, and lacking any true Dao to uphold—these are the effects of the lowest hegemonic way.\n\nIn ancient times, the sagely and wise could observe the celestial decrees they received and thereby know their own superiority or inferiority. To whom should the teachings be entrusted? If one is destined to produce worthy successors to assist in governance, it is like a family on the rise, which must bear virtuous children. Or if the Yellow River and Luo River yield prophetic texts and charts as proof, this is the sign.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nLet me further clarify for you, Perfected One. When a family is in decline, it bears wicked and malevolent children. When a ruler is in decline, Heaven does not grant him worthy and virtuous assistants. When a family is in decline, its descendants do not pursue true virtue and the Dao; instead, they favor flattery, deceit, superficiality, and corrupt, licentious practices—thus bringing misfortune and chaos upon the household. When a family is flourishing, it must seek true virtue, the Dao, extraordinary texts, and exceptional methods to save itself. When a noble ruler is rising, Heaven bestows upon him true texts, the true Dao, and true virtue, and good people join him in governance. The Yellow River and Luo River may still occasionally issue decrees, disasters diminish day by day, auspicious omens appear daily, and good responses grow ever more numerous—these are the effects.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Go forth, Perfected One, and strive with all your might. You shall render great service to Heaven and assist the virtuous ruler in becoming wise and enlightened.\n\nWhat does this mean? To render great service to Heaven, you are now one who has departed from the world of mortals. If you cannot be praised for your governance, how can you render service to Heaven? What should be done now? Simply entrust these texts to the Virtuous Ruler. The Virtuous Ruler is the Son of Heaven, aligned with the will of Heaven. He shall use this governance to repay Heaven’s great favor, pacify the world, and elevate himself—thus, you too shall attain good fortune and preserve your longevity.\n\nExcellent, indeed, indeed. Go forth; the discourse on the three ways of conduct is now complete. Let this be shown to all worthy and ordinary people, so that later generations who seek to do good may follow this path. Do not dare to act solely for personal gain, claiming to be virtuous while placing Heaven, the ruler, parents, and teachers above all else.\n\nThe conduct of people as described by the Perfected One may still be balanced and moderate, but those of the lowest and most foolish nature, who accumulate evil dispositions and deeds, are beyond enumeration. Entrust these texts to the people of later ages, so that each may deeply examine and practice them. How can one’s conduct benefit Heaven, the ruler, parents, and teachers? If one’s actions merely increase for the sake of self-preservation and personal gain—does Heaven not deeply perceive the hearts and minds of people? This is why so many suffer.\n\nExcellent! This foolish one has beheld the words of the Heavenly Mind and the Master and has greatly awakened. You may be called one who is easily enlightened. In this world, there are many of the lowest and most foolish people who trust only their own ignorant hearts and no longer believe the words of others. Their errors lie in undermining the Dao of Heaven, causing emperors and kings to suffer distress. This arises precisely from such foolish scholars, who are envious of the true Dao and virtue, disparaging the worthy while trusting their own unbenevolent hearts. Heaven finds this affliction grievous, and thus has sent forth these texts for the ruler of supreme virtue, so that he may attain them, secure his person, and bring peace to his governance. Those who gain Heaven’s favor—the rulers of the remote antiquity of the Highest Sovereign—were precisely those who explored and received Heaven’s profound blessings in this way.\n\nDoes the Perfected One understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, you have understood. Depart.\n\nReflect upon this as you go.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly wish to ask one more question.\nSpeak.\n\nWhy does the Heavenly Master present these teachings and texts in such great number?\n\nExcellent is your inquiry—it truly grasps the intent of the Dao. Yet the world’s preferences for good and evil are equal in principle, though their applications differ in intent. Thus the Dao is largely the same but slightly different; one matter is divided into fifteen hundred and twenty words, and only then is the Dao of Heaven slightly complete, and the kingly Way slightly perfected. If one were to encompass all that exists between Heaven and Earth, above and below, the eight directions and six conjunctions, inner and outer, this text could not record its full power.\n\nDoes the Perfected One understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, you have understood. With this text, entrust it to a ruler of virtue and power, that it may be made known, so all people may reflect upon their conduct and discern their gains and losses, thereby relieving the afflictions of Heaven and Earth and bringing peace to the emperor and king. Then governance will swiftly be made level.\n\nDoes the Perfected One comprehend?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth now, steel yourself and do not be negligent.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n[The preceding section] distinguishes the conduct of rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, masters and disciples, and discerns their good and evil, their gains and losses.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four: Governing People Through the Dao, Not Through Might**\n\nThe Perfected One steps forward.\nShould all people employ awe, fear, cunning, and deception—constant coercion—to subdue others?\nIs this not improper?\nYou yourself must speak with precision.\n\nYet if people must use awe, fear, cunning, and deception to subdue others, why is this so?\nOnly through such means can one govern and rectify others.\n\nAlas! The Perfected One within is but a man of the vulgar world, unworthy of the title \"Supreme Perfected One.\" Your words resemble those of the common folk and do not enter the heart of Heaven. The discourse of a Supreme Perfected One should align with the heart of Heaven. Now, to subdue others through awe, fear, c\n\nThe disciple has now awakened.\nGo forth, ever cautious in speech, and do not speak recklessly—for Heaven is not man.\n*Yes, yes.*\n\nThose who fall short must ask questions diligently.\n*Yes, yes.*\n\nAbove: the method for distinguishing and subduing what Heaven, Earth, humans, ghosts, and spirits deem evil or assist.\n\n**End of *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Seven**\n\n**Beginning of *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Eight**\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Threefold Union and Mutual Permeation**\n\nPure Reverence bows twice and asks a single question.\n\"What is the doubt in the Perfected One’s mind?\"\n\n\"From dawn’s study to dusk’s return, I dwell in stillness, pondering its essential meaning, never daring to slacken.\nYet in the Heavenly Master’s writings, there is constant mention of the *Upper August Tai Ping Qi* soon arriving.\nWhat is meant by *Upper*?\nWhat is meant by *August*?\nWhat is meant by *Tai*?\nWhat is meant by *Ping*?\nWhat is meant by *Qi*?\nPerfected One, what do you now perceive or doubt? Why do you press me with such subtle inquiries at once?\nI have exhaustively questioned the Heavenly Master’s texts because they repeatedly speak of the *Upper August Qi* arriving, yet I cannot grasp their essential meaning.\nIf I do not now seek the enlightened Master’s explanation, I fear I may never come to know it. Thus, I dare not refrain from asking in full.\"\n\n\"Excellent, your words are immutable for ten thousand generations!\nThe Dao of Heaven is most profound, its virtue abundant, its benevolence overflowing—now the time has come. The August Spirit delights in humanity’s swift action, and so Heaven’s *qi* stirs your heart, urging you to question day and night. Heaven’s law is precise; I marvel at it.\n*Understood.*\"\n\n\"Perfected One, be seated. I shall fully explain the meaning of these characters so they may be transmitted without end.\nNow, the character *Upper* (上) is a single stroke. In its center, another vertical stroke is added, and above, it embraces one stroke after another, ascending to three in total. It moves upward without cease, never descending again. Thus, it is called *Upper*—for its form has nothing above it.\nReversed, it becomes *Lower* (下): a single stroke, with another vertical stroke in its center, then embracing one stroke as it descends. Its movement goes downward without return, so it is called *Lower*.\nThose whose will constantly tends downward will, over time, sink to the lowest point, with nowhere further to descend. This is like the turbid, which delights in descending to become Earth—thus Earth is the lowest, with nothing below it.\nThe character *Upper* always moves upward, never descending again. This is like the pure, which delights in ascending to become Heaven—thus Heaven has nothing above it.\nTherefore, in Heaven’s law, each name is defined by its own form, and all things under Heaven follow this principle. Thus, the sages established laws in accord with Heaven’s intent.\nTo guard the One and delight in ascending while divining (卜, *to inquire*)—divination is questioning. To constantly delight in ascending and inquire without cease is most auspicious, the highest path. Thus, the character *Upper* is a single stroke ascending while divining.\nThe character *Lower* descends with a single stroke while divining—divination is questioning. To constantly ponder and inquire while descending leads to the lowest extreme, with nowhere further to descend. Thus, those who delight in descending gain nothing more, nor can they ascend again.\nTherefore, *Upper* has no character above it, signifying that governance should daily ascend, aligning with Heaven’s heart, with nothing above it.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Enlightened Master, I humbly beg you to explain the character *August* (皇). I wish to hear further.\"\n\n\"The character *August* (皇) is formed by *Day* (日) and *King* (王) combined. *Day* above is the One (一), which is Heaven. Heaven’s number is One. When Heaven obtains the sun, it shines brilliantly and becomes kingly. Thus, the character combines One (一) and *Day* (日) with *King* (王) to form *August* (皇).\nOne is Heaven, and Heaven is the sovereign; the sun is also sovereign; the king is also sovereign. Three sovereigns unite to form the character *August*.\n*August* signifies its divine splendor, resplendent and radiant—thus it is called *August*.\nThe August is the first under Heaven, with nothing above it.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Master, I humbly beg you to elucidate the character *August*. Now, I wish to hear of the characters *Tai Ping Qi*.\"\n\n\"*Tai* (太) means *great*—it signifies accumulating great conduct like Heaven. In all matters, it is great, with nothing greater than Heaven.\n*Ping* (平) means *level*—it signifies governance that is perfectly balanced. All matters are ordered, with no partiality or selfishness. *Ping* is like Earth, which dwells below and maintains equilibrium. Earth’s equilibrium is like a person who plants goodness and reaps goodness, plants evil and reaps evil. If one treats others with goodness and diligence, their harvest will be abundant. If one favors goodness but others treat them poorly, their harvest will be meager and their produce inferior.\n*Qi* (氣) signifies Heaven’s *qi*, which delights in descending to generate life, and Earth’s *qi*, which delights in ascending to nurture. The law of *qi* operates between Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang unite, intermingling to form harmony. Together with the *Central Harmonious Qi*, the Three Qi coalesce to nourish all things. The Three Qi love and permeate one another, leaving no harm.\n*Tai* means *great*; *Ping* means *upright*; *Qi* governs nurturing and harmonious permeation. When governance attains this, there is *Tai Ping*—great peace and harmony. Thus, it is said the *Tai Ping Qi* arrives.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Does this refer solely to the *Central Harmonious Qi* of Heaven and Earth uniting to govern together? Or should all matters follow this Threefold Union?\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!

This is the essential Dao of Heaven.\n\nThis is like a person having head, feet, and abdomen to form a body—nothing can be removed.\nRemove any, and it becomes incomplete, no longer a person.\nThis is the natural principle of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity took their model from Heaven.\nA man must find a virtuous woman to govern with, and only then can they have good children.\nThe man is as ruler, the woman as minister, the child as the people.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of governing the state by Heaven’s mandate is to befriend worthy and enlightened ministers.\nOnly a good woman can harmonize her children; only a good minister can harmonize the people.\nOnly a good woman can bear good children; only a good minister can cultivate good people.\nWhen both ministers and people are good, they can bring long-lasting peace to their superior.\n\nIf the Realized One delights in knowing its effects:\nHeaven is as ruler, Earth is as minister.\nWhen Heaven’s rain flows everywhere, what it nurtures on good earth is good; what it nurtures on bad earth is bad—this is the meaning.\n\nNow, fathers, mothers, rulers, and ministers merely uphold the great guiding principles.\nThe essential truth is that they rely upon their children for clothing and food.\nWithout children, there are no descendants; when a ruler has few people, there is insufficient clothing and food, causing constant worry and distress.\n\nThus, the Dao of governing the state takes the people as its foundation.\nWithout people, ruler and minister have nothing to govern, nothing to order.\nTherefore, the great sages of antiquity, in their governance, devoted day and night to the people as their greatest urgency, worrying for them—\njust as parents worry over having no children.\nWithout children, how can one be called father and mother? Without people, how can one be called ruler?\n\nThus, the laws of Heaven always make ruler, minister, and people share the same fate, the same fortune and misfortune.\nIf even one office or one matter loses its proper course, great misfortune arises.\n\nSince the middle ages, the guiding principles of governance have often been lost, passed down in mutual neglect.\nLater generations have suffered even greater disasters, truly because ruler, minister, and people have failed in their plans, not deeply reflecting on goodness, not loving and uniting, not joining forces with a single heart—\ninstead, they have brought sorrow upon one another.\n\nThe ruler is but one person, yet he may dwell in deep seclusion, with grievances from afar accumulating and blocking all passage.\nGovernance fails to align with the heart of Heaven, and calamities, anomalies, and strange omens accumulate without remedy.\nWhat Heaven and Earth wish to say, the ruler does not know—\nthe great fault lies here: without the three joining forces, wisdom is cut off, perverse *qi* accumulates and goes unaddressed.\nAbove, this becomes the great enemy of August Heaven; below, the great fault of Earth.\nIt is the ruler’s greatest sorrow, calamities swarming without resolution, the people’s greatest harm, all things’ greatest affliction.\nThis has accumulated for so long—it is not merely the fault of those in later ages.\n\nDoes the Realized One also know this?\nIt has been thus for so long, yet the cause remains unknown.\nThus, the question arises in sincere grievance: what is to be done now?\n\nNow, the *qi* of Great Peace from Heaven is arriving.\nGovernance will align with the heart of Heaven, and all these evils will naturally be removed.\nThus, Heaven has sent me to explain it fully, wishing to correct these failures and issue the correct teachings.\nTherefore, the Realized One has come to ask these questions in full—this is the origin of misfortune.\n\nIt does not emulate the natural law of Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*, nor does it achieve the threefold resonance, joining forces with a single heart—this is how such calamities arise. If the three resonate, joining forces with a single heart, then Great Peace and boundless joy will be established, and disasters will vanish. I wish to hear: how should governance proceed?\n\nHasten to emulate the law of Heaven—this is how one serves above. Heaven’s law dictates that all matters require the three to join forces with a single heart. Thus, Heaven uses the Three Luminaries as its pattern: the Three Luminaries constantly intermingle and illuminate together, never ceasing for even a moment. Since the Heavenly Contract emerged, humans have used writing to govern, modeling it after the Three Luminaries of Heaven. Therefore, Heaven frequently causes the River Chart and Luo Writ to appear, repeatedly activating the written patterns of human culture. It desires to emulate Heaven’s profound and divine method of governance, causing goodness to flourish day by day and evil to perish day by day.\n\nWriting is merely the circulation of documents along the three pathways. The ruler should skillfully guide those below, issuing clear decrees and instructions, teaching the people to each remain in their place and submit memorials, fully recounting what they have heard of good and evil. If they must travel in reverse, they may simply send it by convenient means—even entrusting it to merchant carts for delivery—or they may clearly state their name and address when submitting. If the method is thus, then the good and evil of the world will be fully revealed.\n\nThe ruler channels the *qi* of Heaven downward to communicate; ministers channel the *qi* of Earth upward to communicate; the people channel the harmonious *qi* of the center upward to communicate. The Realized One transmits this text, entrusting it to a ruler of virtue. If he carefully heeds these words, Great Peace and joy will be established, and calamities will be removed—not a fraction will be lost. This text is reverently received from the law of Heaven; it is not mere empty or deceptive speech.\n\nIf Heaven were to execute my disciples, would you know the severity of this punishment? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIf you wish to verify the truth of this text, once obtained, put it into effect and observe it. When it resonates in response with Heaven and Earth, that is the proof of its authenticity. By this great and clear evidence, you may cast aside all doubt.\n\nThe way to govern the state and find joy in aligning with Heaven’s heart lies in nothing more than implementing this method and resonating in response with Heaven—this is the bright contract by which Heaven speaks with humanity. I have only met the Realized One because I constantly delight in aiding virtuous rulers, wishing to repay Heaven’s great merit. Thus, I have spoken these few words.\n\nI know the failure lies here: the obstruction that prevents the circulation of these texts. The ruler must create clear teachings and good decrees. Proclaim that from this day forward, officials and people should each remain in their place and submit memorials with all their strength, fully recounting good and evil to illuminate the governance of the emperor and communicate with the *qi* of Heaven. None may obstruct this—those who do shall be punished for three years. Only those who submit memorials in complete sincerity, without deceitful words, shall be summoned and appointed to office.\n\nHow should their appointment proceed? Each should be questioned about their talents and abilities, and assigned to a position within the scope of their strength. Why must they be assigned only to what their strength can bear? Heaven deals with people according to their abilities; if one is assigned beyond their capacity, it is called wronging them, and this will only bind *qi* and increase disasters. The reason is this: what one cannot achieve, even if one were to rise from the dead, one still could not accomplish.\n\nWhat people desire most is to obtain fine things—gold and jade. Suppose a wise ruler issues a decree: \"Whoever has ability, come forward, and you shall receive all the gold, silver, and rare treasures of the imperial treasury across the land—nothing will surpass what I give to you.\" The person would be overjoyed to obtain them, yet if their strength cannot reach the objects, even if their hands were bound and exhausted, they still could not attain them.\n\nNow, as parents and rulers of the people, when assigning positions to ministers and children, if one does not consider their strengths but instead forces them into roles, it is like killing them. They will be unable to manage their duties, only causing chaos in their offices and bringing sorrow to the people. When offices are in chaos and the people and ministers are distressed, they will look up and cry out to Heaven, voicing their grievances and moving Heaven, thereby increasing disasters and anomalies.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, wishing to align with Heaven’s heart, were exceedingly cautious in appointments, ensuring that all received the people’s favor. Only then could they be said to have matched Heaven’s heart. What does it mean to match Heaven’s heart? When governance is implemented and yields a response—when the people and officials grow daily in goodness, trust, and loyalty—that is the proof. Then, promotions should occur in due time, for these are the people who aid the state in aligning with Heaven’s heart.\n\nSome, however, seek only joy in obtaining office for the sake of reputation, yet their conduct yields no results, does not match Heaven’s heart, and receives no response. The emperor governs by inheriting Heaven’s heart; he must always align with it, for failing to do so is a transgression. If his governance yields no good response, he should step back and reflect on his errors. In this way, Heaven will be pleased, and all under Heaven will be utterly loyal, exerting their full strength. Even those in distant and hidden places will hear of it, and none will conceal their abilities.\n\nThose who urgently submit memorials—human life is of the utmost weight and cannot be delayed for even a moment. If people continue to cry out in grievance, disasters and anomalies will only accumulate. Resolve and report on these matters swiftly. Matters that can be endured should wait until autumn and winter. Why must they wait until autumn and winter? Because autumn is when things reach completion, and winter is when things are fully stored—Heaven’s *qi* is settled then.\n\nThings ripen in the second month of autumn, the eighth month, when their fruits and kernels can be distinguished. Thus, one should follow the law of Heaven and Earth, beginning in the eighth month to examine and distinguish them. The ninth month is the culmination of Heaven’s *qi*, when all things approach death. Therefore, one should thoroughly examine them in the ninth month, observing the balance of good and evil. Ten is the end of numbers, so by the tenth month, things return to their beginning.\n\nHeaven’s standard takes the eighth month as the tenth month, when all things reach completion. Earth’s standard takes the ninth month as the tenth month, when all things grow old. Humanity’s standard takes the *hai* month as the tenth month, when all things die. The three standards are complete, and things are ready to be reborn. Thus, *qian* resides in the northwest, and all things begin their kernels in the *hai* month. Heaven’s law distinguishes them in the eighth month, culminates them in the ninth, and solidifies their kernels in the tenth. Thus, the three standards of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all conclude, their kernels solidified in the *hai* month. Therefore, in the tenth month, the kernels are solidified and handed down for return.\n\nThis is because the eighth, ninth, and tenth months are the three months when the standards of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all reach their end and are ready to return to the beginning.\n\nIf the kernels are not solidified, their meaning is not attained—Heaven and Earth will not be pleased, disasters will not be dispelled, and harm will recur in the coming year. Thus, in the eighth month, they are distinguished and observed; in the ninth month, they are brought to completion; in the tenth month, their kernels are solidified and handed down for return. This compels officials and common people alike to reflect anew on their transgressions and dare not repeat them. In the coming year, officials and people will be more vigilant, and all things will be well. If they do not return to reflect on their faults with steadfast resolve, ministers and subjects below will fail in governance and remain unaware of their errors, their hearts unchanged. The Dao of Heaven is unyielding—evil is not easily transformed. Therefore, they must be handed down for return.\n\nFor the Perfected One who wishes to know its efficacy: when what is handed down for return this year is recorded in one copy and kept, and officials and people are also instructed to record one copy for themselves, the measure of good and evil is called the \"Heavenly Bond.\" When the next year’s return is handed down, another copy is made to observe the measure of good and evil. When the following year’s return is handed down, yet another copy is made to observe the measure of good and evil. The records below are compared with those above, and if they correspond, it is called the \"Heavenly Mandate Aligning with the Token.\" This compels officials and people to transform their hearts and act with virtue, gaining Heaven’s favor. If what is submitted above is mostly good, it indicates great transformation and great goodness. If they remain obstinate, unchanged, and unyielding, what is submitted will remain as it was. If evil persists without cease, what is submitted will grow worse. If officials and people greatly deceive and defy Heaven, what is submitted will be vastly more evil and severe. Thus, this is the mirror of Heaven’s all-penetrating illumination of the heart—it does not err by even a fraction, clearly revealing the conduct of officials and people.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like echo and shadow, responding to human actions without fail. Perfected One, if you harbor good intentions, strive to complete them with care. Though you have come to inquire of this, if it were without purpose or benefit, Heaven would silently observe. Your words may speak, but how can they be proven? When a person speaks, if their words are detailed and virtuous, others respond with virtue, and the echo answers with virtue. If their words are ominous and inauspicious, others respond with evil, and the echo answers with evil. All things that correspond and harmonize are made so by Heaven. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nHeaven is lofty, distant, and majestic—how could it descend to address mortals in every matter? Thus, its laws operate through natural resonance and harmony. Has your heart now opened? Indeed, indeed. I understand. I wish to ask the Heavenly Master for one more instruction. Practice the Dao.\n\nIn the middle antiquity, the August Emperor had no written records, yet the three realms communicated—how could order be maintained? Excellent is your question. The movement of Heaven made the people of that time upright and unadorned; they all embraced the Dao and believed with singular devotion. They communicated through simple words, each desiring utmost sincerity and seeking to align with Heaven’s will—none deceived another. Thus, ruler, minister, and people united in strength and purpose, communicating as one, and so they harmonized. If they had not been of one heart and one household, chaos would have ensued.\n\nNow, under the weight of inherited burdens, written documents abound, and deception through texts flourishes. Even the worthy and learned are misled, collectively losing Heaven’s favor. Since Heaven has produced written records, mere words can no longer suffice. One must solidify the kernels and attain their truth—when the three realms communicate, Heaven’s *qi* will be balanced.\n\nThe laws of Heaven vary by the hundreds of millions, differing from age to age. Governance and methods are each distinct. Now, as the *qi* of Great Peace approaches, the fundamental texts must be solidified with correct and original characters to gain Heaven’s favor. If you cannot discern this, consider: since Heaven and Earth established affairs, their governance has taken countless forms. Those who practice their methods and receive Heaven’s response act rightly; those who do not receive Heaven’s response act wrongly. This is the great illumination of the Heavenly Bond’s verification and efficacy. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, and ask no more. Though I could recount for you all matters since Heaven and Earth established affairs—distinguishing each event and interpreting the world’s texts—the proliferation of writings would be too vast to record, and of no use to governance, offering no benefit to the king’s rule. Thus, I have only imparted the essential Dao in summary.\n\nFor when governance falls into disorder, it stems from the patterns of Heaven—this is the great affliction of Heaven and Earth, what the sages of old jointly despised. Therefore, when a virtuous ruler emerges through the Dao, he dares not create new writings but instead returns to the solid, seeks the root, and preserves the origin. Only then can the Dao of Heaven be ordered, and the state naturally find peace.\n\nThough you, Perfected One, are fond of inquiry, do not seek further proliferation of texts. Depart and reflect upon this.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n[Herein lies] the wrapping of primordial *qi*, the natural workings of Heaven and Earth, the near-matters of the three realms in communion—\nunited in strength, harmonized in purpose, the Heavenly Bond’s illumination, the royal way of Great Peace.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Eight, concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Nine: \"The Urgent Study of Perfected Methods,\" Chapter Sixty-Six.\n\nPerfected One, now the harmonious *qi* of goodness is about to arrive in full. Yet people wander without duties—how should they clarify their minds and rectify their intentions, so that they suddenly forget evil and daily grow fonder of goodness, never setting it aside? Thus may the Emperor sit with folded hands, nothing left to govern, while those of supreme goodness fill his court, and loyal, trustworthy, filial sons are all complete.\n\nHow is this to be achieved?\n\nPerfected One, you possess a Heaven-born nature that delights in goodness and constantly worries over the Dao of Heaven. You should now fully expound it yourself.\n\nSimply study with urgency—through the true Dao, true virtue, and true benevolence.\n\nWhy must one study the true Dao?\n\nThe Dao alone can guide and transform without limit, cherishing life beyond measure. Those who possess the true Dao bear the name of supreme goodness. Those without the Dao bear the most vile, withered, ominous, and transgressive name—death and ruin.\n\nPerfected One, your words on truth are excellent; I have nothing to add.\n\nWhy must one study true virtue?\n\nThose who possess true virtue can embrace and nurture the boundless. Those without virtue bear the name of the most feeble, impoverished, and petty. Excellent indeed are your words, Perfected One; I have nothing to add—truly, truly so.\n\nWhy must one study the Way of benevolence?\n\nThe benevolent can bestow loving-kindness without exclusion, delighting only in giving without end. Those who lack benevolence turn virtue into vice, hoarding and begrudging—bearing the name of the most greedy and base, their aspirations no different from beasts, with nothing to distinguish them.\n\nExcellent are your words, Perfected One; I have nothing to add.\n\nNow you have spoken of these three matters; I have nothing to add.\n\nShould people study to do good, or not?\n\nThey must strive to study goodness.\n\nDoes goodness not have a name and form?\n\nThis disciple is unworthy; may the Master enlighten me.\n\nThose who do good align with the heart of Heaven and do not oppose the will of others—this is called goodness. Goodness is utterly supreme, sharing the same name as the Dao. It is what Heaven loves, Earth nurtures, what emperors must urgently attend to, and what ministers and rulers must unite in purpose and strength to uphold.\n\nEvil opposes the heart of Heaven, constantly harms the will of others, rebels against the Dao of Heaven, and disrupts the four seasons. It is detested by spirits, shunned by people, the greatest harm to parents, the source of sorrow for the noble, and bears the most ominous name in the world—utter ruin.\n\nThus, in human conduct, losing good fortune leads to misfortune, and departing from misfortune leads to good fortune. One moment of good, one moment of evil—such are the ways of the impure and careless. Do you understand, disciple?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nIn your view, Perfected One, how should people conduct themselves?\n\nIf people do not diligently study the Dao, they will have no way to know it and will be called those without the Dao. Those without the Dao are the most wicked and ominous of people.\n\nIf they do not diligently study virtue, they will have no way to know it. Those who lack virtue and delight in harm and injury bear the mark of ruin.\n\nIf people do not diligently study benevolence, they become inhumane. The inhumane walk the same path as beasts; their hearts differ from beasts only slightly more than from the dead.\n\nIf people do not study goodness day and night, losing goodness leads to evil. Evil is the realm of death and misfortune. Thus, if people do not diligently study good fortune, they fall into misfortune—for misfortune bears the most detested name in the world.\n\nExcellent! You have deeply entered the true Dao and will not return to evil.\n\nPerfected One, you have long concealed wisdom and feigned ignorance. Why?\n\nI dared not act.\n\nYou are fortunate to have this ability. Fully express what you have said; I am greatly pleased.\n\nNow that you have reached this point, have you ever seen my words and then abandoned them halfway?\n\nI dare not.\n\nWhen the Master commands me to speak, if my understanding falls short, I dare not express it fully.\n\nExcellent, your words are always deeply humble.\n\nNow fully commit to the gate of truth; may the Heavenly Master instruct what I have not yet grasped.\n\nWhat you have just said is entirely correct.\n\nThus, the great sages of antiquity—the Three Sovereigns—studied the true Dao day and night. Those who did not study the true Dao were called people without the Dao. The conduct of those without the Dao is countless, a great and heavy resentment to Heaven. Those without the Dao are not desired by Heaven to be covered, nor by Earth to be borne. Spirits, gods, and ghosts do not wish to protect them; the world suffers because of them.\n\nThe noble, the worthy, and the gentlemen deeply detest those without the Dao.\n\nThus, in the time of the Upper Sovereign, people all studied purity and tranquility, deeply understanding the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth. Only after studying the true Dao did they gain the hearts of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who do not diligently study virtue are called people without virtue. Those without virtue are not loved by Heaven, not favored by Earth, and not desired by others to be near. Their conduct constantly fails to embody virtue, bringing harm to rulers and disaster to gentlemen. Ghosts and spirits, following Heaven’s decree, will not long govern with them.\n\nThus, the ancient worthy sages and great scholars, upon seeing those without virtue, would not even speak with them.\n\nIf one does not diligently study benevolence day and night, they will neglect affairs and become inhumane. The inhumane speak against all things, wound the hearts of others, and do not align with the will of Heaven. They resemble beasts, so the ancient sages and worthies would not walk the same path as them.\n\nIf people do not serve a teacher and diligently study goodness, they become foolish and ignorant, not knowing how to do good. Instead, they indulge their unknowing hearts and lightly commit evil.\n\nThe evil, the foolish, and the benighted act against the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Even if they serve as gentlemen, they bring shame to their parents, sorrow to their clans, and act lawlessly. Ghosts and spirits, following the heart of Heaven, are displeased and bring threefold harm to their place—such are those the law must punish.\n\nThe ancients and sages regarded this as a great grievance, so they thoroughly examined and verified their learning, aligning it with the heart of Heaven. Their affairs were rooted in the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and goodness alone. Their conduct had to accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth, never relying on frivolous or ornate words. The reason for this was that to lose the celestial law was to invite misfortune, premature death, or even harm to later generations. The Dao of Heaven is never mistaken; it has its standards and measures.\n\nThose who do not diligently study the greatly auspicious Dao but instead treat matters with carelessness and ease will surely fall into misfortune. Misfortune is detested by Heaven and Earth, by all people, and by the myriad things. It cannot endure long, for it is the root of great calamity, the gateway to disaster. Once one falls into it, death follows, and there is no return, no chance to repent or revert to the past. Though all under Heaven know this, the lesser scholars and the greatly foolish often mock the Dao, failing to guard it or early avoid harm. They pass down their folly, burdening one another, and each generation grows more benighted than the last. Thus, the true Dao becomes obstructed and impassable, leading people to treat it lightly and fail to fulfill their natural lifespans. The great fault and error arise from this.\n\nThose who encounter my writings should ponder them deeply. Take care not to conceal them but instead entrust them to the wise, the gentle, and the discerning, so that they may awaken. The ancient Dao, therefore, follows the heart of Heaven and accords with the will of Earth. There existed in high antiquity the great true Dao and its laws, which constantly taught people to study the Dao, cultivate virtue, seek longevity, embrace goodness, practice caution, pursue auspiciousness, emulate the ancients, and strive for peace and immortality.\n\nThe reason for exhaustively expounding goodness is that the law of Heaven always opens the gate of the Dao, and the law of Earth always opens the door of virtue. The laws of the ancient sages and worthies always opened the path of benevolence. Thus, the ancients and sages, sharing the heart of Heaven and aligning with the will of Earth, jointly nurtured the twelve thousand things, perpetually transmitting them through the intent of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Where such transmission thrives, the myriad things flourish. But if transmitted with malicious or evil intent, all things daily decline and diminish.\n\nWhere the Dao, virtue, and benevolence reside, people multiply and incline toward goodness. Where they are absent, people dwindle, and governance grows impoverished and bitter. This is the unchanging law of Heaven and Earth. Those who possess the utmost Dao, luminous virtue, and a heart of benevolence and goodness ascend to correspond with the celestial stars and calendars, their conduct illuminated by spirits and deities.\n\nThus, the ancients and sages constantly reflected on doing boundless good, exhausting their efforts so as not to dare harbor evil thoughts or tread the path of misfortune. The benighted, however, have hearts that are blocked and ignorant, incapable of further delusion. They are led astray onto the evil path of decline and misfortune, unaware of their great deviation from the Dao of Heaven. They follow one another in wrongdoing, making it their custom, unable to retreat or return.\n\nTherefore, I reverently received the celestial scriptures and teachings, complying with the heart of Heaven to open and expand the great path of high antiquity and Great Peace. This enables people to delight in goodness and no longer know the ways of evil. Yet the people of the world set their aspirations high, but their achievements often fall short, failing to match their original intentions.\n\nThus, the superior person, indignant at death and delighting in life, studies immortality and, through diligence, attains longevity. Such a person is the foremost of the determined. The middling person, also resolute, is grieved by the early deaths of their ancestors and, indignant, seeks the Dao to study longevity, striving to fulfill their natural lifespan. This is the foremost of the steadfast. Others, afflicted by frequent illness and unable to maintain even a modest state of well-being, study diligently to halt their suffering. If they can restore their former health, their illness was but a minor trial. If they study only when already gravely ill, seeking arts to save themselves, it is already too late—they are as good as dead.\n\nTherefore, my writings teach people the celestial methods of longevity, urging them to exert themselves day and night. Only then can they attain even a modest state of well-being. If one of modest attainment studies the ways of ordinary people, they have already entered misfortune. The foolish do not understand that the original aspirations of ordinary people under Heaven are to think highly of those better than themselves, yet they cannot fulfill their own aspirations. Thus, to elevate them highly, reaching the pinnacle of immortality, is merely to preserve their natural lifespan.\n\nThe greatly worthy set their minds on ten and achieve all ten, perfectly aligning with my writings on the Dao. The middling worthy set their minds on ten but may falter or grow lax, achieving only five. The petty person resolves in the morning but forgets by evening. Therefore, those who elevate greatly delight in enabling the superior, middling, and inferior to each attain their heart’s aspirations.\n\nNow, the people of the later ages are greatly foolish, far removed from the true Dao. If they study with the celestial standard of upright texts and methods, they merely avoid falling into deceit. If they study with texts of modest attainment, they are already greatly deceived. If they study with ornate words and fine speech, great falsehood and cunning arise.\n\nHeaven regards the emperor as its child and detests those below deceiving those above. When people below are full of deceit and perversity, the virtuous and benevolent ruler above has no one to trust, and the common people have nowhere to entrust their lives. To teach diligently day and night with the true Dao is merely to attain a modest Dao. To study with the modest Dao is already to enter frivolity. Entering frivolity, ordinary people become greatly deluded and impoverished, falling onto the path of great misfortune. The emperor is distressed, and the people cannot be governed.\n\nIf the true person wishes to know the truth of this, consider a family with loving parents who daily teach their children to do good. Though they endure hardship, denying themselves clothing and food to care for their elders, the children may still stubbornly persist in evil. How much more so for ordinary people, who are taught with frivolous and ornate texts? If they do not believe my writings, let those who encounter them reflect on their own failings.\n\nSince the middle antiquity, those who possessed the good Dao have taught one another to conceal and withhold it, refusing to transmit it to their disciples. Instead, they taught them with frivolous and false texts. Over time, this accumulation has led to the present great disorder in the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe calamities and portents of Heaven and Earth do not arise in vain. Let the worthy and learned deeply reflect upon this—though I do not dwell among the common folk from dawn to dusk, I have already seen this clearly. The world suffers grievously, and thus I set forth these writings to admonish those who are bound to them; I do not speak idly. True persons ought to treat this with utmost gravity, for there are the bonds of Heaven. \"Indeed, indeed, we dare not be careless.\" Whenever I hear the words of the Heavenly Master, I tremble with awe. \"Your words are true, and Heaven will rejoice greatly, sparing you from harm.\" \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThough ordinary people exert themselves day and night to study and cultivate true virtue, they may only attain mediocre virtue. Yet to study mediocre virtue is already to enter the path of false and deceptive virtue. To study false and deceptive virtue is to become as countless as the foolish, who, lacking true virtue, act wantonly—these are the very bandits of the noble person. Those who strive to learn and embody supreme benevolence may only achieve middling benevolence; to strive for middling benevolence is to act with mere mediocrity, devoid of true benevolence. To study without benevolence is to become a fool who turns to banditry, unaware of the countless lives they destroy. Acting recklessly, without principle, they incur the resentment of Heaven and the blame of Earth, becoming the greatest scourge of humanity.\n\nThose who exert themselves day and night to study the Way of great fortune may only attain middling fortune; to study middling fortune is to attain but minor fortune; to study minor fortune is already to enter the path of misfortune. To study the path of misfortune is beyond salvation—they plunge into utter darkness, knowing nothing. They dismiss the words of the Heavenly Dao as false, deceiving the purely faithful with reckless lies. Their foolish hearts speak madness, offending the patterns of Heaven above and disrupting the order of Earth below, bringing harm and disaster to the people.\n\nTherefore, when I teach the Dao through these writings, even ordinary people may study them diligently, aspiring to join the ranks of the true immortals. If they cannot attain the level of true immortals, they may still live in peace, sparing the virtuous ruler from worry. True persons ought to ponder my words deeply and not dismiss them as strange. \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow, as I speak on behalf of Heaven, I must fully expound the responsibility of *chengfu*—the karmic burden inherited since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Yet I cannot fully unfold the great methods of the supreme Dao and virtue, the arts of longevity, and the path of supreme goodness. People, lost in darkness, have long trusted their foolish and benighted hearts, turning to evil without restraint, unable even to comprehend the *chengfu*—the retribution and transgressions borne by Heaven and Earth. Do true persons understand my words? \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe sagely worthies and lofty scholars, upon seeing written texts and studying them, must align perfectly with the essence of my writings, not deviating even by a hair’s breadth. The middling scholar, with half-comprehending intent, will grasp half of it; the lesser scholar, through diligent effort, can avoid losing the method—thus does Heaven broadly raise its people. Common folk who delight in both high and low, without losing the method at the center, all attain the true Dao. Each cherishes themselves, daring not to treat matters lightly, sparing themselves great sorrow.\n\nThe superior scholar, having attained my Dao and studying it without cease, may become a worthy minister to the state. Over time, grasping its essential meaning, they can transcend the world, no longer engaging in disputes or lawsuits, viewing matters with discernment. The middling scholar, studying my Dao, may become a virtuous minor official and fulfill their natural lifespan. The petty person, studying my Dao, may cultivate lasting prudence: fathers are kind, mothers loving, children filial; elder brothers virtuous, younger brothers obedient; husbands and wives consult as one, never harming each other. Even unto death, no resentment lingers. Their souls, dwelling below, endure long, no longer seen to act wrongly or be called wicked. None die prematurely or suffer violent ends.\n\nIn ancient times, when the primordial qi first gave birth to Heaven, people all delighted in studying to become immortals, yet still could not attain longevity—only ensuring they each feared death and avoided criminal laws. But the people of later ages, profoundly foolish, instead recite florid and insubstantial teachings, studying arts that do not prolong life. In life, they act recklessly, claiming as if they will never die, teaching each other to hold nothing dear, jointly pursuing inauspicious affairs, treating funerals with greater care than births.\n\nLife belongs to Heaven; death belongs to Earth. To serve Earth by reversing Heaven’s order is a grave harm. I have observed this and know that their accumulated folly has endured so long that none remain wise. When inauspicious affairs arise, ghosts flourish, collectively hastening human deaths, preventing people from fulfilling their natural lifespans.\n\nThose who strive to study the true Dao may only attain a false one; those who strive to study true virtue may only attain a false virtue. How much worse, then, for the people of later ages who teach each other with florid texts—how far they have strayed from the Dao! Impoverished and unable to restrain one another, they instead teach the crafting of memorials and legal statutes, debating cleverly over right and wrong.\n\nTo teach them to be benevolent is already to fear they will not be so—yet now they are taught to study the path of malevolence. Heaven provides laws for humanity, naming itself the Great Dao; Earth names itself virtue. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. In all matters, rulers and elders constantly guide with goodness, never daring to open the way to teach malevolence—how much less should humans do so?\n\nHumans are the children of Heaven and ought to model their conduct after it. Yet now, having lost the method, people are difficult to govern. To instruct them in the Dao and virtue is to make them wise, self-respecting, self-cherishing, self-loving, and self-governing. Instead, they are opened to criminal laws, causing them to view death as fleeting, valuing brute strength and recklessness, passing down governance that entangles and oppresses them, leading to mutual harm and cycles of suffering. Thus, no one in the world loves another—the great fault lies here. Do true persons understand this? Be cautious. \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe forceful teaching of benevolence still struggles to overcome its absence; in later ages, people instead instruct one another in written arts, yet this has only grown more superficial, and their mutual hatred and resentment remain unbroken. The forceful teaching of auspiciousness still struggles to overcome inauspiciousness; in later ages, people instead compel one another to study the implements of death and mourning, preparing for misfortune in advance. They die before their time, nearly extinguishing their households, yet remain unaware of their errors. When the moment comes, they cry out to Heaven and wail to Earth, calling themselves wronged, blaming the ruler’s unjust governance for cutting short their years, while their own conduct has brought this upon them. Fools do not guard against the root; once guilt is determined, they regret, but regret is futile. Though they scream until death, it cannot be undone.\n\nThus, I now forcefully teach the great immortal scriptures of the Dao, merely opening the steps to longevity. When one studies virtue, only then can they attain benevolence; when one studies benevolence, only then can they attain tranquility and preserve what they have, no longer daring to deceive or seize others’ possessions. When one studies tranquility, they have already lost the method. When one studies the method, they have already lost the way of mutual harm. When one studies mutual harm, they have already entered great conflict. Once in great conflict, the people, though innocent, are deceived, and the destitute become thieves and bandits.\n\nTherefore, I uphold the Heavenly Dao’s method, opening the gate of great fortune and closing the path of malevolence. I open the steps to Heaven’s Great Peace, so that all may recite it, each exercising caution, leaving nothing to be governed. Thus, the turning of Heaven’s seasons proceeds, and the joyous ruler wanders without trouble. For this reason, my writings thoroughly examine the root of all matters; only then can their center be attained. Examining the center, one attains what lies below, but those who study like fools have already fallen into great chaos.\n\nThe reason why, in later ages, even emperors and kings with the virtue, benevolence, and wisdom of ten thousand people—though they strive to align with Heaven’s will—cannot end misfortune is that they bear the accumulated disasters and chaos of long-standing inherited burdens. Though they grieve and torment themselves, desiring joy, their governance breeds strange transformations: thieves and bandits of all kinds, barbarians invading the Central Kingdom—these are the failures of former kings, not the fault of one alone. One must deeply understand their root.\n\nThus, Heaven has sent forth my writings to absolve emperors and kings of the errors of inherited burdens. If true persons do not align my Dao with Heaven, they need only follow my texts without deviating by a hair’s breadth, and alignment will be established. My writings are greatly trustworthy; without diligent practice to untie the knots of grievance, how can the Heavenly Dao respond in silence?\n\nIf the foolish do not study, how can they become worthy? If the poor do not till, how can they reap? Study, and one becomes worthy day by day; till, and one reaps day by day. Practice my writings, and it will be the same. I assure you: without study, do not seek worthiness; without tilling, do not seek harvest. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe true Dao is upright; great virtue flourishes with benevolence, and each attains their proper place. In governance and peace, nothing is lost. Do true persons understand? Those who wish to repay Heaven and Earth’s grace and attain longevity must strive to trust the Dao without slackening. Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow, if the foolish wish to ask further, they dare not speak hastily. Proceed calmly.\n\nHow does the Heavenly Master know when a person utterly lacks virtue, benevolence, and humanity?\n\nExcellent is your question. Observe their conduct and words. I wish to hear it.\n\nThus: when one sees a Daoist and reacts with anger, rejecting them, one knows them as a person utterly devoid of the Dao. When one sees virtue and reviles it, one knows them as a person utterly devoid of virtue. When one sees benevolence and rejects it, one knows them as a person utterly lacking in benevolence. When one sees goodness and caution and rejects them, one knows them as a person who is neither good nor cautious.\n\nBy nature, those of like minds love one another, while those of differing minds hate one another. Good people also suffer from the wicked, and the wicked also suffer from the good. Do true persons understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIn ancient times, sages and worthies, upon seeing someone, did not immediately speak with them. They simply observed carefully, noting their likes and dislikes, and thus knew them. Using this as a mirror for their conduct, they were never mistaken. Excellent!\n\nThus, the Dao shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as August Heaven; when the heavenly Dao abhors evil and delights in killing, to oppose Heaven is to incur profound enmity. The earth shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as virtue; when evil persons inflict harm, to oppose the earth is to invite great calamity. Benevolence shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as sages and worthies; thus, sages and worthies delight in bestowing benevolence and detest seizing by force, and to oppose the benevolent and sagely is to make them one’s mortal foe.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old deeply understood that these were the three norms upheld by the Three Powers. Thus, in establishing their laws, they dared not deviate from the true Dao, virtue, or benevolence. Heaven’s workings join forces with the four seasons: as Heaven moves qi, so too do the four seasons move qi, acting in unison with one heart. Thus, to go against the four seasons is to incur Heaven’s enmity. The earth joins hearts and forces with the Five Phases, together nurturing all things; when beings are harmed before their allotted time of death, this invites great calamity from the earth. Sages and worthies join hearts and forces with benevolence; thus, in their travels and dwellings, they ever honor the Dao and esteem virtue, relying on benevolence in their conduct. If one delights in seizing by force and lacks benevolence, this makes one an enemy of the sagely and worthy.\n\nFire is the heart, and the heart is sagely. Thus, fire ever dwells leaning upon wood. Wood is benevolent and possesses a heart; fire possesses light and can discern right and wrong. The heart is sagely and luminous. Therefore, the great sages and worthies of old ever dwelled leaning upon benevolence and clarity, returning to rulers of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity.\n\nThus, I earnestly admonish the true person, entrusting this book to rulers of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity. They must delight in and cherish my Dao, deeply comprehend its meaning, follow and emulate it, and become indistinguishable from the divine. I do not praise myself to the true person; only when practice yields response, perfectly aligning like compass and square, will later generations heed my words. Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, exert yourselves and strive, diligently study Dao, virtue, and benevolence. There is nothing else worth doing. Take out this book and do not allow it to be hidden away. Indeed, indeed.\n\nHere ends the *Exposition on Illuminating the Hearts of the Worthy to Dispel the Darkness of the Ignorant and Resolve Doubts*, from the forty-ninth scroll of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.\nHere begins the fiftieth scroll of the *Scripture of Great Peace*.\n\n**The Sixty-Seventh Scripture: The Flying Luminance of Ancient Secrets for Dispelling the Deviant**\n\nThe Sixfold Perfected One, pure in essence, bows twice with reverence and respectfully inquires of the August Divine Person who seeks the True: I wish to make Heaven and Earth peaceful, yin and yang undisturbed, ever proceeding in harmony, so that calamities do not arise recklessly, and the king may daily wander in governance, composing the scripture of great joy. Though the questions posed above and below are many, how could they be heard repeatedly?\n\nExcellent indeed! Profound are your questions, how penetrating and insightful! You have asked precisely at this crucial juncture—do you wish to advance toward the Perfect Dao and dispel the deviant texts?\n\nYes.\n\nNow I shall explain all. You have accumulated goodness in Heaven; how could I dare conceal it? Today, out of deep regard for your virtue, I shall exhaust the intentions of the divine and luminous. If I do not speak and act, I fear I would contravene the will of Heaven. Since Heaven has indeed prompted you to seek and inquire, I shall distinguish and expound for you. Follow along and record it; take care not to omit anything.\n\nIf the emperor and kings exert themselves to employ this scripture, all calamities will be eradicated in a single day. The world will rejoice as one, all desiring to become scholars of Dao and virtue. Later generations will emulate their forebears, the old and young rising together, all coming to know and seek the verification of true texts. Superficial embellishments will vanish, and the heart will thoroughly harmonize with the divine and numinous. The ruler will have no single worry—why should he not daily wander in joy?\n\nThus, all matters under Heaven and Earth will find their proper place, the hundred spirits rejoicing in consequence. The king will deeply align with the will of Heaven, and the Perfect Dao will come to his aid. There will be daily auspiciousness, not a single inauspicious event. My words are true and steadfast, not erring even once in ten thousand instances. Yet I fear that though obtained, they may not be practiced, for the multitude of deviant influences may obstruct them.\n\nCalamities and anomalies, superficial embellishments—these are the grave maladies of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. If a grave malady is left untreated, how can it be resolved and cured? Since you have come to inquire about these matters, I speak for Heaven. Ponder carefully the words above and below in this scripture. Should you chance upon its profound intent, take care not to disorder it.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nOnce you return to a fitting place, day and night reflect upon it. Having received and recorded it, repeatedly elucidate and annotate it, hoping that it may endure for ten thousand generations without end.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, speech, writing, and texts have followed one another in succession. Matters of the same qi illuminate one another by kind. Seek their kind and gather them, and the Dao will daily become more manifest, never declining.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, the multitude of sages have together discoursed for Heaven, and the multitude of worthies have harmonized their words, jointly devising sagely plans. The emperor and kings are Heaven’s noble children. As children inheriting their father’s teachings, they ought to follow and enact them, thereby dispelling the worries of Heaven and Earth and receiving their protection.\n\nTherefore, reflect upon and exert yourselves in these words.\n\nMy Dao—ah! When you perceive matters, whether awakened or not, Heaven and Earth, the divine and luminous, will require the seeking of countless, myriad, thousandfold, hundredfold, tenfold, and single matters, all of which must correspond before they may be deemed reliable. If they do not correspond, urgently seek again. Among their kindred and comparable instances, if even one does not correspond, that is the truth.\n\nAll matters should be thus. How can one ascertain their correspondence? Correspondence is when, upon inward reflection in the heart, there is outward resonance with the spirits and deities, near and far moving in accord. When divining matters and verifying them below, that which responds is true. That which does not correspond—all such explanations are false.\n\nTake care not to speak recklessly, lest you leave no legacy for later generations. The reason is this: reckless speech and false words leave no legacy and cannot be employed for long, thus depriving people of posterity.\n\nAs the governance of the Dao daily declines, perverse and contrary words proliferate—these are truly not so. All such words disrupt the celestial patterns and terrestrial principles, failing to align with the hearts of sages. The spirits cannot be employed thus.\n\nTherefore, one who speaks ought first to reflect inwardly upon human sentiments, and only then should the heart harmonize outwardly, thoroughly aligning with the spirits and deities. This is the means by which to grasp success and failure, the admonitions of celestial patterns.\n\nAccumulate texts and arrange them by kind, assembling the multitude of worthies to compile them. Select from among them those that correspond tenfold, aligning with the hearts of people and the spirits, to form the text. Together, settle upon its meaning, and test it by verifying below. Only thus will it be unalterable for ten thousand generations.\n\nVerification means that when divining matters, there is a response, and when enacting them, the response is realized. Only then can it be established as a canonical method of Heaven, the very means by which to regulate and stabilize yin and yang, the great art of pacifying the king.\n\nThis is how to transform misfortune into blessing, prolonging the lives of the people. Why is this so? When the celestial patterns and terrestrial principles are correct, yin and yang each find their proper place. When yin and yang each find their proper place, the spirits and deities rejoice greatly. When the spirits and deities rejoice, they protect the people. Thus, the emperor and kings enjoy long-lasting peace, and the people live long.\n\nCan one not exert oneself diligently in this?\n\nThe Flying Luminance refers to the lesser of the Three Luminaries, all connected to the earth below and suspended above in the heavens. Their movements harmonize with the people, creatures, and all things of the earth—this is the proof of essential texts. When the written texts divining matters correspond a hundredfold, tenfold, and tenfold again, that is the truth. That which does not correspond and harmonize is false.\n\nBy this standard, measure and balance them. All deviant texts and writings will be entirely eradicated. Examine past events to verify present ones. Follow what Heaven permits, observe what Heaven may favor—do not disrupt the celestial patterns. Joining forces with Heaven, this may be called perpetual auspiciousness.\n\nHeaven can only be followed, not opposed. Seize upon what may be advantageous and employ it, and the people will flourish. To oppose it is to cause the people to decline, losing the will and intent of Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-Eighth Scripture: Verifying Correspondences in Relocation and Movement**\n\nAll texts concerning relocation and movement are the celestial scriptures of Heaven’s course. When yin and yang intersect and unite, the celestial patterns are complete. The emperor, the people, and the myriad things all proceed according to their principles. Those who grasp their intent are auspicious; those who lose it are wholly inauspicious.\n\nMatters have their reversals and sequences—one cannot but be cautious and deliberate in examining them. To ascertain their truth, test them with twenty-five instances of fivefold matters. Select twenty-five past events and twenty-five households of current affairs. Carefully record the year, day, month, and hour from which they originate, and to which of the five tones they belong. Divining auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, verify that which corresponds a hundredfold, tenfold, and tenfold again—that is the truth.\n\nWhen this is examined and the principles of Heaven and Earth are securely established, the ruler acts without doubt. The people and ministers do not lose their proper roles, and the myriad things each attain their rightful place. If matters do not conform to what this text declares, they are the writings of chaos and deceit and must not be employed.\n\nMeasured by the standard of ascent, those who dare use texts that mislead others will leave no descendants in later generations. The reason is this: such texts harm the people and disrupt the proper divisions of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth govern life, yet men invert their yin and yang, thus causing those who use such texts to be without posterity. In ancient times, before such writings existed, Heaven reversed their course. After the *Celestial Patterns* emerged, all understood the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Those who knowingly violated it met with early death and misfortune—this is the very proof.\n\nWhen applied with harmonious resonance among kin, the Five Peaks and ten thousand *li* respond in kind. Through concentrated and meticulous contemplation, matters of goodness summon good responses, and matters of baseness summon base ones. Their quantity and rank, high or low, never err by even one part in ten thousand. Regularly tested with the twenty-five *qi* of fivefold cycles, they correspond to twenty-five households and twenty-five hills. When the text’s hundredfold and tenfold correspondences align, it is the *earthly prognostication*. When their *qi* combine, they are as kin to the land. Their people share the same likes and dislikes. Moreover, creatures of all kinds—birds, beasts, grasses, and trees—form categories of their own. This is the land of shared *qi*. By this clear distinction, the earth’s correspondences are verified. Where there are no aquatic *qi* among kin, their fish and turtles form their own kind. Using this as the basis for divination, and distinguishing their origins, the nature of all things and all affairs can be known. Those with identical images share identical forms; those with differing images have differing forms—right and wrong are determined precisely thus.\n\n**Vermilion Radiance for Warding Off Evil, Method Sixty-Nine**\n*Vermilion Radiance* refers to the celestial inscribed texts, which can rectify wrongs and ward off evil. When tenfold correspondences bring healing, it is because the celestial writings align with the true spirit-officials—this is the proof of their efficacy. When nineteen correspondences bring healing, it is because the earthly writings harmonize with the yin spirits. When eighteen correspondences bring healing, it is the harmony of human writings. Tested by this standard, all other texts are deceptive and must not be used. These are the writings that invite evil. Only those that align with the spirits are valid; those that fail to heal mislead people and cannot save lives.\n\nSome texts, though authored by spirits or gods, bring healing in ways that cannot be known. Such a person’s fate and allotted years become the chief of evil, and others cannot use their writings. Should such texts proliferate through mass carving, are they not deceptive? They should be carved and then cast into uninhabited wilderness. These texts must be sought one by one and cannot be obtained hastily.\n\n**Methods of Herbs and Trees, Method Seventy**\nHerbs and trees possess virtue and the Dao, and those with official ranks can be commanded—these are called *herbal methods*, referring to the divine herbs and trees. Those that heal swiftly are the divine herbs of Heaven, though they grow upon the earth. Those that extend life are the immortal herbs of Heaven, though they grow upon the earth. Those that heal decisively are called *decisive healing methods*. Those that heal in a single day are called *one-day healing methods*, and their hundredfold and tenfold correspondences confirm their efficacy.\n\nThese herbs and trees possess spirit and can be commanded, for they are herbs and trees with official ranks. Those with tenfold correspondences that heal are the herbs of emperors; those with nineteen correspondences are the herbs of great ministers; those with eighteen correspondences are the herbs of the people. Those below this standard must not be used, for they are herbs that mislead. This is the art of saving life and death—it must not be examined carelessly.\n\nWhen a method combines herbs and brings swift healing, record the herbs and call it a *decisive healing method*. If it heals in one day, call it a *one-day healing method*; if in two days, a *two-day method*; if in three days, a *three-day method*. The *one-day healing method* is administered by celestial spirits; the *two-day healing method* by earthly spirits; the *three-day healing method* by human ghosts. Those that do not conform to this are not celestial spirit methods but rely solely on the herbs’ natural properties, sometimes healing and sometimes not—these are called *waiting-for-death methods*. Be cautious, be exceedingly cautious. This is the art of saving lives and must not be treated lightly or without thorough examination.\n\n**Methods of Living Creatures, Method Seventy-One**\nLiving creatures that act with essence—such as flying birds, walking beasts, and crawling things—can heal illnesses. Birds carry the divine medicines of Heaven within them, sent by Heaven to move in circular and square patterns. Those that heal with tenfold correspondences contain the celestial spirit methods within them; those that heal with nineteen correspondences contain the earthly essence methods; those that heal with eighteen correspondences contain the balanced human essence and divine medicines.\n\nThese three are the methods of Heaven, Earth, and the harmony of yin and yang, called the *healing envoys*. They are like a person of the Dao who is called an envoy—a divine person, a divine master. These are sent by the essences of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, and when their tenfold and hundredfold correspondences bring healing, they are the divine methods of emperors and supreme sovereigns. Those that heal with nineteen correspondences are the divine methods of kings and marquises; those that heal with eighteen correspondences are the divine methods of great ministers, commoners, and reclusive scholars of utmost virtue.\n\nEach has its appointed emergence. Observed thus, not one in ten thousand errs. These three kinds act as divine medicines of Heaven, Earth, and humanity to heal illnesses. Heaven commands each to receive the mandate of their ancestors and embody their natural arts, which they cannot abandon. This is like the phoenix and qilin, which bear virtue upon their bodies; or like bees and scorpions, which bear poison upon theirs—this is what is meant.\n\nOne must deeply understand the essential intent of the Dao of Heaven to clarify the nature of the celestial Dao, which benefits the ruler’s governance and prevents people from being deluded. Without knowing these essential texts, to claim that all writings under Heaven can be used is mistaken.\n\nThus, those scoring seventeen or below are all deviant, failing to correspond with the three auspicious signs, and their harm runs deep. Therefore, those who err in one out of ten treatments do not align with the intent of Heaven; those who err in two out of ten do not align with the intent of Earth; those who err in three out of ten do not align with the intent of humanity. Those who err in six or seven out of ten or more bring about chaotic governance. Yin and yang grow discordant, and spirits engage in strife.\n\nFor this reason, the sage kings and divine rulers of antiquity, though dwelling in secluded chambers, deeply pondered the intent of Heaven’s heart to preserve themselves and attain long life. My writings, with their interconnected phrases above and below, are arranged as texts. When the wise and enlightened read them to complement one another, this rescues the lost and confused, allowing people to enjoy enduring fortune while avoiding misfortune. Each should reflect morning and evening on these essential meanings to preserve their well-being.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, when the common people sing children’s songs and poems, it is Heaven’s transformations that move them to speak. When divine texts emerge in their time, Heaven transmits their discourse to those of utmost virtue to remedy the world’s errors. The Way of Heaven detests killing and cherishes life; all creatures that creep and move possess awareness. None should be lightly killed or harmed without cause. If transformation can be achieved through means other than harm, one must first exhaust those methods before resorting to force.\n\nThus, the myriad things flourish, their lives bound to Heaven, their roots in Earth, and their proper use resting with humanity. Those who align with Heaven’s intent live long, while those who lose it perish. All things exist in constancy with Heaven and Earth, with humanity as their sovereign. Those who rule as sovereigns over humanity must be meticulous and thorough in their deliberations.\n\n**Discarding Florid Ornamentation, Section Seventy-Two**\nTo grasp the essential meaning of all Daoist texts and scriptures, one must take each word as a complete unit. For instance, what is *jiazi*? When placed before a group, let one person explain its fundamental meaning, while the assembled wise collectively debate and expound upon it. Some may specialize in the intent of celestial patterns, expounding upward to thoroughly explore the Way of Heaven. Others may excel in geography, expounding downward to fully investigate the Way of Earth. Still others may focus on external matters, exploring the four directions to their limits. Some may sit and discourse, delving into the center. Others may trace the origins of affairs, excelling in the essence of the myriad things, thereby mastering them. Some may delve into the internal, others into the external. Once the roots, branches, foundations, blossoms, and leaves are all revealed, they are categorized and named by their likenesses.\n\nThe essential intent of all affairs, the writings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, can thus be glimpsed in outline. With head and feet complete, upper and lower connected, and the natural order of things established, their meanings are harmonized, and each records their discourse. The worthy are gathered to form a unified explanation. Therefore, when the sage seeks the intent of Heaven’s heart to regulate and stabilize yin and yang, bringing peace to the ruler and tranquility to the world, all spirits rejoice in unison.\n\nThus, the radiant insights of the many wise are woven together to establish enduring laws that cannot be altered for ten thousand generations. The reason the intent of Heaven’s Way is lost today lies in this: the words of a single worthy, though penetrating one aspect, cannot illuminate all. They cannot traverse the six directions or thoroughly investigate the seven realms within and without, nor can they trace the essence of the myriad things. Hence, their explanations diverge, causing the original texts of Heaven’s writings to lose their foundation, leading to confusion and delusion—this is the crux of the matter.\n\nFor all matters one wishes to rectify, each has a root that can be exhaustively explored. Yin and yang do not reverse their order; all should proceed thus. Otherwise, it is called an isolated or singular opinion, failing to grasp the scriptures’ intent. Following the words of one person alone is termed a biased view. The nature of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully comprehended by anyone but the sage. Thus, when such a one speaks, internally they cannot fathom the heart of Heaven, and externally they cannot interpret celestial patterns or illuminate geography. Their divinations miss the mark, spirits do not heed them, and they lose the correct path, straying into delusion. This is what is meant by pursuing florid ornamentation, failing to grasp the root and essential intent. The fault lies here, causing the unadorned to lose their foundation.\n\nWhen the Way of Heaven loses its rectitude, yin and yang internally generate illness, discord arises, and harmful qi proliferates. The ruler grows anxious and distressed, unable to restrain their heart, and calamitous qi arises in succession. The people do not live long, and this is the gravest misfortune. When the wise collectively lose the heart of Heaven and drift far from the sage’s teachings, they cannot attain proper order—this is called a chaotic Way.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that all scriptures and records of the Daoist Way are interwoven, forming the discourse of Heaven and Earth. The head and origin of all affairs are the foundation of the spirits. Therefore, those who grasp the original intent prevent spirits from engaging in strife and harming people. Evil qi is sealed away, banditry ceases, and when bandits and thieves are suppressed, the barbarians retreat and submit. Wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons—this is the clear sign of Heaven’s joy. When Heaven is pleased, it cherishes its children. Thus, the ruler’s life is prolonged, and their blessings flow to the people, extending to the six domestic animals, birds, beasts, and even reaching the grasses and trees. Harmonious qi appears in full, evil qi dissipates, and the correct qi grows ever brighter—this is the natural method of yin and yang.\n\nIt is like the day’s affairs being conducted in daylight, while at night they are concealed; when petty men flee, the noble proceed. Reflect upon these words, for they benefit life, clarify yin and yang, and expound upon the spirits. If you doubt my writings, test the Way to discern its success or failure. Now, take a single character and place it before a group, letting the many wise debate and expound upon it. When their interpretations differ and their explanations vary, it becomes clear that the words of one person are not enlightened. How then can they regulate yin and yang and allow the ruler to wander carefree in joy?\n\nThus, those who grasp the root are few, while those who expound are many—there is nothing that cannot be exhausted. When those who grasp the root are many and those who expound are few, the Way becomes superficial and shallow. If this shallowness persists unchecked, chaos ensues. If chaos persists unchecked, yin and yang grow displeased, and evil qi arises.\n\nThus, the sage-kings must honor the root, and the noble person rectify the beginning—then nothing will fail to be ordered. If they do not honor and exalt the root, nor rectify the beginning, then all affairs lose their discipline, the myriad things fall into chaos, and order cannot be restored. Refine and clarify this, and delusion, the perverse Way, and heterodox writings will depart.\n\n**Celestial Patterns and Secret Formulas, Scroll Seventy-Three**\n\nHeaven and Earth possess constant laws, not erring by even a fraction. Distant and near all share the same images; qi of like kind respond to one another, not failing in even one of ten thousand cases. This is called *Celestial Patterns*, also named *Celestial Writings*. Countless billions, thousands of thousands, hundreds of hundreds, tens of tens—whether twelve days complete one cycle of the *zi* branch, or twelve years, sixty years, or one hundred twenty years, each is likewise a cycle of the *zi*. Some align after a hundred million *zi*, some after ten thousand, some after a thousand, some after a hundred, some after ten—all akin to the *jia-zi*. Though their qi differs, their affairs differ, their words differ, their songs and poems differ, though all are *jia-zi*, their qi has not yet completed its cycle, hence the difference. By their kind and image they are named; good and ill share the same qi, same words, same affairs—this constitutes one cycle.\n\nCarefully examining and uniting these reveals how to understand the ancient and thereby know the present, and how to know the present and thereby revisit and clarify the ancient. This is how one knows the constant movement of Heaven, how to distinctly and thoroughly comprehend the principles of yin and yang. If the written words are mistaken or their sequence awry, they should be supplemented by one another; when the songs, sounds, and affairs all align, this is what is called the great cycle, the middle cycle, and the small cycle. Grasping their meaning, ordering their affairs, and thereby harmonizing yin and yang to bring peace to the ruler—this is how one emulates the constant laws of Heaven’s writings.\n\nIt is like spring, autumn, winter, and summer, which do not err. Yet those born later all rely on brief lifespans and have not witnessed even one full cycle—how can they know that within the great, middle, and small cycles there are three cycles? Do the ancient constant spiritual Ways still exist? Thus, they lose the correct path, glimpsing only fleeting moments, and lacking thorough understanding of the divine writings of past and present, they follow partial words and claim their own correctness. It is like a child born in spring who dies before autumn, never witnessing autumn’s affairs, or one born in summer who perishes before winter, never witnessing winter’s affairs. Those who speak only ever see what lies before their eyes, and though ten eloquent debaters may argue, they remain ignorant, inwardly unconvinced.\n\nIf celestial patterns fail to manifest, it is precisely because they are correct. Thus, affairs do not appear in vain; at times there are writings of order and chaos. The Way does not emerge in vain; the times and fate decree it. Therefore, the works of ancient poets all flow from Heaven’s qi, ensuring their words are not empty. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, acted in accordance with their tasks, following the qi, and thereby attaining Heaven’s will—hence their long-lasting good fortune. To oppose it brings floods and droughts, qi in discord and conflict, accumulating disasters and unceasing anomalies, called calamities and portents. The many wise grow confused, unaware that it is merely opposing the qi and failing to follow the demands of the times—this cannot but be treated with the utmost caution.\n\nHeaven’s purpose in leaving writings for later generations is that those born earlier know longevity, understand the natural, and enter the Way of emptiness and stillness—thus they know the cycles of Heaven’s Way, which resemble the constancy of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Later generations, their qi long dissipated, their learning shallow, grow distant from the essential Way and its writings, forgetting the teachings of former and present times. Unless one is a divine sage, none can foresee the completion of a cycle. Therefore, Heaven repeatedly generates writings to be recorded and transmitted, so that past and present may mutually rely upon one another, desiring that they know and thereby secure themselves.\n\nEncountering great peace, one may govern while resting at ease. Encountering moderate peace, one may strive to act. Encountering disorder, one may use the Way to aid and prepare oneself. It is like preparing for heat at the summer solstice and cold at the winter solstice—this is the meaning. Heaven’s Way moves in constant cycles, not favoring the ancients. Thus, following it brings prosperity and flourishing; opposing it brings peril and ruin.\n\nWhen Heaven’s Way wages war, its mandate is harmed; the sun and moon lose their measure, and the constellations move in chaos. Knowing to follow the seasonal qi, the sun and moon keep their measure, and the constellations move in order—this is Heaven’s clear proof. Those who can apply this must exert themselves, daring not to conceal or hoard, and must take care not to harm or injure. Heaven’s secret writings are entrusted to the benevolent and worthy, to illuminate above and below and enable self-security.\n\n**Moxibustion and Acupuncture Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Four**\n\nMoxibustion and acupuncture serve to regulate and harmonize the three hundred and sixty meridians, the qi of yin and yang, thereby eliminating harm. The three hundred and sixty meridians correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of a year, with each meridian governing its day, moving in accord with the four seasons and five phases, circulating externally throughout the body and converging at the crown of the head, while internally connecting to the viscera. Their waxing and waning shift with the four seasons; when illness arises, they fail to correspond, their cycles and movements become irregular—knotting, injuring, flowing smoothly, or rebelling—thus requiring treatment.\n\nMoxibustion is the essence of *Taiyang*, the clarity of impartial justice, used to discern deceit and eradicate harm. Acupuncture is the essence of *Shaoyin*, the radiance of *Tai Bai*, employed with righteousness to sever and subdue. When treatment is one hundred percent effective in a hundred cases, or ten out of ten, this aligns with the celestial meridian prophecies of the *Chen* texts, truly resonating with the meridians, and the spirits are thus commanded. When nine out of ten are cured, with one failure, this resonates with the yin meridians, and essence is commanded. When eight out of ten are cured, this is the way of human texts, guided by human intention. Below this standard, illness cannot be treated; instead, it may harm the spirit.\n\nIf the *Jia* meridian is afflicted yet the *Yi* is treated, this is called confusion, for the meridian is uniquely injured and severed. Thus, to discern whether the celestial way is spiritually efficacious or not, whether it corresponds or not, simply place a patient before you—this is the meridian’s root text, akin to the foundational text of the Daoist scriptures. Gather many worthy ones to discuss the illness: some may excel in the upper body, others in the lower; each of the three hundred and sixty meridians has its observable aspects. Record the methods of those whose treatments consistently succeed in ten out of ten cases—these are correct; all others are not. Compile the successful treatments into a scripture, and there will be no unresolved formulae in what is treated.\n\nThe celestial way governs the meridians, whether externally or internally, yet it cannot be fully known. Where treatment succeeds in ten out of ten cases, that is where the meridians converge. Though people vary in size, with differing measurements, their proportions remain the same, and one must rely on the divisions of *Dan* and *Pi* to achieve correspondence. Daoist texts, accumulated over time from diverse sources, are called \"chaotic meridians.\" Treating yin when yang is disordered reverses the cure, bringing misfortune upon people, harming the innocent, and shortening lives.\n\nThe meridians resonate with heaven, earth, and the myriad things, rising with the qi and cycling back to their origin. Those who grasp their patterns may thereby cultivate their nature and discern the arrival of seasonal qi. If there is disharmony, they restore balance. In ancient times, sages and worthies sat in pure stillness, palpating their own meridians, observing the cycles and movements of their pulses to know the gains and losses of the four seasons and five phases, thereby understanding the waxing and waning of their own bodies. This is how they secured the state, nurtured life, and preserved their forms—how could one not be cautious?\n\nThose who are deluded by indiscriminate moxibustion and acupuncture injure the proper meridians, harm the correct qi, and disrupt the four seasons and five phases, bringing forth calamities and anomalies. The great are greatly harmed, the small are slightly harmed, and all may be moved or unsettled—this is the natural course of things. Thus, the ancient sages and worthies held these practices in high regard. The sage emperors and kings observed the movements of the meridians to divine the auspices of the six directions—this is what is meant by \"knowing the distant through the near, the external through the internal,\" and thus it is called the divine and essential way.\n\n**Divine Incantations Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Five**\n\nIn the heavens, there are constant divine and sagely essential words, periodically bestowed upon people for use, dispatching spirit-officials to respond to the qi and come and go. The people who receive them call them \"divine incantations.\" When incantations cure a hundred out of a hundred, or ten out of ten, they are the transmitted scriptural words of the celestial divine texts. Only those incantations that can summon the spirits’ trust, cure illnesses, and consistently succeed in ten out of ten cases are used—there is no direction in which they do not heal. Simply using words to cure illness is the divine prophecy of the heavens.\n\nThese are what good teachers and emperors should employ, compiled into scrolls and named the *Incantation Prophecy Scriptures*. They serve to summon the host of spirits, hence their tenfold efficacy. When nine out of ten are cured, the true spirits do not arrive, but lesser spirits do, and great ministers possess them. When eight out of ten are cured, human spirits arrive, and officials possess them. These are the words of the celestial spirits, originally meant to summon them. Their names and times occasionally leak down to earth, and Daoists who learn of them transmit them to one another, thus enabling the treatment of illness. Like sending a messenger with words, they cannot cure illness.\n\nIn matters of change, one cannot rely on others even for a moment. Heaven values human life, fearing that rare methods are difficult to perfect quickly, and that great physicians may lose the meridian scriptures, failing to comprehend matters of life and death. Thus, the essential way is placed in people’s mouths—this is the art of emergency relief. To obtain these essential words, simply place a patient before you as the root text of the incantation, and let each recite their secret oral formulae. If the illness is immediately cured, it is genuine; otherwise, it is entirely false, the response of deceptive and reckless words, and cannot be taken as a model.\n\nSome incantations may cure when used alone, yet others fail to achieve the same effect—such words cannot be recorded. These are the leaders of ghosts and spirits, naturally employed by people, called \"solitary words,\" not the true way of summoning spirits. Though people and heaven are distant, how can one discern whether the way is true or not? That which is true or false corresponds and harmonizes, fitting like tallying tokens—this is genuine; otherwise, it is not.\n\n**Burial and Residence Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Six**\n\nBurial is the original hillside dwelling of one’s ancestors, called the initial planting of roots. A residence is the earth to which the hun and po souls should return. If the land is auspicious, the souls return to nurture the descendants; if inauspicious, they return to harm them. When the qi of the five ancestors is exhausted, they are reborn as people.\n\n**The Dao of Heaven and the Efficacy of Earth, Chapter Seventy-Six**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven follows the law by which qi circulates and returns to its origin. To discern the efficacy of earth, plant a small, humble seed in the soil; if later days bring flourishing growth and great goodness, it is a land of great vitality. If a fine seed is planted yet later days yield evil, it is a land of inversion. If daily fortunes wane and diminish, it is a land of depletion. Test this with twenty-five families’ burial mounds and hills: if ten, a hundred, or a thousand correspond in harmony, these are the texts of the *Treasured Writ of Earth’s Yin*. If nineteen correspond, it is the *Treasured Record of Earth’s Yin*. If eighteen correspond, it is the *Disordered Writ of Earth*—unfit for regular use. Anything below this is heretical script, harmful writings of the common folk. To verify their truth, record past events and compare them with later outcomes; only then will true and false be distinguished. Know that my writings are like Heaven’s *jia* and Earth’s *yi*, unalterable for ten thousand generations. The root matters of burial and residence, where human life is nurtured, must not be treated lightly. Once affairs are settled carelessly, heretical writings bring harm, causing disasters and misfortunes to arise frequently, bringing great suffering to the worthy and the people. Thus, whether noble or humble, those who wish their descendants to inherit in perpetuity must carefully examine the hills and mounds, clearly discern their principles, and divine future events. Take twenty-five burial mounds as the foundational text, compare them with past events, and record the outcomes to validate present and future affairs. True masters should study these writings closely, dispelling confusion and delusion—this is called the *Divination of Yin’s Concealment*, which discerns how ancestors benefit their descendants, transmitting blessings for ten thousand generations. Guard this well and do not conceal it.\n\n**Discerning the True and False in Ancient Writings, Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n\nAll music serves to convey sound and transform the qi of the six directions and eight extremes. When its tones harmonize, responses come in accord with goodness; when they do not, responses arrive in conflict and opposition. Each sound has its own affiliation—east, west, south, north, *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*—and the twenty-five qi each have their own domain. At times, sounds converge to form coherent phrases, allowing one to perceive subtle words through listening, divining fortune and misfortune. When music aligns with the *Blowing-Hair Pitch-Pipe*, the tones of strings are known. The five notes—*gong*, *shang*, *jue*, *zhi*, and *yu*—distinguish the six directions’ distances and define the auspicious or inauspicious nature of names. How so? Only the refined can perceive the spirits’ responses to events. Thus, the sages of antiquity regulated music to move all things, harmonize yin and yang, and stabilize the four seasons and five phases. When yin and yang are balanced, the sounds are pleasing to hear; when they are disharmonious, discordant and chaotic, the music is harsh, and the strings must be tuned. The silk strings should be arranged in nine-by-nine sequences, with loud and soft sounds in harmony, so as not to harm the viscera and spirit. If untuned, the dance becomes disorderly, the music loses its proper tone, and it cannot be endured, injuring the viscera and spirit—thus, numinous beings and auspicious omens do not appear. Only those who are capable and skilled in sound can harmonize yin and yang’s transformations. How is this known? When the divine and numinous respond, auspicious omens gather—such is the person. Otherwise, all is chaotic noise, incapable of moving anything, and thus no response comes. Therefore, all matters depend on finding the right person. Without the right person, even the divine is as unreliable as reckless speech. With the right person, no matter is too difficult or easy—all can be accomplished. Without the right person, no matter is too great or small—none can be done. Thus, the sages of antiquity valued action and sought the worthy without concealment, as was the way of old. With the right person, order prevails; without them, chaos reigns.\n\nAncient writings are too numerous to record in full. Use one matter to analogize ten, ten to analogize a hundred, a hundred to analogize a thousand, a thousand to analogize ten thousand, ten thousand to analogize a hundred million, and a hundred million to analogize the boundless. Each matter has its own category and affiliation. Place the foundational text of each matter first, so that the knowledgeable may grasp its essence, and those skilled in application may expound upon it. Examine their correspondence and harmony—what aligns is true; what does not correspond or align is false. To discern whether the ancient sages’ writings on the Dao are authentic: this is like calling a person by their surname and given name—only then will they respond. Ghosts and spirits are the same. Without the correct name, there is no response; even if one wishes to harmonize, there is no means to reach them, and thus no response. Thus, the ancients called the study of names *Attending to Essence*. Essence means focusing intently on the matter’s image and suitability, then reflecting on its words. Thoroughly contemplating these writings and strategies completes all matters. Though the texts above and below are numerous, each has its proper application. Study them carefully, supplementing one with another, to fully grasp their meaning. Without deeply understanding their essential intent, words on the Dao are ineffective, and one cannot resolve the conflicts of yin and yang’s struggles.\n\nMy writings are for the benevolent and worthy, entrusted to those of virtue. Those of virtue who receive them treat them as treasures. If received but not read well, one may dismiss them as false Dao, unable to bring joy to the self or avert calamities. When the great Dao is revealed, does it not seem insipid? Yet its use is inexhaustible. Let the worthy reflect on this: can it not harmonize hardness and softness, exhaust the positions of yin and yang? Once all writings are settled in their proper places, is there still confusion? Evil is entirely dispelled, the Supreme Lord rejoices greatly, and the people are free from misfortune. Blessings extend even to the humble, and the teeming myriad things do not lose their qi. They return to the Great Beginning, Heaven and Earth take their places, heretical writings vanish, and the primordial qi is preserved. The One is the warp of the Dao; the Two, its weft. The Three brings chaos—it cannot be made clear. My Dao follows *jiazi* and *yichou*, the six *jia* succeeding one another, the five phases following in turn, the four seasons cycling back to their origin. Though the writings are many, each has its own record.\n\nJust as in a person, where head and feet alternately serve one another, one word departs and another arises, the worthy take their turns to fill in, harmonizing yin and yang through speech, outer and inner aligning like compass and square—at first recitation, it seems flavorless, but with time, its depth unfolds. Persist in contemplation without ceasing, and verification will come: disasters depart from the body, spirits gather anew, people naturally become prudent and virtuous, free from malevolent offspring. This is called \"the absence of punishment,\" the ultimate beauty of Dao-transformations.\n\nExamine my writings to avert misfortune: treachery and calamity will cease of themselves, and the people will enjoy long life. Trace back to the origin, and you find no end or beginning. The texts where ten correspond with ten are the *Taiyang* writings. Those where nineteen correspond are the *Taiyin* writings. Eighteen correspondences form the *Zhonghe* writings. Seventeen correspondences make the *Poruined* writings. Sixteen correspondences mark the *Encountering Central* writings. Fifteen correspondences are the *Ignorant* writings—these may be called half-auspicious, half-inauspicious. Fourteen correspondences denote *Heretical* writings. Thirteen correspondences signify *Great Chaos* writings. Twelve correspondences are *Abandoned* writings. Eleven correspondences are *Alternating Central* writings. Those with ten or fewer correspondences are unusable, misleading texts. The harm they inflict varies in degree, but ultimately rebounds upon the user. Prolonged use without cessation violates the law, leading to the extinction of one’s lineage and the destruction of one’s household—these are the writings of ten correspondences.\n\nAbove are the methods for repelling the heterodox and establishing the orthodox.\n\n*Tai ping jing*, Scroll Fifty, concludes.\n*Tai ping jing*, Scroll Fifty-One begins.\n\nThe fifty-second scroll is missing.\n\n**Collating the Orthodox and Heterodox Texts, Method Seventy-Eight**\nChun prostrates in trembling reverence and bows twice.\n\n\"What further would you ask?\"\n\"Now that I have seen the true writings of the enlightened master and the orthodox texts of the multitude—these are the discourses of Heaven—I fear and tremble, not knowing which should come first or last, nor by what means one may truly rectify these texts.\"\n\n\"If you wish to grasp their truth, simply examine the sacred words of the High Antiquity, the sacred words of the Middle Antiquity, and the sacred words of the Lower Antiquity. Compare their language and observe their deeds—thus may you know. Further, examine the Daoist texts of the High Antiquity, the Middle Antiquity, and the Lower Antiquity. When these three are harmonized by like calling to like, the truth becomes clear once more.\n\n\"Yet now all writings are deemed the discourses of Heaven—why then do they bring order at times and chaos at others? I wish to hear the reason.\"\n\"Indeed, those who rectify their words and clarify their texts bring order; those who do not bring chaos. Upright speech and careful phrasing必 lead to goodness; perverse speech and ominous phrasing必 lead to evil.\n\n\"You persist in questioning, and as I see your eagerness to know, I shall explain: If you wish to bring forth goodness, simply rectify the root. When the root is upright, it aligns with the celestial patterns and accords with the sacred words. In its second transformation, it aligns with earthly principles; in its third, with human culture; in its fourth, with the myriad things. Then the myriad things flourish in extravagance, and extravagance leads to chaos and ruin.\n\n\"When the celestial patterns and sacred texts emerge in their time, they serve to examine the primordial and rectify the origin, removing excess and establishing truth. To clarify all writings is the Dao of Heaven. Those who grasp upright speech align with the will of Heaven. Heterodoxy brings forth evil qi, causing Heaven and Earth to fall out of harmony, the myriad things to lose their proper places, and the emperor’s heart to be weighed down with sorrow. Chaos returns, and thus one must urgently collate and rectify these texts.\n\n\"From antiquity to the present, all writings have been compiled, yet we lament their assembly without purity, their mingling in disorder. Thus the wise and enlightened are left in doubt and confusion, not knowing what to follow or trust. They lose the utmost sincerity of Heaven and each turns to what contradicts it. This causes their intentions to diverge far from the subtle and profound guidance of the Dao of Heaven. All become heterodox words and heterodox texts, written in perversity, unable to rectify yin and yang. Disasters arise in succession, and the fault lies herein.\n\n\"Seeing your persistent questioning, I cannot bear to withhold my answer. Thus I have expounded repeatedly for your sake. Quickly set down my words and ponder them deeply. For in all matters, if one obtains the truth but cannot practice it single-mindedly, it is of no benefit. If one can practice it, great calamities are averted.\n\n\"When the celestial patterns are in chaos, the desire to see order restored is like a gravely ill person longing for a cure. How can this be achieved? Are you truly so foolish as to remain ignorant? If a grave illness is not treated in time, it leads to death. If the celestial patterns are not rectified, they lead to great chaos. The four seasons lose their qi, the Five Agents turn against one another, the Three Luminaries lose their proper brightness, all deviate from their true paths, and thus perish. The people are thrown into turmoil, all lose their dwellings, the old and weak carry burdens on their backs, half die prematurely, the state falls into darkness and confusion, the supreme Dao and virtuous power are cut off, the worthy are concealed and cannot aid one another—is this not a grave illness?\n\n\"Thus one must strive to rectify it. Now, fools daily study superficial and frivolous texts, competing to contradict one another and vie for superiority, not deeply understanding the great harm they cause, dismissing it as a trifling matter. How could they know that within, it is a grave illness for yin and yang and Heaven and Earth? The world’s inability to rectify itself stems precisely from this.\n\n\"The spirits and deities suffer from this affliction, which is why they have sent you to question me repeatedly. You should ponder their essential meaning day and night, without negligence, for this is no light matter before the August Heaven. Now, the emperor has no place to turn his heart—his fault is grave indeed.\n\n\"Though I speak with you now as but two individuals, within, I am rectifying the discourse for the August Heaven. I dare not speak carelessly or in vain, for the fault would rest upon me, and the sin would be too heavy to absolve. The punishments of the spirits and deities cannot be evaded or escaped like those of mortals.\n\n\"Do you dare to follow my light words as if they were mere worldly chatter, competing for superiority? Truly, I dare not.\"\nChun, hearing the words of the Heavenly Master, trembles yet rejoices. \"I shall exert all my strength, hoping to align with the will of the spirits and deities, to relieve the world’s sorrows, pacify the emperor, and allow the myriad things to each find their proper place. This is my wish.\"\n\"Do you wish only for your own goodness, unable to extend it further?\"\n\"The reason I alone have maintained good intentions is that my learning stems from reflecting on goodness. Thus, while others all grow old and perish, I alone remain. My ancestors’ descendants have all passed away, yet I alone have not died. Truly, I have received a profound mandate, and I am ashamed before the August Heaven, unable to repay it. I constantly think of exhausting my strength, yet I do not know how to make amends.\n\n\"Seeing Heaven and Earth out of harmony and wind and rain unregulated, I know it is a grave illness for the world, and I pity it. Now, having heard the words of the divine person, I am greatly awakened. I wish to devote myself to the death to serve the enlightened Heaven, to resolve the great illness and pacify the earthly principles, thereby aiding the emperor and allowing the myriad things to each find their proper place. In this way, I may repay the profound merit of Heaven. Yet I do not know if I am capable or not. I humbly ask further, for I fall short of the enlightened master.\"\n\"Excellent are your words! Hearing them now, I rejoice—what need is there to speak of Heaven? My words are flawless, not one in ten thousand is lost. You need only strive diligently without slackening to rectify them—this can restore the merit of Heaven, and there is no doubt. If the emperor practices this, he will swiftly gain its power—how much more so for you? Seeing your words, I dare not hold back my strength.\"\n\nThough I am your elder, my aspirations do not match yours. Now, as we both share this Heaven and Earth, I wish to join you in pacifying them. I would prefer not to speak, yet I fear I would incur greater fault with you and suffer heavier punishment from Heaven. Listen carefully once more, and I shall explain it to you again in full detail, turning it over and back.\n\nThe correct text embodies the heart of Heaven and Earth, preserving the primal qi and its principles. In ancient times, sacred texts emerged in their seasons; examining their original characters and proper forms, the Dao was transmitted through mutual dependence. Subtle words and explanations—all were essential to the primal qi. The second transmission contains esoteric phrases; the third forms chapters and verses; the fourth becomes florid embellishment; the fifth diverges into disparate meanings, each asserting its own opposition; the sixth becomes deceptive rhetoric. Even in chapters and verses, only a small portion retains the original intent. Beyond this lies grave illness, causing the Dao of Heaven to lose its way. For this reason, emperors and kings have long suffered, unable to deeply grasp its principles.\n\nYou, fortunate one, wish to repay Heaven’s grace and restore its profound merit. Heaven does not delight in people offering their wealth or rare and counterfeit goods; it delights only in people ordering its texts without confusion. When I first saw you come to study, I thought you would ask but one or two things before leaving—how could I have imagined you would seek to master the Dao of Heaven in its entirety? Though my words may not be perfect, the Dao of Heaven can already be glimpsed through them.\n\nIf you delight in ordering Heaven and Earth, take the subtle words and trace them back to their origins, aligning them with their primal essence—thus you will grasp the heart and intent of Heaven and may pacify the world. Collate the texts of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, summoning them by category to assemble their correspondences. Let one who holds to the root oversee the work, for each text has its own fundamental matter. All written works belong to distinct lineages; let ordinary people each contribute their talents, gathering to discuss the two interpretations. The original matter, the true nature of the characters, and the factual essence will all emerge of themselves. Gather the essential words within and fashion them into explanations—these are the chapters and verses, wherein the true heart of the Dao is found.\n\nThis may be called resolving Heaven’s anxieties; the great illness is dispelled. This may be called removing the sufferings of the earth. This may be called allowing the emperor to wander in harmony with the heart of Heaven. This may be called enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place. In this, not one in ten thousand is lost.\n\nI see from your words, spoken so earnestly, that you are Heaven’s messenger—I dare not deceive you. To deceive you now would be to deceive Heaven itself. Should Heaven grow displeased, it would shorten my years, bringing harm upon my person, and I would stand ashamed before the August Sky, all while failing the myriad people. The fault would be grave indeed. Strive to remember this: know only that I dare not hold back the least effort.\n\n“Yes, yes,” came the reply. Hearing the master’s words, the heart trembled with awe.\n\nSince this is a matter Heaven has inquired about, I dare not delay or halt—only press on to its completion. May the master graciously pardon my shortcomings and show me what is difficult and what is easy, that I may venture to ask in full.\n\nNow, the written works have accumulated in great number, and I wish to discern their truth or falsehood. Yet the principle remains as you asked before: what resonates in tenfold or hundredfold accord is true; what does not is false. What is governed and yields response is true; what does not is but deceitful practice. To obtain such response, the people and ministers must all be good, loyal, and trustworthy.\n\nWhy say this? If a child is virtuous, parents remain at peace, finding their rightful place. If a wife is good, her husband commits no transgressions, gaining her strength. If a minister is upright, the state enjoys enduring stability. When emperor, king, people, and ministers are all good, Heaven sends no calamities or omens—this is the very truth of it.\n\nDo you understand? Or do you not?\n\nCome now, I wish to discuss a matter with you. If you deem my writings worthy of selection, would you thoroughly examine and master them? You are but a youth of unopened understanding and have not yet grasped their meaning.\n\nTry to speak of it, and I shall observe whether you fully comprehend. My humble thought is this: I wish to compile and unify all that is useful, so that high and low may complement one another. We shall take each matter, compare a hundred to a thousand, a thousand to ten thousand, and cross-examine them to ensure sufficiency. Otherwise, I fear we cannot fully encompass the ancient texts.\n\nWhat you say now is truly correct.\n\nHave you not recorded in my writings that one is compared to ten, ten to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, a thousand to ten thousand, and ten thousand to a hundred million? This is precisely the principle.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhom should we employ to carry out this collation? Each shall attend to their proper role. Those who are clear about the fundamentals shall rely upon them. Those skilled in knowledge and application shall gather together to expound upon them, circulating their discourse from the emperor and kings down to the common people. All shall abandon their former practices and come together in unified deliberation.\n\nThose of lesser understanding shall first gather among themselves, then submit to those of middling understanding. Those of middling understanding shall gather and submit to those of greater understanding, and those of greater understanding shall gather and submit to the emperor and kings. Then, all the worthy shall assemble to harmonize and refine their discourse, ensuring stability. This is how counsel reaches even the lowest, leaving no calculation unconsidered, no word abandoned, and no text discarded.\n\nThe lesser worthy shall gather and collate, then submit to the middling worthy. The middling worthy shall collate and submit to the great worthy, and the great worthy shall collate and submit to the emperor and kings. When the principles and texts are thus orally and textually perfected without error, truly aligning with the heart of Heaven and the division of yin and yang, the emperor, kings, and all ministers shall together recognize their authenticity. Only then shall they be disseminated among the people.\n\nLet the entire world recite and read the correct texts. Thus shall the qi of Heaven be attained, Great Peace arrive, the qi of Supreme Peace descend, songs of praise arise, all things enjoy enduring stability, the hundred clans fall silent, heterodox texts vanish of themselves, the ailments of Heaven be cured, the afflictions of Earth disappear, the emperor and kings wander in ease, yin and yang rejoice, perverse qi withdraw, bandits and thieves be cut off, the Central Kingdom flourish and rise, and its glory equal that of the Three Sovereigns of antiquity. The barbarians shall retreat, all things thrive in abundance, and the world be most fortunate, all acclaiming \"ten thousand years!\"\n\nDo not conceal or obstruct my writings.\n\nIndeed, indeed, I dare not hide or withhold them.\n\nHaving received the master’s instructions, I truly report and return them in earnest, for to conceal them would risk incurring grave transgression. Well said, your words are most excellent. You have already aligned with the heart of Heaven, and your name shall be recorded as one who has repaid Heaven’s profound merit. Indeed, indeed. Truly, I may now retire to a quiet place to ponder their deepest meaning, never slackening in diligence. Go forth, and doubt no more.\n\n[End of Textual Verification]\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 51 concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 53: \"Distinguishing the Four Methods of Governance\" #79\n\nThe Perfected One, Pure and Reverent, bows in trembling reverence. I now wish to pose a further question, though it may not pertain to the Dao. Having witnessed the Illuminated Master resolve every matter without fail, I dare, despite my shame, to step forward once more to ask of a single doubt: what is it? Speak plainly, and I shall explain it to you.\n\nThe ministers of emperors and kings ought all to be elders; the young are fundamentally unfit to govern the world. Why do you ask this? I observe the qi of Heaven—of late, it has repeatedly fallen into disharmony. The fault may lie with officials who fail in their duties, causing the seasonal qi to fall out of balance. The sovereign lacks clarity, disasters multiply, and even Daoists suffer harm. Now, the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth themselves are afflicted—where can a true and enlightened Daoist flee to escape unscathed? Thus, though I alone have long been favored by Heaven’s grace, I dare not presume my own safety. From my earliest years, I have sought instruction from masters, yet none could fully resolve my questions. Today, I dare not shrink from shame and must once more inquire of the Heavenly Master, that he may clarify the essential meaning, lest I never come to understand it. Out of kindness, the Illuminated Master cannot refuse and must explain to his disciple what he has not yet grasped.\n\nWell said, your words are most excellent. From what you have spoken today, I know that the governance of Great Peace is already at hand. Nevertheless, I shall explain it all in full; you must record it in detail.\n\nThere are four methods of governance: the governance of Heaven, the governance of Earth, the governance of Man, and when the three qi reach their utmost, the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth. I wish to hear their meaning.\n\nThe governance of Heaven: its ministers are elders, and the ruler treats them as fathers and teachers. Though ministers hold lowly positions, why treat them as fathers and teachers? While their rank may be humble, their virtue and power are most exalted. To treat them as fathers and teachers is to honor their virtue and power, to join with them in counsel and bring peace to the world.\n\nThe governance of Earth: the ruler befriends his ministers, as if sharing the same aspirations and heart. Earth is yin and compliant, like mother and child standing side by side, sharing the same embrace and sorrows. Though ministers may hold lowly positions, their virtue brings harmony, pacifying the ruler’s governance.\n\nThe governance of Man: it diminishes their utility. Ministers are young and small, like a father’s young child, who cannot yet devise strategies for his father. Thus, their governance is slightly disordered.\n\nThe governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth: the ruler regards his ministers and people as dogs or grass and trees, no longer carefully selecting them for office. He merely fills positions as they arise, as if mimicking men without understanding. Why is this? Those who mimic men merely resemble human form but act carelessly, without regard for the ruler’s interests. Thus, they engage in constant strife.\n\nTo emulate the governance of Heaven: the ministers of the world become the ruler’s fathers and teachers, and so he treats them as fathers. A man loves his child—what danger could there be in such times? Fathers and teachers can resolve the crises of the eight directions—how could there be any misfortune?\n\nTo emulate the governance of Earth: the ministers of the world become the ruler’s friends. Sharing the same aspirations and strategies, they unite in bearing sorrows and hardships, seeking to secure their positions together. Earth is compliant and upholds what is above, fully aligning with Heaven’s will and heart—how could there be any time of instability?\n\nTo emulate the governance of Man: it attains the qi of harmony, which is difficult to discern, advancing or retreating unpredictably. It resembles a young child who cannot yet plan for his father and thus deceives him. Ministers who are young cannot deeply consider the ruler’s interests and so deceive him. The young have seen little of the sun and moon, their learning is shallow, and they inspire no awe—thus they deceive, and their governance is slightly disordered.\n\nTo emulate the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth: such creatures lack propriety and righteousness, and the myriad things possess little understanding and no virtue or power. The nature of creatures that walk upon the earth is without hierarchy, seeking only to prevail—thus, their governance leads to chaos and ruin.\n\nThe governance of Heaven is benevolent, cherishing life and avoiding harm. The governance of Earth is compliant and good, though it may cause minor harm. The governance of Man is mutually beneficial and desirous, often leading to mutual injury, deceit, and negligence. The governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth ultimately achieves no success, regardless of scale, seeking only to prevail.\n\nObserving these methods of governance, one can discern whether the qi of Heaven—above, below, and at the center—has lost its proper order. Those who desire the highest joy should emulate the governance of Heaven; those who desire the second joy should emulate the governance of Earth; those who desire the third joy should emulate the governance of Man; and those who desire the fourth joy should emulate the governance of the myriad creatures.\n\nThose who emulate Heaven alone enjoy long life and align with Heaven’s heart. Those who emulate Earth enjoy slightly shorter lives and align with Earth’s intent. Those who emulate Man have diminished lifespans, while those who emulate the myriad creatures die unpredictably and without number.\n\nThose who emulate Heaven practice the Three Ways of written communication. Heaven possesses three luminous texts, forming the Three Illuminations: the sun, the moon, and the arrayed stars. The sun examines yang, the moon examines yin, and the stars examine the center. Thus, the Three Ways of written communication must be employed, striving to attain wisdom and clarity. When documents are sent, they bear the name of the sender alone, without inquiring who the recipient may be.\n\nThose who emulate Earth practice the Two Ways of written communication. Those who emulate Man practice the One Way of written communication, yet still appear to linger carelessly. Those who emulate the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth merely utter words without any written documents.\n\nIs this the will of Heaven, or do men act of their own accord? Is it the work of fate? Nevertheless, when an emperor or king governs toward Great Peace, he should follow Heaven’s will, delighting in goodness and joy, emulating the governance of Heaven. For those aiming at moderate peace, emulate the governance of Earth. For those facing minor disorder, follow the governance of Man. For those facing great chaos and ungovernability, follow the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth.\n\nWhy is this so? And how should it be remedied?\n\nNow, when Heaven intends to exalt a ruler, auspicious omens and sacred texts emerge, bestowed upon him to awaken his profound understanding and entrust him with their wisdom. When decline is imminent, Heaven conceals these texts, ensuring they remain unseen, and further causes the ruler to lose all desire to seek them.\n\nAre worthy ministers merely those who grow old in service? No. To grow old is to be venerable and seasoned, aged in virtue and power, emulating Heaven’s singular constancy in upholding the Dao and acting without the slightest deviation. Thus can they bring stability to their emperor or king. Yet one who grows old without a single insight is unfit for office.\n\nWhat, then, of one who serves as a father to the ruler? Or as a friend? Or as a son? And what of the myriad creatures?\n\nTo serve as a father is to receive instruction as a son does from his stern father, or as a disciple does from his enlightened master. One must grasp the ruler’s innermost strategies and secret sagely writings, employing them to pacify the realm, repay the ancestors, and offer sacrifices in the ancestral temple. By this virtue, one repays Heaven’s profound merit, thereby winning the hearts of all under Heaven. Yin and yang harmonize, and disasters cease.\n\nTo serve as a friend is to join in loyalty and trust, devising strategies together and deeply weighing good and evil, ease and difficulty.\n\nTo serve as a son is to conceal matters as a father might hide something from his child, or as a child might conceal a fault from his parents—each deceiving the other, using this as a means to an end.\n\nAs for the myriad creatures: in times of great chaos, they are countless. In spring and summer, they contend for life; in autumn and winter, they contend for death, granting one another no respite.\n\nChun bows twice. Your questions are many and earnest, far exceeding what is proper—indeed, they surpass even what is due to a master. Yet I dare not conceal these texts. To see them and fail to act would risk offending August Heaven.\n\nWhere, then, should I place this book? Since you have asked, you must exert yourself to carry it forth. When you encounter one who can comprehend it, entrust it to him, that he may deliver it to a virtuous ruler. If the emperor or king models his governance upon it, his rule will surely be divine.\n\nYet if one receives it but fails to ponder and apply it deeply, Heaven will hold him no further accountable.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not oppose my master’s words.”\n\nStill, my words must not be greatly contradicted. For Heaven and Earth desire peace and have revealed this supreme Dao, sending you from afar to inquire of this method. Heaven has commanded me to speak, to transmit these words to you, and I do not speak in vain. Were Heaven unwilling, and I still spoke, recklessly divulging its essential Dao, I would incur punishment. But if you take my words and deliver them, you shall suffer no harm or doubt.\n\nI tell you this in utmost sincerity: Heaven will bestow even greater favor upon the emperor or king, and thus I warn you. Heaven’s course has its appointed times for fortune and misfortune. Those who obtain this and act upon it shall know good fortune without doubt.\n\nI humbly ask: who is the one who will carry this forth? What is his name?\n\nHeaven bestows upon all things without partiality. The one who first delights in practicing it—that is the person.\n\nThe Great Dao is most weighty and cannot be entrusted to private hands. To practice it is auspicious; to neglect it is to invite doubt.\n\nI humbly ask again: what do Heaven and Earth observe? What do they witness? Is there but a single word to be spoken?\n\nTruly, there is something to be observed and witnessed—this is no empty speech. Heaven rejoices in tranquility and peace, free from illness, and delights in perfect equilibrium. Thus it ensures that the people remain serene, without evil words or strife, each dwelling in their proper place. Then there is no illness, and joy abounds, so Heaven speaks without falsehood.\n\nBut if yin and yang clash in opposition, disrupting and harming one another, if all things cannot abide in their proper places, if the sun and moon lose their clarity and the stars stray from their courses, then Heaven is afflicted with illness, distressed and unresolved. It does not transmit its words, and the malady persists.\n\nThus, in times of disorder, discourse arises—minor disorder calls for minor discourse, and great disorder calls for great discourse. From ancient times to the present, divine perfected sages have served as Heaven’s envoys, receiving Heaven’s intent and acting as its voice to speak for Heaven and Earth. Since Heaven and Earth established their work, this has been the constant principle. The writings of sages, past and present, are Heaven’s discourse, Heaven’s words and affairs.\n\nWhat, then, are these words and discourses? They address the sufferings and hardships of the age. Those who lose the essence of the Dao are its substance; those who lack understanding are its refinement. To condemn evil and wickedness is to rectify and perfect the Dao, awakening the people.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are most exalted and divine, capable of illuminating the highest positions. Why do they not eliminate their own afflictions, instead transmitting words through men?\n\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Though the parents may be good, if their children act wickedly, dwelling at the center and presiding over their perversity, if governance above and below is inverted and chaotic, then even good parents become a troubled household. It is like a son who brings disorder to his father, a minister who brings disorder to his ruler, a disciple who brings disorder to his master, or a wife who brings disorder to her husband. Such mutual harm and great chaos obscure all goodness.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things originally share a single endeavor. When good prevails, all rejoice; when misfortune strikes, all suffer. Thus they share a common sorrow. If they did not share this endeavor, they would not take turns bearing one another’s burdens.\n\nTherefore, when Heaven and Earth desire goodness and peace, they must employ divine perfected sages to transmit their words, revealing sacred texts to convey their message. This is like an emperor or king who, wishing to delight in goodness, issues good teachings—such is the meaning here.\n\nIf you wish to delight in knowing Heaven’s intent, to repay Heaven’s merit, and to rescue the realm from baleful qi, then this book is the answer. Obtain it, ponder it deeply, and Heaven’s intent will be known.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not be negligent.”\n\nI hope my master will offer one or two more instructions.\n\nNow, good and evil each pertain to the self. The good benefit themselves; the wicked harm their own bodies. Since you possess such a fervent desire for goodness and grieve over Heaven and Earth’s afflictions and the ruler’s unrest, your merit is already vast.\n\nBut ponder this carefully: your practice of goodness is unparalleled—do not grieve over it again, and let your devotion to goodness remain constant as it is now.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not grow lax, dare not grow lax.”\n\n**[Section on the Symbols of Stability and Peril in the Four Governances]**\n\n*Here concludes Scroll Fifty-Three of the* Classic of Great Peace. *#1 According to the Dunhuang manuscript* Catalog of the *Classic of Great Peace*, *this chapter should be titled* “Distinguishing the Four Governances, Part Eighty.” *The preceding Scroll Fifty-Two,* “The Yin-Yang Formula of Embryonic Transformation, Part Seventy-Nine,” *is missing. The lacuna appears in* A Collated Edition of the *Classic of Great Peace*, *Scroll Fifty-Two.*\n\n---\n\n**Scroll Fifty-Four of the** *Classic of Great Peace*\n**Method for Preventing Litigation, Part Eighty-One**\n\nI have asked many questions, and the Heavenly Master’s responses flow without end—my inquiries know no bounds. I humbly beg for one or two more instructions.\n\nProceed.\n\nNow, I wish to understand the intent of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the aspirations of the people and all creatures, and the essence of all things, so that they may perpetually delight in goodness, wander freely without duties or affairs, each correcting themselves, no longer turning to mutual sorrow and reproach. Might I hear how this may be achieved?\n\nYou now ask: what is the most singularly excellent and extraordinary question? What is the unparalleled devotion to goodness?\n\nIf your inquiry is as you describe, then matters should follow their natural course, each attaining their heart’s desire. One should act according to their abilities, never forcing what lies beyond their capacity. In this way, each obtains what they seek. When each obtains their desire, none will suffer sorrow. Then, each attains their heart’s intent and may be said to wander without duties. Between Heaven and Earth, if one is constantly compelled to act beyond their ability, forced to do what they cannot, and burdened with what they cannot bear—if, when they fail to act or speak, they are not shown compassion and taught but instead reproached, their grievances will fester. Resentment and litigation will multiply, the people will suffer in distress and poverty, and they will lift their voices to Supreme Heaven, crying, “Truly, we are wronged! Truly, we are wronged!” Their qi will stir the six directions. Thus, disasters and anomalies will arise in profusion, accumulating in myriad forms, impossible to swiftly eradicate. The harm will be severe, for this is to lose the hearts of all under Heaven. In the end, no success will be achieved, and strange omens will never cease. How then can the qi of Great Peace arise? Thus, Great Peace cannot be attained—this is precisely the fault.\n\nThough one may claim to govern with constant equanimity, if internal chaos persists, how can the realm be purified? You now ask this, wishing to know it thoroughly.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is such that all things have their proper place. One should employ their strengths and abilities, but never force what they cannot do. Though all things receive the qi of yin and yang, it is like fish that cannot live without water—they cannot swim upon high mountains. Yet when water is present, regardless of depth or shallowness, they can swim freely. Great trees cannot grow without soil—they cannot thrive in the midst of rivers and seas. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, when assigning tasks, selected from the five types of soil according to their suitability. Only then did things flourish and prosper, the state grew wealthy, the ancestral temples offered rich flavors, and all under Heaven enjoyed peace without suffering. Baleful qi ceased to spread and cause harm.\n\nIf one does not divine and assess the land before planting, the myriad things will fail to complete their natural lifespan. They will harbor unresolved grievances, die prematurely, and their distress will ascend to move Supreme Heaven. Nothing will be reaped, the state will grow impoverished, food will lack richness, the ancestral temples will hunger and thirst, and all under Heaven will suffer. The people will turn to mutual harm, ruler and minister will deceive one another, and internal and external affairs will diverge in speech. This is where the fault truly begins. If even the myriad things cannot find their proper place, how much more so for humans? The world cannot be governed rightly—this is the reason.\n\nThis is the root of great harm, the path to peril and ruin. How can one not be cautious? How can one not ponder it deeply in their heart?\n\nThus, the great sages and worthies of antiquity, when appointing officials, first tested their strengths and weaknesses before assigning them duties. They entrusted them accordingly. If a person erred, they reproached them, but only regarding their strengths, never their shortcomings. This does not offend Heaven. Instead, it encourages the refinement of their learning, and thus they gain the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\nIn later ages, matters were neglected. People did not deeply reflect on the words of the ancient sages. Instead, they appointed people to positions beyond their competence, reproached them for what they could not achieve, and questioned them on what they could not perceive. The blind cannot see the sun, the mute cannot speak—yet they hastened to expose their shortcomings, treating them as grave faults, and punished them. They did not seek to bring joy and mutual benefit but instead engaged in cunning manipulation, harming one another in turn. This is the great ruin of all under Heaven.\n\nThe lords of antiquity who brought Great Peace possessed no extraordinary divine methods. They simply employed people according to their abilities and hearts’ desires, and thus they summoned the qi of Great Peace without grievances among the people. When calamity and chaos arise, it is always because people are assigned tasks beyond their competence, forced to perform duties unsuited to them, and heavily reproached. Even if punished with death, they cannot fulfill their duties. Disasters will arise in succession, impossible to suppress, leading to ruin and defeat. Good and ill fortune, safety and peril—all originate here.\n\nThus, when the ancients selected officials for the emperor or king, they first examined and tested their abilities, determining whether they aligned with the auspicious responses of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. Those who did not align were deemed false in conduct. How does one achieve such alignment? Great persons receive great responses, lesser persons receive lesser responses. Wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons, the myriad things flourish and thrive, the people are free from complaint, and birds and beasts move and act in tranquility. These are the signs.\n\nThus, those who govern with music and desire to pacify the state must carefully examine their appointments. For Heaven generates the myriad things, each endowed with its own talents and capacities, each suited to its proper place—just as dragons ascend to the heavens and fish swim in the depths. This is what is meant.\n\nSince the establishment of Heaven and Earth, governance has taken myriad forms, and the transformations of Heaven shift with the times. The essential principle is to accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth, fulfilling what they desire. Heaven uses the Three Luminaries as its script and records, marking cycles of rise and decline, with wind as the sovereign. Earth employs mountains and rivers, fields and paths as its veins and textures; mountains exhale qi, waters flow through channels, and their decline, flourishing, movement, collapse, and convergence are reflected in the winds and anomalies of ministers. Humans transmit through speech and language, their writings and records evolving over time. The myriad things speak through their flourishing and decline, allowing people to perceive and understand them.\n\nHumans stand at the center of yin and yang, serving as the teachers and leaders of the myriad things. Their abilities are most numerous, embodying the spirit while possessing form, advancing and retreating in transformation. They must meticulously record these changes and report them to their sovereign. Thus, if one matter is not communicated, grievances accumulate; if two are obstructed, blockages arise; if three are cut off, isolation follows; if four are unaddressed, harmony fails to respond, and the generation of things becomes irregular. If five are uncommunicated, the circulation of qi and the Dao falters; if six are obstructed, the six directions breed malice; if seven are cut off, ruin ensues; if eight are unaddressed, governance becomes fragmented among factions; if nine are obstructed, mutual harm arises; if ten are uncommunicated, mutual upheaval follows. Therefore, one must strive to ensure the free flow of communication.\n\nIn ancient times, when there was no writing, how was communication achieved? Writing arose precisely for this purpose. Yet how often does it align with Heaven and Earth, how often does it cease? Later generations simply have not witnessed it. In the middle antiquity of the Three Sovereigns, words were established without writing. In later antiquity, the qi of Heaven and Earth rose and fell in cycles, and only divine beings, untouched by age, knew their origins. Through many vicissitudes, they understood that inherent patterns must contain writing, though later generations have not seen it. Why, then, does writing sometimes exist and sometimes not? As Heaven’s qi declines, people grow foolish, feeble, and short-lived, unable to inscribe records. Thus, writing was commanded to enable transmission across time, preserving knowledge of antiquity. Without writing, disputes could not be settled, each party claiming rightness, so writing was instituted. This was due to the foolishness of the age, and thus writing was created, as Heaven issued its covenant.\n\nHaving heard the master’s words, I now understand. I wish to know: how should one ensure the free flow of qi today? Simply let the Three Dao circulate the writings of the eight directions, and let the words of officials and commoners alike not be arbitrarily delayed. Urgent matters should be resolved in their time; non-urgent ones may follow the rhythms of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. After seven months, when things reach their end, review them in the eighth month, reorder them in the ninth, and by the tenth month, those unresolved should be recorded. After three years, those whose records demonstrate utmost sincerity should be sought out and appointed. Such individuals are the state’s finest ministers—keen of hearing and sight, able to observe and listen without fail to the signs of the four directions. When the emperor or king obtains them, the state is at peace and enlightened; thus, they must be entrusted.\n\nHow, then, should they be entrusted? Each must be questioned about the extent of their abilities, allowing them to record what they can do, what they can resolve, and what they excel in. Appoint them according to their innate nature, and their governance will be without error. Thus, they will win the hearts of all under Heaven, and their rule will daily advance toward Great Peace—without punishments, without scarcity, without grievances. Heaven and Earth will achieve perfect harmony, all things flowing freely. This is how one attains the longevity of the Supreme Sovereign. Those who live long do so because they avoid punishment and harm; those who inflict much harm bring it back upon themselves.\n\nThus, in high antiquity, the sagely and worthy refused to favor punishments. In middle antiquity, punishments were used sparingly, so longevity was halved. In later antiquity, punishments were used extensively, so longevity was greatly diminished. Punishment is an evil that offends Heaven, disrupts yin and yang, and accumulates as malevolent qi, returning to harm people. The sages of high antiquity avoided its heavy use out of care for their own lives. The people of middle antiquity were half foolish, lightly employing punishments, and thus half destroyed themselves. The people of later antiquity were greatly foolish, treating punishments as routine, and thus most did not attain longevity. The fault lies here.\n\nThose who read this scripture should reflect on it repeatedly, valuing and heeding it. Life and death are weighty matters; they must not be treated lightly. A worthy and wise son plans deeply for his father; a worthy and wise minister plans deeply for his sovereign. An unworthy son does not plan deeply for his father; an unworthy minister does not plan for his sovereign. The young of today—are they not their own selves? The fortunes and misfortunes that befall them are the legacy of these patterns for later generations.\n\nTherefore, when the sagely emperors and kings of high antiquity appointed ministers, they carefully selected those of Dao and virtue who did not delight in killing or harm. This was not merely for the sake of the people but for their own deep well-being. Thus, they aligned with the hearts of Heaven and Earth, their actions moving as if in concert with the spirits. This is what is meant by \"careful selection yielding the right person\"—a ruler who gains the strength of others. Such rulers move the gods and spirits, and the true spirits of Heaven above come to love them, granting them unique longevity. Those who favor punishments align with yin qi, and yin is killing; thus, they do not attain great longevity. The decree of Heaven is discernible and knowable—what Heaven, Earth, and humans detest is the same.\n\nTo the right: Those who win the hearts of Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things, whose states prosper and families are secure, whose realm knows no disputes—this is the conclusion of *The Scripture on Great Peace*, Scroll Fifty-Four.\nHere ends *The Scripture on Great Peace*, Scroll Fifty-Five.\n\n**Forceful Practice and Broad Learning, Formula Eighty-Two**\n\nNow, can the great mandate be known or not? Though it may be known, having met an enlightened teacher and heard their words, the greatest delusions are already dispelled—yet still, out of necessity, I wish to reiterate this earnestly.\n\nThus, the intent of my Dao may be discerned. Those who obtain these writings and read them often lament their lack of mastery; only the mastered may fully comprehend them. Without profound reflection on their deepest meaning, without meticulous study, even possessing these writings brings no benefit. To obtain them yet fail to practice forcefully—how does this differ from never having obtained them? To see food yet not eat—how does this differ from having no grain? To see broth yet not drink—thirst remains unquenched. This does not harm others but harms oneself—can one not be cautious?\n\nTherefore, the sage exerts forceful thought, the noble person exerts forceful study, day and night without ceasing, delighting in emulating Heaven, which revolves unceasingly. The hundred rivers flow and gather to form the great seas. Heed my words, remember my repeated admonitions—your heart’s devotion may be seen.\n\nDo good and share it with the worthy; take care not to monopolize the market. For if the market has few, what one seeks cannot be obtained. Thus, those who do not study broadly cannot see clearly. This is why, though one may glimpse the true Dao, its essential meaning remains elusive. Without faith in the Dao, doubt lingers—each person’s self-imposed limitation lies herein. Therefore, one must deeply ponder its intent to enable self-rescue and assistance.\n\n**To the right: Pointers on Longevity and Life Span.**\n\n---\n\n**Knowing Prosperity and Decline, the Method of Restoring Years and Lifespan, Formula Eighty-Three**\n\nHeaven bestows affairs, each with its own laws. Mandates may be entrusted, the Dao may be practiced; some emerge sooner, some later, their signs gradually appearing. It is like the myriad things: sprouting at *zi*, growing at *mao*, branching at *wu*, ripening at *you*, and ending at *hai*. Though signs appear in advance, they cannot be guaranteed.\n\nEach affair has its moment of action. When the first glimmers of light appear, though the matter is not yet at hand, its path is prepared in advance. Heaven’s portents always precede, never following behind. When the right person is found and the way is opened, they receive aid and support. Without opening, without passage, no success is achieved—this is not the right person.\n\nThis serves as clear evidence. The Dao is precise in its pronouncements; ten thousand times, not once does it err. If it is the right person, the way is opened for them; if not, it remains closed. When the right person is found, illnesses may be dispelled, calamities and omens vanish of themselves, barbarians submit without need of arms, and all dissipates naturally.\n\nThe generation of the myriad things has its own arrangements. With the right person, it unfolds of itself; without, it withdraws. In all matters, without the right person, one cannot force action. What is not theirs cannot be forcibly taken; what is not their land cannot be forcibly planted. If planted, it will not grow. To speak of poor seeds—if they do not find their proper place within, how can they endure? The six directions and eight quarters each have their suitability; their phenomena appear differently in each.\n\nFor example, the Metal phase resides in the West, the Wood phase in the East. Each thrives in its proper place and perishes when misplaced. Thus, the myriad things take root in the earth to live; they cannot take root in Heaven. The sun, moon, stars, and celestial stems and branches, by contrast, attach to Heaven to generate light.\n\nThe Dao is like this. When the right person exists, stars in the sky shine brightly; if they fall to earth, they lose their light—this is not their proper place, and thus the constant Dao is disrupted. What can be done does not proceed recklessly. If it is the right person, it becomes clear; if not, it cannot be enacted.\n\nThe Dao is profound and distant, beyond measure. Those who lose it fail; those who attain it prosper. To know one’s own prosperity and decline, observe where the Dao takes root—spiritual numina may then flourish. Within, there are signs of longevity; by this, not once in ten thousand times is there error.\n\nThis is a divine scripture, a method for restoring years. Its Dao is of utmost importance—how can one not ponder it? Therefore, transmit it to the benevolent and wise, testing them to see if they may preserve their lives.\n\nWhen the right person appears, worthies and sages emerge together, divine scriptures arrive, and extraordinary methods arise of themselves, bringing joy to all—this is the right person. This is the proof. If it does not accord with these words, though signs may appear first, they cannot be enacted.\n\nIt is to be passed to later generations; the Dao does not emerge recklessly. There are those for whom it is fitting—only ask the person to reflect for themselves. The Dao’s return cannot be forbidden, nor can it be compelled. One must allow it to proceed as it will, observing its success. The Dao cannot be empty.\n\nNevertheless, talent is not as good as effort, and effort is not as good as unceasing action. All affairs under Heaven are tested through trial and failure. Heaven, Earth, and the spirits all test people; thus, people emulate the Heavenly Dao in testing one another.\n\nThose who encounter goodness—their mandate is already good. Those who encounter evil—their mandate is already doubtful. From ancient times to the present, nothing moves Heaven except utmost sincerity. To demand forcefully is called coercion; though one may sometimes obtain it thus, what is coerced is not truly theirs. How can it be forcibly taken? Such affairs are not harmonious and good, but discordant and chaotic.\n\nHuman mandates have three grades. Entrust the Dao to the wilderness, to those capable of using it. For those incapable, entrust it to the capital, place it in the marketplace—take care not to cut it off, lest later generations have no heirs. Transmit the scriptures to sages, worthies, and Daoists. Without a master, without a name, entrust them to those who can use them.\n\nThe Dao has its own fitting recipients; it cannot be given to just anyone. It may be conveyed through words. Like great trees returning to the mountains, like water flowing to the sea—it cannot be stopped. This is the nature of Heaven. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it perish.\n\nDivine scriptures seek to emerge; they cannot be concealed. With the right person, they will surely manifest. Without, they remain dark, deaf, and blind—body unjoyful, eyes without light. To study this text with focus brings delight.\n\nAll that pertains to the flourishing of Heaven and the extension of life’s span lies herein.\n\nThe qi of Great Peace has already manifested in full. The people’s kindness, love, reverence, and goodness all arise from it. The wise and sagely rejoice in it. Rare texts from distant lands have all been entrusted to it. Strive to practice without slack, and thereby strengthen yourself. Enlightened kings and sagely rulers all flourish through it. Barbarians retreat and submit, all departing from it.\n\nThe myriad people are most fortunate, all without complaint. Heaven’s mandate of longevity is now in effect; none bring suffering upon themselves. The old depart according to fate, while the young are preserved whole.\n\nThis scripture will be transmitted through ten thousand generations without end. Descendants will pass it down, teaching one another day by day. It is called the True Text, unchanging through all ages, bringing good fortune to all.\n\nThe Dao is now complete and naturally perfected. Blessings arrive of their own accord; none dare refuse them. The great person who obtains it governs the state with peace. The middling person who obtains it becomes a worthy minister. The humble person who obtains it escapes peril.\n\nAbove is the text that clarifies the Dao’s intent and resolves right and wrong.\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Fifty-Five of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Thus begins Scroll Sixty-Five of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n**The Ninety-Ninth Method of Severing Metal: Military Strategy**\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions, in pure reverence, bow twice and declare: We wish to inquire of the celestial laws, yet dare not speak hastily. May the August Celestial Master grant us this audience, allowing our words to be heard?\n\nSpeak without doubt.\n\nWe obey.\n\nNow, the Celestial Master alone can resolve the inherited disasters of emperors and kings, crafting methods to exalt the sovereign and eradicate all calamities, omens, and inauspicious signs under heaven. We, though foolish, wish to assist the heavens, allowing the qi of Great Yang to shine brightly, the emperor’s power to flourish daily, treacherous cunning to be extinguished, evil men to be barred from action, bandits and thieves to vanish, and malevolent spirits to conceal themselves, never again to arise. May we hear of this?\n\nExcellent is the question of the Six Disciples! The heavens command the Perfected Ones to speak.\n\nWe obey.\n\nWhen the noble man is free from worry, the malevolent ministers and petty men dare not act. Victory is already assured, and disasters will naturally cease.\n\nNow, I shall fully expound the celestial model for you, disciples, so that not a fraction is lost. Record it as you follow.\n\nWe obey.\n\nThus, the celestial laws manifest signs, which the sages of antiquity constantly emulated, never daring to transgress. They perpetually suppressed inauspicious forces, severed cunning, and prevented malevolent ministers from acting—all by adhering to the celestial laws. Their aim was to ensure the daily rise of yang qi, the radiance of fire to grow ever brighter, never knowing decline. To achieve this, they swiftly severed the qi of metal, preventing its dominion.\n\nWhen metal qi is severed, wood qi gains dominion, and fire qi shines brilliantly without end. What does this mean?\n\nThe ruler must swiftly abolish weapons, for weapons belong to the category of metal. This is why they must be swiftly abolished. Yet now, rulers in their dominion frequently bestow blades and arms upon their ministers—weapons of metal, which the emperor himself grants to reign. This is called the \"reign of metal.\" When metal reigns, it suppresses wood and weakens fire. When metal reigns, it deprives the movements of jia and yi wood of their qi. If wood is severed and yi qi is cut off, fire cannot shine. When wood reigns, earth cannot be born. If fire does not shine, earth qi rises daily, the qi of the earth stirs repeatedly, and inauspicious omens arise. Thus, they must be swiftly eradicated.\n\nIt is said: the category of weapons must not be bestowed; metal objects and arms must not be granted, for they suppress and sever inauspiciousness.\n\nThe heavens’ aversion is no different from that of the spirits. We wish to know: why does the rise of metal suppress wood, and in turn, cause fire to wane?\n\nExcellent is your challenging question! It may be called an entry into the Dao. The Perfected Ones wish to delight in knowing its great effects. Thus, when metal weapons are deployed in spring, they injure the movements of jia and yi wood, causing the Azure Emperor of Heaven to be displeased and the Vermilion Emperor to rage greatly. Bing, ding, si, and wu become disobedient. Seeking to avenge the grievances of their parents, they compel the fire phase to act, generating many calamities, omens, inauspicious signs, malevolent harms, and treacherous cunning. The law, in reverse, causes fire to govern in chaos—is this not impermissible? The great fault lies here.\n\nExcellent indeed!\n\nWe wish to know: why must there be many malevolent ministers, cunning treacherous men, and bandits?\n\nI shall explain again for the Perfected Ones, so that you may clearly understand. The celestial model decrees: when parents encounter harm, their children must avenge it. Those who avenge grievances inevitably gather inauspiciousness. The deceitful, flattering, cunning, and reckless youths—those capable of lawlessness—are the ones who avenge grievances and commit rebellion.\n\nThus, from the bestowal of metal weapons arises the suppression of wood, and the governance of fire cannot be pacified. This is the eternal model of the heavens, not to be altered for any reason.\n\nIf the Six Perfected Ones do not believe my words, then swiftly sever metal weapons. Whoever dares to wield them shall bear grave punishment. Immediately, fire disasters will be eradicated, governance will be swiftly pacified, and all under heaven will say, \"Excellent!\" The reason is this: fire represents the ruler, and thus its transformations and omens are the most severe. The other four phases cannot compare.\n\nIf you wish to further know its clear effects, observe Mars, whose transformations are the most severe—this is the evident proof. The other four stars cannot compare.\n\nTake heed of my words and writings; the celestial laws do not err by even a fraction.\n\nWe obey.\n\nProceeding, I shall again clarify the celestial laws for the Six Disciples. Thus, when metal qi is entirely eradicated and severed, wood qi gains great dominion, suppressing the earth phase below. Yellow qi cannot arise, and so in spring, wood reigns and earth dies.\n\nThus, in spring, the heavens forcibly sever metal qi at wu, allowing wood to flourish, fire qi to grow ever brighter, and metal qi to be imprisoned. Cunning men are severed and eradicated. When metal is imprisoned, water qi rests. Yin does not dare harm yang, and life below flourishes. Be cautious, and there will be no disasters or omens.\n\nWhen wood qi reigns without metal, it gains ascendancy and acts. Earth qi dies. The people and ministers are loyal, reverent, and trustworthy, daring not to transgress. This is the celestial model, the contract of the heavens—a constant nature and eternal principle of heaven and earth. Do you understand?\n\nWe obey.\n\nProceed. You have already understood.\n\nNow, I shall again clarify the celestial laws for the Six Disciples, to be passed down orally.\n\nToday, the world follows weapons—metal qi. Moreover, rulers, at the beginning of the year, bestow blades and arms, or during tours of the four directions, grant metal weapons upon halting. The ruler is king, and to bestow metal weapons upon others is called \"king of metal.\" When metal reigns, water is minister. When metal reigns, it harms wood. When water is minister, it harms fire.\n\nThe northwest is yin; the southeast is yang. When lesser yin gains dominion, greater yin becomes minister. This is called the two qi both overcoming yang. Disasters arise below, treacherous men act lawlessly, yin qi stirs and generates many false words, and bandits arise. This is the celestial model. Do the Six Disciples understand?\n\nWe obey.\n\nThus, the Six Perfected Ones have understood. Take heed of the celestial laws.\n\n\"Yes, yes. Now we humbly ask: the southeast is yang—why then is it called the 'Earth Gate'? And the northwest is yin—why is it called the 'Heavenly Gate'?\n\nIndeed, gates and doors are where the qi of Heaven and Earth first arises, where all things enter and exit. Thus, the southeast is the utmost yang; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born—hence the southeast is called the Earth Gate. The northwest is the utmost yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born—hence it is called the Heavenly Gate. If the Perfected Ones wish to know its proof: when the first yang line rises at *jiazi*, and the first yin line rises at *jiawu*—this is what it means.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven is like a cycle: when it completes its circuit, it returns to the beginning. How could it ever cease? When a king takes up his mandate, the subtle qi of the corresponding phase will follow and arise.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Let me now explain one matter fully to the Six Perfected Ones. When a ruler greatly mobilizes troops, it causes the phase of Wood to be greatly startled and lose its qi, allowing Earth to gain dominion. When Earth gains dominion, Metal becomes its great minister. When Metal is great minister, it causes weapons and armor to be frequently deployed. The qi of *Qian* and *Dui* stirs, and in the northwest, barbarians, treacherous bandits, and thieves arise in great numbers—this is the natural law. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot prevent it. Therefore, one must urgently suppress and sever Metal’s implements to prevent its phase from flourishing.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Having heard the Master expound the celestial laws, we now know their awesome power. If one knows to revere them, good fortune follows.\n\nNow, the Radiant Master of August Heaven, in compassion for our ignorance and blindness, has deigned to explain the celestial laws in full. But is this teaching meant for only one ruler’s reign? Or are these the universal laws for all under Heaven?\n\nIndeed, Heaven establishes this as the constant celestial model. Yet if the phases of Wood or Fire recklessly rise, or if Metal’s peaks and coins spur the frequent dominion of thieves, it brings great harm and makes governance difficult to stabilize. If Metal’s qi gains great dominion, the harm is severe. Only by aligning with our celestial laws and severing it will good fortune immediately follow. When governance flourishes, treacherous ministers vanish—Heaven’s laws do not deceive.\n\nWe humbly wish to hear the essential intent behind Heaven’s establishment of this model.\n\nAh, how thorough are the Six Disciples’ questions! Know then: Heaven and Earth regard the east as lesser yang—the beginning of the ruler’s birth. Thus, the sun rises in the east. The south is taken as greater yang, and the ruler is yang. Thus, *Li* is the sun, and the sun is the ruler. The south is Fire. Fire is the ruler, and the south is summer—the season when the four seasons nurture growth, when pregnancy and flourishing are at their peak. Its virtue is the greatest, hence it is the ruler. This is the celestial model.\n\nThough *jue* tone belongs to the east, it is aligned with the east’s position, and Fire’s position is aligned with the south. Now, as the qi of Great Peace flourishes and arrives, Heaven will exalt yang qi. Seeing the Six Perfected Ones’ questions, I know you are sent by Heaven. Thus, I have explained in full the methods for exalting the greater yang ruler’s phase. Take heed, Perfected Ones.\n\nYes, yes.\n\n**The First Hundred Methods for Bestowing Upon Subordinates**\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in compassion, has fully expounded the celestial laws for us unworthy ones. We humbly ask one further matter: when the emperor meets with his ministers and even the common people—Heaven’s laws regard the ruler as their father and mother. When he meets his ministers, they are the ruler’s worthy sons, assisting in governing Heaven and Earth. The people are the ruler’s unfilial children, managing the fields and livelihoods. When meeting them, should there not be something to bestow? If nothing is bestowed, grace and love do not extend to the people and ministers, leaving the Red Children with no Way to recite. What is to be done?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, is your question! When meeting the worthy, bestow culture; when meeting the hungry, bestow food; when meeting the cold, bestow clothing. Why bestow culture upon the worthy? Culture arises in the east and is illuminated in the south. Thus, celestial patterns arise in the northeast, and scriptures emerge from the northeast, where Heaven reveals its images. The tiger has patterns and dwells in *yin*; the dragon has patterns and dwells in *chen*, ascending to Heaven. *Li* is the locus of culture, governing the southern phase. Thus, the Three Luminaries embody culture, and the sun is the greatest illumination.\n\nTherefore, culture arises in the east and flourishes in the south. Thus, the sun rises in the east and is at its peak in the south. Heaven commands the emperor to model himself after Heaven’s laws. Thus, he must bestow culture to foster its flourishing. Greater yang is the phase of Fire, and the sun, rising with Fire, can distinguish and perceive culture—what is cultured and what is not—just as it records right and wrong under Heaven.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Go forth, Six Perfected Ones—you have now awakened to the great Dao of Heaven.\"\n\nNow the August Heaven’s Illuminated Master has fully expounded the laws of the Dao for Heaven—yet nothing remains obscure. We wish to know: by what culture should these be bestowed?\n\nHow thorough, Six Disciples, in your questioning of Heaven’s affairs! It should be thus:\n\nIn all matters, one often suffers from [lacuna]—yet those who delight in modeling themselves after Heaven’s laws and swiftly attain Great Peace need only gather the true Daoist texts of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, selecting from them the most excellent, and compile these into a Heavenly Canon. This shall be bestowed upon the multitude of worthies, that each may depart and recite them.\n\nNow, considering the essential meaning of past and present, what is the great principle for transforming the people and ministers?\n\nIt is this: that each nurture their nature and settle their bodies. Thus shall the great worthies and scholars rejoice without exception, harboring no ill will. Each shall reflect upon the laws of Heaven and Earth, and knowing them, shall cause people to revere and cherish their lord above all, while treasuring their own lives. They shall deeply understand how rare and precious a wise ruler is. Among them, the greatest worthies and benevolent ones shall constantly fear their lord’s aging, and so seek out extraordinary and uncommon methods. These shall be presented to the emperor—therefore, the Daoist texts and writings must be bestowed.\n\nExcellent, excellent. You have now understood.\n\nNow, if one were to casually bestow upon them weapons, armor, gold, or goods, they would return and each contemplate matters of profit, thereby fostering a martial qi above and corrupting the ignorant common folk below. This would give rise to profit-seeking schemes, the mobilization of armies, the forging of metal, the emergence of cunning and deceit, the outbreak of banditry and theft, the dominance of metal’s influence, the harm to the Wood phase, and the disorder of the Fire qi—such is the natural pattern of Heaven’s law.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask why not bestow upon them other classical texts and scriptures?\nThose other books are not the true Daoist writings; they would only confuse worthy scholars, offering no benefit to governance and failing to nurture their nature. The classics, meanwhile, are too superficial—if worthy scholars recite them daily, they cannot be entrusted with them.\n\nHowever, one may select from the excellent classics of high antiquity, the excellent classics of middle antiquity, and the excellent classics of recent antiquity, compiling them into writings to bestow upon them. Yet I fear these are not the Way of nurturing nature, for they may lead people to disregard their own worth and instead indulge in empty scholarship.\n\nNevertheless, all writings that are good may be bestowed, so that they may recite, study, and emulate them, thereby transforming toward goodness.\n\nExcellent, excellent. The six disciples have now awakened to this.\n\n**On the Human Key to Prosperity and Decline, One Hundred and Ten**\n\nNow, the Celestial Master has graciously spoken to us foolish students. We humbly ask: what is the meaning behind bestowing food upon the hungry and clothing upon the cold?\n\nIndeed, the hungry yearn for food, the cold yearn for clothing. When this heartfelt longing is fulfilled, their thoughts turn to their lord and king, and even in old age, they do not forget. They aspire to repay with utmost effort, daring not to harbor divided loyalty. The grace and love thus permeate the people, so that if they obtain any rare, extraordinary methods or excellent Daoist texts, they dare not conceal them. They will surely reflect and present them to their ruler, that he may enjoy longevity. This is why such bestowals are made—this is called \"aiding the destitute and relieving the urgent.\"\n\nThe worthy delight in texts, the hungry delight in food, the cold delight in clothing. When a lord bestows upon his ministers and people, he must ensure each receives what they desire, and then the world will be content and submit. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThus, Heaven’s nature exalts the Dao and virtue above, and penal law below. The East embodies the Dao, the South embodies virtue. The Dao governs life, so all things are born in the East. Virtue governs nurturance, so all things are nourished in the South. Heaven’s established pattern is that all things归向 the Dao and virtue, so the myriad beings all emerge from the Southeast and ascend. The six yang qi of Heaven and Earth’s four directions together engender life in the *chen* and *si* hours.\n\nDo you understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nHeaven’s law imposes penal law below, so the Northwest, being *shaoyin* and *taiyin*, embodies punishment and misfortune. Punishment and misfortune govern injury and killing, so all things wither, age, and decline in the West, and die in the North. When Heaven’s *qi* contends and battles, the six *yin* forces lack *yang*, and all beings hide within, fearing punishment and the rise of misfortune, not daring to emerge and appear.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven despises what is lowly below, so its creatures all feed on what is foul and discarded. Thus, the sages of antiquity, observing Heaven’s clear pattern, exalted the true Dao, virtuous power, and wondrous texts, while placing martial force below—this is evident proof.\n\nNow, when punishment, misfortune, and martial force arise in the Northwest and are exalted, it is called *yin* riding over *yang*, the base riding over the noble, giving rise to frequent contention and battle. This causes ministers and people to be disloyal, bringing no benefit to the king’s governance—how can such rule not be difficult?\n\nPerfected One, do you understand this?\nYes, yes.\nYou may be said to have awakened.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity always exalted the Dao, virtue, and texts, placing them in the highest and most excellent position, while weapons, armor, and military preparations were placed below. When one dwells alone, texts are placed upon the bed, and weapons beneath it. In this way, barbarians submit of their own accord, and bandits and thieves vanish day by day.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\nGo forth—you may be said to have truly understood.\n\nLet the Six Disciples ponder deeply the meaning of my writings. Present them to rulers of the highest Dao and virtue, and show them to all worthies—my words do not betray the enlightened clarity of Heaven and Earth.\n\nGo now, for this minor discourse is complete. If other matters remain unclear, return again to ask.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow the Six Perfected Ones, having received the Celestial Master’s stern teaching, shall retire each to a quiet place, reflect upon the Master’s words, and bring forth any points they do not understand, that the Celestial Master may reveal the decisive instruction.\n\nWhat is the meaning of these words?\n\nNow, Heaven naturally possesses the qi of the four seasons, and Earth naturally possesses the positions of the Five Phases. Their waxing, waning, flourishing, imprisonment, and decline follow their own times. Yet it is only when people arise and employ them that they can generate vital qi, causing the phases to alternately overcome and destroy one another.\n\nTsk, tsk!\n\nAlas! Though the Six Disciples study daily, it is of no benefit—rather, they grow more foolish, scarcely different from the ignorant. Why is this? The laws of Heaven and Earth decree that the rise and fall of the myriad things follow human agency.\n\nWhatever matters people collectively engage in, whatever things they value and employ, all flourish and generate vital qi. What people abandon and neglect all decline and become imprisoned. Thus, what people take up and pursue becomes their ruler, leader, and teacher. What they contend over becomes precious and without measure. What they abandon and neglect becomes base and without worth.\n\nTherefore, what the world’s people take up and employ flourishes of its own accord, generating vital qi—it need not wait for the qi of the four seasons or the Five Phases. Thus, the law of Heaven decrees that the rise and fall of people determine the rise and fall of the myriad things; nobility and baseness depend entirely upon human action.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity understood the unalterable laws of Heaven and dared not transgress them lightly. In the highest antiquity, people deeply revered the Dao, employed the Dao, and acted in accordance with the Dao—thus the Dao reigned. In the middle antiquity, when the Dao was abandoned and not practiced, it became imprisoned and declined, no longer esteemed. In the middle antiquity, when virtue was taken up and employed, virtue reigned. In the lower antiquity, when the highest virtue was abandoned, virtue again became imprisoned and declined.\n\nThus, when people take up and employ culture, culture reigns; when they take up and employ military force, military force reigns; when they take up and employ gold and coin, gold and coin reign; when they take up and employ wealth and goods, wealth and goods reign. Whatever the world’s people take up and employ flourishes of its own accord, generating vital qi. What they collectively abandon and do not employ becomes mere common things—why must they wait for the waxing of Heaven’s four seasons and the Five Phases before they can reign?\n\nWhy, in your studies, do you not grow ever clearer, but instead sink deeper into darkness and ignorance?\n\nIf even Perfected Ones remain thus, how much more do the common people violate Heaven’s prohibitions, insisting that this is not so!\n\nNow, comparing you to them, your folly is uniquely long-standing. If your words were true, would I, in expounding Heaven’s laws and resolving the inherited burdens of former kings to relieve the disasters they bequeathed, lead people into error with teachings that cannot be employed? If they were erroneous, how could they be put into practice?\n\nIf the Six Disciples still harbor doubts and wish to know the great efficacy of my Way, to discern whether it is truly true or not, then swiftly present it to a ruler of enlightened virtue, that he may put it into practice. Immediately, it will resonate with Heaven and Earth as an echo responds to sound—this will be clear proof of its efficacy.\n\nYet even now, Perfected Ones cannot deeply understand that it is people who cause things to flourish or decline, advance or retreat. Compared to you, the common people are no different from the blind—what distinction is there?\n\nNow, seeing that the Celestial Master has distinguished and explained these matters for his foolish disciples, have you understood? Is there any fault in this?\n\nOne who studies must strive to grasp the essential meaning, not merely recite the words. To know the decisive meaning is what Heaven, Earth, and the Dao resent in those who fail to comprehend.\n\nAgain, let learners refine and guard this teaching with care.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nCarry forth and record these celestial governance affairs, that they may suppress deceitful demons and prevent the virtuous ruler from losing the patterns of governance. Yes, yes.\n\n*End of Scroll Sixty-Five of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Beginning of Scroll Sixty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Section One Hundred Two: The Three-Five Judgment of Superiority and Inferiority*\n\nThe profoundly ignorant and benighted student, bowing twice in reverence, asked about a great doubt:\n\n\"What does this mean? Throughout the text, it repeatedly speaks of the Supreme August qi descending from heaven—yet now, I remain utterly unaware of what this Supreme August qi is. How can this be?\"\n\nThat you deeply question this shows you have already grasped the intent of the Dao. Listen carefully, and I shall explain it fully for the Perfected One.\n\nHeaven has its Three August Ones, Earth has its Three August Ones, and humanity has its Three August Ones.\nHeaven has its Five Emperors, Earth has its Five Emperors, and humanity has its Five Emperors.\nHeaven has its Three Kings, Earth has its Three Kings, and humanity has its Three Kings.\nHeaven has its Five Hegemons, Earth has its Five Hegemons, and humanity has its Five Hegemons.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nHeaven’s Three August Ones are like the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three August Ones are like high, low, and level terrain; humanity’s Three August Ones are like ruler, minister, and people.\nHeaven’s Five Emperors are like the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Emperors are like the Five Peaks; humanity’s Five Emperors are like the Five Phases and Five Viscera.\nHeaven’s Three Kings are like the Three Luminaries; Earth’s Three Kings are like high, low, and level terrain; humanity’s Three Kings are like ruler, minister, and people.\nHeaven’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Stars; Earth’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Peaks; humanity’s Five Hegemons are like the Five Phases and Five Viscera.\n\nThe Celestial Master, moved by pity for the ignorant student and compelled by necessity, revealed the celestial pattern. May I hear how their superiority and inferiority are determined?\n\nExcellent is your difficult question—it accords with the intent of Heaven and the heart of humanity and heaven, binding it for ten thousand generations without end.\n\nNow, Heaven’s Three August Ones: the superior is like the sun, the middling like the moon, and the inferior like the stars—such is the vast disparity in their superiority and inferiority.\nEarth’s Three August Ones: the superior is like the Five Peaks, the middling like level land, and the inferior like low-lying fields—such is the vast disparity in their superiority and inferiority.\nHumanity’s Three August Ones: the superior is like the ruler, the middling like the minister, and the inferior like the people—such is the vast disparity in their superiority and inferiority.\n\nHeaven’s Five Emperors: the superior is as if three parts of the sun in four; the middling is as if three parts of the moon in four; the inferior is as if three parts of the stars in four.\nEarth’s Five Emperors: the superior is as if three parts of the Five Peaks in four; the middling is as if three parts of level land in four; the inferior is as if three parts of low-lying fields in four.\nHumanity’s Five Emperors: the superior is as if three parts of a great state in four; the middling is as if three parts of a great minister in four; the inferior is as if three parts of the people in four.\n\nHeaven’s Three Kings: the superior is as if two parts of the sun in four; the middling is as if two parts of the moon in four; the inferior is as if two parts of the great stars in four.\nEarth’s Three Kings: the superior is as if two parts of the Five Peaks in four; the middling is as if two parts of level land in four; the inferior is as if two parts of low-lying fields in four.\nHumanity’s Three Kings: the superior is as if two parts of a great state in four; the middling is as if two parts of a great minister in four; the inferior is as if two parts of the people in four.\n\nHeaven’s Five Hegemons: the superior is as if one part of the sun in four; the middling is as if one part of the moon in four; the inferior is as if one part of the great stars in four.\nEarth’s Five Hegemons: the superior is as if one part of the Five Peaks in four; the middling is as if one part of level land in four; the inferior is as if one part of low-lying fields in four.\nHumanity’s Five Hegemons: the superior is as if one part of a great state in four; the middling is as if one part of a great minister in four; the inferior is as if one part of the people in four.\n\nThis is the Dao of Heaven—not far off, for the Three and Five each reflect one another.\n\nThus, Heaven has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons; Earth likewise has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons; and humanity likewise has its Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons. Why is there no difference in their multiplicity?\n\nI pray the Celestial Master elucidate the essential meaning.\n\nNow, Heaven, Earth, and humanity originally share the same primordial qi, divided into three forms, each with its own ancestral origin.\n\nThus, the Three August Ones are the ancestral heads; the Five Emperors are the rulers of their flourishing eras; the Three Kings are the rulers of their balanced eras; and the Five Hegemons are the qi of their final decline, perilous disorder, and punitive resurgence.\n\nTherefore, by the time of the Five Hegemons—when only one part in four remains—the celestial pattern is nearly severed. Beyond this, the inferior becomes too weak to restrain the superior, the yielding cannot restrain the firm, the few cannot restrain the many, and the Dao falls into great chaos, unable to govern itself.\n\nThus, it must rise again from above. What does this mean?\n\nThus, the Nine August Ones all first sprouted in the North; the Five Emperors first emerged in the East; the Three Kings flourished in the South; and the Five Hegemons reached their consummation in decline in the West.\n\nAll things born of Heaven arise as yang qi, following primordial qi, merging with the Great Yin to germinate. At birth, they must emerge and grow, hence they flourish in the East. Once born, they must thrive, hence they reach their peak in the South. Having flourished, they must bear fruit, hence they wither and mature in the West.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, completes its cycle.\n\nYet things cannot remain in fruition forever—they die, and nothing more. But the seeds of their roots must regenerate, so yin and yang together enter the Gate of Heaven, merging their qi in Qian, to begin anew from above. This is the natural nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nWhy then do Heaven, Earth, and humanity not share the same Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons?\n\nExcellent indeed—your question grasps its meaning.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity are divided into three domains, each dwelling apart.\n\nThe Way of the August Ones is like the father in a household; the Way of the Emperors is like the mother; the Way of the Kings is like the son; and the Way of the Hegemons is like the wife.\n\nNow, these three domains dwell separately—how could they share the same father, mother, son, and wife? It is as if people were divided into three households—could they possibly share the same parents, children, and spouse?\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nBe cautious—do not recklessly challenge what you do not grasp. The Dao of Heaven has its own fixed and constant laws; one cannot forcibly oppose them, nor dare act with brute strength.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThough each time you ask, you transgress the taboos of the Heavenly Master, yet without asking, there is no way to know. I wish to beg one more word.\n\nProceed.\n\nNow, there are forty-eight sections—how do these forty-eight sections operate?\n\nExcellent and thorough—your question is most fitting.\n\nThose who follow the will of Heaven in this practice will prevent calamities from arising. Those who lose the essential Dao of Heaven will find disasters unending. Thus, for myriad generations, they inherit and bear the consequences in succession.\n\nA good ruler can cause misfortunes to subside on their own, dissolving their transgressions. But the most essential Way of self-cultivation, when reversed, allows perverse qi to spread throughout the world. Thus, residual disasters arise, becoming the adversities of inherited consequences.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nNow, listen carefully to my words.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe supreme ruler of Heaven is like the sun; the middling, like the moon; the lowest, like the stars.\nThe supreme ruler of Earth is like the Five Peaks; the middling, like level land; the lowest, like low-lying fields.\nThe supreme ruler of humanity is like the sovereign; the middling, like the ministers; the lowest, like the common people.\n\nWhere the Way is complete, its people and the myriad things are all free from illness and at peace, without thieves, deceivers, flatterers, or fraud.\nHeaven and Earth know no disasters—this is called \"supreme harmony,\" where the Way is complete.\n\nWhere three of four parts hold the Way, three parts of the people are peaceful, loyal, and trustworthy, while one part suffers injury or death, or becomes thieves and villains, together giving rise to perverse and strange transformations—greater or lesser in proportion to that one part.\n\nWhere two of four parts hold the Way, half the people and the myriad things fall ill and grow untrusting; half the people harbor deceitful hearts, and Heaven’s strange transformations occur in half.\n\nWhere only one of four parts holds the Way, three parts of the people are all afflicted, false and flattering, all become thieves, without any thought of mutual benefit—only one part remains good.\n\nHeaven’s anomalies arise without cease, shifting from place to place, never leaving their appointed bounds. Why is this so?\n\nExcellent—your words are most fitting.\nWhere the Way is complete, its virtue and power extend to all, and what virtue reaches, it governs. Thus, the myriad things are all good, universally receiving its virtue and power—hence, all is at peace.\n\nWhere three of four parts hold the Way, its virtue and power fail to reach one part—hence, one part is inauspicious.\n\nWhere two of four parts hold the Way, virtue and power do not extend to half—hence, half is inauspicious.\n\nWhere only one of four parts holds the Way, virtue is faint, barely reaching one part, failing the other three—hence, three parts are inauspicious.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of old, wishing to know their own excellence or deficiency, divined by this method—never erring by even one in ten thousand.\n\nWhy do those beyond virtue’s reach fall ill?\nWhere virtue and power do not extend, there is no governance, no leadership; the myriad things lack direction and descend into chaos, plagued by illness, treachery, and unending thievery.\n\nThe ancients governed by this divination, discerning the depth or shallowness of virtue, observing which qi it aligned with, thus profoundly knowing the gains and losses, the rise and decline of governance—clear as the sun and moon.\n\nExcellent, excellent! How may these deficiencies be remedied?\nExcellent—now that you, Perfected One, have grasped the Heavenly Canon, you should halt this flow of disasters and inherited burdens upon the myriad things.\n\nHow may these disasters be halted?\nOnly by the Celestial Master instructing the multitude of worthies, enabling them to attain the qi of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nThus, each should thoroughly discuss the true Dao in its entirety, each reflecting on the first day to govern their own toil and illness—then their former harmony will be restored, and all will be made complete.\n\nExcellent, excellent.\nProceed, Perfected One—observe the precepts.\n\nIndeed, indeed. I humbly receive the forty-eight precepts with reverence.\n\nHow long or short is the practice of the Way?\nYour question is most thorough.\n\nI dare not be remiss—the Way of Heaven is most weighty, the master’s command most stern; thus, I venture to ask in detail.\n\nExcellent—you know the proper conduct of a disciple, and may thereby comprehend the intent of the Heavenly Way.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Way has three aspects, corresponding to the Greater Yang, the Greater Yin, and the Balanced Harmony.\n\nThe most excellent practice externally; the next, in the middle; the next, internally. The hegemons have no Way.\n\nThey merely borrow the path within the Three Kings—this Way is the shortest.\n\nThe Supreme Sovereign of Heaven, most excellent, practices most externally.\nThe Nine Sovereigns share one Way, with the less excellent ranked inwardly. The most excellent walk without moving; the next, move slightly; the next, move with some awareness.\n\nThe Fifteen Emperors share one middle Way.\nThe most excellent practice externally; the next, practice with awareness; the least excellent, practice with haste.\n\nThe Three Kings and nine men share one inner Way, riding as they practice. The next move with slight urgency; the least, gallop.\n\nThe Fifteen Hegemons borrow the innermost extreme path. The most excellent fly externally; the middling, fly swiftly; the least, like an arrow.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nExcellent, excellent.\n\nPerfected One, you have inquired of this matter before—why so detailed now? Since my birth, I have wondered why years alternate between long and short, why days grow thick and thin, advance and retreat. Had I not asked the Heavenly Master, I might never have known. I wish to hear the meaning.\n\nExcellent, excellent are your words. The thickest are the days of Heaven; the next thickest, the days of Earth; the next, the days of humanity; and the thinnest, the days of the myriad things. Do you understand, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, and ask no more of this. Such matters are your private concern, not because I would withhold explanation from you. The world’s gatherings hold no profit in this, nor does it benefit emperors and kings in bearing their inherited burdens, nor relieve the sorrows of the common people. Thus I do not distinguish the Way for you—not out of reluctance.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYou have repeatedly transgressed the Heavenly Master’s taboos—this is a grave fault. It is not arrogance, but your joy in knowing the affairs of Heaven that brings you here with such private longing. For your sake, I will explain all fully.\n\nIndeed, indeed. Go now.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\n**Right: Method for Distinguishing the Conduct and Degrees of Excellence Among the Nine Sovereigns, Fifteen Emperors, Nine Kings, and Fifteen Hegemons.**\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Sixty-Six, Concluded.\n#1 Originally written as \"one hundred one,\" amended according to the Dunhuang manuscript *Catalogue of the Tai Ping Jing*.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Sixty-Seven\n\n**Six Crimes and Ten Governance Principles, One Hundred Three**\n\nPerfected One, how many crimes do ordinary people commit?\n\nOrdinary people commit no transgressions—what crimes could they have?\n\nAh, Perfected One, how benighted you are!\n\nThis foolish one does not comprehend. From birth, I have never heard that people incur crimes without violating the law.\n\nYour words are correct and align with common understanding.\n\nYet you fail to see that ordinary people bear six great crimes, which cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations.\n\nPerfected One, you study yet remain blind to these manifest crimes—does your learning not suffer from confusion?\n\nThis foolish one is suddenly awakened and does not suffer from confusion.\n\nYet you remain suddenly unaware. When common people die with grievances bound in their hearts, is this not truly dire?\n\nThey die in ignorance, only to awaken afterward.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, people have first been deluded and later enlightened—what fault lies in this?\n\nI wish to hear of it.\n\nIndeed, when people accumulate the Dao without limit yet refuse to teach others to awaken and seek life, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they sever the Dao of Heaven’s generation and become enemies of Heaven.\n\nWhen people accumulate virtue without limit yet refuse to earnestly teach others to guard virtue, nurture their nature, and act with care, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they sever the Earth’s nurturing virtue and become enemies of Earth, greatly faulting humanity.\n\nWhen people amass wealth by the millions yet refuse to relieve the destitute and aid the desperate, causing others to die of hunger and cold, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: these harmonious goods are the means by which Heaven and Earth enact benevolence, circulating and sustaining one another to prevent scarcity. Now, by hoarding and cutting off their flow, they prevent their universal distribution and become enemies of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. Such wealth cannot be long retained and must circulate.\n\nHeaven generates people, endowing them with knowledge to love good and hate evil. Yet, though blessed with understanding, they recognize Heaven’s Dao yet scorn it, refusing to study earnestly to save themselves. Though they may attain long life, inheriting the celestial mandate and their ancestors’ bodies, they instead treat themselves lightly, neglecting study, and regard death as sudden. Only at death do they lament their grievances—this crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations, leaving life in ignorance and becoming enemies of Heaven. The reason is this: Heaven itself strives to practice the Dao, thus it is ever auspicious; to lose the Dao is to invite misfortune and death. Though Heaven loves people and delights in goodness, imprinting the Dao upon their bodies, people refuse to practice it earnestly. They are called people without the Dao, and Heaven has no means to grant them the Dao and longevity. Instead, they sever Heaven’s Dao and become its enemies.\n\nWhen people are born knowing virtue and goodness yet refuse to study earnestly to cultivate virtue, instead scorning virtue and nurturing evil, treating themselves lightly and acting wrongly, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they act contrary to Earth. Earth delights in virtue and nurtures, yet these people neglect such matters, taking no joy in virtue. They love their ancestors’ bodies yet become enemies of Earth.\n\nHeaven generates people, fortunately endowing each with strength and ability to clothe and feed themselves. Yet they refuse to exert themselves, instead suffering hunger and cold, betraying their ancestors’ bodies, and treating their own strength lightly. Though they could obtain clothing and food through effort, they constantly lament their poverty and hunger, relying solely on the wealthy, depending on them to survive—this crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth generate all goods to nurture people, and each should gather according to their strength, taking enough to avoid scarcity. Instead, they idle and neglect their strength, treating themselves lightly. Or, in their demands, they act without harmony, forcibly taking others’ goods, becoming enemies of the harmonious mean. Their crime clearly merits death.\n\nThese are the six great crimes, which Heaven abhors. Their crimes cannot be absolved.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI wish to ask, Heavenly Master, which of these crimes is the gravest?\n\nAh, how your words reveal your ignorance! Why do you ask?\n\nThese are crimes that extinguish entire families. How can you speak of their gravity?\n\nThis foolish one is deeply perplexed and does not grasp the essential meaning.\n\nNow, let the Heavenly Master further elucidate, that I may fully awaken, deeply understand the intent, and never again transgress.\n\nIndeed, Perfected One, your words are excellent. My discourse shall now be revealed, and you should follow closely and record it earnestly.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now. At present, August Heaven possesses the Dao and employs it to generate all things, the teeming multitude, all of whom depend on its mandate. Yet great Daoist masters, though they may silently comprehend it deeply, store it within their bellies and refuse to teach others earnestly. Teaching people the Dao is like giving fire to others. Few may come to take it, yet it does not diminish the source. Even if an infinite number come to take it, it does not diminish the source. Now, we are fortunate to share it, to teach the people of the world, to assist Heaven in generating beings, to assist Earth in nurturing forms, and to assist the Emperor in rectifying governance. Moreover, let each embrace the Dao, seeking life and hating death, enabling them to govern and assist others in governance. Let them no longer violate the law or act with wickedness and malice. With their hearts made good, they will assist Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor, nurturing the twelve thousand things, each delighting in long life. Let people harbor benevolent hearts and no longer lightly harm the myriad things. Then Heaven will be greatly pleased, Earth will be greatly joyful, and the Emperor will be greatly delighted, free from sorrow. Is not the merit thus accumulated vast indeed?\n\nWhen one person teaches and transforms, it is as if enlightening a hundred foolish ones. When a hundred people all return, each teaching ten thousand, and those ten thousand all teach, they will have transformed a hundred million people. When a hundred million all teach, the teaching becomes boundless. This supreme goodness harmonizes with Heaven’s heart above and penetrates the infinite below, so that the people all delight in life and in doing good. If the Emperor wanders without duty, what harm does it bring to others that he does not strive to instruct and admonish them?\n\nNow, people are fortunate to have received the admonitions of former masters, deeply embracing the supreme Dao and sealing it away, yet they do not teach and instruct others. This leaves people with nowhere to turn for refuge, causing them all to die unjustly with grievances unresolved—such is called severing the Dao of Heaven. Many lose the Dao and act recklessly, so that Heaven cannot grant them long life, nor Earth long nurturance. Indeed, people cannot be without the Dao. The petty man, lacking the Dao, often demeans himself, joining in rebellion, violating the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth, rising as bandits and thieves, harming one another, transgressing the king’s laws, and causing the noble man deep sorrow. The chaos becomes unmanageable, and the king worries day and night, grieving and distressed, causing Heaven and Earth to lose their proper order. Disasters and anomalies arise without end, leaving a burden for the Emperor. I have not yet spoken exhaustively—severing the Dao of Heaven is a grave and treasonous offense, its transgressions too numerous to record. Thus, I have merely outlined its essentials to show the Perfected One the gravity of right and wrong, and whether such a crime warrants death. Even in death, its excesses remain, flowing into future generations. How lamentable! Perfected One, be cautious indeed.\n\nOnly the Perfected One knows this truth, and thus may be said to have attained enduring fortune, far from harm. Indeed, indeed. I dare not depart from the admonitions. Yet you are already wise and enlightened, understanding the Mandate of Heaven. You will surely live and depart from death, no longer doubting.\n\nNow, I humbly report the Mandate of Heaven’s Dao and wish to know the admonitions of Earth’s virtue. The great virtue of Earth lies in its steadfast compliance with Heaven’s Dao, its love for nurturing the myriad things, so that all beings, great and small, receive its grace and are raised to completion. Therefore, those of great virtue and great power should model their conduct after this. Fortunate to have received the merit and effort of former masters, they embrace and conceal the boundless virtue of the good Dao.\n\nVirtue, when used to teach others, is like standing before a great river and drinking from it. If few come to learn virtue, it does not harm its source; if boundless numbers come to learn virtue, it still does not harm its source. Strive to teach and instruct, so that all ordinary people know to uphold greatness and embrace virtue, each cherishing and nurturing their own body. The good among them may assist Heaven in nurturing and growing things above, and assist Earth in rearing and maturing things below, all joining forces with a single heart, free of malice.\n\nAmong them, those of great wisdom and easily enlightened minds may be transformed and elevated to assist the ruler. Those of moderate virtue may serve as officials and teachers, while even the least knowledgeable may still become teachers among the common people. All people will delight in the transformation of virtue and do good. Such teaching benefits Heaven above and Earth below, forming the root of great transformation and assisting the Emperor in nurturing the people, preventing them from committing evil or wickedness. The noble man may govern with ease, free from worry, and his merit will be manifest and great. Heaven and Earth will cherish him, and he may be promoted in office.\n\nYet now, some possess vast virtue but instead feign ignorance and obstruct the path of the Dao, failing to assist Heaven in nurturing what is nascent, failing to assist Earth in maturing what is developing, and failing to assist the Emperor in harmonizing the people. They leave later generations ignorant and benighted, unable to distinguish black from white, persisting in death without change, becoming petty men who cannot move east or west. They recklessly demean themselves, following one another in wrongdoing, accumulating deceit and treachery. Above and below, they can no longer teach one another, stumbling in darkness and confusion, without restraint or taboo. They violate the patterns of Heaven above and the forms of Earth below, their conduct opposing the four seasons and disrupting the five phases. This causes the noble man great sorrow and incites harm among petty men, leading to banditry and theft, sometimes even self-destruction, bringing disgrace upon their parents and cutting off their lineage.\n\nNow, I have merely outlined the essentials for the Perfected One, revealing the beginning so that the multitude may awaken and spur themselves on. Yet they refuse to teach the enduring virtue—this is called severing Earth’s nurturing Dao, and its transgressions are as grave as this. Such conduct is formless, and even in death, its excesses remain, flowing into future generations. Does the Perfected One understand? How lamentable! How lamentable!\n\nThe Perfected One understands early—this may yet be called gaining life. Be ever vigilant. Indeed, indeed.\n\nI have reverently received the prohibitions of the Dao and virtue, and now wish to hear of the conduct of the benevolent.\n\nNow, all things of value that Heaven and Earth produce are bestowed upon humanity, rootless and unattached—neither clinging to Heaven above nor to Earth below. These things arise from the harmony of the central qi, meant to circulate freely, floating and flowing to fulfill their office: aiding the destitute and relieving the urgent.\n\nThose who hoard gold, silver, and precious goods—households of vast wealth, with tens of millions or more—let their stores rot and decay. Yet if the wise and discerning distribute them, bestowing upon the poor with joy, this is called benevolence alone. It aids Earth in nurturing forms and assists the Emperor in preserving the good and reverent among the people.\n\nA household of tens of millions can sustain ten thousand families, giving of the old and receiving the new. Let there be no hasty desire for profit, and virtue will harmonize with Heaven and Earth, its fame spreading to distant lands. Thus, one may always obtain new goods while the decaying ones are removed.\n\nAmong them, the greatest worthies daily report their deeds to the Emperor. The lesser worthies raise them up in their villages. As for the most foolish—those who fail to repay kindness—there are scarcely twelve or thirteen in ten. How could this impoverish anyone?\n\nWhen good deeds never cease, the great worthies and enlightened ones raise them up, their names resounding throughout the land. Travelers from the four seas fill the roads to follow their Way. When the enlightened king and sagely lord hear of them, seeing how they aid in nurturing the people, they rejoice greatly. Thus, they summon them, raising them to the highest ranks, and through this, they attain honor and nobility. Their legacy endures without end, becoming the greatest of benevolence—rare under Heaven. Above, they do not betray their ancestors; below, they do not betray their descendants. Heaven cherishes them, the hundred spirits benefit them, and the Emperor treats them as a radiant friend. Neighbors regard them as parents. Their merit is inscribed in Heaven and Earth, never to depart; their emoluments are fixed in office, never to diminish; their names are recorded among the people, never to fade.\n\nHow can one not practice benevolence?\n\nYet some chance upon fertile lands, obtaining the wealth of Heaven and Earth’s central harmony, amassing countless treasures—gold, silver, and precious goods in the tens of millions. Instead of sharing, they seal and hide them in dark chambers, letting all rot. When the destitute come seeking aid, they curse and refuse. Even when they grant something, they do not do so readily but demand repayment with interest—sometimes doubling, sometimes quintupling. They bestow upon the rich and cut off the poor, letting them starve and freeze to death, mocking them without reason.\n\nThey incur Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s blame, and become the greatest enemies of humanity. The hundred spirits despise them.\n\nWhy is this? These goods arise from the harmony of Heaven and Earth, meant to nourish all people. Such households merely encounter their gathering place—like rats in a granary, always sated alone. Yet the grain of the great storehouse was never meant for the rats alone. The wealth of the treasury was never meant for one person. Those in need should all draw from it.\n\nFools, lacking understanding, believe they will possess it forever, unaware that it is the accumulation of ten thousand corpses, all meant to find clothing and food therein. Their love turns to irrational anger and joy, refusing to exert themselves to aid the destitute and relieve the urgent. They let ten thousand households perish—unable to plant in spring or harvest in autumn. Their grievances rise in a clamor to Heaven, moving it to sorrow and Earth to tremble.\n\nThose who do not aid the noble in relieving the destitute are the greatest of the unbenevolent between Heaven and Earth. Even when beseeched for offerings to the spirits, they refuse. The hundred spirits loathe them. They wish to cut off their lineage, and their villages curse them to die. When bandits hear of them, they gather forces to rush their gates, besieging their households until they are impoverished and near death. Yet still, they refuse to give, instead burying their wealth deep in the earth, hiding it from sight. They recklessly cut off the world’s resources, depriving the land of its use, and instead strengthen the underworld. Heaven abhors them; Earth ails from them, deeming them a great calamity.\n\nThe goods of central harmony dwindle day by day, and thus, they sit in want. The starving and freezing grow ever more numerous, becoming their greatest enemies.\n\nNow, Heaven delights in the Dao, Earth delights in virtue, and central harmony delights in benevolence. All things are meant to reside between Heaven and Earth, circulating to provide for all. Yet when people lack, these goods are buried instead, sick and stifled, unable to emerge and be seen.\n\nHeaven and Earth never desired wealth for themselves. Heaven delights in human life; Earth delights in human nurturance. Ignorant petty men obstruct the wealth of Heaven and Earth’s central harmony, preventing its circulation and sufficiency. They kill what Heaven has given life and harm what Earth has nurtured. They recklessly bury and hide this wealth, impoverishing the state, depleting its resources, and failing to save the lives of its people. They leave virtuous rulers to govern in emptiness.\n\nGold, silver, precious goods, and wealth are created through human labor, truly arduous. They should serve the state’s needs, yet they are cast aside without reason, removed from above and below. Earth does not delight in possessing them, deeming them a great affliction, a great burden.\n\nNow, the unbenevolence of fools is so grave—should they not die for such sins?\n\nAmong them, there are those who, suddenly insatiable, contend in lawsuits, wronging themselves to seize the wealth of the weak and small, never knowing restraint.\n\nI have merely shown the Perfected One the essentials, revealing the beginning. The transgressions of the greatly unbenevolent are too numerous to record, making wealth and resources difficult to manage. The Perfected One should ponder this deeply.\n\nThus, the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and central harmony despise them. Even in death, their sins remain, destined to flow into future generations. Perfected One, do you now awaken to this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHow lamentable! I do not wish to hear more.\n\nIf the Perfected One leaves behind such words, Heaven will surely take your life, that you may awaken and repent. Then, perhaps, you may yet live.\n\nBe vigilant in your affairs.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI have reverently received the precepts of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, and wish to hear why those with knowledge do not study the true Dao.\n\nExcellent are your words.\n\nWhen Heaven gives birth to humanity, it bestows upon them the fortune of wisdom, that they may study and attain long life. Heaven possesses the Dao and delights in sharing it with people; Earth possesses virtue and delights in bestowing it upon them; central harmony possesses wealth and delights in nurturing them. Thus, people naturally seek the true Dao. If the Perfected One persists without cease, it is as though consulting with the spirits, daily singing of goodness, and goodness will naturally return to them. By serving the multitude of the worthy, they will collectively instruct and guide, and the path will no longer be distant. This allows one to preserve their body, not betray the legacy of their ancestors, while others meet early deaths, and only they fulfill their natural lifespan. While others are called evil, they alone are deemed good. As a teacher to the multitude, their name spreads to distant lands, inwardly embracing the true Dao, virtue, and benevolence. They aid Heaven in generating life, assist Earth in nurturing forms, and support the emperor in transforming the people. The highest teachers can transform boundless numbers, ensuring even the foolish abide by the Dao and commit no wrongs. Middle teachers can transform ten thousand, and lesser teachers can transform hundreds or thousands, bringing benefit to the sovereign by making the petty-minded aware of prohibitions and preventing them from committing hidden evils. Such teachers gain office without betraying their ancestors or shaming their descendants. Given such learning, how can one not pursue it?\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity all regarded exhorting people to study as their greatest concern, aiding Heaven and Earth in generation and completion, and assisting the emperor in governing disorder. This is the highest praise for the good between Heaven and Earth. Yet some fools, though born with the desire for knowledge, refuse to diligently study the true Dao. Instead, they delight in superficial splendor, acting to deceive others—cheating their parents as children, their ruler as subjects, and their superiors as inferiors. This is called deceiving Heaven, and their sins cannot be erased. Others indulge in worldly affairs and strife, following one another in wrongdoing. When they see the followers of the Perfected One, they mock them, saying, \"What is the use of study?\" Thus, they remain in darkness, their ignorance profound. They crave dominance yet cannot achieve it, recklessly claiming that Heaven and Earth are without measure and the worthy are without knowledge. They act wantonly, offending the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, their comings and goings without restraint. At home, they neglect their parents, gathering with the foolish to become wicked sons. When they serve as officials, they return to execute their parents, unable to reflect, and flee to become bandits, harming and killing without cease. This is precisely what Heaven abhors, Earth blames, the emperor grieves over, the hundred spirits detest, and parents despair of. This is the greatest calamity harming others, severing the lineage of their ancestors.\n\nIf one does not diligently study the true Dao and acts thus, in the eyes of the Perfected One, should they not die? Even in death, their sins remain, flowing to their descendants, who will still be called the lineage of evil men, the heirs of bandits. Will their wickedness not flow to future generations? Now, I have merely shown the Perfected One the beginning; their evils are too numerous to record, and their wealth and resources are difficult to manage. Perfected One, do you now awaken to this?\n\nBe vigilant, Perfected One.\n\nIndeed, indeed. How lamentable!\n\nYou know lamentation; you have already turned from evil.\n\nI have reverently heard these four matters and wish to hear what follows.\n\nNow, when Heaven gives birth to humanity, it endows them fully before sending them forth, ever delighting in their pursuit of the Dao and virtue. The benevolent, fortunate in their knowledge, can study virtue. Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things with virtue, delighting in people emulating them. Thus, the virtuous of the great antiquity endured humiliation, emulating Earth’s nurturing of all things. When people learn this, their hearts are ever joyful, no longer delighting in harm. They act with caution, daily doing good, no longer desiring evil. Like attracts like, and their stature grows ever higher and more distant. Through long accumulation, they become people of abundant virtue, to whom all respond, and the multitude turns toward them. Persisting in reverent goodness without cease, they become great teachers of virtue. Their virtue aids Heaven in nurturing the living, assists Earth in fostering growth, and delights in aiding the enlightened king in transforming the people, making them reverent and no longer knowing wickedness. In small virtue, they may transform hundreds or thousands; in great virtue, they may transform ten thousand or more. Thus, they turn ten thousand into teachers of virtue, their transformations boundless. Persisting in virtue, all people rejoice. Heaven and Earth love them, extending their years; ghosts and spirits favor them, collectively aiding and protecting them. Those with merit become the virtuous officials of the ruler, delighting not in harming others. They rejoice in goodness, and what they seek is ever attained. They dwell in constant joy, with none desiring to harm them. This originates from learning to follow goodness and cultivate virtue, thus reaching such heights. Their names resound in distant lands, their merits recorded in Heaven and Earth, not betraying their ancestors or shaming their descendants.\n\nYet some, though fortunate in knowledge and discerning good from evil, instead belittle themselves, not diligently studying to cultivate goodness and virtue. They follow the ignorant and benighted in evil, delighting in the use of force and martial prowess, their words ever harsh. Their speech is perverse, seeking to subdue others. They claim superiority, yet others surpass them; they boast of strength, yet others are mightier. Thus, all things under Heaven have their limits and can be controlled. When a great fire arises, it seems uncontrollable, yet water extinguishes it. When people do evil and rage, they seem uncontrollable, yet prison subdues them. When speech seems unrestrained, illness humbles them. Thus, Heaven and Earth govern humanity, each with its own measure. Yet people, though possessing knowledge, refuse to study diligently and instead belittle themselves in wrongdoing. Their dwellings become inauspicious, and none love them.\n\nHeaven and Earth abhor them; the hundred spirits detest them; even emperors and kings are grieved and afflicted by them. Such men do not become good people but instead become bandits and thieves. Even in death, they remain malevolent spirits. Though they exert force and act tyrannically, none of their efforts endure after death.\n\nThe Dao and its principles are known to all, yet they lightly dismiss doing good—how lamentable! They forsake the legacy of their ancestors, burdening their descendants. Thus, they are branded as wicked and violent men. No one is willing to speak with them; passersby avoid sharing the same path. What fault is theirs? They merely inherit the sins of their parents, yet they are still called the children of bandits and thieves, and some even meet untimely deaths.\n\nWhen the Perfected Ones come, people still take goodness lightly. They refuse to study under enlightened masters to cultivate virtue, instead following petty men—such transgressions are thus. Would not death itself be too lenient a punishment for their excess of sins?\n\nHow dreadful! There is no need for the Heavenly Master to expound further; my heart already aches with sorrow at the thought. People regard the failure to study as a trivial matter, unaware that it leads to such consequences. How foolish they are, no different from the vulgar masses. They do not reflect deeply, yet death alone cannot expiate their sins.\n\nPerfected Ones, having rendered service to Heaven and Earth, must be vigilant.\n\n\"Yes, yes. One must not take this lightly.\"\n\nI have merely outlined its essentials, revealing only the beginning—the evils of failing to study extend far beyond this.\n\nWhen you receive my writings, reflect deeply upon them. \"Yes, yes.\" If truly grasped, retreat to a quiet place and examine them thoroughly. \"Indeed, so it is.\" To study without precision is no different from dreaming. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nHaving solemnly accepted my teachings, I wish to hear of the instruction that one with strength in life should follow. \"Very well. Heaven and Earth together give life to all creatures, even the crawling ones, endowing each with strength. They draw qi from the four seasons and emulate the Five Phases. Strength, by its nature, moves and acts; one should follow its course to secure clothing and food.\n\nThus, those who consistently exert their strength, working day and night without respite, ceaselessly accumulating—whether great or small, whatever they obtain, they cherish. All things possess their own spirit and naturally incline toward those who love them; when people cherish them, they come to them. It is like the Eastern Sea, which loves water and lies lowest, so all the waters of the world gather there, making it the sea.\n\nThe noble person who exerts strength without ceasing becomes a leader in amassing wealth, and their household grows prosperous, lacking nothing. Their ancestors receive fine offerings, their descendants enjoy abundance, and the entire family benefits. By exerting strength without pause, the destitute from all directions come to receive its fruits, and their foundation grows ever greater. By giving without end, they earn great praise from the multitude, their name spreads far, and their merit is recorded in Heaven and Earth.\n\nThey should use their strength to aid the destitute and relieve the desperate, assisting Heaven and Earth in cherishing all things and aiding the ruler in nurturing the people. By ceaselessly rescuing the poor and needy, Heaven extends their lifespan, and all spirits come to partake of their offerings—no one in their household is not joyful. Through such virtue, they may attain high office, honoring their ancestors and not disappointing their descendants.\n\nYet some, though possessing strength, take it lightly and do not treat it as a matter of consequence. Though they could attain wealth, they instead engage in disputes and recklessly commit inauspicious acts. Seeing their strength overpower others, they persist in such behavior, becoming great evildoers. Their households grow impoverished, and they turn to banditry. Hunger and cold assail them, and they cannot restrain themselves from wickedness. Among them, the most unworthy perish from starvation and cold.\n\nThose who wield strength to harm others, seeking what is not theirs and seizing what does not belong to them, repeatedly injuring others—such acts incur Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s blame, and the enmity of the noble. The Emperor grows sorrowful. If they persist without cease, all spirits despise them, and blessings no longer favor them. Heaven refuses to cover them, Earth refuses to bear them; calamities arise daily. They die by the roadside or languish in prison, their parents are disgraced, misfortune befalls their wives and children, and their six relations and neighbors all wish them dead. Yet their sins remain, flowing into future generations, leaving them as beggars’ descendants or thieves’ offspring—a great stain upon posterity.\n\nPerfected One, their transgressions and punishments are thus. Would not death itself be too lenient for their excess of sins? When I hear the Heavenly Master speak of such matters, my heart trembles with shock and aches with sorrow, fearing I may never recover. Perfected One, if you understand this heartache, you will soon live rightly. But if you do not suddenly awaken fully, your death will come soon.\n\nBe vigilant. My words must not be violated; those who violate them will perish—not by my hand, but by the consequences of their own actions. Do you understand? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI have expounded these six matters, yet they are but a fraction of the whole. You who have received my Dao should ponder deeply and plan far ahead. Do not carelessly take things lightly or fail to show compassion in doing good. In cultivating strength and learning, consider whether your actions are virtuous or wicked—for the latter will only bring you low.\n\nEach must consider their own fate. Within these teachings lie six paths to death and six great virtues. Emulate the virtues, and you will surely attain goodness; take goodness lightly and act wickedly, and misfortune will come daily.\n\nYou must spur yourself on and reflect, for there is no joy in self-indulgence. Be cautious and ponder deeply. Meditate upon this, and the heart of the wise and enlightened will surely open.\n\nVirtue, benevolence, and goodness are entrusted to those of moral character, while wickedness is left to those who do not reflect deeply—this is the established pattern. If all could emulate the principles in my writings to correct themselves, the world would have no more evil people.\n\nThis is the primordial Dao of the Highest Antiquity from the Heavenly Caverns, capable of transforming people. Once they know it, all become good and do not revert to wickedness. The superior person delights in life and may study the true Dao; the profoundly wise may cultivate its virtue; the benevolent may practice its kindness; the knowledgeable may develop its wisdom; the capable may refine their abilities; and the strong may harness their strength.\n\nIf one can fully apply these teachings, reflecting upon them thoroughly, they will distance themselves from misfortune. Heaven and Earth will cherish them, the six directions will nurture them, and the Emperor will have no further concerns—thus they may govern with ease. Perfected One, do you understand? \"Great joy has come! I am overjoyed. You may indeed be called one who delights in goodness and understands it.\"\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity taught without ceasing, for they saw the clear prohibitions of Heaven and considered their own fate. Therefore, the teachings of the sages and worthies filled the world. Have you alone not realized this? \"Excellent! Excellent!\"\n\nThus, the sages, worthies, and superior persons of antiquity all studied diligently, exerting themselves day and night without pause, for they too saw the clear commands of Heaven and Earth. They dared not take things lightly or act wrongly, nor did they dare to be careless in their studies. Thus, they enjoyed long-lasting fortune and no harm. These worthies and extraordinary individuals were originally no different, but through diligent study, they attained such heights.\n\nThe wicked among them all arose from a failure to study diligently, from taking things lightly and carelessly. My Dao is the gateway to fortune and misfortune—do you understand this? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThus, I have addressed all, from the highest to the lowest. What does this mean?\n\nAlas! Why do you still not awaken?\n\nSeeing the Heavenly Master speak repeatedly, you remain confused and do not know yourself—what is awakening, and what is not awakening? Now, let me make you understand and act upon this.\n\nBefore the Perfected One, consider this: Heaven’s methods of governance transform people toward goodness, from the highest to the lowest—how many such methods are there? Though the methods are myriad and each bears a different intent, the Perfected One still upholds rectitude in this manner. The common people, however, are difficult to awaken, for their delusion has lasted long. If there is fault, it lies only with the Heavenly Master.\n\nYet in assisting the Emperor and kings in governance, there are, in general, ten methods:\n\nFirst, governance by primordial *qi*;\nsecond, governance by spontaneity;\nthird, governance by the Dao;\nfourth, governance by virtue;\nfifth, governance by benevolence;\nsixth, governance by righteousness;\nseventh, governance by ritual;\neighth, governance by culture;\nninth, governance by law;\ntenth, governance by military force.\n\nThese ten are the completion—why? All things begin with primordial *qi* and end with the military. The military involves cutting and punishment, and thus it is the lowest. Therefore, things arise in the Great Mystery, mature in the Great Yang, and die in the White Tiger. Thus, primordial *qi* resides in the north, while the White Tiger dwells in the west—this is what is meant.\n\nThus, Heaven employs governance by primordial *qi*, using the winds to nurture all things. Earth employs governance by spontaneity, so that following goodness yields goodness, and following evil yields evil. Humanity, in turn, follows the harmony of Heaven and Earth, employing governance by the Dao, taking the active Dao as its guide, so that all affairs flow and circulate.\n\nThese three methods correspond to the omens of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Beyond these three, virtue and benevolence serve as mere chapters and verses. Below benevolence, much harm is done, and intent becomes difficult to realize.\n\nThus, my Dao constantly delights in the original nature of Heaven’s precepts, while the intermediate nature of the yet-unformed Heaven is discarded. In the generation of all things, the root is the constant principle; they reach completion in the middle and descend into chaos at the end. Those who lose order and fall into chaos cannot be restored to principle. Therefore, one must begin with the highest origin.\n\nThus, Heaven constantly guards its root, Earth guards its single revolution in the middle, and humanity guards its three revolutions below—hence the reckoning of disorder in the Dao.\n\nPerfected One, have you now clearly understood this? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nShould you now harbor doubts? To follow a master is to speak without daring to doubt.\n\nPerfected One, when Heaven aids the emperor and king, by what is this made manifest? When it benefits ministers and people, by what is this proven?\n\nMaster, I now dare not ask further—my many words have missed the mark, and my errors have multiplied, so I no longer presume to speak.\n\nGo forth, then.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, when Heaven aids the emperor and king, I shall grant him wondrous scriptures, which may be employed to govern. Their application surpasses all bounds, harmonizing with yin and yang, and shall benefit lesser ministers. I shall grant him worthy officials to benefit the people, enabling them to bear virtuous children.\n\nPerfected One, is this so? Is there yet more extraordinary discourse?\n\nIt is the utmost.\n\nWhen Heaven desires to exalt a ruler of virtue, it is for the sake of bearing divine sages, that they may transmit the discourse of Heaven and Earth and comprehend their intent. Thus, Perfected One, you have come to study this.\n\nIt is fitting to entrust this to the most prudent and virtuous among the people, to awaken their hearts and prompt their reflection. Present it to a ruler of great virtue, that he may display it to the assembled worthies, ensuring all grasp its meaning and convey it to the common folk. When the common folk receive it, fifteen will follow as one, deliberating and governing together, rectifying all that is unjust—not for the sake of Heaven, Earth, or the ruler alone.\n\nYet the root of transgression lies in the long-lived among men. The long-lived, having gained authority, incur grave responsibility before the August Heaven and Earth—all borne by one person. When those who first attain the true Dao do not strive to transform and teach others; when those who first know virtue do not exert themselves to transform others; when the wealthy, amassing riches, refuse to practice benevolence with vigor; when men, though capable of learning, do not strive to seek the true Dao to attain longevity; when those capable of cultivating virtue do not strive to refine themselves; when those with strength do not labor diligently but instead invite hardship—these are the six great transgressions.\n\nHeaven and humanity have long accumulated such faults. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, each generation has inherited and compounded the burdens of the past, and those born later suffer even more. When such transgressions amass, they coalesce into great harm, causing Heaven and Earth together to lose their rectitude. The emperor’s heart is long afflicted, and governance fails. Injustice persists, and Heaven grows deeply displeased.\n\nThus, I hasten to transmit the words of Heaven. From the most ancient times to the present, when Heaven and Earth suffer affliction, their qi stagnates and does not flow. Ordinary people cannot know this—only divine sages transmit these words. It is not I alone, Perfected One; do not find this strange.\n\nNow that I am about to depart this world, I may no longer appear freely among the people. Therefore, I transmit this scripture to you, Perfected One. Having departed the mundane, you may no longer serve as a teacher among the people. Thus, I charge you to seek out the most discerning and enlightened among the people and entrust this to them. Now, hasten to deliver it to a ruler of virtue. Should you dare to delay or withhold it, you shall be held accountable—how grave this would be!\n\nToday, Heaven seeks to alleviate suffering and bring peace to the emperor and king. Let the ruler of Dao and virtue make this plain to the assembled worthies, that they may transform the people. Let each reflect on their transgressions to dissolve the inherited burdens of their forebears. Let all people consider their own well-being and not grow negligent. Then Heaven shall rejoice greatly, and governance shall be established in harmony.\n\nShould you still harbor doubts, questioning the sincerity of my words, know that my scriptures are but a test of truth. Why is this so? Ancient texts number in the millions, yet governance has never achieved true peace. Now, even the wise and enlightened may doubt, dismissing these words as untrue.\n\nWithout testing a warrior, how can one know his strength? Without applying a text, how can one know its divine power? I have received the words of Heaven to test you, Perfected One. From this point forward, when you receive any scripture, you must put it to the test—do not again indulge in empty or deceptive speech. Heaven deeply resents this; Earth profoundly suffers it, regarding it as a grave malady, a true grievance of indignation.\n\nAs a result, the myriad things do not flourish, disasters and premature deaths abound, and none complete their allotted years. The emperor is distressed, officials and people are in turmoil, and order is no longer restored. The great fault lies in these six transgressions:\n\nThose who possess the Dao envy it and do not strive to teach the foolish; those who possess virtue envy it and do not strive to transform the foolish; those who hoard wealth envy it and do not practice generosity. Heaven births all people, intending them to offer their gifts to the world. Yet those with knowledge do not strive to learn the true Dao to their own fulfillment, and when taught, they mock it. Those with ability do not strive to practice generosity, and when taught, they revile it. Those with strength do not labor diligently to enrich themselves and practice benevolence but instead grow idle and lazy. When their parents teach them, they reject it.\n\nThus, I command you, Perfected One, to swiftly bring this text to light, that the assembled worthies may each deeply reflect on the people and consider the great transgressions. Perfected One, do you now clearly understand this charge?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow that the divine person has expounded the laws of Heaven, why should it be confined to individuals alone? Should it not be disseminated among the people, ensuring proper order from above to below?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Today, the qi of Great Peace is about to descend from the highest heavens. All matters must follow its course—thus, the order from above to below. Without this order, there is only rebellious qi, and governance cannot be harmonious. Most disorders arise from disobedience to this flow.\n\nPerfected One, do you wish to add to this?\n\nI dare not. Thus, the order must be from above to below—do not ask further.\n\nYes, yes. Go forth, and take care in all matters for your own sake. These six great transgressions exist, and the Dao of Heaven is most severe—do not act recklessly. Heaven, dwelling above, watches over humanity.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI humbly request to ask one more question: when a person has attained the essential Dao and essential virtue, where should they place them?\n\nThey should present them to their ruler.\n\nWhy must they be presented to the ruler?\n\nThe essential Dao exists to bring peace to the ruler; when employed in governance, it gains the favor of Heaven. The essential virtue exists to nurture the ruler; when employed in governance, it gains the favor of Earth. Those who truly understand this yet do not present it to their superiors commit an act of disrespect—such transgressions cannot be absolved.\n\nHow weighty this is! Observing your manner of speech and conduct, one would think you utterly devoid of understanding. As a child, you are unfilial; as a subject, you are disloyal and untrustworthy—your transgressions defy description.\n\nYou, Perfected One, now ask why these matters are so grave. Why has your learning not deepened day by day, but instead grown ever more shallow? Truly, this foolish student sees nothing.\n\nYou still claim to see nothing? Common folk conceal and obscure the essential Dao and virtue, causing their ruler to suffer in sorrow and ignorance. The fault lies in the obstruction of the true Dao and virtue, which remain uncommunicated.\n\nMoreover, the essential Dao exists to align with Heaven, and the essential virtue exists to align with Earth. Fools sever these connections—Heaven detests them, Earth abhors them, and their transgressions cannot be absolved.\n\nFortunately, Perfected One, you alone have been privately granted longevity by Heaven, yet your learning remains incomplete, even transgressing Heaven’s prohibitions. Those who serve must take heed.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHere ends the scripture of Heaven’s teachings on harmonizing and enabling people to perpetually attain good fortune and distance misfortune.\n\n*Thus concludes the sixty-seventh scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n*Here begins the sixty-eighth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n\nAdmonition to the Six Disciples, One Hundred and Fourth Formula\n\nAs my departure draws near, I leave you, the Six Disciples, with this single admonition.\n\nThe Dao is all-pervading—without above or below, without exterior or interior. Guard its harmonious qi, and you shall be called a Divine Child. Seek it near, and you shall greatly attain; seek it afar, and you shall lose it.\n\nThus, the ancient kings who governed well began within the depths of their own being. Truly employing the Dao, they found governance effortless. Their movements never strayed from the measures and numbers, and the myriad things ordered themselves. Near at heart, their influence spread to fill the Four Seas. The ancients called this the Essential Dao.\n\nGovern with joy, desiring no affairs. Take heed not to lose this, for it is the plumb line that rectifies the worthy.\n\nNow I earnestly repeat this to enlighten you: though you six have asked me about the scriptures day after day, and though the Dao branches into different paths, it remains one in essence. Yet the tongue, capable of encompassing the Six Directions, completes the kingly Dao, explaining the myriad things, each with its distinct meaning. Thus, Heaven and Earth attain great peace, and the kingly ruler remains without affairs.\n\nMy writings reveal the divine mind, penetrating the Six Directions. The Eight Directions submit of their own accord, all harboring good hearts, devoid of malice. Their essential knot resides within. It is like the heart of the myriad things dwelling within, while their branches reside without. When the inner flourishes, the outer flourishes; when the inner declines, the outer declines.\n\nTherefore, the ancient August Dao Emperors and Sages, wishing to rectify the all-pervading Six Distant Directions and Eight Sides, first rectified the inner. By rectifying the inner, the outer is rectified, resonating infinitely without fail. To rectify the outer in order to rectify the inner is to err ten thousandfold.\n\nThus, the great sages of old taught people to ponder deeply and plan far ahead, closing their nine apertures, resting their four agents, and returning to a state of primordial chaos. Like a ring without end, or a child in the womb without duties, only then can one grasp the principle.\n\nMy Dao takes this as its great essential, hence I repeatedly urge each to guard their root. When Heaven generates humans, it endows them with the true Dao through the tools of creation. Thus, the teacher opens and guides them; through learning, they may become all-knowing. If the gates of their senses remain unopened, though they receive the true Dao of Heaven, they shall know nothing. It is like a newborn placed in a chamber—without guidance and learning in affairs, nothing can be known.\n\nThe differences among people arise only from the varying customs of the Eight Directions, hence their knowledge and learning differ. If one person could learn, traveling throughout the inner and outer, they would know all.\n\nAs I prepare to depart for distant places, there may yet be those to whom I can transmit, but I cannot remain seated in constant ease, guarding all my disciples. You six must carefully study my writings from beginning to end, for they form a coherent structure. If you fail to grasp my intent, examine the ancient texts to clarify it.\n\nThe one who practices the Upper Dao is known as the Mysterious Perfected; the one who practices the Lower Dao is known as the Compliant Perfected; the one who practices the Eastern Dao is known as the Initial Perfected; the one who practices the Southern Dao is known as the Grand Perfected; the one who practices the Western Dao is known as the Lesser Perfected; the one who practices the Northern Dao is known as the Secluded Perfected.\n\nThe Dao is largely the same with minor differences, thus it can distinguish yin and yang without limit, transforming into the One Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Characters. Though the harmony of the myriad things is somewhat complete, it has yet to exhaust the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, or penetrate the boundless without exterior or interior.\n\nTherefore, examine its absence, grasp its essentials, and observe its beginning, so that it may serve as a model to be recorded. Records of the past and present, though their essentials may seem disordered, are the same. What the divine and sagely record is like overlapping compasses and matching squares—though separated by billions upon billions of years, it is as if they speak face to face.\n\nThus, it may serve as the eternal canon of Heaven and Earth, as the divine Dao of yin and yang. Do not wonder at the repetition in my writings. I repeat because I fear something may be lost.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of Heaven is most strict. Having spoken, I dare not leave anything incomplete. Whether understood or not, an incomplete transmission is called a \"stumbling Dao,\" a grave transgression. I truly pity this, hence the repetition.\n\nIt is like the sages of the high antiquity, middle antiquity, and low antiquity—though born in different eras, their words follow one another, repeating and expounding, mutually verifying and clarifying. Thus, the Dao of Heaven may be fully known. This is the meaning.\n\nGo forth! I must hasten on my journey. Hold fast to the Heavenly Treasure with utmost care, and transmit it to the proper person.\n\n*Here ends the Admonition to the Six Disciples.*\n*Thus concludes the sixty-eighth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n*Here begins the sixty-ninth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n\n**Method One Hundred and Five: The Celestial Prognostications and the Cyclical Branches in Mutual Accordance**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed twice and said: \"This foolish and lowly one, by the grace of the Heavenly Master, has been treated with the tenderness due a newborn child. Such boundless kindness and love have allowed me, in haste and confusion, to be granted audience even at dawn and dusk. The works of Heaven are vast beyond gratitude.\n\nNow, I dare once more to inquire into the profound and essential, the secret Dao of Heaven—yet I hesitate to speak it all at once. Let the Way be made level. Since you, Master, have permitted this questioning from Heaven, the matter must be pursued to its end; it cannot be abandoned midway.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"This humble one has observed that the teachings of the Heavenly Master are without limit or end. Thus, all disciples, awakened by Heaven, have come to know that the Heavenly Master’s wisdom penetrates deeply, comprehending the essence of Heaven and Earth, both inner and outer, in their yin and yang. Fearing that one day we may be parted from you, Master, with no one left to resolve our doubts, we dare—boldly and without restraint—to ask about the prognostication that can bring lasting peace to the state and family, allowing the lord of men to govern with hands folded in his sleeves, free from care. He would then need only to pluck the zither and lute, make music, and wander in ease, as secure as Heaven and Earth, never again facing peril. Can such a thing be heard?\"\n\nThe various Perfected Ones—do you aspire to advance in understanding?\n\nProfound and subtle indeed is your question, seeking the charts and prognostications that penetrate and unify Heaven and Earth, a single word of which cannot be altered for ten thousand generations. Does the Lord of Heaven, grieved by the many disasters and sorrows of the world, dispatch the Perfected Ones to resolve these doubts?\n\n\"Assent.\"\n\nThen let me fully expound the great essentials of Heaven’s compass and square, the secret texts and oral instructions, so that they may be passed from mouth to mouth. The Perfected Ones shall follow and record them themselves.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow, the August Heaven takes the four seasons as its branches, while the fertile Earth takes the five phases as its body. The branches govern decline and flourishing; the body governs the compass and square. These nine spirits divide their domains, circulating throughout the world, ascending and descending without limit, their transformations difficult to perceive. They are the weighty treasures of Heaven and Earth, the gateways of all spirits. They possess an inherent constancy; one must not rashly transgress them. Those who follow them enjoy enduring fortune; those who disrupt them remain forever at odds with Heaven and Earth.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nWe wish to hear their meaning—can they truly be perceived?\n\n\"Excellent indeed are the words of the Perfected Ones. Now I shall fully expound this for you—only compose yourselves, sit calmly, and ponder my words.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe eternal celestial prognostication and pattern decree that the south is firmly established as the ruler. Thus it is said: the south is where the ruler resides; fire rules in the south; the Great Yang rules in the south; the flourishing summer of the four seasons rules in the south; the stove of the Five Domestic Altars rules in the south; the heart of the Five Viscera rules in the south. The ruler, according to the pattern, ought to wear red, for this is the phase of fire. Therefore, when the ruler encounters anomalies, they invariably correspond with yang—never with any other phase. Yang is most radiant in the sun, which governs all and stands as the eldest. Thus the celestial prognostication always takes the sun as the omen for the ruler’s prosperity or decline. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. We have come to understand it.\"\n\nThe pattern for a human ruler is ever to seek kinship with the benevolent and to govern with those who possess a heart. Those with whom one may govern together must ever practice the Dao and cherish life. Even the young and weak, or those ministers and worthy ones who are still maturing, the ruler ought to nurture—not harm. Thus the east cherishes life, while the south cherishes nurturance. Those who lack benevolence and act with intent cannot long endure, and those whose dealings are unclear cannot serve as rulers. Thus the east, being wood, embodies benevolence and heart, while the south, being fire, embodies clarity. The celestial pattern decrees that emperors and kings who govern must ever do so through the Dao and virtue. Thus the east represents the Dao, for the Dao governs generation, while the south represents virtue, for virtue governs nurturance—hence the south governs nurturance. Those who govern ought to emulate Heaven by civilizing through culture. Thus the east represents culture, for the dragon emerges bearing it, while the south represents refinement—hence rectitude becomes the pattern of culture. Refinement is great clarity, so culture arises in the east and becomes luminous in the south. Thus the celestial pattern is red, and red is fire. Benevolence and rulership move upward, and the sun ought to stand high and bright, serving as the model for humanity. Thus when wood and fire move, they invariably ascend—this is the image of the ruler. Therefore, dwelling in the east, one relies on benevolence to ascend, and thus those who govern ought to reside in the south. The east is Lesser Yang, the ruler’s beginning; thus the sun rises in the east. The south is Greater Yang, the ruler’s radiant flourishing. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family and parents, while Greater Yang is the ruler’s person and position. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family, for wood is the parent of fire, and the ruler takes Lesser Yang as their family, while fire is called the child of wood. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"You have already understood this. Lesser Yin is the minister, and ministers bend and yield in righteousness, submitting to Greater Yang. Thus metal follows fire in bending and yielding. Among people, what is desirable is that ministers always yield in righteousness to assist the ruler in what is desirable—hence Lesser Yin is called the minister. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Greater Yin is the people, who flow and do not cease, just as water flows without knowing rest. The people are charged with the duty of sustaining the state and providing for the kings and lords. Thus water ought to follow in nurturing and fostering wood. The east is the ruler’s family. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Proceed, for you have already understood this. The celestial omens decree that Lesser Yang fears Lesser Yin. Thus ministers may seize control of the state and the offices of kings and lords. Greater Yang fears Greater Yin; therefore, when a state possesses the Dao and virtue and is ruled by the worthy and enlightened, the people follow. When a state lacks the Dao and virtue, the people rebel. Thus the great essentials of governing a state are these: many people mean wealth, while few people mean great poverty. Do all the Perfected Ones comprehend this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Now you have awakened to this. The celestial patterns and laws divide into six parts. The southeast and above belong to Heaven, thus all things in growth ascend, and crawling creatures and people all emerge and dwell without, belonging to Heaven. Therefore, Heaven’s color is outwardly azure, resembling wood, and inwardly red, resembling fire. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. Now you have comprehended this.\"\n\n\"The celestial and terrestrial patterns and omens decree that the west and north below belong to Earth, thus when things reach autumn and winter, all fall and return to the soil. Crawling creatures and people, when autumn and winter arrive, all enter their burrows to dwell. Therefore, Earth’s color is outwardly yellow and white, resembling soil and metal, while inwardly it contains water, differing thus, resembling the northward movement. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"The celestial patterns and omens decree that the east and south, being noble in position, belong above to Heaven and govern as rulers, lords, teachers, and fathers. The west and north, being lowly in position, belong to Earth and serve as ministers, the inner palace, and the people. Thus, the *ji* stems from the inner palace of *jia*. *Jia* is Heaven, the fundamental position of kings. Thus, *jia* is the Heart Star; the Heart Star is fire and belongs to kings. Therefore, the east is also the precursor of kings. The Heart Star is fire and moves to belong to the south. It is like the sun rising in the east yet residing in the south. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"You have already understood this, disciple. The celestial patterns and omens decree that *bing* is the chief of fire, the most radiant of all, and thus the position of the ruler. *Xin* belongs to *bing*; *xin* is the inner palace of *bing*. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"You have already understood this, disciple. Now, *ji* is also called the Empress, and *xin* is also called the Empress—how can this be?\"\n\n\"Excellent is your inquiry, disciple, for it grasps the meaning of the celestial omens. Now, *ji* is paired with *jia*, and *shen* is the father of *bing*; thus, *ji* is the palace of the Grand Empress. *Xin* is paired with *bing*, and *bing* is the son of *jia*; thus, *xin* is the palace of the Lesser Empress. *Bing* is the rightful son of *jia*, the ordained sovereign ruler. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"You have already understood this, Perfected One. *Geng* belongs to *yi* and represents the feudal lords and kings of the state. *Ren* belongs to *ding* and represents the younger sisters of the emperor. *Gui* belongs to *wu* and represents the maternal family of the Grand Empress. Excellent, Perfected One, you have already understood this.\n\nNow that the ten celestial stems have been explained, each with its proper affiliation, we wish to hear of the twelve earthly branches—how are they to be understood?\"\n\n\"Excellent! The Dao of Heaven operates thus: though yin and yang move in succession, each has its own household in matters of governance. The Dao of Heaven is uniform, yet without households, all would simply follow one another to cessation. *Jia* takes *yin* as its household; *yi* takes *mao* as its household; *bing* takes *wu* as its household; *ding* takes *si* as its household; *wu* takes *chen* and *xu* as its household; *ji* takes *chou* and *wei* as its household; *geng* takes *shen* as its household; *xin* takes *you* as its household; *ren* takes *zi* as its household; *gui* takes *hai* as its household.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven operates in reverse to govern, while the Dao of Earth is still. Therefore, there are divided lands but no divided people—this is to have states and territories but no state in the absolute. Thus, Heaven and Earth do not shift: Heaven reverses its course day and night, circulating through one full cycle, and this is its constant way. Therefore, the twelve earthly branches each reside in their place and do not follow the ten celestial stems in their movement. Do you understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nTo practice the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons and five phases complete one another in their cycles. Though their expressions differ as they revolve, they circulate through the hidden and obscure without end—only the great divine sages of antiquity knew this in every age.\n\nTo explain it all to you would exhaust resources and prove overly elaborate, only deepening confusion and leaving the lords of earthly virtue bewildered, uncertain of what to follow. Thus, I have ceased.\n\nNot that I begrudge explaining it to you—rather, the explanations would be endless. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nYou have gained some insight. The Virtuous Lord governs according to our celestial prognostication, and not one thing in ten thousand will go amiss.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven has its fixed boundaries. The east and south are assigned to the lord and king, symbolizing Heaven, hence the title \"Son of Heaven.\" The west and north are assigned to the rear palace, subjects, and ministers, symbolizing Earth, hence Earth is called the \"rear palace.\" Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe celestial patterns of prognostication show that the east fears the west. Thus, since the opening of Heaven and Earth, when rulers have followed military methods, exalted the qi of Metal, and employed martial forces, the symbolic qi of the lord has been depleted. Fire is greatly weakened, and governance becomes inauspicious and chaotic.\n\nIf you, Perfected One, wish to know the truth of celestial prognostication, observe from high antiquity through middle antiquity to recent times: when rulers abandoned the Dao and virtue, exalted the qi of Metal, and employed military methods, their governance was entirely inauspicious, plagued by bandits, thieves, and omens of misfortune.\n\nTherefore, the sages of high antiquity deeply understood the fixed patterns of Heaven and dared not govern by means of weapons, armor, or martial forces. If emperors and kings wish for long-lasting peace and good fortune, they should follow these celestial prognostics, swiftly restrain and abolish metal weapons and military preparations, and urgently promote the Dao and supreme virtue to emulate the patterns of Heaven, align with the will of August Heaven, and forever suppress all treacherous and inauspicious elements. The response will be immediate and unmistakable. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe celestial prognostic patterns decree that though the Great Yang serves as the ruler, it paradoxically fears the Great Yin—the movement of Water. The purest and finest of waters is wine. Wine is the king of waters, its elder, the most excellent of all beverages, its qi aligned with the Kan position, governing theft and banditry by night. Thus, its name derives from \"indulgent abandon,\" for as the king and elder of waters, when Water reigns, the Great Yang wanes.\n\nPerfected One, if you wish to truly understand the veracity of celestial prognostics, observe this: from the highest antiquity through the middle ages, whenever rulers indulged in wine, none achieved great peace. Their governance turned to chaos, their officials engaged in constant strife, and bandits arose—this is the clear consequence. Therefore, when a virtuous sovereign governs in an era of Great Peace, the essence of Fire should shine brightly. One must not follow the Great Yin, allowing the power of Water to dominate and thereby suppress and harm the governance. Thus, wine must be prohibited.\n\nWould you hear of the method of prohibition? Which wine should be banned? Simply the wine sold in markets. Now, Master, what have you seen or witnessed that compels you to ban only market wine? Indeed, the market corresponds to the movement of Water. Thus, people and goods from all four directions flow and gather there. The rivers and seas, too, are the kings and elders of waters, for all streams and wealth likewise flow and converge there. Water, being the movement of the Dark Warrior of the north, is inherently greedy, plundering others' wealth. The market, where goods from the five directions flow and gather for profit, gives rise to bandits, rogues, and treacherous elements—all governed by Kan, the Water trigram.\n\nHeaven’s law operates through resonant correspondence by category. Thus, the market embodies the movement of Water. To indulge its wine is to amplify it further, once more crowning it as the king of waters. Market-dwellers, rejoicing in wine, also proclaim it king—this is a double reign of Water. The fault is sixfold: it suppresses the fiery qi of the Great Yang, causing the ruler’s governance to weaken and instead empowering treacherous ministers.\n\nHave you, Perfected One, understood this? Now, seeing the Heavenly Master’s secret instructions, you are bewildered and do not comprehend—may I hear the great secret?\n\nExcellent indeed are your words. Yet the various Perfected Ones have come from afar, inquiring of Heaven’s affairs, to resolve the harms of karmic inheritance for the virtuous lords, emperors, and kings. I shall withhold nothing.\n\nBe seated in peace, and I shall distinguish and explain all for the Perfected Ones, expounding the essential meaning.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe celestial prognostication’s secret instructions state: when gold and jade rise to prominence, affairs are governed by them. When the martial departments flourish greatly, the Wood qi is cut off at its root, and Earth gains sovereignty. When Earth is greatly exalted, it is the palace of the Grand Empress. Its qi belongs to the northwest, and when the Great Yin attains great sovereignty, it gives rise to treacherous ministers who act within the inner palace, losing their proper path and surging forth. When Earth rules, Metal becomes its minister, and together they surge upward in succession. The qi of *ji* and *xin* both attain sovereign flourishing, surging and rising greatly. According to Heaven’s standard laws, this breeds many treacheries in the inner palace—yet this is not the fault of the inner palace. Rather, it is called a failure in governance to align with celestial prognostication, a loss of the great departmental boundaries, causing disasters to return and overturn one another. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the cycles of celestial timing have not yet reached the point where the former masters could fully distinguish and explain the great departmental boundaries of Heaven. Thus, the emperor loses the governance of Heaven’s law, giving rise to these calamitous transformations.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, deeply understand this?\n\nVery well.\n\nThe celestial prognostication states: indulgence in wine belongs to the category of Water. The market is the movement of Water, the great gathering place of the human sovereign—yet to indulge in wine within the market is called \"Water and Wine as Great Sovereigns.\" When Water rules, the Fire qi diminishes; when Fire qi diminishes, it transforms into ashes; when it transforms into ashes, it changes into Earth, thus becoming Fire surrendering its qi to Earth. When Earth gains sovereignty and rises from the ground, it aligns with Metal and Water in the northwest. The Great Yin pertains to the people, yet ministers gain sovereignty instead. The inner palace gives birth to treacherous ministers, the qi of *ji* again takes action, and the inner palace commits transgressions, stirring and rising once more. The resulting disasters bring theft, and bandits never cease. All lies in the indulgence of Water, which injures the yang virtue.\n\nNow, the reason I distinguish and explain this for the Perfected One is that I see you have come to inquire with such earnest devotion, knowing that August Heaven desires to protect the virtuous lord. Therefore, I clearly expound for the Perfected One the great divisions of Heaven and Earth’s governance—what ought to be emulated, and what must no longer be transgressed. To transgress again is to invite confusion and chaos.\n\nDo you understand this?\n\nVery well.\n\nWould you permit me to raise one doubt? Proceed.\n\nNow, the capital gathers a multitude of people and wealth at its center—does this mean the capital corresponds to the Water phase?\n\nAlas! How is it that all you Perfected Ones study yet remain so often in darkness, so seldom in clarity? Not all can be grasped—how could everything be fully understood?\n\nYet know this: the capital corresponds to the central Earth, the place where Fire may securely rest. It is not like a marketplace, merely a place to amass wealth. The capital ought to gather together the Dao and virtue, benevolence and worthies, to govern the realm as one. Why then do you claim the ruler of the capital should merely amass wealth?\n\nHow profoundly foolish you are! If you doubt my words, let me explain for you. From ancient times to now, wherever capitals have gathered the virtuous and wise, the realm has known perfect order. But where only treasures and wealth are amassed, without worthy and enlightened ones, all falls into chaos contrary to the Perfected One’s intent. Can the capital be like a marketplace, merely a place to gather wealth? Is this not so?\n\nVery well.\n\nThe Perfected Ones reaffirm the celestial omens and the laws of cosmic patterning.\n\nThe sun arises from Lesser Yang and flourishes in Greater Yang. The moon arises from Lesser Yin and flourishes in Greater Yin. The sun is the essence of Heaven, the radiance of Yang—thus it is the sovereign, its position in the south. The moon is the essence of Earth, the radiance of Yin—thus it is the minister, its position in the north. The south governs day, the north governs night; therefore, when the sun reigns and acts, the moon and night wane and diminish; when the moon reigns and acts, the sun and day wane and diminish. Thus, when the qi of the north prevails, the qi of the south declines; when the qi of the south prevails, the qi of the north declines. Therefore, one must swiftly cease the reign of wine, to sever the decline of Water and Metal.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones clearly understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe cosmic patterning divides thus: Yang is Heaven, male, sovereign, father, elder, and teacher; Yin is Earth, female, minister, child, the people, and mother. Therefore, the southeast pertains to Yang, the northwest to Yin.\n\nIf the Perfected Ones wish to know the truth of celestial omens, observe this: since the opening of Heaven and Earth, whenever rulers have indulged in military force, allowed sovereigns to indulge in wine, or followed the counsel of women—when governance heavily favors their words and the sovereign yields to them—Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth, all belonging to the northwest, have prevailed. From such commands, disorder and calamity have always followed. But benevolence, wisdom, virtue, and enlightened sages all belong to the southeast, to Yang, to Heaven. From such counsel, order always follows.\n\nI wish to hear why the worthies and sages belong to the southeast.\nThe essence of Fire is the heart, and the heart is sagacity; the essence of Wood is benevolence, thus its symbol resides in the east. The southeast nurtures and fosters all things, and the worthies and sages, in their gentle clarity, likewise nurture all things without harm. Thus, the nature of sages and worthies is gentle and luminous, all benevolent and bright: benevolence resembles Wood, brightness resembles Fire—therefore, they all reside in the southeast.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the words of the Heavenly Master, I have gained great understanding.\n\nMoreover, in the laws of celestial omens, the southeast is the guiding net of Heaven’s Dipper; wherever the Dipper’s handle points, the four seasons turn, and the mandate is received in kingship. The northwest belongs to Earth, struck by the Dipper’s bowl—there, qi is cut off and extinguished. Thus, when Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth prevail and overcome Yang, it is called “reversing Heaven and Earth,” and disorder often results.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe foolish among us mortals, moved by the Heavenly Master’s compassion, have been taught the celestial omen formulas. We humbly ask to be instructed in even a single word of this matter.\n\nNow, the south is Yang, yet in reversal it corresponds to *Xun*, *Li*, and *Kun*; the north is Yin, yet in reversal it corresponds to *Qian*, *Kan*, and *Gen*.\n\nExcellent, your question! You have glimpsed the subtle intent of Heaven.\n\nYet the *Yi* (Changes) is rooted in the subtle qi of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, beginning with primordial qi. Thus, the south, being the extreme of Yang, generates Yin—hence it records Yin. The north, being the extreme of Yin, generates Yang—hence it records Yang. Subtle qi, however, cannot yet govern affairs. Therefore, in the *Yi*, the first *Nine* of *Zi* is the \"hidden dragon, do not act\"—it cannot yet govern affairs, hence it is not used. This merely marks the inception of primordial qi.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Proceed, Perfected One—you have understood.\n\nNow, what I record in the celestial omens are the great celestial divisions that govern and regulate the qi of Heaven’s administration, serving as the guiding principles for all under Heaven. Do the Perfected Ones comprehend this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhat I now speak of is precisely what the rulers of the world must follow as their method of governance. Your question concerns the inception of the correct qi.\n\nIf the Perfected Ones still harbor doubts about my words, I shall explain in full the eight boundaries of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe solar boundary is defined by the sun rising in *Mao* and setting in *You*, with the south as Yang and the north as Yin. The boundary of Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Door is defined by *Xun* arising in the southeast corner and *Qian* arising in the northwest corner, with the northeast as Yang and the southwest as Yin. The *Nine* of *Zi* and the *Six* of *Wu* mark the east as Yang and the west as Yin. The establishment of spring is at the northeast corner, and the establishment of autumn is at the northwest corner, with the southeast as Yang and the northwest as Yin. These are called the eight boundaries of Heaven and Earth, dividing and distinguishing the positions of Yin and Yang.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones now understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the understanding is achieved.\n\nTherefore, the Great Canon takes the southeast as Heaven and the northwest as Earth, with Earth yielding in compliance. Should a ruler subdue Heaven, it is because Heaven and Earth are reversed—hence, inauspicious. When Heaven fulfills its course and the ruler submits to Earth, this is compliance, each attaining its proper place—hence, auspicious.\n\nPerfected One, having received this text, ponder it deeply and entrust it to a sovereign of supreme virtue. Reflect upon my words and enact them, and you shall differ not from the divine. Then Heaven shall protect and aid you, for this is no trifling matter.\n\nProceeding, I have expounded to you the lesser completion of celestial portents and proofs. Should I now reveal to the Perfected One the greater discourse—of all between Heaven above and Earth below, the farthest reaches of the eight directions, and the constellations arrayed therein—I would speak of each in turn, circling through the subtle wonders of the celestial Dao. Yet some may grow dizzy, lost in confusion, and thereafter the true Dao would fall into disuse, leaving no means to resolve ancient calamities, thus deepening the sorrow of those above.\n\nTherefore, I have spoken only of what is easily grasped in the Great Canon, that you may awaken and no more. I do not speak of the subtle and abstruse, not out of reluctance, but for this reason.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly request to inquire of one final matter.\n\nSpeak.\n\nNow the Celestial Master expounds for this unenlightened student the ten Celestial Stems, each paired in correspondence, while the twelve Earthly Branches of the terrestrial Dao likewise share yin and yang, odd and even. Why then do only the Celestial Stems achieve such pairing?\n\nExcellent indeed is your inquiry—it may be called the essential crux of the Dao.\n\nYet Earth is but the counterpart of Heaven. Though purely yin and dwelling alone, it too possesses its own yin and yang. The laws of Heaven and Earth correspond above and below: Heaven has *zi*, and Earth has *zi*; Heaven has *wu*, and Earth has *wu*; Heaven has *kan*, and Earth has *kan*; Heaven has *li*, and Earth has *li*—thus do they align in mutual resonance.\n\nTherefore, *chou* and *wei* are the rear palaces of *yin*. *Shen* belongs to *mao*, the son-in-law of the feudal lords and kings. *Hai* pairs with *chen*, while *mao* pairs with *xu*. *Chen* and *xu* are the consorts of the Grand Empress Dowager’s household. *You* belongs to *wu*, the Lesser Empress. *Zi* belongs to *si*, and *si* is the son-in-law of the Emperor’s younger sister.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus the Stems are the Emperors and Kings, and the Branches are also the Emperors and Kings. Therefore, *yin* is the Branch of *jia*, so *chou* and *wei* are called the rear palaces. *Wu* is the Branch of *bing*, so *you* is called the Lesser Empress. *Mao* is the Branch of *yi*, so *shen* is called the son-in-law of the feudal lords and kings. *Chen* is the Branch of *wu*, so it is called the household of the Grand Empress Dowager. *Hai* is the Branch of *gui*, so it is called the consort of the Grand Empress Dowager’s household. *Zi* is the Branch of *ren*, so it is called the son-in-law of the Emperor’s younger sister. *Si* is the Branch of *ding*, so it is called the Emperor’s younger sister. Such is the law of Heaven and Earth in harmonious resonance.\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\nI wish to inquire further regarding these *chen* and *xu* lords: when unmarried, the men gather together, and the women marry together—why is this?\n\nMost subtle indeed is your inquiry.\n\nNow, Heaven is the utmost yang, and Earth is the utmost yin. Earth is multitudinous, the chief of all yin. Yin is ever even in number, thus they pair. Yet *wu* and *ji* both belong to Earth—why do they not pair?\n\nExcellent question. *Wu* and *ji* are the fifth Stems, the yang of Earth, their position belonging to Heaven—thus they do not pair.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, you have grasped it. Now your questioning of this is most apt.\n\nThe Five Phases’ names cycle and complement one another, encompassing all matters under Heaven. When you receive my writings, you must reflect upon their categories and ponder their deeper intent. From the six directions above and below to the farthest depths, all is already complete. Thus the sage, seeing one, knows ten thousand things; the great worthy, seeing one, knows a thousand; while the foolish, though straining to comprehend, remain confused and fail to attain the true Dao.\n\nTherefore the Dao and its virtue are entrusted to the Perfected One—do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, you have understood. I now wish to ask one further matter.\n\nNow, the four seasons of Heaven above and the Five Phases of Earth below—all are said to correspond to the households of emperors, kings, feudal lords, and palace consorts. Heaven’s Dao exhaustively assigns these pairings. But do the myriad common folk and all things also have their own correspondences?\n\nExcellent is your question—you have glimpsed the essentials of the great Dao.\n\nIn truth, these pairings are all of the same nature.\n\nThe Five Phases: at their apex are the emperors and kings; next are the ministers; then the subtle qi. The king occupies the position of emperor; the minister, the position of great official; the subtle qi, the position of petty officer. After the king comes the aged qi—this is the position of feudal lords. After the aged qi comes the declining qi—this is the position of the imperial clan. After the declining qi comes the ailing qi—this is the sign of the imperial clan’s transgressions and loss of succession. After the ailing qi comes the imprisoned qi—this is the sign of the common folk and the myriad people. After the imprisoned qi comes the dead qi—this is the sign of slaves and servants. After the dead qi comes the vanished qi—this is the sign of the dead in their tombs.\n\nThus Heaven displays its signs: the four seasons and Five Phases circulate in ceaseless flow, each rising and declining in turn. The people and the myriad things all follow the law of Heaven’s signs, likewise rising and declining.\n\nTherefore the myriad common folk are all descendants of the hundred kings. In ascent, they become rulers of men; in decline, they become the people.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. You have now grasped it.\n\nTo the right, these celestial portents govern the state of Chang’an, suppressing inauspicious ministers and eradicating treacherous deceit.\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Sixty-Nine of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll Seventy of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Chapter One Hundred and Six: The Knack of Gains and Losses in Learning*\n\nThe Perfected One respectfully inquired: I now wish to compile and rectify all the texts you have written before, so that scholars may not speak recklessly. May I hear of this?\n\nExcellent! How your mastery grows day by day.\n\nIndeed, my Way and its methods emerge to regulate the yang and enter to regulate the yin; emerge to regulate conduct and enter to regulate the spirit; emerge to regulate the multitude of texts and enter to regulate the multitude of diagrams; emerge to dispel disasters and enter to rectify the self; emerge to regulate the learning of the court and internally regulate the chamber of seclusion.\n\nIn all matters, set limits. Those who strive diligently in learning, each according to their capacity, yet deviate from the constant method—externally, their learning leads them into superficiality, unable to restrain themselves; internally, their learning fails to align with the proper path, turning instead toward great deviation.\n\nScholars invariably suffer from a grave flaw: they cannot recognize it themselves.\n\nThose who favor external learning and whose talent exceeds the norm often fall into superficiality, causing the Way to become greatly deviant. Lacking proper texts, they falsely claim it as the true Way and deceive others with their requests.\n\nThose who favor internal learning and whose talent exceeds the norm often plunge into great deviation, believing they have attained it. Refusing to speak with others, they lose the proper measure and transmit reckless words.\n\nNow you harbor doubts, so you have come to ask again. Your intent is earnest and unwavering, free from carelessness. I shall establish rules and limits for you, so each may have boundaries to observe.\n\nAncient and modern texts are too numerous to count. In all learning, those who delight in truth must not deviate from the root.\n\nThose who learn from a master’s oral instructions must not deviate from the master’s words—this is the great essential.\n\nThe greatest harm in learning lies here: when external studies align with superficial chapters and phrases, they become shallow and lead to reckless speech.\n\nWhen internal texts align with apocryphal diagrams, one cannot deeply grasp their essential meaning and instead speaks in error.\n\nThose who study longevity yet emerge to align with superficiality deceive others.\n\nThose who align internally yet fail to grasp the essential meaning fall into great deviation.\n\nNow you return to ask repeatedly, so I shall expound these texts for you, revealing their limits. What aligns with the proper measure is correct; what does not is wrong. This is clear.\n\nFrom this, you may understand: all scriptures are the discourse of Heaven. When ten correspond with ten, it is correct. When ten correspond with nine, it is a minor deviation. When ten correspond with eight, it is a minor disorder. Beyond this, it is not the true Way and cannot be used. It is called \"disordering the celestial patterns and earthly principles,\" displeasing yin and yang, causing the myriad things to struggle and the people to suffer great misfortune.\n\nThe method of nurturing one’s nature is to internally perceive one’s form and countenance clearly—this is correct. To externally perceive the spirits of the myriad things is wrong.\n\nIn learning all matters, one must constantly uphold the root text and seek the multitude of worthies to explain and settle it—this is correct. To cling to the multitude of chapters and phrases while forgetting the root is wrong, losing the intent of the Way of Heaven.\n\nTo transform one’s body into a spirit is correct. To lack the Way yet fail to become a spirit, yet claim to command spirits, is wrong—it is merely a technique of driving others through texts.\n\nTo explain all matters such that root, branch, and center resemble one another is correct. What does not resemble is wrong.\n\nTo enter seclusion and initially eat little, gradually consuming qi until it dissolves and disappears—this is correct. To seek the Way, claim attainment, and not return, yet answer questions, is wrong.\n\nAll who depart must return. Those who teach and answer questions are correct. Those who do not teach or answer, yet tolerate death, are wrong.\n\nTo maintain purity and stillness in a secluded chamber and succeed is correct. To claim attainment of the Way yet speak in anger is wrong—such a one has lost their essence.\n\nTo enter learning and daily improve, surpassing one’s former state, is the correctness of attaining the Way. To enter learning yet daily worsen, lacking loyalty and trust, is wrong—one has fallen into great deviation.\n\nTo read texts and grasp their meaning, then uphold the master’s instructions to seek explanations, is correct. To read texts without a master’s instructions, yet claim deep and solitary understanding, is wrong—one has lost the great intent of the Way.\n\nTo have attained the Way yet steadfastly serve the multitude of masters and worthies without slackening is correct—this is the path of daily progress.\n\nThus the ancient sages, having attained the Way, naturally served their masters without ceasing. After leaving their masters, they read the texts without slackening. To learn yet claim solitary attainment of the essential meaning, no longer diligently reading the ancient texts and sagely words, and claim not to serve the multitude of sages—this is wrong. Such a one is a fool.\n\nIn all learning, to exhaustively investigate what may be sought is correct. All things are thus: once born, to fulfill their lifespan and bear fruit is correct. To merely be born yet fail to fulfill their lifespan, lacking trustworthiness, is wrong.\n\nTo do good and attain its proper fruit is correct. To fail to attain its proper fruit, appearing correct externally yet wrong internally, is wrong.\n\nTo thoroughly study my texts without departing from the guiding line and attain their truth is correct. To read texts and display cleverness, possessing great talent yet failing to grasp their essential truth, is wrong.\n\nHeaven has wind and rain, and the myriad things are born in season—this is correct. When wind and rain harm the myriad things, it is wrong—it is poisonous.\n\nFor the scriptural Way to daily flourish is correct. To not daily progress but instead daily decline is wrong—one has lost the internal intent.\n\nThus the nature of Heaven and Earth is to do good. If it does not immediately manifest in one’s person, it flows to later generations to illuminate one’s conduct.\n\nTo do evil also does not immediately cease in one’s person but must flow to later generations, likewise revealing one’s conduct through error.\n\nTherefore, the good and evil one does will inevitably be seen.\n\nBut those who do good are like facing the rising sun—bright as the break of dawn. Those who do evil are like facing the setting sun—dark as the gathering dusk. Such is the natural nature of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.\n\nHeaven gives life to the myriad things, each manifesting according to its conduct, revealed without concealment. Thus, the good ascend in their deeds, their fate belonging to Heaven, just as the living belong to Heaven. The evil descend in their deeds, their fate belonging to Earth, just as the dead—being impure—return below to the Yellow Springs. This is what is meant.\n\nThose who obtain my scripture must entrust it to a ruler of supreme virtue. I possess this scripture and dare not obstruct or withhold its transmission and study.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven governs Heaven, yet it cannot be fully known; one must not heed the words of a single person alone. Therefore, I have now established the writings of the ancient sages for you, once more distilling their essential concordance. The scripture’s beginning and end mutually confirm one another, serving as proof.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, though the worthy and sagely have lived in different ages, separated by vast spans of time, what they detested was the same. Together they spoke for Heaven, remedying the world’s gains and losses. Their words resemble one another like overlapping compasses or aligned squares—turning to mutually illuminate, unavoidably so.\n\nFor things of the same kind gather and arise together; their principles all summon one another through likeness and resemblance. This is clear evidence. What was lost in the past is regained in the future, and by examining similarities and differences, the text is completed.\n\nAdhering to antiquity to clarify the present, discussing matters collectively to compose the inner text, and using the outer text to elucidate the inner—then returning to verify the inner text through the outer—ensures it may be transmitted for ten thousand generations without compounding Heaven’s transgressions.\n\nThe words of one person cannot be followed alone. The words of many, deeply weighed and drawn from the sayings of ancient worthies and sages, inwardly align with Heaven. Together they are settled and established.\n\nIf the emperor daily clarifies the decisive principles, all confusion, disorder, disasters, and evils will be eliminated. Heaven will have no repeated sorrows; those who work together will prosper, while those who resist will find their misfortunes unremoved.\n\nHere ends the decisive teachings on the scholar’s gains and losses.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Seventy Concludes\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Seventy-One Begins\n*True Dao: Nine Essentials on Gains and Losses*, First Section of the One Hundred Seventh Text\n\nThe Perfected One bows twice and asks to inquire of one matter. Pray, speak.\n\nHere the Celestial Master bestows the qi of Great Peace to transmit the Dao and its virtue, thereby establishing the supreme emperor. Above, there is a ruler who delights in the Dao and virtue; below, even the foolish and lowly common folk are reached. Its grace pervades the six directions, harmonizes the eight extremities, and encompasses all without exception.\n\nNow, worthy disciple, you have received the Master’s literary teachings and pondered them to attain the Dao. What marks its ultimate height above, and what defines its utmost depth below?\n\nExcellent indeed is the Perfected One’s question—how subtle and essential! Do you wish to hear of its profoundest extremes and know the spirits’ advance and retreat?\n\nTruly, I am dull and benighted; my understanding falls short. Only the enlightened Master may record and reveal it.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe Dao has nine degrees, each distinguished by its own name. Now I shall fully expound their meaning for the Perfected One. Follow along and record it, ensuring nothing is lost.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nFirst is the Primal Qi of Non-Action. Second is Serene Emptiness and Nothingness. Third is Numerical Measurement and Distinction. Fourth is the Spirit’s Journey Forth and Return. Fifth is the Great Dao’s Spirit, akin to the Four Seasons and Five Phases. Sixth is Piercing Joy. Seventh is Community Counsel. Eighth is Overflowing Spirit. Ninth is Ancestral Spirits.\n\nEach of these nine is further divided into nine, yielding eighty-one sections, each with distinct principles and secret applications. Together, they form one great root, with spirit as its agent and humanity as its gateway.\n\nNow I shall arrange them for you in ordered teachings. It is impossible to record them all in advance. Reflect upon their meaning: the upper three nines—twenty-seven in total—can transcend the world. The central three nines—another twenty-seven—can summon true spirit officials. The lower three nines—twenty-seven more—abound in heterodoxy. Their spirits and essences cannot be constantly employed, causing people to become confused and disoriented. Among them, those of impure essence often err and speak falsely, as if losing their qi.\n\nNow, this humble student, upon hearing the Master’s words, is dazzled and knows not east from west. I pray you distinguish and explain it for this dull disciple.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe first, the Primal Qi of Non-Action, is to contemplate one’s body without acting in the slightest. Simply envision it as radiantly pure, like qi released without form. Constantly take this as your method. Once perfected, there is nothing you cannot do and nothing you do not know. Thus, when one lacks the Dao, they remain merely human. With the Dao attained, they transform into divine immortals, their spirits ascending to Heaven, following its transformations—this is what it means to be capable of all things.\n\nThe second, Natural Emptiness and Nothingness, is to guard the form in profound emptiness, naturally without flaw. The body’s interior shines white, above and below like jade, without blemish. Practiced over time, this too is a method to transcend the world. It follows the image of the Primal Qi of Non-Action.\n\nThe third, Numerical Measurement, is to accumulate essence and observe oneself. Count from the hair on the head to the feet, distinguishing each of the five fingers. The body’s external and internal aspects are all enumerated without omission. Know its meaning and constantly hold this in mind. Not losing even a fraction, this is also a lesser method to transcend the world. It follows Serene Emptiness.\n\nThe fourth, the Spirit’s Journey Forth, is to contemplate the spirits of the five viscera, all emerging and entering, visible in their movements. You may speak with them. The mind follows the spirit’s comings and goings, perceiving the body’s interior with clarity. This enables knowledge of fortune and misfortune, following Numerical Measurement.\n\nThe fifth, the Great Dao’s Spirit, is when the human spirit emerges and aligns with the Five Phases and Four Seasons—green, red, white, yellow, black—all harmonizing with the visceral spirits. Their comings and goings are directed by the spirit officials of the Four Seasons and Five Phases, called the Complete Dao. It can subdue all heterodoxies.\n\nThe sixth, Piercing Joy, involves piercing and binding the earthly spirits of the Dao, each with its own canon. Following their household methods, spirits are summoned to wander. Half resemble the true, half the heterodox, often enticing people with cleverness. They cannot be constantly employed, for over time they bring sorrow.\n\nThe seventh, Community Counsel, involves the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the Four Seasons, altars of soil and grain, mountains and rivers—sacrificial spirits who descend to humans. They cause confusion, prompting reckless speech about spirits, violent enmity, and wild heterodoxy. One must not act recklessly.\n\nThe eighth, Overflowing Spirit, speaks of spirits that overflow, their Dao unattached to any system. They are the refined qi of the world descending upon people, causing reckless speech. Half resemble the true, half the heterodox.\n\nThe ninth, Ancestral Spirits, involves purely seeing ghosts, without any true Dao. Those who summon them attract only the ghosts of the dead. This is the lowest extreme of the Dao, called the path of the inferior scholar.\n\nOne who attains the upper Dao can also employ the lower. One who attains the lower Dao cannot employ the upper.\n\nNow, I wish to know: why are there these distinctions of upper and lower?\n\nThis arises from human conduct. Those who guard the root attain the upper. Those who delight in the spirit’s exit and entry into the body attain the middle. Foolish people harm the root and guard the branches, wandering with other spirits to attain the lower.\n\nThose who guard the root can fully perceive it. Those who guard the middle perceive half. Those who guard the branches cannot return to see the Dao’s mirror.\n\nThus, all learners must find an enlightened master. Without one, they lose the path. Therefore, the transmission from master to master is as enduring as metal and stone. Without such transmission, it is called reckless practice, leading to misfortune and heterodoxy.\n\nPerfected One, be cautious, be cautious.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the highest learners among sages and worthies, having found enlightened masters, were called reborn. Those without enlightened masters were called disruptors of the scriptures. Therefore, all worthies and sages served masters to achieve completion. Without a master, the Dao does not arise spontaneously.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nPerfected One, if you wish to know its effect, consider this: dwelling in a village of great worthies makes one greatly worthy. Dwelling in a village of middling worthies makes one middling worthy. Dwelling in a village of the unworthy makes one unworthy. This is what it means to never surpass such influence.\n\nThose who study this Dao must examine it carefully and in detail. This is the essential Dao of Heaven.\n\nBe cautious, be most cautious.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWhen one departs, the Dao returns to its rightful recipient, to be entrusted to the worthy and enlightened.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThis is the divine secret and essential Dao.\n\n*(Right: The Nine Principles of the True Dao on Gains and Losses.)*\n\n**Text 108: The Text on Inducing Goodness, Eliminating Evil, and Receiving the Dao’s Precepts**\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: \"What are the precepts for receiving the Dao?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"The Dao has great precepts—one must not fail to be cautious. When one is about to attain the Dao, at the moment of near-completion, one will commune with all spirits, dwell as neighbors with the spiritual and the numinous, and meet them in all goings and comings. One will love others as a father loves his child.\n\nThe Dao is a weighty matter. Some may regret bestowing it upon others and seek to wrest it away. Thus, they first test a person to see if they are steadfast. They may come together to deceive, causing one to speak recklessly. If one obtains their words and firmly seals them, taking care never to transmit them, one may attain longevity. With time, one may attain the true Dao. To transmit them is to invite gradual decay. Moreover, it causes one to cherish life and abhor harm.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"I wish to hear the meaning of 'gradual decay.'\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"When the spirit decays, the body dies. The Dao of emptiness and absolute profundity constantly urges one to cherish life and abhor killing, to seal the mouth and prevent leakage—only then can one endure for ten thousand myriad years.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: \"I wish to hear the prohibitions against leakage.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Thus, if a great person leaks it, they lose their position. If a middling person leaks it, their qi is severed. If a petty person leaks it, their lineage is extinguished. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth use this to distinguish themselves and maintain their exclusivity, and thus the divine holds it in the utmost reverence. If Heaven and Earth did not profoundly know the Dao of absolute profundity, how could they be divine? How could they be eternal?\n\nRemember this: treasure its essence, value it, and be cautious.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and dared not speak recklessly.\n\nThe Perfected One bowed and asked: \"When they seek to corrupt a person, what is to be done?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"When evil intent arises in a person’s heart, great malevolence comes to deceive. If one can firmly seal their ears and refuse to heed their words, it is auspicious. To listen to their words is to invite misfortune and harm.\n\nIf a ruler listens, they will despise their ministers, accusing them of disloyalty and plotting rebellion. If a minister or child listens, they will despise their ruler or father, and the deceiver will approach, saying, 'You shall soon become a sage' or 'You shall soon become a ruler.' If a petty person listens, they will be made to boast of their own greatness. If a father listens, they will despise their child; if a child listens, they will despise their father. Their words shift and twist, confusing the heart and mind, speaking now of good, now of evil, disrupting governance. With one moment of joy and the next of anger, this is the great flattery of malevolence, ever seeking to harm others.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, all who have studied long life have failed to transcend these words.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"What is to be done?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Seal your ears and do not listen; seal your mouth and do not speak. These are but flatteries of malevolence—there is nothing worth hearing. To listen is to lose the true Dao, and to lose it is to die. If you wish to endure, be cautious of these words.\n\nI have already warned you of this, for how often have you nearly fallen prey to this great malevolence? I constantly rectify my own heart and no longer employ such things. This great malevolence constantly accumulates, seeking to observe whether a person is steadfast. The cunning and malevolent may even enter a person’s belly, stirring their heart and causing them to act recklessly. They provoke joy and anger, making it impossible to restrain oneself—all are led astray by malevolence. Driven by malevolence, the many are swept away to destruction.\n\nIn such matters, the accumulated cases are many. One must carefully observe these weighty precepts, and the heart must not be swayed—not only for those who study the Dao. The common people, too, are subject to unpredictable joy and anger; the same applies to you. Be cautious and refine yourself.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"I myself have been afflicted by great malevolence, which made me wish to boast, saying, 'I shall become a ruler, and later ascend as an immortal to the heavens.' I believed their words and rejoiced greatly. Later, I fell ill for three months with madness, but when I saw the Divine Person and Heavenly Master, my heart filled with joy. I have personally experienced this affliction and nearly succumbed to severe illness. Later, the madness ceased, and I recovered, attaining several thousand years of life. Now, I am fortunate to meet the Divine Person again, to receive the Dao’s precepts anew, and to see the gateway, hoping to endure long and become an official of the heavens.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"If you hold your heart and will so steadfastly, why fear you will not ascend to the Nine Heavens and traverse the Twenty-Five Heavens? All those who ascend to the heavens now have held their hearts firm and unyielding—none may err.\n\nAll who are misled by confusion and deception die prematurely and fail to transcend. If you wish for long life, study this text and take it as a weighty precept. This is the precept of life and death—one must not fail to be cautious.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of ancient times who first transcended the world did not rely on this power. Those who study the Dao yet fail to transcend and do not endure long do so because they listened to this and were ensnared by its harm. The great spirits of the heavens do not permit harm to be done to others; they cause such harm to rebound upon the perpetrator, leaving them without great fortune. Those who were to live are turned to death, becoming thieves of Heaven.\n\nNow, all that I have taught and shown to you, Perfected One, may lead to great longevity. Some may transcend the world, but you must carefully guard yourself and not allow this to become harm. If you can focus your heart single-mindedly, you may endure for ten thousand myriad years.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes. I dare not act wrongly; I beg to receive the enlightened precepts.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Your devotion to the Dao is such that you shall accomplish the task and ascend the steps to Heaven.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"Are these the only precepts against malevolence? Are there deeper ones? Are there precepts of the heavens above?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"There are indeed the unyielding precepts of Heaven, which firmly admonish people’s ears. The primary precept is against colluding with others to deceive, telling them they shall soon be exalted and noble—this is how one is admonished.\"\n\nThus do men transgress the prohibitions and incur execution. Again, they are repeatedly tested with jade maidens, made to wander in their company; those who succumb laugh at others’ baseness, only to bring harm upon their own bodies in return. Yet if one remains ever silent, for ten thousand years there is nothing to hear—only guarding one’s own life to its end, what harm could there be? Between life and death, this alone is paramount.\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"Why does the Dao specifically send evil spirits to test men?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"The Dao is weighty and difficult to bestow upon men. Those who grasp it must hold fast, even unto death; thus, none may wrest a man’s aspiration from him. The transcendent scholars of Heaven do not covet honor or nobility. They delight only in life itself—there is no extraordinary path. Remember my precepts, and you shall recite them ceaselessly; my words must never be forgotten for ten thousand generations. Even if one ascends to the boundless heavens of utmost purity, the precepts remain thus—there is nothing extraordinary beyond them.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and dared not stray from the guiding line.\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"If you are truly as you say, you have already attained the Dao. The auspicious shall advance daily, while the wicked shall cease their ascent. Holding the heart thus, you fulfill the divine precepts. Having accomplished this, you shall ride clouds and mount dragons, roaming the eight directions. The great Dao lies open before you; your life shall be long and boundless.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Divine Person continued: \"The Dao is truly vast, without inner or outer bounds. Yet one must ever fear being harmed by great evil, for if one does not heed even a single wickedness, how could evil ever prevail? Thus, the ancient emperors and kings who loved the Dao and studied it, refusing to listen to evil, all attained lives of ten thousand myriad years. Those who heeded and employed wicked words all brought ruin upon themselves. My Dao encompasses myriad facets—you must know their benefits and harms.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Now that you have received the words of the Divine Person, may you attain long life in an instant?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Without deep precepts, even accomplished deeds may turn inauspicious, and the Dao will not be fulfilled.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Is my life fated by destiny, or is it mere fortune that I have encountered the Divine Person?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Such is the nature of the Six Kinds of Men. Each has their own destiny: first, the Divine Person; second, the Perfected Person; third, the Immortal; fourth, the Daoist; fifth, the Sage; sixth, the Worthy. All assist Heaven in governance. The Divine Person presides over Heaven, the Perfected Person over Earth, the Immortal over wind and rain, the Daoist over teaching and the auspices of good and ill, the Sage over governing the people, and the Worthy assists the Sage in ordering the records of the myriad folk, supplying what is lacking in the Six Directions. Thus, men are born with their own destinies—those fated for nobility cannot be base, and those fated for baseness cannot be noble. Do you wish to know the truth of this? Consider the fish, which though it dwells in water, cannot soar without the water’s qi; the dragon, however, rides the water’s qi to ascend the azure clouds and become Heaven’s messenger. Nobility and baseness are truly matters of destiny—fools who speak recklessly do so in vain. The ancient sage-kings, in their great wisdom, did not record or heed false words, knowing them to be impossible. This is like teaching a man without the Dao to suddenly fly—how could he take flight? Only those who have attained the Dao and become immortals can truly fly. When the common folk play and boast, 'I can fly,' yet cannot, they speak falsehoods like this.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Excellent! I have awakened to this truth.\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Are you still so foolish as to think that Heaven’s mandate can be forcibly obtained?\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Can this Dao also be learned?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Only those with Heaven’s mandate may learn it and surely attain great transcendence. Those of middling worth who study it may also attain long life, while the foolish who pursue it may gain a lesser span. Do you wish to see its effects? It is like the common man who studies: the greatly worthy may become high officials, those of middling worth may become middling officials, and the foolish may become petty clerks. Are not petty clerks still set above the common folk? Thus, one should strive to study.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes. I shall practice this without ever daring to slacken.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Then exert yourself and trust in the Dao. Between Heaven and Earth, each takes what is fitting—there is no falsehood in this.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and pledged to honor Heaven and revere Earth, respect superiors and cherish inferiors, follow the four seasons and the five phases, and never dare to act wrongly.\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Excellent, excellent! You have grasped the meaning of the Dao. I need not instruct you further.\"\n\n*Here ends the text on inducing goodness, expelling evil, and causing men to receive the precepts of the Dao.*\n\n**End of Scroll Seventy-One of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n**Beginning of Scroll Seventy-Two of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n\nThe Rites of Fasting, Abstinence, and Meditation on the Divine to Rescue from Death, Method One Hundred and Nine\n\nThe Perfected Writings of the Six Directions prostrated again and inquired: \"Previously, we received the Celestial Master’s teaching that the qi of Great Peace is about to descend, and that the harmonization of yin and yang depends first upon harmonizing with the divine spirits, each returning to their proper place. Reflecting deeply upon the Celestial Master’s words, we find that those who can reverse illumination and penetrate with radiance see all things clearly, one by one. Yet such persons are exceedingly numerous—how can this be achieved? Can those Daoist masters who possess the reversed light of penetrating emptiness gather them together?\"\n\nThe Celestial Master sighed, \"Excellent, excellent! The imperial qi of Heaven is soon to arrive, and the sovereign shall govern with folded arms, free from care. Thus, Heaven has sent the various Perfected Ones to come and inquire thoroughly into the essentials of the supreme Dao, so that a sovereign of great virtue and luminous governance may arise, wholly eradicating the lingering disasters and inherited burdens of former kings, as well as the malevolent qi, demonic entities, treacherous spirits, and baleful influences that bring harm between Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nThe Perfected Ones came, each asking in turn about these essentials of the supreme Dao. \"Do your disciples also not know these things for themselves?\" The Perfected Ones replied, \"Suddenly, we do not know.\" \"If you do not know now, why do you ask?\" They answered, \"We have reflected upon the Celestial Master’s teachings and found some points unresolved. Since we do not know, by what means can we gather those who possess the most profound, tranquil, reversed light of emptiness—those who can perceive the malevolent? We find this strange, and so we have come together to ask.\"\n\n\"Excellent! The Perfected Ones’ dedication has advanced, and now you question this. Heaven has sent you to inquire fully on behalf of the virtuous sovereign, that these malevolent influences may be resolved.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"Now, I shall explain fully to the Perfected Ones, distinguishing and clarifying the essential meanings of the Dao. Sit at ease and record them together.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe heavens and earth possess their own divine treasures, each endowed with numinous essence and radiance. These follow the Five Phases in color and wax and wane with the qi of the four seasons, serving as heaven and earth’s envoys to bring forth the myriad people and creatures. Within the interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, none escape their transformative virtue and generation.\n\nThose who grasp their intent may witness them at once; those who fail to comprehend their essential meaning find no gateway to knowledge. Those who can broadly open and apply them achieve great fortune, able to dispel the afflictions, sufferings, malevolence, and evils that plague people between heaven and earth. Those who do not know the great method cannot recklessly summon or employ these spirits in vain.\n\nWe wish to hear their intent, that it may be transmitted for ten thousand generations without error.\n\nExcellent is your question. To await and obtain this art, there exists a great method: the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases enters the human abdomen, becoming the spirit of the five viscera. Their colors correspond to the colors of heaven, earth, and the four seasons. When depicted as a person, let the three be harmonized—with the ruling qi’s color covering the exterior, the ministerial qi’s color next, and the subtle qi residing innermost—so that their garments and hems reveal them.\n\nFirst, fast and reside in quietude, in a serene place. Reflect upon and contemplate them, then create their painted images, their length unrestricted. For the five, depict them together upon five feet of plain silk. Let them be well-crafted: men should envision men, women envision women. Such is the method of painting their images. These writings are already numerous, not confined to a single version. From top to bottom, discuss their textual meaning and proceed accordingly, using written words to subtly clarify.\n\nThough my writings are many, they possess a grand division: texts are grouped by category, and characters elucidate one another, so that their essential meaning is fully attained.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThis spirit of the four seasons and Five Phases enters to become the spirit of the five viscera and emerges to become the numinous essence of the four seasons and Five Phases. Those closest to humans are called the spirits of the Five Powers, resembling the spirits of the viscera. Those more distant are called the Solar Calendar, styled as the Four Seasons’ Troops and Horses, capable of repelling malevolence. They too act in accord with the waxing and waning qi of the four seasons.\n\nFor their method, prepare their painted images: let the person be clad in three layers of robes, with the ruling qi’s color on the outside, the ministerial qi’s next, and the subtle qi innermost. All wear caps and ride horses, the horses also arrayed in the colors of the Five Phases. First, paint the images on one side: two zhang in length, loosely depicting twenty-five riders upon five silks. Craft them well.\n\nThe riders of the east hold spears; those of the south, halberds; those of the west, bows, crossbows, and axes; those of the north, bucklers and sabers; and those of the center, swords and drums. In contemplation, one should first perceive the inner spirits, then the outer spirits. Or one may first see the yang spirits before the inner spirits. To perceive them thus is the method of formless images. One must also receive oral instructions from a master, for there is a crucial point at the outset. Those who know it find it easy to transmit and achieve; it is fitting to keep it distant from others and practice in seclusion. If it is easily gathered near people, it will surely be difficult to accomplish.\n\nWhen this Dao is accomplished, it is called \"illumination.\" Those of the utmost reversal and profound emptiness gather it. The forms of illness are not many; many is auspicious, few is inauspicious. If some remain untreated, unresolved, or uncured, how many must one obtain to suffice?\n\nThe highest obtain ten thousand, the middling four or five thousand, the lowest several hundred, or merely dozens. Why so many?\n\nAh, have the Perfected Ones reverted to their former ignorance? Be seated, and I shall now explain the essential meaning to you.\n\nAfter the present era of bearing and shouldering [karmic burdens], heaven and earth suffer abundant calamities. Ghosts, old spirits, and baleful misfortunes—corpse-related omens are not singular. There are also wind-damp sores, scabies, and the manifold disasters of this degenerate age, too numerous to name. One person may have a hundred illnesses, or dozens. Suppose each person could be long or short-lived, or each could dispel one illness. Like a diviner skilled in the arts of milfoil and turtle-shell, removing one baleful affliction; or a great physician skilled in medicinal formulas, dispelling one illness; or an acupuncturist skilled in needling the channels, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in moxibustion, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in exorcism, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in sacrifices, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in commanding spirits to guide and inspect ghosts, dispelling one illness—these seven people each remove one illness, thus dispelling seven illnesses.\n\nIn this degenerate age, people suffer many illnesses; some have a dozen, while others claim to have a hundred, all afflicted with every kind of suffering. Though all skilled artisans each remove one illness—thus dispelling seven—the remaining illnesses persist, not fully eradicated. The strength of the seven artisans is exhausted, yet these remaining illnesses continue to torment people. Over time, they become impoverished, and many die, unable to extricate themselves from their plight.\n\nHow long is a person’s allotted lifespan? How many illnesses do they witness? They encounter hardships, prosperity and decline, advance and retreat. Heaven’s standard is like the four seasons and Five Phases, which have their waxing and waning. The eight trigrams Qian and Kun are the bodies of heaven and earth, yet they too have times of rest, imprisonment, desolation, and diminished qi. How much more so for humans?\n\nHumans emulate heaven and earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the six conjunctions, and the eight directions, ever waxing and waning without cease. Thus, one must prepare in advance, rescuing the sources of fortune and misfortune. In peace, do not forget peril; in existence, do not forget annihilation; in order, do not forget chaos. Only then can one endure long.\n\nTherefore, in the method of treating malevolence, the Daoist does not suffer many illnesses. If one person can dispel one illness, ten people dispel ten illnesses, a hundred dispel a hundred, a thousand dispel a thousand, and ten thousand dispel ten thousand.\n\nA single person’s body—how could it bear ten thousand illnesses? Thus, one who can thoroughly treat and decisively cure them does so. Do you understand this? Indeed, indeed.\n\nTherefore, teaching them to prepare in advance with warnings, those who perfect the Dao gather them. Indeed, indeed. Proceed—you now understand. Proceed, for the Perfected One clearly sets forth this arrangement.\n\nThe illnesses thus treated are spectral entities and great malevolence, which together act as thieves and bandits. When the emperor and king enjoy peace, they constantly maintain armies and generals to guard against others; yet if these forces turn against righteousness, they become traitors and rebels.\n\nThus, if one person dares to die, ten dare not oppose; if ten dare to die, a hundred dare not oppose; if a hundred dare to die, a thousand dare not oppose; if a thousand dare to die, ten thousand dare not oppose; and if ten thousand dare to die, they may advance unchecked in all directions.\n\nPreparing for illness, injury, and harm, the army and its generals thus maintain twelve thousand men to guard against the unforeseen. The two thousand among them serve only to fill gaps and ensure smooth operations—only then can they be subdued. Does the Perfected One understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\n\"Proceed, for you have now understood. *Ineffectual Grand Pronouncements Without Practical Methods*, One Hundred and Ten.\n\nPermit me to ask one matter, Heavenly Master: now that the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, should not the qi of evil be contemplating its own cessation and departure?\n\nIndeed, what you say is both correct and incorrect. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, evil should naturally dissipate. Yet since the opening of Heaven and Earth, evil qi has accumulated over vast ages, amassing in great multitudes, each generation inheriting and compounding the last. Though the governing qi of Great Peace has come, how could it eradicate all this in a single day? Thus, one must prepare in advance. To wait until evil has already wrought its devastation before seeking skilled artisans—this is far too late.\n\nIn the highest antiquity, each person knew the true Dao, and there was little evil qi. From the era of the Supreme Middle Antiquity onward, people grew foolish, delighting in superficial adornments and neglecting the true Dao. Evil qi, frenzied spirits, and calamitous misfortunes multiplied, so that many met their end before fulfilling their allotted years. All this arose from benighted minds, clouded and obscured, failing to guard against the root in advance.\n\nNow, under the governance of a ruler of supreme virtue, Heaven cherishes him and does not wish him to suffer like those foolish multitudes, cut short in their years. It desires that he swiftly perfect his great virtue and align his heart with Heaven. Thus, Heaven has sent the various Perfected Ones to inquire of doubts, bidding me expound the methods by which one may suppress and repel inauspicious and malevolent forces. For this reason, I have set forth these teachings in full for the Perfected One.\n\nYet now you claim that evil should vanish of itself and no preparations are needed—this is incorrect, a grave misstatement that misleads the noble-minded. Your words cannot be heeded. How can this be so?\"\n\nYet when great urgency arises, one seeks remedies only then—such measures cannot be swiftly obtained, leaving one destitute and distressed. Thus, the Perfected One’s words are gravely mistaken and cannot be followed.\n\nNow, when grain is stored to fill the granaries, it serves to prepare against hunger. I have now expounded this Way with utmost clarity for the Perfected One, that it may endure for ten thousand generations without being forgotten.\n\n“Indeed, indeed.”\n\nIf one waits until hunger strikes before teaching people to sow grain, instructing them to till and cultivate, awaiting the ripening of the harvest before cooking a meal—how could this possibly suffice in time? By then, they would have already starved to death in distress. Or if one fails to sow in spring and, when winter’s hunger gnaws, only then desires to plant grain—yet the seeds do not sprout—how could this ever suffice to save lives? Not only would the individual perish, but the entire household would be wiped out. This is the height of the Perfected One’s folly, the starkest proof of benighted ignorance.\n\nLet me further illustrate with another example. When people dig wells, it is to prepare against thirst; when they dwell near springs, it is to guard against thirst. But if one waits until parched and on the verge of death before digging a well to seek water—how could it be obtained in time? They would already be ruined. This is the Perfected One’s second instance of folly and blindness.\n\nLet me now recount another matter for the Perfected One.\n\nIn ancient times, people built shelters; today, they construct houses and dwellings to prepare against wind and rain. When there is no wind or rain, living in the wild brings utmost joy. Yet if one waits until floating clouds arise and wind and rain descend before building a house—by then, drenched and chilled, one would already be ruined. This is the Perfected One’s third folly.\n\nLet me recount another matter for the Perfected One. Since the era of High Antiquity, sages have established governments, built walled cities and deep moats to prepare against unforeseen calamities. In times of peace, all remains tranquil and untroubled. But when disaster strikes and petty men seek to defile and disrupt the noble, only then do they order the people to construct walled cities and deep moats—how could this ever suffice in an emergency? This is the starkest proof of the Perfected One’s extreme folly and blindness.\n\nLet me further illustrate with another example. Weapons of war are instruments of ill omen, which the noble person fundamentally should not possess. Those below despise them, so they should be placed in sheaths, securely stored, and never prized. Neither should their possession nor their use be valued. They exist only to prepare against the unforeseen. Yet when an urgent crisis arises, only then do they command artisans to quarry stone for iron, smelt it into molten metal, and then have master smiths forge it ten thousand times to create a Moye blade—could this ever suffice in time for battle or defense? One would already be subjugated, life and death surrendered. Is this not the Perfected One’s sixth instance of profound folly?\n\nIndeed, indeed. To err is not an error if one reflects deeply in one’s heart before acting. Thereafter, do not speak lightly or recklessly.\n\nIndeed, indeed. Let me impart to the Perfected One a minor principle, which, when reversed, illuminates the greater truth.\n\nThe ancients, those sagely and wise, devised combs and fine-toothed lice combs to prepare against tangled hair and lice infestations. Yet if one lives without ever grooming, hair becomes irreparably matted, nits and lice multiply beyond counting, and together they feast upon the scalp until sores erupt—only then does one seek fine wood from the southern mountains or rare ivory fit for crafting, commanding skilled artisans to fashion them. By then, the hair is beyond untangling, the lice too numerous to eradicate, and the scalp already ravaged. Is this not another instance of profound folly?\n\nLet me now present to the Perfected One this minor principle, using the small to illustrate the great.\n\nConsider the rivers, seas, and five lakes: near their waters, mosquitoes and horseflies abound. Yet if one fails to prepare in advance what might shield and defend against them, when the swarms rise and descend to feed upon men, cattle, and horses—when cattle and horses thrash their heads and stamp in vain, and men grow desperate, nearing death with no respite—only then does one seek means to repel them. By then, all is already lost.\n\nDoes the Perfected One not clearly see this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYou have already awakened to this. The finest remedies can repel scabies mites, and fine clothing with proper dwellings can ward off fleas and lice—yet if one fails to prepare them in advance, only when affliction strikes does one seek means to dispel them. By then, one is already plunged into profound distress and suffering.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThese are but the most trifling of worldly provisions—how much more so the vast and weighty matters? Between heaven and earth, at every moment there arise violent ghosts, malevolent spirits, calamitous omens, corpse-curses, and deadly visitations. When they descend upon a person, it is as if arrows from blades, bows, and crossbows have pierced the body. The pain is unbearable; in the most severe cases, one gasps for breath without respite, cannot stand upright, and the body is seized by violent frenzy. It is like being in a desolate pavilion, far from the reach of the emperor’s officials, where one’s words are blocked and obstructed, unable to report the crisis. Only then does one seek skilled masters and elders to save oneself—yet by then, all is already lost. Words can no longer pass, and no plea remains to be heard.\n\nDo you understand this? Yes, yes. Go forth—you have now awakened. Thus I am especially urgent about this matter of death, the greatest calamity under heaven. Therefore, my writings—*dōng-dōng*—instruct those of virtue and rulers to prepare in advance. The most wise, upon seeing my words, will surely awaken fully; those of middling wisdom, upon reading my writings, will partially awaken; the foolish and unenlightened will not awaken but instead mock my words for failing to grasp their essence—thus they have already reached their limit. For heaven, earth, and the emperors, there is no matter more pressing than this.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace arrives and the virtuous lord of yang rules, his reign should endure long. Yet death among the people of the world is no small matter. Once dead, one never again beholds heaven and earth, sun and moon—flesh and bone become mere mud. Death is a weighty affair. Each person dwelling between heaven and earth is granted but one life; none may live twice. Only those who have attained the Dao may be reborn after death—those who undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation). These are the ones heaven and earth favor in secret, not even one in ten thousand.\n\nThus, for ordinary people, once dead, there is no return to life. Therefore, one must prepare thoroughly. Even in the era of Great Peace and years of abundance, perverse qi still lingers. It is like a household that is mostly good yet harbors wicked individuals—only by enduring one another is harmony maintained. For this reason, it is all the more necessary to gather those skilled in the Dao and its arts, so that when the unwholesome arises, it may be swiftly eradicated. If not removed promptly, it will take root and grow. Thus, I teach preparedness and the multiplication of such people.\n\nThe purpose of great learning is to accumulate those of virtue and power, ensuring they may be sought when needed. Without prior cultivation and gathering, they cannot be obtained in haste. Should an unforeseen crisis arise and one wish to consult ancient and modern precedents, without those of profound virtue and power already at hand, none will be able to respond promptly or resolve the matter. The ruler, left in darkness and obstruction, will face doubts and questions that cannot be decided in time, only later seeking wise and virtuous masters from distant lands—how could this compare to having them ready at hand?\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\n\"Excellent, you have now greatly awakened. Though your every utterance may invite reproach, without inquiry, ignorance would persist. I wish to resolve one matter for you: whether of high rank—ten thousand men—or middling—several thousand—or low—several hundred—how could they be swiftly obtained and swiftly accomplished?\n\nExcellent indeed is your questioning of affairs. Simply instruct ten or so men to perfect it, and let them naturally transmit and transform one another. In urgent need, they will produce swift results, and those who succeed will emerge. Command the Virtuous Dao Lord of Supreme Power to esteem and cherish them; for those who achieve merit, bestow rewards. The multitude will then aspire to it, and as their aspirations grow, they will follow in great numbers. Let them act, and for those who attain, let all honor and cherish them together.\n\nThe spirits of the four seasons, five phases, heaven, and earth, seeing them esteemed and cherished, will all rejoice and delight, bringing good fortune to people. The Virtuous Lord will long enjoy their auspicious blessings, and whether among the multitude of worthy and profound or the foolish, none will not vie to act thus. As those who do so increase day by day, in time, great and small will all be transformed. When all can act thus, then select from among them those of the greatest merit, gather them all, appoint those of great achievement to their positions, and reward those of lesser merit. None under heaven will not desire to act thus.\n\nYet fear not their great numbers—how could they be too many to record? Why worry over scarcity? Perfected One, how profoundly foolish, benighted, and deluded you are! A single matter, once decisively settled, must not be abandoned; those who merely indulge in grand words are of no benefit to others. Simply follow the model: those who consistently achieve success are those who grasp the intent of the Dao and are greatly trusted by others. Those who know but a few words yet produce no great effect have not grasped the intent of the Dao and speak recklessly—they are great flatterers, unfit for use, and only bring chaos to the Dao.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\nGo now, be cautious and vigilant. Recite and study my writings, ponder their higher and lower meanings, and let like follow like. Use them to verify and complement one another, and you will attain great comprehension, knowing the direction in which my Dao points. Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Secret of the Five Spirits’ Attributes, One Hundred and Eleven**\n\nI wish to ask of a great secret: why does the spirit of the East hold a spear?\n\nYou need not ask.\n\nThe Perfected One must know this already.\n\nYet I ask because, Master, you graciously pity later generations. By setting forth the method, if I do not ask, those of future ages will not comprehend the intent of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nVery well. This is the image of Heaven. All things follow their kind.\n\nThe East is where things first sprout, heads breaking forth, all growth benefiting as they pierce the earth and emerge—its essence resembles a spear. Thus, it is the spear. When the spirit-officials of the East arrive, they take this as their insignia.\n\nThe South: all things hang branches and spread leaves, like a halberd. Thus, its spirit holds a halberd. When the spirit-officials of the South arrive, they take this as their insignia.\n\nThe West is the bow, crossbow, and axe. The West is the image of Heaven’s crossbow of slaughter. The bow, crossbow, and axe are the greatest instruments of harm. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they take these as their insignia.\n\nThe North is the shield, buckler, and blade. The North is where things hide and flee. Shields and bucklers serve to protect the body; blades are wielded by petty men, ever used to evade and harm—these are not the possessions of noble gentlemen. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they too take these as their insignia.\n\nThe Center is thunder, the drum, and the sword. The Center is Earth, the ruler of the Five Phases. The drum is the chief of the five weapons; the sword is worn by gentlemen of virtue and power, and is also the chief of the five weapons. Thus, when the spirits of the Center arrive, they take these as their insignia.\n\nThese are the true and natural credentials of Heaven and Earth. Just as a person is born with a head, so too must they bear their proper insignia. When the authentic credentials arrive in response, anything else is not the true spirit-official. If other spirits falsely arrive in response, all becomes disordered governance. Over time, such chaos is difficult to pacify. Therefore, all seek the true credentials.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThis discourse moves from the shallow to the deep, for even what seems insignificant must align and harmonize with the qi of Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Proceed—Perfected One, you understand this well.\n\nHere ends the method to suppress evil and transform all into the Dao to save lives.\n\n*End of Scroll Seventy-Two of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll Eighty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace follows*\n*Collected Writings of the Three Daoist Texts, Method One Hundred Twenty-Seven*\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions all respectfully bowed. Having previously received the Celestial Master’s teachings to compile and present a solemn memorial, each returned to their respective posts, pressing their hands to their hearts to ponder its meaning. For seven days and seven nights, the Six Perfected Ones convened thrice to deliberate, yet remained perplexed.\n\nThese three assemblies were held in the open, where they witnessed three celestial omens in the form of shooting stars. First, they saw a star emerge from the Gate of Heaven and enter the Door of Earth. Next, they saw a star depart from the Great Yang and plunge into the Great Yin. Third, they saw the constellations stream into the Celestial Prison.\n\nFearing that the Celestial Master’s threefold scriptures might be severed below, preventing their ascent and causing Heaven’s wrath to deepen, they deliberated together. If the qi of the Supreme August One could not descend, then the virtuous sovereign, though steadfast, would continue to bear the lingering disasters of former kings, enduring sorrow and hardship.\n\nAlas! The Six Perfected Ones, having come on behalf of the August Spirit to inquire, must now redouble their efforts for Heaven’s sake.\n\nI have observed that among all disciples, none surpass these Perfected Ones. Now, let them explain the meaning of the shooting stars.\n\nYour six disciples, though dull and benighted, dare not remain silent.\n\nFirst, a star emerged from the Gate of Heaven and entered the Door of Earth. The Gate of Heaven is yang, the sovereign. The Door of Earth is yin, the ministers and people. Now, if the ministers and people do not ascend in their conduct to attach themselves above but instead turn to bestow favor downward—if the door and gate, which govern communication, now see the lower gate fail to ascend while the upper gate opens downward—this signifies that the lower petition is severed, preventing its ascent.\n\nExcellent, Perfected Ones. Your words leave nothing to be added. Though weary, proceed to explain the second omen.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe second omen showed a star from the Great Yang streaming into the Great Yin. The Great Yang is the sovereign; the Great Yin, the ministers and people. The Great Yang is luminous; the Great Yin, dark and obscure. Now, the obscure should flow upward into the luminous, just as ministers and people, benighted and impoverished, should attach themselves to a radiant king and sagely lord to seek redress for their grievances. Yet here, the luminous descends into obscurity—this mirrors imperial edicts bestowing grace, their downward course severed. The obscure remains unilluminated, internal governance descends into chaos, and the darkness veils the sovereign above.\n\nIt also resembles petty officials and local leaders who, together, conceal Heaven and Earth’s calamities and omens, preventing their transmission upward. In darkness, they deceive their superiors alongside the ministers and people, serving as proof of their collusion in villainy.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your words, Six Disciples, leave nothing to be added. Though weary, proceed to explain the third omen.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe third omen showed the constellations streaming into the Celestial Prison. The constellations are stars of goodness and rectitude, yet they flowed into the Celestial Prison—the place where Heaven metes out punishment. This portends that worthy and virtuous men, wishing to serve the sovereign and present memorials to communicate Heaven and Earth’s counsel, are instead resented and maligned by distant officials in the wilderness. Later, these officials fabricate charges to harm them, causing the constellations to stream into prison.\n\nExcellent and precise! Your words, Six Disciples, leave nothing to be added. Now, why do you alone seem aggrieved, as if weary of inquiry?\n\nWe dare not. We have always heard the Celestial Master say that the Perfected Ones come from Heaven to inquire. If we were to cease now, we fear Heaven’s words would not be conveyed. All human lives belong to Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth are displeased, they will instead afflict people with illness, preventing them from fulfilling their allotted years.\n\nExcellent! The Perfected Ones’ words are correct and unerring. Now, I shall speak to you all without daring to omit or slacken. We Perfected Ones are equals, our lives all belonging to Heaven and Earth. If we withhold our words or speak and then cease, Heaven and Earth will together harm us. Thus, I dare not speak recklessly or stop.\n\nProceed, then, and explain fully for the Six Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones have newly emerged to ponder Heaven’s concerns, seeking to eliminate Heaven’s afflictions, and to contemplate the thoughts of a virtuous sovereign, seeking to resolve disasters and secure peace. Let the Six Perfected Ones thoroughly discuss their intentions, expressing all they wish to say, so that nothing is severed or obstructed.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWe dare not fail to exhaust even the meager wisdom of a sparrow or mouse in speaking all we know, as the Celestial Master has commanded.\n\nMost admirable.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, the world fears the closing of mouths, for none dare speak recklessly. Even the sun, moon, and stars—spirits of Heaven’s constellations—stand in awe of one another. Thus, when the sun rises, the stars flee and hide, not daring to appear, fearing its majesty.\n\nWithin the four borders, a stern sovereign commands the realm, and all are struck with terror. Even those far from the capital dare not speak when an imperial edict arrives. If a province has a powerful governor, the entire province dares not speak. If a commandery has a strong magistrate, the whole commandery dares not speak. If a county has a harsh magistrate, the entire county dares not speak. Even if a remote post has a severe post captain, the entire post dares not speak. Yet this post captain is but the lowest of officials—how much more so for ministers?\n\nAll fear harm and seek only to absolve themselves. Though they may harbor good intentions, they dare not express them to their superiors, causing the Dao to be severed at this point. Now, if even a single village has a stern and upright man who upholds its order, the entire village dares not speak, fearing later resentment and harm.\n\nShould but a single household have a man of martial vigor and unyielding qi who holds sway, even that household dares not speak. Yet within a household, all share flesh and blood, born of the same kind—still they loathe and fear one another so. How much more so for those of different generations?\n\nSince the High Antiquity of the Supreme Dao, the Way and its virtue have been largely lost, replaced by governance through might and coercion. Those who press and compel obedience mete out grave harm to any who resist, inflicting wounds so deep they flow to descendants. Thus, though the people witness celestial portents and ominous calamities, they dare not speak rashly of them, fearing those near and bound to them. Such silence accumulates over time, passing burdens from one to the next. By the Latter Antiquity, the affliction grows even more severe: should any minor figure seek to memorialize the throne or speak his mind to the emperor, those nearby who hold his life in their hands will kill him outright—or if not immediately, later conspire to harm him through connections and favors. Thus, ministers and commoners alike seal their tongues and shut their mouths in darkness, though they see sorrow, injustice, and evil, they dare not transmit it upward.\n\nThough the emperor’s wisdom is peerless, celestial anomalies multiply daily—clear proof of this. Now, the people are born and receive their mandate from Heaven and Earth, taking them as father and mother. When they witness disasters, omens, good or ill, these are the words of Heaven and Earth, their very speech. Yet all are so terrified, so threatened by those near and bound to them, that they dare not speak or reveal the matter. Instead, they admonish one another, turning their backs on Heaven and Earth, cutting off all communication, blocking the words Heaven and Earth wish to convey. They thus obscure and wrong Heaven and Earth, preventing their voices from being heard, leaving them long embittered and unexpressed.\n\nThough the emperor may be divine and sagely, he is but one source, nestled within a hundred layers of men, beyond ten thousand li. Even if those within the hundred layers wish to convey words, they are coerced by those near them and cannot reach him. Though the emperor may possess the benevolence and wisdom of ten thousand men, each person is pressed and cowed by fear. Heaven and Earth, the most divine and supreme, are merely gazed upon from afar—people rely on them only to absolve themselves in the moment. How could the emperor’s divinity surpass that of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWe six fools once encountered a fierce tiger in the distant wilderness. All six halted, dared not move, dared not speak, dared not turn our heads, dared not close our eyes. Such is the coercion and fear that men endure! How excellent, how excellent! Now, hearing the words of the Six Perfected Ones, we understand that Heaven alone has long suffered grievous injustice, its words unable to reach above. Though it creates ten thousand strange anomalies as its speech, below they are blocked and severed, unable to ascend, leaving only pent-up bitterness over time.\n\nThus, the wind now stirs the Perfected Ones, instructing them to admonish and charge this matter of the scripture’s transmission. Therefore, the Perfected Ones, trembling and weary, are Heaven’s envoys. Very well. We revere Heaven’s majesty and shall ponder its essential meaning for you in full.\n\nNow, the Six Perfected Ones ask: of these matters, which is the most severe? We six fools deliberated for seven days and seven nights on this matter of the scripture’s transmission, convening thrice and thrice witnessing meteors, taking them as Heaven’s command to instruct and charge men to inquire. Moreover, all six of us ingested qi, yet it could not descend and pass through, instead reversing and rising upward. At that moment, our ears and eyes grew dizzy and blind, and we were all astonished, discussing it together, unaware of what it portended—greatly alarmed and terrified. Only the Heavenly Master explained it to us fools.\n\nExcellent! The Perfected Ones have grasped the ancient transformations and their full meaning. Hearing the Perfected Ones’ words, we now know of the Three Dao Scriptures. Yet the Perfected Ones will soon be blocked and severed again—why? We wish to hear the decisive meaning.\n\nNow, the nine orifices correspond to the divisions of the Nine Provinces. The Perfected Ones themselves say that when they ingest qi, it [blocks] and does not pass through, leaving them dizzy and without light—this is the pressing coercion among the great and small of the Nine Provinces, where urgent words from below cannot reach above. Qi is that which conveys the mandate of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Heaven and Earth transform the mandate of the myriad things through qi and wind. That qi [blocks] and does not pass through is clear proof that the Dao of Heaven is obstructed and cannot reach its destination.\n\nHeaven wishes the Perfected Ones to admonish this matter, thus stirring and moving them through qi. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nProceed—you have understood well.\n\nSo be it.\n\nHeaven instructs the Six Perfected Ones: should I speak to the utmost on this matter? Let the six of you sit at ease and expound the Way fully for all disciples.\n\nFor those who fear the governors and officials of their provinces and dare not speak, let all the virtuous and wise within a province seek one another out and convene in another province to deliberate. If they fear the officials of their commandery, let them convene in another commandery. If they fear their county, let them convene in another county. If they fear their township or ward, let them convene in another township or ward. If they fear their village, let them convene in another village.\n\nIn all cases where prohibitions and fears constrain people, let the transgressions and omens they report be judged according to their severity, and let their original offenses be increased by one degree. Why so severe? It should not be severe—yet we still fear it may be too lenient.\n\nNow, Heaven and Earth cherish a virtuous emperor-king and wish to fully inform him. Yet humankind, born of Heaven and Earth, turns its back on them, severs the celestial discourse, and causes Heaven to fall ill. The accumulation remains unremoved, pent-up and obstructed, unable to convey its message to its children—this is a grave and heinous crime.\n\nThe people and ministers are the envoys of the emperor-king, his hands and feet. They ought to clarify and convey his wisdom, ensuring that above, he may rest without worry, and together, they may align with the heart of Heaven. When Heaven rejoices, it grants the ruler extended years. Yet now, those below act disloyally, betraying Heaven and Earth, blocking the emperor-king’s wisdom, and causing him distress. He constantly reproaches himself for governance gone awry, while disasters and omens multiply, leaving him perilous and uneasy. All this stems from disloyalty, unfiliality, faithlessness, and great transgressions against the law—such offenses are not worthy of pardon. How, then, can severity be questioned?\n\nWhen the celestial discourse cannot flow, Heaven and Earth grow enraged, slaughtering all living things, thus destroying Heaven and Earth. Such is a year of utmost calamity, a realm bereft of wisdom, a nation in grave peril. This crime defies description—it is a transgression deserving of death and beyond.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, for you have now understood. The reason I dare not remain silent is that I see the Six Masters come to inquire of affairs, and I recognize your commission as envoys of Heaven. How, then, could the Perfected Ones dare to withhold their words? Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIf I do not speak now, it would be called misleading those above. The Virtuous Lord, upon seeing these writings, commands all who submit memorials to ensure that those with great merit are duly rewarded. In this way, none under Heaven will fail to rejoice, delighting in exerting their utmost strength to submit memorials and speak of affairs. Let it not be that only a solitary voice is heard—all must gather to deliberate. If one person speaks falsely or with deceitful flattery, it would cause the ruler to lose grasp of reality, and such grave errors must not be heeded.\n\nIn recent years, those who have submitted memorials have done so with increasing reliability, and many have rendered great service. Yet those of the highest rank who gather in numbers are often too few—when only two or three assemble, there are invariably many among them who harbor deceit and falsehood. Why is this so? I wish to explain.\n\nWhen many gather, those who submit memorials naturally restrain one another, fearing that matters may be leaked, that their strengths and weaknesses may be exposed, or that they may be accused of deceiving their superiors or be reported by others. Thus, they dare not speak unless they have thoroughly verified the facts. If they do not verify, they dare not speak, nor dare they conceal anything, for they fear the consequences that may follow. This is why their words are entirely trustworthy.\n\nConsider a village of a hundred households engaged in deceit: among its men, women, children, and elders, there will always be someone who reveals the truth, and neighboring villages will come to know of it. The wise and cautious in that village will not dare to conceal it, fearing they may be implicated. How much less, then, can matters in a prefecture, a commandery, a county, a township, or a post station be hidden? If a commandery experiences extraordinary events, how can they remain concealed? They will inevitably be exposed by others, and thus all good and evil will come to light. Heaven will rejoice greatly, disasters will be dispelled, and the realm will flow as smoothly as running water. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nMoreover, when great assemblies deliberate, none dare deceive, for if one or two attempt falsehood, the rest will refuse to comply. Should any seek to deceive or act in bad faith, the multitude will immediately record and report it. Such conduct—defying Heaven and Earth, deceiving the sovereign, engaging in grand treachery and unrighteousness—incurs the wrath of Heaven and the hatred of humankind. Their crimes admit no pardon.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, for you have now awakened. Once the memorial is submitted and you return home, those who resent your actions may seek to harm you by submitting slanderous petitions—what the left bureau terms \"resentment memorials\"—whose transgressions remain unforgiven. Yet when the three channels of memorials flow unimpeded, none dare obstruct them. Thus, Heaven and Earth rejoice, the sovereign’s accumulated burdens of disaster and misfortune are largely dispelled, and the realm attains Great Peace. The primordial qi of the Highest Sovereign descends in full, aiding the Virtuous Ruler in governance. The Six Perfected Ones shall not fail.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, for the essence of the Six Perfected Ones has greatly advanced, purging Heaven’s afflictions and dispelling the sovereign’s calamities. Their merit is already inscribed in Heaven, and the king’s rule grows daily in strength and clarity. The Six Perfected Ones, in their goodness, have fulfilled their measure. They must strive diligently—caution, the utmost caution!\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly ask for one great secret: may the Celestial Master reveal it? How can we know whether the memorials’ circulation has fully harmonized with the divine spirits?\n\nYes, there is a great verification, for the Dao of Heaven does not deceive. Like seeks like in its search. Let the Virtuous Ruler frequently dispatch trusted officials to inquire among the people: how many suffer from ulcers, pestilence, or scabies? If many bear such afflictions, the memorials have not yet fully harmonized with the divine spirits, for residual suffering remains—worms still consume people, and thus the worms govern them. This is the effect of the lower ranks teeming with immoral subjects, who, like worms, devour the people. Where no ulcers, pestilence, or scabies exist, it is because only the good hold office, and no worms remain. In this, not one in ten thousand errs.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nDoes this alone suffice as proof, or are there further signs?\n\nAll calamities and anomalies under Heaven arise in response to governance, each with its own manifestations. If one but reflects deeply upon the matter, one shall come to understand—why single out ulcers, pestilence, and scabies? Other disasters are merely visible in the myriad things, yet none is more severe than worms devouring people, and thus it serves as verification.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nHad we not earnestly inquired of the Heavenly Master, we would have had no means of knowing this. Now that the Perfected Ones have spoken, we understand at once—this was but a gesture of humility.\n\nWe dare not, we dare not. We six foolish students, having received the Heavenly Master’s solemn instruction, shall return to our respective dwellings and contemplate its essential meaning. Yet the Heavenly Master’s writings urge all, from the highest to the lowest, even to servants and slaves, to gather and jointly submit memorials reporting calamities, anomalies, good and ill omens—is this not overly burdensome?\n\nWe wish to hear the reasoning behind this.\n\nExcellent! You six have been tasked with inquiring of Heaven’s affairs—proceed with utmost care, for the Perfected Ones speak by Heaven’s decree.\n\nThe reason for extending this to commoners and even slaves is this: under Heaven’s vast expanse, regions a myriad *li* apart differ in sky and earth; five thousand *li* apart, they differ slightly; a thousand *li* apart, their *qi* and winds diverge; five hundred *li* apart, they differ again in small measure; a hundred *li* apart, their yin and rain vary; fifty *li* apart, they differ once more in minor ways. Within a single county, anomalies, calamities, strange phenomena, good and ill omens all manifest uniquely.\n\nWhen the August Heaven sends forth calamities and strange transformations, they do not necessarily appear only in the imperial palace, the halls of local officials, or before high-ranking magistrates. Such anomalies are most often seen in the wilderness and among the common folk, where the lowly and humble learn of them first. Yet each conceals them out of fear for their superiors, daring not speak. Officials, too, conceal them out of fear for their lords, and so the discourse between Heaven and Earth is severed.\n\nEach seeks to flatter their superiors, desiring their names to be praised and their merits swiftly recognized, so they collude in wrongdoing, suppressing Heaven and Earth’s calamities and anomalies, blocking their transmission to the emperor. Thus, the Son of Heaven is cut off without cause, deprived of wisdom, unable to grasp the will of Heaven and Earth. His governance grows perilous and chaotic, fraught with sorrow.\n\nThe emperor is born by the mandate of Heaven, with Heaven as his father and Earth as his mother, making him the Son of Heaven. When ministers and people together act without the Dao, they sever the discourse between father and mother, preventing it from reaching their child. What crime could be greater?\n\nTo jointly sever the discourse of Heaven and Earth, to deceive one’s superiors, to be unfaithful and untrustworthy as ministers and people—how could such offenses be named lightly? Do you now understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMoreover, all people, ministers, servants, and slaves are born of Heaven, nurtured by Earth, and governed and sustained by the emperor. These three matters constitute their very lives—without them, there would be no means to be born, to grow, or to nourish and order themselves. Yet they all turn to deceive their superiors, collectively ignorant of Heaven and Earth, rendering the emperor devoid of wisdom and obstructed. Their crimes merit ten thousand deaths, and even then, their guilt would remain unexhausted—how grave is this!\n\nPerfected One, are you so benighted as not to comprehend? People are born of Heaven and nurtured by Earth. When Heaven and Earth suffer distress and illness, they manifest anomalies and transformations to admonish their child, desiring joyfully to see governance rectified. Yet the foolish people jointly sever the discourse of Heaven, incurring the great wrath of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe emperor is the father and mother of the people and ministers, yet they collectively deceive their parents, causing them constant mental anguish and hindering the peace of their rule. What fault could be greater? Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the accumulated hardships of karmic inheritance have all arisen from this. Thus, the people are permitted to submit memorials.\n\nNow, the Radiant Virtue Lord governs, and Heaven, grieved by its difficulties, has sent me to speak. Excellent, excellent indeed! Come, let me now explain this to you, Perfected One.\n\nToday, a solar eclipse—a most extraordinary omen in all under Heaven—may be witnessed by some yet unseen by others. The myriad calamities, anomalies, and transformations in the world are all the discourse of Heaven and Earth, the shifts of yin and yang. Some kingdoms may not witness them, yet their provinces do; some provinces may not, yet their commanderies do; some commanderies may not, yet their counties do; some counties may not, yet their townships do; some townships may not, yet the people do; some in one village may not, yet those in another do.\n\nThus, in the governance of the ancient worthies and sages, even the lowliest were encouraged to report strange occurrences, aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth to secure their own well-being. Therefore, their rule alone remained perpetually peaceful, in perfect accord with Heaven.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace flourishes, even a single matter left unresolved disrupts harmony, and the upright qi of Heaven fails to arrive. It is like foolish people draining the waters to fish—no dragons will appear. This is what it means.\n\nTherefore, all the people are now permitted to speak, so that not even a hair’s breadth of Heaven’s will is lost, and governance may be secured. Let the people exert themselves to submit memorials, and let local officials, fearing they may lag behind, swiftly dispatch clerks to inquire about what the people have witnessed, promptly reporting it upward. In this way, no calamity or anomaly will be overlooked.\n\nThus, the August Heaven and Revered Earth will rejoice greatly and cherish their emperor. How is this made clear?\n\nYet there are signs: when the sun and moon radiate their great brightness, when the arrayed stars hold to their courses and do not err in their movements—these are the proofs of Heaven’s joy. When Earth rejoices, the hundred rivers flow in order, never surging forth in reckless motion; the myriad things appear nurtured, growing well and inclined toward goodness—these are the proofs of Earth’s delight. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe Heavenly Master deigns to pity this foolish student, allowing one who has grasped the matter to advance questions. Because I have been treated with such generosity, I may now ask all that I doubt. Now, why is it that the people are made to record calamities and anomalies?\n\nExcellent, your question is apt. When such events are observed, they should be recorded at once, whether at dawn or dusk, door by door. At month’s end, these records are gathered and deliberated together. What is fit to be reported is sent upward; what is not yet sufficient waits for further omens in the following month. In this way, the magistrates of each district and commandery will attend to the times of dawn and dusk among the people—then it may be said that not even a hair’s breadth of Heaven’s portents is lost.\n\nOfficials will stand in awe of the people, and the people in awe of the officials. Both, fearing one another, will ensure that all reports are truthful, not erring by even a fraction of a tael. Thus the emperor may sit in his secluded chamber without worry. When the people, ministers, and common folk—great and small—all act with perfect loyalty and good faith, their true sentiments may reach him, and the realm will know nothing but joy.\n\nShould there be those who obstruct this, they must be recorded together: these are the treacherous ministers, the disloyal and unfilial, the ignorant of Heaven and Earth, who conspire to deceive their superiors, severing the clarity of those above. This is a grave transgression, and so they must be swiftly recorded as one. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, and should you have doubts, return to ask.\n\nNow the Six Perfected Ones all return in reverent contemplation, while only the Heavenly Master commands the senior officials. The people are to record together all calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences—what sort are these?\n\nExcellent! The Six Disciples inquire with such thoroughness, not deviating from the heart of Heaven nor failing the Virtuous Lord. This is deemed meritorious before Heaven and Earth, and all things under creation shall benefit therefrom.\n\nThe reason is this: as they inquire of Heaven’s affairs with meticulous care, exhausting every detail, nothing is lost even by the weight of a fraction. The yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, the Three Luminaries, the Five Phases, the Four Seasons, the spirits and deities, and the myriad things—all that they wish to express may be seen. Thus is their great merit.\n\nDo you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, and for the Six Perfected Ones, I shall expound this in detail; follow closely and record it.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, great calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are Heaven and Earth’s great discourse. Moderate calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are their middling discourse. Minor calamities, anomalies, and strange occurrences are their small discourse.\n\nDo you wish to grasp their essential meaning? It is like a person’s great affairs and great discourse, middling affairs and middling discourse, small affairs and small discourse. These, whether great or small, all convey meaning—they are not empty signs. Heaven and Earth do not deceive humanity.\n\nWhen great auspicious omens appear, it is their great joy. When moderate auspicious omens appear, it is their moderate joy. When minor auspicious omens appear, it is their minor joy.\n\nWhen great inauspicious portents and ill omens appear, it is Heaven and Earth’s great wrath. When moderate inauspicious portents and ill omens appear, it is their moderate wrath. When minor inauspicious portents and ill omens appear, it is their minor wrath.\n\nWhen all is tranquil, with neither auspicious nor inauspicious changes, it is their state of neither joy nor anger.\n\nDo you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nDisasters, anomalies, and strange transformations—whether great or small—must be recorded without the slightest omission. Why so thorough? Foolish Perfected One, all transgressions, great and small, must be observed; likewise, the goodness or evil of all things, great and small, must be fully seen and known. For good deeds, one must acknowledge their merit and respond with goodness that surpasses the original act. For faults, one must repeatedly admonish them to align with the intentions of Heaven and Earth.\n\nDo you wish to know their effects? Heaven is like a ruler or sovereign. If a minor request is not heeded, it harbors minor resentment. If a moderate request is ignored, its resentment grows greater. If a major request is disregarded, harm ensues. Thus, all things, great and small, must be recorded so as not to provoke Heaven and Earth’s resentment or wrath. Excellent, excellent!\n\nI wish to hear the meaning of these records. Record anomalies, disasters, strange transformations, illnesses, and diseases—whether great or small, many or few—as well as unusual winds and rains, and the sufferings of the people and all things. All, great and small, must be gathered, deliberated upon, and recorded. The purpose of having all record these is this: officials will know one another’s strengths and weaknesses, the people will know one another’s strengths and weaknesses, those dwelling near mountains and hills will know the changes of mountains and hills, those near markets and walled cities will know the changes of markets and walled cities, those on level land will know the changes of level land, and those near low-lying fields and waters will know the changes of low-lying fields and waters. Thus, high and low, inner and outer, all will be known without omission—this is the method to swiftly attain Great Peace. It is the principle by which emperors and kings should govern, the way to never lose the great intent of Heaven and Earth.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\nGo forth, for you have grasped it.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, the prevalence of inherited calamities stems from the failure to record matters down to the common folk, from the failure to collectively record all things, great and small. When strange changes occur, officials from other jurisdictions are sent to investigate. Each governs only within their own boundaries, and local officials conceal and suppress the truth, jointly hiding it. Thus, the words of Heaven and Earth are severed, unable to ascend and reach their emperors and kings. The harm runs deep, causing Heaven’s sorrow to deepen, disasters to multiply, and misfortune to accumulate—all rooted in this.\n\nWhen officials from other jurisdictions come to examine matters, how can they know the long-standing sufferings of the people? Some, bound by close ties, repeatedly collude to conceal the truth. Others, harboring old grudges against certain households, falsely amplify disasters and fabricate incidents, further concealing them. This severs the discourse of Heaven and Earth, compounds the grievances of the innocent, and drives the people below to follow one another in bribery and corruption. These three matters all constitute grave harm, knotting the qi of injustice and further exacerbating disasters. Thus, governance becomes impossible to rectify.\n\nNow, when the Great Yang arises and the qi of peace flourishes, a virtuous ruler should govern, and all under Heaven should attain Great Peace, each finding their rightful place. For this reason, the Six Perfected Ones have come to inquire in full, and I have explained it all to them. Do you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, when Heaven intends to favor and assist an emperor or king, it first ensures they possess their own intent. From ancient times to the present, whenever Heaven has favored and assisted a ruler, it invariably bestows upon them extraordinary texts and uncommon strategies, enabling them to govern by their precepts—whereupon all their undertakings prove greatly auspicious.\n\nWhen Heaven does not intend to favor or benefit a ruler, it severs all such extraordinary texts and uncommon strategies, preventing their attainment. Even if obtained, it renders their minds dull, so they fail to comprehend or apply them. When Heaven intends to benefit a ruler, it opens their minds to clarity and delight, so they gladly employ them.\n\nThis is Heaven’s unchanging law, which does not deceive humankind. Therefore, those destined for prosperity tend to favor goodness, while those destined for decline tend to favor evil. Those destined for fortune are easily guided, while those destined for misfortune resist counsel and offend others, making them impossible to guide.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, Heaven constantly assists the good, and the Dao longs to return to those of virtue. Heaven refuses to assist the wicked, and the Dao refuses to cling to the foolish and benighted. Therefore, it frequently instructs the Perfected Ones to entrust governance to virtuous rulers.\n\nThe purpose of meticulously recording all omens—great and small, good and evil, internal and external, near and far—is to enable virtuous rulers above, together with their worthy ministers, to trace the origins of these anomalies. All the world’s strange portents and calamities arise as reflections of affairs, modeled upon conduct, and generated in accordance with their kind. When worthy ministers gather to deliberate, their thoughts become as vast as the matter itself. By examining the categories of events and inquiring into their patterns, the truth is revealed.\n\nThen Heaven and Earth rejoice daily, and the emperor and king attain daily peace. Thus, virtue reaches its fullest harmony, and no spirit or deity fails to respond. To witness its great efficacy: all the world’s afflictions, sufferings, and anomalies vanish entirely; ministers and people all act with goodness, responding to edicts with precision, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Below, none dare deceive their superiors—this is the manifest proof.\n\nWhere many harms remain, deceit abounds; where few harms remain, deceit diminishes; where no harm remains, no deceit exists. By constantly observing what is presented from below, one may gauge the great and small, the loyal and faithless among ministers and people. Matched against events, it is like gazing into a bright mirror, speaking face-to-face.\n\nHow wondrous is the Dao when thus practiced! This is the bright mirror by which Heaven assists the ruler of supreme virtue in governing all under Heaven.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now and deliver this to the ruler of virtue—make haste!\n\nIf a single person submits a memorial, it is called a \"dropped document,\" and entrusting governance to a single confidant is called \"great deceit.\" This incurs Heaven’s profound resentment, and the Dao of Heaven is perpetually disrupted. If two people jointly submit a memorial, it is called \"Great Yin,\" a collusion of treachery and deceit. Two cunning individuals conspire in secrecy, harboring shared grievances to fabricate falsehoods—this brings misfortune upon Earth, and the Dao of Earth is thrown into great disorder.\n\nIf three people jointly submit a memorial, their collaboration remains insincere. Though they may instruct one another, if they share a common grievance and submit a matter to settle private scores, their deceit of their superiors is assured. This makes an enemy of the harmonious mean, throwing the qi of harmony into chaos. If four people jointly submit a memorial, there is often one who fears the truth, whose flaws are exposed by others, leading to accusations and false charges. Though it may resemble truth, its unreliability disrupts the four seasons.\n\nIf five people jointly submit a memorial, it may seem true but remains unverified—its falsehood disrupts the Five Phases. If six people jointly submit a memorial, it approaches truth but remains uncertain—its falsehood disrupts the Six Harmonies. If seven people jointly submit a memorial, it appears credible. Eight approach truth, nine approach sincerity, and ten nearly attain it.\n\nWhy, Heavenly Master, do you harbor so many doubts?\nI wish to hear the essential point.\n\nThe reason for these many doubts is that in the Five Directions, cunning individuals often harbor private grievances, using public matters to settle private scores. They readily conspire to become great deceivers and treacherous schemers, disrupting the Dao of Heaven and Earth to mislead their superiors. Thus, I dare not hastily trust them.\n\nHowever, if a matter is small, gather people of all ages—wise and foolish, men and women, down to servants—and deliberate together. Falsehood cannot prevail, nor can private scores be settled. If any among them feel uneasy and speak out, whether foolish, loose-tongued, unable to conceal, or elderly with little to fear, or even women and children who chatter carelessly, their collusion will be exposed.\n\nThus, the truth of the matter is revealed, and no treachery remains. When truth is attained, the hearts of Heaven and Earth are harmonized.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe fundamental reason emperors and kings have borne successive transgressions and responsibilities, why governance continually loses the heart of Heaven, and why disasters flow unceasingly—with those that cease only to arise anew—is that the August Heaven remains unsettled. Harmful qi and illnesses abound, preventing long-lasting great joy. Even fleeting moments of happiness soon turn to misfortune. The root of this great fault lies precisely here.\n\nCunning and treacherous people jointly turn their backs on Heaven and Earth to deceive the emperor and king. Yet people regard Heaven and Earth as their mandate and the emperor and king as their parents. Fools who betray this mandate and collude to deceive their parents incur the shared hatred of Heaven and Earth and the emperor’s wrath. By law, their evil deaths are insufficient to expiate their crimes, and their punishment extends to future lives.\n\nThus, disasters never cease, harm multiplies daily, human lifespans shorten, and the myriad things remain in constant disorder. The true fault lies here.\n\nHave you now fully awakened to this, Perfected One? Have you deeply understood it?\nIndeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have grasped it.\n\nTherefore, I know the August Heaven profoundly detests such evil. Thus, I have made this text repeatedly emphasize it for balance. To lose even one matter is to invite its rise. What was lost in the past may be regained in the future—this is especially grave, for Heaven greatly abhors it.\n\nI know its import and hereby instruct the Perfected One, entrusting it to a ruler of supreme virtue and power. If he obtains and practices it, he will differ not from the divine. Then the upright qi of the Great Peace and Supreme Sovereign will naturally establish itself.\n\nMy text dares not betray Heaven and Earth, nor the ruler of supreme virtue, nor the people of later generations and future ages, nor the myriad things. Practicing it yields immediate results.\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nI wish to ask: why does one person’s memorial to the throne disrupt Heaven? Why do two people disrupt Earth? This occurs when each follows their own household, and their strategies resonate in mutual influence—this is the natural law. Do you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\nGo forth, for you have already grasped it.\n\nAll under Heaven follow their own kind. I venture to ask, Heavenly Master: now that this text has been revealed, can its words be fully verified in practice so that all under Heaven will believe without doubt?\n\nIndeed, all under Heaven will believe without doubt.\n\nI wish to hear the meaning of this.\n\nThen let me speak to the Perfected One of its essential import. Now, the governing officials and magistrates fear that the people will expose their affairs, and so they employ the Six Inquiries to examine them, thereby securing their trust. The people, too, fear the county authorities, and if they uncover their faults, they likewise believe. The county authorities and magistrates, dwelling among the people, also fear those who travel to other regions to submit memorials, and if they uncover their faults, they believe them as well. Those who travel to submit memorials also fear the county magistrates and the local people, and if their faults are exposed, they too are believed. Each fears the other, and thus none dare speak falsely, nor can they conceal anything.\n\nTherefore, when memorials are submitted from three sources—the county authorities, the local people, and the traveling petitioners—they all align at dawn, not deviating by even a fraction. How divine! The Dao operates thus. I wish to ask: when should those who gather to deliberate assemble?\n\nExcellent is your question. All shall be recorded beneath the abode of the Great Peace and Coming Good. Why must it be here?\n\nFor there are extraordinary methods and exceptional texts that may be deposited in the abode of the Great Peace and Coming Good, where good and evil are deliberated beneath it, and matters from the four directions are collectively submitted. If only one person deliberates, they may regret and cease, or be stopped by others. If a memorial is submitted but then halted along the way, the intent is abandoned, and the concealed matter is punished as a crime.\n\nThrough such writings, all under Heaven will be secured, and the emperor and kings will long wander in leisure.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nHerein lies the accumulation of the Celestial Master’s writings—where ought they all be deposited? Those texts intended solely for the sovereign shall remain with the sovereign; all that pertain to the affairs of all under Heaven shall be fully disclosed. Do you understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed. The sovereign of supreme virtue is moved by Heaven itself to possess a sagely mind, and through this, naturally harbors good intentions, naturally issues virtuous decrees and rites—this is the celestial law, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. The matters are too numerous to record in full; the writings are ever a burden. Proceed.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTo the right: Heaven’s decree to the Six Perfected Ones, instructing them to deeply comprehend the threefold Dao in the transmission of written texts and oral instructions.\n\n*End of Scroll Eighty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Beginning of Scroll Eighty-Eight of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Method for Establishing the Abode of Coming Good, One Hundred Twenty-Ninth*\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions bow and ask, wishing to pose a single question.\n\nProceed with your words.\n\nThe Celestial Master previously commanded this humble student to compile and collate the essential texts of the High, Middle, and Low Antiquities, as well as the finest discourses of the wise and enlightened—matters transmitted orally. Now, within and beyond the four borders, some regions lie ten thousand leagues from the emperor, yet if there exist good writings, though their content be scant, they are carried from afar to the capital. Or if there be extraordinary texts, rare methods, or wondrous arts, scholars and recluses of profound learning, though duty-bound not to shun the journey of ten thousand leagues, may travel to the emperor to offer and expound their moral teachings. Or among the common folk—young and old, weak and small, field-dwelling infants, women, and children—each may harbor in their hearts good characters, oral instructions, or a few lines, yet their meager offerings prevent them from dispatching someone to carry them to the capital. Or among the barbarians of the four borders—hidden sages, Hu and Mo tribes—those deeply versed in secret Dao, though they know of the radiant and virtuous sovereign in the Central Kingdom, cannot bear the distant journey to present their rare texts, good strategies, or exceptional methods.\n\nNow the Celestial Master has gathered all the divine writings of the Yellow River and Luo River, the good texts of antiquity and present, along with the oral instructions of the wise and enlightened, to form the *Scripture of the Utmost Profundity*. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, all disasters may thus be eradicated, and the emperor may long wander in leisure, ruling with folded arms and without care. Yet if even one matter is left incomplete, residual calamities may remain—hence the need to gather them all. But how are these rare methods, exceptional strategies, and good characters to be fully obtained?\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThe Perfected Ones ponder deeply, for the celestial spirits have already descended to instruct them. The qi of the Supreme August One comes to assist the virtuous sovereign—\n\nProceed. Now, Perfected Ones, you have asked on behalf of the August Numinous Heaven. My duty is to expound fully for all under Heaven—how dare I be remiss?\n\nUnderstood.\n\nLet the Perfected Ones be seated, for I shall now explain all to you.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThis scripture shall be entrusted to the August and Virtuous Emperor of the Supreme August One. Upon seeing the celestial texts, he must ponder their essential meaning and command the provinces, commanderies, and distant counties, towns, and villages of the four borders to each construct a fine abode along the great thoroughfares of the cities. Let it stand three *zhang* high, with a breadth and depth of three *zhang* as well. On all four sides, create good petitions, sized to match a person’s face, with openings wide enough for hands to pass through, and shelter their doors well—lest unauthorized persons force entry. Hang writings upon its exterior, clearly displaying the texts, and inscribe the abode’s purpose on all four sides.\n\nThe writings shall state: The emperor seeks rare texts, exceptional methods, good strategies, oral instructions, and the constant thoughts harbored in people’s hearts—whatever they can articulate. Let all be written down and deposited in this abode, with their names and surnames recorded. Then, summon and examine them, appointing positions according to the magnitude of their moral abilities. For those whose contributions are too numerous to verify, command the local officials of counties and towns to appoint them to office. For the elderly, weak, and women with good words, command the responsible officials to reward them. For those with great merit who cannot be appointed, grant them exemptions. For those beyond the four borders who present good and rare strategies with great efficacy, bestow generous rewards.\n\nThus, within and beyond the four borders, all shall simultaneously rise in great enthusiasm, rejoicing to devote their efforts to the emperor. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, no rare text, good character, or exceptional method shall remain hidden in distant lands. In a single day, all people shall turn to joyfully embrace goodness. Hidden recluses dwelling in caves shall emerge to wander the cities, beholding the emperor’s abode of Great Peace and Coming Good—none shall conceal themselves. Wind and rain shall arrive in due season, the Three Luminaries shall illuminate brightly—this is the sign of Heaven’s great joy.\n\nWhen the worthy sages of the eighty-one domains among the Four Barbarians hear that the Central Kingdom is governed by a sovereign of great virtue in this manner, none shall not delight in coming to submit, all bearing their rare treasures in continuous procession. Not one in ten thousand of my writings shall be lost—how could this not bring immense joy?\n\nWith governance of such great virtue, do the Perfected Ones now comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed. You have already awakened.\n\nWhere the writings within a household are exceedingly numerous, the master of the house shall expand its doors to gather the texts therein. These shall be brought before the senior officials and assembly of worthies, who together shall arrange the good among them by category, removing the harmful and eliminating redundancies. Ordered by matter and sequence, they shall be presented to the emperor. The emperor shall again command the assembly of worthies to arrange them, removing redundancies and harmful or improper passages, categorizing them anew before placing them in a separate repository. Further writings from the four directions shall be awaited, then arranged in sequence and by category, with later arrivals to follow in due course.\n\nFrom the good households of the four directions, once the most extraordinary and uniquely excellent writings and strategies have been selected, the remainder shall be securely sealed. Where accumulated texts are abundant, they shall again be arranged and presented. Thus, the flow of submissions from the four directions shall gradually diminish, nearing completion.\n\nThe assembled worthies, in their wisdom, shall compile and order the submissions, binding them into the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*. Thereupon, the greatly awakened worthies shall disseminate them to the people below. In a single day, the hundred clans and myriad folk shall all be transformed toward goodness, no longer knowing the ways of evil.\n\nThis is what it means to fully win the hearts of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the Four Barbarians—great joy arriving daily, all uniting as one household to achieve a single governance. Do the Six Perfected Ones comprehend this?\n\nIndeed, indeed. Proceed, for the Six Perfected Ones have already understood.\n\nWhen the Yi and Di hear of this, they shall daily retreat, and the Central Kingdom shall daily expand, growing stronger without battle or conquest. Heaven and Earth shall aid in the removal of evil—an occurrence unseen since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Thus, the world shall rejoice greatly, as the spirits of Heaven and Earth together dispel the emperor’s inherited burdens. Disasters and omens shall vanish, and his governance shall differ not from that of the divine.\n\nThe people of the world shall gain access to wondrous methods of the Dao and virtue, all inclining toward good writings and upright words, no longer engaging in wickedness. The submissions shall grow ever more excellent with each year. Thereafter, a minor compilation shall be made every three years, and a major one every five, with the subsequent texts appended and returned to the people, so that all shall delight in goodness and be unable to restrain themselves.\n\nFrom these, the most excellent matters beneficial to the emperor’s upright governance shall be retained and not disseminated below. Do the Perfected Ones understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, Perfected One, Heaven has sent your disciples to inquire—since this is a matter Heaven itself has asked, you shall compose the *Scripture of Great Joy* for the Virtuous Lord. Exert yourself and do not slacken.\n\nHeaven shall repay your merit, for you remove afflictions on behalf of the August Heaven and Earth, and dispel the accumulated disasters and poisons of inherited burdens for the emperor. Your lifespan shall surely be extended. My words do not deceive the Perfected One. Take heed.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth and return. Strive with utmost diligence. If you have doubts, come again.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nPerfected One, step forward.\n\nWhen you first came to ask these matters, I had long intended to depart. Thus, I had already spoken words of parting with you. Yet seeing your earnestness, I knew you were aided by the yang essence of August Heaven. The reason for this is that I saw your sincerity, and that the Middle Kingdom shall flourish in great peace. The eighty-one domains shall send forth good people to return and submit to the Middle Kingdom. Therefore, I remained to explain everything to you in full.\n\nThe reason for this is that I saw you ceaselessly inquiring on Heaven’s behalf, and feared you might incur great fault, bringing censure from Heaven and Earth. Thus, I dared not abandon the Dao and depart midway.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo, and strive to complete this with utmost sincerity. Do not forsake the Heavenly Dao. Ask this one final question.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly request to ask: Master of Heaven, what did you observe in the bustling crossroads of the capital that led you to establish a chamber for the *Scripture of Wondrous Methods and Secret Strategies* to bring about Great Peace?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, your difficult question has grasped the essential meaning. Heaven has long been grieved. Has the emperor sent you to ask this? How skillfully you present your words!\n\nYet from my dwelling in the heavens, I have observed what can be seen. It was not in vain that I established this abode of August Peace at the crossroads. The Heavenly Duke asked: Why is it so difficult for the world to attain peace and security? The divine officials of the Five Phases replied: Now, the emperor dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, separated from the four borders by ten thousand times ten thousand *li*. Those most distant suffer from deep-seated grievances, and the good and evil of their deeds cannot ascend to reach him. Wondrous methods, rare writings, and extraordinary strategies are cut off and never arrive before the emperor.\n\nThe people and ministers, bound by grievances, cannot petition or communicate. Over time, the four directions become obstructed and blocked. The worthy and learned conceal themselves, harboring their virtue and power, growing despondent until death. The emperor, deprived of their extraordinary strategies and uncommon words, cannot bring peace to the world. The great fault lies in the closure and obstruction of the distant borders on all sides.\n\nThus, in accordance with Heaven’s will, I have established this abode for the Virtuous Lord of the Dao and Great Peace at the crossroads, to gather and bring forth the finest *qi* of the Supreme August and the Tranquil Peace. I wish to delight the four directions, so that all may know the Virtuous Lord has issued these teachings. They shall rejoice as one, each bringing their good offerings and rare methods to present and return them to the throne, no matter how distant. There shall be no more obstruction.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nWithout the Master of Heaven’s inquiry, this would not be known. Yet if people truly possess the nature of Heaven, they may know it themselves—this is the highest. Those who cannot know it themselves must inquire—this is the next best.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly request to ask one more matter.\n\nSpeak.\n\nWhy must it be made three *zhang* in both length and height? Excellent, your question indeed.\n\nFirst, three is the beginning of numbers. The celestial numbers also conclude at ten, the terrestrial numbers also conclude at ten, and the human numbers also conclude at ten—thus it is made three *zhang*. It is to delight and harmonize Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, causing all to rejoice together, and so it takes the form of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.\n\nNow, I ask: why do the three numbers all conclude at ten?\n\nIt is because Heaven possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang; Earth possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang; Humanity possesses the Five Phases and also has its own yin and yang—thus they all reach ten.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nIs it only Heaven, Earth, and Humanity that are thus?\n\nAre all things in the myriad realms also thus?\n\nIndeed, all things in the myriad realms take the form of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Thus, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity all follow the Four Seasons and Five Phases in their flourishing and decline.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Truly, you may be said to have understood.\n\nI humbly request to ask one more matter.\n\nSpeak.\n\nWhy must one create these openwork patterns on all four sides, aligning them with the face?\n\nIt is because the openwork allows worthy scholars to inscribe their strategies. The openwork delights in the free flow of the four directions, no longer obstructed or cut off. It enables the worthy to each record their words and submit them to this Chamber of Great Peace and Coming Goodness.\n\nAs for aligning with the face— the face is the finest part of a person. The portion of Great Yang mirrors the Dao of Heaven, delighting in each person following the heart of Heaven, contemplating goodness, and joining forces with the virtuous ruler to bring peace to the world together. Thus, it is made to align with the face.\n\nThe face possesses the Seven Corrects: ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, through which qi flows, and spirits and deities come and go. It delights in great worthies inscribing their strategies, so that from the four directions, eight extremities, and distant lands, all that is keen and bright may arrive.\n\nNow, though the emperor dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, separated from the people by ten thousand leagues, his radiant teachings and commands flow unimpeded, never losing the heart of Heaven and Earth, thereby securing his person.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nWould you inquire, which officials should be appointed to guard this abode?\n\nThe chief officials shall directly oversee it, proclaiming its name as the Abode of Great Peace and the Hall of Delight in Virtue.\n\nExcellent!\n\nThe foolish student has known that Heaven is already greatly joyful, Earth already profoundly pleased and cautious in conduct, humanity already governed by Great Peace, and the myriad things already settled in their proper places.\n\nNow, how does the Perfected One know this?\n\nThe foolish student has seen that the Heavenly Master, as the Virtuous Lord of Great Peace, has established this grand abode of joy to facilitate the discourse between Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Now, it enables the people and ministers below to each present their words to their ruler, allowing the emperor to obtain extraordinary strategies, exceptional writings, and unique methods that ensure his long-term security.\n\nMoreover, Heaven and Earth may communicate their discourse, and even the humble commoners may convey their virtuous words, thereby dispelling the gloom of Heaven and Earth and aiding their ruler in becoming wise and enlightened.\n\nHeaven and Earth, together with humanity, as the foremost of all things, thus achieve complete communication—hence, the great joy.\n\nThe Perfected One speaks truly; excellent indeed! I have nothing to add.\n\nYour words on this matter deeply enter the true Dao.\n\nI would now ask to resolve one doubt.\n\nSpeak.\n\nNow, Heaven itself is gloomy and wishes to speak—why then does it instead employ humans to discourse? Excellent indeed, your challenging question has grasped the essence.\n\nYet the Dao of Heaven turns and operates through mutual dependence, each employing the other. Thus, *dui* serves as the mouth of Heaven and Earth, and humanity does likewise. Like seeks like, and so humanity becomes the voice of Heaven and Earth.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand this? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, for you are easily enlightened. Strive on, strive on. Indeed, indeed.\n\nYet this discourse is but briefly concluded—ask no further, lest the Way’s texts become difficult to comprehend and only deepen confusion. Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, and heed this one matter for the Perfected One: you have already collated the texts of exceptional methods. Roll and append a singular, excellent method—the foundational art of nurturing inner nature—beneath the scrolls, so that all worthy ones may recite and study it. This shall become a scripture of profound extremity. Those who complete it shall gather these methods to cultivate themselves, recite this art to preserve their wholeness, and each shall find lasting joy in their existence.\n\nThe most worthy may serve as pillars of the state, the moderately worthy as minor officials, and even the lowliest who cannot hold office may long nurture their kin and steadfastly safeguard their descendants. Excellent, most excellent!\n\nThe world shall know great joy and delight, for goodness shall have no equal, and evil people shall cease to exist. You have already understood this—go now, reflect upon it, and hold it in your thoughts.\n\nSince you have undertaken this inquiry on behalf of Heaven, do not grow lax. Indeed, indeed.\n\nTo seek goodness and thereby bring about Great Peace, uniting the world in a single day to dwell in the joyous abode of the Supreme August One.\n\n*Here ends the eighty-eighth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*The eighty-ninth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*The One Hundred and Thirtieth Text: The Eight Trigrams’ Return to Essence and Recitation*\n\nMysterious brightness illumines within, the great darkness teems with qi. Sharing rank with the worthy, it resides in the domains of *ren* and *gui*, the body united with *hai* and *zi*. Circulating in mutual embrace, utmost yin gives birth to yang—this is called the First Nine.\n\nWhen the One unites to generate beings, yin halts and yang arises. Receiving bestowal in *hai*, conceiving in *ren*, it flourishes in *zi*. From child to grandchild, yang enters within yin, its generation unceasing.\n\nContemplate the outer to penetrate the inner; lifespan doubles, yet this cannot be swiftly attained—it is fitting for long duration. Lesser yang holds qi, sharing its position with the liver, in *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, and *mao*, akin to the color green. The essence of the myriad things emerges in profusion, front and back intermingling, benevolence and kindness imprinted upon the heart.\n\nWhen a valiant warrior is about to set forth, let him recite and behold these characters: his radiance shall be as the sun at its first rising. A hundred illnesses shall be cured, and his years shall increase threefold. Greater yang abounds in qi, akin to the heart, dwelling in the house of *bing* and *ding*, nurtured in the positions of *si* and *wu*. Beholding it, a hundred evils depart, and the body daily grows upright. One’s intent should be gentle and luminous—this must not be forcibly sought. To see the character is to gain longevity, its light like the brilliance of the sun at midday.\n\nThe qi of central harmony connects with the spleen, extending to the four seasons’ quarters before returning to *wu* and *ji*. Dwelling centrally in *chen* and *xu*, with *chou* and *wei* as its root, one who contemplates its meaning and follows its sequence shall cure illness. When the essence resembles the Yellow Dragon and this character is seen, disease vanishes, years increase fivefold, and people become filial and compliant. Ministers shall love their lords, and children their fathers.\n\nIn the lesser yin’s cycle, it joins with the essence of the teacher, the numinous fan exhaling qi. Its position belongs to *geng*, *xin*, *shen*, and *you*, where righteousness punishes the cunning and treacherous. Bandits shall not arise, and evil shall not harm people. When the kidneys’ abundant qi increases lifespan a hundredfold, utmost yin generates yang, and the state shall greatly prosper. Constantly contemplating it, one shall know no death.\n\nYin ascends and yang arises, thus the Dark Warrior marks the beginning. The Dragon’s virtue is born in the north yet resides in the east, thus it follows thereafter. The Vermilion Bird governs illness; the yellow qi stands at the center. When the ruler practices this, his lifespan shall be boundless. Ascending to hold balance, a hundred evils shall perish.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams reside within, spirits arrayed in ordered ranks. The White Tiger follows behind, punishing calamity and annihilating misfortune. The upright Dao arrives daily, and perverse qi vanishes. To contemplate essence without cease is the principle of extending years. If one embodies and internalizes it, what worry can there be?\n\nTo follow below what is above is called the Dao of compliance. Without fault or transgression, a myriad illnesses shall heal themselves. Reciting the characters and beholding their forms, love shall be as between father and son, bringing constant joy and boundless illumination.\n\nThose who examine and apply this shall see its effects immediately. Keep it always with the scripture, and daily wander with the spirits. The Dao follows nature, being profoundly empty and non-being. In a single day, it shall come of itself—this Dao is benevolent and good.\n\nChildren shall thereby be filial, ministers loyal and trustworthy. Those who understand it shall cherish their bodies, dare not speak recklessly, and by steadfastly guarding it, their lives shall know no end. The scripture does not emerge in vain; contemplate it in connection with the Dao. Deeply comprehend its meaning, and the spirits shall come of themselves.\n\nAt the outset, contemplate the form of the character and return to the primordial essence of the Dao. Attain spirit illumination, and nature shall be effortless. The Dao of Heaven is manifold, yet within humans it may be practiced. When the Dao accomplishes its work, how can one not refrain from wrongdoing? If people do not exert themselves, whence shall upright qi arise? To act without ascending is to daily invite good fortune and distance peril.\n\nWhen the great person practices this, the state shall know Great Peace. When the petty person practices it, calamity shall depart and blessings arrive. Contemplate its profound forms, and all pursuits shall be fulfilled. If children uphold the Dao, whence shall disorder arise?\n\nTo contemplate without cease is to attain Great Peace. With the heart undisturbed and no perverse inclinations, to guard it without cease is to daily renew life. The Dao does not emerge recklessly; it is entrusted to those with virtue and returns to its proper person.\n\n*Here ends the text on the Eight Trigrams’ Ascent to Peace and the Six Jia’s Pursuit of the Dao to Return Essence.*\n*Here ends the eighty-ninth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*The ninetieth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n**Remedy for Grievance, Disaster, and the Pursuit of Rare Methods, One Hundred Thirty-First**\n\nBefore the Perfected One, you study this. In all matters, accumulate knowledge, and you shall understand the great principles by which the world is ordered. Only then may you speak of affairs without doubt.\n\nNow, when common folk die, they cry out in great grievance, beating their breasts and calling to Heaven, casting themselves down to wail to Earth. Is this not perverse? One ought to refine the Dao with precision. Let this be recited and read for ten thousand generations as an enduring law, never to be forgotten.\n\nToday, the Celestial Master has issued stern teachings. How dare this foolish student not strive to speak a word?\n\nProceed without doubt. Yet death is a grave matter for mortals. To cry out in great grievance, beating the breast and casting oneself down, exhausting all strength in endless sorrow—this does no harm to life. But for whom should one grieve? And why grieve for all?\n\nWhen a person dies, they are utterly extinguished, reduced to ashes and dust, never to be seen again. Living between Heaven and Earth, from the time of their opening and division, each person has but one life, never to be reborn. Since the moment they were named \"human,\" they have been the foremost of all harmonious things, noble and honored, akin to Heaven and Earth. Yet with a single death, they vanish forever, through all time and space, never again to be called human, never again to rise and walk. Thus, they are mourned, and great grievance is expressed.\n\nAlas! Your words align with the vulgar, yet in truth, they are not so. This foolish student fails to grasp their meaning. What should one do when a person dies? I wish to hear it, only from the Celestial Master.\n\nNow, all things that live must come to an end. Human life, too, must end in death—this is the ordained pattern of Heaven and Earth. Yet within it, there are those who die in grievance, or who perish young before their time. Heaven and Earth, parents to all things, fear that some may die in grievance, weeping and wailing to Heaven above and knocking their heads upon the Earth below, lamenting their short years. Thus, Heaven has provided the true Dao and rare methods by which one may defend oneself and attain a modest longevity.\n\nAll living things naturally age and perish, yet foolish people refuse to diligently study the true Dao and virtuous methods. How can they slightly extend their years, delaying death and aging? Instead, they treat themselves lightly, neglecting to seek rare methods, and mock the true Dao. They turn to deception and falsehood, disrupting the Way of Heaven, deceiving their superiors, and competing to prepare burial mounds for death. They adorn and tend to these places in anticipation of death, making death pacts and inauspicious arrangements, seeking only to die. What is there to grieve?\n\nWhen one’s allotted years and fate are exhausted, it is like the sun rising and inevitably setting. Perfected One, why do you grieve for this?\n\nYour words, Perfected One, too often align with the vulgar, as if you know nothing of humanity. For whom, then, should one grieve? I wish to hear it.\n\nOne should grieve for those who die young, before they have gained any knowledge, before they have sought ways to defend themselves. Thus, they are to be grieved.\n\nOne should also grieve for those who are ever cautious and good, who fear dying young, who constantly discipline themselves, seeking the true Dao, virtuous power, and rare methods. They act with constant goodness, never harming in secret. Yet they may meet with disaster and die prematurely, or reach old age with strength exhausted, never having encountered an enlightened teacher, even for a moment, to fulfill their allotted years. These are the truly grievous cases, worthy of sorrow.\n\nBut those who grieve without cause, who do not seek rare methods or the true Dao yet die, and then beat their breasts, weep, and wail to Heaven and Earth—such people bring this upon themselves, blaming Heaven and Earth. They are rebellious people, deeply despised by Heaven.\n\nPerfected One, if you grieve for these, it would be better to mourn early for your own failure to learn the true Dao, for your ignorance of the great principles of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, and of the divisions of the world. Long have you suffered without an enlightened teacher, harboring sorrow as your allotted years draw to a close. This is truly lamentable. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed! This foolish student is deeply alarmed. My fate rests with the Celestial Master. I humbly beg the true Dao from you, that I may strive without ceasing. Why should the world lack it? It is only that one does not seek with sufficient diligence. If one’s sincerity moves Heaven to tears, then Heaven will not withhold it. If one does not slacken in the Dao, one shall obtain it before long. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nFoolish people do not cherish and love themselves. They do not seek rare and extraordinary methods that could grant them even a moment more of life. Instead, they prepare their funerary objects and burial places in advance, seeking death. The laws of Heaven are like those of a compassionate father, a wise mother, or a sagacious ruler—they do not deprive one of what may be sought.\n\nThis is the natural principle of seeking. If one attains what one seeks, there is no need for great grievance. Thus, the ancient sage-kings and emperors, who deeply cherished and feared death, thought day and night of seeking rare and extraordinary knowledge. They revered those who practiced the Dao, exhausting their wealth in the pursuit. Their sincerity moved the August Heaven to tears, and Heaven responded with auspicious signs. Masters of the Dao and its arts all came to their aid, enabling them to live long lives or even transcend the world.\n\nYet there were some who sought and did not obtain, for their sincerity was insufficient. They clung to worldly affairs, treating their lives lightly, believing they could be regained. Now, Heaven and Earth regard humans as their children, and emperors as the most honored of Heaven’s children. How could they not cherish the true Dao and rare methods?\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nThus, the ancient sages deeply contemplated and planned for the future. They knew that the wealth of the world is not permanently possessed. While one lives, wealth is merely entrusted to the body. When one dies, it passes to others. Therefore, there is nothing to cherish. They used their wealth to the utmost to seek the true Dao and extraordinary knowledge. Thus, their bodies endured, and their wealth remained, ever belonging to humanity.\n\nTherefore, one must exert utmost effort until wealth is entirely spent. Wealth is but a fleeting pursuit, obtained in an instant. To lose wealth is merely to return it to the world, for it was never truly one’s own to keep. This is what marks the wise and sagacious: they nurture the body with the Dao, understand the proper use of wealth, and thus attain long life. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. Those who would be teachers of others face many difficulties and reproaches. This Perfected One grows heavy-hearted, so let me further clarify for you and fully expound my meaning.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has its fixed principles, and it does not favor the familiar. If you wish to truly understand this, consider how after the winter solstice, the world grows bitterly cold and claims lives. Yet by the fifth month, the first signs of yin qi appear in the well’s clarity, growing stronger day by day. By the time the winter solstice arrives again, the cold becomes deadly, and one cannot survive without clothing. The wise prepare in advance and thus enjoy great joy, unharmed by the cold and free from worry. The indolent, however, who make no effort to prepare, suffer hunger and cold, falling into destitution. This is the way of things.\n\nHeaven is not at fault; it is people who bring this upon themselves. Do you now grasp this more deeply?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have awakened. The laws of Heaven do not favor the familiar on a whim; it is the foolish who recklessly provoke them. If I have not explained sufficiently, what then is the greatest grievance?\n\nThe greatest grievance is the great worthy. From youth, they study goodness, follow virtue, and possess true Dao and power. They should become the emperor’s assistants, aiding in the governance of yin and yang. If the emperor obtains such a one, he may embrace them with joy, ruling effortlessly and without care. But if such a person is obstructed and blocked, their true Dao and power persisting until old age and death, this is a grievous sorrow. Yet if the emperor fails to secure such great worthies and instead governs with the foolish, yin and yang fall into chaos, myriad calamities arise, and he toils day and night in suffering, consumed by great sorrow. This too is a profound grievance, a cause for deep lament.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, wise and far-reaching, ensured that all worthies emerged and gathered to assist above. Therefore, neither side suffered grievance. Heaven and Earth, too, were governed by them, free from affliction and sorrow—how much more so for humanity? Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nExcellent are the words of the Heavenly Master! In what way are they excellent?\n\nThis is what Heaven attains: the resolution of suffering and hardship. What the emperor attains: effortless rule without care. What the worthy attain: the full expression of their loyalty and sincerity, aiding their lord in governance, exhausting their abilities to diligently resolve the great concerns of Heaven and Earth. The myriad beings of the world also benefit and flourish. Thus, it is called excellent.\n\nExcellent are the words of the Perfected One; I have nothing to add.\n\nTherefore, all that people may seek to accomplish will not result in grievance if they attain it through their own conduct. What they seek but do not obtain becomes a great grievance. Now, if one seeks death, they obtain death; if one seeks evil, they obtain evil; if one seeks goodness, they obtain goodness. Heaven follows their heart—this is great fortune, for what is sought is attained. If one deliberately places themselves in mortal peril, making death pacts, they will indeed die. If one daily seeks misfortune, they will meet with evil and perish—this too is the case. In all false and mundane affairs, what one seeks is granted by Heaven and Earth; nothing is more grievous than this for such a person. Has the Perfected One also fully awakened to this?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have awakened. Now, I wish to thoroughly explain this for your benefit.\n\nI have already outlined the main principles for you. Reflect on their meaning and present them to the virtuous ruler of the highest Dao, showing them to all worthies. Let each exert effort in their pursuits. If they seek but do not obtain, it is because their sincerity is not yet complete.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like an echo and shadow—they do not deceive. It is the foolish who deceive themselves, belittling and neglecting their own lives. The greatest fault lies here. The multitude of fools together disrupt Heaven and Earth, not merely bringing sorrow upon themselves. Their transgressions are such that Heaven is deeply grieved.\n\nThe foolish bring this upon themselves, yet when they fall into destitution, they turn and wail to Heaven and Earth. Over time, this deeply troubles Heaven and Earth with sorrow. Thus, I have been sent down to fully explain and resolve the intentions of the world’s people, so that all worthies may clearly deliberate on my words. My words are the discourse of Heaven and Earth. I do not idly speak of these matters with the Perfected One; I convey the teachings and commands of Heaven. Let each recognize the source of their own faults and no longer blame one another.\n\nTherefore, I have spoken exhaustively. I dare not speak falsely. The reason I have spoken so thoroughly is that I alone understand the intentions of Heaven and Earth. Thus, I was sent down to discuss the world’s affairs with the Perfected One, distinguishing right from wrong, so that the virtuous ruler and the worthies may all reflect upon them. Let this be transmitted for ten thousand generations. May later generations chant and recite it as a constant law, never forgetting it.\n\nThus, whenever I see the Perfected One inquire about matters, I am always glad to resolve Heaven’s concerns, and each resolution eases its sorrow. Whenever I witness Heaven’s words, I immediately align with the intentions of Heaven and Earth, explaining and expounding them without the slightest negligence. If you have doubts, come again to discuss them. Since I have been entrusted with this mission and sent down to speak, I truly stand in awe of Heaven’s majesty and spare no effort.\n\nDo you now clearly understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have grasped the intentions of Heaven and Earth and should understand the affairs of life.\n\nPeople accumulate folly, failing to early study the true Dao, virtuous power, and extraordinary methods, dismissing them as trivial. They do not realize that their faults accumulate and disrupt Heaven and Earth, bringing sorrow to their emperor. Their lives are cut short by Heaven, and they do not live out their allotted years. Perfected One, ponder deeply my words. Is there any greater fault in the world than this death?\n\nExcellent, excellent! The foolish have now greatly awakened. If you awaken early, you may be called one who understands the affairs of life, avoiding misfortune and drawing near to good fortune.\n\nAwakening yet not ceasing—is the true Dao then complete?\n\nTo gain a king or marquis in a single day—is this not inferior to gaining an immortal?\n\nNow, encountering gold worth a thousand *jin* or jade discs by the myriad—is this not inferior to gaining an enlightened teacher?\n\nAn emperor may have countless foolish ministers—is this not inferior to gaining one greatly worthy and wise?\n\nParents may bear a hundred unworthy sons—is this not inferior to bearing one son who is worthy?\n\nIn a village of a hundred households, none study—is this not inferior to drawing near one of great virtue?\n\nTen thousand eyes strain in confusion—is this not inferior to grasping one great principle?\n\nAll under Heaven teems with chaos, possessing everything—is this not inferior to Heaven alone, divine and sagely, riding *qi* to soar and roam?\n\nThough the myriad things are abundant—are they not inferior to the single *qi* that alone enlivens humanity?\n\nThus, I now command the Perfected One among learners: swiftly cast aside superficial flourishes, devote yourself to essential matters, and seek the true Dao.\n\nDo you desire supreme fortune? Then truly emulate Heaven.\n\nHeaven and Earth, free of affliction, rejoice eternally—does the true Dao, with its wondrous and extraordinary methods, not emerge to protect humanity?\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity constantly emulated Heaven and dared not slacken; thus, they alone were perpetually fortunate.\n\nWhen worthy scholars gather their strategies, the Dao of Heaven is complete.\n\nEach speaks one good word, and yin and yang are ordered; the divine spirits rejoice.\n\nDisasters and harms all lie subdued, never to arise again.\n\nThis is called governing in accord with Heaven’s heart, and baneful ministers are eradicated.\n\nHow divine is the Dao! It is the art of spontaneity.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Foolish students formerly did not diligently inquire and thus had no means to know this.\n\nYet your words are correct.\n\nIf one studies yet does not diligently inquire, how can one make daily progress?\n\nIf one walks yet does not frequently move one’s feet, how can the Way be attained?\n\nIf one studies yet does not gain an enlightened teacher, how can knowledge be brought to fruition?\n\nIf one governs a state and desires joy and peace, yet does not employ the greatly worthy, how can order be achieved in a single day?\n\nExcellent are the Celestial Master’s words!\n\nYet you have now glimpsed their subtle meaning.\n\nThus, a city of gold with ninefold walls is not equal to serving one greatly worthy.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity all served enlightened teachers to resolve their cares and troubles.\n\nThus, sages and worthies all had teachers and methods.\n\nPerfected One, take heed: in all matters, cherish yourself. The gates of fortune and misfortune may be perceived.\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nAdmonish the Perfected One with one word.\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nWhat people seek and obtain, Heaven grants in accord with their seeking, never failing them. Do not wait until death’s approach to weep to Heaven and wail to Earth.\n\nThis is called seeking and obtaining for oneself, then turning to blame Heaven and Earth—this is called a person of great rebellion. Heaven does not favor them; Earth does not delight in them; ghosts and spirits will not protect them.\n\nThose who suffer injustice alone bear their injustice; those who seek yet do not obtain, do so in vain.\n\nAll things each obtain what they seek—why bring injustice upon oneself?\n\nPerfected One, ponder deeply my words: are they true or not?\n\nMy writings do not err; even in ten thousand words, not one is amiss.\n\nYet today, Heaven detests and swiftly punishes such errors, so I repeatedly expound upon them. Though I have spoken above, I again admonish the Perfected One below.\n\nThus, I deliberately cause these words to be repeated and rejoiced in, so that people of later ages may ponder them deeply, cherish them, transmit them, copy them, and show them to one another without concealing them.\n\nHeaven’s admonitory scriptures delight in being promulgated and do not wish to be hidden.\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed.\n\nTo the right is compiled a collection on whether the deceased encounter injustice, whether their desires are fulfilled or not, whether the state’s safety or peril aligns with their learning, and whether they meet an enlightened teacher or an unworthy one.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 90 concludes\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 91 begins\n\n**Collating the Three Ancient Textual Methods, Number One Hundred Thirty-Two**\n\nThis is the *Book of Questions to the Celestial Master*, which collates and examines the writings of sages and worthies from the opening of Heaven and Earth onward—texts such as the *River Chart*, the *Luo Script*, and divine writings—along with the words of common folk, even those of servants and slaves, and the distant utterances of barbarians. All receive their extraordinary sayings and unique strategies, uniting them into a single discourse to illuminate the Dao of Heaven.\n\nWas this not burdensome?\n\nNo.\n\nBecause distant matters were cumbersome and inaccessible, each was thus made to seek the abode of Great Peace within their own domain—within their respective towns and villages—so that those too far away to reach it themselves might be provided for. Therefore, abodes were established along the Way, allowing them to deposit unusual words, excellent and rare strategies, and singular methods within.\n\nThereupon, the central affairs were gathered and held, then delivered to the virtuous ruler above, commanding his assembled ministers to jointly assess and categorize them. The foremost and finest were selected, their heterodox words removed, to form the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*, named *The Governance of the Heavenly Utmost Cavern*. Thereafter, the afflictions of Heaven and Earth would be entirely dispelled; the governance of emperors and kings would attain singular great peace; and the accumulated calamities and hardships of ten thousand generations would be wholly eradicated.\n\nThen, the myriad things and host of spirits would have not a single grievance to speak of, and no longer would they report human transgressions to the heavens above.\n\nThus, the decree commanded those who would compile and collate them, for it was Heaven’s mandate that I speak below. Though the task be burdensome, how could one not exert every effort? The long-standing records of the world and the words of its people each spoke in part—some tenfold, some manifold—yet the doubts of all under Heaven would dissolve of themselves, and no great vexation would remain. Let each remain in their place and speak, then deliver their words upward. This is called gathering the long-accumulated sayings of the world into discourse, to penetrate the intent of Heaven and Earth, to circulate the qi of Heaven and Earth, to dispel the disasters afflicting emperors and kings, and to benefit the common people and the myriad things, so that none fail to find their proper place.\n\nThereafter, Heaven and Earth would be wholly and greatly pleased; their afflictions wholly dispelled, their joy would then protect the emperors and kings, allowing them to wander at leisure without care.\n\nI wish to ask: Why did Heaven and Earth at this time command the people of the world to jointly assemble their words and strategies, along with the writings of ancient and modern divine sages, to form the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*?\n\nExcellent is your question. Indeed, Heaven and Earth suffer from grievous disorder and illness, having never yet received proper governance. Thus, they instructed humanity to gather in counsel and together produce upright words and singular strategies to cure their afflictions. Therefore, they caused this great assembly of words and affairs.\n\nI humbly ask: If Heaven and Earth are in chaos and suffer grievous illness, why do they not instead bring forth a new sage?\n\nWhat use would it be to force the birth of a later sage? Alas, Perfected One, how foolish you are! I have heard this said before.\n\nThe lowly and benighted, born in darkness, accumulate folly and stubbornness, unable to perceive with clarity. Even you, Perfected One, speak thus—how then could the common people possibly understand? If they were to misplace my words and grow ever more resentful, celestial disasters and harms would arise all the greater, beyond all remedy. Thus, Heaven has caused you to ask these repeated questions. Do you wish me to speak at length and explain in full?\n\nVery well, very well. I have witnessed this commission firsthand, and for this matter I descended—dare I conceal or defy Heaven’s will in anger? Go now, Perfected One, listen closely. For you, I shall set forth the principles and resolve them, expounding fully from beginning to end. Simply sit at ease.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow then, the sages of past and present differ in excellence, each excelling in one domain. All speak the words of Heaven and Earth, yet their works vary widely. Thus, the many sages who have appeared before and after each act differently. All delight in aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth, casting off evil and bringing forth goodness, yet their words are not entirely the same—some align, some do not, though they resemble one another in broad strokes. Therefore, the multitude of sages cannot fully grasp the intent of Heaven and Earth, and so Heaven and Earth remain afflicted with grievous illness, not wholly cured. To bring forth another sage would only repeat this cycle, leaving Heaven long disheartened. Thus, I was sent down to set forth these words and inform you, Perfected One. The reason I address you is this: among all the spirits above Heaven, only you, Perfected One, among those below, delight in goodness and seek to accord with Heaven’s heart. Therefore, I convey these words in earnest to you—I do not speak empty words. Do you understand this yourself?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGood, you have understood. Now, the reason for collating and comparing the divine writings of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and later antiquity is this: what the divine writings of high antiquity did not address, the divine writings of later antiquity may have spoken of. By arranging them according to kind, supplementing one another, they together form a single, excellent discourse. Thus, they are assembled, and only afterward can the intent of Heaven and Earth in the divine scriptures be discerned. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have understood.\n\nGo, what the sages of high antiquity lost, the sages of middle antiquity gained; what the sages of middle antiquity lost, the sages of later antiquity gained; what the sages of later antiquity lost, the sages of high antiquity gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse of the sages. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you may be said to have greatly understood.\n\nGo, what the great sages may have lost, the middle sages gained; what the middle sages lost, the lesser sages gained. Again arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse of the sages. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have understood.\n\nGo, what the greatly virtuous lost, the middling virtuous gained; what the middling virtuous lost, the lesser virtuous gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse of the virtuous. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have greatly understood.\n\nGo, what the emperors and kings lost, their ministers and sons gained; what the ministers and sons lost, the common people gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have greatly understood.\n\nGo, what the elders lost, the strong in their prime gained; what the strong in their prime lost, the young gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have understood.\n\nGo, what men lost, women gained; what women lost, slaves and barbarians gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have now known it.\n\nGo, what was lost in the literature of high antiquity, the literature of middle antiquity gained; what was lost in the literature of middle antiquity, the literature of low antiquity gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have greatly understood.\n\nGo, what the people of high antiquity lost, the people of middle antiquity gained; what the people of middle antiquity lost, the people of low antiquity gained. Arranged according to kind and supplementing one another, together they form a single, excellent discourse. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have understood.\n\nGo, sometimes the upper lost it while the lower gained it; sometimes the lower lost it while the upper gained it; sometimes both upper and lower lost it while the middle gained it; sometimes the middle lost it while both upper and lower gained it. Sometimes the celestial spirits’ writings lost it, yet the sagely writings gained it; sometimes the sagely writings lost it, yet the writings of the worthy gained it; sometimes the writings of the worthy lost it, yet the common people’s writings gained it; sometimes the common people’s writings lost it, yet the barbarians gained it. Sometimes the inner lost it, yet the outer gained it; sometimes the outer lost it, yet the inner gained it. Wherever there is loss, there is also gain.\n\nThus, from high and low, outer and inner, noble and base, distant and near, gather all their writings and essential sayings, collect their long and short passages, and arrange them by kind to supplement one another—then all is complete. Only then are the written records and spoken words wholly interconnected and fully possessed.\n\nDo you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have now known it.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to all things, to people, sages, worthies, and the myriad creatures—each has its strengths and weaknesses, each has what it lacks, each has what it loses. Thus, what they do and make differs, yet in their great essentials, all desire to attain the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth and find peace. At the time, each speaks of what it does as right, each takes its own as true, yet all stray from the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. Hence, there is always an excess of calamity and harm, now great, now small, flowing ceaselessly—this is the clear proof.\n\nThus arises the burden of inherited responsibility, and the suffering of later generations grows ever more severe.\n\nDo you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, you have now understood.\n\nThus, today Heaven has sent me down to re-examine the teachings of the scriptures for the Supreme Virtue Dao Lord, and I have assembled them all. From the words of divine texts and sagely worthies down to commoners, servants, and barbarians, I have classified them by category, gathering the good from their sayings to form the *Dongji* Scripture, named *The Writ of August Heaven’s Governance of the Utmost Extremity*. Thereafter, all the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be entirely eradicated.\n\nDo you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Go, Perfected One, you have now awakened to the arising of affairs and have known it.\n\nHeaven has granted you longevity and raised you to the rank of Supreme Perfected One.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nYou have attained this through your own conduct; it is not by my power. You have done good, unmatched under Heaven, and so Heaven cherishes you.\n\nI dare not, I dare not. This foolish one merely refrains from resenting Heaven—nothing more can be hoped for.\n\nIt is no deception.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI ask: in assembling these categories to follow one another, I wish to hear the essential meaning.\n\nGood indeed! Your question is profound—has Heaven moved your lips to ask it?\n\nVery well.\n\nSit at ease, and I will distinguish and explain it for you.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo—suppose we take the character *jia* as an example: it represents one matter. When presented before the assembly of wise and enlightened ones, it is fitting that all under Heaven’s written words and the sayings of the multitude be considered. Among these, there are flawless texts and flawless words. We take the best of these, those that harmonize with the hearts of the people, and gather the foremost explanations, verifying and illuminating them. What arises in accord with the people’s hearts is also in accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow is this made clear? I wish to hear the essential point.\n\nNow, when people act, if their conduct is examined in their own hearts and aligns with the hearts of the multitude of sages and worthies, and all call it good, then its response will immediately accord with the heart of Heaven. If, when examined in one’s own heart, there is doubt, and when examined in the hearts of the multitude of sages and worthies—down to the hearts of petty people—it is called wrong, then it is inauspicious. Heaven will indeed respond to it with misfortune. This is the clear proof.\n\nThus, we compile these sayings into a scripture: what harmonizes with the hearts of the people is right; what does not is wrong.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo—all written texts and affairs have their roots. We follow these roots, aligning them with the words of the multitude of scholars, and together we explain them in this way. What harmonizes with the intentions of the people’s hearts also harmonizes with the spirits; what does not harmonize with the people’s hearts does not harmonize with the spirits.\n\nExcellent, excellent! I have heard the command.\n\nPerfected One, why do you speak of having heard the command?\n\nWhen one acts with good and upright conduct, one gains the heart of Heaven and lives. When one acts wickedly and loses the heart of Heaven, misfortune and death follow. Life and death belong to the decree of fate—hence, I speak of having heard the command.\n\nExcellent! What the Perfected One says is true; I have nothing to add.\n\nThus, when Heaven rectifies one’s words and texts, there is good fortune; when it does not, there is misfortune. Therefore, I instruct the Perfected One to collate and examine them.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThereafter, the qi of the Great Peace and Supreme August One will arise, and longevity will come forth. Yet even the words of Heaven’s texts and sagely ones have their shortcomings. Thus, the qi of the Supreme August One has been imprisoned by perverse sayings and misleading words and has never been able to come forth.\n\nSince the later opening of Heaven and Earth, the qi of the Supreme August One has never come to assist the emperors and kings in their governance.\n\nToday, Heaven wishes to fully bring it forth, and so it collates and examines the written texts.\n\nFor every perverse word, there remains one ailment; for every perverse saying or misleading text, there remains one ailment. Ten perverse words leave ten ailments; a hundred leave a hundred; a thousand leave a thousand; ten thousand leave ten thousand. The ailments follow these remaining perverse words, perverse texts, and misleading sayings.\n\nHeaven is afflicted by these ailments, and so it causes people to be afflicted as well. When people are without ailment, Heaven is without ailment. When half the people are afflicted, half of Heaven is afflicted. When all people, great and small, are afflicted, Heaven is entirely afflicted.\n\nThus, when people are made to suffer ailments, it is to awaken them—but they do not awaken, and so countless deaths follow.\n\nI wish to hear: how do perverse words, perverse sayings, and perverse texts cause Heaven to be afflicted?\n\nAlas! Why have you again sunk into darkness and ignorance?\n\nGo, sit at ease, and I will explain it to you, Perfected One.\n\nWhen perverse words and perverse texts are used to expound the scriptures and the Dao, they disorder the scriptures of the Dao. When the scriptures of the Dao are disordered, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are disordered. When the patterns of Heaven and Earth are disordered, Heaven and Earth are afflicted.\n\nThus, the Three Luminaries, winds and rains, the four seasons, and the Five Phases contend without constancy. The year becomes inauspicious, and the emperor is beset with sorrow and hardship. The officials govern in chaos, and the people suffer resentment, hunger, and cold—is this not the affliction caused by perverse texts and perverse words? If widely employed, it leads to great disorder and ungovernability.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWhen perverse texts, perverse words, and misleading sayings are used to govern the state, day by day it falls into disorder. Thus, perverse words, perverse sayings, and misleading texts deceive the ears of all, and the state is thrown into chaos and peril. Ministers distort the law and act recklessly; the people are impoverished and destitute. Together, they pollute the governance of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe heavenly officials are enraged, and their teachings are never-ending. The people weep and cry out in grievance, and this too never ends.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWhen perverse words, perverse texts, and misleading sayings are used to govern the household, fathers and sons, husbands and wives fall into disorder, constantly hating and resenting one another, their quarrels and disputes never ceasing—thus it becomes a household of misfortune.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHow dreadful! Hearing the words of the Heavenly Master fills one with terror and alarm. I, foolish as I am, did not deeply consider this and did not realize that such evil brings about these consequences. Truly, I have been ignorant for far too long. The common people regard it as a trivial matter and do not remove it, yet they do not know that these perverse words, perverse sayings, and perverse texts are the great enemies of Heaven and Earth, the great thieves of the state, and the fierce ghosts of the hundred clans. How can they not be entirely cast aside and strenuously eliminated?\n\nThus, Heaven cherishes rulers of supreme virtue and, fearing they may not awaken, sends down these great calamities. Therefore, I have been sent to explain this in full. True One, swiftly commit these words to writing and disseminate them, so that they may urgently ponder the will of Heaven and thereby secure their own peace. Otherwise, Heaven’s wrath will never cease.\n\nHence, Heaven no longer relies solely on the words of sages, for they alone cannot entirely eradicate this affliction. Therefore, it commands the people of the world to speak with one voice and collectively examine the ancient texts. Now, Heaven’s indignation and accumulated resentment are directed at these perverse words, perverse texts, and the solitary, flattering, and deceptive sayings.\n\nIf you, True One, wish to understand this, consider how when the emperor is enraged and the barbarians repeatedly harm the people, he dispatches millions of soldiers to strike them—this is not done out of mere anger. The greater the anger, the greater the rewards for merit. If the emperor is not enraged, he will once more investigate. Now, Heaven investigates perverse texts in this same manner.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHow fearful! The world is now set right. You, True One, may be said to have understood.\n\nNow, these solitary sayings—when even a single person utters perverse words, perverse texts, or perverse sayings—Heaven and Earth regard them as a great enemy, the great thieves of the emperor. The foundation of governance is unsettled, and all falls into chaos thereby.\n\nTherefore, now sever them entirely. Let all gather their words, gather their sayings, and submit their writings to determine matters of peace and stability. Then, the qi of Heaven will daily and entirely find its proper place, and perverse words, perverse sayings will daily and entirely be cut off and extinguished. From this day forward, Heaven will command people to investigate them, and the spirits will also proceed to investigate them. There will be no day of respite, no moment of slackening.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe foolish one is deeply troubled. Since you understand, there should be no need for further examination together. Yes, yes.\n\nThe foolish one falls short in every matter, bearing grave transgressions before Heaven and Earth, causing the Heavenly Master concern. Having now witnessed these perverse texts and perverse sayings—the warnings of even a single person—I wish to receive your stern admonitions once more, to the utmost clarity of true scripture’s deepest cautions.\n\nExcellent. The written word has already been compared to speech. Why do you still question this yourself?\n\nThe benighted, their hearts bound fast, even the wise cannot fathom. Without repeated clarification and stern instruction, they remain shrouded in darkness, confounding the Heavenly Master’s Dao. Thus, I dare not but ask again.\n\nExcellent are your words. Very well. Be seated, and I shall explain fully for all the assembled Perfected Ones.\n\nTrue speech, true texts, true sayings—these are the root of the proper ordering of Heaven and Earth, the treasured vessel and parents of the state’s peace, the very mandate by which all people and the myriad things receive their lives. Therefore, one must strive with all one’s strength to set them right.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI wish to hear how true speech, true texts, and true sayings serve as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel, and the decisive mandate for all people and the myriad things.\n\nAh! Perfected One, you have heard these words time and again. In my writings, all is afflicted by the sickness of frivolous and perverse speech. Why do you now question this again?\n\nThe foolish one follows the common ways, mired in ignorance for so long that I know not where perversity ends. Without repeated, clear admonitions, I remain utterly lost.\n\nIf you truly wish to know the truth of this: when common people all speak of goodness and strive together to practice it, yet disasters are not averted, it is because perverse texts and perverse speech have caused the chaos. When common people say, “This will suffice,” yet cannot achieve goodness, but by adhering to it, they instead align with Heaven, and disasters daily recede—this is the work of true texts, true speech, and true sayings. Inwardly, they alone resonate with Heaven, bearing the clear proof of Heaven and Earth’s intent.\n\nThus, true speech and true texts reveal the very heart of the proper ordering of Heaven and Earth. When all speech is true, all texts are true, all sayings are true, and the emperor enacts them, extending to the humblest people—none fail to delight in practicing what is right. Heaven and Earth are thereby greatly set right. The four seasons, the five phases, and the myriad things—all at once find their proper place. Sun, moon, and the three luminaries keep to their courses, each attaining its proper measure. The state enjoys great peace without care, and even the spirits bestow the elixir of agelessness, while wondrous signs and good omens all emerge. Treachery, deceit, and malevolent omens all perish utterly. The common people each secure their households and fulfill their natural lifespans. The myriad things all attain long life and completion, each in its proper season.\n\nThis is the manifest efficacy of true speech, true texts, and true sayings—as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel, the parents of the people, the mandate of the myriad things. Do you understand, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHow wondrous! How wondrous indeed!\nThe root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel—its mandate rests here.\n\nPerfected One, you may be called one who understands the workings of life, for you have grasped this truth. Therefore, Heaven sent me down to thoroughly examine and rectify it.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who practice the true Way, speak true words, and compose true texts—Heaven and Earth have ever rejoiced in them greatly, and thus they are ever blessed with good fortune. Those who practice the perverse, speak perverse words, and compose perverse texts—Heaven and Earth have ever been enraged and displeased by them, and thus they are ever beset by misfortune, peril, and ruin.\n\nThe common people do not recognize this as the great affliction of Heaven and Earth, the disorder of the emperor’s governance. Yet the most benighted scholars, in their cunning, compose writings below, propagating perverse words and perverse texts, vying to outdo one another, deceiving their superiors, defiling Heaven’s true Dharma, and disrupting Heaven’s true rites. This is the great resentment of Heaven, the great fault of Earth, and the great treachery against the state.\n\nNow, having incurred the resentment of Heaven, the fault of Earth, and the treachery against the state, they yet persist in such deeds daily—how could governance ever be at peace? Today, the Celestial Master condemns these perverse words and perverse texts—how severe is their single transgression!\n\nAlas, Perfected One, are you not foolish?\nWhen people together propagate perverse words and perverse texts, jointly disordering Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth are thus ever afflicted—is this not the resentment of Heaven and the fault of Earth? It is like one who constantly harms others—would others not resent and fault them?\n\nYes, yes.\nThus, the resentment of Heaven and the fault of Earth are made clear.\n\nNow, perverse words, perverse texts, and perverse sayings have already deceived their superiors and endangered the state. Their governance constantly loses the favor of Heaven, their years and lifespans do not increase, and those who bring about their ruin are many, not merely one or two—is this not the great disgrace of the state?\n\nDo you, all Perfected Ones, understand this?\nYes, yes.\n\nPeople of later ages are often foolish. Some, upon seeing celestial patterns, speak contrary to these words—this is nothing less than the chief of state traitors, the great resentment of Heaven and fault of Earth, the great harm to the people, and the baleful spirits of the myriad things.\n\nVirtuous ruler, be cautious and never heed such words. Those who follow them incur Heaven’s resentment and deviate from the true Way. You must deeply consider the long term, ponder their calamities and harms, to secure lasting peace for yourself.\n\nHeaven has uniquely favored the virtuous ruler, thus crafting these teachings—so that you may secure yourself and protect the state.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nYes, yes.\n\nProceed, for you have now greatly awakened.\nBe vigilant, be vigilant—Heaven’s majesty must not be transgressed.\nYes, yes.\n\nLet this warning be heeded by all Perfected Ones: from this point onward, the virtuous ruler must carefully examine and ponder the celestial teachings and celestial patterns. When petitions from the three ranks of officials and commoners converge in memorials, by the eighth month, gather and review them, then divide and assign them into three sections.\n\nThe first review shall take place to the ruler’s east, where one copy is made. It shall then be passed for a second review to the ruler’s south, and a third copy made. From there, it shall be passed for a third review to the ruler’s west, where the third copy is made. After the third review, the documents shall be discarded to the ruler’s north.\n\nEach review takes place in a separate location, and they must not coincide in time. Why is this?\nWe wish to hear the reason.\nIndeed, if they were to observe one another, deceit might arise—some may conceal flaws or fabricate falsehoods, thus repeating the same deception. This would once more incur the resentment of Heaven and Earth, becoming the state’s greatest traitor.\n\nHeaven and Earth detest such men, yet they employ emperors and kings to govern disorder. Therefore, they separate the reviews into three distinct places, ensuring that the three reviews collectively verify the truth. This is to resolve Heaven’s intent and secure the governance of the kingly ruler.\n\nWhy must the first review begin to the ruler’s east?\nThe east is where Heaven’s qi holds intention and benevolence. Those who review the source of affairs must apply careful thought, diligent effort, and benevolence to align with Heaven and Earth, ever mindful of bringing peace to the emperor and king. Thus, the review begins in the east.\n\nBenevolence is to be enacted, and so one must scrutinize clearly—hence the transmission to the ruler’s south. After clear scrutiny, one must judge and eliminate with righteousness. Those with merit shall have their merits recorded; those without merit shall have their lack of merit recorded, forming the basis of their conduct.\n\nThe final records shall be stored in the ruler’s north, placed in a secluded chamber. Thus, the conduct of all under Heaven is known, and the distinction between good and evil is never lost.\n\nTherefore, when the virtuous ruler acts accordingly, he is called a great divine person, fully seated in knowledge of the hearts of all under Heaven and all changes and movements of anomalies.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nHow profound! How profound!\nYou who know reverence for Heaven’s discourse shall long endure.\n\n\"Yes, yes. From this point onward, local officials no longer need to report conduct records—conduct is now manifest in these records, and they shall serve as the basis for all accounts. Thus, the virtuous ruler may rest his head upon his pillow in peace, without worry. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. The Celestial Mandate commands the verification of documents: should one matter be omitted, thirty lashes shall be administered; for ten matters, three hundred lashes; for a hundred matters, three thousand. The virtuous ruler shall dismiss such a person, barring them from office forever. This individual treats affairs with reckless disregard—such is the resentment of Heaven and the blame of Earth, the great traitor to the state. Resentment and treachery cannot long be tolerated; they will surely provoke Heaven and Earth, and so must be swiftly removed.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Excellent! Let this be the great admonition to the Perfected One: my written Dao is that which flows from above to below without end. Those who cherish upright speech, upright words, and upright texts—I shall receive the profound charge of Heaven and descend. Truly, I know Heaven cherishes upright speech, upright words, and upright texts, and thus detests with great urgency perverse speech, perverse words, and perverse texts. Heaven and Earth know well their deep resentment, and by this charge they send me down to verify, to expel this resentment and treachery, to pacify the state of virtue and power, and to dissolve the accumulated karmic retributions since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Thus, all harm shall depart and rest be attained, allowing the upright qi to advance and govern fully. Only then shall the six directions, the eight distant realms, and the level qi of August Heaven all arrive in a single moment. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. Therefore, my texts are the pure words of Heaven, never deviating from their singular allotment. Heaven detests perverse texts, and so I detest them; Heaven cherishes upright texts, and so I cherish them. Thus, in my practice of the Dao, I wholly uphold the root and guard the center, casting aside the branches. Heaven upholds the root, and so I uphold the root; Heaven guards the center, and so I guard the center; Heaven casts aside the branches, and so I cast aside the branches.\n\nMy texts are thus of one body with Heaven and Earth, one heart and one intent, one allotment and one principle, one love and one hate, one Dao and one path. Therefore, when a virtuous ruler applies them, there is not a single error. For ten thousand myriad years they cannot be abandoned—there is only the bright illumination of the sun, never a time of darkness; only the order of the sun, never a time of chaos; only the goodness of the sun, never a time of evil; only the fortune of the sun, never a time of misfortune. Thus, it is called the Perfectly Penetrating Upright Dao of Heaven, embracing the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who attain its highest secret may enjoy long life; those who attain its middle secret become pillars of the state; those who attain its lowest secret may always dwell in peace. Go now—my words are briefly concluded. If you have doubts, return again to ask.\"\n\n\"May I ask: if one inadvertently omits or errs in a matter, should they receive thirty strokes of the rod as proper punishment?\"\n\nExcellent is your question. Did Heaven prompt your words?\n\nIndeed, numbers begin with one and conclude at ten. This error of omission in one matter thus concerns the very root of the question of one. Omission and error, if not truthful, become deceit—then they become Heaven’s resentment and Earth’s reproach, the great thieves of the state.\n\nTen strokes are to make amends to Earth; ten strokes are to make amends to the Emperor and the Kings. Heaven, Earth, and humanity each receive ten, totaling thirty. These strokes serve to atone for the transgression, to dissolve Heaven’s resentment and Earth’s reproach, and to absolve the offense against the Emperor and the Kings. Thus, Heaven and Earth rejoice, and the spirits and deities cease their wrath.\n\nThe reason Heaven and Earth are often in turmoil and the spirits and deities grow wrathful lies fundamentally in the failure to verify documents and the prevalence of careless, erroneous speech among people—hence the arising of these calamities and the burden of inherited misfortune. If such carelessness persists, then punishment by the rod is warranted, not because of personal favor, but to rectify the matter.\n\nNow, having convened to deliberate, if the facts are thoroughly examined and the upper record is confirmed, it shall be marked as correct above. If the lower record is likewise confirmed, it shall be marked as correct below. Thus, both upper and lower are deemed true. If only the lower is confirmed while the upper remains unverified, it is of no benefit. If only the upper is confirmed while the lower remains unverified, it is likewise of no benefit. Only when both upper and lower are verified is Heaven’s qi balanced.\n\nIf the lower is true but the upper is not, the upper wrongs the lower, and the lower, though innocent, finds its efforts toward goodness futile—Heaven’s wrath arises again. If the upper is true but the lower is not, the lower wrongs the upper—Earth’s wrath arises again. Only when both upper and lower are entirely verified, yet the Emperor and the Kings fail to govern with impartiality, do the spirits of the four seasons, five phases, six relations, and the qi of the six ancestral temples grow restless, and inharmonious qi stirs once more.\n\nEven if one strives to circulate documents through the three Dao, rectifying the words and writings of the world, if one does not govern with diligence, such efforts are in vain. Therefore, I, in accordance with the heart of Heaven, enact transformation for the August Virtuous Ruler, daring not to lose Heaven’s intent. Thus, I fully adhere to Heaven’s law, taking the images of Heaven and Earth as the warp, following the yang as the standard, and aligning with the four seasons and five phases as the ordinance—unchanging for ten thousand generations.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed.\n\nThis humble student has awakened with reverence and holds Heaven’s law in great awe.\n\nKnowing such awe, you are already destined for great fortune. This is a crucial admonition for the Perfected One.\n\nRegarding the method of verifying documents: do not merely speak of their divine script, but examine their written content. If one asserts that such-and-such is true, this is called \"deaf script.\" Does speech alone lack a foundation? How can one claim thus?\"\n\nDo not forbid their existence. Rather, inquire into the meaning of their words—only when you grasp their intent can matters be made clear. If one does not explain the meaning, how can understanding be attained? Thus, one must ask for the resolution of their intent; otherwise, they cannot be employed—this is called \"deaf governance.\"\n\nDo you wish to delight in knowing their intent? It is like human speech, which must have a foundation, a source from which it arises. One cannot merely say, \"Eastern Lord so-and-so spoke thus to establish matters.\" Those who verify and establish matters all have a basis—how can they idly fabricate empty words? Therefore, in all matters, one must rely on actual evidence to establish them.\n\nDo you wish to know their great efficacy and clear proof? Consider how I, for the Virtuous Ruler, established transformative laws—all were tested and found responsive, serving as proof of their words. If enacted and unresponsive, they are false words; if enacted and unresponsive, they are contrary to Heaven. Truly, written words and speech are like this—how can one idly establish proof and speak without explanation?\n\nFoolish people may stubbornly cling, asking, \"Why are the divine scriptures and words like this?\" They are merely words to resolve difficulties and rebut exhaustion. What grandeur do divine scriptures possess? They may have intent, but merely transmitting their words does not reside in a single volume. Transmitted alone, explained from afar, people do not deeply grasp their essential meaning, instead using them only to rebut difficulties and rescue exhaustion, saying, \"Eastern Lord spoke thus for so long,\" to justify themselves—this is truly not so. All have lost the meaning of the explanation.\n\nThus, the words of the Dao and virtue cannot be thoroughly understood—all because of this. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed.\n\nThis humble student has awakened with reverence.\n\nYet if you had not awakened thus, you would remain deluded. Therefore, when examining my writings, scrutinizing texts and human words, always inquire into their intent. How can one grasp their explanations? By gathering them according to their kind. Only then, when all under Heaven’s texts and words are thoroughly investigated, can the laws of Heaven’s Dao be perceived, and the words of good and evil be understood.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Proceed—my Dao is revealed herein. Perfected One, reflect upon this from beginning to end, mutually verifying and clarifying, and nothing will remain unresolved. All matters under Heaven will be complete, the Great Dao attained, Heaven and Earth pleased, and the Virtuous Ruler eternally secure. All under Heaven will speak with one voice, saying, \"Excellent!\" No longer will they speak of Heaven’s governance, for they will have regained the intent of Heaven and Earth—thus, it is called peace. When all matters align with the hearts of ordinary people, all under Heaven will have nothing more to say.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed.\n\nIf, in practice, minor discrepancies or doubts arise, return to ask again.\n\nIndeed.\n\nHere ends the *Wondrous Scripture on Establishing the Utmost Extreme of Heaven’s Resentment, Earth’s Blame, and the Nation’s Calamity*, *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Ninety-One.\n*The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Ninety-Two.\n\n**The Three Luminaries’ Eclipses: Scroll One Hundred Thirty-Three**\n\nSomeone asked: Why do the Three Luminaries of Heaven sometimes suffer eclipses?\n\nExcellent, this question of yours. These are the great resentments of Heaven and Earth—when Heaven and Earth engage in unseen struggle, their signs manifest in the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, eclipses may occur, or they may not; the fault lies in the clash of yin and yang qi.\n\nWhy do they clash?\n\nYin and yang deceive each other, vying for dominance. By nature, yin and yang should alternately aid and protect one another, together forming harmonious qi. Yet they turn to struggle—all fault lies in this disharmony.\n\nIf they were harmonious, would there be no eclipses?\n\nIndeed. In the most virtuous eras of remote antiquity, eclipses never occurred. But as later generations increasingly lost the intent of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang gradually ceased to cherish one another, leading to their struggle.\n\nIf you doubt my words, let the Virtuous Ruler examine and practice my teachings. When their full meaning is grasped, the struggle will cease; when partially understood, it will partially cease; when half-grasped, it will half cease. Without diligent practice, the distress will persist.\n\nSomeone asked: When do the sun and moon eclipse—what celestial movements cause their convergence?\n\nAlas, how foolish you are! Perfected One, you risk provoking Heaven’s wrath again. How do you presume to know of \"celestial movements\"?\n\nThis foolish student observes their conjunction.\n\nHow profoundly benighted your mind is—how utterly dark! If we follow your reasoning, it is merely a matter of celestial movements converging.\n\nThen why, within a single year, do the sun and moon eclipse without respite? Or why, for years on end, do they not eclipse at all? How do celestial movements explain this? When the Emperor’s virtue flourishes, the sun and moon do not eclipse, and the stars do not fall into disorder—how do celestial movements account for this?\n\nMoreover, yin and yang naturally coexist and should cherish one another—why do they harm each other instead? By nature, they should alternately generate and complete one another—why do they turn to mutual destruction?\n\nYou are truly foolish. If you wish to know the truth, consider the analogy of people. When those who have long been close meet after a long separation, their joy is boundless—they aid, benefit, praise, and honor one another. But when those who have never been close suddenly meet, they fight at once. If the enmity is great, they fight to the death; if slight, they brawl briefly.\n\nHow terrifying! How terrifying!\n\nThis foolish student now understands.\n\nPray, I ask: the sun is the essence of fire, belonging to yang, while the moon is the essence of water, belonging to yin. Now, water and fire do not share the same dwelling—when they meet by chance, they extinguish each other. What does this mean? Are they not akin?\n\nExcellent! Your words grasp the intent. Yet water and fire, each following their own Dao and abiding by their course, may harmonize and together establish merit and accomplish deeds—just as the Five Phases cannot lack a single one, for they alternately generate and complete one another. If you wish to know the truth of this, consider the Five Viscera dwelling together within the human abdomen. The heart is fire, the kidneys are water—how could they share the same place yet daily engage in battle and mutual consumption? Do you now understand or not?\n\nIndeed, indeed. This foolish student has awakened.\n\nThus, when the qi of harmony arrives, the Three Luminaries no longer contend or eclipse. Only when the Three Luminaries do not consume one another can one begin to speak of attaining the heart of Heaven and Earth—this serves as proof. Therefore, if you wish to know your own excellence or deficiency and practice the Dao and virtue, yet fail to observe this celestial evidence, gathering instead a multitude of texts that speak of mutual consumption in shared dwelling—such works merely record the words of mutual affection without deeply grasping their meaning. Even if divine texts exist, Heaven has not yet fully revealed their true essence. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. Go forth—you have awakened. After my text is revealed, may virtuous emperors and kings ponder this celestial intent and never forget these words, for they are the means to attain the heart of Heaven. If one aligns with the intent of Heaven, one’s mandate will be long and whole. If one fails to align with Heaven’s intent, the Gate of Mandate falls into chaos. To act without accord with the heart of Heaven is also a great calamity. From the earliest antiquity, the sagely emperors and kings have taken this as their warning, deeply inscribing my words within their hearts, so that subtle words may be seen and the Dao attained. I entrust this to the most virtuous of rulers, to save the Three Luminaries from their battles and eclipses.\n\nIndeed, indeed. Go now. This minor discourse is complete; if doubts remain, return to ask again.\n\n**Secret of the Primordial Fire and Primordial Qi of the Twelve Thousand States, One Hundred Thirty-Fourth**\n\nPray, I ask: the world shares the same sun and moon, the same Dipper and Pole Star. One great division comprises twelve thousand states, the central division eighty-one domains, further divided into smaller parts, each a single state. Those of superior virtue expand their territory to twelve thousand *li*; next, ten thousand *li*; then nine thousand, eight thousand, seven thousand, six thousand, five thousand, four thousand, three thousand, two thousand, and one thousand *li*. Then five hundred *li*, then one hundred *li*. These mark the lands of middling virtue, where excellence and deficiency manifest in their expansion and preservation. Those of inferior virtue may possess not a single level plot of land, all plagued by afflictions and transformations, causing the sun and moon of a single state to contend and eclipse. Among the twelve thousand states, are they all eclipsed? When the Dipper and Pole Star dim, do all twelve thousand states likewise dim?\n\nExcellent, profound, distant, and subtle—such is your question! Why do you ask specifically about this transformation? If one state experiences change, why should the twelve thousand states all be praised, yet some still undergo transformation? I feared that without the Celestial Master’s inquiry, this would remain unknown through all ages—thus I ask.\n\nExcellent! Your doubt truly enters the Dao. When one state undergoes change, only that state’s sun dims, called an eclipse. Neighboring states may witness it from afar, but distant states remain uneclipsed. When the Dipper and all stars dim, only those that have lost Heaven’s intent grow dim, while distant ones remain uneclipsed. Now I ask: what barrier obscures them, causing them alone to dim?\n\nAlas, you remain as an unopened child, like the common folk! Consider this: Heaven and Earth are vastly distant. In a state that has lost the Dao and lacks virtue, perverse qi rises to obscure and veil the heavens. The Three Luminaries, each following their kind upward, are thus dimmed. It is like a place shrouded in mist—there, the Three Luminaries alone grow dim, while mistless places remain brightly lit. If you wish to know further, consider how in yin places only the moon’s eclipse is unseen, while in yang places only the sun’s eclipse is seen. If you wish to know the truth of this, consider this year when Jupiter resides in *Zi*: virtuous states alone enjoy prosperity, while virtueless states suffer calamity. Though they share the same state and the same year, their fortune and misfortune differ—just as people share the same Heaven and Earth, yet their peace or peril, customs and conditions, vary. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nNow, the sun and moon course and shine upon the twelve thousand states alike, yet their brightness or dimness differs—this lies in the differing conditions of each place. In states governed by the Dao and virtue, their rule is pure and clear, tranquil and free of perversion; thus their Three Luminaries alone shine brightly, for the perverse yin qi below cannot rise to veil them. Where they are dim, the fault lies below: the people collectively deceive those above, and perverse qi together ascends to obscure what is above.\n\nIn states without the Dao, their rule is filthy and turbid, rife with treachery and deceit, self-shrouded and self-concealed—thus their Three Luminaries grow dim. If you wish to know this truth more deeply, consider how it is like squinting at the sun versus gazing at it with eyes wide open; or like gazing at the sun with eyes fully open versus peering at it through a thin veil of silk—this is precisely the case. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHow astonishing, how astonishing! If you grasp this astonishment, you shall attain long life.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nAs for those states doomed to misfortune and decline, their Three Luminaries are utterly dimmed. It is like a blind man who alone cannot behold the brightness of the Three Luminaries—the Three Luminaries remain as they are, yet the blind man alone fails to see them. It is like one in the prime of life who alone perceives the brightness of the Three Luminaries, while the aged alone cannot perceive their brightness—this is the effect of their flourishing or decline. Do you fully understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth now.\n\nMay I ask: what is the single, absolute teaching? And what, precisely, is this \"One\" that we do not yet clearly understand?\n\nAh! A true person clings to texts in excess—why then do you doubt this? Now you are lost in darkness. If you grasp the guarding of the One, all matters are complete—why do you still ask such trifling questions? You ought to ponder these words.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe One is the heart, the mind, the will. It is the spirit dwelling within this body. All affairs under heaven are accomplished through it. From ancient times to the present, the transformations of the worthy and the sagely have all been shaped by this, for they early understood and studied the heart and mind, directing their will toward goodness and preserving virtuous deeds. Fools bring only misfortune upon themselves, for they learn and cling to evil deeds.\n\nThe nature of heaven and earth is such that all creatures that crawl and move are thus—therefore, through the teachings of a master, longevity may be attained. What Dao is there to study? Heaven and earth may be grasped. Gathering a multitude of millions is not equal to serving a single worthy person. A multitude of fools, in their millions, can only hasten ruin and defeat.\n\nIf you truly guard the body of a single worthy one, what harm can befall you? If you cannot turn back and reflect upon yourself, seeing your thoughts as if gazing into a mirror, then your will directed afar brings illness to the body, withering and decay in all affairs. But if your will is near, the body retains its luster.\n\nAll things are accomplished through the will and its intentions—if you do not prepare and remember them, then all affairs under heaven are just so. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nPray, I ask: when drought and frost cause all to perish, when the people suffer from hunger and cold, perishing in agony—what is this slaying? This is the slaying of August Heaven and the Great Yang, for the Six Yangs are all resentful and thus able to bring harm.\n\nWhat does this mean? I wish to hear it.\n\nIndeed, when the Six Myriads reach their utmost extreme, their great rigidity all resents humanity’s prolonged disorder and evil, hence the killing. How does this harm people?\n\nIt has no name. It merely encounters the extreme of inherited burdens, when Heaven’s wrath erupts, making no distinction between the good and evil of people—those who encounter it meet great misfortune.\n\nDo you wish to know the truth of it? Compare it to a man: when a man is seized by great rage, he may vent his fury upon a good person, not sparing them, but instead harming others at random. Now, what fault have those others committed? Yet they encounter his outburst. Heaven’s wrath erupts in the same way.\n\nThus, the responsibility of inherited burdens is most severe, causing people to die without distinction between good and evil. The great fault lies here.\n\nTherefore, my scripture follows Heaven’s teaching, now seeking to decisively sever the burden of inherited responsibility. Heaven’s transgressions run deep and heavy, harming many innocent people—Heaven sorely laments this. Thus, it commands me to instruct the Perfected Ones, entrusting this scripture to a ruler of supreme virtue, that wicked, deceitful, and false people may be cut off, and Heaven’s Dao made upright.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly inquire: since the opening of Heaven and Earth, why have people perished entirely from raging epidemics, or been utterly destroyed by floods, or annihilated by warfare? What transgressions have they committed to deserve such fates? Are these merely the conjunctions of Heaven and Earth? Or are they the calamities of inherited burdens?\n\nYet in ancient and modern texts, many explain these as the meetings of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang—this is incorrect. All such disasters are the calamities of inherited burdens.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi is in harmony, but its anger arises, and the spirits engage in battle, those who die from raging epidemics are struck down by Heaven’s punishment. Those who perish in floods are struck down by Earth’s punishment. Those who die by warfare are struck down by human punishment.\n\nI wish to understand: why are those who die from raging epidemics killed by Heaven? Heaven governs the spirits and presides over the chiefs of the divine. Thus, it commands the spirits and ghosts to slay people. Earth is the humble aspect of yin, and water is the most intense aspect of yin. That which belongs to Earth’s yin governs the gestation of all things. When gestation is harmed, it must become blood—blood being of the same kind as water. When gestation is harmed, it inevitably stirs anger and displeasure, further spreading its polluted blood to injure others.\n\nWater is the blood and veins of Earth, the yin of Earth. When yin is humbled and enraged, it must engage in battle to kill people. This is like a minister who goes forth to capture bandits, necessarily acting with his own body to apprehend them. He cannot remain like a lord, merely speaking from his place.\n\nThe harmonious is humanity, which governs the four seasons and the five phases in shared rule. People should act in harmony and accord, but when they lose the Dao and fail to follow it, their anger arises. Thus, the qi of the four seasons rebels, and the five phases engage in battle, causing people to attack one another. All this stems from Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi growing angry and displeased, accumulating illness and distress over time, leading to these outcomes.\n\nExcellent! Had you not pressed with such forceful inquiry, there would be no way to know this. I wish to understand: if these are all calamities of inherited burdens, arising from the anger of the three qi, then in times without inherited burdens, how do people die?\n\nPeople are born with a natural end; the high, the low, and the middling each fulfill their allotted years. Some attain the true Dao and thereby transcend the world—such people bear no fault of inherited burdens, for this is the natural way.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\n\"Go forth, do you understand? Those who die suddenly in groups—none of this is fate. It is the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi, the four seasons, and the five phases waging war in wrathful suppression and slaughter. Excellent, excellent! Had you not inquired of the Heavenly Master, there would be no way to know this. Thus, since the opening of Heaven and Earth, such calamities have always existed, yet people remain unaware of them. Now, deeply grieved and anxious over this, seeing many die without guilt, the Supreme moved Heaven, and Heaven thus sent me down to explain it fully. After my celestial texts have been enacted, people and all things will each die according to their allotted lifespan, with no more mass deaths. Excellent, excellent! Future generations will each fulfill their destiny—do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask: if death does not follow the cycles of Heaven’s Dao or the revolutions of time, why does disorder always arise at the junctures of Heaven and Earth? Do the five phases clash at their intersections? Do the divine sequences of the Five Emperors reach exhaustion and distress? Ah, excellent—your questioning is profound, Perfected One! Has Heaven now prompted your inquiry? Your words delve into celestial prophecy—what single essential truth lies here? I rejoice greatly in this. Now, if what you say is true, I shall provide a detailed explanation for you. All you Perfected Ones have come from afar to inquire on behalf of Heaven and Earth, to resolve doubts since the opening of Heaven and Earth and the reigns of emperors. You should sit in repose and listen to my words. Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow, the laws of Heaven and the destinies of people and all things...\"\n\nJust as the qi of the four seasons ought only to succeed one another in generation and transmission, passing along in turn. Just as in human life, the young will later grow old, alternating and passing along in succession. They ought not engage in Daoist strife and warfare, thereby extinguishing the generations of the world. The reason for Daoist warfare—where floods, droughts, epidemics, and death exhaust all—is that the lord of men, following the former kings and ancestors, gradually loses the mind and intent of the Dao. Over time, this accumulates until the juncture arrives, whereupon he fails to measure himself and thus perishes utterly, leaving no remnant kind. Now, the three norms of Heaven, Earth, and Man rely upon one another to stand and take form through mutual dependence. It is like a person having head, feet, belly, and body—if one norm is destroyed, the three norms all collapse in ruin. If a person lacks head, feet, or belly, and one part is lost, then all three are in peril. Thus, when the great Dao suffers great ruin, the three norms of Heaven and Earth perish, plunging all into darkness and confusion, and the myriad things thereby perish as well. Once things are exhausted, they cannot suddenly regenerate. From this, consider how much is lost, how much is extinguished—sometimes recovery comes swiftly, sometimes great ruin endures for a long time before restoration is possible. Thus, minor destruction allows for swift recovery.\n\nIf you wish to know this in greater certainty, so that virtuous lords of later generations may clearly perceive the great effects of Heaven and Earth’s grievances—it is like a household managing its livelihood. Those with abundant stores, though they encounter the misfortune of successive lean years, endure securely. A household with vast reserves, even if it suffers bad harvests for years on end, still survives. A household with modest stores, if it meets successive years of failure, starves to extinction. A perpetually impoverished household, if it meets a single bad year, perishes utterly, unable to measure itself and escape, thus trapped without posterity.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has its fixed laws; its revolutions are not mere junctures of chance. It is like summer and autumn, when one must exert effort to harvest, and winter and spring, when one must live on stored provisions. If summer and autumn do not diligently gather, winter and spring will bring starvation and extinction. The ancient sages, in their celestial writings, thus recorded these junctures. The Perfected One wishes to know it thus.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, it should remain perpetually balanced, and there ought to be no more junctures of death and extinction. Heaven commands the emperor to govern, and thus awakens the virtuous lord. All the people, in following the Dao and its affairs, must be made to glimpse and awaken to this truth. Had the former generations of common people constantly upheld the essential Dao and essential virtue, even if they encountered such junctures, they would not have perished. The method by which Heaven commands the emperor to govern the state is this: to possess virtue and power is the greatest wealth, while to lack virtue and power is the greatest poverty and distress. Those called \"without Dao and without virtue\" are those who cannot stabilize Heaven and Earth and thus lose them.\n\nThe former generations gradually abandoned and severed virtue and power, accumulating over time until they passed on their burdens to later generations. Those born afterward suffered their grievances, poisons, and calamities, all responding to governance without Dao. When the revolutions reached the point of extinction, they could not extricate themselves—the great fault lies here. Do you understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed. How dreadful! How dreadful!\n\nGo now, and I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another teaching.\n\nThe Dao and virtue are to humanity as the heart is to Heaven. Just as a person possesses a heart, if the human heart faithfully upholds the Dao, it will constantly dwell in fortune; if the human heart turns to evil and abandons the Dao, it will constantly decline into misfortune. When the spirit of the heart departs, death follows. Thus, when the essential Dao and virtue are severed, people perish, and Heaven and Earth likewise fall into chaos and ruin.\n\nTherefore, the Dao causes Heaven, Earth, and humanity to share the same concerns and the same affairs, enabling them to mutually generate and complete one another. If they do not share the same concerns and affairs, they will refuse to mutually generate and complete one another. They are bound together in mutual concern and mutual benefit, and thus the Dao and virtue link them, making their destinies one.\n\nFor this reason, when Heaven and Earth behold people practicing the Dao and virtue in goodness, they rejoice greatly; when they see people doing evil, they grow furious and indignant. Does the Perfected One understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed. How dreadful! This foolish one greatly fears it.\n\nIf you know to fear it, then you may attain long life without misfortune. If you do not know to fear it, then Heaven has already begun to turn away from you. You ought to be deeply cautious.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, and I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another explanation.\n\nThe course of fortune and misfortune may be likened to the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness on the one hand, and to punishments on the other. If people uphold the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness, then punishments will not arise. If they lose the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness, then punishments will emerge.\n\nThus, those who uphold the good Dao find the path of misfortune naturally severed; it departs without being taught to leave. Those who follow the path of misfortune find the way of speech naturally cut off. This is like the sun rising and the stars fleeing, or the stars appearing and the sun setting—without the slightest deviation.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow I reveal to the Perfected One a great esoteric teaching. The people of this age accumulate ignorance and darkness to an extreme degree, passing down warnings to one another that the cycles of time bring fortune and misfortune. If this is so, what benefit is there in doing good? What harm is there in doing evil? If the cycles of time are natural, what use is there in striving to do good?\n\nYet those who attain fortune are the sages who constantly align with the heart of Heaven, teaching people to do good—this is correct. Those who speak of cycles of time as reversing and thereby disrupting the Dao of Heaven utter words that cause Heaven and Earth to remain perpetually displeased. It is human conduct that brings this about, yet they blame the cycles of time for turning evil, refusing to acknowledge their own wrongdoing and instead accusing Heaven and Earth of being evil.\n\nThis is like a wicked and unfilial child in a household who refuses to admit his own faults and instead accuses his parents of being evil—this is precisely the case. Thus, Heaven is constantly afflicted, seething with anger and resentment. Because of this, the cycles of time bring about their destruction and conflict, delighting in the transformation of their kind.\n\nIf this were not so, the old would depart in their time, the young would grow, and each would reach the end of their allotted years and undergo transformation. This is like the changes in human form since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nExcellent! This foolish one has gained a great understanding: though the forms of people past and present differ, their *qi* remains the same.\n\nIf you wish to know this in greater depth, consider the *qi* of the four seasons and the positions of the Five Phases. Though their receptions differ, internally they share the same *qi*, mutually generating and completing one another. This is like the head and feet of a person, which do not resemble each other yet internally unite to form a single being.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another teaching.\n\nHeaven has accumulated illness because people do evil and perversely claim that the cycles of time are inauspicious. When the *qi* of the Supreme August arrives, it should assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Yet I fear that the people of this age will not change their conduct, persisting in evil deeds that disrupt the correct *qi*, destroying Heaven’s treasures. Therefore, I have been sent down to produce writings for the virtuous ruler, to enlighten the multitude and cause them to constantly follow my texts in their conduct, no longer troubling Heaven and Earth or violating Heaven’s prohibitions.\n\nFrom this point onward, practice my celestial texts, and the spirits will assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Those who violate them will be punished; if people do not punish them, the spirits will. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. I dare not violate them.\n\nGo now, our discourse is nearly complete. Always reflect on its essentials.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n\"May I ask, Heavenly Master, regarding the talismanic strategies for the twelve thousand states—each differing in meaning—where should they be placed? Should each follow its state’s customs, and with what should one begin?\"\n\n\"Begin with the *qi* of fire in the southeast of the Dipper’s handle.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear the essential meaning of this.\"\n\n\"Fire is yang. Its talisman now governs the heart of Heaven. Harmony governs bestowal, opening governs communication, and clarity governs the management of all affairs. Fire is the heart, and the heart governs the spirit. Harmony may serve as the origin of transformation; all matters that will flourish arise from the heart. The heart governs correct affairs, relying on benevolence to bring illumination, and in turn possesses divine radiance. Though the twelve thousand states’ strategies differ, they are unified in serving as documents for presenting petitions on high. Heaven’s *qi* will naturally follow and circulate—you, Perfected One, must rouse yourself to enact them. Do not oppose this, or you will perish. It is because Heaven delights in issuing these writings that I have been sent to speak. If you do not believe my words, seek verification in your own person. If you practice them, disasters will daily diminish—this is Heaven’s joy in their enactment, and thus disasters recede. If you do not practice them and suffer many illnesses and calamities, it is because Heaven is enraged and grieved, and you obstruct the Dao’s path. Fire is perilous—do not question others about it, but seek proof here, as clear as the sun and moon. Whatever Heaven intends to do, you must not be careless. To fail to act or comply will cause the hearts of people to fall into chaos. Perfected One, be cautious.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Go now, and let me admonish you once more. If Heaven does not wish it done, yet you alone persist, you will invite illness. My texts take this as their verification; from this point onward, it shall always be so. The texts have been reiterated—no further words will be added to complicate them, lest the Dao become difficult to comprehend.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Go, and let me admonish you once more. These disasters and illnesses are not the fault of people of this generation alone—their origins are ancient and distant. Do not seek to eradicate them hastily; simply follow the Heavenly Dao to dissolve and eliminate them. In this way, you will be said to have attained the heart and intent of Heaven. If you do not follow my texts’ instructions and instead impose harsh punishments, disasters will multiply daily, and Heaven will not be pleased. Do you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n**\"Fire Qi and the Rectification of the Divine Dao, Scroll One Hundred Thirty-Five\"**\n\nSomeone asked: In ancient times, the Fire Phase once achieved Great Peace, yet the Divine Dao was not rectified. Why does the Heavenly Master now uniquely command the Fire Phase to rectify the Divine Dao?\n\nExcellent, your question! Thus it is: a hundred people have a hundred intentions, a thousand people have a thousand intentions, ten thousand people have ten thousand intentions—each employs different strategies, each diverges from the others, and so most fail to attain the heart and intent of Heaven.\n\nThe Perfected One speaks truly.\n\nNow, Fire qi is at its most flourishing, and the qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives, yet the common follow in its wake. After the Fire Phase achieved the qi of Great Peace in ancient times, there has been nothing like it since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhy must the Fire qi in its flourishing state rectify the Divine Dao? I wish to hear your intent.\n\nAh! Fire is the heart of Heaven. The heart governs the spirit; when the heart is rectified, the spirit becomes luminous. Thus Heaven has sent me down to govern the Divine Dao.\n\nYet the Divine Dao is inherently divine—why must it be governed?\n\nExcellent, your words! The spirit is Heaven’s upright official. Now, with many wayward spirits, the true spirits cannot hold their proper places. The Divine Dao within Heaven is thrown into great chaos, and all lose their proper abodes.\n\nNow, Heaven’s qi is unbalanced, and the Emperor-Kings are distressed and afflicted, while people fail to grasp its essential intent. You wish to delight in knowing its principles—this is like humanity itself. Now, many wicked people occupy positions of power, collectively disrupting the Emperor-King’s governance. When upright people cannot hold their proper places, Heaven and Earth lose their rectitude to wayward qi.\n\nWhen the wayward are many, they jointly harm the upright; when the upright are many, they jointly suppress the wayward—these two are the natural arts of Heaven and Earth. Do you understand?\n\nThus, the Supreme Yang has never been as flourishing as it is now. Yang is called \"spirit,\" and so Heaven is spirit. Yin is called \"wayward,\" and so perverse qi always moves in the midst of Yin, never daring to act openly in broad daylight. If perversity acts openly in broad daylight, it is called \"Yin usurping the Yang path.\" When illness arises in daylight, it is called \"Yin flourishing and rising,\" signifying that Yang has lost its Dao, and the ruler’s decline has persisted for too long.\n\nThus, Heaven’s Dao has me rectify the Divine Dao, so that such things dare not occur again. Do you understand?\n\n\"Yes, yes. Excellent, excellent.\n\n**The One Hundred Thirty-Sixth Perfected Formula of the Utmost Primordial Qi’s Supreme Equilibrium: The Absence of Vermin**\n\nMay I ask: When the Utmost Primordial Qi’s Supreme Equilibrium arrives, there is nothing it does not govern—thus, the Heavenly Master examined the sores, scabies, and vermin that consume people. Is this the sole means of verification? What of the other vermin?\n\nExcellent indeed, Perfected One, that you ask this today. Is Heaven instructing you to inquire thus? Heaven abhors the wickedness of men—cunning officials and wayward people turn their backs on Heaven and defy Earth, jointly deceiving their superiors. They lurk in the shadows, accumulating perversity over time, like vermin devouring a person. Heaven loathes this, and so it compels you to ask these questions repeatedly.\n\nNow, vermin consuming people—this is what is meant by 'vermin governing men.' Such calamities are the most severe and grievous, for they are perverse qi disrupting the upright. With the advent of the August Equilibrium Qi, such manifestations should not occur.\n\nPerfected One, you have been entrusted by the Virtuous Lord of the Great Peace to understand the thorough harmony of the Dao. Why, then, have the names of the vermin masters in the realm not all been altered—those great and small entities that bring harm? The sores, plagues, and scabies, all belonging to the three vermin within the abdomen, have had their master-names shifted. Where these shifts are most numerous, the lower regions are firmly governed by vermin. Where no such vermin exist, the lower regions are free of their governance. Where they are few, few vermin govern men.\n\nExcellent! Though I am but a humble and ignorant student, I once believed this to be the natural order of Heaven—was my response not one of governance?\n\nYou are foolish indeed—why this intense pain? The nature of Heaven and Earth holds humanity as most noble and vermin as most base. Yet here they devour men together—this is a reversal of the upright, a sign of the ignoble ruling without the Dao, using vermin to consume people. Thus, Heaven perceives this omen clearly and commands the sagely to devise strategies to restore the upright.\n\nAll calamities and anomalies manifest according to their kind, which is how the sages of old came to understand them. Without categorizing by type, they could not be contemplated or countered. Those that conceal themselves within do so like subordinates jointly engaging in perversity, yet daring not to appear outwardly. The external is Yang—Yang is Heaven, the ruler, the true Emperor of Heaven. Thus, vermin fleeing inward to secretly consume people mirror the officials without merit who hide within and secretly devour the people like silkworms. How terrifying! I, a foolish student, am deeply afraid.\n\nYou are right to fear Heaven—this is proper. Had you not feared Heaven, you would have perished long ago. Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, in ancient times, governance was achieved thus: those who were spirit-like summoned true spirits to govern; those who were ghost-like summoned ghosts to govern; those who were thing-like summoned things to govern; and those who were vermin-like governed through vermin. What was there to fear?\n\nI wish to hear more.\n\nIndeed: those who are spirit-like act in harmony with Heaven’s will and in accord with the spirits’ intent. Thus, the spirit-like are Heaven’s agents, and Heaven cherishes them. Those who are ghost-like act by evading human notice, clinging to the Yin realm, whispering in secret like ghosts. Thus, those who summon ghostly entities act by jointly deceiving their superiors, cunning as things—hence, summoning things. Those who are vermin-like act by valuing profit for themselves, jointly profiting at their superiors’ expense, their intentions disordered—thus, summoning vermin.\n\nHeaven’s transformations respond accordingly, all in this manner. The Virtuous Lord of the Great Peace, having received the celestial writings of the realm, thoroughly traced the intentions behind calamities and anomalies to report them—his actions were truly spirit-like!\n\nExcellent, excellent. The qi of calamity has been thoroughly examined and harmonized.\"\n\nHow do you know this? By witnessing the Celestial Master’s rectitude, I know that never again will vermin consume people—thus, harmony is achieved. You may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nMay I ask: what do these repeated characters govern? They govern the guiding of rectitude. Guiding rectitude opens the spirit, for contemplation is their purpose. When one reaches the chamber’s threshold, they serve as a protective contract—how is this done?\n\nWould you hear of it? It is easily understood yet profoundly subtle; these words are light in form but weighty in meaning and must not be recklessly transmitted. Those of refined essence who ingest them are called spirit-like; those lacking refinement who ingest them are called unspirit-like. Those without refinement who ingest them speak reckless words. Thus, the Dao is transmitted only to the proper person and enacted; all affairs are illuminated only when entrusted to the right person. To transmit to the unworthy is reckless action, and the fault returns to the transmitter. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed—I dare not act recklessly. I sincerely entrust it to the proper person. Thus, I speak of it to you.\n\nTake cinnabar as the character, placing the highest first, then proceeding downward to instruct others. One must bathe, purify the essence, and face north, west, south, or east to receive it. They must be solemn, offering fine wine as if it were pure water to drink. Then, contemplating the character, they make it their lifelong practice. Daily, at the hour of *zhengping*, when the virtuous qi arrives, illness is dispelled, and the complexion grows ever more lustrous. If one visualizes the character where the ailment resides, it is called \"returning essence to nourish the form.\" Even those without illness who practice this daily grow increasingly tranquil.\n\nIf one harbors strong malevolent spirits or demonic entities, they may resist and contend, raging as before—yet one must steadfastly contemplate without wavering. In time, they will be subdued and depart. Thereafter, Heaven delights in human uprightness. Using other texts in this way, celestial spirits will also aid those below, moving as human intention directs.\n\nThe superior person, seeing others ingest the character, returns to contemplate likewise. Each who ingests a character can teach others. Thus it is said: the Dao of Heaven moves in a single day. My Way does not imitate mere words but establishes resonance with the Dao of Heaven, harmonizing like an echo—this is what it means to be spirit-like. Perfected One, be cautious.\n\nHaving opened the celestial spirit-way, it returns to the Virtuous Lord, who entrusts it to the worthy and good. People stand upright of their own accord, benefiting the clarity of governance above. The Virtuous Lord, as the enlightened master, instructs with awe-inspiring solemnity. All he teaches is thereby made efficacious, and all spirits witnessed must not be spoken of.\n\nThrough this, the superior person attains deliverance from the world, the middling attains non-action, and the lesser attains steadfastness. What each receives varies in depth, for celestial spirits decree it through talismanic writings. Thus, it is said: do not transmit it, for the contemplation must not differ. Difference makes it impossible to discuss. How true and easy—this is the Dao! How essential and concise—this is the aspiration for longevity!\n\nBy studying it, one naturally aligns, naturally improves, and gains spirit clarity. The heart’s intent shifts, bringing joy. Today, one may ingest my character; later, they may teach others using different texts. Teaching ten, a hundred, a thousand—all respond accordingly. The Dao operates in an instant, circulating through the eight directions and the six conjunctions, with spirit and essence following to heal illness.\n\nFrom this point onward, all under Heaven will early rectify their conduct, delighting in true texts and no longer engaging in deceit or falsehood. Perfected One, if you wish to bring peace to the Dao of Heaven and Earth and swiftly rectify illness, place the Three Dao Conduct Writs foremost.\n\nI wish to hear of the foremost writ. Excellent is your inquiry. The foolish are difficult to rectify—like treating chaos with disorder, it grieves the Virtuous Lord. Thus, the Conduct Writs are presented first, causing all, from high to low, great to small, to correct one another. Common folk are spared the harm of solitary words and contentious scholars.\n\nExcellent, excellent! I wish to hear of the Three Dao Conduct Writs. Why not simply compile a single writ to submit, rather than using many texts with fore and after?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your words align with Heaven’s intent. The reason for fore and after, for difficult questions, is to make common folk deeply aware of their faults. The great illness of solitary speech is this: without seeing the evil of isolated words and single texts, one cannot recognize the goodness of compiled writs. Without transmitting their errors and distinguishing their grave faults, all remain unresolved in heart—only then can they be saved. If the heart is unresolved, one does not know their own conduct, and grave errors persist. When the heart awakens, rectification comes easily.\n\nAll my texts are like this—not only these. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. Proceed—you have grasped it. Perfected One, be cautious in affairs. The texts are sufficient; do not lightly ask repeated questions. I wished not to explain further, fearing it would disappoint you, yet I will speak again.\n\nNow, the great text of the Dao—and the Dao of Heaven cannot be exhausted in phrases. Grasp its intent, and Heaven rejoices greatly. Fail to grasp it, and you oppose the Dao of Heaven, incurring fault and daring not speak further.\n\nGo now.\n\n*Right: Great Compilation of Difficult Questions on the Destruction of Heaven and Earth, Eclipses of Sun and Moon, Violent Deaths of People, the Twelve Thousand States’ Strategies, Talismanic Characters, and the Opening of the Spirit-Decision.*\n\n*End of Scroll Ninety-Two of the* Classic of the Great Peace.\n*Scroll Ninety-Three of the* Classic of the Great Peace *begins.*\n\n**Method of Suppression and Consolidation in Reciprocal Treatment, One Hundred Thirty-Seventh**\n\nNow, this foolish student has obtained the written texts of the Heavenly Master, collating and examining various writings and formulaic books. Returning to dwell in quietude, I have distinguished and pondered their essential meaning. Yet there is a doubt I cannot resolve—may I inquire of one matter?\n\nSpeak.\n\nToday, the Heavenly Master has collated the various formulaic sayings: those with ten out of ten cures are formulas by which the celestial spirits treat; those with nine out of ten cures are formulas by which the terrestrial spirits treat; those with eight out of ten cures are formulas by which the human spirit treats. Beyond this and below, they are not to be used.\n\nThis foolish student believes that only by obtaining that which is fearsome in suppression and consolidation can reciprocal treatment be achieved. Without obtaining that which is fearsome, reciprocal treatment cannot be achieved.\n\nExcellent, Perfected One! Your words grasp the difficult intent.\n\nNow, in all that lies within and beyond the boundless cavern, all that the eye sees and the ear hears, all creeping and moving beings—these are entirely generated by Heaven. Were Heaven not to generate them, they would not exist. Thus, each inherently possesses a spirit that presides over it, and their destinies are each apportioned accordingly.\n\nTake, for example, the six domestic animals: their destinies belong to humans. Their life and death rest solely with humans, for humans are the controller-spirits of the six domestic animals’ destinies. These twelve thousand things all receive the governance of Heaven and Earth and act accordingly. Were even one thing lacking, the governance of Heaven would be incomplete, and thus they are made to reciprocally treat and subdue one another. Furthermore, each is made to have its hierarchy of honor and rank, its lords and leaders. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven is entirely capable of reciprocal treatment and control.\n\nObtaining that which they fear, and thus achieving ten out of ten cures, means their destinies belong to Heaven. Do you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n\"Excellent, you have already understood. Now, I beg to ask one doubt—though it may seem most irreverent and unyielding, how could I not speak of it? Speak freely, without restraint.\n\nConsider the case of bandits who rob and coerce others: they, too, subdue people, yet how could they be deemed the lords and leaders ordained by Heaven’s mandate?\"\n\n\"Excellent is your question, disciple. Those who rob and coerce do so only through lawlessness, wantonly and wrongfully subduing others—but such dominion cannot endure. Once they overpower another, grave punishment follows, and the authorities pursue them without cease. How then can you claim this is Heaven’s mandate? When a true king governs and subdues the people, would he ever be hunted and seized?\n\nAll people are born with the king as their lord and leader, as their destiny. Do you, Perfected One, not yet comprehend this?\"\n\n\"I now fully understand.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent. Go forth, scholar, and refine your understanding. Do not recklessly raise difficult questions, for Heaven is not as men are.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"You have erred, you have erred—do not act so. Be reverent and cautious, not like the common folk who speak whatever comes to mind.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"When I, foolish as I am, speak, I often commit grave errors. Yet if I remain silent, I have no means to gain understanding. Now, if I have another question to ask, I dare not blurt it out at once.\"\n\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\n\"If each of the myriad things has its own lord and leader, do Heaven and Earth also have lords and leaders?\"\n\n\"Ah! How profoundly subtle and far-reaching is your question. Now that you know your inquiry was not modest, you fear to ask the Heavenly Master directly, lest you remain forever ignorant.\n\nKnow then: Heaven takes the Central Ultimate, the highest of all, as its lord and leader. Earth takes Kunlun’s peak as its lord and leader. The sun takes the King Sun as its lord and leader. The moon takes the Great Moon as its lord and leader. The stars take the Central Ultimate Star as their lord and leader. The mountains take the Five Peaks as their lords and leaders, and the Five Peaks take Mount Tai, beneath the Central Ultimate, as their lord and leader. The hundred rivers take the Yangtze and the seas as their lords and leaders. Creatures with shells take the divine tortoise as their lord and leader. Those with scales take the dragon as their lord and leader. Winged creatures take the phoenix as their lord and leader. Beasts with fur take the qilin as their lord and leader. Naked creatures take humans as their lord and leader. And humans take the emperor as their lord and leader.\n\nSuch hierarchies in the world are too numerous to recount in full. I have merely outlined their essentials for you, Perfected One, to grasp their beginnings. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nYou would do well to ponder deeply these principles, though they cannot all be committed to memory—such matters are not easily put to practical use.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nNow, consider the crawling creatures endowed with awareness: those whose nature lies within their own bodies, who accomplish their affairs without external prompting. Why should one recklessly kill or harm them? The concern is that it may provoke the wrath of their lord and leader.\n\nIn this era, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, one must join with a virtuous ruler to govern in harmony. To recklessly inflict harm disrupts the qi of Great Peace, throwing governance into chaos and confusion.\n\nHow could such petty beings possibly move Heaven to disorder its governance, causing such turmoil?\n\nAlas, you remain as one benighted, still failing to grasp the greater truth. Every kind has its own lord and leader—just as the lowliest and most despised people in distant borderlands stand at the very bottom of the emperor’s domain, like ants or vile men, beyond all reckoning.\n\nIf, without cause, one were to murder or injure even a hundred or so of them, their families would cry out in grievance, petitioning the emperor. Upon hearing of it, the emperor would fly into a rage, issuing decrees to investigate and punish the offenders. Provinces, commanderies, and counties would be thrown into uproar, treating it as a grave matter. Many would be brought to ruin as a result—more than one.\n\nDo you understand this?\n\nHow dreadful! How dreadful!\n\nTo act upon this, you shall know great awe—and thus attain long life.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTherefore, the sage-kings of antiquity, understanding that the celestial patterns and models were luminously clear, dared not recklessly employ punishments. Theirs was the utmost depth of thoughtful foresight.\n\nThus, their governance was ever balanced. Without expending force, they won the heart of Heaven—through their profound caution.\n\nYet when former kings made even slight errors, the consequences borne by later generations brought both gains and losses, making governance difficult to stabilize.\n\nDo you understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, Heaven cherishes the virtuous ruler. Thus, I set forth these admonitions in full, making it hard to transgress them.\n\nPresent my writings to the ruler of supreme virtue, that he may reflect upon his ill intentions.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n*(Right: Compiled questions on the proper governance of things, each with its own lord and leader.)*\n\n**Section One Hundred Thirty-Eight: The Secret of Yang’s Honor and Yin’s Humility**\n\nI wish to ask: Why does Yang alone attain honor and esteem, while Yin is solely named lowly and base?\n\nExcellent, your question! You nearly perceive the intent of the Dao and virtue.\n\nYang is called honored and esteemed because it guards its root, ever full and replete with substance.\n\nYin is called lowly and base because it is hollow and empty, lacking substance—thus it is despised and held in contempt.\n\nFoolish beings, receiving meager and scant mandate from Heaven, are benighted and slow to awaken. I pray the Heavenly Master fully explain this meaning.\n\nWhy have you not fully grasped the intent of the Way of Heaven?\n\nEven the Perfected remain unclear—how much more the common folk, sunk in darkness!\n\nNow, the names Yin and Yang, male and female, arise from the primordial qi at its very inception—the gateway of Yin and Yang.\n\nWhere humans receive their mandate and life is their root.\n\nThus, the male receives his mandate full and overflowing, with surplus. Below and to his left and right, each still holds a kernel of substance.\n\nAbove, he is full and overflowing, ever bestowing. Below, Yin accumulates surplus, ever possessing substance.\n\nThe one above who bestows corresponds to the Great Yang and the movement of Heaven—nothing it cannot generate, nothing it cannot complete.\n\nThe one below who accumulates corresponds to the Great Yin, to Earth, with its patterns and veins, to the fields and paths.\n\nThe kernel on the left corresponds to humanity; the kernel on the right corresponds to the myriad things.\n\nThe kernel is the fruit’s core—thus, benevolence delights in giving, yet also possesses a kernel of substance.\n\nTherefore, Yang is called honored and esteemed.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe Yin is woman, and why she is deemed lowly and base lies in the place where she receives her mandate: her gate is hollow and empty, without fullness or surplus, and moreover without kernel or substance—thus she is seen as lowly and base.\n\nThe fundamental names of Yin-Yang and male-female refer precisely to these two matters. As for the body’s upper and lower parts, though they bear no names in themselves, the fundamental name of Yin-Yang is distinguished by these two matters.\n\nConsider the woman’s head, eyes, face, ears, and limbs—all are equal to the man’s. Her fondness for goodness may even surpass that of men, yet she is deemed lowly and base for this very reason. The man’s head, face, and limbs, his fondness for goodness not matching the woman’s, are yet called honored and esteemed precisely for this reason.\n\nExcellent, excellent indeed. Thus you may be said to have awakened to this truth.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of Heaven values the root and guards the origin. Thus the sage, observing the luminous patterns of Heaven, must return to the root and guard the primordial, rectifying characters and examining texts to resolve delusion.\n\nThus can Heaven and Earth be made enduringly secure, and the state know joy.\n\nTherefore, to guard the root and possess substance, to delight in bestowing—this is the good person. The root being hollow and empty, without kernel or substance, ever insufficient yet fond of seeking—this is the evil person, the base person. This is the meaning.\n\nNow I wish to ask one remaining doubt. Proceed with your words.\n\nWhen a woman conceives and her womb bears fruit, yet the Heavenly Master says it is without substance—why is this?\n\nAlas, your inner self is hollow and empty, somewhat resembling one who has lost the Dao. Yet Heaven sees your earnest and single-minded devotion, and so allows you to come and ask these matters.\n\nNow, in a woman’s conception, the yin is fundamentally hollow and empty. Only when yang comes to bestow and transform does it take substance within yin. Yin, being lowly and submissive, fears yang and nourishes it obediently, not daring to cast it away.\n\nYang is Heaven, the ruler; yin is Earth, the minister. Thus, yin reveres and honors yang’s bestowal, nurturing it and not daring to abandon it.\n\nIf you wish to know its truth, compare it to a lord who entrusts a guest to a humble household. The household nourishes the guest and does not dare send him away, and so the guest grows robust and attains full stature—this is precisely the same principle.\n\nThe common saying that “yang generates and yin completes” means only that yin follows and nourishes, bringing yang’s substance to fruition. My writings often explain it in terms of nurturing—this is how it is.\n\nI see that you, Perfected One, delight in knowing the kernel of the true Dao, the utmost essential meaning of Heaven. Therefore, I have spoken to you of its essentials.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo on, you have awakened.\n\nNow I wish to ask: only humans have male and female—can this distinguish the substance of yin and yang? Do all things between Heaven and Earth follow this pattern?\n\nAlas, you remain as if deluded and uncomprehending. Excellent, Perfected One, your questioning is profound.\n\nNow, the nature of Heaven and Earth applies to all things. Let me tell you one matter that penetrates from above to below.\n\nYou—if your words are not... go on, open both ears and listen, do not lose even a fraction.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo on. When yang is outside, all things rise upward, conceiving and bearing fruit among the upper branches and leaves. At this time, Heaven’s yang qi is outside and has not yet returned to the roots below, so all things bear substance on the surface. Creeping creatures and the multitudes of people also gather outwardly.\n\nWhen yang qi returns inward into the earth, all things above become empty and without substance, while those below conceive and bear fruit within the earth, nourishing roots and leaves. Creeping creatures and people also enter and gather inwardly.\n\nThis is the great and luminous proof by August Heaven of yang’s true substance.\n\nThus, those who hold to the Dao of yang possess substance, while those who guard the Dao of yin lack it.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity governed by emulating Heaven and never dared emulate Earth.\n\nI wish to hear: what does it mean to emulate Heaven?\n\nTo emulate Heaven is to gather the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, the masters of Dao and arts, the sagely and wise—this is called emulating Heaven. To gather wealth and goods, petty men, the unworthy, and those ignorant of culture and refinement—this is called emulating Earth.\n\nExcellent, excellent. I wish to hear: why do the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, and the masters of Dao and arts emulate Heaven?\n\nHeaven is the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, the masters of Dao and arts. Moreover, Heaven can ride the qi and fly—these six kinds of people, with their superior talents and unwavering devotion to the true Dao, may also attain the ability to ride the qi and fly. Thus, they belong to Heaven and emulate it.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity alone deeply understood the will of August Heaven and never dared stray from it.\n\nI wish to hear: why does gathering wealth and goods, petty men, and the unworthy emulate Earth?\n\nNow, wealth gathers below and forms mud, mud transforms into dung, and dung transforms into soil. Petty men, foolish and unworthy, are deaf and blind to the Dao and its arts. They enter inauspicious gates and are fated to dwell early beneath the earth. If they are not buried, in time they become deeply harmful to Heaven and Earth. Governing with them brings chaos to the patterns of Heaven and Earth, the Five Phases contend daily, the four seasons lose their order, the Three Luminaries dim, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the hundred spirits do not love them. They contribute nothing to proper governance and should meet an early end—this is the nature of wealth.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed. How terrifying! How terrifying!\n\nDo you understand what is terrifying? This may be called the path to long preservation. Those who do not early grasp what is terrifying bring grave fault upon Heaven and Earth. The foolish and unworthy deeply fear this. If you understand and fear this celestial law, Heaven will preserve your life. If you do not revere and fear it, you share the same principle as the unworthy.\n\nFortune and misfortune are not originally Heaven’s transgressions—they are what people seek for themselves. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed. Go forth, and be ever vigilant. Indeed, indeed.\n\n*(Here concludes the collection of essential distinctions between male and female, the root of honor and baseness, yin and yang, the kernel of the noble and the petty.)*\n\n**One Hundred and Thirty-Ninth Secret of the Innumerable Secrets of the Realm**\n\nI venture to ask one matter. Let the Way be made level. I wish to hear: how many states exist in the world?\n\nProfound! Wondrous! This is what you ask. Now, the central region comprises eighty-one domains. Beyond it, encircling once more, the world holds ten thousand states. Extending further to the boundless void, the three regions together number twelve thousand states.\n\nWhy are there twelve thousand states? The celestial reckoning begins with one and ends with ten. Ten multiplied yields the Way of Heaven, which reaches five and then returns. Thus it arrives at ten thousand states. The two thousand additional states correspond to the alternating reckoning of yin and yang, akin to the completion of a count by tens. The reckoning of years and months is uniquely twelve, with an intercalary month added every five years. This reflects the cyclical arising of Heaven and Earth. Beyond the boundless void of Heaven, it accords with the combined reckoning of Heaven and Earth. Thus twelve months return and merge into one year, with intercalation inserted within.\n\nThese twelve months are the reckoning of the primordial qi in its obscure darkness, the alternating inception of yin and yang. It is like all things ending in death at *hai* (亥), while *qian* (乾) establishes its initial position at the Gate of Heaven, congealing its kernel. At *hai*, it conceives; at *ren* (壬), it takes form. The first nine at *zi* (子), the sun begins its return; the second nine at *chou* (丑), yin and yang revolve; the third nine at *yin* (寅), Heaven, Earth, and humanity—all things—turn from yin toward yang, gazing toward *yin*. Thus all things first spread their roots in the northeast and show their heads at *yin*. The greatest of things take wood as their chief. Thus *yin* is the inception of wood, and *jia* (甲) is the very beginning of wood. Therefore, all things appear at *jia-yin* and end in death at *gui-hai* (癸亥).\n\nThus wood receives its mandate and life from the primordial qi within the Great Yin’s water. Hence *jia-zi* (甲子) is taken as the initial beginning. The celestial reckoning of change multiplies by five in its cycles. Thus five thousand, added to the twelve earthly branches, arrives precisely at *gui-hai* (癸亥), the completion of the reckoning. Perfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nYou have not yet grasped its meaning. Now, wandering in blindness, ponder it long and deeply—you will come to understand. Go, reflect upon it.\n\nWhy, Perfected One, do you persist in asking how many states exist in the world? This foolish student has received the Heavenly Master’s scriptures, which speak of repaying Heaven and Earth’s profound merit, healing the ailments of Heaven and Earth, and relieving the accumulated disasters and calamities that have befallen the world since the establishment of all affairs under Heaven and Earth for a virtuous and sagely emperor.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master’s writings on the unified Dao are entrusted to a single virtuous state. Yet even if the ruler of that state possessed the virtue of ten thousand men, how could he alone resolve the boundless interplay of yin and yang or dispel the disasters of Heaven and Earth? How could he traverse and govern both the inner and outer realms of Heaven and Earth, cutting off the deep and distant maladies of the limitless cosmos?\n\nAh, how excellent! Has Heaven sent you to ask this? Alas, how astonishing! Alas, how astonishing! I wished to remain silent, but now I fear that if I die without speaking, I will have failed to remove this burden from you. Perfected One, how did you come to ask such a question?\n\nThis foolish student, having received the Heavenly Master’s teachings and commands, returned to ponder their meaning in solitude. Where I found incomprehension, I asked. Yet you speak only of resolving the calamities of a single virtuous ruler’s state—why do you ask thus?\n\nIf the Heavenly Master’s writings merely resolve the disasters of one virtuous state, it would be called healing only that single land. How then could it heal the ailments of Heaven and Earth or repay the august Heaven’s profound merit?\n\nExcellent indeed are your words—I have nothing to add. Perfected One, pray explain your meaning.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master speaks of the vast and empty cosmos containing twelve thousand states. If only one virtuous state receives the Dao, how could it resolve the disasters of all twelve thousand states and bring peace to Heaven and Earth as a whole?\n\nExcellent are your words. Have you truly been sent by the Master to ask this?\n\n\"Very well. Now I shall explain in full for the Perfected One, that it may be made clear and all maladies of the world may be eradicated. I stand in awe of Heaven’s majesty and dare not conceal anything—record my words with diligence.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Observe: the celestial reckoning begins with one and ends with ten. One multiplied by ten is ten; ten multiplied by ten reaches one hundred; one hundred multiplied by ten reaches one thousand; one thousand multiplied by ten reaches ten thousand. One is the beginning of all numbers; ten is their end. One hundred represents the virtuous states and regions.\n\nYou need only take my writings and bestow them upon a single state of great virtue. Those who transmit my writings shall carry the original forth without exhaustion, circulating it to the hundred virtuous regions. When one state receives my writings, that state prospers, and its people all turn toward it. Its virtue then spreads to the four directions, and the hundred states all receive its transformative influence, becoming good. Thus, Heaven and Earth are both pacified, and disasters are eliminated. By bestowing it upon the hundred virtuous states, the ten thousand states will suffer no harm, and the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be wholly dispelled.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! I wish to know why you do not instruct the foolish and ignorant as well.\"\n\n\"The reason they cannot be instructed in the same way is that states lacking virtue are those Heaven has doomed and forsaken—they cannot practice the true Dao. Thus, the teachings are directed only to the virtuous states. Now, when the virtueless states all turn toward the virtuous ones, they too will naturally be governed aright.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! I wish to know why you take precisely these hundred virtuous states as the model.\"\n\n\"Excellent indeed is your question—you have grasped the meaning. The reckoning of Heaven, Earth, and humanity begins with one and ends with ten. Heaven’s numbers unfold upon the Earth and give rise to life; when the reckoning is complete, it emerges as one hundred. Only when Heaven, Earth, and humanity are all present, when the three unite in a single heart, is virtue achieved. If any one matter is discordant, virtue cannot be realized.\n\nI wish to know why Heaven’s number begins precisely with one.\"\n\n\"One is the time when primordial qi is utterly pure. Primordial qi coalesces without division—like wind, it has no seams—thus it is called one. When one congeals, it forms Heaven, which encompasses the eight directions above and below, hence the number ten. There are also the five directions, each with its own yin and yang, thus the number ten. Below, it corresponds to Earth. When Earth’s reckoning aligns with ten, life is generated. Thus, humans mirror Heaven’s numbers, being born after ten months. One is precisely the time of harmonious and boundless bestowal. Those who have received this bestowal must in turn mirror Heaven’s reckoning, emerging after ten months—thus the number ends at ten. Therefore, one is multiplied by ten.\n\nThe Way of Earth is the mother. At the time of *yu*, it joins in harmony with humanity. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are mutually attuned, virtue is achieved—hence the hundred virtuous states. Thus, Heaven governs generation, Earth governs nurturance, and humanity governs completion. If any one matter strays from rectitude, all three fall into error. Therefore, when Heaven acts wickedly, it brings calamity; when Earth acts wickedly, it brings calamity; when humanity acts wickedly, it brings calamity. When all three act wickedly together, Heaven, Earth, and humanity are destroyed, and the reckoning begins anew. When all three act with goodness, their virtue pervades the void in perfect unity—thus, when the three unite, virtue is achieved, corresponding to the hundred states.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! This is the guiding principle of the ten thousand states, the realm where Heaven, Earth, and humanity unite in virtue. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThus, the Perfected One has now eradicated the afflictions of Heaven and Earth and removed the inherited burdens of the Virtuous Lord. Though you have diligently upheld my scriptures and transmitted them to the hundred virtuous states, all maladies of yin and yang have vanished, and the disasters of emperors and kings have all been eliminated.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Foolish students in the past did not inquire with sufficient effort, and thus had no means to comprehend this. Your words are correct: those who study but do not inquire earnestly are no different from those who do not study at all. Therefore, the learning of the ancient sages and worthies involved questioning their teachers day and night without daring to slacken. Thus, they came to understand the Dao of Heaven.\n\nYes, yes. Truly, one must inquire with effort and dare not grow lax. In this way, you have already grasped the Dao.\n\nI wish to ask: today, the customs of the world vary—if one were to teach and instruct them with a single Dao, would there be no doubt?\n\nAlas! Your words on this matter reveal even greater foolishness and benighted ignorance. Why is this so? The so-called customs and rites of today are but false conduct, not their true nature. All people under Heaven receive the nature of Heaven and Earth, with the Five Phases as their inner treasuries and the four seasons as their qi. They harmonize with yin and yang to propagate their kind, all delighting in life and abhorring death, nourishing their bodies with food and drink, loving goodness and detesting evil—there is no difference among them. When there are those who do not understand the Perfected One’s scriptures and fail to comprehend, at the time of instruction, the Perfected One should employ their local language and customary teachings, adapting to their customs so that people may exert themselves to remember. In this way, all under Heaven will know how to apply it without doubt.\n\nMy Dao is like the sun and moon, circulating and illuminating all under Heaven, each speaking with radiant clarity, vast and luminous in its sufficiency. If you wish to further verify its truth, compare it to the myriad creatures that crawl and move, all sharing one Heaven and Earth, the Six Jia, the Five Phases, and the four seasons—these are more than sufficient. Thus, all are taught and shown through the standards of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo forth, and if difficulties do not cease, then explanations will have no end. Now the great scriptures of the Dao, on the contrary, are difficult to grasp in meaning.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI wish to ask one more question and then stop. Speak.\n\nNow, regarding these twelve thousand states, how should one regard them?\n\nThis is all within the reckoning, like intercalary months. If you wish to know its truth, compare it to counting: ten makes a complete cycle, and a year returns to twelve months before it ends, yet sometimes there is a thirteenth month inserted—this is what it means. If but a hundred states practice the Dao and virtue, then the ten thousand states will be free of disaster, and the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be entirely exhausted—this too is included in the reckoning.\n\nExcellent, excellent! If you exert yourself to circulate my scriptures among the hundred states of virtue, allowing each to expound my writings according to their customs, then the twelve thousand states will all be at peace, the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be greatly dispelled, and your years will increase without limit. If you bring peace to a few, you will gain a few years; if to half, you will gain half a year’s extension; if to all, you will gain boundless years.\n\nSince you, Perfected One, have such good intentions, Heaven has enabled you to ask fully—this is fitting, and you need not overburden yourself. The utmost limit of Heaven is numinous and luminous, without superior, yet it still practices the Dao with diligence, circling once each day to bring peace to all things. Thus, it alone attains constant fortune and long life. Earth likewise follows Heaven’s actions and nurtures all things. If Heaven were to cease its movement for a single day, the sun, moon, and stars would not shift, and there would be an imbalance of qi—Heaven would then be destroyed. Since Heaven does not dare cease its practice of the Dao, it attains long life—how much more should you?\n\nStrive, each bending effort for your own sake, for you cannot do so for others. My ceaseless explanations are also for my own sake, not for yours. All within the six directions, all the myriad restless beings, each calculates for their own body and cannot do so for others.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI have received the teachings of the Heavenly Master and had them recorded by the virtuous kingdoms, never daring to grow lax. In practice, you have already understood this.\n\nAll of you, strive, strive—once your tasks are complete, we shall follow one another.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAs I prepare to depart, I wish to ask one matter.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nNow, the six of us return to our quiet dwellings, reflecting together upon the Heavenly Master’s words. At times, we seem to grasp them profoundly; at other times, confusion and distraction arise, yet we remain unwavering. We wish to present our doubts to the Heavenly Master for resolution.\n\nI have pondered repeatedly whether to trouble the Heavenly Master, wishing to restrain myself from speaking. Yet I fear that if I part from you, I may pass the remainder of my years without ever again gaining such understanding. Thus, I overcome my shame and venture to ask once more.\n\nProceed.\n\nHeaven has arranged for me to meet and speak with the six of you—do not decline.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, I wish to ask: among the kingdoms under Heaven, are there only twelve thousand?\n\nAre there more?\n\nAh, how profound is your question! Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, there has never been such a reckoning. Yet these twelve thousand kingdoms are but one great division. What boundless limits could the rest possibly have?\n\nWhy are they so numerous?\n\nAh, your question this morning reveals the utmost depth of inquiry, yet now you turn back, lost in darkness—how foolish! Truly, you do not yet comprehend. Observing your disciples’ queries, I see that you have not yet fully grasped the Dao of Heaven. Just now, you seemed on the verge of understanding, yet inwardly, you remain distant.\n\nThe common people, lost in confusion and chaos, are naturally so. Compared to them, you are true persons—I do not fault you. Yet let me open your ears further and explain for the six of you.\n\nHeaven extends upward and downward without limit, and its lateral expanse knows no bounds. Wherever it converges, it forms a division, a realm—how could it have any end?\n\nI wish to hear: where does the uppermost limit of Heaven lie? What exists beyond it? And where does it find its ultimate cessation? Where does the lowermost limit of Earth lie? What exists beneath it? And where does it find its central cessation?\n\nWhere does the lateral expanse of Heaven and Earth end? Why does it turn back upon itself, reaching its limit?\n\nThese six directions—where do they find their ultimate bounds?\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven is without end. In great use, it is precisely sufficient; in small use, it is precisely sufficient. In great use, there is surplus; in small use, there is surplus.\n\nDo you true persons comprehend this?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAlas, how startling! Alas, how startling! Had you not pressed the question with such vigor, there would have been no way to attain this knowledge. Yet you may be said to have glimpsed a small awakening. Go now—do not pursue this inquiry to its end. I fear the Six Perfected Ones would be startled and undone. To force questions beyond one’s capacity is to invite great harm.\n\nYet those who would be teachers face many difficulties. Seeing your distress, I shall clarify further for you. Go, and listen with open ears. Be seated and attend. Very well.\n\nYou wish to delight in knowing its great efficacy. Consider this: a single household has father, mother, and child—just as the Dao of Heaven completes a household. The father is likened to Heaven, the mother to Earth, the child to the harmonious center. Their gathered possessions, all that the household contains, are like the myriad things—together, they form one family. The father is as the ruler, the mother as the minister, the child as the people. Wealth and goods circulate to nourish one another, sharing as the myriad things do. This one household shares one great concern.\n\nA single district of ten thousand households likewise forms one family, sharing one great concern. Ten districts unite to form a commandery—one family, one great concern. Ten commanderies unite to form a great province—one family, one great concern. Ten provinces unite to form a great state—one great family, one great concern, and one great realm.\n\nWhen the emperor’s virtue is abundant, his concern extends to twelve provinces; when vast, it reaches thirteen provinces. Together, they form one great family, sharing one great concern. Beyond these borders lie distant lands not subject to human rule. If those lands possess the Dao and virtue, their good people come to the human realm; if they lack virtue, they do not come. If their virtue is inferior, they come to harm others.\n\nThis is one division, one realm—the demarcation of Heaven and Earth. It ensures that the restless multitudes of the world each have their place and do not prey upon one another.\n\nThus, what is meant by the Great Ultimate, the Central Ultimate, and the Lesser Ultimate? The Great Ultimate governs what lies beyond all external bounds. The Central Ultimate governs the central region. The Lesser Ultimate ensures that each responds to its own realm and ceases there. They may seek one another through the Dao and virtue, but they must not greatly prey upon one another. Heaven resents this—hence, they are called one family, sharing one great concern.\n\nDo you wish to know its truth? Consider a household of father, son, and wife: they worry only that their own family may not prosper and do not concern themselves with other households. A single district shares concern for its ruler—if he is good, they promote him to higher office, each striving to advance their local officials; if he is evil, they wish to remove him together. A district, a commandery, a province, a state—all follow this principle, sharing one great concern.\n\nNow, it is recorded that twelve thousand states form one great division, sharing one great concern with the Perfected Ones. One realm—yet beyond it, realms like these twelve thousand states are beyond counting.\n\nThus, the works of the sages of old all recorded but one small division. Why did they not record the great realms? Heaven did not permit it to be spoken. The great transformation had not yet emerged; what was made differed, and could not follow the same pattern—thus, it was not recorded.\n\nNow, the great transformation has emerged. The twelve thousand states have completed their cyclical revolutions, and so Heaven has sent the Perfected Ones to inquire into the scripture of the boundless and the governance of the all-penetrating. Thus, the text is entrusted to the one hundred states possessing virtue. One virtuous state transforms ninety-nine others. The twelve thousand states are counted together—like a year of twelve months, with the thirteenth month as an intercalary addition. This is what is meant.\n\nDo you understand? Very well.\n\nGo forth.\n\nVery well. Guard the divine numina of Heaven’s Dao with reverence; do not recklessly destroy or disorder them.\n\nVery well. Now that you have received the solemn mandate of the Heavenly Illuminated Master, though your awakening be slight and partial, you have come to know one great division. You wish to hear of one small realm—to be shown and told of this boundless land?\n\nSo be it. The Perfected One speaks to you with restrained words; record them carefully.\n\nNow, if I were to command the Perfected One to amass wealth and resources—pillars reaching up to the sun and moon of Heaven, pillars reaching down to the earth, spanning ten thousand *li* in breadth and length—I fear that even with such boundless wealth and resources, one would still suffer from constant scarcity and hardship, and thus be unable to record the names and numbers of all these lands.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nVery well. This foolish student dares not press further on the Dao of Heaven. Having heard the words of the Heavenly Master, I am now as if bereft of *qi*, as if my soul has fled—I dare not ask again.\n\nYet you may be called one who comprehends affairs. If you wish to repay the profound merit of Heaven and Earth, and to receive the mandate of the boundless, simply traverse this one great division of the twelve thousand states, and your lifespan shall already be without limit.\n\nAs for the six directions above and below, which penetrate all extremes—Heaven does not task the Six Masters alone with their care. Those who bear this concern belong to another realm, not yours; nor will you be held accountable or punished for what lies beyond your charge. Their safety or peril, their good or ill, are governed by others.\n\nThe discourse on this division is now complete. Do not ask further.\n\nVery well.\n\nGo forth. Strive diligently, you Six Masters—let the Perfected One study to attain minor understanding, though the great intent of the Dao of Heaven remains yet unseen. Apply yourselves with unflagging focus.\n\nVery well.\n\nTo study without precision is no different from madness; to be precise yet fail to grasp the truth is to be mute and deaf, pointing west while asking about the east. Thus do the masters of the world engage in ceaseless debate—why this clamor? Though clamor there may be, it profits nothing, for they remain as those who know not how to compare.\n\nLike an infant still swaddled, unemerged from the womb, following its mother’s body in movement—how could it know the vastness and boundlessness of the Dao of Heaven? Therefore, lesser masters, in their stubborn anger, delight in reckless discourse, only to wound the Dao of Heaven and Earth. They lose the intent of the Dao, unable to bring peace to their lords and kings. The world is thrown into turmoil, all bearing the weight of their errors, their words diverging wildly. Disasters and calamities spread unchecked, beyond restraint or prevention.\n\nThough texts may number in the billions upon billions, the world’s flowing misfortunes and harms never cease, ever repeating the same patterns—all born of forced interpretations, of failing to grasp the essentials of the Dao.\n\nDoes the Perfected One understand?\nVery well.\n\nGo on, I would fully explain it to you as your child, yet it would never end, straining resources and proving too burdensome—so I pause here briefly. If doubts remain, return to ask again.\nYes, yes.\n\n*Here concludes the collection of disputations, transmissions of scriptural secrets, and the division of teachings among the states.*\n\n**Reverently Serving the Spirits: Fifteen-Year Great Peace Secret, Scroll One Hundred Forty**\n\nI humbly request to ask one matter.\nSpeak plainly.\nNow that the heavens bestow Great Peace, can it be foreknown?\nYes, it can be known.\nWhen the qi of the Five Thearchs’ spirits attains Great Peace, that year will be one of joyous harmony.\nWhat does this mean?\nI wish to hear it.\nThus: in spring, when the qi of the Green Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in summer, when the qi of the Red Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in the sixth month, when the qi of the Yellow Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in autumn, when the qi of the White Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in winter, when the qi of the Black Thearch’s spirit is at peace.\nHow is this made clear?\nGreat Peace means that not a single thing is harmed—this is the essence of the qi of Great Peace. In all matters, if not a single thing is injured or afflicted, all things find their proper place, and thus it is called *peace*. If one thing is harmed, it is immediately unpeaceful. If two things are harmed, it is immediately subject to punishment. If three things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to all things. If four things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the four directions. If five things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the five directions, and the world suffers great calamity. If six things are harmed, it is immediately an evil that pervades the six directions. If seven things are harmed, its baleful qi spreads unchecked. If eight things are harmed, it immediately causes the worthy and the unworthy to hold divergent plans and fail to unite their strength. If nine things are harmed, it immediately brings evil to its ultimate conclusion in yin and yang, causing things to churn in chaos. If ten things are harmed, it is a harm to the great net, and the celestial reckoning is exhausted, giving way to a new count.\nThus, the sages of antiquity simply observed clearly whether the qi of the Five Thearchs’ spirits was at peace or not, and thereby knew whether governance was successful or failing, whether peace had been achieved or not.\nI wish to hear the meaning of the peace secret.\nThus: when all things in spring are born without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Green Thearch. When all things in summer grow without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Red Thearch. In the sixth month, when all things are nurtured without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Yellow Thearch. In autumn, when all things reach maturity and are harvested without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the White Thearch. In winter, when all things are stored without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Black Thearch.\nWhen the Five Thearchs attain Great Peace for one year, the people rejoice and act with goodness and compliance. For two years, the earth above is filled with great joy. For three years, grace and favor reach their culmination in heaven. For four years, the winds and qi flow in harmony. For five years, the Nine Spirits do not war, and pernicious evils are subdued and destroyed. For six years, the Six Norms are fully established. For seven years, the Three Luminaries grow brighter. For eight years, grace reaches the eight directions. For nine years, yin and yang are both pleased. For ten years, the myriad things each find their proper place. This completes the lesser cycle of reckoning, and when things are thrice united, heaven, earth, and humanity are complete—thus, in thirty years, Great Peace is achieved.\nNow, the qi of the Supreme Thearch emerges, and the true Dao arrives to govern, so in fifteen years, Great Peace is attained. If one does not vigorously practice the true Dao, how can Great Peace be idly achieved?\nThis fifteen-year attainment of Great Peace refers to the emperor and his ministers, great and small, who follow the true Dao, jointly dispelling falsehood and deceit—thus, in fifteen years, peace is achieved.\nDoes the Perfected One understand?\nTherefore, to know whether peace is coming or not, simply observe whether the spirits of the Five Thearchs are at peace or not—this is sufficient for clarity, sufficient for self-knowledge.\nThus, all omens first appear among the celestial spirits. If the celestial spirits are not at peace, how can humanity alone claim peace?\nTherefore, as the Five Thearchs take turns governing, each can bring about Great Peace. Those who lose the intent of the celestial spirits cannot bring peace to their governance.\nThus, one must carefully follow the four seasons, be prudent with the five phases, and not allow the Nine Spirits to war. Therefore, one must revere their conduct and serve their spirits.\nNow, the first and supreme qi of peace is about to arrive, so I teach the Perfected One to revere the four seasons and five phases, causing the great and small to rise together and serve the affairs of the spirits.\nIn antiquity, they merely revered the four seasons and five phases, so Great Peace came slowly, in thirty years. Now, by also revering the spirits, it comes swiftly, in fifteen years.\nDoes the Perfected One understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nAlas! Alas! Yet you have awakened.\nI humbly ask: If a person’s conduct is loyal and upright with true substance, can this be known?\nExcellent is your question.\nIn associating with them, if their words and deeds daily appear harsh and resentful, yet people long remember them, and what was once monthly good becomes monthly harsh, or what was monthly harsh becomes yearly good—if in youth their actions seem most wicked, yet in old age they become most virtuous—if all turn to their words, delight in their conduct, and cherish their Dao, this is one of utmost loyalty, trustworthiness, and supreme goodness, a person of true substance.\nExcellent, excellent indeed.\n\nI humbly ask further: Can one who is disloyal, untrustworthy, and deceitful in conduct also be known?\nYes, this too can be known.\nIn associating with them, observe their words and deeds: if daily and monthly they align with others’ hearts, appearing compliant and good, yet what was long remembered and employed becomes monthly more wicked, or what was monthly good becomes yearly wicked—if in youth they seem good, their words loyal and trustworthy, yet in old age what they do and recall becomes most wicked—this is pure deceit and flattery, the conduct of one who is disloyal and untrustworthy. As they grow old, their words and deeds are exposed, and they become most base. Calamity befalls their wife and children, and misfortune flows to later generations.\nExcellent, excellent indeed.\n\n**Method of Disasters from Matching Words but Not Deeds, One Hundred Forty-First**\n\nSince the Highest Antiquity and Middle Ages, many have matched their words but not their deeds, thus inviting disasters, harms, illnesses, and accumulated misfortunes that cannot be dispelled—thereby bringing ruin upon themselves.\n\nTherefore, I reverently received this Dao from Heaven, matching trustworthiness and sincerity, not empty words. Those who grasp and practice the Dao in my writings—though people of later ages may daily say, \"This Dao is of no benefit,\" yet month by month it proves good; though they may monthly say it is of no benefit, yet year by year it proves good; though they may yearly say it is of no benefit, yet even in old age it remains constantly good, enduring without departure—later generations will take it as the learning of their age.\n\nThose who do not practice swiftly know only the long, solitary suffering of their own time. Thus, I instruct and command the Perfected Ones to be ever diligent and earnest.\n\nThe Dao emerges for those of virtue and power: whether first or last, none are uniquely favored or closely bound to me—I receive them equally. Therefore, whoever obtains it and strives to practice it is that person; there is no distinction between one and another.\n\nDo you understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nProceed: The Way of Heaven is impartial, returning to humanity; the power of Earth is unbiased, bestowed upon the careful. Among the people, there is no precedence or delay—only love for those of true trustworthiness.\n\nThus, the ancient emperors and kings had palaces and dwellings to employ those of virtue and power, not idle ministers without merit. Those of virtue and power are beloved by Heaven and Earth and can assist emperors and kings in pacifying the myriad things. Those without virtue and power are resented by Heaven and Earth, thieves of yin and yang.\n\nHow weighty is this?\nAre you still so foolish?\n\nIndeed, those without virtue and power—whose conduct is boundless—go against Heaven and Earth, thus becoming their adversaries; they disrupt yin and yang, thus becoming their thieves.\n\nDo you understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nGo forth, ask no more—good and evil are plain to see.\nYes, yes.\n\nGo, for you are troubled; let me now distinguish and explain the conduct of the ancients.\nPeople each day claim to be kind and well-versed in affairs, yet their actions betray them—monthly virtue turns to evil.\nMonth by month, each claims to have done good, to have betrayed no trust in Heaven, yet year after year they meet with disaster, misfortune, and untimely death.\nIn youth, all declare themselves virtuous, even surpassing their fathers and mothers in worth; yet as they age, not a single good deed remains—those once deemed worthy become the unworthy, poor and base, their days few, none knowing the true Dao.\n\nThus, in this later age, good and evil, worthy and unworthy, are revealed—why boast of virtue and understanding?\nObserve the signs, and you shall know for yourself; you may discern truth from falsehood. Why argue further? The matter is already settled.\n\nThe Perfected One presents these written words to awaken them, lest they remain lost in eternal delusion, becoming Heaven and Earth’s greatest adversaries.\n\nGo now; my words here are briefly concluded. If later you have doubts, return and we shall discuss them together.\nYes, yes.\n\n*Here concludes the collected difficult questions on the \"Tai Ping Decisions Regarding Sincere and Deceptive Conduct in Human Affairs.\"*\n*Thus ends Scroll Ninety-Three of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n*Thus ends Scroll Ninety-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n\nThe One Hundred Fifty-First Decision on the Six Ultimates and Six Culminations of Filial Piety, Obedience, and Loyalty\n\nPerfected One, you and I have long recorded my words and received the texts of the Heavenly Dao—could we have exhausted their vast divisions and boundaries? How many divisions does my Dao possess? What constitutes its ultimate? What constitutes its great culmination? Within these texts lies the Dao: the Six Ultimates and Six Culminations.\n\nFoolish student, I now speak of this, yet you do not know what the Six Ultimates and Six Culminations are. Alas! Your foolishness remains unopened, and your learning, though earnest, has not yet attained true refinement. Thus, you do not comprehend the Dao’s utmost reach. You have failed your Heavenly Master, and this fault cannot be absolved.\n\nDo not take offense. The Perfected One reproaches himself—how weighty is this matter!\n\nFoolish student, I have heard: if a child is unfilial, they cannot exhaust their strength in nourishing their parents; if a disciple is disobedient, they cannot exhaust their strength in illuminating their master’s Dao; if a minister is disloyal, they cannot exhaust their strength in reverently serving their lord. Failing in these three practices brings an ineradicable sin. Heaven and Earth detest them, ghosts and spirits harm them, and all people despise them. Even in death, their guilt lingers beneath the earth, for they are known as the unruly child of the three unvirtuous practices. Each month’s end and new moon’s dawn, they stand before Heaven, where the spirits who govern the rectification of yin and yang—those who uphold the order of honor and humility—cause their hun and po to grieve until their annihilation is complete.\n\nThus, knowing your lack of refinement, you bear an unabsolved transgression against your master.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nWhence did you receive these words?\" \"I received them from my former master.\" \"Moreover, this foolish student once glimpsed the Celestial Master expounding them. Having received the Celestial Master’s teachings, I beheld the celestial patterns and saw that Heaven and Earth are the parents of the four seasons and five phases. If the four seasons and five phases do not exhaust their strength in supplying what Heaven and Earth desire to generate, they become unfilial children, and the year yields scant good things, becoming an inauspicious year. People, too, are children of Heaven and Earth; if they do not diligently nurture what Heaven and Earth produce, they are called unfilial children.\n\nThus, those who favor the use of punishments cause their states to be constantly disordered, imperiled, and ruined. The myriad things follow the four seasons and five phases in their decline and flourishing, growing and nurturing themselves—they are their disciples. If they cannot exhaust their strength in following the seasonal qi to grow, mature, and reach their end, they become disobedient disciples, and the year’s things are harmed. People, instead, blame the seasonal qi for disharmony, compounding the transgression of the seasons.\n\nThe people are the disciples of the sages and worthies. Now, foolish disciples recklessly steal and forcibly expound, causing sages and worthies to bear fault—this is called collectively disrupting and rebelling against the Dao of Heaven. Their sin is most grave and cannot be pardoned. Thus, this foolish student’s transgressions remain unabsolved.\n\nWind and rain are the loyal ministers of Heaven and Earth. Receiving Heaven’s mandate, they jointly circulate qi and distribute moisture. If they fail to harmonize and equalize, causing the world to be uneven, it is like a minister receiving the mandate of an emperor or king, turning against superiors and toward inferiors, using their intentions without balance. Many ministers together act disloyally and deceptively, collectively deceiving their superiors, causing the world to be turbulent with frequent disputes and the state’s governance to be imperiled and disordered.\n\nThese three matters—children being unfilial, disciples being disobedient, and ministers being disloyal—are sins that admit no pardon. Heaven detests them intensely, Earth loathes them deeply, regarding them as great affairs and grave calamities. Ghosts and spirits severely condemn them, thus they are the most vile and base conduct.\n\nAlas! A perfected one long possessing wisdom yet feigning foolishness causes me to recklessly expound, speaking beyond what Heaven and Earth would allow. What I have said does not compare to what you have just uttered, which is profound and far-reaching. This foolish student’s thoughts have now reached this point, and I can say no more. Great humility—yet even this does not err. To be lowly yet not humble is also a grave transgression.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nThus, this foolish student, as a disciple, cannot clarify the boundaries of the master’s Dao. Knowing my transgressions are grave, I expound upon the celestial patterns to reproach myself.\n\n\"Excellent are your words! I, too, have nothing to add. Now, comparing your words to mine, you have already understood yourself. The boundaries of the written teachings are indeed beyond my reach. Yet if you truly fall short, I will provide a detailed explanation for you, arranging them in order with distinct boundaries, so that they may never be forgotten for ten thousand generations.\n\nNow, the perfected one speaks of the three disobedient and unrefined practices, saying that hun and po appear for judgment—this is most ingenious. From whom did you receive this oral teaching? It is like the Celestial Master recounting matters from the former master, who himself spoke of the admonitions of the perfected ones of high antiquity. This foolish student, upon hearing these words, also saw them in the Celestial Master’s written texts, thus confirming them again.\n\nWhen this foolish student questioned the perfected ones of high antiquity, I was uncertain and had doubts. Yet the words of the perfected ones of high antiquity are correct—I have nothing to add. Now, I wish to ask the Celestial Master about this meaning.\n\nProceed, listen clearly.\n\nThus, at the end of the month and the end of the year, not only do the hun and po of those who were unfilial, disobedient, and disloyal in life appear for judgment, but so do the spirits of Heaven and Earth. Heaven takes fifteen days as a minor boundary, so the moon reaches its fifteenth day and then slightly recedes. A month is taken as a middle boundary, and a year as a great boundary.\n\nAll the spirits and essences between Heaven and Earth together assist Heaven in generating, nurturing, and maturing the twelve thousand things, thus all spirits and essences receive their emoluments. It is like many worthy ministers assisting the emperor or king in nurturing and maturing the common people and the myriad things, all receiving their emoluments.\n\nThus, following Heaven’s model, there is a minor reckoning every fifteen days, a middle reckoning every month, and a great reckoning every year. Those with great merit are promoted and elevated; those without merit are demoted and dismissed, completing the governance. Those who disrupt governance are the perverse and evil spirits.\n\nThe perverse and evil spirits act accordingly, so the hun and po of those who were unvirtuous in life appear together for judgment. The hun and po of good people refuse to serve them. Thus, the hun and po of those who were rebellious, unfilial, disobedient, and disloyal serve them, collectively disrupting Heaven’s patterns and defiling Heaven’s governance. Therefore, the evil spirits are seized and governed, and their guests are also seized and governed. It is like rebellious and evil ministers committing outrages, so that their guests also bear guilt—this is what is meant.\n\nExcellent, excellent! This foolish student now understands.\"\n\nThus, while alive, as a child one must be filial, as a subject one must be loyal, and as a disciple one must be obedient. When filial piety, loyalty, and obedience never leave one’s person, then after death the hun, po, spirit, and essence will not be summoned for judgment.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHow astonishing! How astonishing! Now, only through the Celestial Master’s gracious compassion, revealing the celestial patterns in their fullness, do I dare not abandon the Way midway. I only wish to be shown the written decrees and the boundaries of the departments’ reach.\n\nThe general outline of your question I shall still answer. Were I not to speak, it would be called begrudging the study of the Dao’s work, halting its transmission, and thus incurring Heaven’s displeasure.\n\nVery well. Let the Six Perfected Ones be seated at ease, and I shall distinguish them for you. Their departments number six in all, belonging to one great collection.\n\nThose who guard the One follow their kind, and from ancient times to the present, those who guard the One share great commonality in their texts. The greatly worthy, upon seeing my writings, guard and practice them without ceasing. By refining them, they grasp their essential meaning—those who study in youth may become filial children, those who study in maturity may become loyal subjects, and those who study until old age, never ceasing or slackening, may all attain deliverance from the world.\n\nThere are yet further refinements: if one practices without cessation, one may even penetrate the six directions and eight limits. When all affairs are complete, what could be lacking? Above, one may then assist the virtuous Imperial Lords, together stabilizing Heaven and Earth. Their grace descends to reach even the grasses and trees. All things in the teeming multitude are thus brought to perfect order.\n\nHeaven and Earth rejoice in this, and the Emperor’s reign is prolonged in ease. Only the sounds of zithers and lutes, singing and music, remain—no further sorrows endure.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThose of middling virtue who maintain their practice, exerting effort in their conduct, reflecting upon its meaning day and night, may yet become filial children in youth and loyal ministers in maturity, aiding the state to achieve Great Peace. All under Heaven will submit, none failing to praise their goodness.\n\nExternally cautious and internally sincere, each examines and corrects themselves, daring not betray Heaven and Earth, nor deceive their superiors. When many worthies join in concerted effort, enabling the ruler’s governance, their rule becomes akin to Heaven, their conduct mirroring the celestial Way. Their kindness and love extend downward even to grasses, trees, mosquitoes, and gnats—all things find their proper place.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhen the common people uphold and study these teachings, striving together in practice, mutually encouraging goodness and unity, they cannot restrain themselves. Fathers become kind, mothers loving; children filial, wives obedient; elder brothers virtuous, younger brothers respectful. Neighbors and villages all delight in doing good, no longer harboring malice, theft, or mutual harm.\n\nWhen all people rejoice in loyalty, obedience, and filial piety, aspiring to emulate the middling and great worthies, the people no longer commit evil. Each household and individual disciplines and governs themselves, so that order may be maintained without punishments. When the high, the middling, and the low all practice this, Great Peace is established throughout the world without delay.\n\nDo you understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGuard the One in Solitude, Know the Divine Precepts, One Hundred Fifty-Two\n\nThus, the Dao of guarding the One gathers those who have guarded the One from ancient times to the present, assembling them by kind. The supremely worthy, with clarity and effort, may transcend the world; the middling worthy, with effort, may become good ministers and virtuous officials to emperors and kings; even the petty, with effort, may remain free from joy and anger, so that the world bears no resentment or blame. This is the foremost and greatest boundary of my writings.\n\nFearing that the common people, long sunk in ignorance, remain deluded and do not trust my words, I therefore instruct them to compare and align with the writings of those who have guarded the One from ancient times to the present, grouping them by kind to mutually verify one another.\n\nExcellent, excellent indeed. The foolish student humbly awakens.\n\nNow, as for guarding the One: the great person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; the middling person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; even the petty person who guards it finds it more than sufficient. When all three kinds of people guard and practice it together, its goodness permeates the six directions and eight distant realms, its kindness and love equaling that of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs for the most foolish, those who take no joy in guarding and practicing it are called the most wicked and violent people in the world. Heaven and Earth detest them, and ghosts and spirits no longer protect them.\n\nWhen people persistently do not pursue profit, this is the method by which the celestial writings distinguish good and evil. Those who delight in reading and studying are known by Heaven as good people; those who show no desire to study are known by Heaven as wicked and violent—this is one and the same principle. Judging people by this, not one in ten thousand will be mistaken.\n\nI compose these writings for the Virtuous Lord of the Highest Power, upholding Heaven above, Earth below, and the Virtuous Lord in between, without deceiving the Perfected Ones. Those who guard this and grasp its meaning have completed the Dao in full.\n\nLet the Six Perfected Ones deeply ponder its meaning, for I cannot exhaustively record all its goodness.\n\nThe One is the very throat and heart of the Supreme Dao. The superior scholar delights in its virtue; the middling scholar echoes its knowledge; the inferior scholar detests and reviles it. Do you understand this? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThus, when the superior scholar attains it, great joy arises, and they cannot restrain themselves from acting; when the middling scholar attains it, they cannot cease, ever desiring to speak of it with delight; when the inferior scholar encounters it, it becomes their greatest taboo. Observing these three types of people through my writings, the distinction between good and evil in the world becomes clear. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThese writings are Heaven’s contract for rectifying the hearts of ordinary people, for eliminating the lingering disasters of inherited burdens from past generations, for resolving Heaven’s afflictions, and for lifting the inherited transgressions of the Virtuous Lord of the Highest Power. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed. Excellent, excellent! Go forth—you have awakened.\n\nAs for the two divisions of the boundary: those who read my writings on the Dao, aligning them with past and present and categorizing them by kind, grasp their essential meaning. The most worthy and enlightened rejoice in them unreservedly, unable to restrain themselves from doing good. They may even dare to enter thatched chambers, steadfastly guarding the teachings without fail, and will surely transcend the world and depart. Their aspirations merge completely with the divine spirits, no longer seeking praise in worldly affairs. Their goodness thoroughly governs Heaven and Earth, and their spirit aids Heaven and Earth, further assisting the Emperor in transforming evil. Their grace extends downward to the grasses and trees, and no being, however small, fails to receive the transforming influence of their virtue.\n\nThus, the wise and virtuous masters of antiquity who aided Emperors in achieving Great Peace were all such people. Their words and deeds were entirely in accord with goodness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, for they had received the teachings of virtuous masters of the Dao. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nAs for those of middling worth who diligently read my writings, aligning them with the Daoist texts of past and present and categorizing them by kind, persistently studying without cease—the more worthy among them may ascend to become the Emperor’s good ministers and virtuous officials, aiding the Virtuous Lord in transforming evil. Their grace extends downward to the smallest grasses and trees, harmonizing yin and yang so that no more strife arises. The Emperor may wander at leisure without cares, while all ministers and subordinates teach and strive together, all in accord with goodness, loyalty, and trustworthiness. Governance is achieved without punishments, and their goodness cannot be fully recorded. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nWhen all the common people together study my writings and Daoist texts, their understanding flows freely from high to low, their strategies unite as one, and none remain who know how to commit evil. They examine and collate the Daoist texts of past and present, arranging them by category to illuminate one another, and take these as the learning of the age, passing them from father to son without end.\n\nAs the three ranks—great worthies, middling worthies, and lesser worthies—along with the common people all engage in this practice, the malign qi of Heaven and Earth is entirely dispelled, and no further suffering from karmic inheritance remains. Goodness then harmonizes yin and yang, the auspicious qi of Heaven and Earth emerges in full, and they roam through the imperial capital—this is the sign of the joy and delight of the August Heaven and Revered Earth.\n\nThus, those who study my writings should scrutinize them carefully, from the highest to the lowest, pondering their essential meaning, grasping their secrets, and becoming no different from the divine luminaries. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nAs for the three divisions of the realm: when many attain the Dao, they see spirits and can command them. The most enlightened among the great worthies govern ten out of ten perfectly and may serve as the Emperor’s ministers, those who ward off evil and dispel wickedness. Some, after long practice, may enter the thatched chamber and transcend, no longer entangled in worldly affairs.\n\nOnly after guarding the One can one fully discern good and evil, faults and failings; only then can one guard the Dao. Only after entering the thatched chamber for refined cultivation can one guard the spirits—thus, this is the third rank. The worthy obtain and collate the divine texts of past and present to verify one another. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe middling worthy, by guarding the One and entering the Dao, may also personally witness the divine governance of nine out of ten and serve as a great minister to kings and lords, together dispelling evil. After long practice, they too may hope to enter the thatched chamber. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe lesser worthy, by guarding the One and entering the Dao through study, may also witness divine governance in eight out of ten cases and serve alongside the common people to dispel evil and remove harm. They too should collate and verify ancient and modern Daoist texts to confirm their own understanding—only then will the foolish gain clarity and fully believe in the Dao. If one merely reads a single scroll without conviction, they will not only disbelieve but may even speak against it, justifying their own doubts. Thus, evil will daily arise, bringing harm to others. If the great worthy, the middling worthy, the lesser worthy, and the common people all guard the divine Dao and practice it together, then the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons will all flourish, and evil will naturally vanish. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIn this way, the spirits of the world above and below, of the four directions, the six relations, and the six kinships will all rejoice and flourish, aiding people to bring fortune and dissolve evil harm. Above, they will remove disasters and illnesses for emperors and kings; in the middle, they will cure ailments for the worthy; below, they will dispel malevolent qi for the common people, preventing wicked ghosts and spirits from acting. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThere must be great secrets and precepts to see the spirits and divine affairs. To say one is accurate in ten out of ten cases is to align with the spirits of Heaven; to say nine out of ten is to align with the spirits of Earth; to say eight out of ten is to align with the spirits of humanity. Beyond this, such words are unreliable. Some may initially see spirits and be perfectly aligned, yet over time grow increasingly inaccurate—this is the Dao of spirits testing them, causing their inaccuracy. If they recognize this and renew themselves, earnestly correcting their faults and striving for purity without evil intentions, their conduct will daily improve. They may then meet the spirits’ expectations, achieving perfect accuracy or even surpassing it, or hitting one in ten with ever-increasing precision. Such are those who daily cultivate goodness and grasp the intent of the Dao. Thus, it is called progress. Using this to divine for oneself, one will not err in ten thousand cases.\n\nSome may initially see spirits and divine inaccurately, yet later reverse course and achieve great accuracy—these are people who refine their understanding of the Dao’s intent and daily advance. Others may remain unchanged, neither progressing nor regressing—these are those whose dedication does not deepen. Those who daily decline are the indolent. Divining thus, one fails to grasp the Dao’s intent. Those who are tested and remain unaware, stubbornly persisting in evil, will be collectively deceived by the spirits. They will be led into depravity, bringing unpredictable fortune and misfortune, falling into heretical teachings, or suffering from lingering illnesses.\n\nThus, the great worthy, the middling worthy, the lesser worthy, and all common men and women who practice the Dao must use this to divine for themselves, never erring—for the divine Dao tests people. All matters under Heaven are subject to trial and failure. Heaven and Earth test people, so humans, in imitation of Heaven and Earth, also test one another. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nDo you wish to further know the great truth and evidence of the mutual resonance between the Dao of Heaven, the divine spirits, and the people? When their intentions align and their hearts are in accord, sincerity and trust prevail; when their intentions diverge, deception arises. Thus, in high antiquity, people’s sincerity and trust aligned, so superiors and inferiors did not deceive one another. In middle antiquity, half were misaligned, so half deceived one another. In later antiquity, none believed, so superiors and inferiors made deception their sole affair. Thus, in high antiquity, all undertakings succeeded; in middle antiquity, half succeeded; in later antiquity, none succeeded, leading to peril and ruin.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old constantly used this to divine whether they had attained resonance or not, ensuring no mistakes. With this, I admonish you, Perfected One. I see you constantly toil in hardship, so I deeply caution you—you are to serve as the eternal emissary of Heaven and Earth, resolving the flowing disasters of Heaven and Earth and removing harm for rulers. Your merit is immense and nearly unmatched. I fear you may grow indolent in your practice of the Dao, so I use these divine matters to warn you. If you serve as the emissary of Heaven and Earth and daily encounter fortune, it is because you have grasped the intent of Heaven and Earth. If you daily encounter misfortune, decline, and evil, it is because you have lost their intent.\n\nIn your interactions with the Dao and the spirits, if your days are fortunate and good, it is because you have grasped the Dao’s intent. If your days are misfortunate and declining, it is because you have lost the Dao’s intent. In your interactions with others, if your relationships daily grow deeper and kinder, it is because your intentions align. If they daily turn hostile and cold, it is because your intentions have diverged. Consider farming: those who harvest abundant, fine grain have applied careful attention and great effort. Those who harvest little, poor grain have been careless and exerted little effort. Even plants and trees respond to the diligence or negligence of human effort—how much more so the spirits of Heaven and Earth and humanity? Can you not be cautious?\n\nPerfected One, this admonition may seem slight and insignificant, but if you deeply ponder it, you will find it profoundly weighty. This is precisely the gateway to safety or peril, fortune or misfortune. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nI, the foolish one, have awakened—how solemn the charge, how solemn the charge!\n\nNow, the virtuous and enlightened, as paragons of supreme virtue and sovereigns, have collated and examined the writings of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, arranging them by category to mutually verify one another. Thus, the Dao/Way is rectified in a single day, no different from the sun and moon. They further gathered and assembled the great worthies, middling worthies, lesser worthies, and even the spoken testimonies of men and women among the people, again arranging them by category and cross-verifying them. The written texts then align perfectly, as if fitting a double compass to a square—without the slightest discrepancy.\n\nThe strategies of Heaven, Earth, and humanity converge as one. In this way, the sentiments of Heaven, Earth, and humanity are all encompassed, and the twelve thousand things follow likewise. Therefore, the sovereign of virtue must exert great effort in this endeavor, and calamities will depart in a single day. The world will govern itself, free of any remnant of perverse texts or corrupt words. Once all is purified and rectified, no vestige of perverse qi remains.\n\nFor perverse texts and corrupt words are the root of disasters. If you wish to further comprehend their clear and trustworthy effects, consider this: when someone records perverse texts against a ruler, or when someone slanders with corrupt speech, resentment and blame arise daily in abundance. People then turn to mutual resentment and slander, and the ruler, listening to these, strays from the correct path. His wisdom and clarity become obstructed, incurring the disapproval of Heaven and Earth, and his governance falters with inauspicious words.\n\nMoreover, those below may use perverse texts and corrupt speech to deceive and confuse their superiors. Over time, when this is discovered above, ruler and ministers will likewise blame one another. Thus, perverse texts and corrupt words arrive daily, serving as the gateway to misfortune and evil. Therefore, one must vigorously collate and expunge them.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThus, when a virtuous ruler fully employs correct speech, the calamities and perils of inherited burdens since the opening of Heaven and Earth are entirely dispelled, and no further disasters arise. Perfected One, do you wish to further comprehend its great truth?\n\nIndeed, correct texts and correct speech serve as the fundamental root of the Dao, Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things. Therefore, the great sages and worthies of high antiquity, who acted in accordance with correct texts and correct speech, found Heaven and Earth aligned with their correctness, the Three Luminaries aligned with their correctness, the four seasons and Five Phases aligned with their correctness, the people and all things aligned with their correctness. Thus, correct texts and correct speech are the great and efficacious root of correctness for Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things.\n\nDo you wish to further clarify and understand its truth? Consider this: when someone praises a ruler with correct texts and correct speech, the ruler gains great wisdom and great clarity. In all undertakings, nothing strays from correctness. Above and below thus attain the will of Heaven and Earth; the Three Luminaries do not deviate from their courses; the four seasons and Five Phases do not err. The people are all joyful, exclaiming, \"Excellent!\" The myriad things each find their proper place. Grace extends to the spirits and deities, and one’s fame spreads to distant lands. The host of spirits and auspicious omens emerge in delight. The worthy and learned of the world all gladly come to assist their ruler, and nothing remains concealed. Immortals and divine spirits then bestow upon him the methods of agelessness. Demonic influences are eradicated, and the people govern themselves. With correct texts and correct speech, no mutual resentment arises, and blame is entirely cut off.\n\nAll goodness emerges in the world, while all perversity and evil conceal themselves. The virtuous ruler need only sit with folded hands, and governance proceeds of itself—what worry of peril or ruin remains? This is the clear proof and efficacy of my correct texts and correct speech as the root of goodness. How could one not strive to uphold correctness? Perfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nHow astonishing! Having heard the Heavenly Master’s words, I am now profoundly awakened. This foolish one now knows the world has already attained Great Peace. If the virtuous ruler heeds and applies them, his life will be prolonged. Excellent! You may truly be called one who understands affairs—a student who has thoroughly grasped the Way.\n\nJoyful, oh joyful! The Heaven’s anxieties are resolved, and the Earth’s afflictions are removed. Perfected One, how do you know this? Indeed, all perversity and evil are now destined to be eradicated, and the great afflictions of Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things have been eliminated. Now that the correct texts and correct speech have been compiled and rectified, we know the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth are gone.\n\nExcellent, excellent! You have indeed fully understood. If the emperor and kings diligently practice my texts, they will align with the profoundness of Heaven and Earth, and no further calamities will befall them. Excellent, excellent! These are the most essential words to convey to the Perfected One.\n\nWhen a ruler of supreme virtue obtains my texts, Heaven’s patterns and images will govern his ministers—from divine transcendents above to the lowliest and most humble below, encompassing these nine ranks: divine immortals, perfected transcendents, Daoist sages, worthies, scholars, common folk, servants, and slaves. Among these nine, those who possess true faith, loyalty, and goodness, who delight in the authentic Dao and come to assist the virtuous ruler—all should be questioned regarding their abilities and appointed accordingly. Take care never to assign them roles unsuited to their capacities, nor to dismiss them unjustly.\n\nThose who resist are called \"obstructive people.\" With diligent and devoted hearts, Heaven is not human, yet it acts according to evidence and entrusts them with tasks, each questioned regarding their particular strengths—thus, nothing will remain ungoverned. The virtuous ruler should test them: those who daily produce good results should be promoted, with no oversight; those who prove ineffective should be swiftly dismissed. These are called \"defilers of Heaven’s offices,\" preventing the arrival of correct *qi* and placing blame upon such wicked people.\n\nThe truly good, with hearts ever inclined to secretly assist and worry over all matters, are called \"those who bring forth true goodness.\" The wicked, with perverse hearts, do not wish to secretly aid or benefit any affair—thus they bring forth wickedness. This is the natural standard and law of August Heaven. Therefore, they must be dismissed at once. If not dismissed, they will provoke Heaven’s wrath, causing the Earth to emit killing *qi*. Thus, they must be swiftly removed—this is a matter of great importance.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe foolish truly fear this. If you know to fear it, you may be called one who understands the affairs of life, and Heaven will protect you.\n\n—It is not so, it is not so.\n\nThere is no room for refusal here. It is not I who cause you to be protected by Heaven; by doing good, you naturally attain it. Thus, the conduct of the sages of old never dared stray from the plumb line, for they observed Heaven’s warnings and clearly discerned good and evil, each for their own sake. Therefore, they constantly sought to govern alongside the worthy, ever fearful of provoking Heaven. To offend Heaven is to have no recourse in prayer.\n\nThus, the ancient emperors and kings, with minds clear and penetrating, dared not recklessly collaborate with fools in governance, and so they alone enjoyed enduring good fortune. Perfected One, do you understand?\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nSince the middle antiquity, half of humanity has been foolish, regarding selection and appointment as minor matters, failing to examine them carefully. Half the time, they obtain the wrong persons, half the time they disrupt Heaven’s offices, and half the time governance turns inauspicious. In later antiquity, inheriting the negligence of the middle era, they further allowed matters to proceed with ease, again failing to examine them carefully. In selections and appointments, they often fail to secure the right people, defiling Heaven’s offices. The Three Luminaries become unaligned because of this, and the evidence appears in the heavens—Heaven is displeased. Thus, inauspicious years persist without end, and when they briefly cease, they arise again. Yet people do not deeply reproach themselves, instead blaming the times and fate.\n\nIn ancient times, when such things occurred, the Way of Heaven was not at fault. Yet people, in their excess, attributed blame upward to Heaven, while the foolish below did not reflect on their own transgressions. Instead, they repeatedly joined together to shift responsibility, laying fault upon the emperors and kings. Heaven names such people \"greatly rebellious subjects.\" The fault lies below, yet they deceive their superiors, calling evil good and good evil, collectively bringing about these disasters, then shifting blame upward to Heaven. Those who shift blame to Heaven further reproach their ruler. Such utterly perverse ministers and subjects are without justification.\n\nNow, the spirits of Heaven and Earth together detest them, so Heaven has personally dispatched me to descend and, for the Virtuous Lord, renew the system of laws. In selecting and appointing people to official positions, one must be meticulous and thorough. Perfected One, do you wish to know how to scrutinize these wicked ministers and subjects?\n\nConsider a household where parents raise several children. The children together deceive their parents, behaving wickedly. The parents, sitting silently in a room, know of their children’s violent and thieving conduct, yet the people instead collectively blame the parents: \"The parents are evil, so they bore evil children.\" When the county officials apprehend them, they do not justly execute the wicked children but instead repeatedly blame the parents.\n\nParents, in raising children, always desire them to be worthy and good. When have they ever wished for their children to behave wickedly? To shift blame back to the parents is to be a greatly rebellious and unfilial child.\n\nThe ruler’s relationship to his ministers is the same: he always desires them to do good. When has he ever taught them to do evil? Yet the ministers and subjects below collectively engage in violent and wicked conduct, bringing disasters from Heaven and Earth, then shift blame back to reproach their ruler, causing the common people to suffer hardship. Thereupon, cunning officials also join in reproaching Heaven, calling this \"ministers and subjects collectively committing rebellion.\" The crime cannot be absolved.\n\nThey exhaust their reproach of the ruler, and when the situation becomes dire, they further shift blame upward to Heaven and downward to Earth. Such is the rebellion of humanity—should their lives not be shortened and they not be swiftly executed?\n\nThus, in later antiquity, all have met with truncated destinies, their lives and deaths untimely. It is like a household wishing to slaughter livestock: if they suddenly decide to kill, they kill at once. Even good livestock are pitied in death, while wicked livestock are left to die of illness.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe foolish and ignorant deeply revere the majesty of Heaven. You, disciple, have now awakened. Bring forth this text and have the virtuous ruler display it to all worthy scholars. Take heed not to conceal Heaven’s joy—release it with utmost urgency.\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nLet me impart to you, Perfected One, a matter of great importance. When a ruler of great virtue employs ministers, each assigned to their proper place and aligned with the heart of Heaven, they must then know the arts of governing the people and eliminating harm. Yet those who dwell in distant regions, concealed and hidden, are exceedingly difficult to know. The benighted masses, each seeking their own advantage, instead deceive their virtuous ruler. It is incumbent upon the wise and enlightened to correct this together, for only when all is rectified will the heart of Heaven and Earth rejoice greatly, ensuring the emperor’s enduring fortune.\n\nHeaven, in its wisdom, knows that the people of later ages are foolish and difficult to govern. Thus, it has deliberately issued this written covenant, called the *Celestial Writ*. The nature of writing is to make things manifest and clear, so that all under Heaven may record matters and act in accordance. It serves to document the writings of all people, not for the sake of a single, solitary individual. Therefore, all under Heaven use it to record every affair.\n\nThe sages employ it to record the patterns of Heaven and Earth, while the worthy use it to preserve the words of the sages. All people must study and read it together, only then can they grasp its meaning. The categories of writing are such that they must be collectively examined, collectively deliberated, collectively recorded, and collectively recited, so that deceit may be eliminated.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, the writings of the worthy and sagely—how many have been collated, how many transmitted, how many verified, how many collectively preserved—still inevitably contain residual errors and misleading phrases that cannot be entirely eradicated. Therefore, the great worthies and masters of the Dao traverse the world, scrutinizing words and studying speech, comparing differences to enlighten the ignorant. Yet even so, they may still mislead the innocent, causing them to recklessly expound their learning, rendering them unfit for office and unworthy to serve as ministers to the emperor.\n\nThus, when a single original text proliferates into many chapters and sentences, divergent interpretations arise, throwing the Dao of Heaven and Earth into great disorder and confusion, thereby giving rise to the calamities of *chengfu*. Do you understand, Perfected One?\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, for you have awakened. Now listen further, and I shall tell you of a great precept.\n\nThe reason people of later ages have long lost the favor of Heaven, causing Heaven and Earth to remain in constant sorrow, is that rulers rely on solitary words and isolated judgments, verifying matters without truth, and thus greatly deviating from the clarity of their intent. Perfected One, if this persists, it leads the multitude of worthies throughout the world to collectively examine texts yet remain ignorant, all falling into misguided learning. Hence, calamities and anomalies arise without cease. Heaven deeply abhors this, giving rise to disorder and illness, where yin and yang engage in unending strife.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to descend and correct these errors through careful collation. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, people have trusted solitary words and isolated judgments, often regarding the scrutiny of subordinate texts as disrespectful. They collectively use this as a standard for blame, thereby relying on solitary words and isolated judgments to respond to and draft documents for governance, thus incurring Heaven’s resentment and disorder.\n\nHeavenly official documents were originally meant for people to collectively deliberate their right and wrong. Instead, they allow a single person to secretly compose the words. Even sages cannot alone fully comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the works of sages and worthies across generations differ, as Heaven has stated that each excels in but one aspect and cannot entirely eliminate disasters. Thus, Heaven commanded me to gather and collate them all.\n\nNow, instead, they trust the words of one person—how can this be acceptable? Therefore, Heaven instructs that the Three Dao Documents be circulated, allowing the great and the small, the worthy and the unworthy, men and women, to collectively interweave and deliberate, jointly determining right and wrong, all ensuring the verification of truth. Only then may they be presented. If one among them seeks to deceive, it shall be recorded. In this way, the illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be eradicated, and the emperor will bear no *chengfu* responsibility.\n\nHeaven and Earth, free from illness, will rejoice. The emperor, secure in his rule, will rejoice. The worthy will attain self-realization and rejoice. The common people, freed from unjust suffering, will rejoice. Households will prosper, and people will be content, rejoicing. Servants and maids will find just masters and refrain from wrongdoing, rejoicing. The four seasons and five phases will proceed in harmony, and the people, cautious and untransgressive, will rejoice. The myriad things, each in its proper place and unharmed, will rejoice. Ghosts and spirits, witnessing the virtuous ruler’s accumulation of goodness, will also delight. Evil qi will no longer rise to obscure the heavens, and the sun, moon, and three luminaries will rejoice. The Supreme Peaceful Qi will come to govern, and the king, in his rule, will rejoice. Evil qi, once subdued and hidden, will no longer manifest to incite punitive expeditions, bringing joy. The barbarians will remain in their lands, no longer frequently waging war on Heaven’s behalf, rejoicing. Generals and commanders will rest their weapons, and soldiers will avoid death in battle, rejoicing.\n\nIn all between Heaven and Earth, such joys are too numerous to record. I, Perfected One, have outlined the great principles and shown their beginnings. Reflect on their meaning, and by analogy, you shall grasp all. When the virtuous ruler implements this, the world will submit in harmony.\n\nThus, Heaven particularly urges the circulation of these Three Daoist Writings—take heed not to abandon them again, lest disasters persist. To sever the celestial patterns is to revert to governance by the deaf and blind. Such governance is the root of chaos and peril, the calamity that destroys the self—how could one not be cautious?\n\nThese writings are what all under Heaven must jointly examine and practice; they cannot be trusted on the word of a single person. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, texts and human testimonies have been transmitted and cross-examined to verify their clarity. Without such verification, they cannot be practiced alone. To act solely on one person’s word is to court danger and ruin—this is the great loss and harm of the world.\n\nTherefore, my writings dare not tolerate solitary words or isolated phrases. Thus, I instruct the Perfected One to collate and compare ancient, middle, and recent texts to illuminate their coherence, and to gather and verify the testimonies of all under Heaven to confirm their covenants. Only then can all between Heaven and Earth be rectified, and the interactions of yin and yang remain free of affliction.\n\nExamine past and present celestial patterns, earthly spirit-writings, and human testimonies with my texts—they will surely resonate like an echo, indistinguishable from the divine. Only then can my Dao be deemed trustworthy. Thus, I do not speak of the Dao idly; I seek its trial in practice. Without practice, how can one know whether my Dao aligns with Heaven and proves true?\n\nToday, practice it, and it will be as if conversing with Heaven—ten out of ten, fifteen out of fifteen, with no omissions. Wondrous is the Dao when thus pursued! Truly, it may be called the greatest joy. Does the Perfected One understand? Indeed.\n\nProceed, and enlightenment will arise.\n\nI impart to the Perfected One a great secret: this begins with guarding the One, focusing on goodness to grasp its essence, thereby entering the Dao. Thus, I follow it with the writings on the Dao. Pursuing the Dao leads to entering the chamber, entering the true Dao, and entering the chamber requires knowledge of the divine—hence, I follow it with the divine precepts.\n\nHaving guarded the One, attained the Dao, and attained the divine, one may ascend to become a virtuous ruler or a worthy minister. Ministers must assist the virtuous ruler in harmonizing the six directions and eight realms of Heaven and Earth, grasping their essence so the nation may enjoy enduring peace.\n\nTo achieve this peace, one must rectify texts, words, and speech. Thus, collating and verifying writings and testimonies brings great rectification. Only then will the multitude of worthy scholars and superior gentlemen emerge to jointly assist the ruler, serving as his enlightened ears, eyes, and limbs. Hence, I follow this with the nine officials.\n\nWhen the nine officials each fulfill their roles, they will jointly harmonize Heaven and Earth, and all under Heaven will unite in purpose. They must constantly communicate, reporting good and ill—thus, I follow this with the Three Daoist Writings.\n\nOnce all have mastered guarding the One, entered the Dao, attained the divine, and embraced rectified texts, with officials of all ranks in their proper places, and once the six affairs of the writings are practiced in unison, all under Heaven will share one heart. None will dare to harbor hatred; all will love and benefit one another as if born of the same parents. Thus, the virtuous ruler deeply aligns with Heaven’s will, delighting in the absence of strife.\n\nFearing omissions in the Dao might leave Heaven and Earth’s writings incomplete, I further append the *Great Collection of Difficulties* to resolve doubts. The profoundest matters are placed below, and the complete writings are presented to be entrusted to the virtuous ruler. Should the world’s calculations shift even once, it will spontaneously govern itself for the better.\n\nThis ease is like fire ascending dry heights or water flowing downward—no instruction is needed, for it moves naturally and cannot be restrained. Thus, the teachings of the Great August Heavenly Dao will swiftly take effect. When the virtuous ruler practices them, he is called the Divine Son of Heaven, styled the Supreme August One, resembling the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, all spirits under Heaven may be commanded.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, there has never been a celestial scripture or divine text like this, transmitted by the Perfected One as a record of the true Dao. Entrusting it to the virtuous ruler, it is called the Mother of the Dao.\n\nThe qi of the Great Yang, the fire phase, exists within it. To practice it is to attain its truth; to neglect it is to render it unreal. Does the Perfected One understand? Indeed.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I entrust this to the careful stewardship of the people, delivering it to the virtuous ruler—dare not retain it long. Go forth, for you have already understood. The celestial scripture must not be kept long, lest the heavenly spirits examine men and bring misfortune. Take heed and depart. Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe Six Investigations harmonize with the Utmost Seven Boundaries, arranging texts by category so they align, eradicating all calamities and ushering in the auspicious writings of the Utmost Extremity.\n\n**Enduring Humiliation, Emulating Heaven and Earth’s Utmost Sincerity, and Resonating with the Spirits: The Great Precept, One Hundred Fifty-Three**\nThe Perfected One steps forward. Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow I shall impart to you one great precept. Our Dao is for governing Heaven and Earth, pacifying emperors and kings, and giving life to what Heaven and Earth cherish—thus, one must cherish the true Dao and true virtue. Therefore, Heaven is the truth of the Dao, the warp of the Dao, the faithfulness of the Dao, the means by which the Dao operates through interdependence. Earth is the chief of virtue, the weft of virtue, the foundation by which virtue comes to rest through interdependence. Thus, it endures as the mother of the myriad things, constantly enduring humiliation by dwelling below, never boasting of its toil and hardship.\n\nAs the virtuous ruler, I instruct the benighted below, taking these two matters of Heaven and Earth as my foundation. Thus, I always follow the laws and measures of Heaven and Earth, never deviating from their gateway. My writings are the words of Heaven conversing with Earth, deeply and uniquely resonating with the spirits, like outer and inner. Each step follows the other, like compass and square. Those who proceed in accord gain the intent of Heaven and Earth; those who lose it meet with misfortune and decline.\n\nNow I precept you, Perfected One—ponder my words and ever be vigilant. Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth. Seeing your devotion to true Dao and virtue, your goodness unmatched, I shall reveal one further word. Now, the superior person delights greatly in the true Dao and good virtue; the middling person is half-inclined toward them; the inferior person, devoid of form, utterly lacks Dao and virtue—all are those who commit great rebellion and defy the Dao. The greatly inauspicious, those without virtue, stand alone within Heaven and Earth, unrecognized and unknown, not beloved by Heaven’s constancy. Thus, those without Dao and virtue have no mandate under Heaven and Earth, sharing the same fate and fortune as birds and beasts.\n\nNow, if you do not understand, I shall tell you the essential meaning. Very well—Perfected Six, listen clearly.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, Heaven is purely of the Dao, Earth purely of virtue. These people without Dao and virtue share no resemblance to Heaven and Earth. Heaven’s movement ought to embody the true Dao, favoring the manifestation of life. Earth ought to embody good virtue, favoring nurturance and growth. Now, those without Dao and without virtue—thus Heaven and Earth do not pardon them.\n\nTo know this with clear certainty: consider how those of Dao recognize others of Dao, and those of virtue recognize others of virtue, each gathering and embracing their own. Thus their destinies are mutually sustained. Therefore, those of Dao delight in elevating others of Dao, and those of virtue delight in elevating others of virtue. Those with Dao and virtue do not align with those without Dao and virtue, and so refuse to gather or embrace them—thus their destinies are not bound to Heaven.\n\nExcellent, excellent. You wish to hear the meaning of sharing the same fate as birds and beasts. Well said—you have deeply grasped this principle.\n\nNow, the destinies of birds and beasts are bound to the four directions. Their nature is to butt and clash, devoid of Dao and virtue, with the stronger prevailing. The ignorant and base among people, also devoid of Dao and virtue, likewise delight in clashing and contending, with the stronger prevailing. Their qi is the same as that of birds and beasts—thus they share the same fate.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven serves as the standard, by which the superior and inferior among people are distinguished. Thus this is known.\n\nNow, all named destinies under Heaven follow their kind. Thus one knows to which destiny they belong. Those who embody the Five Natures in abundance resemble yang and are benevolent; those who embody the Six Passions in abundance resemble yin and are greedy. Those who receive more yang endowment become male; those who receive more yin endowment become female. Those who receive more of the flourishing qi are noble, honored, and long-lived; those who receive more of the waning, declining, or captive qi suffer frequent illness, die young, and live in extreme poverty.\n\nThus, for all who are born, their destiny is bound to the qi of which celestial movement they resemble, and to which of the Six Jia cycles their fate is tied. By classifying them accordingly, not one in ten thousand is misjudged.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity deeply investigated all matters and understood human nature through this. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nExcellent, excellent.\n\nNow, the people of this later age bear the burdens of their ancestors’ miscalculations, gradually severing the Dao and virtue together. Day by day, over long years, they cut themselves off from Heaven and Earth, their essence and qi no longer flowing through them. Unaware of their own destiny, they revert to sharing the fate of four-footed creatures. Thus, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the spirits and qi of the gods no longer protect them. Their illnesses are countless, their deaths untimely—this is the great fault that lies here...\n\nYet the ruler of supreme virtue, whose fate is bound to Heaven and Earth, must emulate them and govern through the Dao and virtue. Therefore, I have once more set forth the Way of Heaven and entrusted it to those above. Heaven delights in their goodness and does not wish them to persist in the ways of four-footed men. Thus, I reiterate these writings with utmost urgency, desiring that they awaken fully. Therefore, I have compiled the Six Calamities and the Great Collective Adversity to deliver and return them to their rightful place.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\nHow astonishing! How joyous, how joyous!\n\nPerfected One, how do you know what is so astonishing and joyous?\nWhen I, a foolish student, heard the Heavenly Master speak, I realized that when the true Dao and virtue emerge, the people transform in a single day. All will uphold the Dao and virtue, emulate Heaven and Earth, and no longer act as four-footed men. Each person will follow the Dao, each will embody virtue—thus I know the profound joy of this intent.\n\nExcellent, Perfected One! Your words are beyond improvement.\nNow, I wish to take this opportunity to ask the Heavenly Master one question.\nSpeak.\n\nWhen people seek the Dao and virtue, or when ordinary men act, what should they regard as their most urgent duty? How can they come to know it, and how can they resonate in response with Heaven and Earth?\n\nExcellent is your question! They must act with utmost sincerity, with the five inner organs true and sincere—only then can they attain it. If they do not act with the five inner organs true and sincere, they incur the resentment of the Dao and virtue. Seeking goodness will be in vain, and the spirits will not respond.\n\nNow, I wish to hear: how does utmost sincerity move Heaven and Earth and the gods?\nAlas! Perfected One, in this you are particularly foolish. Have you not yet grasped the texts I have written? Your ignorance is deep and long-standing—it cannot be dispelled in a single day. Yet you are also greatly humble. Listen carefully now, and I will explain the meaning of utmost sincerity moving Heaven and Earth.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\nHeed my words.\n\nUtmost sincerity is so named because one looks up to Heaven and acts, emulating the Way of Heaven. One looks down to Earth and acts, emulating the virtue of Earth. One reflects that Heaven and Earth, like parents, gave me life and do not wish me to delight in evil. Thus, one returns filial piety to the heart and acts accordingly.\n\nThe heart is the most revered spirit within the deepest recesses. The heart is sacred, the pure yang movement of fire. Fire moves upward, sharing the radiance of Heaven. Thus, the sun is the ruler of fire, the essence of Heaven, illuminating all without fail. When a person embodies utmost sincerity, the heart’s upright distress moves the sacred spirit of the heart, which then ascends to report to the sun. The sun, in turn, reports to Heaven. Thus, utmost sincerity within the five inner organs moves the spirits.\n\nHow can one not be cautious?\nPerfected One said: How awe-inspiring! How awe-inspiring! I, a foolish student, have overstepped in asking this—it fills me with great dread.\n\nTo know dread is the root of life. To be without dread is the gate of death. Safety and peril lie within yourself, not elsewhere. Though you ask the Heavenly Master repeatedly with fear and trembling, only by asking will you receive the decisive answer and profound understanding. Without asking, there would be no way to know.\n\nIndeed, your words are correct. If one remains in darkness and does not ask, when will clarity ever come? Speak—what else would you ask?\n\nNow that I have heard how utmost sincerity moves Heaven, I wish to hear how it moves Earth.\nExcellent! Your words grow ever deeper, and you spare nothing in your inquiry. Sit calmly, and I will explain it to you. I fear that if I do not speak, I may fail you.\n\nIt is as if Heaven itself grieves that later generations lack utmost sincerity, and thus sent the Perfected One to take up these questions.\nVery well.\n\nNow I will tell you—listen clearly.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth—when a person’s utmost sincerity takes hold of a thought, the heart aches with such pain that they cannot eat, their innards churning. What bears this thought is the heart, the mind; heart and mind do not forget. The liver is most benevolent, and so the eyes serve as its master, weeping tears—this is the utmost sincerity of concentrated thought. The heart is the essence of clarity. To hold a thought without ceasing is the work of the mind, of the spleen. The heart is pure yang, its station belonging to Heaven; the spleen is pure yin, its station belonging to Earth. When utmost sincerity fixes upon a single thought, the heart aches and tears flow. The heart commands the mind to direct the thought’s course, sending word to distant places. The mind is yin; when yin harbors sorrow, it must report to yang, thus ascending to inform the august spirits of Heaven. The spleen is yin, its home on Earth, and so it descends into the Earth to report. Thus Heaven and Earth shift on its behalf, and all spirits are moved by it.\n\nWould you know its great effect? I do not deceive you, Perfected One. Simply sit calmly in a secluded chamber, concentrate your heart and ponder the spirits—they will all come of their own accord. Is this not clear proof? This is the truth of utmost sincerity that I tell you; I have never spoken without method.\n\nThus, in seeking the Dao and virtue, all human conduct proceeds from utmost sincerity, and Heaven and Earth respond, spirits come to inform. Without utmost sincerity, one cannot move Heaven and Earth or stir the spirits. After the era of *chengfu*, people of later ages truly lacked faith, lacked utmost sincerity, and could not move Heaven and Earth. Together they deceived Heaven and Earth, and so the spirits ceaselessly harmed them.\n\nWould you hear how this is made clear? There is great evidence in the sun and moon. Now I would hear it. In later ages, people born of father and mother together neglected their parents, turned their backs on them—among ten thousand, not one was filial. Those who gained understanding from a teacher, who awakened and departed, then neglected their teacher, no longer treating them as their teacher, instead submitting to toil and hardship. Having risen from poverty and low station to wealth and nobility through their lord, they then turned to instruct their superiors, all joining in daily deception of those above. Among ten thousand, not one possessed sincerity and trustworthiness. The foolish masses together deceived the Three Bonds, acting in rebellion and without faith. Their transgressions were manifest, impossible to conceal below, all visible above to the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries. Thus Heaven and Earth deeply detested and despised them, cutting short their lives and bringing early death.\n\nIf one does not deeply reflect tenfold upon their grave transgressions, but instead weeps and wails in vain, calling Heaven cruel—what grievance is this? You bring suffering upon yourself; when has Heaven ever wronged you? How dreadful! Excellent, excellent. Foolish student, I have received your command.\n\nShould you uphold this as a solemn warning, then for ten thousand generations and beyond, you shall know no affliction.\n\nWith these words concluded, doubts arose once more, and the questioner returned. \"Yes, yes,\" he assented.\n\n**The Great Collection’s Difficulties on the Dao’s Utmost Sincerity and Heaven’s Admonitions, Shown to the Worthy**\n\n*End of Scroll Ninety-Six of the* Classic of Great Peace\n*Scroll Ninety-Seven of the* Classic of Great Peace\n\n**First: The Jealousy of the Dao’s Non-Transmission and the Recluse’s Aid to Transformation**\n\nA truly foolish and benighted one, whose ignorance daily worsens, unable to comprehend the profound and impenetrable, bows twice in reverence and asks: If I act upon one matter, my words will surely incur fault; yet if I do not ask, my foolish heart cannot resolve it alone.\n\n\"Go on, speak.\"\n\nThis foolish student has privately heard that the secret Dao and essential virtue are the treasures of Heaven and Earth, the rarest and most wondrous things under Heaven. Thus, they are called the \"Utmost Dao, not to be transmitted\"—for they are not what ordinary people should hear, speak, or employ. Yet now the Heavenly Master has fully opened the path of Great Peace learning, commanding all to expound the essential texts of Dao and virtue, forbidding concealment. He declares that those who hide them incur Heaven’s condemnation, a sin that persists even unto death and flows into later generations. All are to be granted the true Dao and secret virtue—is this not grand indeed?\n\nYet when the petty and the noble are not distinguished, this foolish one believes that the true Dao and secret virtue should not be heard, spoken, or used by small-minded people.\n\n\"Alas! You now speak thus, bearing a ten-thousandfold deathly guilt before the August Heaven and Earth, a guilt that shall never be absolved. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, later generations have grown ever more shallow, envying the Dao. Small-minded people sever the treasures of Heaven and Earth, and this loss has accumulated over time, giving rise to *chengfu* (inherited burdens), causing Heaven’s disasters to never cease. Thus, within Heaven and Earth, not a single year passes in peace; calamities, omens, and bandits abound, and the state is plunged into sorrow and suffering—all arising from this.\n\nWhat you now say is precisely the cause: it confounds Heaven and overturns Earth, plunging governance into chaos, making the people ungovernable. Precisely so.\n\nYou now speak thus—do you not heap heavy enmity upon Heaven? Wrong, wrong! Your merit is undone. How so?\n\nWhen the essential Dao and good virtue are revealed for instruction, even small-minded people, upon obtaining and upholding them, will emulate and learn from one another, daring not to act wrongly. Among them, the lesser worthy who gain good Dao and virtue may become upright and compliant officials. The greater worthy may ascend to assist the state. Even the most ignorant at the lowest level will still become good people.\n\nHeaven employs the essential true Dao to generate all things, extending even to the six domestic animals and birds. The four seasons and five phases are the true essential Dao of Heaven and Earth, their divine treasures, the stored *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The six domestic animals and birds embrace it as their nature; grasses and trees obtain it and then grow. If Heaven did not bestow the complete essential Dao, how could they generate and grow one another?\n\nYet you, True One, say that small-minded people should not hear the essential Dao, should not speak it, should not use it. Do the divine protectors of Heaven and Earth preserve all species, while humans alone are less good than the six domestic animals and grasses? You yourself know that what you now say incurs a ten-thousandfold deathly sin, never to be absolved.\n\nThis foolish student has served the master but briefly and shallowly, not deeply understanding the Way of Heaven. Upon hearing the Heavenly Master’s words, I now realize my grave sin: I have failed the August Heaven above, the Earth below, and the virtuous lord in between. Yet your self-reproach is justified.\n\nIn all undertakings, can one not be cautious? The August Heaven alone observes the words of people’s mouths—why else would echoes follow human voices to determine fortune or misfortune? Thus, echoes respond without missing a single *zhu* or *fen*. Have you never observed this proof of Heaven and Earth’s resonance?\n\nYou should be cautious where you fall short; do not force reckless speech, for its harm is grave.\n\nYou now say the Utmost Dao is not to be transmitted to people—then how is it to be known? If the Utmost Dao is ultimately untransmittable, and the Way of Heaven is impartial, for whom alone should it exist?\n\nThis disciple will be cautious and vigilant; my conduct has been most improper.\n\nDo you wish to be like the vulgar and small-minded, teaching others to envy the Way of Heaven? \"I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nTrue One, be meticulous in your vigilance. Once Heaven’s wrath is aroused, the sin incurred shall never be absolved. The Way of Heaven is precisely ruined by such words—do you now add to them?\n\nThat emperors and kings cannot govern their realms and frequently suffer disasters is entirely due to those like you. If you now speak thus, you cause the true Dao to be severed, heterodox ways to arise, and governance to become unmanageable.\n\nDo you understand? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI have awakened; I am ashamed to have failed the Heavenly Master.\n\nAlways be cautious in your conduct. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI often reflect that my words incur fault, and wish not to speak, yet I do not know.\n\nSpeak plainly.\n\nWhat is it that people should not hear, should not speak, should not use?\n\nIt is not that ordinary people should not hear the true essential Dao or true essential virtue. Thus, when inferior teachers instruct small-minded people, they do not employ the essential secret Dao and true virtue to admonish and teach them. Instead, they use superficial, false, and artful writings to instruct ordinary people. Among them, the greater worthy who learn these false and artful writings proceed to deceive their lords. The middling worthy who study false writings become cunning officials, flattering and deceiving their superiors above while craftily oppressing the good and compliant people below. The inferior and small-minded who obtain these writings act without principle, deceiving their parents, outwitting their neighbors, or becoming unstoppable bandits.\n\nThe worthy and unworthy, officials and commoners, all engage in deceit and falsehood, unable to restrain one another. Witnessing this heterodoxy and impropriety, they disrupt the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, harm the accomplishments of the five phases, and rebel against the nurturing of the four seasons. Together, they deceive their superiors, plunging the state into chaos. The harm is extreme, beyond recounting.\n\nYet you, True One, say that small-minded people should not hear the essential Dao and virtue, and should instead be taught with false and artful matters, causing the people under Heaven to be dazzled, to learn and practice falsehood unknowingly, and to become utterly without the Dao. Is this so?\"\n\nThus, the True One incurs the guilt of ten thousand deaths, a sin that cannot be absolved. What the world ought not hear, ought not speak, ought not employ—precisely this false literature, born of deceitful cunning and great treachery, arises from this. Therefore, I lay down the law for Heaven and establish teachings for the virtuous ruler, daring not to approach such matters, thereby exclusively opening the gate of the Dao and virtue while sealing off the paths of craft and deceit. Thus, my writings root themselves in the essence of the Dao and virtue, casting aside the methods of false texts and artful deceit, which are entirely excluded. Do you alone find this unremarkable?\n\nThis is deemed an affliction by Heaven and Earth, a harm by emperors and kings. I shall once more explain it fully to the True One: it concerns employing the essential Dao and virtue to instruct the small-minded. The most worthy may thereby uphold goodness and integrity; those of middling virtue and above may become the empire’s most virtuous ministers; those of lesser worth may be transformed into compliant and good officials; even the most foolish may still become cautious folk, unaware of how to harm one another.\n\nThus, from Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and constellations, all together nurture the myriad twelve thousand beings with the true Dao and essential virtue. Even the six domestic animals, dung, and grasses are clothed in its secret Dao and essential virtue, thereby attaining growth. Now, if the True One persists in such speech to the end, are such people not inferior to the six domestic animals, dung, and grasses?\n\nDo you now persist in speaking thus, unaware that your error is one of ten thousand deaths, a sin that cannot be erased? There is a deadly error, a deadly error. Do not feign ignorance—you simply fail to comprehend. What now is to be done about this error? To absolve it, on the day of purification, go to a vast wilderness where four roads meet, prostrate and kowtow in each of the four directions, performing five prostrations in each. First, gaze upward to Heaven, then turn and kowtow to the Earth. Assent, assent.\n\nNow, why does the Heavenly Master urgently instruct this foolish student? The urgency does not arise from the True One’s former status. Rather, the True One’s words violate the taboos of Heaven and Earth. Since the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, those who teach humanity have often been jealous of the true Dao and good virtue, instead teaching one another to flee and conceal it, to seal and cut it off, and to instruct with deceitful and cunning ways, leading the foolish into wrongdoing. The greatest worthies flee and withdraw from the world; only those of middling worth become officials, lacking the true Dao and thus disordering the people. The most foolish, devoid of the Dao, rise as bandits. When both people and ministers turn to heterodoxy, their clamor gathers like mosquitoes to shake the thunder, together rebelling against the celestial patterns, destroying the heavenly Dao, defying the will of Earth, reversing the qi of the four seasons, and disrupting the five phases. This gives rise to countless calamities and omens; the Three Luminaries lose their proper radiance; emperors and kings are plunged into great sorrow, falling into chaos and confusion, unable to govern in peace—all arising from this.\n\nDoes the True One truly not recognize the gravity of this sin? Heaven will not absolve it. If I do not instruct you, you must perform the rites of atonement.\n\nThus, one must conduct oneself in the wilderness, in places of clarity and brightness. The reason the Way extends in all four directions is that the Dao governs all affairs. The reason it extends in all directions is that it is entrusted to the four seasons, which Heaven employs to convey qi, thereby enabling you to ascend and commune with Heaven. The four seasons, benevolent in their generation and completion, also dissolve your transgressions before Heaven and Earth; all who later commit faults are but reflections of you.\n\nFrom this day forward, Heaven will severely punish those who do evil. Therefore, the noble person must always err on the side of great goodness and never on the side of great wickedness. Be cautious, be ever cautious. If even you act thus, how much more so the common and foolish? Mutual instruction breeds jealousy, and the Dao conceals itself—this is the way of things. What you have spoken is ever good.\n\nYet a single word today may be called a great rebellion against Heaven and Earth, the very sorrow that has afflicted rulers from ancient times to the present. Before you, True One, how could one be born a noble person? It is all through learning. To learn the Dao is to embody the Dao; to learn virtue is to attain it; to learn goodness is to become good; to learn the supreme Dao, goodness, and power is to live long into old age, ever increasing in virtue and excellence.\n\nThus, those who embrace the essential Dao, goodness, and power are called the recluses of emperors and kings, the foremost and most excellent of people, capable of aiding the noble in their transformation. Those who do not serve in office are the most reverent of people. Those who learn evil become evil; those who learn refinement become refined; those who learn deceit become deceitful; those who learn cunning become cunning.\n\nAmong those who learn, the most worthy may master eloquent speech, while those who study texts may craft artful writing. When petty people acquire such skills, they become treacherous. In your heart, can you truly refrain from teaching this? Therefore, the essential Dao and hidden power are what align with the heart of Heaven and the will of Earth, enabling the long-term peace of the state and bringing joy to emperors and kings. Yet they are suppressed and not vigorously promoted, so that when people offend Heaven, their sins remain unforgiven.\n\nHeaven acts through the supreme Dao, Earth dwells in supreme virtue, and together they generate the myriad things, concealing nothing and favoring none. Thus, the sages of antiquity modeled their conduct on Heaven and Earth, using the supreme Dao and essential power to instruct the foolish, making them reverent and good, so that governance became easy.\n\nIn this age, such teachings are often obstructed and severed, so the foolish collectively become treacherous. They lose the Dao of Heaven and do not recognize their own wrongdoing. The fault lies in the failure to practice the true Dao, goodness, and power, so people are frequently punished by Heaven, their deaths unforgiven. The foolish, lacking the Dao, disregard taboos and together violate Heaven and Earth, all because they do not know the essentials of Dao and virtue.\n\nThe reason I write these words, repeating and exhorting with such earnestness, is that I fear people will accumulate folly and, upon hearing a single word, fail to believe my text. Thus, I reiterate. People have long been accustomed to heterodoxy, and some may even call my words false. If the gates of the true Dao and hidden power are again severed and cease to function, Heaven’s wrath will not abate. Emperors will remain in sorrow, officials and people will have nowhere to turn, following one another into chaos, unable to save themselves. Test my words before Heaven, for they are precisely meant to resolve and dispel this fabricated Dao.\n\nPeople are all entangled in heterodox texts, their folly accumulated over time. Therefore, I constantly command the True One to bring forth my Dao and entrust it to a ruler of supreme morality, to show it to the worthy, and to swiftly test my Dao. Only then will they know the truth of my writings, which resemble Heaven and Earth. Without use or testing, how can one know their validity? Now, to ensure my Dao is not mistaken, I seek to have it tested—not just a single scroll.\n\nTrue One, be cautious. Indeed, indeed. Go forth and always heed my words; do not take them lightly or speak carelessly. Indeed, indeed. Do not conceal them; let all people, in their speech and learning, recognize what is gained and lost, and no longer act recklessly. Indeed, indeed.\n\n**Right: Resolving what people should not hear, should not speak, should not use—severing heterodoxy and revealing the true text.**\n\n**Serving the Master as One Serves a Father—Words to Become a Decisive Method, One Hundred Fifty-Five**\n\nNow, when the foolish speak, their words often miss the mark of the Heavenly Master’s heart, incurring repeated punishments and transgressions. They dare not ask about their faults, and even as the year draws to a close, they still do not know the way. I wish to ask one more question. How can the Way be leveled? Why be modest? To ask when one does not know is the proper course.\n\nNow, to teach the supreme essential Dao and power to ordinary people—have they truly not understood it greatly? Excellent are your words. What great understanding could there be? Why do you doubt this? I have heard that if a son’s wisdom surpasses his father’s, a disciple’s surpasses his teacher’s, or a minister’s surpasses his lord’s, it is called a lesser worthy’s wisdom surpassing their superior, which is deemed improper.\n\nYour words are both correct and incorrect. When the wisdom of inferiors surpasses that of superiors, it is indeed inappropriate. If the wisdom of inferiors is used to craft cunning and deceit, surpassing their superiors, they will deceive those above them. If you wish to see the effects, consider this: in teaching and learning, if a disciple’s skill surpasses his master’s, he will harm his master. When those below study treacherous, deceitful, and devious ways, they collectively confuse and deceive their superiors.\n\nThus, the great sages of antiquity dared not recklessly teach treacherous, cunning, or deceitful arts. They always deeply contemplated the root and severed the branches, preventing the foolish from knowing them. To govern a state with treacherous wisdom is to be a great thief of the state. Therefore, the sages of old always focused on teaching the true Dao and never imparted superficial, deceptive, or cunning arts. Knowing the great harm they would cause, they constantly closed the paths of inauspicious learning and opened the roads of auspicious conduct, so that people would remain reverent and unaware of how to do wrong.\n\nIf you wish to further confirm this truth, consider that in the era of the Three Sovereigns, rulers treated their ministers as teachers, like fathers. At that time, ministers each embraced the essential Dao and power, and there were no cunning, deceitful, or treacherous people.\n\nThus, in that era, ministers’ wisdom all surpassed their rulers, enabling them to serve as teachers to emperors and kings. Their instruction was like that of fathers, and so rulers treated them as both teachers and fathers—this was because their Dao and virtue exceeded those of their rulers. Therefore, they could cause their rulers to sit at ease, governing with folded arms and free from worry.\n\nThus, those whose words hit the mark ten times out of ten could assist emperors and kings; those who succeeded nine times out of ten could aid great ministers; those who succeeded eight times out of ten could serve as minor officials. Below this, their counsel was not worth heeding. Words that missed the mark were called reckless speech, misleading and confusing their superiors.\n\nDo you understand this?\nYes, indeed.\n\nCome, if you wish to further confirm its great effect: by the time of the Five Emperors, the Dao had slightly declined, and so rulers and ministers could no longer inquire of one another regarding Dao and virtue. Those who shared the same school became cliques, and those of like mind became friends. Though rulers and ministers shared knowledge, they could no longer greatly surpass one another. The essential Dao and secret virtue were slightly obstructed and no longer flowed freely, so they could no longer be treated as teachers or fathers, but only as friends.\n\nBy the time of the Three Kings, those who taught were often jealous of learning, blocking and cutting off the true Dao and extraordinary virtue. Their disciples grew increasingly foolish and ignorant, instead indulging in superficial embellishments, causing rulers to become confused and their Dao and virtue to grow shallow. They were no longer worthy of being treated as fathers or friends, so they were treated as subordinates. Their wisdom was scant, and so they could not assist emperors and kings in discerning the difficulty or ease of governance.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth grew greatly enraged, and disasters and calamities arose in succession, impossible to suppress or eradicate. The great fault lay here.\n\nDo you understand this?\nYes, indeed.\n\nHaving realized this, child, I shall now elucidate it further for you.\n\nIn the age of the Five Hegemons, none of their ministers possessed true Dao or virtue. All were adept at crafting cunning deceits, employing the arts of fraud and treachery to deceive one another. Their ministers, steeped in wickedness, flattery, and falsehood, mastered the ways of startling and confounding others—sometimes even surpassing their rulers. Thus, rebellion arose: sons slew their fathers, ministers murdered their lords, and subordinates killed their superiors. All harbored the hearts of barbarians, devoid of righteousness. Each person wielded deceitful schemes, every heart concealed treachery, and none held fast to the true Dao. Hence, rebellions occurred time and again.\n\nFor this reason, the executioner’s axe and drill were ever at the ready, and ministers were regarded as entries in a death ledger. Their ministers, in turn, were filled with flattery and embellishment, their cunning and deceit rendering the Way of no weight. Thus, they were treated as mere livestock—this is the clear proof.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity, aligning with the will of Heaven, embraced the true Dao, honored virtuous scholars and benevolent men, and banished the flattering and deceitful. In this way, they fulfilled the heart of August Heaven. Hence, our Dao opened the gates of fortune and sealed the doors of misfortune, never tolerating the cunning and deceit that might surpass a ruler.\n\nDo you now understand this?\nYes, indeed.\n\nBeware of this.\n\nIn the highest antiquity, ministers often attained immortality and long life, and thus could grant longevity to their rulers. In middle antiquity, ministers were often wise and embraced the Dao and virtue, and thus could ensure their rulers remained free from care. In later antiquity, ministers, lacking the true Dao and being foolish, often made their rulers exceedingly foolish. When a ruler is foolish, his governance is perpetually chaotic and confused, failing to align with the heart of Heaven.\n\nThe ministers of hegemonic rulers are all flatterers and deceivers, full of cunning and crafty deceit, together deluding their ruler, causing him to lose the true path of Heaven and instead enter the gates of misfortune—thus becoming a great enemy of Heaven. Do you understand this?\n\nTherefore, their governance is entirely inauspicious and cannot endure for long. The Perfected, in serving Heaven’s affairs, should be vigilant daily and not indulge in reckless or baseless speech. Words should become standards; if they do not form classics, it is better to remain silent. If one’s words miss the mark, the sin is profound and ineradicable.\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nGo now, for you have understood.\n\n**Right: The Difficulty of the Wise and Worthy in Surpassing Their Rulers—Hard to Resolve**\n\n*This concludes the ninety-seventh scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.\n*Here begins the ninety-eighth scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.\n\n**Divine Governance: The Secret of Guarding the Root and Hidden Protection—One Hundred Fifty-Sixth**\n\nSomeone asked about a great matter of doubt.\nSpeak.\nNow, the Heavenly Master has broadly opened the path of the Dao of Heaven, thoroughly collating the texts of ancient Daoist scriptures to discern the true essential and secret Way.\nThe true Way is largely good, and its writings enter into the divine—thus enabling one to behold the divine and govern alongside it.\nIf what is governed enters the divine as the divine does, then the Way is truly realized.\nYet many attain this in secluded chambers—some are enabled to transcend within the chamber and depart, while others enter and exit but cannot yet leave; still others merely glimpse the divine yet remain bound to it through the ages.\nOf those who transcend and depart, not one in ten thousand succeeds.\nOf those who attain great longevity, not one in a thousand succeeds.\nOf those who attain lesser longevity, not one in a hundred succeeds.\nOnly those who fulfill their Heaven-appointed years match these proportions.\nAmong all the people under Heaven who study and inquire, not one in ten thousand obtains a high office; not one in a thousand obtains a middling office; not one in a hundred obtains a minor office.\nAs for those who till the land to sustain life, not one in ten thousand gains a hundred million; not one in a thousand gains ten million; not one in a hundred gains a million.\nAll affairs are like this.\nThus, those who begin are many, while those who transcend the world or attain wealth and nobility are few.\n\nThe foolish student deeply worries: what should be the great precepts of the Dao to attain full completion? What should be the great precepts of study to obtain high office? What should be the great precepts of managing life and accumulating wealth to achieve success?\n\nNow, unable to reach the Heavenly Master’s power to resolve these doubts, I fear remaining forever benighted, never enlightened, and thus unable to know the truth.\n\nExcellent, excellent! When the various Perfected Ones ask about doubtful matters, Heaven sends you to inquire. Very well. Sit calmly, listen attentively with your whole being, and I shall now fully expound it to you, Perfected One, so that it may be clearly known and remembered by your own effort. Yes, yes.\n\nGo forth—later generations who obtain my writings shall have the true Dao’s path widely opened for them, and they will surely all study the true Dao. The true Dao often interacts with spirits, and the spirit-way is solely concerned with human affairs. Spirits delight in those who are kind to people, yet startle those who do not see them; they do not contend in speech with people but appear like flocks of birds coming and going without end. Some speak of people transcending and departing, some of people becoming wealthy and noble, some of people falling into poverty and lowliness; they praise or slander others, bring people great joy or constant bitter resentment.\n\nSpirits have no fixed form—they are beings of endless transformation. If one can focus the mind and guard oneself, refusing to heed their words, examining the heart before acting, keeping the mouth sealed to avoid transmitting their speech, and not following their sorrows, angers, or joys, steadfastly holding to the original foundation without wavering, striving to secretly benefit people and all things without wishing harm—then, after a year of knowing the Dao, one will always act with supreme goodness, seeking benefit without injury, pursuing the Dao and goodness until the end of one’s years without daring to slacken. Even if one fails to transcend the world ten thousand times, one will encounter great fortune rather than misfortune even once.\n\nIn this way, the host of spirits will together protect and assist such a person, causing them to delight daily in goodness and no longer commit evil. Does the Perfected One understand? Yes, yes. Go forth—you have now understood.\n\nGo forth, and I shall tell you, Perfected One, of those who bring chaos and ruin upon themselves. When a person’s mind and intent are not single-minded and pure, when they are easily pleased or angered, easily startled or confused, when they are glib of speech and quick-witted, always desiring to speak of good and evil with no ability to conceal—when they encounter something and cannot restrain themselves from speaking—then the host of spirits will come together to deceive them.\n\nSome, being petty, will ascend to utter perverse words and die; some will engage in constant quarrels and reckless speech; some will be startled by ghosts and spirits, falling into madness and illness. When the mind is greatly distracted, not devoted to one thing, when joy and anger are without constancy, when actions lose their correctness, when one is confused and without direction—then one may lose worthy friends and good advisors, thereby facing peril and ruin.\n\nThe greatest fault lies in not loving benefit: those above do not seek to benefit those below, listen to evil spirits, and instead desire to harm. Thus, the worthy depart, and one loses their aid. As for the petty, they do not honor and respect their superiors but instead listen to the deceit and falsehoods of evil spirits, uttering perverse and reckless words. This is the path by which the Dao is not accomplished, the gateway to misfortune—I cannot foresee or recount all its forms.\n\nGenerally, when a person’s mind cannot remain single-minded, firm, and secretive, they are easily swayed. Their actions often bring misfortune, their conduct mostly leads to harm and calamity, and their faults and transgressions accumulate in great number, beyond full recounting. I merely outline the great principles for you, Perfected One, revealing their beginnings, so that the wise and discerning who deeply examine my writings may carefully follow and investigate them, thereby surely understanding.\n\nDoes the Perfected One perhaps not comprehend? Yes, yes. Go forth—you have now greatly awakened. Hold fast to my writings as profound precepts, and those who practice them may avoid misfortune and harm for ten thousand generations. Truly... Thus, later generations who read my writings, from beginning to end, fully grasping their essential meaning and putting it into practice, will not fail even once.\n\nHold to this without ceasing, and it will naturally be fulfilled. With a single-minded, kind intent, one may interact and unite with spirits. With a perverse, evil intent, the Dao is surely lost. If the great do not listen carefully, they may lose their rightful position; if the petty do not listen carefully, they may join with perversity. These all become harms to one’s person—one cannot but greatly guard and be cautious against them.\n\nIn all matters, when people commit transgressions, they bring them upon themselves. Calamities and changes arise close at hand from within the heart and mind, not from elsewhere. Does the Perfected One understand? Yes, yes.\n\nHow astonishing! How astonishing! If you know fear and awe, then you may be said to have truly entered the Dao. The foolish have now greatly awakened—let the worthy take this as their practice. In accomplishing affairs, one may long enter the gate of fortune and avoid the door of misfortune. The paths of life and death may be clearly seen for a long time. Follow this in practice, and misfortune will daily recede while fortune draws near. Yet you have already understood this—why should I repeatedly caution you further? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth and practice the Dao for your sake. Those who study and attain high office must be resolute in their intent. In all people’s learning: today they enter the gate of study, apply their minds with single-minded focus, constantly seeking protection and benefit, loving without false speech. From youth to old age, they study until they can learn no more, yet take no joy in attaining office. They simply delight in learning, striving to master the classics and the Dao, accumulating goodness without cease. Their conduct and reputation are established, and the classics and Dao are fulfilled. They deeply understand the origins of ancient and modern calamities and changes. Their conduct and learning benefit those above and aid those below. Their accumulated goodness cannot be concealed, and their fame spreads far and wide. Enlightened rulers favor them, summoning and appointing them, while the common people all say, “Excellent!” and “Most auspicious!” This is such a person—others speak of their joy on their behalf.\n\nSuch a one is a good person, one who studies to transcend the world. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe One Hundred Fifty-Seventh Admonition on the Failures and Successes in the Dao\n\nThe Master continued his discourse to the disciple, saying: Those who do not transcend the world harbor intentions that, upon entering the gate of learning today, take no joy in contemplating and attaining the true Dao and its virtuous teachings. Instead, they seek only broad knowledge and extensive observation, believing these can exhaust the sagely Way. They take no joy in promoting and practicing goodness, but rather delight in the superficial and ostentatious, which can be used to deceive and falsify.\n\nSome, having already entered the study of the classics and the Dao, yet apply their minds without singular focus, constantly desiring to speak falsely, to excel in clever speech, and to make harming others their vocation. They neither respect their superiors nor benefit and cherish their subordinates. Their conduct and the classics and Dao are truly empty and hollow. They are unfit to be worthy ministers to emperors and kings, and instead become mere keepers of the status quo.\n\nOthers use wealth and goods to aid themselves, desiring high office to establish their reputation. Thereby, they steal and seize wealth and profit, turning public resources to private gain, betraying those above and exploiting those below. These are the ones who disrupt and corrupt proper governance, the scourge of Heaven and Earth, the thieves of the state. They are tigers and wolves among the people, wicked children to their parents. Heaven and Earth detest them, and the spirits loathe them. Thus, when their crimes are exposed, they are often punished by emperors and kings to align with the will of Heaven and to relieve the people of great harm. These are the ones who obtain office through deceit.\n\nSome, their minds unfocused and truly empty without genuine commitment, instead constantly contemplate desiring office. Office is the celestial office of the constellations, bestowed upon those of virtue and rewarding those of merit. It is not recklessly given to those without merit. Those without merit are disregarded by Heaven and Earth and unloved by the divine spirits. The foolish below, unable to deeply recognize their own faults, recklessly and ceaselessly desire celestial office. Thereupon, demonic forces collectively descend upon their minds, causing them to speak falsely and utter inauspicious words, unable to restrain themselves. Thus, there are those who die from perverse speech—this is what it means. Not only in the pursuit of the Dao, but in all things, failing to grasp its essence brings misfortune.\n\nIn all human conduct, one should not delight in goodness to avoid all misfortune. Perfected One, exert yourself. You are fortunate to have a virtuous intent, always desiring to cherish and benefit as your endeavor—you have transcended. Nevertheless, for both the Perfected and the common, whether one transcends or not does not lie in the beginning but in the end. All failures stem from not cherishing oneself, from taking oneself lightly, from claiming to have transcended, yet harboring faults within and thus failing to transcend.\n\nTherefore, if I now speak without ceasing, it is because the Perfected One compels me to continue. If I were to halt my discourse midway, taking myself lightly and remaining silent, I would fear incurring the Perfected One’s resentment. If the Perfected One resents me, he would look up to Heaven, and Heaven would in turn bring harm upon me. Thus, I dare not speak lightly, taking my studies lightly and ceasing midway. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the harm that befalls the common is like this. It often arises from not comprehending, from not aligning with the fundamental. Therefore, one loses the Way. Since you have rendered great service to Heaven, exert yourself, exert yourself. Indeed, indeed. I dare not take my studies and the Dao lightly.\n\nGo forth. You have already understood the art of self-transcendence; I have nothing more to add. The Master continued to expound to the Perfected One in detail:\n\nThere are those who delight in managing their households and accumulating wealth, attaining riches and honor. In their youth, they are capable of labor and, as they grow, contemplate their affairs, exerting their strength to the utmost before ceasing. They are able to extol goodness and conceal faults, always delighting in doing good, constantly and reverently contemplating respect for their superiors. In all matters of doubt, they are cautious and vigilant, daring not act recklessly. They cherish their subordinates and desire not to harm others, do not pervert the king’s law, and take no joy in following perverse rituals or indulging in feasting and drinking.\n\nIn all non-urgent matters, they dare not partake. Those who knowingly conduct themselves thus continue until old age without ceasing. Though they may appear empty in substance, their words are not frivolous. Thus, they are able to amass treasures and accumulate wealth, thereby becoming accomplished individuals.\n\nPeople, whether worthy or unworthy, differ in their intentions. There are those who are not good, who disrespect their superiors and harm their subordinates, delight in following perverse rituals, and frequently engage in non-urgent and improper conduct. They are glib in speech, unable to restrain themselves in the marketplace, and are indeed people of misfortune, disorder, peril, and ruin—these are not followers of the Dao. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao must concentrate their minds, seal their mouths, and refrain from reckless speech.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity observed the luminous patterns of Heaven and so were able to practice the Dao and uphold virtue. Heaven is singularly devoted: day and night it follows the Dao without speech, and thus it alone attains auspiciousness. Earth, too, day and night follows the Dao without speech, nurturing the myriad things, and thus it alone endures in tranquility. The four seasons alone follow the Dao, ceaselessly moving day and night, and thus they alone perpetually flourish and reign without end. The Three Luminaries alone follow the true Dao without speech, and thus they remain eternally bright, revolving in accord with Heaven. The Five Phases alone follow the true Dao without speech, and thus they endure as constants with Heaven and Earth. All under Heaven who practice the Dao emulate these examples without exception.\n\nThus, those who cherish and benefit others, whose mouths do not speak recklessly, may attain the Dao. Those who treat matters with frivolity and disregard, who contradict these words, will invariably be harmed by the Dao—there is not a single exception. Since you, Perfected One, have come from afar to seek answers to your doubts, I offer this admonition to you. Ponder and reflect upon this text; I do not fail you. I speak on behalf of Heaven to admonish the people of the virtuous and noble ruler. Heaven bestows upon the virtuous ruler, who must surely favor the Dao, and the common people will emulate their ruler, all taking this text as their great precept. Thus, they may attain good fortune and distance themselves from misfortune.\n\nThis scripture is issued to admonish the ignorant; guard it well and do not conceal it.\nIndeed, indeed.\nProceed.\n\nThis discourse on admonition may seem small yet yields greatness, appear shallow yet proves profound. What does this mean? Though its words may seem minor, its admonitions are truly vast. Though its language may resemble the arguments of common sophists—seeming too slight to transmit—its guidance for cultivating others is indeed profound.\n\nThus, when I compose the Dao for the Perfected One, in its vastness it penetrates to the boundless, and in its subtlety it permeates without enclosure. In exaltation, it reaches the utmost heights; in humility, it extends to the lowest depths. Therefore, it encompasses the divine and the enslaved alike. The reason for this is to ensure that whether the great or the small, the worthy or the common, all may find its words sufficient. Why is this so?\n\nWould that I might hear your intent.\nExcellent is your inquiry; you have grasped its meaning. Thus, I compose this scripture for the ruler of Great Peace. When the ruler of Great Peace governs, they must emulate Heaven as their model, not like the lord of a small state, who rules only within a single domain.\n\nTherefore, Heaven’s emulation as a model is exalted without superior, humble without inferior, vast without exterior, and minute without interior. It embraces and nurtures the twelve thousand things, whether good or evil, great or small, all are benefited and protected. It endows them with primordial qi to bring them to life and does not harm or injure them in the end. Thus, it is most fittingly called the divine, the supreme ruler without peer.\n\nNow, as the qi of the Highest August arrives and the virtuous ruler governs, they must emulate this as their model. Thus, my Dao ascends and descends, sinks and rises, so that the multitude of worthies may together examine it. Therefore, in the southeast lies the Earth’s Gate, where waters sustain Heaven’s pillar, not resisting even the smallest flow. Whether good or evil, great or small, all return to it.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, for I would expound further on the boundless discourse, weaving its grand patterns—yet for now, pause and rest, each returning to ponder these matters within your hearts. To practice the Dao without grasping its intent is like pointing south while asking about the north. With such a misdirected mind, even after ages of study, nothing will be attained. You dare not proceed further—you have already understood.\n\n*(Right: A collection of questions on the Dao’s precepts, the governance of life, and the origins of success and failure, fortune and misfortune.)*\n\n**Verifying the Texts: The Formula for Longevity, One Hundred Fifty-Eighth**\n\nI wish to ask about one doubtful matter.\nSpeak.\nNow, while the Heavenly Master is still here, I wish to inquire about the formulas within the texts: Is there a way for a person to live truly long, to work alongside others without ever growing weary? May I hear of this?\nIndeed, do you seek to examine all texts to discern where the worthy reside?\nYes.\nBe seated, and I shall explain it to you, Perfected One.\n\nTo amass texts by the hundreds of millions yet fail to attain longevity—what benefit is there to one’s life? To fill a chamber with writings yet fail to govern with order—what benefit is there to governance? To fill the court with ministers yet fail to bring the ruler great peace and joy—what benefit is there to the emperor? To father a hundred children yet leave one’s parents to hunger and cold—what benefit is there to one’s kin? To pile remedies as heavy as a cartload yet fail to extend life—what benefit is there to human destiny? To endlessly expound on matters yet fail to rid the ruler of disasters—what benefit is there to the court?\n\nSuch examples are countless, beyond enumeration. I merely raise the essentials for you, Perfected One, that all worthies may reflect deeply upon them.\nI wish to see their effects.\nDo you truly wish to know?\nYes, Heavenly Master.\nVery well. Sit calmly and focus, and I shall explain it to you.\n\nAmong hundreds of millions of texts, only those that can lengthen life, enrich destiny, and secure the body are true texts—the rest are not. Among chambers filled with writings, only those that align with Heaven’s will and bring order to governance are true texts—the rest are not. Among ministers filling the court, only those who bring joy to their ruler and assist in achieving great peace are the true ministers and worthy officials of the emperor—the rest are mere functionaries. Among children born to a person, only those who ensure their parents’ constant joy and freedom from hunger and cold are filial and virtuous—the rest are but numbers fulfilled. Among remedies piled as heavy as a cartload, only those that extend years are true remedies—the rest are not.\n\nSuch comparisons in the world are too numerous to list in advance. Perfected One, ponder their meaning deeply. My words use one to infer ten thousand, sufficient to illuminate the Dao of all under Heaven. Thus, I instruct you to transmit the Dao to the ruler of Earth’s virtue, to gather and examine all common texts and the words of scholars, clarifying them for all worthies so that together they may awaken from delusion and confusion.\n\nOnce all common texts have been examined, disasters will depart by the day. For false texts and deceitful words are the masters of calamity and treachery. True texts and upright words are the officials that expel evil and wickedness. When texts are rectified and words are rectified, treachery has no master and thus nowhere to abide.\n\nFalse texts and deceitful words as masters of treachery are like thieves and bandits with a host to shelter them. Once the host perishes, the thieves and bandits have no way to return and rest. Perfected One, do you also understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now—the Dao of Heaven’s method is to take the One to illuminate the myriad, yet it cannot be fully inscribed. Perfected One, having received this, you must deeply ponder its essential meaning. The wise and enlightened, whose hearts possess nine apertures, readily comprehend; upon seeing the text, they awaken of themselves. No further questions are needed.\n\n*Textual pause.*\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nExcessive texts bewilder the mind; it is better to raise a single guiding principle, so that the ten thousand strands arrange themselves and unfold. Thus, the teeming masses, though numerous, are not equal to one emperor. The countless stars, though innumerable, are not equal to the brightness of a single sun. The clamorous words of crawling creatures filling the heavens are not equal to one worthy minister in a kingdom. The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, without end—yet it is not equal to the single primordial qi that holds the mandate’s guiding thread with Heaven.\n\nThe ruler of supreme virtue, if wise, deeply reflects on my words, and longevity will naturally extend. If later generations together ponder my words, fathers will be kind and sons filial, their virtue daily expanding and brightening. Mothers will be loving and wives obedient, and the entire realm will rise at dawn as one, all worthy and good. Great and small will vie in goodness, and the latter will have no strength to resist. No longer will there be false texts, nor will flatterers find refuge in them. Disasters and omens will be wholly dispelled, and the two luminaries will shine clearly. This is the art of spontaneity, uniformly practiced by the celestial spirits.\n\nIs this how the Dao is enacted? What sorrow could remain in such great joy? To take this as the method is to follow Heaven’s course. Who records it? It is the numinous work of Heaven and Earth. The texts of verification resonate in harmony with Heaven and Earth—this is the tally of Heaven’s trust.\n\nRulers and worthies should together examine these words. Those who practice them will daily prosper, aligning with the times as if by appointment. They will attain what Heaven and Earth desire—how auspicious! When yin and yang flow in accord, wind and rain come in season, and the ten thousand changes vanish. By the verifying texts, I do not praise myself. Truly, I know this—not merely embellished speech. You should swiftly put it into effect.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, go forth. Refine it in detail, and the Dao will come of itself.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n*Textual division:*\n**Method of Male and Female Reversal of Form, One Hundred Fifty-Ninth**\n\nI wish to ask once more about a doubtful matter.\nSpeak.\nIn the texts Your Celestial Master previously bestowed upon this foolish student, there is mention of \"male and female reversal of form.\" I wish to hear its meaning.\nAh! The text has already briefly explained what can be seen—why do you ask again?\nMy dull heart is closed and slow to open; I can only inquire of Your Celestial Master for the decisive teaching.\nVery well. Be seated, and I shall now explain it to you.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is such that yang loves yin, and yin loves yang. Thus, yang ought to transform into yin, and yin ought to transform into yang. All principles of yin and yang are like this. They mutually love one another, so their refinement and cultivation progress swiftly. However, one must □□ with graded instructions—it cannot be directly taught to others. Otherwise, one falls into heterodoxy.\n\nNow listen carefully: the yang transforms its form to become the yin form, and the yin transforms its form to become the yang form. It is precisely through one’s own body that one embodies the other’s appearance. It cannot be directly attained, or one will fall into heterodoxy.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nIf you still doubt after understanding, then—\nAh! Why is this so difficult for you to grasp? Simply use your own body to assume the other’s form. The yang becomes like the body of a yin person, and the yin becomes like the body of a yang person.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYou have now understood. Go forth, and the matter will become clear.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n*Here ends the collection of difficult-to-comprehend texts, the essential methods distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy, and the true principles of yin-yang reversal of form for governing the Dao.*\n\n**Method of Embracing Heaven and Enveloping Earth, Guarding Qi Without Ceasing, One Hundred Sixtieth**\n\nI wish to ask Your Celestial Master one more matter and then cease.\nSpeak—what doubt remains?\nThe Dao embraces Heaven and envelops Earth—who sustains its qi and observes its signs?\nProfound, far-reaching, and wondrous is your question!\nWhy do you ask this after seeing what you have seen?\nI have seen and witnessed the Way of Heaven and Earth, yet I do not understand its ultimate limit, so I ask in wonder.\nExcellent! Your words penetrate subtle meaning.\nThe reason the Way of Heaven and Earth endures long and forever is that it guards qi without ceasing. Thus, Heaven relies solely on qi for fortune and misfortune; all things perish without qi. If you do not wish to meet your end, you should unite with qi as the Mysterious Female, emulate Heaven’s work—how then could you die?\n\nYet this cannot be swiftly attained; it requires entering the secluded chamber. Within the chamber, contemplate the Dao, naturally abstain from food, and join with qi. Thus, you become one with the spirits of Heaven and Earth, no longer bound by worldly governance. You ascend to follow the Great One of Heaven, pay homage at the Central Ultimate, receive the talisman, and traverse the six directions and eight distant realms without end. Reflect on the words of this text, and you will attain it—the steps to becoming a spirit will be visible.\n\nDeparting the world to ascend to Heaven and govern, you will no longer be seen. If you wish to further witness its clear effects: in this world, one cannot long possess and govern alone. Thus, those who attain the Dao fly upward to Heaven—this is their departure from the world. Those who refuse to diligently cultivate the Dao descend into the earth at death, unable to long dwell in the middle realm. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, sages have departed to seclude themselves; their sacred texts remain as constant models, yet their persons are unseen—this is the clear proof.\n\nThose who do not die and attain the Dao ascend to Heaven; those who die descend into the earth, unable to long remain on the harmonious path of the middle. If you grasp my text, ponder its meaning deeply. If you delight in ascending and wish to live forever, joining your strength with Heaven, partaking in the seasonal sacrifices and feasts of the world—strive to practice the true Dao, for this is its purifying method. If you do not delight in eternal life but delight in death, abandon the Dao and follow the vulgar, and you too will return to the earth below, no longer able to gaze upon the sun, moon, stars, and celestial cycles.\n\nMy text is □□—ten thousand times ten thousand, not a single word is amiss. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity have all departed, and none remain visible—this is the great proof. Reflect for yourself: if you delight in ascending, you will ascend; if you delight in descending, you will descend. None can wrest your will from you.\n\nThus, I, the Virtuous Lord of Great Peace, have established this method without resentment toward any single person. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even one person harbors grievance and does not attain their desire, then the balanced qi of the Supreme August cannot fully descend. Therefore, Heaven has commanded me to broadly open the path, allowing each to freely choose what they may do.\n\nThose of wisdom and clarity who delight in life may study my text, contemplate its meaning, enter the chamber to accomplish the Dao, and attain life. Those of gentle virtue who delight in assisting emperors and kings in governance may model their actions on my text to bring about Great Peace. Those who delight in managing households, nurturing life, and accumulating wealth may ponder my text and live out their Heaven-appointed years before dying. Thus, each attains their heart’s desire, and none harbors great grievance.\n\nTherefore, the qi of Great Peace comes forth. The term \"peace\" means level and without grievance—hence, it is called \"peace.\" Thus, when the Virtuous Lord governs, the qi of Great Peace arises. The reason is that the world harbors no grievances; each attains what they delight in. This is why I have charged the Perfected Ones to entrust it to the lord of supreme virtue.\n\nThe lord of supreme virtue must be benevolent, worthy, and enlightened. The enlightened do not wrest away what others desire but must win the hearts of all under Heaven, wishing to align with Heaven’s will and return to the Dao.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**Chapter 161: The Key to Appointing Officials and Their Gains and Losses**\n\nProceed with utmost caution, Perfected One, in even a single word, that your governance may resemble the movement of Heaven. The Way of Heaven does not wrest away what others desire to do. The Way of Earth likewise does not wrest away what others desire to do. The enlightened lord delights in emulating Heaven and Earth, never wresting away what others do. Thus, in resembling Heaven and Earth, he alone endures and is called Heaven and Earth, winning their hearts.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhen Heaven turns malign and the year portends great calamity, it is ever because it harms what people strive to do. Thus, the people reap nothing, and the year brings famine and cold. When Earth turns malign, it injures what nourishes people; roots weaken and sicken, harvests fail, and the people suffer hardship and poverty.\n\nA declining, wicked lord courts disaster when he appoints officials without regard for their fitness for office. This is called deliberately disrupting Heaven’s bureaucracy, violating Heaven’s prohibitions, and forsaking Heaven’s norms. He reverses course to impose blame and punishment, never considering whether one’s strength is insufficient or human capacity falls short. It is like suddenly commanding a lord to walk a hundred *li*—one fears he cannot reach the end and halts midway. What humans cannot achieve is precisely this.\n\nThus, to appoint men without selection and recklessly assign them office is to be called one who distresses the people and endangers the state—one who throws governance into chaos and invites ruin. Heaven and Earth are supremely numinous and luminous, yet even they dare not wrest away what others desire to do. To do so is to bring a year of great calamity—how much worse for mortal men?\n\nPerfected One, have you awakened from confusion and gained clarity?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nShould one truly follow each state’s customs to transmit the Master’s writings, adapting teachings to local ways and clarifying their meaning, then you, disciple, may be called one who understands the workings of life—Heaven does not thwart human aspirations. By walking the upright path, you naturally align with Heaven’s mandate, and your years and days will only increase without end.\n\nYou study not for worldly honor or glory—why then seek to grasp Heaven’s intent and prolong your years? Now that I have told you this, can you still say no? Indeed, receiving such great favor brings boundless joy, leaving no room for regret. Yet I fear that in striving to the utmost and disseminating the Master’s texts, you may not achieve universal transmission in a single day. Why must it be done in a day? Persist without ceasing, and like a boat carried by the current, you will not long remain distant.\n\nVery well.\nHaving received your solemn charge, I dare not stray even from the guiding line.\nNow that you grasp its meaning, I need not admonish you further.\n\nGo—this minor discourse concludes, and the matter is complete. Should you have doubts another day, return again.\nVery well.\n\n**Right [Section]: A Grand Compilation of Difficult Questions on Heaven and Earth’s Qi and Seasons—Whether They Constitute the Dao, and the Auspicious or Inauspicious Effects of a Ruler’s Appointment of Officials**\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the Ninety-Eighth, Concludes*\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the Ninety-Ninth*\n\n**Riding Clouds and Mounting Dragons Diagram, the One Hundred Sixty-Second**\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the Ninety-Ninth, Concludes*\n*Scroll the One Hundredth*\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the One Hundredth*\n\n**Eastern Wall Diagram, the One Hundred Sixty-Third**\n*Inscribed on the Eastern Wall—A Diagram of the Ancient Divine Person’s Admonitions to Disciples and Later Learners on Cultivating Goodness*\n\nActs of hidden virtue bring constant blessings to others, and their merit multiplies. Acts of overt virtue prompt others to respond in kind, yet their effects dissipate. Hidden virtue, however, is known to Heaven, Earth, and all spirits—thus its merit multiplies.\n\nThose who accumulate virtue are cherished by the wealthy, and their goodness comes to them day by day. What men praise, the spirits and gods also praise, and so they protect and aid them. Those who embrace the Dao attain long life, for they share the concerns of yin and yang, follow the movements of the August Spirit, and align with the nature of Heaven and Earth. Grasping its principles, they gain Heaven’s protection; losing them, they fall into chaos, and Heaven does not protect them.\n\nTo seek goodness through goodness—nothing in this is strange. To attain it through benevolence is the beginning of the Dao. To attain it through virtue is the harmony of the Dao. To attain it through the Dao itself is the highest Dao.\n\nAlas! Be cautious, be ever cautious—act without recklessness. Ponder deeply this text and transmit it to later generations, that no harm may come. To move in accord with the four seasons is the highest Dao.\n\nGoodness arises of itself; evil brings illness upon itself. Matters of fortune and misfortune all emerge from within, calling forth their kind—thus one does not lose oneself. The Dao of Heaven is impartial; outcomes arise from one’s own conduct.\n\nThus, those who came before as disciples leave behind a legacy of good qi, and those who pursue learning without cease fulfill their destiny, attaining yang’s fruition. Some gain long life and an unblemished body—this is the result of goodness. The inner and outer spirits then turn to remove their harm. The disciple stands before them, and the master faces them in response.\n\nAll things have their natural course; the affairs of the world each follow their kind.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the One Hundredth, Concludes*\n*Scroll the One Hundred First*\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the One Hundred First*\n*Western Wall Diagram the One Hundred Sixty-Fourth*\n*Admonition of the Ancient Divine Persons and Perfected Ones to Later Scholars on the Portents of Evil*\n\nThe ancient divine persons and perfected ones warned later scholars through diagrams of the consequences of evil. Those who act as yin’s thieves, disdaining harmonious affairs and instead delighting in harm and jealousy, bring upon others death and misfortune.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven cannot be forcibly seized; those who seize it will meet death by arms and the loss of power, extinguishing the world and the Way. Sacred texts will be destroyed, and what was sought as gain will turn to harm—this is the resonance of Heaven and Earth’s nature. It leads to the juncture of the spontaneous, where those who carefully delight in it endure, while those who are reckless perish. Be cautious, be ever cautious.\n\nDo no harm, nor seek it; goodness arises of itself, and evil collapses of itself. Contemplate these two portents and ponder their benefits and harms.\n\nAll matters under Heaven follow their kind; even in the space of a hair’s breadth, there is no deviation. Yet people fail to refine themselves, remaining ignorant of their own nature. Once the name of guilt is affixed, nothing can be done. Those who do not preserve their root will die with lingering transgressions, for evil arises within, and perverse qi summons its like from without.\n\nThus, before them lies the harm of imprisonment, and behind them, malevolent spirits—all hastening to contend, unable to cease, leading to the destruction of the self. Therefore, these diagrams are drawn to admonish later worthies, serving as a great warning.\n\nThe foolish do not believe in the Dao, treating matters with indifference. Yet the texts are precise in their words, not erring by even a fraction. Thus, those who embrace softness attain long life, while those who delight in strife bring about their own ruin.\n\nMatters follow their kind and cannot be reversed; though one may repent, it is of no avail, for the spirits have already attached themselves. Heed the warning and awaken, returning in due time. Now, while no harm has yet come, one may still become a person of goodness.\n\nThe good ascend, while the evil descend. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, yet it operates spontaneously, never deviating from its law—its workings are like those of spirits.\n\n*Inscribed on the Western Wall.*\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll the One Hundred First, Concludes*\n*Scroll the One Hundred Second*\n\n**The Divine Person’s Preface on the Illustrations of Robes and Colors, Scroll the One Hundred Sixty-Five**\n\nIn my youth, I studied without cease, my spirit ever fixed upon it, tears often welling up. Through long accumulation, by the great grace of August Heaven, I was fortunate to encounter the Heavenly Master in the wilderness. My early studies were deficient, and my inquiries trivial—mere superficial embellishments. I had originally sought the method of *guarding the One* and nurturing nature, comprising three hundred chapters, yet upon meeting the Heavenly Master, I found his discourse boundless. Thus, I dared to ask: *Can the body attain enduring existence?*\n\nNot yet having heard the Heavenly Master’s boundless teachings, I ventured to inquire about minor governance. Only after hearing his discourse without limit did I dare to ask in full: *Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, how have emperors succeeded one another, bearing sorrow and hardship? Why do celestial disasters and strange omens never cease? How may they be eliminated? Furthermore, why do the host of spirits, without cause, harm humanity, preventing people from fulfilling their allotted years? How may this be halted?*\n\nNow, having received the Heavenly Master’s stern instructions and profound warnings, when ought this book—meant to suppress deceit and revive the Dao of Heaven and Earth—be revealed? It shall emerge in the year *yisi*, entrusted to couriers for dissemination. Thereafter, in every year marked by *xuanjia*, it shall be brought forth, for this is the first of Heaven’s celestial stems, the supreme beginning of the cycle. It aligns with the primordial *qi* and shall be presented to the state, front and back, to resolve the successive calamities inherited since the inception of Heaven and Earth.\n\nBy what title shall it be conveyed? Its teachings are layered and profound, its characters known only to the deeply initiated. Do not allow the leakage of the harmonious *qi* of August Heaven or the foremost Dao. It shall be transmitted to those capable of receiving and expounding it. When the time of *xuanjia* arrives, should one appear eager for this book, present it first to those who *guard the One* amid superficiality. Having entrusted it to couriers and *fangshi*, it shall be delivered to a ruler of utmost virtue.\n\nWhat does this mean? *One who obtains it and practices it is the rightful recipient; one who does not practice it is not.* The Perfected One must not release it prematurely. For Heaven’s wrath is fierce—it slays in retribution. My warnings are fully set forth herein. Thus, I speak cautiously, truly fearing Heaven’s judgment.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master instructs his foolish disciple, whose heart is heavy with reverence, as if already foreseeing the consequences. I dare not betray this trust. I earnestly ask: *How ought the illustrations of divine robes be depicted?* They must all emulate Heaven’s law, not follow worldly custom. Those who do not comprehend Heaven’s law depict figures arbitrarily, clothing them as they fancy. Robes, however, follow the colors of the Five Phases.\n\nNow, let the mother envelop the child within, arranging colors in sequence. The most layered robes have five; the moderately layered, four; the lesser layered, three; the subtly layered, two—symbolizing the union of *yin* and *yang*. The grand assemblage robe has six layers of chaotic hues.\n\n*What does the five-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the harmonious convergence of the *qi* of the Five Phases.\n\n*What does the four-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the cyclic generation of the four seasons.\n\n*What does the three-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes father, mother, and child—the harmonious union of *yin* and *yang*.\n\n*What does the two-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the mutual support of the sovereign and ministering *qi*.\n\n*What does the six-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the intermingled colors of the six directions.\n\nThus, the world possesses variegated hues—this is what it signifies.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Go forth, and guard the secret illustrations with care.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\n\nNow, though your disciple is most foolish and lowly, by grace I have long been permitted to study the texts of the Heavenly Master. In all matters, my understanding has been swift and complete. Yet I still wish to ask one further question.\n\nSpeak plainly.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nI have observed that since the opening of Heaven and Earth, texts and scriptures have emerged not once but many times, accumulating in great number. Moreover, many have come forth from the Yellow River and Luo River. Why, then, does this present text not require their emergence?\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Your question is apt, for Heaven has moved you to speak—you have grasped its intent.\n\nToday, Heaven has fully charged me to reveal to emperors, kings, and the people the full account of *chengfu* (inherited responsibility and retribution). The accumulated texts are too numerous to be brought forth solely through the River and Luo writings. The River and Luo texts are vast in their revelations, and their divination slips too numerous to be fully known through divination alone. Thus, Heaven acts through people to bring them forth.\n\nHeaven knows me deeply and has entrusted me with this message. Knowing the difficulty of such questions, it has instead sent you to transmit its essential words with me. You, too, must understand: if one studies without attaining the heart of the Dao, what purpose does a Perfected Person serve?\n\nNow, I am dull and benighted, unaware of myself.\n\n[The preceding question concludes the section on the secret illustrations of robes and texts.]\n\n**Rank and Transmission of Texts; The Sealed and Obstructed Bring Illness—Decisions 166**\n\nYou have come from Heaven to seek answers, and I am Heaven’s instrument to instruct you.\n\nI wish to understand the meaning of this decision. By what is it made clear?\n\nHow is it further clarified?\n\nWhen a virtuous ruler obtains my texts, comprehends them in his heart, and practices them, consulting with worthy ministers to transform the common people, he will surely resonate with Heaven’s response—this is its clear proof. My Dao is perfected through admonition, not through false words or self-serving teachings.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nYour disciple is unworthy and has often troubled the Heavenly Master in vain.\n\nIf you do not ask, there is no way to know. I have long held this learning, yet there has been no one with whom to speak, so I have not transmitted it in due time. Now, if people cannot distinguish black from white, the fault lies with me.\n\nToday, I am truly overjoyed to transmit this to you, a Perfected One. It is like ascending a tower in spring and emerging to behold the boundless sky—what could compare?\n\nHeaven’s grievances have accumulated, and illnesses and transformations never cease. This pent-up stagnation, now released through speech with you, brings joy. Why does the Heavenly Master not go forth himself to establish the ranks?\n\nMy office is in Heaven, while yours, Perfected One, is on Earth. Earth gives birth to the myriad things, and thus Heaven nurtures what it generates upon the Earth. Therefore, I transmit the Dao to you. Earth gives rise to rulers, common people, and the twelve thousand things, all receiving the bestowal of *yang* and emerging from *yin*—thus, you transmit it to humanity.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! This foolish one marvels greatly.\n\nHad I not earnestly questioned the Heavenly Master, there would have been no way to know. I merely guessed and dared to ask presumptuously.\n\nWell done! You are one who understands matters—this is not your effort alone. Truly, Heaven has bestowed its intent upon your heart to speak.\n\nNow, though you were once benighted and unaware of your own conduct, you have come to great self-knowledge, illuminated like the light of the sun and moon. If you doubt my words, consider this: though Heaven may wish to reveal something, it does not speak directly to people, making its will difficult to discern. My texts follow Heaven’s commands, clarifying the cinnabar and azure.\n\nIf you were to conceal or suppress my writings, refusing to bring them forth in due time, Heaven would afflict you with illness and misfortune. If you continue to obstruct them, you will meet with calamity. This is Heaven’s way of sending you to seek answers—its clear proof that the Perfected One must bring them forth as a testament of faith.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Perfected One, take heed and guard this warning.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe Heavenly Master’s duty is to cover all under Heaven, and I cannot refuse.\n\nI wish to ask one more question.\n\nDo you dare not speak?\n\nGo ahead. Are all matters under Heaven carried out by Heaven’s envoys?\n\nIs it only the Heavenly Master and this foolish disciple?\n\nAh! You grow ever more foolish. Do you not know that all things under Heaven serve as Heaven’s envoys, each with its own office, together completing the Dao? If even one thing were lacking, the Dao of Heaven would be incomplete. How could you not understand this? How profound is this obscurity!\n\nThis ignorant one has not yet fully grasped it. With the Heavenly Master’s explanation, it becomes clear.\n\nGo, you have been sufficiently instructed.\n\nGo, and strive with all your might. Every person has their office and serves as Heaven’s instrument—how could one dare to act alone by natural inclination?\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nGo now.\"\n\nThe One Hundred Sixty-Seventh Scripture on the Essential Formulas of the Canonical Texts\n\nAt the origin of Heaven’s numbers, when Heaven and Earth were yet undivided, the accumulated qi coalesced as one. Then it divided into two, forming husband and wife.\n\nHeaven bestowed upon Earth, conceiving in the Dark Obscurity, and it was named *jiazi*. Its roots spread to the northeast—*chou* and *yin*. First appearing at *mao*, it fully grew in the southeast—*chen* and *si*. Its branches hung in the south, nurtured at *wu*, aging in the southwest—*wei* and *shen*. It matured in the west, the sun setting at *you*, and was wholly concealed in the northwest—*xu* and *hai*.\n\nThus the numbering begins at one and ends at ten. Ten is the beginning of the Ten Celestial Stems and the root of the Five Phases. Multiplying one by ten yields one hundred, and thus it is complete.\n\nHeaven generates within a hundred days, and thus all things reach their end. Therefore, the Dipper is established at *chen* and broken at *xu*. \"Established\" means to stand—thus all things strive to reach full growth. \"Broken\" means to decay—all things wholly perish at *xu*. The numbers follow the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, and with ten, the yin-yang establishment and breaking are complete. By this, they cycle back and forth to their origin, following the Dipper’s pointer to illuminate affairs.\n\nThis scripture is written to dispel harmful qi, modeling itself upon Heaven as its standard.\n\nAbove is the written inquiry to the Heavenly Master, verifying the luminous essential formulas.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Two—end\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Three—[beginning]\n\n**The Chart of Emptiness, Non-Action, and Spontaneity—Admonitions Fully Realized, One Hundred Sixty-Eight**\n\n**On Emptiness**\nEmptiness is inwardly replete yet outwardly void—being as though non-being. Reverse the womb and embryo to dwell with the Dao. Preserve the heart alone, suspending the dragon’s thoughts. Thus becomes the chamber of spirit, gathering the Dao in emptiness. Roam only with qi, hence \"emptiness.\" In qi and spirit, all else is cast away. With the heart as master, one attains freedom from deviation. Examine its meaning closely; do not forget the true scripture. Attain this, and you cross over—able to wander long. Why not hasten to refinement, only to dwell among fools? Once misfortune arrives, great disaster befalls. Forsake true simplicity, and you return to dust and ash. The wise, upon seeing this text, take heed and hold it true.\n\n**On Non-Action**\nNon-action is action without contrivance. It connects with the Dao, emerging before infancy, entering the seamless. Reaching the Great Beginning, it returns again. At the inception of Heaven and Earth, the source of yin and yang—enter the art of non-action, and the body may be preserved whole. To abandon root for branch is the Dao’s affliction. Depart from the Great Beginning, and preservation becomes difficult. Drift far from life, and you approach death’s gate. Indulging in worldly affairs harms the hun and shen. Clinging to duality while forgetting unity severs their mutual resonance. Can one not take warning? This is the origin of the Dao. You, who guard the One—this is the wellspring of benevolence and wisdom. The Dao of Heaven acts through the One, thus remains complete. The Dao of Earth acts through the Two, and draws near to ghosts and spirits. Truly know non-action, and you align with the Dao’s most numinous aspect. Reflect deeply upon this, and the Perfected Ones take precedence. Seal your golden gate; let nothing depart its threshold. Silent and soundless, spirit is prolonged. When spirit and qi are complete, the gate of immortality opens. How effortless is the Great Dao—no longer troubled! The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet turns toward the benevolent and wise.\n\n**On Spontaneity**\nThe law of spontaneity connects with the Dao. Hold to it, and fortune follows; lose it, and calamity arises. Consider how the myriad things arise whole—one root, ten thousand branches, yet none possess spirit. Ponder its meaning, and the Dao reveals itself. All trace back to the primordial chaos, emerging from the wondrous gate. Neither increase nor diminish—guard spontaneity. All living things possess spirit, but of the eighteen hundred breaths, man is supreme. Thus may one avoid death and attain long-lasting transcendence. Those who perish early lose spontaneity—even beasts endure, how much more so man? Fools despise the Dao, sinking low to join the earth. The benevolent and wise esteem the Dao, ascending swiftly to Heaven’s gate. The spirit-way does not die; the ghost-way meets its end. Should you desire this, it is like a ring without end. Beware of deviance—it brings harm to the self. Neither abandon it recklessly, lest it cause death. The nature of Heaven and Earth uniquely honors spontaneity. Each follows its course; none dare oppose it. The Dao flourishes through non-action, emptiness, and spontaneity. Superior persons delight in it; inferior persons resent it. Study diligently under a master; do not speak idly. With a master, the Dao is clear; without one, transmission is difficult. Learning without a master’s instruction, the noble person remains silent. Acting recklessly brings chaos; inscribing the body invites misfortune. When the Dao is fully realized, spontaneity is achieved.\n\n**Admonitions on the Dao Fully Realized**\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Three—end\n*Tai Ping Department*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Four\n\n**Promoting the Superior and Eliminating Harm, Restoring Texts: One Hundred Sixty-Nine**\n*Right: Formula for Promoting the Superior and Eliminating Harm, Restoring Texts*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Four—end\n\n*Compiled by*\nDaoist Academic Information Network\nCompiler: Hong Baijian\nSource: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*\nSponsor: *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Five\n\n**Commanding the Venerable to Be Without Sorrow: One Hundred Seventy**\n*Right: The Venerable Shall Have No Sorrow, for Evil Shall Remove Itself*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Five—end\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Six\n\n**Virtue and Conduct Bring Auspicious Prosperity: One Hundred Seventy-One**\n*Right: Those Who Cultivate Virtue and Conduct Shall Enjoy Auspicious Prosperity, Ever Upholding the Dao*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Six—end\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Seven\n\n**Divine Protection: One Hundred Seventy-Two**\n*Right: Conceal It in Seclusion, and the Spirits Shall Protect It*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Seven—end\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Eight\n\n**Nineteen Essential Formulas: One Hundred Seventy-Three**\n\nFor those who practice the Dao, obtain the formula by marking it inside or outside the chamber. When the full number of days is reached, open the door and enter to inspect it. If the mark was made within, do not enter to view it. If the mark was not made within, then those who delight in it may enter to view it. When opening the door to enter, those who wish to leave may do so freely.\n\nFor the three Daoist scriptures in circulation, obtain the formula through collective deliberation, treating it as Heaven’s trust, and thereby establishing it for those above. For the true spirits and numina, obtain the formula through the unanimous clarity of ten thousand people, treating it as Heaven’s trust. For any text requiring correction, obtain the formula through verification and collation, treating it as Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor those who wish to know the trustworthiness of our Daoist texts, obtain the formula by swiftly enacting them, for they resonate with Heaven’s response. The good shall daily increase, and the evil shall daily diminish—this is Heaven’s trust. For those who wish to appoint and employ good persons, obtain the formula through nine individuals.\n\nTo inquire whether one has entered the chamber and succeeded or not, obtain the formula through complete clarity and understanding—form without concealment or obstruction is Heaven’s trust. To know whether one has attained the Dao in the body and become deathless, obtain the formula through the body’s transformation into spirit, thereby transcending the world—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor those who wish to thoroughly understand the meaning of our texts, read them from beginning to end, and all shall become self-evident. The heart shall be greatly enlightened, and doubt shall no longer remain. Once its meaning is grasped, it cannot be abandoned.\n\nTo test the authenticity of our texts, observe whether they bring about the governance of the world toward Great Peace—this is Heaven’s trust. To know whether longevity can be attained or not, obtain the formula from the era after Great Peace. If Great Peace has not yet arrived, the disasters of former generations shall harm the people, making it difficult to fulfill one’s destiny—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor the sun to know Great Peace, obtain the formula from the severing of metal. For water and fire to suppress and eliminate treacherous ministers, if no formula is available, obtain it from the severing of metal, the decline of the market, and the offering of wine.\n\nFor those who wish to see the great flourishing of the Dao’s laws, obtain the formula through the verification and collation of all texts, and the oaths of ordinary people. For those who seek efficacious medicine, obtain the formula through the verification and collation of all medical texts, and test them.\n\nFor those who wish to swiftly attain Great Peace, obtain the formula by fully revealing the true texts and utterly eliminating the false and deceptive ones. For those who wish to cherish people and no longer kill or harm women, obtain the formula by allowing each to dwell in their place, providing for their clothing and food according to their ability, and preventing them from returning to the sorrow and suffering of their parents, thereby averting rebellion.\n\nTo eliminate illness and widely propagate the Dao, obtain the formula through the cinnabar script and the swallowing of characters. To know the formula for collecting and practicing the scriptures, follow their words and repeatedly exhort, strictly adhering to them. Practicing them for a single day shall dispel the harm of a hundred cunning hearts, and in one morning, all shall turn upright—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\n**Discourse on Auspicious Omens: One Hundred Seventy-Four**\n\nSomeone asked: What is the meaning of the term \"auspicious omen\"?\nWhy do you feign ignorance?\nI do not dare feign ignorance; I truly do not understand. I hope the Heavenly Master will not abandon me and will instruct me with a single word.\nProceed, sit calmly.\nAn auspicious omen is purity, tranquility, uprightness, correctness, focus, and unity. The heart aligns with Heaven and Earth, without violating the seasons’ commands.\nMay I ask how one knows it is pure, tranquil, upright, correct, focused, and unified?\nExcellent is your question. The nature of Heaven and Earth, from ancient times to the present, ensures that the good attain goodness, the evil attain evil, the upright attain uprightness, and the perverse attain perversity. This is the spontaneous method—there is nothing strange about it. Thus, when a person’s heart is upright, pure, tranquil, and utterly sincere, it moves Heaven, harboring no evil intent, and auspicious omens and good things shall manifest for them.\n\nWould you like further confirmation of this great trust? The great sages and worthies of antiquity all cultivated pure, tranquil, focused, and unified hearts, and thus were able to bring forth auspicious omens. Those who are treacherous and deceptive in their hearts shall receive no good responses. This is the great and luminous proof of Heaven and Earth.\nDo you understand?\nYes, I do.\nAre there also corresponding responses?\nIndeed, the perverse attain perversity—this too is their response. The disharmonious attain disharmony, and the harmonious attain harmony. This is the clear and evident response of Heaven.\nExcellent, excellent! Now this foolish student understands.\n\n**Loyalty and Filial Piety: On Presenting Rare Knowledge, Secret One Hundred Seventy-Five**\n\nMay I ask: when one does good, how should the most filial sons, the most loyal ministers, and the most obedient disciples regard their lords, fathers, and teachers?\n\nThey should present rare treasures—precious and seldom-seen texts. This is what it means to offer the highest.\n\nLoyal ministers, filial sons, and obedient disciples should always delight in such service. Why then do they not present common knowledge but instead offer rare knowledge?\n\nCommon knowledge is already possessed by their superiors. Why present it again?\n\nThis foolish student does not yet grasp the meaning.\n\nVery well, let me make it clear for you.\n\nOf all the treasures in the world, those most precious are the ones never before seen—presenting these to one’s lord is the act of a most loyal minister. Offering fine foods never before tasted to one’s parents is the act of a most filial son. Sharing teachings never before heard with one’s teacher is the act of a most obedient disciple.\n\nDo you understand now?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThen why, when presenting something already possessed, do they offer it again in excess?\n\nBecause such repeated offerings are done out of obligation, and the fault remains unabsolved.\n\nWhy is this so grave?\n\nYou still do not grasp it. What people already possess in abundance, they grow weary of—why present it again? To offer what they already disdain is called \"obligatory presentation.\" If one lowers oneself to such obligatory offerings, would you not consider it improper?\n\nThis foolish student now understands.\n\nThus, when one obtains auspicious omens and rare treasures—things seldom seen—they should be presented to one’s lord, father, or teacher. But what they already possess, take care never to present again.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, this has been the principle by which the great sages governed all affairs: discarding the common and selecting the rare, thereby aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth. This is the meaning of it.\n\nDo you now comprehend?\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\n**Scroll on Storing Away the Writings on Disasters and Illnesses, Secret Teachings, One Hundred Seventy-Six**\n\nMay I ask: Master of Heaven, how can one know when your writings should be put into practice, and how can one know when they should be concealed?\n\nDo you wish to understand this?\n\nObserve the signs of disasters and illnesses. When they emerge and afflict people, Heaven desires that the writings be stored away. When they retreat and afflict people, Heaven desires that the writings be brought forth and enacted.\n\nHow can this be further clarified?\n\nBy the movement of Heaven’s qi through the four seasons, which gives life and nurtures the myriad things, all follows Heaven’s will. If all things delight in emerging yet are forced into concealment, it is greatly inauspicious. If all things wish to retreat and hide yet are compelled to emerge, this too is greatly inauspicious. Both violate the mandate of Heaven, and great disasters will follow.\n\nDo you wish to delight in knowing Heaven’s ways? Whether Heaven delights in action or stillness is determined by these omens.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, whenever affairs are undertaken without thorough consideration, Heaven’s Dao is lost, and the burden of inheritance arises. This leads the people into lawlessness, disrupting Heaven’s correct Dao. Governance becomes disordered, and the people and the myriad things suffer unjustly.\n\nMay I ask: Lawlessness is a crime punishable by the most severe penalties—why does the Master of Heaven not establish heavy punishments and capital laws, meting out justice according to each offense?\n\nIn the present age, matters are judged according to their offenses to maintain balance. Why, then, does the Master of Heaven not punish lawlessness as it deserves?\n\nIt cannot be done.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause the ancients committed only minor errors in their practice of the Dao, which do not warrant punishment. Later generations inherit and accumulate these faults, turning them into transgressions. Though their actions may be empty and perverse, even to the point of death, later generations learn from their predecessors. Though they stray from Heaven’s Dao and govern through lawlessness, this is passed down from teacher to teacher, each instructing the next. It is not the fault of a single person, so they cannot be subjected to heavy penalties.\n\nConsider the sins of those in later ages—they are grave enough to warrant death. Yet the divine sages, in establishing laws, cannot suddenly impose heavy punishments and extinguish the generations of humankind. Therefore, Heaven sent me down to reform their conduct, remove their burdens, and without exposing their faults, allow Heaven, Earth, and humanity to govern together, causing spirits to afflict them with illness and disaster. Later generations will see this as the manifest efficacy of the teachings I received from Heaven.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe discourse complete, Heaven’s words ceased, and the transmission was entrusted to the Virtuous Lord.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, and ask no more.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**The above contains all the secret teachings on auspicious omens, recorded below.**\n\n*This concludes the one hundred eighth scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.\n*This begins the one hundred ninth scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.\n\n**Essential Record on the Two Hands of Heaven, Scroll One Hundred Seventy-Seven**\n\nHeaven possesses two hands, which together accomplish all matters. If one hand is afflicted with sickness or evil, nothing can be brought to completion. Heaven deeply resents this, Earth regards it as taboo, and the world falls into chaos without success—all due to the one hand’s malevolence and failure to join in effort. If all affairs remain unresolved and the six directions are not at great peace, it is likewise because the two hands are diseased or evil and do not unite their strength. Good fortune and misfortune, safety and peril—all arise from these two hands.\n\nPerfected One, do you truly comprehend this in depth?\n\nIf not, only the Heavenly Master can reveal its essential meaning, enabling you to understand. Otherwise, you will remain forever in darkness and confusion, with no way to attain this knowledge.\n\nThe Heavenly Master is the root of all teachings and transformations in Heaven and Earth. Though it is difficult, how could one refrain from speaking of it?\n\nExcellent indeed are the Perfected One’s inquiries into these matters!\n\nHas Heaven appointed you to raise these questions?\n\nThe words are essential and—\n\nYes.\n\nBe seated, and I shall fully expound this meaning for all the Perfected Ones.\n\nWhen the world models itself upon this and acts accordingly, no further misfortune or disorder will arise.\n\nThe gods of Heaven name this the \"Two Hands’ Strategy,\" a crucial record. If a nation practices it, it will endure long; if common people practice it, they will enjoy lasting prosperity.\n\nThe essential Dao is about to emerge, and it lies near within the body of ordinary people. Now, I shall distinguish and explain it for all the Perfected Ones.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the Two Hands that give birth to all things.\nThe Four Seasons are the Two Hands that transmit and nurture all beings.\nThe Five Phases are the Two Hands that transmit and complete the mutual bestowal of all things.\nMan and woman, husband and wife, are the Two Hands that transmit and continue the Yin and Yang of Heaven and Earth.\nMaster and disciple are the Two Hands that transmit and teach, enabling the circulation of all affairs, texts, and the Dao-virtue.\nRuler and minister are the Two Hands that transmit and govern all affairs, the people, and the myriad things.\n\nThese six matters merely lift the guiding principles to reveal their governance—there are more than can be written.\n\nAll affairs that rely upon one another to achieve completion are the Two Hands. In Heaven, this is called \"Overlapping Compasses and Repeating Squares,\" for all must correspond to one another.\n\nIf one hand is evil and unequal, nothing can be accomplished. In Heaven, this is called \"the governance of great disorder\"; in the six directions and eight distant regions, it is called \"widowers and childless heirs,\" and the sun daily wanes in brightness.\n\nNothing can be accomplished because these Two Hands do not unite their strength.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed!\n\nMay I ask why this is rightfully named the \"Two Hands\" in Heaven?\n\nExcellent is your question, for you have grasped its meaning.\n\nThe \"Two Hands\" signify their equal and united strength, with no advancing and no retreating, so that later affairs may be accomplished. If the Two Hands do not unite their strength, affairs cannot be accomplished.\n\nThus, all affairs should model themselves upon these Two Hands, each finding its proper person. When strength is united and hearts are of one mind, like these Two Hands, then the qi of good fortune, safety, and great peace will swiftly arrive.\n\nThose who do not model themselves upon these Two Hands will, for billions upon billions of years, be unable to bring forth the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign.\n\nThe qi of Supreme Peace constantly desires to emerge, just as Heaven constantly desires to act through these Two Hands. If they are not long harmonized and guided, they will remain blocked and unable to circulate, emerging to govern with frustration and resentment—what blame is there? The fault lies in these Two Hands not being harmonized.\n\nIf the Two Hands are balanced and harmonized, then the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign will emerge, arriving one after another without delay.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed!\n\nThus, if Heaven and Earth do not unite their strength, the myriad things and all affairs will have no way to emerge.\nIf the Four Seasons do not unite their strength, all things will have no way to grow.\nIf the Five Phases do not unite their strength, all things will have no way to be completed.\nIf ruler and minister do not unite their strength, all affairs will have no way to be governed.\nIf husband and wife do not unite their strength, descendants will have no way to flourish, and the family way will have no way to be established.\nIf master and disciple do not unite their strength, no knotted affairs will find resolution, the Dao-virtue will have no way to flourish, the dense fog will have no way to clear, and the great transformation of the six directions and eight distant regions will have no way to spread.\n\nThus, all must unite their strength, likening themselves to the Two Hands, so that all may be communicated. Without likening themselves to the Two Hands, misfortune will daily arise.\n\nEven if one seeks to remedy this, it will be of no benefit, and there will still be no way to achieve success. Only prolonged sorrow and suffering will follow, with misfortune growing day by day.\n\nTherefore, in modeling upon these Two Hands, selection and appointment must find the proper person. Those who do not find the proper person are, in the eyes of the gods of Heaven, \"half-dead.\" If one does not hold to both hands and act alone, how can there be any success or accomplishment of affairs?\n\nPerfected One, you have come from afar to inquire on behalf of Heaven. For all matters of doubt, you should deeply ponder this meaning with a sincere heart. The heart is born of fire, and it should return to be entrusted to fire, governing and modeling the people. Then, you will prolong your years and increase your lifespan, with not a single loss. I do not deceive you.\n\nConvey this to the virtuous ruler, convey it to the common people. Let the worthy each ponder its meaning, and let none dare to transgress it.\n\nTo employ this is called \"enriching and nurturing oneself\"; to not employ it is called \"bringing sorrow and suffering upon oneself.\"\n\nWondrous indeed is my Dao, for it is purely the will of Heaven. One may only advance and not retreat, only comply and not oppose. Compliance purely attains the heart of Heaven; opposition brings disorder. When disorder and calamity surge, human intent goes west while Heaven’s intent goes east—this is called \"being at odds with the will of Heaven.\"\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed! Go forth, for you may be said to have awakened to this knowledge.\n\n**The Four Auspicious and Four Inauspicious Decisions, One Hundred Seventy-Eight**\n\nPerfected One, when common people today recommend scholars to present to the emperor and entrust to the state, if they obtain the proper person, this is the first great inauspicious matter.\n\nIf the person is evil, then their learning is abandoned, defiling the legacy of former teachers and sages, and bringing misfortune upon their master—this is the second great inauspicious matter.\n\nMoreover, if those who recommend them are untrustworthy, jointly deceiving their superiors, presenting an improper person, disrupting the celestial order, and defiling the constellations, Heaven will detest them, Earth will resent them, the lord of the state will despise them, and sages and worthies will condemn them—such a one is a flattering, deceitful child of the age.\n\nFor this offense, if they are not punished by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, then people will surely harm them, disgracing their ancestors and bringing misfortune upon their wives, children, and descendants—this is the fourth great inauspicious matter.\n\nTo commit these four great inauspicious acts by presenting an improper person causes the emperor to suffer and grieve, and governance to become chaotic.\n\nOnce harmful qi stirs and arises, it cannot be stopped. Affairs before and after fall into disorder, with mutual blame and burden. Heaven and Earth grow furious, the host of spirits engage in battle, the six directions are displeased, the eight distant regions fall into discord, and for all time, there is no governance. In Heaven, this is called \"the tally of diminished years and shortened lifespan.\"\n\nWhy is this called \"the tally of shortened lifespan\"?\n\nWhen governance should be long, it is instead made short; when years should be many, they are instead made few. In all undertakings, one encounters misfortune, bringing no benefit to oneself. Heaven and Earth are displeased, deducting from one’s allotted years. Thus, in Heaven, this is called \"the tally of shortened lifespan.\"\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed! Foolish student, I have heard your command.\n\nYet you may be said to have grasped this in part. Guard this celestial text well, and present it to the virtuous lord, to all worthy ones, and to the worthy among the common folk.\n\nWhen one in high position seeks officers, one must examine them with care; when one in low position recommends officers, one must do so with loyalty. Let later generations transmit and recite this text, binding it within their hearts. If they hastily appoint officers without following this, Heaven and Earth will no longer be pleased. To know this and yet act contrary—how grave the transgression! Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\n“Yes, yes. I sincerely receive your instruction and dare not violate the prohibitions. I shall practice it with all my strength.”\n\nYou may be said to be prudent in affairs, having received the Mandate of Heaven.\n\n[Here ends] *The Celestial and Terrestrial Hand-Tally for Recommending Officers: Four Auspicious Signs, Four Inauspicious Signs, the Tally of Shortened Lifespan, the Tally of Extended Life, the Tally for Pacifying the State, and the Prophecy of Gaining the Hearts of Heaven and Earth and the Host of Spirits.*\n\n[*The following section is missing a large portion of text.* See the collated edition.]\n\n**The Book of Great Merit for Extending Years: Admonitions on Time, from the One Hundred Tenth Scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n\nThe Way of highest antiquity was to cultivate the self and rectify one’s conduct, never daring to transgress what the numinous spirits record. Only then did one dare seek life and petition for survival from the Celestial Lord, never daring to act wantonly, fearing one’s wholeness would not be preserved. Daily, one contemplated the vitality of life, serving the spirits as a subject and manifesting one’s kind. One desired to offer words of utmost loyalty and uprightness, and to the spirits governing each domain, one clearly distinguished right from wrong, only then daring to trust in the governance of fairness. How could one forget this even for a moment?\n\nAbove, there are those who observe humanity, fully discerning right from wrong. What can be concealed? What can be disbelieved? Thus, one attains self-governance, seeking to contemplate the root of all things, never entering even the slightest realm of ungoodness. One merely cherishes being human, relying upon and revering the primordial qi, so that even the creeping and moving creatures do not witness calamities and anomalies. Yet humans betray trust in their sworn words, and mutual disbelief arises, leading to unrest.\n\nWithin Heaven and Earth, the harmony of above and below each maintains its own trust. Humans do not comprehend its essentials, yet ask why there is good and evil alone. From whence do all calamities and anomalies arise? Humans ingest the qi of the Five Constants, receiving and relying upon it in all things, moving through all things. Why then do they alone fail to honor and understand it? From ancient times, have there been those who knew how to extend goodness to others?\n\nThis is to lose goodness and follow evil, causing one’s life to be incomplete. How can this be right? Thus, the Celestial Lord declares that there is good and there is evil, and goodness can be made uniform. The reason for this is that there must be distinction. One cannot follow one’s own inclinations: goodness should ascend, and evil should be punished. How can evil be allowed to reach goodness?\n\nFrom human perspective, this too is understandable, for there are those who ought to be upright. Thus, evil is established to clarify the intentions of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, so that one may know that completing life and engendering existence are of utmost importance, thereby extending one’s years of life. Having received the Dao of life and completion, one upholds its prohibitions and dares not transgress its taboos.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Heaven knows the foolishness of humans is profound, yet harbors no intent for retribution. To oppose what Heaven enacts, to contradict what Heaven ordains, and to impose upon others what one enacts—this is to invert the proper order, rewarding evil and punishing goodness. Thus, the sage understands the convergence of yin and yang, the worthy one governs fairness and rectitude, resolving what is unknown, so that each knows their allotted portion and does not resent others. Goodness naturally extends life, and evil naturally shortens it. What is there to doubt or resent?\n\nAre humans truly inferior to the six domestic animals, birds that fly, beasts that run, and creatures of the water? Is it that humans are without form, and Heaven makes it so? Heaven desires only that humans do good and does not wish them to do evil. If good and evil were to share the same suffering and joy, then wealth, honor, longevity, and old age—all that Heaven enacts above—would be unable to distinguish beauty from ugliness, allowing ignorant people to boast, saying, “I am equal to you all.” What need is there for practicing goodness? Thus, goodness is advanced and extended, prolonging life. Those of shallow understanding consider it equal.\n\nThose who compare themselves to evildoers who lose their lives and then wish to correct their errors, follow goodness, and turn away from evil—day and night, they examine and reflect upon themselves, repaying what they have owed. Though they may not ascend as immortals or transcend the world, they may complete their allotted years without dying prematurely. This is sufficient.\n\nThe advantage of ordinary people lies only in the fleeting moment. Not contemplating long life, they may yet rise to become those who understand, possessing the heart that seeks life, and thus refrain from evil. Heaven sees their goodness and allows them to act with ease, further seeking wealth and descendants. Though they may not attain all, they still have hope. Why then persist in evil, inviting long destruction, believing they may complete their years? They do not know that Heaven dispatches spirits to record their deeds—no transgression, great or small, escapes Heaven’s knowledge.\n\nThe registers of good and evil are examined and tallied by the year, month, and day. From past to present, years are deducted, and if evil does not cease, one is brought before the Ghost Gate. The Earth Spirit summons and interrogates them, comparing their words and deeds. If they remain unrepentant, they are tormented by the suffering ghosts until they submit. Their names are then sent to the Celestial Bureau for final reckoning. When their tally is exhausted, they are to enter the earth, and their transgressions will flow into future lives. Is this not the result of evil?\n\nWhy do humans not desire life? Having no mirror to see themselves, whom can they blame? Among children born in the same month, why does one alone persist in evil without cease? How can they hope for longevity? The calculations of the foolish scholar—why do they not align even with small goodness?\n\nThey pursue trivial and non-urgent matters along the Way, each person’s actions differing in their schemes. They believe their own way is right, yet in all they touch and transgress, they seek only their own benefit, while others do not wish to benefit them. The benefit of goodness brings fleeting life; the benefit of evil does not endure. With goodness, one does not long remain upon the earth.\n\nDoes Heaven and Earth not know this? Heaven causes humans to do good, thus giving them life, yet they turn to evil. Thus, the ghost that presides over evil follows them relentlessly. If they do not cease, other ghosts ascend, each generating their own affairs, so that the ghosts follow the person without respite.\n\nDo you not understand? This scripture first advances goodness and retreats evil—such is the literature of past and present. Yet if one does not follow the path to long life and instead pursues evil, there is nothing to be done; the ghosts cannot be exonerated. Thus, those who transgress vanish into the earth. Their spirit is not at peace, and they know not where to rest—whose fault is this?\n\nLet each person reflect deeply upon their conduct, seeking ease and tranquility without wrongdoing. Their words and phrases may repeat, their teachings may not be singular, hence the repetition. Your life lies close within yourself—why then do you strike your breast and cry out to Heaven? If you do not purify yourself, whom should you purify? If you do not cherish yourself, whom should you cherish? If you do not perfect yourself, whom should you perfect? If you do not reflect upon yourself, upon whom should you reflect? If you do not reproach yourself, whom should you reproach?\n\nPonder these words, and you will bear no grudge against ghosts and spirits. When they witness goodness, they affirm goodness; when they witness evil, they affirm evil—all is not the same. Do you understand this? If words cease briefly but evil does not, the written records will not end; only when the person perishes will they stop. This warning makes clear that evil is self-inflicted, not imposed upon others—do you understand?\n\nAct in accordance with these words, and let them never leave your heart; to depart from them is to invite ruin. If you cannot be redeemed, you will share the company of ghosts—how then can you live? To contemplate life is to attain life—this is wisdom. Evil will inevitably come to an end and cannot endure—do you not understand this?\n\nYet again, some engage in trivial matters. All who dwell between Heaven and Earth are granted the gift of being human—how can they forget the grace of Heaven and Earth? What manner of folly is this? If they cannot change, what hope remains? If they desire Heaven’s reward, they must reproach themselves, weeping with sincerity as they act. They say, *\"I have received the grace to be human, set apart from all things. Heaven has bestowed upon me distinction—speech, discernment of beauty and ugliness, knowledge of good and evil. How can I not attend to these matters?\"* Yet their words defy Heaven, and their disobedience marks them as the most rebellious and unprincipled of people. How can Heaven long abide such conduct?\n\nThus, malevolent spirits are dispatched. The ancient observations return, echoing the words spoken: the person does not incline toward goodness. The Heavenly Lord declares, *\"The records have not ceased. The department overseer shall descend to seize their soul, their bones and flesh entrusted to the earthly lord. There is no need for delay.\"* The wicked cannot be repeatedly admonished, so they bring ruin upon themselves through their own wrath. They return to refinement, transforming their evil, gathering all virtues and internalizing them, placing the heart within the heart.\n\nThe spirits say, *\"We receive the heart’s decree from Heaven, charged to follow the human heart without the slightest deviation. Good and evil are immediately witnessed by attendant spirits, who also perceive the heart.\"* The spirits grow ever more sorrowful, uncertain of fortune or misfortune, and thus they fear being counted among the ranks of the wicked. Day and night, they reflect, unsure where to place themselves, and so they dare not entertain even the slightest unvirtuous thought. They rely solely on the forbearance of the gods, allowing them to reproach themselves. If they disregard divine admonitions, they will be punished without resentment.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord sends a great spirit to declare: *\"This person has reproached themselves and repented of their transgressions, no longer violating the prohibitions. Grant them forbearance, grant them forbearance. If they later commit wrongdoing, it will not be too late to seize them.\"* The spirits, seeing their words and ceaseless sighs, fear that their transgressions may not yet be fully expunged. Long cut off from the qi of the Great Yang, they remain among the ranks of the dead, growing ever more afflicted, uncertain of what to do. Though they have received the decree to exhort, they have not yet attained understanding. In quietude, they examine themselves, reproaching the faults they bear and offering thanks to Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and all the spirits of their departments.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord listens, commanding them to reflect deeply. The people of antiquity possessed wisdom and foresight, never daring to violate the prohibitions. They cultivated and corrected themselves, fearing any lapse, for even the slightest misstep would be seen as defiance of the mandate, forfeiting their years. For this reason, they dared not relax even slightly. Every transgression incurred punishment, and thus they constantly examined and cherished themselves, revering the prohibitions and never daring to harbor wayward thoughts. When reproached, their hearts trembled with fear, their qi dismayed. They bore the burden of Heaven’s heart, for even the slightest discrepancy would bring verbose records and immediate investigation to verify the truth.\n\nTheir words and trustworthiness could earn them renown, yet if they lacked integrity, their years would soon be lost. Thus, they reflected unceasingly, never losing sight of their own hearts, ever fearful and anxious, never daring to rest. They acted with restraint, always longing and yearning, desiring to align with Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, bearing the mandate together without the slightest error or deviation. Their hearts chastised themselves, ever mindful of the profound intent before and behind them, never straying from constancy. They cherished grace and never violated sincerity, desiring life and hoping to live—how could even the smallest evil reach the ears above?\n\nThey bound their bodies and conducted themselves in accordance with duty, never daring to slacken, fearing they could not fulfill the highest intent. They knew not what to do, their hearts ever more anxious, finding no solace in self-comfort. The gift of Heaven’s longevity is difficult to obtain; once lost, it cannot be regained. Having long distanced themselves from the vulgar, to be suddenly cut down midway—how could they not look below in dismay? Thus, they admonished themselves with trembling reverence.\n\nEver fearful that even the slightest discrepancy might lead to their dismissal, sorrow and melancholy filled their hearts as they reproached themselves for their faults. Having received Heaven’s grace, they sought to fulfill their former mandate, never forgetting the pangs of hunger and thirst, content merely to live. The great spirits, moved by compassion, recorded and instructed the common people, who received qi from the Heavenly Kitchen and rode upon the qi of Heaven. Yet their conduct was meager, their duties many, and they could not afford the slightest lapse.\n\nThough their bodies were humble and unworthy of honor, they were not despised for their unworthiness. Truly, with their hearts, they sought advancement and the pursuit of life. They entreated the great spirits to review their words, allowing them to witness the generative and transformative power of the four seasons and Five Phases, and to see the difficulty of repaying the sun and moon. They feared being cast aside midway. The upright and diligent dared not distance themselves, prostrating themselves in devotion.\n\nThe great spirits declared: *\"This person has followed the teachings of their master to such an extent—why should they fear lacking protection?\"*\n\nIn times past, there was such a person whom Heaven, in its mercy, kept close at hand. Now, having served long in office and grown rich in knowledge and foresight, all that they knew of antiquity was profound. Whatever they spoke found favor in the heart of the Heavenly Lord.\n\nThus, they prostrated themselves, weeping upon the earth, and spoke: *\"Awakened by your decree, I recall the loyal and sincere hearts of those who came before. All that I have learned and known, I hold within and heed—how dare I compare myself to those of former times?\"*\n\nThe great spirits replied: *\"We speak to one of trustworthy word, that you may emulate and compare your conduct to theirs. Yet some fall short in their time.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"Great spirits, you have made all things clear and distinct. Among the many, I alone am singled out for favor, granted insight and reflection—this grace is most profound. When shall I ever repay the great spirits?\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Reflection arises from within; it is the fervent thought that repays.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I know not how to offer my devotion. Though Heaven bestows rare and wondrous treasures, I think only of presenting them in return. Moved by your decree, I stir my resolve and contemplate with fervor. This is true acceptance, not mere words of empty courtesy. Day and night, I ponder without ceasing, never daring to slacken.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"The admonitions are many, and the remonstrances come not from one alone. That we speak to you at such length is out of deep regard for your sincerity. Your words reveal profound favor and exceptional mercy.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, hearing this, summoned the great spirits and asked: *\"From whence did this disciple arise, to merit such extraordinary words from the great spirits?\"*\n\nThe great spirits replied: *\"This learner is especially trustworthy, and thus we speak of the difficulty and ease of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"To see the good and advance it, bringing one to such a state—this is as it should be.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"The Heavenly Lord’s inquiry confirms this trustworthy disciple.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I dare not hope to stand at the left side of Heaven. I wish only to remain in a place without office, exerting myself in loyalty.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All must have a domain to govern, that their trustworthiness may be seen in reason.\"*\n\nThus, by such sincerity, they were deemed fortunate indeed, attaining great distinction. They dared not fall short in even the smallest measure.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple, transformed thus, should advance further and may yet equal the ancients.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I dare not seek long life—it is what others covet.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This is Heaven’s wish.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"It is only by the great spirits’ protection that I dare not transgress their warnings.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, knowing of these two who admonished and instructed one another, approved deeply and commanded them to teach each other.\n\nThe Way of the sages of highest antiquity arose naturally. Their hearts knew the governance of Heaven above, and all they enacted was foreknown. Their voices resonated clearly, and they understood forms and appearances, perceiving the heart’s brightness and the mind’s enlightenment. They knew what must be saved, the convergence of fortune and misfortune, all clearly discerned. Within their hearts, they rejoiced, knowing they had received Heaven’s blessing. They saw the affairs of those who came before, all cautioned with earnest clarity.\n\nReflecting on the grace of their favor and encounter, having long accompanied the six spirits and received their teachings and warnings, they were kept from peril. Gazing upon the four directions, above and below all was open and unobstructed, their sorrow deepening. Yet their hearts rejoiced, drawing near to their appointed time, attaining even what they had not heard—all through the transformative power of Heaven’s great spirits.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All the spirits know this: those who advance have their destiny. The records are true, and before their birth, their years, months, days, and hours are inscribed in the Bureau of Longevity. Their years increase, and their names are made known, governed by the Perfected One of the North Pole. Their bones are transformed, their bodies become light and lustrous, radiating brilliance. At the appointed time, they receive the elixir, refining their essence. Wherever they go, their transformations are unfailing. They move from the subtle to the hidden, traversing the space of a single hair—what is there they cannot penetrate?\"*\n\nThe sage said: *\"Truly, those who follow the common ways, who eat what the earth provides, whose yin spirits emerge—how can they not be esteemed? The ease of transformation is itself the highest ease.\"*\n\nThe great spirits’ grace cannot be repaid; their merit is vast, their favor profound. The thought of such great kindness is unbearable. Even in moments of respite, their depth is beyond words to repay.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Heaven endows human life and destiny in equal measure. This is not by the will of the great spirits. To see the good and recommend them is the blessing of the spirits—what repayment is needed? Yet, fearing future doubts, we impose strict prohibitions, that the sages may instruct and later generations may understand. The sages know of themselves; no decrees are needed.\"*\n\nThe sage said: *\"Though I have received such favor and my name is recorded, there may yet be teachings I fail to grasp.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple’s words are fittingly humble—this is as it should be.\"*\n\nThe disciple, offering repeated thanks, expressed all that was needed. *\"Only by the great spirits’ grace is my resolve fulfilled. Though I am but one among many, I dare not grow complacent or arrogant. I ask to exert myself further in quiet seclusion, heeding the great spirits’ teachings and mindful of my inadequacies.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All that has been said, before and after, is clear. There is nothing more to admonish.\"*\n\nThey parted, each reflecting on the other’s words.\n\nThe disciple said: *\"From the day I received the precepts, I have not dared to slacken even for a moment. Yet I fear I may not see them through to the end. Only by your support may I live and hope again. My heart is ever inclined toward you. May the great spirits, from time to time, remember and instruct me—this grace is no small thing.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple’s words are fitting indeed.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"Indeed, indeed. I dare not rely on myself for defense.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Those who attain renown benefit from diligent progress, and their domains are not few.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, hearing the exchange between the great spirits and the sage, deemed them persons of understanding and commanded that they not grow negligent. Their destinies would reach boundless longevity. Each returned to their domain, and when they saw the good, they advanced them to the great spirits.\n\nThe sage said: *\"Having all received the Heavenly Lord’s teaching, we will strive with all our might, never growing weary in our efforts.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"Those who become perfected do so by their own efforts.\"*\n*\"Indeed, indeed.\"*\n\nOnly the Dao-attaining persons of highest antiquity, even before the establishment of laws and registers, were recorded in the *Scriptures of Longevity*. When the time of the stars’ conjunction arrives, their names are transmitted to the Central Ultimate. The Central Ultimate is also called Kunlun. The domain overseers must go and record the names of these persons without omission. They are repeatedly sent to activate their limbs and joints, bending and extending, turning and inclining, instructing and admonishing them. The spirits follow their flexing and bowing, administering medicinal draughts to open and refine their bones and joints. Though they may not meet often, they know whether one is steadfast or not, for their resolve does not waver.\n\nThose who covet life and abhor decay aspire to join the gods of heaven. The spirits are frequently dispatched to verify their years and accomplishments, and only then are they permitted to receive the *Scriptures of Insufficiency*. Their spoken words and utterances are made known so they may understand the prohibitions and defenses to be observed. These teachings are transmitted to learners, who must not disregard the divine texts. If one claims to have brought their own books to completion, the spirits will recognize their words in conversation. After accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days, they are led to meet the great spirits, to circulate primordial *qi*, and to practice spontaneity.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord reviewed the secret decrees and commanded that all investigations be conducted without private trust or biased intent, lest the heart be swayed and the mind altered, leading to errors in conduct. The great spirits said: *\"We have calculated the provisions lent by all the spirits. On the last day of the eighth month each year, the registers of all mountains, seas, mounds, marshes, connecting rivers, bridges, the Huai, Ji, Yangtze, and lakes—recording all that enters and exits—must be clearly divided.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord’s rewards and labor records are signed before him and repeatedly verified, then stored in the Golden Chamber. Those with sincere hearts are appointed to answer the Heavenly Lord’s inquiries. They must heed his teachings day and night without negligence. The chamber attendants must not lose track of their assigned domains. Separate records are kept to identify those with sincere hearts, and their names are duly registered.\n\nThe spirit envoys are tasked with tallying the names of all who ascend or descend. One hundred days in advance, all documents must be submitted without omission or error. If any document is inconsistent or the accounting officials fail to act, they will be held jointly liable. Prior decrees forbid violating the words of the divine texts. Three years and eight months after the release of this text, it may be shown to the common people. Those who possess the *Scriptures of Daoist Faith* may be shown it in full.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructed: *\"This person bears prior burdens. Command the spirits to resolve and conceal them. Those not yet concealed must be concealed.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This person has long suffered poverty and emptiness, fearing they cannot preserve themselves. Having gained the Heavenly Lord’s trust, the spirits are ordered to conceal their records. If their overseer has not yet concealed them, they may not fulfill their words as promised.\"*\n\nPreviously, they had petitioned for decrees, offered thanks, and received grace. Though the appointed time has not yet arrived, all concerned are to be notified one month in advance. The Heavenly Lord said: *\"Among the spirits, generals, soldiers, and people in the fields and lands below, none must miss the time for concealment. Record their names so that the earth spirits may revere and guard them. Let the divine powers come and go, and those who seek to fulfill their wishes may do so in good faith. Thereafter, they must be cautious.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Thus, all within the seas will hear and know. Those who love the Dao will support and uphold one another, serving and revering it.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"Those who have merit shall naturally be revered.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This person’s years are not yet complete, and their allotted time has not arrived. We request that when the time comes, they be taught how to repay their gratitude. For now, their dwelling remains empty, and they have nothing to clothe themselves. Let those who possess the Dao provide them with sustenance until the appointed time.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"This is a small matter. Let the celestial offices provide for their households—those with households and sincere hearts.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"We request that it be done as instructed. Command the celestial officials to provide what is due. This person has long been empty; let them be given enough to eat.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Order the celestial officials to record their names and ensure they do not suffer want.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"Well said.\"*\n\nOnly the people of highest antiquity all received the responses of heaven. Those with faith could succeed, and upon receiving their mandate, they were protected and watched over by the spirits, who feared any deficiency. Day and night, they divined their fate. Seeing them do good, they assisted and rejoiced; they did not wish to hear of their wrongdoing. They were placed in the offices of longevity, their hearts set on goodness, never turning to evil. They were encouraged to advance in virtue, fostering filial piety, loyalty, and obedience.\n\nThose who received and practiced the teachings dared not act on their own will but followed the instructions. Others might call them ignorant, but the spirits saw and knew them. When someone showed great kindness or compassion, they rejoiced in their own strength. Yet if others remained suspicious after long acquaintance, they detested such mistrust above all, fearing it would lead to their own ruin. They restrained and disciplined themselves, dreading offense against evil persons, living in constant trepidation, uncertain of what to do.\n\nHeaven endows people with knowledge of good and evil. Those who practice goodness with faith—heaven does not wish to hear of their wrongdoing. Thus, they covet life and abhor death, daring not to violate prohibitions, lest they harm themselves. Therefore, by aligning with the *qi* of heaven, they engage in discourse with those who commune with the Dao. Their words flow freely, understanding human sentiments. Seeing another’s misdeeds, they withdraw and reproach themselves, fearing that their names might be sullied in the records.\n\nIf one’s intent at the time is to bestow favor upon another, one must not dare to confront them directly with intricate reasoning but instead reflect on one’s own conduct. Failing to please others, one’s transgressions multiply and are difficult to erase. Thus, when people come to regret their actions, their circumstances shift, and their sharpness wanes, believing their fate can be regained. Yet heaven sends the great spirits to divine their fortunes, and the omens are dire. They enter the earth prematurely, and so they console themselves, enduring in silence, daring not to incur further wrong.\n\nEven slight deviations in their words or intentions, having received heaven’s grace, are granted a brief respite to revive and sustain the hope of long life—this is heaven’s dispensation. Thus, they gain a share of intent, though their lives may not endure long. For this reason, they grow ever more despondent, their hearts filled with shame and remorse.\n\nThey long to meet the heavenly spirits, to seek compassion, instruction, and admonition, to illuminate what they do not know, and to prepare for what is to come. If their hearts align with heaven’s will, they may attain a small measure of their desires. Those who covet advancement and deliberation ponder good and evil alike, striving to avoid the decrees they cannot see.\n\nThen the great spirit appeared, and the seeker, both bitter and willing, spoke of their own life. Those who cling to worldly desires and covet advancement thus cultivate and rectify themselves. Only the great spirit’s decree exposes their insufficiencies, awakening them to hope for admonition from the left side. The great spirit, in compassion, examines those who seek life.\n\nThe great spirit asked: \"Why惜 the prohibitions and precepts?\" Reflect deeply upon this. Let your words each express your true feelings, but fear they may not match your speech. Consider carefully, for thoughts arise from the heart and should be pondered thoroughly.\n\nThe seeker replied: \"Overwhelmed with gratitude and fear for what I have received, how dare I not speak from the heart?\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Such resolve is commendable. Return now to a quiet place and reflect. Seek only where you find insufficiency.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am slow of understanding and lacking in wisdom, yet to fully grasp the manifest precepts. I prostrate myself, awaiting your instruction, before daring to advance further.\"\n\nThe great spirit replied: \"If you devote yourself with utmost sincerity, merit may yet be attained. Strive and reflect upon your life thus far—your progress in merit, the resolution of your ancestors’ burdens, and the lifting of those burdens. When transgressions are exhausted, you shall ascend. What doubt remains? Be cautious in your words and guard against wayward thoughts.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"Having received your decree and admonition, I dare not withhold effort in pursuing goodness. Yet if I alternate between good and evil, I toy with my own fate.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Even the virtuous should humble themselves. Though their days of toil may bring momentary hardship, if they persist without wavering, blessings shall follow.\"\n\nThe seeker, having received the decree, withdrew to a secluded place, reflecting on their faults and reproaching themselves.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Thoughts that arise from within are known to the heavenly spirits. Do not grow weary.\"\n\nThe seeker persisted until the end of their years.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"With such conduct, why fear failure to advance? The Heavenly Lord, having heard of this, further charged the great spirit to observe those who seek progress, recording their deeds over months and years, assigning each to their proper rank. Those with merit shall ascend, their names filling vacancies.\n\nIn ancient times, the hearts, words, and speech of people were attuned to human nature, governing without artifice. Their inner and outer selves were in harmony, and none betrayed their trust. Heaven’s essential decrees, when violated, brought swift disgrace, and transgressors were promptly questioned and held accountable for their faults. Thus, they trembled all the more.\n\nMoved by the boundless grace of heaven, which allows them to remain whole as humans and discern right from wrong, they ponder how to repay such profound kindness. Though their hearts yearn to advance with loyalty and sincerity, and though they strive in word and deed to uphold every command without the slightest deviation—fearing that even minor lapses might be reported to the spirits above, cutting short their allotted years—they grow ever more sorrowful and anxious, unable to find solace, yet hoping to repay heaven’s benevolence.\n\nTruly, they covet life and, together with the heavenly spirits, align with heaven’s will. For those with goodness, even minor transgressions are absolved, allowing them to fulfill their years. Those with great merit may have their lives extended and their years increased. Serving the primordial *qi*, uniting essence and radiance, they perceive all that is known and receive profound grace—beyond words to repay, their hearts alone left uncertain.\n\nOnly the great spirits, in their compassion, record and examine, offering instruction to enlighten their understanding. They come to know heaven’s many decrees and prohibitions, which must be upheld without fail.\n\nThe great spirits, ever mindful of their insufficiencies, admonish them not to forget their duty, nor the grace that sustains their lives.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"You are one who understands. What further instruction is needed? Simply follow heaven’s will and do not oppose it. Upon receiving admonitions, act upon them at once without omission. This is how one aligns with heaven’s intent. Rewards and punishments vary in weight—each must be met with sincerity, without error. Even minor precepts should be heeded. Consider your words carefully, ensuring they are practicable. Should small falsehoods arise, reflect inwardly and turn toward goodness—this is a minor precept. All else in life’s conduct should be deeply guarded, lest you fail the spirits’ intent.\n\nFrom childhood, you have not yet grasped the greater duty. Thus, the great spirits repeatedly admonish you. Their insight is vast, their wisdom boundless, encompassing all things. The great spirits urge you to embrace their virtue and not oppose their words. Reflect deeply and await further admonition.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"These words reveal heaven’s dispensations, the knowledge of earthly conduct, and the ways of all things in between. The laws correspond without discrepancy. Those who instruct you follow their masters—simply do not oppose them.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am resolved to uphold the precepts. Though the laws are uniform, my understanding of their intent remains shallow. Heaven’s will is difficult to fathom.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"All this is true and without deceit. Those who foresee the Heavenly Lord’s intentions are foremost among people, worthy to stand at his left side. For their merit, they receive rewards, yet they remain humble, refusing to accept all, and strive ever harder, their minds refined and their efforts great. Thus, the Heavenly Lord personally charges and instructs them—this is your fortune. With many under your care, govern with an impartial heart. This is sufficient.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I dare not aspire to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side. To live is enough. I think only of loyalty and filial piety, fulfilling my duties according to principle. I dare not accept great rewards, fearing I lack merit. Yet when even small deeds bear fruit, my life grows brighter, and I see my days prolonged. My thoughts are boundless, never ceasing to reflect on my faults, even for a moment. To receive your gentle words fills my heart to overflowing. The great spirit dwells with me, guiding without need for thought. Truly, I have received grace—moving between heaven and earth, occasionally admonished—this is the great spirit’s benevolence, beyond repayment. My heart’s longing remains ever present, never wavering.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, having heard this, knew that the conduct of such a learned person never fails to fulfill their aspirations. Those who constantly examine their own faults and harbor no ill intentions—when the great spirits admonish and instruct them—ascend without weariness. The most virtuous of people are born of nature itself, each with their own destined record, inscribed in the register of goodness, named the *Record of the Virtuous*. They consistently embody virtuous conduct, never bearing an evil reputation. In all their movements, whether going or coming, only good intentions are heard, never evil—thus they are called *the virtuous*. Their every action advances them among others; the multitude marvels at what they cannot see, and they attain the highest reverence. Those in high station observe them, some admiring their words, some coveting their virtuous deeds, some their sincerity, some their beloved presence, some their filial loyalty, some their long-standing counsel, or their trustworthiness—such is the excellence of the virtuous. Thus they are named *virtuous*. At times, they receive favor and glory, yet still desire to wander long, to attain the state of spirit immortals, to reach the rank of deathlessness, or to command the host of spirits—these are the desires of the virtuous. Their conduct, revering goodness, aligns with the trust of heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases; the spirits cherish them, the wise instruct one another, rare texts and extraordinary strategies are shared, and vacancies are filled through mutual recommendation and assurance. Even minor disagreements are corrected through admonition, and precious treasures are exchanged. Together, they ascend to the heavenly spirits, seeking reverence, correction, and reflection on their faults, fearing they may not measure up to the great spirits of heaven. Day and night, their hearts advance with steadfast devotion; they embrace goodness from within, yearn to hear virtuous words, and hold fast to loyalty and integrity. They cherish their lives and years, ever fearful of even a moment’s lapse into slight unvirtuousness. When they hear of others’ faults, they aid in their repentance. They guide those with understanding, heed good counsel, adopt others’ words, and witness their glory. They teach others to seek the Dao of life and the path to survival—this is the utmost of the virtuous. Yet they dare not defy the wishes of the spirits, their longing ever present, and they attain what others aspire to. Only the great spirits of heaven, mastering all discourse, inspect and command their conduct, enforcing prohibitions. Even minor lapses are met with forbearance, allowing them to reflect on their intentions. Heaven’s grace is vast, its compassion boundless, enabling self-reflection, repentance, and prolonged life—this is the great dispensation of fate. Yet they fear failing to fully repay this grace, and only the great spirits pardon their shortcomings. They wish to receive unseen admonitions, to dwell in joyful reflection, their aspirations broad and far-reaching, ever mindful of repeated instructions.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Heaven and earth each have their own patterns. To know how to advance but not how to retreat—this is natural. They do not withhold admonition or instruction out of reluctance. When they see the virtuous, what doubt remains? What further correction is needed? Simply ponder their words carefully, and act accordingly. This is the aspiration of the virtuous, and it is fitting to make it clear.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am unworthy, my conduct impure. Thus I have personally received the great spirits’ prohibitions and admonitions. Repeatedly, I have been shown great favor, my thoughts ever remembered, and my presence openly acknowledged. Yet I return again, insatiable—heaven has made it so.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"You have received your nature from the Dao; heaven sent you to inquire, knowing your alignment—or lack thereof. What cause for suspicion is there? Those who secretly wish to receive instructions speak only from their true feelings, with few embellished words. Few are those who correct themselves from the heart, hence vacancies are filled through mutual supplementation. Your shortcomings are evident; you must remain vigilant and not grow lax.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"My nature is slow and dull. Though I strive not to err, I rely on written precepts for restraint. I can only lament my inadequacy.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"This too arises from understanding. Knowing goodness, one acts with goodness; knowing trust, one acts with trust; knowing loyalty, one acts with loyalty; knowing obedience, one acts with obedience; knowing filial piety, one acts with filial piety. How could evil ever gain ground? You understand this yourself—thus I emphasize it further.\"\n\nThe seeker, deeply moved, said: \"What I have heard is the greatest goodness. Within it lies profound admonition. The great spirits’ teachings are thus—how dare I harbor any thought of negligence? This is the intent that sustains my life. To receive such favor, I know not how to repay the great spirits’ grace.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"These matters are observed, yet they need not serve as admonition. Reflect on what can be practiced, and your name will surely be established. Ascend without doubt; your conduct will naturally attain it. What need is there for repayment or gratitude? Your words are already virtuous—there is nothing more to be said.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"These admonitions prolong my life, giving me hope for survival. I will ponder your words in my ignorance.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Know that your words must not depart from your heart. Those who come to learn have always been admonished thus, before and after.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"Who would willingly instruct me so?\"\n\nThe seeker’s fate and life delighted the great spirits. They summarized all prior instructions, yet he felt he could never match such grace, ashamed and at a loss.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, having heard this, said: \"This is the excellence of the excellent, the finest among the virtuous. It may be applied across all departments without fail.\"\n\nThe great spirit relayed to the seeker: \"The Heavenly Lord’s command is thus gracious. You must not transgress it.\" The seeker assented.\n\nThose of supreme virtue dwell between heaven and earth, accomplishing the work of transformation, each fulfilling their aspirations. The virtuous are inscribed in the *Record of Goodness*, never deviating from constancy or propriety—this is supreme virtue. Nothing remains unaccomplished, nothing unachieved. They do not lose their clarity or their truth, nor do they fail in the generation of yin and yang, the ingress and egress of the life-giving qi of the four seasons, the completion of the five phases, the courses of the sun, moon, and stars, their measured cycles, the timing of fortune and misfortune, the signs of calamity and anomaly, the records of flood and drought, or the length of human life—never losing the essence of their allotted fate as determined by the stars. This is the conduct befitting those of supreme virtue.\n\nThus it is said: the person of virtue illuminates all without exception, perceives all without obstruction—above, below, and at the center, each attaining its proper harmony. In accordance with their virtue, none lose their rightful name. This is the scripture of constancy and long life, from which none fail to receive glory.\n\nAll things sprout forth, breaking through their husks to grow; they droop their branches and spread their leaves, serving as garments. Mist, dew, frost, snow, and timely rain serve as drink and food. They grow and mature, their foliage and fruit providing cover, sustaining the earth’s bounty—known as the \"water mother,\" called by the people \"melon.\" In the scorching heat of high summer, it serves as water and broth, relied upon by all under heaven, consumed by young and old alike. Such is the virtuous person, who bears the mandate of heaven, completing heaven’s form upon the earth to provide sustenance for the people. Bestowing kindness and spreading bounty, none are left untouched by their virtue, thus filling themselves to abundance—this is the grace of heaven.\n\nYet it is not so. Heaven’s bestowal of life is vast, and to defy its decree by claiming all is \"natural\" is to invite deafening rebuke. Therefore, the virtuous person, understanding heaven’s intent, instructs the people in the proper way, never straying from heaven’s will, nurturing growth and maturity so that they may become fully human. Those who further comprehend the patterns of scripture, whose conduct perfects virtue, may ascend to the ranks of the celestial scholars.\n\nIn the affairs of heaven, merits are graded by distinction. The virtuous person presides over the affairs of earth, enabling the people to depend upon and witness anew the grace bestowed. Yet they cannot repay it in full measure. When the virtuous act as heaven’s agents in circulating qi—above, below, and at the center—those who fail to receive their due turn and belittle heaven’s works. This is precisely what provokes heaven’s unceasing wrath, causing the spirits to withhold their love for humanity, encroaching upon lifespans. Yet people blame heaven instead of themselves—how profound their folly!\n\nThus, the divine scriptures are sent down, establishing commands and prohibitions to firmly restrain the people from transgression. Those who foresee coming events, shun evil and pursue good, and do not violate the prohibitions will further witness the transformations wrought by heaven’s teachings, none failing to follow them. Therefore, the ruler is made their ally, guiding head and tail, completing their works like the walls of a city, clear and discernible for all to know.\n\nThey understand the great transformations above and regulate the primordial qi, while also comprehending human affairs. These are people of fortune and destiny, all foreknown. As they transform in accord with others, their allotted time may be extended, and heaven cherishes them. Benevolent spirits follow and protect them, shielding them from harm. Their hearts incline toward goodness, and the wicked cannot compare. Thus, heaven values goodness, allowing them to fulfill their aspirations, neither encroaching nor overpowering, but maintaining equilibrium. Those of exceptional ability who surpass in goodness have their lifespans further increased by heaven, spared from peril and entanglement in wrongdoing—this is great grace indeed.\n\nHow can one hesitate to repay it? Those who have performed great good, whose conduct aligns with heaven’s will, draw near to its left side, where no malign qi approaches. They dare not look upon it, and their lives extend without end—such grace is beyond repayment. Yet repayment need not be in rare treasures. Simply inscribing one’s heart in sincerity, being true and steadfast in word and deed, never betraying one’s promises—this is true repayment, the repayment of understanding. Do you comprehend?\n\nTo know goodness and act accordingly, to see trustworthiness and embody it—this is the excellence of humanity. One should reflect upon this and harbor no doubt. Those who were trustworthy in the past have attained boundless longevity, transforming into divine spirits, their capacities fully realized through merit. Do you understand this as well?\n\nThus, the virtuous person, a scholar of understanding, advances upward, cherished by heaven. Without their writings, they know their fate and do not resent heaven. Each conducts themselves with care, avoiding wrongdoing and perversity. Teaching others to do good, they align with heaven’s will, and their lives naturally lengthen. All affairs proceed from the Heavenly Lord, with no room for delay.\n\nThe common people are difficult to transform; they must be guided gradually, without haste or violence. Weigh your words carefully, lest they be recorded by the spirits. Each must attend to their own duties, for the scriptures and ledgers have their own measures and limits—do not overstep them. When you see goodness, advance it; when you see evil, correct it. Harbor no doubt.\n\nThose who cherish life never forget heaven’s works. Thus, they are held in esteem, for they truly value human life. To contemplate goodness is to attain goodness, and longevity is assured. Does the Heavenly Lord cherish trustworthiness and understanding? Reflect carefully upon the divine scriptures, and do not test them of your own accord.\n\nOf all matters under heaven, filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trustworthiness are paramount. Thus, one must not indulge in recklessness, nor seize the lifespans of others, for such actions cannot endure. Be cautious, be ever cautious, and do not grow lax. Laxity breeds doubt, and doubt renders one unworthy. Do you understand? Do you understand?\n\n**Right:** *Celestial Writ of the Six Poles, Great Compendium of Heavenly Scriptures, Collated in the Eighth Heavenly Month in Accordance with the Laws of Heaven and Earth to Dispel Disasters.*\n**End of** *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Ten\n**Beginning of** *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Eleven\n\n**The Great Sage’s Petition Formula, One Hundred Eighty**\n\nOnly those of supreme sagely virtue may receive the primordial qi and naturally respond to its radiant essence, thereby becoming great sages. They fully comprehend what ought to be enacted, aligning invariably with the celestial will without straying from the intent of the primordial qi. They ever act as grand divine ministers, akin to dukes and ministers in a kingdom. Their minds grasp the directives of the great spirits, their petitions and memorials flowing in accord with celestial writ. Each petition duly recommends the worthy, ensuring that those who speak are preserved, their words heeded by the Celestial Lord. When the Hall of Luminous Clarity receives the writ, it is promptly transmitted below without delay, and the grace of the celestial court is bestowed.\n\nThe Celestial Lord declares: Those who do not discuss the court’s decrees, entrusting them to others, and whose memorials are all balanced and just, shall know no grievance or dispute. Each receives their due portion of grace, with rewards and punishments meted out accordingly. How could there be contention over such distinctions?\n\nThe great sage foresees the affairs the Celestial Lord must enact—how could there be error? The common folk, unaware, liken this to a local magistrate—how could they comprehend the edicts and writs that ought to descend? In the celestial realm, voices carry afar, and nothing remains concealed. This is governed by the natural order of mutual verification—how could there be a moment of escape?\n\nThe Celestial Lord, day and night, foreknows all matters—great and small, hidden and subtle—within the harmony of heaven, earth, and the center. How could the myriad spirits act with impunity? Thus, the records of good and evil at the beginning and end are entrusted to the spirits for transcription. The Celestial Lord personally follows the monthly cyclical governance of the Dipper’s handle, ensuring no deviation from the constant intent. All is rectified, and none dare transgress.\n\nThus it is said: The celestial mind-spirit dwells within the human abdomen, gazing afar to heaven, voices carrying between them. How could the good and evil of the people remain unknown? The Celestial Lord promotes the good and trustworthy, demoting the evil and untrustworthy. Not only in heaven is this so, but also in the harmony of earth below.\n\nPeople, failing to deeply understand future affairs, cultivate enduring resolve in their hearts, walking the same path as the great spirits—this is what heaven draws near. It is like a kingdom with loyal ministers and upright officials, never far from the ruler’s side. Yet people do not trust heaven—when would heaven ever trust those of two minds? Are those who do not serve heaven not inferior even to the common folk?\n\nEven insects and ants—by what cause or condition do they gain the favor of heaven’s intent? Those who covetously cling to life yet fail to draw near in due time—calamity arises among the people, and the thirteen [lunar mansions] are gathered in the end, each with its allotted years. When the resolute, unmindful of worldly affairs, covet advancement and seek life, the spirits reveal their hearts.\n\nThose of steadfast resolve may be engaged in discourse and entrusted with matters; those without resolve cannot. They consider only the mouths to feed, seeking profit, desiring warm clothes and full meals, with礼 and expense trailing behind. They drive the poor and weak, exalting themselves as lofty and wise—these are not the heart and mind of heaven. Their conduct lacks purity, yet they still seek the Dao and long life. This is precisely what cannot be obtained. Their transgressions are grave and weighty, with little hope of pardon.\n\nDo you understand? Those who ascend in broad daylight, seeking life, have their names inscribed in the celestial register, recorded in the inner ledger of the Northern Culmen Celestial Lord, with copies of their allotted span. How could those without resolve have their names recorded? Those who forcefully study the Dao and gain heaven’s heart and mind may fulfill their celestial years.\n\nThose who exert themselves with exceptional thought and effort, achieving merit, may have their names transferred from the register of death, gaining a lesser life. When shall they ride the refined qi and act as heaven’s agents?\n\nThus, one may know: When the writ moves the heart, tears flow in self-reproach, saying, “I, like the child of the tenth month, have acted, yet alone fail to meet the celestial intent, remaining among the ranks of the dead. What single act of mine has failed to please above? It is my own fault.”\n\nHeaven, earth, and the harmony between them all ought to follow the grace of heaven, yet many do not believe—this is a grievous transgression. What can they hope for? The celestial spirits, hearing this, say, “This person reproaches and repents, sparing no day or night, accumulating years of merit. They may be pardoned.” They report this to the Celestial Lord.\n\nThe Celestial Lord declares: “Those who reproach and repent of their transgressions shall have the spirit of life’s register transfer them to the Bureau of Longevity. The hundred and twenty spirits shall grant them continued generations, providing descendants to the poor and reducing the progeny of the short-lived among the wealthy and noble.”\n\nWhy is this? The wealthy and noble, with descendants, grow powerful and self-sufficient, unafraid of heaven and earth. They lightly harm others, extinguishing lives, amassing wealth to obstruct, killing and injuring without number. Thus, heaven does not grant them descendants. If their evil does not cease, how could they be granted goodness and longevity?\n\nDo you understand? The great spirits dispatch lesser spirits to transmit decrees, each receiving their mandate—matters of long and short span proceed without doubt. Reflect again upon the written words, knowing that even small thoughts afterward may have omissions or errors—these must be recorded.\n\n**The Virtuous Person’s Register of Fortune and Destiny, One Hundred Eighty-One**\n\nOnly those of supreme virtue possess their own principles, deeply understanding affairs yet to come, illuminating above and below, with nothing left unopened. Their thoughts never depart from within, exhausting all they know to uphold the great transformation, rightly ordering all under heaven. What they ought to transmit is never amiss.\n\nTheir sincerity reaches the four directions, their intent ever in communication. They rectify the fundamental principles, establishing the stellar lodges in their proper places, arrayed in the four quarters. Each arrangement has its pattern, each action its constancy, their destinies linked above and below, each with its short or long span.\n\nOn the day of life’s inception, the overseer awaits in the chamber, recording and inscribing the register—nothing may be forgotten. Those born in the *zi* and *wu* [hours or years] have long destinies. Those born in the *chou* and *wei* [years] do not lose their earthly abode. If their lives are brief and meager, they ought not to commit evil, lest they be consigned to the earthly abode.\n\nIf their allotted span is not yet exhausted, their names remain recorded in the ledger. Though they encounter prosperous phases and monthly cyclical qi, their lives shall not be prolonged.\n\nThus it is that those born in the earthly abodes—where the domains of *Kun* and *Gen* lie—have their lifespans naturally diminished. Born on days aligned with the seasons, the three earthly phases gaze upon one another. Yet if one is born on such a day without advancement, their worth becomes as mere coin of their own making. From year to year, they seldom encounter favorable times.\n\nIn the years of *chen* and *xu*, where Heaven’s Gate meets Earth’s Door, and where the celestial and terrestrial soils converge, all things take their origin. The celestial soil gives rise to the grasses and trees above, the terrestrial soil to those below; the celestial soil produces sages and wise ones, while the earthly soil bears the virtuous. Though there be balances and ranks, they do not interfere with one another. Yet people, unaware of this, instead declare that years in *chen* and *xu* bring destructive clashes in the monthly cyclical *qi*, deeming them most inauspicious. Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Door stand in opposition, yin and yang gaze upon each other, and birthdays align with their proper stations. When the day of *wu* once more aligns with the year’s birth, such a one is a person of great virtue, unobstructed in all things—rightly should they feel no fear. The earthly soil yields the virtuous, and the treasury of soil is their dwelling. What evil could there be? Yet people, not understanding, take soil as mere substance, all belonging to the earthly treasury.\n\nLifespans have their appointed terms: those aligned with sages become sages, those aligned with the virtuous become virtuous—this is the eternal law of Heaven, and their allotted destiny follows accordingly. Some may even attain transcendence. In the years of *yin* and *shen*, such persons resemble tigers. The sun and moon align, yet they cannot be compared. The reason lies in *yin* being the domain of literary refinement, the abode of wood, where mountain forests and fierce beasts cannot be withstood. They ought only to maintain purity and cleanliness, for Heaven sends them to hunt—but they should not be seen too often, for many fear them, and thus they are called tigers. Those born in the year of *yin* have long destinies, and if three *yin* years converge in their birth, they may endure for a great span. *Shen*, however, stands in opposition, never to be lost, yet they fear the night and can only climb trees up and down, beset by many terrors. Their destiny lies in metal, and their actions harm and wound others. Thus their lifespans are short—this is readily known. If they neglect the spirits or grow remiss, if they indulge in perverse and oppressive fears without constancy, they will seldom encounter favorable times.\n\nIn the destinies of *mao* and *you*, each aligns with its respective month, and their months coincide. *Mao* governs the East, striking the Eastern Star in its charge, fostering abundant livelihoods and the sustenance of the people. Thus *mao* is called the East, and the true *mao* stands at the East’s center. In spring, it brings flourishing blossoms; in summer, it ripens fruit—nothing it does not bestow, none it does not bless with virtue. Therefore, the Eastern Star is named *Ren* (Benevolence), for it cannot bear to harm. Heaven cherishes human lifespans, and thus grants them long years. Yet the true *you* lies in the domain of metal, delighting in strife and battle, and cannot endure long. To act wickedly is natural—how could one hope for long life? Even if they encounter the prosperous phases of the monthly cyclical *qi*, their fate remains unchanged. Of six or seven evils, half their days are lost—this, too, is readily known.\n\nFor those born in the years of *si* and *hai*, each is assigned its month, and their names are likewise given. With double yin and no yang, their lifespans are naturally short. When the three yin phases converge, it is said that *si* and *hai* govern the opening and storing away. *Hai* rules the Northwest, *si* the Southeast—whatever they face or undertake, little aligns with propriety. Their livelihoods are difficult to advance, and their lifespans hard to prolong. Thus it is said that the ten celestial stems circulate in mutual correspondence, their names denoting merit, and their reckoning subject to Heaven’s calculations. By measuring their short and long spans, destiny is determined—how could one follow their own will in Heaven’s workings? Therefore, those of great virtue now oversee these patterns, their names recorded in the registers of the stellar lodges, their destinies held in the celestial bureaus. Within and without, above and below, in all eight directions, all follow these principles—how could one act as they please?\n\nPeople, not grasping these calculations, instead ask what debt they owe to Heaven. By doing good, one may fulfill their allotted years; by doing evil, they forfeit length for brevity. If wickedness is not halted, calamity extends even to the unborn—what hope can there be? One reaps what one sows. If their destiny is meager and they do not exhaust their allotted span, their surplus is stored in Heaven to be bestowed upon the virtuous. They ought to warn their descendants to be cautious. If they repent and correct their ways, they may yet complete their years—each outcome is clear. Let them tally their deeds and not resent the celestial spirits.\n\nStrive to do good, and your descendants shall enjoy long years; otherwise, the fault lies with you—blame not Heaven. If one first rectifies themselves but later wavers, they should reflect and restore balance. The noble and benevolent naturally cherish their years, as recorded in the *Life Bureau’s Verdicts*, Scroll One Hundred Eighty-Two.\n\nOnly the Most High’s virtuous ones conduct themselves thus: they foreknow the inner and outer workings of Heaven and Earth, moving in and out of yin and yang, guiding their principles, and awakening to the thoughts within—never forgetting the Dao. They act in accord with Heaven, daring not to doubt, and thus succeed, upholding Heaven’s great bestowals. Their thoughts dwell within, their actions bear no transgressions, subtly receiving the natural order. They repeatedly encounter warnings—past and future are known. If people bring harm upon themselves, they have no one to blame.\n\nSince ancient times, few have been trustworthy. Those who claim trustworthiness seek only to deceive, heedless of the consequences. Thus Heaven and Earth grow dark with unceasing wrath, and even the wise and sagely, though they know, can only regret. Heaven instructs through its own ways, not through human words. Yet people turn away with malice, ignoring admonitions, seeking only their own satisfaction. Such people are more ignorant than beasts. For this reason, they ought to reproach themselves for their faults—from where does their recklessness arise? Day and night, they should reflect on their failings, relentlessly examining their transgressions—what cause have they to resent or blame? Yet they remain unrepentant, heedless of their faults, acting recklessly and inappropriately. They do not heed the great teachings but instead indulge themselves, shortening their own lives—what cause have they to resent or blame?\n\nAt times, they recall the transcendent ones of high antiquity who ascended and escaped the world—how did such thoughts arise? In all the writings they see, it is said: be loyal and filial, honor and serve your parents, live in harmony with your siblings, without inner or outer discord, in unity above and below, knowing Heaven’s prohibitions. Let the spirits govern the principles, openly acknowledging faults without ceasing, cultivating the self and reflecting inward—only then may one attain life. Lifespans have their appointed terms—how can one act as they please? The thought pains the heart, tears soak the garments, and there is no end to the sorrow. They cherish their years, fearing they may not live long. When they see those of long life and inquire of them, they are told: be loyal and filial, never losing the intent of Heaven and Earth; assist the four seasons in their generation, aid the Five Phases in their completion, and dare not destroy the things that ought to live.\n\nThose who do good never encroach upon others, deceive, or betray; they are sincere and trustworthy, never daring to break their word. Their conduct wins the favor of the multitude, and they dare not fail their kin or bring harm to their village, always repaying what they owe in due time. They never lie drunk in the streets in broad daylight. The worthy and wise follow them, paying no heed to fools. They bear gratitude toward Heaven and Earth, never expecting repayment, only reproaching themselves. Yet when faults recur, they trace their origins to inherited burdens, reproaching themselves for years on end until moved to remorse.\n\nWorldly folk commit many transgressions and debts, never finding release. They walk in sorrow and bitterness, not knowing where to turn. Whenever they see others at fault, they turn to blame themselves, unable to find peace. They seek out virtuous texts and precepts, hoping for good fortune, and when they encounter the sacred scriptures of Heaven’s great spirits, they ponder them again and again, their thoughts consumed without end. They bow their heads, strike their breasts, and weep aloud, their bodies unable to correct themselves, yet full of grievance. The weight of the prohibitions presses upon them, and they transgress, shortening their lives. Day and night, they repent.\n\nHoping for even a brief reprieve, they dare not commit further wrongs. Instead, they resolve to practice kindness and bestow alms, striving to grasp the principles. No harsh words pass their lips—only tears, their hearts filled with sorrow. The heavenly spirits hear and descend to ask: “Who is this person, so full of grief?” They observe one of great virtue, whose life is long and enduring. When asked, they say: “This one merely acts in accord with Heaven’s heart and Earth’s intent—thus they attain longevity.”\n\nReturning to their quiet dwelling, they reflect as the virtuous of the Highest Dao have taught, examining themselves. When the spirits see their remorse and repentance, they ascend to report to the Way of Heaven: “There is one who weeps and laments without ceasing, fearing they will not live, and so reproaches themselves.” The great spirits hear and say: “The Heavenly Lord has often commanded the spirits: those who perform good deeds, are loyal and filial, and obedient—such words refer to this person alone.” They then report to the Heavenly Lord, who says: “I have heard that this person has reproached themselves for their faults for many years. Though once a worldly person, their unceasing self-reproach has made them one of the highest good.”\n\nThe great spirits frequently visit to observe their conduct, discerning whether their intentions are virtuous and if they seek advancement. Their destined years are then recorded in the Bureau of Longevity, where their deeds are reviewed to make up for any deficiencies. The great spirits say: “This person has reproached themselves for so long that their inherited burdens are dissolved. We request that their deficiencies be filled, and they be named a virtuous one of the Highest Dao, to repay those below who have fallen short.” The Heavenly Lord says: “The conduct of the virtuous of the Highest Dao must be as you have said.” The great spirits repeatedly command that they be protected and guided to ascend as spirits, ensuring their allotted years are not diminished.\n\nThe great spirits say: “This person was originally without a recorded name, but by decree, they have been placed in the Bureau of Longevity. We request that their deficiencies be filled in order, without skipping ranks.” The Heavenly Lord says: “When the day comes to fill the vacancies in order, their names shall be repeatedly submitted without missing the appointed time.” The great spirits assent.\n\nOnly the benevolent of the Highest Dao accumulate merit and deeds in Heaven. Heaven heeds and trusts them, sending them to assist the Eastern Star in arranging the creatures that ought to live, providing blossoms and fruits to nourish the people, ensuring warmth and fullness. Their bodies grow strong, nurturing one another in turn; yin and yang unite, and male and female take form. Old and young follow in succession, receiving their destined lifespans from Heaven’s decree. Among the twenty-eight constellations, they revolve and complete one another; the sun and moon illuminate and inspect without fail, taking turns to generate life—how could there be rest?\n\nYet people do not understand, believing each to be self-governing. Though names may imply autonomy, they are in fact mutually restrained. The reason is this: human lives have varying lengths, and the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer bring constant cycles of life and death. Thus, they are made to govern one another, transferring and inquiring in turn. Lifespans increase or decrease, passing from one to another. Therefore, it is said that the four seasons, Five Phases, sun, moon, and stars all hold sway over life. The good are granted increase, while the wicked retreat on their own. The severity of transgressions is measured by unchanging laws—how can one escape if the laws are followed as they should be?\n\nHeaven above and Earth below support one another like the outer and inner, with various spirits also working in concert. Thus, it is said that the Heavenly Lord commands the bureaus, each transferring their duties in turn, taking up their respective talismans without the slightest partiality. From above, they observe below—how could there be failure? Those of inherent nature, free from ill intent, may commit minor wrongs but repent of their deeds, and their faults are dissolved. Their records are regularly entered into the registers: the wicked are sent to the lower bureaus, while the good are reported as good, and the wicked as wicked. The spirits of fortune and misfortune each follow where they are assigned. If the wicked repent, their names are transferred to the registers of the good. If the good turn to evil, they are moved to the registers of the wicked—how could there be rest?\n\nAmong the living on Earth, even those still in the womb have their names and destinies recorded in the Register of the Undying. When their years are fulfilled and their conduct complete, those who are born are recorded, and those with guarantors are elevated. The reason is this: their lifespans are difficult to sustain, so their guarantors are held accountable for any transgressions. Thus, those who are neither loyal, filial, obedient, nor meritorious have no guarantors—they merely continue the merits of their ancestors, ensuring sacrifices are made. Yet if they persist in evil without cease, how can they expect to partake in future generations’ sustenance?\n\nHow could those who feed on filth ever hope to serve alongside the great spirits of Heaven for long? Even among the filth, there are those who respond to Heaven’s scriptures and are sent divine teachings. When the appointed time arrives, the Heavenly Lord commands the guardian spirits of the Great Heavenly Granary to sever their attachment to material forms. They are nourished by the qi of the Great Heavenly Granary, their bodies refined and their spirits lightened, moving between the profound and the obscure. Their names are then recorded, no longer in the ledgers—how could they seek life? How could people know of this?\n\nIf one is good and never loses Heaven’s heart, the great spirits stir their mind, making them delight in life, whether they follow the Dao or remain worldly. The reason is this: if one commits evil without a single good deed, merely coveting fine clothes and carriages, following their desires without restraint, their allotted lifespan will not be fulfilled—but Heaven and Earth will not deny their wishes either.\n\nThe wicked shall not long behold the sun, moon, and stars of Heaven, but must return to the eternal night—how could they remain? Such persons, unable to discipline themselves toward goodness, are known to Heaven for their enduring evil, and thus are made to consume only the food of form. They are buried beneath the earth, becoming servants to the earth spirits, never to be reborn. This is why the scriptures reveal it, that they may know.\n\nSome undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation), their forms dividing: the bones and body separate. The corpse remains in one place, while the spirit becomes a wandering phantom, appearing to people as though dead. Yet those who understand may see them still alive—these are the *shijie* immortals. Over time, as their years and merits accumulate, they next ascend in broad daylight to Heaven. When their merits and years are complete, their radiance shines forth, aiding the celestial spirits in their all-pervading work. They return to dwell among the clouds, and within their appointed domains, all are *shijie* immortals who govern the affairs of humans and ghosts.\n\nIn the families of the Dao, those who depart may be enfeoffed as the most revered of spirits, known as *Dilingqi* (Earthly Numinous Spirits). They, too, may wear the purple, mugwort-green, and yellow. Their governance extends above and below, with each ascending to their proper station. If one’s evil is heard of, they may be demoted to consort with ghosts—do you not understand? Thus it is said: the paths of life and death diverge; how could they be compared?\n\nProceed, and when minor transgressions arise, still the mind and reflect. For those who later falter or fall short, this shall be explained. Only the actions of the Most High’s good persons manifest the affairs Heaven and Earth must carry out. Each has their charge, each their words, each their cultivation, each their spiritual attainment, each their merit, each their loyalty, each their governance, each their bestowal upon others, each their advancement in the Dao. Each gains the trust of Heaven and Earth, each does not lose the generative and transformative cycles of the four seasons and five phases.\n\nThus, those who respond to the goodness of the Most High are Heaven’s faithful and Earth’s safeguarded. All attain the harmonious heart-mind of Heaven and Earth, understanding the ebb and flow of human affairs, carrying out commands without daring to defy the will of the Great Sages. Below, they do not transgress the prohibitions of the myriad spirits. They constantly strive to perfect others, making them delight in goodness. They align with the hearts of Heaven and Earth, their inner and outer selves in accord, achieving success in their persons and attaining longevity. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of the undying, and they serve alongside the great spirits in their appointed roles.\n\nThey discern right from wrong, their loyalty and sincerity directed to Heaven. They behold the sun, moon, and stars without losing the measure of the Dao, nor straying from their resolve. Constantly desiring to live, they contemplate serving Heaven’s transformation and understanding Earth’s principles. Their hearts rejoice, for they know the registers of fortune and misfortune, the affairs of survival and demise, and aspire to walk the same path as the natural order. Even slight greed or evil is seen, and the great spirits’ admonitions stir compassion for the unenlightened, illuminating their shortcomings so they may enter the records of long life. They witness the Celestial Lords bestowing life upon them, their names enduring in the ledgers of the undying.\n\nThey perform the affairs of Heaven above and comprehend Earth’s principles below. What they see and hear is vast: their eyes are bright, their ears keen, and they know the boundless past and future. Their writings and words are clear, and they grasp the essential and wondrous. Such is the aspiration of the Most High’s good persons. Only the great celestial spirits perceive and guide their wishes, as they yearn for the natural and inscribe their deeds in harmony with the generative *qi*, without end.\n\nIt is ever said: Heaven does not deny a person’s wishes, nor does Earth deny their peace. Thus, the natural order dares not bear even a hair’s weight of entanglement to trouble the spirits, so deeply do they cherish the written word. Day and night, they reflect on their failings, fearing they may fall short of the Most High Lord’s intent. What do they惜 or love that they would not exhaust their loyalty, sincerity, and filial piety? They must declare the grace they have received, the honor bestowed, without thought of repayment. Heaven’s heart holds them in profound love, yet they reproach themselves for their faults, offering little in forgiveness.\n\nOnly the great spirits may pardon and admonish them, not out of attachment but from compassion. They dare not distance themselves, constantly mindful of the unrepayed grace, their sins clinging to them. Fearful of being unable to explain or absolve, they can only grieve. Though pardoned and shown leniency, they are made to reflect on their failings.\n\nThe great spirits say: The Most High’s good persons reflect on their transgressions and reproach themselves; their words and writings ascend to be heard above. Their words extend far, yet they fear being misunderstood. Heaven’s faithfulness especially honors them, and they may attain boundless longevity. They should set their hearts afar, never forgetting the great gifts bestowed by Heaven’s generative power.\n\nThe Most High Lord praises them, saying: Life arises from the mandate of good life, unconcerned with wealth or sensuality. Seeing others live, they constantly desire to share in their longevity—when would they act recklessly or without heart, failing to repay such profound grace? They only regret that, since their years began, they have not seen the great measure of Heaven’s bounty. Only by receiving the grace of teachings and admonitions do they understand their allotted principles. They say: Knowing fate, they do not resent Heaven, nor dare they resent themselves and hinder life. How could their hearts harbor greed? They only fear their years may end before witnessing Heaven’s great dispensation of its ordered domains.\n\nThe Most High again admonishes the ignorant and benighted, granting them the wisdom to reflect—a great grace beyond words. They must concentrate their hearts and minds, ever mindful within, never forgetting their hunger and thirst, seeking the precepts and the living. Only by receiving pardon and leniency may they proceed.\n\nThe great spirits say: We originally advanced to the Celestial Lords from among the spirits, without the slightest fault, aiding Heaven and Earth with meritorious deeds. Our names are recorded in the Celestial Lords’ ledgers—when could we ever be forgotten? We humbly present our words of self-reproach, for we have long yearned for Heaven’s transformation. Are such persons recorded in the ledgers or not?\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Those who reproach themselves act in accord with the natural order and are aided by the spirits. Let those who oversee the celestial registers examine them. If they have reproached themselves, the spirit in charge of the living ledgers is commanded to review the records, and their names are indeed found therein.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Those who conduct themselves well from birth, transgressing no prohibitions, achieve this through their own actions. The great spirits should further investigate, for there may be omissions in the records of those who have rendered service.\n\nThe great spirits say: Since the Great Beginning, those spirits whose merits have gained Heaven’s favor have advanced—yet there remain some vacancies.\n\nIf there are persons whose conduct merits it, their names should be duly recorded above.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: The duties of your offices are many and onerous. Calculate their merits and offset their transgressions, ensuring they no longer violate what has been decreed.\n\nThe great spirits say: These most exalted persons naturally follow the correct path, and their faults and burdens are few.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Reconsider them. If any remain uncommended, hold their guarantors accountable to fill the vacancies.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Matters of this court must not be treated carelessly.\n\nThe great spirits say: As your decree states, before a hundred days have passed, the spirits of Heaven will vie to vouch for them, and we great spirits shall report our judgment.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Let each be assigned to their fitting role, sent to attend to their duties, and thus gain further esteem. Those who are trustworthy shall be appointed as Perfected.\n\nThe great spirits say: Let us dispatch envoys to summon them above, first transforming their appearance.\n\nThe spirit-envoys go forth, and their transformations shine with abundant radiance.\n\nThe great spirits say: Report back.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: The person has already transformed into a spirit and now stands outside the gate, not yet having entered.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Let them proceed to the office of the overseer to pay their respects.\n\nThe great spirits say: We shall report as the great spirits have stated.\n\nYes, yes. Let the report be made as stated, and we shall observe their conduct accordingly.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: It shall be as the great spirits have reported.\n\n**Dialogue on the Longing of the Knowing to Meet the Great Spirits, One Hundred Eighty-Third**\n\nOnly those of supreme knowledge, the Knowing Ones of the Most High, foreknow the affairs of Heaven and understand what should be done and what should be upheld. Their actions arise naturally, and when primal qi converges upon them, they attain maturity—all becomes clear and known. They transform their hearts to accord with the natural, residing in what they do. Thus, the Knowing Ones comprehend both inner and outer, and in all their comings and goings, nothing fails to reach fulfillment. Nothing remains unachieved, and all transformations occur in due time. Revering the majesty of the spirits, they perfect their merit and name their virtue. Ever unwavering in loyalty and trust, never remiss, day and night they grieve and tremble, never departing from their inner resolve. Inclining and yearning, they long to achieve union and meet the great spirits. Through discourse and the exchange of words, they practice the Way they follow and advance what they know. Constantly contemplating success, they render grace to the spirits, prolonging life and increasing years. Thus, the Knowing Ones look inward to see outward—what is there they do not know? What is there they do not perceive? Their minds are clear and their thoughts distinct. They but crave the Way of long life, desiring to mount the carriage and serve as envoys for the great spirits. Wherever they arrive, they dare not speak falsely, responding in the moment as if already present, longing for their hearts to open. Receiving the words of the spirits as the spirits themselves do, knowing the spirits’ actions, they act with self-assurance and only then dare to speak, seeking merely to be granted life and audience. They dare not seek high office, only to be shown mercy. Though they witness matters of life and death, their hearts tremble with fear. Having received the great teachings, they must act to communicate them, bestowing grace and spreading kindness, benefiting those above and those below. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers, and they abide in the ranks of the undying. Their hearts rejoice and delight, exhausting their efforts in service to the Celestial Lord. Over the years, their merits accumulate, and they advance in speech.\n\nOnly by the great spirits’ intercession for their insufficiencies, knowing the weight of their words, do they thus crave advancement. Receiving their secret decrees, they roam the gates and chambers, daring not rest, desiring instruction and admonition to remedy their shortcomings. They wish to be examined and not contradict what is said, awaiting the commands and warnings of the great spirits’ words.\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High perceive much, yet they cannot fully know the bounds of Heaven’s domains—what then should they be cautioned against? The spirits of Heaven all observe them. The words of the Knowing Ones of the Most High are but to know what is spoken, what is taught, and what is practiced—what cause for doubt is there?\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Constantly command the spirits to advance the names of those who are loyal, filial, sincere, trustworthy, and meritorious. These Knowing Ones of the Most High, coveted by their allotted destinies, thus clarify their hearts.\n\nYet they fear that their written words are but their own speech—why would they withhold reverence for Heaven’s teachings and admonitions? They often say they suffer from having no scribe to respond, fearing that inner and outer may not correspond. If they wish to advance their knowledge and understanding, broadening inquiry and deepening comprehension, this too is what they should know.\n\nProceed, and heed the words of the great spirits. Heaven’s heavy admonitions must not be treated lightly, must not be disrespected, must not be held in awe too little—only then is it possible. The admonitions are many; one must grasp their essentials and further open one’s ears, eyes, and heart.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, emerging from within, the great admonitions of Heaven decree that all who seek advancement and long life must advance what they know. To know and not speak is to listen in vain—this is to lack the heart for self-advancement. Those whose hearts hold knowledge must contemplate advancement. Those with aspirations must advance their aspirations. Those with sincerity must advance their sincerity. Those with filial piety must advance their filial piety. Only thus do they become the heart and core of Heaven—nothing must be left unadvanced.\n\nThe Celestial Lord foreknows human sentiments and permits no failure to advance or to expound the Way. To conceal knowledge and hide abilities—Heaven detests such persons, ensuring they do not appear in the ledgers of longevity. Is this not to know?\n\nNot only do they not appear in the ledgers of longevity, but their essence is first lost, departing from their bodies, and their years perish. Can they not be cautious?\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High act thus because the Celestial Lord knows what is known and what is not. They know themselves—what doubt remains? They need only carefully ponder the spirits’ words and not betray them.\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High, though lowly and ignorant, press forward with questions beyond their reach, desiring to be granted what they do not know. How dare they conceal knowledge or hide abilities, causing the Celestial Lord and the spirits to hear of it and further forfeit their lives and lose their years, shortening their longevity? This is the root of calamity and misfortune, and even the destruction of their bodies would not suffice to repay it. How dare they advance thus?\n\nOnly may the great spirits illuminate and pardon their inadequacies.\n\nThe great spirits say: Those who seek life and abhor death naturally possess hearts and aspirations that cannot be otherwise. Yet they fear there may be times of confusion.\n\nThe one seeking life says: \"I myself know not the precepts, yet by the great spirits’ gracious forbearance, I am taught thus. How dare I grow complacent and not advance what I know and what I can say? May only the great spirits record what has come before and not dismiss it.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"What has come before is not easily matched. Only those who preserve trust and faith can align with the Celestial Lord’s will and thus hope for life. Take heed of this.\"\n\nThe seeker, truly coveting life, therefore exhausts his loyalty and sincerity, never daring to slacken or rest. He reflects on his faults and reproaches himself—how dare he waste day or night? The Celestial Lord, having heard his words, says: \"This is the speech of one who possesses knowledge in the Most High.\" It is known that this person’s name appears in the ledgers, though with some deficiencies. The spirits charged with the living registers are commanded to examine the ledgers where this person’s name is recorded. Though his name is listed and he is naturally good and knowledgeable, he must fulfill his years and not lose track of the spirits governing his months and years.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Method for Accumulating Conduct to Repair the True Self, Scroll 184**\n\nOnly those of the Most High who possess intention each know their allotted portion. Each has their own Dao, their own conduct, their own offerings, their own advancement, their own declarations, their own words, their own destinations, and their own movements. If the heart is not stirred within, they constantly strive to fulfill loyalty, trust, and filial piety. Truly, they render service to Heaven, accumulating conduct over the years without ever slackening. Yet they do not forget gratitude or their allotted portion, ever mindful of their desire for life. Having received the protection of the host of spirits above, they dare not withhold even the smallest part. They constantly harbor a fearful heart, never at ease, seeking the precepts of the Most High to preserve their lives. How dare they forget the great bestowal of grace?\n\nMay the great spirits deign to glance upon their inadequacies. Their hearts ever long for the affairs of the Most High, and what they ought to practice—compass and square, plumb line and inked cord—naturally earns trust. Gazing toward the four quarters, they comprehend the four corners. What Heaven knows, they manifest before it comes to pass. Their hearts contemplate the great spirits’ memorials and communications, what they advance and what they declare. They dare not evaluate these with their own minds but constantly consult with the assembled spirits to determine what may be adopted or not, ever fearful of failing to win the hearts of the spirits.\n\nThey consider themselves fundamentally upright, without error. As if moved from the depths of their being, they constantly cherish the preservation of life that harms nothing. Previously, they coveted its radiance, reaching upward to the sound without essence or form, penetrating the Most High’s commands to advance. They dare not grow lax and thereby obstruct the great transformation.\n\nMay the spirits examine their desire for life and not depart from the great spirits’ left side. Upon seeing the precepts, their hearts open and their eyes brighten, desiring to abide by the scripture of longevity, to increase their years and lifespan. They strive to advance merit, personally engaging without daring to trust themselves or presume to judge right and wrong, contending over what is insufficient. They yearn for those above to be ever diligent, only beseeching compassionate illumination of the precepts.\n\nWhen will their gratitude and devotion ever cease? Their hearts long day and night to meet, coveting knowledge of prohibitions and transgressions to stir their minds and thereby perceive their own inadequacies. These are not matters to be repaid with mere words; only by receiving examination may their thoughts pierce the heart’s diaphragm.\n\nThe great spirits say: \"This is one of the Most High who possesses intention—his conduct is indeed fitting. Seeking to receive Heaven’s solemn precepts and prohibitions, he who possesses knowledge is fundamentally clear and discerning, distinguishing principle. What precepts does he not understand? Holding the heart to aim at the heart, there is no gap for selfishness. From above to below, all know their own master.\n\nNow, those of the Most High who possess intention are close to Heaven and trusted by the celestial spirits. They need only hold fast to their hearts and minds, ever fearful of losing them. The rest is known to their own hearts. They must strive to transmit, widely inquire, and not lose what is said. Those who possess knowledge are mostly clear in their distinctions, only fearing that at times their actions may not match their words. Why suspect they would not openly explain? Such a person, possessing intention, naturally reflects on his faults and debts.\n\nSimply contemplating what lies before and behind, longevity naturally emerges from within, aligning with the Celestial Lord’s heart. The remainder of the precepts for those who possess intention say: This seeker was originally a rustic, seeing those who lived long and aged gracefully, their vital essence and fluids flowing without loss, never witnessing their decline. Though many study, few attain it. Why? Because they do not hold their hearts with utmost care, lightly regarding what is said. Their strategies and records are not fitting, thus making attainment rare.\n\nNow, this seeker, seeing the conduct of those who came before, further corrects and reforms his bearing, opening his heart to retain it. Desiring to raise his voice, he listens well, coveting longevity and cherishing his years. Thus, he dare not slacken or rest. May only the great spirits examine his inadequacies.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"Those who possess intention shall be granted registration in the ledgers. We request the clerks of the registers to examine the ledgers for this person’s name and report to the Celestial Lord. The great spirits may not act on their own.\"\n\nThe seeker says: \"May only the great spirits consider and discuss this. I dare not distance myself, lingering outside, but will personally prove my worth.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"We request to report the names of those registered in the ledgers. Why suspect they would not correspond?\"\n\nThe seeker says: \"May only the great spirits report on my behalf. On the day of accomplishment, I will devote my life to proving my worth. What need is there to hope for repayment?\"\n\nThe great spirits report to the Celestial Lord: \"Those of the Most High who possess intention all hold their hearts firmly and closely, their aspirations ever coveting the heights and possessing faith. Command the spirits in charge to examine them. If such a person exists, advance and report to the great spirits. Command those in charge to examine whether this person’s name appears in the documents. This person’s name was recorded before his birth.\"\n\nThe great spirits report back: \"This person’s name was recorded before his birth, solely by the grace of the Most High.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"Those recorded in the ledgers shall be seen to ascend. They must take responsibility for their debts and burdens. Command the great spirits to remove the tally of their debts and burdens, to transform their hearts, and to refine them into spirits. When their years are fulfilled, they shall advance.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"This person’s years and calculations are complete, exceeding the term by a hundred days. Previously, there was no certainty, so for now, it is halted.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"Command the great spirits to ascend for now, assigning them to their posts in the interim. Where there are vacancies for the true, let them be filled by those who can exhaust their essence and devote their will, knowing how to eliminate and act concurrently.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"We request to ascend as the Celestial Lord has commanded. Let their refined lifespans and calculations be recalculated. Those who are enlightened shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"This is what those of sincere heart ought to do, that they may have something to govern.\"\n\nThe great spirits assent.\n\nThey request to command the proper officials to carry out the affairs according to the original text.\n\nThe great spirits say: \"Report to the Ascension Bureau.\"\n\nThe petitioners report to the great spirits, saying: \"Request to command the officials of the Bureau.\"\n\nThe officials having reported, they are assigned to interim posts, and where there are vacancies for the true, they are to be filled.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"As reported by the Bureau.\"\n\nTo the right: In heaven above, good deeds are to be concealed, while misfortune and calamity arise from their disclosure.\n\n*End of Scroll One Hundred Eleven of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll One Hundred Twelve of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Disaster of Coveting Wealth and Lust, and Admonitions Within the Womb, One Hundred Eighty-Five*\n\nIn ancient times, the formless divine persons sought the Dao of life. They aligned their aspirations with the qi of the Primordial, constantly yearning for the longevity of long life, ever mindful not to lose the intent of the Primordial qi. At dusk they settled their thoughts, at dawn they inquired after its well-being, clinging tenaciously to life, never forgetting. From time to time, they would look about, exhausting the utmost of their loyalty and sincerity, reverently following the wishes of the Primordial qi. Thus, they were enabled to ascend and move with clarity, their radiance illuminating the four directions, perceiving things unseen, and hearing sounds unheard, their comings and goings above and below all governed by principle. The host of spirits and refined qi would come of their own accord, attending to their countenance, fearful of displeasing them or losing their favor. All held reverent hearts, their garments and footwear transforming accordingly. They embraced and bestowed kindness, spreading virtue above and below, their fame flowing to the four directions, the six poles, and beyond the eight extremities, extending even to the ancient sages, each receiving the consequences of their good and evil, their generosity and meanness. Covered by boundless grace, they reverently followed the mandate, moving even the stars and constellations. With limitless resources and limitless virtue, they selected the steadfast and good to shield and conceal themselves. Their wishes fulfilled, their hearts at ease and joyful, they attained lives of immeasurable longevity. Serene and content, with little need for embellishment, they preserved themselves whole, never slackening. Others could not know them, nor could they hear of others—without rank or merit, how could they ascend to stand alongside the Primordial qi? Thus, they cherished, loved, and nurtured themselves, and in their abundant generosity, they bestowed without omission. How could they fail to receive blessings?\n\nYet they reflected: their comings and goings were within the harmony of heaven and earth, their illumination reaching the sun, moon, and stars. They drew clarity from the twenty-eight constellations ahead, carefully observing the cyclical signs governing the people, the patterns of good and ill fortune. But few understood. They considered themselves wise, yet in their actions and movements, they brought no benefit to heaven. Violating prohibitions, they invited calamity, even to the point of annihilating their families, severing their lineages, leaving their ancestors without worship. How could their lives remain whole? What could be done for such people? Failing to follow the ancient texts, they believed themselves free of offense against spirits and gods. Yet the three qi were not in harmony, and their fates varied in depth and shallowness. Unable to deeply contemplate misfortune, the gods of the three qi were sent to admonish them. Those who heeded the admonition prospered; those who did not sealed their own fate, descending below the earth, their misfortune flowing to their descendants. Heaven’s mandate was not obeyed; evil was practiced and good abandoned. How could they endure? What the August Emperor did not wish to see was their hastened demise. Yet people, unaware, blamed the azure heavens. When did heaven ever wrong them? They brought it upon themselves. Utterly lacking in foresight, their lives were like those of dogs and sheep—how could they long endure? Like birds in a net, they entangled themselves in its mesh, their greed consuming their bodies. Their peers followed blindly, heedless of their years. Only the wise emerged into the unharmed lands beyond the four borders—how did they alone escape? It was simply the natural course of their fate. Though dwelling among the unenlightened, their lives remained whole, for such was the decree of the times. Few repaid their blessings. Alas, what could be done? They asked, \"What have we done to wrong heaven?\"\n\nAmong the ancients, not one in ten thousand matched their aspirations. Coveting wealth and lust, they disregarded the perils, bringing disaster even within the womb, never beholding the sun, moon, or stars. What sorrow could compare? They left themselves incomplete, their fates bound to the earth. Wretched were these people, and there were many like them—even plants, trees, birds, and beasts fared no differently. They did not strive to correct themselves or rectify their intentions, uttering reckless and evil words. Above, the spirits recorded their deeds; below, there was no escape. Nothing was hidden from their overseers. Each must exert themselves to seek the admonitions of the divine spirits, the convergence of good and ill fortune—how could there be no reckoning?\n\nThus, the divine persons were commanded to establish prohibitions for the people, enabling them to perceive the taboos of life and death. Those upon whom yang qi bestows favor are recorded in the ledgers of true transcendents; those with transgressions are demoted. Those upon whom yin qi bestows favor are relegated to the ranks of the dead. Reflect deeply and consider carefully, lest you transgress the heavenly principles and the patterns of the earth. Understand human nature, the inner and outer, when to advance and when to retreat. Do not bring blame upon others, that each may extend their years and pass them on to their descendants.\n\nAfter receiving the admonitions, be doubly cautious in speech. Evil committed below is disregarded above. The people of the vulgar world lack filial piety and loyalty, coveting what they desire, seizing and plundering what is not theirs. Their murderous intent never leaves their lips—how could they hope to live? Calamity and blame await them, sooner or later. Reverently follow the celestial patterns, for the divine spirits record all. Keep your distance from such things; do not test them. To test life is to gain life; to test death is to gain death. When death is certain, there is no doubt. Thus, I reiterate and repeat: do not associate with the ignorant, nor utter even slight deviations.\n\nThe Dao of long life lies near, in the three spirits. The three qi combine to form a person; if they fail to combine, they scatter and become earth, no different from tiles and stones, broken and unseen, unable to compare with the whole and complete. The spirits of the three fates reside near the heart. Why cling to or cherish what is flawed? To covet a broken form is to be displayed in the marketplace—when will it ever live again?\n\nParents grieve in sorrow, wives and children suffer affliction; distant kin rejoice in their misfortune, neighbors regret their belatedness—death flows on to later generations. Yet one who can rectify oneself and do good may thereby regain longevity. Sincerity reaches all things, and nature follows its course. Be vigilant within and without, between yin and yang, through the four seasons of growth and completion—do not violate them. Between heaven above and earth below, within the harmony of the center, all have their own masters. For those with understanding, this is the method by which the enlightened act. Those who aspire to life share the same wish as the Dao of Heaven; the wicked perish before their time—can one not be cautious?\n\nThe words of divine beings all receive celestial response; one cannot blame oneself. The term of extended life reaches upward to those who do good, allowing them to fulfill their natural span. The wicked descend into the Yellow Springs. Ponder this, ponder it well—do not recklessly transmit it. Those who are wicked, upon receiving this transmission, will suffer its calamities. Death and life place them in separate realms; none dare speak of it. If one acts wickedly, one must not blame others—there are always those who record such deeds, leaving no room for complaint.\n\nStudy the texts to grasp their meaning. Be reverent and cautious with sacred scriptures. Spirits and spectral agents all have their causes. If a destined household encounters this text, be careful not to harm oneself or deceive the virtuous. Heaven diminishes a person’s lifespan, bringing illness and disease—there is no need to seek help from physicians or tormented shamans. The registers are already set to sever it—what further doubt remains? Reflect deeply, contemplate, and consider—thus may one avoid calamity. Once misfortune strikes, there is no salvation.\n\nThe Perfected One holds this text to enlighten the ignorant, that they may reform and do good. Do not malign the words of the scripture. What has been said before is reiterated here. The reason is this: life and death alter destiny. Without speaking of its prohibitions, there is no way to preserve it. The natural order is self-evident—one must only know what is true. If the heart delights in these words, one should understand their meaning. Thus, holding to the One allows the body to fulfill its natural span. Holding to the One and reflecting on transgressions may yet extend one’s term.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven encompasses countless millions, yet few attain its truth. The *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* have been abandoned by many. The reason is this: lacking faith in their texts, few achieve transcendence and instead become common folk. Now, therefore, through the masters of the Three Divine Beings, those whose hearts are moved may be inspired. Divine spirits attach to people, unwilling to let earthly qi summon them. Examine and ponder its meaning carefully—do not doubt this text. The masters of the divine beings, having received Heaven’s teachings, thus transmit it to those who comprehend the scriptures.\n\n**Admonition of the Seventy-Two Kinds of Corpse Caution (186)**\n\nHeaven has its four corners, earth has its four corners—thus the sun and moon pass and push one another. The stars have their degrees and measures, illuminating right and wrong. People have nobility and baseness; lifespans have length and brevity, each receiving their fate from the Six Jia. Birth comes early or late; emolument matches its due. Good and evil reside in separate places, not losing even a fraction. Common folk, not knowing this, claim there is no truth. Only when spirit and numen harmonize can one be called human. Only when the spirit and numen reside in the heart can one become a lord of men.\n\nTimely responses are apportioned to their respective domains. Those who receive Heaven’s response are raised by celestial spirits. Those who receive Earth’s response are nurtured by earthly spirits. Those who receive the response of the Center are protected by human and spectral beings. Good responses follow good; good naturally elevates itself. Evil responses follow evil; evil naturally follows. All have their roots, circulating above and below. The waters of mountains and seas, each with their own boundaries, each desire those of good nature who do not oppose them as their household people. The spirits of the land likewise desire the virtuous. Each imposes its prohibitions, communicating upward to Heaven. Those who violate them bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nIn households of great wickedness, none—young or old—escape the hatred of spirits and gods. One can only rectify oneself; do not slander the divine. The Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Man—prohibitions do not favor the empty virtuous. Even the essence of spirit and qi can lend power to humans. The wicked do not escape their records; their deeds are promptly reported above. When transgressions accumulate, the Great Yin presides over the case, applying the law according to its weight. All are recorded in the ledgers of wrongdoing. People, unaware, assume there is no consequence\n\nThose of exceptional ability who reverence and cherish the Dao, virtue, humaneness, and kindness align their power with Heaven and harmonize their intent with Earth. They benefit the central harmony, contemplating encounters with good spirits and gods, each holding to their faith—do not deceive the ignorant. Seeking long life and survival, one need not torment oneself with sorrow and poison. Contemplate and practice the affairs of Heaven above, and the spirits will elevate you, granting transcendence and enduring life, ever gazing upon the sun, moon, and stars. This is the great kindness of Heaven; one should avoid even minor misdeeds, for they too will be sent down. If evil persists unceasingly, households will be extinguished for generations—thus this admonition is reiterated. Those who commit no transgressions are spared, while offenders are deemed ill-fated youths. When one desires wrongdoing, explain and dispel their ignorance to avert misfortune. Often, one disregards others’ words only to regret it later—the speaker’s blessing is in the warning.\n\nThe stellar lodges observe humanity; one must not act wrongly. Each shall account for their deeds. The virtuous enjoy long life without doubt. Instruct and admonish the young so they may offer sustenance to their ancestors; otherwise, they erase their own names. Do not violate Heaven’s prohibitions, nor Earth’s punishments. Follow the four seasons in compliance, avoiding the taint of killing. The Five Phases bring completion—each must guard their place. Let no evil name arise. Do not slight superiors or inferiors, for all alternately govern one another, ensuring no sudden or violent ends, and thus attaining illustrious renown.\n\nReflect deeply in the heart, cautiously distancing the form. When essence and spirit disperse, malevolent ghosts startle the person. Contemplate self-preservation, never forgetting your name. Each has their joys—pursue the Dao and seek goodness to extend years and increase longevity, even attaining long life. Be cautious, be ever cautious—do not pervert justice in punishment. Though initially taxing, honor follows thereafter.\n\nMasters may be good or evil; contemplate the root to perfect the branch. Disobedient disciples also forfeit their names and cannot attain transcendence. Violating the Earth’s punishments and spirits only compounds wickedness, barring rebirth. Be cautious, again be cautious.\n\nWithin the body, the radiance of spirit arises naturally. Inner and outer become one; movements and words follow propriety without losing sincerity. The Five Spirits reside within, knowing one’s shortfalls and longevity. Do not lightly transgress, for records are kept. Even minor faults are reported above to the Hall of Light. Form and spirit are bound and interrogated regarding one’s deeds. Grave offenses incur irrevocable consequences; lesser ones reduce one’s years. If the spirits do not exonerate, the person bears the penalty—there are laws and punishments. Not only living people act thus; spirits, ghosts, and entities do the same. The ancients, knowing this, dared not transgress. The reckoning of humans and spirits descends from Heaven and Earth. Without merit, one cannot expect reward.\n\nThe hearts of the worthy and sagely illuminate the scriptures. The scrolls contain warnings and prophecies—evil people act perversely. Those who covet life are protected by Heaven. Those who covet nurturance are aided by Earth. Those who covet humaneness are beloved by all. To exceed this and do evil is to invite destruction. Heaven knows their wickedness and dispatches malevolent spirits and spectral entities to await them, entering the body and flowing outward to the four limbs, head, face, abdomen, back, chest, flanks, and the Seven Governors. They ascend to report to the Hall of Light, manifesting in seventy-two forms—this is the corpse of death. When the Five Viscera are afflicted, their departure has its time. Be cautious in diet, avoid being assailed by wind and cold. Move in accord with virtue, and this is the span of a full life.\n\nHeaven covets human life; Earth covets human longevity. Humans covet humaneness, but to act wickedly invites calamity beyond remedy. Thus, Heaven’s scriptures instruct and command the people not to violate the prohibitions. Heaven’s qi issues words through people—each should wash away impure conduct. Be cautious, do not forget, and joy will follow. Otherwise, there is no need to persist—[words indistinct] as spoken.\n\nWrite Not in Vain, Solely for Self-Admonition: One Hundred Eighty-Seventh\n\nIn ancient times, the words of divine sages never strayed from the guiding principles, for they held to standards and measures. The ignorant must each take heed—this warning cuts deep indeed. Whether punishment for transgressions is light or severe, all arises from human action, not mere emptiness; one invariably receives what is due. Heaven’s nature is spontaneous and cannot be deceived. Reflect deeply and without cease, and your conduct shall become that of the celestial spirits.\n\nTransformation occurs in its time; do not lose the guiding principles. The qi of the four seasons must not be violated. When the spirit is present, negligence is no longer possible. Should one fail to report, Heaven will divine it, and the gods will act to prevent falsehoods from being concealed—only then may one live. Otherwise, punishment will be meted out: selling vegetables in the marketplace, unable to receive or take, one’s face marked by the moon as shameful, despised by others, scorned by the multitude. For grave transgressions, the penalty runs deep—forty years must pass before one may again ascend as a messenger of the gods. For middling offenses, thirty years; for lesser, ten. The domains they once governed are stripped away, each with its own appointed order. Yet if one can reform the heart and reproach oneself, one may once more endure long. Do not alter Heaven’s words and thereby invite blame upon yourself—can you not reflect deeply?\n\nFor those destined to become immortal adepts, weigh carefully the depth of your considerations. Blame rests with oneself; do not resent the words of the gods. In all your comings and goings, inner and outer, be vigilant against error or omission. Examine closely what you have received, for when entrusted by Heaven as its emissary, you may not act at will. You must promptly accept the mandate and may not delay, for reproach will come swiftly. For grave transgressions, the messenger is demoted, and the earth records what was received—name and document alike—with no delay permitted. Where a vacancy arises, one of lower rank fills it. The reason is this: even those whose hearts are wholly devoted to immortality may be demoted—how much more so the foolish adept?\n\nFrom this point onward, take care to commit no further violations. Heaven holds humans accountable for their transgressions, and ghosts and spirits serve as its agents. Those who defy Heaven’s teachings will invariably encounter misfortune and blame, not through whipping or flogging, but through the natural course of their actions. Should you doubt this, you will be regarded with suspicion and may not remain long. Thus, the warning is repeated: be cautious indeed.\n\nDo not imitate the ways of common folk, who with wine and meat seek to reconcile and appease. The Dao of immortality is most weighty, and thus it is spoken to humanity. Those whose fate is to endure are dispatched by the spirits, riding clouds and dragons, traversing all before coming to rest. When Heaven issues its commands, they must once more be carried out. Do not lose the rules and principles, nor neglect the records, for evidence is set in place, and one should not presume to act on one’s own. Heaven too rests, and each receives their due punishment—there is no cause for resentment. When reported by the spirits, do not transgress recklessly.\n\nBetween Heaven above and Earth below, the children of harmony must each respect themselves, lest they blame Heaven for misfortune or Earth for calamity, and thus be detained above or below. Even as with the people, when the words of decrees and commands lack sincerity, those below grow resentful and do not remain long. If the gods of Heaven contend over the Dao, how much more so the common folk? One ought to uphold and comply with Heaven’s laws, follow the harmony of Heaven, discard the root of recklessness, and cast off the garments of negligence. With merit, one may advance further. One may preside over those of the same rank, and when reporting, there is a fixed time. Act in accordance with the texts, without doubt. Each has their own report, and there is no mutual resentment when both are equal. Those who jointly recommend another will be punished and further debased. Though not immediately demoted, when dispatched by a great spirit, one may not act on personal inclination but must deliver the matter to the local earth deity, never to ascend again. Thus, when a vacancy arises, one’s person does not occupy it, for the ranks—high, middle, and low—are intermingled as one.\n\nHeed these words carefully, lest the span of your life be forfeit and bound to the earth. The earth here is not the soil of the ground but possesses its own fierce spirits, who guard it as Heaven’s earthly emissaries. Should one fail to act as instructed, suffering will swiftly follow. Even immortals may err—how can mortals presume to act at will? Thus, the Controller of Fate is commanded to remain close to the heart and mind, never far from a person. Humans are the dwelling place of spirit and essence; fortune and misfortune lie within. Why seek to flee afar? To bring turmoil upon oneself is to hasten ruin, and when life is not yet spent but one’s allotted years are exhausted, distance is of no avail.\n\nWhen Heaven convenes the spirits, the master knows life and death. Should the spirits themselves err or falter, they will suffer the consequences. Thus, human lives may not endure long, and so divine messengers are sent to display their writings. Those who receive the warnings and cease their evil may yet delay their report to Heaven for a brief time. In eating the various grains, take care never to burn mountains or break stones, nor to extend harm to grasses and trees, to break blossoms or injure branches, or to sell their fruits in markets and streets, cutting them with blades so that stem and root are utterly destroyed. Their mother will grow angry and report to their father, who will not spare the years of humans. Humans too require plants for their sustenance, but one should take only what is withered and fallen, not flourishing—this is to follow the natural order. Heaven and Earth give life as humans desire to live—why act with abandon and harm future generations? Those with understanding must not violate the prohibitions.\n\nThere are those who harm others, yet they rely on the completion of affairs without taking the young and tender. Those who provide food for others may extend their lives slightly, but their names are ultimately recorded. Do not raise weapons to rob, harm, or coerce lives. Heaven has decreed that such people may not live long. Evil begets evil, troubling the spirits and the qi of ghosts and spirits, each of whom may not rest. Is this not the fault of human transgression?\n\nThose who previously committed evil will have their misfortune descend upon their descendants. Thus, children may be born on inauspicious days, or during pregnancy when thunder, lightning, the waxing and waning of the moon, the new moon, the dark of the moon, blood taboos, or opposing branches converge to join yin and yang—such children will not thrive and will surely meet with misfortune. The qi of the earth summons them, yet they blame the wolf in the granary. Evil is repaid with evil—what more can be hoped for? Those who do not change will bring about their own extinction, leaving no household. In death, they will not be equal to the multitude.\n\nThe officers, soldiers, and ranks of this company, when they reach desolate and unclean places, are scarcely covered with earth before foxes and dogs devour them. Their remains ungathered, cast aside by the roadside, both soul and spirit suffer without respite. Some cling to grasses and trees, consumed by the six livestock—when shall they be reborn? Punishment for evil and reward for good are known to all; why not reform oneself? Heaven repays merit and withholds from the virtueless. Ponder this, ponder it well. Rewards and punishments are clear.\n\nOne may die in solitary agony, yet the span of life for good and evil must ebb and flow. Examine this carefully, be cautious, and you may avoid blame. Thus, this solemn warning is given to prompt repentance. The convergence of fortune and misfortune lies worlds apart. Therefore, this text is set down to admonish and caution: do not blame Heaven or fault the earth, for good and evil must be distinguished.\n\nThe text records one’s allotted fortune, teaching that evil may turn to good, though the soul and spirit labor to exhaustion. Fools remain ignorant, so the words are repeated, reiterated, and passed on, lest later generations incur blame. By this, one may verify for oneself—what grievance remains? No resentment lingers, for each receives their due.\n\nThis text must be transmitted without cease. The wise may shorten their years, but fools will copy it themselves. Those who disregard its words bring only suffering upon themselves.\n\n**The One Hundred and Eighteenth Admonition on the Bridge of Punishment for the Dead with Transgressions**\n\nIn the age of antiquity, divine sages foresaw the future and governed in harmony with Heaven. They were deployed across the four directions, above and below, and at the center, each with their appointed ranks and duties. High and low regarded one another, and order was achieved without coercion—all acted with goodness. Fearing any lapse, all shared a single heart.\n\nHeaven’s messengers hastened to carry out their tasks, riding chariots of cloud and vapor, drawn by flying dragons. Divine immortals followed in ranks, each bearing ledgers. Without movement, they aligned themselves, fearing any disruption. Their actions followed rules, and they fulfilled their duties. In spring, they nurtured the qi of life; in summer, they fostered growth; in autumn, they oversaw the harvest, ensuring the people had offerings; in winter, they stored surplus grain, maintaining continuity without lapse.\n\nThe blessings of the spirits extended to all, bestowing glory. Even the crawling creatures and grasses and trees received their grace—was this not the benevolence of the above? Each received what was due. When they ate, there was always surplus, the new and old sustaining one another. How could one forget this? Having received the people’s aid, they ensured the spirits held no resentment.\n\nGood people were repaid, each supporting the other in sufficiency. Heaven willed it so; hoarding was forbidden, lest people suffer hunger and cold. Thus, the wealthy were commanded to lend to the poor, exchanging the old for the new, enabling life and growth to be passed to descendants. The spirits protected and aided them—was this not the vast dissemination of benevolence?\n\nYet fools, lacking understanding, refused to repay or give thanks, assuming it their due. Their hearts grew unbalanced, and they seized others’ possessions to adorn themselves, lacking any thought of repayment or regard for hardship. They believed themselves capable of living out their full span. Thus, the text was written again.\n\nDivine and perfected beings seek the good, those who transmit and apply the text’s teachings. Such people may extend their lives, increase their years, and harmonize with Heaven and Earth, transforming into spirits. They may ride forth, traversing above and below, the center, and the six directions—is this not good? Why not reflect deeply and keep it within? The dwelling of the spirit observes human actions. Knowing one’s due, one should serve and comply, turning from misfortune toward fortune. Even slight discord with Heaven’s will is unwise.\n\nThe myriad spirits and officers of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases record human lives. How can one fail to revere them, to contemplate repaying their grace? Those who refuse to do good acts against the celestial spirits. The celestial spirits cause wind and rain to fall unseasonably, altering the flow of qi. When it should be cold, it grows warm; when it should be warm, it turns cold. Planting and sowing occur at the wrong times, and farmers grow resentful, unwilling to tend the land for others. They scorn the grains, feeding them to dogs and swine, then abandon their fields for lands of virtue.\n\nWhere they sow, the harvest is meager; trees wither and shed their leaves. The people lack surplus grain, turning to predation and strife, competing for dominance alone. Forgetting truth, they later become the impoverished, reaping nothing, drifting as refugees. Before reaching the lands where grain is scorned, they starve by the roadside, dizzy and blinded, staggering wildly. After days without food, they die of hunger, unburied. No one in their household, great or small, escapes disaster, yet they curse Heaven for their misfortune.\n\nTheir land grows desolate, granaries empty of grain, meat scarce, and no coins stored. Year by year, the crisis deepens, leaving nothing to supply the court. Exemptions increase, granaries remain unfilled, and the Minister of Agriculture holds only empty documents. There is nothing to distribute, no salaries to pay, and the central lands lack resources. The people look to the state, yet no aid is given, and a time of great hardship arises.\n\nAll this is what Heaven abhors. The earth cannot long sustain such people—do the wicked not understand? Perfected beings must urgently transmit this text to lands of virtue, urging all to reflect and awaken. Only then may they live out their full span. The ignorant are no different from beasts; life cannot be forcibly prolonged. It is attained through one’s own conduct, with no cause to blame Heaven.\n\nPonder the text carefully, constantly cultivating filial piety, loyalty, trust, benevolence, and generosity. Acknowledge your faults, and you will have descendants. The text does not speak in vain. In lands without virtue, Heaven offers no protection. The celestial balance moves swiftly, and the sun and moon hasten, their light dimmed.\n\nIn lands of virtue, the celestial balance slows, and the sun and moon shine brightly—this is Heaven’s way. The celestial balance, the sun, moon, and stars all favor the good and bright. If they dim, it is the result of one’s own actions—what cause is there for blame? They are one with Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nThose who witness Heaven’s retribution see its clarity. When the five planets deviate from their courses, weapons and war rage, barbarians invade, and rebels rise. The state dispatches generals and armies; those with fate return, those without perish. This is the fault of the great.\n\nThose who are unfilial as sons produce few loyal ministers in the state; their conduct impure, they invite mutual conflict, which ceases only at the year’s end.\n\nThus is revealed the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*, named *Great Peace*. Those who practice it receive its blessings; those who do not bring upon themselves the utmost suffering, their bodies bound without escape. Retribution is ever just, never unjust. Those who do not act as others do inflict harm upon them.\n\nIt is often said that none, whether noble or base, are not born of Heaven—only their recorded destinies differ. Cherish this, be mindful of it, and take heed: do not impose upon others what you ought not, nor encroach upon or oppress the innocent. Such deeds find no recompense in Heaven, no sustenance on Earth. Malevolent spirits follow, and one cannot long enjoy life or delight in existence.\n\nThose who neglect themselves should not expect to live. Without a name in the register of long life, they forcibly enter the halls of the immortals, offering sacrifices to the gods and beseeching transcendence. Yet when the immortals consult the ledgers, they find no name for them—their prayers and offerings go unanswered. Wandering as beggars, they implore the gods anew, only to incur divine wrath. They are devoured by fierce beasts, their bones and flesh consumed, gnawed by foxes and jackals, never to return home. Even neighbors and kin claim they have attained immortality, yet no sign or response confirms it—how can they prove themselves? By this, it is clear: verification is difficult. Only when retribution is witnessed by all is ascension confirmed. Otherwise, they suffer punishment, their claims of partial success mere delusion. Such people are mad or base, yet they take their own words as truth. Together, they enter the realm of the dead, descending to the Yellow Springs, powerless to choose their fate.\n\nThose of virtue who are destined for transcendence have their names recorded in life. When their years are fulfilled, they are received above, and escorts come for them. The young and ignorant, however, know not how to proceed. They squander their wealth, abandon their homes, and wander the wilds in vain. The Way naturally bestows rank upon people—it cannot be forcibly sought. If one inflicts suffering upon oneself, neglects to care for parents, or forsakes family to be seen as a worthy scholar, yet remains unfilial, disloyal, and untrustworthy, they may live out their years, but beneath the earth, they will know no joy or ease. With surplus wealth and property passed to descendants, one should provide for their needs without self-imposed hardship. Whether descendants are worthy or not, each lives their own life, free from mutual harm—this is good conduct.\n\nThus is this text recorded to enlighten the wise. Fools disregard it, indulging in reckless joy and anger, while the wise avoid punishment and evade misfortune. If three admonitions go unheeded, one should desist. Heaven aids the good and does not favor the wicked. Each must be vigilant, refraining from mutual blame. Let each act in their own best interest, for all possess understanding. None should transgress against Heaven, nor force what is not recorded in the ledgers—such efforts are futile. The reason is this: Heaven does not protect the rebellious and perverse.\n\nDo not abandon your dwelling or the city walls. Bones join to form the paths, sinews govern the desire for life and fortify the walls, vessels direct movement as the skeletal network, and flesh within the skin serves as the vessels’ covering. The spirit within guards and oversees human good and evil—what need is there for distant concern? The Seven Governors stand watch at the gates of the spirit.\n\nThose who seek the Way and attain life do not leave their dwellings. Through transformation, they unite with the spirit in virtue. What more does the Way require? Thus are good deeds inscribed in Heaven’s records. The ledgers of immortals differ from those of the mundane. At the time of ascension, the gods who oversee the registers and the guarantors arrive, for each knows their charge and the teachings they must uphold. There is an order to advancement, and each must proceed accordingly, not by their own will, but as the host of gods governs, ensuring all align with Heaven’s will.\n\nThose who precede others in cultivation possess hearts of clarity and vision, free from partiality. Their conduct and birth remain unknown to others, for they existed before Heaven and Earth. Their transformations above and below never stray from the Way, though the gods do not fully manifest. They establish the framework, the cycles of years and months, each with attendants to left and right. The stars and constellations are distinguished, each with its charge, tasked with advancing the loyal and assigning divisions. When good is seen, it is advanced; when evil is seen, it is withdrawn. What doubt remains? Each acts by their own effort, never misled by the gods. Thus do they succeed and earn the title *Heavenly Lord*.\n\nThose who govern Heaven’s affairs keep meticulous records, never straying from the measure. The gods who oversee the four directions and their divisions—each direction has its first, second, and third, rotating in sequence above and below—are called the *Great Year*. The *Great Yin* follows behind, overseeing the patterns of the Earth. The four seasons are established, governing all that is born and completed, dwelling in the wilds with their early and late grains and grasses. Those near do not live long, while those far endure, and the trees of sacred groves grow small of their own accord.\n\nWhen dynasties change, punishment extends to descendants. The reason is this: those who do not dwell in peace, who abandon the old for the new, find their spirits unsettled. Each person has a life-tree planted in Heaven’s soil, its type determined by the season of their birth. Those born in spring’s third month have mulberry as their life-tree; those born in summer’s third month, jujube or plum; those born in autumn’s third month, catalpa or *Platycodon*; those born in winter’s third month, locust or cypress. These are the trees of the common people, each overseen by an official. As life nears its end, the tree withers halfway; when life ends, it withers and falls, and the official fells it. How then can the person live? To seek long life and avoid death, one must transform their heart and will, transplanting their tree near Heaven’s gate, where it is called *Long Life*. The divine officials oversee it, keeping it pure, radiant, and lustrous, born of Heaven’s domain, protected by the honored spirits.\n\nIf one can but preserve their name from ruin, Heaven’s constant mandate ensures generation upon generation of glory. Though they may not descend to protect, in time, they will naturally attain refinement. The reason is this: having long departed from the mundane, they engage in Heaven’s affairs and cannot falter. The gods examine them as a carpenter’s line and ink—how can they act of their own accord? Thus do they not descend, and one should not find this strange. When merit is due, it is recognized, for they are not like the common folk. Though others may see no benefit to their families, they are inwardly honored—is this not good?\n\nThus is this revealed to later generations, to awaken their hearts. Do not conceal this text, for concealment invites punishment. Do not associate with the deceitful or those whose hearts lack filial piety and loyalty. All should act in accord with the text’s words, lest they face reproach. Can one not be cautious?\n\nThis record is for the wise. The foolish disregard it, indulging in reckless anger and joy, while the wise avoid punishment and evade misfortune. If three admonitions go unheeded, one should desist. Heaven protects the good and does not favor the wicked. Each must be vigilant, refraining from mutual blame. Let each act in their own best interest, for all possess understanding. None should transgress against Heaven or force what is not recorded in the ledgers—such efforts are futile. The reason is this: Heaven does not protect the rebellious and perverse.\n\nLet transmission be to those worthy of it, that they may safeguard and elevate it. Do not violate the sacred texts, nor test the divine words; heed the admonitions of the gods, for Heaven metes out retribution. Do not lightly transgress, lest calamity follow—minor offenses invite reprimand, while grave faults admit no salvation. Thus do the gods oversee one another, reporting transgressions above; those who act falsely shall face judgment. Matters must be interconnected, not kept private. The gods inspect and uphold one another, so why doubt the need for later remorse? To halt midway is to invite scrutiny; failure to confess the truth will lead to examination, and only then will the guilty be brought low. Thus, all actions are subject to review. Those who persist in wrongdoing shall remain unchanged—this is the meaning. Do not transgress lightly, nor harbor doubt. The laws of the gods are weighty; one must be cautious, deliberate, ponder, and reflect upon them. Is not the Way of long life and enduring vitality worthy of reverence?\n\nThus is this text revealed to fill the void, to establish good deeds, and to ensure unbroken succession. Those who do good shall see their years lengthen, with no cause for doubt. The natural Dao knows no end; only through awakening and mutual correction can one avoid even the slightest misstep, which invites suspicion. Heaven delights in music to gladden the gods, who in turn listen. The virtuous receive reward, while those whose tones and melodies falter face judgment. Each has their own master; none may lack origin or end. Those who fail to cultivate virtue consume from Heaven’s granaries and wear the robes of the Minister of Agriculture, yet their cold and warmth shift like garments. The yang is honored, the yin debased; coarse and fine, all things—gold, silver, brocade, pearls, jade—are to be evenly distributed, with no arbitrary bestowals. Only those with merit may receive Heaven’s clothing and sustenance. As stated before, this is reiterated to prevent resentment or suspicion, for Heaven holds the commands of the gods in great esteem.\n\nAt year’s end, ledgers are gathered and reviewed. From mountains and seas to lands and waters, all shrines and communal altars submit their records; nothing may be lost or omitted. The guardians of dwellings observe the people’s transgressions, submitting monthly reports. The Minister of Agriculture and the officials of the temples then relay the documents in turn. The Great Yin Legal Bureau calculates debts and liabilities, deducting years from one’s lifespan. When the tally is exhausted, the yin spirits of the earth and the administrators of the earthly treasuries are summoned to reclaim the physical form and examine the hun and po souls. Detailed ledgers are submitted, verifying whether deeds align with records. Those found to harbor deceit or private schemes face penalties commensurate with their offenses. If the ledgers do not bear Heaven’s mandate, the spirits and numinous beings may not afflict the living. Each must inspect and correct themselves, exposing their own faults. Offenses grave enough to warrant death result in demotion to labor at river crossings, mountains, or seas, each according to the severity of their transgression, with no omissions. Each locale—prefectures, counties, post stations—has its overseers and magistrates to enforce the law, ensuring no unjust harm befalls the spirits or numinous beings.\n\nThus do the upper and lower realms circulate documents in accordance with established decrees. **On the Desire for Fine Clothing and Footwear, Admonition 189**\nFrom ancient times to the present, all have their allotted stations, moving upward, downward, or laterally, each receiving what is due. Like a line drawn with inked cord, nothing strays—how could one fail to discern the boundary between life and death? Each must be vigilant, not offending the gods, and fulfill their duties without neglecting their fate. Record these admonitions: the virtuous shall ascend, the wicked shall be demoted. In the convergence of fortune and misfortune, each receives what they desire. One may only follow, not defy. A perverse heart that resents the divine messengers reaps its own consequences—whom else can it blame? Some are difficult to transform, their knowledge deficient; all suffer the consequences. Those who act perversely beyond their station, then boast of it, spewing worldly affairs from their mouths, utterly lacking wisdom—seeing only the present, heedless of the future—shall meet with disaster and separation from loved ones, slandering the good. They invert Heaven and Earth, oblivious to the gods.\n\nThose who keep records to resolve enmities should offer abundant libations and fine meats, indulging freely. What seems acceptable in the moment later invites reproach, as others speak lightly, cursing and uttering unfilial words, engaging in deceit, slander, and theft—even of others’ wives—day and night lying in wait to seize opportunities. They sell what they seize to sustain themselves, coveting fine clothing and footwear, competing in disputes and arguments, disregarding reason in their pursuit of livelihood. How can such lives endure? Fools become notorious villains; when magistrates learn of them, their subordinates arrest and swiftly punish them, bringing calamity to kin and stranger alike, all sharing in the blame. The poor must rely on their own efforts, not idly fold their hands. These are the life ledgers, the endowments one receives at birth. Evil spirits follow them—how can they linger long? Such people are many, their fates intertwined, never ceasing. Thus it is said: evil spirits claim them. A moment’s carelessness, if unchecked, invites ruin; one’s own actions invite the resentment of others. What seems acceptable in the moment is heedless of the future. Heed the warnings and desist, that one may live out the remainder of their allotted years.\n\nRecords of good and evil determine the span of life and the time of its extension. One must cultivate virtue. Those who fail to perceive the worthies and sages, whose wisdom is abundant, who cherish life and dread death, and aspire to the ranks of the immortals, may yet prolong their years. Why abandon the world, inviting misfortune to flow from birth, even to the child in the womb? They say, “I am born of the same parents as others,” yet they blame Heaven and curse Earth, claiming evil should be separate, not mingled—pure and impure divided like lord and servant. Thus, those who follow the great Dao live, while those who do not become dust. This has been so from ancient times to the present. There are the good and the evil, passed down through generations, never ceasing—only varying in number. Heaven, knowing the prevalence of rebellion, has thus reiterated this text. After understanding the admonitions, let there be no doubt; ten or a hundred shall align—when could one escape?\n\n**On Not Forgetting the Admonitions and Attaining Blessings, Admonition 190**\nOnly Heaven and Earth, from their primordial beginnings, formed the spiritual essence, upholding the natural order and giving rise to all transformations. None fail to receive glory.\n\nWhereupon the celestial bureaucracy was established: the sun, moon, and stars; the celestial pivots and balances governing the seasons; and the Five Stars, each assigned its quadrant and duty. Clouds and rain are dispensed, the people’s cares are overseen by the Office of Agriculture, and primordial qi gathers and lingers. All grains, grasses, and trees; all creatures that crawl, pant, or wriggle; all that flies, walks, or swims—each contains primordial qi, enabling the people to use them for sacrifices and sustenance. Only those taken for harm may be used for one’s own needs. Oxen, horses, mules, and donkeys unfit for service are offered to the realm. When the earth spirits have abundance, they gather to share the feast.\n\nDo not kill those fit for service, nor the young of tooth—this is Heaven’s decree, revered by the divine spirits. Yet the people, foolish and reckless, slaughter wantonly, even those with child in the womb, turning life to death to feed the mouths of others. At the hour of death, all tremble, knowing they will not live. Thus Heaven, in its compassion and mercy, enacts prohibitions and bans; violators are punished.\n\nEven the six livestock shun the sight of bloodshed, unable to bear injury—yet humans, who should cherish themselves, instead act as bandits and butchers. Their predations are many: wielding blades without cause, killing without consequence. Though not immediately executed, Heaven accumulates their transgressions. Their slaughter never ceases; their corpses drift downward, unborn. Such ones shall never encounter fortune. The gods despise them, the overseers stand before them—when could they escape?\n\nThus the record of good and evil is weighty; only by not transgressing can one avoid it. Divine persons and perfected ones reveal this text to the people, its meaning unhidden, so they may not blame themselves. Hence it is written in the vernacular for clarity.\n\nThe wise and worthy do not transgress; the foolish must be admonished without cease. Teachers come in succession, yet none should forget the root. Cherishing the root while embracing the new, longing as in the beginning—this is the Way of life. Merits vary in greatness, and rewards differ accordingly.\n\nThis is the method for awakening the unknowing: the unknowing intent, the unknowing thought, the unknowing word, the unknowing aspiration—when both are made clear, this is Heaven’s will. The Way of generation and completion emerges therefrom.\n\nGain trust from Heaven, gain trust from Earth, gain trust from the Center, gain trust from the Four Seasons, gain trust from the Five Phases—these are all the faithful rewards Heaven bestows. Not a fraction is lost—do you not understand?\n\nThis is the commissioning of formless qi, the natural submission to transformation. Thus the Three Terraces and Seven Stars assist in rectifying Heaven’s majesty; the sun and moon illuminate right and wrong, enabling the natural order, so that none may later repent.\n\nHence the edict is reiterated to all underlings and overseers: names and commands are made clear, and those who receive punishment bear no resentment. This is what it means to avoid righting others’ wrongs. No precept, great or small, is exempt from being a model.\n\nNot forgetting these words brings long blessings. One should act with caution, not losing moderation. Thus words are tested by self-sacrifice. When writings remain unused, emperors and kings do not believe. Flatterers at their side prevent the texts from being understood. Disasters arise together—where can the people find refuge?\n\nThe *Scripture of Great Peace* reappears only after three *jiazi* cycles; better to admonish ten times so they may understand. Strive to seek knowledge while alive—even the worthy and sagely may attain it. The sage promotes the worthy, then seeks life thereafter, not despising those who follow.\n\nThe register of divine immortals lies at the North Pole, linked to Kunlun. Within Kunlun’s ruins dwell the perfected ones, their ascent and descent governed by constancy. The perfected ones oversee those recorded in the registers, their names listed in order. The exalted attain the exalted, the middling the middling, the lowly the lowly—none are left to beg or plead.\n\nThe first to arrive become teachers, honored as lords, addressed as fathers. Thus teachers, lords, and fathers must be clearly understood; ministers must be loyal, disciples obedient. Reverence flows upward, ascending ever higher.\n\nThus Heaven does not forget the teacher’s grace, Earth does not forget the teacher’s nurturance, and people do not forget the teacher’s generosity. Hence loyalty, filial piety, and trust arise, fostering life without malice, drawing near to clarity.\n\nHeaven’s light shines down to the Yellow Springs; Earth’s light shines up to the heavens. The clarity of the Center harmonizes above and below. When the Three Clarities align, harmony is achieved.\n\nHeaven names the Three Clarities as the sun, moon, and stars, which illuminate the Center and Earth below without cease. In lands devoid of virtue, yin qi obscures the sun, leaving it without light. The people live in fear; grains scarcely multiply. Drought and flood strike without pattern, and the people flee as refugees to lands with grain.\n\nHeaven pities them, guiding them to live in enlightened realms, where wise rulers prosper the refugees. They return to cultivate abandoned fields, and all grains grow to maturity. The people regain their sustenance, once more honoring their ancestors, and the ghosts and spirits find peace.\n\nAmong them are the wise and discerning, who seek divine immortality. Their names are recorded in registers and ledgers. They may ascend to become Heaven’s officials, patrolling the mortal realm, harmonizing wind and rain, and governing in peace. This text is shown to later generations.\n\nThus one should do good, benefiting Heaven. Thereafter, admonish your descendants to extend their years—how could they not attain it? Though the text is repeated, Heaven deeply loves humanity, desiring that all fulfill their years. Its exhortations are earnest and reiterated, entrusted to the gods.\n\nGood deeds are promptly recorded above; evil ones erase one’s name. Do not defy this text. Cultivate a mind of goodness, ever mindful, and seek life with unwavering aspiration. The reason is this: human aspiration should attain its aim. Strive with diligence, each according to their wish—Heaven neither compels nor forbids.\n\nThe same holds for the four directions beneath the earth, for the boundless heavens, the boundless earth, the boundless realms, the boundless clarity, and the boundless light. Yet even the smallest completion is Heaven’s great division. To govern and contemplate the affairs of Heaven above, Heaven governs and contemplates the Center’s harmony, and the Center brings peace.\n\nSeek nobility in thought, and the gods of nobility honor it; seek wealth in thought, and the gods of wealth enrich it. Between suffering and joy, ever reflect—weigh carefully every word.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven spans myriad eons, yet rests in human action; it does not thwart mortal aspirations. The Way of life and nurturance may be clearly observed; the Way of death is what ghosts dread. Malevolent spirits find no peace, and swiftly incur calamity—such is the pattern inscribed.\n\nIn Heaven above, there is a pattern: the root of seeking life. Human desires gave rise to this text, that all may ponder it. If one errs and repents, consult this text. If not, then desist—speak no reckless words. The divine spirits stand before and behind you, without respite.\n\nAbove: *Heaven’s Prosperity, the Flourishing State, the Descending Luminous Former Masters, the Worthy and Sage Dao, the Joyous Spirits of Heaven and Earth—Emerging to Aid Human Governance, Extending Longevity to All, Repelling the Four Barbarians.*\n\n**End of Scroll One Hundred Twelve of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n\n**Scroll One Hundred Thirteen of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n**Method of Joy and Anger, Fortune and Misfortune, One Hundred Ninety-One**\n\nWe ask: When the qi of Great Peace arrives in full, should the people but face one another daily in leisure, ever equipped with musical instruments as the norm, thereby harmonizing and transforming one another? Would this benefit the state above, causing Heaven’s qi to harmonize, perpetually delighting the state with longevity, while the world is embraced by its virtue and teaching, free from fault?\n\nHow is it made clear whether joy is attained or not? How is harmony or disharmony proven?\n\nFearing that some matters might remain unclear even after questioning the Heavenly Master, and anxious that omissions might persist, we have asked repeatedly, front and back, without daring to slacken—lest Heaven grow angry.\n\nExcellent! Your questioning on Heaven’s behalf grows ever more refined, grasping the celestial intent. The Perfected One shall surely gain boundless years and longevity, blessed by Heaven.\n\nVery well. Be seated, and I shall once more expound its meaning in full for all disciples, making it lucid and knowable.\n\nThose who possess minor attainment in music and grasp its minor meaning delight the people; those of middling attainment who grasp its middling meaning delight in governance; those of superior attainment who grasp its superior meaning delight Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who attain the method of delighting the people cause the people to rejoice; those who attain the method of delighting governance bring peace to governance; those who attain the method of delighting Heaven and Earth bring harmony to Heaven and Earth. When Heaven and Earth are in harmony, all things remain free from illness, and the host of spirits perpetually rejoice, never knowing anger.\n\nThis is the arrival of the upright qi of Great Peace, the joy of perfect music. Thus, when through music one attains the tones of *Great Horn* and *Upper Horn*, the Azure Thearch rejoices greatly, and the virtue and power of benevolence emerge. All things delight in life, the Azure Thearch sets forth on his journey, and the qi of the liver remains free from illness. The spirit-essence of the liver manifests, revealing the kindred of the eastern direction. All that is harmful is entirely dispelled, while all that is good advances to assist transformation. Azure-clad jade maidens bear wondrous prescriptions to bestow upon humankind—this is its clear proof.\n\nPerfected One, ponder deeply this meaning.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, when the *Upper Horn* tone is attained, it transforms the upper; when the *Middle Horn* tone is attained, it transforms the middle; when the *Lower Horn* tone is attained, it transforms the lower—each attained to bring about transformation.\n\nThe *Zheng* tones of the southern direction, great and small, all in harmony, cause all things to delight in growth. In the southern direction, virtue and power know no joy unmet; what is harmful is dispelled, what is good advances entirely, and the crimson qi rejoices wholly. The crimson spirit comes forth on its journey, the heart remains free from illness, and the spirit of the heart emerges to appear, awaiting the arrival of the crimson-clad jade maidens who bear wondrous prescriptions to bestow upon humankind—this is its great proof.\n\nThus, when the harmony of the yellow qi and the *Gong* tone is attained, the good of the *Gong* tone likewise comes entirely, while what is harmful dissipates entirely. When the harmony of the *Shang* tone is attained, the good of the *Shang* tone likewise comes entirely, while what is harmful dissipates entirely. When the harmony of the *Yu* tone is attained, the good of the *Yu* tone likewise comes entirely, while what is harmful departs entirely.\n\nPerfected One, ponder deeply the essential meaning of what brings about these effects and their fundamental practice.\n\nThe reason the five directions are not exhaustively expounded is that their profundity is vast. The superior person, upon glimpsing them, naturally grasps their meaning, using the one to encompass the myriad. The middling person, upon attaining them, might grow overly exuberant. The petty person, upon gaining them, might speak recklessly. Thus, they are not fully revealed, allowing each person to contemplate their meaning for themselves.\n\nThe superior person, moreover, uses the one to encompass the myriad, thoroughly understanding their meaning—there is no need to expound them fully. The middling person, too, may gradually come to know them—there is no need to expound them fully. The petty person, if they attain them, might speak recklessly—there is no need to expound them fully.\n\nTherefore, with measured restraint and careful consideration, the outline is briefly raised to reveal the matter to ordinary people, allowing each to contemplate its meaning. In this way, high and low may communicate and penetrate without error.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the superior person governs with music to enact non-action and deliver the world; the middling person governs with music to harmonize and delight the common people, thereby regulating and ordering them; the petty person governs with music merely to entertain others, thereby summoning sustenance. These three kinds of people, each understanding their intent, when the qi of Great Peace arrives, allow them to act as they will, following their use of lutes and zithers—take care not to prohibit it. If the qi of music does not emerge, governance will be difficult to pacify. When governance is difficult to pacify, qi contends and disputes arise, leading to many punishments.\n\nMusic brings forth joy, and punishments bring forth penalties, like echoes and shadows, not deviating by even a fraction. Now, music is that by which anger is stilled, and anger is that by which music is stilled—these two oppose each other. Thus, when there is music, anger ceases; when there is anger, music ceases. Therefore, anger gives rise to punishments and penalties, the root of contention, while joy and delight are the gateway to virtue and the Dao. Hence, one should follow it, allowing the root of virtue and the Dao to grow—do not suppress it, for suppression will instead give rise to the gateway of penal misfortune.\n\nFrom this emerge good and ill fortune, from this arise safety and danger. Thus, music is yang, and punishments are yin. Yin and yang are ever opposed; when yang flourishes, yin wanes, and when yin flourishes, yang wanes. Yang is the ruler, yin is the minister. When the ruler is strong, the minister submits, and the people are easily governed. When the minister is strong, the ruler is treated with contempt and disorder arises—this is the natural law of Heaven.\n\nTherefore, one should follow the ruler’s joy to subdue the people and ministers, curbing their frequent anger. The people of later ages are foolish and do not deeply understand this intent, instead often cutting it off, causing yin qi to flourish and yang qi to wane. When yin qi flourishes, there are many thieves and bandits, and criminals never cease. All things fail to grow, often harmed by yin—great calamity lies here. When the qi of music flourishes, yang qi prevails, cutting off this harm. When the ruler’s qi flourishes, it brings extended years and added longevity, so that the highest elders live long.\n\nNow, ease and joy belong to Heaven above; haste, anger, and punishments belong to Earth below. When that which belongs to Heaven is put into practice, all affairs are ordered; when that which belongs to Earth is put into practice, all affairs are disordered. Perfected One, take heed—can these words not be deeply pondered? Indeed, indeed. You may be said to understand deeply.\n\nTransmit this to show the people of later ages, so that each may contemplate its meaning—take care not to obstruct or sever it. When there is joy, the virtue of the five directions emerges in full; when there is anger, the evil of the five directions emerges in full. When there is joy, the virtue of Heaven and Earth emerges in full; when there is anger, the evil of Heaven and Earth emerges in full. Thus, when Heaven and Earth are joyful, good responses emerge; when Heaven and Earth are not joyful, evil responses emerge.\n\nWhen the five directions are joyful and harmonious, good responses emerge from the five directions; when the five directions are not joyful and are angry, evil responses emerge from the five directions—this is no small matter. Therefore, it is said: do not sever it. Let all people together contemplate its meaning, all awakening to it in unison, so that the qi of joy and delight arrives and the qi of hasty anger departs. Excellent, excellent! Go forth—you have understood it.\n\nAbove: The Heavenly distinction between the good and ill fortune arising from joy and anger.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Thirteen, concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Fourteen begins.\n\n**Section One Hundred Ninety-Two**\n\n*(Preceding text lost.)* When one suffers illness and hardship, the heart aches with sorrow. Kneeling before the physician, one humbly offers filial words, serving with reverence, presenting all that the household possesses, and addressing the healer with utmost respect. The physician, seeing this, honors the person and devotes all effort to seeking true medicine—fresh, fine, and properly apportioned—so that the ailment may be known and the healer summoned to bring relief.\n\nOne constantly sheds tears, speaking to Heaven in repentance, striking one’s breast to beg for mercy, kowtowing to the earth without shunning mud or broken tiles, thereby securing the well-being of one’s parents. One teaches sons and daughters-in-law to remain always before their elders, preparing rich and delicate foods, allowing them to eat whatever they desire. One does not begrudge parents the family’s resources, nor let children and grandchildren endure hardship, but instead expends all the household possesses, cherishing a singularly filial heart in their presence.\n\nRelatives and neighbors, witnessing such filial goodness and knowing one has nothing left, come to offer provisions, summoning physicians on one’s behalf. They spread mats, laboring day and night, inquiring after the parents’ condition and care. Upon hearing even a small word of improvement, the heart rejoices—this is the result of filial devotion. Heaven, seeing such a filial heart, grants recovery, restoring health as before, and the heart is filled with joy.\n\nWhen one regains the ability to eat grain, one fasts and purifies, selling possessions to offer all to Heaven, then repays the ancestors. For every blessing received, one burns pure incense, never daring to break one’s word—this is the conduct proper to a filial child. The world may hear of such goodness yet fail to practice it; those who do act thus do so by nature’s own inclination. Heaven endows their fate, enabling filial goodness to be passed down through generations.\n\nIn managing livelihoods, one advances without encroaching on others, benefiting one’s parents. In marriages and neighborly relations, the filial receive reciprocity, never forgetting kindness—such is the excellence of this way. The years of one’s parents cannot be foreknown; one prepares in advance, reducing minor expenses to save year after year, storing surpluses in hidden places unknown even to local officials. When levies and requisitions deplete a family’s wealth, if one’s filial heart remains unfulfilled and nothing is left, and if the parents’ years come to an end without proper offerings, this would be an incomplete fulfillment of filial duty.\n\nThose who practice filial piety strive to perfect their merit. When their deeds become renowned and ascend to the highest courts, when commanderies and prefectures recommend them, and in a single day they receive honor—is this not the result of filial devotion? Their descendants inherit this legacy, perpetuating it for limitless generations. Such gratitude, never forgotten, is favored by Heaven, which dispatches good spirits to constantly guard and protect—this, too, is the result of filial piety.\n\nWithin such a household, one member may attain transcendence and long life, while later generations honor them, free from misfortune. Each lives out their years without premature death—could this be anything but goodness? From goodness, all things are accomplished, all goals achieved, all desires attained, all paths opened. Strive to practice this without slackening—such is the fortune of the good.\n\nThe filial and good are not encroached upon by others; should anyone harm them, Heaven swiftly punishes them before one’s eyes. This is knowable: to understand goodness as goodness and filial piety as filial piety, yet find it difficult to emulate, is a matter of natural disposition. Heaven grants the register of the good, and filial goodness is transmitted of itself, surpassing and elevating one another—how could there be an end to such a heart?\n\nThe good and filial are naturally revered by others, who do not offend or oppose them. Their reputation spreads to the eight distant regions, and when vacancies arise among prefectural and county officials, those who know of such filial households recommend them. Local officials, moved by human sentiment and wishing to hear of their filial goodness, send envoys to inquire. Those with discernment visit personally, learning of their conduct and recommending them. Year after year, they receive honors, wearing tokens of high virtue, their descendants inheriting the name of a \"house of transmitted filial piety,\" free from evil people.\n\nNot only do they practice filial piety at home, but it extends to all within and without. As officials, they are filial to their lord, enhancing their loyalty, and thus remain in high office, filial to the court. When commanderies and counties produce rare or counterfeit goods, they use their own wealth to purchase the finest, sparing the people from labor and corvée. Where commanderies and counties abound in kindness and filial piety, the five grains flourish, and no one dies prematurely. Heaven harmonizes wind and rain for them, ensuring timely seasons—this is the protection Heaven grants to the filial and good, sparing them from disaster.\n\nThe people follow their example, nourishing and obeying with devoted hearts, and Heaven does not oppose their will. Such goodness is supremely good, such filial loyalty supremely filial—thus it is perfected. Let the unfilial of the world emulate them, cultivating filial intent. When a great mandate pardons the world, all improper transgressions are absolved, and to the filial, the fraternal, and the diligent farmers, silks, wine, and meat are bestowed. Officials pay them respect, making their filial conduct known so that others may witness it. Those who see it, moved by sincerity, may advance in love, cherishing one another with goodwill—this is the grace Heaven bestows to guide the people in obedience.\n\nThis is the principle: goodness begets goodness, filial piety begets filial piety; lack of filial piety at the root yields lack of filial piety in the end, and evil at the root yields evil in the end. The good receive their wish for longevity, living to white-haired old age. Some reach one hundred and twenty, others over a hundred—this is the result of filial goodness, not mere empty words.\n\nNot only does Heaven love them, but the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and stars all favor them, shining upon them to keep them from encountering misfortune. Such goodness is of this magnitude—how can it not be esteemed? Among the people Heaven creates, few can be good and filial, yet those who do so alone enjoy long life and attain high office—all through the practice of filial piety.\n\nThis is not mere empty praise; thus this scripture is revealed to instruct the living. Those who wish to follow its model will be granted extended life by Heaven. It may be transmitted to descendants as a safeguard. Those who practice filial piety to transcend the world, and those who aspire to office and rank, must first fulfill filial duty.\n\nThe affairs of the world place filial piety above all else—none surpass it. Through accumulated merit and layered deeds, past and present are seamlessly linked, leaving nothing amiss. Those reborn as humans receive their parents’ grace and encounter the teachings of filial devotion. Heaven inscribes their names in the celestial registers, placing them among the deathless—such is the household of filial piety. They may ascend to the heavens, performing the work of the celestial realm, their loyalty and filial reverence recorded among all that is revered. Appointed to heavenly offices, their glory and favor grow daily, and in the heavens they are named \"Filial and Virtuous Divine Beings,\" honored by all spirits. When fine foods are sought, their filial deeds are first offered above; none compare to them. Their lifespan knows no limit, their radiance ever increasing. Above, they behold the boundless heavens; below, the boundless earth; and in their travels, they witness the boundless realms. They foresee events yet to come, and all spirits follow their commands, never opposing their will, all joining to recommend and proclaim them. The Supreme Sovereign, seeing their unmatched filial conduct, draws them near, both within and without, and the spirits hold them in ever greater reverence.\n\nThus it is said: what Heaven loves, the spirits honor; what Heaven detests, the spirits endanger. This is plain to see. The rest must each apply their own discernment, choosing what suits them best, following what is fitting.\n\nThe text pauses briefly here, yet its later teachings remain to be revealed, ensuring nothing is omitted.\n\n**The One Hundred and Ninety-Third Secret Transmission of the Nine Lords and the Supreme Sovereign**\n\nOnly the Supreme Sovereign possesses the law and order, illuminating and penetrating all, knowing all without exception, foreseeing events yet to unfold. Before the spirits speak, their intent is already known; before their forms appear, their actions are foreseen, leaving no room for deception. How could the words of the Supreme Sovereign fail to move all? Yet though people revere them, their hearts do not fully enact them—this is known, though their intent is not fully reflected.\n\nThe reason is this: the Supreme Sovereign is wholly divine, governing all that is born and transformed, all that lives and thrives. All is recorded in the divine registers, their ranks and stations clearly ordained—how could any fail to comply? Above the Nine August Ones stand the Nine Lords, who are the kin of the Supreme Sovereign. Each has their own domain, bestowing grace and favor, and all spirits follow their lead. The spirits honor their deeds, and none fail to comply. Lesser spirits, unable to grasp the intent of the Nine August Ones, how much less can worldly people?\n\nWith a sagacious mind and keen ears, one may perceive the patterns of fortune in their writings. The celestial registers, inscribed with radiant words, are etched on tablets of gold, their texts formed of silver. These records reside with the Heavenly Lord, with duplicates kept in the innermost chambers. Other documents and memorials are written on jade slips, their characters infused with spirit, their names shining with luminosity. With every utterance, illumination follows, revealing all that is known, never contradicting what is spoken.\n\nWhen divine beings and perfected ones receive the Heavenly Lord’s decrees, they fully proclaim the affairs of spirits above and below, all knowing the matters of the mortal realm. The Heavenly Lord, aware of the spirits’ words, ensures they adhere to the rules of script and measure. The natural Dao—what does it not know? What does it not transform? Its movements and actions are free from partiality.\n\nThey partake of the celestial kitchens’ fare and wear garments of pure essence—what more could they seek? Such is the conduct of the Supreme Sovereign. Great and small spirits each have their roles, all revering and respecting one another, never acting with selfishness. They follow their desires, moving with purposeful intent, knowing what can be achieved, never allowing confusion to cloud their minds, guiding each person according to their deepest wishes.\n\nThey declare: \"You have all received the immortal registers, and your lifespan shall know no end. Adorned with purple cords inscribed with gold and silver, you shall be enfeoffed as marquises with domains to govern, your intestines filled with silken brocades, gold, silver, pearls, and jade—whatever your heart desires shall be yours.\"\n\nYet this is not the path of immortals. They discern whether a person’s resolve is firm or faltering. Some are granted the semblance of beauties and jade maidens, crafted to test their composure and advantage. If their will wavers, the forms of great and small shift before them, their thoughts trailing after them, their minds fixed on posterity—this is the way of failure.\n\nSome are placed in deep mountains and vast valleys, among beasts and tigers and wolves, or in deep waters, to test their hearts. Others encounter venomous creatures, compelling them to act. Some fear ascending high mountains, entering deep valleys, or venturing into deep waters—such is the path to failure.\n\nThese trials warn the unwary, for only those with unwavering resolve and single-minded focus can withstand delusion and remain steadfast. They traverse mountains and valleys, deep and vast, waters profound and wide, their hearts unafraid. Though they encounter beauty, their will does not covet it. Though the semblances of family, great and small, seek to restrain them, they do not heed their words, holding fast to the Dao. Advancing to meet the Supreme Sovereign, they fulfill their loyalty and filial devotion without regard for lesser concerns—this is the way to success.\n\nThus we admonish the multitude, extracting the essential teachings. Heaven trusts the virtuous, allowing the immortals to deliver them. If a person is inherently good, how could Heaven deceive them? Those who are deceived harbor doubts, forcibly demanding immortality, seeking ease without merit—how could they not be deceived?\n\nHeaven cherishes life, favoring those of sincere intent and steadfast will, urging them to grasp the Three Illuminations. The Three Illuminations reside in the heart, governing the Hall of Light, channeling the radiance of the sun and moon. When the Three Illuminations attain the Dao, the heart’s resolve remains unshaken, and the records are inscribed—not to be forcibly sought.\n\nThose who ascend to heaven in broad daylight possess true essence, their nature inherently good, their hearts inherently luminous. They move with caution, their will unwavering, unmoved by wealth or profit. Their garments are coarse, barely covering their forms—such is the conduct of those who ascend to heaven.\n\nHeaven cherishes their goodness, sending benevolent spirits to guard and protect them, shielding them from harm. The celestial spirits love them, ensuring the completion of their merit. Such is the result of their own conduct. They do not covet worldly affairs or amass wealth, and thus their deeds are perfected.\n\nThe heavens recognize their utmost sincerity, recording their names in the celestial ledgers as true beings, each accompanied by a benevolent star. From the moment of their birth and the hour of their arrival, they refrain from evil, and the heavens further favor them, transforming their greed to aid the Heavenly Lord in governing the celestial documents, ensuring their clarity and unobstructed flow, their actions free from selfish concealment.\n\nTheir years of conduct are witnessed, their names inscribed in the honored registers of the living, aligning with the will of the Most High. They can articulate their merits and deeds, assisting where others fall short—such individuals are rightfully cherished and protected by the spirits. The heavens trust those who are filial, sincere, and whose conduct is without blemish or flaw. Thus, they are met with celestial escorts in broad daylight, their arrival and departure resplendent, visible to all people, their merit complete, inspiring others to witness goodness.\n\nAmong those who ascend in daylight, not one in a million attains this. Those who do are greatly trusted and safeguarded by the celestial deities. Others cannot compare to those who achieve liberation through *shijie*; even among millions, only one emerges. Though their merits vary in magnitude, they recommend and elevate one another, and such individuals are deeply cherished by the heavens.\n\nWithin, they gain the trust of the Most High, who recommends them as proven and faithful, each achieving their merit and renown—could this be anything but good? When the Heavenly Lord issues decrees, the spirits do not distort his words. The Heavenly Lord, having witnessed their faithfulness, knows what is yet to come, allowing not even a hair’s breadth of deceit. All are granted extended lifespans, even those who achieve minor liberation later. If their thoughts or words remain incomplete, they continue to contemplate the Dao.\n\n**Admonition One Hundred Ninety-Four: The Unfilial Cannot Long Endure**\nFrom ancient times to the present, the world has rarely met expectations. If one seeks only self-satisfaction, refusing loyal service to affairs...\n\nThose who speak and teach delight in nothing extraordinary; when they see others doing good, they smile and speak—yet what benefit does this bring? Their words are careless and reckless, deceiving even father and son. They turn away in silence, then speak behind others’ backs, whether of good or ill, setting no standard to follow, offering no benefit to the world. The world is but dust and grime, where speech stirs on its own, and none respond to virtuous writings. Though their hearts claim goodness, their conduct does not match; lacking steadfastness, their words drift and sink, unworthy of trust. Such are the reckless—how can they endure long? They cannot be equated with those of good heart and resolve.\n\nThose who seek life and dread death wish not to see such wicked men, yet fail to recognize their own nature, boasting of their strength and few who can surpass them. Instead, they lie in wait day and night to seize wealth without righteousness, avoiding toil to obtain it, believing they may long abide in harmony, speaking among others. Yet those beside them see through them and reproach their words. The spirits, hearing and observing their deeds and movements, know their hearts’ wickedness and that their goodness cannot last. They report to the heavenly gods: \"Within the harmony of the Dao, there is one of reckless speech and careless words, whose goodness cannot endure. In but a moment, their evil words reappear, devoid of trust or proof. They only engage in flattery and deceit—what benefit do they bring to others?\"\n\nThey are granted the grains to eat and silks and cloth to wear, changing garments with winter and summer, seeking food to please the palate and clothes to please the body. Though the market offers profitable gain, they refuse to seek it, yet claim to support aged parents. At dawn, they rise from bed, not knowing where they go. They peddle all they possess, shifting between host and guest, lounging in taverns with legs splayed, jesting and laughing, singing and dancing, making merry, boasting of their vigor. They whisper among themselves, spreading gossip and slander. When their wealth is exhausted and nothing remains to sustain them, they band together in wrongdoing, becoming wicked men beyond restraint. How could they find even half a day of goodness? Their actions bring no benefit to the household, only sorrow and poison to parents, siblings, wives, and children, who must ever bear this grief without relief.\n\nTheir plundering and theft know no end; though they see their hair turn white, they remain unaware that the spirits sent by Heaven stand at their side, enter their bodies, and hasten their deeds. They are made to meet misfortune, their years cut short, for their clamor of evil cannot be stilled. When their crimes reach the authorities, they are seized and lawfully punished, their lives not spared. Compared to death, how can they live again? Or they may be harmed by ghosts and spirits.\n\nParents ever think of them, seeing only their solitary tears and lonely vigil, with none to aid or support. In old age, they are cast aside, their food foul and meager, rarely tasting anything rich or fine. Their clothes and shoes are threadbare, with none to mend them. Such is the extremity of evil—years and months pass, days stretch empty and long, their faces grow hideous, bearing no semblance to human countenance.\n\nAs sons of this kind, they leave their parents in old age with no one to rely upon; even kin refuse to acknowledge them. This is the conduct of the wicked, whose offenses rise to the heavens. Their kin suffer for them, their names shrouded in disgrace. When such a son dies, no burial is seen, no shroud or coffin provided—he is simply interred. Foxes and jackals devour him, his bones cast upon the wilds. When shall he again know the comforts of clothing and food?\n\nThus are the deeds of good and evil made plain: men bring these fates upon themselves. Whom can they blame? How profoundly foolish are the people of the world, failing to weigh the vast gulf between life and death! While alive, they possess the breath of life, behold the radiance of heaven and earth, sun and moon, and stars. But in death, shall they again know the brightness of heaven? In the depths of darkness, when shall light return?\n\nFools do not ponder deeply, bringing calamity upon their descendants, disasters beyond remedy, misfortunes that flow to later generations. Whose fault is this? If men do not reform, they forfeit their years—should they not then emulate the conduct of the virtuous and the immortal? In every action and word, let there be discipline, bringing benefit to parents, ensuring their well-being, their food rich, their clothes fine, their faces aglow with vitality.\n\nSuch is the filial son’s conduct, his strength not that of the wicked. Ought he not alone repay his parents’ nurturing care? To be an unfilial son—when you have children, will they be filial? Good begets good, evil begets evil, as a mirror reflects a man. Do you not know your own nature?\n\nThus the records of good and evil share the same script, yet the span of life or its absence—how vast the difference! A living man’s years are numbered; when his allotted time is spent, he becomes a ghost, no longer subject to inquiry. The wicked die young, and in the underworld, they are seized and interrogated, held to account for their misdeeds. They endure suffering without respite, never knowing joy. As ghosts, when shall they find pardon?\n\nSuch is the extremity of evil: even as ghosts, they remain wicked, with nowhere to turn. Those without sustenance at home take to begging, chasing the fleeting breath of the fugitive, their days numbered. The underworld, too, desires good spirits, not the wicked. Thus, let each reflect upon goodness, not transgressing the proper measure—this alone suffices. Otherwise, what hope remains?\n\nMen should share a common purpose, aligning their wishes with life. Does Heaven favor the unvirtuous? Why then do they persist in evil? The wicked cannot long endure beneath the gaze of heaven and earth, sun and moon, and stars. Thus are they hidden away in the underworld, denied the company of good spirits, bereft of joy or distinction.\n\nWhere the text repeats itself, it is to earnestly detest the wicked and deny them long life. The virtuous, favored by Heaven, beget descendants who are likewise good. Day by day, they encounter no taboos, their lives aligned with the moon’s phases and the radiance of sun, moon, and stars. For those born thus, what fear of not attaining long life? Such is the reward of virtuous conduct.\n\nIn the contemplation of good and evil, let each follow what brings peace. Heaven does not oppose men’s actions. Ponder again and again, reflect deeply—whether to advance or retreat, those who do not cling to life have no recourse. The words of this text are clear; doubt them not.\n\nLet not suffering reach its extremity. Be mindful of life, never slackening, and heed these words with care. Though the discourse pauses briefly, let its lessons linger. If any point remains unclear, reconsider it.\n\n**Admonition Against Transgressing Evil Precepts, One Hundred and Ninety-Five**\n\nOf those endowed with sagely virtue, each has their say, each their discourse. Each distinguishes their abilities, ranks their merits, and fulfills what is fitting, so that trust may be placed in them, and Heaven’s words revered. Heaven loves mankind and bestows great merit, winning the heart of Heaven—this is the aspiration of sagely virtue.\n\nAll men wish to align with Heaven, to grasp its intent, without complaint. Thus, let each follow their resolve, avoiding baseless words, for this is to gain the people’s favor, ensuring their trust and shared understanding, adhering to what is proper.\n\nTo dwell in the world is no easy matter. In every action, one must heed what is said, never straying from the established bounds, nor blaming others while shirking self-reproach. Such is the conduct of inequity. Each harbors grievances, provoking Heaven’s wrath and displeasure, declaring that life and fate are inconstant.\n\nThus, there are those in the world of sagely and harmonious hearts who speak their intent, revealing the origins of transgressions, urging each to reform. For the span of a man’s life arises from within, not from others. Hence, it is said that the Controller of Fate resides near, within the heart, not far from man, overseeing right and wrong. At every fault, it withdraws, and how can there be no loss of time, no shortening of years?\n\nKnowing the unvirtuous, it desires that they heed its warnings, finding peace. In moments of fault, let them reflect, lest they incur punishment and forfeit their years, harboring no resentment. Heaven is vastly forbearing and patient, not meting out punishment in a single day. Only when transgressions accumulate excessively does it dispatch the underworld’s officials to seize the soul, interrogate its deeds, and find them discordant with Heaven’s pattern. Deceit follows deceit, and the confession of faults brings unpardonable sin.\n\nThus, it again commands clear admonitions, explaining how evil conduct invites calamity, urging reform. If its words are ignored, how can one long remain among the living? Therefore, it distinguishes good and evil, ensuring no grievances arise. Heaven sets prohibitions to prevent transgression. Yet men deliberately violate them, defying the commands of Heaven’s spirits. How can they long endure among men?\n\nThus, the distinction between good and evil is made, so that none may complain. Heaven establishes prohibitions to prevent their breach. Yet men willfully transgress—let them be warned by the gods. Can they long remain among the living?\n\nActing thus—can this be the Way to keep men from death? Does the Central Heaven remain unaware? The conduct of common folk cannot be thus adopted. How can they long abide within the harmony of the Center, partaking of what is edible? Yet they turn against the protection of the good spirits, and their years end in exhaustion. When the time of the Central Heaven’s people arrives, this is the proof of goodness. If one does good day after day, why fear not living out one’s full span? Thus, it is known that men cannot strive to do good but harm themselves. How much worse are the evil, who believe they may long share the same fate? Unaware, the gods of Heaven hasten them downward into the earth. Once beneath the soil, when shall they be reborn? Below, they are drawn ever deeper, their corpses dissolving—such are those who receive no Heavenly blessing. Can they still be reckoned among the living?\n\nLet each consider his own conduct and not add to the suffering of later lives—this is the mark of one who is moderately good. Otherwise, one becomes an evil person, unsupported by Heaven, unbearable to Earth. One must be cautious, avoid faults and debts, and thus be counted among men. One may then be a father or mother to one’s children and grandchildren, continuing the bestowal of kindness, and in turn gain added years, with vital essence flourishing, qi and strength robust—all the result of good conduct. Evil naturally declines; what room is there for doubt?\n\nFrom this day forward, one must carefully weigh and discern, distinguishing good from evil, and reflect on which path to follow. Then one may abide in peace, for Heaven does not oppose what men do. Yet if one ponders and ponders again, acting contrary to what is right while seeking long life—can such conduct long be seen by the gods of Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars? Will they willingly shine upon it? Though protected by the gods of Heaven, one strives to endanger oneself—whose fault is this? Should this not be the conduct of one who is good and filial? Such a person attains rank and emolument, is fed by the Minister of Agriculture, and long governs the people, ensuring that superiors and inferiors serve one another—this is the noblest of men. Such is the result of goodness; evil cannot preserve the body. How great is the difference?\n\nObserve this text and its admonitions. To disregard its words and act as one pleases—is this not to act against humanity? If one has evil and cannot reform, yet possesses filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trust, and expects Heaven’s reward; if one falls ill and seeks healing, but has committed too many evil deeds with no time for repentance—can one long be spared? Thus, this text is written to ensure that common folk do not complain when they receive punishment.\n\nLet those who wish to live reflect: if one does not commit evil, one will not forfeit one’s years. Having received this text and its warnings, one should know how to avoid transgressions and not incur evil. If one can reform and do good, one may long behold Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and be equal to others—is this not goodness? Yet some disregard their lives, believing that death allows rebirth. As if one who does not know one’s own evil could deem it acceptable! They wish to be equal to others in speech, clothing, and food—can this last long?\n\nThose who fear death dare not violate these admonitions, and this too is the result of their allotted fate. If a person is even slightly decent, one should straightforwardly fulfill one’s destined duty—what is there to hesitate over? Let each be cautious and strive, reflecting on the safety or peril of one’s actions. The admonitions in this text are self-evident.\n\nThe Heavenly text desires men to do good and does not wish to hear of their evil. Thus, the register of life is not complete—there is no great mystery in this. Reflect carefully and do not grow lax. Heaven has a register of the living, which may be coveted; Earth has a register of the dead, which is most detestable. Between life and death, there is no comparison—does one not understand this? Knowing evil, one must be cautious and examine oneself. One must not for a moment lose one’s years and lifespan—how lamentable this would be!\n\nWhen speaking with others, let one’s words and voice win their hearts by doing good. Heaven favors this; let no evil words escape, lest one bring blame upon oneself. Since all share the same breath, one must choose words carefully before uttering them. Not even a single unkind word should be spoken, that one may prolong one’s life. Those who can ponder and practice the affairs of Heaven may obtain the essential words of the Heavenly gods. By heeding their admonitions and acting with reflection, one may alter one’s life register and be transferred to the bureau of long life.\n\nOne should cultivate oneself and rectify one’s conduct, never forgetting Heaven’s bestowals. One should set one’s heart on repaying this great kindness, making it easy to reform one’s aspirations. Heaven, in turn, will remember and ensure one does not encounter evil. One may trust the words of the Heavenly text and attain governance without strife.\n\nThe text’s words are not complete; one should select what is practicable and act accordingly, not forcing what one cannot do. Let each reflect on the good and evil of one’s own conduct. Heaven endows one’s nature—let there be no doubt. One should not deceive the good, nor should evil people obtain blessings. These words are clear—what room is there for doubt?\n\nThose who become immortals do not commit evil; each cherishes their life—this is the proof of goodness. The text’s words are concise, reiterating the wishes of Daoists past and present. It speaks of the good and evil of the Way, urging reflection. If one does not heed it, the fault is one’s own. Those who complain should know that their complaint stems from their own lack of understanding, which leads to poverty and old age, and ultimately to self-blame.\n\nThe rest is left to one’s own will. If one desires to cherish life, one should not commit evil. Thus, one must reflect and know suffering and joy. Whose joy is it? Whose suffering? One must also reflect on this and not utter complaints or reckless words. Let one think carefully and think of doing good—this is why these earnest words are spoken.\n\nLet one’s words be known and not transgress Heaven’s rules. By perfecting the natural Way, what cannot be accomplished? What cannot be transformed? All will welcome it—is this not the natural grace of Heaven?\n\nConsider the foolish below who do not reflect on receiving Heaven’s great share, being born as humans, and believing they will long endure.\n\nYet one does not expect that there are divine spirits of shamans—one must cease and not offend them. The written admonitions are not few; they emerge again upon reflection. The texts bear duplicates, hence the repeated warnings. Regard those who do not heed the writings: let them reflect on doing good, for there is hope in living. Those who speak wicked and disobedient words are recorded without end. Be cautious and desist; desist and still reflect—reflect afterward on what is lacking, and if unsatisfied, expound further.\n\n**Incantation One Hundred Ninety-Six**\nNow, the people of the world each disobey filial piety, turning to rebellion and treachery, competing in disloyal and faithless deeds. They reverse the principle of requiting kindness, believing themselves to have become fully human and to endure long upon the earth. In all they say and teach, there is never the slightest good, only wicked words. Yet they constantly harbor ingratitude and refuse to bestow mercy, acting solely for their own satisfaction, never considering that suffering will follow their words. Such persons do not belong in this world; they ought not to have even a little trust. Stubbornly foolish, they believe they have won the hearts of others. Their spoken thoughts cannot be adopted, nor can they serve as models. Without fear or restraint, they commit transgressions and offenses, acting as they please, reckless of their lives, blind to long-term preservation. In their comings and goings, they do not repay their parents, nor do they attend to them morning and night, treating them as barbarians. Who are these people? From whom were they born? They slight their kin, neglecting food and drink, never understanding the Way. They are no better than the six livestock, with no fixed term for life or death. Their mouths crave fine flavors, their bodies fine clothing—does Heaven intend to let them live long? Their conduct cannot be followed. If they perish, will their deeds be of use? They provoke Heaven’s wrath, leaving no time for joy. Should Heaven cherish their lives and spare them from death? All they do is offensive and improper, yet they persist—this is self-seeking, as if they wish to avoid the sight of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, stars, and all living beings.\n\nHeaven’s admonitory texts clearly expound good and evil. If one does not believe these words, what recourse is there? Does one wish to live long and breathe freely? Are they not inferior even to the six livestock, birds, and beasts, which possess some understanding? Such extreme folly—how can one rely on the mysterious? They act frivolously, squandering all their wealth, engaging in reckless behavior that invites punishment, devoid of reason. From year to year, they neglect their households, wandering and playing, utterly unaware of restraint. Their thoughts never arise from proper measure, and so they cannot endure. These people owe their lives to their parents, yet their conduct lacks all righteousness. They show no loyalty or filial piety, no obedience, only rebellion. Should Heaven preserve them, allowing their eyes to blink and their breath to continue? Even in death, their transgressions remain, extending to their unborn children. Consider those who bring calamity: though they commit evil in life and die prematurely, they cut short the lives of those not yet born. Their hope of living as ghosts, then dying again, is insufficient to atone—is this not the result of their wickedness? How can they expect to live freely? If those born now resent their faults, why do they speak recklessly and act so arrogantly?\n\nWhy do the people of the world not reflect on themselves and reduce their transgressions? What benefit do accumulated faults bring to one’s body? They only shorten human life—should this not be considered? Why do they invite disaster upon themselves? This is plain to see. Those who dwell in the world, practicing filial piety and goodness, attain longevity, their descendants continuing in succession. They witness honorable offices and generous emoluments—is this not the result of doing good and being filial? Those who lack goodness and disregard future suffering are the most rebellious and wicked, beyond comparison, never ceasing. When your parents gave birth to you, did they wish to hear your goodness, or would they rather hear evil words, even in their old age? Siblings who resent one another never know joy. Each blames the other for their faults, yet they persist in their own ways, refusing to do good. Such conduct cannot last. It benefits neither Heaven nor Earth, neither people nor the four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, or stars. Such people are utterly wicked—what do they hope for? Should they not look up in reverence? Do they believe Heaven does not dispatch malevolent spirits to oversee their transgressions? They should not be surprised: in all they seek and do, there is nothing to rely upon. Day by day, they face decline, illness, and unending death—why would Heaven delight in killing them? The multitude says: “You have no understanding; in an instant, they are slain.” Or they may encounter the authorities, their wealth and property exhausted, their grievances and misfortunes continuing—is this not the result of their own conduct? Why blame Heaven and cry out in resentment?\n\nThe common people are thus: they wish to offend Heaven—what benefit is there in self-justification? Those who long evade sacrifices owe debts to the spirit officials, refusing to make amends. These debts should be resolved. Always in the third month of spring, on an auspicious day, perform the resolution. Three resolutions may reduce the written records, for spirit officials do not delight in heavily punishing people. Yet if documents persist, with superiors and inferiors shifting blame, how can the words of the common people—who cease when impoverished and do not complete their deeds—be heeded?\n\nIn life, all consume tangible things; in death, they should consume qi, yet they do not. Ancestors say that bearing children is for the time after death. Once they attain the consumption of qi, they join their peers and no longer consume one another. If children are born thus, how can you expect your descendants to care for you long? Your life will also end, like those who have gone before. When hunger strikes, what will you gain? In the heavenly offices, great filial piety is required. Sacrifices must be performed clearly—how can there be doubt? For three years after death, before burial, one must offer prayers and thanksgiving. One cannot say, “There are unburied dead on earth, yet no sacrifices are made.” Not eating increases transgressions and faults, harming descendants. This is plain to see—sacrifices must be performed.\n\nThose who were wealthy in life indulged in extravagance, slaughtering cattle, sheep, pigs, and the six livestock for sacrifices. The officials gradually grew distant, and later, they faced reproach, heedless of poverty.\n\nWealth and property cannot be swiftly acquired, yet conduct remains unworthy—refusing to return what is due, sacrifices cease for long. How can reproach be swiftly resolved? One ought to frequently acknowledge debts and transgressions; only then may goodness follow, and descendants surely live long. Heaven delights in those who confess their faults first. For impoverished households that, knowing the taste of grain, gather to kowtow and strike their breasts in repentance, lifting their faces to thank Heaven—Heaven pities their hardship, and the sacrificial officials lend them means, allowing modest offerings. This is what Heaven grants; though one may possess only modest wealth, one must perform sacrifices without doubt. To fail in this is to meet one’s ancestors at the assembly of spirits, where the sacrificial officials reproach the neglect. Ghosts are sent to guard the home, and illness afflicts the living without end. The ancestors, bound and confined, cannot be consulted through divination; when the proper day arrives, one must act. Heaven’s granted respite expires—failure is not without consequence. One must thank Heaven and Earth, summon the bodily form into the earth, while the hun-soul is examined in the celestial prison, where transgressions are weighed in turn, and death follows in succession. The fault is too grave, thus this text is sent down so that all may know to accept Heaven’s punishment without resentment. Let them warn one another, that none may transgress again. Ancient records exist, yet offenders never cease. For those whose coffins remain unburied, sacrifices must not be neglected. Now this text is extended once more, for those of sincere heart to read and comprehend its meaning. Doubt not its words—still one may be inscribed in the register of the living. To doubt and fail to act is to fix the day of death. Reflect upon this; do not blame Heaven or fault the Earth.\n\nProceed, and let this text rest briefly in your thoughts. Thereafter, ponder its words, understand what must be done, and return to the Dao.\n\n**Heaven’s Faithful Retribution: Divine Formula One Hundred Ninety-Seven**\n\nOnly those who advance in goodness and seek life, who delight in repaying Heaven’s will, may extend their years from the present. Those who witness Heaven’s workings above say: “I too shall follow what Heaven transforms and accomplishes.” When they see the scriptures of long life, their forms and countenances change, their essence and spirit flourish, their radiance increases daily, without cease. Such are those of sincere and virtuous intent, who never forget Heaven’s grace. Those who repay kindness—when would they ever resent? Even in moments of rest, their hearts reproach themselves, grateful to have been born human and to rely upon Heaven’s completion. They come to know Heaven’s prohibitions, shunning harm and pursuing goodness, never opposing the divine. Seeing goodness, they follow it, never failing to reproach themselves and repent, turning toward rectitude. They ponder its meaning, never daring to grow complacent or doubtful. In their resolve to do good, they awaken to Heaven’s will, understanding it fully—no doubt remains. Reproaching themselves and repenting, days accumulate; having received blessings and protection, they uphold Heaven’s transformation, spared from peril. Knowing they receive Heaven’s recompense, how could they forget even for a moment? They fear the divine may reproach their words, thus they remain disquieted, never at ease. Driven by the desire to advance, they strive to fulfill Heaven’s will, fearing any lapse. Thus they purify their hearts and reform their conduct, moving the powers above, yearning for ascension and coveting life. Truly, they dread the term of short life, fearing prolonged absence from Heaven and Earth. They exhaust their strength and devote their loyalty, pondering their sincerity. Having heard the words of the divine many times yet never seen their forms, their hearts cannot rest, ever reverent and fearful, anxious day and night, never daring to grow complacent. For this reason, they dare not abandon goodness for evil deeds.\n\nAll people receive food and drink, inhaling Heaven’s primordial qi, allowing them to breathe. Knowing human sentiment, they understand they receive Heaven’s grace and must repay it—when would there be doubt? Heaven engenders the essence of humanity; Earth nurtures their form, allowing them to grow and mature. Seeing Heaven’s admonitions and reading its words, they tremble without fear, how could they speak in defiance? Their hearts ever quake—when would they know peace? Only the great divine, in timely mercy, repeatedly grants leniency, though they know they cannot repay such great kindness in full. Only the great divine, in boundless compassion, allows them to remain long within the qi of life, extending the years of their allotted span. They dare not forget the measure of great grace, nor the fullness of its bestowal, never daring to slacken even for a moment, nor betray its favor. Only the great divine completes them, allowing them to see the celestial spirits and converse with them, longing to hear further admonitions. They hold Heaven’s words in reverence, and only when they receive its response do they dare trust. The great divine responds to the words of the virtuous: the Heavenly Lord ever cherishes those of sincere and good heart, advancing them when they prove useful to Heaven.\n\nFrom now on, those of sincere and virtuous heart may present themselves and report to the Heavenly Lord, who will heed and employ their offerings without doubt. Surely it shall be as previously stated—this is what the Heavenly Lord dares to affirm. As the years and months draw near, strive to trust Heaven’s words. Heaven too trusts those of sincere and virtuous heart, who no longer dwell among the common. Their names are recorded in the celestial register, among those who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight—this covenant is not deceitful. The Heavenly Lord desires to advance the good, those of sincere heart who do not defy His words—such are the ones. The great spirits, from afar, witness their conduct. Though their households may lack for a time, as previously stated, they need not worry. Let them constantly reflect that they shall stand before the spirits of Heaven above—this is the result of goodness, and they must not grow weary.\n\nThose of sincere and virtuous heart say: “In life, I am no ascendant being, yet I resolve to repay the great divine, seeking advancement and coveting life. I exhaust all I know—how dare I hope for ascension in broad daylight?” When selected, they are deemed worthy, yet in life, they dare not presume. They fear being reproached by the great divine, yet by grace, they are fortunate to receive favor, their allotted measure of grace fulfilled. They regret only that they have not yet repaid it in full, and pray the great divine may grant them respite to recover. Hearing the great divine’s words, they compare their former intentions with their present resolve, advancing them to the Heavenly Lord, who declares: “This is one of sincere and virtuous intent.” The Heavenly Lord desires to draw near them, allowing no doubt.\n\nThe bestowal of grace does not lie with the great divine—why then speak of repayment? Rather, one ought to clarify what one knows, ensuring that there is indeed a sign of reciprocation, and simply offer sincere gratitude with a pained heart. Thus shall the gods protect them, allowing no malevolent spirits to interfere. Be ever cautious in speech, making goodness the foremost topic, and inscribe words with trust as their bond, so as not to betray those of sincere and virtuous intent. Day and night, Heaven itself commands the divine generals to guard them, leaving no room for doubt. As for writings that command or obstruct, let them first be borne by those who inherit past burdens, and do not take them as cause for worry.\n\nThose of sincere and virtuous resolve say: “By nature, I am humble and lowly, long mired in the mundane world. I fear I cannot extricate myself from its midst, yet I yearn for the favor and kindness of the great divine, moved by their warmth and sincerity to recognize my own worth. Only when the great divine reports to the Heavenly Lord am I placed among the ranks of the undying—how then dare I hope for ascension in broad daylight?” The great divine replies: “The Heavenly Lord trusts those of sincere intent who advance in virtue. His decree admits no double promise, no room for doubt—this is the will of the Heavenly Lord himself. Though you may worry over your family’s insufficiency, with hunger and cold pressing upon you, Heaven’s kitchen is ever at hand. Simply look upward to accomplish the task, and the gods will themselves instruct your children—cast aside such concerns. After receiving your allotted measure, how could you ever forget the words of the great divine? Your only fear is that you may fail. You dare not neglect the great divine’s pillow and mat, keeping them ever in your heart and breast, never slackening.”\n\nSuch are the words of the great divine. The Heavenly Lord, who knows all, deems that goodness naturally attains goodness, and sincerity naturally wins the Heavenly Lord’s favor. When the matter was previously presented to the Heavenly Lord, he commanded the great divine: “As I have already stated, the day this person is to ascend must not be missed. Let no delay occur. The tally is already set within their heart, and the gods, seeing clearly, speak in confirmation. Transformation will come on the appointed day—only remain steadfast in thought day and night.” The disciple replies: “After receiving such a decree, how dare I slacken? Will I truly be made whole?” The great divine says: “You must inscribe the tally, and it will be seen for yourself. Have no fear of failing to attain heavenly longevity. It is not only the great divine who speaks thus—all the gods affirm that this is a person of sincere heart, and all the gods are concerned for them. Simply look upward to accomplish the task.”\n\nThe disciple says: “Such a weighty matter—if it comes to pass as wished, I shall only humble myself in reverence.” The great divine replies: “This is also the wish of such a person. One ought to respond with a sincere heart. The Heavenly Lord values their family, ensuring they do not fall into grave transgression. The burdens they bear shall be resolved—do not trust the words of spirit-mediums or diviners, for their divinations can neither add nor subtract. Those who seek to deliver and enliven others must rely on the true gods. Even if lesser spirits are negligent, the higher powers will resolve it—do not act recklessly in ways that are improper. This is known to those of sincere heart who walk the Dao.”\n\nEach must consider their own path, trust in Heaven’s words, for Heaven does not deceive those of sincere intent who advance in virtue. Though you may know kindness and constantly reflect upon it, never forgetting for a moment, beware: when malevolent spirits descend from below, those without resolve, who fail to guard themselves and indulge in reckless thoughts, will be cast down, unsettled, and their endeavors may come to naught. This scripture does not trust the wicked, nor do the wicked trust this scripture. Only when efficacy is demonstrated and reciprocation is received can it be truly known. Now, you must have faith in the writings of those who advance in virtue, for the gods themselves desire to see the sign of reciprocation. Those who lack sincere intent to advance in virtue will find nothing. The words of this scripture are already clear—when the sign is seen and verified, it will not be long.\n\nHow is this made evident? For those who delight in life, Heaven causes them to rejoice—this is Heaven’s sign of reciprocation. Such a person will surely transform into a divine being, ascending in broad daylight without doubt. Day by day, they grow lighter, their food intake diminishes, and their essence and radiance become ever more refined. Day by day, they draw nearer to the gods—this is the sign, the clearest of proofs. Have no doubt.”\n\nThe disciple says: “Having received your admonition and decree, I shall follow your words, reflecting upon and bearing them in mind, never slackening or forgetting.” Though I was once ignorant, after our meeting, I have grown ever closer, as if no different. The great divine says: “Excellent, excellent. You shall indeed be favored to succeed. Your name is fitting, and you shall complete the work—this is the constant admonition of the gods. Though the scripture’s words are many, they are weighty for the sake of the Way of life. Do not be alarmed, for the words will soon come to an end. Each has more to say to those of sincere intent and reflection.”\n\n“Yes, yes. I dare not forget.”\n\n**Decree on Advancing the Method, One Hundred and Ninety-Eighth**\n\nReflect upon the people of great sincerity and trust from ancient times to the present, each demonstrating efficacy and accumulating merit before Heaven, thus daring to step forward. In their actions and retreats, they have never committed even the slightest transgression. They constantly harbor compassion and benevolence, bestowing kindness and favor to benefit the multitude. They do not lose even the smallest trust, nor do they fail to revere Heaven and Earth, following the guidance of the four seasons and the five phases, aiding in the generation and completion of all things. They dare not harbor any intention of failure that would endanger themselves and bring instability. Thus, they examine their own transgressions and burdens, fearing they may not be resolved, and that the multitude of gods will record them, reporting them to the Most High.\n\nFor this reason, they dare to rest in peace. From ancient times to the present, goodness and evil flow in succession—when has there ever been an end? Therefore, they remain composed and tranquil, never slackening or forgetting Heaven’s works. Those who seek virtue reflect within their own hearts. When they see others with good hearts, they rejoice; when they see others with evil hearts, they are alarmed. They imagine the heavenly gods knowing all, each advancing in their own way. They further reflect: “Originally, I was born in the mundane world, yet my heart constantly yearns for the great transformation, coveting the Way of life and departing from the realm of death. I cherish the essence and radiance, desiring them to remain within me, so that I may love myself and my heart may be at peace. Otherwise, I fear I will not be among those who are constantly seen.”\n\nOnly the gods of Heaven, in their timely mercy, instruct them in advancement and retreat, aligning with Heaven’s will. They must not commit even the slightest transgression, lest it be heard by the Lord of the Most High.\n\nThus, through the gods they seek broad inquiry, and only by not opposing them do they avoid suspicion. Having received a single portion of destiny, they dare not forget it even for a moment. They only reflect upon their words, contemplating the heavenly admonitions to perfect themselves and avoid peril. This is the day of the gods’ favor and grace, and they dare not rest, nor fail to reflect upon repaying this profound kindness.\n\nBefore the gods have reported to the Heavenly Lord, they learn of the dispatch and the attending gods who bear the decree. When these individuals speak or act, how can their intentions be fully questioned? The gods inquire of them, then report back: “The people of harmony and equilibrium, who cultivate goodness and accumulate merit over time, covet long life. They humbly declare their constant vigilance, fearing faults or debts, never slackening in their devotion. The gods recount their merits and effects.”\n\nThe gods then confer among themselves: “This person of merit and virtue, who reflects within the state of harmony, seeks to repay Heaven’s great kindness. Having long accumulated good deeds, they wish to declare their merits through the gods, yet harbor doubts and dare not advance to report to the Heavenly Lord. They have long entrusted themselves to the gods’ trust, having rendered service to Heaven. Those with merit should be advanced.” Yet the gods observe their conduct over time and wonder why they have not reported it.\n\nThe gods, filled with apprehension, say: “Originally, we did not know this person’s arrival, and fear they may not be entirely sincere.” They deliberate on their intentions, unaware whether the Heavenly Lord has heard of them. The gods, lacking resolve, see a meritorious person yet fail to report them to the messengers of the Way. They dispatch spirits to examine their accumulated deeds, finding great merit. The gods, thus without excuse, have no merits of their own, yet share an external mindset, assuming the Heavenly Lord remains unaware.\n\nThe gods offer their explanations, asking: “What use is there in this? Is it merely for gain? Can we each be at ease?” They thank the gods, acknowledging their duties, removing their crowns in apology: “We minor spirits, in our official roles, have fully devoted our loyal hearts, yet are questioned for our inexcusable faults, awaiting death at the gate.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord issues a decree: “Wait outside.” He commands the gods to prostrate themselves, standing in peril as they attend. The decree instructs: “The Heavenly Lord does not wish to harm the gods, nor yet bears to inflict injury. They are to be exiled to the land of harmony and equilibrium, in the capital of Luoyang for ten years, selling medicine to cure the sick without accepting excessive payment. After the exile, those of higher rank shall serve in the Hearing Bureau for one year, and only upon merit shall they be restored.”\n\nThus, the gods, seeing the Heavenly Lord pardon their capital offense and impose only a light exile, truly recognize their transgressions. Humbled and broken, they had not hoped to live, nor borne any intent of harm. They again offer their service to the Heavenly Lord, saying: “We inform the clerks of the Bureau and descend without delay, dispatching spirits to observe and report.”\n\nThe Bureau reports and dispatches them as the Heavenly Lord commands. The Heavenly Lord instructs the clerks to inform the great gods, reviewing their documents and ordering one god to inspect them. The clerks transmit the documents to the great gods and their subordinates, each fulfilling their duties. When they see those who covet advancement through merit and goodness, they are to present them, reporting all matters clearly.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructs the great gods: “Swiftly observe this person and question the dispatched spirits to see if their accounts align.” The great gods reply: “We were sent to observe this person, reviewing their days and merits, and report back. As instructed, we observed the meritorious in harmony and reported as the spirits declared.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “Such a person of merit, yet those under the gods’ charge failed to report them to the Heavenly Lord in a timely manner—was this not negligence? Having received a light exile in the land of harmony, let this serve as a warning henceforth. Those who fail to report merit shall be punished upon the Heavenly Lord’s hearing, bearing their own exile. Each must attend to their duties. Dispatch spirits to guide and transform them, that they may become gods and augment their essence and radiance. Review the registers, and for those not yet recorded, inscribe their names.”\n\nThe great gods receive the decree and return to the Bureau, examining the registers for the names. They report to the Bureau: “The documents list this person. We request to consult the Heavenly Lord’s internal registers to verify alignment.” The Heavenly Lord produces the documents and reviews them, finding them consistent with the external records. He then instructs the great gods: “Verify whether their term is complete and report back for careful review.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord asks the great gods: “Did you not fully observe them, yet now request another review?” The great gods apologize for their duties, and the Heavenly Lord says: “Hasten the review and return swiftly.” The great gods then verify that the person’s term is complete. Their failure to report, being inexcusable, incurs guilt, and they await execution.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “For now, restore their rank and duties, but do not slacken.” He summons the person to ascend, cautioning them not to neglect their minor duties, knowing how to accumulate merit. “Yes, yes,” they reply, requesting to follow the Heavenly Lord’s decree. “So be it.”\n\nThe great gods then appoint the person to a minor post, observing their conduct. As the days and months are yet few, they request further verification of their sincerity. If their merits are great and their trustworthiness genuine, any deficiencies shall be filled by their appointment.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “Heed what the great gods have reported and do not slacken.” The great gods reply: “Yes, yes. We request to dispatch spirits to observe and report.” The Heavenly Lord approves.\n\n*Text incomplete: Section 199, \"Without Written Decree, the Mandate is Not Fully Concluded\"*\n\nOnly in Heaven do the sagely and enlightened possess offices and duties, each exhausting their loyalty and conduct, never failing their superiors. Each exerts their strength, and in their actions, never lose intent. They foreknow the Heavenly Lord’s decrees, ever inclining their ears to listen, desiring to grasp his will. They constantly review the documents of the Storage Bureau, distinguishing what must be known. When the Lord summons, there is no fixed time, and they dare not act privately. Only in official matters do they proceed, first reporting their intentions before daring to depart.\n\nWherever their circuit extends, wherever their reach encompasses, upon receiving the decree they proceed to inspect, never daring to linger even for a moment. Only after fulfilling their private duties do they dare speak, sincerely returning to their charge, never presuming to act on private matters beyond their station. They preserve the mandate in full, sparing neither day nor night in self-reproach, ever fearful of inadequate service. Each governs their own conduct, striving to align with the Supreme’s intent—how could they dare grow lax, lest they fail in propriety?\n\nDaily they advance of their own accord, requiring no divine admonition, yet desiring self-cultivation to attain longevity. In their dealings with the gods of Heaven, whether great or small, all matters are mutually known. What can be executed must not be undertaken arbitrarily, lest suspicion arise; every action is reported without cease. Why is this so? Each person harbors their own aspirations. Each has their own thoughts, their own achievements, their own calculations, their own perspectives, their own expressions. From birth, each desires attainment, each knows their place, and their hearts are thus made clear.\n\nIn this bureau’s affairs, reverence for life is paramount—life is foremost, while all else is secondary to one’s own reckoning. The *qi* of life infuses the human body, neither departing nor separating, mutually sustaining and completing. The gods, too, prize the attainment of their names, transforming and traversing without obstruction, moving freely through the smallest and greatest spaces.\n\nOrdinary people do not perceive the gods’ forms, yet the gods know one another intimately. Their forms are composed entirely of *qi*—how could they not achieve their ends? Great gods and lesser gods differ in the waxing and waning of their radiant essence. When their lifespan increases ninefold, so too do their years. Those who enact great transformations through goodness enjoy boundless longevity—above, there is no higher; below, no lower. They move without hindrance, without exterior or interior, their form like a ceaseless cycle. To halt is to halt; to proceed is to proceed. Through breath they become divine, their brilliance and splendor flourishing.\n\nYet even in ascent and descent, there are appointed times. When the moment arrives, they act and return in due course—not entirely at will, for hierarchy constrains them. Each serves as emissary to another, each bears their ledger, each holds their office. Their hearts must align with their duties, their resolve unwavering, their actions clear. Each witnesses their own merit, each advances what they know, harboring no private intent. Every action adheres to instruction, never straying from the teachings. With unceasing diligence, they press forward in their aspirations, halting only upon receiving the decree.\n\nSuch is the vow of the gods of life, each bearing a talismanic transmission as proof of their conduct. In all their inspections, they partake of provisions as stipulated, never exceeding the written decree, taking only what is allotted. The waystations of Heaven maintain their own records; those unentitled to stay must not linger.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord’s constant teaching forbids recklessness, lest the guardians of transmissions abuse their authority. Offices have their hierarchies—none may falsely claim high rank to prolong their stay in the waystations. The officials receive the Heavenly Lord’s decree, and any transgression in the waystations is reported, along with the offender’s name, rank, and affiliation. No concealment or deceit is possible, for the Heavenly Lord already knows. How could private favor be shown? All is made clear and just.\n\nTo act without the Lord’s command, to repeatedly submit ledgers—this dissipates one’s radiant essence and diminishes one’s lifespan. This is known and certain. One must be vigilant at all times, never daring to act on personal inclination, never failing to heed the teachings from above. The gods of Heaven continually inspect and recommend one another without respite.\n\nThose who follow, whether ascending or descending, must know these prohibitions. The sagely and enlightened do not transgress them, but lest later generations remain unaware of these warnings, the Heavenly decrees are disseminated to all under Heaven. Such is the Heavenly Lord’s great benevolence, lest any violate them.\n\nIt is the Heavenly Lord’s wish to cultivate goodness, and thus these texts are shown even to ordinary people. Though few among them understand the harmony between Heaven and Earth, each observes their own taboos. The decrees circulate throughout the world, among the people of the central harmony, the farmers of the roads, the gatherings at field boundaries, the households and official lodgings, the gates, wells, and hearths. The powers of punishment and virtue each govern their domains—evil must not be permitted.\n\nFurther records are kept, noting names and accumulating the sagely governance of myriad affairs. The Heavenly Lord of the Hall of Light learns of them, and human lifespans are reduced, even unto death. How can one not be cautious? Those who disregard these texts are later generations who disbelieve the words of their forebears. Thus, they are again issued to those of discernment who observe the prohibitions, that the common folk may know them. Without written decree, the mandate cannot be fully concluded.\n\nEvil records accumulate day by day, seldom diminishing. Therefore, the Lord first issues written admonitions to prevent transgressions. To violate them is to thin one’s destiny without doubt. One must follow the written decrees—minor transgressions may yet be remedied, but for grave offenses, how could pardon be obtained? The admonitory texts are not limited to a single scroll. One must be doubly, triply cautious, for the patterns of Heaven brook no license.\n\nThose with understanding seldom transgress. Should they err inadvertently, Heaven may pardon them, sparing them from the ranks of the wicked. But to persist in evil is to bind oneself to the ledgers of death, consigned to the Earthly Bureau, where one’s remains are interred. When will they emerge again? Their refined souls are confined, interrogated about their deeds in life. Their words differ, and they are subjected to torment. The suffering of their souls is extreme—whose fault is this but their own?\n\nBorn as fellow humans, why engage in evil? Each should guard their conduct well. Heaven bestows human lifespans, which cannot be regained. To do evil is to shorten one’s years—when will there be benefit? At this juncture, the Heavenly Lord acts with resolve, unwilling to overlook evil deeds and grant long life. Is this not known?\n\nThe repeated admonitions exist because people do not change, yet the Lord desires they live out their years. Those who refuse to do good bring ruin upon themselves, and what can be done with those who persist in evil? Minor transgressions may be pardoned for the sake of their future, but should they remain unprepared, they will be reminded again.\n\n**Admonition on Great Longevity, Section 200**\nOnly those of resolute intent remain unconfused in heart. Following Heaven’s transformations, they take their guidance where it is due.\n\nEach is allowed to follow their wishes, thus fulfilling their heart’s desires. The myriad twelve thousand beings all arise from the earth of central harmony, growing and flourishing, each returning to cover and shade its own roots. Their blossoms and fruits nourish the body and mouth, aiding the grain in the field, providing sour, salty, bitter, and bland flavors. Water transforms naturally into salt to harmonize all tastes. Beans become fermented paste to enhance the salt’s savor, their richness or lightness left to free will. All edible vegetables and creatures are given for the people to consume, sustaining warmth and fullness, nurturing their forms to grow, and passing this down through generations. Even the six livestock unfit for labor are fed to them, their meat made tender, sweet, and crisp for consumption.\n\nThese are the spirits Heaven appoints to their duties, balancing and equalizing all things so each may follow their wishes without disturbance to their peace. Is this not Heaven’s grace and benevolence bestowed upon the people? Why then does Heaven not demand repayment? When would Heaven ever seek recompense? It is only that the common people, having received such great kindness, fail to return thanks—this is why it is sought. Heaven feeds on the essence of qi’s radiance, naturally requiring no repayment from the people; what matters is their intent. Yet they do not reflect on the qi of Heaven that gives life and allows them to eat.\n\nAmong the people, those who know better yet fail to repay act as if it were their duty to serve Heaven’s commands. The appointed spirits move among the people, sending forth flying insects to issue decrees, urging farmers to hasten their planting, while the cuckoos call day after day. The people heed their words, and in every household, great or small, all who eat grain exhort one another from dawn to dusk. When the rains come and seeds are sown, Heaven makes them grow tall. Seasonal winds and rains sway their branches and leaves, filling their bodies day by day until they ripen to feed the people. Is this kindness not profound? From year to year, when will it ever end?\n\nYet in return, they show no filial piety, harboring rebellious hearts. What benefit does Heaven gain from nurturing evil people long enough to let them see the food before them? Do they believe Heaven is unaware? Why should it continue to sustain the unfilial and wicked? Thus, Heaven places malevolent spirits to follow them, making their transgressions weightier, their sins grave, and their misfortunes severe, leaving no time for pardon.\n\nWhy do the people persist in such ways, bringing upon themselves a shortened lifespan and the loss of their allotted years? Should they not observe how the filial and good alone attain longevity and descendants? Good and evil must be compared: the short-lived and the long-lived stand in contrast, just as life and death are as distant as paths that never meet. Those who do good and practice filial kindness live out their years, some even gaining extended lifespans, their descendants following in succession without premature death.\n\nIs this not the reward for good and filial conduct? Why then do they commit evil and inflict it upon others? Heaven deeply abhors such acts, swiftly cutting short their lives and bringing misfortune to their descendants—what hope remains for them? Heaven favors the good and rejects the wicked.\n\nOne should ponder the words of this text, for its teachings are complete and sufficient for self-protection, ensuring Heaven’s blessings. Why endure prolonged suffering and self-inflicted sorrow, filling the heart with grief? When sorrowful qi congeals and remains unresolved, day and night are filled with bitter sighs, thoughts consumed by the scattering of wealth and the fear of losing it forever. Illness lingers for years, confining one to bed, beyond the reach of physicians, the knotted qi unbroken. In constant distress, the body grows weak, food intake dwindles, and the grains cannot be digested. The five viscera are unsettled, the spleen fails to grind. This is the state of incompleteness, where breath is short and food will not pass.\n\nThe household watches, knowing recovery is unlikely. Those with wealth may have some savings, but those without see their resources exhausted, their inner and outer lives impoverished, unable to sustain one another. Death arrives, yet no coffin is prepared; they are buried in the earth. Only if they had managed their lives and possessed wealth would they be exhumed. For the impoverished, wealth departs and people scatter—when will they reunite? The family is torn apart, unable to save one another. Thus, they are buried without a coffin, becoming wandering ghosts without a home, with no one to offer them food. As hungry ghosts, they beg endlessly for sustenance. This is the consequence of evil deeds, yet they do not realize they have lost their clan.\n\nAlas, how painful! To die with no one to rely on. Such are those who accumulate misfortune, bringing ruin upon their lineage and leaving no descendants. Heaven grieves deeply for them. Thus, a posthumous child may be left, its gender unknown. Before the child grows, the mother remarries. When the child is older and asks their relatives, “Where are my parents?” they are told, “Your father was young and restless, unable to settle. He followed reckless companions, heedless of his family, became a bandit, and never ceased his crimes. The authorities executed him, and he fled elsewhere. His wealth was exhausted, and he never returned to his hometown. For years, he wandered in distant lands, and his fate remains unknown.”\n\nAll the households suffered from his poisonous deeds, and even distant relatives kept their distance. When your mother was pregnant with you, seeing you would carry on the lineage, she rejoiced in her heart. But the elders of the household had no one to depend on, impoverished and unable to support themselves, they sent her to work. She followed a traveling merchant, with no set date for return.\n\nThe posthumous child laments, “All people are born dependent on their parents, yet I alone have never seen mine.” When older, they ask about their father’s whereabouts. They are told, “Your father did evil, abandoning his parents and wandering far away. His fate is unknown, and no one has heard from him. It is said he is dead, but no one knows where.” The parents, grieving, fell ill and never recovered. They failed to live as proper humans, their wealth exhausted, their inner and outer lives ruined. The fault lies with distant relatives who shared no bond of kindness.\n\nShould one not look to Heaven and weep bitterly, tears soaking their clothes? The father’s evil deeds brought this upon himself, never to return home.\n\nThe child reproached himself endlessly, finding no relief. At times, he worked as a hired laborer for wealthy households, serving as their servant. Earning several thousand cash a year, his clothing came from this income, with little left to spare. After more than ten years of accumulation, he had enough to return to his hometown. He sought to summon his father’s spirit, weeping day and night, with no one to rely on. How grievous was his pain! His father’s past misdeeds left him without support, his tears flowing like a stream, never drying.\n\nHeaven, in its great sorrow, granted him robust health, allowing him to prosper in his livelihood and take a wife. With children and grandchildren, his heart found slight ease. He then told his son, “Your grandfather did evil, wandering far away and never returning. When travelers passed through, I would ask laborers and diviners about him, but none knew whether he lived or died, nor where his spirit might rest. After years of working to sustain myself, Heaven took pity on my hardship, blessing me with profit. With some savings, I sought a wife to help manage our livelihood, and thus you were born. I lament your grandfather’s misdeeds in his youth, and so I warn you now. From this day forward, you must only do good. Do not follow your grandfather’s path, wandering far away. Reflect on my own faults—it is Heaven’s mercy that I endure. Strive to cultivate virtue, avoid idleness, and order your livelihood. Do not take what belongs to others; let sufficiency be your measure. Care for one another, do not drink recklessly, nor engage in idle gossip or disputes, lest you invite ruin.\n\nPonder deeply your parents’ words, and you will avoid blame. If Heaven hears of your goodness, you may become a virtuous son, attaining a long and fulfilled life. I offer this as a great lesson. Let the gods hear and report it above. Heaven will send benevolent spirits to accompany you, ensuring your livelihood prospers, your wealth grows, and your children thrive in health. Thus, you will have enough—this is Heaven’s grace. At the festivals of spring, autumn, and the year’s end, offer thanks to Heaven. Never cease in your diligence to do good, and you will secure your own fortune. Guard your words and reflect on your actions. The heavenly spirits are ever near; do not speak recklessly. A moment’s carelessness may lead to ruin, while heedlessness may cost you your life. When you receive this warning, reproach yourself, not others—let this lesson be clear.\n\nThose who desire long life must not neglect these admonitions.\n\n**Illness and Heaven’s Judgment, Scroll 201**\n\nAll people dwell in the world, each with their proper path and accomplishments. None should be deprived of their aspirations; let each follow what brings them peace and joy—whether as merchants, farmers, officials, physicians, shamans, or artisans. The Dao allows all to flourish, providing for the people’s needs. This is Heaven’s teaching and transformation; what endeavor will not succeed if it sustains life?\n\nOne must remember to honor Heaven’s will, to extend kindness, and to offer pure and unceasing sacrifices in return for the four seasons’ blessings. This is how one repays Heaven’s grace. Through long practice of virtue, the spirits will favor you, for goodness is its own reward—what could fail to follow? Thus, Heaven ever watches above, judging human deeds. Spirits come and go, knowing all that people do, reporting good and evil without fail. How could there be any oversight?\n\nSome may doubt this, but Heaven reveals its signs through echoes and omens. The timing of wind and rain, swift or delayed, is made known—what room is there for doubt? Actions yield corresponding results, and written records preserve the law without error. How can people remain unaware? How can they indulge their desires and defy Heaven?\n\nHeaven, born of the primordial qi, naturally follows its own decrees. One dare not harbor even the slightest intention of defiance, fearing loss and the people’s suffering. To offend Heaven is to walk heedlessly into the net. Thus, Heaven commands this warning: to attain long life, one must be equal to the virtuous.\n\nHow can one act with such reckless abandon? Spirits follow those who do evil, observing their misdeeds and reporting every transgression, great or small, to Heaven. These are the faults of men—why blame Heaven’s decrees? The warnings are written, yet they are ignored. Only when illness strikes does one panic—how can it be avoided?\n\nTruly, the people’s folly brings no benefit to Heaven, only weariness and distress to the spirits. Physicians and shamans strive to heal, yet those who seek life forget their transgressions. When they committed evil, they gave no thought to repentance—why wait until illness strikes to seek deliverance? By then, death often follows.\n\nFor those who pray and sacrifice to the spirits, minor offenses may be absolved, but grave sins are not forgiven. Instead, they face greater demands: summons to false spirits, prostrations, and desperate pleas for life. Though petitions are submitted repeatedly, death’s verdict is sealed—how can one escape?\n\nPhysicians, shamans, and spirit-mediums, seeking only profit, claim the illness can be cured. They demand rich offerings, fine wine, and meat, invoking mighty spirits to intercede, promising deliverance from death. Yet the ledger of fate is not so easily altered. When wealth is exhausted, life is lost. If after three summons the spirits do not descend and the illness remains, why persist? Misfortune will only compound, and blame will follow.\n\nFalse spirits masquerade as true ones, acting with reckless violence, killing the innocent. Their crimes and grievances ascend to Heaven, where the Heavenly Lord judges them. Those who serve such spirits, even their descendants who seek blessings for the sick, will suffer retribution for their improper invocations.\n\nThose who claim their spirits are true yet teach others to invoke false spirits—how dare they stand before the Heavenly Lord to intercede for others? They only consume the people’s offerings of wine, meat, dates, and cakes. When the sick turn to these false spirit-mediums, those who recover are counted among the not-yet-dead. If their offenses have not yet been recorded above, they may be spared by Heaven’s mercy—but how can these false spirit-mediums claim credit for healing? Do they not boast of curing many?\n\nThose who extort rich offerings from others—when they witness the deeds of false spirits, they summon them to ascend and interrogate their hidden sins. If their hidden sins are many and grave, they will not survive. When those who serve spirits find their spirits no longer come and go, and the people’s condition worsens, their essence and spirit daily diminish—this is the calamity brought by the false spirits themselves. The spirit-mediums, having obtained the remnants of the false spirits’ offerings, use them to feed their households with rich food and fine clothing, believing their prosperity will last. Yet how can they hope to live long when the spirits have already condemned them? Those who receive many hidden offerings from spirits cannot escape retribution; their descendants will perish as well. They invert the truth, claiming, \"You have slain my descendants,\" or even wishing for their own households to vanish entirely.\n\nPeople ought to rectify themselves daily—do not blame Heaven. Yet people of this age are profoundly foolish and shallow. When struck by illness and near death, they do not turn to Heaven in repentance, nor do they confess their transgressions and bow their heads in remorse. Instead, their entire households, young and old, join in pleading for mercy. After days of such supplication, Heaven may pardon them, granting them time to recover. But if they repeat their offenses, their bowing will be of no avail—this is plain to see. Strive to do good, avoid forbidden acts, and you may live out your allotted years. If you refuse to do good, you invite a shortened life; if you choose to become a ghost, you scorn your own existence—what recourse remains?\n\nGuard your words carefully. Those who delight in understanding my teachings should reflect and not act unjustly. When ill, turn to Heaven. This spares expense and prevents great distress, avoiding the panic that drives entire households to flee their homes in terror. What use is fleeing for those already marked for death? Malevolent spirits follow them—can they truly escape? Fools act in such ways, yet how can they claim a place among the not-yet-dead? Do not flee. The house itself does not kill; the household merely declines. With Heaven’s spirits watching above, what fate do they seek? Do they truly not know their own place?\n\nBe cautious in speech. Heaven cherishes life and desires humanity’s survival—when has it ever wished to harm or kill? It establishes prohibitions precisely to prevent transgressions. Yet if you violate them, how can your lifespan extend? Reflect deeply, ponder these words, and cast aside doubt. When the text briefly pauses, resume your contemplation, and repeat what has been taught.\n\n**Section Two Hundred and Two: On the Resolution of Illness Through Heaven’s Reproof and Admonition**\nConsider the people of the world—how utterly foolish and isolated they are. They neglect filial piety and instead commit acts of rebellion. They disregard the great teachings of the scriptures and recklessly debase themselves. Having done no good for others, their evil deeds are frequently heard. Those who dwell in such ways invite disaster; those in the middle face decline; those below suffer illness without respite. This is the consequence of inflicting harm on others, leaving no room for grievances and no thought of bestowing kindness.\n\nDay and night, they oppress and exploit the good, provoking resentment and offering no benevolence in return. Instead, they scheme, entrapping others in guilt, subjecting them to punishment—even death—and severing their ties to their lords. Wealthy households, able to resolve disputes with wine, escape legal trouble without expense, while the penniless, entangled in the law, are summoned by officials. To secure their release, they exhaust their possessions, valuing every item, and pay the ransom. Half is taken by others, leaving just enough to feed their households with fine wine and meat, indulging their desires. They believe their actions will endure, yet others observe and judge them impartially. Their evil deeds will not go unnoticed.\n\nWhen the county magistrate is strict, officials are dispatched to monitor and report their misdeeds. Day and night, these officials watch, eager to expose their wrongdoing. They secretly record the names of the guilty and their accomplices, then deliver sealed reports to the magistrate’s gate, listing the offenders. Corrupt officials, acting as intermediaries, relay their misdeeds, feasting on fine wine and rich meats as they do so. When the magistrate receives the report, he summons the accused in secret, presents evidence, and ensures no false accusations arise. Once guilt is determined, the accused is sent to prison, where they are tortured to confess their hidden crimes. If others testify against them, their punishment is compounded. Even if the offense involves mere money, they do not strive to advance honestly or cultivate profitable livelihoods. Instead, they sell their tongues to entrap others, leading them into guilt—this is pure evil. How can they hope for long life? The high officials despise them, ensuring their demise. Whose fault is this? It stems entirely from the corruption of the wicked.\n\nParents grieve bitterly, and clans suffer torment. Those who act in such ways—what do they hope for? How can they desire long life? They invite punishment yet seek survival—what manner of person are they? Heaven observes from above, declaring its patience exhausted. The text is sent to the bureau of malevolent officials, dispatching officers and evil spirits to assist the county magistrate in punishing the lawless, ensuring they face the death penalty and lose all hope of survival. All this arises from greed for others’ wealth, which they hoard for themselves, sitting idly until their guilt is confirmed and death is certain. No descendants remain to make offerings to their ancestors—this is their own fault.\n\nFrom this point forward, those who come after must heed these warnings and cease their wrongdoing, or they will barely survive. Otherwise, they will surely join the ranks of the dead—there is no doubt. Be cautious, and avoid mutual resentment. A human life cannot be regained. All face the same fate—why not follow the prohibitions?\n\nThe lawless form gangs, banding together to rob others of their wealth, leaving their victims incomplete. Before the county magistrate can execute them, Heaven metes out punishment, annihilating their households and dooming their descendants. They gain wealth yet lose their lives—what part of this is not folly? Thus, these scriptures are frequently revealed to prevent such transgressions. Yet those who persist in their offenses face even greater peril, and many perish as a result. Heaven deeply abhors this.\n\nThose who possess understanding naturally avoid such crimes. Yet the people of this age remain utterly blind. They read the scriptures on longevity but disregard their words, dismissing them as untrustworthy.\n\nOne should not assume that those who attain immortality as divine transcendents do so without first embodying filial piety and goodness—only thus do they achieve boundless longevity. Carefully consider their words: though their expressions may align, let your virtuous deeds manifest while your vices naturally dissipate. The warnings set forth in these scriptures, both preceding and following, aim solely to guide people toward goodness and prevent transgressions—when have they ever led one astray? You ought to reflect deeply, embedding these teachings within your five viscera, so they may be practiced faithfully. Do not defy the will of Heaven. Opposition yields no benefit; it only compounds your faults. Take heed not to harbor resentment—your conduct determines your fate; whom can you blame? Strive to follow goodness, for only thus can one be called human. Cherish your actions, lest you incur the reproach of spirits—do you not understand?\n\nEach must weigh their own choices wisely, lest they pursue wrongdoing and forfeit their lives without recompense. The accumulation of calamities is vast, and the cycle of resentment and hatred knows no end. A guarded heart is essential; empty words serve no purpose. The affairs of this world bring only sorrow and poison to humanity—what use is it to argue, hoping to foster harmony? Those who deem themselves virtuous, seeking to enlighten others, only reveal their own folly when they fail to measure up. Born as humans, they lack discernment, and when questioned, they offer no clarity. Such people are no better than livestock: though they recognize foul odors and fine garments, perform rituals of bowing and rising, they cannot serve as models. Their hearts are ever unruly. When they encounter elderly neighbors, they remain insolent and unmoved; they shut away women, passing judgment on their appearance. These are wicked people with nothing constructive to do—idle and arrogant, they curse and revile, denying the existence of earthly spirits. They incriminate one another, acting as they please without restraint.\n\nThey give no thought to the impending disasters, nor can they aid one another in time. Even when rescue comes, it arrives too late—what good does it do? Their meddling only breeds further chaos, yet the truth remains visible. How can they justify themselves or absolve their debts? Condemned by the multitude, their misdeeds persist until their households are ruined, their descendants lost, and their longevity forfeit. Pitiful are such actions—how can they endure? The *Scriptures of Great Peace* decree that those below must submit to those above to attain lasting stability. Failure to do so invites ruin and invites ungovernable chaos. The people of this age grow ever more callous, bereft of righteousness and principle. They indulge their immediate desires, heedless of their own lives. Reckless and unrestrained, they deny the existence of spirits, and those who neglect these teachings are many. Every action bears consequences, and the Hall of Light records all, scrutinizing past and present, submitting names to the authorities. When transgressions and debts are reported, the officials notify the Bureau of Grand Yin, whose agents summon the ancestors of the offender to be interrogated and punished. Commanded to return home, they utter curses and confess their wrongdoings, their misdeeds unceasing, thus afflicting the living with illness.\n\nThe afflicted household must perform rites to resolve the yin retribution and lift the heavenly reprimand, halting the misfortune. If the reprimand is not resolved, the illness persists, and the offender is held accountable anew. Once the reprimand remains unaddressed, they dismiss it as falsehood, yet their actions betray them—whether many or few, the consequences are clear. Thus, one must exercise caution henceforth, lest their faults multiply. Only through understanding can one avoid blame. Ignorance perpetuates the cycle between suffering and fortune without respite. Heed the words of these scriptures; do not incur debts against one another. It is difficult to keep records, and the spirits do not rest. They perceive human intentions, yet people persist in wrongdoing—this is the root of evil. Goodness begets goodness, while wickedness foreshortens life. Why harbor resentment? Your fate is of your own making. Submit to those above, and you will have no wicked children—do you not understand?\n\nBeware, beware—let this bring a brief respite. The scriptures are difficult to compose, their laws expansive; the key is to avoid transgression. Some passages may be slightly obscure, with minor inconsistencies. Reflect deeply on what follows, and let understanding guide you—take heed, take heed. Small matters lead to great consequences, and the text reiterates this, hence the brief pause. Further explanations will follow.\n\n**Chapter Two Hundred and Three: The Unyielding Covenant of Parents**\n\nOnly those who cultivate goodness naturally avoid transgressing the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, stars, and all spirits. Fearing the consequences of violation, they record their names above, thus resolving to practice goodness and filial devotion. The celestial prohibitions exist not to restrict the people but to ensure their flourishing—when would they wish for concealment? They provide for the sustenance of all living things—when would they desire mutual harm? It is humanity that violates these principles.\n\nThus, the virtuous refrain from wicked speech. Each teaching is clearly articulated, its warnings and outcomes plainly evident: goodness leads to life, while evil hastens death. What quarrel is there with the people? Therefore, the texts of the virtuous are presented to instruct the living, revealing the origins of fortune and misfortune, expounding the precepts to prevent transgressions. Those who practice goodness are free from wicked words. Heaven recognizes their virtue, dispatching spirits to accompany them, altering their life registers, and inscribing their names among the long-lived. Their merit is thus fulfilled, inspiring future generations to emulate their goodness. On days when the Celestial King governs, they face no taboos below. The remaining years of their ancestors are added to their own, granting them a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years. Their descendants inherit this benevolence, free from minor faults, and likewise enjoy longevity, their white hair succeeding one another. Generation after generation, their households prosper, their members complete. Whether tilling the land, engaging in trade, or serving as officials, they reap benefits. Promotions come frequently, free from the threat of punishment—such is the reward of goodness.\n\nYet people fail to emulate them, instead mocking their ways. The hearts of the virtuous remain steadfast in goodness, benefiting others. When they encounter those in distress, they lend aid without demanding repayment or interest. Those who receive their kindness will not betray them. Even a small repayment—offered with wine and meat in gratitude—fosters mutual goodwill.\n\nHeaven observes their conduct and further favors them, ensuring that in all their goings and outgoings, none dare offend them. Those who practice goodness—Heaven itself assists them, preventing them from encountering misfortune, for such is the outcome of their deeds.\n\nAs for those who do evil yet hope to attain longevity and descendants, this is a failure to discern. Thus, Heaven distinguishes their lifespans: those who can perform the deeds of Heaven, aligning their hearts and wills with the Dao, may attain transcendence, be recorded among the worthy and sagely, and have their spirits augmented—how limitless their years shall be! Therefore, it is said that goodness must not be neglected, for it is beyond what most can achieve. Thus, Heaven cherishes those who are good and does not wish them to harbor evil.\n\nThe good and the wicked each have their allotted place—how could they be equated? The words of Heaven’s scriptures are clear: the good are rewarded with goodness, while the wicked are warned, lest they fall into peril and forfeit their years. This is Heaven’s way: it extends the lives of the good and reduces the wicked to less than human—this is plain to see, so why doubt it?\n\nFrom birth to old age, a person naturally begets children and grandchildren, raising them to maturity and fulfillment. One should follow their inclinations, ensuring their contentment, never opposing their wishes, so each may find their proper place and fulfill their desires. To be a parent is no easy task, and children, in turn, must be filial, heeding their parents’ teachings. Thus, the bones, flesh, and limbs of the good remain whole, and what parents have begotten should be kept intact, free from harm or injury.\n\nWhat parents have given, one must not dare to repay with words; rather, when there is goodness, it should be advanced. If the household lacks wealth, one should be reverent, gentle, and tender, frequently inquiring after their well-being to know their safety—this is the highest form of goodness. Neighbors and close kin should all be treated with love and emulation, perfecting the practice of goodness.\n\nWhen encountering violent and wicked people, one must not dare to engage them in speech, lest conflict arise. Once conflict arises, the good person’s virtue is lost, and Heaven, too, comes to detest them. Thus, all must value and guard themselves, lest their descendants suffer. Beware of transgressing prohibitions, lest the household be unsettled—not only unsettled, but affecting kin both near and far. Disturbances within and without may lead to encounters with officials, the loss of property, and ruin.\n\nTherefore, one must be cautious and not violate the words of the scriptures. Those who can foster harmony and peace, without duplicity, each attending to their own duties and accomplishing their tasks—such are the deeds of the truly good. Heaven will surely grant them long life, and spirits and gods will protect them, never failing in their care. The offerings made in the four seasons follow their proper order, and in the marketplace, they select the finest goods without haggling over prices.\n\nThe reason for this is that all offerings possess spirit; they ascend and descend in accord with their due, and even slight impurities will be recorded in writing, never overlooked. Thus, one must follow the path of commerce with reverence, and the divine spirits will surely rejoice. They report to the Registrar of Destinies, and the officials of the ancestral shrines proceed in peace. If one personally ensures the purity of the incense, the offerings are accepted, and after the meal, the Five Ancestors are greatly venerated. Then, the food is consumed in its proper place, and all partake with joy.\n\nThe household prospers, and the children and grandchildren are all good, without a single wicked child. The commanderies and counties hear of this and summon them to serve as officials of rank, promoting them to the prefecture, where they are assigned prominent positions. The province, too, learns of them and summons them to serve in close proximity, recommending them for their integrity and outstanding talent—such is the result of goodness. Their conduct brings its own reward, and their position is assured. This is also the workings of fate and the allotment of destiny, a clear sign of their virtue, so that evil does not pass their door.\n\nAll the gods in Heaven declare that such conduct is especially good—only the will of Heaven remains unknown. Thus, the good texts record the deeds of the good on bamboo and silk, so that later generations may be inspired to advance, perpetuating the goodness of the household for generations. Their descendants never leave the court, beloved by emperors and kings, ever holding virtuous offices—such merit arises naturally, all from the blessings they have earned.\n\nTherefore, those who practice goodness should take this scripture as their model, for its words are trustworthy and not empty. **Above: Heaven’s discourse on filial piety to quell rebellion, repel the barbarians, and bring the world into compliance and ease of governance.**\n\n*This concludes the one hundred fourteenth scroll of the* Scripture of Great Peace.\n\n*(According to the Dunhuang manuscript* Catalogue of the Scripture of Great Peace*, this chapter should be titled* “The Secret of Filial Conduct Revered by the Divine.”*)*\n\n**Scroll One Hundred Sixteen of the** *Scripture of Great Peace*\n**A Certain Secret, Number Two Hundred Four**\n\n(Previous text lost)\n\nTheir qi converges, aligning with the emperor’s affairs—shared joy, shared heart, shared direction, shared course, shared pivot, shared root, shared intent. Thus the sages of old established the laws, assigning the emperor to the east in spring, the south in summer, the west in autumn, and the north in winter, to act in concert with Heaven’s qi. When qi is aligned, they meet in harmony. This is what is meant by carefully following the Dao of Heaven, sharing Heaven’s qi—thus they respond in accord and find joy. The harmony spoken of by the ruler is this mutual joy. When there is mutual joy, Heaven and Earth remain ever pleased, without strife or anger. Without strife or anger, disasters, harms, treacheries, and all malign forces vanish entirely. Once malign people are gone, the qi of peace arrives. The qi of peace from Heaven descends to govern below, while the qi of peace from Earth ascends to assist above.\n\nIf one does not follow this joy, using the qi that the August Heaven and Earth favor, but instead employs abandoned qi, all will fall into disorder and opposition—opposing the Dao of Heaven and Earth, opposing the emperor’s qi, acting contrary to the intent of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth will rage in conflict, myriad changes arise together, treachery and malice flourish daily, leading to unrest and disorder, and the qi of inauspicious years will come. Thus one must deeply understand this.\n\nExcellent, excellent! This foolish student has heard the command. Is it not clear? Heaven delights in this—O Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\nIndeed, indeed. I shall carefully record it and dare not forget.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Since the Heavenly Illuminated Master has no choice but to elaborate, I wish to hear how spring, summer, autumn, and winter each follow their qi according to their proper measures.\n\nOnly the sixth month differs: on the summer solstice, the *gong* tone is activated, and throughout the fifth and sixth months, it is purely the *gong* tone. Moreover, in music, one raises the voice in song and dance. The qi of kingship should be stirred—stirring reveals joy, and mutual compliance reveals mutual assistance. The qi of rest, imprisonment, and death all desire stillness and do not wish to be stirred. If stirred, they become displeased, then enraged, and from rage arise malign forces, treachery, disasters, and harms. This is the natural disposition of Heaven and Earth, not erring even once.\n\nWhich qi should be stirred? I wish to hear this as a model and dare not oppose a single qi.\n\nOne should first stir the emperor’s qi, then the king’s qi, then the minister’s qi, then the observer’s qi, and finally the subtle qi. These qi all lie before the Celestial Dipper, advancing daily to offer assistance and flourishing—thus they are stirred. The remaining qi lie behind the Celestial Dipper, where Heaven’s qi turns away, and their qi wanes daily. Thus they should not be stirred, for to do so would oppose Heaven and rebel against Earth, failing to align with the heart of Heaven and Earth—hence, it is inauspicious. Therefore, what Heaven faces is flourished, and what Heaven turns from is abandoned. This is how to know the seasons and qi, and from this, good and ill fortune, safety and peril may be discerned.\n\nMay I ask: if only the king’s tone is stirred, and the five tones are incomplete, how can a proper song and dance be formed?\n\nExcellent, your question! The reason is simply that when the regulators of yin and yang are first stirred, movement produces sound. Thus, when music moves, it always accompanies sound. Yang has sound—hence the first *gong*, third *zhi*, fifth *yu*, seventh *shang*, and ninth *jiao*—while the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth are not named as tones. Punishment belongs to great yin, which acts without sound, thus subtly harming people. \"Acting without sound\" refers to this.\n\nThen why does the military commander have sound?\n\nExcellent question! The military commander of a nobleman does have sound, but it is merely the music of challenge and retreat, not intended to cause harm. Only when rage erupts and harm is imminent does sound arise from within, and they no longer communicate with words.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTruly so—now even the slightly foolish student has awakened.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, when preparing to follow the Way of music, bore it on their left; when preparing to follow the Way of punishment, bore it on their right. Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left belongs to yang; the right belongs to yin—each follows its own kind.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nTherefore, in my affairs of culture, I follow Heaven in intent and Earth in principle. Those who comply find fortune and prosperity; those who resist meet misfortune. If one’s intent differs from Heaven’s, what can one hope for?\n\nThus, Heaven possesses three qi: the upper qi is called *music*, the middle qi is called *harmony*, and the lower qi is called *punishment*. Music belongs to yang; punishment belongs to yin; harmony belongs to the center.\n\nTherefore, the southeast—yang and music—loves life; the northwest—yin and rage—loves killing. The qi of harmony follows, coming and going, now hidden, now revealed, to avoid harm. Thus, music should only accompany auspicious affairs and matters of life; it must not be used for inauspicious affairs or matters of death. This is the celestial pattern and law—it cannot be reversed.\n\nPerfected One, heed my words with care.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, why do you speak of sound only in terms of the first *jia* day, without explaining it fully? How can one come to know all its applications?\n\nIt is proper to collate and compare the writings of all sages and worthies, each drawing from their own school, so that entry and exit, high and low, great and small, all correspond. Use one to illuminate ten, ten to illuminate a hundred, a hundred to illuminate a thousand, a thousand to illuminate ten thousand, ten thousand to illuminate the boundless. When all worthies deliberate together, nothing remains ungrasped. Thus, I merely present the beginning to you and do not exhaust every detail.\n\nThe superior person, upon seeing my text, will naturally grasp its full meaning. The middling person, upon seeing it, may yet ascend to understanding. The petty person, upon seeing it, may take it as a model and act accordingly. Without violating the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, each may cultivate good intent on their own. To explain everything fully would only overwhelm with words, losing the guiding principles and leaving the text disordered and difficult to govern. Therefore, one should only reveal the beginning and allow them to ponder it themselves.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nGo now—my discourse on this minor matter is complete. If you have further doubts, return again.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask: when sounds are harmonious, can one know whether their intent is attained or not?\n\nOne can indeed know.\n\nThe qi of emperors and kings is determined by celestial numbers. When the qi of an emperor or king prevails, the resonance of their commands and proclamations issues forth first. This is like an emperor or king first issuing decrees to the world—all people and things follow accordingly, and the world attains peace. Those who dare disobey are rebels and will perish. Thus, when the qi of an emperor or king is first emitted, all else follows.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nIf, however, the qi of an emperor or king is not emitted first, and instead the qi of *rest* or *imprisonment* is activated prematurely, forcing the qi of the emperor or king to follow, this is a grave act of rebellion. Such is the pattern and law of Heaven and Earth—it cannot be forced.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMoreover, the five tones each have their own correspondences: some draw upon Heaven, some upon Earth, some upon the sun, moon, and stars, some upon the four seasons and five phases, some upon mountains and rivers, and some upon the people and the myriad things. When a tone moves, all that it governs is stirred, each yielding its own effects. Thus, when harmony aligns with its intent, good is produced; when it does not, evil arises.\n\nWhen tones are activated, the spirits of all things first come to pay homage, and only afterward do their forms respond. Therefore, when activating musical tones, one must always understand the matter at hand, carefully attaining its intent. Then, great peace may be achieved, and baleful qi dispelled. Perfected One, consider this well.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask: how does musical tone draw forth its correspondences?\n\nExcellent—your question strikes at the essential meaning!\n\nConsider spring, which moves first: when the great *jiao* string stirs on a *jia* day, above it draws forth Jupiter and the Heart Star, while below it draws forth the Eastern Marchmount. Its qi sways lesser yang; its tone sways the phase of wood; its spirit sways Gou Mang; its creature stirs the Azure Dragon; its position draws forth the Green Emperor; its spirits summon the green-robed jade maidens. From the highest heavens to the deepest earth, all come to pay homage in kind, delighting in its musical sound.\n\nSpeaking of one is to seek its kind—there is no end to it. If you refine and search for its essential meaning, you will grasp it all. Align it with ordinary texts and writings to form a model. Thus, when music attains its highest intent, one may transcend the world; when it attains its middle intent, one may bring about peace and dispel misfortune; when it attains its lower intent, one may bring joy to the people.\n\nAttaining its highest intent brings joy to the spirits; attaining its middle intent brings joy to the essences; attaining its lower intent brings joy to the body. When all intents are attained, emperors and kings may wander without care, music arises and punishment ceases, and spirits and essences are sated.\n\nI wish to hear the secret of how music arises and punishment ceases.\n\nExcellent, your words are apt!\n\nMusic is the essence of great yang; punishment is the essence of great yin. When yang flourishes, yin submits; when yin flourishes, yang submits. Thus, when music flourishes, punishment vanishes.\n\nWhy is music yang? And punishment?\n\nWhen tones are harmonious, their direction is harmonious and good; when tones are disharmonious, their direction is inauspicious and evil. At such times, listen carefully to the tones. Those who understand sound know all matters of fortune and misfortune; those who do not understand sound cannot know them.\n\nSound is the speech of music. Whether divining near or far, all must be aligned: the day, the hour, the surname, the written characters, the boundaries, the phases of prosperity, decline, rest, and decay—all are taken together to form the discourse. Those who listen with precision will not err.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nMay I ask how to use music to dispel disasters, treachery, and inauspicious evil, following the patterns and numbers of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen the Emperor should rise early or late to move his musical instruments and begin the chant, thereby dispelling the qi of sorrow and suffering to bring about Great Peace—excellent indeed! How skillfully you ask about the method.\n\nFor long has High Heaven been afflicted by disasters, pitying the Emperor’s sorrow and suffering. It has sent a Perfected One to preside over this inquiry—what doubts remain?\n\nVery well, very well. Be seated. I dare not conceal anything, for to hide the truth would invite Heaven’s censure, subjecting me to prolonged and heavy punishment, to no benefit for my celestial years. Be seated and listen carefully, as I shall distinguish and explain its essential meaning for you.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like a cycle, ever revolving and returning to its beginning. When music arises, it must always accord with the timely ascendance of the ruling qi. Establish the resonance where the Dipper’s handle points, and let the sound respond to that direction. Stir the tones and voices—whether led by a person’s chant or each following its own pitch.\n\nThe numbers derive from the Six Jia and the Five Phases; the Five and Six Jia and Five Phases are the very numbers of Heaven and Earth. The seasonal qi is what Heaven and Earth respond to and act upon. For example, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, when the Dipper points to *yin*, it is called the time of the Supreme Thearch—first strike the Great Horn. At the midpoint of the month, when it aligns with *jia*; in the second month, when the Dipper points to *mao*, and at the midpoint with *yi*; in the third month, when it points to *chen*. Proceed accordingly, adjusting for the earliness or lateness of the seasonal qi to determine the measurements.\n\nFirst move the Emperor’s tone and Emperor’s strings, then the King’s tone and King’s strings, then the Minister’s tone and Minister’s strings, then the Candidate’s tone and Candidate’s strings, then the Standard’s tone and Standard’s strings, each in their proper sequence. This is called receiving Heaven’s teaching and following Earth’s qi. If Heaven and Earth themselves delight in and employ it, how much more so should humans?\n\nHumans are the most honored of all beings, the children of Heaven. When people reverently and respectfully employ these numbers, Heaven delights in them; when they carefully and obediently employ them, Earth delights in them. This is like a filial child following the teachings of father and mother—how could parents not love and favor them?\n\nNow Heaven has sent you to ask these matters. As I serve as Heaven’s interlocutor, expounding the regulations for Great Peace above, I dare not omit anything. I fear the punishment of Heaven and Earth and dare not deceive the Perfected Ones or conceal anything. Only when not asked do I remain silent; when asked, I speak without reserve. Observing the Perfected One’s inquiry, I perceive that Heaven desires to speak, and so I explain fully for you.\n\nIf you, Perfected One, obtain this Dao, ponder its meaning deeply and transmit it to later generations, enabling them to emulate it and thereby eliminate all manner of disasters. Above, this will pacify the qi of Heaven and Earth; below, it will assist the Emperor in governance. It will settle the hearts of all people, preventing them from straying into wickedness, and allow the twelve thousand things each to find their proper place—how joyous this would be!\n\nGreat indeed, great indeed! The Perfected Ones may truly be said to understand.\n\nMay I ask about the affairs of the Six Caverns and Eight Directions: which are most auspicious and good, and which are most inauspicious and evil?\n\nExcellent, your inquiry. Now listen carefully, as I explain its meaning. That which is mutually accordant and joyful is good and auspicious; that which is mutually opposed and sorrowful is inauspicious and evil. Mutual accord and joy produce good sounds; mutual opposition and sorrow produce inauspicious sounds.\n\nThus, music is joy in itself. Mutual accord and joy are good music; auspicious affairs alone may be accompanied by music. Inauspicious and evil affairs must not have music—if music is present, it is called \"joy,\" yet misfortune will only multiply.\n\nTherefore, when the qi of the Emperor, the King, or the Minister is ascendant, all reside before the Celestial Dipper—this is auspicious. What Heaven and Earth delight in, they wish to arise; what they share, they employ together. Thus, one should delight in, follow, and prosper it. The qi of rest and decline is what Heaven and Earth jointly abandon and weaken; thus, it should be abandoned, and music should not be performed. To perform music is to go against the will of Heaven and Earth, constituting great rebellion and discord with the seasonal qi.\n\nThe seasonal qi is the proper qi of Heaven’s seasons. Heaven and Earth take this as their standard: the qi of ascendance and prosperity governs Great Peace, while the qi of decline and extinction establishes inauspicious years. The qi of ascendance and prosperity generates abundance and many good affairs. Thus, in years of Great Peace, all things flourish, and good things abound—this is clear evidence, the great effect of Heaven and Earth. The manifestations of Heaven and Earth’s delight in goodness extend to the people and the myriad things; this is the great evidence and verification.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply examined and correlated these signs to know the success or failure of their conduct. They clearly understood that like kinds, like affairs, and like qi correlate with one another. When one obtains the image of a like qi or kind, one reforms one’s nature and changes one’s conduct, daring not to act wrongly. The language of Heaven and Earth is revealed through these effects, not through direct speech with people. By observing the images and kinds obtained, one may know for oneself.\n\nThe qi of imprisonment, decline, death, and extinction generate little and accomplish no good affairs. Thus, in inauspicious years, little is produced, no good omens appear, and no good things arise—this is the correlation of like affairs and like qi.\n\nTherefore, those who would bring about Great Peace must perform music in full, for music accords with and delights in the ascendant qi, and the balanced qi arrives. But in inauspicious years, music must not be performed, nor may it be performed without cause. The qi of imprisonment and decline opposes Heaven and Earth; thus, in inauspicious years and affairs, music must not be performed.\n\nThe qi of ascendance and prosperity is where virtue resides; the qi of imprisonment and decline is where punishment resides. Thus, a virtuous ruler who cherishes life is enabled by Heaven to perform music, while a ruler without virtue may not—this is the clear evidence of Heaven.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed! Today, having fully inquired of the Illuminated Master of Heaven, I now fully comprehend the meaning of Heaven’s music. Before asking, I thought music a trivial matter, something anyone could perform at any time. Now, having asked, I shall never again act carelessly.\n\nExcellent! You, who understand matters, may truly be said to grasp the principles of texts and to have long attained Heaven’s intent.\n\nWhen the Great Peace arrives, all baleful qi departs.\n\nWith reverence, I humbly inquire again concerning the doubts in my heart. Speak plainly and without reservation.\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nNow, the qi of Heaven and Earth is half in ascendance and half in repose, like the unceasing alternation of day and night. How then could music be performed all day long? Should it be played only in the direction of ascendant qi, when the qi of kingship prevails? Yet when music begins, it is because the Son of Heaven initiates it—not because the qi of repose does. The same holds for the year, the month, the day, and the hour.\n\nThough this humble one has yet to grasp the full meaning, if one wishes to perform music for the year, it should be done in the east at *mao*, in the second month of spring. If for the month, it should correspond to that month; for the day, to the day of ascendant qi; for the hour, to the hour of ascendant qi. Only thus may one be said to accord with the Dao of Heaven, and baleful qi will depart. To act otherwise is to disrupt the celestial order and invite calamity.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of antiquity, deeply understanding the intent of Heaven and Earth, dared not perform music during inauspicious affairs. When inauspicious affairs are met with music, those ills multiply daily, growing beyond remedy—hence, music must not be performed then.\n\nHeaven endows each being with its own spirit. When music is good, good spirits arrive; when music is evil, evil spirits arrive—this is the natural disposition, nothing strange. Only the foolish fail to ponder this deeply.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nThe perfected one who wishes to know its great efficacy may compare it to the Dao of Heaven. All that is pure and serene delights in returning to Heaven; all that is heavy and turbid delights in returning to Earth—each follows its own abode, and none can be faulted for this. Thus, delighting in goodness brings goodness; delighting in inauspiciousness brings inauspiciousness, just as water flows downward and fire rises upward, not erring by even a fraction. The perfected one entrusts this text to a ruler of virtue to show to ordinary people. Now that the qi of Great Peace has arrived and Heaven promotes goodness, all are made to delight in goodness, and none may again take pleasure in inauspicious affairs without cause. Those who delight in inauspicious affairs make themselves enemies of Heaven and bring blame upon Earth—their transgressions cannot be erased. Today, those in Heaven name such people who delight in inauspicious affairs as great rebels. The baleful qi of Heaven and all the blames within Earth will descend and converge upon them.\n\nShould an urgent matter arise suddenly and one must perform music for an auspicious affair, yet there is no time to await the ascendant qi of the proper region or the hour of the Dipper’s culmination, what then is to be done? Excellent indeed is your question, for it grasps the essential meaning. In such a case, have the musicians reside in the region of ascendant qi. If they cannot reside there, let the musicians and the assembled people all face the ascendant direction and make their request. They should employ the same tones and the same numerical correspondences. Even if only the person’s surname and given name are used, holding the pitch pipes and calendrical calculations, so long as the tones and qi resonate in accord, one may follow the time of ascendant qi and have them perform the music—this too is permissible. In this way, all acts in accordance with the teachings and commands of Heaven and Earth, and no disasters will arise. To act otherwise is to align with the qi of baleful prisoners, and all manner of inauspicious affairs will arise.\n\nMoreover, when raising voices in song or leading music, one must also employ the auspicious—auspicious tones and good affairs. The qi of ascendant and prosperous phases is like a ruler among men; it does not wish to hear of inauspicious affairs, inauspicious words, or inauspicious tones. The reason is this: the qi of ascendant and prosperous phases serves as the agent of August Heaven, presiding over generation and completing good affairs, thereby aiding Heaven in the generation and completion of all things. Evil tones and inauspicious affairs do not aid Heaven in the generation and completion of all things. Thus, the qi of ascendance does not wish to delight in hearing them, nor does the qi preceding the Dipper’s culmination. Therefore, the sage-king emperors of antiquity all accumulated good words and good deeds, never admitting inauspicious and evil affairs. Such words were called \"ominous speech,\" and the crime was punishable by death. Even if the crime did not warrant death, they were killed simply for the ominousness of their inauspicious speech. Does the perfected one understand the severity of this prohibition?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nAh, how solemn! Ah, how solemn!\n\nTo know early and be alarmed ensures long preservation; not to know is the root of death. Let me expound:\n\nFirst, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ imperial qi, and by amplifying the joy directed toward Heaven threefold, Heaven is greatly pleased. The imperial ruler enjoys longevity, evil and misfortune are extinguished, celestial disasters and harms are all dispelled, and the qi of the Great Yang does not contend in anger, bringing peace to the realm. Those who know to first move in alignment with and delight in this are supported by the Dao of Heaven, and true spirits emerge. Even those dwelling in hidden caves come forth with joy to aid the upright—how wondrous!\n\nSecond, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ royal qi, and by doubling the joy directed toward Earth, Earth’s qi is greatly pleased and does not contend in anger. This grants the ruler longevity, dissolves treachery, theft, and warfare, and brings prosperity to the realm. Those below all delight in submitting to their superiors, and the worthy emerge to assist in governance. Earth spirits align in nurturance—how wondrous!\n\nThird, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of ministerial and subtle qi, the qi of harmony and balance is greatly pleased. Ruler and ministers, the people all act with reverence, each preserving their place. Thus, flattery, deceit, theft, and banditry do not arise, and the borders are secure. As harmonious qi daily flourishes, royal qi is born, and all things incline toward goodness.\n\nFourth, be cautious never to move or delight in the qi of death and destruction, for it brings severe banditry and many sudden deaths. The realm remains in constant peril, unable to find peace, and malevolent qi and spectral beings proliferate, causing grave harm. When extreme, this is called chaos and disturbance. The qi of utmost yin induces rebellion and inversion—beware, beware!\n\nFifth, do not move or delight in the qi of imprisonment and decline, for it brings much banditry, incarceration, litigation, and a flurry of punishments. Peace becomes difficult, the people harm one another, and chronic illnesses multiply.\n\nSixth, do not move or delight in the qi of decline and cessation, for it brings many ailing and infirm people. It also breeds cunning and deceitful individuals who cheat one another, fosters much slander and strife, depletes the realm’s wealth, and leaves the people impoverished.\n\nDelight in the three upper divisions—imperial, royal, ministerial, and subtle qi—and Heaven, Earth, and humanity are pleased. Timely rains and disasters are dispelled, for this is called aligning with the good qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, thereby bringing forth good affairs. To delight in the three lower divisions—the qi of death, destruction, imprisonment, decline, and cessation—is to invite rebellion and disaster. Heaven’s seasons bring perverse harms in great multitude, which cannot be restrained or prevented.\n\nIf these debased qi are stirred and delighted in, malevolent qi is greatly unleashed. The wise and learned withdraw into hiding, the magistrates lose governance, the people and ministers become difficult to rule, and affairs multiply in chaos. One cannot but guard against and be cautious of this!\n\nAll matters under Heaven and Earth have their fixed and constant laws. Where qi resides, one should face the honored and desire to express joy; where qi is absent, in decline or death, joy is inappropriate. Thus, to delight in goodness is called \"aligning with governance\" in Heaven; to delight in evil is called \"rebelling against decree.\" Those who align with governance gain Heaven’s power; those who rebel against decree gain Heaven’s harm. Those who gain Heaven’s power attain longevity; those who gain Heaven’s harm incur misfortune and calamity.\n\nThe reason is this: Heaven’s governance is like an echo and shadow—it does not wrest away what brings people peace. To delight in goodness is to receive goodness; to delight in evil is to receive evil. What more need be said? Good and evil, safety and peril each follow their kind and do not err—only the foolish fail to consider this.\n\nThus, those who delight in the Dao attract the Dao; those who delight in virtue attract virtue; those who delight in martial prowess attract martial prowess; those who delight in uprightness attract uprightness; those who delight in perversity attract perversity. How could it be otherwise?\n\nTherefore, I have deeply pondered Heaven’s laws to admonish the perfected one. How solemn! Heaven’s laws must not be transgressed. Thus, I earnestly exhort you. Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe reason for amplifying the joy directed toward imperial qi threefold when delighting in the worthy is that imperial qi is most honored and supreme, symbolizing Heaven’s supremacy, hence the tripled joy. Heaven governs and commands Earth and humanity, thus the threefold amplification, symbolizing Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\n\nWhen Heaven, Earth, and humanity are seen to delight in and bring order, all things each attain their proper place. Auspicious signs and good omens—twelve thousand in number—all emerge in full. Thus, one first delights in them.\n\nWhen delighting in them, one should listen attentively with single-minded focus, sit upright in prolonged contemplation, and feel joy and gladness in the heart, utterly content. Be loyal, sincere, and utterly without ill intent, as if sitting before the imperial ruler, daring not to be perverse. Heaven responds to such conduct, and evil, misfortune, and disasters all depart. By honoring Heaven as supreme and imperial qi as authority, Heaven naturally follows the law, and the attainment of Great Peace is not difficult.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe reason for doubling the joy directed toward royal qi when delighting in its harmony is that royal qi symbolizes Earth, and Earth dwells alongside humanity, hence the doubled joy to delight in Earth. When Earth and humanity are seen to delight and rejoice, all things are ordered and attain their proper state. Moreover, Earth is humble, thus its joy is less than Heaven’s.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nFurthermore, royal qi is weaker than imperial qi, humbler by one degree, hence the reduction. The law of precedence between honor and humility is naturally apportioned.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe reason for delighting in ministerial and subtle qi in a single measure is that ministerial and subtle qi symbolize harmony and humanity. Harmonious humanity is humbler than Heaven and Earth, hence its joy is less. Humanity governs and orders all things for Heaven and Earth. When humanity delights, it rejoices in goodness; by doing good, all things are ordered. When humanity does not delight, it does evil; by doing evil, all things meet with misfortune.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMoreover, humanity is the chief of all harmonious things. When the chief delights in order, all things are ordered; when the chief is in chaos, all things are in chaos. Thus, one first delights in the chief to align with and delight in the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nTherefore, the qi of supreme goodness is most honored and good, hence the tripled joy to delight in goodness. Thus, the ancient imperial rulers who governed well and aligned with Heaven’s will gained this multiplied joy—clear evidence of this.\n\nNow the qi of Great Peace arrives, thus teaching the flourishing of joy. When the qi of decline and chaos responds to inauspicious years, joy cannot flourish; if one forces joy to flourish, it is called \"flourishing joy amidst misfortune and decay\"—in Heaven’s reckoning, this is named \"great rebellion.\" Is not the root of disasters and the origin of calamities something to be guarded against with utmost care?\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nTherefore, the next in rank is the kingly qi, whose joy is doubled, yet it does not match the imperial qi, hence its joy is lesser. Thus, those whose governance is only slightly good find their joy diminished. The reason for this diminution is that their qi is weak and not supremely good, so they dare not indulge in excessive joy. Amidst this, inauspicious qi lingers, so they dare not fully express their joy. It is like a household with seven virtues and three vices—though the heart may incline toward joy, this is the meaning of such restraint.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nConsider this: with seven virtues and three vices, where goodness outweighs evil, can one rest in ease and cease rejoicing? Though the human heart may delight, it occasionally recalls the three vices, preventing pure, unalloyed joy—this is the nature of Heaven. Only when virtue is complete, with not a single worry remaining, does great joy arise. Thus, joy is for delighting in goodness, not for delighting in misfortune.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMy words are the luminous contract of Heaven, not erring in the slightest. Therefore, the next in rank is the single joy of the ministerial qi and the subtle qi, which governs minor stability. Human virtue is at its least here, not matching the qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, it is faint and slight, not equaling Heaven and Earth, and so its joy is diminished. The ministerial qi and subtle qi bring minor transformations, governing the central lands where evil often outweighs goodness, so they dare not fully express their joy. To do so would be called \"rejoicing in misfortune and evil.\" Since goodness is scant, their joy is scant as well. The reason for this scantiness is that they only rejoice in the goodness within, not daring to rejoice in the misfortune and evil within. To rejoice in the misfortune and evil within is like a petty person with seven vices and three virtues—can the three virtues alone secure threefold joy? With seven vices, there are instead sevenfold sorrows and afflictions. How can one rest in joy?\n\nThe reason for this lies in the principle of tenfold division: ten is divided thrice. The imperial qi is entirely good in all ten parts; the kingly qi has two parts good and one part evil; the ministerial qi has two parts evil and one part good. Thus, the imperial qi mirrors Heaven, which constantly delights in life, harbors no harmful intent, and desires to bestow blessings. The Three Sovereigns emulated this, ever purely good and kind, without evil or harmful intent. Heaven resembles the Three Sovereigns, and the Three Sovereigns resemble Heaven. Thus, the supremely good person has not a single vice, only ever desiring to do good. Does this not mirror Heaven? Does it not mirror the true spirit?\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe kingly qi mirrors Earth, which constantly nurtures and favors virtue. The Five Emperors emulated this. Though Earth’s nurturing is called \"killing,\" the Five Emperors still employed punishments.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe ministerial qi and subtle qi mirror humanity, which has no constant law and frequently changes. The Three Kings emulated this, having no fixed principles. For harmonious qi shifts and alters, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating, thus there is no constancy in high or low. It observes firmness and follows it; it observes softness and follows it—hence its lack of constancy. The qi of decline, death, imprisonment, and ruin mirrors the myriad things, endlessly changing and chaotic, with no regular pattern of emergence or withdrawal. The Five Hegemons emulated this, their qi disordered and inauspicious, thus they could not possess joy.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is to rejoice in goodness, not to rejoice in evil. The martial power of Heaven and Earth is for punishing evil, not for punishing good. The standards of Heaven and Earth cannot be reversed.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMay I ask about the meaning of \"rejoicing in goodness\"? I wish to hear the great secret, that my foolish heart may fully understand and never again dare to question. Could I be permitted to hear it?\n\nDo you yourself not yet understand?\n\nI have gained some small understanding, but I fear that people of later ages, long sunk in accumulated ignorance, even when given these words, may still fail to comprehend and thus violate Heaven’s prohibitions. Therefore, I dare not refrain from asking. The great secret is easy to know.\n\nExcellent are your words, for you have grasped their meaning. Very well, be seated, and I shall now explain it.\n\nThus, in the most excellent and greatly joyous years, all the myriad things give rise to goodness, and every person rejoices, their hearts ever filled with joy, longing to sing and dance. People silently love one another, never contending, and joy arises of itself. Above and below, none harm or plunder each other, and all delight together. Therefore, joy arises from goodness and rejoices in goodness—Heaven causes this to be so naturally.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nIn the most inauspicious years, not a single thing is good. Every person suffers hunger and cold, weeping and wailing, harming and plundering one another. Silently, sorrow, bitterness, and resentment arise within, and their hearts know no joy. How could they sing, dance, or find delight? Silently, they wither and perish. Thus, inauspicious years and evil times bring no joy—Heaven causes this to be so naturally. This is clear evidence that Heaven does not delight in misfortune and evil.\n\nTherefore, joy arises to celebrate goodness, while martial power arises to punish misfortune. Thus, when the ancient emperors and kings were about to rise, they received the response of joy and goodness; when they were about to decline, they received the response of evil. This is the natural law.\n\nThus, joy gives rise to goodness, and goodness gives rise to joy; misfortune gives rise to joylessness, and martial power gives rise to misfortune. Non-action gives rise to joy, and joy gives rise to non-action. Martial power gives rise to chaos, and chaos gives rise to martial power. Joy gives rise to song and dance, and song and dance give rise to joy. Evil and misfortune give rise to sorrow and suffering, and sorrow and suffering give rise to evil and misfortune.\n\nMay those of later ages who see my words reflect upon and rejoice in them. Here, the explanation of the secret comes to a small conclusion.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nThe five musical tones, when properly activated before and after, align with Heaven, Earth, and humanity in intent, bringing about Great Peace, dispelling disasters, eliminating treachery, and manifesting harmonious qi—thus revealing the great secret.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 116 concludes.*\n\n---\n\n*Tai Ping Jing, Scroll 117*\n**Heaven’s Joy in Obtaining Good People: Text Entrusted to the Fire Lord, Secret 207**\n\nNow, the Perfected One has accumulated goodness and is wise, understanding all matters.\n\nAt this time, the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign’s qi of equanimity has fully arrived, and there is an urgent matter in the heavens—do you, little one, know of it?\n\nThis humble student is foolish and dull, unable to comprehend. I rely entirely upon the Heavenly Master.\n\nVery well. All Perfected Ones, be seated, and I shall fully explain it to you.\n\nNow, the heavens rejoice in obtaining good people, who can regulate wind and rain and bring forth all the myriad things. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who do good have been few, and even fewer have aligned with Heaven’s will. Heaven has long regarded this as a source of sorrow, for now, among the people of the earth, there are none who meet Heaven’s requirements.\n\nWhy does the heavens not simply create people itself, rather than selecting them from the earth below?\n\nThe generation of all things by Heaven and Earth arises from the union of two as one. Now, the heavens above unite with the earth below. The birth of all yang must occur within yin, and thus people are taken from this earth. Moreover, humans contain the qi of both yin and yang, and their procreation must occur in the soil and springs, so they all take after the earth from which they are born. Thus, the customs of the five directions differ, and the world, though small, is not uniform. Therefore, among the twelve thousand states, even the people within a single region do not resemble one another.\n\nDo you understand this?\n\n\"Yes, yes. Those born among humans who are perpetually good are entrusted to their fathers, and thus good people are ultimately entrusted to Heaven. The essence of the myriad things—those that are good ascend to unite with Heaven and become the Three Luminaries. Those of middling quality are entrusted to humans, enabling them to serve, follow the rhythms of yin and yang, and govern the myriad things. Those of lower quality are entrusted to the earth, causing them to walk and labor. Do you, Perfected One, understand this?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Therefore, when Heaven above now desires to harmonize wind and rain, nurture the myriad things, and rejoice in obtaining good people, I have been sent down to select and seek them. With this text, I entrust it to you, Perfected One, to convey to the diligent people, bidding them pass it to the sovereign of fire essence and virtue, so that it may be shown to all under Heaven, that they may together ponder these words of mine. Thus, I entrust it to you, Perfected One—take care never to sever this transmission. Should you fail in this, you will incur affliction. Be ever vigilant in this matter.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nNow, the foolish among the living suppose: Does Heaven above, being boundless and upright, unite solely with this earth below?\n\n\"Excellent is your inquiry! Though Heaven moves above without bound, it too possesses yin and yang, and the two unite as one. Does the earth below also possess such union?\"\n\nIndeed, though the earth moves below without bound, it too possesses yin and yang, and the two unite as one. Thus, one yin and one yang, above and below without end, extending laterally without limit—this is the nature of the Great Dao, the constant law of Heaven. All things take one yin and one yang as their vital axis. This is the art of the Supreme Numinous, operating naturally. The governance of the boundless turns in cycles, returning to its origin, without end or cessation.\n\nI wish to distinguish and set forth the Dao for you, Perfected One, in clear order, that you may fully comprehend it. Thus, I briefly raise its beginning for you, reveal its great principles, and leave you to reflect upon its threads, that the worthy and sagely upon the earth may themselves refine it. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear your teachings.\"\n\"Very well. Commit my words carefully to memory within my teachings, and you shall ascend and rest.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Heaven’s Reproach: Four Who Shame the Dao’s Precepts (Section 208)**\nWhat great abhorrence exists in the heavens above? It is called *Heaven’s Reproach*.\n\nPerfected One, you have studied and practiced for so long—do you not deeply understand this already?\nNow, this foolish one knows nothing of such matters. I wish to hear of them.\n\nIndeed, from ancient times to the present, all who cultivate the Dao take the August Heaven as their model. The most excellent appellation—crowning the unsurpassed, encompassing the boundless, inwardly without interior, outwardly without gap, entering without aperture—serves as the teacher of all affairs under heaven. It is the origin of life, the elder of all matters, the enduring attainment of sages and worthies past and present. It is how emperors and kings secure the heart of Heaven, becoming the parents who bring peace to the people, the source from which all transformations arise.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Dao is Heaven itself—pure and luminous, unwilling to be defiled or shamed. Yet now, those who study and practice the Dao all engage in four ruinous deeds, jointly defiling the numinous Dao of August Heaven, throwing into chaos the principles of Earth, and rendering themselves unfit to lead transformation, to serve as models, or to be parents. Together, they destroy Heaven’s precious vessels. Heaven names them all as *greatly rebellious sons*.\n\nYou dwell upon the earth—if you do not conform to the models of the Dao, how could Heaven, in its tranquility, conform to your models instead? Do you wish to know the truth of this? It is as if a petty man among the common folk does not conform to the models of the Dao. Would he, standing before the emperor, then conform to those models? If one remains below and fails to conform to the Dao’s models, yet Heaven were to cherish him and take him as its model—would this not mean that those in the heavens above and before the emperor would instead be ruled by those who hoard wickedness? Thus, Heaven above deeply perceives their deviation from the Dao, not out of deliberate malice in reproaching them.\n\nNow, as the Primordial Qi of the Cavernous Upper August arrives, it will no longer tolerate these four kinds of people. These four cause both Heaven above and Earth below to despise those who practice the Dao, instead branding them as *evil sons*. This is why the human Dao daily declines and fades, resting in decay without revival. Today, all under heaven commit evil—this is precisely the ruin wrought by these four.\n\nHeaven above greatly abhors and reproaches them, and thus seeks to select seven others instead.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nThis foolish one’s nature is dull and slow—I still do not comprehend. What does this mean? I wish to hear of it.\nIf you do not immediately grasp this, what hope is there for the common people?\n\n\"Very well. Open your ears and listen closely. I shall set forth in detail for you the origins of the Dao’s great flaws and diseases, so that later learners may clearly recognize their deviations from the Dao.\n\nThe first is *lack of filial piety*.\nThe second is *failure to preserve one’s true nature*, leaving no posterity of their kind.\nThe third is *eating feces and drinking urine*.\nThe fourth is *acting as beggars*.\n\nThese four kinds of people jointly defile the true Dao of Heaven, utterly unfit to inspire transformation or to serve as models for Heaven above and Earth below through the ages. Even if they were to attain the Dao and ascend to Heaven, when Heaven examines them, they would be found wholly wicked. Today, they cannot regulate the winds and rains, bring forth the myriad things, or serve as teachers and elders. How lamentable! How lamentable!\n\nThis humble one is deaf and blind—I have never known my offenses against Heaven. Now, only the August Heaven and luminous teachers can grant me further clarity. I beg you to explain in detail and distinguish them clearly, that I may gain understanding and enlightenment.\"\n\n\"Very well. Listen carefully, and I shall fully expound their meaning for you, Perfected One, so that it may serve as a model for all ages to come. Let later learners, earnest and good, who practice the Dao no longer transgress Heaven’s prohibitions, enabling them to attain the Dao and ascend to Heaven, where Heaven will rejoice in them. It is like when the Earthly Thearch and kings find good people to govern with them—they too rejoice.\n\nThus, what Heaven above advances, Earth below likewise does. Is this not excellent?\"\n\"Yes, yes. I have received your instruction.\"\n\nThe Dao is the teacher of August Heaven, the most precious treasure of Heaven. Those who practice it must conduct themselves as if formed by Heaven itself. The Dao ought to be practiced with utmost reverence, for Heaven cherishes and employs those who do so. Yet now, some who have erred and attained the Dao ascend to Heaven, only to be received with inquiry—only to reveal conduct lacking in reverence and filial piety. The Dao is the foremost transformer, and Heaven serves as the model for humanity. How could it reverse its role to shelter and nurture the irreverent and unfilial of the world? If a child harbors such evil conduct, how could Heaven deem it fitting to grant this person longevity and share its work? Would Heaven instead take such a rebellious child as its master? Even on Earth, such a person would not be employed—how could Heaven employ them? Thus, no one who is unfilial and practices the Dao has ever ascended to Heaven. Though they may depart, they are all deceived by malevolent spirits and treacherous ghosts. They will dwell in death upon barren lands, in desolate wilds, their forms punished. Heaven’s response to humanity is as swift as an echo—how could evil conduct yield good reward? Such cases are rare in past and present. Though many on Earth have practiced the Dao, few have been deemed worthy. Now, in Heaven, there are few good people, none with whom to share its work—their conduct is entirely wicked. Why does Heaven not immediately destroy them, instead consigning them to barren lands, to uninhabited wilds where breath ceases? It does not immediately annihilate them because between Heaven and Earth, qi gathers in abundance, fostering harmony—this is called the balanced harmony of the center. It is like human harmony, which encompasses all without exception. Thus, Heaven temporarily tolerates them, for Heaven governs with clarity and brightness, like standing before an imperial sovereign—it cannot harbor the wicked. Therefore, Heaven does not employ such people in its governance, nor does Earth. Heaven does not employ the irreverent and unfilial, just as a sagely king does not employ the irreverent and unfilial. If even a sagely king refuses to govern with them, how could Heaven alone do so? The ancient sages and worthies did not govern with such people because they deeply observed Heaven’s laws and modeled their conduct upon them. To govern with the foolish would incur Heaven’s great resentment. How do we know this? When a ruler governs with such people, Heaven manifests many disasters and omens, and the barbarians frequently invade—this is clear proof of Heaven’s hatred. Is this not as unchanging as the compass and square, as binding as a contract? Now, if even humanity detests and despises such people, how could Heaven itself employ them? What humanity hates, Heaven also hates; what humanity cherishes, Heaven also cherishes. Thus, the ancient worthies and sages deeply understood Heaven’s will and always modeled their conduct upon it, not daring to deviate even slightly. Therefore, they alone enjoyed Heaven’s favor and gained its heart. If one does not align with Heaven’s heart, one does not gain it—and great misfortune follows. If human conduct is already thus, how much more so for those who would become Heaven’s chosen officers? Heaven’s chosen officers must work alongside Heaven, governing the boundless arts. They must join forces for eternity, harmonize their qi with one heart—how could a Perfected One be remiss in this? Be vigilant! My words embody the pure will of Heaven—do not transgress them. Those who transgress will die. □□! Excellent, excellent!\n\nThe foolish student’s heart holds but a single good understanding in this. You, too, should refine even this single good understanding—common people do not grasp it, lost in their dark and muddled confusion. Heaven detests this, and so has sent me down to proclaim the great teaching, fully revealing Heaven’s laws. From this point onward, let all learners take heed and be vigilant.\n\nNow Heaven values and esteems the transmission of life in succession, so the four seasons receive Heaven’s Daoist instruction, passing life onward to generate and complete, without end. Thus do all things flourish and endure. Therefore, Heaven is named the Father of Generation, Earth the Mother of Nurturance. Following the qi of the Six Jia, Twelve Branches, and Eight Trigrams as their guiding principles, they take turns generating and employing one another. Thus, the Dao of Heaven remains eternally present, never destroyed or ruined—this is the constant work of its transformative power.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao must be pure and take Heaven as their model. Yet many, though outwardly pure, leave no posterity, jointly extinguishing Heaven’s lineage. The steadfast among them still uphold Heaven’s nature, but their qi is insufficient. The unsteadfast force the matter, obstructing and blocking the Dao of yin and yang. Scattering their seed across the four wilds, some even abandon and kill, leaving their wives and children destitute—these are all people who greatly destroy and lose the Dao. They are unworthy of emulation, beings of great misfortune in every fraction, unfit to serve as teachers or models for others. How could they possibly align with the laws of the Heavenly Master?\n\nThe August Heaven is the elder of all affairs, the parent of humanity, the model from which all sages under Heaven take their pattern. Why would one act recklessly, losing the Dao and behaving without posterity, to serve alongside such a one? If Heaven were to govern jointly with such a person, Heaven would be named a master who shelters evil, promoting inauspicious arts—how could this be called sagely, how could one serve as a teacher above others? Therefore, Heaven does not tolerate or cease to stop them.\n\nThe ancient sages and great worthies knew well to avoid such transgressions, refusing to govern alongside those without posterity, for in doing so, they would fail to gain Heaven’s heart. Thus, the sages and worthies—whom Heaven causes to be esteemed and to have posterity—jointly detest those without posterity. The sages deeply understood Heaven’s will and always modeled themselves upon it, not deviating even slightly. How much more so for Heaven itself?\n\nNow, for a long time, there have been no good people above in Heaven, so I have been sent down to proclaim these great words, to instruct and admonish those who come later, that the foolish may all come to know. If those above in Heaven employ such people, would Heaven above not instead become a host for those without posterity? Acting in this way, would one ascend to Heaven? Would Heaven above love those without posterity and not favor life? Thus, all such people die in barren lands, lifeless soils, and desolate wilds where no one dwells, each sent to return to their own kind. You do not favor life, opposing Heaven, so you are cast into places where nothing grows. You delight in desolation, so you are cast into wilds where no one lives.\n\nCommon people, blind and unseeing, claim they have already transcended the world—this is not true. I dare not deceive the Perfected One. I have personally descended after journeying above in Heaven. Whether one sees or not is like showing the sun to the blind—telling them they are being deceived, they cover their mouths and laugh. Fools are just like this. Perfected One, be vigilant! What Heaven above detests, those above also detest. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThe foolish student has never before witnessed such matters of Heaven above—only now has he truly awakened to this. You must strive to perform good deeds. My writings heal the illnesses of Heaven and Earth, relieve the sorrows and sufferings of emperors and kings. When your merit is complete and you ascend to Heaven, you will see for yourself—the efficacy of my words will be greatly proven. Indeed, indeed. I dare not delay, nor dare I be remiss. You must be vigilant and not grow lax. If you truly falter and grow lax, your great mandate will be severed. The foolish student deeply fears Heaven’s majesty and sincerely receives and practices this. Excellent, excellent! You have grasped Heaven’s will.\n\nNow Heaven is pure and bright, the Dao is clear and untainted. Heaven and the Dao dwell highest of all, serving as models for humanity. The pure and bright favor purity and brightness, so the Three Luminaries ascend and reside in Heaven, each following its kind, uniting as if forming a single body. Heaven’s form is like a bright mirror, like a person with two eyes that illuminate all, unwilling to see defilement or disgrace. Before a sagely king, one must always desire purity and brightness, unwilling to see defilement or disgrace. If one defiles and disgraces, one incurs the transgression of destruction and death. Perfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nOh, how grave! Oh, how grave!\n\nThus, the human head and mouth resemble Heaven, unwilling to delight in seeing defilement or disgrace, always desiring freshness and brightness, desiring good things. Therefore, when people in the world indulge in filth, disgrace, and evil, feeding such things to others, Heaven sends down thunder and lightning to capture and seize them. Perfected One, do you recognize this as perverse and wicked? Indeed, indeed. This foolish one deeply fears it.\n\nFrom the great central high antiquity to now, people claim to be good, utterly distinct from common folk. Yet those who study the Dao often instruct one another to eat feces and drink urine, calling themselves plain and good people—Heaven and the Dao deeply detest this. In Heaven, such are named the great rebellious children, whose human forms Heaven does not wish to see. These are the marks of great evil, the descent of dog and swine spirits.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to Heaven, and Heaven possesses the Dao, which serves as the teacher and elder for all affairs. The true Dao is that by which goodness flourishes and evil is eliminated. Thus, when ancient sage-kings and emperors were about to rise, they all received the Dao as their teacher, entering to receive its strategies and wisdom, transforming their people. The teacher was honored, and it was said that they could know Heaven’s will and emulate Heaven in their conduct.\n\nIn Heaven, those who follow the good Dao are also revered and esteemed, for it is said they can harmonize with the winds and qi, follow the four seasons, uphold the five phases, regulate wind and rain, assist the sun, moon, and stars in shining brightly, and cause the myriad things to flourish. Now, how can those who eat feces and drink urine serve as teachers?\n\nToday, even earthly teachers fall short, named rebellious children—how could they possibly become teachers in Heaven? Such petty people are profoundly foolish, deeply mired in defiling and disgracing the Dao of Heaven.\n\nPerfected One, having received this ultimate text, ponder its meaning: what the earth below uniformly detests, Heaven above also detests; what Heaven above detests, the earth below likewise does. Thus, when people below detest eating feces and drinking urine, Heaven above also detests it, and so sends down thunder and lightning to strike them dead.\n\nThese words are merely to enlighten those on earth, for Heaven’s detestation is far more severe. If even those on earth abhor this, how much more so in Heaven? Heaven is pure, bright, and fresh—how could it instead gather and shelter those who eat feces and drink urine?\n\nEven if one errs by chance and momentarily attains the Dao, they will not ascend to Heaven. All will perish in the lands of the five wastes, where qi is cut off and fortune fails, to follow their conduct, to manifest their transgressions, each returning to what they sought—no deception here.\n\nPerfected One, if your years have reached their virtuous end, be warned and cautious, setting an example for those to come. When the equable qi of the Supreme August One descends, such evil conduct will find no refuge—death for transgression is clear indeed.\n\nOh, how grave! Oh, how grave! Perfected One, do you understand? If you do and yet allow it, you share in the guilt. If you know and still persist, the sin cannot be absolved. Indeed, indeed. I dare not, I dare not.\n\nNow the nature of the Supreme August Heaven is ever to bestow and grant—thus it presides over giving, over bestowing, over engendering, over nurturing. It governs emergence, not reception; it governs triumph, not submission. To submit is to act in rebellion. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven cannot be coerced by force, for coercion and duress bring about the ruin of humankind.\n\nHeaven presides over goodness, over clarity and luminosity; it takes no delight in witnessing stagnation, defilement, or disgrace. Now the gift of Heaven and the Dao is called the \"Peerless Appellation.\" Thus, emperors and kings model their conduct upon Heaven, styling themselves \"Peerless Sovereigns.\" They dare not lose even a fraction of Heaven’s way—adherence brings fortune, while deviation brings great misfortune.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao to attain longevity must purely emulate Heaven. Heaven delights in life; therefore, those who seek longevity must purely guard Heaven’s primordial life-generating qi, and their conduct must follow the intent of the Dao of Heaven. As for Earth, it presides over disgrace and destruction, over concealment—one must not follow Earth’s intent.\n\nThe Dao is the root of the great transformation, the teacher and elder of the great transformation. Thus, nothing under Heaven comes into being without emulating it. Yet now, petty and foolish men who seek the Dao bring no benefit to the people; instead, they collectively defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven. Their rebellion is extreme and without form. In Heaven above, they are named \"rebellious sons,\" men of great misfortune—Heaven does not wish to see them.\n\nWhat does this mean? The foolish generate knotted, closed-off hearts, and thus have not yet attained it.\n\nExcellent indeed is your question! Heaven has prompted your words—open wide your ears and listen attentively.\n\nDoes not Heaven and the Dao favor bestowal, favor life, and favor praise? Why then do they not divine with hexagrams, dispense medicines, and bring benefit to the people, allowing spirits to govern humanity so that illness may surely cease? These three kinds of men may all be called masters, yet they do not profit the Dao of Heaven, nor dare they defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven does not deceive; it ever demands utmost sincerity. If one deceives with the pretense of not deceiving, in time, day by day, misfortune and decline will follow. The Dao of Heaven does not delight in defilement and disgrace, nor does it desire to benefit others. Heaven is supreme above all, and the Dao is yet more exalted—it is the teacher and model of the Heavenly Sovereign, loftier even than Heaven. Thus, Heaven and the Dao preside over cultivation and rectitude, ever leading in all affairs. Thereby they harmonize yin and yang, regulate wind and rain, rectify day and night, and array the ranks. Between Heaven and Earth, none fail to receive grace and destiny, each attaining its proper place.\n\nYet now, petty and foolish men who pursue the Dao instead engage in deceit, arrogance, delusion, and madness. Together they confuse and disrupt the Dao of Heaven, ruin the primal transformations of Heaven, and turn to begging for others’ possessions, bringing no benefit to the people. They defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven. Though they claim to benefit the common folk, they cannot serve as models for teachers. Instead, they lead later generations to teach one another the Dao, causing people to become deluded, arrogant, deceitful, and defiled, resorting to begging. Thus, their conduct is named the Dao of the deluded, arrogant beggar. They cause all people to revile Heaven together, to despise the true Dao, and to sever the great transformation. Heaven deeply abhors them; the Dao deeply detests them. Heaven above does not wish to see their form.\n\nNow, the Supreme Sovereign of Heaven has sent forth the great rectifying qi. The sun, moon, and stars are arrayed in order, all reverently illuminating the Dao and Heaven. They regulate wind and rain, harmonize yin and yang, and cause the myriad things to each attain their proper place. Yet those who previously chanced upon the Dao and ascended to Heaven found no office there. Heaven questioned them and found them full of transgressions, unfit to serve together. You all dwell upon the earth and are still called deluded, arrogant beggars—how could you be fit to serve as teachers to emperors and kings, let alone as teachers in Heaven above?\n\nHeaven abhors them; the great Dao declines and falls into ruin. The fault lies with the people of later ages who, in learning from one another, lost the proper standards. Heaven is afflicted by this, deeply grieved. The Dao of Heaven is obstructed, and thus it has sent me down to discuss with the Perfected One and distinguish the gains and losses of the Dao. It delights in the awakening of all under Heaven, that they may together know the intent of Heaven above, reform their conduct, transform their hearts, and no longer transgress Heaven’s prohibitions. Then those who study will succeed. If they persist in their former ways, Heaven will not raise them up.\n\nThey shall surely return to die in the land of the five disgraceful things, their lives consigned to the five defiled soils, cut off in the desolate wilds of delusion and madness. Above, there are no Three Luminaries; below, no fertile earth. Why is this? I wish to hear: how grave is their transgression? It is not that they are punished without cause. The Dao of Heaven serves as the law, and each follows its kind—this is the deprivation from below.\n\nWhy then are they not immediately killed, but instead brought to this? If they were to be instantly destroyed, they would claim to seek long life and profess utmost faith. If they were to be killed outright, they would weep to Heaven and wail to Earth, calling themselves deeply wronged, yet unaware of the source of their transgressions. Thus, Heaven examines and tests them, later casting them into the land of the five disgraceful and deluded things, that they may come to know themselves.\n\nDo you wish to know the truth of this? It is like a wise king examining a person’s transgressions and holding them accountable—not immediately killing them, but rather, according to the severity of their crime, sending them to prison. Great crimes go to great prisons, small crimes to small prisons, where they are governed until the person submits, comes to know their fault, and dies without resentment or complaint. If their words are not thoroughly examined, they may protest their innocence, die with grievance in their hearts, and harbor resentment. Thus, the hegemons of the Five Dynasties had many subjects and ministers who died with grievance in their hearts.\n\nDo you now understand that the administration of punishment in Heaven above is like this? Perfected One, do you comprehend? How admirable! How admirable! To know awe and reverence is the gateway to life; not to know awe and reverence is the root of death. Heed my words well—my words are the soldiers of the rectified Heaven. Do not defy or slight them, for defiance brings harm. Minor defiance brings minor harm; great defiance brings annihilation.\n\nI caution you, Perfected One: the people of later ages accumulate folly, trusting their ignorant hearts, and say, “It is not so,” thereby bringing ruin upon themselves. I personally traverse the realm above Heaven and know its affairs below—ten thousand times, not one is lost. I dare not deceive you. Though I do not fear the Perfected One, I fear the majesty of Heaven. Thus, my words are trustworthy. That I repeat and emphasize them is to guard against those who might stubbornly err. Therefore, I reiterate to make my words more abundant and refined.\n\nThe affairs of Heaven above are truly distant and difficult to know, so the scriptures are frequently sent down to align with the earth. Good upon the earth is good in Heaven above; evil upon the earth is evil in Heaven above. Thus, when people do good upon the earth, Heaven above responds with goodness; when people do evil upon the earth, Heaven above responds with evil—this is the ascent of their qi. The five qi are interconnected, above and below as one; the six jia are linked, above and below as one. The twelve branches unite above and below, and none, whether near or far, fail to communicate. If below is good, above is bright; if below is evil, above is inauspicious.\n\nThus, the Five Phases arise below, and the Five Stars shine above. This is how Heaven enlightens the people under Heaven—all Three Luminaries are likewise. Heaven above and the earth below are connected through the Three Luminaries. When the Three Luminaries shine below, so too in Heaven above; when Heaven above is bright, so too upon the earth. The two respond to one another, harmonizing to form the warp and woof. What is greatly good in Heaven above is likewise upon the earth.\n\nJust as Heaven possesses the six jia and twelve branches, so too does the earth; just as the earth possesses the six jia and twelve branches, so too does Heaven. Thus, above and below ever correspond, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. O Perfected One, be vigilant in this. Though My words may seem distant, guard against concealing them; show them to learners, but transmit them only after fasting and purification. Be vigilant.\n\nFollow the text as law; do not recite it in darkness.\n\n“Yes, yes. I humbly ask: since the Middle Antiquity of the Most High, among those who taught the Dao, many abandoned their homes and forsook their kin, cast aside wives and children, and feigned madness—begging, eating filth, drinking urine. Later learners, following their example, passed these practices down as teachings, each with its own master and method, yet none were empty or careless.”\n\n“Excellent is your challenging question, for it exposes their perverse intent. Does Heaven despise them, that you ask this? How cunning their words—why do you raise this? Long have I wondered at this, yet none dared ask directly, ever holding it in silent distress. Excellent indeed! Has Heaven truly appointed you to raise this matter?”\n\n“Very well. Open your ears, and I shall distinguish and explain it for you. When the Supreme Heaven first revealed the true Dao, it was not like this. All practiced filial devotion to their parents, maintained descendants with wives and children, kept proper appearance, and were not mad—nor did they eat filth or drink urine. All their actions accorded with the Dao and moved within its laws. The highest adepts became teachers and assistants to emperors and kings, transmitting and nurturing their kind without harm.\n\nAt that time—like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—they acted by the true Dao, striving to benefit and never to harm or injure. Thus, they practiced the true Dao openly, without concealment. But when the Three Kings brought chaos and the Five Hegemons arose, rulers and ministers, the people, all deceived and slighted one another. Hence, they feigned madness, fearing discovery, begging, eating filth, drinking urine—these are the deeds and words of the desperate and destitute.\n\nThe Dao, too, has its cycles of decline and flourishing, like the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons. In later ages, the way of hegemony prevailed: begging, abandoning kin, forsaking wives and children, eating filth, drinking urine—this is the decline of the Dao, the rise of hegemony. Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors often attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven, some through corpse liberation, others by departing in bodily form. The Three Kings lived out their years, but the Five Hegemons gained no true Dao, all dying in battle upon the wilds. Those who now cling to this hegemonic way in the later age likewise perish upon the wilds—this is what it means.\n\nI do not deceive you, Perfected One: this, too, is a hegemonic Dao, no different from the hegemons and kings. How could they ascend to Heaven? Excellent, excellent! The foolish heart of this student is now truly enlightened. I never imagined the Dao could have a hegemonic aspect. Only through the Heavenly Master’s explanation have I come to know this. Truly, truly… how profound! You may be said to have opened my eyes.\n\nI ask: what should learners of today do? Now, the great cycle of the Heavenly Dao is complete and fully prepared. From this time onward, it differs from the past. If one seeks to practice the hegemonic methods of Middle Antiquity, the true Dao will not come. O Perfected One, be warned and vigilant. If you desire long life and joyful existence, study My texts. Lose even a hair’s breadth, and your life will not be whole—how can you fail to guard it?\n\nThe primordial Dao of the Origin-Yuan has arisen; the fire-light practices it. The hegemonic Dao is ended. Though Heaven is vast, it has its own divisions and principles, revealing texts to all people that they may discuss them together. What belongs to the high should be assigned to the high, what belongs to the middle to the middle, what belongs to the low to the low, and what belongs to all—high, middle, and low—should be shared by all. Why do you not see their sincerity and trustworthiness… as if speaking with Heaven?\n\nExcellent, excellent! The qi of the times is now balanced.”\n\n\"How does the Perfected One know this? By seeing that Heaven has personally sent the Heavenly Master to speak, one knows the qi of Heaven is now balanced. Excellent, excellent! You have grasped its meaning. I humbly request to ask one or two more things—dare not speak further.\n\nIn practicing the Dao from now on, where should one seek it? Seek it always in a quiet chamber, without abandoning parents or leaving wife and children. Proceed gradually, ceasing only when seclusion is complete. If one’s inner self is not virtuous yet seeks seclusion, it will bring no benefit—rather, one may die prematurely.\n\nEach must examine their own truth. Act without betraying Heaven. Though one may deceive others, one cannot deceive Heaven. Do not worry that others may act wrongly. Let each govern themselves by this principle. Those who dare not practice the Dao are wicked people, those who seek to deceive and feign. By this measure, not one in ten thousand will err.\n\nIf disciples learn thus, deceit and cunning will vanish, and the good and evil among people will be revealed. This is called *The August Heaven’s Selection of the Worthy*, a text by which the highest may attain transcendence, the middle may serve as counsel to emperors and kings, and even the ignorant and foolish may follow its precepts as diligent commoners.\n\nPerfected One, take heed of this.\" \"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"May I inquire how one who suffers from *pi-lou* may attain the Dao and depart? If the Dao is achieved, one departs—nothing more. If the Dao remains unachieved, one must daily serve one’s parents, protect one’s wife and children, and practice with gradual purity. Each morning, one will come to understand one’s own intent.\n\nThe worthy together uphold this teaching.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n*[Right] The Celestial Selection of the Worthy—On the Flourishing of the Dao and the Severing of Falsehood—enables those who abandon hegemony to extend their lives, ease their minds, dissolve cunning, and uphold filial duty to parents while protecting wives and children.*\n\n**The One Hundred Seventeenth Scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace concludes.**\n\n---\n\n**The One Hundred Eighteenth Scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n**Chapter Two Hundred Nine: The Prohibition Against Burning Mountains and Forests**\n\nI humbly ask the Supreme Master of the Celestial Cavern-Heaven: though this unworthy and foolish student is unworthy of your compassion, you have deigned to reveal the affairs of Heaven—truly, this is beyond what I dared hope. Since you have already granted this, opening the path that allows me to know the matters of Heaven, I wish to inquire: what does Heaven above delight in, and what does it forbid? I seek only its prohibitions. Day and night, I contemplate their meaning, never daring to transgress them, that I may instruct future generations.\n\nExcellent indeed is your question—you have grasped its essential intent. Perfected One, be seated at ease, and I shall expound it for you. This may be transmitted for ten thousand generations, never to fade.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nI receive your command with profound gratitude. There is no need for thanks.\n\nYou inquire on behalf of Heaven and Earth, while I speak on behalf of Heaven—this is no private matter of yours, but a shared public duty. Why then should thanks be necessary? Yet to withhold gratitude would seem to treat the Dao as trivial and the task as easy, burdening the master; while to offer thanks might touch upon taboos, appearing immodest. I merely fear that excessive words and ornate phrasing would obscure the meaning, which is why I limit myself to the Perfected One’s discourse.\n\nWords are the handle of the Dao, the origin of all scripture. Do not be disheartened, for I shall now distinguish these matters for you.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nNow, in the heavens above, the Supreme Sovereign’s Primordial Qi of Equilibrium flourishes in full vigor. The yang sun shines brightly, perverse qi halts and recedes, while upright qi advances. Decay dissipates, and the Dao and virtue align with yang.\n\nHeaven urgently prohibits setting fire to the mountain forests and thickets of trees. Why is this? I wish to hear of it.\n\nIndeed, mountains are great yang, the web of the upper earth, their sovereign. The myriad rooted things—trees are their chief, their ruler, their yang. Fire, too, is the sovereign and chief of the Five Phases, their yang. Three sovereigns, three yangs, when they meet, they mutually diminish one another.\n\nThus, Heaven’s decree urgently forbids burning mountain forests and thickets. If trees are not burned, they remain within yin. Yin is called \"mother,\" and thus leans downward. This is why Heaven causes the branches of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* to first sprout and flourish abundantly. When they flourish, fire reigns; when fire reigns, the sun grows ever brighter. When *bing* and *ding* flourish, *si* and *wu* rejoice. Why is this? I wish to hear of it.\n\nThis is Heaven’s pattern, its nature. When the mother is abundant and reigns, her child assists. When the child assists, it receives qi for a long duration, extending life. Thus, Heaven prohibits this.\n\nWhen yang flourishes, yin’s treachery daily recedes; when yang wanes, yin’s treachery daily rises. Thus, the cunning and deceitful always emerge in the depths of night—this is the great proof of treachery arising when yang wanes. Therefore, Heaven desires to eliminate treachery and so prohibits this. Such is the natural method and law.\n\nIn the heavens above, it is thus; on earth below, it is also thus.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nI ask: when the Three Yangs align, why does misfortune and decline follow?\n\nExcellent indeed, your question—you have grasped its essence. Now, the Three Yangs correspond to the yang of Heaven, the yang of Earth, and the yang of Man. All three are entirely yang, without a trace of yin; all three are rulers, without a single minister; all three are male, without a single female. This is the path to annihilation, the Way without posterity. It dares not transmit its kind, nor can it mutually generate and complete—hence, it is inauspicious. This is what is meant by having Heaven but no Earth, having the sun but no moon, having above but no below, having exterior but no interior. In Heaven, this is called the *Record of Established Ruin*, and thus it is detested and prohibited.\n\nExcellent indeed. Though foolish, I have ventured to ask this, and I am deeply wary of it. You who know wariness—this is the root of life. Those who do not know wariness—this is the gate of misfortune.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**Method of Burning the Lower Field’s Weeds, Two Hundred Ten**\n\nI ask: regarding the weeds of the lower field, may they be burned?\n\nHeaven does not prohibit burning them. They ought to be burned.\n\nBut why ought they be burned? I wish to hear of it.\n\nNow, weeds are the yin of wood and correspond to *yi*. Wood corresponds to *jia*. *Jia* is yang and of the same kind as wood, hence they correspond. *Yi* is yin and of the same kind as weeds, hence it corresponds to *yi*. *Yi* fears metal, and metal injures wood; when wood is injured, yang declines, and when yang declines, false treachery arises—thus, they ought to be burned.\n\nMoreover, Heaven says: *yi* is yin, weeds are yin, and the lower field is the yin of earth. When the Three Yin align, they instead jointly generate treachery. Thus, the Dark Warrior dwells in the northern pole of yin, and when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born anew. Fire is yang, and when yin obtains yang, it follows auspiciously, generating good affairs. Therefore, Heaven instructs: burn the weeds of the lower field to please yin and invigorate yang—thus, burn them. This is also the way of Heaven.\n\n*Jia* is the wood of Heaven. *Yi* is the weeds of Heaven. What then are *yin* and *mao*?\n\nNow, *yin* is also yang and the wood of Earth. *Mao* is yin and the weeds of Earth. These four all move eastward. Yet yang is called wood, and yin is called weeds—this is the natural law, the classic of Heaven. I dare not deceive the Perfected One.\n\nYou inquire of Heaven’s affairs to resolve doubts, and I expound Heaven’s affairs. Together, we share this duty, jointly ordering yin and yang, removing the ailments of Heaven and Earth, ensuring the Emperor knows no sorrow, and enabling the twelve thousand things to each find their place. None will fail to emerge joyfully, and there will be no grievances or entanglements.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nPeradventure, the Perfected One may be said to have grasped the Dao.\n—Not at all, not at all.\nYet in learning and inquiring of the Dao, what offering should there be?\n—Indeed, indeed. I strike my breast and heart, never to depart from it.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed. In learning and inquiry, you have attained its method.\n\n**Heavenly Spirits Examine Transgressions and Adjudicate the Threefold Concord: Scroll Two Hundred Eleven**\n\nNow, the harmonious and equable qi of Heaven descends in goodness, yet I ever fear that the people may, through misfortune, violate the seasonal ordinances and harm it. Today, all the spirits of Heaven jointly record those who delight in killing and wounding, the sons who hunt, shoot, fish, and trap, those who defy the Dao of Heaven and do no good, those who habitually take life and inflict harm. Heaven deeply reproves them; Earth deeply abhors them; the host of spirits deeply condemns them.\n\nI now fear that petty men, accumulating folly, can no longer be restrained, and together they pollute and disrupt the pure, equable qi of the Cavernous Emperor. Thus, Heaven’s great urgency compels the deployment of all spirits to record their deeds, following their actions day by day, noting even the slightest transgressions for examination.\n\nThree years, including intercalary months, constitute one intermediate reckoning; five years, one great reckoning. Those with grave transgressions shall be held accountable; those with minor faults shall have their years diminished and their allotted spans curtailed. Every three generations, a great reckoning is conducted; every five generations, annihilation follows. Therefore, today Heaven gathers the documents of the Three Dao, and all spirits jointly record transgressions, severing the propensity for killing, wounding, and penal punishment—while fostering joy, the same holds true upon Earth.\n\nFortunate is the Perfected One who cultivates goodness, ever desiring to render virtue unto August Heaven and pity the Emperor’s sorrows and afflictions when the seasonal qi are discordant. The true fault lies with those who delight in killing and wounding, hunting, shooting, fishing, and trapping, who together promote penal punishment and habitually harbor intentions contrary to Heaven and Earth. Thus, long-standing disorder and disharmony persist, and Emperors past and present have incurred sorrow and affliction—this is a grievous transgression.\n\nFortunate is the Perfected One who ever seeks to render merit unto Heaven and grace unto the Emperor. Today, Heaven accumulates its virulent toxins. The host of spirits instructs me in these words, and thus I now entrust this document to the Perfected One, to return it to the virtuous ruler and display it throughout the world. Let each person who receives this text deeply reflect, pondering their faults and heeding its words.\n\nToday, the harmonious and equable qi of Heaven descends in full, yet it does not favor those who harbor malice and treachery. Knowing that Heaven holds these words, how dare I not transmit them below? To remain silent would be to become complicit in malice and treachery, bringing harm upon myself—I dare not transgress. Therefore, I report these matters. All Perfected Ones, take heed.\n\nIf the Perfected One does not speak, harm shall befall you. If you display this to the common people and they, in their folly, violate it, harm shall befall them, and Heaven shall no longer hold the Perfected One accountable.\n\nFrom this day forward, Heaven shall mobilize the host of spirits to conduct examinations and govern the people. In Heaven, the Three Dao gather and circulate documents to record transgressions; the spirits, too, circulate documents of the Three Dao to record transgressions; thus, people likewise circulate documents of the Three Dao to record transgressions. Therefore, people take their pattern from Heaven, Heaven takes its pattern from people, and Heaven, Earth, and humanity each have their affairs. They emulate the numinous spirits and likewise model their affairs upon their methods.\n\nThus, the spirits and qi of ghosts admonish humanity, and admonition is ever present. Heaven, Earth, and humanity act in unison. Therefore, spirits respond to Heaven’s qi and act; refined beings respond to Earth’s qi and arise; ghosts respond to human governance and contend. These three are the agents of harmony and disharmony in Heaven and Earth, moving in accord with the spirit-qi, responding to the seasons in their comings and goings, traversing the Cavernous without interruption, their movements and abodes difficult to discern.\n\nThus, today the Dao of Heaven transmits governance, differing from ancient times. To divine the present by the past often misses the mark; to divine the past by the present no longer accords. Therefore, ancient texts have declined and are difficult to employ; their use seldom hits the mark. Yet there are places where true and authentic texts are gathered.\n\nThus, Heaven speaks of \"adjudication and examination.\" Former and latter, threefold concord: the median goodness is taken to clarify affairs and align intentions. Only then is the Dao of Heaven rectified, the kingly Dao complete, all evil and wickedness expelled, the Emperor greatly joyful, and affairs at peace. People, through their own caution, attain Heaven’s intent.\n\nPerfected One, do you grasp the gravity of these matters?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nExcellent. You have comprehended its meaning.\n\nThe right [section] concerns Heaven’s prohibition of fire to foster life, the cessation of punishments that wound and kill, and the halting of hunting and archery that violate the seasonal qi—all recorded here for posterity, knowing that at the Vermilion Beginning, the talismans were received and the texts renewed.\n\n*Thus concludes the one hundred eighteenth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Begins the one hundred nineteenth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n\n**Three as One Household: The Yang Fire, the Number Five, and the Secret Second Hundred Twelve**\n\nThe lowest of the foolish, born with a single wish, now asks: Today, the Dao of Heaven is complete, encompassing all without exception. What does Heaven observe, and why does it suddenly desire all life to flourish while urgently enforcing punishments?\n\nExcellent, your challenging question has grasped its essence. I have always deeply cherished your words, for they constantly rouse my intent and cause the Dao to flourish. If even you cannot pose such a difficult question, who else could? Thus, the Dao of Heaven has long been severed, blocked, and cut off, causing Heaven great distress and suffering. I have long been despondent, wishing to speak but having no one to address. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven has lost its proper order for ages—year after year, until now.\n\nHeaven’s course has brought forth a sage to speak, yet none have fully dispelled its afflictions. Thus, it has caused the Perfected One to come before me, and only now do I have the chance to fully expound for Heaven. Your questions alone deeply align with Heaven’s intent. Sit calmly, and I shall thoroughly expound the Dao for you. I wish not to speak, but I fear Heaven’s majesty. Therefore, when you ask, I am compelled to speak without concealment.\n\nPerfected One, do you also understand this?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nAh, you have comprehended it well.\n\nNow, the reason Heaven above strives to foster and nurture all life while urgently preventing harm and injury lies in the Dao’s constant regulation of the three qi. The first favors generation and is called yang; the second favors completion and is called harmony; the third favors destruction and is called yin. Thus, Heaven presides over generation, humanity presides over nurturing and completion, and what is completed is called destruction—destruction that conceals. Heaven, Earth, and humanity share this work together, their tasks mutually dependent. Without yang, nothing is born; without harmony, nothing is completed; without yin, nothing is destroyed. These three are interdependent as one household, jointly bringing forth the twelve thousand things. Yet the Dao of Heaven encompasses beginning, end, and middle.\n\nNow, since the Dao of Heaven first arose, it has completed a great cycle and returned, presently aligning with humanity and yang. Yang favors generation and abhors destruction; what is generated requires joy to unite hearts in mutual growth. Yet if destructive qi intrudes, it causes injury and prevents generation and completion. If you wish to know its truth, consider the child in the womb—even slight harm will cause injury and death, and once dead, it cannot be revived. Each loss is one person abandoned, and if such injuries continue unchecked, the line is severed, leaving no posterity, and the household perishes without succession. Thus, the urgency is greatest when punishments and killings occur. The Dao of Heaven is not always like this.\n\nNow, the urgency has grown even greater, and I shall make it clear for the Perfected One to discern, so that people of later ages may fully awaken to the Dao of Heaven. I do not wish for destruction and injury to prevail, which is why I speak so plainly to the Perfected One. Common people follow me only in idle literary pursuits, crafting clever words. Therefore, I shall further present the celestial proofs of punishment and Heaven’s evidence.\n\nNow, the first year of the sexagenary cycle is the celestial norm, when the sun returns to its origin at the winter solstice. The second year is the terrestrial norm, when things spread their roots. The third year is the human norm, when at dawn people rise, open their doors, and attend to their duties. These three together mark the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity—the root of all things. The initial generation belongs to yang, which is the primordial qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Thus, *Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen* reside on the northeast face, with harmony at the center between *Kan* and *Gen*, where yin and yang unite to generate at the center.\n\nTherefore, all who conceive reside in the middle of the abdomen, slightly below the center of harmony. When yang unites, it first generates and sends forth its form and qi, casting them to other regions—this is where the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity first arise, where things renew above and below. There must be no punishments or killings, for qi resides within. When the qi of virtue and yang are established, the myriad things attain their proper generation; if inauspicious qi intrudes, it causes injury. Thus, punishments are cast out.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has completed a great cycle and renewed, with pure yang governing above and below. Therefore, punishments must be urgently abolished. Heaven is called spirit, and yang is also called spirit; thus, Heaven now sends spirits to govern humanity. Perfected One, do you wish to know whether my writings align with Heaven? From now on, those who violate my writings and favor punishments and killings will be examined by Heaven above. People will also urgently condemn them, and spirits will examine them. Heaven above and Earth below, though in different realms, will conspire together; ghosts and spirits, though not of the same household as humanity, will also conspire. This is the arrival of Heaven’s balanced qi.\n\nThe initial qi of Heaven renews above, the initial qi of Earth renews below, and the initial qi of humanity renews at the center. These three qi now begin together, unwilling to encounter the qi of punishment, evil, or misfortune, and desiring only to meet joyful qi. Therefore, from now on, Heaven and Earth will joyfully abolish punishments. Perfected One, do you understand? —Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe foolish and benighted among the living suppose that Heaven swiftly punishes those who do evil by forbidding injury and killing. They do not realize that this concerns the generative qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity— the very root and origin of renewal. Hearing the Celestial Master expound this, I am deeply awed and humbled. To feel such awe and humility is to awaken, to grasp the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Excellent! You who understand these matters, take heed of this text and be careful never to sever it, lest you harm yourself. —Indeed, indeed. —I dare not, I dare not. Go forth and hold it in reverence.\n\nAll who study and inquire do so for their own sake, striving to align with the Dao of Heaven. —Indeed, indeed. Proclaim these celestial prohibitions; do not conceal them. —Indeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask why the Dao of Heaven now establishes this great cycle as the primordial beginning, and why the celestial reckoning precisely corrects the texts at this time? Excellent is your challenging question—it perfectly accords with the mind of Heaven. Now is the ascendance of the Five Yangs, the inception of the Five Fires. The supreme Fire ascends to become Heaven, manifesting as the radiance of the sun and moon. Fire is red, sharing Heaven’s color; Heaven is red, and Fire is red—red is the mark of the numinous. Heaven and the numinous endure eternally, attaining the origin of all things. Thus, the eleventh month is the celestial standard, and so too in the heavens above. Its qi is red, for red is the sun’s returning inception. The initial nine qi belong to *jiazi*, the chief and foremost of the Six *Jia*s. *Jia* is essence, the heart of all matters; thus *jia* emerges first from *zi*, ascending to become the Heart Star. The spirit of Fire is the human heart. The heart of humanity is sacred and numinous, most revered and truly good. Thus, the sacred heart of the numinous can create and initiate all things, serving as their primordial origin. The law of the sacred begins with the heart, and nothing remains unexplained. Therefore, the most flourishing of the red is Heaven, the sun, and the heart—Heaven, the sun, and the heart ever shine, illuminating all without exception. Henceforth, those who practice this Dao will utterly eradicate all that is wicked and perverse.\n\nThe birth of Yang occurs within the depths of darkness. Thus, Yang qi arises in the north, emerges in the east, flourishes in the south, and wanes in the west—such is the law of Heaven. Excellent! May I ask why the birth of Yang now occurs precisely within the depths of darkness? All that is born returns to its origin; only when Yin and Yang unite can generation occur. Thus, all that is born reverts to its initial beginning. When Heaven and Earth were undivided at their first arising, there was neither above nor below, neither sun nor moon nor the Three Luminaries. All was profoundly dark, without division or pattern. Though without division, within it inherently existed above and below, left and right, exterior and interior, Yin and Yang, all mutually sustaining yet undifferentiated. When Yin and Yang first sustained one another to generate life, their emanation was boundless, still undivided. Only after birth did head and limbs become distinct. How do we know that the inception of Yin and Yang, the beginning of generation, was thus? Therefore, when humanity now undergoes transformation to generate life, they all withdraw to secluded, dark places—Heaven ensures they do not forget their origin. The initial reception of Heaven and Earth’s law is humanity’s primal state; thus, Heaven ensures they do not forget.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the August Celestial Master’s words, I now understand the principles of division. You may be said to have been easily enlightened. May I ask why Yang and Fire are uniquely paired? The qi of each phase has its own pairing; Fire is not alone. Metal and Fire are most closely paired, as the chief of the Red Emperor. Does not the *Celestial Strategy* state it thus? *Bingwu* and *dingsi* are the ancestral beginning. \"Beginning\" means first, foremost. Thus, the text speaks of the ancestral beginning. The inception of all things arises from the red heart. The heart penetrates and illuminates, knowing all matters. Yang arises within Yin, also penetrating and illuminating. Water is dark without but bright within, penetrating and illuminating, for it contains Yang essence. Thus, Yang begins in the north, while Yin begins in the south. In the eleventh month, the earth below is warm; in the fifth month, the earth below is cold.\n\nNow, why do Yin and Yang begin not in the heavens above but precisely within the earth? Excellent is your challenging question. The earth is the mother; the father’s essence is bestowed upon the mother, hence within Yin. Its emanation of Yang essence originates equally from Heaven. Yang is the transforming inception of qi, subtle and difficult to perceive. It enters Yin to take form, becoming visible and manifest; thus, its record lies within Yin, not within Yang. Now, when rain and snow fall, they follow the same transformative Dao—visible and perceptible. Why then say that Yang’s subtle emanation is imperceptible?\n\nExcellent is your question! It is difficult to grasp its intent. I wish to explain it clearly for you, Perfected One, but fear that the great form of the Dao of Heaven would become manifest. Yet I fear you would harbor resentment. To be a teacher, to stand above others, is difficult. Please sit calmly, and I shall explain subtly.\n\nWhen Heaven’s rain and snow are about to form, they are but breath and qi. Only when Yin and Yang unite can their emanation become perceptible. At that moment, Heaven’s qi descends, Earth’s qi ascends, and their emanations converge. Thus, rain and snow take form and become visible. May I ask: now, when clouds rise from crumbling mountains, all is visible. Why then say it is imperceptible? I wished not to ask, but my heart was heavy with distress. Now I must ask fully. As your disciple, I am not modest, yet if I do not ask, I cannot attain understanding. Thus, I must ask without hesitation.\n\nVery well. I shall explain subtly, though it cannot be fully exhausted.\n\nYet when clouds and rain shatter mountains, this is the rage of excessive Yin, which cannot restrain itself from harming the transformations of Yang—a dire omen, not a virtuous change. It wounds the Way of transformation, a failure of Yin, an injury to Yin.\n\nPerfected One, do not press further in questioning. The Way of Heaven cannot be exhaustively examined or fully spoken. Ponder its meaning yourself.\n\nVery well, very well. I shall depart.\n\n**The Dao’s Blessing on Three Kinds of People, Secret Teachings 213**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed twice and respectfully inquired of the Heavenly Master about the Dao:\n\nWhen the Qi of Great Peace arrives, who is fit for the Dao? Who is unfit for the Dao?\n\nExcellent, your question is apt. The Dao and humankind are like wind and rain: those who act upon it prosper; those who do not, desist. Those who delight in acting are its people; those who do not delight in acting are not its people. Those who act without strain, who are easily opened and penetrated—these are its people. Those who remain closed and impenetrable, who labor all day without success—these are not its people. To act is auspicious; not to act is inauspicious—such is its people. Those who do not act remain naturally auspicious and free from suffering, yet once they act, they suffer instead—these are not its people.\n\nMoreover, in nurturing oneself, one must examine carefully. The Dao is the tally of the upright. Illness, demonic forces, and malevolent spirits are the pathways of wickedness, thieves who murder good people. When some see others about to enter the true Dao, they grow resentful, quarrel with them, and though they act for the true Dao, they bring misfortune instead of goodness, finding false peace among the mediocre. One must be vigilant and refine oneself: attaining the Dao brings good fortune; losing it brings misfortune. The mandate of life and death cannot be taken lightly or treated carelessly.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your foolish disciple now understands.\n\nSince the Perfected One has asked about these doubts, I shall now impart the essential words of Heaven. The reason my Dao endures and nurtures is that there are those who delight in the Dao, delight in virtue, and delight in benevolence, who disregard worldly affairs and cherish life alone. The Dao rightly endures in nurturing and guarding these two kinds of people. Those who fall below this standard—my Dao does not endure in nurturing them.\n\nWhy is this? The human Dao covers all without exception—why then does it uniquely favor these three kinds of people and not others?\n\nExcellent indeed, your challenging question grasps the meaning. When the Great Dao emerges, all people receive its grace, even grasses and trees—none fail to be transformed for the good, all attain their proper place, and each fulfills its natural lifespan. Those without Dao, virtue, or benevolence cannot be nurtured for long.\n\nWhy? Simply because they do not delight in Dao, virtue, or benevolence. Why then can only those who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence be nurtured for long?\n\nI wish to hear the meaning.\n\nAh, you are perceptive! Your question cuts to the ultimate secret. Listen carefully, and I shall distinguish its meaning for you.\n\nVery well.\n\nThose who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence—these three kinds of people each possess the mandate of the Three Powers. Those who delight in the Dao belong to the mandate of Heaven; those who delight in virtue and nurturing belong to the mandate of Earth; those who delight in benevolence belong to the mandate of humanity. These three kinds of people correspond to the harmony of Yin and Yang, and all have their names recorded in the registers. Thus, the myriad spirits of Heaven declare: “Our scriptures can nurture them.” Those who do not act thus have no record in the registers, and so our scriptures cannot nurture them for long.\n\nNow that the Qi of Great Peace has arrived, there is no favoritism, and so it does not nurture the wicked for long—unlike the past, during times of internal disorder, when it could encompass and nurture evil people.\n\nI wish to hear the full explanation.\n\nWhen the Qi of wickedness and evil arises, it can nurture evil people for long but cannot nurture good people for long, for their harm is great and the good are few. It is like the arrival of bitter cold, when the Qi of heat declines. Now that the upright Qi has arrived, it cannot nurture evil people for long—like the arrival of Yang Qi, when Yin Qi dissipates.\n\nWhen the Great Yang’s crimson Qi ascends, it is the flourishing essence of fire. The ruler of fire shines above as the sun. The sun illuminates and examines the wicked, so they cannot act wrongly—thus, evil people are not tolerated.\n\nMoreover, the Dao governs life, virtue governs nurturing, and benevolence governs the mind’s use of love. Spring brings life, summer brings nurturing, and humanity uses the mind to govern and nurture all things. Thus, the Great Yang’s work of giving life, nurturing, and growth is the most laborious—this is what it means.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your foolish disciple has heard your decree again.\n\nBe seated calmly, and I shall further expound for you.\nVery well, very well.\n\nFirst, in the study of the Dao: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nSecond, in the study of virtue: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nThird, in the study of benevolence: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nFourth, in the study of office: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nFifth, in the love of amassing wealth and property: those who amass much reside in Heaven, those who amass a middling amount reside among the divine spirits, and those who amass little reside among men.\n\nThus, in these five matters—whether of great, middling, or small attainment—all depend on one’s effort. Surrender your fate to Heaven, return your virtue to Earth, and render your benevolence to men. Uphold these three principles.\n\nCultivate the self with a worthy heart and good intentions; ponder and reflect upon them, and the self may be perfected. Accumulate and gather them, and the spirits will naturally arise. Guard and nurture them, and the Dao will naturally be achieved. Delight in and cherish them, and the self will naturally flourish.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is neither partial nor distant; it bestows itself upon the good.\n\nThus, Heaven exerts itself to enact the Dao, completing one cycle each day. This daily cycle follows the pattern by which all things are born, modeling themselves upon the Six Jia, the Five Phases, and the Four Seasons. If even one qi fails to arrive, a thing will be incomplete, and its birth will be insufficient and unbalanced.\n\nFor one who would be a ruler, a superior, or a parent, such imbalance is a grave transgression.\n\nTherefore, Heaven completes one cycle each day, personally overseeing its enactment. It does so because, for instance, if you were Water, and the qi of Water were incomplete, the qi of the Five Phases and the Four Seasons would be insufficient. Thus, Heaven enacts and oversees the cycle:\n\nWhen Jia aligns above, there is the Phase of Wood and the qi of spring.\nWhen Bing aligns above, there is the Phase of Fire and the qi of summer.\nWhen Wu aligns above, there is the Phase of Earth and the qi of the four seasons’ center.\nWhen Geng aligns above, there is the Phase of Metal and the qi of autumn.\nWhen Ren aligns above, there is the Phase of Water and the qi of winter.\n\nWhen the Five Bodies are complete and the Four Qi are established, then all things may be born. When the transformations of Heaven and Earth are evenly bestowed, and the noble and the humble, the great and the small, are as one, there will be no contention or litigation—thus may one be a ruler or a parent.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, virtue, and benevolence must model themselves upon this to align with the will of Heaven. They must not treat themselves lightly or act recklessly.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is thus established as a model—how much more so for man?\n\nTherefore, the superior person models Heaven and embodies the Dao; the middling person models Earth and embodies virtue; the inferior person models man and embodies benevolence. Those who fall below this are no longer counted among men and share the impermanent fate of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees.\n\nTrue person, having received my written teachings, you must deeply ponder their essential meaning. If you follow them without fail, you will harmonize with Heaven and partake in its work. Those who act contrary to my teachings are the enemies of Heaven and Earth, and I shall not tolerate them. What my written teachings revile is precisely what is correct.\n\nTrue person, be vigilant. Transmit this to the superior person, return it to the authorities, and show it to the common people. From this day forward, Heaven differs from ancient times.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThe above distinguishes the proper and improper applications of the *Taiping* writings' esoteric principles.\n\nThus concludes Scroll One Hundred Nineteen of the *Scriptures of Great Peace*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Scripture of Great Peace**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of Great Peace*. According to the *Book of Later Han: Biography of Xiang Kai*, during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Eastern Han, Gong Chong of Langye presented at court a divine book obtained by his master, Yu Ji, at Quyang’s Spring of the Curved Waters. This book was titled *The Scripture of Great Peace and Pure Governance*. The divine book is none other than *The Scripture of Great Peace*, a foundational scripture of early Daoism in the Han dynasty. From the Northern and Southern Dynasties to the Tang, the transmitted version of *The Scripture of Great Peace* comprised one hundred and seventy scrolls, divided into ten sections: Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Gui. Today, only fifty-seven scrolls remain. The base text is from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Great Peace Section.\n\n**Scroll Thirty-Five of The Scripture of Great Peace: The Method for Distinguishing Wealth and Poverty (Forty-First)**\n\nThe Perfected One approached. You have come repeatedly to study the Dao—have you truly mastered it, or is there still more?\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master no longer expounds for you, assuming you have already attained sufficiency. Yet upon hearing the Heavenly Master’s words again, you realize there is still more to learn.\n\nMy thoughts are now exhausted, and I know not what further questions to ask. I only beseech the Heavenly Master to enlighten me on what I have yet to grasp.\n\nCome, Perfected One.\n\nWhat is called wealth and what is called poverty in the world?\n\nIndeed, those who possess much are wealthy, and those who possess little are poor.\n\nYet while your words are correct, they are also not entirely so.\n\nHow so?\n\nIf one possesses much that is false, deceptive, flattering, or stolen, can this truly be called wealth? If the common people are many and the ruler few, can this be called poverty?\n\nFoolish and ignorant as I am, I dare not refrain from speaking upon seeing the Heavenly Master’s teachings, though I fear my words may fall short or err.\n\nYou yourself admit your inadequacy—how then could the vulgar know the true nature of wealth and poverty?\n\nNow, by the Heavenly Master’s command, your disciple, in ignorance, is like an infant who must be taught by father and mother before gaining understanding.\n\nExcellent! Your words are most humble, yet not without merit.\n\nVery well. Perfected One, attend closely, for I shall explain fully.\n\nWealth signifies complete and perfect sufficiency. Heaven deems all things fully produced as wealth and sufficiency.\n\nThus, in the era of the Supreme Sovereign, the qi emerged, and the twelve thousand things were all brought forth—this is called wealth and sufficiency. In the era of the Middle Sovereign, things were slightly diminished, unable to fully produce the twelve thousand things, hence it was called minor poverty. In the era of the Lower Sovereign, things were further diminished from the Middle Sovereign, hence it was called great poverty. Without auspicious responses and the arising of good things, it is called extreme poverty.\n\nWould you know its great effect? Compare it to a farming household: lacking rare treasures or precious goods, it is a poor household. Unable to produce the ten thousand things in full, it is an extremely poor household—this is the poverty of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen the twelve thousand things all emerge and the earth nourishes them without harm, it is the wealth of the earth. If it fails to nourish them well, causing minor harm, it is the earth’s minor poverty. If great harm is done, it is the earth’s great poverty. If good things fear harm from the earth’s form and do not arise, it is the earth’s extreme poverty. Lacking treasures and precious goods, with half the ten thousand things harmed, it is the great cause of poverty. If all are harmed, it is an empty and destitute household.\n\nThis is to take Heaven as father and Earth as mother. If these parents are extremely poor, then their children will grieve in poverty. This corresponds to the governance of kings.\n\nThus, the sagely kings of antiquity were able to bring forth the twelve thousand things—these were the supremely wealthy rulers. If good things were lacking by two-thirds, they were rulers of middling wealth. If lacking by one-third, they were rulers of lesser wealth. Without rare and excellent things, they were rulers of extreme poverty. With half the ten thousand things harmed, they were a declining house. If all were harmed, they were the most impoverished of people.\n\nThe sagely and worthy of old dwelled deep in seclusion, reflecting on the Dao and virtue. What need had they to inquire about wealth and poverty? They knew it all while seated.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in compassion for the long-suffering emperors and kings who cannot realize their aspirations, by what means can they attain this wealth or poverty?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your question is most profound, delving into subtle and essential matters.\n\nIndeed, it is the success or failure of one’s conduct that brings these about.\n\nThose who exert themselves in the true Dao receive the aid of Heaven’s spirits in their transformation. Thus, fertile spirits and good things are fully provided. Those who practice virtue receive the nourishment of Earth’s yang, forests, and springs to assist their governance, hence they are half-wealthy. Those who practice benevolence receive the aid of the harmonious and benevolent spirits, hence they are slightly wealthy. Those who practice civil arts open the path to deception, hence deceitful spirits aid them, and their governance is slightly disordered. Those who practice martial arts receive the aid of thieving spirits, hence their governance runs counter to Heaven’s will and harms the good.\n\nThe Dao is what Heaven follows in its conduct. Heaven is most numinous, hence true spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Earth is nourishing, hence virtuous spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Humanity is benevolent, hence benevolent spirits emerge to aid its transformation. Civil arts govern through literary deception, losing their root, hence deceitful spirits emerge to aid them. When superiors and inferiors engage in literary embellishment, their affairs become disordered.\n\nMartial arts subdue people through punishment, killing, and harm, just as thieves subdue people through punishment, killing, and harm. Those who subdue people through anger, joy, ferocity, and might are thieves. Thus, when thieves abound, governance is inauspicious. Thieves often harm through wealth and goods, hence such governance loses its grasp on material resources.\n\nThus, the supreme rulers of old subdued people through the Dao, greatly winning Heaven’s favor. Their governance was like that of spirits, and they knew no sorrow, for they subdued people through the true Dao. Middling rulers subdued people through virtue, lesser rulers through benevolence, disordered rulers through civil arts, and doomed rulers through punishment, killing, and harm.\n\nTherefore, the supreme rulers of old subdued people through the Dao, virtue, and benevolence, not through civil arts, punishment, killing, or harm. The reason for this is that such methods are base and vulgar. The noble ruler resembles Heaven and Earth, hence Heaven loves life and does no harm—thus is he called ruler and father.",

      "translated_text": "The Earth nurtures all things with care, hence it is called the good minister and mother. People ought to employ a heart of benevolence, loving and fostering as Heaven and Earth do, thus are they called *ren*. These three are good, and so together they govern the myriad things, serving as their teachers and elders.\n\nThose who rely on deceit and punishment cannot govern; daily they bring about misfortune, and cannot bring emperors and kings to Great Peace. Thus, such methods must be severed.\n\nNow, the Perfected One entrusts this scripture to a ruler of virtue and power, that through diligent practice its effects may manifest, aligning with Heaven to achieve Great Peace. This may rightly be called a \"house of abundance\" without doubt, sparing emperors and kings from sorrow and distress, and avoiding the name of a \"house of poverty.\"\n\nNowadays, people commonly speak of a \"house of abundance\"—what does this mean? Such talk is but the reckless chatter of the vulgar. \"Abundance\" signifies complete sufficiency. If even one thing is lacking, it is not truly sufficient.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of old did not demand perfection from any single person, for they knew none could be fully equipped, and so did not impose such expectations. Now, among the eighty-one domains and states, each lacks some things and cannot always be self-sufficient, hence they take from other lands.\n\nWhat true abundance can a single household possess? Perfected One, do you truly wish to follow the vulgar in their reckless speech? I dare not, I dare not. You have studied the importance of cautious speech—do not indulge in idle talk. Idle talk disrupts the proper pattern of Heaven and Earth and cannot serve as a model for people. Be cautious.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in kindness and compassion, pities the emperor on his throne, whose heart is burdened with sorrow and distress, failing to align with Heaven’s intent. Thus, he fully expounds the way to open the path to the Great Peace of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nThis humble student has received many scriptures, yet remains greatly bewildered, like an unlearned child. I know not what further questions to ask. May the Illustrious Heavenly Master fully set forth all the admonitions.\n\nExcellent, excellent!",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Dao of Heaven follows the yang number as one, and the yin number as two—hence yang is odd, yin is even. Therefore, the ruler is few while ministers are many. Yang is noble, yin is base; thus, two yin must together serve one yang. The number of Heaven is one, the number of Earth is two; therefore, two women should serve one man—why must two share the burden of supporting one?\n\nThe side of the noble must not be left vacant. When one acts, another should stand by to attend to what is lacking. Thus, one symbolizes Heaven, two symbolizes Earth, and humanity is the child of Heaven and Earth—therefore, it must emulate its parents.\n\nSince the world lost the Dao, it has scorned and wantonly slaughtered girls, causing women to be fewer than men. Thus, yin qi is severed, no longer aligning with the pattern of Heaven and Earth. The Dao of Heaven decrees that a solitary yang cannot thrive alone, causing Heaven to withhold timely rain. Women correspond to Earth, yet they are universally despised. The world collectively scorns its true mother, murdering and harming Earth’s qi, severing its vitality so that it ceases to produce. Earth grows enraged and displeased, multiplying disasters, preventing the king’s governance from achieving peace.\n\nWhy is this so? Men embody the spirit of Heaven, women the spirit of Earth. Things of the same kind influence one another—if governance is not at peace, the fault does not lie with the king alone. Rather, the common people, having lost the Dao, treat matters lightly and commit wrongs together. Their transgressions are not singular but manifold, making governance difficult to stabilize and leading to disorder.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth encompasses twelve thousand things, yet human life is the most precious. This slaughter of girls deeply disrupts the king’s governance—here lies the greatest calamity.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master opens the path to Great Peace for the king. The true scripture of Great Peace has emerged, allowing the king to wander without care. Yet this harm to girls brings great disaster—what is to be done?\n\nExcellent is your question! You have grasped the heart of Heaven.\n\nThe reason the world despises and reviles women lies in their conduct—where does this fault originate?\n\nI wish to hear it, to record it on bamboo and silk, so that for ten thousand generations it may never be abandoned.\n\nExcellent! If you now record this, the world will no longer kill girls.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI wish to record it to eliminate the king’s disasters—this brings me joy, to save the lives of wronged girls.\n\nExcellent! You have gained the favor of Heaven’s reckoning.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTo save a life is to save oneself; to kill a life is to kill oneself. Heaven cherishes its children—by acting thus, you lengthen your allotted span in Heaven, and the Controller of Destinies alters your register.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nThere is no further refusal—this is the natural law of Heaven.\n\nThe reason the world kills girls is that when people are young, parents fret and struggle, denying them clothing and food while raising them. This is not unique to humans—even creatures that crawl do the same. When they grow old, large or small, each must seek clothing and food according to their strength. Thus, all things eventually leave their parents to provide for themselves. The worthy find joy, the unworthy find suffering.\n\nMoreover, children are young, their strength daily increasing and abundant. Parents grow old, their strength daily waning and insufficient. Whether son or daughter, the wise and strong should repay their parents’ kindness and nurture them. Thus, parents should not be responsible for their children’s clothing and food.\n\nThis is called the weak supporting the strong, the insufficient sustaining the abundant—it is a perverse governance. The young burden the old, offering no benefit to their parents, so parents often kill them. If they kill them for lack of clothing and food, how is that better than letting them live and provide for themselves?\n\nMaster, this truly severs Earth’s lineage—how profoundly foolish the people are!\n\nNow, hearing this, my heart grieves and trembles with fear. I know the wronged are many—what is to be done?\n\nThose who study but lack clothing and food will slacken in their learning, and the Dao will halt. But if they obtain clothing and food, the worthy will study without ceasing. Each should have their own benefit, not be made to return and burden one another.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nWomen have no official positions. A woman joining her husband is like a man taking office—she should obtain clothing and food. When a woman joins her husband’s household, they should unite their strength, work together to sustain life, and jointly transmit the lineage of Heaven and Earth. Until death, their bones and flesh remain together, and they should combine their efforts to secure clothing and food. Thus, the worthy will be joyful, the unworthy will suffer.\n\nIt is like the land: fertile soil yields good crops, and Heaven bestows its favor upon it. Poor soil yields bad crops, and Heaven bestows its favor accordingly, never seizing what grows by its own strength. If Heaven does not seize your labor, how much less should people?\n\nThus, no one will kill their daughters.\n\nExcellent, excellent! A great and deep harm is removed—Great Peace for the emperor is at hand!\n\nMaster, how do you know this?\n\nParents and children share the deepest bond in the world—they must not be distressed or impoverished, nor should they be killed. A mother who kills her child aligns with the qi of bandits and rebels—this is the height of rebellion and the absence of the Dao. Thus, it most deeply disrupts the king’s governance.\n\nIf girls are allowed to live and not murdered or harmed, great joy will arrive.\n\nIndeed, your words are correct. You may be said to understand.",

Some injure them before they are born, cutting them down in the womb. Their grievance and resentment rise to Heaven—how can this be without reason?\n\nThus, I earnestly and repeatedly affirm this truth.\n\nWhen each person relies on their own labor for clothing and food, women will have no divided hearts, their minds will be single, and their work will no longer be hesitant or doubtful.

Thus, Heaven will eventually sever their posterity.\n\nMoreover, all people are born bearing Heaven’s qi in full: the head is round like Heaven, the feet square like Earth; the four limbs correspond to the four seasons; the five viscera to the five phases; the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose to the seven luminaries and three lights. These correspondences are beyond enumeration—only the sage fully understands them.\n\nAll people possess both yin and yang. When the sun and moon are full, the womb opens, and they emerge to gaze upon Heaven and Earth, to grow, and to transmit their ancestors’ lineage, assisting Heaven in generating beings and Earth in nurturing forms. Now, Heaven and Earth’s spirits trust this family, and the spiritual lineage of Heaven and Earth comes to dwell within this person. Yet people harm them, and Heaven greatly blames them. Since people do not restrain one another, Heaven has sent forth this text to show to later generations.\n\nIf, after this matter has been revealed, one still persists in the old ways, this is willful violation of Heaven’s law. Their sin will be doubled, and their lineage will be extinguished without doubt.\n\nMaster, guard this well. Exert yourself, exert yourself!\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow that you have revealed this matter, if you flee and hide this text, you will bear the punishment on behalf of others.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nGo forth, and each of you consider your own fate.",

      "translated_text": "Yes, yes.\n\nHerein is distinguished the conduct of the poor, the rich, and the sovereign—how to establish fortune and forbid the severing of Earth’s lineage, thereby restoring balance between men and women and rectifying royal governance.\n\n**Method of One Man and Two Women, Forty-Second**\n\nThe Perfected One approaches.\nNow, the qi of Great Peace is about to arrive, and the king’s governance nears perfect harmony. Should people uphold chastity or not? How ought one uphold it?\nChastity means moderating desires and refraining from reckless conduct.\nAlas! The Perfected One’s words reveal the errors of common folk since the purest antiquity. Their teachers, consumed by inner jealousy, instead instruct the people in recklessness.\nThe Perfected One asks: What do you mean?\nA chaste man does not emit, and a chaste woman does not transform. When yin and yang do not unite, their line is cut off, leaving no descendants. Two people together sever the lineage of Heaven and Earth, coveting a hollow, false reputation while forfeiting posterity and losing the true kernel. This is the greatest harm under Heaven.\nHad your parents not transmitted life to you, how would you exist? Yet you sever it—this is what Heaven and Earth jointly detest, a person who defies principle and commits great treason. The consequence is that Heaven and Earth become estranged: Heaven refuses to send rain, and Earth refuses to bring forth life. Why? When Heaven does not rain, it is because the chaste do not emit. When Earth does not generate the myriad things, it is because the chaste do not transform. If Heaven does not rain and Earth produces nothing, this is the gravest misfortune under Heaven. How can this be called good?\nConsider the Perfected One’s words: they defy the teachings of Heaven and Earth, reverse the Dao of Heaven, and take no joy in aiding Heaven and Earth’s generation and transformation—instead, they seek to sever it. Do your spoken words not weigh upon the August Heaven and Revered Earth? Even the strong may falter, and those with faults may err. Having heard the Celestial Master’s discourse, do you not recognize the gravity of your transgression?\nI speak to you: no matter should contravene the Dao of Heaven. To follow the words of common folk and defy the will of Heaven—this is why yin and yang are so often estranged, for it stems from disharmony between men and women. Men and women are the root of yin and yang. If governance loses its root, how can it be auspicious?\nNow, Celestial Master, what should be done?\nAs the qi of Great Peace from the Supreme Heaven above draws near, one must purely follow Heaven’s law. Thus, let one man take two women, to emulate yin and yang: yang is odd in number, yin is even. This is the arrival of the qi of Great Harmony.\nIf there are too many women, yin qi flourishes; if too many men, yang qi lacks balance and method, also inviting misfortune. Why? The number of people must correspond with Heaven and Earth. If they do not correspond, their strength falls short, and calamity ensues.\nThe imperial harem corresponds to the land—what does this signify? What the Perfected One has spoken aligns with my words. Women are the spirits of the land, while the king is the spirit of Heaven. The ruler fears that the land may not receive the spirit of yang, causing the king’s qi to fail to harmonize. If the land does not transform and generate, each province must offer one woman to circulate its qi. Delighting in their transformation and generation, the ruler fears that his grace may not extend fully, that his governance may not be complete, and thus takes them in accordance with the land. When grace is universally bestowed, Heaven’s qi flows freely, timely rain falls, and Earth brings forth the myriad things.\nWhen the qi of Great Peace arrives, one must not esteem the chaste. Excessive inner solitude is a profound transgression, causing the king’s governance to lose harmony. Even common people must not exceed proper measure—hence the method of one man and two women.\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nHerein lies the method of aligning with Heaven and Earth’s law, harmonizing yin and yang, ensuring men and women bear no grievances, bringing timely rain, enabling Earth to transform and generate, and achieving peaceful royal governance.\n\n**Method of Promoting Good and Suppressing Evil, Forty-Third**\n\nThe Perfected One approaches.\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace descends, we wish to ensure that the cautious and good daily flourish, while the evil daily recede. Yet there are those who injure and kill, and bandits arise. How should governance address this?\nWhat do you mean? I refer to the immediate resolution of known outbreaks.\nIf the sovereign, seated in doubt, wishes to greatly promote the good and swiftly suppress the evil, and bandits arise, how should they be promptly apprehended? How ought governance proceed?\nPerfected One, you should take careful note. Today, the Celestial Master commands me—how dare I not speak? Yet if my words do not accord with the Celestial Master’s law, why be modest in speaking?\nSince ancient times, great sages have not demanded perfection from any single person. If your words today miss the mark, why be modest?\nYes, yes.\nOne must only reward the good and punish the evil, making the distinctions clear and unequivocal. Then the good will daily flourish, and the evil will daily recede.\nYour words are correct. But do the rewards and punishments lack specific designations?\nI dare not speak further without diligent effort and a single word of instruction.\nNow, may the Celestial Master fully elucidate it.\nVery well. You must remember this, and I shall explain it to you in detail.\nWhen the magistrate arrives at the site of an outbreak, he must summon all the people of the district. Former high ministers and officials shall sit facing east; those learned in the classics and the Dao shall sit facing north; the filial and fraternal shall sit facing west; diligent farmers and cautious youths shall sit in the southeast corner, facing northwest; wicked youths shall sit in the southwest corner, facing northeast; and the sovereign shall sit facing south.\nWhy must they sit precisely thus?\nEach follows their kind—this is the Dao of Heaven, guiding people to establish goodness. How are bandits easily apprehended?\nFormer high ministers and officials are placed in the position of loyalty, for these people, though no longer in office, delight in aiding with righteousness. Those learned in the classics and the Dao are placed in the position of clarity, to illuminate their teachings and assist in scrutinizing evil. The filial and fraternal are placed in their native villages, for the utmost filial piety resides in the heart—thus they return to their hometowns. The filial and fraternal are to remain constantly reverent, as if attending court. Things are born in the east, delighting in daily progress. Diligent farmers and cautious youths are placed in the southeast corner, the direction of growth and nurturance, to delight in cultivating the myriad things without negligence.",

      "translated_text": "Yet when people first receive life and destiny at birth, they partake of Heaven and Earth, embracing primordial qi in its natural state. They neither drink nor eat, but live by inhaling and exhaling the qi of yin and yang, unaware of hunger or thirst. Over time, they drift far from the spirit Dao, gradually losing its guiding intent. Later generations no longer understand this truth, and the authentic Dao lies empty. Day by day, they drift toward falsity, until hunger and thirst arise—now, without eating and drinking, they perish. This is the first great urgency.\n\nHeaven and Earth, in their compassion, provide sustenance for life. Once people begin to eat and drink, the transmission of yin and yang under Heaven’s mandate must not be severed. This transmission should mirror Heaven and Earth, one yin and one yang. Thus, Heaven ordains that each person have one man and one woman, their forms harmonious, so that they may give birth. Why must it be one yin and one yang? When yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin; when yin reaches its extreme, it generates yang. These two alternate in transmission, like cold reaching its limit and turning to heat, heat reaching its limit and turning to cold—such is the natural art. Thus, they perpetuate life endlessly, preserving the celestial lineage through the ages. If men and women do not unite, their posterity will be cut off. If the world has no people, how can there be husbands and wives, fathers and children, rulers and ministers, masters and disciples? By what means would they be born and govern one another? Without male and female between Heaven and Earth, how would transmission continue? All would fall silent and empty—this is the second great urgency.\n\nTherefore, yin and yang transmit the mandate of Heaven and Earth, ensuring boundless continuity. Rulers and ministers govern disorder; sages and their disciples propagate the celestial teachings, aiding the emperor in transforming the world. Thus, sustenance and the union of men and women are the two great urgencies.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has cold and heat, which, if not shielded against, cause half the harm that kills people. Thus, Heaven generates the myriad things so they may be clothed. Without clothing, one might survive in caves or hidden places, but half the suffering would remain, not wholly eradicating death—this is the minor urgency.\n\nWhat is called the great urgency of the Heavenly Dao refers to annihilation and death; nothing is more urgent than this. Without clothing, people cannot properly eat, drink, or unite in yin and yang, nor cultivate goodness. With clothing, the worthy are born; without it, the unworthy arise. Thus, clothing serves only to ward off harm. Therefore, the sages of antiquity did not adorn themselves in dark and bright hues.\n\nSustenance and the union of yin and yang must not be severed; if severed, the world would have no people and could not be governed. Upholding these three—sustenance, union, and clothing—is sufficient to fulfill one’s Heaven-appointed years, transmit the celestial mandate, and ensure that endings give way to new beginnings without end. Thus, the sages of old governed by these principles, discarding all else that was not urgent and invited misfortune. What does this mean? These three accord with the movements of Heaven.",

All crawling creatures receive the governance of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, and are born alike. They share two great urgencies and one minor urgency. What are these?\"\n\n\"When crawling creatures first receive the governance of yin and yang, they all breathe in unison, inhaling the qi of the natural world, yet they do not yet know food or drink. Over time, they drift far from their root, the great Dao wanes, and Heaven’s qi can no longer constantly follow and protect them. Thus, hunger and thirst arise, and Heaven provides food and drink. They, too, transmit the governance of yin and yang, hence the existence of male and female, generation after generation perpetuating life without end. To sever their food and drink, to disrupt the transmission of yin and yang—this would leave the world devoid of crawling creatures. These are the two great urgencies.\n\nThe minor urgency is this: creatures with fur, feathers, or scales may live, yet even bare-skinned creatures survive. Those with fur or feathers are ever gentle and beloved, shielding them from cold and heat. Those with scales ever ward off harm. These are not essential for life, hence their urgency is minor. All other movements are but sources of calamity. Those who do not uphold these three fundamentals, who act recklessly without cause, will surely meet death. This is the natural law suspended between Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Perfected One ought to ponder this intent. Those who uphold these three ways will harmonize with the central harmony of Heaven and Earth. Those who lose these three and pursue many paths will all suffer misfortune and harm.\"\n\n\"Excellent indeed, excellent indeed.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Master having expounded thus, a question was humbly posed: \"Now, what of the rooted plants and drooping branches that neither eat nor drink nor clothe themselves?

      "translated_text": "The right explanation: All things preserve their root and attain the Three Urgencies to prosper; lose the Three Urgencies and suffer harm.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: In Serving the Dead, One Must Not Exceed the Laws of the Living**\n\nThe Perfected One stepped forward.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nA filial child serves their parents—when the parents pass, should they then serve them as they did in life?\n\"No, they should serve them *beyond* how they did in life.\"\n\"Why is that?\"\n\"Through their parents, a person is born and grows to greatness. Seeing their parents die, with no hope of return, the heart cannot forget them even for a moment. In life, they saw each other daily, received teachings and commands, and could repay kindness in return. But in death, they can no longer behold one another, and sorrowful longing fills their thoughts—thus, they should serve them *beyond* how they did in life.\"\n\nThe Perfected One spoke truly, yet this is already a great departure from the true Dao of Heaven, drifting ever farther away. If even the Perfected One’s discourse remains thus, how much more do the benighted common folk err, clearly violating Heaven’s laws.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Master of Heaven.\"\n\"Indeed: a person in life resembles Heaven and belongs to Heaven; a person in death resembles Earth and belongs to Earth. Heaven is the father; Earth is the mother. One must not serve the mother beyond the father. The living are yang; the dead are yin. One must not serve yin beyond yang. Yang is the ruler; yin is the subject. One must not serve the subject beyond the ruler. To serve yin in excess of yang is to invite *rebellious qi*; a small excess brings minor rebellion, a great excess brings great rebellion—this is called *rebellious qi*, called *rebellious governance*. Its harm allows yin to overpower yang, the lower to deceive the higher, and ghostly and malevolent entities to flourish, jointly usurping the human Dao, moving about in broad daylight without regard for others. Now, illnesses cannot be eradicated, and roaming ghosts do not cease. The great fault lies here—do you understand? Do you truly understand?\"\n\n\"I, foolish and unlearned, have committed such transgressions without realizing it. Now, hearing the Master of Heaven’s words, I am suddenly awakened with deep remorse. Master, I humbly beg your forgiveness and will diligently take heed. You have revealed what I did not comprehend—yet this transgression seems minor; why does it lead to such grave consequences?\"\n\"To serve yin beyond yang, to serve the lower beyond the higher—this is the greatest of transgressions. How can you call it minor when it reaches such extremes?\"\n\nThe Perfected One was again at a loss.\n\"Moreover, the living are yang; ghosts and spirits are yin. The living belong to day; the dead belong to night. Do you wish to understand the profound consequences of this? When day grows long, night becomes short; when night grows long, day becomes short. When yang flourishes, it overpowers yin, and yin dares not appear recklessly—thus, ghosts and spirits remain hidden. When yin flourishes, it overpowers yang, and yang retreats—thus, ghosts and spirits appear in daylight. The living accompany the sun; malevolent ghosts and entities accompany the stars. The sun is yang; the stars are yin. Therefore, when the sun appears, the stars flee; when the stars appear, the sun sets. When yin prevails, ghosts and entities jointly cause profound harm, beyond description—this is called *flourishing yin* and *weakening yang*. It disrupts governance and harms the living. This transgression is most severe—ponder it deeply.\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven establishes its laws: the office of yin must always be weaker than yang. Just as a subject must be weaker than their ruler, so a subject serves their ruler with obedience; a child must be weaker than their parents, so a child serves their parents with filial piety. If they grow strong and unyielding, the harm becomes profound and severe. Therefore, though a filial child’s love cannot forget their parents, they must not serve them beyond how they did in life.\n\"Perfected One, do you now understand?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"",

Simply reflect carefully: all actions must accord with the law.\n\"Yes, yes.\"\nThe Heavenly Master has instructed me; I wish to fully understand why one must not exceed the standards of the living.\nIn burial rites, clothing, and funerary provisions, nothing should surpass what was done in life. All such excess is perverse governance, and even the dead incur punishment for it. To send off the dead without adhering to their original state—when the underworld’s ledgers examine the discrepancies, the false and deceptive conduct is exposed, and thus punishment follows.\nMoreover, excessive reverence in mourning rites—when inauspicious affairs grow too grand—invites misfortune. Ghosts and corpses flourish, spreading disease and harming people, giving rise to omens and strange transformations. How can this be made clear?\n\"Excellent question.\nIn high antiquity, the sages conducted funerals with utmost sincerity alone, never daring to make them extravagant. Death and mourning are the most inauspicious affairs under Heaven. To amplify inauspiciousness is to invite harm. Thus, sincerity alone sufficed, and though food and drink mirrored the living, nothing was lacking. In those times, people enjoyed good fortune, free from illness, and all fulfilled their natural lifespans.\nIn middle antiquity, funerary rites slightly deviated from the law. People could not maintain pure sincerity, losing the true intent and instead drifting into minor displays of reverence. They pursued ostentation to appease the living, their devotion to the dead only half-hearted. The dead’s ghosts came to partake, but with slight deviations from truth in the rites, the offerings summoned malevolence. Unseen spirits and entities arrived to share the feast, lingering to afflict people, so minor illnesses became common.\nIn later antiquity, people inherited and compounded the errors of middle antiquity, exacerbating them greatly. They no longer acted with sincerity toward their kin, instead seeking to overwhelm the living with grandeur. Imitating the ostentatious practices of the past, they fabricated falsehoods, failing to move Heaven or ensure the dead’s ghosts would regularly partake. Instead, they expanded sacrifices beyond measure, violating the law. Yin flourished and harmed the weakening yang, and unknown spirits and entities gathered to feast, then rampaged unchecked, killing people without end. When one person was slain, the perpetrators saw only the spectacle, not the guilt—why would they not persist?\nThus, malevolent qi daily increased, turning to attack its host. Once accustomed to feeding, it followed the living relentlessly. With yin strong and yang weak, the living were oppressed. Subjects deceived their rulers, children deceived their fathers, governance became unjust, and the people remained unaware. Hence, malevolence grew daily more severe, no longer restrained.\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity dared not serve the dead beyond how they served the living—this was a clear prohibition.\n\"Perfected One, do you now understand?\"\n\"How profound! How profound! Had the Heavenly Master not revealed this, my foolish heart would never have known it.\nPerfected One, you and I share a mind. Surely Heaven has sent you to preside over these inquiries. You must not take this lightly, which is why I have told you everything.\nThe reason is this: now, the qi of good governance is about to arrive. All affairs must follow its course; even a single reversal will prevent its coming.\nWhat does this mean? The Dao of Heaven should flourish yang, but to weaken yin is to follow the proper order. To instead amplify yin and suppress yang is to act perversely. To revere inauspicious affairs is to invite inauspicious qi, causing governance to falter and lose its rightful place—this is no minor transgression.\nPerfected One, do not conceal this text. Let it circulate so all people may recognize their gains and losses.\nWhen governance is disordered, the fault does not lie solely with Heaven, Earth, or the ruler. The blame rests with the common people, each bearing their own transgressions, mutually inheriting and compounding them, all seated in their failure to uphold truth.\nBy departing from truth and turning to falsehood, they stray from the root without realizing it.\nWhat does this mean? The living are the root; the dead are the false.\nWhy call it false? In truth, one does not see the deceased’s desires, yet the living fabricate them, vainly depicting forms and appearances beyond what existed in life. They cling to emptiness, not to substantive matters.\nWhen a person dies, the hun-soul returns to Heaven, the bones and flesh decompose into the earth, and the spirit cannot be summoned by mere thought to partake of offerings. The bones and flesh no longer remain; they are returned to the earth. Earth is humanity’s true mother. Born between Heaven and Earth, one’s fundamental nature differs from life, yet people do not understand their proper duty—what is it?\nThus, the filial child serves the dead according to their original state, thereby attaining truth. What the deceased disliked in life must not be imposed upon them in death. To exceed the standards of life is to invite profound and strange calamities.\nPerfected One, do you understand?\nBeware, beware.\"",
      "overlap_context": "s laws: the office of yin must always be weaker than yang. Just as a subject must be weaker than their ruler, so a subject serves their ruler with obedience; a child must be weaker than their parents, so a child serves their parents with filial piety. If they grow strong and unyielding, the harm becomes profound and severe. Therefore, though a filial child’s love cannot forget their parents, they must not serve them beyond how they did in life.\n\"Perfected One, do you now understand?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\"",

For what duty was it revealed?\n\nExcellent, excellent. Your question truly reflects the heart of August Heaven. The great essential purpose of this text is to resolve the *chengfu*—the inherited burdens—borne by emperors and the people since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Yet now that it has been revealed for this purpose, why do you first speak of cultivating one’s nature?\n\nAh, Perfected One, you remain truly steadfast, yet I, dull and deluded, do not understand. Earlier, when you expounded your words, I took them as mere humility, but in truth, you spoke in profound obscurity. Why is this?\n\nVery well. Perfected One, listen again with clarified ears.\n\nThe reason people incur blame and responsibility is entirely because they fail to properly nurture themselves, losing all sense of the fundamental principles. Thus, they bear the burden of *chengfu*. Consider this: if parents lack the highest virtue and commit offenses against their neighbors, their descendants may later suffer harm at the hands of those same neighbors—this is a clear example of *chengfu*. Now, if former kings governed without aligning with the will of Heaven and Earth, their misrule was not the fault of one person alone, yet Heaven grew greatly enraged and displeased, bringing forth myriad disasters. Those who later held office inherited these burdens—how could this not be thoroughly examined?\n\nThus, this scripture was revealed precisely for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the great sages of antiquity all knew the Dao of self-cultivation, so they governed in accord with the Will and seldom incurred the failures of *chengfu*. But later generations of scholars and teachers largely concealed the true essential texts of the Dao, transmitting only superficial and ornate teachings. They deviated from the essential intent of the Heavenly Dao, causing later ages to grow increasingly shallow, unable to properly nurture and cherish themselves. Over time, they drifted ever farther from the Dao, believing the world held no means of self-preservation. They grew careless in their affairs, contending over rank and emolument, and thus brought upon themselves the disasters of *chengfu*.\n\nDo you now understand this meaning?\n\nExcellent, excellent.",

You may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nFoolish as I am, I have received your grace and now comprehend deeply. Yet I have no end of questions—only that the Celestial Master might admonish and caution me again.\n\nNow, one who can profoundly nurture the self is able to nurture others; one who can profoundly cherish the self is able to cherish others. If one neglects one’s own body and cannot even nurture oneself, how can one generously nurture others? If one cannot cherish and preserve one’s own form, carefully guarding the ancestral lineage of one’s forebears, how can one cherish and preserve others?\n\nHow foolish! Do you deeply understand this or not?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\n\nNow, you might think my writings untrustworthy. Test them against the records of those in high antiquity who followed the Way, won the Heart of Heaven, and enjoyed enduring fortune. Then examine the writings of those in middle antiquity who followed the Way and won the Heart of Heaven. Then consider the texts of those in later antiquity who pondered and practiced, won the Will of Heaven, and preserved themselves for long.\n\nYou should examine all these, from beginning to end, and you will find they align perfectly with my words, like a compass and square in perfect accord. Only then will you, though now enlightened, come to trust my writings fully.\n\nNowadays, the sickly and the young grow ever more reckless, contending over fate. The most foolish even claim Heaven is without knowledge, that the Dao of Heaven yields no effect. Yet even the earth does not deceive: plant millet, and you reap millet; plant wheat, and you reap wheat. The more effort one invests, the finer the harvest—how much more so with Heaven!\n\nNow, Heaven has accumulated resentment, and the ignorant, lacking understanding, teach one another to treat matters lightly, growing ever more foolish with each generation. Thus, calamities, anomalies, and strange omens arise without end.\n\nHeaven and the sovereign share a bond as deep as that of father and son, yet the foolish, seeing this, fail to admonish their ruler in due time. Instead, they conceal and obstruct, severing the path to Heaven. Heaven’s indignation only grows, and the burden of *chengfu* deepens, worsening beyond remedy.\n\nThough an emperor may possess the virtue of ten thousand men, he may still suffer harm without cause. Thus, those who do good remain unrecognized, as if their efforts were of no benefit. This is why the foolish claim Heaven is without knowledge—yet is there not reason for it?\n\nNow, hearing the Celestial Master’s words, my heart is enlightened as if reborn.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThough I, your disciple, have often troubled you, risking transgression to ask these matters—beginning with what seemed like errors—now that I have grasped your meaning, I rejoice without regret.\n\nFor without inquiry, there is no path to understanding. Your words have captured this intent.\n\nExcellent! The writings are complete in every part—head, feet, belly, back, surface, and core—so examine them alongside the worthy, and ask no more.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Right: Questions to the Celestial Master Regarding the Abundance of Writings from Beginning to End, and Their Resolute Decisions**\n\n**Section Forty-Eight: Five Matters Explaining the Method of *Chengyuan***\n\nThe benighted disciple bows and speaks:\n\n\"A great sage, upon hearing a master’s words from one side, understands the teachings of all four sides. A lesser sage, upon hearing a master’s words on one matter, grasps the teachings of all four. Thus, instruction is easy.\n\nBut for those of us who are dull, benighted, and slow, even when matters are explained repeatedly, doubts linger in the heart. Thus, I dare to ask the Celestial Master in full.\n\nYou have resolved the enmity of *chengfu* for High Heaven, lifted the calamities of *chengfu* for the Earth, eased the burdens of *chengfu* for emperors, absolved the transgressions of *chengfu* for the common people, and relieved the obligations of *chengfu* for the twelve thousand beings.\n\nYet I, your foolish disciple, ask these things on behalf of Heaven. I dare not but risk transgression to speak fully—may I hear the meaning in its entirety?\"\n\n\"Speak plainly.\n\nDo emperors and the people bear *chengfu*? Do all matters likewise carry *chengfu* of their own?\"\n\n\"Excellent! You ask on behalf of Heaven—truly thorough and careful.\n\nWhenever we meet, you say you ask these questions for Heaven’s sake, so I dare not be remiss.\n\nExcellent! You possess a diligent and upright intent—you may be entrusted with matters.\n\nNow, do you wish me to explain everything in full?\"\n\n\"I would not shrink from the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Yet I fear the vastness of the text may overwhelm your capacity. To fully expound the *chengfu* of the world would require millions of words—far too many to bear.\n\nInstead, I shall outline its general principles, so that the worthy may grasp the intent together, as if holding a contract.\n\nListen well to the Celestial Master.\n\nOpen both ears, sit calmly, and still your heart to listen.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Now, when Heaven and Earth give life to all things, and one harms them without virtue, the world falls into chaos: households grow poor and wanting, the old and weak suffer hunger and cold, the government reaps no harvest, and granaries stand empty. This transgression originates in harming the earth, yet people inherit its burden.\n\nThis is the first general matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nIf a master teaches ten disciples, and the master’s words are false and insincere, the ten disciples will act accordingly, each teaching ten more—now a hundred spread falsehoods. Those hundred, in turn, each teach ten more—now a thousand propagate error. Those thousand each teach ten more—now ten thousand spread falsehoods. When ten thousand voices speak from all sides, the world is filled with deception.\n\nMoreover, when many transmit words, their cumulative weight makes reversal impossible, and falsehood becomes the norm. This begins with one person’s misstatement, yet it leads all people astray, distorting the true texts of Heaven, altering customs, and corrupting the world—a great malady that cannot be curbed. Later generations grow ever worse.\n\nThis is the calamity of *chengfu*—clearly not the fault of later people. Yet later generations, unaware of its distant origins, blame their contemporaries, deepening mutual grievances. The stagnant *qi* remains unresolved, worsening day by day.\n\nThis is the second matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nSuppose a man deceives greatly in the marketplace, walking through its four sides, crying out that the earth will collapse into a watery abyss, weeping as he speaks...\"",

      "translated_text": "The people of the marketplace spread the word, and ten thousand households came to know it. Old and young, great and small, all walked about speaking of it, until the whole world heard. Thus the world was deceived, and later generations only amplified it, those more distant suffering even worse. This began with one man’s words—yet the burden of *chengfu* for empty falsehoods falls upon him, so how can later people be at fault? Yet they turn and blame their contemporaries.\n\nThis is the third matter—listen again for further clarity.\n\nOn South Mountain stands a great tree, its branches and canopy spreading hundreds of paces across the earth, though its trunk is but one. Above, its branches, leaves, and fruit are beyond measure; below, its roots do not firmly grasp the earth. When great winds and rains assail it, its countless branches, leaves, and fruit all wither and die—this is the great *chengfu* transgression of the ten thousand things, grasses and trees alike. The fault lies in the root, not the branches, yet they blame the branches—is this not a grievous wrong? Now the branches bear no fault, yet they suffer calamity and perish without cause. Such is the burden of *chengfu*—how can later generations be blamed?\n\nThis is the fourth matter—now attend once more with clarity.\n\nOn South Mountain lurks a poisonous *qi*. The mountain fails to contain it, and when the spring southern wind arises, the *qi* rides with it, obscuring sun and moon. The world bears its blame, and the dead pile up in great numbers. This began with the mountain’s release of *qi*—why then do the people of the world bear the burden of *chengfu*, falling ill and dying? Yet contemporaries say, “You are wicked, so Heaven slays you,” blaming the people—is this not a grievous wrong? These people bear no fault, yet they suffer this disaster through *chengfu*. Their souls cry out in injustice, and the living further blame them, their *qi* knotting in grievance until it stirs Heaven. The fault lies in the mountain’s evil *qi*, carried by the wind—such is the burden of *chengfu*.\n\nThis is the fifth matter—now, Perfected One, sit solemnly and heed my words with care.\n\nThe Dao was originally upright, never deceptive or false. Yet people rely on their ancestors, rulers, teachers, and fathers, whose teachings deviated slightly from the upright Way. They lost the upright words of self-nurturance, and later generations imitated them, worsening day by day. Over time, these teachings spread, and none grasped the truth. The world turned wholly to falsehood, unable to restrain itself, and thus ten thousand disasters arose, too many to record. This has accumulated over a long, long time. The foolish, knowing nothing, blame their rulers and contemporaries—are they not doubly wronged? The world is wholly lost, unable to recognize itself. Though the emperor alone may possess the virtue of ten thousand people, what can he do alone? Yet people act as they do—is there any remedy?\n\nIf one’s food is exhausted and they seek more, yet the sick cannot eat and thus perish—is there any remedy? If yin and yang unite in perfect harmony, with descendants to offer sacrifices and pray for blessings, yet one remains childless—is there any remedy? If one lives in utmost joy and goodness, strong and robust, yet turns out base and wicked—is there any remedy? These are all the great effects of *chengfu*. Yet they blame their contemporaries, so their governance cannot be settled. People have long transmitted falsehoods—how can they suddenly correct themselves? Thus grievances persist, growing ever more entrenched, and Heaven takes pity. Therefore, the Supreme Sovereign’s Dao descends in accord with the primordial *qi*. Do not wonder at this.\n\nWhat is the beginning? To ponder and guard the One—why? The One is the beginning of numbers, the Way of life, the origin of primordial *qi*, the guiding principle of Heaven. Thus one must guard and contemplate the One, ascending and descending from above.\n\nWhenever things or affairs grow too great and fail to return to their root, they become deeply confused and cannot be resolved. Thus they must return to their root. Therefore, the sages of old, before undertaking any great endeavor, would gaze up at the celestial patterns and look down at the earth’s principles, clearly demonstrating the luminous effects of returning to the root.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\nNow, Master, you seem troubled. I have already laid out the beginnings of *chengfu*—all matters in the world follow this pattern of *chengfu*. Do you understand? Yes, yes.\n\nToday, the Celestial Master has fully explained its origins, and this foolish student’s heart-knots are undone. Go now, and I will tell you one great essential truth.\n\nThose in high antiquity who attained the Dao and brought order to their governance simply mastered self-nurturance and guarded their root. In middle antiquity, those who slightly lost the Way merely neglected self-nurturance and lost their root. In later antiquity, they recklessly disregarded their bodies, believing they could regain them, and thus greatly lost the Way, throwing governance into chaos. Yet this is not the fault of later people—it is the convergence of *chengfu*’s calamity.\n\nThe text has grown repetitive; I will not speak further. A hundred words would say the same—there is no benefit. Do not add more writing. Today, my instructions have been fully entrusted to you, Perfected One. Yes, yes.\n\nGo now, reflect on the essentials, and transmit them to a virtuous ruler. Write the essentials to resolve *chengfu* and dispel its grievances. Yes, yes.\n\n**End of the Inquiry into the Knotted *Qi* of *Chengfu* in All Matters.**\n**Conclusion of *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Seven**\n**Beginning of *The Scripture of Great Peace*, Scroll Thirty-Nine**",

Yet later generations, unaware of its distant origins, blame their contemporaries, deepening mutual grievances.

      "translated_text": "**Fifty-Second Section: Explication of the Master’s Cipher Text**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed twice with reverence and said, \"Yes, yes. I humbly request the resolution of one lingering doubt.\n\nWhat does *ping yan* mean?\"\n\nThe cipher text you previously bestowed upon this dull and unenlightened student consists of ninety characters. I have retired to a secluded chamber, dwelling in solitude for days and nights, pondering with utmost diligence. Though my nature is dull and my mind slow, I have meditated ceaselessly, exhausting my spirit and depleting my heart, yet still fail to grasp its meaning. Now, I beseech the Heavenly Master to take pity on this unenlightened student and provide a full explication, that it may be transmitted through ten thousand generations, its threads unbroken and never forgotten.\n\n\"Excellent, your difficult question! You may indeed be called a celestial being.\"\n\n\"Very well. Perfected One, listen closely, and I shall fully resolve its essential meaning.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"My text reads: *Eleven characters to clarify the stopping point.*\"\n\n*Master* refers to the divine teacher of August Heaven. *Said* means discourse. I ascend to address Heaven, personally sent down to expound before emperors and the myriad people, resolving the karmic retributions of *chengfu* across a hundred million generations.\n\n*I* is the self. *Self* is the divine emissary urgently dispatched by Heaven. Today, the calamities of *chengfu* flow in four directions, their roots established at the beginning. Later rulers all follow in their wake, losing governance, unable to sever or halt them. Instead, they harm one another, inflicting profound suffering. Heaven regards this as a grave concern.\n\n*Characters* refers to the celestial script I now array, the accumulated symbols of Heaven’s text. *Ten* signifies that the text aligns with the celestial perfected, its sincerity and truth resonating perfectly—tenfold, without error, not a single deception. Those who obtain it and reflect deeply will realize that their ancestors all bore *chengfu*. Reciting it without cease, the calamities of *chengfu*, great and small, will all be dispelled.\n\n*One* is the essential Way, the correct path that begins with guarding the One. Guarding the One without pause, one’s clarity grows daily, and profound delusion dissolves. *Clarify* is the stopping point; *stopping* is sufficiency. Sufficiency gives rise to action. Those who practice this Way will only grow ever brighter, never again sinking into ignorance and darkness.\n\n*Eleven* is the scholar. *Clarify to the stopping point* is the red. When the red *qi* attains this, it will flourish anew, and the king’s great illumination will return. *Stopping* is the sufficiency of the myriad things. When the myriad things first sprout, they extend their roots to draw sustenance from their origin. Practicing this Way restores the primordial *qi*, aligning with the heart of Heaven and Earth—this is the highest and most excellent, thus called the Way of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Bing-wu and ding-si* are the ancestral beginning. *Bing-wu* and *ding-si* are fire, the red. *Bing-wu* is pure yang; *ding-si* is pure yin. Yin and yang harmonize all things. This means the *qi* of yin and yang will reunite and flourish across the world. *For* means to benefit the emperor by eliminating misfortune and calamity. *Ancestor* is the first, embodying the virtue of the Three Sovereigns. *Beginning* is the return to the original source. Thus, practicing this Way will restore the era of the Supreme Sovereign.\n\n*Four mouths govern affairs and order the myriad things.* *Four with mouths* means speech. Those who daily recite this text will obtain the true celestial script, grasping its profound intent. Their will shall align with Heaven’s heart, enabling the myriad things to each find their proper place without further disorder—hence, *ordering the myriad things.*\n\n*With a cap and horn, govern the right—this is reciting the text.* Reciting this scripture without cease will rectify all affairs in a single stroke. Above, it will delight Heaven’s intent, bringing constant joy without lingering resentment.\n\n*The hidden dragon, unused, hums as its marker.* The *hidden dragon* is the return of Heaven’s *qi* to the first nine, the *jia-zi* year, the winter solstice—the day when Heaven and Earth truly begin. The *dragon* is the lesser yang of the east, the spirit of wood. Thus, the Dao of Heaven emerges through wood to activate the fire phase. When things are about to flourish, they must first open their gates. Perfected One, when the appointed time arrives, present this text in a place of luminous clarity. *Open* means to expand, to unblock, to reach. Opening the south will harmonize and invigorate the yang *qi*, dissolving the calamitous convergence of *chengfu.*\n\n*Hidden* means concealed. The Dao has already passed, returning to concealment. *Not* means caution, not yet. Those who first encounter the text do not yet know how to practice it. *Use* means governance, affairs. Today, Heaven intends this text to eliminate disasters. When it emerges in a *xuan-jia* year, the ruler of that time may not yet deeply fathom its meaning or be able to apply it—hence, *unused* means seeing the celestial signs but not daring to immediately implement them. Those who trust and apply it will see affairs established, effects manifest, and responses echoing—this is its clear proof, aligning with Heaven, thus the resonance.\n\n*Kan as the marker* is called *yan* by the child. *Jia* is Heaven, the guiding principle, yang. *Kan* is the child, water, yin, the marker. Thus, Heaven and Earth are ever united, their guiding principles and markers emerging at the outset of *xuan-jia-zi*. This may serve as the guiding principle for a virtuous ruler—hence, *hums as its marker.*\n\nThis is the celestial script of the Supreme Sovereign, revealed below as the true scripture for a virtuous ruler, to sever the perverse with the measuring line, with *xuan-jia* as its subtle beginning. All things that live take *jia* as their head and *zi* as their root—thus, it is presented in sequence beginning with *jia-zi.*\n\n*Those who behold it will enjoy long life.* *People* refers specifically to the emperor, the one of supreme virtue who readily perceives and practices the scripture of the Way. According to the auspicious signs, they will not doubt the Dao of Heaven. Deeply grasping its meaning, they will attain longevity. *Longevity* is fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years. *Long* means without end. *Enduring* means enduring existence. *Dwelling between Heaven and Earth, alive and no more.* *Dwelling* means abiding. *Abiding between Heaven and Earth, alive and no more* means studying the true Dao. Fleeting, ornamental texts cannot sustain life for long.\"",

Yet I do not understand: are *cheng* and *fu* the same, or different?\n\nThey are not the same. *Cheng* refers to what comes before, *fu* to what follows.\n\n*Cheng*—\"inheritance\"—means that one’s forebears originally acted in accord with the heart of Heaven, yet unknowingly allowed small transgressions to accumulate day by day, gathering over time into a weighty burden. Now, later generations, though innocent, suffer the consequences of those errors, inheriting their misfortunes and enduring their calamities.

Though their predicaments are many, are they not nameless?\n\nThey cannot be named.\n\nYou do not yet understand.\n\nThe people of the world face four predicaments.\n\nWhat are they?\n\nFirst: when you are born of your father and mother, in your youth you cannot leave their care—this is the first predicament.\n\nSecond: as you grow and mature, a woman desires marriage, a man desires a wife; unable to master their passions, they become bound by love and cannot part—this is the second predicament.\n\nThird: once bound in love, they bear children. As husband and wife age, their appearance becomes unlovely, yet their young children are dear; they must now be cared for—this is the third predicament.\n\nFourth: when their children grow and no longer need support, they themselves have aged and can no longer move freely—this is the fourth predicament.\n\nAfter these four predicaments, if one meets an enlightened teacher and reflects deeply upon guarding the Dao, those of exceptional talent and celestial mandate may attain liberation.

      "translated_text": "Setting life’s end as the limit—how excellent! Your aspiration may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nYet for ordinary people, all conduct is bounded by the span of life, differing only in whether their goodness or evil reaches its end. What does this mean? I wish to hear it.\n\nThose who maintain goodness and learning, who pass their days in joy and ease, become joyful wandering ghosts, spared from sorrow and suffering. Those who exhaust themselves in sorrow, or whose lives end in wickedness, become wretched ghosts. These are plainly visible matters, knowable to all.\n\nYet people refuse to do good and delight their hun and shen—truly a grave transgression. What does this mean?\n\nHuman life is formed by receiving the pure qi of Heaven and Earth, the convergence of the four seasons and five phases, the inherited body of one’s ancestors. This body, dwelling within Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and five phases, should ever delight in goodness and know no sorrow. Instead, unworthy descendants repeatedly transmit suffering to the body of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and five phases, causing it to endure prolonged hardship and even die in grievance. They further afflict their own hun and po, so that foolish scholars, failing to consider deeply, cannot long endure.\n\nThus, some wish to hasten their death, and upon dying, feel no regret. Their spirits merely pity themselves, needlessly incurring sorrow and resentment in this lower realm.\n\nTherefore, the great sages of antiquity, with deep calculation and far-reaching foresight, understood this and never ceased their learning. Those among them who became rulers delighted in pursuing Great Peace, aligning with the heart of Heaven, and their merit doubled. Their hun and shen constantly wandered in joy, uniting with Heaven’s virtuous qi.\n\nThose who failed to bring order to their governance acted against Heaven’s heart, forfeiting Heaven’s favor and earning no merit in the celestial realm. When their lives ended, their hun and shen faced solitary reproach in the underworld, dwelling among malign qi.\n\nThus, the supreme sages of high antiquity understood this and exerted themselves accordingly. Foolish people, lacking deep reflection, incur punishment from Heaven in life and from Earth in death—how terrifying!\n\nYour disciple is dull and ignorant; I do not wish to hear this.\n\nExcellent! Since you have come to study, if you do not wish to hear this, then strive earnestly to do good.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe Heavenly Master, dwelling in this realm, enables you to know Heaven’s mandate and receive profound instruction. How may one escape this fate?\n\nExcellent! Simply hasten to transmit my writings on the Dao, so that all under Heaven may practice them. Let each reflect on their own body, concentrate their essence, and align their thoughts with the Great Dao. Then they will recognize the origins of their transgressions, and the burden of inherited responsibility will be lifted. Heaven and Earth will rejoice for a great span of years, and the ancient age will be restored and doubled.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThis minor discourse now concludes. Perfected One, exert yourself and persevere. Return another day.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nStudy the text carefully, pondering its entirety. If your learning lacks precision, it is called \"huhuang\" (vague and indistinct).

      "translated_text": "Since you have come to study, you ought to broadly comprehend the intent of the Dao/Way—can the few be followed in practice? Can the many be followed in practice? Yet only when all are fully prepared and numerous may they be followed. Alas, you have not yet broadly grasped the essential intent of the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, Heaven is One, yet it acts contrary to Earth’s Two—what is the meaning of this? Earth is Two, yet it acts contrary to Humanity’s Three—what is the meaning of this? Foolish student, I wish to hear of their mutual interaction.\n\nThus, Earth serves as Heaven’s agent, and Humanity serves as Earth’s agent. When Heaven rejoices, it causes the myriad things upon Earth in this year to flourish greatly; when Heaven does not rejoice, though Earth may wish to nurture, it causes those things to turn foul. When Earth is good, those dwelling upon it—its people—are inclined toward goodness. This is the clear effect of their mutual agency.\n\nTherefore, order and chaos arise when the many ends fail to align with Heaven’s heart; one must return and revert to the root. When a person’s words are too numerous yet fail to reveal truth, one must return and revert to the essential root—only then may affairs be established through speech.\n\nThus, a single word that achieves its end is the root text. Two turns of phrase that conclude form a passage. Three words that conclude instead create explanations of difficulties, for distance from the truth gives rise to the need for explanation. Four words that conclude instead form literary expression. Five words that conclude instead produce falsehood. Six words that conclude instead produce deception. Seven words that conclude instead produce destruction. Eight words that conclude instead produce separation and estrangement from the Dao/Way, growing ever more distant. Nine words that conclude instead produce great chaos. Ten words that conclude instead produce annihilation and ruin.\n\nTherefore, when scriptures reach ten, they must be revised, for transmission without change leads to corruption. When all things are ruined, one must return to the root—thus reverting to the One as the primordial beginning. Hence, Heaven’s numbers begin with One and conclude at Ten; this is the natural nature of the Heavenly Dao/Way.\n\nThus, in ancient times, when the sages inquired of affairs, the first divination revealed fortune or misfortune—this was to guard the root, for the Heavenly spirits descended to inform them. The second divination was when the Earthly spirits emerged to inform them. The third divination was when the Human spirits emerged to inform them. Beyond this, all is deception of others, and divination cannot be trusted, for the hexagrams’ numbers will not be accurate.\n\nWhen human speech and writing are excessive, they lose their value.\n\nExcellent, excellent!",

You grasp deeply and inquire after this method of affairs. Indeed, Heaven’s numbers begin with the primordial One of Heaven. Descending, it joins with Earth to become Two, and with yin and yang complete, all things are born together. The myriad beings first sprout in the north, where the primordial qi arises at *zi*. Turning to the northeast, roots spread at *jiao*; turning to the east, life emerges and reaches forth; turning to the southeast, branches and leaves fully grow; turning to the south, they flourish in abundance; turning to the southwest, they incline toward fullness; turning to the west, they ripen; turning to the northwest, they come to an end. When things end, they must return to the beginning—thus at *hai*, two persons embrace the One, forming the Three Sovereigns’ origin.\n\nTherefore, *hai* is the kernel, the first coagulation of the seed—hence water begins to congeal in the tenth month. *Ren* means \"to bear,\" for once borne, it must burgeon, growing ever greater—thus *zi* means \"to burgeon.\" When Three achieves the harmonious qi of yin and yang, all is complete, and it returns to the initial arising—hence reverting to the root, it is named *jiazi*.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven in generating things must circulate and fully possess all.

What does this mean?\n\nBefore parents give birth to a child, if the foolish merely cast their essence into the wild, it takes root in the earth and becomes grass or trees, unaware that it was meant to become human. How could such blind bestowal ever be spoken of? Thus it becomes mere vegetation. Only when yin and yang unite does a human take form—how different from becoming grass or trees!\n\nOnce born, if a person, though naturally endowed, does not seek a worthy master but instead follows a base and ignorant teacher, they are taught evil ways, led into depravity, and may even bring about their own destruction. Their sins persist beyond death, consuming their entire household. Some are born yet never pursue learning, remaining fools. Such ignorant ones suffer in life and die in sorrow, yet their transgressions follow them below. Their souls, denied joy, cannot even become benevolent spirits after death.\n\nNow, a virtuous master teaches the foolish and lowly, transforming them into good people. Goodness pursued without cease leads to ever greater virtue; virtue pursued without cease leads to sagehood. Sagehood pursued without cease leads to profound understanding of the true Dao/Way. Guarding the Dao/Way without cease leads to immortality as a transcendent. Transcendence pursued without cease leads to perfection as a Perfected One. Perfection pursued without cease leads to divinity. Divinity pursued without cease leads to virtue/power equal to Heaven.

To extend compassion without harm—this, like the movement of Heaven, is most excellent. Your words may be said to grasp the intent of the Dao. Yet in governance, nothing surpasses emulating Heaven. Even so, there must be an order of precedence.\n\nWhat does this mean? Though this foolish one may speak once, I shall not repeat myself. May the Heavenly Master expound it.\n\nNow, in the conduct of common people and the governance of kings: the most excellent is to constantly desire the joy of life, ever thirsting for it as one parched—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in delighting in accomplishment, ever yearning to bring things to fruition as if grieving for one’s own body—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in benevolent giving, seeing others in poverty and want and sorrowing for them as if grieving for one’s own hunger and cold—only then is it fitting. Next is to excel in establishing laws, not delighting in harm but merely acting from fear—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person errs, nothing is better than governance that does not ensnare them in crime—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person has already fallen into crime, if the heart does not desire to deeply harm them—only then is it fitting. Next, when a person’s transgression incurs a capital offense and nothing can be done, if one can avoid implicating their family and neighbors—only then is it fitting. Next, when the crime extends to family and neighbors, if one wishes to single out the guilty and takes care not to exterminate the human kindred entirely—only then is it fitting.\n\nFor humans are the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth. Extermination is called severing the divine lineage of Heaven and Earth, causing grievous injury to the body of Heaven and Earth. The harm runs deep, and in time, Heaven will exterminate the human race in turn. It is no easy matter to become the ancestor of a family. One ought to consider posterity and not impose the calamity of inherited burden upon descendants.\n\nThus, the sage in governance constantly contemplates Great Peace, ensuring that punishments are prepared but unused.

Today, the earth stands in the void; we must reverently receive Heaven’s bestowal.

Thus, I dare not speak lightly.\n\nWhy this deference? I wish to deliberate with the Perfected One on what is good, and there is no harm in speaking. □□□□□—why should there be?

Why?\n\nI rejoice at having met the Master. I am startled for fear that my dull and sluggish learning is incomplete, and the Master may depart. Now, I ask eagerly, as one parched and desperate for drink. Why?\n\nI wish the Heavenly Master to transmit the Dao to his disciples and entrust it to a virtuous ruler capable of employing it. Then, yin and yang will each find their proper place, and all the great afflictions of inherited burdens under heaven will be entirely cured.\n\nExcellent indeed are your words.

Record only what is good, assemble them all together, and bring them to one place. When this is fully accomplished, then together with the many wise and virtuous ones of great power, deliberate upon them. By category, refine and clarify them further, remove redundancies, order their words and texts, and record and arrange them. This is called obtaining the writings of Heaven and Earth and the words of human nature, thoroughly and definitively determining their virtuous secrets, with nothing lost—even as fine as a silk thread or a hair.\n\nThis Dao of the Dao is called the *Scripture of the Utmost Profundity of Heaven and Earth and Yin-Yang*, which for ten thousand myriad generations cannot again be altered.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Proceed with this, Perfected One—you may be said to have truly awakened.\n\nYet this foolish student falls short. Now I wish to ask one more doubt.\n\nProceed with your question.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, long ages have passed. The Yellow River and Luo River have produced writings and diagrams; some divine texts have emerged, some have been brought by sacred birds and beasts, spitting forth writings that have accumulated in great number—all differing in origin. The works of sages and worthies have likewise accumulated in abundance, each ultimately having its own matter. What doubt, what observation, what insight did the Heavenly Master have that you simultaneously instructed the many wise ones of later antiquity to gather and collate the writings and words of the literati of ancient and modern times?\n\nIndeed, there was something observed and seen. I dared not recklessly trouble the virtuous ones of later antiquity without cause. Now I have been sent forth into the world to explain to the lord of great virtue and power the concept of *chengfu*—the inherited burden of flowing disasters and accumulated poisons since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe celestial writings, sacred texts, and words of sages and worthies of ancient and modern times are already fully sufficient, yet I worry that each excels only in one matter. If we now apply the methods of a single school, we cannot entirely eliminate the calamities and transformations of Heaven and Earth. Thus, flowing disasters persist without end, passing on and inheriting one another. Those born later suffer ever-increasing afflictions and illnesses, and so the Heavenly Lord of Compassionate Virtue continues to bear their *chengfu*.\n\nHeavenly harmony cannot arise for those born later; this accumulation of disasters and faults lies truly in the fact that the former sages and worthies each excelled in one area yet all had their incomprehensions and shortcomings. Heaven, knowing their insufficiency, thus periodically produced the writings and diagrams of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, as well as other divine texts—each differing in their words. The great sages and worthies, appearing in different eras, each accomplished one matter, and their words likewise differed. Therefore, each had their inadequacies, each had their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSo it is. Clearly, none could fully comprehend the ultimate and profound meaning of the *Utmost Profundity*. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, residual disasters persist, ceaseless from beginning to end, varying only in severity.\n\nTherefore, Heaven calculated and determined that now, with the writings and texts above and below, all is fully and completely prepared. Even if sages were to arise again, there would be nothing more to create, nothing more to add, no room for further words, nothing more to contribute to the lord of great virtue and power of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven were to produce another sage, their words would still excel only in one endeavor, and residual flowing disasters and poisons would persist without end—no different from the former sages and worthies.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to deeply instruct the Perfected One and entrust the lord of virtue and power with these writings, to show them to the many wise ones. Gather and collate all the texts and spoken secrets of the world, supplementing above and below, removing redundancies, and preserving the essential words, essential texts, and secret matters. Record them to form scriptures. Only then will the true writings, correct characters, and virtuous words of Heaven and Earth all emerge. All that is false and deceptive will be entirely eliminated, the great illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be fully cured, flowing disasters will be utterly extinguished, and the people and the myriad things will each dwell in their proper place, no longer suffering misfortune or hardship.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to gather and collate them.\n\nMy writing does not merely imitate words—it imitates verification. Follow my texts and act accordingly: the calamities and transformations of Heaven and Earth, strange illnesses and diseases, treacherous and cunning ministers, inauspicious and deceptive evils—all will be entirely eliminated. This is no different from the sun dispersing the clouds.\n\nBy this, my words and my texts are verified—ten thousand times without a single error.\n\nIf you do not vigorously apply my texts, even if I respectfully receive Heaven’s words, descend with teachings, and manifest writings, yet they are not used—how can Heaven idly eliminate disasters? If the texts themselves are in chaos, people will likewise be in chaos, and disasters will have no means of being removed.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"",

Speak plainly.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, divine sages and worthy persons have all been born of Heaven, and those who have successively presided over the words of Heaven and Earth have all established laws for rulers to eliminate disasters and pacify the world. When emperors and kings follow and apply these, they do not deviate from the patterns of Heaven’s will and the regulations of yin and yang, and the texts they produce each bear their own names and titles.\n\nNow, what should the writings on the Dao and virtue composed by the Celestial Master be called?\n\nExcellent indeed is your question, Perfected One. They are to be named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*.\n\nWhy are they properly named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*?\n\nThe *Great* signifies that which is vast—practicing this governance yields the most supreme and unparalleled rule. The *Cavern* means that its Dao and virtue, whether good or ill, thoroughly harmonize with the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, and its resonance extends without fail to all six directions, inner and outer. All things are made to act with caution and goodness, and every being attains its rightful place.\n\nThis Dao gathers and examines the celestial, terrestrial, human, and divine texts since the opening of Heaven and Earth, selecting only the finest to compile into the scriptures of the *Cavern-Reaching* canon. When emperors and kings follow and apply these, enlisting the collective efforts of all worthy persons to practice them, disasters within the four seas and four borders will be entirely swept away. Such governance becomes as luminously clear as the Cavern itself, resembling the state of Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits.\n\nThus, it is named *The Governance of the Great Cavern Reaching Heaven*.

When governance aligns with the Will of Heaven, these nine *qi* harmonize, and the nine persons unite in purpose, thereby achieving the Great Peace of the Supreme August. If these nine matters diverge and act in discord, the Great Peace cannot be attained.\n\nThese nine affairs are interdependent, mutually generating and completing one another—yet people fail to comprehend them deeply. The former sages and worthies did not expound upon them, and so they have long remained obscured.\n\nNow, if even one matter is left ungoverned, peace cannot be achieved. Why? When the *qi* of the Supreme August arrives in full, these nine persons all come to assist the king in governance. If a single *qi* falls out of harmony, there will invariably be discord, and thus the governance of yin and yang cannot be fully harmonized.\n\nHow do they come? Invisible spirit-persons arrive to instruct the king, and his heart grows daily brighter. Great spirit-persons appear from time to time to teach the principles of governance. Perfected Ones, immortals, and great Daoists all come as teachers to aid in instruction and transformation. Sages and worthies emerge, reclusive scholars come forth as ministers, and the common people—servants and bondmaids alike—submit to goodness, refraining from wickedness. This is the sign of Heaven and Earth’s great joy.\n\nIf a single *qi* fails to harmonize, what then? If the Primordial *qi* is disharmonious, invisible spirit-persons do not come. If the *qi* of Heaven is disharmonious, great spirit-persons do not come. If the *qi* of Earth is disharmonious, Perfected Ones do not come.

When these persons all lose their proper place, the harm of accumulated burdens daily increases.\n\nThese nine kinds of persons range from the formless above to servants and bondmaids below, each regulating one *qi*, and thus the nine *qi* and yin-yang are harmonized. Now, if Heaven intends to harmonize and regulate *qi*, one must first consume *qi*. Therefore, when superior scholars are about to enter the Dao, they first abstain from eating the formed and consume *qi* instead, thereby merging with the primordial *qi*. Thus, they should be nurtured in thatched chambers, made to fast and abstain, shielded from evil and wickedness, daily refining their forms, and not depriving them of their desires. They can then depart without obstruction, ascending to assist the Perfected Ones and primordial *qi* in Heaven’s governance. These are the divine scholars, the officers of Heaven. Do not forbid or hinder them; if one can truly attain this, they are called Heaven’s scholars. Heaven examines and selects the good, greatly rejoicing in them, and in turn benefits humanity.\n\nWhat does this mean? Those who attain the Dao and depart, though not of immediate use to the eyes of men, all together harmonize the *qi* of yin and yang. In ancient times, when the emperor-kings sacrificed to Heaven, the spirits above descended to partake of the offerings—this is what it means.\n\nBut do only the spirits of Heaven descend to partake?

If the officers are displeased, then Daoists have transgressed against Heaven’s sovereign, and the officers will not descend to partake of human offerings.

Yet once you know and practice this, the afflictions of past burdens will daily diminish, monthly dissolve, and yearly vanish. How can this be known?\n\nExcellent indeed is your question—it has grasped the intent of the Dao. Now listen carefully.

Seeing their own bodies, they will each cherish and value themselves. Those born later will be filial and long-lived, all skilled in caring for the aged. Their countenances will differ from those of the Dao-less era. Later generations will daily comprehend its profound meaning, regarding it as their very home.

Therefore, my Dao is founded on sincerity. You have persistently □□ inquired, surely desiring to know its great efficacy. Its effects are inverse, like cold and heat: when heat is abundant, cold is scant; when cold is abundant, heat is scant.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, those who have taught others have often concealed the true Dao, instead imparting superficial learning that yields but slight and fleeting benefit. Later generations have daily compounded this, worsening the original state, perpetuating false learning through transmission. Though the Dao of Heaven is vast and distant, the initial authors of such texts have become the great ladder of deception. Once deception takes root, later generations employ it for profit. Now, the superior have nothing to trust, and the inferior have nowhere to entrust their lives. Thus, mutual suspicion arises, leading to disorder. Later generations inherit these burdens in succession, and the afflictions of their predecessors accumulate—hence, it is called worsening.\n\nHeaven is now aggrieved, which is why I speak to you □□. Perfected One, exert yourself and take care to encourage yourself. You will remove illness from Heaven and dispel afflictions for the emperors and kings. The heavens above will know you have rendered great merit. \"I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nOn the right: *Verifying the Efficacy of Practice and Discerning the Authenticity of the Dao*.\n\n**The Four Roots and Branches of Conduct: Fifty-Eighth Formula**\n\nPerfected One, come forward. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nHow many kinds of conduct do people have?

How many kinds of fortune and misfortune are there? There are a thousand strands and a hundred million variations. Perfected One, your words again resemble those of common folk. There are four kinds of fortune and misfortune. The first is *delusion*.\n\nWhat does this mean?

      "translated_text": "Now, when Heaven and Earth and the years are not greatly joyous, they verge on great evil; when they are neither joyous nor evil, it is a mediocre year. When good and evil alternate, it is a year of celestial anomalies and delusion.\n\nToday, if the day is not greatly good, it verges on great evil; if it is neither good nor evil, it is a mediocre day or month. When good and evil alternate, it is a deluded course, governing conduct that is strange and calamitous.\n\nI have merely outlined the guiding principles to reveal the beginning—all matters under Heaven follow this pattern.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nNow, all the myriad things and people of the world, if they do not enter into goodness, must fall into evil. If they are neither good nor evil, it is a mediocre course. When good and evil alternate, it is a course of deceit and falsity—nothing can be established upon it.\n\nThe mediocre course cannot be encouraged, while great goodness and great evil achieve renown.\n\nWhy are there precisely these four courses?\nExcellent! Your questioning is profound and grasps the intent of the Dao.\n\nNow, great goodness is the pure course of Grand Yang. Great evil is the course of Grand Yin’s destructive force. The blending of good and evil is the course of harmony. The inconstant course arises when Heaven and Earth, ruler and ministers, the people, and the myriad things lose their proper Way.\n\nThus, in conduct, one should seek rectitude: following the Yang yields more goodness, following the Yin yields more evil, and following harmony results in mediocrity. As for the inconstant fortune and misfortune, such conduct has no recurring pattern or measure.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply observed Heaven and Earth, years, months, and days, the people, and the myriad things, examining their rise and decline, mediocrity and advancement, to know whether their own conduct was aligned or misaligned. It is like using a luminous mirror to reflect one’s form—how could it be otherwise?\n\nExcellent, excellent! What is to be done now?\nNow, in conduct, to model oneself after Heaven is the beginning; to model after Earth is to invite many harms; to model after harmony is secondary; and inconstancy is the end of conduct.\n\nWhy do people now arrive at the inconstant course?\nAt first, their forebears made minor transgressions, then slight errors, then greater errors, then grave mistakes. The roots of the Way became ever more confused, leaving nothing to rely upon in their intent. Thus, they turned to inconstant conduct, altering their words to justify inconstant years.\n\nThis shows that the decline of the Dao has not yet reached its limit—one must return to the root.\n\nThe sages of antiquity saw this and knew it was the end of the current. When the limit was reached, they returned to the origin, thus never losing governance and preserving their Mandate of Heaven. Therefore, the greatly wise and sagely see matters clearly and so always enjoy unique good fortune.\n\nPerfected One, do you delight in further understanding its truth and effects?\nIt is only for the Heavenly Master to reveal this.\n\nWhen the root of a year flourishes but its end turns evil, it is the extreme of Yin and Yang. When later generations grow increasingly wicked and shallow, it is the extreme of the age. When the myriad things flourish at the root but yield no harvest at the end, it is the extreme of things. When later generations speak much but with empty deceit, lacking substance, it is the extreme of speech. When writings accumulate in abundance yet lack truth, it is the extreme of literature.\n\nAll these arise from forsaking the root for the branches, abandoning substance for ornamentation. Thus, Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things, yet many lack a true root or fruition. The fault lies in forsaking the root to pursue the branches, abandoning truth for falsity, abandoning depth for shallowness, and making this the norm.\n\nCustoms become so ingrained that people no longer recognize their mutual harm, and alone they accumulate opposition to the laws of Heaven. Later generations grow ever more frivolous in affairs, crafting deceit and falsity. Habit solidifies into nature, and they can no longer restrain themselves, instead claiming to understand matters. Thus, they inherit and compound one another’s burdens, creating Heaven’s blame and Earth’s calamity. These spread in all directions, unrestrained and unchecked.\n\nEven if a ruler is benevolent and wise, how can he sever this flow of errors spanning myriad generations? The initial losses were minor, each no more than a grain of millet. Yet the Way of Heaven loses a hair’s breadth, and the error extends a thousand miles. Grain by grain they accumulate, filling granaries with tens of thousands of *hu*.\n\nRaindrop by raindrop they follow one another, and the flowing waters never cease, forming the hundred rivers and filling the Four Seas. The root cannot be removed, so one must correct it with the true Dao, returning from the extreme of the branches to the root, returning from ornamentation to substance, returning from falsity to truth.\n\nWhen the branches reach their limit, one should return to the root; when conduct reaches its extreme, one must return to the origin—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nTo lose the true Way is no minor illness. It extends even beyond the end of one’s life, as errors are inherited and compounded. Later generations grow ever more confused and lost, the true Way grows ever dimmer, and the darkness of losing the Way deepens. The qi of Heaven becomes contrary and rebellious—how can governance be peaceful?\n\nPeople suffer its poison and harm—how can they attain longevity? The myriad things are injured and die prematurely in great numbers.\n\nThus, I repeatedly enjoin the Perfected Ones to transmit my writings, so that each person may reflect on the meaning of losing the Way, and each may worry and labor over their own illnesses. Then Heaven and Earth, the Thearch, the people, and the myriad things will all be at peace.\n\nPerfected One, if you delight in aligning with the heart of Heaven, you must not be negligent or careless.\n\nIndeed, indeed! I wish to ask one more question.",
      "overlap_context": "nd misfortune, it is mixed and impure, an inconstant fate that cannot be divined.\n\nExcellent. How many kinds of good and evil are there in the nature of Heaven and Earth, in years, months, and days? They cannot be fully enumerated. You are thoroughly intoxicated—your words are as if shrouded in mist. Heaven and Earth, years, months, and days have four kinds of conduct. The first is *impurity*, which governs transformations and anomalies.\n\nWhat does this mean? Now listen carefully, Perfected One.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Master speaks now of fortune and misfortune—are these merely the workings of the times?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, in your questioning you have grasped the meaning of the Dao. What reaches its utmost above must return below; what extends to its farthest outward must return inward. Thus, when yang reaches its extreme, it turns to yin; when yin reaches its nadir, it reverts to yang. What has gone to its end must return to its root.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, even minor deviations from the Dao’s intent have accumulated, passed down through generations, until falsehood and deceit have reached their extreme. How do we know this? Observe that among the myriad things and the people, many begin with goodness but end in evil—few complete what they start. Their words begin with substance but end in emptiness. The sages of old constantly observed the movements of the people to understand this, and thus they never lost the Way.\n\nExcellent, excellent indeed. I wish to ask one more question.\n\nProceed.\n\nIf, as the Celestial Master says, things have their nadir and their zenith—take, for example, nine ranks of people: at the highest extreme are the ethereal spirit-people, and at the lowest, slaves and servants. If those below study and ascend, can those at the highest extreme also descend again?\n\nExcellent is your question. Perfected One, you still seem unenlightened, not yet having penetrated the Dao of the Great Ultimate. These ethereal spirit-people merge their forms and powers with primordial qi, coexisting with the four seasons and the five phases. All spirit in humanity is received from Heaven’s qi, and Heaven’s qi is received from primordial qi. Spirit rides upon qi to move, so where there is qi, there is spirit; where there is spirit, there is qi. When spirit departs, qi is cut off; when qi perishes, spirit departs. Thus, without spirit, one dies; without qi, one dies.\n\nCould an ethereal spirit-person enter a human’s belly?\n\nIndeed.\n\nMoreover, the five phases arise and flourish from primordial qi, and spirit moves in unison with primordial qi, sharing the same body. Now, the five phases enter to become the human’s organs—among these nine ranks of people, can the highest extreme descend and re-enter the human body?\n\nExcellent, excellent. Though you have studied for a long time, you have only now glimpsed this teaching. You must refine your learning—without refinement, there is no benefit.\n\nIndeed.\n\nFrom the Celestial Master’s words, is the Dao of Heaven truly like a cycle?\n\nYes, you may be said to have understood it. Go now, and if you have further doubts, do not hesitate to ask.\n\nIndeed.",

It seeks to enrich the ruler, hence it instructs him. If it does not seek his enrichment, it will not deign to instruct him.\n\nIts manifestations are akin to how, when people share deep intimacy, they teach and guide one another in affairs. If their bond is not profoundly close, they will not teach or guide. Should one instruct and not be heeded, should one’s timely counsel be disregarded, then it will be abandoned and set aside, never again to be earnestly taught or shown.\n\nThereupon, calamities and omens arise, and Heaven no longer reveals its admonitions to mankind. In such a state, even the sagely and wise become as though deaf and blind, devoid of understanding.

      "translated_text": "Thus, the nature of Heaven and Earth is such that the lower rectifies and admonishes the upper, just as the upper rectifies and admonishes the lower. Each possesses strengths and shortcomings, and by mutually compensating for these, the myriad affairs of the Dao of Heaven all find their proper place.\n\nTherefore, though August Heaven is numinous and sagely, it has its shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of Earth. Thus, the myriad things receive their mandate from Heaven yet nourish their forms upon Earth. The Three Luminaries have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of fire. Though the Three Luminaries are numinous and bright, they cannot illuminate the depths of inner chambers, whereas fire shines within them. The greatest sages have their shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of the worthy. Humanity has its shortcomings, which do not match the strengths of the myriad things.\n\nThus, when admonition extends even to the lowest and most minute, the Dao is not lost, and the heart-mind of Heaven is attained. Therefore, Heaven generates all affairs, causing their seasons to undergo transformation and reform, all to admonish and correct the lord of men, thereby manifesting the signs of utmost virtue. One cannot but be greatly cautious in this.\n\nThe transformations and reforms of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things—these are their admonitions.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nSince the August Celestial Master has now made this clear, I wish to apply it to humanity.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nYou must carefully heed my words and ponder them deeply.\n\nWhen a minister possesses loyalty, goodness, sincerity, and trustworthiness, and admonishes and corrects his superior, yet the lord does not heed and employ him, but instead seeks to harm him, the minister is alarmed. Thereupon, he ties his tongue and becomes mute; the six directions close off and do not communicate. The worthy and learned, fearing trouble, thus conceal themselves; loyalty and trustworthiness lie hidden; the true Dao cannot be seen. Though the lord may be sagely and worthy, he hears nothing, and thus becomes deaf and blind, unable to perceive anything extraordinary. Day by day, darkness and obscurity prevail; the lord is deaf, the ministers are mute. Such calamity cannot be restrained. When ministers are benighted and the lord is blind, treachery and villainy run rampant. When ministers are mute and the lord is deaf, the world is cut off; good and evil are not distinguished. Heavenly disasters converge; the Six Extremities wage war; the world is wholly inauspicious. Can one not be cautious in this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity took omens, disasters, and prodigies with utmost gravity, using them to align and correct themselves. Therefore, in ten thousand cases, they did not err even once. In truth, this was because they acted in accord with the essential texts and the great Dao, exhausting their loyalty without further misfortune.\n\nYou must take these warnings to heart and carefully heed my words.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYet the loftiness and clarity of Heaven are not the achievement of a single essence’s virtue and power. When the emperor-king governs in accord with the heart-mind of Heaven, it is not the achievement of a single worthy minister. Now, my words merely raise the guiding principles to reveal the beginning. All affairs cannot be exhaustively recorded and explained; you must deeply ponder their intent yourself.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now. How could such discourse ever end? There is nothing more to ask.\n\nIndeed, indeed.",
      "overlap_context": ". It is like aligning a double mirror with the carpenter’s square, speaking face to face.\n\nTherefore, the numinous spirits are stirred by such alignment. But if one resists and refuses to heed their corrective counsel, then Heaven and Earth become inverted and disordered, the Five Phases and Four Seasons fall into chaos and rebellion, losing their proper principles. Thus, all undertakings miss their mark, and great misfortune ensues—this is what is meant.\n\nDo you now understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.",

What I now ask will surely incur profound reproach. Yet when I reflect upon the words written by my returned teacher, all is correct—nothing can be altered.\n\nBut this humble disciple, dull and benighted, remains bound in melancholy, unable to discern from whence the August Heavenly Spirit-Person derived these models and laws.\n\nNow, I marvel at the master’s accumulated wisdom, vast and unspoken. I beseech the master, in compassion, to reveal the celestial proofs of the yin-yang secrets and the essential divinations of the gods and spirits.\n\nAt present, my thoughts are in turmoil, my heart greatly disturbed. What I say must surely transgress the master’s taboos. Yet though I long to speak, I cannot restrain myself. Even if the Heavenly Master reproves me, I pray for the enlightening methods of celestial verification to be shown, so they may be transmitted for ten thousand generations, radiant and unquestioned—like the brightness of the sun at noon—unchanging from beginning to end, never to be abandoned.\n\nYet, do you truly still not believe my words?\nYou remain as one who has not yet fully awakened, who does not comprehend the heart-mind of Heaven.\nAre you not still foolish? You differ little from the common people.\nTo oppose my words is to invite chaos; to defy them is to court ruin.\n\nWhat I now say to you has all been examined and verified against the celestial patterns, aligned with the great secrets of yin and yang before being spoken.\nYou come to inquire of Heaven’s affairs; I transmit Heaven’s words and establish its laws—not daring to utter empty, false, or flattering speech.\n\nYou have lived through many years and days—how is it you have not observed the teeming myriad creatures, all of which dwell in accord with virtue while shunning the qi of punishment?\nThis is the luminous and essential proof of August Heaven.\nIt is the manifest evidence by which the governance of the ruler is measured in success or failure.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nIf you are now awakening yet still not fully awakened, I wish to further question your teachings and admonitions.\n\nNow, punishment and virtue are the clear manifestations of the divine governance of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang—the standards for the myriad creatures and the people.\n\nThus, in the eleventh month, great virtue resides in the *nine-one*, dwelling beneath the earth. The season of virtue is within the chamber, so there is qi within, and the myriad things return to it. The season of punishment is in the *six-four*, in the distant wilds, so there is no qi without, and it is clear and empty. The outer world is void of things, and the multitudes all return, following the king’s virtue into the Yellow Springs below.\n\nIn the twelfth month, virtue is in the *nine-two*. The season is in *chou*, dwelling in the center of the earth, not yet emerged. The season of virtue is in the Bright Hall, and the myriad things follow virtue upward, yet dare not emerge to be seen, for punishment is above.\n\nIn the first month, *yin*, virtue is in the *nine-three*. The myriad things, without exception, follow the flourishing virtue and delight in its abundance, being born between Heaven and Earth. The season of virtue resides in the courtyard.\n\nIn the second month, virtue is in the *nine-four*, in *mao*. It has departed from the earth but not yet reached Heaven, lingering at the boundary. Virtue is at the gate, so the myriad things all delight in emerging to peer through the gate.\n\nIn the third month, flourishing virtue is in the *nine-five*. In *chen*, it reaches the center of Heaven. The season of flourishing virtue is in the outer roadways, so the myriad things all emerge to dwell without.\n\nIn the fourth month, *si*, virtue is in the *nine-six*, extending to the six distant and eight borderlands. Flourishing virtue pervades the eight directions; good qi and yang qi respond and generate one another. The teeming creatures depart from the inner chambers to dwell in the wilds. The season of punishment is at the roots of the myriad things, residing within the inner chamber, so below is empty and without things, while above is lush and flourishing. None fail to delight in following virtue to govern. This is the great and luminous proof of governance through virtue.\n\nNow that I have reverently heard of the use of virtue, I wish to hear of the use of punishment.\n\nThus, in the fifth month, punishment is in the *six-one*, in *wu*, beneath the earth. Below and within, it is clear and without qi; the earth below is empty. The season of punishment is within the chamber, so there is nothing within, and all dwell without.\n\nIn the sixth month, punishment resides in the *six-two*, in *wei*, dwelling in the center of the earth, not yet emerged. The season of punishment is in the hall. The qi of punishment is within; the qi of virtue is without. The teeming creatures, without exception, delight in baring themselves and returning to the one of flourishing virtue.\n\nIn the seventh month, punishment is in the *six-three*. The season is in *shen*; punishment is in the courtyard. The myriad things dare not enter and firmly delight in dwelling without.\n\nIn the eighth month, punishment is in the *six-four*, in *you*. It has not yet reached the boundary of Heaven. The season of virtue is at the gate, and the myriad things all delight in gathering at the gate, rejoicing in entering and following virtue to return.\n\nIn the ninth month, punishment is in the *six-five*, in *xu*. It reaches the center of Heaven. The season of punishment is in the roadways, and the myriad things, without exception, are on the verge of death and distress, following virtue to conceal themselves. Thus, within, things daily flourish, while without, all is empty and perishing.\n\nIn the tenth month, punishment is in the *six-six*, in *hai*. Punishment extends to the six distant and eight borderlands and the four wilds. The teeming creatures, without exception, conceal themselves and flee, following virtue to the Bright Hall. Crawling creatures carry their young within; the wilds without are empty of multitudes. Is this not the consequence of those who delight in employing punishment, driving away the perverse?\n\nYet if the heart-mind desires to harbor punishment within to govern the multitudes, it will daily diminish them.\n\nThus, in the fifth month, harboring one punishment within causes one group of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the sixth month, harboring two punishments within causes two groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the seventh month, harboring three punishments within causes three groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the eighth month, harboring four punishments within causes four groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the ninth month, harboring five punishments within causes five groups of multitudes to rebel.\nIn the tenth month, harboring six punishments within causes six groups of multitudes to rebel.\nThus, without, all is void of things, and all flee within. This is the clear proof and evidence.\n\nTherefore, those who govern with punishment are outwardly respectful yet inwardly rebellious, so the multitudes daily diminish.\n\nThus, in the eleventh month, harboring one virtue within causes one group of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the twelfth month, harboring two virtues within causes two groups of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the first month, harboring three virtues within causes three groups of multitudes to enter and follow.\nIn the second month, harboring four virtues within causes multitudes from the four directions to enter and follow.\nIn the third month, harboring five yang virtues within causes five groups of worthy multitudes to enter and follow.",

      "translated_text": "In the fourth month, harboring six virtues within causes the myriad things to emerge and appear together, all bustling without exception, both within and without submitting to it. This is the clear proof of Heaven’s law.\n\nIn the second and eighth months, virtue and punishment are evenly matched, so in the second month, half of the things are harmed by cold, and in the eighth month, half of the things are likewise harmed by cold. At the time of the second month, virtue desires to lead its multitudes forth through the gate, while punishment desires to draw its multitudes back within the gate, both standing at the boundary. Thus, in the second and eighth months, the myriad things encounter virtue and punishment in equal measure, life and death balanced, and so half are harmed.\n\nYou now delight in knowing the constant laws of Heaven and Earth, the clear proofs of yin and yang—this is precisely it. Punishment daily harms and kills, and though the people dread it, they cannot be made to yield their strength; instead, they say there are no people. Virtue daily unfolds and grows, without punishment or fear, yet the myriad things submit and surrender, all coming to assist the king in governance. This is the clear proof of Heaven, evident and beyond doubt.\n\nNow, if people cannot be governed without awe and fear, what is to be done? Yet the sages and noble men of antiquity ruled others through the Dao and virtue, not through physical force or punishment. Those who take no joy in goodness and whose virtue is weak instead seek to govern through the threat of punishment—yet they only see their people depart.\n\nPunishment can only be used to relieve distress and resolve entanglements; it is not sufficient to give life to the myriad things. Clearly, the bustling multitudes belong to virtue as their leader. Now, if people do not submit inwardly but instead deceive and betray, the great fault lies here.\n\nYou have come repeatedly over time to study and ask about many matters, accumulating much written knowledge, yet you have not yet fully trusted my words. Have you now gained some understanding?\n\nChun prostrates himself in reverence, bowing deeply. My transgressions are grave, and I have failed the teachings of my enlightened teacher and divine person. Inwardly ashamed, I sweat with remorse. Though my virtue is meager and my station low, and though I have studied for many days, my heart remains dull and cannot fully grasp the words of my enlightened teacher. Thus, I dare not refrain from asking again and again—greatly lacking in humility, I have long caused you, my teacher, concern. It is only that my learning remains unrefined. You must be cautious.\n\nHeaven hangs forth its signs and establishes its laws for humankind, setting forth teachings and commands for emperors and kings to follow in governance, not erring even once. If you wish to understand its meaning, this is precisely it.\n\nYet governance is not limited to this single method. If Heaven is constantly vexed and resentful, disasters will abound. You must take heed.\n\nWhen Heaven is about to raise something up, it takes its model from virtue; when it is about to bring decline and ruin, it follows the pattern of punishment. This is what is meant.\n\nMy words carefully align with the rules of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, following the principles of Heaven and Earth. I speak as Heaven’s clear voice, setting forth teachings and commands to instruct you. My words are like the tip of an arrow—no different. Follow them, and you will daily prosper; oppose them, and you will bring ruin upon yourself.\n\nHeaven’s law is divine—how divine! Thus, the divine persons, true persons, and great sages of antiquity, who were able to establish profound systems of law and create standards for emperors and kings, all perceived the essential patterns of Heaven’s signs. They alone inwardly understood the meaning of yin and yang, and only then did they follow Heaven and Earth in governance, aligning their hearts with the divine and observing what could be done. Thus, in their governance, they did not err even once.\n\nNow, foolish officials and common people believe Heaven’s laws can be recklessly violated, acting wantonly without regard for standards. Thus, they bring great disorder to their ruler’s governance—the great fault lies here.\n\nNow that you have received this book, why do you not carefully ponder it in your heart, reflect upon it earnestly, and contemplate it in a quiet chamber? Meditate on Heaven’s ways, and only then can you transmit Heaven’s teachings, instructing the ignorant and assisting the emperor and king in establishing laws.\n\nWhen considering the use of punishment, you must deeply reflect on where punishment resides: all who follow it depart, leaving it solitary and without multitudes. Thus, in winter, punishment lies in the four wilds, with no people, and the myriad things all rebel, hiding within to avoid it. In summer, punishment lies within, and the myriad things all emerge to submit to virtue, leaving the underground chambers and inner rooms empty. Punishment remains solitary, while all follow virtue to the wilds.\n\nWhen virtue is outside, the myriad things submit to the outside; when virtue is in secluded emptiness, things submit within. Heaven’s punishment is of utmost severity, and though it may suppress and subdue the people and the myriad things, why then can it not restrain its multitudes? Is this not strange?\n\nPunishment must not be lightly or recklessly used. Harm one upright qi, and Heaven’s qi is thrown into chaos; harm one compliant qi, and Earth’s qi is thrown into rebellion. Harm one scholar, and all scholars vanish; harm one worthy person, and all worthy people hide. Every matter will be shaken.\n\nThus, the sages, sage kings, and divine rulers of antiquity deeply perceived these warnings from Heaven and feared them, not daring to act recklessly. They feared losing Heaven’s favor and being unable to secure their own well-being. Those of supreme imperial virtue alone penetrated the clear proofs of the Dao and virtue. Without oppression or intimidation, the multitudes submitted to them and followed them. Thus, they guarded the Dao to preserve themselves and upheld virtue without daring to lose it.\n\nYou must recite and study my book, and if your heart has doubts, always keep this scroll close at hand, reviewing it day and night as a clear warning and proof. Only then will you grasp Heaven’s intent. To oppose this is to oppose Heaven itself.\n\nThis is like the reversal of qian and kun in the *Yi*—it cannot be done. It is like the movement of the Six Jia—it cannot be altered. It is like the fixed laws of the Five Phases—they cannot be lost. It is like the brightness of the sun and moon—it cannot be obscured. It is like the ruler above and the minister below—their order cannot be disrupted. This is how the governance of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, is made clear. There are those who delight in practicing virtue, and there are foolish people who instead delight in punishment. You should constantly observe this book to dispel confusion, striving to teach people to be good scholars, to uphold the Dao and virtue, and to set aside punishment.\n\nMy book repeatedly sets forth Heaven’s laws. Is practicing the Dao and virtue easy? Is practicing punishment and penalties difficult?",

      "translated_text": "To love is to see daily increase; to intimidate is to see daily decline. Your illness has departed—go forth and transmit my book for Heaven, without doubt. My book’s words bear no debt to the vastness of Heaven and Earth and the Six Directions.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. I shall return and reflect on my faults, considering only the order of above and below, never daring to lose even one part.\"\n\nGo, be vigilant and cautious. If you cannot distinguish and ponder deeply the intent of my book, simply observe the great workings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. From the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, virtue resides without, and all things emerge to follow the King outward—creeping creatures leave their burrows, and people depart their chambers. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, virtue resides within, and all things return to follow the King inward—burrowing creatures retreat into their dens, and people return to their homes. This is the clear effect of governance by virtue.\n\nFrom the Spring Equinox to the Autumn Equinox, punishment governs within, and all things follow their emergence outward, leaving the interior empty and still. From the Autumn Equinox to the Spring Equinox, punishment governs without, and outside, there are no creatures, no qi, no people—all enter to follow virtue. This is the proof that punishment cannot be used for governance.\n\nThus, virtue aligns its heart and power with Heaven: when yang emerges, it emerges; when yang withdraws, it withdraws. Punishment aligns its power and heart with Earth: when yin emerges, it emerges; when yin withdraws, it withdraws. Virtue shares its power with the qi of life: when the life qi emerges, it emerges; when it withdraws, it withdraws. Punishment shares its power with the qi of killing: when the killing qi emerges, it emerges; when it withdraws, it withdraws. Virtue ranks alongside the movements of Heaven above; punishment ranks alongside the movements of Earth below. Virtue always dwells with the substantial; punishment always dwells with emptiness and nothingness. Virtue always dwells with flourishing: when flourishing is without, it emerges; when flourishing is within, it withdraws—thus it withdraws in winter and emerges in summer. Punishment dwells with decline and the qi of death: thus it emerges in winter and withdraws in summer. The qi of death is clear, and so wherever it resides, clarity prevails.\n\nThus, virtue shares its qi with the Emperor and King: when the King rules without, yin emerges; when the King rules within, punishment withdraws. Punishment shares its position with petty men, and so wherever it resides, there are no people. What things return to is the accumulation of the Emperor and King’s virtue, which is always seen to return—thus they are called Emperor and King. Punishment has never dwelled with things, nor with people, and so it cannot be called a noble ruler.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity pondered deeply, observing the workings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, taking them as their teachers and models. Knowing that in their great... not a single part could be lost, they dared not transgress them. This is the clear proof of Heaven and Earth’s order—can one not consider it carefully? Can one not be cautious?\n\nThis is the natural law, not dependent on any particular person. It is the constant movement of Heaven and Earth, and now I have fully revealed it to you. You should repeatedly reflect deeply on its meaning and act without carelessness.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. I dare not fail.\"\n\nGo. I have now fully transmitted the true teachings to you, and my worries are resolved. Remove Heaven’s faults, act with utmost virtue, and restore the King’s flourishing. Do not dare to sever this transmission, lest you suffer its harm.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nHerein lies the examination of Heaven’s laws to clarify the successes and failures of governance from ancient times to the present.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Four, concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Forty-Five.",

      "translated_text": "Here begins *The Formula for Unearthing Scriptures*, Scroll Sixty-One.\n\nThe lowly and ignorant, unable to restrain the desires of their hearts, have presumptuously transgressed the taboos of the Heavenly Master, committing grievous faults. Yet their intended words cannot be stilled; the petty person, unable to endure, feels their five viscera churn with vexation and constraint.\n\nI beg to ask one great doubt: since the Heavenly Master treats me with the tenderness due a newborn child, you must surely pity my hunger and thirst for knowledge. Why then be so reserved in expounding the Dao?\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow the Heavenly Master, in concert with the August Heaven and Sacred Earth, unites spirit and thought, his heart in profound accord with the will of Heaven and Earth—like nested compasses or aligned squares, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Knowing the constant concerns of Heaven and Earth, how could this lowly one, unworthy of life, dare to advance and pose these questions, overcome with shame? Yet I wish to know: what are the great taboos of Heaven, Earth, and the divine spirits?\n\n\"Excellent! Your devotion grows ever more earnest. You may now ask, for your question aligns precisely with the heart and mind of Heaven and Earth. Once known to humanity, it will lodge in the hearts of the worthy and never depart for ten thousand generations. I have long wished to speak of this, but had none to address. Now that a true person asks, my heart rejoices in this revelation. I shall explain it to you in full, hiding nothing. The reason is this: I fear that the divine spirits of Heaven and Earth deeply abhor such matters, and if I conceal them, I would bring great calamity upon myself. True person, sit calmly and listen clearly.\n\nWhat do Heaven and Earth most bitterly detest? They despise disobedience and lack of filial piety. What does this mean? I wish to hear it.\"\n\n\"Excellent is your inquiry. Within the harmony of Heaven and Earth, there are three qi that, though distinct, unite as one household to govern and nurture all things. Heaven presides over generation and is called Father. Earth presides over nourishment and is called Mother. Humanity presides over governance and is called Child. The Father should instruct and regulate with timely measures; the Mother follows the Father’s actions to nurture. The Child, born by the Father’s mandate and fed by the Mother’s sustenance, ought to revere the Father and love the Mother. Why is this so?\n\nThe Father’s teachings have their proper measures and seasons. Thus, Heaven instructs through the four seasons to generate, nurture, and bring all things to completion, each in its appointed time. When the wicked defy this, it is as if the Child disobeys the Father. Heaven’s qi loses its governance, and its will is thwarted. Heaven then deeply abhors such people and sends down calamities and anomalies to afflict its Child. It is like a household where the father, enraged, disciplines his child—the transformation occurs at once.\n\nWhen father and child are at odds, and the father resents the child’s defiance of his stern teachings, yin overcomes yang, the inferior deceives the superior, and many rebellious children arise. Ministers neglect their duties, malevolent spirits flourish, and together they sicken humanity. The cunning and deceitful lurk by the wayside, while all manner of yin forces, lurking and disobedient, bring blame upon those who defy Heaven and Earth. True person, how could you not obey this?\n\nThis is the natural defense, like a shadow following form or a trailing horse never parting—heed this warning.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow I have reverently received the Heavenly Master’s teachings and the instructions of Heaven.

Those who dig deep reach the Yellow Springs below; those who dig shallow go down several *zhang*. Within, the Mother alone grieves in fury. Her many children are grossly unfilial, constantly suffering from boundless resentment and unresolved sorrow, yet unable to make their voices heard.\n\nIn ancient times, the sages’ timely influence did not extend to their Way, allowing the people to act recklessly, claiming the earth felt no pain. But within, the earth alone suffers grievously without measure. This rises to move Heaven, yet people remain unaware. The Mother, distressed by her children’s inability to restrain themselves, appeals to the Father on high against humanity. Her grievances accumulate over time, piling up again and again, until the Father’s wrath knows no end. Disasters and anomalies of every kind arise together. The Mother, likewise displeased, remains perpetually angry and refuses to nourish the people and the myriad things with her power.\n\nWhen both Father and Mother are displeased, the myriad things and the people perish—all for want of the Dao. The conduct of later generations grows daily worse, failing to accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth. Instead, they resent Heaven and Earth, their words discordant. They further resent their emperors and kings, claiming they cannot govern justly within their domains. Each person commits transgressions against Heaven and Earth yet remains unaware, instead shifting blame onto their superiors. Thus, Heaven and Earth no longer love humanity.\n\nThey watch people die in an instant.

Thus, disasters multiply daily, and they truly incur the resentment of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the Father and Mother of humanity.

Day and night, it bores into him, and the man falls ill, even to the point of death.\nThe disparity between humans and the earth is just like this.\nThough the worm is tiny, why does it still destroy the man?\nPerfected One, why do you persist in such profound ignorance? Are you no different from the common folk?\n\nTruly, I fall short.\nIf even you fall short, what can be said of ordinary people?\nI have erred in my foolishness. I only wish to hear of my shortcomings from the Heavenly Master, that you might fully explain this to one as dull as I.\n\nVery well, I shall not conceal it.\nI know the severity of the earth’s afflictions, which is why I speak to you thus.\nNow, let me tell you another matter, that you may perceive it with even greater clarity.\n\nIndeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Now, a mighty man of great strength can restrain even scabies mites—such tiny things are beneath notice. Yet if a single dou of creatures were to feed upon a man together, his sickness and pain would leave him unable to lie down, and in severe cases, bedridden. Now, scabies mites and fleas, though small, when gathered in great numbers and feeding together upon a man, each and every one of them kills him. Scabies mites and fleas alike cause a man vexation and restlessness, preventing him from sitting at ease, and all give rise to sores and ulcers. The disparity between humans and the earth is just like this—do you comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nVery well. Perhaps you find what I have said insufficient to serve as a model, so now I shall explain it to you. Though humans are small, their grievances and sorrows toward the earth’s form make it abundantly clear to them that they bear deep fault and blame, which can be seen at once.\n\nNow, a single large *li* contains a hundred households and a hundred wells; a single township, a thousand households and a thousand wells; a single county, ten thousand households and ten thousand wells; a single commandery, a hundred thousand households and a hundred thousand wells; a single province, a hundred million households and a hundred million wells. A large well measures one *zhang*, a medium well several *chi*, and a small well three *chi*. Now, if one were to bore through the earth down to the Yellow Springs, how many such wells would the world contain? Some households have several wells, but let us calculate only by small wells: ten wells extend three *zhang*, a hundred wells thirty *zhang*, a thousand wells three hundred *zhang*, ten thousand wells three thousand *zhang*, and a hundred thousand wells thirty thousand *zhang*. How many wells in the world are like this in total? Boring into the earth, one finds water everywhere—water is the earth’s blood and vessels. Now, if one were to bore into your body and reach its blood and vessels, would the illness not be severe?\n\nNow, how many *li* in breadth and length would a hundred million wells occupy? Calculate this yourself—how many hundred million wells does the world contain? Thus, the grievance humans inflict upon Heaven and Earth is already clear. You harm and sicken your mother, causing grave illness. The earth’s *qi* leaks and dissipates, its affliction profound, yet people neither cherish nor pity it. Instead, they complain, “Why are Heaven and Earth not perfectly harmonious?” Is this not perverse?\n\nThis is only considering the wells. Now, how many great mounds, hills, and tombs exist in the world? How many mountains and hills have been excavated for metals and stones, for kiln-fired tiles and erected pillars? How many reckless diggings and cuttings, how many blockages and obstructions where passage should be open? How many such instances are there? Now, these springs and waterways—some should flow, some should be open—yet how many have been blocked or bored through? When springs and waterways should flow freely, their benefit spreads, following the earth’s natural channels from high to low. Yet now, some act otherwise, recklessly boring into the earth’s form, creating sores and ulcers, or blocking and severing what should be open. When royal governance is disharmonious, the earth suffers grave illness, yet none speak of its pain and distress. The earth’s spirit cries out to Heaven without cease, its grievance unending. Heaven and Earth thus grow displeased together, and so the Great Harmony and pure *qi* become difficult to attain—Perfected One, do you comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, humans live between Heaven and Earth and must have dwellings to shelter themselves and wells to drink from—how could it be otherwise?\n\nExcellent is your question. Heaven does not resent humans having dwellings, but when they bore too deeply into the earth, they create sores and ulcers. Sometimes they reach the earth’s bones, sometimes its blood—what does this mean? Springs are the earth’s blood, stones its bones, and fertile soil its flesh. Boring into deep springs is like drawing blood; breaking stones is like breaking bones. When fertile soil is deeply excavated and tiles, stones, and sturdy wood are embedded within, the earth’s strength is harmed. The earth alone suffers grievously—what is to be done now? The earth is the mother of the myriad things. Those who delight in and nurture it do not realize its weight. It is like a woman with child in her womb: if she follows the Way and does not recklessly bore into her own body, her mother remains unharmed. But if she recklessly bores into her mother while seeking life, her mother falls ill. If people do not recklessly bore deeply into the earth but merely dwell upon its surface, just enough to shelter themselves, the earth does not suffer. Great is the love for humans that brings them good fortune. Now, I wish to hear how much excavation is permissible for shelter.\n\nGenerally, when moving earth, one should not penetrate deeper than three *chi*, merely raising the surface. Why is three *chi* the standard? The first *chi* is where sunlight reaches, and its *qi* belongs to Heaven. The second *chi* is where things grow, and its *qi* belongs to the harmonious center. The third *chi* reaches the earth’s body, and its *qi* is yin. Beyond this, one harms the earth’s form, and all becomes inauspicious.\n\nWhat of the ancients who dwelled in caves?\n\nThey too harmed the earth’s form. Most settled in mountain valleys, carving out grottoes and relying on the terrain, using few wooden beams or pillars in the earth. With fewer pillars in the ground and often near flowing water, their harm to the earth was slight, and thus they suffered little illness. Later generations, unaware of their error, recklessly harmed the earth deeply, and so many did not live long. Why? This is grave illness.\n\nNow, even those who live near flowing water and do not dig wells often fall ill and do not live long. Why? Heaven and Earth are already angered, and their neighbors bear the burden together, like a family’s transgression affecting its brothers. Now, some people do not move earth or build but merely occupy old dwellings, yet still encounter misfortune. Why? Their conduct is inauspicious, offending the spirits.\n\nWhat spirits?\n\nSpirits are not one, and their names cannot be foretold. Perfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, people living upon the earth do not strive to teach one another goodness, and so their actions and transgressions rebound upon each other. This is grievance.\n\nNow, some live far from flowing water and must dig wells to drink and live—what is to be done?\n\nExcellent is your question. Where old wells exist, it is fitting to share them together and drink from them. Be careful not to change them frequently.",

Should you wish to know its effect, consider a person: one with thick skin is difficult to draw blood from, yet once blood is drawn, it is still an injury. One with thin skin is easily bled, and though the blood flows readily, it is likewise an injury—both are harm. For blood is the solemn token of Heaven and Earth’s covenant.\n\nHe who wounds another does not distinguish between thick or thin skin. The sight of blood makes the transgression plain. Man is the image of Heaven and Earth; neither desires to see injury. When injured, they grow wrathful—why then would the earth alone delight in being wounded? Heaven and Earth are the true root of man, the father and mother of yin and yang. How could you presume to harm your own parents?\n\nYou, Perfected One, ought to ponder this deeply in your heart.

      "translated_text": "Those in the world who delight in goodness and bring joy to others find nothing so excellent as cherishing a virtuous woman—once obtained, she becomes a partner in bearing children, united in heart. Truly, such goodness is lovable beyond compare. Now, if a ruler were granted ten thousand such women, all would rejoice at the sight, and men’s bodies would forget their age. Yet could this alone pacify Heaven and Earth, win the hearts of all nations, and make the eight distant realms echo in response, bringing universal peace? My Way alone can secure the boundless heavens above and harmonize the limitless earth below. The eight directions will all delight and submit, and even the restless multitude will be transformed by its virtue, each finding their rightful place. How great is its worth? Ponder this deeply.\n\nIf you wish to repay Heaven’s profound favor and win its heart, swiftly offer my scriptures in return. Were you to pile up rare treasures and precious goods to the heavens, Heaven would not rejoice, nor would you gain its true favor. To win Heaven’s heart, you must day and night reflect on my words—once you grasp their meaning, you will also gain Heaven’s heart. How immeasurable is their worth?\n\nThus, bestowing a thousand gold pieces upon a state is not as valuable as imparting a single essential teaching that can govern. Presenting ten thousand pairs of jade disks is not as beneficial as advancing two great worthies. For essential teachings and great worthies, the precious Way, alone enable a ruler to govern in ease, attain great joy, and bring about peace, dispelling disasters and calming the world. How priceless are such essential teachings, great worthies, and the wondrous Way?\n\nTherefore, the sage-kings of old were never impoverished in wealth, yet they constantly lamented their poverty in men of talent. They grieved that great worthies were few, the people scattered, and all sought attachment elsewhere, growing ever more distant. Thus, they failed to meet Heaven’s will and lived in constant sorrow. If one merely delights in amassing rare and deceptive treasures, cherishing them, one cannot win the hearts of Heaven and Earth or pacify the four seas.\n\nThough gold, jade, and rare treasures be piled for a thousand miles, reaching the heavens, they cannot summon great worthies, sages, or immortals to assist in governance. Study my scriptures carefully, and great worthies will come of their own accord to aid the ruler’s governance. In a single day, they will unite in counsel, like people gathering in a marketplace, each bringing their resources. Those who follow my scriptures will find Heaven and Earth grow brighter, the sun, moon, and stars all radiant with renewed light, shining to the farthest reaches. The eight directions and the four barbarians will see it and joyfully submit. Worthies and scholars will all emerge, no longer concealed. Weapons and armor will vanish, and the world will proceed in effortless harmony, no longer harming one another. With one heart, all will delight in the ruler.\n\nMy scriptures alone can bring this about. How immeasurable is their worth? Do you now understand?\n\nThus, the sages of old deeply understood the Way and valued the harmony of qi, never hoarding earthly goods but entrusting them to the virtuous. The virtuous comprehend the hearts of Heaven and Earth, hence they honor the Way and revere virtue. Fools prize rare and deceptive treasures, so Heaven’s scriptures do not descend, and sages do not bestow their teachings—this is the reason. Take heed, my words are not false. Guard my Way well.\n\nOne who clings to precious jades, gold, and wealth, sitting in darkness to guard them, cannot sleep—such is the folly of prizing mere treasures. How can they compare to the transmission of Heaven’s sacred and secret charts and scriptures, which alone can pacify Heaven and Earth, the six directions, and the eight distant realms?

From the moment one receives instruction, one must not transgress or stray into wrongdoing, but day by day turn toward goodness with gladness, harboring no ill intent and never opposing the master’s will—such is the disciple of supreme virtue.\n\nAlas! What the Perfected One has spoken nearly resembles this, yet it is not the disciple of supreme virtue, but only one of middling virtue.\n\nIn truth, I fall short. This foolish student, seeing the master’s stern decree, has forced himself to speak of three matters. If these three do not meet the Heavenly Master’s expectations, the fault and reproach will be grave indeed. I fear further transgressions that cannot be absolved.\n\nYet all people fall short in their conduct—you bear no ill intent, and thus no blame.\n\nNow the people of the world are all profoundly benighted, not one of them knowing what is right.\n\nEven when the Perfected One explains matters in this way, what hope is there for the common folk and the ignorant? Their constant failure to comprehend, their blind adherence to their own foolish hearts—this is only to be expected.\n\nMay the Heavenly Master, in his compassion, continue to instruct and clarify what they do not yet grasp. The kindness of this enlightened master’s guidance is deeply cherished.\n\nI shall now set forth for the Perfected One a full account—you must exert yourself and commit it to memory.\n\nVery well, I shall.\n\nNow the minister of supreme virtue, like the common subject, conducts himself thus: from dawn to dusk, he constantly worries for his lord and king, his heart set on bringing them peace. He grieves for their afflictions and pains, ever delighting when the emperor may govern with ease, while his ministers and people all emulate him in filial piety and kindness. In his governance, he seeks only to allow the ruler to sit in tranquility and wander at leisure. Such rule wins the favor of Heaven above and the approval of Earth below, while at the center, the myriad people rejoice without grievance or neglect. All creatures that walk, crawl, or fly turn toward his influence and are transformed, none perishing from plague, and all things attain their rightful place. Heaven and Earth harmonize, the Three Qi rejoice together, and the lord’s lifespan is extended while his years multiply. The people, in turn, seek rare prescriptions and extraordinary arts, uncovering hidden texts and bringing forth all that was concealed. The world responds in unison, crying out in admiration: “Wonderful! Such a thing has never been seen before!” From the eldest to the youngest child, none know how to do evil again. All hold fast to these wondrous arts and offer them to the emperor. When the emperor obtains them, he may prolong his years. All grieve that their lord is aging, yet when his rule aligns with the heart of Heaven, Heaven and Earth may send spirits bearing medicines to announce, “Take and consume these, and you shall know no end in this life.” Such is the achievement of the minister and subject of supreme virtue. Does the Perfected One now understand?\n\nVery well.\n\nYou may be said to have awakened. Thus did the ministers and people of the Supreme Sovereign of Great Antiquity conduct themselves—this was their way. How was such perfect governance attained? By this Dao, this Way, the foremost scripture of Great Antiquity. If the Perfected One deeply contemplates its meaning, he shall attain the heart of Heaven. I have reverently received this from the heart of Heaven, and below, I employ it to relieve the virtuous lord of disasters and remove all harms. In awe of Heaven’s majesty, how dare I not exhaust my words? Heaven has commanded that I swiftly record this for the Perfected One and deliver it to the virtuous lord, that his rule may resemble Heaven—how then would it differ from Heaven?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the Heavenly Master’s words, I now perceive that the balanced qi of Great Peace has truly arrived. The means to attain it have been revealed. What cause is there for sorrow?\n\nYet these are not your concerns—why then do you rejoice at goodness and grieve at evil?\n\nThe reason is this: when the qi of goodness arrives, the qi of evil and perversity withdraws, and I remain at peace, free from illness and harm. But when the qi of evil arrives and the qi of goodness withdraws, I fear calamity and dare not act—such is the case throughout the world. Thus, I rejoice at goodness.\n\nExcellent indeed are your words. May the Heavenly Master, in his compassion, now speak of the methods of supreme filial piety.\n\nExcellent is your question. Now the foremost filial child of supreme virtue thinks constantly of his parents, who are aging and soon to depart. He dwells alone in quiet contemplation, grieving deeply, seeking arts to prevent their death so that he may remain with them. He values the Dao above wealth, seeking only to sustain their lives. He plays mournful melodies on the zither to gladden their hearts, guiding their minds toward the Dao, delighting in the thought of dwelling with them forever without aging. He tirelessly seeks rare prescriptions, traveling to distant lands, his sincerity moving Heaven, his efforts unceasing until the end. His clothing and food are sufficient, and he no longer stores up treasures for future generations. Instead, he spares his parents all sorrow, for even the spirits of those who have died before them in the household are not at ease in their grief. He eats without seeking blessings, saying only, “Exert yourselves and take care in the underworld—do not torment yourselves by grieving for those who remain.” Such is the conduct of the most filial child of the Supreme Sovereign of Great Antiquity. When the four directions hear of his goodness, all rejoice from afar and delight in emulating him. Thus, they give rise to ministers of kindness and filial piety for the emperor. The filial child’s concern for his parents and the virtuous minister’s concern for his lord should be like this.\n\nNow what the Perfected One has just described barely meets the standard—each seeks only to preserve their own well-being. What benefit does this bring to lord, father, or master? How can one call this a person of supreme virtue? This is merely one who seeks self-preservation and personal gain. If even the Perfected One considers this good, how much more so the common folk? Those who see themselves as cautious and trustworthy, who do not violate the king’s laws and bear no guilt, weep and wail, declaring, “I have not betrayed Heaven, nor my lord, nor my father, nor my master!”",

Yet where understanding falls short, this is something shared by all under Heaven from ancient times to the present. Speak plainly.\n\nVery well.",

      "translated_text": "Your conduct merely suffices to preserve your own well-being, yet you deeply claim merit before your superiors, wailing to Heaven and Earth—such are all inferior and foolish people, incapable of becoming those of supreme virtue. The reason I now distinguish and expound this to you, Perfected One, is to have you transmit these words in writing to a lord of superior virtue, that he may profoundly instruct the multitude of worthies, causing them all to awaken and discern whether their conduct is right or wrong—does it truly benefit their lord, father, or master?\n\nSince the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, people have grown increasingly foolish, daily more avaricious. For the sake of their perverse conduct, they falsely claim merit before Heaven and Earth, their lord, father, and master—these are utterly rebellious, unprincipled people. Does the Perfected One not know this?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have awakened. Now, to practice true goodness is exceedingly difficult—be cautious. If you do not diligently propagate my teachings to resolve the great afflictions of Heaven and Earth, enabling the emperor to govern without care or trouble, so that all under Heaven rejoice, even the grasses and trees, then you have not yet become one who responds to the supreme good. You are merely one who preserves his own person—how then can you be placed alongside Heaven and Earth?\n\nThose who delight in preserving their own well-being—petty men are especially prone to this. Do you understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have awakened—be cautious.\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow, this Master pities the foolish, lowly, and unenlightened beings. I wish to hear again of the conduct of the disciples of supreme goodness.\nThe disciples of supreme goodness, having received the Dao and virtue from their master, bear in mind the grace of their teacher and thus attain completion as persons. They are able to follow worthy companions long and unerringly, maintaining their ranks. Some obtain official positions to repay their parents, while others deeply enter the Dao, mastering the arts of self-nurturance. When a person is born to parents, completes the Dao and virtue under a master, and gains honor and esteem from their lord, they often dwell alone, contemplating the aging of their lord, father, and master, and that none can replace them. They constantly think of performing deeds for their master—obtaining rare methods and extraordinary texts—to repay his merit. Their thoughts are upright and pained, yet they find nothing extraordinary. Thus, they further study under the worthy, entrust themselves to their master, and speak on his behalf, enabling their master to become a fine assistant to the state, thereby further benefiting the governance of the emperor. Such are the disciples of supreme goodness from the Highest Antiquity. Later generations, enlightened lords and worthies, are called people of supreme goodness.\n\nIf, Perfected One, you now merely speak of easy teachings, caution, and trustworthiness, yet fail to comprehend the master’s heart, you merely conform to the role of a disciple, striving only to perfect yourself. What benefit does this bring to your superiors, that you should call yourself a good disciple? Even what the Perfected One describes—let alone the common folk—are those who constantly claim merit before their masters, and this is indeed so.\n\nAs ministers, sons, and disciples, if one does not follow the instructions of lord, father, or master, all are guilty of great rebellion and cannot be named again. The good sons, good ministers, and good disciples the Perfected One speaks of merely avoid transgressions—foolish indeed! What can be called good? Thus, the common people are foolish, and only you, Perfected One, have long been thoroughly enlightened. Now, by your words, I have measured them and know they have truly lost the correct path, long mired in falsehood and delusion.\n\nTherefore, Heaven alone knows this deeply, hence its anger and displeasure, the accumulation of disasters, and the mutual burden of transgressions. If, as the Perfected One says, one merely preserves oneself and avoids wrongdoing, yet claims merit before Heaven, Earth, and others, this is the height of folly—be ever cautious. Your words do not yet fully accord with the will of Heaven. The reason I have the Perfected One speak is not for your sake, but to observe the gains and losses of the common people—what constitutes their greatest transgression? Thus, I have you speak to discern their crookedness or straightness. Do you truly understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nGo—you have awakened.\n\nAt first, when the Perfected One awakened, I did not wish to speak with you. Seeing your earnestness and daily devotion to goodness, I have spoken deeply with you, expounding the intent of Heaven and Earth, resolving the sorrows of emperors, the grievances of the common people, and the disorder of the myriad things. Now that I have set forth these teachings and principles for you, I hold nothing back—only strive to remember them.\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nI have observed many disciples, but few can be spoken with, so I have not discussed these matters thoroughly with them. Thus, my Dao has never been transmitted—do you understand?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nGo—you have understood.\n\nNow that this Master has pitied his disciple and spoken frankly without reservation: when the lord is worthy, ministers are often loyal; when the master is enlightened, disciples often speak without reservation. Excellent indeed are your words. Having grasped their meaning, act upon them.",

      "translated_text": "Just as the Son of Heaven possesses the great granaries’ grain and the imperial storehouses’ silks and cottons—how many bushels and pecks fill the great granaries? Yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single pint. Those who commit transgressions, instead, are cast into its prisons, where their crimes are adjudicated and their punishments meted out. This is a manifest consequence.\n\nNow, people are truly wicked and do not accord with Heaven’s will, so Heaven does not fully dispense its efficacious medicinal formulas. Instead, day by day, it sends forth spirits and numinous beings to examine, flog, and strike those without proper conduct. Thus, the sick do not cease, and the dead are many. This is like a prefecture in turmoil, where prisons overflow with criminals and violent deaths abound—such is the meaning.\n\nIf one renders great service to the Son of Heaven, one’s palaces and storehouses will overflow with official grain, silks, and cottons, ensuring constant clothing and sustenance. The lives of the people and the Son of Heaven depend on this: one need only constantly think of governing with the good. Why withhold or begrudge? The duty of the ruler is to assemble the multitude of worthies and, with gentle harmony, govern the world together.\n\nA lord without worthy ministers, a father without filial sons, a teacher without obedient and good disciples—such sorrows cannot be fully expressed. Thus, in high antiquity, the Three Sovereigns governed with folded arms, free from affairs and cares. Their ministers were prudent and good, grieving for their lords as if in constant heartache, and so they dared to assist their lords in pacifying the world. Moreover, they sought and obtained the immortal formulas of Heaven to bestow upon their lords, and thus their lords attained longevity. Some, having rendered great service—so great that they ascended together as immortals—shared in the governance of Heaven’s affairs, and Heaven in turn clothed and fed them. This is a manifest consequence, not empty words.\n\nYet since the middle antiquity, many have envied the true Dao, sealing and cutting it off, deceiving one another with false ways, beguiling the people, and reducing the number of the worthy. Thus, lords and ministers alike suffer hardship, unable even to pacify the world, and many do not attain longevity. This is not solely the fault of those in the lower antiquity; its origins are long-standing, and the great blame lies here. Do you, too, not know this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, Heaven above has amassed wondrous formulas and immortal robes beyond measure, yet without great merit, one cannot obtain them. It is like one who possesses the prefecture’s halls and storehouses, its grain, money, silks, and cottons, dwelling constantly by the great Dao as if at home, without fleeing or hiding. Yet those without merit or virtue cannot obtain even a single peck of grain, a single coin, or an inch of silk or cotton. This is a manifest consequence.\n\nTherefore, since the high and middle antiquity, the true Dao has daily declined, and so the true formulas of longevity and immortality cannot be obtained. Those who, by their transgressions, attain longevity alone are merely the longest-lived in the world. Why is this? Where true virtue and power abound, correct qi abounds, so people suffer little illness and live long. Where false and deceptive writings proliferate, perverse and malign qi abounds, so people suffer many illnesses and do not attain longevity. This is Heaven’s natural principle.\n\nThus, the ministers of the Three Sovereigns of antiquity abounded in the true Dao, and so their lords lived long. The ministers of the Five Emperors had less of the true Dao, and so their lords did not match the longevity of the Three Sovereigns. The ministers of the Three Kings had even less of the true Dao and could not equal the Five Emperors. The ministers of the Five Hegemons, at their best, wrought false and deceptive calamities, possessing not a single thread of the true Dao, and so many died prematurely. This is a manifest consequence. Those who occasionally attained longevity were merely the longest-lived in the world. Do you deeply understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old needed only to observe the auspicious and inauspicious omens they received to know for themselves their safety or peril, fortune or misfortune. Those who received the highest auspicious omens had already attained the most supreme governance. Those who received middling omens resembled middling people. Those who received the lowest omens resembled the lowest people. What does this mean?\n\nIt means that if one receives omens like those of the Three Sovereigns, one is of the highest rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Emperors, one is of the middle rank. If one receives omens like those of the Three Kings, one is of the great middle-lower rank. If one receives omens like those of the Five Hegemons, one is of the lowest rank. How can this be made manifest through such omens?\n\nExcellent, your words are well said!",

      "translated_text": "Those who govern without punishment and achieve self-regulation are of the highest rank. Those who issue decrees and are slightly feared by the people are of the middle rank. Those who rely on minor punishments to maintain order are of the great middle-lower rank. Those who govern with excessive deceptive policies, treating falsehood as truth, abandoning proper methods, indulging in superficial embellishments and empty documents, ruling with harsh punishments, proliferating corrupt practices, and lacking any true Dao to uphold—these are the effects of the lowest hegemonic way.\n\nIn ancient times, the sagely and wise could observe the celestial decrees they received and thereby know their own superiority or inferiority. To whom should the teachings be entrusted? If one is destined to produce worthy successors to assist in governance, it is like a family on the rise, which must bear virtuous children. Or if the Yellow River and Luo River yield prophetic texts and charts as proof, this is the sign.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nLet me further clarify for you, Perfected One. When a family is in decline, it bears wicked and malevolent children. When a ruler is in decline, Heaven does not grant him worthy and virtuous assistants. When a family is in decline, its descendants do not pursue true virtue and the Dao; instead, they favor flattery, deceit, superficiality, and corrupt, licentious practices—thus bringing misfortune and chaos upon the household. When a family is flourishing, it must seek true virtue, the Dao, extraordinary texts, and exceptional methods to save itself. When a noble ruler is rising, Heaven bestows upon him true texts, the true Dao, and true virtue, and good people join him in governance. The Yellow River and Luo River may still occasionally issue decrees, disasters diminish day by day, auspicious omens appear daily, and good responses grow ever more numerous—these are the effects.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Go forth, Perfected One, and strive with all your might. You shall render great service to Heaven and assist the virtuous ruler in becoming wise and enlightened.\n\nWhat does this mean? To render great service to Heaven, you are now one who has departed from the world of mortals. If you cannot be praised for your governance, how can you render service to Heaven? What should be done now? Simply entrust these texts to the Virtuous Ruler. The Virtuous Ruler is the Son of Heaven, aligned with the will of Heaven. He shall use this governance to repay Heaven’s great favor, pacify the world, and elevate himself—thus, you too shall attain good fortune and preserve your longevity.\n\nExcellent, indeed, indeed. Go forth; the discourse on the three ways of conduct is now complete. Let this be shown to all worthy and ordinary people, so that later generations who seek to do good may follow this path. Do not dare to act solely for personal gain, claiming to be virtuous while placing Heaven, the ruler, parents, and teachers above all else.\n\nThe conduct of people as described by the Perfected One may still be balanced and moderate, but those of the lowest and most foolish nature, who accumulate evil dispositions and deeds, are beyond enumeration. Entrust these texts to the people of later ages, so that each may deeply examine and practice them. How can one’s conduct benefit Heaven, the ruler, parents, and teachers? If one’s actions merely increase for the sake of self-preservation and personal gain—does Heaven not deeply perceive the hearts and minds of people? This is why so many suffer.\n\nExcellent! This foolish one has beheld the words of the Heavenly Mind and the Master and has greatly awakened. You may be called one who is easily enlightened. In this world, there are many of the lowest and most foolish people who trust only their own ignorant hearts and no longer believe the words of others. Their errors lie in undermining the Dao of Heaven, causing emperors and kings to suffer distress. This arises precisely from such foolish scholars, who are envious of the true Dao and virtue, disparaging the worthy while trusting their own unbenevolent hearts. Heaven finds this affliction grievous, and thus has sent forth these texts for the ruler of supreme virtue, so that he may attain them, secure his person, and bring peace to his governance. Those who gain Heaven’s favor—the rulers of the remote antiquity of the Highest Sovereign—were precisely those who explored and received Heaven’s profound blessings in this way.\n\nDoes the Perfected One understand? Indeed, indeed.",

Thus, I dare not refrain from asking in full.\"\n\n\"Excellent, your words are immutable for ten thousand generations!\nThe Dao of Heaven is most profound, its virtue abundant, its benevolence overflowing—now the time has come. The August Spirit delights in humanity’s swift action, and so Heaven’s *qi* stirs your heart, urging you to question day and night. Heaven’s law is precise; I marvel at it.\n*Understood.*\"\n\n\"Perfected One, be seated. I shall fully explain the meaning of these characters so they may be transmitted without end.\nNow, the character *Upper* (上) is a single stroke. In its center, another vertical stroke is added, and above, it embraces one stroke after another, ascending to three in total. It moves upward without cease, never descending again. Thus, it is called *Upper*—for its form has nothing above it.\nReversed, it becomes *Lower* (下): a single stroke, with another vertical stroke in its center, then embracing one stroke as it descends. Its movement goes downward without return, so it is called *Lower*.\nThose whose will constantly tends downward will, over time, sink to the lowest point, with nowhere further to descend. This is like the turbid, which delights in descending to become Earth—thus Earth is the lowest, with nothing below it.\nThe character *Upper* always moves upward, never descending again. This is like the pure, which delights in ascending to become Heaven—thus Heaven has nothing above it.\nTherefore, in Heaven’s law, each name is defined by its own form, and all things under Heaven follow this principle. Thus, the sages established laws in accord with Heaven’s intent.\nTo guard the One and delight in ascending while divining (卜, *to inquire*)—divination is questioning. To constantly delight in ascending and inquire without cease is most auspicious, the highest path. Thus, the character *Upper* is a single stroke ascending while divining.\nThe character *Lower* descends with a single stroke while divining—divination is questioning. To constantly ponder and inquire while descending leads to the lowest extreme, with nowhere further to descend. Thus, those who delight in descending gain nothing more, nor can they ascend again.\nTherefore, *Upper* has no character above it, signifying that governance should daily ascend, aligning with Heaven’s heart, with nothing above it.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Enlightened Master, I humbly beg you to explain the character *August* (皇). I wish to hear further.\"\n\n\"The character *August* (皇) is formed by *Day* (日) and *King* (王) combined. *Day* above is the One (一), which is Heaven. Heaven’s number is One. When Heaven obtains the sun, it shines brilliantly and becomes kingly. Thus, the character combines One (一) and *Day* (日) with *King* (王) to form *August* (皇).\nOne is Heaven, and Heaven is the sovereign; the sun is also sovereign; the king is also sovereign. Three sovereigns unite to form the character *August*.\n*August* signifies its divine splendor, resplendent and radiant—thus it is called *August*.\nThe August is the first under Heaven, with nothing above it.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Master, I humbly beg you to elucidate the character *August*. Now, I wish to hear of the characters *Tai Ping Qi*.\"\n\n\"*Tai* (太) means *great*—it signifies accumulating great conduct like Heaven. In all matters, it is great, with nothing greater than Heaven.\n*Ping* (平) means *level*—it signifies governance that is perfectly balanced. All matters are ordered, with no partiality or selfishness. *Ping* is like Earth, which dwells below and maintains equilibrium. Earth’s equilibrium is like a person who plants goodness and reaps goodness, plants evil and reaps evil. If one treats others with goodness and diligence, their harvest will be abundant. If one favors goodness but others treat them poorly, their harvest will be meager and their produce inferior.\n*Qi* (氣) signifies Heaven’s *qi*, which delights in descending to generate life, and Earth’s *qi*, which delights in ascending to nurture. The law of *qi* operates between Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang unite, intermingling to form harmony. Together with the *Central Harmonious Qi*, the Three Qi coalesce to nourish all things. The Three Qi love and permeate one another, leaving no harm.\n*Tai* means *great*; *Ping* means *upright*; *Qi* governs nurturing and harmonious permeation. When governance attains this, there is *Tai Ping*—great peace and harmony. Thus, it is said the *Tai Ping Qi* arrives.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! Does this refer solely to the *Central Harmonious Qi* of Heaven and Earth uniting to govern together? Or should all matters follow this Threefold Union?\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!

      "translated_text": "It does not emulate the natural law of Heaven and Earth’s primordial *qi*, nor does it achieve the threefold resonance, joining forces with a single heart—this is how such calamities arise. If the three resonate, joining forces with a single heart, then Great Peace and boundless joy will be established, and disasters will vanish. I wish to hear: how should governance proceed?\n\nHasten to emulate the law of Heaven—this is how one serves above. Heaven’s law dictates that all matters require the three to join forces with a single heart. Thus, Heaven uses the Three Luminaries as its pattern: the Three Luminaries constantly intermingle and illuminate together, never ceasing for even a moment. Since the Heavenly Contract emerged, humans have used writing to govern, modeling it after the Three Luminaries of Heaven. Therefore, Heaven frequently causes the River Chart and Luo Writ to appear, repeatedly activating the written patterns of human culture. It desires to emulate Heaven’s profound and divine method of governance, causing goodness to flourish day by day and evil to perish day by day.\n\nWriting is merely the circulation of documents along the three pathways. The ruler should skillfully guide those below, issuing clear decrees and instructions, teaching the people to each remain in their place and submit memorials, fully recounting what they have heard of good and evil. If they must travel in reverse, they may simply send it by convenient means—even entrusting it to merchant carts for delivery—or they may clearly state their name and address when submitting. If the method is thus, then the good and evil of the world will be fully revealed.\n\nThe ruler channels the *qi* of Heaven downward to communicate; ministers channel the *qi* of Earth upward to communicate; the people channel the harmonious *qi* of the center upward to communicate. The Realized One transmits this text, entrusting it to a ruler of virtue. If he carefully heeds these words, Great Peace and joy will be established, and calamities will be removed—not a fraction will be lost. This text is reverently received from the law of Heaven; it is not mere empty or deceptive speech.\n\nIf Heaven were to execute my disciples, would you know the severity of this punishment? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIf you wish to verify the truth of this text, once obtained, put it into effect and observe it. When it resonates in response with Heaven and Earth, that is the proof of its authenticity. By this great and clear evidence, you may cast aside all doubt.\n\nThe way to govern the state and find joy in aligning with Heaven’s heart lies in nothing more than implementing this method and resonating in response with Heaven—this is the bright contract by which Heaven speaks with humanity. I have only met the Realized One because I constantly delight in aiding virtuous rulers, wishing to repay Heaven’s great merit. Thus, I have spoken these few words.\n\nI know the failure lies here: the obstruction that prevents the circulation of these texts. The ruler must create clear teachings and good decrees. Proclaim that from this day forward, officials and people should each remain in their place and submit memorials with all their strength, fully recounting good and evil to illuminate the governance of the emperor and communicate with the *qi* of Heaven. None may obstruct this—those who do shall be punished for three years. Only those who submit memorials in complete sincerity, without deceitful words, shall be summoned and appointed to office.\n\nHow should their appointment proceed? Each should be questioned about their talents and abilities, and assigned to a position within the scope of their strength. Why must they be assigned only to what their strength can bear? Heaven deals with people according to their abilities; if one is assigned beyond their capacity, it is called wronging them, and this will only bind *qi* and increase disasters. The reason is this: what one cannot achieve, even if one were to rise from the dead, one still could not accomplish.\n\nWhat people desire most is to obtain fine things—gold and jade. Suppose a wise ruler issues a decree: \"Whoever has ability, come forward, and you shall receive all the gold, silver, and rare treasures of the imperial treasury across the land—nothing will surpass what I give to you.\" The person would be overjoyed to obtain them, yet if their strength cannot reach the objects, even if their hands were bound and exhausted, they still could not attain them.\n\nNow, as parents and rulers of the people, when assigning positions to ministers and children, if one does not consider their strengths but instead forces them into roles, it is like killing them. They will be unable to manage their duties, only causing chaos in their offices and bringing sorrow to the people. When offices are in chaos and the people and ministers are distressed, they will look up and cry out to Heaven, voicing their grievances and moving Heaven, thereby increasing disasters and anomalies.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, wishing to align with Heaven’s heart, were exceedingly cautious in appointments, ensuring that all received the people’s favor. Only then could they be said to have matched Heaven’s heart. What does it mean to match Heaven’s heart? When governance is implemented and yields a response—when the people and officials grow daily in goodness, trust, and loyalty—that is the proof. Then, promotions should occur in due time, for these are the people who aid the state in aligning with Heaven’s heart.\n\nSome, however, seek only joy in obtaining office for the sake of reputation, yet their conduct yields no results, does not match Heaven’s heart, and receives no response. The emperor governs by inheriting Heaven’s heart; he must always align with it, for failing to do so is a transgression. If his governance yields no good response, he should step back and reflect on his errors. In this way, Heaven will be pleased, and all under Heaven will be utterly loyal, exerting their full strength. Even those in distant and hidden places will hear of it, and none will conceal their abilities.\n\nThose who urgently submit memorials—human life is of the utmost weight and cannot be delayed for even a moment. If people continue to cry out in grievance, disasters and anomalies will only accumulate. Resolve and report on these matters swiftly. Matters that can be endured should wait until autumn and winter. Why must they wait until autumn and winter? Because autumn is when things reach completion, and winter is when things are fully stored—Heaven’s *qi* is settled then.\n\nThings ripen in the second month of autumn, the eighth month, when their fruits and kernels can be distinguished. Thus, one should follow the law of Heaven and Earth, beginning in the eighth month to examine and distinguish them. The ninth month is the culmination of Heaven’s *qi*, when all things approach death. Therefore, one should thoroughly examine them in the ninth month, observing the balance of good and evil. Ten is the end of numbers, so by the tenth month, things return to their beginning.\n\nHeaven’s standard takes the eighth month as the tenth month, when all things reach completion. Earth’s standard takes the ninth month as the tenth month, when all things grow old. Humanity’s standard takes the *hai* month as the tenth month, when all things die. The three standards are complete, and things are ready to be reborn. Thus, *qian* resides in the northwest, and all things begin their kernels in the *hai* month. Heaven’s law distinguishes them in the eighth month, culminates them in the ninth, and solidifies their kernels in the tenth. Thus, the three standards of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all conclude, their kernels solidified in the *hai* month. Therefore, in the tenth month, the kernels are solidified and handed down for return.\n\nThis is because the eighth, ninth, and tenth months are the three months when the standards of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all reach their end and are ready to return to the beginning.",

      "translated_text": "If the kernels are not solidified, their meaning is not attained—Heaven and Earth will not be pleased, disasters will not be dispelled, and harm will recur in the coming year. Thus, in the eighth month, they are distinguished and observed; in the ninth month, they are brought to completion; in the tenth month, their kernels are solidified and handed down for return. This compels officials and common people alike to reflect anew on their transgressions and dare not repeat them. In the coming year, officials and people will be more vigilant, and all things will be well. If they do not return to reflect on their faults with steadfast resolve, ministers and subjects below will fail in governance and remain unaware of their errors, their hearts unchanged. The Dao of Heaven is unyielding—evil is not easily transformed. Therefore, they must be handed down for return.\n\nFor the Perfected One who wishes to know its efficacy: when what is handed down for return this year is recorded in one copy and kept, and officials and people are also instructed to record one copy for themselves, the measure of good and evil is called the \"Heavenly Bond.\" When the next year’s return is handed down, another copy is made to observe the measure of good and evil. When the following year’s return is handed down, yet another copy is made to observe the measure of good and evil. The records below are compared with those above, and if they correspond, it is called the \"Heavenly Mandate Aligning with the Token.\" This compels officials and people to transform their hearts and act with virtue, gaining Heaven’s favor. If what is submitted above is mostly good, it indicates great transformation and great goodness. If they remain obstinate, unchanged, and unyielding, what is submitted will remain as it was. If evil persists without cease, what is submitted will grow worse. If officials and people greatly deceive and defy Heaven, what is submitted will be vastly more evil and severe. Thus, this is the mirror of Heaven’s all-penetrating illumination of the heart—it does not err by even a fraction, clearly revealing the conduct of officials and people.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like echo and shadow, responding to human actions without fail. Perfected One, if you harbor good intentions, strive to complete them with care. Though you have come to inquire of this, if it were without purpose or benefit, Heaven would silently observe. Your words may speak, but how can they be proven? When a person speaks, if their words are detailed and virtuous, others respond with virtue, and the echo answers with virtue. If their words are ominous and inauspicious, others respond with evil, and the echo answers with evil. All things that correspond and harmonize are made so by Heaven. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nHeaven is lofty, distant, and majestic—how could it descend to address mortals in every matter? Thus, its laws operate through natural resonance and harmony. Has your heart now opened? Indeed, indeed. I understand. I wish to ask the Heavenly Master for one more instruction. Practice the Dao.\n\nIn the middle antiquity, the August Emperor had no written records, yet the three realms communicated—how could order be maintained? Excellent is your question. The movement of Heaven made the people of that time upright and unadorned; they all embraced the Dao and believed with singular devotion. They communicated through simple words, each desiring utmost sincerity and seeking to align with Heaven’s will—none deceived another. Thus, ruler, minister, and people united in strength and purpose, communicating as one, and so they harmonized. If they had not been of one heart and one household, chaos would have ensued.\n\nNow, under the weight of inherited burdens, written documents abound, and deception through texts flourishes. Even the worthy and learned are misled, collectively losing Heaven’s favor. Since Heaven has produced written records, mere words can no longer suffice. One must solidify the kernels and attain their truth—when the three realms communicate, Heaven’s *qi* will be balanced.\n\nThe laws of Heaven vary by the hundreds of millions, differing from age to age. Governance and methods are each distinct. Now, as the *qi* of Great Peace approaches, the fundamental texts must be solidified with correct and original characters to gain Heaven’s favor. If you cannot discern this, consider: since Heaven and Earth established affairs, their governance has taken countless forms. Those who practice their methods and receive Heaven’s response act rightly; those who do not receive Heaven’s response act wrongly. This is the great illumination of the Heavenly Bond’s verification and efficacy. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Perfected One, now the harmonious *qi* of goodness is about to arrive in full. Yet people wander without duties—how should they clarify their minds and rectify their intentions, so that they suddenly forget evil and daily grow fonder of goodness, never setting it aside? Thus may the Emperor sit with folded hands, nothing left to govern, while those of supreme goodness fill his court, and loyal, trustworthy, filial sons are all complete.\n\nHow is this to be achieved?\n\nPerfected One, you possess a Heaven-born nature that delights in goodness and constantly worries over the Dao of Heaven. You should now fully expound it yourself.\n\nSimply study with urgency—through the true Dao, true virtue, and true benevolence.\n\nWhy must one study the true Dao?\n\nThe Dao alone can guide and transform without limit, cherishing life beyond measure. Those who possess the true Dao bear the name of supreme goodness. Those without the Dao bear the most vile, withered, ominous, and transgressive name—death and ruin.\n\nPerfected One, your words on truth are excellent; I have nothing to add.\n\nWhy must one study true virtue?\n\nThose who possess true virtue can embrace and nurture the boundless. Those without virtue bear the name of the most feeble, impoverished, and petty. Excellent indeed are your words, Perfected One; I have nothing to add—truly, truly so.\n\nWhy must one study the Way of benevolence?\n\nThe benevolent can bestow loving-kindness without exclusion, delighting only in giving without end. Those who lack benevolence turn virtue into vice, hoarding and begrudging—bearing the name of the most greedy and base, their aspirations no different from beasts, with nothing to distinguish them.\n\nExcellent are your words, Perfected One; I have nothing to add.\n\nNow you have spoken of these three matters; I have nothing to add.\n\nShould people study to do good, or not?\n\nThey must strive to study goodness.\n\nDoes goodness not have a name and form?\n\nThis disciple is unworthy; may the Master enlighten me.\n\nThose who do good align with the heart of Heaven and do not oppose the will of others—this is called goodness. Goodness is utterly supreme, sharing the same name as the Dao. It is what Heaven loves, Earth nurtures, what emperors must urgently attend to, and what ministers and rulers must unite in purpose and strength to uphold.\n\nEvil opposes the heart of Heaven, constantly harms the will of others, rebels against the Dao of Heaven, and disrupts the four seasons. It is detested by spirits, shunned by people, the greatest harm to parents, the source of sorrow for the noble, and bears the most ominous name in the world—utter ruin.\n\nThus, in human conduct, losing good fortune leads to misfortune, and departing from misfortune leads to good fortune. One moment of good, one moment of evil—such are the ways of the impure and careless. Do you understand, disciple?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nIn your view, Perfected One, how should people conduct themselves?\n\nIf people do not diligently study the Dao, they will have no way to know it and will be called those without the Dao. Those without the Dao are the most wicked and ominous of people.\n\nIf they do not diligently study virtue, they will have no way to know it. Those who lack virtue and delight in harm and injury bear the mark of ruin.\n\nIf people do not diligently study benevolence, they become inhumane. The inhumane walk the same path as beasts; their hearts differ from beasts only slightly more than from the dead.\n\nIf people do not study goodness day and night, losing goodness leads to evil. Evil is the realm of death and misfortune. Thus, if people do not diligently study good fortune, they fall into misfortune—for misfortune bears the most detested name in the world.\n\nExcellent! You have deeply entered the true Dao and will not return to evil.\n\nPerfected One, you have long concealed wisdom and feigned ignorance. Why?\n\nI dared not act.\n\nYou are fortunate to have this ability. Fully express what you have said; I am greatly pleased.\n\nNow that you have reached this point, have you ever seen my words and then abandoned them halfway?\n\nI dare not.\n\nWhen the Master commands me to speak, if my understanding falls short, I dare not express it fully.\n\nExcellent, your words are always deeply humble.\n\nNow fully commit to the gate of truth; may the Heavenly Master instruct what I have not yet grasped.\n\nWhat you have just said is entirely correct.\n\nThus, the great sages of antiquity—the Three Sovereigns—studied the true Dao day and night. Those who did not study the true Dao were called people without the Dao. The conduct of those without the Dao is countless, a great and heavy resentment to Heaven. Those without the Dao are not desired by Heaven to be covered, nor by Earth to be borne. Spirits, gods, and ghosts do not wish to protect them; the world suffers because of them.\n\nThe noble, the worthy, and the gentlemen deeply detest those without the Dao.\n\nThus, in the time of the Upper Sovereign, people all studied purity and tranquility, deeply understanding the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth. Only after studying the true Dao did they gain the hearts of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThose who do not diligently study virtue are called people without virtue. Those without virtue are not loved by Heaven, not favored by Earth, and not desired by others to be near. Their conduct constantly fails to embody virtue, bringing harm to rulers and disaster to gentlemen. Ghosts and spirits, following Heaven’s decree, will not long govern with them.\n\nThus, the ancient worthy sages and great scholars, upon seeing those without virtue, would not even speak with them.\n\nIf one does not diligently study benevolence day and night, they will neglect affairs and become inhumane. The inhumane speak against all things, wound the hearts of others, and do not align with the will of Heaven. They resemble beasts, so the ancient sages and worthies would not walk the same path as them.\n\nIf people do not serve a teacher and diligently study goodness, they become foolish and ignorant, not knowing how to do good. Instead, they indulge their unknowing hearts and lightly commit evil.\n\nThe evil, the foolish, and the benighted act against the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Even if they serve as gentlemen, they bring shame to their parents, sorrow to their clans, and act lawlessly. Ghosts and spirits, following the heart of Heaven, are displeased and bring threefold harm to their place—such are those the law must punish.",

      "translated_text": "The ancients and sages regarded this as a great grievance, so they thoroughly examined and verified their learning, aligning it with the heart of Heaven. Their affairs were rooted in the Dao, virtue, benevolence, and goodness alone. Their conduct had to accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth, never relying on frivolous or ornate words. The reason for this was that to lose the celestial law was to invite misfortune, premature death, or even harm to later generations. The Dao of Heaven is never mistaken; it has its standards and measures.\n\nThose who do not diligently study the greatly auspicious Dao but instead treat matters with carelessness and ease will surely fall into misfortune. Misfortune is detested by Heaven and Earth, by all people, and by the myriad things. It cannot endure long, for it is the root of great calamity, the gateway to disaster. Once one falls into it, death follows, and there is no return, no chance to repent or revert to the past. Though all under Heaven know this, the lesser scholars and the greatly foolish often mock the Dao, failing to guard it or early avoid harm. They pass down their folly, burdening one another, and each generation grows more benighted than the last. Thus, the true Dao becomes obstructed and impassable, leading people to treat it lightly and fail to fulfill their natural lifespans. The great fault and error arise from this.\n\nThose who encounter my writings should ponder them deeply. Take care not to conceal them but instead entrust them to the wise, the gentle, and the discerning, so that they may awaken. The ancient Dao, therefore, follows the heart of Heaven and accords with the will of Earth. There existed in high antiquity the great true Dao and its laws, which constantly taught people to study the Dao, cultivate virtue, seek longevity, embrace goodness, practice caution, pursue auspiciousness, emulate the ancients, and strive for peace and immortality.\n\nThe reason for exhaustively expounding goodness is that the law of Heaven always opens the gate of the Dao, and the law of Earth always opens the door of virtue. The laws of the ancient sages and worthies always opened the path of benevolence. Thus, the ancients and sages, sharing the heart of Heaven and aligning with the will of Earth, jointly nurtured the twelve thousand things, perpetually transmitting them through the intent of the Dao, virtue, and benevolence. Where such transmission thrives, the myriad things flourish. But if transmitted with malicious or evil intent, all things daily decline and diminish.\n\nWhere the Dao, virtue, and benevolence reside, people multiply and incline toward goodness. Where they are absent, people dwindle, and governance grows impoverished and bitter. This is the unchanging law of Heaven and Earth. Those who possess the utmost Dao, luminous virtue, and a heart of benevolence and goodness ascend to correspond with the celestial stars and calendars, their conduct illuminated by spirits and deities.\n\nThus, the ancients and sages constantly reflected on doing boundless good, exhausting their efforts so as not to dare harbor evil thoughts or tread the path of misfortune. The benighted, however, have hearts that are blocked and ignorant, incapable of further delusion. They are led astray onto the evil path of decline and misfortune, unaware of their great deviation from the Dao of Heaven. They follow one another in wrongdoing, making it their custom, unable to retreat or return.\n\nTherefore, I reverently received the celestial scriptures and teachings, complying with the heart of Heaven to open and expand the great path of high antiquity and Great Peace. This enables people to delight in goodness and no longer know the ways of evil. Yet the people of the world set their aspirations high, but their achievements often fall short, failing to match their original intentions.\n\nThus, the superior person, indignant at death and delighting in life, studies immortality and, through diligence, attains longevity. Such a person is the foremost of the determined. The middling person, also resolute, is grieved by the early deaths of their ancestors and, indignant, seeks the Dao to study longevity, striving to fulfill their natural lifespan. This is the foremost of the steadfast. Others, afflicted by frequent illness and unable to maintain even a modest state of well-being, study diligently to halt their suffering. If they can restore their former health, their illness was but a minor trial. If they study only when already gravely ill, seeking arts to save themselves, it is already too late—they are as good as dead.\n\nTherefore, my writings teach people the celestial methods of longevity, urging them to exert themselves day and night. Only then can they attain even a modest state of well-being. If one of modest attainment studies the ways of ordinary people, they have already entered misfortune. The foolish do not understand that the original aspirations of ordinary people under Heaven are to think highly of those better than themselves, yet they cannot fulfill their own aspirations. Thus, to elevate them highly, reaching the pinnacle of immortality, is merely to preserve their natural lifespan.\n\nThe greatly worthy set their minds on ten and achieve all ten, perfectly aligning with my writings on the Dao. The middling worthy set their minds on ten but may falter or grow lax, achieving only five. The petty person resolves in the morning but forgets by evening. Therefore, those who elevate greatly delight in enabling the superior, middling, and inferior to each attain their heart’s aspirations.\n\nNow, the people of the later ages are greatly foolish, far removed from the true Dao. If they study with the celestial standard of upright texts and methods, they merely avoid falling into deceit. If they study with texts of modest attainment, they are already greatly deceived. If they study with ornate words and fine speech, great falsehood and cunning arise.\n\nHeaven regards the emperor as its child and detests those below deceiving those above. When people below are full of deceit and perversity, the virtuous and benevolent ruler above has no one to trust, and the common people have nowhere to entrust their lives. To teach diligently day and night with the true Dao is merely to attain a modest Dao. To study with the modest Dao is already to enter frivolity. Entering frivolity, ordinary people become greatly deluded and impoverished, falling onto the path of great misfortune. The emperor is distressed, and the people cannot be governed.\n\nIf the true person wishes to know the truth of this, consider a family with loving parents who daily teach their children to do good. Though they endure hardship, denying themselves clothing and food to care for their elders, the children may still stubbornly persist in evil. How much more so for ordinary people, who are taught with frivolous and ornate texts? If they do not believe my writings, let those who encounter them reflect on their own failings.\n\nSince the middle antiquity, those who possessed the good Dao have taught one another to conceal and withhold it, refusing to transmit it to their disciples. Instead, they taught them with frivolous and false texts. Over time, this accumulation has led to the present great disorder in the Dao of Heaven.",

True persons ought to treat this with utmost gravity, for there are the bonds of Heaven. \"Indeed, indeed, we dare not be careless.\" Whenever I hear the words of the Heavenly Master, I tremble with awe. \"Your words are true, and Heaven will rejoice greatly, sparing you from harm.\" \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThough ordinary people exert themselves day and night to study and cultivate true virtue, they may only attain mediocre virtue.

Acting recklessly, without principle, they incur the resentment of Heaven and the blame of Earth, becoming the greatest scourge of humanity.\n\nThose who exert themselves day and night to study the Way of great fortune may only attain middling fortune; to study middling fortune is to attain but minor fortune; to study minor fortune is already to enter the path of misfortune. To study the path of misfortune is beyond salvation—they plunge into utter darkness, knowing nothing. They dismiss the words of the Heavenly Dao as false, deceiving the purely faithful with reckless lies. Their foolish hearts speak madness, offending the patterns of Heaven above and disrupting the order of Earth below, bringing harm and disaster to the people.\n\nTherefore, when I teach the Dao through these writings, even ordinary people may study them diligently, aspiring to join the ranks of the true immortals. If they cannot attain the level of true immortals, they may still live in peace, sparing the virtuous ruler from worry. True persons ought to ponder my words deeply and not dismiss them as strange. \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nNow, as I speak on behalf of Heaven, I must fully expound the responsibility of *chengfu*—the karmic burden inherited since the opening of Heaven and Earth. Yet I cannot fully unfold the great methods of the supreme Dao and virtue, the arts of longevity, and the path of supreme goodness. People, lost in darkness, have long trusted their foolish and benighted hearts, turning to evil without restraint, unable even to comprehend the *chengfu*—the retribution and transgressions borne by Heaven and Earth.

The middling scholar, with half-comprehending intent, will grasp half of it; the lesser scholar, through diligent effort, can avoid losing the method—thus does Heaven broadly raise its people. Common folk who delight in both high and low, without losing the method at the center, all attain the true Dao. Each cherishes themselves, daring not to treat matters lightly, sparing themselves great sorrow.\n\nThe superior scholar, having attained my Dao and studying it without cease, may become a worthy minister to the state. Over time, grasping its essential meaning, they can transcend the world, no longer engaging in disputes or lawsuits, viewing matters with discernment. The middling scholar, studying my Dao, may become a virtuous minor official and fulfill their natural lifespan. The petty person, studying my Dao, may cultivate lasting prudence: fathers are kind, mothers loving, children filial; elder brothers virtuous, younger brothers obedient; husbands and wives consult as one, never harming each other. Even unto death, no resentment lingers. Their souls, dwelling below, endure long, no longer seen to act wrongly or be called wicked. None die prematurely or suffer violent ends.\n\nIn ancient times, when the primordial qi first gave birth to Heaven, people all delighted in studying to become immortals, yet still could not attain longevity—only ensuring they each feared death and avoided criminal laws. But the people of later ages, profoundly foolish, instead recite florid and insubstantial teachings, studying arts that do not prolong life. In life, they act recklessly, claiming as if they will never die, teaching each other to hold nothing dear, jointly pursuing inauspicious affairs, treating funerals with greater care than births.\n\nLife belongs to Heaven; death belongs to Earth. To serve Earth by reversing Heaven’s order is a grave harm. I have observed this and know that their accumulated folly has endured so long that none remain wise. When inauspicious affairs arise, ghosts flourish, collectively hastening human deaths, preventing people from fulfilling their natural lifespans.\n\nThose who strive to study the true Dao may only attain a false one; those who strive to study true virtue may only attain a false virtue. How much worse, then, for the people of later ages who teach each other with florid texts—how far they have strayed from the Dao! Impoverished and unable to restrain one another, they instead teach the crafting of memorials and legal statutes, debating cleverly over right and wrong.\n\nTo teach them to be benevolent is already to fear they will not be so—yet now they are taught to study the path of malevolence. Heaven provides laws for humanity, naming itself the Great Dao; Earth names itself virtue. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. In all matters, rulers and elders constantly guide with goodness, never daring to open the way to teach malevolence—how much less should humans do so?\n\nHumans are the children of Heaven and ought to model their conduct after it. Yet now, having lost the method, people are difficult to govern. To instruct them in the Dao and virtue is to make them wise, self-respecting, self-cherishing, self-loving, and self-governing. Instead, they are opened to criminal laws, causing them to view death as fleeting, valuing brute strength and recklessness, passing down governance that entangles and oppresses them, leading to mutual harm and cycles of suffering.

      "translated_text": "The forceful teaching of benevolence still struggles to overcome its absence; in later ages, people instead instruct one another in written arts, yet this has only grown more superficial, and their mutual hatred and resentment remain unbroken. The forceful teaching of auspiciousness still struggles to overcome inauspiciousness; in later ages, people instead compel one another to study the implements of death and mourning, preparing for misfortune in advance. They die before their time, nearly extinguishing their households, yet remain unaware of their errors. When the moment comes, they cry out to Heaven and wail to Earth, calling themselves wronged, blaming the ruler’s unjust governance for cutting short their years, while their own conduct has brought this upon them. Fools do not guard against the root; once guilt is determined, they regret, but regret is futile. Though they scream until death, it cannot be undone.\n\nThus, I now forcefully teach the great immortal scriptures of the Dao, merely opening the steps to longevity. When one studies virtue, only then can they attain benevolence; when one studies benevolence, only then can they attain tranquility and preserve what they have, no longer daring to deceive or seize others’ possessions. When one studies tranquility, they have already lost the method. When one studies the method, they have already lost the way of mutual harm. When one studies mutual harm, they have already entered great conflict. Once in great conflict, the people, though innocent, are deceived, and the destitute become thieves and bandits.\n\nTherefore, I uphold the Heavenly Dao’s method, opening the gate of great fortune and closing the path of malevolence. I open the steps to Heaven’s Great Peace, so that all may recite it, each exercising caution, leaving nothing to be governed. Thus, the turning of Heaven’s seasons proceeds, and the joyous ruler wanders without trouble. For this reason, my writings thoroughly examine the root of all matters; only then can their center be attained. Examining the center, one attains what lies below, but those who study like fools have already fallen into great chaos.\n\nThe reason why, in later ages, even emperors and kings with the virtue, benevolence, and wisdom of ten thousand people—though they strive to align with Heaven’s will—cannot end misfortune is that they bear the accumulated disasters and chaos of long-standing inherited burdens. Though they grieve and torment themselves, desiring joy, their governance breeds strange transformations: thieves and bandits of all kinds, barbarians invading the Central Kingdom—these are the failures of former kings, not the fault of one alone. One must deeply understand their root.\n\nThus, Heaven has sent forth my writings to absolve emperors and kings of the errors of inherited burdens. If true persons do not align my Dao with Heaven, they need only follow my texts without deviating by a hair’s breadth, and alignment will be established. My writings are greatly trustworthy; without diligent practice to untie the knots of grievance, how can the Heavenly Dao respond in silence?\n\nIf the foolish do not study, how can they become worthy? If the poor do not till, how can they reap? Study, and one becomes worthy day by day; till, and one reaps day by day. Practice my writings, and it will be the same. I assure you: without study, do not seek worthiness; without tilling, do not seek harvest. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe true Dao is upright; great virtue flourishes with benevolence, and each attains their proper place. In governance and peace, nothing is lost. Do true persons understand? Those who wish to repay Heaven and Earth’s grace and attain longevity must strive to trust the Dao without slackening. Indeed, indeed.\n\nNow, if the foolish wish to ask further, they dare not speak hastily. Proceed calmly.\n\nHow does the Heavenly Master know when a person utterly lacks virtue, benevolence, and humanity?\n\nExcellent is your question. Observe their conduct and words. I wish to hear it.\n\nThus: when one sees a Daoist and reacts with anger, rejecting them, one knows them as a person utterly devoid of the Dao. When one sees virtue and reviles it, one knows them as a person utterly devoid of virtue. When one sees benevolence and rejects it, one knows them as a person utterly lacking in benevolence. When one sees goodness and caution and rejects them, one knows them as a person who is neither good nor cautious.\n\nBy nature, those of like minds love one another, while those of differing minds hate one another. Good people also suffer from the wicked, and the wicked also suffer from the good. Do true persons understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIn ancient times, sages and worthies, upon seeing someone, did not immediately speak with them. They simply observed carefully, noting their likes and dislikes, and thus knew them.

The earth shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as virtue; when evil persons inflict harm, to oppose the earth is to invite great calamity. Benevolence shares the same bone-structure, laws, and bloodline as sages and worthies; thus, sages and worthies delight in bestowing benevolence and detest seizing by force, and to oppose the benevolent and sagely is to make them one’s mortal foe.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old deeply understood that these were the three norms upheld by the Three Powers. Thus, in establishing their laws, they dared not deviate from the true Dao, virtue, or benevolence. Heaven’s workings join forces with the four seasons: as Heaven moves qi, so too do the four seasons move qi, acting in unison with one heart. Thus, to go against the four seasons is to incur Heaven’s enmity. The earth joins hearts and forces with the Five Phases, together nurturing all things; when beings are harmed before their allotted time of death, this invites great calamity from the earth. Sages and worthies join hearts and forces with benevolence; thus, in their travels and dwellings, they ever honor the Dao and esteem virtue, relying on benevolence in their conduct. If one delights in seizing by force and lacks benevolence, this makes one an enemy of the sagely and worthy.\n\nFire is the heart, and the heart is sagely. Thus, fire ever dwells leaning upon wood. Wood is benevolent and possesses a heart; fire possesses light and can discern right and wrong. The heart is sagely and luminous. Therefore, the great sages and worthies of old ever dwelled leaning upon benevolence and clarity, returning to rulers of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity.\n\nThus, I earnestly admonish the true person, entrusting this book to rulers of Dao, virtue, benevolence, and luminosity. They must delight in and cherish my Dao, deeply comprehend its meaning, follow and emulate it, and become indistinguishable from the divine. I do not praise myself to the true person; only when practice yields response, perfectly aligning like compass and square, will later generations heed my words.

Though the questions posed above and below are many, how could they be heard repeatedly?\n\nExcellent indeed! Profound are your questions, how penetrating and insightful! You have asked precisely at this crucial juncture—do you wish to advance toward the Perfect Dao and dispel the deviant texts?\n\nYes.\n\nNow I shall explain all. You have accumulated goodness in Heaven; how could I dare conceal it? Today, out of deep regard for your virtue, I shall exhaust the intentions of the divine and luminous. If I do not speak and act, I fear I would contravene the will of Heaven. Since Heaven has indeed prompted you to seek and inquire, I shall distinguish and expound for you. Follow along and record it; take care not to omit anything.\n\nIf the emperor and kings exert themselves to employ this scripture, all calamities will be eradicated in a single day. The world will rejoice as one, all desiring to become scholars of Dao and virtue. Later generations will emulate their forebears, the old and young rising together, all coming to know and seek the verification of true texts. Superficial embellishments will vanish, and the heart will thoroughly harmonize with the divine and numinous. The ruler will have no single worry—why should he not daily wander in joy?\n\nThus, all matters under Heaven and Earth will find their proper place, the hundred spirits rejoicing in consequence. The king will deeply align with the will of Heaven, and the Perfect Dao will come to his aid. There will be daily auspiciousness, not a single inauspicious event. My words are true and steadfast, not erring even once in ten thousand instances. Yet I fear that though obtained, they may not be practiced, for the multitude of deviant influences may obstruct them.\n\nCalamities and anomalies, superficial embellishments—these are the grave maladies of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. If a grave malady is left untreated, how can it be resolved and cured? Since you have come to inquire about these matters, I speak for Heaven. Ponder carefully the words above and below in this scripture. Should you chance upon its profound intent, take care not to disorder it.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nOnce you return to a fitting place, day and night reflect upon it. Having received and recorded it, repeatedly elucidate and annotate it, hoping that it may endure for ten thousand generations without end.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, speech, writing, and texts have followed one another in succession. Matters of the same qi illuminate one another by kind. Seek their kind and gather them, and the Dao will daily become more manifest, never declining.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, the multitude of sages have together discoursed for Heaven, and the multitude of worthies have harmonized their words, jointly devising sagely plans. The emperor and kings are Heaven’s noble children. As children inheriting their father’s teachings, they ought to follow and enact them, thereby dispelling the worries of Heaven and Earth and receiving their protection.\n\nTherefore, reflect upon and exert yourselves in these words.\n\nMy Dao—ah! When you perceive matters, whether awakened or not, Heaven and Earth, the divine and luminous, will require the seeking of countless, myriad, thousandfold, hundredfold, tenfold, and single matters, all of which must correspond before they may be deemed reliable. If they do not correspond, urgently seek again. Among their kindred and comparable instances, if even one does not correspond, that is the truth.\n\nAll matters should be thus. How can one ascertain their correspondence? Correspondence is when, upon inward reflection in the heart, there is outward resonance with the spirits and deities, near and far moving in accord. When divining matters and verifying them below, that which responds is true. That which does not correspond—all such explanations are false.\n\nTake care not to speak recklessly, lest you leave no legacy for later generations. The reason is this: reckless speech and false words leave no legacy and cannot be employed for long, thus depriving people of posterity.\n\nAs the governance of the Dao daily declines, perverse and contrary words proliferate—these are truly not so. All such words disrupt the celestial patterns and terrestrial principles, failing to align with the hearts of sages. The spirits cannot be employed thus.\n\nTherefore, one who speaks ought first to reflect inwardly upon human sentiments, and only then should the heart harmonize outwardly, thoroughly aligning with the spirits and deities. This is the means by which to grasp success and failure, the admonitions of celestial patterns.\n\nAccumulate texts and arrange them by kind, assembling the multitude of worthies to compile them. Select from among them those that correspond tenfold, aligning with the hearts of people and the spirits, to form the text. Together, settle upon its meaning, and test it by verifying below. Only thus will it be unalterable for ten thousand generations.\n\nVerification means that when divining matters, there is a response, and when enacting them, the response is realized. Only then can it be established as a canonical method of Heaven, the very means by which to regulate and stabilize yin and yang, the great art of pacifying the king.\n\nThis is how to transform misfortune into blessing, prolonging the lives of the people. Why is this so? When the celestial patterns and terrestrial principles are correct, yin and yang each find their proper place. When yin and yang each find their proper place, the spirits and deities rejoice greatly. When the spirits and deities rejoice, they protect the people. Thus, the emperor and kings enjoy long-lasting peace, and the people live long.\n\nCan one not exert oneself diligently in this?\n\nThe Flying Luminance refers to the lesser of the Three Luminaries, all connected to the earth below and suspended above in the heavens. Their movements harmonize with the people, creatures, and all things of the earth—this is the proof of essential texts. When the written texts divining matters correspond a hundredfold, tenfold, and tenfold again, that is the truth. That which does not correspond and harmonize is false.\n\nBy this standard, measure and balance them. All deviant texts and writings will be entirely eradicated. Examine past events to verify present ones. Follow what Heaven permits, observe what Heaven may favor—do not disrupt the celestial patterns. Joining forces with Heaven, this may be called perpetual auspiciousness.\n\nHeaven can only be followed, not opposed. Seize upon what may be advantageous and employ it, and the people will flourish. To oppose it is to cause the people to decline, losing the will and intent of Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**The Sixty-Eighth Scripture: Verifying Correspondences in Relocation and Movement**\n\nAll texts concerning relocation and movement are the celestial scriptures of Heaven’s course. When yin and yang intersect and unite, the celestial patterns are complete. The emperor, the people, and the myriad things all proceed according to their principles. Those who grasp their intent are auspicious; those who lose it are wholly inauspicious.\n\nMatters have their reversals and sequences—one cannot but be cautious and deliberate in examining them. To ascertain their truth, test them with twenty-five instances of fivefold matters. Select twenty-five past events and twenty-five households of current affairs. Carefully record the year, day, month, and hour from which they originate, and to which of the five tones they belong. Divining auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, verify that which corresponds a hundredfold, tenfold, and tenfold again—that is the truth.",

      "translated_text": "When this is examined and the principles of Heaven and Earth are securely established, the ruler acts without doubt. The people and ministers do not lose their proper roles, and the myriad things each attain their rightful place. If matters do not conform to what this text declares, they are the writings of chaos and deceit and must not be employed.\n\nMeasured by the standard of ascent, those who dare use texts that mislead others will leave no descendants in later generations. The reason is this: such texts harm the people and disrupt the proper divisions of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth govern life, yet men invert their yin and yang, thus causing those who use such texts to be without posterity. In ancient times, before such writings existed, Heaven reversed their course. After the *Celestial Patterns* emerged, all understood the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Those who knowingly violated it met with early death and misfortune—this is the very proof.\n\nWhen applied with harmonious resonance among kin, the Five Peaks and ten thousand *li* respond in kind. Through concentrated and meticulous contemplation, matters of goodness summon good responses, and matters of baseness summon base ones. Their quantity and rank, high or low, never err by even one part in ten thousand. Regularly tested with the twenty-five *qi* of fivefold cycles, they correspond to twenty-five households and twenty-five hills. When the text’s hundredfold and tenfold correspondences align, it is the *earthly prognostication*. When their *qi* combine, they are as kin to the land. Their people share the same likes and dislikes. Moreover, creatures of all kinds—birds, beasts, grasses, and trees—form categories of their own. This is the land of shared *qi*. By this clear distinction, the earth’s correspondences are verified. Where there are no aquatic *qi* among kin, their fish and turtles form their own kind. Using this as the basis for divination, and distinguishing their origins, the nature of all things and all affairs can be known. Those with identical images share identical forms; those with differing images have differing forms—right and wrong are determined precisely thus.\n\n**Vermilion Radiance for Warding Off Evil, Method Sixty-Nine**\n*Vermilion Radiance* refers to the celestial inscribed texts, which can rectify wrongs and ward off evil. When tenfold correspondences bring healing, it is because the celestial writings align with the true spirit-officials—this is the proof of their efficacy. When nineteen correspondences bring healing, it is because the earthly writings harmonize with the yin spirits. When eighteen correspondences bring healing, it is the harmony of human writings. Tested by this standard, all other texts are deceptive and must not be used. These are the writings that invite evil. Only those that align with the spirits are valid; those that fail to heal mislead people and cannot save lives.\n\nSome texts, though authored by spirits or gods, bring healing in ways that cannot be known. Such a person’s fate and allotted years become the chief of evil, and others cannot use their writings. Should such texts proliferate through mass carving, are they not deceptive? They should be carved and then cast into uninhabited wilderness. These texts must be sought one by one and cannot be obtained hastily.\n\n**Methods of Herbs and Trees, Method Seventy**\nHerbs and trees possess virtue and the Dao, and those with official ranks can be commanded—these are called *herbal methods*, referring to the divine herbs and trees. Those that heal swiftly are the divine herbs of Heaven, though they grow upon the earth. Those that extend life are the immortal herbs of Heaven, though they grow upon the earth. Those that heal decisively are called *decisive healing methods*. Those that heal in a single day are called *one-day healing methods*, and their hundredfold and tenfold correspondences confirm their efficacy.\n\nThese herbs and trees possess spirit and can be commanded, for they are herbs and trees with official ranks. Those with tenfold correspondences that heal are the herbs of emperors; those with nineteen correspondences are the herbs of great ministers; those with eighteen correspondences are the herbs of the people. Those below this standard must not be used, for they are herbs that mislead. This is the art of saving life and death—it must not be examined carelessly.\n\nWhen a method combines herbs and brings swift healing, record the herbs and call it a *decisive healing method*. If it heals in one day, call it a *one-day healing method*; if in two days, a *two-day method*; if in three days, a *three-day method*. The *one-day healing method* is administered by celestial spirits; the *two-day healing method* by earthly spirits; the *three-day healing method* by human ghosts. Those that do not conform to this are not celestial spirit methods but rely solely on the herbs’ natural properties, sometimes healing and sometimes not—these are called *waiting-for-death methods*. Be cautious, be exceedingly cautious. This is the art of saving lives and must not be treated lightly or without thorough examination.\n\n**Methods of Living Creatures, Method Seventy-One**\nLiving creatures that act with essence—such as flying birds, walking beasts, and crawling things—can heal illnesses. Birds carry the divine medicines of Heaven within them, sent by Heaven to move in circular and square patterns. Those that heal with tenfold correspondences contain the celestial spirit methods within them; those that heal with nineteen correspondences contain the earthly essence methods; those that heal with eighteen correspondences contain the balanced human essence and divine medicines.\n\nThese three are the methods of Heaven, Earth, and the harmony of yin and yang, called the *healing envoys*. They are like a person of the Dao who is called an envoy—a divine person, a divine master. These are sent by the essences of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, and when their tenfold and hundredfold correspondences bring healing, they are the divine methods of emperors and supreme sovereigns. Those that heal with nineteen correspondences are the divine methods of kings and marquises; those that heal with eighteen correspondences are the divine methods of great ministers, commoners, and reclusive scholars of utmost virtue.\n\nEach has its appointed emergence. Observed thus, not one in ten thousand errs. These three kinds act as divine medicines of Heaven, Earth, and humanity to heal illnesses. Heaven commands each to receive the mandate of their ancestors and embody their natural arts, which they cannot abandon. This is like the phoenix and qilin, which bear virtue upon their bodies; or like bees and scorpions, which bear poison upon theirs—this is what is meant.\n\nOne must deeply understand the essential intent of the Dao of Heaven to clarify the nature of the celestial Dao, which benefits the ruler’s governance and prevents people from being deluded. Without knowing these essential texts, to claim that all writings under Heaven can be used is mistaken.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those scoring seventeen or below are all deviant, failing to correspond with the three auspicious signs, and their harm runs deep. Therefore, those who err in one out of ten treatments do not align with the intent of Heaven; those who err in two out of ten do not align with the intent of Earth; those who err in three out of ten do not align with the intent of humanity. Those who err in six or seven out of ten or more bring about chaotic governance. Yin and yang grow discordant, and spirits engage in strife.\n\nFor this reason, the sage kings and divine rulers of antiquity, though dwelling in secluded chambers, deeply pondered the intent of Heaven’s heart to preserve themselves and attain long life. My writings, with their interconnected phrases above and below, are arranged as texts. When the wise and enlightened read them to complement one another, this rescues the lost and confused, allowing people to enjoy enduring fortune while avoiding misfortune. Each should reflect morning and evening on these essential meanings to preserve their well-being.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, when the common people sing children’s songs and poems, it is Heaven’s transformations that move them to speak. When divine texts emerge in their time, Heaven transmits their discourse to those of utmost virtue to remedy the world’s errors. The Way of Heaven detests killing and cherishes life; all creatures that creep and move possess awareness. None should be lightly killed or harmed without cause. If transformation can be achieved through means other than harm, one must first exhaust those methods before resorting to force.\n\nThus, the myriad things flourish, their lives bound to Heaven, their roots in Earth, and their proper use resting with humanity. Those who align with Heaven’s intent live long, while those who lose it perish. All things exist in constancy with Heaven and Earth, with humanity as their sovereign. Those who rule as sovereigns over humanity must be meticulous and thorough in their deliberations.\n\n**Discarding Florid Ornamentation, Section Seventy-Two**\nTo grasp the essential meaning of all Daoist texts and scriptures, one must take each word as a complete unit. For instance, what is *jiazi*? When placed before a group, let one person explain its fundamental meaning, while the assembled wise collectively debate and expound upon it. Some may specialize in the intent of celestial patterns, expounding upward to thoroughly explore the Way of Heaven. Others may excel in geography, expounding downward to fully investigate the Way of Earth. Still others may focus on external matters, exploring the four directions to their limits. Some may sit and discourse, delving into the center. Others may trace the origins of affairs, excelling in the essence of the myriad things, thereby mastering them. Some may delve into the internal, others into the external. Once the roots, branches, foundations, blossoms, and leaves are all revealed, they are categorized and named by their likenesses.\n\nThe essential intent of all affairs, the writings of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, can thus be glimpsed in outline. With head and feet complete, upper and lower connected, and the natural order of things established, their meanings are harmonized, and each records their discourse. The worthy are gathered to form a unified explanation. Therefore, when the sage seeks the intent of Heaven’s heart to regulate and stabilize yin and yang, bringing peace to the ruler and tranquility to the world, all spirits rejoice in unison.\n\nThus, the radiant insights of the many wise are woven together to establish enduring laws that cannot be altered for ten thousand generations. The reason the intent of Heaven’s Way is lost today lies in this: the words of a single worthy, though penetrating one aspect, cannot illuminate all. They cannot traverse the six directions or thoroughly investigate the seven realms within and without, nor can they trace the essence of the myriad things. Hence, their explanations diverge, causing the original texts of Heaven’s writings to lose their foundation, leading to confusion and delusion—this is the crux of the matter.\n\nFor all matters one wishes to rectify, each has a root that can be exhaustively explored. Yin and yang do not reverse their order; all should proceed thus. Otherwise, it is called an isolated or singular opinion, failing to grasp the scriptures’ intent. Following the words of one person alone is termed a biased view. The nature of Heaven and Earth cannot be fully comprehended by anyone but the sage. Thus, when such a one speaks, internally they cannot fathom the heart of Heaven, and externally they cannot interpret celestial patterns or illuminate geography. Their divinations miss the mark, spirits do not heed them, and they lose the correct path, straying into delusion. This is what is meant by pursuing florid ornamentation, failing to grasp the root and essential intent. The fault lies here, causing the unadorned to lose their foundation.\n\nWhen the Way of Heaven loses its rectitude, yin and yang internally generate illness, discord arises, and harmful qi proliferates. The ruler grows anxious and distressed, unable to restrain their heart, and calamitous qi arises in succession. The people do not live long, and this is the gravest misfortune. When the wise collectively lose the heart of Heaven and drift far from the sage’s teachings, they cannot attain proper order—this is called a chaotic Way.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that all scriptures and records of the Daoist Way are interwoven, forming the discourse of Heaven and Earth. The head and origin of all affairs are the foundation of the spirits. Therefore, those who grasp the original intent prevent spirits from engaging in strife and harming people. Evil qi is sealed away, banditry ceases, and when bandits and thieves are suppressed, the barbarians retreat and submit. Wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons—this is the clear sign of Heaven’s joy. When Heaven is pleased, it cherishes its children. Thus, the ruler’s life is prolonged, and their blessings flow to the people, extending to the six domestic animals, birds, beasts, and even reaching the grasses and trees. Harmonious qi appears in full, evil qi dissipates, and the correct qi grows ever brighter—this is the natural method of yin and yang.\n\nIt is like the day’s affairs being conducted in daylight, while at night they are concealed; when petty men flee, the noble proceed. Reflect upon these words, for they benefit life, clarify yin and yang, and expound upon the spirits. If you doubt my writings, test the Way to discern its success or failure. Now, take a single character and place it before a group, letting the many wise debate and expound upon it. When their interpretations differ and their explanations vary, it becomes clear that the words of one person are not enlightened. How then can they regulate yin and yang and allow the ruler to wander carefree in joy?\n\nThus, those who grasp the root are few, while those who expound are many—there is nothing that cannot be exhausted. When those who grasp the root are many and those who expound are few, the Way becomes superficial and shallow. If this shallowness persists unchecked, chaos ensues. If chaos persists unchecked, yin and yang grow displeased, and evil qi arises.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the sage-kings must honor the root, and the noble person rectify the beginning—then nothing will fail to be ordered. If they do not honor and exalt the root, nor rectify the beginning, then all affairs lose their discipline, the myriad things fall into chaos, and order cannot be restored. Refine and clarify this, and delusion, the perverse Way, and heterodox writings will depart.\n\n**Celestial Patterns and Secret Formulas, Scroll Seventy-Three**\n\nHeaven and Earth possess constant laws, not erring by even a fraction. Distant and near all share the same images; qi of like kind respond to one another, not failing in even one of ten thousand cases. This is called *Celestial Patterns*, also named *Celestial Writings*. Countless billions, thousands of thousands, hundreds of hundreds, tens of tens—whether twelve days complete one cycle of the *zi* branch, or twelve years, sixty years, or one hundred twenty years, each is likewise a cycle of the *zi*. Some align after a hundred million *zi*, some after ten thousand, some after a thousand, some after a hundred, some after ten—all akin to the *jia-zi*. Though their qi differs, their affairs differ, their words differ, their songs and poems differ, though all are *jia-zi*, their qi has not yet completed its cycle, hence the difference. By their kind and image they are named; good and ill share the same qi, same words, same affairs—this constitutes one cycle.\n\nCarefully examining and uniting these reveals how to understand the ancient and thereby know the present, and how to know the present and thereby revisit and clarify the ancient. This is how one knows the constant movement of Heaven, how to distinctly and thoroughly comprehend the principles of yin and yang. If the written words are mistaken or their sequence awry, they should be supplemented by one another; when the songs, sounds, and affairs all align, this is what is called the great cycle, the middle cycle, and the small cycle. Grasping their meaning, ordering their affairs, and thereby harmonizing yin and yang to bring peace to the ruler—this is how one emulates the constant laws of Heaven’s writings.\n\nIt is like spring, autumn, winter, and summer, which do not err. Yet those born later all rely on brief lifespans and have not witnessed even one full cycle—how can they know that within the great, middle, and small cycles there are three cycles? Do the ancient constant spiritual Ways still exist? Thus, they lose the correct path, glimpsing only fleeting moments, and lacking thorough understanding of the divine writings of past and present, they follow partial words and claim their own correctness. It is like a child born in spring who dies before autumn, never witnessing autumn’s affairs, or one born in summer who perishes before winter, never witnessing winter’s affairs. Those who speak only ever see what lies before their eyes, and though ten eloquent debaters may argue, they remain ignorant, inwardly unconvinced.\n\nIf celestial patterns fail to manifest, it is precisely because they are correct. Thus, affairs do not appear in vain; at times there are writings of order and chaos. The Way does not emerge in vain; the times and fate decree it. Therefore, the works of ancient poets all flow from Heaven’s qi, ensuring their words are not empty. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, perceiving the subtle and knowing the manifest, acted in accordance with their tasks, following the qi, and thereby attaining Heaven’s will—hence their long-lasting good fortune. To oppose it brings floods and droughts, qi in discord and conflict, accumulating disasters and unceasing anomalies, called calamities and portents. The many wise grow confused, unaware that it is merely opposing the qi and failing to follow the demands of the times—this cannot but be treated with the utmost caution.\n\nHeaven’s purpose in leaving writings for later generations is that those born earlier know longevity, understand the natural, and enter the Way of emptiness and stillness—thus they know the cycles of Heaven’s Way, which resemble the constancy of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Later generations, their qi long dissipated, their learning shallow, grow distant from the essential Way and its writings, forgetting the teachings of former and present times. Unless one is a divine sage, none can foresee the completion of a cycle. Therefore, Heaven repeatedly generates writings to be recorded and transmitted, so that past and present may mutually rely upon one another, desiring that they know and thereby secure themselves.\n\nEncountering great peace, one may govern while resting at ease. Encountering moderate peace, one may strive to act. Encountering disorder, one may use the Way to aid and prepare oneself. It is like preparing for heat at the summer solstice and cold at the winter solstice—this is the meaning. Heaven’s Way moves in constant cycles, not favoring the ancients. Thus, following it brings prosperity and flourishing; opposing it brings peril and ruin.\n\nWhen Heaven’s Way wages war, its mandate is harmed; the sun and moon lose their measure, and the constellations move in chaos. Knowing to follow the seasonal qi, the sun and moon keep their measure, and the constellations move in order—this is Heaven’s clear proof. Those who can apply this must exert themselves, daring not to conceal or hoard, and must take care not to harm or injure. Heaven’s secret writings are entrusted to the benevolent and worthy, to illuminate above and below and enable self-security.",

      "translated_text": "**Moxibustion and Acupuncture Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Four**\n\nMoxibustion and acupuncture serve to regulate and harmonize the three hundred and sixty meridians, the qi of yin and yang, thereby eliminating harm. The three hundred and sixty meridians correspond to the three hundred and sixty days of a year, with each meridian governing its day, moving in accord with the four seasons and five phases, circulating externally throughout the body and converging at the crown of the head, while internally connecting to the viscera. Their waxing and waning shift with the four seasons; when illness arises, they fail to correspond, their cycles and movements become irregular—knotting, injuring, flowing smoothly, or rebelling—thus requiring treatment.\n\nMoxibustion is the essence of *Taiyang*, the clarity of impartial justice, used to discern deceit and eradicate harm. Acupuncture is the essence of *Shaoyin*, the radiance of *Tai Bai*, employed with righteousness to sever and subdue. When treatment is one hundred percent effective in a hundred cases, or ten out of ten, this aligns with the celestial meridian prophecies of the *Chen* texts, truly resonating with the meridians, and the spirits are thus commanded. When nine out of ten are cured, with one failure, this resonates with the yin meridians, and essence is commanded. When eight out of ten are cured, this is the way of human texts, guided by human intention. Below this standard, illness cannot be treated; instead, it may harm the spirit.\n\nIf the *Jia* meridian is afflicted yet the *Yi* is treated, this is called confusion, for the meridian is uniquely injured and severed. Thus, to discern whether the celestial way is spiritually efficacious or not, whether it corresponds or not, simply place a patient before you—this is the meridian’s root text, akin to the foundational text of the Daoist scriptures. Gather many worthy ones to discuss the illness: some may excel in the upper body, others in the lower; each of the three hundred and sixty meridians has its observable aspects. Record the methods of those whose treatments consistently succeed in ten out of ten cases—these are correct; all others are not. Compile the successful treatments into a scripture, and there will be no unresolved formulae in what is treated.\n\nThe celestial way governs the meridians, whether externally or internally, yet it cannot be fully known. Where treatment succeeds in ten out of ten cases, that is where the meridians converge. Though people vary in size, with differing measurements, their proportions remain the same, and one must rely on the divisions of *Dan* and *Pi* to achieve correspondence. Daoist texts, accumulated over time from diverse sources, are called \"chaotic meridians.\" Treating yin when yang is disordered reverses the cure, bringing misfortune upon people, harming the innocent, and shortening lives.\n\nThe meridians resonate with heaven, earth, and the myriad things, rising with the qi and cycling back to their origin. Those who grasp their patterns may thereby cultivate their nature and discern the arrival of seasonal qi. If there is disharmony, they restore balance. In ancient times, sages and worthies sat in pure stillness, palpating their own meridians, observing the cycles and movements of their pulses to know the gains and losses of the four seasons and five phases, thereby understanding the waxing and waning of their own bodies. This is how they secured the state, nurtured life, and preserved their forms—how could one not be cautious?\n\nThose who are deluded by indiscriminate moxibustion and acupuncture injure the proper meridians, harm the correct qi, and disrupt the four seasons and five phases, bringing forth calamities and anomalies. The great are greatly harmed, the small are slightly harmed, and all may be moved or unsettled—this is the natural course of things. Thus, the ancient sages and worthies held these practices in high regard. The sage emperors and kings observed the movements of the meridians to divine the auspices of the six directions—this is what is meant by \"knowing the distant through the near, the external through the internal,\" and thus it is called the divine and essential way.\n\n**Divine Incantations Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Five**\n\nIn the heavens, there are constant divine and sagely essential words, periodically bestowed upon people for use, dispatching spirit-officials to respond to the qi and come and go. The people who receive them call them \"divine incantations.\" When incantations cure a hundred out of a hundred, or ten out of ten, they are the transmitted scriptural words of the celestial divine texts. Only those incantations that can summon the spirits’ trust, cure illnesses, and consistently succeed in ten out of ten cases are used—there is no direction in which they do not heal. Simply using words to cure illness is the divine prophecy of the heavens.\n\nThese are what good teachers and emperors should employ, compiled into scrolls and named the *Incantation Prophecy Scriptures*. They serve to summon the host of spirits, hence their tenfold efficacy. When nine out of ten are cured, the true spirits do not arrive, but lesser spirits do, and great ministers possess them. When eight out of ten are cured, human spirits arrive, and officials possess them. These are the words of the celestial spirits, originally meant to summon them. Their names and times occasionally leak down to earth, and Daoists who learn of them transmit them to one another, thus enabling the treatment of illness. Like sending a messenger with words, they cannot cure illness.\n\nIn matters of change, one cannot rely on others even for a moment. Heaven values human life, fearing that rare methods are difficult to perfect quickly, and that great physicians may lose the meridian scriptures, failing to comprehend matters of life and death. Thus, the essential way is placed in people’s mouths—this is the art of emergency relief. To obtain these essential words, simply place a patient before you as the root text of the incantation, and let each recite their secret oral formulae. If the illness is immediately cured, it is genuine; otherwise, it is entirely false, the response of deceptive and reckless words, and cannot be taken as a model.\n\nSome incantations may cure when used alone, yet others fail to achieve the same effect—such words cannot be recorded. These are the leaders of ghosts and spirits, naturally employed by people, called \"solitary words,\" not the true way of summoning spirits. Though people and heaven are distant, how can one discern whether the way is true or not? That which is true or false corresponds and harmonizes, fitting like tallying tokens—this is genuine; otherwise, it is not.\n\n**Burial and Residence Formulae, Chapter Seventy-Six**\n\nBurial is the original hillside dwelling of one’s ancestors, called the initial planting of roots. A residence is the earth to which the hun and po souls should return. If the land is auspicious, the souls return to nurture the descendants; if inauspicious, they return to harm them. When the qi of the five ancestors is exhausted, they are reborn as people.",

      "translated_text": "**The Dao of Heaven and the Efficacy of Earth, Chapter Seventy-Six**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven follows the law by which qi circulates and returns to its origin. To discern the efficacy of earth, plant a small, humble seed in the soil; if later days bring flourishing growth and great goodness, it is a land of great vitality. If a fine seed is planted yet later days yield evil, it is a land of inversion. If daily fortunes wane and diminish, it is a land of depletion. Test this with twenty-five families’ burial mounds and hills: if ten, a hundred, or a thousand correspond in harmony, these are the texts of the *Treasured Writ of Earth’s Yin*. If nineteen correspond, it is the *Treasured Record of Earth’s Yin*. If eighteen correspond, it is the *Disordered Writ of Earth*—unfit for regular use. Anything below this is heretical script, harmful writings of the common folk. To verify their truth, record past events and compare them with later outcomes; only then will true and false be distinguished. Know that my writings are like Heaven’s *jia* and Earth’s *yi*, unalterable for ten thousand generations. The root matters of burial and residence, where human life is nurtured, must not be treated lightly. Once affairs are settled carelessly, heretical writings bring harm, causing disasters and misfortunes to arise frequently, bringing great suffering to the worthy and the people. Thus, whether noble or humble, those who wish their descendants to inherit in perpetuity must carefully examine the hills and mounds, clearly discern their principles, and divine future events. Take twenty-five burial mounds as the foundational text, compare them with past events, and record the outcomes to validate present and future affairs. True masters should study these writings closely, dispelling confusion and delusion—this is called the *Divination of Yin’s Concealment*, which discerns how ancestors benefit their descendants, transmitting blessings for ten thousand generations. Guard this well and do not conceal it.\n\n**Discerning the True and False in Ancient Writings, Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n\nAll music serves to convey sound and transform the qi of the six directions and eight extremes. When its tones harmonize, responses come in accord with goodness; when they do not, responses arrive in conflict and opposition. Each sound has its own affiliation—east, west, south, north, *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*—and the twenty-five qi each have their own domain. At times, sounds converge to form coherent phrases, allowing one to perceive subtle words through listening, divining fortune and misfortune. When music aligns with the *Blowing-Hair Pitch-Pipe*, the tones of strings are known. The five notes—*gong*, *shang*, *jue*, *zhi*, and *yu*—distinguish the six directions’ distances and define the auspicious or inauspicious nature of names. How so? Only the refined can perceive the spirits’ responses to events. Thus, the sages of antiquity regulated music to move all things, harmonize yin and yang, and stabilize the four seasons and five phases. When yin and yang are balanced, the sounds are pleasing to hear; when they are disharmonious, discordant and chaotic, the music is harsh, and the strings must be tuned. The silk strings should be arranged in nine-by-nine sequences, with loud and soft sounds in harmony, so as not to harm the viscera and spirit. If untuned, the dance becomes disorderly, the music loses its proper tone, and it cannot be endured, injuring the viscera and spirit—thus, numinous beings and auspicious omens do not appear. Only those who are capable and skilled in sound can harmonize yin and yang’s transformations. How is this known? When the divine and numinous respond, auspicious omens gather—such is the person. Otherwise, all is chaotic noise, incapable of moving anything, and thus no response comes. Therefore, all matters depend on finding the right person. Without the right person, even the divine is as unreliable as reckless speech. With the right person, no matter is too difficult or easy—all can be accomplished. Without the right person, no matter is too great or small—none can be done. Thus, the sages of antiquity valued action and sought the worthy without concealment, as was the way of old. With the right person, order prevails; without them, chaos reigns.\n\nAncient writings are too numerous to record in full. Use one matter to analogize ten, ten to analogize a hundred, a hundred to analogize a thousand, a thousand to analogize ten thousand, ten thousand to analogize a hundred million, and a hundred million to analogize the boundless. Each matter has its own category and affiliation. Place the foundational text of each matter first, so that the knowledgeable may grasp its essence, and those skilled in application may expound upon it. Examine their correspondence and harmony—what aligns is true; what does not correspond or align is false. To discern whether the ancient sages’ writings on the Dao are authentic: this is like calling a person by their surname and given name—only then will they respond. Ghosts and spirits are the same. Without the correct name, there is no response; even if one wishes to harmonize, there is no means to reach them, and thus no response. Thus, the ancients called the study of names *Attending to Essence*. Essence means focusing intently on the matter’s image and suitability, then reflecting on its words. Thoroughly contemplating these writings and strategies completes all matters. Though the texts above and below are numerous, each has its proper application. Study them carefully, supplementing one with another, to fully grasp their meaning. Without deeply understanding their essential intent, words on the Dao are ineffective, and one cannot resolve the conflicts of yin and yang’s struggles.\n\nMy writings are for the benevolent and worthy, entrusted to those of virtue. Those of virtue who receive them treat them as treasures. If received but not read well, one may dismiss them as false Dao, unable to bring joy to the self or avert calamities. When the great Dao is revealed, does it not seem insipid? Yet its use is inexhaustible. Let the worthy reflect on this: can it not harmonize hardness and softness, exhaust the positions of yin and yang? Once all writings are settled in their proper places, is there still confusion? Evil is entirely dispelled, the Supreme Lord rejoices greatly, and the people are free from misfortune. Blessings extend even to the humble, and the teeming myriad things do not lose their qi.

      "translated_text": "The fifty-second scroll is missing.\n\n**Collating the Orthodox and Heterodox Texts, Method Seventy-Eight**\nChun prostrates in trembling reverence and bows twice.\n\n\"What further would you ask?\"\n\"Now that I have seen the true writings of the enlightened master and the orthodox texts of the multitude—these are the discourses of Heaven—I fear and tremble, not knowing which should come first or last, nor by what means one may truly rectify these texts.\"\n\n\"If you wish to grasp their truth, simply examine the sacred words of the High Antiquity, the sacred words of the Middle Antiquity, and the sacred words of the Lower Antiquity. Compare their language and observe their deeds—thus may you know. Further, examine the Daoist texts of the High Antiquity, the Middle Antiquity, and the Lower Antiquity. When these three are harmonized by like calling to like, the truth becomes clear once more.\n\n\"Yet now all writings are deemed the discourses of Heaven—why then do they bring order at times and chaos at others? I wish to hear the reason.\"\n\"Indeed, those who rectify their words and clarify their texts bring order; those who do not bring chaos. Upright speech and careful phrasing必 lead to goodness; perverse speech and ominous phrasing必 lead to evil.\n\n\"You persist in questioning, and as I see your eagerness to know, I shall explain: If you wish to bring forth goodness, simply rectify the root. When the root is upright, it aligns with the celestial patterns and accords with the sacred words. In its second transformation, it aligns with earthly principles; in its third, with human culture; in its fourth, with the myriad things. Then the myriad things flourish in extravagance, and extravagance leads to chaos and ruin.\n\n\"When the celestial patterns and sacred texts emerge in their time, they serve to examine the primordial and rectify the origin, removing excess and establishing truth. To clarify all writings is the Dao of Heaven. Those who grasp upright speech align with the will of Heaven. Heterodoxy brings forth evil qi, causing Heaven and Earth to fall out of harmony, the myriad things to lose their proper places, and the emperor’s heart to be weighed down with sorrow. Chaos returns, and thus one must urgently collate and rectify these texts.\n\n\"From antiquity to the present, all writings have been compiled, yet we lament their assembly without purity, their mingling in disorder. Thus the wise and enlightened are left in doubt and confusion, not knowing what to follow or trust. They lose the utmost sincerity of Heaven and each turns to what contradicts it. This causes their intentions to diverge far from the subtle and profound guidance of the Dao of Heaven. All become heterodox words and heterodox texts, written in perversity, unable to rectify yin and yang. Disasters arise in succession, and the fault lies herein.\n\n\"Seeing your persistent questioning, I cannot bear to withhold my answer. Thus I have expounded repeatedly for your sake. Quickly set down my words and ponder them deeply. For in all matters, if one obtains the truth but cannot practice it single-mindedly, it is of no benefit. If one can practice it, great calamities are averted.\n\n\"When the celestial patterns are in chaos, the desire to see order restored is like a gravely ill person longing for a cure. How can this be achieved? Are you truly so foolish as to remain ignorant? If a grave illness is not treated in time, it leads to death. If the celestial patterns are not rectified, they lead to great chaos. The four seasons lose their qi, the Five Agents turn against one another, the Three Luminaries lose their proper brightness, all deviate from their true paths, and thus perish. The people are thrown into turmoil, all lose their dwellings, the old and weak carry burdens on their backs, half die prematurely, the state falls into darkness and confusion, the supreme Dao and virtuous power are cut off, the worthy are concealed and cannot aid one another—is this not a grave illness?\n\n\"Thus one must strive to rectify it. Now, fools daily study superficial and frivolous texts, competing to contradict one another and vie for superiority, not deeply understanding the great harm they cause, dismissing it as a trifling matter. How could they know that within, it is a grave illness for yin and yang and Heaven and Earth? The world’s inability to rectify itself stems precisely from this.\n\n\"The spirits and deities suffer from this affliction, which is why they have sent you to question me repeatedly. You should ponder their essential meaning day and night, without negligence, for this is no light matter before the August Heaven. Now, the emperor has no place to turn his heart—his fault is grave indeed.\n\n\"Though I speak with you now as but two individuals, within, I am rectifying the discourse for the August Heaven. I dare not speak carelessly or in vain, for the fault would rest upon me, and the sin would be too heavy to absolve. The punishments of the spirits and deities cannot be evaded or escaped like those of mortals.\n\n\"Do you dare to follow my light words as if they were mere worldly chatter, competing for superiority? Truly, I dare not.\"\nChun, hearing the words of the Heavenly Master, trembles yet rejoices. \"I shall exert all my strength, hoping to align with the will of the spirits and deities, to relieve the world’s sorrows, pacify the emperor, and allow the myriad things to each find their proper place. This is my wish.\"\n\"Do you wish only for your own goodness, unable to extend it further?\"\n\"The reason I alone have maintained good intentions is that my learning stems from reflecting on goodness. Thus, while others all grow old and perish, I alone remain. My ancestors’ descendants have all passed away, yet I alone have not died. Truly, I have received a profound mandate, and I am ashamed before the August Heaven, unable to repay it. I constantly think of exhausting my strength, yet I do not know how to make amends.\n\n\"Seeing Heaven and Earth out of harmony and wind and rain unregulated, I know it is a grave illness for the world, and I pity it. Now, having heard the words of the divine person, I am greatly awakened. I wish to devote myself to the death to serve the enlightened Heaven, to resolve the great illness and pacify the earthly principles, thereby aiding the emperor and allowing the myriad things to each find their proper place. In this way, I may repay the profound merit of Heaven. Yet I do not know if I am capable or not. I humbly ask further, for I fall short of the enlightened master.\"\n\"Excellent are your words! Hearing them now, I rejoice—what need is there to speak of Heaven? My words are flawless, not one in ten thousand is lost. You need only strive diligently without slackening to rectify them—this can restore the merit of Heaven, and there is no doubt. If the emperor practices this, he will swiftly gain its power—how much more so for you? Seeing your words, I dare not hold back my strength.\"",

I would prefer not to speak, yet I fear I would incur greater fault with you and suffer heavier punishment from Heaven. Listen carefully once more, and I shall explain it to you again in full detail, turning it over and back.\n\nThe correct text embodies the heart of Heaven and Earth, preserving the primal qi and its principles. In ancient times, sacred texts emerged in their seasons; examining their original characters and proper forms, the Dao was transmitted through mutual dependence. Subtle words and explanations—all were essential to the primal qi. The second transmission contains esoteric phrases; the third forms chapters and verses; the fourth becomes florid embellishment; the fifth diverges into disparate meanings, each asserting its own opposition; the sixth becomes deceptive rhetoric. Even in chapters and verses, only a small portion retains the original intent. Beyond this lies grave illness, causing the Dao of Heaven to lose its way. For this reason, emperors and kings have long suffered, unable to deeply grasp its principles.\n\nYou, fortunate one, wish to repay Heaven’s grace and restore its profound merit. Heaven does not delight in people offering their wealth or rare and counterfeit goods; it delights only in people ordering its texts without confusion. When I first saw you come to study, I thought you would ask but one or two things before leaving—how could I have imagined you would seek to master the Dao of Heaven in its entirety? Though my words may not be perfect, the Dao of Heaven can already be glimpsed through them.\n\nIf you delight in ordering Heaven and Earth, take the subtle words and trace them back to their origins, aligning them with their primal essence—thus you will grasp the heart and intent of Heaven and may pacify the world. Collate the texts of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and recent antiquity, summoning them by category to assemble their correspondences. Let one who holds to the root oversee the work, for each text has its own fundamental matter. All written works belong to distinct lineages; let ordinary people each contribute their talents, gathering to discuss the two interpretations. The original matter, the true nature of the characters, and the factual essence will all emerge of themselves. Gather the essential words within and fashion them into explanations—these are the chapters and verses, wherein the true heart of the Dao is found.\n\nThis may be called resolving Heaven’s anxieties; the great illness is dispelled. This may be called removing the sufferings of the earth. This may be called allowing the emperor to wander in harmony with the heart of Heaven.

Yet the principle remains as you asked before: what resonates in tenfold or hundredfold accord is true; what does not is false.

This is precisely the principle.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhom should we employ to carry out this collation? Each shall attend to their proper role. Those who are clear about the fundamentals shall rely upon them. Those skilled in knowledge and application shall gather together to expound upon them, circulating their discourse from the emperor and kings down to the common people.

Then, all the worthy shall assemble to harmonize and refine their discourse, ensuring stability. This is how counsel reaches even the lowest, leaving no calculation unconsidered, no word abandoned, and no text discarded.\n\nThe lesser worthy shall gather and collate, then submit to the middling worthy. The middling worthy shall collate and submit to the great worthy, and the great worthy shall collate and submit to the emperor and kings.

Well said, your words are most excellent. You have already aligned with the heart of Heaven, and your name shall be recorded as one who has repaid Heaven’s profound merit. Indeed, indeed. Truly, I may now retire to a quiet place to ponder their deepest meaning, never slackening in diligence. Go forth, and doubt no more.\n\n[End of Textual Verification]\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 51 concludes.\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll 53: \"Distinguishing the Four Methods of Governance\" #79\n\nThe Perfected One, Pure and Reverent, bows in trembling reverence. I now wish to pose a further question, though it may not pertain to the Dao. Having witnessed the Illuminated Master resolve every matter without fail, I dare, despite my shame, to step forward once more to ask of a single doubt: what is it? Speak plainly, and I shall explain it to you.\n\nThe ministers of emperors and kings ought all to be elders; the young are fundamentally unfit to govern the world. Why do you ask this? I observe the qi of Heaven—of late, it has repeatedly fallen into disharmony. The fault may lie with officials who fail in their duties, causing the seasonal qi to fall out of balance. The sovereign lacks clarity, disasters multiply, and even Daoists suffer harm. Now, the Three Luminaries of Heaven and Earth themselves are afflicted—where can a true and enlightened Daoist flee to escape unscathed? Thus, though I alone have long been favored by Heaven’s grace, I dare not presume my own safety. From my earliest years, I have sought instruction from masters, yet none could fully resolve my questions. Today, I dare not shrink from shame and must once more inquire of the Heavenly Master, that he may clarify the essential meaning, lest I never come to understand it. Out of kindness, the Illuminated Master cannot refuse and must explain to his disciple what he has not yet grasped.\n\nWell said, your words are most excellent. From what you have spoken today, I know that the governance of Great Peace is already at hand. Nevertheless, I shall explain it all in full; you must record it in detail.\n\nThere are four methods of governance: the governance of Heaven, the governance of Earth, the governance of Man, and when the three qi reach their utmost, the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth. I wish to hear their meaning.\n\nThe governance of Heaven: its ministers are elders, and the ruler treats them as fathers and teachers. Though ministers hold lowly positions, why treat them as fathers and teachers? While their rank may be humble, their virtue and power are most exalted. To treat them as fathers and teachers is to honor their virtue and power, to join with them in counsel and bring peace to the world.\n\nThe governance of Earth: the ruler befriends his ministers, as if sharing the same aspirations and heart. Earth is yin and compliant, like mother and child standing side by side, sharing the same embrace and sorrows. Though ministers may hold lowly positions, their virtue brings harmony, pacifying the ruler’s governance.\n\nThe governance of Man: it diminishes their utility. Ministers are young and small, like a father’s young child, who cannot yet devise strategies for his father. Thus, their governance is slightly disordered.\n\nThe governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth: the ruler regards his ministers and people as dogs or grass and trees, no longer carefully selecting them for office. He merely fills positions as they arise, as if mimicking men without understanding. Why is this? Those who mimic men merely resemble human form but act carelessly, without regard for the ruler’s interests. Thus, they engage in constant strife.\n\nTo emulate the governance of Heaven: the ministers of the world become the ruler’s fathers and teachers, and so he treats them as fathers. A man loves his child—what danger could there be in such times? Fathers and teachers can resolve the crises of the eight directions—how could there be any misfortune?\n\nTo emulate the governance of Earth: the ministers of the world become the ruler’s friends. Sharing the same aspirations and strategies, they unite in bearing sorrows and hardships, seeking to secure their positions together. Earth is compliant and upholds what is above, fully aligning with Heaven’s will and heart—how could there be any time of instability?\n\nTo emulate the governance of Man: it attains the qi of harmony, which is difficult to discern, advancing or retreating unpredictably. It resembles a young child who cannot yet plan for his father and thus deceives him. Ministers who are young cannot deeply consider the ruler’s interests and so deceive him. The young have seen little of the sun and moon, their learning is shallow, and they inspire no awe—thus they deceive, and their governance is slightly disordered.\n\nTo emulate the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth: such creatures lack propriety and righteousness, and the myriad things possess little understanding and no virtue or power. The nature of creatures that walk upon the earth is without hierarchy, seeking only to prevail—thus, their governance leads to chaos and ruin.\n\nThe governance of Heaven is benevolent, cherishing life and avoiding harm. The governance of Earth is compliant and good, though it may cause minor harm. The governance of Man is mutually beneficial and desirous, often leading to mutual injury, deceit, and negligence. The governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth ultimately achieves no success, regardless of scale, seeking only to prevail.\n\nObserving these methods of governance, one can discern whether the qi of Heaven—above, below, and at the center—has lost its proper order. Those who desire the highest joy should emulate the governance of Heaven; those who desire the second joy should emulate the governance of Earth; those who desire the third joy should emulate the governance of Man; and those who desire the fourth joy should emulate the governance of the myriad creatures.\n\nThose who emulate Heaven alone enjoy long life and align with Heaven’s heart. Those who emulate Earth enjoy slightly shorter lives and align with Earth’s intent. Those who emulate Man have diminished lifespans, while those who emulate the myriad creatures die unpredictably and without number.\n\nThose who emulate Heaven practice the Three Ways of written communication. Heaven possesses three luminous texts, forming the Three Illuminations: the sun, the moon, and the arrayed stars. The sun examines yang, the moon examines yin, and the stars examine the center. Thus, the Three Ways of written communication must be employed, striving to attain wisdom and clarity. When documents are sent, they bear the name of the sender alone, without inquiring who the recipient may be.\n\nThose who emulate Earth practice the Two Ways of written communication. Those who emulate Man practice the One Way of written communication, yet still appear to linger carelessly. Those who emulate the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth merely utter words without any written documents.\n\nIs this the will of Heaven, or do men act of their own accord? Is it the work of fate? Nevertheless, when an emperor or king governs toward Great Peace, he should follow Heaven’s will, delighting in goodness and joy, emulating the governance of Heaven. For those aiming at moderate peace, emulate the governance of Earth. For those facing minor disorder, follow the governance of Man. For those facing great chaos and ungovernability, follow the governance of the myriad creatures that walk upon the earth.",

      "translated_text": "Why is this so? And how should it be remedied?\n\nNow, when Heaven intends to exalt a ruler, auspicious omens and sacred texts emerge, bestowed upon him to awaken his profound understanding and entrust him with their wisdom. When decline is imminent, Heaven conceals these texts, ensuring they remain unseen, and further causes the ruler to lose all desire to seek them.\n\nAre worthy ministers merely those who grow old in service? No. To grow old is to be venerable and seasoned, aged in virtue and power, emulating Heaven’s singular constancy in upholding the Dao and acting without the slightest deviation. Thus can they bring stability to their emperor or king. Yet one who grows old without a single insight is unfit for office.\n\nWhat, then, of one who serves as a father to the ruler? Or as a friend? Or as a son? And what of the myriad creatures?\n\nTo serve as a father is to receive instruction as a son does from his stern father, or as a disciple does from his enlightened master. One must grasp the ruler’s innermost strategies and secret sagely writings, employing them to pacify the realm, repay the ancestors, and offer sacrifices in the ancestral temple. By this virtue, one repays Heaven’s profound merit, thereby winning the hearts of all under Heaven. Yin and yang harmonize, and disasters cease.\n\nTo serve as a friend is to join in loyalty and trust, devising strategies together and deeply weighing good and evil, ease and difficulty.\n\nTo serve as a son is to conceal matters as a father might hide something from his child, or as a child might conceal a fault from his parents—each deceiving the other, using this as a means to an end.\n\nAs for the myriad creatures: in times of great chaos, they are countless. In spring and summer, they contend for life; in autumn and winter, they contend for death, granting one another no respite.\n\nChun bows twice. Your questions are many and earnest, far exceeding what is proper—indeed, they surpass even what is due to a master. Yet I dare not conceal these texts. To see them and fail to act would risk offending August Heaven.\n\nWhere, then, should I place this book? Since you have asked, you must exert yourself to carry it forth. When you encounter one who can comprehend it, entrust it to him, that he may deliver it to a virtuous ruler. If the emperor or king models his governance upon it, his rule will surely be divine.\n\nYet if one receives it but fails to ponder and apply it deeply, Heaven will hold him no further accountable.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not oppose my master’s words.”\n\nStill, my words must not be greatly contradicted. For Heaven and Earth desire peace and have revealed this supreme Dao, sending you from afar to inquire of this method. Heaven has commanded me to speak, to transmit these words to you, and I do not speak in vain. Were Heaven unwilling, and I still spoke, recklessly divulging its essential Dao, I would incur punishment. But if you take my words and deliver them, you shall suffer no harm or doubt.\n\nI tell you this in utmost sincerity: Heaven will bestow even greater favor upon the emperor or king, and thus I warn you. Heaven’s course has its appointed times for fortune and misfortune. Those who obtain this and act upon it shall know good fortune without doubt.\n\nI humbly ask: who is the one who will carry this forth? What is his name?\n\nHeaven bestows upon all things without partiality. The one who first delights in practicing it—that is the person.\n\nThe Great Dao is most weighty and cannot be entrusted to private hands. To practice it is auspicious; to neglect it is to invite doubt.\n\nI humbly ask again: what do Heaven and Earth observe? What do they witness? Is there but a single word to be spoken?\n\nTruly, there is something to be observed and witnessed—this is no empty speech. Heaven rejoices in tranquility and peace, free from illness, and delights in perfect equilibrium. Thus it ensures that the people remain serene, without evil words or strife, each dwelling in their proper place. Then there is no illness, and joy abounds, so Heaven speaks without falsehood.\n\nBut if yin and yang clash in opposition, disrupting and harming one another, if all things cannot abide in their proper places, if the sun and moon lose their clarity and the stars stray from their courses, then Heaven is afflicted with illness, distressed and unresolved. It does not transmit its words, and the malady persists.\n\nThus, in times of disorder, discourse arises—minor disorder calls for minor discourse, and great disorder calls for great discourse. From ancient times to the present, divine perfected sages have served as Heaven’s envoys, receiving Heaven’s intent and acting as its voice to speak for Heaven and Earth. Since Heaven and Earth established their work, this has been the constant principle. The writings of sages, past and present, are Heaven’s discourse, Heaven’s words and affairs.\n\nWhat, then, are these words and discourses? They address the sufferings and hardships of the age. Those who lose the essence of the Dao are its substance; those who lack understanding are its refinement. To condemn evil and wickedness is to rectify and perfect the Dao, awakening the people.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth are most exalted and divine, capable of illuminating the highest positions. Why do they not eliminate their own afflictions, instead transmitting words through men?\n\nHeaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Though the parents may be good, if their children act wickedly, dwelling at the center and presiding over their perversity, if governance above and below is inverted and chaotic, then even good parents become a troubled household. It is like a son who brings disorder to his father, a minister who brings disorder to his ruler, a disciple who brings disorder to his master, or a wife who brings disorder to her husband. Such mutual harm and great chaos obscure all goodness.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things originally share a single endeavor. When good prevails, all rejoice; when misfortune strikes, all suffer. Thus they share a common sorrow. If they did not share this endeavor, they would not take turns bearing one another’s burdens.\n\nTherefore, when Heaven and Earth desire goodness and peace, they must employ divine perfected sages to transmit their words, revealing sacred texts to convey their message. This is like an emperor or king who, wishing to delight in goodness, issues good teachings—such is the meaning here.\n\nIf you wish to delight in knowing Heaven’s intent, to repay Heaven’s merit, and to rescue the realm from baleful qi, then this book is the answer. Obtain it, ponder it deeply, and Heaven’s intent will be known.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not be negligent.”\n\nI hope my master will offer one or two more instructions.\n\nNow, good and evil each pertain to the self. The good benefit themselves; the wicked harm their own bodies. Since you possess such a fervent desire for goodness and grieve over Heaven and Earth’s afflictions and the ruler’s unrest, your merit is already vast.",

      "translated_text": "But ponder this carefully: your practice of goodness is unparalleled—do not grieve over it again, and let your devotion to goodness remain constant as it is now.\n\n“Indeed, I dare not grow lax, dare not grow lax.”\n\n**[Section on the Symbols of Stability and Peril in the Four Governances]**\n\n*Here concludes Scroll Fifty-Three of the* Classic of Great Peace. *#1 According to the Dunhuang manuscript* Catalog of the *Classic of Great Peace*, *this chapter should be titled* “Distinguishing the Four Governances, Part Eighty.” *The preceding Scroll Fifty-Two,* “The Yin-Yang Formula of Embryonic Transformation, Part Seventy-Nine,” *is missing. The lacuna appears in* A Collated Edition of the *Classic of Great Peace*, *Scroll Fifty-Two.*\n\n---\n\n**Scroll Fifty-Four of the** *Classic of Great Peace*\n**Method for Preventing Litigation, Part Eighty-One**\n\nI have asked many questions, and the Heavenly Master’s responses flow without end—my inquiries know no bounds. I humbly beg for one or two more instructions.\n\nProceed.\n\nNow, I wish to understand the intent of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the aspirations of the people and all creatures, and the essence of all things, so that they may perpetually delight in goodness, wander freely without duties or affairs, each correcting themselves, no longer turning to mutual sorrow and reproach. Might I hear how this may be achieved?\n\nYou now ask: what is the most singularly excellent and extraordinary question? What is the unparalleled devotion to goodness?\n\nIf your inquiry is as you describe, then matters should follow their natural course, each attaining their heart’s desire. One should act according to their abilities, never forcing what lies beyond their capacity. In this way, each obtains what they seek. When each obtains their desire, none will suffer sorrow. Then, each attains their heart’s intent and may be said to wander without duties. Between Heaven and Earth, if one is constantly compelled to act beyond their ability, forced to do what they cannot, and burdened with what they cannot bear—if, when they fail to act or speak, they are not shown compassion and taught but instead reproached, their grievances will fester. Resentment and litigation will multiply, the people will suffer in distress and poverty, and they will lift their voices to Supreme Heaven, crying, “Truly, we are wronged! Truly, we are wronged!” Their qi will stir the six directions. Thus, disasters and anomalies will arise in profusion, accumulating in myriad forms, impossible to swiftly eradicate. The harm will be severe, for this is to lose the hearts of all under Heaven. In the end, no success will be achieved, and strange omens will never cease. How then can the qi of Great Peace arise? Thus, Great Peace cannot be attained—this is precisely the fault.\n\nThough one may claim to govern with constant equanimity, if internal chaos persists, how can the realm be purified? You now ask this, wishing to know it thoroughly.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is such that all things have their proper place. One should employ their strengths and abilities, but never force what they cannot do. Though all things receive the qi of yin and yang, it is like fish that cannot live without water—they cannot swim upon high mountains. Yet when water is present, regardless of depth or shallowness, they can swim freely. Great trees cannot grow without soil—they cannot thrive in the midst of rivers and seas. Thus, the sage-kings of antiquity, when assigning tasks, selected from the five types of soil according to their suitability. Only then did things flourish and prosper, the state grew wealthy, the ancestral temples offered rich flavors, and all under Heaven enjoyed peace without suffering. Baleful qi ceased to spread and cause harm.\n\nIf one does not divine and assess the land before planting, the myriad things will fail to complete their natural lifespan. They will harbor unresolved grievances, die prematurely, and their distress will ascend to move Supreme Heaven. Nothing will be reaped, the state will grow impoverished, food will lack richness, the ancestral temples will hunger and thirst, and all under Heaven will suffer. The people will turn to mutual harm, ruler and minister will deceive one another, and internal and external affairs will diverge in speech. This is where the fault truly begins. If even the myriad things cannot find their proper place, how much more so for humans? The world cannot be governed rightly—this is the reason.\n\nThis is the root of great harm, the path to peril and ruin. How can one not be cautious? How can one not ponder it deeply in their heart?\n\nThus, the great sages and worthies of antiquity, when appointing officials, first tested their strengths and weaknesses before assigning them duties. They entrusted them accordingly. If a person erred, they reproached them, but only regarding their strengths, never their shortcomings. This does not offend Heaven. Instead, it encourages the refinement of their learning, and thus they gain the hearts of all under Heaven.\n\nIn later ages, matters were neglected. People did not deeply reflect on the words of the ancient sages. Instead, they appointed people to positions beyond their competence, reproached them for what they could not achieve, and questioned them on what they could not perceive. The blind cannot see the sun, the mute cannot speak—yet they hastened to expose their shortcomings, treating them as grave faults, and punished them. They did not seek to bring joy and mutual benefit but instead engaged in cunning manipulation, harming one another in turn. This is the great ruin of all under Heaven.\n\nThe lords of antiquity who brought Great Peace possessed no extraordinary divine methods. They simply employed people according to their abilities and hearts’ desires, and thus they summoned the qi of Great Peace without grievances among the people. When calamity and chaos arise, it is always because people are assigned tasks beyond their competence, forced to perform duties unsuited to them, and heavily reproached. Even if punished with death, they cannot fulfill their duties. Disasters will arise in succession, impossible to suppress, leading to ruin and defeat. Good and ill fortune, safety and peril—all originate here.\n\nThus, when the ancients selected officials for the emperor or king, they first examined and tested their abilities, determining whether they aligned with the auspicious responses of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang. Those who did not align were deemed false in conduct. How does one achieve such alignment? Great persons receive great responses, lesser persons receive lesser responses. Wind and rain arrive in their proper seasons, the myriad things flourish and thrive, the people are free from complaint, and birds and beasts move and act in tranquility. These are the signs.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who govern with music and desire to pacify the state must carefully examine their appointments. For Heaven generates the myriad things, each endowed with its own talents and capacities, each suited to its proper place—just as dragons ascend to the heavens and fish swim in the depths. This is what is meant.\n\nSince the establishment of Heaven and Earth, governance has taken myriad forms, and the transformations of Heaven shift with the times. The essential principle is to accord with the intent of Heaven and Earth, fulfilling what they desire. Heaven uses the Three Luminaries as its script and records, marking cycles of rise and decline, with wind as the sovereign. Earth employs mountains and rivers, fields and paths as its veins and textures; mountains exhale qi, waters flow through channels, and their decline, flourishing, movement, collapse, and convergence are reflected in the winds and anomalies of ministers. Humans transmit through speech and language, their writings and records evolving over time. The myriad things speak through their flourishing and decline, allowing people to perceive and understand them.\n\nHumans stand at the center of yin and yang, serving as the teachers and leaders of the myriad things. Their abilities are most numerous, embodying the spirit while possessing form, advancing and retreating in transformation. They must meticulously record these changes and report them to their sovereign. Thus, if one matter is not communicated, grievances accumulate; if two are obstructed, blockages arise; if three are cut off, isolation follows; if four are unaddressed, harmony fails to respond, and the generation of things becomes irregular. If five are uncommunicated, the circulation of qi and the Dao falters; if six are obstructed, the six directions breed malice; if seven are cut off, ruin ensues; if eight are unaddressed, governance becomes fragmented among factions; if nine are obstructed, mutual harm arises; if ten are uncommunicated, mutual upheaval follows. Therefore, one must strive to ensure the free flow of communication.\n\nIn ancient times, when there was no writing, how was communication achieved? Writing arose precisely for this purpose. Yet how often does it align with Heaven and Earth, how often does it cease? Later generations simply have not witnessed it. In the middle antiquity of the Three Sovereigns, words were established without writing. In later antiquity, the qi of Heaven and Earth rose and fell in cycles, and only divine beings, untouched by age, knew their origins. Through many vicissitudes, they understood that inherent patterns must contain writing, though later generations have not seen it. Why, then, does writing sometimes exist and sometimes not? As Heaven’s qi declines, people grow foolish, feeble, and short-lived, unable to inscribe records. Thus, writing was commanded to enable transmission across time, preserving knowledge of antiquity. Without writing, disputes could not be settled, each party claiming rightness, so writing was instituted. This was due to the foolishness of the age, and thus writing was created, as Heaven issued its covenant.\n\nHaving heard the master’s words, I now understand. I wish to know: how should one ensure the free flow of qi today? Simply let the Three Dao circulate the writings of the eight directions, and let the words of officials and commoners alike not be arbitrarily delayed. Urgent matters should be resolved in their time; non-urgent ones may follow the rhythms of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. After seven months, when things reach their end, review them in the eighth month, reorder them in the ninth, and by the tenth month, those unresolved should be recorded. After three years, those whose records demonstrate utmost sincerity should be sought out and appointed. Such individuals are the state’s finest ministers—keen of hearing and sight, able to observe and listen without fail to the signs of the four directions. When the emperor or king obtains them, the state is at peace and enlightened; thus, they must be entrusted.\n\nHow, then, should they be entrusted? Each must be questioned about the extent of their abilities, allowing them to record what they can do, what they can resolve, and what they excel in. Appoint them according to their innate nature, and their governance will be without error. Thus, they will win the hearts of all under Heaven, and their rule will daily advance toward Great Peace—without punishments, without scarcity, without grievances. Heaven and Earth will achieve perfect harmony, all things flowing freely. This is how one attains the longevity of the Supreme Sovereign. Those who live long do so because they avoid punishment and harm; those who inflict much harm bring it back upon themselves.\n\nThus, in high antiquity, the sagely and worthy refused to favor punishments. In middle antiquity, punishments were used sparingly, so longevity was halved. In later antiquity, punishments were used extensively, so longevity was greatly diminished. Punishment is an evil that offends Heaven, disrupts yin and yang, and accumulates as malevolent qi, returning to harm people. The sages of high antiquity avoided its heavy use out of care for their own lives. The people of middle antiquity were half foolish, lightly employing punishments, and thus half destroyed themselves. The people of later antiquity were greatly foolish, treating punishments as routine, and thus most did not attain longevity. The fault lies here.\n\nThose who read this scripture should reflect on it repeatedly, valuing and heeding it. Life and death are weighty matters; they must not be treated lightly. A worthy and wise son plans deeply for his father; a worthy and wise minister plans deeply for his sovereign. An unworthy son does not plan deeply for his father; an unworthy minister does not plan for his sovereign. The young of today—are they not their own selves? The fortunes and misfortunes that befall them are the legacy of these patterns for later generations.\n\nTherefore, when the sagely emperors and kings of high antiquity appointed ministers, they carefully selected those of Dao and virtue who did not delight in killing or harm. This was not merely for the sake of the people but for their own deep well-being. Thus, they aligned with the hearts of Heaven and Earth, their actions moving as if in concert with the spirits. This is what is meant by \"careful selection yielding the right person\"—a ruler who gains the strength of others. Such rulers move the gods and spirits, and the true spirits of Heaven above come to love them, granting them unique longevity. Those who favor punishments align with yin qi, and yin is killing; thus, they do not attain great longevity. The decree of Heaven is discernible and knowable—what Heaven, Earth, and humans detest is the same.\n\nTo the right: Those who win the hearts of Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things, whose states prosper and families are secure, whose realm knows no disputes—this is the conclusion of *The Scripture on Great Peace*, Scroll Fifty-Four.\nHere ends *The Scripture on Great Peace*, Scroll Fifty-Five.",

      "translated_text": "**Forceful Practice and Broad Learning, Formula Eighty-Two**\n\nNow, can the great mandate be known or not? Though it may be known, having met an enlightened teacher and heard their words, the greatest delusions are already dispelled—yet still, out of necessity, I wish to reiterate this earnestly.\n\nThus, the intent of my Dao may be discerned. Those who obtain these writings and read them often lament their lack of mastery; only the mastered may fully comprehend them. Without profound reflection on their deepest meaning, without meticulous study, even possessing these writings brings no benefit. To obtain them yet fail to practice forcefully—how does this differ from never having obtained them? To see food yet not eat—how does this differ from having no grain? To see broth yet not drink—thirst remains unquenched. This does not harm others but harms oneself—can one not be cautious?\n\nTherefore, the sage exerts forceful thought, the noble person exerts forceful study, day and night without ceasing, delighting in emulating Heaven, which revolves unceasingly. The hundred rivers flow and gather to form the great seas. Heed my words, remember my repeated admonitions—your heart’s devotion may be seen.\n\nDo good and share it with the worthy; take care not to monopolize the market. For if the market has few, what one seeks cannot be obtained. Thus, those who do not study broadly cannot see clearly. This is why, though one may glimpse the true Dao, its essential meaning remains elusive. Without faith in the Dao, doubt lingers—each person’s self-imposed limitation lies herein. Therefore, one must deeply ponder its intent to enable self-rescue and assistance.\n\n**To the right: Pointers on Longevity and Life Span.**\n\n---\n\n**Knowing Prosperity and Decline, the Method of Restoring Years and Lifespan, Formula Eighty-Three**\n\nHeaven bestows affairs, each with its own laws. Mandates may be entrusted, the Dao may be practiced; some emerge sooner, some later, their signs gradually appearing. It is like the myriad things: sprouting at *zi*, growing at *mao*, branching at *wu*, ripening at *you*, and ending at *hai*. Though signs appear in advance, they cannot be guaranteed.\n\nEach affair has its moment of action. When the first glimmers of light appear, though the matter is not yet at hand, its path is prepared in advance. Heaven’s portents always precede, never following behind. When the right person is found and the way is opened, they receive aid and support. Without opening, without passage, no success is achieved—this is not the right person.\n\nThis serves as clear evidence. The Dao is precise in its pronouncements; ten thousand times, not once does it err. If it is the right person, the way is opened for them; if not, it remains closed. When the right person is found, illnesses may be dispelled, calamities and omens vanish of themselves, barbarians submit without need of arms, and all dissipates naturally.\n\nThe generation of the myriad things has its own arrangements. With the right person, it unfolds of itself; without, it withdraws. In all matters, without the right person, one cannot force action. What is not theirs cannot be forcibly taken; what is not their land cannot be forcibly planted. If planted, it will not grow. To speak of poor seeds—if they do not find their proper place within, how can they endure? The six directions and eight quarters each have their suitability; their phenomena appear differently in each.\n\nFor example, the Metal phase resides in the West, the Wood phase in the East. Each thrives in its proper place and perishes when misplaced. Thus, the myriad things take root in the earth to live; they cannot take root in Heaven. The sun, moon, stars, and celestial stems and branches, by contrast, attach to Heaven to generate light.\n\nThe Dao is like this. When the right person exists, stars in the sky shine brightly; if they fall to earth, they lose their light—this is not their proper place, and thus the constant Dao is disrupted. What can be done does not proceed recklessly. If it is the right person, it becomes clear; if not, it cannot be enacted.\n\nThe Dao is profound and distant, beyond measure. Those who lose it fail; those who attain it prosper. To know one’s own prosperity and decline, observe where the Dao takes root—spiritual numina may then flourish. Within, there are signs of longevity; by this, not once in ten thousand times is there error.\n\nThis is a divine scripture, a method for restoring years. Its Dao is of utmost importance—how can one not ponder it? Therefore, transmit it to the benevolent and wise, testing them to see if they may preserve their lives.\n\nWhen the right person appears, worthies and sages emerge together, divine scriptures arrive, and extraordinary methods arise of themselves, bringing joy to all—this is the right person. This is the proof. If it does not accord with these words, though signs may appear first, they cannot be enacted.\n\nIt is to be passed to later generations; the Dao does not emerge recklessly. There are those for whom it is fitting—only ask the person to reflect for themselves. The Dao’s return cannot be forbidden, nor can it be compelled. One must allow it to proceed as it will, observing its success. The Dao cannot be empty.\n\nNevertheless, talent is not as good as effort, and effort is not as good as unceasing action. All affairs under Heaven are tested through trial and failure. Heaven, Earth, and the spirits all test people; thus, people emulate the Heavenly Dao in testing one another.\n\nThose who encounter goodness—their mandate is already good. Those who encounter evil—their mandate is already doubtful. From ancient times to the present, nothing moves Heaven except utmost sincerity. To demand forcefully is called coercion; though one may sometimes obtain it thus, what is coerced is not truly theirs. How can it be forcibly taken? Such affairs are not harmonious and good, but discordant and chaotic.\n\nHuman mandates have three grades. Entrust the Dao to the wilderness, to those capable of using it. For those incapable, entrust it to the capital, place it in the marketplace—take care not to cut it off, lest later generations have no heirs. Transmit the scriptures to sages, worthies, and Daoists. Without a master, without a name, entrust them to those who can use them.\n\nThe Dao has its own fitting recipients; it cannot be given to just anyone. It may be conveyed through words. Like great trees returning to the mountains, like water flowing to the sea—it cannot be stopped. This is the nature of Heaven. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it perish.\n\nDivine scriptures seek to emerge; they cannot be concealed. With the right person, they will surely manifest. Without, they remain dark, deaf, and blind—body unjoyful, eyes without light. To study this text with focus brings delight.\n\nAll that pertains to the flourishing of Heaven and the extension of life’s span lies herein.",

      "translated_text": "**The Ninety-Ninth Method of Severing Metal: Military Strategy**\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions, in pure reverence, bow twice and declare: We wish to inquire of the celestial laws, yet dare not speak hastily. May the August Celestial Master grant us this audience, allowing our words to be heard?\n\nSpeak without doubt.\n\nWe obey.\n\nNow, the Celestial Master alone can resolve the inherited disasters of emperors and kings, crafting methods to exalt the sovereign and eradicate all calamities, omens, and inauspicious signs under heaven. We, though foolish, wish to assist the heavens, allowing the qi of Great Yang to shine brightly, the emperor’s power to flourish daily, treacherous cunning to be extinguished, evil men to be barred from action, bandits and thieves to vanish, and malevolent spirits to conceal themselves, never again to arise. May we hear of this?\n\nExcellent is the question of the Six Disciples! The heavens command the Perfected Ones to speak.\n\nWe obey.\n\nWhen the noble man is free from worry, the malevolent ministers and petty men dare not act. Victory is already assured, and disasters will naturally cease.\n\nNow, I shall fully expound the celestial model for you, disciples, so that not a fraction is lost. Record it as you follow.\n\nWe obey.\n\nThus, the celestial laws manifest signs, which the sages of antiquity constantly emulated, never daring to transgress. They perpetually suppressed inauspicious forces, severed cunning, and prevented malevolent ministers from acting—all by adhering to the celestial laws. Their aim was to ensure the daily rise of yang qi, the radiance of fire to grow ever brighter, never knowing decline. To achieve this, they swiftly severed the qi of metal, preventing its dominion.\n\nWhen metal qi is severed, wood qi gains dominion, and fire qi shines brilliantly without end. What does this mean?\n\nThe ruler must swiftly abolish weapons, for weapons belong to the category of metal. This is why they must be swiftly abolished. Yet now, rulers in their dominion frequently bestow blades and arms upon their ministers—weapons of metal, which the emperor himself grants to reign. This is called the \"reign of metal.\" When metal reigns, it suppresses wood and weakens fire. When metal reigns, it deprives the movements of jia and yi wood of their qi. If wood is severed and yi qi is cut off, fire cannot shine. When wood reigns, earth cannot be born. If fire does not shine, earth qi rises daily, the qi of the earth stirs repeatedly, and inauspicious omens arise. Thus, they must be swiftly eradicated.\n\nIt is said: the category of weapons must not be bestowed; metal objects and arms must not be granted, for they suppress and sever inauspiciousness.\n\nThe heavens’ aversion is no different from that of the spirits. We wish to know: why does the rise of metal suppress wood, and in turn, cause fire to wane?\n\nExcellent is your challenging question! It may be called an entry into the Dao. The Perfected Ones wish to delight in knowing its great effects. Thus, when metal weapons are deployed in spring, they injure the movements of jia and yi wood, causing the Azure Emperor of Heaven to be displeased and the Vermilion Emperor to rage greatly. Bing, ding, si, and wu become disobedient. Seeking to avenge the grievances of their parents, they compel the fire phase to act, generating many calamities, omens, inauspicious signs, malevolent harms, and treacherous cunning. The law, in reverse, causes fire to govern in chaos—is this not impermissible? The great fault lies here.\n\nExcellent indeed!\n\nWe wish to know: why must there be many malevolent ministers, cunning treacherous men, and bandits?\n\nI shall explain again for the Perfected Ones, so that you may clearly understand. The celestial model decrees: when parents encounter harm, their children must avenge it. Those who avenge grievances inevitably gather inauspiciousness. The deceitful, flattering, cunning, and reckless youths—those capable of lawlessness—are the ones who avenge grievances and commit rebellion.\n\nThus, from the bestowal of metal weapons arises the suppression of wood, and the governance of fire cannot be pacified. This is the eternal model of the heavens, not to be altered for any reason.\n\nIf the Six Perfected Ones do not believe my words, then swiftly sever metal weapons. Whoever dares to wield them shall bear grave punishment. Immediately, fire disasters will be eradicated, governance will be swiftly pacified, and all under heaven will say, \"Excellent!\" The reason is this: fire represents the ruler, and thus its transformations and omens are the most severe. The other four phases cannot compare.\n\nIf you wish to further know its clear effects, observe Mars, whose transformations are the most severe—this is the evident proof. The other four stars cannot compare.\n\nTake heed of my words and writings; the celestial laws do not err by even a fraction.\n\nWe obey.\n\nProceeding, I shall again clarify the celestial laws for the Six Disciples. Thus, when metal qi is entirely eradicated and severed, wood qi gains great dominion, suppressing the earth phase below. Yellow qi cannot arise, and so in spring, wood reigns and earth dies.\n\nThus, in spring, the heavens forcibly sever metal qi at wu, allowing wood to flourish, fire qi to grow ever brighter, and metal qi to be imprisoned. Cunning men are severed and eradicated. When metal is imprisoned, water qi rests. Yin does not dare harm yang, and life below flourishes. Be cautious, and there will be no disasters or omens.\n\nWhen wood qi reigns without metal, it gains ascendancy and acts. Earth qi dies. The people and ministers are loyal, reverent, and trustworthy, daring not to transgress. This is the celestial model, the contract of the heavens—a constant nature and eternal principle of heaven and earth. Do you understand?\n\nWe obey.\n\nProceed. You have already understood.\n\nNow, I shall again clarify the celestial laws for the Six Disciples, to be passed down orally.\n\nToday, the world follows weapons—metal qi. Moreover, rulers, at the beginning of the year, bestow blades and arms, or during tours of the four directions, grant metal weapons upon halting. The ruler is king, and to bestow metal weapons upon others is called \"king of metal.\" When metal reigns, water is minister. When metal reigns, it harms wood. When water is minister, it harms fire.\n\nThe northwest is yin; the southeast is yang. When lesser yin gains dominion, greater yin becomes minister. This is called the two qi both overcoming yang. Disasters arise below, treacherous men act lawlessly, yin qi stirs and generates many false words, and bandits arise. This is the celestial model. Do the Six Disciples understand?\n\nWe obey.\n\nThus, the Six Perfected Ones have understood. Take heed of the celestial laws.",

      "translated_text": "\"Yes, yes. Now we humbly ask: the southeast is yang—why then is it called the 'Earth Gate'? And the northwest is yin—why is it called the 'Heavenly Gate'?\n\nIndeed, gates and doors are where the qi of Heaven and Earth first arises, where all things enter and exit. Thus, the southeast is the utmost yang; when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born—hence the southeast is called the Earth Gate. The northwest is the utmost yin; when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born—hence it is called the Heavenly Gate. If the Perfected Ones wish to know its proof: when the first yang line rises at *jiazi*, and the first yin line rises at *jiawu*—this is what it means.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven is like a cycle: when it completes its circuit, it returns to the beginning. How could it ever cease? When a king takes up his mandate, the subtle qi of the corresponding phase will follow and arise.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Let me now explain one matter fully to the Six Perfected Ones. When a ruler greatly mobilizes troops, it causes the phase of Wood to be greatly startled and lose its qi, allowing Earth to gain dominion. When Earth gains dominion, Metal becomes its great minister. When Metal is great minister, it causes weapons and armor to be frequently deployed. The qi of *Qian* and *Dui* stirs, and in the northwest, barbarians, treacherous bandits, and thieves arise in great numbers—this is the natural law. The spirits of Heaven and Earth cannot prevent it. Therefore, one must urgently suppress and sever Metal’s implements to prevent its phase from flourishing.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Having heard the Master expound the celestial laws, we now know their awesome power. If one knows to revere them, good fortune follows.\n\nNow, the Radiant Master of August Heaven, in compassion for our ignorance and blindness, has deigned to explain the celestial laws in full. But is this teaching meant for only one ruler’s reign? Or are these the universal laws for all under Heaven?\n\nIndeed, Heaven establishes this as the constant celestial model. Yet if the phases of Wood or Fire recklessly rise, or if Metal’s peaks and coins spur the frequent dominion of thieves, it brings great harm and makes governance difficult to stabilize. If Metal’s qi gains great dominion, the harm is severe. Only by aligning with our celestial laws and severing it will good fortune immediately follow. When governance flourishes, treacherous ministers vanish—Heaven’s laws do not deceive.\n\nWe humbly wish to hear the essential intent behind Heaven’s establishment of this model.\n\nAh, how thorough are the Six Disciples’ questions! Know then: Heaven and Earth regard the east as lesser yang—the beginning of the ruler’s birth. Thus, the sun rises in the east. The south is taken as greater yang, and the ruler is yang. Thus, *Li* is the sun, and the sun is the ruler. The south is Fire. Fire is the ruler, and the south is summer—the season when the four seasons nurture growth, when pregnancy and flourishing are at their peak. Its virtue is the greatest, hence it is the ruler. This is the celestial model.\n\nThough *jue* tone belongs to the east, it is aligned with the east’s position, and Fire’s position is aligned with the south. Now, as the qi of Great Peace flourishes and arrives, Heaven will exalt yang qi. Seeing the Six Perfected Ones’ questions, I know you are sent by Heaven. Thus, I have explained in full the methods for exalting the greater yang ruler’s phase. Take heed, Perfected Ones.\n\nYes, yes.\n\n**The First Hundred Methods for Bestowing Upon Subordinates**\nNow, the Heavenly Master, in compassion, has fully expounded the celestial laws for us unworthy ones. We humbly ask one further matter: when the emperor meets with his ministers and even the common people—Heaven’s laws regard the ruler as their father and mother. When he meets his ministers, they are the ruler’s worthy sons, assisting in governing Heaven and Earth. The people are the ruler’s unfilial children, managing the fields and livelihoods. When meeting them, should there not be something to bestow? If nothing is bestowed, grace and love do not extend to the people and ministers, leaving the Red Children with no Way to recite. What is to be done?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, is your question! When meeting the worthy, bestow culture; when meeting the hungry, bestow food; when meeting the cold, bestow clothing. Why bestow culture upon the worthy? Culture arises in the east and is illuminated in the south. Thus, celestial patterns arise in the northeast, and scriptures emerge from the northeast, where Heaven reveals its images. The tiger has patterns and dwells in *yin*; the dragon has patterns and dwells in *chen*, ascending to Heaven. *Li* is the locus of culture, governing the southern phase. Thus, the Three Luminaries embody culture, and the sun is the greatest illumination.\n\nTherefore, culture arises in the east and flourishes in the south. Thus, the sun rises in the east and is at its peak in the south. Heaven commands the emperor to model himself after Heaven’s laws. Thus, he must bestow culture to foster its flourishing. Greater yang is the phase of Fire, and the sun, rising with Fire, can distinguish and perceive culture—what is cultured and what is not—just as it records right and wrong under Heaven.\n\nExcellent, excellent.

When this heartfelt longing is fulfilled, their thoughts turn to their lord and king, and even in old age, they do not forget. They aspire to repay with utmost effort, daring not to harbor divided loyalty. The grace and love thus permeate the people, so that if they obtain any rare, extraordinary methods or excellent Daoist texts, they dare not conceal them. They will surely reflect and present them to their ruler, that he may enjoy longevity. This is why such bestowals are made—this is called \"aiding the destitute and relieving the urgent.\"\n\nThe worthy delight in texts, the hungry delight in food, the cold delight in clothing. When a lord bestows upon his ministers and people, he must ensure each receives what they desire, and then the world will be content and submit.

      "translated_text": "Let the Six Disciples ponder deeply the meaning of my writings. Present them to rulers of the highest Dao and virtue, and show them to all worthies—my words do not betray the enlightened clarity of Heaven and Earth.\n\nGo now, for this minor discourse is complete. If other matters remain unclear, return again to ask.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow the Six Perfected Ones, having received the Celestial Master’s stern teaching, shall retire each to a quiet place, reflect upon the Master’s words, and bring forth any points they do not understand, that the Celestial Master may reveal the decisive instruction.\n\nWhat is the meaning of these words?\n\nNow, Heaven naturally possesses the qi of the four seasons, and Earth naturally possesses the positions of the Five Phases. Their waxing, waning, flourishing, imprisonment, and decline follow their own times. Yet it is only when people arise and employ them that they can generate vital qi, causing the phases to alternately overcome and destroy one another.\n\nTsk, tsk!\n\nAlas! Though the Six Disciples study daily, it is of no benefit—rather, they grow more foolish, scarcely different from the ignorant. Why is this? The laws of Heaven and Earth decree that the rise and fall of the myriad things follow human agency.\n\nWhatever matters people collectively engage in, whatever things they value and employ, all flourish and generate vital qi. What people abandon and neglect all decline and become imprisoned. Thus, what people take up and pursue becomes their ruler, leader, and teacher. What they contend over becomes precious and without measure. What they abandon and neglect becomes base and without worth.\n\nTherefore, what the world’s people take up and employ flourishes of its own accord, generating vital qi—it need not wait for the qi of the four seasons or the Five Phases. Thus, the law of Heaven decrees that the rise and fall of people determine the rise and fall of the myriad things; nobility and baseness depend entirely upon human action.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity understood the unalterable laws of Heaven and dared not transgress them lightly. In the highest antiquity, people deeply revered the Dao, employed the Dao, and acted in accordance with the Dao—thus the Dao reigned. In the middle antiquity, when the Dao was abandoned and not practiced, it became imprisoned and declined, no longer esteemed. In the middle antiquity, when virtue was taken up and employed, virtue reigned. In the lower antiquity, when the highest virtue was abandoned, virtue again became imprisoned and declined.\n\nThus, when people take up and employ culture, culture reigns; when they take up and employ military force, military force reigns; when they take up and employ gold and coin, gold and coin reign; when they take up and employ wealth and goods, wealth and goods reign. Whatever the world’s people take up and employ flourishes of its own accord, generating vital qi. What they collectively abandon and do not employ becomes mere common things—why must they wait for the waxing of Heaven’s four seasons and the Five Phases before they can reign?\n\nWhy, in your studies, do you not grow ever clearer, but instead sink deeper into darkness and ignorance?\n\nIf even Perfected Ones remain thus, how much more do the common people violate Heaven’s prohibitions, insisting that this is not so!\n\nNow, comparing you to them, your folly is uniquely long-standing. If your words were true, would I, in expounding Heaven’s laws and resolving the inherited burdens of former kings to relieve the disasters they bequeathed, lead people into error with teachings that cannot be employed? If they were erroneous, how could they be put into practice?\n\nIf the Six Disciples still harbor doubts and wish to know the great efficacy of my Way, to discern whether it is truly true or not, then swiftly present it to a ruler of enlightened virtue, that he may put it into practice. Immediately, it will resonate with Heaven and Earth as an echo responds to sound—this will be clear proof of its efficacy.\n\nYet even now, Perfected Ones cannot deeply understand that it is people who cause things to flourish or decline, advance or retreat. Compared to you, the common people are no different from the blind—what distinction is there?\n\nNow, seeing that the Celestial Master has distinguished and explained these matters for his foolish disciples, have you understood? Is there any fault in this?\n\nOne who studies must strive to grasp the essential meaning, not merely recite the words.

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Nine August Ones all first sprouted in the North; the Five Emperors first emerged in the East; the Three Kings flourished in the South; and the Five Hegemons reached their consummation in decline in the West.\n\nAll things born of Heaven arise as yang qi, following primordial qi, merging with the Great Yin to germinate. At birth, they must emerge and grow, hence they flourish in the East. Once born, they must thrive, hence they reach their peak in the South. Having flourished, they must bear fruit, hence they wither and mature in the West.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, completes its cycle.\n\nYet things cannot remain in fruition forever—they die, and nothing more. But the seeds of their roots must regenerate, so yin and yang together enter the Gate of Heaven, merging their qi in Qian, to begin anew from above. This is the natural nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nWhy then do Heaven, Earth, and humanity not share the same Three August Ones, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons?\n\nExcellent indeed—your question grasps its meaning.\n\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity are divided into three domains, each dwelling apart.\n\nThe Way of the August Ones is like the father in a household; the Way of the Emperors is like the mother; the Way of the Kings is like the son; and the Way of the Hegemons is like the wife.\n\nNow, these three domains dwell separately—how could they share the same father, mother, son, and wife? It is as if people were divided into three households—could they possibly share the same parents, children, and spouse?\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nBe cautious—do not recklessly challenge what you do not grasp. The Dao of Heaven has its own fixed and constant laws; one cannot forcibly oppose them, nor dare act with brute strength.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThough each time you ask, you transgress the taboos of the Heavenly Master, yet without asking, there is no way to know. I wish to beg one more word.\n\nProceed.\n\nNow, there are forty-eight sections—how do these forty-eight sections operate?\n\nExcellent and thorough—your question is most fitting.\n\nThose who follow the will of Heaven in this practice will prevent calamities from arising. Those who lose the essential Dao of Heaven will find disasters unending. Thus, for myriad generations, they inherit and bear the consequences in succession.\n\nA good ruler can cause misfortunes to subside on their own, dissolving their transgressions. But the most essential Way of self-cultivation, when reversed, allows perverse qi to spread throughout the world. Thus, residual disasters arise, becoming the adversities of inherited consequences.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nNow, listen carefully to my words.",

From birth, I have never heard that people incur crimes without violating the law.\n\nYour words are correct and align with common understanding.\n\nYet you fail to see that ordinary people bear six great crimes, which cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations.\n\nPerfected One, you study yet remain blind to these manifest crimes—does your learning not suffer from confusion?\n\nThis foolish one is suddenly awakened and does not suffer from confusion.\n\nYet you remain suddenly unaware. When common people die with grievances bound in their hearts, is this not truly dire?\n\nThey die in ignorance, only to awaken afterward.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, people have first been deluded and later enlightened—what fault lies in this?\n\nI wish to hear of it.\n\nIndeed, when people accumulate the Dao without limit yet refuse to teach others to awaken and seek life, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they sever the Dao of Heaven’s generation and become enemies of Heaven.\n\nWhen people accumulate virtue without limit yet refuse to earnestly teach others to guard virtue, nurture their nature, and act with care, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they sever the Earth’s nurturing virtue and become enemies of Earth, greatly faulting humanity.\n\nWhen people amass wealth by the millions yet refuse to relieve the destitute and aid the desperate, causing others to die of hunger and cold, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: these harmonious goods are the means by which Heaven and Earth enact benevolence, circulating and sustaining one another to prevent scarcity. Now, by hoarding and cutting off their flow, they prevent their universal distribution and become enemies of Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. Such wealth cannot be long retained and must circulate.\n\nHeaven generates people, endowing them with knowledge to love good and hate evil. Yet, though blessed with understanding, they recognize Heaven’s Dao yet scorn it, refusing to study earnestly to save themselves. Though they may attain long life, inheriting the celestial mandate and their ancestors’ bodies, they instead treat themselves lightly, neglecting study, and regard death as sudden. Only at death do they lament their grievances—this crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations, leaving life in ignorance and becoming enemies of Heaven. The reason is this: Heaven itself strives to practice the Dao, thus it is ever auspicious; to lose the Dao is to invite misfortune and death. Though Heaven loves people and delights in goodness, imprinting the Dao upon their bodies, people refuse to practice it earnestly. They are called people without the Dao, and Heaven has no means to grant them the Dao and longevity. Instead, they sever Heaven’s Dao and become its enemies.\n\nWhen people are born knowing virtue and goodness yet refuse to study earnestly to cultivate virtue, instead scorning virtue and nurturing evil, treating themselves lightly and acting wrongly, their crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: they act contrary to Earth. Earth delights in virtue and nurtures, yet these people neglect such matters, taking no joy in virtue. They love their ancestors’ bodies yet become enemies of Earth.\n\nHeaven generates people, fortunately endowing each with strength and ability to clothe and feed themselves. Yet they refuse to exert themselves, instead suffering hunger and cold, betraying their ancestors’ bodies, and treating their own strength lightly. Though they could obtain clothing and food through effort, they constantly lament their poverty and hunger, relying solely on the wealthy, depending on them to survive—this crime cannot be absolved. Some incur punishment in their own bodies, while others pass it to future generations. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth generate all goods to nurture people, and each should gather according to their strength, taking enough to avoid scarcity. Instead, they idle and neglect their strength, treating themselves lightly. Or, in their demands, they act without harmony, forcibly taking others’ goods, becoming enemies of the harmonious mean. Their crime clearly merits death.\n\nThese are the six great crimes, which Heaven abhors. Their crimes cannot be absolved.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI wish to ask, Heavenly Master, which of these crimes is the gravest?\n\nAh, how your words reveal your ignorance! Why do you ask?\n\nThese are crimes that extinguish entire families. How can you speak of their gravity?\n\nThis foolish one is deeply perplexed and does not grasp the essential meaning.\n\nNow, let the Heavenly Master further elucidate, that I may fully awaken, deeply understand the intent, and never again transgress.\n\nIndeed, Perfected One, your words are excellent. My discourse shall now be revealed, and you should follow closely and record it earnestly.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now. At present, August Heaven possesses the Dao and employs it to generate all things, the teeming multitude, all of whom depend on its mandate. Yet great Daoist masters, though they may silently comprehend it deeply, store it within their bellies and refuse to teach others earnestly. Teaching people the Dao is like giving fire to others. Few may come to take it, yet it does not diminish the source. Even if an infinite number come to take it, it does not diminish the source. Now, we are fortunate to share it, to teach the people of the world, to assist Heaven in generating beings, to assist Earth in nurturing forms, and to assist the Emperor in rectifying governance. Moreover, let each embrace the Dao, seeking life and hating death, enabling them to govern and assist others in governance. Let them no longer violate the law or act with wickedness and malice. With their hearts made good, they will assist Heaven, Earth, and the Emperor, nurturing the twelve thousand things, each delighting in long life. Let people harbor benevolent hearts and no longer lightly harm the myriad things. Then Heaven will be greatly pleased, Earth will be greatly joyful, and the Emperor will be greatly delighted, free from sorrow. Is not the merit thus accumulated vast indeed?",

      "translated_text": "When one person teaches and transforms, it is as if enlightening a hundred foolish ones. When a hundred people all return, each teaching ten thousand, and those ten thousand all teach, they will have transformed a hundred million people. When a hundred million all teach, the teaching becomes boundless. This supreme goodness harmonizes with Heaven’s heart above and penetrates the infinite below, so that the people all delight in life and in doing good. If the Emperor wanders without duty, what harm does it bring to others that he does not strive to instruct and admonish them?\n\nNow, people are fortunate to have received the admonitions of former masters, deeply embracing the supreme Dao and sealing it away, yet they do not teach and instruct others. This leaves people with nowhere to turn for refuge, causing them all to die unjustly with grievances unresolved—such is called severing the Dao of Heaven. Many lose the Dao and act recklessly, so that Heaven cannot grant them long life, nor Earth long nurturance. Indeed, people cannot be without the Dao. The petty man, lacking the Dao, often demeans himself, joining in rebellion, violating the patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth, rising as bandits and thieves, harming one another, transgressing the king’s laws, and causing the noble man deep sorrow. The chaos becomes unmanageable, and the king worries day and night, grieving and distressed, causing Heaven and Earth to lose their proper order. Disasters and anomalies arise without end, leaving a burden for the Emperor. I have not yet spoken exhaustively—severing the Dao of Heaven is a grave and treasonous offense, its transgressions too numerous to record. Thus, I have merely outlined its essentials to show the Perfected One the gravity of right and wrong, and whether such a crime warrants death. Even in death, its excesses remain, flowing into future generations. How lamentable! Perfected One, be cautious indeed.\n\nOnly the Perfected One knows this truth, and thus may be said to have attained enduring fortune, far from harm. Indeed, indeed. I dare not depart from the admonitions. Yet you are already wise and enlightened, understanding the Mandate of Heaven. You will surely live and depart from death, no longer doubting.\n\nNow, I humbly report the Mandate of Heaven’s Dao and wish to know the admonitions of Earth’s virtue. The great virtue of Earth lies in its steadfast compliance with Heaven’s Dao, its love for nurturing the myriad things, so that all beings, great and small, receive its grace and are raised to completion. Therefore, those of great virtue and great power should model their conduct after this. Fortunate to have received the merit and effort of former masters, they embrace and conceal the boundless virtue of the good Dao.\n\nVirtue, when used to teach others, is like standing before a great river and drinking from it. If few come to learn virtue, it does not harm its source; if boundless numbers come to learn virtue, it still does not harm its source. Strive to teach and instruct, so that all ordinary people know to uphold greatness and embrace virtue, each cherishing and nurturing their own body. The good among them may assist Heaven in nurturing and growing things above, and assist Earth in rearing and maturing things below, all joining forces with a single heart, free of malice.\n\nAmong them, those of great wisdom and easily enlightened minds may be transformed and elevated to assist the ruler. Those of moderate virtue may serve as officials and teachers, while even the least knowledgeable may still become teachers among the common people. All people will delight in the transformation of virtue and do good. Such teaching benefits Heaven above and Earth below, forming the root of great transformation and assisting the Emperor in nurturing the people, preventing them from committing evil or wickedness. The noble man may govern with ease, free from worry, and his merit will be manifest and great. Heaven and Earth will cherish him, and he may be promoted in office.\n\nYet now, some possess vast virtue but instead feign ignorance and obstruct the path of the Dao, failing to assist Heaven in nurturing what is nascent, failing to assist Earth in maturing what is developing, and failing to assist the Emperor in harmonizing the people. They leave later generations ignorant and benighted, unable to distinguish black from white, persisting in death without change, becoming petty men who cannot move east or west. They recklessly demean themselves, following one another in wrongdoing, accumulating deceit and treachery. Above and below, they can no longer teach one another, stumbling in darkness and confusion, without restraint or taboo. They violate the patterns of Heaven above and the forms of Earth below, their conduct opposing the four seasons and disrupting the five phases. This causes the noble man great sorrow and incites harm among petty men, leading to banditry and theft, sometimes even self-destruction, bringing disgrace upon their parents and cutting off their lineage.\n\nNow, I have merely outlined the essentials for the Perfected One, revealing the beginning so that the multitude may awaken and spur themselves on. Yet they refuse to teach the enduring virtue—this is called severing Earth’s nurturing Dao, and its transgressions are as grave as this. Such conduct is formless, and even in death, its excesses remain, flowing into future generations. Does the Perfected One understand? How lamentable! How lamentable!",

Then Heaven will be greatly pleased, Earth will be greatly joyful, and the Emperor will be greatly delighted, free from sorrow. Is not the merit thus accumulated vast indeed?",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One understands early—this may yet be called gaining life. Be ever vigilant. Indeed, indeed.\n\nI have reverently received the prohibitions of the Dao and virtue, and now wish to hear of the conduct of the benevolent.\n\nNow, all things of value that Heaven and Earth produce are bestowed upon humanity, rootless and unattached—neither clinging to Heaven above nor to Earth below. These things arise from the harmony of the central qi, meant to circulate freely, floating and flowing to fulfill their office: aiding the destitute and relieving the urgent.\n\nThose who hoard gold, silver, and precious goods—households of vast wealth, with tens of millions or more—let their stores rot and decay. Yet if the wise and discerning distribute them, bestowing upon the poor with joy, this is called benevolence alone. It aids Earth in nurturing forms and assists the Emperor in preserving the good and reverent among the people.\n\nA household of tens of millions can sustain ten thousand families, giving of the old and receiving the new. Let there be no hasty desire for profit, and virtue will harmonize with Heaven and Earth, its fame spreading to distant lands. Thus, one may always obtain new goods while the decaying ones are removed.\n\nAmong them, the greatest worthies daily report their deeds to the Emperor. The lesser worthies raise them up in their villages. As for the most foolish—those who fail to repay kindness—there are scarcely twelve or thirteen in ten. How could this impoverish anyone?\n\nWhen good deeds never cease, the great worthies and enlightened ones raise them up, their names resounding throughout the land. Travelers from the four seas fill the roads to follow their Way. When the enlightened king and sagely lord hear of them, seeing how they aid in nurturing the people, they rejoice greatly. Thus, they summon them, raising them to the highest ranks, and through this, they attain honor and nobility. Their legacy endures without end, becoming the greatest of benevolence—rare under Heaven. Above, they do not betray their ancestors; below, they do not betray their descendants. Heaven cherishes them, the hundred spirits benefit them, and the Emperor treats them as a radiant friend. Neighbors regard them as parents. Their merit is inscribed in Heaven and Earth, never to depart; their emoluments are fixed in office, never to diminish; their names are recorded among the people, never to fade.\n\nHow can one not practice benevolence?\n\nYet some chance upon fertile lands, obtaining the wealth of Heaven and Earth’s central harmony, amassing countless treasures—gold, silver, and precious goods in the tens of millions. Instead of sharing, they seal and hide them in dark chambers, letting all rot. When the destitute come seeking aid, they curse and refuse. Even when they grant something, they do not do so readily but demand repayment with interest—sometimes doubling, sometimes quintupling. They bestow upon the rich and cut off the poor, letting them starve and freeze to death, mocking them without reason.\n\nThey incur Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s blame, and become the greatest enemies of humanity. The hundred spirits despise them.\n\nWhy is this? These goods arise from the harmony of Heaven and Earth, meant to nourish all people. Such households merely encounter their gathering place—like rats in a granary, always sated alone. Yet the grain of the great storehouse was never meant for the rats alone. The wealth of the treasury was never meant for one person. Those in need should all draw from it.\n\nFools, lacking understanding, believe they will possess it forever, unaware that it is the accumulation of ten thousand corpses, all meant to find clothing and food therein. Their love turns to irrational anger and joy, refusing to exert themselves to aid the destitute and relieve the urgent. They let ten thousand households perish—unable to plant in spring or harvest in autumn. Their grievances rise in a clamor to Heaven, moving it to sorrow and Earth to tremble.\n\nThose who do not aid the noble in relieving the destitute are the greatest of the unbenevolent between Heaven and Earth. Even when beseeched for offerings to the spirits, they refuse. The hundred spirits loathe them. They wish to cut off their lineage, and their villages curse them to die. When bandits hear of them, they gather forces to rush their gates, besieging their households until they are impoverished and near death. Yet still, they refuse to give, instead burying their wealth deep in the earth, hiding it from sight. They recklessly cut off the world’s resources, depriving the land of its use, and instead strengthen the underworld. Heaven abhors them; Earth ails from them, deeming them a great calamity.\n\nThe goods of central harmony dwindle day by day, and thus, they sit in want. The starving and freezing grow ever more numerous, becoming their greatest enemies.\n\nNow, Heaven delights in the Dao, Earth delights in virtue, and central harmony delights in benevolence. All things are meant to reside between Heaven and Earth, circulating to provide for all. Yet when people lack, these goods are buried instead, sick and stifled, unable to emerge and be seen.\n\nHeaven and Earth never desired wealth for themselves. Heaven delights in human life; Earth delights in human nurturance. Ignorant petty men obstruct the wealth of Heaven and Earth’s central harmony, preventing its circulation and sufficiency. They kill what Heaven has given life and harm what Earth has nurtured. They recklessly bury and hide this wealth, impoverishing the state, depleting its resources, and failing to save the lives of its people. They leave virtuous rulers to govern in emptiness.\n\nGold, silver, precious goods, and wealth are created through human labor, truly arduous. They should serve the state’s needs, yet they are cast aside without reason, removed from above and below. Earth does not delight in possessing them, deeming them a great affliction, a great burden.\n\nNow, the unbenevolence of fools is so grave—should they not die for such sins?\n\nAmong them, there are those who, suddenly insatiable, contend in lawsuits, wronging themselves to seize the wealth of the weak and small, never knowing restraint.\n\nI have merely shown the Perfected One the essentials, revealing the beginning. The transgressions of the greatly unbenevolent are too numerous to record, making wealth and resources difficult to manage. The Perfected One should ponder this deeply.\n\nThus, the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and central harmony despise them. Even in death, their sins remain, destined to flow into future generations. Perfected One, do you now awaken to this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nHow lamentable! I do not wish to hear more.\n\nIf the Perfected One leaves behind such words, Heaven will surely take your life, that you may awaken and repent. Then, perhaps, you may yet live.",

Heaven possesses the Dao and delights in sharing it with people; Earth possesses virtue and delights in bestowing it upon them; central harmony possesses wealth and delights in nurturing them. Thus, people naturally seek the true Dao. If the Perfected One persists without cease, it is as though consulting with the spirits, daily singing of goodness, and goodness will naturally return to them. By serving the multitude of the worthy, they will collectively instruct and guide, and the path will no longer be distant. This allows one to preserve their body, not betray the legacy of their ancestors, while others meet early deaths, and only they fulfill their natural lifespan. While others are called evil, they alone are deemed good. As a teacher to the multitude, their name spreads to distant lands, inwardly embracing the true Dao, virtue, and benevolence. They aid Heaven in generating life, assist Earth in nurturing forms, and support the emperor in transforming the people. The highest teachers can transform boundless numbers, ensuring even the foolish abide by the Dao and commit no wrongs. Middle teachers can transform ten thousand, and lesser teachers can transform hundreds or thousands, bringing benefit to the sovereign by making the petty-minded aware of prohibitions and preventing them from committing hidden evils. Such teachers gain office without betraying their ancestors or shaming their descendants. Given such learning, how can one not pursue it?\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity all regarded exhorting people to study as their greatest concern, aiding Heaven and Earth in generation and completion, and assisting the emperor in governing disorder. This is the highest praise for the good between Heaven and Earth. Yet some fools, though born with the desire for knowledge, refuse to diligently study the true Dao. Instead, they delight in superficial splendor, acting to deceive others—cheating their parents as children, their ruler as subjects, and their superiors as inferiors. This is called deceiving Heaven, and their sins cannot be erased. Others indulge in worldly affairs and strife, following one another in wrongdoing. When they see the followers of the Perfected One, they mock them, saying, \"What is the use of study?\" Thus, they remain in darkness, their ignorance profound. They crave dominance yet cannot achieve it, recklessly claiming that Heaven and Earth are without measure and the worthy are without knowledge. They act wantonly, offending the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, their comings and goings without restraint. At home, they neglect their parents, gathering with the foolish to become wicked sons. When they serve as officials, they return to execute their parents, unable to reflect, and flee to become bandits, harming and killing without cease. This is precisely what Heaven abhors, Earth blames, the emperor grieves over, the hundred spirits detest, and parents despair of. This is the greatest calamity harming others, severing the lineage of their ancestors.\n\nIf one does not diligently study the true Dao and acts thus, in the eyes of the Perfected One, should they not die? Even in death, their sins remain, flowing to their descendants, who will still be called the lineage of evil men, the heirs of bandits. Will their wickedness not flow to future generations? Now, I have merely shown the Perfected One the beginning; their evils are too numerous to record, and their wealth and resources are difficult to manage. Perfected One, do you now awaken to this?\n\nBe vigilant, Perfected One.\n\nIndeed, indeed. How lamentable!\n\nYou know lamentation; you have already turned from evil.\n\nI have reverently heard these four matters and wish to hear what follows.\n\nNow, when Heaven gives birth to humanity, it endows them fully before sending them forth, ever delighting in their pursuit of the Dao and virtue. The benevolent, fortunate in their knowledge, can study virtue. Heaven and Earth nurture the myriad things with virtue, delighting in people emulating them. Thus, the virtuous of the great antiquity endured humiliation, emulating Earth’s nurturing of all things. When people learn this, their hearts are ever joyful, no longer delighting in harm. They act with caution, daily doing good, no longer desiring evil. Like attracts like, and their stature grows ever higher and more distant. Through long accumulation, they become people of abundant virtue, to whom all respond, and the multitude turns toward them. Persisting in reverent goodness without cease, they become great teachers of virtue. Their virtue aids Heaven in nurturing the living, assists Earth in fostering growth, and delights in aiding the enlightened king in transforming the people, making them reverent and no longer knowing wickedness. In small virtue, they may transform hundreds or thousands; in great virtue, they may transform ten thousand or more. Thus, they turn ten thousand into teachers of virtue, their transformations boundless. Persisting in virtue, all people rejoice. Heaven and Earth love them, extending their years; ghosts and spirits favor them, collectively aiding and protecting them. Those with merit become the virtuous officials of the ruler, delighting not in harming others. They rejoice in goodness, and what they seek is ever attained. They dwell in constant joy, with none desiring to harm them. This originates from learning to follow goodness and cultivate virtue, thus reaching such heights. Their names resound in distant lands, their merits recorded in Heaven and Earth, not betraying their ancestors or shaming their descendants.\n\nYet some, though fortunate in knowledge and discerning good from evil, instead belittle themselves, not diligently studying to cultivate goodness and virtue. They follow the ignorant and benighted in evil, delighting in the use of force and martial prowess, their words ever harsh. Their speech is perverse, seeking to subdue others. They claim superiority, yet others surpass them; they boast of strength, yet others are mightier. Thus, all things under Heaven have their limits and can be controlled. When a great fire arises, it seems uncontrollable, yet water extinguishes it. When people do evil and rage, they seem uncontrollable, yet prison subdues them. When speech seems unrestrained, illness humbles them. Thus, Heaven and Earth govern humanity, each with its own measure. Yet people, though possessing knowledge, refuse to study diligently and instead belittle themselves in wrongdoing. Their dwellings become inauspicious, and none love them.",

      "translated_text": "I have merely outlined its essentials, revealing only the beginning—the evils of failing to study extend far beyond this.\n\nWhen you receive my writings, reflect deeply upon them. \"Yes, yes.\" If truly grasped, retreat to a quiet place and examine them thoroughly. \"Indeed, so it is.\" To study without precision is no different from dreaming. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nHaving solemnly accepted my teachings, I wish to hear of the instruction that one with strength in life should follow. \"Very well. Heaven and Earth together give life to all creatures, even the crawling ones, endowing each with strength. They draw qi from the four seasons and emulate the Five Phases. Strength, by its nature, moves and acts; one should follow its course to secure clothing and food.\n\nThus, those who consistently exert their strength, working day and night without respite, ceaselessly accumulating—whether great or small, whatever they obtain, they cherish. All things possess their own spirit and naturally incline toward those who love them; when people cherish them, they come to them. It is like the Eastern Sea, which loves water and lies lowest, so all the waters of the world gather there, making it the sea.\n\nThe noble person who exerts strength without ceasing becomes a leader in amassing wealth, and their household grows prosperous, lacking nothing. Their ancestors receive fine offerings, their descendants enjoy abundance, and the entire family benefits. By exerting strength without pause, the destitute from all directions come to receive its fruits, and their foundation grows ever greater. By giving without end, they earn great praise from the multitude, their name spreads far, and their merit is recorded in Heaven and Earth.\n\nThey should use their strength to aid the destitute and relieve the desperate, assisting Heaven and Earth in cherishing all things and aiding the ruler in nurturing the people. By ceaselessly rescuing the poor and needy, Heaven extends their lifespan, and all spirits come to partake of their offerings—no one in their household is not joyful. Through such virtue, they may attain high office, honoring their ancestors and not disappointing their descendants.\n\nYet some, though possessing strength, take it lightly and do not treat it as a matter of consequence. Though they could attain wealth, they instead engage in disputes and recklessly commit inauspicious acts. Seeing their strength overpower others, they persist in such behavior, becoming great evildoers. Their households grow impoverished, and they turn to banditry. Hunger and cold assail them, and they cannot restrain themselves from wickedness. Among them, the most unworthy perish from starvation and cold.\n\nThose who wield strength to harm others, seeking what is not theirs and seizing what does not belong to them, repeatedly injuring others—such acts incur Heaven’s resentment, Earth’s blame, and the enmity of the noble. The Emperor grows sorrowful. If they persist without cease, all spirits despise them, and blessings no longer favor them. Heaven refuses to cover them, Earth refuses to bear them; calamities arise daily. They die by the roadside or languish in prison, their parents are disgraced, misfortune befalls their wives and children, and their six relations and neighbors all wish them dead. Yet their sins remain, flowing into future generations, leaving them as beggars’ descendants or thieves’ offspring—a great stain upon posterity.\n\nPerfected One, their transgressions and punishments are thus. Would not death itself be too lenient for their excess of sins? When I hear the Heavenly Master speak of such matters, my heart trembles with shock and aches with sorrow, fearing I may never recover. Perfected One, if you understand this heartache, you will soon live rightly. But if you do not suddenly awaken fully, your death will come soon.\n\nBe vigilant. My words must not be violated; those who violate them will perish—not by my hand, but by the consequences of their own actions. Do you understand? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI have expounded these six matters, yet they are but a fraction of the whole. You who have received my Dao should ponder deeply and plan far ahead. Do not carelessly take things lightly or fail to show compassion in doing good. In cultivating strength and learning, consider whether your actions are virtuous or wicked—for the latter will only bring you low.\n\nEach must consider their own fate. Within these teachings lie six paths to death and six great virtues. Emulate the virtues, and you will surely attain goodness; take goodness lightly and act wickedly, and misfortune will come daily.\n\nYou must spur yourself on and reflect, for there is no joy in self-indulgence. Be cautious and ponder deeply. Meditate upon this, and the heart of the wise and enlightened will surely open.\n\nVirtue, benevolence, and goodness are entrusted to those of moral character, while wickedness is left to those who do not reflect deeply—this is the established pattern. If all could emulate the principles in my writings to correct themselves, the world would have no more evil people.\n\nThis is the primordial Dao of the Highest Antiquity from the Heavenly Caverns, capable of transforming people. Once they know it, all become good and do not revert to wickedness. The superior person delights in life and may study the true Dao; the profoundly wise may cultivate its virtue; the benevolent may practice its kindness; the knowledgeable may develop its wisdom; the capable may refine their abilities; and the strong may harness their strength.\n\nIf one can fully apply these teachings, reflecting upon them thoroughly, they will distance themselves from misfortune. Heaven and Earth will cherish them, the six directions will nurture them, and the Emperor will have no further concerns—thus they may govern with ease. Perfected One, do you understand? \"Great joy has come! I am overjoyed. You may indeed be called one who delights in goodness and understands it.\"\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity taught without ceasing, for they saw the clear prohibitions of Heaven and considered their own fate. Therefore, the teachings of the sages and worthies filled the world. Have you alone not realized this? \"Excellent! Excellent!\"\n\nThus, the sages, worthies, and superior persons of antiquity all studied diligently, exerting themselves day and night without pause, for they too saw the clear commands of Heaven and Earth. They dared not take things lightly or act wrongly, nor did they dare to be careless in their studies. Thus, they enjoyed long-lasting fortune and no harm. These worthies and extraordinary individuals were originally no different, but through diligent study, they attained such heights.\n\nThe wicked among them all arose from a failure to study diligently, from taking things lightly and carelessly.

      "translated_text": "Alas! Why do you still not awaken?\n\nSeeing the Heavenly Master speak repeatedly, you remain confused and do not know yourself—what is awakening, and what is not awakening? Now, let me make you understand and act upon this.\n\nBefore the Perfected One, consider this: Heaven’s methods of governance transform people toward goodness, from the highest to the lowest—how many such methods are there? Though the methods are myriad and each bears a different intent, the Perfected One still upholds rectitude in this manner. The common people, however, are difficult to awaken, for their delusion has lasted long. If there is fault, it lies only with the Heavenly Master.\n\nYet in assisting the Emperor and kings in governance, there are, in general, ten methods:\n\nFirst, governance by primordial *qi*;\nsecond, governance by spontaneity;\nthird, governance by the Dao;\nfourth, governance by virtue;\nfifth, governance by benevolence;\nsixth, governance by righteousness;\nseventh, governance by ritual;\neighth, governance by culture;\nninth, governance by law;\ntenth, governance by military force.\n\nThese ten are the completion—why? All things begin with primordial *qi* and end with the military. The military involves cutting and punishment, and thus it is the lowest. Therefore, things arise in the Great Mystery, mature in the Great Yang, and die in the White Tiger. Thus, primordial *qi* resides in the north, while the White Tiger dwells in the west—this is what is meant.\n\nThus, Heaven employs governance by primordial *qi*, using the winds to nurture all things. Earth employs governance by spontaneity, so that following goodness yields goodness, and following evil yields evil. Humanity, in turn, follows the harmony of Heaven and Earth, employing governance by the Dao, taking the active Dao as its guide, so that all affairs flow and circulate.\n\nThese three methods correspond to the omens of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Beyond these three, virtue and benevolence serve as mere chapters and verses. Below benevolence, much harm is done, and intent becomes difficult to realize.\n\nThus, my Dao constantly delights in the original nature of Heaven’s precepts, while the intermediate nature of the yet-unformed Heaven is discarded. In the generation of all things, the root is the constant principle; they reach completion in the middle and descend into chaos at the end. Those who lose order and fall into chaos cannot be restored to principle. Therefore, one must begin with the highest origin.\n\nThus, Heaven constantly guards its root, Earth guards its single revolution in the middle, and humanity guards its three revolutions below—hence the reckoning of disorder in the Dao.\n\nPerfected One, have you now clearly understood this? \"Yes, yes.\"",

      "translated_text": "Should you now harbor doubts? To follow a master is to speak without daring to doubt.\n\nPerfected One, when Heaven aids the emperor and king, by what is this made manifest? When it benefits ministers and people, by what is this proven?\n\nMaster, I now dare not ask further—my many words have missed the mark, and my errors have multiplied, so I no longer presume to speak.\n\nGo forth, then.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, when Heaven aids the emperor and king, I shall grant him wondrous scriptures, which may be employed to govern. Their application surpasses all bounds, harmonizing with yin and yang, and shall benefit lesser ministers. I shall grant him worthy officials to benefit the people, enabling them to bear virtuous children.\n\nPerfected One, is this so? Is there yet more extraordinary discourse?\n\nIt is the utmost.\n\nWhen Heaven desires to exalt a ruler of virtue, it is for the sake of bearing divine sages, that they may transmit the discourse of Heaven and Earth and comprehend their intent. Thus, Perfected One, you have come to study this.\n\nIt is fitting to entrust this to the most prudent and virtuous among the people, to awaken their hearts and prompt their reflection. Present it to a ruler of great virtue, that he may display it to the assembled worthies, ensuring all grasp its meaning and convey it to the common folk. When the common folk receive it, fifteen will follow as one, deliberating and governing together, rectifying all that is unjust—not for the sake of Heaven, Earth, or the ruler alone.\n\nYet the root of transgression lies in the long-lived among men. The long-lived, having gained authority, incur grave responsibility before the August Heaven and Earth—all borne by one person. When those who first attain the true Dao do not strive to transform and teach others; when those who first know virtue do not exert themselves to transform others; when the wealthy, amassing riches, refuse to practice benevolence with vigor; when men, though capable of learning, do not strive to seek the true Dao to attain longevity; when those capable of cultivating virtue do not strive to refine themselves; when those with strength do not labor diligently but instead invite hardship—these are the six great transgressions.\n\nHeaven and humanity have long accumulated such faults. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, each generation has inherited and compounded the burdens of the past, and those born later suffer even more. When such transgressions amass, they coalesce into great harm, causing Heaven and Earth together to lose their rectitude. The emperor’s heart is long afflicted, and governance fails. Injustice persists, and Heaven grows deeply displeased.\n\nThus, I hasten to transmit the words of Heaven. From the most ancient times to the present, when Heaven and Earth suffer affliction, their qi stagnates and does not flow. Ordinary people cannot know this—only divine sages transmit these words. It is not I alone, Perfected One; do not find this strange.\n\nNow that I am about to depart this world, I may no longer appear freely among the people. Therefore, I transmit this scripture to you, Perfected One. Having departed the mundane, you may no longer serve as a teacher among the people. Thus, I charge you to seek out the most discerning and enlightened among the people and entrust this to them. Now, hasten to deliver it to a ruler of virtue. Should you dare to delay or withhold it, you shall be held accountable—how grave this would be!\n\nToday, Heaven seeks to alleviate suffering and bring peace to the emperor and king. Let the ruler of Dao and virtue make this plain to the assembled worthies, that they may transform the people. Let each reflect on their transgressions to dissolve the inherited burdens of their forebears. Let all people consider their own well-being and not grow negligent. Then Heaven shall rejoice greatly, and governance shall be established in harmony.\n\nShould you still harbor doubts, questioning the sincerity of my words, know that my scriptures are but a test of truth. Why is this so? Ancient texts number in the millions, yet governance has never achieved true peace. Now, even the wise and enlightened may doubt, dismissing these words as untrue.\n\nWithout testing a warrior, how can one know his strength? Without applying a text, how can one know its divine power? I have received the words of Heaven to test you, Perfected One. From this point forward, when you receive any scripture, you must put it to the test—do not again indulge in empty or deceptive speech. Heaven deeply resents this; Earth profoundly suffers it, regarding it as a grave malady, a true grievance of indignation.\n\nAs a result, the myriad things do not flourish, disasters and premature deaths abound, and none complete their allotted years. The emperor is distressed, officials and people are in turmoil, and order is no longer restored. The great fault lies in these six transgressions:\n\nThose who possess the Dao envy it and do not strive to teach the foolish; those who possess virtue envy it and do not strive to transform the foolish; those who hoard wealth envy it and do not practice generosity. Heaven births all people, intending them to offer their gifts to the world. Yet those with knowledge do not strive to learn the true Dao to their own fulfillment, and when taught, they mock it.

Those with strength do not labor diligently to enrich themselves and practice benevolence but instead grow idle and lazy.

Perfected One, do you now clearly understand this charge?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow that the divine person has expounded the laws of Heaven, why should it be confined to individuals alone? Should it not be disseminated among the people, ensuring proper order from above to below?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Today, the qi of Great Peace is about to descend from the highest heavens. All matters must follow its course—thus, the order from above to below. Without this order, there is only rebellious qi, and governance cannot be harmonious. Most disorders arise from disobedience to this flow.\n\nPerfected One, do you wish to add to this?\n\nI dare not. Thus, the order must be from above to below—do not ask further.\n\nYes, yes. Go forth, and take care in all matters for your own sake. These six great transgressions exist, and the Dao of Heaven is most severe—do not act recklessly. Heaven, dwelling above, watches over humanity.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI humbly request to ask one more question: when a person has attained the essential Dao and essential virtue, where should they place them?\n\nThey should present them to their ruler.\n\nWhy must they be presented to the ruler?\n\nThe essential Dao exists to bring peace to the ruler; when employed in governance, it gains the favor of Heaven.

      "translated_text": "Admonition to the Six Disciples, One Hundred and Fourth Formula\n\nAs my departure draws near, I leave you, the Six Disciples, with this single admonition.\n\nThe Dao is all-pervading—without above or below, without exterior or interior. Guard its harmonious qi, and you shall be called a Divine Child. Seek it near, and you shall greatly attain; seek it afar, and you shall lose it.\n\nThus, the ancient kings who governed well began within the depths of their own being. Truly employing the Dao, they found governance effortless. Their movements never strayed from the measures and numbers, and the myriad things ordered themselves. Near at heart, their influence spread to fill the Four Seas. The ancients called this the Essential Dao.\n\nGovern with joy, desiring no affairs. Take heed not to lose this, for it is the plumb line that rectifies the worthy.\n\nNow I earnestly repeat this to enlighten you: though you six have asked me about the scriptures day after day, and though the Dao branches into different paths, it remains one in essence. Yet the tongue, capable of encompassing the Six Directions, completes the kingly Dao, explaining the myriad things, each with its distinct meaning. Thus, Heaven and Earth attain great peace, and the kingly ruler remains without affairs.\n\nMy writings reveal the divine mind, penetrating the Six Directions. The Eight Directions submit of their own accord, all harboring good hearts, devoid of malice. Their essential knot resides within. It is like the heart of the myriad things dwelling within, while their branches reside without. When the inner flourishes, the outer flourishes; when the inner declines, the outer declines.\n\nTherefore, the ancient August Dao Emperors and Sages, wishing to rectify the all-pervading Six Distant Directions and Eight Sides, first rectified the inner. By rectifying the inner, the outer is rectified, resonating infinitely without fail. To rectify the outer in order to rectify the inner is to err ten thousandfold.\n\nThus, the great sages of old taught people to ponder deeply and plan far ahead, closing their nine apertures, resting their four agents, and returning to a state of primordial chaos. Like a ring without end, or a child in the womb without duties, only then can one grasp the principle.\n\nMy Dao takes this as its great essential, hence I repeatedly urge each to guard their root. When Heaven generates humans, it endows them with the true Dao through the tools of creation. Thus, the teacher opens and guides them; through learning, they may become all-knowing. If the gates of their senses remain unopened, though they receive the true Dao of Heaven, they shall know nothing. It is like a newborn placed in a chamber—without guidance and learning in affairs, nothing can be known.\n\nThe differences among people arise only from the varying customs of the Eight Directions, hence their knowledge and learning differ. If one person could learn, traveling throughout the inner and outer, they would know all.\n\nAs I prepare to depart for distant places, there may yet be those to whom I can transmit, but I cannot remain seated in constant ease, guarding all my disciples. You six must carefully study my writings from beginning to end, for they form a coherent structure. If you fail to grasp my intent, examine the ancient texts to clarify it.\n\nThe one who practices the Upper Dao is known as the Mysterious Perfected; the one who practices the Lower Dao is known as the Compliant Perfected; the one who practices the Eastern Dao is known as the Initial Perfected; the one who practices the Southern Dao is known as the Grand Perfected; the one who practices the Western Dao is known as the Lesser Perfected; the one who practices the Northern Dao is known as the Secluded Perfected.\n\nThe Dao is largely the same with minor differences, thus it can distinguish yin and yang without limit, transforming into the One Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Characters. Though the harmony of the myriad things is somewhat complete, it has yet to exhaust the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth, or penetrate the boundless without exterior or interior.\n\nTherefore, examine its absence, grasp its essentials, and observe its beginning, so that it may serve as a model to be recorded. Records of the past and present, though their essentials may seem disordered, are the same. What the divine and sagely record is like overlapping compasses and matching squares—though separated by billions upon billions of years, it is as if they speak face to face.\n\nThus, it may serve as the eternal canon of Heaven and Earth, as the divine Dao of yin and yang. Do not wonder at the repetition in my writings. I repeat because I fear something may be lost.\n\nMoreover, the Dao of Heaven is most strict. Having spoken, I dare not leave anything incomplete. Whether understood or not, an incomplete transmission is called a \"stumbling Dao,\" a grave transgression. I truly pity this, hence the repetition.\n\nIt is like the sages of the high antiquity, middle antiquity, and low antiquity—though born in different eras, their words follow one another, repeating and expounding, mutually verifying and clarifying. Thus, the Dao of Heaven may be fully known. This is the meaning.\n\nGo forth! I must hasten on my journey. Hold fast to the Heavenly Treasure with utmost care, and transmit it to the proper person.\n\n*Here ends the Admonition to the Six Disciples.*\n*Thus concludes the sixty-eighth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*\n*Here begins the sixty-ninth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace.*",

Let the Way be made level. Since you, Master, have permitted this questioning from Heaven, the matter must be pursued to its end; it cannot be abandoned midway.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"This humble one has observed that the teachings of the Heavenly Master are without limit or end. Thus, all disciples, awakened by Heaven, have come to know that the Heavenly Master’s wisdom penetrates deeply, comprehending the essence of Heaven and Earth, both inner and outer, in their yin and yang. Fearing that one day we may be parted from you, Master, with no one left to resolve our doubts, we dare—boldly and without restraint—to ask about the prognostication that can bring lasting peace to the state and family, allowing the lord of men to govern with hands folded in his sleeves, free from care.

      "translated_text": "\"Excellent indeed are the words of the Perfected Ones. Now I shall fully expound this for you—only compose yourselves, sit calmly, and ponder my words.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe eternal celestial prognostication and pattern decree that the south is firmly established as the ruler. Thus it is said: the south is where the ruler resides; fire rules in the south; the Great Yang rules in the south; the flourishing summer of the four seasons rules in the south; the stove of the Five Domestic Altars rules in the south; the heart of the Five Viscera rules in the south. The ruler, according to the pattern, ought to wear red, for this is the phase of fire. Therefore, when the ruler encounters anomalies, they invariably correspond with yang—never with any other phase. Yang is most radiant in the sun, which governs all and stands as the eldest. Thus the celestial prognostication always takes the sun as the omen for the ruler’s prosperity or decline. Do the Perfected Ones understand this?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed. We have come to understand it.\"\n\nThe pattern for a human ruler is ever to seek kinship with the benevolent and to govern with those who possess a heart. Those with whom one may govern together must ever practice the Dao and cherish life. Even the young and weak, or those ministers and worthy ones who are still maturing, the ruler ought to nurture—not harm. Thus the east cherishes life, while the south cherishes nurturance. Those who lack benevolence and act with intent cannot long endure, and those whose dealings are unclear cannot serve as rulers. Thus the east, being wood, embodies benevolence and heart, while the south, being fire, embodies clarity. The celestial pattern decrees that emperors and kings who govern must ever do so through the Dao and virtue. Thus the east represents the Dao, for the Dao governs generation, while the south represents virtue, for virtue governs nurturance—hence the south governs nurturance. Those who govern ought to emulate Heaven by civilizing through culture. Thus the east represents culture, for the dragon emerges bearing it, while the south represents refinement—hence rectitude becomes the pattern of culture. Refinement is great clarity, so culture arises in the east and becomes luminous in the south. Thus the celestial pattern is red, and red is fire. Benevolence and rulership move upward, and the sun ought to stand high and bright, serving as the model for humanity. Thus when wood and fire move, they invariably ascend—this is the image of the ruler. Therefore, dwelling in the east, one relies on benevolence to ascend, and thus those who govern ought to reside in the south. The east is Lesser Yang, the ruler’s beginning; thus the sun rises in the east. The south is Greater Yang, the ruler’s radiant flourishing. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family and parents, while Greater Yang is the ruler’s person and position. Lesser Yang is the ruler’s family, for wood is the parent of fire, and the ruler takes Lesser Yang as their family, while fire is called the child of wood.

      "translated_text": "The celestial prognostic patterns decree that though the Great Yang serves as the ruler, it paradoxically fears the Great Yin—the movement of Water. The purest and finest of waters is wine. Wine is the king of waters, its elder, the most excellent of all beverages, its qi aligned with the Kan position, governing theft and banditry by night. Thus, its name derives from \"indulgent abandon,\" for as the king and elder of waters, when Water reigns, the Great Yang wanes.\n\nPerfected One, if you wish to truly understand the veracity of celestial prognostics, observe this: from the highest antiquity through the middle ages, whenever rulers indulged in wine, none achieved great peace. Their governance turned to chaos, their officials engaged in constant strife, and bandits arose—this is the clear consequence. Therefore, when a virtuous sovereign governs in an era of Great Peace, the essence of Fire should shine brightly. One must not follow the Great Yin, allowing the power of Water to dominate and thereby suppress and harm the governance. Thus, wine must be prohibited.\n\nWould you hear of the method of prohibition? Which wine should be banned? Simply the wine sold in markets. Now, Master, what have you seen or witnessed that compels you to ban only market wine? Indeed, the market corresponds to the movement of Water. Thus, people and goods from all four directions flow and gather there. The rivers and seas, too, are the kings and elders of waters, for all streams and wealth likewise flow and converge there. Water, being the movement of the Dark Warrior of the north, is inherently greedy, plundering others' wealth. The market, where goods from the five directions flow and gather for profit, gives rise to bandits, rogues, and treacherous elements—all governed by Kan, the Water trigram.\n\nHeaven’s law operates through resonant correspondence by category. Thus, the market embodies the movement of Water. To indulge its wine is to amplify it further, once more crowning it as the king of waters. Market-dwellers, rejoicing in wine, also proclaim it king—this is a double reign of Water. The fault is sixfold: it suppresses the fiery qi of the Great Yang, causing the ruler’s governance to weaken and instead empowering treacherous ministers.",

I shall withhold nothing.\n\nBe seated in peace, and I shall distinguish and explain all for the Perfected Ones, expounding the essential meaning.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe celestial prognostication’s secret instructions state: when gold and jade rise to prominence, affairs are governed by them. When the martial departments flourish greatly, the Wood qi is cut off at its root, and Earth gains sovereignty. When Earth is greatly exalted, it is the palace of the Grand Empress. Its qi belongs to the northwest, and when the Great Yin attains great sovereignty, it gives rise to treacherous ministers who act within the inner palace, losing their proper path and surging forth. When Earth rules, Metal becomes its minister, and together they surge upward in succession. The qi of *ji* and *xin* both attain sovereign flourishing, surging and rising greatly. According to Heaven’s standard laws, this breeds many treacheries in the inner palace—yet this is not the fault of the inner palace. Rather, it is called a failure in governance to align with celestial prognostication, a loss of the great departmental boundaries, causing disasters to return and overturn one another. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, the cycles of celestial timing have not yet reached the point where the former masters could fully distinguish and explain the great departmental boundaries of Heaven. Thus, the emperor loses the governance of Heaven’s law, giving rise to these calamitous transformations.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, deeply understand this?\n\nVery well.\n\nThe celestial prognostication states: indulgence in wine belongs to the category of Water. The market is the movement of Water, the great gathering place of the human sovereign—yet to indulge in wine within the market is called \"Water and Wine as Great Sovereigns.\" When Water rules, the Fire qi diminishes; when Fire qi diminishes, it transforms into ashes; when it transforms into ashes, it changes into Earth, thus becoming Fire surrendering its qi to Earth. When Earth gains sovereignty and rises from the ground, it aligns with Metal and Water in the northwest. The Great Yin pertains to the people, yet ministers gain sovereignty instead. The inner palace gives birth to treacherous ministers, the qi of *ji* again takes action, and the inner palace commits transgressions, stirring and rising once more. The resulting disasters bring theft, and bandits never cease. All lies in the indulgence of Water, which injures the yang virtue.\n\nNow, the reason I distinguish and explain this for the Perfected One is that I see you have come to inquire with such earnest devotion, knowing that August Heaven desires to protect the virtuous lord. Therefore, I clearly expound for the Perfected One the great divisions of Heaven and Earth’s governance—what ought to be emulated, and what must no longer be transgressed.

Thus, when the qi of the north prevails, the qi of the south declines; when the qi of the south prevails, the qi of the north declines. Therefore, one must swiftly cease the reign of wine, to sever the decline of Water and Metal.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones clearly understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe cosmic patterning divides thus: Yang is Heaven, male, sovereign, father, elder, and teacher; Yin is Earth, female, minister, child, the people, and mother. Therefore, the southeast pertains to Yang, the northwest to Yin.\n\nIf the Perfected Ones wish to know the truth of celestial omens, observe this: since the opening of Heaven and Earth, whenever rulers have indulged in military force, allowed sovereigns to indulge in wine, or followed the counsel of women—when governance heavily favors their words and the sovereign yields to them—Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth, all belonging to the northwest, have prevailed. From such commands, disorder and calamity have always followed. But benevolence, wisdom, virtue, and enlightened sages all belong to the southeast, to Yang, to Heaven. From such counsel, order always follows.\n\nI wish to hear why the worthies and sages belong to the southeast.\nThe essence of Fire is the heart, and the heart is sagacity; the essence of Wood is benevolence, thus its symbol resides in the east. The southeast nurtures and fosters all things, and the worthies and sages, in their gentle clarity, likewise nurture all things without harm. Thus, the nature of sages and worthies is gentle and luminous, all benevolent and bright: benevolence resembles Wood, brightness resembles Fire—therefore, they all reside in the southeast.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the words of the Heavenly Master, I have gained great understanding.\n\nMoreover, in the laws of celestial omens, the southeast is the guiding net of Heaven’s Dipper; wherever the Dipper’s handle points, the four seasons turn, and the mandate is received in kingship. The northwest belongs to Earth, struck by the Dipper’s bowl—there, qi is cut off and extinguished. Thus, when Lesser Yin, Greater Yin, and Earth prevail and overcome Yang, it is called “reversing Heaven and Earth,” and disorder often results.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones understand this?\nIndeed, indeed.",

But do the myriad common folk and all things also have their own correspondences?\n\nExcellent is your question—you have glimpsed the essentials of the great Dao.\n\nIn truth, these pairings are all of the same nature.\n\nThe Five Phases: at their apex are the emperors and kings; next are the ministers; then the subtle qi. The king occupies the position of emperor; the minister, the position of great official; the subtle qi, the position of petty officer. After the king comes the aged qi—this is the position of feudal lords. After the aged qi comes the declining qi—this is the position of the imperial clan. After the declining qi comes the ailing qi—this is the sign of the imperial clan’s transgressions and loss of succession. After the ailing qi comes the imprisoned qi—this is the sign of the common folk and the myriad people. After the imprisoned qi comes the dead qi—this is the sign of slaves and servants. After the dead qi comes the vanished qi—this is the sign of the dead in their tombs.\n\nThus Heaven displays its signs: the four seasons and Five Phases circulate in ceaseless flow, each rising and declining in turn. The people and the myriad things all follow the law of Heaven’s signs, likewise rising and declining.\n\nTherefore the myriad common folk are all descendants of the hundred kings.

May I hear of this?\n\nExcellent! How your mastery grows day by day.\n\nIndeed, my Way and its methods emerge to regulate the yang and enter to regulate the yin; emerge to regulate conduct and enter to regulate the spirit; emerge to regulate the multitude of texts and enter to regulate the multitude of diagrams; emerge to dispel disasters and enter to rectify the self; emerge to regulate the learning of the court and internally regulate the chamber of seclusion.\n\nIn all matters, set limits. Those who strive diligently in learning, each according to their capacity, yet deviate from the constant method—externally, their learning leads them into superficiality, unable to restrain themselves; internally, their learning fails to align with the proper path, turning instead toward great deviation.\n\nScholars invariably suffer from a grave flaw: they cannot recognize it themselves.\n\nThose who favor external learning and whose talent exceeds the norm often fall into superficiality, causing the Way to become greatly deviant. Lacking proper texts, they falsely claim it as the true Way and deceive others with their requests.\n\nThose who favor internal learning and whose talent exceeds the norm often plunge into great deviation, believing they have attained it. Refusing to speak with others, they lose the proper measure and transmit reckless words.\n\nNow you harbor doubts, so you have come to ask again. Your intent is earnest and unwavering, free from carelessness. I shall establish rules and limits for you, so each may have boundaries to observe.\n\nAncient and modern texts are too numerous to count. In all learning, those who delight in truth must not deviate from the root.\n\nThose who learn from a master’s oral instructions must not deviate from the master’s words—this is the great essential.\n\nThe greatest harm in learning lies here: when external studies align with superficial chapters and phrases, they become shallow and lead to reckless speech.\n\nWhen internal texts align with apocryphal diagrams, one cannot deeply grasp their essential meaning and instead speaks in error.\n\nThose who study longevity yet emerge to align with superficiality deceive others.\n\nThose who align internally yet fail to grasp the essential meaning fall into great deviation.\n\nNow you return to ask repeatedly, so I shall expound these texts for you, revealing their limits. What aligns with the proper measure is correct; what does not is wrong. This is clear.\n\nFrom this, you may understand: all scriptures are the discourse of Heaven. When ten correspond with ten, it is correct. When ten correspond with nine, it is a minor deviation. When ten correspond with eight, it is a minor disorder. Beyond this, it is not the true Way and cannot be used. It is called \"disordering the celestial patterns and earthly principles,\" displeasing yin and yang, causing the myriad things to struggle and the people to suffer great misfortune.\n\nThe method of nurturing one’s nature is to internally perceive one’s form and countenance clearly—this is correct. To externally perceive the spirits of the myriad things is wrong.\n\nIn learning all matters, one must constantly uphold the root text and seek the multitude of worthies to explain and settle it—this is correct. To cling to the multitude of chapters and phrases while forgetting the root is wrong, losing the intent of the Way of Heaven.\n\nTo transform one’s body into a spirit is correct. To lack the Way yet fail to become a spirit, yet claim to command spirits, is wrong—it is merely a technique of driving others through texts.\n\nTo explain all matters such that root, branch, and center resemble one another is correct. What does not resemble is wrong.\n\nTo enter seclusion and initially eat little, gradually consuming qi until it dissolves and disappears—this is correct. To seek the Way, claim attainment, and not return, yet answer questions, is wrong.\n\nAll who depart must return. Those who teach and answer questions are correct. Those who do not teach or answer, yet tolerate death, are wrong.\n\nTo maintain purity and stillness in a secluded chamber and succeed is correct. To claim attainment of the Way yet speak in anger is wrong—such a one has lost their essence.\n\nTo enter learning and daily improve, surpassing one’s former state, is the correctness of attaining the Way. To enter learning yet daily worsen, lacking loyalty and trust, is wrong—one has fallen into great deviation.\n\nTo read texts and grasp their meaning, then uphold the master’s instructions to seek explanations, is correct. To read texts without a master’s instructions, yet claim deep and solitary understanding, is wrong—one has lost the great intent of the Way.\n\nTo have attained the Way yet steadfastly serve the multitude of masters and worthies without slackening is correct—this is the path of daily progress.\n\nThus the ancient sages, having attained the Way, naturally served their masters without ceasing. After leaving their masters, they read the texts without slackening. To learn yet claim solitary attainment of the essential meaning, no longer diligently reading the ancient texts and sagely words, and claim not to serve the multitude of sages—this is wrong. Such a one is a fool.\n\nIn all learning, to exhaustively investigate what may be sought is correct. All things are thus: once born, to fulfill their lifespan and bear fruit is correct. To merely be born yet fail to fulfill their lifespan, lacking trustworthiness, is wrong.\n\nTo do good and attain its proper fruit is correct. To fail to attain its proper fruit, appearing correct externally yet wrong internally, is wrong.\n\nTo thoroughly study my texts without departing from the guiding line and attain their truth is correct. To read texts and display cleverness, possessing great talent yet failing to grasp their essential truth, is wrong.\n\nHeaven has wind and rain, and the myriad things are born in season—this is correct. When wind and rain harm the myriad things, it is wrong—it is poisonous.\n\nFor the scriptural Way to daily flourish is correct. To not daily progress but instead daily decline is wrong—one has lost the internal intent.\n\nThus the nature of Heaven and Earth is to do good. If it does not immediately manifest in one’s person, it flows to later generations to illuminate one’s conduct.\n\nTo do evil also does not immediately cease in one’s person but must flow to later generations, likewise revealing one’s conduct through error.\n\nTherefore, the good and evil one does will inevitably be seen.",

Such is the natural nature of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang.\n\nHeaven gives life to the myriad things, each manifesting according to its conduct, revealed without concealment. Thus, the good ascend in their deeds, their fate belonging to Heaven, just as the living belong to Heaven. The evil descend in their deeds, their fate belonging to Earth, just as the dead—being impure—return below to the Yellow Springs. This is what is meant.\n\nThose who obtain my scripture must entrust it to a ruler of supreme virtue. I possess this scripture and dare not obstruct or withhold its transmission and study.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven governs Heaven, yet it cannot be fully known; one must not heed the words of a single person alone. Therefore, I have now established the writings of the ancient sages for you, once more distilling their essential concordance. The scripture’s beginning and end mutually confirm one another, serving as proof.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, though the worthy and sagely have lived in different ages, separated by vast spans of time, what they detested was the same. Together they spoke for Heaven, remedying the world’s gains and losses. Their words resemble one another like overlapping compasses or aligned squares—turning to mutually illuminate, unavoidably so.\n\nFor things of the same kind gather and arise together; their principles all summon one another through likeness and resemblance. This is clear evidence. What was lost in the past is regained in the future, and by examining similarities and differences, the text is completed.\n\nAdhering to antiquity to clarify the present, discussing matters collectively to compose the inner text, and using the outer text to elucidate the inner—then returning to verify the inner text through the outer—ensures it may be transmitted for ten thousand generations without compounding Heaven’s transgressions.\n\nThe words of one person cannot be followed alone. The words of many, deeply weighed and drawn from the sayings of ancient worthies and sages, inwardly align with Heaven. Together they are settled and established.\n\nIf the emperor daily clarifies the decisive principles, all confusion, disorder, disasters, and evils will be eliminated. Heaven will have no repeated sorrows; those who work together will prosper, while those who resist will find their misfortunes unremoved.\n\nHere ends the decisive teachings on the scholar’s gains and losses.\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Seventy Concludes\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll Seventy-One Begins\n*True Dao: Nine Essentials on Gains and Losses*, First Section of the One Hundred Seventh Text\n\nThe Perfected One bows twice and asks to inquire of one matter.

      "translated_text": "Here the Celestial Master bestows the qi of Great Peace to transmit the Dao and its virtue, thereby establishing the supreme emperor. Above, there is a ruler who delights in the Dao and virtue; below, even the foolish and lowly common folk are reached. Its grace pervades the six directions, harmonizes the eight extremities, and encompasses all without exception.\n\nNow, worthy disciple, you have received the Master’s literary teachings and pondered them to attain the Dao. What marks its ultimate height above, and what defines its utmost depth below?\n\nExcellent indeed is the Perfected One’s question—how subtle and essential! Do you wish to hear of its profoundest extremes and know the spirits’ advance and retreat?\n\nTruly, I am dull and benighted; my understanding falls short. Only the enlightened Master may record and reveal it.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe Dao has nine degrees, each distinguished by its own name. Now I shall fully expound their meaning for the Perfected One. Follow along and record it, ensuring nothing is lost.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nFirst is the Primal Qi of Non-Action. Second is Serene Emptiness and Nothingness. Third is Numerical Measurement and Distinction. Fourth is the Spirit’s Journey Forth and Return. Fifth is the Great Dao’s Spirit, akin to the Four Seasons and Five Phases. Sixth is Piercing Joy. Seventh is Community Counsel. Eighth is Overflowing Spirit. Ninth is Ancestral Spirits.\n\nEach of these nine is further divided into nine, yielding eighty-one sections, each with distinct principles and secret applications. Together, they form one great root, with spirit as its agent and humanity as its gateway.\n\nNow I shall arrange them for you in ordered teachings. It is impossible to record them all in advance. Reflect upon their meaning: the upper three nines—twenty-seven in total—can transcend the world. The central three nines—another twenty-seven—can summon true spirit officials. The lower three nines—twenty-seven more—abound in heterodoxy. Their spirits and essences cannot be constantly employed, causing people to become confused and disoriented. Among them, those of impure essence often err and speak falsely, as if losing their qi.\n\nNow, this humble student, upon hearing the Master’s words, is dazzled and knows not east from west. I pray you distinguish and explain it for this dull disciple.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe first, the Primal Qi of Non-Action, is to contemplate one’s body without acting in the slightest. Simply envision it as radiantly pure, like qi released without form. Constantly take this as your method. Once perfected, there is nothing you cannot do and nothing you do not know. Thus, when one lacks the Dao, they remain merely human. With the Dao attained, they transform into divine immortals, their spirits ascending to Heaven, following its transformations—this is what it means to be capable of all things.\n\nThe second, Natural Emptiness and Nothingness, is to guard the form in profound emptiness, naturally without flaw. The body’s interior shines white, above and below like jade, without blemish. Practiced over time, this too is a method to transcend the world. It follows the image of the Primal Qi of Non-Action.\n\nThe third, Numerical Measurement, is to accumulate essence and observe oneself. Count from the hair on the head to the feet, distinguishing each of the five fingers. The body’s external and internal aspects are all enumerated without omission. Know its meaning and constantly hold this in mind. Not losing even a fraction, this is also a lesser method to transcend the world. It follows Serene Emptiness.\n\nThe fourth, the Spirit’s Journey Forth, is to contemplate the spirits of the five viscera, all emerging and entering, visible in their movements. You may speak with them. The mind follows the spirit’s comings and goings, perceiving the body’s interior with clarity. This enables knowledge of fortune and misfortune, following Numerical Measurement.\n\nThe fifth, the Great Dao’s Spirit, is when the human spirit emerges and aligns with the Five Phases and Four Seasons—green, red, white, yellow, black—all harmonizing with the visceral spirits. Their comings and goings are directed by the spirit officials of the Four Seasons and Five Phases, called the Complete Dao. It can subdue all heterodoxies.\n\nThe sixth, Piercing Joy, involves piercing and binding the earthly spirits of the Dao, each with its own canon. Following their household methods, spirits are summoned to wander. Half resemble the true, half the heterodox, often enticing people with cleverness. They cannot be constantly employed, for over time they bring sorrow.\n\nThe seventh, Community Counsel, involves the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the Four Seasons, altars of soil and grain, mountains and rivers—sacrificial spirits who descend to humans. They cause confusion, prompting reckless speech about spirits, violent enmity, and wild heterodoxy. One must not act recklessly.\n\nThe eighth, Overflowing Spirit, speaks of spirits that overflow, their Dao unattached to any system. They are the refined qi of the world descending upon people, causing reckless speech. Half resemble the true, half the heterodox.\n\nThe ninth, Ancestral Spirits, involves purely seeing ghosts, without any true Dao. Those who summon them attract only the ghosts of the dead. This is the lowest extreme of the Dao, called the path of the inferior scholar.\n\nOne who attains the upper Dao can also employ the lower. One who attains the lower Dao cannot employ the upper.\n\nNow, I wish to know: why are there these distinctions of upper and lower?\n\nThis arises from human conduct. Those who guard the root attain the upper. Those who delight in the spirit’s exit and entry into the body attain the middle. Foolish people harm the root and guard the branches, wandering with other spirits to attain the lower.\n\nThose who guard the root can fully perceive it. Those who guard the middle perceive half. Those who guard the branches cannot return to see the Dao’s mirror.\n\nThus, all learners must find an enlightened master. Without one, they lose the path. Therefore, the transmission from master to master is as enduring as metal and stone. Without such transmission, it is called reckless practice, leading to misfortune and heterodoxy.\n\nPerfected One, be cautious, be cautious.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, in ancient times, the highest learners among sages and worthies, having found enlightened masters, were called reborn. Those without enlightened masters were called disruptors of the scriptures. Therefore, all worthies and sages served masters to achieve completion. Without a master, the Dao does not arise spontaneously.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.\n\nPerfected One, if you wish to know its effect, consider this: dwelling in a village of great worthies makes one greatly worthy. Dwelling in a village of middling worthies makes one middling worthy. Dwelling in a village of the unworthy makes one unworthy. This is what it means to never surpass such influence.\n\nThose who study this Dao must examine it carefully and in detail. This is the essential Dao of Heaven.",

When one is about to attain the Dao, at the moment of near-completion, one will commune with all spirits, dwell as neighbors with the spiritual and the numinous, and meet them in all goings and comings. One will love others as a father loves his child.\n\nThe Dao is a weighty matter. Some may regret bestowing it upon others and seek to wrest it away. Thus, they first test a person to see if they are steadfast. They may come together to deceive, causing one to speak recklessly. If one obtains their words and firmly seals them, taking care never to transmit them, one may attain longevity. With time, one may attain the true Dao. To transmit them is to invite gradual decay. Moreover, it causes one to cherish life and abhor harm.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"I wish to hear the meaning of 'gradual decay.'\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"When the spirit decays, the body dies. The Dao of emptiness and absolute profundity constantly urges one to cherish life and abhor killing, to seal the mouth and prevent leakage—only then can one endure for ten thousand myriad years.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked the Divine Person: \"I wish to hear the prohibitions against leakage.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Thus, if a great person leaks it, they lose their position. If a middling person leaks it, their qi is severed. If a petty person leaks it, their lineage is extinguished. The reason is this: Heaven and Earth use this to distinguish themselves and maintain their exclusivity, and thus the divine holds it in the utmost reverence. If Heaven and Earth did not profoundly know the Dao of absolute profundity, how could they be divine? How could they be eternal?\n\nRemember this: treasure its essence, value it, and be cautious.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and dared not speak recklessly.\n\nThe Perfected One bowed and asked: \"When they seek to corrupt a person, what is to be done?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"When evil intent arises in a person’s heart, great malevolence comes to deceive. If one can firmly seal their ears and refuse to heed their words, it is auspicious. To listen to their words is to invite misfortune and harm.\n\nIf a ruler listens, they will despise their ministers, accusing them of disloyalty and plotting rebellion. If a minister or child listens, they will despise their ruler or father, and the deceiver will approach, saying, 'You shall soon become a sage' or 'You shall soon become a ruler.' If a petty person listens, they will be made to boast of their own greatness. If a father listens, they will despise their child; if a child listens, they will despise their father. Their words shift and twist, confusing the heart and mind, speaking now of good, now of evil, disrupting governance. With one moment of joy and the next of anger, this is the great flattery of malevolence, ever seeking to harm others.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, all who have studied long life have failed to transcend these words.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"What is to be done?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Seal your ears and do not listen; seal your mouth and do not speak. These are but flatteries of malevolence—there is nothing worth hearing. To listen is to lose the true Dao, and to lose it is to die. If you wish to endure, be cautious of these words.\n\nI have already warned you of this, for how often have you nearly fallen prey to this great malevolence? I constantly rectify my own heart and no longer employ such things. This great malevolence constantly accumulates, seeking to observe whether a person is steadfast. The cunning and malevolent may even enter a person’s belly, stirring their heart and causing them to act recklessly. They provoke joy and anger, making it impossible to restrain oneself—all are led astray by malevolence. Driven by malevolence, the many are swept away to destruction.\n\nIn such matters, the accumulated cases are many. One must carefully observe these weighty precepts, and the heart must not be swayed—not only for those who study the Dao. The common people, too, are subject to unpredictable joy and anger; the same applies to you. Be cautious and refine yourself.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"I myself have been afflicted by great malevolence, which made me wish to boast, saying, 'I shall become a ruler, and later ascend as an immortal to the heavens.' I believed their words and rejoiced greatly. Later, I fell ill for three months with madness, but when I saw the Divine Person and Heavenly Master, my heart filled with joy. I have personally experienced this affliction and nearly succumbed to severe illness. Later, the madness ceased, and I recovered, attaining several thousand years of life. Now, I am fortunate to meet the Divine Person again, to receive the Dao’s precepts anew, and to see the gateway, hoping to endure long and become an official of the heavens.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"If you hold your heart and will so steadfastly, why fear you will not ascend to the Nine Heavens and traverse the Twenty-Five Heavens? All those who ascend to the heavens now have held their hearts firm and unyielding—none may err.\n\nAll who are misled by confusion and deception die prematurely and fail to transcend. If you wish for long life, study this text and take it as a weighty precept. This is the precept of life and death—one must not fail to be cautious.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of ancient times who first transcended the world did not rely on this power. Those who study the Dao yet fail to transcend and do not endure long do so because they listened to this and were ensnared by its harm. The great spirits of the heavens do not permit harm to be done to others; they cause such harm to rebound upon the perpetrator, leaving them without great fortune. Those who were to live are turned to death, becoming thieves of Heaven.\n\nNow, all that I have taught and shown to you, Perfected One, may lead to great longevity. Some may transcend the world, but you must carefully guard yourself and not allow this to become harm. If you can focus your heart single-mindedly, you may endure for ten thousand myriad years.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes. I dare not act wrongly; I beg to receive the enlightened precepts.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Your devotion to the Dao is such that you shall accomplish the task and ascend the steps to Heaven.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"Are these the only precepts against malevolence? Are there deeper ones? Are there precepts of the heavens above?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"There are indeed the unyielding precepts of Heaven, which firmly admonish people’s ears. The primary precept is against colluding with others to deceive, telling them they shall soon be exalted and noble—this is how one is admonished.\"",

Again, they are repeatedly tested with jade maidens, made to wander in their company; those who succumb laugh at others’ baseness, only to bring harm upon their own bodies in return. Yet if one remains ever silent, for ten thousand years there is nothing to hear—only guarding one’s own life to its end, what harm could there be? Between life and death, this alone is paramount.\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Perfected One asked: \"Why does the Dao specifically send evil spirits to test men?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"The Dao is weighty and difficult to bestow upon men. Those who grasp it must hold fast, even unto death; thus, none may wrest a man’s aspiration from him. The transcendent scholars of Heaven do not covet honor or nobility. They delight only in life itself—there is no extraordinary path. Remember my precepts, and you shall recite them ceaselessly; my words must never be forgotten for ten thousand generations. Even if one ascends to the boundless heavens of utmost purity, the precepts remain thus—there is nothing extraordinary beyond them.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and dared not stray from the guiding line.\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"If you are truly as you say, you have already attained the Dao. The auspicious shall advance daily, while the wicked shall cease their ascent. Holding the heart thus, you fulfill the divine precepts. Having accomplished this, you shall ride clouds and mount dragons, roaming the eight directions. The great Dao lies open before you; your life shall be long and boundless.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Divine Person continued: \"The Dao is truly vast, without inner or outer bounds. Yet one must ever fear being harmed by great evil, for if one does not heed even a single wickedness, how could evil ever prevail? Thus, the ancient emperors and kings who loved the Dao and studied it, refusing to listen to evil, all attained lives of ten thousand myriad years. Those who heeded and employed wicked words all brought ruin upon themselves. My Dao encompasses myriad facets—you must know their benefits and harms.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Now that you have received the words of the Divine Person, may you attain long life in an instant?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Without deep precepts, even accomplished deeds may turn inauspicious, and the Dao will not be fulfilled.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Is my life fated by destiny, or is it mere fortune that I have encountered the Divine Person?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Such is the nature of the Six Kinds of Men. Each has their own destiny: first, the Divine Person; second, the Perfected Person; third, the Immortal; fourth, the Daoist; fifth, the Sage; sixth, the Worthy. All assist Heaven in governance. The Divine Person presides over Heaven, the Perfected Person over Earth, the Immortal over wind and rain, the Daoist over teaching and the auspices of good and ill, the Sage over governing the people, and the Worthy assists the Sage in ordering the records of the myriad folk, supplying what is lacking in the Six Directions. Thus, men are born with their own destinies—those fated for nobility cannot be base, and those fated for baseness cannot be noble. Do you wish to know the truth of this? Consider the fish, which though it dwells in water, cannot soar without the water’s qi; the dragon, however, rides the water’s qi to ascend the azure clouds and become Heaven’s messenger. Nobility and baseness are truly matters of destiny—fools who speak recklessly do so in vain. The ancient sage-kings, in their great wisdom, did not record or heed false words, knowing them to be impossible. This is like teaching a man without the Dao to suddenly fly—how could he take flight? Only those who have attained the Dao and become immortals can truly fly. When the common folk play and boast, 'I can fly,' yet cannot, they speak falsehoods like this.\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Excellent! I have awakened to this truth.\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Are you still so foolish as to think that Heaven’s mandate can be forcibly obtained?\"\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Can this Dao also be learned?\"\n\nThe Divine Person replied: \"Only those with Heaven’s mandate may learn it and surely attain great transcendence. Those of middling worth who study it may also attain long life, while the foolish who pursue it may gain a lesser span. Do you wish to see its effects? It is like the common man who studies: the greatly worthy may become high officials, those of middling worth may become middling officials, and the foolish may become petty clerks. Are not petty clerks still set above the common folk? Thus, one should strive to study.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes. I shall practice this without ever daring to slacken.\"\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Then exert yourself and trust in the Dao. Between Heaven and Earth, each takes what is fitting—there is no falsehood in this.\"\n\nThe Perfected One assented, \"Yes, yes,\" and pledged to honor Heaven and revere Earth, respect superiors and cherish inferiors, follow the four seasons and the five phases, and never dare to act wrongly.\n\nThe Divine Person said: \"Excellent, excellent!

      "translated_text": "The heavens and earth possess their own divine treasures, each endowed with numinous essence and radiance. These follow the Five Phases in color and wax and wane with the qi of the four seasons, serving as heaven and earth’s envoys to bring forth the myriad people and creatures. Within the interplay of heaven and earth, yin and yang, none escape their transformative virtue and generation.\n\nThose who grasp their intent may witness them at once; those who fail to comprehend their essential meaning find no gateway to knowledge. Those who can broadly open and apply them achieve great fortune, able to dispel the afflictions, sufferings, malevolence, and evils that plague people between heaven and earth. Those who do not know the great method cannot recklessly summon or employ these spirits in vain.\n\nWe wish to hear their intent, that it may be transmitted for ten thousand generations without error.\n\nExcellent is your question. To await and obtain this art, there exists a great method: the qi of the four seasons and Five Phases enters the human abdomen, becoming the spirit of the five viscera. Their colors correspond to the colors of heaven, earth, and the four seasons. When depicted as a person, let the three be harmonized—with the ruling qi’s color covering the exterior, the ministerial qi’s color next, and the subtle qi residing innermost—so that their garments and hems reveal them.\n\nFirst, fast and reside in quietude, in a serene place. Reflect upon and contemplate them, then create their painted images, their length unrestricted. For the five, depict them together upon five feet of plain silk. Let them be well-crafted: men should envision men, women envision women. Such is the method of painting their images. These writings are already numerous, not confined to a single version. From top to bottom, discuss their textual meaning and proceed accordingly, using written words to subtly clarify.\n\nThough my writings are many, they possess a grand division: texts are grouped by category, and characters elucidate one another, so that their essential meaning is fully attained.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThis spirit of the four seasons and Five Phases enters to become the spirit of the five viscera and emerges to become the numinous essence of the four seasons and Five Phases. Those closest to humans are called the spirits of the Five Powers, resembling the spirits of the viscera. Those more distant are called the Solar Calendar, styled as the Four Seasons’ Troops and Horses, capable of repelling malevolence. They too act in accord with the waxing and waning qi of the four seasons.\n\nFor their method, prepare their painted images: let the person be clad in three layers of robes, with the ruling qi’s color on the outside, the ministerial qi’s next, and the subtle qi innermost. All wear caps and ride horses, the horses also arrayed in the colors of the Five Phases. First, paint the images on one side: two zhang in length, loosely depicting twenty-five riders upon five silks. Craft them well.\n\nThe riders of the east hold spears; those of the south, halberds; those of the west, bows, crossbows, and axes; those of the north, bucklers and sabers; and those of the center, swords and drums. In contemplation, one should first perceive the inner spirits, then the outer spirits. Or one may first see the yang spirits before the inner spirits. To perceive them thus is the method of formless images. One must also receive oral instructions from a master, for there is a crucial point at the outset. Those who know it find it easy to transmit and achieve; it is fitting to keep it distant from others and practice in seclusion. If it is easily gathered near people, it will surely be difficult to accomplish.\n\nWhen this Dao is accomplished, it is called \"illumination.\" Those of the utmost reversal and profound emptiness gather it. The forms of illness are not many; many is auspicious, few is inauspicious. If some remain untreated, unresolved, or uncured, how many must one obtain to suffice?\n\nThe highest obtain ten thousand, the middling four or five thousand, the lowest several hundred, or merely dozens. Why so many?\n\nAh, have the Perfected Ones reverted to their former ignorance? Be seated, and I shall now explain the essential meaning to you.\n\nAfter the present era of bearing and shouldering [karmic burdens], heaven and earth suffer abundant calamities. Ghosts, old spirits, and baleful misfortunes—corpse-related omens are not singular. There are also wind-damp sores, scabies, and the manifold disasters of this degenerate age, too numerous to name. One person may have a hundred illnesses, or dozens. Suppose each person could be long or short-lived, or each could dispel one illness. Like a diviner skilled in the arts of milfoil and turtle-shell, removing one baleful affliction; or a great physician skilled in medicinal formulas, dispelling one illness; or an acupuncturist skilled in needling the channels, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in moxibustion, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in exorcism, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in sacrifices, dispelling one illness; or one skilled in commanding spirits to guide and inspect ghosts, dispelling one illness—these seven people each remove one illness, thus dispelling seven illnesses.\n\nIn this degenerate age, people suffer many illnesses; some have a dozen, while others claim to have a hundred, all afflicted with every kind of suffering. Though all skilled artisans each remove one illness—thus dispelling seven—the remaining illnesses persist, not fully eradicated. The strength of the seven artisans is exhausted, yet these remaining illnesses continue to torment people. Over time, they become impoverished, and many die, unable to extricate themselves from their plight.\n\nHow long is a person’s allotted lifespan? How many illnesses do they witness? They encounter hardships, prosperity and decline, advance and retreat. Heaven’s standard is like the four seasons and Five Phases, which have their waxing and waning. The eight trigrams Qian and Kun are the bodies of heaven and earth, yet they too have times of rest, imprisonment, desolation, and diminished qi. How much more so for humans?\n\nHumans emulate heaven and earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the six conjunctions, and the eight directions, ever waxing and waning without cease. Thus, one must prepare in advance, rescuing the sources of fortune and misfortune. In peace, do not forget peril; in existence, do not forget annihilation; in order, do not forget chaos. Only then can one endure long.\n\nTherefore, in the method of treating malevolence, the Daoist does not suffer many illnesses. If one person can dispel one illness, ten people dispel ten illnesses, a hundred dispel a hundred, a thousand dispel a thousand, and ten thousand dispel ten thousand.",

When the qi of Great Peace arrives, evil should naturally dissipate. Yet since the opening of Heaven and Earth, evil qi has accumulated over vast ages, amassing in great multitudes, each generation inheriting and compounding the last. Though the governing qi of Great Peace has come, how could it eradicate all this in a single day? Thus, one must prepare in advance. To wait until evil has already wrought its devastation before seeking skilled artisans—this is far too late.\n\nIn the highest antiquity, each person knew the true Dao, and there was little evil qi. From the era of the Supreme Middle Antiquity onward, people grew foolish, delighting in superficial adornments and neglecting the true Dao. Evil qi, frenzied spirits, and calamitous misfortunes multiplied, so that many met their end before fulfilling their allotted years. All this arose from benighted minds, clouded and obscured, failing to guard against the root in advance.\n\nNow, under the governance of a ruler of supreme virtue, Heaven cherishes him and does not wish him to suffer like those foolish multitudes, cut short in their years. It desires that he swiftly perfect his great virtue and align his heart with Heaven.

Therefore, my writings—*dōng-dōng*—instruct those of virtue and rulers to prepare in advance. The most wise, upon seeing my words, will surely awaken fully; those of middling wisdom, upon reading my writings, will partially awaken; the foolish and unenlightened will not awaken but instead mock my words for failing to grasp their essence—thus they have already reached their limit. For heaven, earth, and the emperors, there is no matter more pressing than this.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace arrives and the virtuous lord of yang rules, his reign should endure long. Yet death among the people of the world is no small matter. Once dead, one never again beholds heaven and earth, sun and moon—flesh and bone become mere mud. Death is a weighty affair. Each person dwelling between heaven and earth is granted but one life; none may live twice. Only those who have attained the Dao may be reborn after death—those who undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation). These are the ones heaven and earth favor in secret, not even one in ten thousand.\n\nThus, for ordinary people, once dead, there is no return to life. Therefore, one must prepare thoroughly. Even in the era of Great Peace and years of abundance, perverse qi still lingers. It is like a household that is mostly good yet harbors wicked individuals—only by enduring one another is harmony maintained. For this reason, it is all the more necessary to gather those skilled in the Dao and its arts, so that when the unwholesome arises, it may be swiftly eradicated. If not removed promptly, it will take root and grow. Thus, I teach preparedness and the multiplication of such people.\n\nThe purpose of great learning is to accumulate those of virtue and power, ensuring they may be sought when needed. Without prior cultivation and gathering, they cannot be obtained in haste. Should an unforeseen crisis arise and one wish to consult ancient and modern precedents, without those of profound virtue and power already at hand, none will be able to respond promptly or resolve the matter.

As those who do so increase day by day, in time, great and small will all be transformed. When all can act thus, then select from among them those of the greatest merit, gather them all, appoint those of great achievement to their positions, and reward those of lesser merit.

Simply follow the model: those who consistently achieve success are those who grasp the intent of the Dao and are greatly trusted by others. Those who know but a few words yet produce no great effect have not grasped the intent of the Dao and speak recklessly—they are great flatterers, unfit for use, and only bring chaos to the Dao.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?

By setting forth the method, if I do not ask, those of future ages will not comprehend the intent of Heaven’s Dao.\n\nVery well. This is the image of Heaven. All things follow their kind.\n\nThe East is where things first sprout, heads breaking forth, all growth benefiting as they pierce the earth and emerge—its essence resembles a spear. Thus, it is the spear. When the spirit-officials of the East arrive, they take this as their insignia.\n\nThe South: all things hang branches and spread leaves, like a halberd. Thus, its spirit holds a halberd. When the spirit-officials of the South arrive, they take this as their insignia.\n\nThe West is the bow, crossbow, and axe. The West is the image of Heaven’s crossbow of slaughter. The bow, crossbow, and axe are the greatest instruments of harm. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they take these as their insignia.\n\nThe North is the shield, buckler, and blade. The North is where things hide and flee. Shields and bucklers serve to protect the body; blades are wielded by petty men, ever used to evade and harm—these are not the possessions of noble gentlemen. Thus, when its spirits arrive, they too take these as their insignia.\n\nThe Center is thunder, the drum, and the sword. The Center is Earth, the ruler of the Five Phases. The drum is the chief of the five weapons; the sword is worn by gentlemen of virtue and power, and is also the chief of the five weapons. Thus, when the spirits of the Center arrive, they take these as their insignia.\n\nThese are the true and natural credentials of Heaven and Earth. Just as a person is born with a head, so too must they bear their proper insignia. When the authentic credentials arrive in response, anything else is not the true spirit-official. If other spirits falsely arrive in response, all becomes disordered governance. Over time, such chaos is difficult to pacify. Therefore, all seek the true credentials.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\nYes, yes.",

      "translated_text": "This discourse moves from the shallow to the deep, for even what seems insignificant must align and harmonize with the qi of Heaven, Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases.\n\nExcellent, excellent. Proceed—Perfected One, you understand this well.\n\nHere ends the method to suppress evil and transform all into the Dao to save lives.\n\n*End of Scroll Seventy-Two of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll Eighty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace follows*\n*Collected Writings of the Three Daoist Texts, Method One Hundred Twenty-Seven*\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions all respectfully bowed. Having previously received the Celestial Master’s teachings to compile and present a solemn memorial, each returned to their respective posts, pressing their hands to their hearts to ponder its meaning. For seven days and seven nights, the Six Perfected Ones convened thrice to deliberate, yet remained perplexed.\n\nThese three assemblies were held in the open, where they witnessed three celestial omens in the form of shooting stars. First, they saw a star emerge from the Gate of Heaven and enter the Door of Earth. Next, they saw a star depart from the Great Yang and plunge into the Great Yin. Third, they saw the constellations stream into the Celestial Prison.\n\nFearing that the Celestial Master’s threefold scriptures might be severed below, preventing their ascent and causing Heaven’s wrath to deepen, they deliberated together. If the qi of the Supreme August One could not descend, then the virtuous sovereign, though steadfast, would continue to bear the lingering disasters of former kings, enduring sorrow and hardship.\n\nAlas! The Six Perfected Ones, having come on behalf of the August Spirit to inquire, must now redouble their efforts for Heaven’s sake.\n\nI have observed that among all disciples, none surpass these Perfected Ones. Now, let them explain the meaning of the shooting stars.\n\nYour six disciples, though dull and benighted, dare not remain silent.\n\nFirst, a star emerged from the Gate of Heaven and entered the Door of Earth. The Gate of Heaven is yang, the sovereign. The Door of Earth is yin, the ministers and people. Now, if the ministers and people do not ascend in their conduct to attach themselves above but instead turn to bestow favor downward—if the door and gate, which govern communication, now see the lower gate fail to ascend while the upper gate opens downward—this signifies that the lower petition is severed, preventing its ascent.\n\nExcellent, Perfected Ones. Your words leave nothing to be added. Though weary, proceed to explain the second omen.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe second omen showed a star from the Great Yang streaming into the Great Yin. The Great Yang is the sovereign; the Great Yin, the ministers and people. The Great Yang is luminous; the Great Yin, dark and obscure. Now, the obscure should flow upward into the luminous, just as ministers and people, benighted and impoverished, should attach themselves to a radiant king and sagely lord to seek redress for their grievances. Yet here, the luminous descends into obscurity—this mirrors imperial edicts bestowing grace, their downward course severed. The obscure remains unilluminated, internal governance descends into chaos, and the darkness veils the sovereign above.\n\nIt also resembles petty officials and local leaders who, together, conceal Heaven and Earth’s calamities and omens, preventing their transmission upward. In darkness, they deceive their superiors alongside the ministers and people, serving as proof of their collusion in villainy.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your words, Six Disciples, leave nothing to be added. Though weary, proceed to explain the third omen.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe third omen showed the constellations streaming into the Celestial Prison. The constellations are stars of goodness and rectitude, yet they flowed into the Celestial Prison—the place where Heaven metes out punishment. This portends that worthy and virtuous men, wishing to serve the sovereign and present memorials to communicate Heaven and Earth’s counsel, are instead resented and maligned by distant officials in the wilderness. Later, these officials fabricate charges to harm them, causing the constellations to stream into prison.\n\nExcellent and precise! Your words, Six Disciples, leave nothing to be added. Now, why do you alone seem aggrieved, as if weary of inquiry?\n\nWe dare not. We have always heard the Celestial Master say that the Perfected Ones come from Heaven to inquire. If we were to cease now, we fear Heaven’s words would not be conveyed. All human lives belong to Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth are displeased, they will instead afflict people with illness, preventing them from fulfilling their allotted years.\n\nExcellent! The Perfected Ones’ words are correct and unerring. Now, I shall speak to you all without daring to omit or slacken. We Perfected Ones are equals, our lives all belonging to Heaven and Earth. If we withhold our words or speak and then cease, Heaven and Earth will together harm us. Thus, I dare not speak recklessly or stop.\n\nProceed, then, and explain fully for the Six Perfected Ones.\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones have newly emerged to ponder Heaven’s concerns, seeking to eliminate Heaven’s afflictions, and to contemplate the thoughts of a virtuous sovereign, seeking to resolve disasters and secure peace. Let the Six Perfected Ones thoroughly discuss their intentions, expressing all they wish to say, so that nothing is severed or obstructed.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWe dare not fail to exhaust even the meager wisdom of a sparrow or mouse in speaking all we know, as the Celestial Master has commanded.\n\nMost admirable.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nNow, the world fears the closing of mouths, for none dare speak recklessly. Even the sun, moon, and stars—spirits of Heaven’s constellations—stand in awe of one another. Thus, when the sun rises, the stars flee and hide, not daring to appear, fearing its majesty.\n\nWithin the four borders, a stern sovereign commands the realm, and all are struck with terror. Even those far from the capital dare not speak when an imperial edict arrives. If a province has a powerful governor, the entire province dares not speak. If a commandery has a strong magistrate, the whole commandery dares not speak. If a county has a harsh magistrate, the entire county dares not speak. Even if a remote post has a severe post captain, the entire post dares not speak. Yet this post captain is but the lowest of officials—how much more so for ministers?\n\nAll fear harm and seek only to absolve themselves. Though they may harbor good intentions, they dare not express them to their superiors, causing the Dao to be severed at this point. Now, if even a single village has a stern and upright man who upholds its order, the entire village dares not speak, fearing later resentment and harm.",

      "translated_text": "Should but a single household have a man of martial vigor and unyielding qi who holds sway, even that household dares not speak. Yet within a household, all share flesh and blood, born of the same kind—still they loathe and fear one another so. How much more so for those of different generations?\n\nSince the High Antiquity of the Supreme Dao, the Way and its virtue have been largely lost, replaced by governance through might and coercion. Those who press and compel obedience mete out grave harm to any who resist, inflicting wounds so deep they flow to descendants. Thus, though the people witness celestial portents and ominous calamities, they dare not speak rashly of them, fearing those near and bound to them. Such silence accumulates over time, passing burdens from one to the next. By the Latter Antiquity, the affliction grows even more severe: should any minor figure seek to memorialize the throne or speak his mind to the emperor, those nearby who hold his life in their hands will kill him outright—or if not immediately, later conspire to harm him through connections and favors. Thus, ministers and commoners alike seal their tongues and shut their mouths in darkness, though they see sorrow, injustice, and evil, they dare not transmit it upward.\n\nThough the emperor’s wisdom is peerless, celestial anomalies multiply daily—clear proof of this. Now, the people are born and receive their mandate from Heaven and Earth, taking them as father and mother. When they witness disasters, omens, good or ill, these are the words of Heaven and Earth, their very speech. Yet all are so terrified, so threatened by those near and bound to them, that they dare not speak or reveal the matter. Instead, they admonish one another, turning their backs on Heaven and Earth, cutting off all communication, blocking the words Heaven and Earth wish to convey. They thus obscure and wrong Heaven and Earth, preventing their voices from being heard, leaving them long embittered and unexpressed.\n\nThough the emperor may be divine and sagely, he is but one source, nestled within a hundred layers of men, beyond ten thousand li. Even if those within the hundred layers wish to convey words, they are coerced by those near them and cannot reach him. Though the emperor may possess the benevolence and wisdom of ten thousand men, each person is pressed and cowed by fear. Heaven and Earth, the most divine and supreme, are merely gazed upon from afar—people rely on them only to absolve themselves in the moment. How could the emperor’s divinity surpass that of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWe six fools once encountered a fierce tiger in the distant wilderness. All six halted, dared not move, dared not speak, dared not turn our heads, dared not close our eyes. Such is the coercion and fear that men endure! How excellent, how excellent! Now, hearing the words of the Six Perfected Ones, we understand that Heaven alone has long suffered grievous injustice, its words unable to reach above. Though it creates ten thousand strange anomalies as its speech, below they are blocked and severed, unable to ascend, leaving only pent-up bitterness over time.\n\nThus, the wind now stirs the Perfected Ones, instructing them to admonish and charge this matter of the scripture’s transmission. Therefore, the Perfected Ones, trembling and weary, are Heaven’s envoys. Very well. We revere Heaven’s majesty and shall ponder its essential meaning for you in full.\n\nNow, the Six Perfected Ones ask: of these matters, which is the most severe? We six fools deliberated for seven days and seven nights on this matter of the scripture’s transmission, convening thrice and thrice witnessing meteors, taking them as Heaven’s command to instruct and charge men to inquire. Moreover, all six of us ingested qi, yet it could not descend and pass through, instead reversing and rising upward. At that moment, our ears and eyes grew dizzy and blind, and we were all astonished, discussing it together, unaware of what it portended—greatly alarmed and terrified. Only the Heavenly Master explained it to us fools.\n\nExcellent! The Perfected Ones have grasped the ancient transformations and their full meaning. Hearing the Perfected Ones’ words, we now know of the Three Dao Scriptures. Yet the Perfected Ones will soon be blocked and severed again—why? We wish to hear the decisive meaning.\n\nNow, the nine orifices correspond to the divisions of the Nine Provinces. The Perfected Ones themselves say that when they ingest qi, it [blocks] and does not pass through, leaving them dizzy and without light—this is the pressing coercion among the great and small of the Nine Provinces, where urgent words from below cannot reach above. Qi is that which conveys the mandate of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Heaven and Earth transform the mandate of the myriad things through qi and wind. That qi [blocks] and does not pass through is clear proof that the Dao of Heaven is obstructed and cannot reach its destination.\n\nHeaven wishes the Perfected Ones to admonish this matter, thus stirring and moving them through qi.

Yet humankind, born of Heaven and Earth, turns its back on them, severs the celestial discourse, and causes Heaven to fall ill. The accumulation remains unremoved, pent-up and obstructed, unable to convey its message to its children—this is a grave and heinous crime.\n\nThe people and ministers are the envoys of the emperor-king, his hands and feet. They ought to clarify and convey his wisdom, ensuring that above, he may rest without worry, and together, they may align with the heart of Heaven. When Heaven rejoices, it grants the ruler extended years. Yet now, those below act disloyally, betraying Heaven and Earth, blocking the emperor-king’s wisdom, and causing him distress.

The reason I dare not remain silent is that I see the Six Masters come to inquire of affairs, and I recognize your commission as envoys of Heaven. How, then, could the Perfected Ones dare to withhold their words? Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIf I do not speak now, it would be called misleading those above. The Virtuous Lord, upon seeing these writings, commands all who submit memorials to ensure that those with great merit are duly rewarded. In this way, none under Heaven will fail to rejoice, delighting in exerting their utmost strength to submit memorials and speak of affairs. Let it not be that only a solitary voice is heard—all must gather to deliberate. If one person speaks falsely or with deceitful flattery, it would cause the ruler to lose grasp of reality, and such grave errors must not be heeded.\n\nIn recent years, those who have submitted memorials have done so with increasing reliability, and many have rendered great service. Yet those of the highest rank who gather in numbers are often too few—when only two or three assemble, there are invariably many among them who harbor deceit and falsehood. Why is this so? I wish to explain.\n\nWhen many gather, those who submit memorials naturally restrain one another, fearing that matters may be leaked, that their strengths and weaknesses may be exposed, or that they may be accused of deceiving their superiors or be reported by others. Thus, they dare not speak unless they have thoroughly verified the facts. If they do not verify, they dare not speak, nor dare they conceal anything, for they fear the consequences that may follow. This is why their words are entirely trustworthy.\n\nConsider a village of a hundred households engaged in deceit: among its men, women, children, and elders, there will always be someone who reveals the truth, and neighboring villages will come to know of it. The wise and cautious in that village will not dare to conceal it, fearing they may be implicated. How much less, then, can matters in a prefecture, a commandery, a county, a township, or a post station be hidden? If a commandery experiences extraordinary events, how can they remain concealed? They will inevitably be exposed by others, and thus all good and evil will come to light. Heaven will rejoice greatly, disasters will be dispelled, and the realm will flow as smoothly as running water. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.",

This crime defies description—it is a transgression deserving of death and beyond.\n\nDo the Perfected Ones understand? Indeed, indeed.",

If many bear such afflictions, the memorials have not yet fully harmonized with the divine spirits, for residual suffering remains—worms still consume people, and thus the worms govern them.

You six have been tasked with inquiring of Heaven’s affairs—proceed with utmost care, for the Perfected Ones speak by Heaven’s decree.\n\nThe reason for extending this to commoners and even slaves is this: under Heaven’s vast expanse, regions a myriad *li* apart differ in sky and earth; five thousand *li* apart, they differ slightly; a thousand *li* apart, their *qi* and winds diverge; five hundred *li* apart, they differ again in small measure; a hundred *li* apart, their yin and rain vary; fifty *li* apart, they differ once more in minor ways. Within a single county, anomalies, calamities, strange phenomena, good and ill omens all manifest uniquely.\n\nWhen the August Heaven sends forth calamities and strange transformations, they do not necessarily appear only in the imperial palace, the halls of local officials, or before high-ranking magistrates. Such anomalies are most often seen in the wilderness and among the common folk, where the lowly and humble learn of them first. Yet each conceals them out of fear for their superiors, daring not speak. Officials, too, conceal them out of fear for their lords, and so the discourse between Heaven and Earth is severed.\n\nEach seeks to flatter their superiors, desiring their names to be praised and their merits swiftly recognized, so they collude in wrongdoing, suppressing Heaven and Earth’s calamities and anomalies, blocking their transmission to the emperor. Thus, the Son of Heaven is cut off without cause, deprived of wisdom, unable to grasp the will of Heaven and Earth. His governance grows perilous and chaotic, fraught with sorrow.\n\nThe emperor is born by the mandate of Heaven, with Heaven as his father and Earth as his mother, making him the Son of Heaven. When ministers and people together act without the Dao, they sever the discourse between father and mother, preventing it from reaching their child. What crime could be greater?\n\nTo jointly sever the discourse of Heaven and Earth, to deceive one’s superiors, to be unfaithful and untrustworthy as ministers and people—how could such offenses be named lightly?

      "translated_text": "Thus, when Heaven intends to favor and assist an emperor or king, it first ensures they possess their own intent. From ancient times to the present, whenever Heaven has favored and assisted a ruler, it invariably bestows upon them extraordinary texts and uncommon strategies, enabling them to govern by their precepts—whereupon all their undertakings prove greatly auspicious.\n\nWhen Heaven does not intend to favor or benefit a ruler, it severs all such extraordinary texts and uncommon strategies, preventing their attainment. Even if obtained, it renders their minds dull, so they fail to comprehend or apply them. When Heaven intends to benefit a ruler, it opens their minds to clarity and delight, so they gladly employ them.\n\nThis is Heaven’s unchanging law, which does not deceive humankind. Therefore, those destined for prosperity tend to favor goodness, while those destined for decline tend to favor evil. Those destined for fortune are easily guided, while those destined for misfortune resist counsel and offend others, making them impossible to guide.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, Heaven constantly assists the good, and the Dao longs to return to those of virtue. Heaven refuses to assist the wicked, and the Dao refuses to cling to the foolish and benighted. Therefore, it frequently instructs the Perfected Ones to entrust governance to virtuous rulers.\n\nThe purpose of meticulously recording all omens—great and small, good and evil, internal and external, near and far—is to enable virtuous rulers above, together with their worthy ministers, to trace the origins of these anomalies. All the world’s strange portents and calamities arise as reflections of affairs, modeled upon conduct, and generated in accordance with their kind. When worthy ministers gather to deliberate, their thoughts become as vast as the matter itself. By examining the categories of events and inquiring into their patterns, the truth is revealed.\n\nThen Heaven and Earth rejoice daily, and the emperor and king attain daily peace. Thus, virtue reaches its fullest harmony, and no spirit or deity fails to respond. To witness its great efficacy: all the world’s afflictions, sufferings, and anomalies vanish entirely; ministers and people all act with goodness, responding to edicts with precision, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. Below, none dare deceive their superiors—this is the manifest proof.\n\nWhere many harms remain, deceit abounds; where few harms remain, deceit diminishes; where no harm remains, no deceit exists. By constantly observing what is presented from below, one may gauge the great and small, the loyal and faithless among ministers and people. Matched against events, it is like gazing into a bright mirror, speaking face-to-face.\n\nHow wondrous is the Dao when thus practiced! This is the bright mirror by which Heaven assists the ruler of supreme virtue in governing all under Heaven.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now and deliver this to the ruler of virtue—make haste!\n\nIf a single person submits a memorial, it is called a \"dropped document,\" and entrusting governance to a single confidant is called \"great deceit.\" This incurs Heaven’s profound resentment, and the Dao of Heaven is perpetually disrupted. If two people jointly submit a memorial, it is called \"Great Yin,\" a collusion of treachery and deceit. Two cunning individuals conspire in secrecy, harboring shared grievances to fabricate falsehoods—this brings misfortune upon Earth, and the Dao of Earth is thrown into great disorder.\n\nIf three people jointly submit a memorial, their collaboration remains insincere. Though they may instruct one another, if they share a common grievance and submit a matter to settle private scores, their deceit of their superiors is assured. This makes an enemy of the harmonious mean, throwing the qi of harmony into chaos. If four people jointly submit a memorial, there is often one who fears the truth, whose flaws are exposed by others, leading to accusations and false charges. Though it may resemble truth, its unreliability disrupts the four seasons.\n\nIf five people jointly submit a memorial, it may seem true but remains unverified—its falsehood disrupts the Five Phases. If six people jointly submit a memorial, it approaches truth but remains uncertain—its falsehood disrupts the Six Harmonies. If seven people jointly submit a memorial, it appears credible. Eight approach truth, nine approach sincerity, and ten nearly attain it.\n\nWhy, Heavenly Master, do you harbor so many doubts?\nI wish to hear the essential point.\n\nThe reason for these many doubts is that in the Five Directions, cunning individuals often harbor private grievances, using public matters to settle private scores. They readily conspire to become great deceivers and treacherous schemers, disrupting the Dao of Heaven and Earth to mislead their superiors. Thus, I dare not hastily trust them.\n\nHowever, if a matter is small, gather people of all ages—wise and foolish, men and women, down to servants—and deliberate together. Falsehood cannot prevail, nor can private scores be settled. If any among them feel uneasy and speak out, whether foolish, loose-tongued, unable to conceal, or elderly with little to fear, or even women and children who chatter carelessly, their collusion will be exposed.\n\nThus, the truth of the matter is revealed, and no treachery remains. When truth is attained, the hearts of Heaven and Earth are harmonized.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "The fundamental reason emperors and kings have borne successive transgressions and responsibilities, why governance continually loses the heart of Heaven, and why disasters flow unceasingly—with those that cease only to arise anew—is that the August Heaven remains unsettled. Harmful qi and illnesses abound, preventing long-lasting great joy. Even fleeting moments of happiness soon turn to misfortune. The root of this great fault lies precisely here.\n\nCunning and treacherous people jointly turn their backs on Heaven and Earth to deceive the emperor and king. Yet people regard Heaven and Earth as their mandate and the emperor and king as their parents. Fools who betray this mandate and collude to deceive their parents incur the shared hatred of Heaven and Earth and the emperor’s wrath. By law, their evil deaths are insufficient to expiate their crimes, and their punishment extends to future lives.\n\nThus, disasters never cease, harm multiplies daily, human lifespans shorten, and the myriad things remain in constant disorder. The true fault lies here.\n\nHave you now fully awakened to this, Perfected One? Have you deeply understood it?\nIndeed, indeed.\nYou may be said to have grasped it.\n\nTherefore, I know the August Heaven profoundly detests such evil. Thus, I have made this text repeatedly emphasize it for balance. To lose even one matter is to invite its rise. What was lost in the past may be regained in the future—this is especially grave, for Heaven greatly abhors it.\n\nI know its import and hereby instruct the Perfected One, entrusting it to a ruler of supreme virtue and power. If he obtains and practices it, he will differ not from the divine. Then the upright qi of the Great Peace and Supreme Sovereign will naturally establish itself.\n\nMy text dares not betray Heaven and Earth, nor the ruler of supreme virtue, nor the people of later generations and future ages, nor the myriad things.

Now, the governing officials and magistrates fear that the people will expose their affairs, and so they employ the Six Inquiries to examine them, thereby securing their trust. The people, too, fear the county authorities, and if they uncover their faults, they likewise believe. The county authorities and magistrates, dwelling among the people, also fear those who travel to other regions to submit memorials, and if they uncover their faults, they believe them as well. Those who travel to submit memorials also fear the county magistrates and the local people, and if their faults are exposed, they too are believed. Each fears the other, and thus none dare speak falsely, nor can they conceal anything.\n\nTherefore, when memorials are submitted from three sources—the county authorities, the local people, and the traveling petitioners—they all align at dawn, not deviating by even a fraction.

All shall be recorded beneath the abode of the Great Peace and Coming Good. Why must it be here?\n\nFor there are extraordinary methods and exceptional texts that may be deposited in the abode of the Great Peace and Coming Good, where good and evil are deliberated beneath it, and matters from the four directions are collectively submitted. If only one person deliberates, they may regret and cease, or be stopped by others. If a memorial is submitted but then halted along the way, the intent is abandoned, and the concealed matter is punished as a crime.\n\nThrough such writings, all under Heaven will be secured, and the emperor and kings will long wander in leisure.\n\nExcellent, excellent!",

      "translated_text": "Herein lies the accumulation of the Celestial Master’s writings—where ought they all be deposited? Those texts intended solely for the sovereign shall remain with the sovereign; all that pertain to the affairs of all under Heaven shall be fully disclosed. Do you understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed. The sovereign of supreme virtue is moved by Heaven itself to possess a sagely mind, and through this, naturally harbors good intentions, naturally issues virtuous decrees and rites—this is the celestial law, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. The matters are too numerous to record in full; the writings are ever a burden. Proceed.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nTo the right: Heaven’s decree to the Six Perfected Ones, instructing them to deeply comprehend the threefold Dao in the transmission of written texts and oral instructions.\n\n*End of Scroll Eighty-Six of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Beginning of Scroll Eighty-Eight of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Method for Establishing the Abode of Coming Good, One Hundred Twenty-Ninth*\n\nThe Six Perfected Ones of the Six Directions bow and ask, wishing to pose a single question.\n\nProceed with your words.\n\nThe Celestial Master previously commanded this humble student to compile and collate the essential texts of the High, Middle, and Low Antiquities, as well as the finest discourses of the wise and enlightened—matters transmitted orally. Now, within and beyond the four borders, some regions lie ten thousand leagues from the emperor, yet if there exist good writings, though their content be scant, they are carried from afar to the capital. Or if there be extraordinary texts, rare methods, or wondrous arts, scholars and recluses of profound learning, though duty-bound not to shun the journey of ten thousand leagues, may travel to the emperor to offer and expound their moral teachings. Or among the common folk—young and old, weak and small, field-dwelling infants, women, and children—each may harbor in their hearts good characters, oral instructions, or a few lines, yet their meager offerings prevent them from dispatching someone to carry them to the capital. Or among the barbarians of the four borders—hidden sages, Hu and Mo tribes—those deeply versed in secret Dao, though they know of the radiant and virtuous sovereign in the Central Kingdom, cannot bear the distant journey to present their rare texts, good strategies, or exceptional methods.\n\nNow the Celestial Master has gathered all the divine writings of the Yellow River and Luo River, the good texts of antiquity and present, along with the oral instructions of the wise and enlightened, to form the *Scripture of the Utmost Profundity*. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, all disasters may thus be eradicated, and the emperor may long wander in leisure, ruling with folded arms and without care. Yet if even one matter is left incomplete, residual calamities may remain—hence the need to gather them all. But how are these rare methods, exceptional strategies, and good characters to be fully obtained?\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nThe Perfected Ones ponder deeply, for the celestial spirits have already descended to instruct them. The qi of the Supreme August One comes to assist the virtuous sovereign—\n\nProceed. Now, Perfected Ones, you have asked on behalf of the August Numinous Heaven. My duty is to expound fully for all under Heaven—how dare I be remiss?\n\nUnderstood.\n\nLet the Perfected Ones be seated, for I shall now explain all to you.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThis scripture shall be entrusted to the August and Virtuous Emperor of the Supreme August One. Upon seeing the celestial texts, he must ponder their essential meaning and command the provinces, commanderies, and distant counties, towns, and villages of the four borders to each construct a fine abode along the great thoroughfares of the cities. Let it stand three *zhang* high, with a breadth and depth of three *zhang* as well. On all four sides, create good petitions, sized to match a person’s face, with openings wide enough for hands to pass through, and shelter their doors well—lest unauthorized persons force entry. Hang writings upon its exterior, clearly displaying the texts, and inscribe the abode’s purpose on all four sides.\n\nThe writings shall state: The emperor seeks rare texts, exceptional methods, good strategies, oral instructions, and the constant thoughts harbored in people’s hearts—whatever they can articulate. Let all be written down and deposited in this abode, with their names and surnames recorded. Then, summon and examine them, appointing positions according to the magnitude of their moral abilities. For those whose contributions are too numerous to verify, command the local officials of counties and towns to appoint them to office. For the elderly, weak, and women with good words, command the responsible officials to reward them. For those with great merit who cannot be appointed, grant them exemptions. For those beyond the four borders who present good and rare strategies with great efficacy, bestow generous rewards.\n\nThus, within and beyond the four borders, all shall simultaneously rise in great enthusiasm, rejoicing to devote their efforts to the emperor. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, no rare text, good character, or exceptional method shall remain hidden in distant lands. In a single day, all people shall turn to joyfully embrace goodness. Hidden recluses dwelling in caves shall emerge to wander the cities, beholding the emperor’s abode of Great Peace and Coming Good—none shall conceal themselves. Wind and rain shall arrive in due season, the Three Luminaries shall illuminate brightly—this is the sign of Heaven’s great joy.\n\nWhen the worthy sages of the eighty-one domains among the Four Barbarians hear that the Central Kingdom is governed by a sovereign of great virtue in this manner, none shall not delight in coming to submit, all bearing their rare treasures in continuous procession. Not one in ten thousand of my writings shall be lost—how could this not bring immense joy?\n\nWith governance of such great virtue, do the Perfected Ones now comprehend?\n\nIndeed, indeed. You have already awakened.",

If you have doubts, come again.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nPerfected One, step forward.\n\nWhen you first came to ask these matters, I had long intended to depart. Thus, I had already spoken words of parting with you. Yet seeing your earnestness, I knew you were aided by the yang essence of August Heaven. The reason for this is that I saw your sincerity, and that the Middle Kingdom shall flourish in great peace. The eighty-one domains shall send forth good people to return and submit to the Middle Kingdom. Therefore, I remained to explain everything to you in full.\n\nThe reason for this is that I saw you ceaselessly inquiring on Heaven’s behalf, and feared you might incur great fault, bringing censure from Heaven and Earth. Thus, I dared not abandon the Dao and depart midway.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo, and strive to complete this with utmost sincerity. Do not forsake the Heavenly Dao. Ask this one final question.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly request to ask: Master of Heaven, what did you observe in the bustling crossroads of the capital that led you to establish a chamber for the *Scripture of Wondrous Methods and Secret Strategies* to bring about Great Peace?\n\nExcellent, Perfected One, your difficult question has grasped the essential meaning. Heaven has long been grieved. Has the emperor sent you to ask this? How skillfully you present your words!\n\nYet from my dwelling in the heavens, I have observed what can be seen. It was not in vain that I established this abode of August Peace at the crossroads. The Heavenly Duke asked: Why is it so difficult for the world to attain peace and security? The divine officials of the Five Phases replied: Now, the emperor dwells within a hundredfold enclosure, separated from the four borders by ten thousand times ten thousand *li*. Those most distant suffer from deep-seated grievances, and the good and evil of their deeds cannot ascend to reach him. Wondrous methods, rare writings, and extraordinary strategies are cut off and never arrive before the emperor.\n\nThe people and ministers, bound by grievances, cannot petition or communicate. Over time, the four directions become obstructed and blocked. The worthy and learned conceal themselves, harboring their virtue and power, growing despondent until death. The emperor, deprived of their extraordinary strategies and uncommon words, cannot bring peace to the world. The great fault lies in the closure and obstruction of the distant borders on all sides.\n\nThus, in accordance with Heaven’s will, I have established this abode for the Virtuous Lord of the Dao and Great Peace at the crossroads, to gather and bring forth the finest *qi* of the Supreme August and the Tranquil Peace. I wish to delight the four directions, so that all may know the Virtuous Lord has issued these teachings. They shall rejoice as one, each bringing their good offerings and rare methods to present and return them to the throne, no matter how distant. There shall be no more obstruction.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nWithout the Master of Heaven’s inquiry, this would not be known. Yet if people truly possess the nature of Heaven, they may know it themselves—this is the highest. Those who cannot know it themselves must inquire—this is the next best.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nI humbly request to ask one more matter.\n\nSpeak.",

Sharing rank with the worthy, it resides in the domains of *ren* and *gui*, the body united with *hai* and *zi*. Circulating in mutual embrace, utmost yin gives birth to yang—this is called the First Nine.\n\nWhen the One unites to generate beings, yin halts and yang arises. Receiving bestowal in *hai*, conceiving in *ren*, it flourishes in *zi*. From child to grandchild, yang enters within yin, its generation unceasing.\n\nContemplate the outer to penetrate the inner; lifespan doubles, yet this cannot be swiftly attained—it is fitting for long duration. Lesser yang holds qi, sharing its position with the liver, in *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, and *mao*, akin to the color green. The essence of the myriad things emerges in profusion, front and back intermingling, benevolence and kindness imprinted upon the heart.\n\nWhen a valiant warrior is about to set forth, let him recite and behold these characters: his radiance shall be as the sun at its first rising. A hundred illnesses shall be cured, and his years shall increase threefold. Greater yang abounds in qi, akin to the heart, dwelling in the house of *bing* and *ding*, nurtured in the positions of *si* and *wu*. Beholding it, a hundred evils depart, and the body daily grows upright. One’s intent should be gentle and luminous—this must not be forcibly sought. To see the character is to gain longevity, its light like the brilliance of the sun at midday.\n\nThe qi of central harmony connects with the spleen, extending to the four seasons’ quarters before returning to *wu* and *ji*. Dwelling centrally in *chen* and *xu*, with *chou* and *wei* as its root, one who contemplates its meaning and follows its sequence shall cure illness. When the essence resembles the Yellow Dragon and this character is seen, disease vanishes, years increase fivefold, and people become filial and compliant. Ministers shall love their lords, and children their fathers.\n\nIn the lesser yin’s cycle, it joins with the essence of the teacher, the numinous fan exhaling qi. Its position belongs to *geng*, *xin*, *shen*, and *you*, where righteousness punishes the cunning and treacherous. Bandits shall not arise, and evil shall not harm people. When the kidneys’ abundant qi increases lifespan a hundredfold, utmost yin generates yang, and the state shall greatly prosper. Constantly contemplating it, one shall know no death.\n\nYin ascends and yang arises, thus the Dark Warrior marks the beginning. The Dragon’s virtue is born in the north yet resides in the east, thus it follows thereafter. The Vermilion Bird governs illness; the yellow qi stands at the center. When the ruler practices this, his lifespan shall be boundless. Ascending to hold balance, a hundred evils shall perish.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams reside within, spirits arrayed in ordered ranks. The White Tiger follows behind, punishing calamity and annihilating misfortune. The upright Dao arrives daily, and perverse qi vanishes. To contemplate essence without cease is the principle of extending years. If one embodies and internalizes it, what worry can there be?\n\nTo follow below what is above is called the Dao of compliance. Without fault or transgression, a myriad illnesses shall heal themselves. Reciting the characters and beholding their forms, love shall be as between father and son, bringing constant joy and boundless illumination.\n\nThose who examine and apply this shall see its effects immediately. Keep it always with the scripture, and daily wander with the spirits. The Dao follows nature, being profoundly empty and non-being. In a single day, it shall come of itself—this Dao is benevolent and good.\n\nChildren shall thereby be filial, ministers loyal and trustworthy. Those who understand it shall cherish their bodies, dare not speak recklessly, and by steadfastly guarding it, their lives shall know no end. The scripture does not emerge in vain; contemplate it in connection with the Dao. Deeply comprehend its meaning, and the spirits shall come of themselves.\n\nAt the outset, contemplate the form of the character and return to the primordial essence of the Dao. Attain spirit illumination, and nature shall be effortless. The Dao of Heaven is manifold, yet within humans it may be practiced. When the Dao accomplishes its work, how can one not refrain from wrongdoing? If people do not exert themselves, whence shall upright qi arise? To act without ascending is to daily invite good fortune and distance peril.\n\nWhen the great person practices this, the state shall know Great Peace. When the petty person practices it, calamity shall depart and blessings arrive. Contemplate its profound forms, and all pursuits shall be fulfilled. If children uphold the Dao, whence shall disorder arise?\n\nTo contemplate without cease is to attain Great Peace. With the heart undisturbed and no perverse inclinations, to guard it without cease is to daily renew life. The Dao does not emerge recklessly; it is entrusted to those with virtue and returns to its proper person.\n\n*Here ends the text on the Eight Trigrams’ Ascent to Peace and the Six Jia’s Pursuit of the Dao to Return Essence.*\n*Here ends the eighty-ninth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*The ninetieth scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace*",

      "translated_text": "**Remedy for Grievance, Disaster, and the Pursuit of Rare Methods, One Hundred Thirty-First**\n\nBefore the Perfected One, you study this. In all matters, accumulate knowledge, and you shall understand the great principles by which the world is ordered. Only then may you speak of affairs without doubt.\n\nNow, when common folk die, they cry out in great grievance, beating their breasts and calling to Heaven, casting themselves down to wail to Earth. Is this not perverse? One ought to refine the Dao with precision. Let this be recited and read for ten thousand generations as an enduring law, never to be forgotten.\n\nToday, the Celestial Master has issued stern teachings. How dare this foolish student not strive to speak a word?\n\nProceed without doubt. Yet death is a grave matter for mortals. To cry out in great grievance, beating the breast and casting oneself down, exhausting all strength in endless sorrow—this does no harm to life. But for whom should one grieve? And why grieve for all?\n\nWhen a person dies, they are utterly extinguished, reduced to ashes and dust, never to be seen again. Living between Heaven and Earth, from the time of their opening and division, each person has but one life, never to be reborn. Since the moment they were named \"human,\" they have been the foremost of all harmonious things, noble and honored, akin to Heaven and Earth. Yet with a single death, they vanish forever, through all time and space, never again to be called human, never again to rise and walk. Thus, they are mourned, and great grievance is expressed.\n\nAlas! Your words align with the vulgar, yet in truth, they are not so. This foolish student fails to grasp their meaning. What should one do when a person dies? I wish to hear it, only from the Celestial Master.\n\nNow, all things that live must come to an end. Human life, too, must end in death—this is the ordained pattern of Heaven and Earth. Yet within it, there are those who die in grievance, or who perish young before their time. Heaven and Earth, parents to all things, fear that some may die in grievance, weeping and wailing to Heaven above and knocking their heads upon the Earth below, lamenting their short years. Thus, Heaven has provided the true Dao and rare methods by which one may defend oneself and attain a modest longevity.\n\nAll living things naturally age and perish, yet foolish people refuse to diligently study the true Dao and virtuous methods. How can they slightly extend their years, delaying death and aging? Instead, they treat themselves lightly, neglecting to seek rare methods, and mock the true Dao. They turn to deception and falsehood, disrupting the Way of Heaven, deceiving their superiors, and competing to prepare burial mounds for death. They adorn and tend to these places in anticipation of death, making death pacts and inauspicious arrangements, seeking only to die. What is there to grieve?\n\nWhen one’s allotted years and fate are exhausted, it is like the sun rising and inevitably setting. Perfected One, why do you grieve for this?\n\nYour words, Perfected One, too often align with the vulgar, as if you know nothing of humanity. For whom, then, should one grieve? I wish to hear it.\n\nOne should grieve for those who die young, before they have gained any knowledge, before they have sought ways to defend themselves. Thus, they are to be grieved.\n\nOne should also grieve for those who are ever cautious and good, who fear dying young, who constantly discipline themselves, seeking the true Dao, virtuous power, and rare methods. They act with constant goodness, never harming in secret. Yet they may meet with disaster and die prematurely, or reach old age with strength exhausted, never having encountered an enlightened teacher, even for a moment, to fulfill their allotted years. These are the truly grievous cases, worthy of sorrow.\n\nBut those who grieve without cause, who do not seek rare methods or the true Dao yet die, and then beat their breasts, weep, and wail to Heaven and Earth—such people bring this upon themselves, blaming Heaven and Earth. They are rebellious people, deeply despised by Heaven.\n\nPerfected One, if you grieve for these, it would be better to mourn early for your own failure to learn the true Dao, for your ignorance of the great principles of Heaven and Earth, of yin and yang, and of the divisions of the world. Long have you suffered without an enlightened teacher, harboring sorrow as your allotted years draw to a close. This is truly lamentable. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed! This foolish student is deeply alarmed. My fate rests with the Celestial Master. I humbly beg the true Dao from you, that I may strive without ceasing. Why should the world lack it? It is only that one does not seek with sufficient diligence. If one’s sincerity moves Heaven to tears, then Heaven will not withhold it. If one does not slacken in the Dao, one shall obtain it before long. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nFoolish people do not cherish and love themselves. They do not seek rare and extraordinary methods that could grant them even a moment more of life. Instead, they prepare their funerary objects and burial places in advance, seeking death. The laws of Heaven are like those of a compassionate father, a wise mother, or a sagacious ruler—they do not deprive one of what may be sought.\n\nThis is the natural principle of seeking. If one attains what one seeks, there is no need for great grievance. Thus, the ancient sage-kings and emperors, who deeply cherished and feared death, thought day and night of seeking rare and extraordinary knowledge. They revered those who practiced the Dao, exhausting their wealth in the pursuit. Their sincerity moved the August Heaven to tears, and Heaven responded with auspicious signs. Masters of the Dao and its arts all came to their aid, enabling them to live long lives or even transcend the world.\n\nYet there were some who sought and did not obtain, for their sincerity was insufficient. They clung to worldly affairs, treating their lives lightly, believing they could be regained. Now, Heaven and Earth regard humans as their children, and emperors as the most honored of Heaven’s children. How could they not cherish the true Dao and rare methods?\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nThus, the ancient sages deeply contemplated and planned for the future. They knew that the wealth of the world is not permanently possessed. While one lives, wealth is merely entrusted to the body. When one dies, it passes to others. Therefore, there is nothing to cherish. They used their wealth to the utmost to seek the true Dao and extraordinary knowledge. Thus, their bodies endured, and their wealth remained, ever belonging to humanity.",

      "translated_text": "Therefore, one must exert utmost effort until wealth is entirely spent. Wealth is but a fleeting pursuit, obtained in an instant. To lose wealth is merely to return it to the world, for it was never truly one’s own to keep. This is what marks the wise and sagacious: they nurture the body with the Dao, understand the proper use of wealth, and thus attain long life. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. Those who would be teachers of others face many difficulties and reproaches. This Perfected One grows heavy-hearted, so let me further clarify for you and fully expound my meaning.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has its fixed principles, and it does not favor the familiar. If you wish to truly understand this, consider how after the winter solstice, the world grows bitterly cold and claims lives. Yet by the fifth month, the first signs of yin qi appear in the well’s clarity, growing stronger day by day. By the time the winter solstice arrives again, the cold becomes deadly, and one cannot survive without clothing. The wise prepare in advance and thus enjoy great joy, unharmed by the cold and free from worry. The indolent, however, who make no effort to prepare, suffer hunger and cold, falling into destitution. This is the way of things.\n\nHeaven is not at fault; it is people who bring this upon themselves. Do you now grasp this more deeply?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have awakened. The laws of Heaven do not favor the familiar on a whim; it is the foolish who recklessly provoke them. If I have not explained sufficiently, what then is the greatest grievance?\n\nThe greatest grievance is the great worthy. From youth, they study goodness, follow virtue, and possess true Dao and power. They should become the emperor’s assistants, aiding in the governance of yin and yang. If the emperor obtains such a one, he may embrace them with joy, ruling effortlessly and without care. But if such a person is obstructed and blocked, their true Dao and power persisting until old age and death, this is a grievous sorrow. Yet if the emperor fails to secure such great worthies and instead governs with the foolish, yin and yang fall into chaos, myriad calamities arise, and he toils day and night in suffering, consumed by great sorrow. This too is a profound grievance, a cause for deep lament.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, wise and far-reaching, ensured that all worthies emerged and gathered to assist above. Therefore, neither side suffered grievance. Heaven and Earth, too, were governed by them, free from affliction and sorrow—how much more so for humanity? Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nExcellent are the words of the Heavenly Master! In what way are they excellent?\n\nThis is what Heaven attains: the resolution of suffering and hardship. What the emperor attains: effortless rule without care. What the worthy attain: the full expression of their loyalty and sincerity, aiding their lord in governance, exhausting their abilities to diligently resolve the great concerns of Heaven and Earth. The myriad beings of the world also benefit and flourish. Thus, it is called excellent.\n\nExcellent are the words of the Perfected One; I have nothing to add.\n\nTherefore, all that people may seek to accomplish will not result in grievance if they attain it through their own conduct. What they seek but do not obtain becomes a great grievance. Now, if one seeks death, they obtain death; if one seeks evil, they obtain evil; if one seeks goodness, they obtain goodness. Heaven follows their heart—this is great fortune, for what is sought is attained. If one deliberately places themselves in mortal peril, making death pacts, they will indeed die. If one daily seeks misfortune, they will meet with evil and perish—this too is the case. In all false and mundane affairs, what one seeks is granted by Heaven and Earth; nothing is more grievous than this for such a person. Has the Perfected One also fully awakened to this?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have awakened. Now, I wish to thoroughly explain this for your benefit.\n\nI have already outlined the main principles for you. Reflect on their meaning and present them to the virtuous ruler of the highest Dao, showing them to all worthies. Let each exert effort in their pursuits. If they seek but do not obtain, it is because their sincerity is not yet complete.\n\nHeaven and Earth are like an echo and shadow—they do not deceive. It is the foolish who deceive themselves, belittling and neglecting their own lives. The greatest fault lies here. The multitude of fools together disrupt Heaven and Earth, not merely bringing sorrow upon themselves. Their transgressions are such that Heaven is deeply grieved.\n\nThe foolish bring this upon themselves, yet when they fall into destitution, they turn and wail to Heaven and Earth. Over time, this deeply troubles Heaven and Earth with sorrow. Thus, I have been sent down to fully explain and resolve the intentions of the world’s people, so that all worthies may clearly deliberate on my words. My words are the discourse of Heaven and Earth. I do not idly speak of these matters with the Perfected One; I convey the teachings and commands of Heaven. Let each recognize the source of their own faults and no longer blame one another.\n\nTherefore, I have spoken exhaustively. I dare not speak falsely. The reason I have spoken so thoroughly is that I alone understand the intentions of Heaven and Earth. Thus, I was sent down to discuss the world’s affairs with the Perfected One, distinguishing right from wrong, so that the virtuous ruler and the worthies may all reflect upon them. Let this be transmitted for ten thousand generations. May later generations chant and recite it as a constant law, never forgetting it.\n\nThus, whenever I see the Perfected One inquire about matters, I am always glad to resolve Heaven’s concerns, and each resolution eases its sorrow. Whenever I witness Heaven’s words, I immediately align with the intentions of Heaven and Earth, explaining and expounding them without the slightest negligence. If you have doubts, come again to discuss them. Since I have been entrusted with this mission and sent down to speak, I truly stand in awe of Heaven’s majesty and spare no effort.\n\nDo you now clearly understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nProceed. You have grasped the intentions of Heaven and Earth and should understand the affairs of life.\n\nPeople accumulate folly, failing to early study the true Dao, virtuous power, and extraordinary methods, dismissing them as trivial. They do not realize that their faults accumulate and disrupt Heaven and Earth, bringing sorrow to their emperor. Their lives are cut short by Heaven, and they do not live out their allotted years. Perfected One, ponder deeply my words. Is there any greater fault in the world than this death?\n\nExcellent, excellent! The foolish have now greatly awakened. If you awaken early, you may be called one who understands the affairs of life, avoiding misfortune and drawing near to good fortune.",
      "overlap_context": " and rare methods?\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nThus, the ancient sages deeply contemplated and planned for the future. They knew that the wealth of the world is not permanently possessed. While one lives, wealth is merely entrusted to the body. When one dies, it passes to others. Therefore, there is nothing to cherish. They used their wealth to the utmost to seek the true Dao and extraordinary knowledge. Thus, their bodies endured, and their wealth remained, ever belonging to humanity.",

Therefore, I convey these words in earnest to you—I do not speak empty words. Do you understand this yourself?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGood, you have understood. Now, the reason for collating and comparing the divine writings of high antiquity, middle antiquity, and later antiquity is this: what the divine writings of high antiquity did not address, the divine writings of later antiquity may have spoken of. By arranging them according to kind, supplementing one another, they together form a single, excellent discourse. Thus, they are assembled, and only afterward can the intent of Heaven and Earth in the divine scriptures be discerned. Do you understand this?\n\nYes, yes.",

      "translated_text": "Go, you have now understood.\n\nThus, today Heaven has sent me down to re-examine the teachings of the scriptures for the Supreme Virtue Dao Lord, and I have assembled them all. From the words of divine texts and sagely worthies down to commoners, servants, and barbarians, I have classified them by category, gathering the good from their sayings to form the *Dongji* Scripture, named *The Writ of August Heaven’s Governance of the Utmost Extremity*. Thereafter, all the ailments of Heaven and Earth will be entirely eradicated.\n\nDo you understand this, Perfected One?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Go, Perfected One, you have now awakened to the arising of affairs and have known it.\n\nHeaven has granted you longevity and raised you to the rank of Supreme Perfected One.\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nYou have attained this through your own conduct; it is not by my power. You have done good, unmatched under Heaven, and so Heaven cherishes you.\n\nI dare not, I dare not. This foolish one merely refrains from resenting Heaven—nothing more can be hoped for.\n\nIt is no deception.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI ask: in assembling these categories to follow one another, I wish to hear the essential meaning.\n\nGood indeed! Your question is profound—has Heaven moved your lips to ask it?\n\nVery well.\n\nSit at ease, and I will distinguish and explain it for you.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo—suppose we take the character *jia* as an example: it represents one matter. When presented before the assembly of wise and enlightened ones, it is fitting that all under Heaven’s written words and the sayings of the multitude be considered. Among these, there are flawless texts and flawless words. We take the best of these, those that harmonize with the hearts of the people, and gather the foremost explanations, verifying and illuminating them. What arises in accord with the people’s hearts is also in accord with the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow is this made clear? I wish to hear the essential point.\n\nNow, when people act, if their conduct is examined in their own hearts and aligns with the hearts of the multitude of sages and worthies, and all call it good, then its response will immediately accord with the heart of Heaven. If, when examined in one’s own heart, there is doubt, and when examined in the hearts of the multitude of sages and worthies—down to the hearts of petty people—it is called wrong, then it is inauspicious. Heaven will indeed respond to it with misfortune. This is the clear proof.\n\nThus, we compile these sayings into a scripture: what harmonizes with the hearts of the people is right; what does not is wrong.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nGo—all written texts and affairs have their roots. We follow these roots, aligning them with the words of the multitude of scholars, and together we explain them in this way. What harmonizes with the intentions of the people’s hearts also harmonizes with the spirits; what does not harmonize with the people’s hearts does not harmonize with the spirits.\n\nExcellent, excellent! I have heard the command.\n\nPerfected One, why do you speak of having heard the command?\n\nWhen one acts with good and upright conduct, one gains the heart of Heaven and lives. When one acts wickedly and loses the heart of Heaven, misfortune and death follow. Life and death belong to the decree of fate—hence, I speak of having heard the command.\n\nExcellent! What the Perfected One says is true; I have nothing to add.\n\nThus, when Heaven rectifies one’s words and texts, there is good fortune; when it does not, there is misfortune. Therefore, I instruct the Perfected One to collate and examine them.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThereafter, the qi of the Great Peace and Supreme August One will arise, and longevity will come forth. Yet even the words of Heaven’s texts and sagely ones have their shortcomings. Thus, the qi of the Supreme August One has been imprisoned by perverse sayings and misleading words and has never been able to come forth.\n\nSince the later opening of Heaven and Earth, the qi of the Supreme August One has never come to assist the emperors and kings in their governance.\n\nToday, Heaven wishes to fully bring it forth, and so it collates and examines the written texts.\n\nFor every perverse word, there remains one ailment; for every perverse saying or misleading text, there remains one ailment. Ten perverse words leave ten ailments; a hundred leave a hundred; a thousand leave a thousand; ten thousand leave ten thousand. The ailments follow these remaining perverse words, perverse texts, and misleading sayings.\n\nHeaven is afflicted by these ailments, and so it causes people to be afflicted as well. When people are without ailment, Heaven is without ailment. When half the people are afflicted, half of Heaven is afflicted. When all people, great and small, are afflicted, Heaven is entirely afflicted.\n\nThus, when people are made to suffer ailments, it is to awaken them—but they do not awaken, and so countless deaths follow.\n\nI wish to hear: how do perverse words, perverse sayings, and perverse texts cause Heaven to be afflicted?\n\nAlas! Why have you again sunk into darkness and ignorance?\n\nGo, sit at ease, and I will explain it to you, Perfected One.\n\nWhen perverse words and perverse texts are used to expound the scriptures and the Dao, they disorder the scriptures of the Dao. When the scriptures of the Dao are disordered, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are disordered. When the patterns of Heaven and Earth are disordered, Heaven and Earth are afflicted.\n\nThus, the Three Luminaries, winds and rains, the four seasons, and the Five Phases contend without constancy. The year becomes inauspicious, and the emperor is beset with sorrow and hardship. The officials govern in chaos, and the people suffer resentment, hunger, and cold—is this not the affliction caused by perverse texts and perverse words? If widely employed, it leads to great disorder and ungovernability.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWhen perverse texts, perverse words, and misleading sayings are used to govern the state, day by day it falls into disorder. Thus, perverse words, perverse sayings, and misleading texts deceive the ears of all, and the state is thrown into chaos and peril. Ministers distort the law and act recklessly; the people are impoverished and destitute. Together, they pollute the governance of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe heavenly officials are enraged, and their teachings are never-ending.

Hearing the words of the Heavenly Master fills one with terror and alarm. I, foolish as I am, did not deeply consider this and did not realize that such evil brings about these consequences. Truly, I have been ignorant for far too long. The common people regard it as a trivial matter and do not remove it, yet they do not know that these perverse words, perverse sayings, and perverse texts are the great enemies of Heaven and Earth, the great thieves of the state, and the fierce ghosts of the hundred clans. How can they not be entirely cast aside and strenuously eliminated?\n\nThus, Heaven cherishes rulers of supreme virtue and, fearing they may not awaken, sends down these great calamities. Therefore, I have been sent to explain this in full. True One, swiftly commit these words to writing and disseminate them, so that they may urgently ponder the will of Heaven and thereby secure their own peace. Otherwise, Heaven’s wrath will never cease.\n\nHence, Heaven no longer relies solely on the words of sages, for they alone cannot entirely eradicate this affliction. Therefore, it commands the people of the world to speak with one voice and collectively examine the ancient texts.

The greater the anger, the greater the rewards for merit. If the emperor is not enraged, he will once more investigate. Now, Heaven investigates perverse texts in this same manner.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHow fearful! The world is now set right.

The foundation of governance is unsettled, and all falls into chaos thereby.\n\nTherefore, now sever them entirely. Let all gather their words, gather their sayings, and submit their writings to determine matters of peace and stability. Then, the qi of Heaven will daily and entirely find its proper place, and perverse words, perverse sayings will daily and entirely be cut off and extinguished.

      "translated_text": "The foolish one is deeply troubled. Since you understand, there should be no need for further examination together. Yes, yes.\n\nThe foolish one falls short in every matter, bearing grave transgressions before Heaven and Earth, causing the Heavenly Master concern. Having now witnessed these perverse texts and perverse sayings—the warnings of even a single person—I wish to receive your stern admonitions once more, to the utmost clarity of true scripture’s deepest cautions.\n\nExcellent. The written word has already been compared to speech. Why do you still question this yourself?\n\nThe benighted, their hearts bound fast, even the wise cannot fathom. Without repeated clarification and stern instruction, they remain shrouded in darkness, confounding the Heavenly Master’s Dao. Thus, I dare not but ask again.\n\nExcellent are your words. Very well. Be seated, and I shall explain fully for all the assembled Perfected Ones.\n\nTrue speech, true texts, true sayings—these are the root of the proper ordering of Heaven and Earth, the treasured vessel and parents of the state’s peace, the very mandate by which all people and the myriad things receive their lives. Therefore, one must strive with all one’s strength to set them right.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nI wish to hear how true speech, true texts, and true sayings serve as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel, and the decisive mandate for all people and the myriad things.\n\nAh! Perfected One, you have heard these words time and again. In my writings, all is afflicted by the sickness of frivolous and perverse speech. Why do you now question this again?\n\nThe foolish one follows the common ways, mired in ignorance for so long that I know not where perversity ends. Without repeated, clear admonitions, I remain utterly lost.\n\nIf you truly wish to know the truth of this: when common people all speak of goodness and strive together to practice it, yet disasters are not averted, it is because perverse texts and perverse speech have caused the chaos. When common people say, “This will suffice,” yet cannot achieve goodness, but by adhering to it, they instead align with Heaven, and disasters daily recede—this is the work of true texts, true speech, and true sayings. Inwardly, they alone resonate with Heaven, bearing the clear proof of Heaven and Earth’s intent.\n\nThus, true speech and true texts reveal the very heart of the proper ordering of Heaven and Earth. When all speech is true, all texts are true, all sayings are true, and the emperor enacts them, extending to the humblest people—none fail to delight in practicing what is right. Heaven and Earth are thereby greatly set right. The four seasons, the five phases, and the myriad things—all at once find their proper place. Sun, moon, and the three luminaries keep to their courses, each attaining its proper measure. The state enjoys great peace without care, and even the spirits bestow the elixir of agelessness, while wondrous signs and good omens all emerge. Treachery, deceit, and malevolent omens all perish utterly. The common people each secure their households and fulfill their natural lifespans. The myriad things all attain long life and completion, each in its proper season.\n\nThis is the manifest efficacy of true speech, true texts, and true sayings—as the root of Heaven and Earth, the state’s treasured vessel, the parents of the people, the mandate of the myriad things.

When petitions from the three ranks of officials and commoners converge in memorials, by the eighth month, gather and review them, then divide and assign them into three sections.\n\nThe first review shall take place to the ruler’s east, where one copy is made. It shall then be passed for a second review to the ruler’s south, and a third copy made. From there, it shall be passed for a third review to the ruler’s west, where the third copy is made. After the third review, the documents shall be discarded to the ruler’s north.\n\nEach review takes place in a separate location, and they must not coincide in time. Why is this?\nWe wish to hear the reason.\nIndeed, if they were to observe one another, deceit might arise—some may conceal flaws or fabricate falsehoods, thus repeating the same deception. This would once more incur the resentment of Heaven and Earth, becoming the state’s greatest traitor.\n\nHeaven and Earth detest such men, yet they employ emperors and kings to govern disorder. Therefore, they separate the reviews into three distinct places, ensuring that the three reviews collectively verify the truth. This is to resolve Heaven’s intent and secure the governance of the kingly ruler.\n\nWhy must the first review begin to the ruler’s east?\nThe east is where Heaven’s qi holds intention and benevolence. Those who review the source of affairs must apply careful thought, diligent effort, and benevolence to align with Heaven and Earth, ever mindful of bringing peace to the emperor and king. Thus, the review begins in the east.\n\nBenevolence is to be enacted, and so one must scrutinize clearly—hence the transmission to the ruler’s south. After clear scrutiny, one must judge and eliminate with righteousness. Those with merit shall have their merits recorded; those without merit shall have their lack of merit recorded, forming the basis of their conduct.\n\nThe final records shall be stored in the ruler’s north, placed in a secluded chamber. Thus, the conduct of all under Heaven is known, and the distinction between good and evil is never lost.\n\nTherefore, when the virtuous ruler acts accordingly, he is called a great divine person, fully seated in knowledge of the hearts of all under Heaven and all changes and movements of anomalies.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nHow profound!

      "translated_text": "\"May I ask: if one inadvertently omits or errs in a matter, should they receive thirty strokes of the rod as proper punishment?\"\n\nExcellent is your question. Did Heaven prompt your words?\n\nIndeed, numbers begin with one and conclude at ten. This error of omission in one matter thus concerns the very root of the question of one. Omission and error, if not truthful, become deceit—then they become Heaven’s resentment and Earth’s reproach, the great thieves of the state.\n\nTen strokes are to make amends to Earth; ten strokes are to make amends to the Emperor and the Kings. Heaven, Earth, and humanity each receive ten, totaling thirty. These strokes serve to atone for the transgression, to dissolve Heaven’s resentment and Earth’s reproach, and to absolve the offense against the Emperor and the Kings. Thus, Heaven and Earth rejoice, and the spirits and deities cease their wrath.\n\nThe reason Heaven and Earth are often in turmoil and the spirits and deities grow wrathful lies fundamentally in the failure to verify documents and the prevalence of careless, erroneous speech among people—hence the arising of these calamities and the burden of inherited misfortune. If such carelessness persists, then punishment by the rod is warranted, not because of personal favor, but to rectify the matter.\n\nNow, having convened to deliberate, if the facts are thoroughly examined and the upper record is confirmed, it shall be marked as correct above. If the lower record is likewise confirmed, it shall be marked as correct below. Thus, both upper and lower are deemed true. If only the lower is confirmed while the upper remains unverified, it is of no benefit. If only the upper is confirmed while the lower remains unverified, it is likewise of no benefit. Only when both upper and lower are verified is Heaven’s qi balanced.\n\nIf the lower is true but the upper is not, the upper wrongs the lower, and the lower, though innocent, finds its efforts toward goodness futile—Heaven’s wrath arises again. If the upper is true but the lower is not, the lower wrongs the upper—Earth’s wrath arises again. Only when both upper and lower are entirely verified, yet the Emperor and the Kings fail to govern with impartiality, do the spirits of the four seasons, five phases, six relations, and the qi of the six ancestral temples grow restless, and inharmonious qi stirs once more.\n\nEven if one strives to circulate documents through the three Dao, rectifying the words and writings of the world, if one does not govern with diligence, such efforts are in vain. Therefore, I, in accordance with the heart of Heaven, enact transformation for the August Virtuous Ruler, daring not to lose Heaven’s intent. Thus, I fully adhere to Heaven’s law, taking the images of Heaven and Earth as the warp, following the yang as the standard, and aligning with the four seasons and five phases as the ordinance—unchanging for ten thousand generations.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed.\n\nThis humble student has awakened with reverence and holds Heaven’s law in great awe.\n\nKnowing such awe, you are already destined for great fortune. This is a crucial admonition for the Perfected One.\n\nRegarding the method of verifying documents: do not merely speak of their divine script, but examine their written content. If one asserts that such-and-such is true, this is called \"deaf script.\" Does speech alone lack a foundation? How can one claim thus?\"",

If one does not explain the meaning, how can understanding be attained? Thus, one must ask for the resolution of their intent; otherwise, they cannot be employed—this is called \"deaf governance.\"\n\nDo you wish to delight in knowing their intent? It is like human speech, which must have a foundation, a source from which it arises. One cannot merely say, \"Eastern Lord so-and-so spoke thus to establish matters.\" Those who verify and establish matters all have a basis—how can they idly fabricate empty words? Therefore, in all matters, one must rely on actual evidence to establish them.\n\nDo you wish to know their great efficacy and clear proof? Consider how I, for the Virtuous Ruler, established transformative laws—all were tested and found responsive, serving as proof of their words. If enacted and unresponsive, they are false words; if enacted and unresponsive, they are contrary to Heaven. Truly, written words and speech are like this—how can one idly establish proof and speak without explanation?\n\nFoolish people may stubbornly cling, asking, \"Why are the divine scriptures and words like this?\" They are merely words to resolve difficulties and rebut exhaustion. What grandeur do divine scriptures possess? They may have intent, but merely transmitting their words does not reside in a single volume. Transmitted alone, explained from afar, people do not deeply grasp their essential meaning, instead using them only to rebut difficulties and rescue exhaustion, saying, \"Eastern Lord spoke thus for so long,\" to justify themselves—this is truly not so. All have lost the meaning of the explanation.\n\nThus, the words of the Dao and virtue cannot be thoroughly understood—all because of this.

Therefore, when examining my writings, scrutinizing texts and human words, always inquire into their intent. How can one grasp their explanations? By gathering them according to their kind.

Proceed—my Dao is revealed herein. Perfected One, reflect upon this from beginning to end, mutually verifying and clarifying, and nothing will remain unresolved. All matters under Heaven will be complete, the Great Dao attained, Heaven and Earth pleased, and the Virtuous Ruler eternally secure. All under Heaven will speak with one voice, saying, \"Excellent!\" No longer will they speak of Heaven’s governance, for they will have regained the intent of Heaven and Earth—thus, it is called peace.

These are the great resentments of Heaven and Earth—when Heaven and Earth engage in unseen struggle, their signs manifest in the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, eclipses may occur, or they may not; the fault lies in the clash of yin and yang qi.\n\nWhy do they clash?\n\nYin and yang deceive each other, vying for dominance. By nature, yin and yang should alternately aid and protect one another, together forming harmonious qi. Yet they turn to struggle—all fault lies in this disharmony.\n\nIf they were harmonious, would there be no eclipses?\n\nIndeed. In the most virtuous eras of remote antiquity, eclipses never occurred. But as later generations increasingly lost the intent of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang gradually ceased to cherish one another, leading to their struggle.\n\nIf you doubt my words, let the Virtuous Ruler examine and practice my teachings. When their full meaning is grasped, the struggle will cease; when partially understood, it will partially cease; when half-grasped, it will half cease. Without diligent practice, the distress will persist.\n\nSomeone asked: When do the sun and moon eclipse—what celestial movements cause their convergence?\n\nAlas, how foolish you are! Perfected One, you risk provoking Heaven’s wrath again. How do you presume to know of \"celestial movements\"?\n\nThis foolish student observes their conjunction.\n\nHow profoundly benighted your mind is—how utterly dark! If we follow your reasoning, it is merely a matter of celestial movements converging.\n\nThen why, within a single year, do the sun and moon eclipse without respite? Or why, for years on end, do they not eclipse at all? How do celestial movements explain this? When the Emperor’s virtue flourishes, the sun and moon do not eclipse, and the stars do not fall into disorder—how do celestial movements account for this?\n\nMoreover, yin and yang naturally coexist and should cherish one another—why do they harm each other instead? By nature, they should alternately generate and complete one another—why do they turn to mutual destruction?\n\nYou are truly foolish. If you wish to know the truth, consider the analogy of people. When those who have long been close meet after a long separation, their joy is boundless—they aid, benefit, praise, and honor one another. But when those who have never been close suddenly meet, they fight at once. If the enmity is great, they fight to the death; if slight, they brawl briefly.\n\nHow terrifying!

      "translated_text": "Pray, I ask: the sun is the essence of fire, belonging to yang, while the moon is the essence of water, belonging to yin. Now, water and fire do not share the same dwelling—when they meet by chance, they extinguish each other. What does this mean? Are they not akin?\n\nExcellent! Your words grasp the intent. Yet water and fire, each following their own Dao and abiding by their course, may harmonize and together establish merit and accomplish deeds—just as the Five Phases cannot lack a single one, for they alternately generate and complete one another. If you wish to know the truth of this, consider the Five Viscera dwelling together within the human abdomen. The heart is fire, the kidneys are water—how could they share the same place yet daily engage in battle and mutual consumption? Do you now understand or not?\n\nIndeed, indeed. This foolish student has awakened.\n\nThus, when the qi of harmony arrives, the Three Luminaries no longer contend or eclipse. Only when the Three Luminaries do not consume one another can one begin to speak of attaining the heart of Heaven and Earth—this serves as proof. Therefore, if you wish to know your own excellence or deficiency and practice the Dao and virtue, yet fail to observe this celestial evidence, gathering instead a multitude of texts that speak of mutual consumption in shared dwelling—such works merely record the words of mutual affection without deeply grasping their meaning. Even if divine texts exist, Heaven has not yet fully revealed their true essence. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. Go forth—you have awakened. After my text is revealed, may virtuous emperors and kings ponder this celestial intent and never forget these words, for they are the means to attain the heart of Heaven. If one aligns with the intent of Heaven, one’s mandate will be long and whole. If one fails to align with Heaven’s intent, the Gate of Mandate falls into chaos. To act without accord with the heart of Heaven is also a great calamity. From the earliest antiquity, the sagely emperors and kings have taken this as their warning, deeply inscribing my words within their hearts, so that subtle words may be seen and the Dao attained. I entrust this to the most virtuous of rulers, to save the Three Luminaries from their battles and eclipses.\n\nIndeed, indeed. Go now. This minor discourse is complete; if doubts remain, return to ask again.\n\n**Secret of the Primordial Fire and Primordial Qi of the Twelve Thousand States, One Hundred Thirty-Fourth**\n\nPray, I ask: the world shares the same sun and moon, the same Dipper and Pole Star. One great division comprises twelve thousand states, the central division eighty-one domains, further divided into smaller parts, each a single state. Those of superior virtue expand their territory to twelve thousand *li*; next, ten thousand *li*; then nine thousand, eight thousand, seven thousand, six thousand, five thousand, four thousand, three thousand, two thousand, and one thousand *li*. Then five hundred *li*, then one hundred *li*. These mark the lands of middling virtue, where excellence and deficiency manifest in their expansion and preservation. Those of inferior virtue may possess not a single level plot of land, all plagued by afflictions and transformations, causing the sun and moon of a single state to contend and eclipse. Among the twelve thousand states, are they all eclipsed? When the Dipper and Pole Star dim, do all twelve thousand states likewise dim?\n\nExcellent, profound, distant, and subtle—such is your question! Why do you ask specifically about this transformation? If one state experiences change, why should the twelve thousand states all be praised, yet some still undergo transformation? I feared that without the Celestial Master’s inquiry, this would remain unknown through all ages—thus I ask.\n\nExcellent! Your doubt truly enters the Dao. When one state undergoes change, only that state’s sun dims, called an eclipse. Neighboring states may witness it from afar, but distant states remain uneclipsed. When the Dipper and all stars dim, only those that have lost Heaven’s intent grow dim, while distant ones remain uneclipsed. Now I ask: what barrier obscures them, causing them alone to dim?\n\nAlas, you remain as an unopened child, like the common folk! Consider this: Heaven and Earth are vastly distant. In a state that has lost the Dao and lacks virtue, perverse qi rises to obscure and veil the heavens. The Three Luminaries, each following their kind upward, are thus dimmed. It is like a place shrouded in mist—there, the Three Luminaries alone grow dim, while mistless places remain brightly lit. If you wish to know further, consider how in yin places only the moon’s eclipse is unseen, while in yang places only the sun’s eclipse is seen. If you wish to know the truth of this, consider this year when Jupiter resides in *Zi*: virtuous states alone enjoy prosperity, while virtueless states suffer calamity. Though they share the same state and the same year, their fortune and misfortune differ—just as people share the same Heaven and Earth, yet their peace or peril, customs and conditions, vary.

      "translated_text": "Pray, I ask: when drought and frost cause all to perish, when the people suffer from hunger and cold, perishing in agony—what is this slaying? This is the slaying of August Heaven and the Great Yang, for the Six Yangs are all resentful and thus able to bring harm.\n\nWhat does this mean? I wish to hear it.\n\nIndeed, when the Six Myriads reach their utmost extreme, their great rigidity all resents humanity’s prolonged disorder and evil, hence the killing. How does this harm people?\n\nIt has no name. It merely encounters the extreme of inherited burdens, when Heaven’s wrath erupts, making no distinction between the good and evil of people—those who encounter it meet great misfortune.\n\nDo you wish to know the truth of it? Compare it to a man: when a man is seized by great rage, he may vent his fury upon a good person, not sparing them, but instead harming others at random. Now, what fault have those others committed? Yet they encounter his outburst. Heaven’s wrath erupts in the same way.\n\nThus, the responsibility of inherited burdens is most severe, causing people to die without distinction between good and evil. The great fault lies here.\n\nTherefore, my scripture follows Heaven’s teaching, now seeking to decisively sever the burden of inherited responsibility. Heaven’s transgressions run deep and heavy, harming many innocent people—Heaven sorely laments this. Thus, it commands me to instruct the Perfected Ones, entrusting this scripture to a ruler of supreme virtue, that wicked, deceitful, and false people may be cut off, and Heaven’s Dao made upright.\n\nDo you understand?

      "translated_text": "I humbly inquire: since the opening of Heaven and Earth, why have people perished entirely from raging epidemics, or been utterly destroyed by floods, or annihilated by warfare? What transgressions have they committed to deserve such fates? Are these merely the conjunctions of Heaven and Earth? Or are they the calamities of inherited burdens?\n\nYet in ancient and modern texts, many explain these as the meetings of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang—this is incorrect. All such disasters are the calamities of inherited burdens.\n\nWhen Heaven’s qi is in harmony, but its anger arises, and the spirits engage in battle, those who die from raging epidemics are struck down by Heaven’s punishment. Those who perish in floods are struck down by Earth’s punishment. Those who die by warfare are struck down by human punishment.\n\nI wish to understand: why are those who die from raging epidemics killed by Heaven? Heaven governs the spirits and presides over the chiefs of the divine. Thus, it commands the spirits and ghosts to slay people. Earth is the humble aspect of yin, and water is the most intense aspect of yin. That which belongs to Earth’s yin governs the gestation of all things. When gestation is harmed, it must become blood—blood being of the same kind as water. When gestation is harmed, it inevitably stirs anger and displeasure, further spreading its polluted blood to injure others.\n\nWater is the blood and veins of Earth, the yin of Earth. When yin is humbled and enraged, it must engage in battle to kill people. This is like a minister who goes forth to capture bandits, necessarily acting with his own body to apprehend them. He cannot remain like a lord, merely speaking from his place.\n\nThe harmonious is humanity, which governs the four seasons and the five phases in shared rule. People should act in harmony and accord, but when they lose the Dao and fail to follow it, their anger arises. Thus, the qi of the four seasons rebels, and the five phases engage in battle, causing people to attack one another. All this stems from Heaven and Earth’s harmonious qi growing angry and displeased, accumulating illness and distress over time, leading to these outcomes.\n\nExcellent! Had you not pressed with such forceful inquiry, there would be no way to know this. I wish to understand: if these are all calamities of inherited burdens, arising from the anger of the three qi, then in times without inherited burdens, how do people die?\n\nPeople are born with a natural end; the high, the low, and the middling each fulfill their allotted years. Some attain the true Dao and thereby transcend the world—such people bear no fault of inherited burdens, for this is the natural way.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Just as the qi of the four seasons ought only to succeed one another in generation and transmission, passing along in turn. Just as in human life, the young will later grow old, alternating and passing along in succession. They ought not engage in Daoist strife and warfare, thereby extinguishing the generations of the world. The reason for Daoist warfare—where floods, droughts, epidemics, and death exhaust all—is that the lord of men, following the former kings and ancestors, gradually loses the mind and intent of the Dao. Over time, this accumulates until the juncture arrives, whereupon he fails to measure himself and thus perishes utterly, leaving no remnant kind. Now, the three norms of Heaven, Earth, and Man rely upon one another to stand and take form through mutual dependence. It is like a person having head, feet, belly, and body—if one norm is destroyed, the three norms all collapse in ruin. If a person lacks head, feet, or belly, and one part is lost, then all three are in peril. Thus, when the great Dao suffers great ruin, the three norms of Heaven and Earth perish, plunging all into darkness and confusion, and the myriad things thereby perish as well. Once things are exhausted, they cannot suddenly regenerate. From this, consider how much is lost, how much is extinguished—sometimes recovery comes swiftly, sometimes great ruin endures for a long time before restoration is possible. Thus, minor destruction allows for swift recovery.\n\nIf you wish to know this in greater certainty, so that virtuous lords of later generations may clearly perceive the great effects of Heaven and Earth’s grievances—it is like a household managing its livelihood. Those with abundant stores, though they encounter the misfortune of successive lean years, endure securely. A household with vast reserves, even if it suffers bad harvests for years on end, still survives. A household with modest stores, if it meets successive years of failure, starves to extinction. A perpetually impoverished household, if it meets a single bad year, perishes utterly, unable to measure itself and escape, thus trapped without posterity.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven has its fixed laws; its revolutions are not mere junctures of chance. It is like summer and autumn, when one must exert effort to harvest, and winter and spring, when one must live on stored provisions. If summer and autumn do not diligently gather, winter and spring will bring starvation and extinction. The ancient sages, in their celestial writings, thus recorded these junctures. The Perfected One wishes to know it thus.\n\nNow, as the qi of Great Peace arrives, it should remain perpetually balanced, and there ought to be no more junctures of death and extinction. Heaven commands the emperor to govern, and thus awakens the virtuous lord. All the people, in following the Dao and its affairs, must be made to glimpse and awaken to this truth. Had the former generations of common people constantly upheld the essential Dao and essential virtue, even if they encountered such junctures, they would not have perished. The method by which Heaven commands the emperor to govern the state is this: to possess virtue and power is the greatest wealth, while to lack virtue and power is the greatest poverty and distress. Those called \"without Dao and without virtue\" are those who cannot stabilize Heaven and Earth and thus lose them.\n\nThe former generations gradually abandoned and severed virtue and power, accumulating over time until they passed on their burdens to later generations. Those born afterward suffered their grievances, poisons, and calamities, all responding to governance without Dao. When the revolutions reached the point of extinction, they could not extricate themselves—the great fault lies here. Do you understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed. How dreadful! How dreadful!",

      "translated_text": "Go now, and I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another teaching.\n\nThe Dao and virtue are to humanity as the heart is to Heaven. Just as a person possesses a heart, if the human heart faithfully upholds the Dao, it will constantly dwell in fortune; if the human heart turns to evil and abandons the Dao, it will constantly decline into misfortune. When the spirit of the heart departs, death follows. Thus, when the essential Dao and virtue are severed, people perish, and Heaven and Earth likewise fall into chaos and ruin.\n\nTherefore, the Dao causes Heaven, Earth, and humanity to share the same concerns and the same affairs, enabling them to mutually generate and complete one another. If they do not share the same concerns and affairs, they will refuse to mutually generate and complete one another. They are bound together in mutual concern and mutual benefit, and thus the Dao and virtue link them, making their destinies one.\n\nFor this reason, when Heaven and Earth behold people practicing the Dao and virtue in goodness, they rejoice greatly; when they see people doing evil, they grow furious and indignant. Does the Perfected One understand this?\n\nIndeed, indeed. How dreadful! This foolish one greatly fears it.\n\nIf you know to fear it, then you may attain long life without misfortune. If you do not know to fear it, then Heaven has already begun to turn away from you. You ought to be deeply cautious.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo now, and I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another explanation.\n\nThe course of fortune and misfortune may be likened to the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness on the one hand, and to punishments on the other. If people uphold the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness, then punishments will not arise. If they lose the Dao, virtue, ritual propriety, and righteousness, then punishments will emerge.\n\nThus, those who uphold the good Dao find the path of misfortune naturally severed; it departs without being taught to leave. Those who follow the path of misfortune find the way of speech naturally cut off. This is like the sun rising and the stars fleeing, or the stars appearing and the sun setting—without the slightest deviation.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow I reveal to the Perfected One a great esoteric teaching. The people of this age accumulate ignorance and darkness to an extreme degree, passing down warnings to one another that the cycles of time bring fortune and misfortune. If this is so, what benefit is there in doing good? What harm is there in doing evil? If the cycles of time are natural, what use is there in striving to do good?\n\nYet those who attain fortune are the sages who constantly align with the heart of Heaven, teaching people to do good—this is correct. Those who speak of cycles of time as reversing and thereby disrupting the Dao of Heaven utter words that cause Heaven and Earth to remain perpetually displeased. It is human conduct that brings this about, yet they blame the cycles of time for turning evil, refusing to acknowledge their own wrongdoing and instead accusing Heaven and Earth of being evil.\n\nThis is like a wicked and unfilial child in a household who refuses to admit his own faults and instead accuses his parents of being evil—this is precisely the case. Thus, Heaven is constantly afflicted, seething with anger and resentment. Because of this, the cycles of time bring about their destruction and conflict, delighting in the transformation of their kind.\n\nIf this were not so, the old would depart in their time, the young would grow, and each would reach the end of their allotted years and undergo transformation. This is like the changes in human form since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nExcellent! This foolish one has gained a great understanding: though the forms of people past and present differ, their *qi* remains the same.\n\nIf you wish to know this in greater depth, consider the *qi* of the four seasons and the positions of the Five Phases. Though their receptions differ, internally they share the same *qi*, mutually generating and completing one another. This is like the head and feet of a person, which do not resemble each other yet internally unite to form a single being.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nNow I shall further enlighten the Perfected One with another teaching.\n\nHeaven has accumulated illness because people do evil and perversely claim that the cycles of time are inauspicious. When the *qi* of the Supreme August arrives, it should assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Yet I fear that the people of this age will not change their conduct, persisting in evil deeds that disrupt the correct *qi*, destroying Heaven’s treasures. Therefore, I have been sent down to produce writings for the virtuous ruler, to enlighten the multitude and cause them to constantly follow my texts in their conduct, no longer troubling Heaven and Earth or violating Heaven’s prohibitions.\n\nFrom this point onward, practice my celestial texts, and the spirits will assist the virtuous ruler in governance. Those who violate them will be punished; if people do not punish them, the spirits will. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. I dare not violate them.\n\nGo now, our discourse is nearly complete.

Fire is the heart, and the heart governs the spirit. Harmony may serve as the origin of transformation; all matters that will flourish arise from the heart. The heart governs correct affairs, relying on benevolence to bring illumination, and in turn possesses divine radiance. Though the twelve thousand states’ strategies differ, they are unified in serving as documents for presenting petitions on high. Heaven’s *qi* will naturally follow and circulate—you, Perfected One, must rouse yourself to enact them. Do not oppose this, or you will perish. It is because Heaven delights in issuing these writings that I have been sent to speak. If you do not believe my words, seek verification in your own person. If you practice them, disasters will daily diminish—this is Heaven’s joy in their enactment, and thus disasters recede. If you do not practice them and suffer many illnesses and calamities, it is because Heaven is enraged and grieved, and you obstruct the Dao’s path. Fire is perilous—do not question others about it, but seek proof here, as clear as the sun and moon. Whatever Heaven intends to do, you must not be careless. To fail to act or comply will cause the hearts of people to fall into chaos. Perfected One, be cautious.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\n\"Go now, and let me admonish you once more. If Heaven does not wish it done, yet you alone persist, you will invite illness. My texts take this as their verification; from this point onward, it shall always be so.

These disasters and illnesses are not the fault of people of this generation alone—their origins are ancient and distant. Do not seek to eradicate them hastily; simply follow the Heavenly Dao to dissolve and eliminate them. In this way, you will be said to have attained the heart and intent of Heaven. If you do not follow my texts’ instructions and instead impose harsh punishments, disasters will multiply daily, and Heaven will not be pleased.

Why does the Heavenly Master now uniquely command the Fire Phase to rectify the Divine Dao?\n\nExcellent, your question! Thus it is: a hundred people have a hundred intentions, a thousand people have a thousand intentions, ten thousand people have ten thousand intentions—each employs different strategies, each diverges from the others, and so most fail to attain the heart and intent of Heaven.\n\nThe Perfected One speaks truly.\n\nNow, Fire qi is at its most flourishing, and the qi of the Supreme Sovereign arrives, yet the common follow in its wake. After the Fire Phase achieved the qi of Great Peace in ancient times, there has been nothing like it since the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhy must the Fire qi in its flourishing state rectify the Divine Dao? I wish to hear your intent.\n\nAh! Fire is the heart of Heaven. The heart governs the spirit; when the heart is rectified, the spirit becomes luminous. Thus Heaven has sent me down to govern the Divine Dao.\n\nYet the Divine Dao is inherently divine—why must it be governed?\n\nExcellent, your words! The spirit is Heaven’s upright official. Now, with many wayward spirits, the true spirits cannot hold their proper places. The Divine Dao within Heaven is thrown into great chaos, and all lose their proper abodes.\n\nNow, Heaven’s qi is unbalanced, and the Emperor-Kings are distressed and afflicted, while people fail to grasp its essential intent. You wish to delight in knowing its principles—this is like humanity itself. Now, many wicked people occupy positions of power, collectively disrupting the Emperor-King’s governance. When upright people cannot hold their proper places, Heaven and Earth lose their rectitude to wayward qi.\n\nWhen the wayward are many, they jointly harm the upright; when the upright are many, they jointly suppress the wayward—these two are the natural arts of Heaven and Earth. Do you understand?\n\nThus, the Supreme Yang has never been as flourishing as it is now. Yang is called \"spirit,\" and so Heaven is spirit. Yin is called \"wayward,\" and so perverse qi always moves in the midst of Yin, never daring to act openly in broad daylight. If perversity acts openly in broad daylight, it is called \"Yin usurping the Yang path.\" When illness arises in daylight, it is called \"Yin flourishing and rising,\" signifying that Yang has lost its Dao, and the ruler’s decline has persisted for too long.\n\nThus, Heaven’s Dao has me rectify the Divine Dao, so that such things dare not occur again.

      "translated_text": "\"Yes, yes. Excellent, excellent.\n\n**The One Hundred Thirty-Sixth Perfected Formula of the Utmost Primordial Qi’s Supreme Equilibrium: The Absence of Vermin**\n\nMay I ask: When the Utmost Primordial Qi’s Supreme Equilibrium arrives, there is nothing it does not govern—thus, the Heavenly Master examined the sores, scabies, and vermin that consume people. Is this the sole means of verification? What of the other vermin?\n\nExcellent indeed, Perfected One, that you ask this today. Is Heaven instructing you to inquire thus? Heaven abhors the wickedness of men—cunning officials and wayward people turn their backs on Heaven and defy Earth, jointly deceiving their superiors. They lurk in the shadows, accumulating perversity over time, like vermin devouring a person. Heaven loathes this, and so it compels you to ask these questions repeatedly.\n\nNow, vermin consuming people—this is what is meant by 'vermin governing men.' Such calamities are the most severe and grievous, for they are perverse qi disrupting the upright. With the advent of the August Equilibrium Qi, such manifestations should not occur.\n\nPerfected One, you have been entrusted by the Virtuous Lord of the Great Peace to understand the thorough harmony of the Dao. Why, then, have the names of the vermin masters in the realm not all been altered—those great and small entities that bring harm? The sores, plagues, and scabies, all belonging to the three vermin within the abdomen, have had their master-names shifted. Where these shifts are most numerous, the lower regions are firmly governed by vermin. Where no such vermin exist, the lower regions are free of their governance. Where they are few, few vermin govern men.\n\nExcellent! Though I am but a humble and ignorant student, I once believed this to be the natural order of Heaven—was my response not one of governance?\n\nYou are foolish indeed—why this intense pain? The nature of Heaven and Earth holds humanity as most noble and vermin as most base. Yet here they devour men together—this is a reversal of the upright, a sign of the ignoble ruling without the Dao, using vermin to consume people. Thus, Heaven perceives this omen clearly and commands the sagely to devise strategies to restore the upright.\n\nAll calamities and anomalies manifest according to their kind, which is how the sages of old came to understand them. Without categorizing by type, they could not be contemplated or countered. Those that conceal themselves within do so like subordinates jointly engaging in perversity, yet daring not to appear outwardly. The external is Yang—Yang is Heaven, the ruler, the true Emperor of Heaven. Thus, vermin fleeing inward to secretly consume people mirror the officials without merit who hide within and secretly devour the people like silkworms. How terrifying! I, a foolish student, am deeply afraid.\n\nYou are right to fear Heaven—this is proper. Had you not feared Heaven, you would have perished long ago. Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, in ancient times, governance was achieved thus: those who were spirit-like summoned true spirits to govern; those who were ghost-like summoned ghosts to govern; those who were thing-like summoned things to govern; and those who were vermin-like governed through vermin. What was there to fear?\n\nI wish to hear more.\n\nIndeed: those who are spirit-like act in harmony with Heaven’s will and in accord with the spirits’ intent. Thus, the spirit-like are Heaven’s agents, and Heaven cherishes them. Those who are ghost-like act by evading human notice, clinging to the Yin realm, whispering in secret like ghosts. Thus, those who summon ghostly entities act by jointly deceiving their superiors, cunning as things—hence, summoning things. Those who are vermin-like act by valuing profit for themselves, jointly profiting at their superiors’ expense, their intentions disordered—thus, summoning vermin.\n\nHeaven’s transformations respond accordingly, all in this manner. The Virtuous Lord of the Great Peace, having received the celestial writings of the realm, thoroughly traced the intentions behind calamities and anomalies to report them—his actions were truly spirit-like!\n\nExcellent, excellent.

      "translated_text": "How do you know this? By witnessing the Celestial Master’s rectitude, I know that never again will vermin consume people—thus, harmony is achieved. You may be said to have grasped the intent of the Dao.\n\nMay I ask: what do these repeated characters govern? They govern the guiding of rectitude. Guiding rectitude opens the spirit, for contemplation is their purpose. When one reaches the chamber’s threshold, they serve as a protective contract—how is this done?\n\nWould you hear of it? It is easily understood yet profoundly subtle; these words are light in form but weighty in meaning and must not be recklessly transmitted. Those of refined essence who ingest them are called spirit-like; those lacking refinement who ingest them are called unspirit-like. Those without refinement who ingest them speak reckless words. Thus, the Dao is transmitted only to the proper person and enacted; all affairs are illuminated only when entrusted to the right person. To transmit to the unworthy is reckless action, and the fault returns to the transmitter. Do you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed—I dare not act recklessly. I sincerely entrust it to the proper person. Thus, I speak of it to you.\n\nTake cinnabar as the character, placing the highest first, then proceeding downward to instruct others. One must bathe, purify the essence, and face north, west, south, or east to receive it. They must be solemn, offering fine wine as if it were pure water to drink. Then, contemplating the character, they make it their lifelong practice. Daily, at the hour of *zhengping*, when the virtuous qi arrives, illness is dispelled, and the complexion grows ever more lustrous. If one visualizes the character where the ailment resides, it is called \"returning essence to nourish the form.\" Even those without illness who practice this daily grow increasingly tranquil.\n\nIf one harbors strong malevolent spirits or demonic entities, they may resist and contend, raging as before—yet one must steadfastly contemplate without wavering. In time, they will be subdued and depart. Thereafter, Heaven delights in human uprightness. Using other texts in this way, celestial spirits will also aid those below, moving as human intention directs.\n\nThe superior person, seeing others ingest the character, returns to contemplate likewise. Each who ingests a character can teach others. Thus it is said: the Dao of Heaven moves in a single day. My Way does not imitate mere words but establishes resonance with the Dao of Heaven, harmonizing like an echo—this is what it means to be spirit-like. Perfected One, be cautious.\n\nHaving opened the celestial spirit-way, it returns to the Virtuous Lord, who entrusts it to the worthy and good. People stand upright of their own accord, benefiting the clarity of governance above. The Virtuous Lord, as the enlightened master, instructs with awe-inspiring solemnity. All he teaches is thereby made efficacious, and all spirits witnessed must not be spoken of.\n\nThrough this, the superior person attains deliverance from the world, the middling attains non-action, and the lesser attains steadfastness. What each receives varies in depth, for celestial spirits decree it through talismanic writings. Thus, it is said: do not transmit it, for the contemplation must not differ. Difference makes it impossible to discuss. How true and easy—this is the Dao! How essential and concise—this is the aspiration for longevity!\n\nBy studying it, one naturally aligns, naturally improves, and gains spirit clarity. The heart’s intent shifts, bringing joy. Today, one may ingest my character; later, they may teach others using different texts. Teaching ten, a hundred, a thousand—all respond accordingly. The Dao operates in an instant, circulating through the eight directions and the six conjunctions, with spirit and essence following to heal illness.\n\nFrom this point onward, all under Heaven will early rectify their conduct, delighting in true texts and no longer engaging in deceit or falsehood. Perfected One, if you wish to bring peace to the Dao of Heaven and Earth and swiftly rectify illness, place the Three Dao Conduct Writs foremost.\n\nI wish to hear of the foremost writ. Excellent is your inquiry. The foolish are difficult to rectify—like treating chaos with disorder, it grieves the Virtuous Lord. Thus, the Conduct Writs are presented first, causing all, from high to low, great to small, to correct one another. Common folk are spared the harm of solitary words and contentious scholars.\n\nExcellent, excellent! I wish to hear of the Three Dao Conduct Writs. Why not simply compile a single writ to submit, rather than using many texts with fore and after?\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your words align with Heaven’s intent. The reason for fore and after, for difficult questions, is to make common folk deeply aware of their faults. The great illness of solitary speech is this: without seeing the evil of isolated words and single texts, one cannot recognize the goodness of compiled writs. Without transmitting their errors and distinguishing their grave faults, all remain unresolved in heart—only then can they be saved. If the heart is unresolved, one does not know their own conduct, and grave errors persist. When the heart awakens, rectification comes easily.\n\nAll my texts are like this—not only these. Do you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed. Proceed—you have grasped it. Perfected One, be cautious in affairs. The texts are sufficient; do not lightly ask repeated questions. I wished not to explain further, fearing it would disappoint you, yet I will speak again.\n\nNow, the great text of the Dao—and the Dao of Heaven cannot be exhausted in phrases.

Yet there is a doubt I cannot resolve—may I inquire of one matter?\n\nSpeak.\n\nToday, the Heavenly Master has collated the various formulaic sayings: those with ten out of ten cures are formulas by which the celestial spirits treat; those with nine out of ten cures are formulas by which the terrestrial spirits treat; those with eight out of ten cures are formulas by which the human spirit treats.

Yet Heaven sees your earnest and single-minded devotion, and so allows you to come and ask these matters.\n\nNow, in a woman’s conception, the yin is fundamentally hollow and empty. Only when yang comes to bestow and transform does it take substance within yin. Yin, being lowly and submissive, fears yang and nourishes it obediently, not daring to cast it away.\n\nYang is Heaven, the ruler; yin is Earth, the minister. Thus, yin reveres and honors yang’s bestowal, nurturing it and not daring to abandon it.\n\nIf you wish to know its truth, compare it to a lord who entrusts a guest to a humble household. The household nourishes the guest and does not dare send him away, and so the guest grows robust and attains full stature—this is precisely the same principle.\n\nThe common saying that “yang generates and yin completes” means only that yin follows and nourishes, bringing yang’s substance to fruition. My writings often explain it in terms of nurturing—this is how it is.\n\nI see that you, Perfected One, delight in knowing the kernel of the true Dao, the utmost essential meaning of Heaven. Therefore, I have spoken to you of its essentials.\n\nDo you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nGo on, you have awakened.\n\nNow I wish to ask: only humans have male and female—can this distinguish the substance of yin and yang?

Excellent, Perfected One, your questioning is profound.\n\nNow, the nature of Heaven and Earth applies to all things. Let me tell you one matter that penetrates from above to below.\n\nYou—if your words are not... go on, open both ears and listen, do not lose even a fraction.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo on. When yang is outside, all things rise upward, conceiving and bearing fruit among the upper branches and leaves. At this time, Heaven’s yang qi is outside and has not yet returned to the roots below, so all things bear substance on the surface. Creeping creatures and the multitudes of people also gather outwardly.\n\nWhen yang qi returns inward into the earth, all things above become empty and without substance, while those below conceive and bear fruit within the earth, nourishing roots and leaves. Creeping creatures and people also enter and gather inwardly.\n\nThis is the great and luminous proof by August Heaven of yang’s true substance.\n\nThus, those who hold to the Dao of yang possess substance, while those who guard the Dao of yin lack it.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity governed by emulating Heaven and never dared emulate Earth.\n\nI wish to hear: what does it mean to emulate Heaven?\n\nTo emulate Heaven is to gather the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, the masters of Dao and arts, the sagely and wise—this is called emulating Heaven. To gather wealth and goods, petty men, the unworthy, and those ignorant of culture and refinement—this is called emulating Earth.\n\nExcellent, excellent. I wish to hear: why do the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, and the masters of Dao and arts emulate Heaven?\n\nHeaven is the benevolent, the worthy, the enlightened scholars, the masters of Dao and arts. Moreover, Heaven can ride the qi and fly—these six kinds of people, with their superior talents and unwavering devotion to the true Dao, may also attain the ability to ride the qi and fly. Thus, they belong to Heaven and emulate it.\n\nTherefore, the sages of antiquity alone deeply understood the will of August Heaven and never dared stray from it.\n\nI wish to hear: why does gathering wealth and goods, petty men, and the unworthy emulate Earth?\n\nNow, wealth gathers below and forms mud, mud transforms into dung, and dung transforms into soil. Petty men, foolish and unworthy, are deaf and blind to the Dao and its arts. They enter inauspicious gates and are fated to dwell early beneath the earth. If they are not buried, in time they become deeply harmful to Heaven and Earth. Governing with them brings chaos to the patterns of Heaven and Earth, the Five Phases contend daily, the four seasons lose their order, the Three Luminaries dim, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the hundred spirits do not love them. They contribute nothing to proper governance and should meet an early end—this is the nature of wealth.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed. How terrifying! How terrifying!",

Let the Way be made level. I wish to hear: how many states exist in the world?\n\nProfound! Wondrous! This is what you ask. Now, the central region comprises eighty-one domains. Beyond it, encircling once more, the world holds ten thousand states. Extending further to the boundless void, the three regions together number twelve thousand states.\n\nWhy are there twelve thousand states? The celestial reckoning begins with one and ends with ten. Ten multiplied yields the Way of Heaven, which reaches five and then returns. Thus it arrives at ten thousand states. The two thousand additional states correspond to the alternating reckoning of yin and yang, akin to the completion of a count by tens. The reckoning of years and months is uniquely twelve, with an intercalary month added every five years. This reflects the cyclical arising of Heaven and Earth. Beyond the boundless void of Heaven, it accords with the combined reckoning of Heaven and Earth. Thus twelve months return and merge into one year, with intercalation inserted within.\n\nThese twelve months are the reckoning of the primordial qi in its obscure darkness, the alternating inception of yin and yang. It is like all things ending in death at *hai* (亥), while *qian* (乾) establishes its initial position at the Gate of Heaven, congealing its kernel. At *hai*, it conceives; at *ren* (壬), it takes form. The first nine at *zi* (子), the sun begins its return; the second nine at *chou* (丑), yin and yang revolve; the third nine at *yin* (寅), Heaven, Earth, and humanity—all things—turn from yin toward yang, gazing toward *yin*. Thus all things first spread their roots in the northeast and show their heads at *yin*. The greatest of things take wood as their chief. Thus *yin* is the inception of wood, and *jia* (甲) is the very beginning of wood. Therefore, all things appear at *jia-yin* and end in death at *gui-hai* (癸亥).\n\nThus wood receives its mandate and life from the primordial qi within the Great Yin’s water. Hence *jia-zi* (甲子) is taken as the initial beginning. The celestial reckoning of change multiplies by five in its cycles. Thus five thousand, added to the twelve earthly branches, arrives precisely at *gui-hai* (癸亥), the completion of the reckoning. Perfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed.",

They contribute nothing to proper governance and should meet an early end—this is the nature of wealth.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand? Indeed, indeed. How terrifying! How terrifying!",

One multiplied by ten is ten; ten multiplied by ten reaches one hundred; one hundred multiplied by ten reaches one thousand; one thousand multiplied by ten reaches ten thousand. One is the beginning of all numbers; ten is their end. One hundred represents the virtuous states and regions.\n\nYou need only take my writings and bestow them upon a single state of great virtue. Those who transmit my writings shall carry the original forth without exhaustion, circulating it to the hundred virtuous regions. When one state receives my writings, that state prospers, and its people all turn toward it. Its virtue then spreads to the four directions, and the hundred states all receive its transformative influence, becoming good. Thus, Heaven and Earth are both pacified, and disasters are eliminated.

Thus, the teachings are directed only to the virtuous states. Now, when the virtueless states all turn toward the virtuous ones, they too will naturally be governed aright.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent! I wish to know why you take precisely these hundred virtuous states as the model.\"\n\n\"Excellent indeed is your question—you have grasped the meaning. The reckoning of Heaven, Earth, and humanity begins with one and ends with ten. Heaven’s numbers unfold upon the Earth and give rise to life; when the reckoning is complete, it emerges as one hundred.

If any one matter is discordant, virtue cannot be realized.\n\nI wish to know why Heaven’s number begins precisely with one.\"\n\n\"One is the time when primordial qi is utterly pure. Primordial qi coalesces without division—like wind, it has no seams—thus it is called one. When one congeals, it forms Heaven, which encompasses the eight directions above and below, hence the number ten. There are also the five directions, each with its own yin and yang, thus the number ten. Below, it corresponds to Earth. When Earth’s reckoning aligns with ten, life is generated. Thus, humans mirror Heaven’s numbers, being born after ten months. One is precisely the time of harmonious and boundless bestowal. Those who have received this bestowal must in turn mirror Heaven’s reckoning, emerging after ten months—thus the number ends at ten. Therefore, one is multiplied by ten.\n\nThe Way of Earth is the mother. At the time of *yu*, it joins in harmony with humanity. When Heaven, Earth, and humanity are mutually attuned, virtue is achieved—hence the hundred virtuous states. Thus, Heaven governs generation, Earth governs nurturance, and humanity governs completion. If any one matter strays from rectitude, all three fall into error. Therefore, when Heaven acts wickedly, it brings calamity; when Earth acts wickedly, it brings calamity; when humanity acts wickedly, it brings calamity. When all three act wickedly together, Heaven, Earth, and humanity are destroyed, and the reckoning begins anew. When all three act with goodness, their virtue pervades the void in perfect unity—thus, when the three unite, virtue is achieved, corresponding to the hundred states.\"\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!

      "translated_text": "Alas, how startling! Alas, how startling! Had you not pressed the question with such vigor, there would have been no way to attain this knowledge. Yet you may be said to have glimpsed a small awakening. Go now—do not pursue this inquiry to its end. I fear the Six Perfected Ones would be startled and undone. To force questions beyond one’s capacity is to invite great harm.\n\nYet those who would be teachers face many difficulties. Seeing your distress, I shall clarify further for you. Go, and listen with open ears. Be seated and attend. Very well.\n\nYou wish to delight in knowing its great efficacy. Consider this: a single household has father, mother, and child—just as the Dao of Heaven completes a household. The father is likened to Heaven, the mother to Earth, the child to the harmonious center. Their gathered possessions, all that the household contains, are like the myriad things—together, they form one family. The father is as the ruler, the mother as the minister, the child as the people. Wealth and goods circulate to nourish one another, sharing as the myriad things do. This one household shares one great concern.\n\nA single district of ten thousand households likewise forms one family, sharing one great concern. Ten districts unite to form a commandery—one family, one great concern. Ten commanderies unite to form a great province—one family, one great concern. Ten provinces unite to form a great state—one great family, one great concern, and one great realm.\n\nWhen the emperor’s virtue is abundant, his concern extends to twelve provinces; when vast, it reaches thirteen provinces. Together, they form one great family, sharing one great concern. Beyond these borders lie distant lands not subject to human rule. If those lands possess the Dao and virtue, their good people come to the human realm; if they lack virtue, they do not come. If their virtue is inferior, they come to harm others.\n\nThis is one division, one realm—the demarcation of Heaven and Earth. It ensures that the restless multitudes of the world each have their place and do not prey upon one another.\n\nThus, what is meant by the Great Ultimate, the Central Ultimate, and the Lesser Ultimate? The Great Ultimate governs what lies beyond all external bounds. The Central Ultimate governs the central region. The Lesser Ultimate ensures that each responds to its own realm and ceases there. They may seek one another through the Dao and virtue, but they must not greatly prey upon one another. Heaven resents this—hence, they are called one family, sharing one great concern.\n\nDo you wish to know its truth? Consider a household of father, son, and wife: they worry only that their own family may not prosper and do not concern themselves with other households. A single district shares concern for its ruler—if he is good, they promote him to higher office, each striving to advance their local officials; if he is evil, they wish to remove him together. A district, a commandery, a province, a state—all follow this principle, sharing one great concern.\n\nNow, it is recorded that twelve thousand states form one great division, sharing one great concern with the Perfected Ones. One realm—yet beyond it, realms like these twelve thousand states are beyond counting.\n\nThus, the works of the sages of old all recorded but one small division. Why did they not record the great realms? Heaven did not permit it to be spoken. The great transformation had not yet emerged; what was made differed, and could not follow the same pattern—thus, it was not recorded.\n\nNow, the great transformation has emerged. The twelve thousand states have completed their cyclical revolutions, and so Heaven has sent the Perfected Ones to inquire into the scripture of the boundless and the governance of the all-penetrating. Thus, the text is entrusted to the one hundred states possessing virtue. One virtuous state transforms ninety-nine others. The twelve thousand states are counted together—like a year of twelve months, with the thirteenth month as an intercalary addition. This is what is meant.\n\nDo you understand? Very well.",

      "translated_text": "Go on, I would fully explain it to you as your child, yet it would never end, straining resources and proving too burdensome—so I pause here briefly. If doubts remain, return to ask again.\nYes, yes.\n\n*Here concludes the collection of disputations, transmissions of scriptural secrets, and the division of teachings among the states.*\n\n**Reverently Serving the Spirits: Fifteen-Year Great Peace Secret, Scroll One Hundred Forty**\n\nI humbly request to ask one matter.\nSpeak plainly.\nNow that the heavens bestow Great Peace, can it be foreknown?\nYes, it can be known.\nWhen the qi of the Five Thearchs’ spirits attains Great Peace, that year will be one of joyous harmony.\nWhat does this mean?\nI wish to hear it.\nThus: in spring, when the qi of the Green Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in summer, when the qi of the Red Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in the sixth month, when the qi of the Yellow Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in autumn, when the qi of the White Thearch’s spirit is at peace; in winter, when the qi of the Black Thearch’s spirit is at peace.\nHow is this made clear?\nGreat Peace means that not a single thing is harmed—this is the essence of the qi of Great Peace. In all matters, if not a single thing is injured or afflicted, all things find their proper place, and thus it is called *peace*. If one thing is harmed, it is immediately unpeaceful. If two things are harmed, it is immediately subject to punishment. If three things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to all things. If four things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the four directions. If five things are harmed, it is immediately a harm to the five directions, and the world suffers great calamity. If six things are harmed, it is immediately an evil that pervades the six directions. If seven things are harmed, its baleful qi spreads unchecked. If eight things are harmed, it immediately causes the worthy and the unworthy to hold divergent plans and fail to unite their strength. If nine things are harmed, it immediately brings evil to its ultimate conclusion in yin and yang, causing things to churn in chaos. If ten things are harmed, it is a harm to the great net, and the celestial reckoning is exhausted, giving way to a new count.\nThus, the sages of antiquity simply observed clearly whether the qi of the Five Thearchs’ spirits was at peace or not, and thereby knew whether governance was successful or failing, whether peace had been achieved or not.\nI wish to hear the meaning of the peace secret.\nThus: when all things in spring are born without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Green Thearch. When all things in summer grow without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Red Thearch. In the sixth month, when all things are nurtured without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Yellow Thearch. In autumn, when all things reach maturity and are harvested without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the White Thearch. In winter, when all things are stored without a single harm, it is the Great Peace of the Black Thearch.\nWhen the Five Thearchs attain Great Peace for one year, the people rejoice and act with goodness and compliance. For two years, the earth above is filled with great joy. For three years, grace and favor reach their culmination in heaven. For four years, the winds and qi flow in harmony. For five years, the Nine Spirits do not war, and pernicious evils are subdued and destroyed. For six years, the Six Norms are fully established. For seven years, the Three Luminaries grow brighter. For eight years, grace reaches the eight directions. For nine years, yin and yang are both pleased. For ten years, the myriad things each find their proper place. This completes the lesser cycle of reckoning, and when things are thrice united, heaven, earth, and humanity are complete—thus, in thirty years, Great Peace is achieved.\nNow, the qi of the Supreme Thearch emerges, and the true Dao arrives to govern, so in fifteen years, Great Peace is attained. If one does not vigorously practice the true Dao, how can Great Peace be idly achieved?\nThis fifteen-year attainment of Great Peace refers to the emperor and his ministers, great and small, who follow the true Dao, jointly dispelling falsehood and deceit—thus, in fifteen years, peace is achieved.\nDoes the Perfected One understand?\nTherefore, to know whether peace is coming or not, simply observe whether the spirits of the Five Thearchs are at peace or not—this is sufficient for clarity, sufficient for self-knowledge.\nThus, all omens first appear among the celestial spirits. If the celestial spirits are not at peace, how can humanity alone claim peace?\nTherefore, as the Five Thearchs take turns governing, each can bring about Great Peace. Those who lose the intent of the celestial spirits cannot bring peace to their governance.\nThus, one must carefully follow the four seasons, be prudent with the five phases, and not allow the Nine Spirits to war. Therefore, one must revere their conduct and serve their spirits.\nNow, the first and supreme qi of peace is about to arrive, so I teach the Perfected One to revere the four seasons and five phases, causing the great and small to rise together and serve the affairs of the spirits.\nIn antiquity, they merely revered the four seasons and five phases, so Great Peace came slowly, in thirty years.

Those who grasp and practice the Dao in my writings—though people of later ages may daily say, \"This Dao is of no benefit,\" yet month by month it proves good; though they may monthly say it is of no benefit, yet year by year it proves good; though they may yearly say it is of no benefit, yet even in old age it remains constantly good, enduring without departure—later generations will take it as the learning of their age.\n\nThose who do not practice swiftly know only the long, solitary suffering of their own time. Thus, I instruct and command the Perfected Ones to be ever diligent and earnest.\n\nThe Dao emerges for those of virtue and power: whether first or last, none are uniquely favored or closely bound to me—I receive them equally. Therefore, whoever obtains it and strives to practice it is that person; there is no distinction between one and another.\n\nDo you understand?\nYes, yes.\n\nProceed: The Way of Heaven is impartial, returning to humanity; the power of Earth is unbiased, bestowed upon the careful. Among the people, there is no precedence or delay—only love for those of true trustworthiness.\n\nThus, the ancient emperors and kings had palaces and dwellings to employ those of virtue and power, not idle ministers without merit. Those of virtue and power are beloved by Heaven and Earth and can assist emperors and kings in pacifying the myriad things. Those without virtue and power are resented by Heaven and Earth, thieves of yin and yang.\n\nHow weighty is this?\nAre you still so foolish?\n\nIndeed, those without virtue and power—whose conduct is boundless—go against Heaven and Earth, thus becoming their adversaries; they disrupt yin and yang, thus becoming their thieves.\n\nDo you understand?\nYes, yes.",

Failing in these three practices brings an ineradicable sin. Heaven and Earth detest them, ghosts and spirits harm them, and all people despise them. Even in death, their guilt lingers beneath the earth, for they are known as the unruly child of the three unvirtuous practices. Each month’s end and new moon’s dawn, they stand before Heaven, where the spirits who govern the rectification of yin and yang—those who uphold the order of honor and humility—cause their hun and po to grieve until their annihilation is complete.\n\nThus, knowing your lack of refinement, you bear an unabsolved transgression against your master.\n\nExcellent, excellent!",

      "translated_text": "Whence did you receive these words?\" \"I received them from my former master.\" \"Moreover, this foolish student once glimpsed the Celestial Master expounding them. Having received the Celestial Master’s teachings, I beheld the celestial patterns and saw that Heaven and Earth are the parents of the four seasons and five phases. If the four seasons and five phases do not exhaust their strength in supplying what Heaven and Earth desire to generate, they become unfilial children, and the year yields scant good things, becoming an inauspicious year. People, too, are children of Heaven and Earth; if they do not diligently nurture what Heaven and Earth produce, they are called unfilial children.\n\nThus, those who favor the use of punishments cause their states to be constantly disordered, imperiled, and ruined. The myriad things follow the four seasons and five phases in their decline and flourishing, growing and nurturing themselves—they are their disciples. If they cannot exhaust their strength in following the seasonal qi to grow, mature, and reach their end, they become disobedient disciples, and the year’s things are harmed. People, instead, blame the seasonal qi for disharmony, compounding the transgression of the seasons.\n\nThe people are the disciples of the sages and worthies. Now, foolish disciples recklessly steal and forcibly expound, causing sages and worthies to bear fault—this is called collectively disrupting and rebelling against the Dao of Heaven. Their sin is most grave and cannot be pardoned. Thus, this foolish student’s transgressions remain unabsolved.\n\nWind and rain are the loyal ministers of Heaven and Earth. Receiving Heaven’s mandate, they jointly circulate qi and distribute moisture. If they fail to harmonize and equalize, causing the world to be uneven, it is like a minister receiving the mandate of an emperor or king, turning against superiors and toward inferiors, using their intentions without balance. Many ministers together act disloyally and deceptively, collectively deceiving their superiors, causing the world to be turbulent with frequent disputes and the state’s governance to be imperiled and disordered.\n\nThese three matters—children being unfilial, disciples being disobedient, and ministers being disloyal—are sins that admit no pardon. Heaven detests them intensely, Earth loathes them deeply, regarding them as great affairs and grave calamities. Ghosts and spirits severely condemn them, thus they are the most vile and base conduct.\n\nAlas! A perfected one long possessing wisdom yet feigning foolishness causes me to recklessly expound, speaking beyond what Heaven and Earth would allow. What I have said does not compare to what you have just uttered, which is profound and far-reaching. This foolish student’s thoughts have now reached this point, and I can say no more. Great humility—yet even this does not err. To be lowly yet not humble is also a grave transgression.\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nThus, this foolish student, as a disciple, cannot clarify the boundaries of the master’s Dao. Knowing my transgressions are grave, I expound upon the celestial patterns to reproach myself.\n\n\"Excellent are your words! I, too, have nothing to add. Now, comparing your words to mine, you have already understood yourself. The boundaries of the written teachings are indeed beyond my reach. Yet if you truly fall short, I will provide a detailed explanation for you, arranging them in order with distinct boundaries, so that they may never be forgotten for ten thousand generations.\n\nNow, the perfected one speaks of the three disobedient and unrefined practices, saying that hun and po appear for judgment—this is most ingenious. From whom did you receive this oral teaching? It is like the Celestial Master recounting matters from the former master, who himself spoke of the admonitions of the perfected ones of high antiquity. This foolish student, upon hearing these words, also saw them in the Celestial Master’s written texts, thus confirming them again.\n\nWhen this foolish student questioned the perfected ones of high antiquity, I was uncertain and had doubts. Yet the words of the perfected ones of high antiquity are correct—I have nothing to add. Now, I wish to ask the Celestial Master about this meaning.\n\nProceed, listen clearly.\n\nThus, at the end of the month and the end of the year, not only do the hun and po of those who were unfilial, disobedient, and disloyal in life appear for judgment, but so do the spirits of Heaven and Earth. Heaven takes fifteen days as a minor boundary, so the moon reaches its fifteenth day and then slightly recedes. A month is taken as a middle boundary, and a year as a great boundary.\n\nAll the spirits and essences between Heaven and Earth together assist Heaven in generating, nurturing, and maturing the twelve thousand things, thus all spirits and essences receive their emoluments. It is like many worthy ministers assisting the emperor or king in nurturing and maturing the common people and the myriad things, all receiving their emoluments.\n\nThus, following Heaven’s model, there is a minor reckoning every fifteen days, a middle reckoning every month, and a great reckoning every year. Those with great merit are promoted and elevated; those without merit are demoted and dismissed, completing the governance. Those who disrupt governance are the perverse and evil spirits.\n\nThe perverse and evil spirits act accordingly, so the hun and po of those who were unvirtuous in life appear together for judgment. The hun and po of good people refuse to serve them. Thus, the hun and po of those who were rebellious, unfilial, disobedient, and disloyal serve them, collectively disrupting Heaven’s patterns and defiling Heaven’s governance. Therefore, the evil spirits are seized and governed, and their guests are also seized and governed. It is like rebellious and evil ministers committing outrages, so that their guests also bear guilt—this is what is meant.\n\nExcellent, excellent! This foolish student now understands.\"",

The supremely worthy, with clarity and effort, may transcend the world; the middling worthy, with effort, may become good ministers and virtuous officials to emperors and kings; even the petty, with effort, may remain free from joy and anger, so that the world bears no resentment or blame. This is the foremost and greatest boundary of my writings.\n\nFearing that the common people, long sunk in ignorance, remain deluded and do not trust my words, I therefore instruct them to compare and align with the writings of those who have guarded the One from ancient times to the present, grouping them by kind to mutually verify one another.\n\nExcellent, excellent indeed. The foolish student humbly awakens.\n\nNow, as for guarding the One: the great person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; the middling person who guards it finds it more than sufficient; even the petty person who guards it finds it more than sufficient. When all three kinds of people guard and practice it together, its goodness permeates the six directions and eight distant realms, its kindness and love equaling that of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs for the most foolish, those who take no joy in guarding and practicing it are called the most wicked and violent people in the world. Heaven and Earth detest them, and ghosts and spirits no longer protect them.\n\nWhen people persistently do not pursue profit, this is the method by which the celestial writings distinguish good and evil. Those who delight in reading and studying are known by Heaven as good people; those who show no desire to study are known by Heaven as wicked and violent—this is one and the same principle. Judging people by this, not one in ten thousand will be mistaken.\n\nI compose these writings for the Virtuous Lord of the Highest Power, upholding Heaven above, Earth below, and the Virtuous Lord in between, without deceiving the Perfected Ones.

      "translated_text": "The lesser worthy, by guarding the One and entering the Dao through study, may also witness divine governance in eight out of ten cases and serve alongside the common people to dispel evil and remove harm. They too should collate and verify ancient and modern Daoist texts to confirm their own understanding—only then will the foolish gain clarity and fully believe in the Dao. If one merely reads a single scroll without conviction, they will not only disbelieve but may even speak against it, justifying their own doubts. Thus, evil will daily arise, bringing harm to others. If the great worthy, the middling worthy, the lesser worthy, and the common people all guard the divine Dao and practice it together, then the spirits of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons will all flourish, and evil will naturally vanish. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nIn this way, the spirits of the world above and below, of the four directions, the six relations, and the six kinships will all rejoice and flourish, aiding people to bring fortune and dissolve evil harm. Above, they will remove disasters and illnesses for emperors and kings; in the middle, they will cure ailments for the worthy; below, they will dispel malevolent qi for the common people, preventing wicked ghosts and spirits from acting. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThere must be great secrets and precepts to see the spirits and divine affairs. To say one is accurate in ten out of ten cases is to align with the spirits of Heaven; to say nine out of ten is to align with the spirits of Earth; to say eight out of ten is to align with the spirits of humanity. Beyond this, such words are unreliable. Some may initially see spirits and be perfectly aligned, yet over time grow increasingly inaccurate—this is the Dao of spirits testing them, causing their inaccuracy. If they recognize this and renew themselves, earnestly correcting their faults and striving for purity without evil intentions, their conduct will daily improve. They may then meet the spirits’ expectations, achieving perfect accuracy or even surpassing it, or hitting one in ten with ever-increasing precision. Such are those who daily cultivate goodness and grasp the intent of the Dao. Thus, it is called progress. Using this to divine for oneself, one will not err in ten thousand cases.\n\nSome may initially see spirits and divine inaccurately, yet later reverse course and achieve great accuracy—these are people who refine their understanding of the Dao’s intent and daily advance. Others may remain unchanged, neither progressing nor regressing—these are those whose dedication does not deepen. Those who daily decline are the indolent. Divining thus, one fails to grasp the Dao’s intent. Those who are tested and remain unaware, stubbornly persisting in evil, will be collectively deceived by the spirits. They will be led into depravity, bringing unpredictable fortune and misfortune, falling into heretical teachings, or suffering from lingering illnesses.\n\nThus, the great worthy, the middling worthy, the lesser worthy, and all common men and women who practice the Dao must use this to divine for themselves, never erring—for the divine Dao tests people. All matters under Heaven are subject to trial and failure. Heaven and Earth test people, so humans, in imitation of Heaven and Earth, also test one another. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nDo you wish to further know the great truth and evidence of the mutual resonance between the Dao of Heaven, the divine spirits, and the people? When their intentions align and their hearts are in accord, sincerity and trust prevail; when their intentions diverge, deception arises. Thus, in high antiquity, people’s sincerity and trust aligned, so superiors and inferiors did not deceive one another. In middle antiquity, half were misaligned, so half deceived one another. In later antiquity, none believed, so superiors and inferiors made deception their sole affair. Thus, in high antiquity, all undertakings succeeded; in middle antiquity, half succeeded; in later antiquity, none succeeded, leading to peril and ruin.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of old constantly used this to divine whether they had attained resonance or not, ensuring no mistakes. With this, I admonish you, Perfected One. I see you constantly toil in hardship, so I deeply caution you—you are to serve as the eternal emissary of Heaven and Earth, resolving the flowing disasters of Heaven and Earth and removing harm for rulers. Your merit is immense and nearly unmatched. I fear you may grow indolent in your practice of the Dao, so I use these divine matters to warn you. If you serve as the emissary of Heaven and Earth and daily encounter fortune, it is because you have grasped the intent of Heaven and Earth. If you daily encounter misfortune, decline, and evil, it is because you have lost their intent.\n\nIn your interactions with the Dao and the spirits, if your days are fortunate and good, it is because you have grasped the Dao’s intent. If your days are misfortunate and declining, it is because you have lost the Dao’s intent. In your interactions with others, if your relationships daily grow deeper and kinder, it is because your intentions align. If they daily turn hostile and cold, it is because your intentions have diverged. Consider farming: those who harvest abundant, fine grain have applied careful attention and great effort. Those who harvest little, poor grain have been careless and exerted little effort. Even plants and trees respond to the diligence or negligence of human effort—how much more so the spirits of Heaven and Earth and humanity? Can you not be cautious?\n\nPerfected One, this admonition may seem slight and insignificant, but if you deeply ponder it, you will find it profoundly weighty. This is precisely the gateway to safety or peril, fortune or misfortune. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.",

Thus, correct texts and correct speech are the great and efficacious root of correctness for Heaven, Earth, the people, and the myriad things.\n\nDo you wish to further clarify and understand its truth? Consider this: when someone praises a ruler with correct texts and correct speech, the ruler gains great wisdom and great clarity. In all undertakings, nothing strays from correctness. Above and below thus attain the will of Heaven and Earth; the Three Luminaries do not deviate from their courses; the four seasons and Five Phases do not err. The people are all joyful, exclaiming, \"Excellent!\" The myriad things each find their proper place. Grace extends to the spirits and deities, and one’s fame spreads to distant lands. The host of spirits and auspicious omens emerge in delight. The worthy and learned of the world all gladly come to assist their ruler, and nothing remains concealed. Immortals and divine spirits then bestow upon him the methods of agelessness. Demonic influences are eradicated, and the people govern themselves. With correct texts and correct speech, no mutual resentment arises, and blame is entirely cut off.\n\nAll goodness emerges in the world, while all perversity and evil conceal themselves. The virtuous ruler need only sit with folded hands, and governance proceeds of itself—what worry of peril or ruin remains? This is the clear proof and efficacy of my correct texts and correct speech as the root of goodness. How could one not strive to uphold correctness? Perfected One, do you understand?

      "translated_text": "The foolish truly fear this. If you know to fear it, you may be called one who understands the affairs of life, and Heaven will protect you.\n\n—It is not so, it is not so.\n\nThere is no room for refusal here. It is not I who cause you to be protected by Heaven; by doing good, you naturally attain it. Thus, the conduct of the sages of old never dared stray from the plumb line, for they observed Heaven’s warnings and clearly discerned good and evil, each for their own sake. Therefore, they constantly sought to govern alongside the worthy, ever fearful of provoking Heaven. To offend Heaven is to have no recourse in prayer.\n\nThus, the ancient emperors and kings, with minds clear and penetrating, dared not recklessly collaborate with fools in governance, and so they alone enjoyed enduring good fortune. Perfected One, do you understand?\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nSince the middle antiquity, half of humanity has been foolish, regarding selection and appointment as minor matters, failing to examine them carefully. Half the time, they obtain the wrong persons, half the time they disrupt Heaven’s offices, and half the time governance turns inauspicious. In later antiquity, inheriting the negligence of the middle era, they further allowed matters to proceed with ease, again failing to examine them carefully. In selections and appointments, they often fail to secure the right people, defiling Heaven’s offices. The Three Luminaries become unaligned because of this, and the evidence appears in the heavens—Heaven is displeased. Thus, inauspicious years persist without end, and when they briefly cease, they arise again. Yet people do not deeply reproach themselves, instead blaming the times and fate.\n\nIn ancient times, when such things occurred, the Way of Heaven was not at fault. Yet people, in their excess, attributed blame upward to Heaven, while the foolish below did not reflect on their own transgressions. Instead, they repeatedly joined together to shift responsibility, laying fault upon the emperors and kings. Heaven names such people \"greatly rebellious subjects.\" The fault lies below, yet they deceive their superiors, calling evil good and good evil, collectively bringing about these disasters, then shifting blame upward to Heaven. Those who shift blame to Heaven further reproach their ruler. Such utterly perverse ministers and subjects are without justification.\n\nNow, the spirits of Heaven and Earth together detest them, so Heaven has personally dispatched me to descend and, for the Virtuous Lord, renew the system of laws. In selecting and appointing people to official positions, one must be meticulous and thorough. Perfected One, do you wish to know how to scrutinize these wicked ministers and subjects?\n\nConsider a household where parents raise several children. The children together deceive their parents, behaving wickedly. The parents, sitting silently in a room, know of their children’s violent and thieving conduct, yet the people instead collectively blame the parents: \"The parents are evil, so they bore evil children.\" When the county officials apprehend them, they do not justly execute the wicked children but instead repeatedly blame the parents.\n\nParents, in raising children, always desire them to be worthy and good. When have they ever wished for their children to behave wickedly? To shift blame back to the parents is to be a greatly rebellious and unfilial child.\n\nThe ruler’s relationship to his ministers is the same: he always desires them to do good. When has he ever taught them to do evil? Yet the ministers and subjects below collectively engage in violent and wicked conduct, bringing disasters from Heaven and Earth, then shift blame back to reproach their ruler, causing the common people to suffer hardship. Thereupon, cunning officials also join in reproaching Heaven, calling this \"ministers and subjects collectively committing rebellion.\" The crime cannot be absolved.\n\nThey exhaust their reproach of the ruler, and when the situation becomes dire, they further shift blame upward to Heaven and downward to Earth. Such is the rebellion of humanity—should their lives not be shortened and they not be swiftly executed?\n\nThus, in later antiquity, all have met with truncated destinies, their lives and deaths untimely. It is like a household wishing to slaughter livestock: if they suddenly decide to kill, they kill at once. Even good livestock are pitied in death, while wicked livestock are left to die of illness.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\n\n—Indeed, indeed.",

Bring forth this text and have the virtuous ruler display it to all worthy scholars. Take heed not to conceal Heaven’s joy—release it with utmost urgency.\n\n—Indeed, indeed.\n\nLet me impart to you, Perfected One, a matter of great importance. When a ruler of great virtue employs ministers, each assigned to their proper place and aligned with the heart of Heaven, they must then know the arts of governing the people and eliminating harm. Yet those who dwell in distant regions, concealed and hidden, are exceedingly difficult to know. The benighted masses, each seeking their own advantage, instead deceive their virtuous ruler. It is incumbent upon the wise and enlightened to correct this together, for only when all is rectified will the heart of Heaven and Earth rejoice greatly, ensuring the emperor’s enduring fortune.\n\nHeaven, in its wisdom, knows that the people of later ages are foolish and difficult to govern. Thus, it has deliberately issued this written covenant, called the *Celestial Writ*. The nature of writing is to make things manifest and clear, so that all under Heaven may record matters and act in accordance. It serves to document the writings of all people, not for the sake of a single, solitary individual. Therefore, all under Heaven use it to record every affair.\n\nThe sages employ it to record the patterns of Heaven and Earth, while the worthy use it to preserve the words of the sages. All people must study and read it together, only then can they grasp its meaning. The categories of writing are such that they must be collectively examined, collectively deliberated, collectively recorded, and collectively recited, so that deceit may be eliminated.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, the writings of the worthy and sagely—how many have been collated, how many transmitted, how many verified, how many collectively preserved—still inevitably contain residual errors and misleading phrases that cannot be entirely eradicated. Therefore, the great worthies and masters of the Dao traverse the world, scrutinizing words and studying speech, comparing differences to enlighten the ignorant. Yet even so, they may still mislead the innocent, causing them to recklessly expound their learning, rendering them unfit for office and unworthy to serve as ministers to the emperor.\n\nThus, when a single original text proliferates into many chapters and sentences, divergent interpretations arise, throwing the Dao of Heaven and Earth into great disorder and confusion, thereby giving rise to the calamities of *chengfu*.

      "translated_text": "Go forth, for you have awakened. Now listen further, and I shall tell you of a great precept.\n\nThe reason people of later ages have long lost the favor of Heaven, causing Heaven and Earth to remain in constant sorrow, is that rulers rely on solitary words and isolated judgments, verifying matters without truth, and thus greatly deviating from the clarity of their intent. Perfected One, if this persists, it leads the multitude of worthies throughout the world to collectively examine texts yet remain ignorant, all falling into misguided learning. Hence, calamities and anomalies arise without cease. Heaven deeply abhors this, giving rise to disorder and illness, where yin and yang engage in unending strife.\n\nThus, Heaven commanded me to descend and correct these errors through careful collation. Since the Great Middle Antiquity, people have trusted solitary words and isolated judgments, often regarding the scrutiny of subordinate texts as disrespectful. They collectively use this as a standard for blame, thereby relying on solitary words and isolated judgments to respond to and draft documents for governance, thus incurring Heaven’s resentment and disorder.\n\nHeavenly official documents were originally meant for people to collectively deliberate their right and wrong. Instead, they allow a single person to secretly compose the words. Even sages cannot alone fully comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the works of sages and worthies across generations differ, as Heaven has stated that each excels in but one aspect and cannot entirely eliminate disasters. Thus, Heaven commanded me to gather and collate them all.\n\nNow, instead, they trust the words of one person—how can this be acceptable? Therefore, Heaven instructs that the Three Dao Documents be circulated, allowing the great and the small, the worthy and the unworthy, men and women, to collectively interweave and deliberate, jointly determining right and wrong, all ensuring the verification of truth. Only then may they be presented. If one among them seeks to deceive, it shall be recorded. In this way, the illnesses of Heaven and Earth will be eradicated, and the emperor will bear no *chengfu* responsibility.\n\nHeaven and Earth, free from illness, will rejoice. The emperor, secure in his rule, will rejoice. The worthy will attain self-realization and rejoice. The common people, freed from unjust suffering, will rejoice. Households will prosper, and people will be content, rejoicing. Servants and maids will find just masters and refrain from wrongdoing, rejoicing. The four seasons and five phases will proceed in harmony, and the people, cautious and untransgressive, will rejoice. The myriad things, each in its proper place and unharmed, will rejoice. Ghosts and spirits, witnessing the virtuous ruler’s accumulation of goodness, will also delight. Evil qi will no longer rise to obscure the heavens, and the sun, moon, and three luminaries will rejoice. The Supreme Peaceful Qi will come to govern, and the king, in his rule, will rejoice. Evil qi, once subdued and hidden, will no longer manifest to incite punitive expeditions, bringing joy. The barbarians will remain in their lands, no longer frequently waging war on Heaven’s behalf, rejoicing. Generals and commanders will rest their weapons, and soldiers will avoid death in battle, rejoicing.\n\nIn all between Heaven and Earth, such joys are too numerous to record. I, Perfected One, have outlined the great principles and shown their beginnings. Reflect on their meaning, and by analogy, you shall grasp all. When the virtuous ruler implements this, the world will submit in harmony.",

Such governance is the root of chaos and peril, the calamity that destroys the self—how could one not be cautious?\n\nThese writings are what all under Heaven must jointly examine and practice; they cannot be trusted on the word of a single person. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, texts and human testimonies have been transmitted and cross-examined to verify their clarity. Without such verification, they cannot be practiced alone. To act solely on one person’s word is to court danger and ruin—this is the great loss and harm of the world.\n\nTherefore, my writings dare not tolerate solitary words or isolated phrases. Thus, I instruct the Perfected One to collate and compare ancient, middle, and recent texts to illuminate their coherence, and to gather and verify the testimonies of all under Heaven to confirm their covenants. Only then can all between Heaven and Earth be rectified, and the interactions of yin and yang remain free of affliction.\n\nExamine past and present celestial patterns, earthly spirit-writings, and human testimonies with my texts—they will surely resonate like an echo, indistinguishable from the divine. Only then can my Dao be deemed trustworthy. Thus, I do not speak of the Dao idly; I seek its trial in practice. Without practice, how can one know whether my Dao aligns with Heaven and proves true?\n\nToday, practice it, and it will be as if conversing with Heaven—ten out of ten, fifteen out of fifteen, with no omissions. Wondrous is the Dao when thus pursued! Truly, it may be called the greatest joy. Does the Perfected One understand? Indeed.\n\nProceed, and enlightenment will arise.\n\nI impart to the Perfected One a great secret: this begins with guarding the One, focusing on goodness to grasp its essence, thereby entering the Dao. Thus, I follow it with the writings on the Dao. Pursuing the Dao leads to entering the chamber, entering the true Dao, and entering the chamber requires knowledge of the divine—hence, I follow it with the divine precepts.\n\nHaving guarded the One, attained the Dao, and attained the divine, one may ascend to become a virtuous ruler or a worthy minister. Ministers must assist the virtuous ruler in harmonizing the six directions and eight realms of Heaven and Earth, grasping their essence so the nation may enjoy enduring peace.\n\nTo achieve this peace, one must rectify texts, words, and speech. Thus, collating and verifying writings and testimonies brings great rectification. Only then will the multitude of worthy scholars and superior gentlemen emerge to jointly assist the ruler, serving as his enlightened ears, eyes, and limbs. Hence, I follow this with the nine officials.\n\nWhen the nine officials each fulfill their roles, they will jointly harmonize Heaven and Earth, and all under Heaven will unite in purpose. They must constantly communicate, reporting good and ill—thus, I follow this with the Three Daoist Writings.\n\nOnce all have mastered guarding the One, entered the Dao, attained the divine, and embraced rectified texts, with officials of all ranks in their proper places, and once the six affairs of the writings are practiced in unison, all under Heaven will share one heart. None will dare to harbor hatred; all will love and benefit one another as if born of the same parents. Thus, the virtuous ruler deeply aligns with Heaven’s will, delighting in the absence of strife.\n\nFearing omissions in the Dao might leave Heaven and Earth’s writings incomplete, I further append the *Great Collection of Difficulties* to resolve doubts. The profoundest matters are placed below, and the complete writings are presented to be entrusted to the virtuous ruler. Should the world’s calculations shift even once, it will spontaneously govern itself for the better.\n\nThis ease is like fire ascending dry heights or water flowing downward—no instruction is needed, for it moves naturally and cannot be restrained. Thus, the teachings of the Great August Heavenly Dao will swiftly take effect. When the virtuous ruler practices them, he is called the Divine Son of Heaven, styled the Supreme August One, resembling the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, all spirits under Heaven may be commanded.\n\nSince the opening of Heaven and Earth, there has never been a celestial scripture or divine text like this, transmitted by the Perfected One as a record of the true Dao. Entrusting it to the virtuous ruler, it is called the Mother of the Dao.\n\nThe qi of the Great Yang, the fire phase, exists within it. To practice it is to attain its truth; to neglect it is to render it unreal. Does the Perfected One understand? Indeed.",

When the virtuous ruler implements this, the world will submit in harmony.",

Our Dao is for governing Heaven and Earth, pacifying emperors and kings, and giving life to what Heaven and Earth cherish—thus, one must cherish the true Dao and true virtue. Therefore, Heaven is the truth of the Dao, the warp of the Dao, the faithfulness of the Dao, the means by which the Dao operates through interdependence. Earth is the chief of virtue, the weft of virtue, the foundation by which virtue comes to rest through interdependence. Thus, it endures as the mother of the myriad things, constantly enduring humiliation by dwelling below, never boasting of its toil and hardship.\n\nAs the virtuous ruler, I instruct the benighted below, taking these two matters of Heaven and Earth as my foundation. Thus, I always follow the laws and measures of Heaven and Earth, never deviating from their gateway.

Now, the superior person delights greatly in the true Dao and good virtue; the middling person is half-inclined toward them; the inferior person, devoid of form, utterly lacks Dao and virtue—all are those who commit great rebellion and defy the Dao.

Now, those without Dao and without virtue—thus Heaven and Earth do not pardon them.\n\nTo know this with clear certainty: consider how those of Dao recognize others of Dao, and those of virtue recognize others of virtue, each gathering and embracing their own. Thus their destinies are mutually sustained. Therefore, those of Dao delight in elevating others of Dao, and those of virtue delight in elevating others of virtue. Those with Dao and virtue do not align with those without Dao and virtue, and so refuse to gather or embrace them—thus their destinies are not bound to Heaven.\n\nExcellent, excellent.

      "translated_text": "Now, the people of this later age bear the burdens of their ancestors’ miscalculations, gradually severing the Dao and virtue together. Day by day, over long years, they cut themselves off from Heaven and Earth, their essence and qi no longer flowing through them. Unaware of their own destiny, they revert to sharing the fate of four-footed creatures. Thus, Heaven and Earth detest them, and the spirits and qi of the gods no longer protect them. Their illnesses are countless, their deaths untimely—this is the great fault that lies here...\n\nYet the ruler of supreme virtue, whose fate is bound to Heaven and Earth, must emulate them and govern through the Dao and virtue. Therefore, I have once more set forth the Way of Heaven and entrusted it to those above. Heaven delights in their goodness and does not wish them to persist in the ways of four-footed men. Thus, I reiterate these writings with utmost urgency, desiring that they awaken fully. Therefore, I have compiled the Six Calamities and the Great Collective Adversity to deliver and return them to their rightful place.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\nHow astonishing! How joyous, how joyous!\n\nPerfected One, how do you know what is so astonishing and joyous?\nWhen I, a foolish student, heard the Heavenly Master speak, I realized that when the true Dao and virtue emerge, the people transform in a single day. All will uphold the Dao and virtue, emulate Heaven and Earth, and no longer act as four-footed men. Each person will follow the Dao, each will embody virtue—thus I know the profound joy of this intent.\n\nExcellent, Perfected One! Your words are beyond improvement.\nNow, I wish to take this opportunity to ask the Heavenly Master one question.\nSpeak.\n\nWhen people seek the Dao and virtue, or when ordinary men act, what should they regard as their most urgent duty? How can they come to know it, and how can they resonate in response with Heaven and Earth?\n\nExcellent is your question! They must act with utmost sincerity, with the five inner organs true and sincere—only then can they attain it. If they do not act with the five inner organs true and sincere, they incur the resentment of the Dao and virtue. Seeking goodness will be in vain, and the spirits will not respond.\n\nNow, I wish to hear: how does utmost sincerity move Heaven and Earth and the gods?\nAlas! Perfected One, in this you are particularly foolish. Have you not yet grasped the texts I have written? Your ignorance is deep and long-standing—it cannot be dispelled in a single day. Yet you are also greatly humble. Listen carefully now, and I will explain the meaning of utmost sincerity moving Heaven and Earth.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\nHeed my words.\n\nUtmost sincerity is so named because one looks up to Heaven and acts, emulating the Way of Heaven. One looks down to Earth and acts, emulating the virtue of Earth. One reflects that Heaven and Earth, like parents, gave me life and do not wish me to delight in evil. Thus, one returns filial piety to the heart and acts accordingly.\n\nThe heart is the most revered spirit within the deepest recesses. The heart is sacred, the pure yang movement of fire. Fire moves upward, sharing the radiance of Heaven. Thus, the sun is the ruler of fire, the essence of Heaven, illuminating all without fail. When a person embodies utmost sincerity, the heart’s upright distress moves the sacred spirit of the heart, which then ascends to report to the sun. The sun, in turn, reports to Heaven. Thus, utmost sincerity within the five inner organs moves the spirits.\n\nHow can one not be cautious?\nPerfected One said: How awe-inspiring! How awe-inspiring! I, a foolish student, have overstepped in asking this—it fills me with great dread.\n\nTo know dread is the root of life. To be without dread is the gate of death. Safety and peril lie within yourself, not elsewhere. Though you ask the Heavenly Master repeatedly with fear and trembling, only by asking will you receive the decisive answer and profound understanding. Without asking, there would be no way to know.\n\nIndeed, your words are correct. If one remains in darkness and does not ask, when will clarity ever come? Speak—what else would you ask?\n\nNow that I have heard how utmost sincerity moves Heaven, I wish to hear how it moves Earth.\nExcellent! Your words grow ever deeper, and you spare nothing in your inquiry. Sit calmly, and I will explain it to you. I fear that if I do not speak, I may fail you.\n\nIt is as if Heaven itself grieves that later generations lack utmost sincerity, and thus sent the Perfected One to take up these questions.\nVery well.\n\nNow I will tell you—listen clearly.\nIndeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Go forth—when a person’s utmost sincerity takes hold of a thought, the heart aches with such pain that they cannot eat, their innards churning. What bears this thought is the heart, the mind; heart and mind do not forget. The liver is most benevolent, and so the eyes serve as its master, weeping tears—this is the utmost sincerity of concentrated thought. The heart is the essence of clarity. To hold a thought without ceasing is the work of the mind, of the spleen. The heart is pure yang, its station belonging to Heaven; the spleen is pure yin, its station belonging to Earth. When utmost sincerity fixes upon a single thought, the heart aches and tears flow. The heart commands the mind to direct the thought’s course, sending word to distant places. The mind is yin; when yin harbors sorrow, it must report to yang, thus ascending to inform the august spirits of Heaven. The spleen is yin, its home on Earth, and so it descends into the Earth to report. Thus Heaven and Earth shift on its behalf, and all spirits are moved by it.\n\nWould you know its great effect? I do not deceive you, Perfected One. Simply sit calmly in a secluded chamber, concentrate your heart and ponder the spirits—they will all come of their own accord. Is this not clear proof? This is the truth of utmost sincerity that I tell you; I have never spoken without method.\n\nThus, in seeking the Dao and virtue, all human conduct proceeds from utmost sincerity, and Heaven and Earth respond, spirits come to inform. Without utmost sincerity, one cannot move Heaven and Earth or stir the spirits. After the era of *chengfu*, people of later ages truly lacked faith, lacked utmost sincerity, and could not move Heaven and Earth. Together they deceived Heaven and Earth, and so the spirits ceaselessly harmed them.\n\nWould you hear how this is made clear? There is great evidence in the sun and moon. Now I would hear it. In later ages, people born of father and mother together neglected their parents, turned their backs on them—among ten thousand, not one was filial. Those who gained understanding from a teacher, who awakened and departed, then neglected their teacher, no longer treating them as their teacher, instead submitting to toil and hardship. Having risen from poverty and low station to wealth and nobility through their lord, they then turned to instruct their superiors, all joining in daily deception of those above. Among ten thousand, not one possessed sincerity and trustworthiness. The foolish masses together deceived the Three Bonds, acting in rebellion and without faith. Their transgressions were manifest, impossible to conceal below, all visible above to the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries. Thus Heaven and Earth deeply detested and despised them, cutting short their lives and bringing early death.\n\nIf one does not deeply reflect tenfold upon their grave transgressions, but instead weeps and wails in vain, calling Heaven cruel—what grievance is this? You bring suffering upon yourself; when has Heaven ever wronged you? How dreadful! Excellent, excellent. Foolish student, I have received your command.",

Thus, they are called the \"Utmost Dao, not to be transmitted\"—for they are not what ordinary people should hear, speak, or employ. Yet now the Heavenly Master has fully opened the path of Great Peace learning, commanding all to expound the essential texts of Dao and virtue, forbidding concealment. He declares that those who hide them incur Heaven’s condemnation, a sin that persists even unto death and flows into later generations. All are to be granted the true Dao and secret virtue—is this not grand indeed?\n\nYet when the petty and the noble are not distinguished, this foolish one believes that the true Dao and secret virtue should not be heard, spoken, or used by small-minded people.\n\n\"Alas! You now speak thus, bearing a ten-thousandfold deathly guilt before the August Heaven and Earth, a guilt that shall never be absolved. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, later generations have grown ever more shallow, envying the Dao. Small-minded people sever the treasures of Heaven and Earth, and this loss has accumulated over time, giving rise to *chengfu* (inherited burdens), causing Heaven’s disasters to never cease. Thus, within Heaven and Earth, not a single year passes in peace; calamities, omens, and bandits abound, and the state is plunged into sorrow and suffering—all arising from this.\n\nWhat you now say is precisely the cause: it confounds Heaven and overturns Earth, plunging governance into chaos, making the people ungovernable. Precisely so.\n\nYou now speak thus—do you not heap heavy enmity upon Heaven? Wrong, wrong! Your merit is undone. How so?\n\nWhen the essential Dao and good virtue are revealed for instruction, even small-minded people, upon obtaining and upholding them, will emulate and learn from one another, daring not to act wrongly. Among them, the lesser worthy who gain good Dao and virtue may become upright and compliant officials. The greater worthy may ascend to assist the state. Even the most ignorant at the lowest level will still become good people.\n\nHeaven employs the essential true Dao to generate all things, extending even to the six domestic animals and birds. The four seasons and five phases are the true essential Dao of Heaven and Earth, their divine treasures, the stored *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The six domestic animals and birds embrace it as their nature; grasses and trees obtain it and then grow. If Heaven did not bestow the complete essential Dao, how could they generate and grow one another?\n\nYet you, True One, say that small-minded people should not hear the essential Dao, should not speak it, should not use it. Do the divine protectors of Heaven and Earth preserve all species, while humans alone are less good than the six domestic animals and grasses? You yourself know that what you now say incurs a ten-thousandfold deathly sin, never to be absolved.\n\nThis foolish student has served the master but briefly and shallowly, not deeply understanding the Way of Heaven. Upon hearing the Heavenly Master’s words, I now realize my grave sin: I have failed the August Heaven above, the Earth below, and the virtuous lord in between. Yet your self-reproach is justified.\n\nIn all undertakings, can one not be cautious? The August Heaven alone observes the words of people’s mouths—why else would echoes follow human voices to determine fortune or misfortune? Thus, echoes respond without missing a single *zhu* or *fen*. Have you never observed this proof of Heaven and Earth’s resonance?\n\nYou should be cautious where you fall short; do not force reckless speech, for its harm is grave.\n\nYou now say the Utmost Dao is not to be transmitted to people—then how is it to be known? If the Utmost Dao is ultimately untransmittable, and the Way of Heaven is impartial, for whom alone should it exist?\n\nThis disciple will be cautious and vigilant; my conduct has been most improper.\n\nDo you wish to be like the vulgar and small-minded, teaching others to envy the Way of Heaven? \"I dare not, I dare not.\"\n\nTrue One, be meticulous in your vigilance. Once Heaven’s wrath is aroused, the sin incurred shall never be absolved. The Way of Heaven is precisely ruined by such words—do you now add to them?\n\nThat emperors and kings cannot govern their realms and frequently suffer disasters is entirely due to those like you. If you now speak thus, you cause the true Dao to be severed, heterodox ways to arise, and governance to become unmanageable.\n\nDo you understand? \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI have awakened; I am ashamed to have failed the Heavenly Master.\n\nAlways be cautious in your conduct. \"Yes, yes.\"\n\nI often reflect that my words incur fault, and wish not to speak, yet I do not know.\n\nSpeak plainly.\n\nWhat is it that people should not hear, should not speak, should not use?\n\nIt is not that ordinary people should not hear the true essential Dao or true essential virtue. Thus, when inferior teachers instruct small-minded people, they do not employ the essential secret Dao and true virtue to admonish and teach them. Instead, they use superficial, false, and artful writings to instruct ordinary people. Among them, the greater worthy who learn these false and artful writings proceed to deceive their lords. The middling worthy who study false writings become cunning officials, flattering and deceiving their superiors above while craftily oppressing the good and compliant people below. The inferior and small-minded who obtain these writings act without principle, deceiving their parents, outwitting their neighbors, or becoming unstoppable bandits.\n\nThe worthy and unworthy, officials and commoners, all engage in deceit and falsehood, unable to restrain one another. Witnessing this heterodoxy and impropriety, they disrupt the celestial patterns above and the terrestrial principles below, harm the accomplishments of the five phases, and rebel against the nurturing of the four seasons. Together, they deceive their superiors, plunging the state into chaos. The harm is extreme, beyond recounting.\n\nYet you, True One, say that small-minded people should not hear the essential Dao and virtue, and should instead be taught with false and artful matters, causing the people under Heaven to be dazzled, to learn and practice falsehood unknowingly, and to become utterly without the Dao. Is this so?\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the True One incurs the guilt of ten thousand deaths, a sin that cannot be absolved. What the world ought not hear, ought not speak, ought not employ—precisely this false literature, born of deceitful cunning and great treachery, arises from this. Therefore, I lay down the law for Heaven and establish teachings for the virtuous ruler, daring not to approach such matters, thereby exclusively opening the gate of the Dao and virtue while sealing off the paths of craft and deceit. Thus, my writings root themselves in the essence of the Dao and virtue, casting aside the methods of false texts and artful deceit, which are entirely excluded. Do you alone find this unremarkable?\n\nThis is deemed an affliction by Heaven and Earth, a harm by emperors and kings. I shall once more explain it fully to the True One: it concerns employing the essential Dao and virtue to instruct the small-minded. The most worthy may thereby uphold goodness and integrity; those of middling virtue and above may become the empire’s most virtuous ministers; those of lesser worth may be transformed into compliant and good officials; even the most foolish may still become cautious folk, unaware of how to harm one another.\n\nThus, from Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and constellations, all together nurture the myriad twelve thousand beings with the true Dao and essential virtue. Even the six domestic animals, dung, and grasses are clothed in its secret Dao and essential virtue, thereby attaining growth. Now, if the True One persists in such speech to the end, are such people not inferior to the six domestic animals, dung, and grasses?\n\nDo you now persist in speaking thus, unaware that your error is one of ten thousand deaths, a sin that cannot be erased? There is a deadly error, a deadly error. Do not feign ignorance—you simply fail to comprehend. What now is to be done about this error? To absolve it, on the day of purification, go to a vast wilderness where four roads meet, prostrate and kowtow in each of the four directions, performing five prostrations in each. First, gaze upward to Heaven, then turn and kowtow to the Earth. Assent, assent.\n\nNow, why does the Heavenly Master urgently instruct this foolish student? The urgency does not arise from the True One’s former status. Rather, the True One’s words violate the taboos of Heaven and Earth. Since the Highest Antiquity and Middle Antiquity, those who teach humanity have often been jealous of the true Dao and good virtue, instead teaching one another to flee and conceal it, to seal and cut it off, and to instruct with deceitful and cunning ways, leading the foolish into wrongdoing. The greatest worthies flee and withdraw from the world; only those of middling worth become officials, lacking the true Dao and thus disordering the people. The most foolish, devoid of the Dao, rise as bandits. When both people and ministers turn to heterodoxy, their clamor gathers like mosquitoes to shake the thunder, together rebelling against the celestial patterns, destroying the heavenly Dao, defying the will of Earth, reversing the qi of the four seasons, and disrupting the five phases. This gives rise to countless calamities and omens; the Three Luminaries lose their proper radiance; emperors and kings are plunged into great sorrow, falling into chaos and confusion, unable to govern in peace—all arising from this.\n\nDoes the True One truly not recognize the gravity of this sin?

      "translated_text": "Thus, one must conduct oneself in the wilderness, in places of clarity and brightness. The reason the Way extends in all four directions is that the Dao governs all affairs. The reason it extends in all directions is that it is entrusted to the four seasons, which Heaven employs to convey qi, thereby enabling you to ascend and commune with Heaven. The four seasons, benevolent in their generation and completion, also dissolve your transgressions before Heaven and Earth; all who later commit faults are but reflections of you.\n\nFrom this day forward, Heaven will severely punish those who do evil. Therefore, the noble person must always err on the side of great goodness and never on the side of great wickedness. Be cautious, be ever cautious. If even you act thus, how much more so the common and foolish? Mutual instruction breeds jealousy, and the Dao conceals itself—this is the way of things. What you have spoken is ever good.\n\nYet a single word today may be called a great rebellion against Heaven and Earth, the very sorrow that has afflicted rulers from ancient times to the present. Before you, True One, how could one be born a noble person? It is all through learning. To learn the Dao is to embody the Dao; to learn virtue is to attain it; to learn goodness is to become good; to learn the supreme Dao, goodness, and power is to live long into old age, ever increasing in virtue and excellence.\n\nThus, those who embrace the essential Dao, goodness, and power are called the recluses of emperors and kings, the foremost and most excellent of people, capable of aiding the noble in their transformation. Those who do not serve in office are the most reverent of people. Those who learn evil become evil; those who learn refinement become refined; those who learn deceit become deceitful; those who learn cunning become cunning.\n\nAmong those who learn, the most worthy may master eloquent speech, while those who study texts may craft artful writing. When petty people acquire such skills, they become treacherous. In your heart, can you truly refrain from teaching this? Therefore, the essential Dao and hidden power are what align with the heart of Heaven and the will of Earth, enabling the long-term peace of the state and bringing joy to emperors and kings. Yet they are suppressed and not vigorously promoted, so that when people offend Heaven, their sins remain unforgiven.\n\nHeaven acts through the supreme Dao, Earth dwells in supreme virtue, and together they generate the myriad things, concealing nothing and favoring none. Thus, the sages of antiquity modeled their conduct on Heaven and Earth, using the supreme Dao and essential power to instruct the foolish, making them reverent and good, so that governance became easy.\n\nIn this age, such teachings are often obstructed and severed, so the foolish collectively become treacherous. They lose the Dao of Heaven and do not recognize their own wrongdoing. The fault lies in the failure to practice the true Dao, goodness, and power, so people are frequently punished by Heaven, their deaths unforgiven. The foolish, lacking the Dao, disregard taboos and together violate Heaven and Earth, all because they do not know the essentials of Dao and virtue.\n\nThe reason I write these words, repeating and exhorting with such earnestness, is that I fear people will accumulate folly and, upon hearing a single word, fail to believe my text. Thus, I reiterate. People have long been accustomed to heterodoxy, and some may even call my words false. If the gates of the true Dao and hidden power are again severed and cease to function, Heaven’s wrath will not abate. Emperors will remain in sorrow, officials and people will have nowhere to turn, following one another into chaos, unable to save themselves. Test my words before Heaven, for they are precisely meant to resolve and dispel this fabricated Dao.\n\nPeople are all entangled in heterodox texts, their folly accumulated over time. Therefore, I constantly command the True One to bring forth my Dao and entrust it to a ruler of supreme morality, to show it to the worthy, and to swiftly test my Dao. Only then will they know the truth of my writings, which resemble Heaven and Earth. Without use or testing, how can one know their validity? Now, to ensure my Dao is not mistaken, I seek to have it tested—not just a single scroll.\n\nTrue One, be cautious. Indeed, indeed. Go forth and always heed my words; do not take them lightly or speak carelessly. Indeed, indeed. Do not conceal them; let all people, in their speech and learning, recognize what is gained and lost, and no longer act recklessly. Indeed, indeed.\n\n**Right: Resolving what people should not hear, should not speak, should not use—severing heterodoxy and revealing the true text.**\n\n**Serving the Master as One Serves a Father—Words to Become a Decisive Method, One Hundred Fifty-Five**\n\nNow, when the foolish speak, their words often miss the mark of the Heavenly Master’s heart, incurring repeated punishments and transgressions. They dare not ask about their faults, and even as the year draws to a close, they still do not know the way. I wish to ask one more question. How can the Way be leveled? Why be modest? To ask when one does not know is the proper course.\n\nNow, to teach the supreme essential Dao and power to ordinary people—have they truly not understood it greatly? Excellent are your words. What great understanding could there be? Why do you doubt this? I have heard that if a son’s wisdom surpasses his father’s, a disciple’s surpasses his teacher’s, or a minister’s surpasses his lord’s, it is called a lesser worthy’s wisdom surpassing their superior, which is deemed improper.\n\nYour words are both correct and incorrect. When the wisdom of inferiors surpasses that of superiors, it is indeed inappropriate. If the wisdom of inferiors is used to craft cunning and deceit, surpassing their superiors, they will deceive those above them. If you wish to see the effects, consider this: in teaching and learning, if a disciple’s skill surpasses his master’s, he will harm his master. When those below study treacherous, deceitful, and devious ways, they collectively confuse and deceive their superiors.\n\nThus, the great sages of antiquity dared not recklessly teach treacherous, cunning, or deceitful arts. They always deeply contemplated the root and severed the branches, preventing the foolish from knowing them. To govern a state with treacherous wisdom is to be a great thief of the state. Therefore, the sages of old always focused on teaching the true Dao and never imparted superficial, deceptive, or cunning arts. Knowing the great harm they would cause, they constantly closed the paths of inauspicious learning and opened the roads of auspicious conduct, so that people would remain reverent and unaware of how to do wrong.\n\nIf you wish to further confirm this truth, consider that in the era of the Three Sovereigns, rulers treated their ministers as teachers, like fathers. At that time, ministers each embraced the essential Dao and power, and there were no cunning, deceitful, or treacherous people.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, in that era, ministers’ wisdom all surpassed their rulers, enabling them to serve as teachers to emperors and kings. Their instruction was like that of fathers, and so rulers treated them as both teachers and fathers—this was because their Dao and virtue exceeded those of their rulers. Therefore, they could cause their rulers to sit at ease, governing with folded arms and free from worry.\n\nThus, those whose words hit the mark ten times out of ten could assist emperors and kings; those who succeeded nine times out of ten could aid great ministers; those who succeeded eight times out of ten could serve as minor officials. Below this, their counsel was not worth heeding. Words that missed the mark were called reckless speech, misleading and confusing their superiors.\n\nDo you understand this?\nYes, indeed.\n\nCome, if you wish to further confirm its great effect: by the time of the Five Emperors, the Dao had slightly declined, and so rulers and ministers could no longer inquire of one another regarding Dao and virtue. Those who shared the same school became cliques, and those of like mind became friends. Though rulers and ministers shared knowledge, they could no longer greatly surpass one another. The essential Dao and secret virtue were slightly obstructed and no longer flowed freely, so they could no longer be treated as teachers or fathers, but only as friends.\n\nBy the time of the Three Kings, those who taught were often jealous of learning, blocking and cutting off the true Dao and extraordinary virtue. Their disciples grew increasingly foolish and ignorant, instead indulging in superficial embellishments, causing rulers to become confused and their Dao and virtue to grow shallow. They were no longer worthy of being treated as fathers or friends, so they were treated as subordinates. Their wisdom was scant, and so they could not assist emperors and kings in discerning the difficulty or ease of governance.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth grew greatly enraged, and disasters and calamities arose in succession, impossible to suppress or eradicate.

      "translated_text": "Having realized this, child, I shall now elucidate it further for you.\n\nIn the age of the Five Hegemons, none of their ministers possessed true Dao or virtue. All were adept at crafting cunning deceits, employing the arts of fraud and treachery to deceive one another. Their ministers, steeped in wickedness, flattery, and falsehood, mastered the ways of startling and confounding others—sometimes even surpassing their rulers. Thus, rebellion arose: sons slew their fathers, ministers murdered their lords, and subordinates killed their superiors. All harbored the hearts of barbarians, devoid of righteousness. Each person wielded deceitful schemes, every heart concealed treachery, and none held fast to the true Dao. Hence, rebellions occurred time and again.\n\nFor this reason, the executioner’s axe and drill were ever at the ready, and ministers were regarded as entries in a death ledger. Their ministers, in turn, were filled with flattery and embellishment, their cunning and deceit rendering the Way of no weight. Thus, they were treated as mere livestock—this is the clear proof.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity, aligning with the will of Heaven, embraced the true Dao, honored virtuous scholars and benevolent men, and banished the flattering and deceitful.

      "translated_text": "The foolish student deeply worries: what should be the great precepts of the Dao to attain full completion? What should be the great precepts of study to obtain high office? What should be the great precepts of managing life and accumulating wealth to achieve success?\n\nNow, unable to reach the Heavenly Master’s power to resolve these doubts, I fear remaining forever benighted, never enlightened, and thus unable to know the truth.\n\nExcellent, excellent! When the various Perfected Ones ask about doubtful matters, Heaven sends you to inquire. Very well. Sit calmly, listen attentively with your whole being, and I shall now fully expound it to you, Perfected One, so that it may be clearly known and remembered by your own effort. Yes, yes.\n\nGo forth—later generations who obtain my writings shall have the true Dao’s path widely opened for them, and they will surely all study the true Dao. The true Dao often interacts with spirits, and the spirit-way is solely concerned with human affairs. Spirits delight in those who are kind to people, yet startle those who do not see them; they do not contend in speech with people but appear like flocks of birds coming and going without end. Some speak of people transcending and departing, some of people becoming wealthy and noble, some of people falling into poverty and lowliness; they praise or slander others, bring people great joy or constant bitter resentment.\n\nSpirits have no fixed form—they are beings of endless transformation. If one can focus the mind and guard oneself, refusing to heed their words, examining the heart before acting, keeping the mouth sealed to avoid transmitting their speech, and not following their sorrows, angers, or joys, steadfastly holding to the original foundation without wavering, striving to secretly benefit people and all things without wishing harm—then, after a year of knowing the Dao, one will always act with supreme goodness, seeking benefit without injury, pursuing the Dao and goodness until the end of one’s years without daring to slacken. Even if one fails to transcend the world ten thousand times, one will encounter great fortune rather than misfortune even once.\n\nIn this way, the host of spirits will together protect and assist such a person, causing them to delight daily in goodness and no longer commit evil. Does the Perfected One understand? Yes, yes. Go forth—you have now understood.\n\nGo forth, and I shall tell you, Perfected One, of those who bring chaos and ruin upon themselves. When a person’s mind and intent are not single-minded and pure, when they are easily pleased or angered, easily startled or confused, when they are glib of speech and quick-witted, always desiring to speak of good and evil with no ability to conceal—when they encounter something and cannot restrain themselves from speaking—then the host of spirits will come together to deceive them.\n\nSome, being petty, will ascend to utter perverse words and die; some will engage in constant quarrels and reckless speech; some will be startled by ghosts and spirits, falling into madness and illness. When the mind is greatly distracted, not devoted to one thing, when joy and anger are without constancy, when actions lose their correctness, when one is confused and without direction—then one may lose worthy friends and good advisors, thereby facing peril and ruin.\n\nThe greatest fault lies in not loving benefit: those above do not seek to benefit those below, listen to evil spirits, and instead desire to harm. Thus, the worthy depart, and one loses their aid. As for the petty, they do not honor and respect their superiors but instead listen to the deceit and falsehoods of evil spirits, uttering perverse and reckless words. This is the path by which the Dao is not accomplished, the gateway to misfortune—I cannot foresee or recount all its forms.\n\nGenerally, when a person’s mind cannot remain single-minded, firm, and secretive, they are easily swayed. Their actions often bring misfortune, their conduct mostly leads to harm and calamity, and their faults and transgressions accumulate in great number, beyond full recounting. I merely outline the great principles for you, Perfected One, revealing their beginnings, so that the wise and discerning who deeply examine my writings may carefully follow and investigate them, thereby surely understanding.\n\nDoes the Perfected One perhaps not comprehend? Yes, yes. Go forth—you have now greatly awakened. Hold fast to my writings as profound precepts, and those who practice them may avoid misfortune and harm for ten thousand generations. Truly... Thus, later generations who read my writings, from beginning to end, fully grasping their essential meaning and putting it into practice, will not fail even once.\n\nHold to this without ceasing, and it will naturally be fulfilled. With a single-minded, kind intent, one may interact and unite with spirits. With a perverse, evil intent, the Dao is surely lost. If the great do not listen carefully, they may lose their rightful position; if the petty do not listen carefully, they may join with perversity. These all become harms to one’s person—one cannot but greatly guard and be cautious against them.\n\nIn all matters, when people commit transgressions, they bring them upon themselves. Calamities and changes arise close at hand from within the heart and mind, not from elsewhere. Does the Perfected One understand? Yes, yes.",

      "translated_text": "The One Hundred Fifty-Seventh Admonition on the Failures and Successes in the Dao\n\nThe Master continued his discourse to the disciple, saying: Those who do not transcend the world harbor intentions that, upon entering the gate of learning today, take no joy in contemplating and attaining the true Dao and its virtuous teachings. Instead, they seek only broad knowledge and extensive observation, believing these can exhaust the sagely Way. They take no joy in promoting and practicing goodness, but rather delight in the superficial and ostentatious, which can be used to deceive and falsify.\n\nSome, having already entered the study of the classics and the Dao, yet apply their minds without singular focus, constantly desiring to speak falsely, to excel in clever speech, and to make harming others their vocation. They neither respect their superiors nor benefit and cherish their subordinates. Their conduct and the classics and Dao are truly empty and hollow. They are unfit to be worthy ministers to emperors and kings, and instead become mere keepers of the status quo.\n\nOthers use wealth and goods to aid themselves, desiring high office to establish their reputation. Thereby, they steal and seize wealth and profit, turning public resources to private gain, betraying those above and exploiting those below. These are the ones who disrupt and corrupt proper governance, the scourge of Heaven and Earth, the thieves of the state. They are tigers and wolves among the people, wicked children to their parents. Heaven and Earth detest them, and the spirits loathe them. Thus, when their crimes are exposed, they are often punished by emperors and kings to align with the will of Heaven and to relieve the people of great harm. These are the ones who obtain office through deceit.\n\nSome, their minds unfocused and truly empty without genuine commitment, instead constantly contemplate desiring office. Office is the celestial office of the constellations, bestowed upon those of virtue and rewarding those of merit. It is not recklessly given to those without merit. Those without merit are disregarded by Heaven and Earth and unloved by the divine spirits. The foolish below, unable to deeply recognize their own faults, recklessly and ceaselessly desire celestial office. Thereupon, demonic forces collectively descend upon their minds, causing them to speak falsely and utter inauspicious words, unable to restrain themselves. Thus, there are those who die from perverse speech—this is what it means. Not only in the pursuit of the Dao, but in all things, failing to grasp its essence brings misfortune.\n\nIn all human conduct, one should not delight in goodness to avoid all misfortune. Perfected One, exert yourself. You are fortunate to have a virtuous intent, always desiring to cherish and benefit as your endeavor—you have transcended. Nevertheless, for both the Perfected and the common, whether one transcends or not does not lie in the beginning but in the end. All failures stem from not cherishing oneself, from taking oneself lightly, from claiming to have transcended, yet harboring faults within and thus failing to transcend.\n\nTherefore, if I now speak without ceasing, it is because the Perfected One compels me to continue. If I were to halt my discourse midway, taking myself lightly and remaining silent, I would fear incurring the Perfected One’s resentment. If the Perfected One resents me, he would look up to Heaven, and Heaven would in turn bring harm upon me. Thus, I dare not speak lightly, taking my studies lightly and ceasing midway. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.\n\nThus, the harm that befalls the common is like this. It often arises from not comprehending, from not aligning with the fundamental. Therefore, one loses the Way. Since you have rendered great service to Heaven, exert yourself, exert yourself. Indeed, indeed. I dare not take my studies and the Dao lightly.\n\nGo forth. You have already understood the art of self-transcendence; I have nothing more to add. The Master continued to expound to the Perfected One in detail:\n\nThere are those who delight in managing their households and accumulating wealth, attaining riches and honor. In their youth, they are capable of labor and, as they grow, contemplate their affairs, exerting their strength to the utmost before ceasing. They are able to extol goodness and conceal faults, always delighting in doing good, constantly and reverently contemplating respect for their superiors. In all matters of doubt, they are cautious and vigilant, daring not act recklessly. They cherish their subordinates and desire not to harm others, do not pervert the king’s law, and take no joy in following perverse rituals or indulging in feasting and drinking.\n\nIn all non-urgent matters, they dare not partake. Those who knowingly conduct themselves thus continue until old age without ceasing. Though they may appear empty in substance, their words are not frivolous. Thus, they are able to amass treasures and accumulate wealth, thereby becoming accomplished individuals.\n\nPeople, whether worthy or unworthy, differ in their intentions. There are those who are not good, who disrespect their superiors and harm their subordinates, delight in following perverse rituals, and frequently engage in non-urgent and improper conduct. They are glib in speech, unable to restrain themselves in the marketplace, and are indeed people of misfortune, disorder, peril, and ruin—these are not followers of the Dao. Do you understand? Indeed, indeed.",
      "overlap_context": "modern calamities and changes. Their conduct and learning benefit those above and aid those below. Their accumulated goodness cannot be concealed, and their fame spreads far and wide. Enlightened rulers favor them, summoning and appointing them, while the common people all say, “Excellent!” and “Most auspicious!” This is such a person—others speak of their joy on their behalf.\n\nSuch a one is a good person, one who studies to transcend the world. Do you, Perfected One, understand? Indeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, those who follow the Dao must concentrate their minds, seal their mouths, and refrain from reckless speech.\n\nTherefore, the sages and worthies of antiquity observed the luminous patterns of Heaven and so were able to practice the Dao and uphold virtue. Heaven is singularly devoted: day and night it follows the Dao without speech, and thus it alone attains auspiciousness. Earth, too, day and night follows the Dao without speech, nurturing the myriad things, and thus it alone endures in tranquility. The four seasons alone follow the Dao, ceaselessly moving day and night, and thus they alone perpetually flourish and reign without end. The Three Luminaries alone follow the true Dao without speech, and thus they remain eternally bright, revolving in accord with Heaven. The Five Phases alone follow the true Dao without speech, and thus they endure as constants with Heaven and Earth. All under Heaven who practice the Dao emulate these examples without exception.\n\nThus, those who cherish and benefit others, whose mouths do not speak recklessly, may attain the Dao. Those who treat matters with frivolity and disregard, who contradict these words, will invariably be harmed by the Dao—there is not a single exception. Since you, Perfected One, have come from afar to seek answers to your doubts, I offer this admonition to you. Ponder and reflect upon this text; I do not fail you. I speak on behalf of Heaven to admonish the people of the virtuous and noble ruler. Heaven bestows upon the virtuous ruler, who must surely favor the Dao, and the common people will emulate their ruler, all taking this text as their great precept. Thus, they may attain good fortune and distance themselves from misfortune.\n\nThis scripture is issued to admonish the ignorant; guard it well and do not conceal it.\nIndeed, indeed.\nProceed.\n\nThis discourse on admonition may seem small yet yields greatness, appear shallow yet proves profound. What does this mean? Though its words may seem minor, its admonitions are truly vast. Though its language may resemble the arguments of common sophists—seeming too slight to transmit—its guidance for cultivating others is indeed profound.\n\nThus, when I compose the Dao for the Perfected One, in its vastness it penetrates to the boundless, and in its subtlety it permeates without enclosure. In exaltation, it reaches the utmost heights; in humility, it extends to the lowest depths. Therefore, it encompasses the divine and the enslaved alike. The reason for this is to ensure that whether the great or the small, the worthy or the common, all may find its words sufficient. Why is this so?\n\nWould that I might hear your intent.\nExcellent is your inquiry; you have grasped its meaning. Thus, I compose this scripture for the ruler of Great Peace. When the ruler of Great Peace governs, they must emulate Heaven as their model, not like the lord of a small state, who rules only within a single domain.\n\nTherefore, Heaven’s emulation as a model is exalted without superior, humble without inferior, vast without exterior, and minute without interior. It embraces and nurtures the twelve thousand things, whether good or evil, great or small, all are benefited and protected. It endows them with primordial qi to bring them to life and does not harm or injure them in the end. Thus, it is most fittingly called the divine, the supreme ruler without peer.\n\nNow, as the qi of the Highest August arrives and the virtuous ruler governs, they must emulate this as their model. Thus, my Dao ascends and descends, sinks and rises, so that the multitude of worthies may together examine it. Therefore, in the southeast lies the Earth’s Gate, where waters sustain Heaven’s pillar, not resisting even the smallest flow. Whether good or evil, great or small, all return to it.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\nIndeed, indeed.",

To practice the Dao without grasping its intent is like pointing south while asking about the north. With such a misdirected mind, even after ages of study, nothing will be attained. You dare not proceed further—you have already understood.\n\n*(Right: A collection of questions on the Dao’s precepts, the governance of life, and the origins of success and failure, fortune and misfortune.)*\n\n**Verifying the Texts: The Formula for Longevity, One Hundred Fifty-Eighth**\n\nI wish to ask about one doubtful matter.\nSpeak.\nNow, while the Heavenly Master is still here, I wish to inquire about the formulas within the texts: Is there a way for a person to live truly long, to work alongside others without ever growing weary? May I hear of this?\nIndeed, do you seek to examine all texts to discern where the worthy reside?\nYes.\nBe seated, and I shall explain it to you, Perfected One.\n\nTo amass texts by the hundreds of millions yet fail to attain longevity—what benefit is there to one’s life? To fill a chamber with writings yet fail to govern with order—what benefit is there to governance? To fill the court with ministers yet fail to bring the ruler great peace and joy—what benefit is there to the emperor? To father a hundred children yet leave one’s parents to hunger and cold—what benefit is there to one’s kin? To pile remedies as heavy as a cartload yet fail to extend life—what benefit is there to human destiny? To endlessly expound on matters yet fail to rid the ruler of disasters—what benefit is there to the court?\n\nSuch examples are countless, beyond enumeration. I merely raise the essentials for you, Perfected One, that all worthies may reflect deeply upon them.\nI wish to see their effects.\nDo you truly wish to know?\nYes, Heavenly Master.\nVery well. Sit calmly and focus, and I shall explain it to you.\n\nAmong hundreds of millions of texts, only those that can lengthen life, enrich destiny, and secure the body are true texts—the rest are not. Among chambers filled with writings, only those that align with Heaven’s will and bring order to governance are true texts—the rest are not. Among ministers filling the court, only those who bring joy to their ruler and assist in achieving great peace are the true ministers and worthy officials of the emperor—the rest are mere functionaries. Among children born to a person, only those who ensure their parents’ constant joy and freedom from hunger and cold are filial and virtuous—the rest are but numbers fulfilled. Among remedies piled as heavy as a cartload, only those that extend years are true remedies—the rest are not.\n\nSuch comparisons in the world are too numerous to list in advance. Perfected One, ponder their meaning deeply. My words use one to infer ten thousand, sufficient to illuminate the Dao of all under Heaven. Thus, I instruct you to transmit the Dao to the ruler of Earth’s virtue, to gather and examine all common texts and the words of scholars, clarifying them for all worthies so that together they may awaken from delusion and confusion.\n\nOnce all common texts have been examined, disasters will depart by the day. For false texts and deceitful words are the masters of calamity and treachery. True texts and upright words are the officials that expel evil and wickedness. When texts are rectified and words are rectified, treachery has no master and thus nowhere to abide.\n\nFalse texts and deceitful words as masters of treachery are like thieves and bandits with a host to shelter them.

      "translated_text": "Go now—the Dao of Heaven’s method is to take the One to illuminate the myriad, yet it cannot be fully inscribed. Perfected One, having received this, you must deeply ponder its essential meaning. The wise and enlightened, whose hearts possess nine apertures, readily comprehend; upon seeing the text, they awaken of themselves. No further questions are needed.\n\n*Textual pause.*\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nExcessive texts bewilder the mind; it is better to raise a single guiding principle, so that the ten thousand strands arrange themselves and unfold. Thus, the teeming masses, though numerous, are not equal to one emperor. The countless stars, though innumerable, are not equal to the brightness of a single sun. The clamorous words of crawling creatures filling the heavens are not equal to one worthy minister in a kingdom. The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, without end—yet it is not equal to the single primordial qi that holds the mandate’s guiding thread with Heaven.\n\nThe ruler of supreme virtue, if wise, deeply reflects on my words, and longevity will naturally extend. If later generations together ponder my words, fathers will be kind and sons filial, their virtue daily expanding and brightening. Mothers will be loving and wives obedient, and the entire realm will rise at dawn as one, all worthy and good. Great and small will vie in goodness, and the latter will have no strength to resist. No longer will there be false texts, nor will flatterers find refuge in them. Disasters and omens will be wholly dispelled, and the two luminaries will shine clearly. This is the art of spontaneity, uniformly practiced by the celestial spirits.\n\nIs this how the Dao is enacted? What sorrow could remain in such great joy? To take this as the method is to follow Heaven’s course. Who records it? It is the numinous work of Heaven and Earth. The texts of verification resonate in harmony with Heaven and Earth—this is the tally of Heaven’s trust.\n\nRulers and worthies should together examine these words. Those who practice them will daily prosper, aligning with the times as if by appointment. They will attain what Heaven and Earth desire—how auspicious! When yin and yang flow in accord, wind and rain come in season, and the ten thousand changes vanish. By the verifying texts, I do not praise myself. Truly, I know this—not merely embellished speech. You should swiftly put it into effect.\n\nPerfected One, do you understand?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nGo forth, go forth.

      "translated_text": "The nature of Heaven and Earth is such that yang loves yin, and yin loves yang. Thus, yang ought to transform into yin, and yin ought to transform into yang. All principles of yin and yang are like this. They mutually love one another, so their refinement and cultivation progress swiftly. However, one must □□ with graded instructions—it cannot be directly taught to others. Otherwise, one falls into heterodoxy.\n\nNow listen carefully: the yang transforms its form to become the yin form, and the yin transforms its form to become the yang form. It is precisely through one’s own body that one embodies the other’s appearance. It cannot be directly attained, or one will fall into heterodoxy.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nIf you still doubt after understanding, then—\nAh! Why is this so difficult for you to grasp? Simply use your own body to assume the other’s form. The yang becomes like the body of a yin person, and the yin becomes like the body of a yang person.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nYou have now understood. Go forth, and the matter will become clear.\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n*Here ends the collection of difficult-to-comprehend texts, the essential methods distinguishing the worthy from the unworthy, and the true principles of yin-yang reversal of form for governing the Dao.*\n\n**Method of Embracing Heaven and Enveloping Earth, Guarding Qi Without Ceasing, One Hundred Sixtieth**\n\nI wish to ask Your Celestial Master one more matter and then cease.\nSpeak—what doubt remains?\nThe Dao embraces Heaven and envelops Earth—who sustains its qi and observes its signs?\nProfound, far-reaching, and wondrous is your question!\nWhy do you ask this after seeing what you have seen?\nI have seen and witnessed the Way of Heaven and Earth, yet I do not understand its ultimate limit, so I ask in wonder.\nExcellent! Your words penetrate subtle meaning.\nThe reason the Way of Heaven and Earth endures long and forever is that it guards qi without ceasing. Thus, Heaven relies solely on qi for fortune and misfortune; all things perish without qi. If you do not wish to meet your end, you should unite with qi as the Mysterious Female, emulate Heaven’s work—how then could you die?\n\nYet this cannot be swiftly attained; it requires entering the secluded chamber. Within the chamber, contemplate the Dao, naturally abstain from food, and join with qi. Thus, you become one with the spirits of Heaven and Earth, no longer bound by worldly governance. You ascend to follow the Great One of Heaven, pay homage at the Central Ultimate, receive the talisman, and traverse the six directions and eight distant realms without end. Reflect on the words of this text, and you will attain it—the steps to becoming a spirit will be visible.\n\nDeparting the world to ascend to Heaven and govern, you will no longer be seen. If you wish to further witness its clear effects: in this world, one cannot long possess and govern alone. Thus, those who attain the Dao fly upward to Heaven—this is their departure from the world. Those who refuse to diligently cultivate the Dao descend into the earth at death, unable to long dwell in the middle realm. Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, sages have departed to seclude themselves; their sacred texts remain as constant models, yet their persons are unseen—this is the clear proof.\n\nThose who do not die and attain the Dao ascend to Heaven; those who die descend into the earth, unable to long remain on the harmonious path of the middle. If you grasp my text, ponder its meaning deeply. If you delight in ascending and wish to live forever, joining your strength with Heaven, partaking in the seasonal sacrifices and feasts of the world—strive to practice the true Dao, for this is its purifying method. If you do not delight in eternal life but delight in death, abandon the Dao and follow the vulgar, and you too will return to the earth below, no longer able to gaze upon the sun, moon, stars, and celestial cycles.\n\nMy text is □□—ten thousand times ten thousand, not a single word is amiss. Thus, the sages and worthies of antiquity have all departed, and none remain visible—this is the great proof. Reflect for yourself: if you delight in ascending, you will ascend; if you delight in descending, you will descend. None can wrest your will from you.\n\nThus, I, the Virtuous Lord of Great Peace, have established this method without resentment toward any single person. When the qi of Great Peace arrives, if even one person harbors grievance and does not attain their desire, then the balanced qi of the Supreme August cannot fully descend. Therefore, Heaven has commanded me to broadly open the path, allowing each to freely choose what they may do.\n\nThose of wisdom and clarity who delight in life may study my text, contemplate its meaning, enter the chamber to accomplish the Dao, and attain life. Those of gentle virtue who delight in assisting emperors and kings in governance may model their actions on my text to bring about Great Peace. Those who delight in managing households, nurturing life, and accumulating wealth may ponder my text and live out their Heaven-appointed years before dying. Thus, each attains their heart’s desire, and none harbors great grievance.\n\nTherefore, the qi of Great Peace comes forth. The term \"peace\" means level and without grievance—hence, it is called \"peace.\" Thus, when the Virtuous Lord governs, the qi of Great Peace arises. The reason is that the world harbors no grievances; each attains what they delight in. This is why I have charged the Perfected Ones to entrust it to the lord of supreme virtue.\n\nThe lord of supreme virtue must be benevolent, worthy, and enlightened. The enlightened do not wrest away what others desire but must win the hearts of all under Heaven, wishing to align with Heaven’s will and return to the Dao.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.",

The text has already briefly explained what can be seen—why do you ask again?\nMy dull heart is closed and slow to open; I can only inquire of Your Celestial Master for the decisive teaching.\nVery well.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 161: The Key to Appointing Officials and Their Gains and Losses**\n\nProceed with utmost caution, Perfected One, in even a single word, that your governance may resemble the movement of Heaven. The Way of Heaven does not wrest away what others desire to do. The Way of Earth likewise does not wrest away what others desire to do. The enlightened lord delights in emulating Heaven and Earth, never wresting away what others do. Thus, in resembling Heaven and Earth, he alone endures and is called Heaven and Earth, winning their hearts.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nWhen Heaven turns malign and the year portends great calamity, it is ever because it harms what people strive to do. Thus, the people reap nothing, and the year brings famine and cold. When Earth turns malign, it injures what nourishes people; roots weaken and sicken, harvests fail, and the people suffer hardship and poverty.\n\nA declining, wicked lord courts disaster when he appoints officials without regard for their fitness for office. This is called deliberately disrupting Heaven’s bureaucracy, violating Heaven’s prohibitions, and forsaking Heaven’s norms. He reverses course to impose blame and punishment, never considering whether one’s strength is insufficient or human capacity falls short. It is like suddenly commanding a lord to walk a hundred *li*—one fears he cannot reach the end and halts midway. What humans cannot achieve is precisely this.\n\nThus, to appoint men without selection and recklessly assign them office is to be called one who distresses the people and endangers the state—one who throws governance into chaos and invites ruin. Heaven and Earth are supremely numinous and luminous, yet even they dare not wrest away what others desire to do. To do so is to bring a year of great calamity—how much worse for mortal men?\n\nPerfected One, have you awakened from confusion and gained clarity?\nIndeed, indeed.",

It leads to the juncture of the spontaneous, where those who carefully delight in it endure, while those who are reckless perish. Be cautious, be ever cautious.\n\nDo no harm, nor seek it; goodness arises of itself, and evil collapses of itself. Contemplate these two portents and ponder their benefits and harms.\n\nAll matters under Heaven follow their kind; even in the space of a hair’s breadth, there is no deviation. Yet people fail to refine themselves, remaining ignorant of their own nature. Once the name of guilt is affixed, nothing can be done. Those who do not preserve their root will die with lingering transgressions, for evil arises within, and perverse qi summons its like from without.\n\nThus, before them lies the harm of imprisonment, and behind them, malevolent spirits—all hastening to contend, unable to cease, leading to the destruction of the self. Therefore, these diagrams are drawn to admonish later worthies, serving as a great warning.\n\nThe foolish do not believe in the Dao, treating matters with indifference.

My early studies were deficient, and my inquiries trivial—mere superficial embellishments. I had originally sought the method of *guarding the One* and nurturing nature, comprising three hundred chapters, yet upon meeting the Heavenly Master, I found his discourse boundless. Thus, I dared to ask: *Can the body attain enduring existence?*\n\nNot yet having heard the Heavenly Master’s boundless teachings, I ventured to inquire about minor governance. Only after hearing his discourse without limit did I dare to ask in full: *Since the opening of Heaven and Earth, how have emperors succeeded one another, bearing sorrow and hardship? Why do celestial disasters and strange omens never cease? How may they be eliminated? Furthermore, why do the host of spirits, without cause, harm humanity, preventing people from fulfilling their allotted years? How may this be halted?*\n\nNow, having received the Heavenly Master’s stern instructions and profound warnings, when ought this book—meant to suppress deceit and revive the Dao of Heaven and Earth—be revealed? It shall emerge in the year *yisi*, entrusted to couriers for dissemination. Thereafter, in every year marked by *xuanjia*, it shall be brought forth, for this is the first of Heaven’s celestial stems, the supreme beginning of the cycle. It aligns with the primordial *qi* and shall be presented to the state, front and back, to resolve the successive calamities inherited since the inception of Heaven and Earth.\n\nBy what title shall it be conveyed? Its teachings are layered and profound, its characters known only to the deeply initiated. Do not allow the leakage of the harmonious *qi* of August Heaven or the foremost Dao. It shall be transmitted to those capable of receiving and expounding it. When the time of *xuanjia* arrives, should one appear eager for this book, present it first to those who *guard the One* amid superficiality. Having entrusted it to couriers and *fangshi*, it shall be delivered to a ruler of utmost virtue.\n\nWhat does this mean? *One who obtains it and practices it is the rightful recipient; one who does not practice it is not.* The Perfected One must not release it prematurely. For Heaven’s wrath is fierce—it slays in retribution. My warnings are fully set forth herein. Thus, I speak cautiously, truly fearing Heaven’s judgment.\n\nNow, the Heavenly Master instructs his foolish disciple, whose heart is heavy with reverence, as if already foreseeing the consequences. I dare not betray this trust. I earnestly ask: *How ought the illustrations of divine robes be depicted?* They must all emulate Heaven’s law, not follow worldly custom. Those who do not comprehend Heaven’s law depict figures arbitrarily, clothing them as they fancy. Robes, however, follow the colors of the Five Phases.\n\nNow, let the mother envelop the child within, arranging colors in sequence. The most layered robes have five; the moderately layered, four; the lesser layered, three; the subtly layered, two—symbolizing the union of *yin* and *yang*. The grand assemblage robe has six layers of chaotic hues.\n\n*What does the five-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the harmonious convergence of the *qi* of the Five Phases.\n\n*What does the four-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the cyclic generation of the four seasons.\n\n*What does the three-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes father, mother, and child—the harmonious union of *yin* and *yang*.\n\n*What does the two-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the mutual support of the sovereign and ministering *qi*.\n\n*What does the six-layered robe represent?*\nIt symbolizes the intermingled colors of the six directions.\n\nThus, the world possesses variegated hues—this is what it signifies.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Go forth, and guard the secret illustrations with care.",

      "translated_text": "\"Yes, yes.\n\nNow, though your disciple is most foolish and lowly, by grace I have long been permitted to study the texts of the Heavenly Master. In all matters, my understanding has been swift and complete. Yet I still wish to ask one further question.\n\nSpeak plainly.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nI have observed that since the opening of Heaven and Earth, texts and scriptures have emerged not once but many times, accumulating in great number. Moreover, many have come forth from the Yellow River and Luo River. Why, then, does this present text not require their emergence?\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Your question is apt, for Heaven has moved you to speak—you have grasped its intent.\n\nToday, Heaven has fully charged me to reveal to emperors, kings, and the people the full account of *chengfu* (inherited responsibility and retribution). The accumulated texts are too numerous to be brought forth solely through the River and Luo writings. The River and Luo texts are vast in their revelations, and their divination slips too numerous to be fully known through divination alone. Thus, Heaven acts through people to bring them forth.\n\nHeaven knows me deeply and has entrusted me with this message. Knowing the difficulty of such questions, it has instead sent you to transmit its essential words with me. You, too, must understand: if one studies without attaining the heart of the Dao, what purpose does a Perfected Person serve?\n\nNow, I am dull and benighted, unaware of myself.\n\n[The preceding question concludes the section on the secret illustrations of robes and texts.]\n\n**Rank and Transmission of Texts; The Sealed and Obstructed Bring Illness—Decisions 166**\n\nYou have come from Heaven to seek answers, and I am Heaven’s instrument to instruct you.\n\nI wish to understand the meaning of this decision. By what is it made clear?\n\nHow is it further clarified?\n\nWhen a virtuous ruler obtains my texts, comprehends them in his heart, and practices them, consulting with worthy ministers to transform the common people, he will surely resonate with Heaven’s response—this is its clear proof. My Dao is perfected through admonition, not through false words or self-serving teachings.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nYour disciple is unworthy and has often troubled the Heavenly Master in vain.\n\nIf you do not ask, there is no way to know. I have long held this learning, yet there has been no one with whom to speak, so I have not transmitted it in due time. Now, if people cannot distinguish black from white, the fault lies with me.\n\nToday, I am truly overjoyed to transmit this to you, a Perfected One. It is like ascending a tower in spring and emerging to behold the boundless sky—what could compare?\n\nHeaven’s grievances have accumulated, and illnesses and transformations never cease. This pent-up stagnation, now released through speech with you, brings joy. Why does the Heavenly Master not go forth himself to establish the ranks?\n\nMy office is in Heaven, while yours, Perfected One, is on Earth. Earth gives birth to the myriad things, and thus Heaven nurtures what it generates upon the Earth. Therefore, I transmit the Dao to you. Earth gives rise to rulers, common people, and the twelve thousand things, all receiving the bestowal of *yang* and emerging from *yin*—thus, you transmit it to humanity.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! This foolish one marvels greatly.\n\nHad I not earnestly questioned the Heavenly Master, there would have been no way to know. I merely guessed and dared to ask presumptuously.\n\nWell done! You are one who understands matters—this is not your effort alone. Truly, Heaven has bestowed its intent upon your heart to speak.\n\nNow, though you were once benighted and unaware of your own conduct, you have come to great self-knowledge, illuminated like the light of the sun and moon. If you doubt my words, consider this: though Heaven may wish to reveal something, it does not speak directly to people, making its will difficult to discern. My texts follow Heaven’s commands, clarifying the cinnabar and azure.\n\nIf you were to conceal or suppress my writings, refusing to bring them forth in due time, Heaven would afflict you with illness and misfortune. If you continue to obstruct them, you will meet with calamity. This is Heaven’s way of sending you to seek answers—its clear proof that the Perfected One must bring them forth as a testament of faith.\n\nExcellent! Excellent! Perfected One, take heed and guard this warning.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThe Heavenly Master’s duty is to cover all under Heaven, and I cannot refuse.\n\nI wish to ask one more question.\n\nDo you dare not speak?\n\nGo ahead. Are all matters under Heaven carried out by Heaven’s envoys?\n\nIs it only the Heavenly Master and this foolish disciple?\n\nAh! You grow ever more foolish. Do you not know that all things under Heaven serve as Heaven’s envoys, each with its own office, together completing the Dao? If even one thing were lacking, the Dao of Heaven would be incomplete. How could you not understand this? How profound is this obscurity!\n\nThis ignorant one has not yet fully grasped it. With the Heavenly Master’s explanation, it becomes clear.\n\nGo, you have been sufficiently instructed.\n\nGo, and strive with all your might. Every person has their office and serves as Heaven’s instrument—how could one dare to act alone by natural inclination?\n\nI dare not, I dare not.\n\nGo now.\"",

      "translated_text": "**The Chart of Emptiness, Non-Action, and Spontaneity—Admonitions Fully Realized, One Hundred Sixty-Eight**\n\n**On Emptiness**\nEmptiness is inwardly replete yet outwardly void—being as though non-being. Reverse the womb and embryo to dwell with the Dao. Preserve the heart alone, suspending the dragon’s thoughts. Thus becomes the chamber of spirit, gathering the Dao in emptiness. Roam only with qi, hence \"emptiness.\" In qi and spirit, all else is cast away. With the heart as master, one attains freedom from deviation. Examine its meaning closely; do not forget the true scripture. Attain this, and you cross over—able to wander long. Why not hasten to refinement, only to dwell among fools? Once misfortune arrives, great disaster befalls. Forsake true simplicity, and you return to dust and ash. The wise, upon seeing this text, take heed and hold it true.\n\n**On Non-Action**\nNon-action is action without contrivance. It connects with the Dao, emerging before infancy, entering the seamless. Reaching the Great Beginning, it returns again. At the inception of Heaven and Earth, the source of yin and yang—enter the art of non-action, and the body may be preserved whole. To abandon root for branch is the Dao’s affliction. Depart from the Great Beginning, and preservation becomes difficult. Drift far from life, and you approach death’s gate. Indulging in worldly affairs harms the hun and shen. Clinging to duality while forgetting unity severs their mutual resonance. Can one not take warning? This is the origin of the Dao. You, who guard the One—this is the wellspring of benevolence and wisdom. The Dao of Heaven acts through the One, thus remains complete. The Dao of Earth acts through the Two, and draws near to ghosts and spirits. Truly know non-action, and you align with the Dao’s most numinous aspect. Reflect deeply upon this, and the Perfected Ones take precedence. Seal your golden gate; let nothing depart its threshold. Silent and soundless, spirit is prolonged. When spirit and qi are complete, the gate of immortality opens. How effortless is the Great Dao—no longer troubled! The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet turns toward the benevolent and wise.\n\n**On Spontaneity**\nThe law of spontaneity connects with the Dao. Hold to it, and fortune follows; lose it, and calamity arises. Consider how the myriad things arise whole—one root, ten thousand branches, yet none possess spirit. Ponder its meaning, and the Dao reveals itself. All trace back to the primordial chaos, emerging from the wondrous gate. Neither increase nor diminish—guard spontaneity. All living things possess spirit, but of the eighteen hundred breaths, man is supreme. Thus may one avoid death and attain long-lasting transcendence. Those who perish early lose spontaneity—even beasts endure, how much more so man? Fools despise the Dao, sinking low to join the earth. The benevolent and wise esteem the Dao, ascending swiftly to Heaven’s gate. The spirit-way does not die; the ghost-way meets its end. Should you desire this, it is like a ring without end. Beware of deviance—it brings harm to the self. Neither abandon it recklessly, lest it cause death. The nature of Heaven and Earth uniquely honors spontaneity. Each follows its course; none dare oppose it. The Dao flourishes through non-action, emptiness, and spontaneity. Superior persons delight in it; inferior persons resent it. Study diligently under a master; do not speak idly. With a master, the Dao is clear; without one, transmission is difficult. Learning without a master’s instruction, the noble person remains silent. Acting recklessly brings chaos; inscribing the body invites misfortune. When the Dao is fully realized, spontaneity is achieved.\n\n**Admonitions on the Dao Fully Realized**\n\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Three—end\n*Tai Ping Department*\n*Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Four",

When the full number of days is reached, open the door and enter to inspect it. If the mark was made within, do not enter to view it. If the mark was not made within, then those who delight in it may enter to view it. When opening the door to enter, those who wish to leave may do so freely.\n\nFor the three Daoist scriptures in circulation, obtain the formula through collective deliberation, treating it as Heaven’s trust, and thereby establishing it for those above. For the true spirits and numina, obtain the formula through the unanimous clarity of ten thousand people, treating it as Heaven’s trust. For any text requiring correction, obtain the formula through verification and collation, treating it as Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor those who wish to know the trustworthiness of our Daoist texts, obtain the formula by swiftly enacting them, for they resonate with Heaven’s response. The good shall daily increase, and the evil shall daily diminish—this is Heaven’s trust. For those who wish to appoint and employ good persons, obtain the formula through nine individuals.\n\nTo inquire whether one has entered the chamber and succeeded or not, obtain the formula through complete clarity and understanding—form without concealment or obstruction is Heaven’s trust. To know whether one has attained the Dao in the body and become deathless, obtain the formula through the body’s transformation into spirit, thereby transcending the world—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor those who wish to thoroughly understand the meaning of our texts, read them from beginning to end, and all shall become self-evident. The heart shall be greatly enlightened, and doubt shall no longer remain. Once its meaning is grasped, it cannot be abandoned.\n\nTo test the authenticity of our texts, observe whether they bring about the governance of the world toward Great Peace—this is Heaven’s trust. To know whether longevity can be attained or not, obtain the formula from the era after Great Peace. If Great Peace has not yet arrived, the disasters of former generations shall harm the people, making it difficult to fulfill one’s destiny—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\nFor the sun to know Great Peace, obtain the formula from the severing of metal. For water and fire to suppress and eliminate treacherous ministers, if no formula is available, obtain it from the severing of metal, the decline of the market, and the offering of wine.\n\nFor those who wish to see the great flourishing of the Dao’s laws, obtain the formula through the verification and collation of all texts, and the oaths of ordinary people. For those who seek efficacious medicine, obtain the formula through the verification and collation of all medical texts, and test them.\n\nFor those who wish to swiftly attain Great Peace, obtain the formula by fully revealing the true texts and utterly eliminating the false and deceptive ones. For those who wish to cherish people and no longer kill or harm women, obtain the formula by allowing each to dwell in their place, providing for their clothing and food according to their ability, and preventing them from returning to the sorrow and suffering of their parents, thereby averting rebellion.\n\nTo eliminate illness and widely propagate the Dao, obtain the formula through the cinnabar script and the swallowing of characters. To know the formula for collecting and practicing the scriptures, follow their words and repeatedly exhort, strictly adhering to them. Practicing them for a single day shall dispel the harm of a hundred cunning hearts, and in one morning, all shall turn upright—this is Heaven’s trust.\n\n**Discourse on Auspicious Omens: One Hundred Seventy-Four**\n\nSomeone asked: What is the meaning of the term \"auspicious omen\"?\nWhy do you feign ignorance?\nI do not dare feign ignorance; I truly do not understand. I hope the Heavenly Master will not abandon me and will instruct me with a single word.\nProceed, sit calmly.\nAn auspicious omen is purity, tranquility, uprightness, correctness, focus, and unity. The heart aligns with Heaven and Earth, without violating the seasons’ commands.\nMay I ask how one knows it is pure, tranquil, upright, correct, focused, and unified?\nExcellent is your question. The nature of Heaven and Earth, from ancient times to the present, ensures that the good attain goodness, the evil attain evil, the upright attain uprightness, and the perverse attain perversity. This is the spontaneous method—there is nothing strange about it. Thus, when a person’s heart is upright, pure, tranquil, and utterly sincere, it moves Heaven, harboring no evil intent, and auspicious omens and good things shall manifest for them.\n\nWould you like further confirmation of this great trust? The great sages and worthies of antiquity all cultivated pure, tranquil, focused, and unified hearts, and thus were able to bring forth auspicious omens. Those who are treacherous and deceptive in their hearts shall receive no good responses. This is the great and luminous proof of Heaven and Earth.\nDo you understand?\nYes, I do.\nAre there also corresponding responses?\nIndeed, the perverse attain perversity—this too is their response. The disharmonious attain disharmony, and the harmonious attain harmony. This is the clear and evident response of Heaven.\nExcellent, excellent! Now this foolish student understands.",

      "translated_text": "**Scroll on Storing Away the Writings on Disasters and Illnesses, Secret Teachings, One Hundred Seventy-Six**\n\nMay I ask: Master of Heaven, how can one know when your writings should be put into practice, and how can one know when they should be concealed?\n\nDo you wish to understand this?\n\nObserve the signs of disasters and illnesses. When they emerge and afflict people, Heaven desires that the writings be stored away. When they retreat and afflict people, Heaven desires that the writings be brought forth and enacted.\n\nHow can this be further clarified?\n\nBy the movement of Heaven’s qi through the four seasons, which gives life and nurtures the myriad things, all follows Heaven’s will. If all things delight in emerging yet are forced into concealment, it is greatly inauspicious. If all things wish to retreat and hide yet are compelled to emerge, this too is greatly inauspicious. Both violate the mandate of Heaven, and great disasters will follow.\n\nDo you wish to delight in knowing Heaven’s ways? Whether Heaven delights in action or stillness is determined by these omens.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThus, from ancient times to the present, whenever affairs are undertaken without thorough consideration, Heaven’s Dao is lost, and the burden of inheritance arises. This leads the people into lawlessness, disrupting Heaven’s correct Dao. Governance becomes disordered, and the people and the myriad things suffer unjustly.\n\nMay I ask: Lawlessness is a crime punishable by the most severe penalties—why does the Master of Heaven not establish heavy punishments and capital laws, meting out justice according to each offense?\n\nIn the present age, matters are judged according to their offenses to maintain balance. Why, then, does the Master of Heaven not punish lawlessness as it deserves?\n\nIt cannot be done.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause the ancients committed only minor errors in their practice of the Dao, which do not warrant punishment. Later generations inherit and accumulate these faults, turning them into transgressions. Though their actions may be empty and perverse, even to the point of death, later generations learn from their predecessors. Though they stray from Heaven’s Dao and govern through lawlessness, this is passed down from teacher to teacher, each instructing the next. It is not the fault of a single person, so they cannot be subjected to heavy penalties.\n\nConsider the sins of those in later ages—they are grave enough to warrant death. Yet the divine sages, in establishing laws, cannot suddenly impose heavy punishments and extinguish the generations of humankind. Therefore, Heaven sent me down to reform their conduct, remove their burdens, and without exposing their faults, allow Heaven, Earth, and humanity to govern together, causing spirits to afflict them with illness and disaster. Later generations will see this as the manifest efficacy of the teachings I received from Heaven.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nThe discourse complete, Heaven’s words ceased, and the transmission was entrusted to the Virtuous Lord.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nProceed, and ask no more.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**The above contains all the secret teachings on auspicious omens, recorded below.**\n\n*This concludes the one hundred eighth scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.\n*This begins the one hundred ninth scroll of the* Classic of Great Peace.",

In Heaven, this is called \"the governance of great disorder\"; in the six directions and eight distant regions, it is called \"widowers and childless heirs,\" and the sun daily wanes in brightness.\n\nNothing can be accomplished because these Two Hands do not unite their strength.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed!\n\nMay I ask why this is rightfully named the \"Two Hands\" in Heaven?\n\nExcellent is your question, for you have grasped its meaning.\n\nThe \"Two Hands\" signify their equal and united strength, with no advancing and no retreating, so that later affairs may be accomplished. If the Two Hands do not unite their strength, affairs cannot be accomplished.\n\nThus, all affairs should model themselves upon these Two Hands, each finding its proper person. When strength is united and hearts are of one mind, like these Two Hands, then the qi of good fortune, safety, and great peace will swiftly arrive.\n\nThose who do not model themselves upon these Two Hands will, for billions upon billions of years, be unable to bring forth the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign.\n\nThe qi of Supreme Peace constantly desires to emerge, just as Heaven constantly desires to act through these Two Hands. If they are not long harmonized and guided, they will remain blocked and unable to circulate, emerging to govern with frustration and resentment—what blame is there? The fault lies in these Two Hands not being harmonized.\n\nIf the Two Hands are balanced and harmonized, then the qi of the Supreme Peace of the Highest Sovereign will emerge, arriving one after another without delay.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed!\n\nThus, if Heaven and Earth do not unite their strength, the myriad things and all affairs will have no way to emerge.\nIf the Four Seasons do not unite their strength, all things will have no way to grow.\nIf the Five Phases do not unite their strength, all things will have no way to be completed.\nIf ruler and minister do not unite their strength, all affairs will have no way to be governed.\nIf husband and wife do not unite their strength, descendants will have no way to flourish, and the family way will have no way to be established.\nIf master and disciple do not unite their strength, no knotted affairs will find resolution, the Dao-virtue will have no way to flourish, the dense fog will have no way to clear, and the great transformation of the six directions and eight distant regions will have no way to spread.\n\nThus, all must unite their strength, likening themselves to the Two Hands, so that all may be communicated. Without likening themselves to the Two Hands, misfortune will daily arise.\n\nEven if one seeks to remedy this, it will be of no benefit, and there will still be no way to achieve success. Only prolonged sorrow and suffering will follow, with misfortune growing day by day.\n\nTherefore, in modeling upon these Two Hands, selection and appointment must find the proper person. Those who do not find the proper person are, in the eyes of the gods of Heaven, \"half-dead.\" If one does not hold to both hands and act alone, how can there be any success or accomplishment of affairs?\n\nPerfected One, you have come from afar to inquire on behalf of Heaven. For all matters of doubt, you should deeply ponder this meaning with a sincere heart. The heart is born of fire, and it should return to be entrusted to fire, governing and modeling the people. Then, you will prolong your years and increase your lifespan, with not a single loss. I do not deceive you.\n\nConvey this to the virtuous ruler, convey it to the common people. Let the worthy each ponder its meaning, and let none dare to transgress it.\n\nTo employ this is called \"enriching and nurturing oneself\"; to not employ it is called \"bringing sorrow and suffering upon oneself.\"\n\nWondrous indeed is my Dao, for it is purely the will of Heaven. One may only advance and not retreat, only comply and not oppose. Compliance purely attains the heart of Heaven; opposition brings disorder. When disorder and calamity surge, human intent goes west while Heaven’s intent goes east—this is called \"being at odds with the will of Heaven.\"\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed! Go forth, for you may be said to have awakened to this knowledge.\n\n**The Four Auspicious and Four Inauspicious Decisions, One Hundred Seventy-Eight**\n\nPerfected One, when common people today recommend scholars to present to the emperor and entrust to the state, if they obtain the proper person, this is the first great inauspicious matter.\n\nIf the person is evil, then their learning is abandoned, defiling the legacy of former teachers and sages, and bringing misfortune upon their master—this is the second great inauspicious matter.\n\nMoreover, if those who recommend them are untrustworthy, jointly deceiving their superiors, presenting an improper person, disrupting the celestial order, and defiling the constellations, Heaven will detest them, Earth will resent them, the lord of the state will despise them, and sages and worthies will condemn them—such a one is a flattering, deceitful child of the age.\n\nFor this offense, if they are not punished by Heaven, Earth, and the spirits, then people will surely harm them, disgracing their ancestors and bringing misfortune upon their wives, children, and descendants—this is the fourth great inauspicious matter.\n\nTo commit these four great inauspicious acts by presenting an improper person causes the emperor to suffer and grieve, and governance to become chaotic.\n\nOnce harmful qi stirs and arises, it cannot be stopped. Affairs before and after fall into disorder, with mutual blame and burden. Heaven and Earth grow furious, the host of spirits engage in battle, the six directions are displeased, the eight distant regions fall into discord, and for all time, there is no governance. In Heaven, this is called \"the tally of diminished years and shortened lifespan.\"\n\nWhy is this called \"the tally of shortened lifespan\"?\n\nWhen governance should be long, it is instead made short; when years should be many, they are instead made few. In all undertakings, one encounters misfortune, bringing no benefit to oneself. Heaven and Earth are displeased, deducting from one’s allotted years. Thus, in Heaven, this is called \"the tally of shortened lifespan.\"\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed! Foolish student, I have heard your command.",

Guard this celestial text well, and present it to the virtuous lord, to all worthy ones, and to the worthy among the common folk.\n\nWhen one in high position seeks officers, one must examine them with care; when one in low position recommends officers, one must do so with loyalty. Let later generations transmit and recite this text, binding it within their hearts. If they hastily appoint officers without following this, Heaven and Earth will no longer be pleased. To know this and yet act contrary—how grave the transgression! Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\n“Yes, yes. I sincerely receive your instruction and dare not violate the prohibitions. I shall practice it with all my strength.”\n\nYou may be said to be prudent in affairs, having received the Mandate of Heaven.\n\n[Here ends] *The Celestial and Terrestrial Hand-Tally for Recommending Officers: Four Auspicious Signs, Four Inauspicious Signs, the Tally of Shortened Lifespan, the Tally of Extended Life, the Tally for Pacifying the State, and the Prophecy of Gaining the Hearts of Heaven and Earth and the Host of Spirits.*\n\n[*The following section is missing a large portion of text.* See the collated edition.]\n\n**The Book of Great Merit for Extending Years: Admonitions on Time, from the One Hundred Tenth Scroll of the Scripture of Great Peace**\n\nThe Way of highest antiquity was to cultivate the self and rectify one’s conduct, never daring to transgress what the numinous spirits record. Only then did one dare seek life and petition for survival from the Celestial Lord, never daring to act wantonly, fearing one’s wholeness would not be preserved. Daily, one contemplated the vitality of life, serving the spirits as a subject and manifesting one’s kind. One desired to offer words of utmost loyalty and uprightness, and to the spirits governing each domain, one clearly distinguished right from wrong, only then daring to trust in the governance of fairness. How could one forget this even for a moment?\n\nAbove, there are those who observe humanity, fully discerning right from wrong. What can be concealed? What can be disbelieved? Thus, one attains self-governance, seeking to contemplate the root of all things, never entering even the slightest realm of ungoodness. One merely cherishes being human, relying upon and revering the primordial qi, so that even the creeping and moving creatures do not witness calamities and anomalies. Yet humans betray trust in their sworn words, and mutual disbelief arises, leading to unrest.\n\nWithin Heaven and Earth, the harmony of above and below each maintains its own trust. Humans do not comprehend its essentials, yet ask why there is good and evil alone. From whence do all calamities and anomalies arise? Humans ingest the qi of the Five Constants, receiving and relying upon it in all things, moving through all things. Why then do they alone fail to honor and understand it? From ancient times, have there been those who knew how to extend goodness to others?\n\nThis is to lose goodness and follow evil, causing one’s life to be incomplete. How can this be right? Thus, the Celestial Lord declares that there is good and there is evil, and goodness can be made uniform. The reason for this is that there must be distinction. One cannot follow one’s own inclinations: goodness should ascend, and evil should be punished. How can evil be allowed to reach goodness?\n\nFrom human perspective, this too is understandable, for there are those who ought to be upright. Thus, evil is established to clarify the intentions of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, so that one may know that completing life and engendering existence are of utmost importance, thereby extending one’s years of life. Having received the Dao of life and completion, one upholds its prohibitions and dares not transgress its taboos.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Heaven knows the foolishness of humans is profound, yet harbors no intent for retribution. To oppose what Heaven enacts, to contradict what Heaven ordains, and to impose upon others what one enacts—this is to invert the proper order, rewarding evil and punishing goodness. Thus, the sage understands the convergence of yin and yang, the worthy one governs fairness and rectitude, resolving what is unknown, so that each knows their allotted portion and does not resent others. Goodness naturally extends life, and evil naturally shortens it. What is there to doubt or resent?\n\nAre humans truly inferior to the six domestic animals, birds that fly, beasts that run, and creatures of the water? Is it that humans are without form, and Heaven makes it so? Heaven desires only that humans do good and does not wish them to do evil. If good and evil were to share the same suffering and joy, then wealth, honor, longevity, and old age—all that Heaven enacts above—would be unable to distinguish beauty from ugliness, allowing ignorant people to boast, saying, “I am equal to you all.” What need is there for practicing goodness? Thus, goodness is advanced and extended, prolonging life. Those of shallow understanding consider it equal.\n\nThose who compare themselves to evildoers who lose their lives and then wish to correct their errors, follow goodness, and turn away from evil—day and night, they examine and reflect upon themselves, repaying what they have owed. Though they may not ascend as immortals or transcend the world, they may complete their allotted years without dying prematurely. This is sufficient.\n\nThe advantage of ordinary people lies only in the fleeting moment. Not contemplating long life, they may yet rise to become those who understand, possessing the heart that seeks life, and thus refrain from evil. Heaven sees their goodness and allows them to act with ease, further seeking wealth and descendants. Though they may not attain all, they still have hope. Why then persist in evil, inviting long destruction, believing they may complete their years? They do not know that Heaven dispatches spirits to record their deeds—no transgression, great or small, escapes Heaven’s knowledge.\n\nThe registers of good and evil are examined and tallied by the year, month, and day. From past to present, years are deducted, and if evil does not cease, one is brought before the Ghost Gate. The Earth Spirit summons and interrogates them, comparing their words and deeds. If they remain unrepentant, they are tormented by the suffering ghosts until they submit. Their names are then sent to the Celestial Bureau for final reckoning. When their tally is exhausted, they are to enter the earth, and their transgressions will flow into future lives. Is this not the result of evil?\n\nWhy do humans not desire life? Having no mirror to see themselves, whom can they blame? Among children born in the same month, why does one alone persist in evil without cease? How can they hope for longevity? The calculations of the foolish scholar—why do they not align even with small goodness?\n\nThey pursue trivial and non-urgent matters along the Way, each person’s actions differing in their schemes. They believe their own way is right, yet in all they touch and transgress, they seek only their own benefit, while others do not wish to benefit them. The benefit of goodness brings fleeting life; the benefit of evil does not endure. With goodness, one does not long remain upon the earth.\n\nDoes Heaven and Earth not know this? Heaven causes humans to do good, thus giving them life, yet they turn to evil. Thus, the ghost that presides over evil follows them relentlessly. If they do not cease, other ghosts ascend, each generating their own affairs, so that the ghosts follow the person without respite.",

      "translated_text": "Do you not understand? This scripture first advances goodness and retreats evil—such is the literature of past and present. Yet if one does not follow the path to long life and instead pursues evil, there is nothing to be done; the ghosts cannot be exonerated. Thus, those who transgress vanish into the earth. Their spirit is not at peace, and they know not where to rest—whose fault is this?\n\nLet each person reflect deeply upon their conduct, seeking ease and tranquility without wrongdoing. Their words and phrases may repeat, their teachings may not be singular, hence the repetition. Your life lies close within yourself—why then do you strike your breast and cry out to Heaven? If you do not purify yourself, whom should you purify? If you do not cherish yourself, whom should you cherish? If you do not perfect yourself, whom should you perfect? If you do not reflect upon yourself, upon whom should you reflect? If you do not reproach yourself, whom should you reproach?\n\nPonder these words, and you will bear no grudge against ghosts and spirits. When they witness goodness, they affirm goodness; when they witness evil, they affirm evil—all is not the same. Do you understand this? If words cease briefly but evil does not, the written records will not end; only when the person perishes will they stop. This warning makes clear that evil is self-inflicted, not imposed upon others—do you understand?\n\nAct in accordance with these words, and let them never leave your heart; to depart from them is to invite ruin. If you cannot be redeemed, you will share the company of ghosts—how then can you live? To contemplate life is to attain life—this is wisdom. Evil will inevitably come to an end and cannot endure—do you not understand this?\n\nYet again, some engage in trivial matters. All who dwell between Heaven and Earth are granted the gift of being human—how can they forget the grace of Heaven and Earth? What manner of folly is this? If they cannot change, what hope remains? If they desire Heaven’s reward, they must reproach themselves, weeping with sincerity as they act. They say, *\"I have received the grace to be human, set apart from all things. Heaven has bestowed upon me distinction—speech, discernment of beauty and ugliness, knowledge of good and evil. How can I not attend to these matters?\"* Yet their words defy Heaven, and their disobedience marks them as the most rebellious and unprincipled of people. How can Heaven long abide such conduct?\n\nThus, malevolent spirits are dispatched. The ancient observations return, echoing the words spoken: the person does not incline toward goodness. The Heavenly Lord declares, *\"The records have not ceased. The department overseer shall descend to seize their soul, their bones and flesh entrusted to the earthly lord. There is no need for delay.\"* The wicked cannot be repeatedly admonished, so they bring ruin upon themselves through their own wrath. They return to refinement, transforming their evil, gathering all virtues and internalizing them, placing the heart within the heart.\n\nThe spirits say, *\"We receive the heart’s decree from Heaven, charged to follow the human heart without the slightest deviation. Good and evil are immediately witnessed by attendant spirits, who also perceive the heart.\"* The spirits grow ever more sorrowful, uncertain of fortune or misfortune, and thus they fear being counted among the ranks of the wicked. Day and night, they reflect, unsure where to place themselves, and so they dare not entertain even the slightest unvirtuous thought. They rely solely on the forbearance of the gods, allowing them to reproach themselves. If they disregard divine admonitions, they will be punished without resentment.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord sends a great spirit to declare: *\"This person has reproached themselves and repented of their transgressions, no longer violating the prohibitions. Grant them forbearance, grant them forbearance. If they later commit wrongdoing, it will not be too late to seize them.\"* The spirits, seeing their words and ceaseless sighs, fear that their transgressions may not yet be fully expunged. Long cut off from the qi of the Great Yang, they remain among the ranks of the dead, growing ever more afflicted, uncertain of what to do. Though they have received the decree to exhort, they have not yet attained understanding. In quietude, they examine themselves, reproaching the faults they bear and offering thanks to Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the Five Phases, and all the spirits of their departments.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord listens, commanding them to reflect deeply. The people of antiquity possessed wisdom and foresight, never daring to violate the prohibitions. They cultivated and corrected themselves, fearing any lapse, for even the slightest misstep would be seen as defiance of the mandate, forfeiting their years. For this reason, they dared not relax even slightly. Every transgression incurred punishment, and thus they constantly examined and cherished themselves, revering the prohibitions and never daring to harbor wayward thoughts. When reproached, their hearts trembled with fear, their qi dismayed. They bore the burden of Heaven’s heart, for even the slightest discrepancy would bring verbose records and immediate investigation to verify the truth.\n\nTheir words and trustworthiness could earn them renown, yet if they lacked integrity, their years would soon be lost. Thus, they reflected unceasingly, never losing sight of their own hearts, ever fearful and anxious, never daring to rest. They acted with restraint, always longing and yearning, desiring to align with Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the Five Phases, bearing the mandate together without the slightest error or deviation. Their hearts chastised themselves, ever mindful of the profound intent before and behind them, never straying from constancy. They cherished grace and never violated sincerity, desiring life and hoping to live—how could even the smallest evil reach the ears above?\n\nThey bound their bodies and conducted themselves in accordance with duty, never daring to slacken, fearing they could not fulfill the highest intent. They knew not what to do, their hearts ever more anxious, finding no solace in self-comfort. The gift of Heaven’s longevity is difficult to obtain; once lost, it cannot be regained. Having long distanced themselves from the vulgar, to be suddenly cut down midway—how could they not look below in dismay? Thus, they admonished themselves with trembling reverence.\n\nEver fearful that even the slightest discrepancy might lead to their dismissal, sorrow and melancholy filled their hearts as they reproached themselves for their faults. Having received Heaven’s grace, they sought to fulfill their former mandate, never forgetting the pangs of hunger and thirst, content merely to live. The great spirits, moved by compassion, recorded and instructed the common people, who received qi from the Heavenly Kitchen and rode upon the qi of Heaven. Yet their conduct was meager, their duties many, and they could not afford the slightest lapse.\n\nThough their bodies were humble and unworthy of honor, they were not despised for their unworthiness. Truly, with their hearts, they sought advancement and the pursuit of life. They entreated the great spirits to review their words, allowing them to witness the generative and transformative power of the four seasons and Five Phases, and to see the difficulty of repaying the sun and moon. They feared being cast aside midway. The upright and diligent dared not distance themselves, prostrating themselves in devotion.\n\nThe great spirits declared: *\"This person has followed the teachings of their master to such an extent—why should they fear lacking protection?\"*",

If they do not cease, other ghosts ascend, each generating their own affairs, so that the ghosts follow the person without respite.",

      "translated_text": "In times past, there was such a person whom Heaven, in its mercy, kept close at hand. Now, having served long in office and grown rich in knowledge and foresight, all that they knew of antiquity was profound. Whatever they spoke found favor in the heart of the Heavenly Lord.\n\nThus, they prostrated themselves, weeping upon the earth, and spoke: *\"Awakened by your decree, I recall the loyal and sincere hearts of those who came before. All that I have learned and known, I hold within and heed—how dare I compare myself to those of former times?\"*\n\nThe great spirits replied: *\"We speak to one of trustworthy word, that you may emulate and compare your conduct to theirs. Yet some fall short in their time.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"Great spirits, you have made all things clear and distinct. Among the many, I alone am singled out for favor, granted insight and reflection—this grace is most profound. When shall I ever repay the great spirits?\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Reflection arises from within; it is the fervent thought that repays.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I know not how to offer my devotion. Though Heaven bestows rare and wondrous treasures, I think only of presenting them in return. Moved by your decree, I stir my resolve and contemplate with fervor. This is true acceptance, not mere words of empty courtesy. Day and night, I ponder without ceasing, never daring to slacken.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"The admonitions are many, and the remonstrances come not from one alone. That we speak to you at such length is out of deep regard for your sincerity. Your words reveal profound favor and exceptional mercy.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, hearing this, summoned the great spirits and asked: *\"From whence did this disciple arise, to merit such extraordinary words from the great spirits?\"*\n\nThe great spirits replied: *\"This learner is especially trustworthy, and thus we speak of the difficulty and ease of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"To see the good and advance it, bringing one to such a state—this is as it should be.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"The Heavenly Lord’s inquiry confirms this trustworthy disciple.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I dare not hope to stand at the left side of Heaven. I wish only to remain in a place without office, exerting myself in loyalty.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All must have a domain to govern, that their trustworthiness may be seen in reason.\"*\n\nThus, by such sincerity, they were deemed fortunate indeed, attaining great distinction. They dared not fall short in even the smallest measure.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple, transformed thus, should advance further and may yet equal the ancients.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"I dare not seek long life—it is what others covet.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This is Heaven’s wish.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"It is only by the great spirits’ protection that I dare not transgress their warnings.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, knowing of these two who admonished and instructed one another, approved deeply and commanded them to teach each other.\n\nThe Way of the sages of highest antiquity arose naturally. Their hearts knew the governance of Heaven above, and all they enacted was foreknown. Their voices resonated clearly, and they understood forms and appearances, perceiving the heart’s brightness and the mind’s enlightenment. They knew what must be saved, the convergence of fortune and misfortune, all clearly discerned. Within their hearts, they rejoiced, knowing they had received Heaven’s blessing. They saw the affairs of those who came before, all cautioned with earnest clarity.\n\nReflecting on the grace of their favor and encounter, having long accompanied the six spirits and received their teachings and warnings, they were kept from peril. Gazing upon the four directions, above and below all was open and unobstructed, their sorrow deepening. Yet their hearts rejoiced, drawing near to their appointed time, attaining even what they had not heard—all through the transformative power of Heaven’s great spirits.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All the spirits know this: those who advance have their destiny. The records are true, and before their birth, their years, months, days, and hours are inscribed in the Bureau of Longevity. Their years increase, and their names are made known, governed by the Perfected One of the North Pole. Their bones are transformed, their bodies become light and lustrous, radiating brilliance. At the appointed time, they receive the elixir, refining their essence. Wherever they go, their transformations are unfailing. They move from the subtle to the hidden, traversing the space of a single hair—what is there they cannot penetrate?\"*\n\nThe sage said: *\"Truly, those who follow the common ways, who eat what the earth provides, whose yin spirits emerge—how can they not be esteemed? The ease of transformation is itself the highest ease.\"*\n\nThe great spirits’ grace cannot be repaid; their merit is vast, their favor profound. The thought of such great kindness is unbearable. Even in moments of respite, their depth is beyond words to repay.\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Heaven endows human life and destiny in equal measure. This is not by the will of the great spirits. To see the good and recommend them is the blessing of the spirits—what repayment is needed? Yet, fearing future doubts, we impose strict prohibitions, that the sages may instruct and later generations may understand. The sages know of themselves; no decrees are needed.\"*\n\nThe sage said: *\"Though I have received such favor and my name is recorded, there may yet be teachings I fail to grasp.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple’s words are fittingly humble—this is as it should be.\"*\n\nThe disciple, offering repeated thanks, expressed all that was needed. *\"Only by the great spirits’ grace is my resolve fulfilled. Though I am but one among many, I dare not grow complacent or arrogant. I ask to exert myself further in quiet seclusion, heeding the great spirits’ teachings and mindful of my inadequacies.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"All that has been said, before and after, is clear. There is nothing more to admonish.\"*\n\nThey parted, each reflecting on the other’s words.\n\nThe disciple said: *\"From the day I received the precepts, I have not dared to slacken even for a moment. Yet I fear I may not see them through to the end. Only by your support may I live and hope again. My heart is ever inclined toward you. May the great spirits, from time to time, remember and instruct me—this grace is no small thing.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This disciple’s words are fitting indeed.\"*\n\nThe disciple said: *\"Indeed, indeed. I dare not rely on myself for defense.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Those who attain renown benefit from diligent progress, and their domains are not few.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, hearing the exchange between the great spirits and the sage, deemed them persons of understanding and commanded that they not grow negligent. Their destinies would reach boundless longevity. Each returned to their domain, and when they saw the good, they advanced them to the great spirits.\n\nThe sage said: *\"Having all received the Heavenly Lord’s teaching, we will strive with all our might, never growing weary in our efforts.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Lord said: *\"Those who become perfected do so by their own efforts.\"*\n*\"Indeed, indeed.\"*\n\nOnly the Dao-attaining persons of highest antiquity, even before the establishment of laws and registers, were recorded in the *Scriptures of Longevity*. When the time of the stars’ conjunction arrives, their names are transmitted to the Central Ultimate. The Central Ultimate is also called Kunlun. The domain overseers must go and record the names of these persons without omission. They are repeatedly sent to activate their limbs and joints, bending and extending, turning and inclining, instructing and admonishing them. The spirits follow their flexing and bowing, administering medicinal draughts to open and refine their bones and joints. Though they may not meet often, they know whether one is steadfast or not, for their resolve does not waver.\n\nThose who covet life and abhor decay aspire to join the gods of heaven. The spirits are frequently dispatched to verify their years and accomplishments, and only then are they permitted to receive the *Scriptures of Insufficiency*. Their spoken words and utterances are made known so they may understand the prohibitions and defenses to be observed. These teachings are transmitted to learners, who must not disregard the divine texts. If one claims to have brought their own books to completion, the spirits will recognize their words in conversation. After accumulating one thousand three hundred and twenty days, they are led to meet the great spirits, to circulate primordial *qi*, and to practice spontaneity.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord reviewed the secret decrees and commanded that all investigations be conducted without private trust or biased intent, lest the heart be swayed and the mind altered, leading to errors in conduct. The great spirits said: *\"We have calculated the provisions lent by all the spirits. On the last day of the eighth month each year, the registers of all mountains, seas, mounds, marshes, connecting rivers, bridges, the Huai, Ji, Yangtze, and lakes—recording all that enters and exits—must be clearly divided.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord’s rewards and labor records are signed before him and repeatedly verified, then stored in the Golden Chamber. Those with sincere hearts are appointed to answer the Heavenly Lord’s inquiries. They must heed his teachings day and night without negligence. The chamber attendants must not lose track of their assigned domains. Separate records are kept to identify those with sincere hearts, and their names are duly registered.\n\nThe spirit envoys are tasked with tallying the names of all who ascend or descend. One hundred days in advance, all documents must be submitted without omission or error. If any document is inconsistent or the accounting officials fail to act, they will be held jointly liable. Prior decrees forbid violating the words of the divine texts. Three years and eight months after the release of this text, it may be shown to the common people. Those who possess the *Scriptures of Daoist Faith* may be shown it in full.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructed: *\"This person bears prior burdens. Command the spirits to resolve and conceal them. Those not yet concealed must be concealed.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This person has long suffered poverty and emptiness, fearing they cannot preserve themselves. Having gained the Heavenly Lord’s trust, the spirits are ordered to conceal their records. If their overseer has not yet concealed them, they may not fulfill their words as promised.\"*\n\nPreviously, they had petitioned for decrees, offered thanks, and received grace. Though the appointed time has not yet arrived, all concerned are to be notified one month in advance. The Heavenly Lord said: *\"Among the spirits, generals, soldiers, and people in the fields and lands below, none must miss the time for concealment. Record their names so that the earth spirits may revere and guard them. Let the divine powers come and go, and those who seek to fulfill their wishes may do so in good faith. Thereafter, they must be cautious.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Thus, all within the seas will hear and know. Those who love the Dao will support and uphold one another, serving and revering it.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"Those who have merit shall naturally be revered.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"This person’s years are not yet complete, and their allotted time has not arrived. We request that when the time comes, they be taught how to repay their gratitude. For now, their dwelling remains empty, and they have nothing to clothe themselves. Let those who possess the Dao provide them with sustenance until the appointed time.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"This is a small matter. Let the celestial offices provide for their households—those with households and sincere hearts.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"We request that it be done as instructed. Command the celestial officials to provide what is due. This person has long been empty; let them be given enough to eat.\"*\n\nThe great spirits said: *\"Order the celestial officials to record their names and ensure they do not suffer want.\"*\n\nThe Heavenly Lord said: *\"Well said.\"*\n\nOnly the people of highest antiquity all received the responses of heaven. Those with faith could succeed, and upon receiving their mandate, they were protected and watched over by the spirits, who feared any deficiency. Day and night, they divined their fate. Seeing them do good, they assisted and rejoiced; they did not wish to hear of their wrongdoing. They were placed in the offices of longevity, their hearts set on goodness, never turning to evil. They were encouraged to advance in virtue, fostering filial piety, loyalty, and obedience.\n\nThose who received and practiced the teachings dared not act on their own will but followed the instructions. Others might call them ignorant, but the spirits saw and knew them. When someone showed great kindness or compassion, they rejoiced in their own strength. Yet if others remained suspicious after long acquaintance, they detested such mistrust above all, fearing it would lead to their own ruin. They restrained and disciplined themselves, dreading offense against evil persons, living in constant trepidation, uncertain of what to do.\n\nHeaven endows people with knowledge of good and evil. Those who practice goodness with faith—heaven does not wish to hear of their wrongdoing. Thus, they covet life and abhor death, daring not to violate prohibitions, lest they harm themselves. Therefore, by aligning with the *qi* of heaven, they engage in discourse with those who commune with the Dao. Their words flow freely, understanding human sentiments. Seeing another’s misdeeds, they withdraw and reproach themselves, fearing that their names might be sullied in the records.\n\nIf one’s intent at the time is to bestow favor upon another, one must not dare to confront them directly with intricate reasoning but instead reflect on one’s own conduct. Failing to please others, one’s transgressions multiply and are difficult to erase. Thus, when people come to regret their actions, their circumstances shift, and their sharpness wanes, believing their fate can be regained. Yet heaven sends the great spirits to divine their fortunes, and the omens are dire. They enter the earth prematurely, and so they console themselves, enduring in silence, daring not to incur further wrong.\n\nEven slight deviations in their words or intentions, having received heaven’s grace, are granted a brief respite to revive and sustain the hope of long life—this is heaven’s dispensation. Thus, they gain a share of intent, though their lives may not endure long. For this reason, they grow ever more despondent, their hearts filled with shame and remorse.\n\nThey long to meet the heavenly spirits, to seek compassion, instruction, and admonition, to illuminate what they do not know, and to prepare for what is to come. If their hearts align with heaven’s will, they may attain a small measure of their desires. Those who covet advancement and deliberation ponder good and evil alike, striving to avoid the decrees they cannot see.",

Consider carefully, for thoughts arise from the heart and should be pondered thoroughly.\n\nThe seeker replied: \"Overwhelmed with gratitude and fear for what I have received, how dare I not speak from the heart?\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Such resolve is commendable. Return now to a quiet place and reflect. Seek only where you find insufficiency.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am slow of understanding and lacking in wisdom, yet to fully grasp the manifest precepts. I prostrate myself, awaiting your instruction, before daring to advance further.\"\n\nThe great spirit replied: \"If you devote yourself with utmost sincerity, merit may yet be attained. Strive and reflect upon your life thus far—your progress in merit, the resolution of your ancestors’ burdens, and the lifting of those burdens. When transgressions are exhausted, you shall ascend. What doubt remains? Be cautious in your words and guard against wayward thoughts.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"Having received your decree and admonition, I dare not withhold effort in pursuing goodness. Yet if I alternate between good and evil, I toy with my own fate.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Even the virtuous should humble themselves. Though their days of toil may bring momentary hardship, if they persist without wavering, blessings shall follow.\"\n\nThe seeker, having received the decree, withdrew to a secluded place, reflecting on their faults and reproaching themselves.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Thoughts that arise from within are known to the heavenly spirits. Do not grow weary.\"\n\nThe seeker persisted until the end of their years.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"With such conduct, why fear failure to advance? The Heavenly Lord, having heard of this, further charged the great spirit to observe those who seek progress, recording their deeds over months and years, assigning each to their proper rank. Those with merit shall ascend, their names filling vacancies.\n\nIn ancient times, the hearts, words, and speech of people were attuned to human nature, governing without artifice. Their inner and outer selves were in harmony, and none betrayed their trust. Heaven’s essential decrees, when violated, brought swift disgrace, and transgressors were promptly questioned and held accountable for their faults. Thus, they trembled all the more.\n\nMoved by the boundless grace of heaven, which allows them to remain whole as humans and discern right from wrong, they ponder how to repay such profound kindness. Though their hearts yearn to advance with loyalty and sincerity, and though they strive in word and deed to uphold every command without the slightest deviation—fearing that even minor lapses might be reported to the spirits above, cutting short their allotted years—they grow ever more sorrowful and anxious, unable to find solace, yet hoping to repay heaven’s benevolence.\n\nTruly, they covet life and, together with the heavenly spirits, align with heaven’s will. For those with goodness, even minor transgressions are absolved, allowing them to fulfill their years. Those with great merit may have their lives extended and their years increased. Serving the primordial *qi*, uniting essence and radiance, they perceive all that is known and receive profound grace—beyond words to repay, their hearts alone left uncertain.\n\nOnly the great spirits, in their compassion, record and examine, offering instruction to enlighten their understanding. They come to know heaven’s many decrees and prohibitions, which must be upheld without fail.\n\nThe great spirits, ever mindful of their insufficiencies, admonish them not to forget their duty, nor the grace that sustains their lives.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"You are one who understands. What further instruction is needed? Simply follow heaven’s will and do not oppose it. Upon receiving admonitions, act upon them at once without omission. This is how one aligns with heaven’s intent. Rewards and punishments vary in weight—each must be met with sincerity, without error. Even minor precepts should be heeded. Consider your words carefully, ensuring they are practicable. Should small falsehoods arise, reflect inwardly and turn toward goodness—this is a minor precept. All else in life’s conduct should be deeply guarded, lest you fail the spirits’ intent.\n\nFrom childhood, you have not yet grasped the greater duty. Thus, the great spirits repeatedly admonish you. Their insight is vast, their wisdom boundless, encompassing all things. The great spirits urge you to embrace their virtue and not oppose their words. Reflect deeply and await further admonition.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"These words reveal heaven’s dispensations, the knowledge of earthly conduct, and the ways of all things in between. The laws correspond without discrepancy. Those who instruct you follow their masters—simply do not oppose them.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am resolved to uphold the precepts. Though the laws are uniform, my understanding of their intent remains shallow. Heaven’s will is difficult to fathom.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"All this is true and without deceit. Those who foresee the Heavenly Lord’s intentions are foremost among people, worthy to stand at his left side. For their merit, they receive rewards, yet they remain humble, refusing to accept all, and strive ever harder, their minds refined and their efforts great. Thus, the Heavenly Lord personally charges and instructs them—this is your fortune. With many under your care, govern with an impartial heart. This is sufficient.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I dare not aspire to stand at the Heavenly Lord’s left side. To live is enough. I think only of loyalty and filial piety, fulfilling my duties according to principle. I dare not accept great rewards, fearing I lack merit. Yet when even small deeds bear fruit, my life grows brighter, and I see my days prolonged. My thoughts are boundless, never ceasing to reflect on my faults, even for a moment. To receive your gentle words fills my heart to overflowing. The great spirit dwells with me, guiding without need for thought. Truly, I have received grace—moving between heaven and earth, occasionally admonished—this is the great spirit’s benevolence, beyond repayment. My heart’s longing remains ever present, never wavering.\"",

For this reason, they grow ever more despondent, their hearts filled with shame and remorse.\n\nThey long to meet the heavenly spirits, to seek compassion, instruction, and admonition, to illuminate what they do not know, and to prepare for what is to come. If their hearts align with heaven’s will, they may attain a small measure of their desires. Those who covet advancement and deliberation ponder good and evil alike, striving to avoid the decrees they cannot see.",

      "translated_text": "The Heavenly Lord, having heard this, knew that the conduct of such a learned person never fails to fulfill their aspirations. Those who constantly examine their own faults and harbor no ill intentions—when the great spirits admonish and instruct them—ascend without weariness. The most virtuous of people are born of nature itself, each with their own destined record, inscribed in the register of goodness, named the *Record of the Virtuous*. They consistently embody virtuous conduct, never bearing an evil reputation. In all their movements, whether going or coming, only good intentions are heard, never evil—thus they are called *the virtuous*. Their every action advances them among others; the multitude marvels at what they cannot see, and they attain the highest reverence. Those in high station observe them, some admiring their words, some coveting their virtuous deeds, some their sincerity, some their beloved presence, some their filial loyalty, some their long-standing counsel, or their trustworthiness—such is the excellence of the virtuous. Thus they are named *virtuous*. At times, they receive favor and glory, yet still desire to wander long, to attain the state of spirit immortals, to reach the rank of deathlessness, or to command the host of spirits—these are the desires of the virtuous. Their conduct, revering goodness, aligns with the trust of heaven and earth, the four seasons, and the five phases; the spirits cherish them, the wise instruct one another, rare texts and extraordinary strategies are shared, and vacancies are filled through mutual recommendation and assurance. Even minor disagreements are corrected through admonition, and precious treasures are exchanged. Together, they ascend to the heavenly spirits, seeking reverence, correction, and reflection on their faults, fearing they may not measure up to the great spirits of heaven. Day and night, their hearts advance with steadfast devotion; they embrace goodness from within, yearn to hear virtuous words, and hold fast to loyalty and integrity. They cherish their lives and years, ever fearful of even a moment’s lapse into slight unvirtuousness. When they hear of others’ faults, they aid in their repentance. They guide those with understanding, heed good counsel, adopt others’ words, and witness their glory. They teach others to seek the Dao of life and the path to survival—this is the utmost of the virtuous. Yet they dare not defy the wishes of the spirits, their longing ever present, and they attain what others aspire to. Only the great spirits of heaven, mastering all discourse, inspect and command their conduct, enforcing prohibitions. Even minor lapses are met with forbearance, allowing them to reflect on their intentions. Heaven’s grace is vast, its compassion boundless, enabling self-reflection, repentance, and prolonged life—this is the great dispensation of fate. Yet they fear failing to fully repay this grace, and only the great spirits pardon their shortcomings. They wish to receive unseen admonitions, to dwell in joyful reflection, their aspirations broad and far-reaching, ever mindful of repeated instructions.\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Heaven and earth each have their own patterns. To know how to advance but not how to retreat—this is natural. They do not withhold admonition or instruction out of reluctance. When they see the virtuous, what doubt remains? What further correction is needed? Simply ponder their words carefully, and act accordingly. This is the aspiration of the virtuous, and it is fitting to make it clear.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"I am unworthy, my conduct impure. Thus I have personally received the great spirits’ prohibitions and admonitions. Repeatedly, I have been shown great favor, my thoughts ever remembered, and my presence openly acknowledged. Yet I return again, insatiable—heaven has made it so.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"You have received your nature from the Dao; heaven sent you to inquire, knowing your alignment—or lack thereof. What cause for suspicion is there? Those who secretly wish to receive instructions speak only from their true feelings, with few embellished words. Few are those who correct themselves from the heart, hence vacancies are filled through mutual supplementation. Your shortcomings are evident; you must remain vigilant and not grow lax.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"My nature is slow and dull. Though I strive not to err, I rely on written precepts for restraint. I can only lament my inadequacy.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"This too arises from understanding. Knowing goodness, one acts with goodness; knowing trust, one acts with trust; knowing loyalty, one acts with loyalty; knowing obedience, one acts with obedience; knowing filial piety, one acts with filial piety. How could evil ever gain ground? You understand this yourself—thus I emphasize it further.\"\n\nThe seeker, deeply moved, said: \"What I have heard is the greatest goodness. Within it lies profound admonition. The great spirits’ teachings are thus—how dare I harbor any thought of negligence? This is the intent that sustains my life. To receive such favor, I know not how to repay the great spirits’ grace.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"These matters are observed, yet they need not serve as admonition. Reflect on what can be practiced, and your name will surely be established. Ascend without doubt; your conduct will naturally attain it. What need is there for repayment or gratitude? Your words are already virtuous—there is nothing more to be said.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"These admonitions prolong my life, giving me hope for survival. I will ponder your words in my ignorance.\"\n\nThe great spirit said: \"Know that your words must not depart from your heart. Those who come to learn have always been admonished thus, before and after.\"\n\nThe seeker said: \"Who would willingly instruct me so?\"\n\nThe seeker’s fate and life delighted the great spirits. They summarized all prior instructions, yet he felt he could never match such grace, ashamed and at a loss.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord, having heard this, said: \"This is the excellence of the excellent, the finest among the virtuous. It may be applied across all departments without fail.\"\n\nThe great spirit relayed to the seeker: \"The Heavenly Lord’s command is thus gracious. You must not transgress it.\" The seeker assented.\n\nThose of supreme virtue dwell between heaven and earth, accomplishing the work of transformation, each fulfilling their aspirations. The virtuous are inscribed in the *Record of Goodness*, never deviating from constancy or propriety—this is supreme virtue. Nothing remains unaccomplished, nothing unachieved. They do not lose their clarity or their truth, nor do they fail in the generation of yin and yang, the ingress and egress of the life-giving qi of the four seasons, the completion of the five phases, the courses of the sun, moon, and stars, their measured cycles, the timing of fortune and misfortune, the signs of calamity and anomaly, the records of flood and drought, or the length of human life—never losing the essence of their allotted fate as determined by the stars. This is the conduct befitting those of supreme virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: the person of virtue illuminates all without exception, perceives all without obstruction—above, below, and at the center, each attaining its proper harmony. In accordance with their virtue, none lose their rightful name. This is the scripture of constancy and long life, from which none fail to receive glory.\n\nAll things sprout forth, breaking through their husks to grow; they droop their branches and spread their leaves, serving as garments. Mist, dew, frost, snow, and timely rain serve as drink and food. They grow and mature, their foliage and fruit providing cover, sustaining the earth’s bounty—known as the \"water mother,\" called by the people \"melon.\" In the scorching heat of high summer, it serves as water and broth, relied upon by all under heaven, consumed by young and old alike. Such is the virtuous person, who bears the mandate of heaven, completing heaven’s form upon the earth to provide sustenance for the people. Bestowing kindness and spreading bounty, none are left untouched by their virtue, thus filling themselves to abundance—this is the grace of heaven.\n\nYet it is not so. Heaven’s bestowal of life is vast, and to defy its decree by claiming all is \"natural\" is to invite deafening rebuke. Therefore, the virtuous person, understanding heaven’s intent, instructs the people in the proper way, never straying from heaven’s will, nurturing growth and maturity so that they may become fully human. Those who further comprehend the patterns of scripture, whose conduct perfects virtue, may ascend to the ranks of the celestial scholars.\n\nIn the affairs of heaven, merits are graded by distinction. The virtuous person presides over the affairs of earth, enabling the people to depend upon and witness anew the grace bestowed. Yet they cannot repay it in full measure. When the virtuous act as heaven’s agents in circulating qi—above, below, and at the center—those who fail to receive their due turn and belittle heaven’s works. This is precisely what provokes heaven’s unceasing wrath, causing the spirits to withhold their love for humanity, encroaching upon lifespans. Yet people blame heaven instead of themselves—how profound their folly!\n\nThus, the divine scriptures are sent down, establishing commands and prohibitions to firmly restrain the people from transgression. Those who foresee coming events, shun evil and pursue good, and do not violate the prohibitions will further witness the transformations wrought by heaven’s teachings, none failing to follow them. Therefore, the ruler is made their ally, guiding head and tail, completing their works like the walls of a city, clear and discernible for all to know.\n\nThey understand the great transformations above and regulate the primordial qi, while also comprehending human affairs. These are people of fortune and destiny, all foreknown. As they transform in accord with others, their allotted time may be extended, and heaven cherishes them. Benevolent spirits follow and protect them, shielding them from harm. Their hearts incline toward goodness, and the wicked cannot compare. Thus, heaven values goodness, allowing them to fulfill their aspirations, neither encroaching nor overpowering, but maintaining equilibrium. Those of exceptional ability who surpass in goodness have their lifespans further increased by heaven, spared from peril and entanglement in wrongdoing—this is great grace indeed.\n\nHow can one hesitate to repay it? Those who have performed great good, whose conduct aligns with heaven’s will, draw near to its left side, where no malign qi approaches. They dare not look upon it, and their lives extend without end—such grace is beyond repayment. Yet repayment need not be in rare treasures. Simply inscribing one’s heart in sincerity, being true and steadfast in word and deed, never betraying one’s promises—this is true repayment, the repayment of understanding. Do you comprehend?\n\nTo know goodness and act accordingly, to see trustworthiness and embody it—this is the excellence of humanity. One should reflect upon this and harbor no doubt. Those who were trustworthy in the past have attained boundless longevity, transforming into divine spirits, their capacities fully realized through merit. Do you understand this as well?\n\nThus, the virtuous person, a scholar of understanding, advances upward, cherished by heaven. Without their writings, they know their fate and do not resent heaven. Each conducts themselves with care, avoiding wrongdoing and perversity. Teaching others to do good, they align with heaven’s will, and their lives naturally lengthen. All affairs proceed from the Heavenly Lord, with no room for delay.\n\nThe common people are difficult to transform; they must be guided gradually, without haste or violence. Weigh your words carefully, lest they be recorded by the spirits. Each must attend to their own duties, for the scriptures and ledgers have their own measures and limits—do not overstep them. When you see goodness, advance it; when you see evil, correct it. Harbor no doubt.\n\nThose who cherish life never forget heaven’s works. Thus, they are held in esteem, for they truly value human life. To contemplate goodness is to attain goodness, and longevity is assured. Does the Heavenly Lord cherish trustworthiness and understanding? Reflect carefully upon the divine scriptures, and do not test them of your own accord.\n\nOf all matters under heaven, filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trustworthiness are paramount. Thus, one must not indulge in recklessness, nor seize the lifespans of others, for such actions cannot endure. Be cautious, be ever cautious, and do not grow lax. Laxity breeds doubt, and doubt renders one unworthy. Do you understand? Do you understand?\n\n**Right:** *Celestial Writ of the Six Poles, Great Compendium of Heavenly Scriptures, Collated in the Eighth Heavenly Month in Accordance with the Laws of Heaven and Earth to Dispel Disasters.*\n**End of** *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Ten\n**Beginning of** *Tai Ping Jing*, Scroll One Hundred Eleven",

      "translated_text": "**The Great Sage’s Petition Formula, One Hundred Eighty**\n\nOnly those of supreme sagely virtue may receive the primordial qi and naturally respond to its radiant essence, thereby becoming great sages. They fully comprehend what ought to be enacted, aligning invariably with the celestial will without straying from the intent of the primordial qi. They ever act as grand divine ministers, akin to dukes and ministers in a kingdom. Their minds grasp the directives of the great spirits, their petitions and memorials flowing in accord with celestial writ. Each petition duly recommends the worthy, ensuring that those who speak are preserved, their words heeded by the Celestial Lord. When the Hall of Luminous Clarity receives the writ, it is promptly transmitted below without delay, and the grace of the celestial court is bestowed.\n\nThe Celestial Lord declares: Those who do not discuss the court’s decrees, entrusting them to others, and whose memorials are all balanced and just, shall know no grievance or dispute. Each receives their due portion of grace, with rewards and punishments meted out accordingly. How could there be contention over such distinctions?\n\nThe great sage foresees the affairs the Celestial Lord must enact—how could there be error? The common folk, unaware, liken this to a local magistrate—how could they comprehend the edicts and writs that ought to descend? In the celestial realm, voices carry afar, and nothing remains concealed. This is governed by the natural order of mutual verification—how could there be a moment of escape?\n\nThe Celestial Lord, day and night, foreknows all matters—great and small, hidden and subtle—within the harmony of heaven, earth, and the center. How could the myriad spirits act with impunity? Thus, the records of good and evil at the beginning and end are entrusted to the spirits for transcription. The Celestial Lord personally follows the monthly cyclical governance of the Dipper’s handle, ensuring no deviation from the constant intent. All is rectified, and none dare transgress.\n\nThus it is said: The celestial mind-spirit dwells within the human abdomen, gazing afar to heaven, voices carrying between them. How could the good and evil of the people remain unknown? The Celestial Lord promotes the good and trustworthy, demoting the evil and untrustworthy. Not only in heaven is this so, but also in the harmony of earth below.\n\nPeople, failing to deeply understand future affairs, cultivate enduring resolve in their hearts, walking the same path as the great spirits—this is what heaven draws near. It is like a kingdom with loyal ministers and upright officials, never far from the ruler’s side. Yet people do not trust heaven—when would heaven ever trust those of two minds? Are those who do not serve heaven not inferior even to the common folk?\n\nEven insects and ants—by what cause or condition do they gain the favor of heaven’s intent? Those who covetously cling to life yet fail to draw near in due time—calamity arises among the people, and the thirteen [lunar mansions] are gathered in the end, each with its allotted years. When the resolute, unmindful of worldly affairs, covet advancement and seek life, the spirits reveal their hearts.\n\nThose of steadfast resolve may be engaged in discourse and entrusted with matters; those without resolve cannot. They consider only the mouths to feed, seeking profit, desiring warm clothes and full meals, with礼 and expense trailing behind. They drive the poor and weak, exalting themselves as lofty and wise—these are not the heart and mind of heaven. Their conduct lacks purity, yet they still seek the Dao and long life. This is precisely what cannot be obtained. Their transgressions are grave and weighty, with little hope of pardon.\n\nDo you understand? Those who ascend in broad daylight, seeking life, have their names inscribed in the celestial register, recorded in the inner ledger of the Northern Culmen Celestial Lord, with copies of their allotted span. How could those without resolve have their names recorded? Those who forcefully study the Dao and gain heaven’s heart and mind may fulfill their celestial years.\n\nThose who exert themselves with exceptional thought and effort, achieving merit, may have their names transferred from the register of death, gaining a lesser life. When shall they ride the refined qi and act as heaven’s agents?\n\nThus, one may know: When the writ moves the heart, tears flow in self-reproach, saying, “I, like the child of the tenth month, have acted, yet alone fail to meet the celestial intent, remaining among the ranks of the dead. What single act of mine has failed to please above? It is my own fault.”\n\nHeaven, earth, and the harmony between them all ought to follow the grace of heaven, yet many do not believe—this is a grievous transgression. What can they hope for? The celestial spirits, hearing this, say, “This person reproaches and repents, sparing no day or night, accumulating years of merit. They may be pardoned.” They report this to the Celestial Lord.\n\nThe Celestial Lord declares: “Those who reproach and repent of their transgressions shall have the spirit of life’s register transfer them to the Bureau of Longevity. The hundred and twenty spirits shall grant them continued generations, providing descendants to the poor and reducing the progeny of the short-lived among the wealthy and noble.”\n\nWhy is this? The wealthy and noble, with descendants, grow powerful and self-sufficient, unafraid of heaven and earth. They lightly harm others, extinguishing lives, amassing wealth to obstruct, killing and injuring without number. Thus, heaven does not grant them descendants. If their evil does not cease, how could they be granted goodness and longevity?\n\nDo you understand? The great spirits dispatch lesser spirits to transmit decrees, each receiving their mandate—matters of long and short span proceed without doubt. Reflect again upon the written words, knowing that even small thoughts afterward may have omissions or errors—these must be recorded.\n\n**The Virtuous Person’s Register of Fortune and Destiny, One Hundred Eighty-One**\n\nOnly those of supreme virtue possess their own principles, deeply understanding affairs yet to come, illuminating above and below, with nothing left unopened. Their thoughts never depart from within, exhausting all they know to uphold the great transformation, rightly ordering all under heaven. What they ought to transmit is never amiss.\n\nTheir sincerity reaches the four directions, their intent ever in communication. They rectify the fundamental principles, establishing the stellar lodges in their proper places, arrayed in the four quarters. Each arrangement has its pattern, each action its constancy, their destinies linked above and below, each with its short or long span.\n\nOn the day of life’s inception, the overseer awaits in the chamber, recording and inscribing the register—nothing may be forgotten. Those born in the *zi* and *wu* [hours or years] have long destinies. Those born in the *chou* and *wei* [years] do not lose their earthly abode. If their lives are brief and meager, they ought not to commit evil, lest they be consigned to the earthly abode.\n\nIf their allotted span is not yet exhausted, their names remain recorded in the ledger. Though they encounter prosperous phases and monthly cyclical qi, their lives shall not be prolonged.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is that those born in the earthly abodes—where the domains of *Kun* and *Gen* lie—have their lifespans naturally diminished. Born on days aligned with the seasons, the three earthly phases gaze upon one another. Yet if one is born on such a day without advancement, their worth becomes as mere coin of their own making. From year to year, they seldom encounter favorable times.\n\nIn the years of *chen* and *xu*, where Heaven’s Gate meets Earth’s Door, and where the celestial and terrestrial soils converge, all things take their origin. The celestial soil gives rise to the grasses and trees above, the terrestrial soil to those below; the celestial soil produces sages and wise ones, while the earthly soil bears the virtuous. Though there be balances and ranks, they do not interfere with one another. Yet people, unaware of this, instead declare that years in *chen* and *xu* bring destructive clashes in the monthly cyclical *qi*, deeming them most inauspicious. Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Door stand in opposition, yin and yang gaze upon each other, and birthdays align with their proper stations. When the day of *wu* once more aligns with the year’s birth, such a one is a person of great virtue, unobstructed in all things—rightly should they feel no fear. The earthly soil yields the virtuous, and the treasury of soil is their dwelling. What evil could there be? Yet people, not understanding, take soil as mere substance, all belonging to the earthly treasury.\n\nLifespans have their appointed terms: those aligned with sages become sages, those aligned with the virtuous become virtuous—this is the eternal law of Heaven, and their allotted destiny follows accordingly. Some may even attain transcendence. In the years of *yin* and *shen*, such persons resemble tigers. The sun and moon align, yet they cannot be compared. The reason lies in *yin* being the domain of literary refinement, the abode of wood, where mountain forests and fierce beasts cannot be withstood. They ought only to maintain purity and cleanliness, for Heaven sends them to hunt—but they should not be seen too often, for many fear them, and thus they are called tigers. Those born in the year of *yin* have long destinies, and if three *yin* years converge in their birth, they may endure for a great span. *Shen*, however, stands in opposition, never to be lost, yet they fear the night and can only climb trees up and down, beset by many terrors. Their destiny lies in metal, and their actions harm and wound others. Thus their lifespans are short—this is readily known. If they neglect the spirits or grow remiss, if they indulge in perverse and oppressive fears without constancy, they will seldom encounter favorable times.\n\nIn the destinies of *mao* and *you*, each aligns with its respective month, and their months coincide. *Mao* governs the East, striking the Eastern Star in its charge, fostering abundant livelihoods and the sustenance of the people. Thus *mao* is called the East, and the true *mao* stands at the East’s center. In spring, it brings flourishing blossoms; in summer, it ripens fruit—nothing it does not bestow, none it does not bless with virtue. Therefore, the Eastern Star is named *Ren* (Benevolence), for it cannot bear to harm. Heaven cherishes human lifespans, and thus grants them long years. Yet the true *you* lies in the domain of metal, delighting in strife and battle, and cannot endure long. To act wickedly is natural—how could one hope for long life? Even if they encounter the prosperous phases of the monthly cyclical *qi*, their fate remains unchanged. Of six or seven evils, half their days are lost—this, too, is readily known.\n\nFor those born in the years of *si* and *hai*, each is assigned its month, and their names are likewise given. With double yin and no yang, their lifespans are naturally short. When the three yin phases converge, it is said that *si* and *hai* govern the opening and storing away. *Hai* rules the Northwest, *si* the Southeast—whatever they face or undertake, little aligns with propriety. Their livelihoods are difficult to advance, and their lifespans hard to prolong. Thus it is said that the ten celestial stems circulate in mutual correspondence, their names denoting merit, and their reckoning subject to Heaven’s calculations. By measuring their short and long spans, destiny is determined—how could one follow their own will in Heaven’s workings? Therefore, those of great virtue now oversee these patterns, their names recorded in the registers of the stellar lodges, their destinies held in the celestial bureaus. Within and without, above and below, in all eight directions, all follow these principles—how could one act as they please?\n\nPeople, not grasping these calculations, instead ask what debt they owe to Heaven. By doing good, one may fulfill their allotted years; by doing evil, they forfeit length for brevity. If wickedness is not halted, calamity extends even to the unborn—what hope can there be? One reaps what one sows. If their destiny is meager and they do not exhaust their allotted span, their surplus is stored in Heaven to be bestowed upon the virtuous. They ought to warn their descendants to be cautious. If they repent and correct their ways, they may yet complete their years—each outcome is clear. Let them tally their deeds and not resent the celestial spirits.\n\nStrive to do good, and your descendants shall enjoy long years; otherwise, the fault lies with you—blame not Heaven. If one first rectifies themselves but later wavers, they should reflect and restore balance. The noble and benevolent naturally cherish their years, as recorded in the *Life Bureau’s Verdicts*, Scroll One Hundred Eighty-Two.\n\nOnly the Most High’s virtuous ones conduct themselves thus: they foreknow the inner and outer workings of Heaven and Earth, moving in and out of yin and yang, guiding their principles, and awakening to the thoughts within—never forgetting the Dao. They act in accord with Heaven, daring not to doubt, and thus succeed, upholding Heaven’s great bestowals. Their thoughts dwell within, their actions bear no transgressions, subtly receiving the natural order. They repeatedly encounter warnings—past and future are known. If people bring harm upon themselves, they have no one to blame.\n\nSince ancient times, few have been trustworthy. Those who claim trustworthiness seek only to deceive, heedless of the consequences. Thus Heaven and Earth grow dark with unceasing wrath, and even the wise and sagely, though they know, can only regret. Heaven instructs through its own ways, not through human words. Yet people turn away with malice, ignoring admonitions, seeking only their own satisfaction. Such people are more ignorant than beasts. For this reason, they ought to reproach themselves for their faults—from where does their recklessness arise? Day and night, they should reflect on their failings, relentlessly examining their transgressions—what cause have they to resent or blame? Yet they remain unrepentant, heedless of their faults, acting recklessly and inappropriately. They do not heed the great teachings but instead indulge themselves, shortening their own lives—what cause have they to resent or blame?\n\nAt times, they recall the transcendent ones of high antiquity who ascended and escaped the world—how did such thoughts arise? In all the writings they see, it is said: be loyal and filial, honor and serve your parents, live in harmony with your siblings, without inner or outer discord, in unity above and below, knowing Heaven’s prohibitions. Let the spirits govern the principles, openly acknowledging faults without ceasing, cultivating the self and reflecting inward—only then may one attain life. Lifespans have their appointed terms—how can one act as they please? The thought pains the heart, tears soak the garments, and there is no end to the sorrow. They cherish their years, fearing they may not live long. When they see those of long life and inquire of them, they are told: be loyal and filial, never losing the intent of Heaven and Earth; assist the four seasons in their generation, aid the Five Phases in their completion, and dare not destroy the things that ought to live.",

      "translated_text": "Those who do good never encroach upon others, deceive, or betray; they are sincere and trustworthy, never daring to break their word. Their conduct wins the favor of the multitude, and they dare not fail their kin or bring harm to their village, always repaying what they owe in due time. They never lie drunk in the streets in broad daylight. The worthy and wise follow them, paying no heed to fools. They bear gratitude toward Heaven and Earth, never expecting repayment, only reproaching themselves. Yet when faults recur, they trace their origins to inherited burdens, reproaching themselves for years on end until moved to remorse.\n\nWorldly folk commit many transgressions and debts, never finding release. They walk in sorrow and bitterness, not knowing where to turn. Whenever they see others at fault, they turn to blame themselves, unable to find peace. They seek out virtuous texts and precepts, hoping for good fortune, and when they encounter the sacred scriptures of Heaven’s great spirits, they ponder them again and again, their thoughts consumed without end. They bow their heads, strike their breasts, and weep aloud, their bodies unable to correct themselves, yet full of grievance. The weight of the prohibitions presses upon them, and they transgress, shortening their lives. Day and night, they repent.\n\nHoping for even a brief reprieve, they dare not commit further wrongs. Instead, they resolve to practice kindness and bestow alms, striving to grasp the principles. No harsh words pass their lips—only tears, their hearts filled with sorrow. The heavenly spirits hear and descend to ask: “Who is this person, so full of grief?” They observe one of great virtue, whose life is long and enduring. When asked, they say: “This one merely acts in accord with Heaven’s heart and Earth’s intent—thus they attain longevity.”\n\nReturning to their quiet dwelling, they reflect as the virtuous of the Highest Dao have taught, examining themselves. When the spirits see their remorse and repentance, they ascend to report to the Way of Heaven: “There is one who weeps and laments without ceasing, fearing they will not live, and so reproaches themselves.” The great spirits hear and say: “The Heavenly Lord has often commanded the spirits: those who perform good deeds, are loyal and filial, and obedient—such words refer to this person alone.” They then report to the Heavenly Lord, who says: “I have heard that this person has reproached themselves for their faults for many years. Though once a worldly person, their unceasing self-reproach has made them one of the highest good.”\n\nThe great spirits frequently visit to observe their conduct, discerning whether their intentions are virtuous and if they seek advancement. Their destined years are then recorded in the Bureau of Longevity, where their deeds are reviewed to make up for any deficiencies. The great spirits say: “This person has reproached themselves for so long that their inherited burdens are dissolved. We request that their deficiencies be filled, and they be named a virtuous one of the Highest Dao, to repay those below who have fallen short.” The Heavenly Lord says: “The conduct of the virtuous of the Highest Dao must be as you have said.” The great spirits repeatedly command that they be protected and guided to ascend as spirits, ensuring their allotted years are not diminished.\n\nThe great spirits say: “This person was originally without a recorded name, but by decree, they have been placed in the Bureau of Longevity. We request that their deficiencies be filled in order, without skipping ranks.” The Heavenly Lord says: “When the day comes to fill the vacancies in order, their names shall be repeatedly submitted without missing the appointed time.” The great spirits assent.\n\nOnly the benevolent of the Highest Dao accumulate merit and deeds in Heaven. Heaven heeds and trusts them, sending them to assist the Eastern Star in arranging the creatures that ought to live, providing blossoms and fruits to nourish the people, ensuring warmth and fullness. Their bodies grow strong, nurturing one another in turn; yin and yang unite, and male and female take form. Old and young follow in succession, receiving their destined lifespans from Heaven’s decree. Among the twenty-eight constellations, they revolve and complete one another; the sun and moon illuminate and inspect without fail, taking turns to generate life—how could there be rest?\n\nYet people do not understand, believing each to be self-governing. Though names may imply autonomy, they are in fact mutually restrained. The reason is this: human lives have varying lengths, and the seasons of spring, autumn, winter, and summer bring constant cycles of life and death. Thus, they are made to govern one another, transferring and inquiring in turn. Lifespans increase or decrease, passing from one to another. Therefore, it is said that the four seasons, Five Phases, sun, moon, and stars all hold sway over life. The good are granted increase, while the wicked retreat on their own. The severity of transgressions is measured by unchanging laws—how can one escape if the laws are followed as they should be?\n\nHeaven above and Earth below support one another like the outer and inner, with various spirits also working in concert. Thus, it is said that the Heavenly Lord commands the bureaus, each transferring their duties in turn, taking up their respective talismans without the slightest partiality. From above, they observe below—how could there be failure? Those of inherent nature, free from ill intent, may commit minor wrongs but repent of their deeds, and their faults are dissolved. Their records are regularly entered into the registers: the wicked are sent to the lower bureaus, while the good are reported as good, and the wicked as wicked. The spirits of fortune and misfortune each follow where they are assigned. If the wicked repent, their names are transferred to the registers of the good. If the good turn to evil, they are moved to the registers of the wicked—how could there be rest?\n\nAmong the living on Earth, even those still in the womb have their names and destinies recorded in the Register of the Undying. When their years are fulfilled and their conduct complete, those who are born are recorded, and those with guarantors are elevated. The reason is this: their lifespans are difficult to sustain, so their guarantors are held accountable for any transgressions. Thus, those who are neither loyal, filial, obedient, nor meritorious have no guarantors—they merely continue the merits of their ancestors, ensuring sacrifices are made. Yet if they persist in evil without cease, how can they expect to partake in future generations’ sustenance?\n\nHow could those who feed on filth ever hope to serve alongside the great spirits of Heaven for long? Even among the filth, there are those who respond to Heaven’s scriptures and are sent divine teachings. When the appointed time arrives, the Heavenly Lord commands the guardian spirits of the Great Heavenly Granary to sever their attachment to material forms. They are nourished by the qi of the Great Heavenly Granary, their bodies refined and their spirits lightened, moving between the profound and the obscure. Their names are then recorded, no longer in the ledgers—how could they seek life? How could people know of this?\n\nIf one is good and never loses Heaven’s heart, the great spirits stir their mind, making them delight in life, whether they follow the Dao or remain worldly. The reason is this: if one commits evil without a single good deed, merely coveting fine clothes and carriages, following their desires without restraint, their allotted lifespan will not be fulfilled—but Heaven and Earth will not deny their wishes either.",

      "translated_text": "The wicked shall not long behold the sun, moon, and stars of Heaven, but must return to the eternal night—how could they remain? Such persons, unable to discipline themselves toward goodness, are known to Heaven for their enduring evil, and thus are made to consume only the food of form. They are buried beneath the earth, becoming servants to the earth spirits, never to be reborn. This is why the scriptures reveal it, that they may know.\n\nSome undergo *shijie* (corpse liberation), their forms dividing: the bones and body separate. The corpse remains in one place, while the spirit becomes a wandering phantom, appearing to people as though dead. Yet those who understand may see them still alive—these are the *shijie* immortals. Over time, as their years and merits accumulate, they next ascend in broad daylight to Heaven. When their merits and years are complete, their radiance shines forth, aiding the celestial spirits in their all-pervading work. They return to dwell among the clouds, and within their appointed domains, all are *shijie* immortals who govern the affairs of humans and ghosts.\n\nIn the families of the Dao, those who depart may be enfeoffed as the most revered of spirits, known as *Dilingqi* (Earthly Numinous Spirits). They, too, may wear the purple, mugwort-green, and yellow. Their governance extends above and below, with each ascending to their proper station. If one’s evil is heard of, they may be demoted to consort with ghosts—do you not understand? Thus it is said: the paths of life and death diverge; how could they be compared?\n\nProceed, and when minor transgressions arise, still the mind and reflect. For those who later falter or fall short, this shall be explained. Only the actions of the Most High’s good persons manifest the affairs Heaven and Earth must carry out. Each has their charge, each their words, each their cultivation, each their spiritual attainment, each their merit, each their loyalty, each their governance, each their bestowal upon others, each their advancement in the Dao. Each gains the trust of Heaven and Earth, each does not lose the generative and transformative cycles of the four seasons and five phases.\n\nThus, those who respond to the goodness of the Most High are Heaven’s faithful and Earth’s safeguarded. All attain the harmonious heart-mind of Heaven and Earth, understanding the ebb and flow of human affairs, carrying out commands without daring to defy the will of the Great Sages. Below, they do not transgress the prohibitions of the myriad spirits. They constantly strive to perfect others, making them delight in goodness. They align with the hearts of Heaven and Earth, their inner and outer selves in accord, achieving success in their persons and attaining longevity. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers of the undying, and they serve alongside the great spirits in their appointed roles.\n\nThey discern right from wrong, their loyalty and sincerity directed to Heaven. They behold the sun, moon, and stars without losing the measure of the Dao, nor straying from their resolve. Constantly desiring to live, they contemplate serving Heaven’s transformation and understanding Earth’s principles. Their hearts rejoice, for they know the registers of fortune and misfortune, the affairs of survival and demise, and aspire to walk the same path as the natural order. Even slight greed or evil is seen, and the great spirits’ admonitions stir compassion for the unenlightened, illuminating their shortcomings so they may enter the records of long life. They witness the Celestial Lords bestowing life upon them, their names enduring in the ledgers of the undying.\n\nThey perform the affairs of Heaven above and comprehend Earth’s principles below. What they see and hear is vast: their eyes are bright, their ears keen, and they know the boundless past and future. Their writings and words are clear, and they grasp the essential and wondrous. Such is the aspiration of the Most High’s good persons. Only the great celestial spirits perceive and guide their wishes, as they yearn for the natural and inscribe their deeds in harmony with the generative *qi*, without end.\n\nIt is ever said: Heaven does not deny a person’s wishes, nor does Earth deny their peace. Thus, the natural order dares not bear even a hair’s weight of entanglement to trouble the spirits, so deeply do they cherish the written word. Day and night, they reflect on their failings, fearing they may fall short of the Most High Lord’s intent. What do they惜 or love that they would not exhaust their loyalty, sincerity, and filial piety? They must declare the grace they have received, the honor bestowed, without thought of repayment. Heaven’s heart holds them in profound love, yet they reproach themselves for their faults, offering little in forgiveness.\n\nOnly the great spirits may pardon and admonish them, not out of attachment but from compassion. They dare not distance themselves, constantly mindful of the unrepayed grace, their sins clinging to them. Fearful of being unable to explain or absolve, they can only grieve. Though pardoned and shown leniency, they are made to reflect on their failings.\n\nThe great spirits say: The Most High’s good persons reflect on their transgressions and reproach themselves; their words and writings ascend to be heard above. Their words extend far, yet they fear being misunderstood. Heaven’s faithfulness especially honors them, and they may attain boundless longevity. They should set their hearts afar, never forgetting the great gifts bestowed by Heaven’s generative power.\n\nThe Most High Lord praises them, saying: Life arises from the mandate of good life, unconcerned with wealth or sensuality. Seeing others live, they constantly desire to share in their longevity—when would they act recklessly or without heart, failing to repay such profound grace? They only regret that, since their years began, they have not seen the great measure of Heaven’s bounty. Only by receiving the grace of teachings and admonitions do they understand their allotted principles. They say: Knowing fate, they do not resent Heaven, nor dare they resent themselves and hinder life. How could their hearts harbor greed? They only fear their years may end before witnessing Heaven’s great dispensation of its ordered domains.\n\nThe Most High again admonishes the ignorant and benighted, granting them the wisdom to reflect—a great grace beyond words. They must concentrate their hearts and minds, ever mindful within, never forgetting their hunger and thirst, seeking the precepts and the living. Only by receiving pardon and leniency may they proceed.\n\nThe great spirits say: We originally advanced to the Celestial Lords from among the spirits, without the slightest fault, aiding Heaven and Earth with meritorious deeds. Our names are recorded in the Celestial Lords’ ledgers—when could we ever be forgotten? We humbly present our words of self-reproach, for we have long yearned for Heaven’s transformation. Are such persons recorded in the ledgers or not?\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Those who reproach themselves act in accord with the natural order and are aided by the spirits. Let those who oversee the celestial registers examine them. If they have reproached themselves, the spirit in charge of the living ledgers is commanded to review the records, and their names are indeed found therein.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Those who conduct themselves well from birth, transgressing no prohibitions, achieve this through their own actions. The great spirits should further investigate, for there may be omissions in the records of those who have rendered service.\n\nThe great spirits say: Since the Great Beginning, those spirits whose merits have gained Heaven’s favor have advanced—yet there remain some vacancies.",

Let the report be made as stated, and we shall observe their conduct accordingly.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: It shall be as the great spirits have reported.\n\n**Dialogue on the Longing of the Knowing to Meet the Great Spirits, One Hundred Eighty-Third**\n\nOnly those of supreme knowledge, the Knowing Ones of the Most High, foreknow the affairs of Heaven and understand what should be done and what should be upheld. Their actions arise naturally, and when primal qi converges upon them, they attain maturity—all becomes clear and known. They transform their hearts to accord with the natural, residing in what they do. Thus, the Knowing Ones comprehend both inner and outer, and in all their comings and goings, nothing fails to reach fulfillment. Nothing remains unachieved, and all transformations occur in due time. Revering the majesty of the spirits, they perfect their merit and name their virtue. Ever unwavering in loyalty and trust, never remiss, day and night they grieve and tremble, never departing from their inner resolve. Inclining and yearning, they long to achieve union and meet the great spirits. Through discourse and the exchange of words, they practice the Way they follow and advance what they know. Constantly contemplating success, they render grace to the spirits, prolonging life and increasing years. Thus, the Knowing Ones look inward to see outward—what is there they do not know? What is there they do not perceive? Their minds are clear and their thoughts distinct. They but crave the Way of long life, desiring to mount the carriage and serve as envoys for the great spirits. Wherever they arrive, they dare not speak falsely, responding in the moment as if already present, longing for their hearts to open. Receiving the words of the spirits as the spirits themselves do, knowing the spirits’ actions, they act with self-assurance and only then dare to speak, seeking merely to be granted life and audience. They dare not seek high office, only to be shown mercy. Though they witness matters of life and death, their hearts tremble with fear. Having received the great teachings, they must act to communicate them, bestowing grace and spreading kindness, benefiting those above and those below. Their names are inscribed in the ledgers, and they abide in the ranks of the undying. Their hearts rejoice and delight, exhausting their efforts in service to the Celestial Lord. Over the years, their merits accumulate, and they advance in speech.\n\nOnly by the great spirits’ intercession for their insufficiencies, knowing the weight of their words, do they thus crave advancement. Receiving their secret decrees, they roam the gates and chambers, daring not rest, desiring instruction and admonition to remedy their shortcomings. They wish to be examined and not contradict what is said, awaiting the commands and warnings of the great spirits’ words.\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High perceive much, yet they cannot fully know the bounds of Heaven’s domains—what then should they be cautioned against? The spirits of Heaven all observe them. The words of the Knowing Ones of the Most High are but to know what is spoken, what is taught, and what is practiced—what cause for doubt is there?\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: Constantly command the spirits to advance the names of those who are loyal, filial, sincere, trustworthy, and meritorious. These Knowing Ones of the Most High, coveted by their allotted destinies, thus clarify their hearts.\n\nYet they fear that their written words are but their own speech—why would they withhold reverence for Heaven’s teachings and admonitions? They often say they suffer from having no scribe to respond, fearing that inner and outer may not correspond. If they wish to advance their knowledge and understanding, broadening inquiry and deepening comprehension, this too is what they should know.\n\nProceed, and heed the words of the great spirits. Heaven’s heavy admonitions must not be treated lightly, must not be disrespected, must not be held in awe too little—only then is it possible. The admonitions are many; one must grasp their essentials and further open one’s ears, eyes, and heart.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nThus, emerging from within, the great admonitions of Heaven decree that all who seek advancement and long life must advance what they know. To know and not speak is to listen in vain—this is to lack the heart for self-advancement. Those whose hearts hold knowledge must contemplate advancement. Those with aspirations must advance their aspirations. Those with sincerity must advance their sincerity. Those with filial piety must advance their filial piety. Only thus do they become the heart and core of Heaven—nothing must be left unadvanced.\n\nThe Celestial Lord foreknows human sentiments and permits no failure to advance or to expound the Way. To conceal knowledge and hide abilities—Heaven detests such persons, ensuring they do not appear in the ledgers of longevity. Is this not to know?\n\nNot only do they not appear in the ledgers of longevity, but their essence is first lost, departing from their bodies, and their years perish. Can they not be cautious?\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High act thus because the Celestial Lord knows what is known and what is not. They know themselves—what doubt remains? They need only carefully ponder the spirits’ words and not betray them.\n\nThe Knowing Ones of the Most High, though lowly and ignorant, press forward with questions beyond their reach, desiring to be granted what they do not know. How dare they conceal knowledge or hide abilities, causing the Celestial Lord and the spirits to hear of it and further forfeit their lives and lose their years, shortening their longevity? This is the root of calamity and misfortune, and even the destruction of their bodies would not suffice to repay it. How dare they advance thus?\n\nOnly may the great spirits illuminate and pardon their inadequacies.\n\nThe great spirits say: Those who seek life and abhor death naturally possess hearts and aspirations that cannot be otherwise. Yet they fear there may be times of confusion.",

      "translated_text": "The one seeking life says: \"I myself know not the precepts, yet by the great spirits’ gracious forbearance, I am taught thus. How dare I grow complacent and not advance what I know and what I can say? May only the great spirits record what has come before and not dismiss it.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"What has come before is not easily matched. Only those who preserve trust and faith can align with the Celestial Lord’s will and thus hope for life. Take heed of this.\"\n\nThe seeker, truly coveting life, therefore exhausts his loyalty and sincerity, never daring to slacken or rest. He reflects on his faults and reproaches himself—how dare he waste day or night? The Celestial Lord, having heard his words, says: \"This is the speech of one who possesses knowledge in the Most High.\" It is known that this person’s name appears in the ledgers, though with some deficiencies. The spirits charged with the living registers are commanded to examine the ledgers where this person’s name is recorded. Though his name is listed and he is naturally good and knowledgeable, he must fulfill his years and not lose track of the spirits governing his months and years.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n**Method for Accumulating Conduct to Repair the True Self, Scroll 184**\n\nOnly those of the Most High who possess intention each know their allotted portion. Each has their own Dao, their own conduct, their own offerings, their own advancement, their own declarations, their own words, their own destinations, and their own movements. If the heart is not stirred within, they constantly strive to fulfill loyalty, trust, and filial piety. Truly, they render service to Heaven, accumulating conduct over the years without ever slackening. Yet they do not forget gratitude or their allotted portion, ever mindful of their desire for life. Having received the protection of the host of spirits above, they dare not withhold even the smallest part. They constantly harbor a fearful heart, never at ease, seeking the precepts of the Most High to preserve their lives. How dare they forget the great bestowal of grace?\n\nMay the great spirits deign to glance upon their inadequacies. Their hearts ever long for the affairs of the Most High, and what they ought to practice—compass and square, plumb line and inked cord—naturally earns trust. Gazing toward the four quarters, they comprehend the four corners. What Heaven knows, they manifest before it comes to pass. Their hearts contemplate the great spirits’ memorials and communications, what they advance and what they declare. They dare not evaluate these with their own minds but constantly consult with the assembled spirits to determine what may be adopted or not, ever fearful of failing to win the hearts of the spirits.\n\nThey consider themselves fundamentally upright, without error. As if moved from the depths of their being, they constantly cherish the preservation of life that harms nothing. Previously, they coveted its radiance, reaching upward to the sound without essence or form, penetrating the Most High’s commands to advance. They dare not grow lax and thereby obstruct the great transformation.\n\nMay the spirits examine their desire for life and not depart from the great spirits’ left side. Upon seeing the precepts, their hearts open and their eyes brighten, desiring to abide by the scripture of longevity, to increase their years and lifespan. They strive to advance merit, personally engaging without daring to trust themselves or presume to judge right and wrong, contending over what is insufficient. They yearn for those above to be ever diligent, only beseeching compassionate illumination of the precepts.\n\nWhen will their gratitude and devotion ever cease? Their hearts long day and night to meet, coveting knowledge of prohibitions and transgressions to stir their minds and thereby perceive their own inadequacies. These are not matters to be repaid with mere words; only by receiving examination may their thoughts pierce the heart’s diaphragm.\n\nThe great spirits say: \"This is one of the Most High who possesses intention—his conduct is indeed fitting. Seeking to receive Heaven’s solemn precepts and prohibitions, he who possesses knowledge is fundamentally clear and discerning, distinguishing principle. What precepts does he not understand? Holding the heart to aim at the heart, there is no gap for selfishness. From above to below, all know their own master.\n\nNow, those of the Most High who possess intention are close to Heaven and trusted by the celestial spirits. They need only hold fast to their hearts and minds, ever fearful of losing them. The rest is known to their own hearts. They must strive to transmit, widely inquire, and not lose what is said. Those who possess knowledge are mostly clear in their distinctions, only fearing that at times their actions may not match their words. Why suspect they would not openly explain? Such a person, possessing intention, naturally reflects on his faults and debts.\n\nSimply contemplating what lies before and behind, longevity naturally emerges from within, aligning with the Celestial Lord’s heart. The remainder of the precepts for those who possess intention say: This seeker was originally a rustic, seeing those who lived long and aged gracefully, their vital essence and fluids flowing without loss, never witnessing their decline. Though many study, few attain it. Why? Because they do not hold their hearts with utmost care, lightly regarding what is said. Their strategies and records are not fitting, thus making attainment rare.\n\nNow, this seeker, seeing the conduct of those who came before, further corrects and reforms his bearing, opening his heart to retain it. Desiring to raise his voice, he listens well, coveting longevity and cherishing his years. Thus, he dare not slacken or rest. May only the great spirits examine his inadequacies.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"Those who possess intention shall be granted registration in the ledgers. We request the clerks of the registers to examine the ledgers for this person’s name and report to the Celestial Lord. The great spirits may not act on their own.\"\n\nThe seeker says: \"May only the great spirits consider and discuss this. I dare not distance myself, lingering outside, but will personally prove my worth.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"We request to report the names of those registered in the ledgers. Why suspect they would not correspond?\"\n\nThe seeker says: \"May only the great spirits report on my behalf. On the day of accomplishment, I will devote my life to proving my worth. What need is there to hope for repayment?\"\n\nThe great spirits report to the Celestial Lord: \"Those of the Most High who possess intention all hold their hearts firmly and closely, their aspirations ever coveting the heights and possessing faith. Command the spirits in charge to examine them. If such a person exists, advance and report to the great spirits. Command those in charge to examine whether this person’s name appears in the documents. This person’s name was recorded before his birth.\"\n\nThe great spirits report back: \"This person’s name was recorded before his birth, solely by the grace of the Most High.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"Those recorded in the ledgers shall be seen to ascend. They must take responsibility for their debts and burdens. Command the great spirits to remove the tally of their debts and burdens, to transform their hearts, and to refine them into spirits. When their years are fulfilled, they shall advance.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"This person’s years and calculations are complete, exceeding the term by a hundred days. Previously, there was no certainty, so for now, it is halted.\"",
      "overlap_context": "and the spirits to hear of it and further forfeit their lives and lose their years, shortening their longevity? This is the root of calamity and misfortune, and even the destruction of their bodies would not suffice to repay it. How dare they advance thus?\n\nOnly may the great spirits illuminate and pardon their inadequacies.\n\nThe great spirits say: Those who seek life and abhor death naturally possess hearts and aspirations that cannot be otherwise. Yet they fear there may be times of confusion.",

      "translated_text": "The Celestial Lord says: \"Command the great spirits to ascend for now, assigning them to their posts in the interim. Where there are vacancies for the true, let them be filled by those who can exhaust their essence and devote their will, knowing how to eliminate and act concurrently.\"\n\nThe great spirits say: \"We request to ascend as the Celestial Lord has commanded. Let their refined lifespans and calculations be recalculated. Those who are enlightened shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"This is what those of sincere heart ought to do, that they may have something to govern.\"\n\nThe great spirits assent.\n\nThey request to command the proper officials to carry out the affairs according to the original text.\n\nThe great spirits say: \"Report to the Ascension Bureau.\"\n\nThe petitioners report to the great spirits, saying: \"Request to command the officials of the Bureau.\"\n\nThe officials having reported, they are assigned to interim posts, and where there are vacancies for the true, they are to be filled.\n\nThe Celestial Lord says: \"As reported by the Bureau.\"\n\nTo the right: In heaven above, good deeds are to be concealed, while misfortune and calamity arise from their disclosure.\n\n*End of Scroll One Hundred Eleven of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Scroll One Hundred Twelve of the Scripture of Great Peace*\n*Disaster of Coveting Wealth and Lust, and Admonitions Within the Womb, One Hundred Eighty-Five*\n\nIn ancient times, the formless divine persons sought the Dao of life. They aligned their aspirations with the qi of the Primordial, constantly yearning for the longevity of long life, ever mindful not to lose the intent of the Primordial qi. At dusk they settled their thoughts, at dawn they inquired after its well-being, clinging tenaciously to life, never forgetting. From time to time, they would look about, exhausting the utmost of their loyalty and sincerity, reverently following the wishes of the Primordial qi. Thus, they were enabled to ascend and move with clarity, their radiance illuminating the four directions, perceiving things unseen, and hearing sounds unheard, their comings and goings above and below all governed by principle. The host of spirits and refined qi would come of their own accord, attending to their countenance, fearful of displeasing them or losing their favor. All held reverent hearts, their garments and footwear transforming accordingly. They embraced and bestowed kindness, spreading virtue above and below, their fame flowing to the four directions, the six poles, and beyond the eight extremities, extending even to the ancient sages, each receiving the consequences of their good and evil, their generosity and meanness. Covered by boundless grace, they reverently followed the mandate, moving even the stars and constellations. With limitless resources and limitless virtue, they selected the steadfast and good to shield and conceal themselves. Their wishes fulfilled, their hearts at ease and joyful, they attained lives of immeasurable longevity. Serene and content, with little need for embellishment, they preserved themselves whole, never slackening. Others could not know them, nor could they hear of others—without rank or merit, how could they ascend to stand alongside the Primordial qi? Thus, they cherished, loved, and nurtured themselves, and in their abundant generosity, they bestowed without omission. How could they fail to receive blessings?\n\nYet they reflected: their comings and goings were within the harmony of heaven and earth, their illumination reaching the sun, moon, and stars. They drew clarity from the twenty-eight constellations ahead, carefully observing the cyclical signs governing the people, the patterns of good and ill fortune. But few understood. They considered themselves wise, yet in their actions and movements, they brought no benefit to heaven. Violating prohibitions, they invited calamity, even to the point of annihilating their families, severing their lineages, leaving their ancestors without worship. How could their lives remain whole? What could be done for such people? Failing to follow the ancient texts, they believed themselves free of offense against spirits and gods. Yet the three qi were not in harmony, and their fates varied in depth and shallowness. Unable to deeply contemplate misfortune, the gods of the three qi were sent to admonish them. Those who heeded the admonition prospered; those who did not sealed their own fate, descending below the earth, their misfortune flowing to their descendants. Heaven’s mandate was not obeyed; evil was practiced and good abandoned. How could they endure? What the August Emperor did not wish to see was their hastened demise. Yet people, unaware, blamed the azure heavens. When did heaven ever wrong them? They brought it upon themselves. Utterly lacking in foresight, their lives were like those of dogs and sheep—how could they long endure? Like birds in a net, they entangled themselves in its mesh, their greed consuming their bodies. Their peers followed blindly, heedless of their years. Only the wise emerged into the unharmed lands beyond the four borders—how did they alone escape? It was simply the natural course of their fate. Though dwelling among the unenlightened, their lives remained whole, for such was the decree of the times. Few repaid their blessings. Alas, what could be done? They asked, \"What have we done to wrong heaven?\"\n\nAmong the ancients, not one in ten thousand matched their aspirations. Coveting wealth and lust, they disregarded the perils, bringing disaster even within the womb, never beholding the sun, moon, or stars. What sorrow could compare? They left themselves incomplete, their fates bound to the earth. Wretched were these people, and there were many like them—even plants, trees, birds, and beasts fared no differently. They did not strive to correct themselves or rectify their intentions, uttering reckless and evil words. Above, the spirits recorded their deeds; below, there was no escape. Nothing was hidden from their overseers. Each must exert themselves to seek the admonitions of the divine spirits, the convergence of good and ill fortune—how could there be no reckoning?\n\nThus, the divine persons were commanded to establish prohibitions for the people, enabling them to perceive the taboos of life and death. Those upon whom yang qi bestows favor are recorded in the ledgers of true transcendents; those with transgressions are demoted. Those upon whom yin qi bestows favor are relegated to the ranks of the dead. Reflect deeply and consider carefully, lest you transgress the heavenly principles and the patterns of the earth. Understand human nature, the inner and outer, when to advance and when to retreat. Do not bring blame upon others, that each may extend their years and pass them on to their descendants.\n\nAfter receiving the admonitions, be doubly cautious in speech. Evil committed below is disregarded above. The people of the vulgar world lack filial piety and loyalty, coveting what they desire, seizing and plundering what is not theirs. Their murderous intent never leaves their lips—how could they hope to live? Calamity and blame await them, sooner or later. Reverently follow the celestial patterns, for the divine spirits record all. Keep your distance from such things; do not test them. To test life is to gain life; to test death is to gain death. When death is certain, there is no doubt. Thus, I reiterate and repeat: do not associate with the ignorant, nor utter even slight deviations.\n\nThe Dao of long life lies near, in the three spirits. The three qi combine to form a person; if they fail to combine, they scatter and become earth, no different from tiles and stones, broken and unseen, unable to compare with the whole and complete. The spirits of the three fates reside near the heart. Why cling to or cherish what is flawed? To covet a broken form is to be displayed in the marketplace—when will it ever live again?",

Yet one who can rectify oneself and do good may thereby regain longevity. Sincerity reaches all things, and nature follows its course. Be vigilant within and without, between yin and yang, through the four seasons of growth and completion—do not violate them. Between heaven above and earth below, within the harmony of the center, all have their own masters. For those with understanding, this is the method by which the enlightened act. Those who aspire to life share the same wish as the Dao of Heaven; the wicked perish before their time—can one not be cautious?\n\nThe words of divine beings all receive celestial response; one cannot blame oneself. The term of extended life reaches upward to those who do good, allowing them to fulfill their natural span. The wicked descend into the Yellow Springs. Ponder this, ponder it well—do not recklessly transmit it. Those who are wicked, upon receiving this transmission, will suffer its calamities. Death and life place them in separate realms; none dare speak of it. If one acts wickedly, one must not blame others—there are always those who record such deeds, leaving no room for complaint.\n\nStudy the texts to grasp their meaning. Be reverent and cautious with sacred scriptures. Spirits and spectral agents all have their causes. If a destined household encounters this text, be careful not to harm oneself or deceive the virtuous. Heaven diminishes a person’s lifespan, bringing illness and disease—there is no need to seek help from physicians or tormented shamans. The registers are already set to sever it—what further doubt remains? Reflect deeply, contemplate, and consider—thus may one avoid calamity. Once misfortune strikes, there is no salvation.\n\nThe Perfected One holds this text to enlighten the ignorant, that they may reform and do good. Do not malign the words of the scripture. What has been said before is reiterated here. The reason is this: life and death alter destiny. Without speaking of its prohibitions, there is no way to preserve it. The natural order is self-evident—one must only know what is true. If the heart delights in these words, one should understand their meaning. Thus, holding to the One allows the body to fulfill its natural span. Holding to the One and reflecting on transgressions may yet extend one’s term.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven encompasses countless millions, yet few attain its truth. The *River Chart* and *Luo Scripture* have been abandoned by many. The reason is this: lacking faith in their texts, few achieve transcendence and instead become common folk. Now, therefore, through the masters of the Three Divine Beings, those whose hearts are moved may be inspired. Divine spirits attach to people, unwilling to let earthly qi summon them. Examine and ponder its meaning carefully—do not doubt this text. The masters of the divine beings, having received Heaven’s teachings, thus transmit it to those who comprehend the scriptures.\n\n**Admonition of the Seventy-Two Kinds of Corpse Caution (186)**\n\nHeaven has its four corners, earth has its four corners—thus the sun and moon pass and push one another. The stars have their degrees and measures, illuminating right and wrong. People have nobility and baseness; lifespans have length and brevity, each receiving their fate from the Six Jia. Birth comes early or late; emolument matches its due. Good and evil reside in separate places, not losing even a fraction. Common folk, not knowing this, claim there is no truth. Only when spirit and numen harmonize can one be called human. Only when the spirit and numen reside in the heart can one become a lord of men.\n\nTimely responses are apportioned to their respective domains. Those who receive Heaven’s response are raised by celestial spirits. Those who receive Earth’s response are nurtured by earthly spirits. Those who receive the response of the Center are protected by human and spectral beings. Good responses follow good; good naturally elevates itself. Evil responses follow evil; evil naturally follows. All have their roots, circulating above and below. The waters of mountains and seas, each with their own boundaries, each desire those of good nature who do not oppose them as their household people. The spirits of the land likewise desire the virtuous. Each imposes its prohibitions, communicating upward to Heaven. Those who violate them bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nIn households of great wickedness, none—young or old—escape the hatred of spirits and gods. One can only rectify oneself; do not slander the divine. The Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Man—prohibitions do not favor the empty virtuous. Even the essence of spirit and qi can lend power to humans. The wicked do not escape their records; their deeds are promptly reported above. When transgressions accumulate, the Great Yin presides over the case, applying the law according to its weight. All are recorded in the ledgers of wrongdoing. People, unaware, assume there is no consequence",

The three qi combine to form a person; if they fail to combine, they scatter and become earth, no different from tiles and stones, broken and unseen, unable to compare with the whole and complete. The spirits of the three fates reside near the heart. Why cling to or cherish what is flawed? To covet a broken form is to be displayed in the marketplace—when will it ever live again?",

They benefit the central harmony, contemplating encounters with good spirits and gods, each holding to their faith—do not deceive the ignorant. Seeking long life and survival, one need not torment oneself with sorrow and poison. Contemplate and practice the affairs of Heaven above, and the spirits will elevate you, granting transcendence and enduring life, ever gazing upon the sun, moon, and stars. This is the great kindness of Heaven; one should avoid even minor misdeeds, for they too will be sent down. If evil persists unceasingly, households will be extinguished for generations—thus this admonition is reiterated. Those who commit no transgressions are spared, while offenders are deemed ill-fated youths. When one desires wrongdoing, explain and dispel their ignorance to avert misfortune. Often, one disregards others’ words only to regret it later—the speaker’s blessing is in the warning.\n\nThe stellar lodges observe humanity; one must not act wrongly. Each shall account for their deeds. The virtuous enjoy long life without doubt. Instruct and admonish the young so they may offer sustenance to their ancestors; otherwise, they erase their own names. Do not violate Heaven’s prohibitions, nor Earth’s punishments. Follow the four seasons in compliance, avoiding the taint of killing. The Five Phases bring completion—each must guard their place. Let no evil name arise. Do not slight superiors or inferiors, for all alternately govern one another, ensuring no sudden or violent ends, and thus attaining illustrious renown.\n\nReflect deeply in the heart, cautiously distancing the form. When essence and spirit disperse, malevolent ghosts startle the person. Contemplate self-preservation, never forgetting your name. Each has their joys—pursue the Dao and seek goodness to extend years and increase longevity, even attaining long life. Be cautious, be ever cautious—do not pervert justice in punishment. Though initially taxing, honor follows thereafter.\n\nMasters may be good or evil; contemplate the root to perfect the branch. Disobedient disciples also forfeit their names and cannot attain transcendence. Violating the Earth’s punishments and spirits only compounds wickedness, barring rebirth. Be cautious, again be cautious.\n\nWithin the body, the radiance of spirit arises naturally. Inner and outer become one; movements and words follow propriety without losing sincerity. The Five Spirits reside within, knowing one’s shortfalls and longevity. Do not lightly transgress, for records are kept. Even minor faults are reported above to the Hall of Light. Form and spirit are bound and interrogated regarding one’s deeds. Grave offenses incur irrevocable consequences; lesser ones reduce one’s years. If the spirits do not exonerate, the person bears the penalty—there are laws and punishments. Not only living people act thus; spirits, ghosts, and entities do the same. The ancients, knowing this, dared not transgress. The reckoning of humans and spirits descends from Heaven and Earth. Without merit, one cannot expect reward.\n\nThe hearts of the worthy and sagely illuminate the scriptures. The scrolls contain warnings and prophecies—evil people act perversely. Those who covet life are protected by Heaven. Those who covet nurturance are aided by Earth. Those who covet humaneness are beloved by all. To exceed this and do evil is to invite destruction. Heaven knows their wickedness and dispatches malevolent spirits and spectral entities to await them, entering the body and flowing outward to the four limbs, head, face, abdomen, back, chest, flanks, and the Seven Governors. They ascend to report to the Hall of Light, manifesting in seventy-two forms—this is the corpse of death. When the Five Viscera are afflicted, their departure has its time. Be cautious in diet, avoid being assailed by wind and cold. Move in accord with virtue, and this is the span of a full life.\n\nHeaven covets human life; Earth covets human longevity. Humans covet humaneness, but to act wickedly invites calamity beyond remedy. Thus, Heaven’s scriptures instruct and command the people not to violate the prohibitions.

      "translated_text": "Write Not in Vain, Solely for Self-Admonition: One Hundred Eighty-Seventh\n\nIn ancient times, the words of divine sages never strayed from the guiding principles, for they held to standards and measures. The ignorant must each take heed—this warning cuts deep indeed. Whether punishment for transgressions is light or severe, all arises from human action, not mere emptiness; one invariably receives what is due. Heaven’s nature is spontaneous and cannot be deceived. Reflect deeply and without cease, and your conduct shall become that of the celestial spirits.\n\nTransformation occurs in its time; do not lose the guiding principles. The qi of the four seasons must not be violated. When the spirit is present, negligence is no longer possible. Should one fail to report, Heaven will divine it, and the gods will act to prevent falsehoods from being concealed—only then may one live. Otherwise, punishment will be meted out: selling vegetables in the marketplace, unable to receive or take, one’s face marked by the moon as shameful, despised by others, scorned by the multitude. For grave transgressions, the penalty runs deep—forty years must pass before one may again ascend as a messenger of the gods. For middling offenses, thirty years; for lesser, ten. The domains they once governed are stripped away, each with its own appointed order. Yet if one can reform the heart and reproach oneself, one may once more endure long. Do not alter Heaven’s words and thereby invite blame upon yourself—can you not reflect deeply?\n\nFor those destined to become immortal adepts, weigh carefully the depth of your considerations. Blame rests with oneself; do not resent the words of the gods. In all your comings and goings, inner and outer, be vigilant against error or omission. Examine closely what you have received, for when entrusted by Heaven as its emissary, you may not act at will. You must promptly accept the mandate and may not delay, for reproach will come swiftly. For grave transgressions, the messenger is demoted, and the earth records what was received—name and document alike—with no delay permitted. Where a vacancy arises, one of lower rank fills it. The reason is this: even those whose hearts are wholly devoted to immortality may be demoted—how much more so the foolish adept?\n\nFrom this point onward, take care to commit no further violations. Heaven holds humans accountable for their transgressions, and ghosts and spirits serve as its agents. Those who defy Heaven’s teachings will invariably encounter misfortune and blame, not through whipping or flogging, but through the natural course of their actions. Should you doubt this, you will be regarded with suspicion and may not remain long. Thus, the warning is repeated: be cautious indeed.\n\nDo not imitate the ways of common folk, who with wine and meat seek to reconcile and appease. The Dao of immortality is most weighty, and thus it is spoken to humanity. Those whose fate is to endure are dispatched by the spirits, riding clouds and dragons, traversing all before coming to rest. When Heaven issues its commands, they must once more be carried out. Do not lose the rules and principles, nor neglect the records, for evidence is set in place, and one should not presume to act on one’s own. Heaven too rests, and each receives their due punishment—there is no cause for resentment. When reported by the spirits, do not transgress recklessly.\n\nBetween Heaven above and Earth below, the children of harmony must each respect themselves, lest they blame Heaven for misfortune or Earth for calamity, and thus be detained above or below. Even as with the people, when the words of decrees and commands lack sincerity, those below grow resentful and do not remain long. If the gods of Heaven contend over the Dao, how much more so the common folk? One ought to uphold and comply with Heaven’s laws, follow the harmony of Heaven, discard the root of recklessness, and cast off the garments of negligence. With merit, one may advance further. One may preside over those of the same rank, and when reporting, there is a fixed time. Act in accordance with the texts, without doubt. Each has their own report, and there is no mutual resentment when both are equal. Those who jointly recommend another will be punished and further debased. Though not immediately demoted, when dispatched by a great spirit, one may not act on personal inclination but must deliver the matter to the local earth deity, never to ascend again. Thus, when a vacancy arises, one’s person does not occupy it, for the ranks—high, middle, and low—are intermingled as one.\n\nHeed these words carefully, lest the span of your life be forfeit and bound to the earth. The earth here is not the soil of the ground but possesses its own fierce spirits, who guard it as Heaven’s earthly emissaries. Should one fail to act as instructed, suffering will swiftly follow. Even immortals may err—how can mortals presume to act at will? Thus, the Controller of Fate is commanded to remain close to the heart and mind, never far from a person. Humans are the dwelling place of spirit and essence; fortune and misfortune lie within. Why seek to flee afar? To bring turmoil upon oneself is to hasten ruin, and when life is not yet spent but one’s allotted years are exhausted, distance is of no avail.\n\nWhen Heaven convenes the spirits, the master knows life and death. Should the spirits themselves err or falter, they will suffer the consequences. Thus, human lives may not endure long, and so divine messengers are sent to display their writings. Those who receive the warnings and cease their evil may yet delay their report to Heaven for a brief time. In eating the various grains, take care never to burn mountains or break stones, nor to extend harm to grasses and trees, to break blossoms or injure branches, or to sell their fruits in markets and streets, cutting them with blades so that stem and root are utterly destroyed. Their mother will grow angry and report to their father, who will not spare the years of humans. Humans too require plants for their sustenance, but one should take only what is withered and fallen, not flourishing—this is to follow the natural order. Heaven and Earth give life as humans desire to live—why act with abandon and harm future generations? Those with understanding must not violate the prohibitions.\n\nThere are those who harm others, yet they rely on the completion of affairs without taking the young and tender. Those who provide food for others may extend their lives slightly, but their names are ultimately recorded. Do not raise weapons to rob, harm, or coerce lives. Heaven has decreed that such people may not live long. Evil begets evil, troubling the spirits and the qi of ghosts and spirits, each of whom may not rest. Is this not the fault of human transgression?\n\nThose who previously committed evil will have their misfortune descend upon their descendants. Thus, children may be born on inauspicious days, or during pregnancy when thunder, lightning, the waxing and waning of the moon, the new moon, the dark of the moon, blood taboos, or opposing branches converge to join yin and yang—such children will not thrive and will surely meet with misfortune. The qi of the earth summons them, yet they blame the wolf in the granary. Evil is repaid with evil—what more can be hoped for? Those who do not change will bring about their own extinction, leaving no household. In death, they will not be equal to the multitude.",

      "translated_text": "The officers, soldiers, and ranks of this company, when they reach desolate and unclean places, are scarcely covered with earth before foxes and dogs devour them. Their remains ungathered, cast aside by the roadside, both soul and spirit suffer without respite. Some cling to grasses and trees, consumed by the six livestock—when shall they be reborn? Punishment for evil and reward for good are known to all; why not reform oneself? Heaven repays merit and withholds from the virtueless. Ponder this, ponder it well. Rewards and punishments are clear.\n\nOne may die in solitary agony, yet the span of life for good and evil must ebb and flow. Examine this carefully, be cautious, and you may avoid blame. Thus, this solemn warning is given to prompt repentance. The convergence of fortune and misfortune lies worlds apart. Therefore, this text is set down to admonish and caution: do not blame Heaven or fault the earth, for good and evil must be distinguished.\n\nThe text records one’s allotted fortune, teaching that evil may turn to good, though the soul and spirit labor to exhaustion. Fools remain ignorant, so the words are repeated, reiterated, and passed on, lest later generations incur blame. By this, one may verify for oneself—what grievance remains? No resentment lingers, for each receives their due.\n\nThis text must be transmitted without cease. The wise may shorten their years, but fools will copy it themselves. Those who disregard its words bring only suffering upon themselves.\n\n**The One Hundred and Eighteenth Admonition on the Bridge of Punishment for the Dead with Transgressions**\n\nIn the age of antiquity, divine sages foresaw the future and governed in harmony with Heaven. They were deployed across the four directions, above and below, and at the center, each with their appointed ranks and duties. High and low regarded one another, and order was achieved without coercion—all acted with goodness. Fearing any lapse, all shared a single heart.\n\nHeaven’s messengers hastened to carry out their tasks, riding chariots of cloud and vapor, drawn by flying dragons. Divine immortals followed in ranks, each bearing ledgers. Without movement, they aligned themselves, fearing any disruption. Their actions followed rules, and they fulfilled their duties. In spring, they nurtured the qi of life; in summer, they fostered growth; in autumn, they oversaw the harvest, ensuring the people had offerings; in winter, they stored surplus grain, maintaining continuity without lapse.\n\nThe blessings of the spirits extended to all, bestowing glory. Even the crawling creatures and grasses and trees received their grace—was this not the benevolence of the above? Each received what was due. When they ate, there was always surplus, the new and old sustaining one another. How could one forget this? Having received the people’s aid, they ensured the spirits held no resentment.\n\nGood people were repaid, each supporting the other in sufficiency. Heaven willed it so; hoarding was forbidden, lest people suffer hunger and cold. Thus, the wealthy were commanded to lend to the poor, exchanging the old for the new, enabling life and growth to be passed to descendants. The spirits protected and aided them—was this not the vast dissemination of benevolence?\n\nYet fools, lacking understanding, refused to repay or give thanks, assuming it their due. Their hearts grew unbalanced, and they seized others’ possessions to adorn themselves, lacking any thought of repayment or regard for hardship. They believed themselves capable of living out their full span. Thus, the text was written again.\n\nDivine and perfected beings seek the good, those who transmit and apply the text’s teachings. Such people may extend their lives, increase their years, and harmonize with Heaven and Earth, transforming into spirits. They may ride forth, traversing above and below, the center, and the six directions—is this not good? Why not reflect deeply and keep it within? The dwelling of the spirit observes human actions. Knowing one’s due, one should serve and comply, turning from misfortune toward fortune. Even slight discord with Heaven’s will is unwise.\n\nThe myriad spirits and officers of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, and the five phases record human lives. How can one fail to revere them, to contemplate repaying their grace? Those who refuse to do good acts against the celestial spirits. The celestial spirits cause wind and rain to fall unseasonably, altering the flow of qi. When it should be cold, it grows warm; when it should be warm, it turns cold. Planting and sowing occur at the wrong times, and farmers grow resentful, unwilling to tend the land for others. They scorn the grains, feeding them to dogs and swine, then abandon their fields for lands of virtue.\n\nWhere they sow, the harvest is meager; trees wither and shed their leaves. The people lack surplus grain, turning to predation and strife, competing for dominance alone. Forgetting truth, they later become the impoverished, reaping nothing, drifting as refugees. Before reaching the lands where grain is scorned, they starve by the roadside, dizzy and blinded, staggering wildly. After days without food, they die of hunger, unburied. No one in their household, great or small, escapes disaster, yet they curse Heaven for their misfortune.\n\nTheir land grows desolate, granaries empty of grain, meat scarce, and no coins stored. Year by year, the crisis deepens, leaving nothing to supply the court. Exemptions increase, granaries remain unfilled, and the Minister of Agriculture holds only empty documents. There is nothing to distribute, no salaries to pay, and the central lands lack resources. The people look to the state, yet no aid is given, and a time of great hardship arises.\n\nAll this is what Heaven abhors. The earth cannot long sustain such people—do the wicked not understand? Perfected beings must urgently transmit this text to lands of virtue, urging all to reflect and awaken. Only then may they live out their full span. The ignorant are no different from beasts; life cannot be forcibly prolonged. It is attained through one’s own conduct, with no cause to blame Heaven.\n\nPonder the text carefully, constantly cultivating filial piety, loyalty, trust, benevolence, and generosity. Acknowledge your faults, and you will have descendants. The text does not speak in vain. In lands without virtue, Heaven offers no protection. The celestial balance moves swiftly, and the sun and moon hasten, their light dimmed.\n\nIn lands of virtue, the celestial balance slows, and the sun and moon shine brightly—this is Heaven’s way. The celestial balance, the sun, moon, and stars all favor the good and bright. If they dim, it is the result of one’s own actions—what cause is there for blame? They are one with Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nThose who witness Heaven’s retribution see its clarity. When the five planets deviate from their courses, weapons and war rage, barbarians invade, and rebels rise. The state dispatches generals and armies; those with fate return, those without perish. This is the fault of the great.",

      "translated_text": "Those who are unfilial as sons produce few loyal ministers in the state; their conduct impure, they invite mutual conflict, which ceases only at the year’s end.\n\nThus is revealed the *Scripture of the Utmost Cavern*, named *Great Peace*. Those who practice it receive its blessings; those who do not bring upon themselves the utmost suffering, their bodies bound without escape. Retribution is ever just, never unjust. Those who do not act as others do inflict harm upon them.\n\nIt is often said that none, whether noble or base, are not born of Heaven—only their recorded destinies differ. Cherish this, be mindful of it, and take heed: do not impose upon others what you ought not, nor encroach upon or oppress the innocent. Such deeds find no recompense in Heaven, no sustenance on Earth. Malevolent spirits follow, and one cannot long enjoy life or delight in existence.\n\nThose who neglect themselves should not expect to live. Without a name in the register of long life, they forcibly enter the halls of the immortals, offering sacrifices to the gods and beseeching transcendence. Yet when the immortals consult the ledgers, they find no name for them—their prayers and offerings go unanswered. Wandering as beggars, they implore the gods anew, only to incur divine wrath. They are devoured by fierce beasts, their bones and flesh consumed, gnawed by foxes and jackals, never to return home. Even neighbors and kin claim they have attained immortality, yet no sign or response confirms it—how can they prove themselves? By this, it is clear: verification is difficult. Only when retribution is witnessed by all is ascension confirmed. Otherwise, they suffer punishment, their claims of partial success mere delusion. Such people are mad or base, yet they take their own words as truth. Together, they enter the realm of the dead, descending to the Yellow Springs, powerless to choose their fate.\n\nThose of virtue who are destined for transcendence have their names recorded in life. When their years are fulfilled, they are received above, and escorts come for them. The young and ignorant, however, know not how to proceed. They squander their wealth, abandon their homes, and wander the wilds in vain. The Way naturally bestows rank upon people—it cannot be forcibly sought. If one inflicts suffering upon oneself, neglects to care for parents, or forsakes family to be seen as a worthy scholar, yet remains unfilial, disloyal, and untrustworthy, they may live out their years, but beneath the earth, they will know no joy or ease. With surplus wealth and property passed to descendants, one should provide for their needs without self-imposed hardship. Whether descendants are worthy or not, each lives their own life, free from mutual harm—this is good conduct.\n\nThus is this text recorded to enlighten the wise. Fools disregard it, indulging in reckless joy and anger, while the wise avoid punishment and evade misfortune. If three admonitions go unheeded, one should desist. Heaven aids the good and does not favor the wicked. Each must be vigilant, refraining from mutual blame. Let each act in their own best interest, for all possess understanding. None should transgress against Heaven, nor force what is not recorded in the ledgers—such efforts are futile. The reason is this: Heaven does not protect the rebellious and perverse.\n\nDo not abandon your dwelling or the city walls. Bones join to form the paths, sinews govern the desire for life and fortify the walls, vessels direct movement as the skeletal network, and flesh within the skin serves as the vessels’ covering. The spirit within guards and oversees human good and evil—what need is there for distant concern? The Seven Governors stand watch at the gates of the spirit.\n\nThose who seek the Way and attain life do not leave their dwellings. Through transformation, they unite with the spirit in virtue. What more does the Way require? Thus are good deeds inscribed in Heaven’s records. The ledgers of immortals differ from those of the mundane. At the time of ascension, the gods who oversee the registers and the guarantors arrive, for each knows their charge and the teachings they must uphold. There is an order to advancement, and each must proceed accordingly, not by their own will, but as the host of gods governs, ensuring all align with Heaven’s will.\n\nThose who precede others in cultivation possess hearts of clarity and vision, free from partiality. Their conduct and birth remain unknown to others, for they existed before Heaven and Earth. Their transformations above and below never stray from the Way, though the gods do not fully manifest. They establish the framework, the cycles of years and months, each with attendants to left and right. The stars and constellations are distinguished, each with its charge, tasked with advancing the loyal and assigning divisions. When good is seen, it is advanced; when evil is seen, it is withdrawn. What doubt remains? Each acts by their own effort, never misled by the gods. Thus do they succeed and earn the title *Heavenly Lord*.\n\nThose who govern Heaven’s affairs keep meticulous records, never straying from the measure. The gods who oversee the four directions and their divisions—each direction has its first, second, and third, rotating in sequence above and below—are called the *Great Year*. The *Great Yin* follows behind, overseeing the patterns of the Earth. The four seasons are established, governing all that is born and completed, dwelling in the wilds with their early and late grains and grasses. Those near do not live long, while those far endure, and the trees of sacred groves grow small of their own accord.\n\nWhen dynasties change, punishment extends to descendants. The reason is this: those who do not dwell in peace, who abandon the old for the new, find their spirits unsettled. Each person has a life-tree planted in Heaven’s soil, its type determined by the season of their birth. Those born in spring’s third month have mulberry as their life-tree; those born in summer’s third month, jujube or plum; those born in autumn’s third month, catalpa or *Platycodon*; those born in winter’s third month, locust or cypress. These are the trees of the common people, each overseen by an official. As life nears its end, the tree withers halfway; when life ends, it withers and falls, and the official fells it. How then can the person live? To seek long life and avoid death, one must transform their heart and will, transplanting their tree near Heaven’s gate, where it is called *Long Life*. The divine officials oversee it, keeping it pure, radiant, and lustrous, born of Heaven’s domain, protected by the honored spirits.\n\nIf one can but preserve their name from ruin, Heaven’s constant mandate ensures generation upon generation of glory. Though they may not descend to protect, in time, they will naturally attain refinement. The reason is this: having long departed from the mundane, they engage in Heaven’s affairs and cannot falter. The gods examine them as a carpenter’s line and ink—how can they act of their own accord? Thus do they not descend, and one should not find this strange. When merit is due, it is recognized, for they are not like the common folk. Though others may see no benefit to their families, they are inwardly honored—is this not good?\n\nThus is this revealed to later generations, to awaken their hearts. Do not conceal this text, for concealment invites punishment. Do not associate with the deceitful or those whose hearts lack filial piety and loyalty. All should act in accord with the text’s words, lest they face reproach. Can one not be cautious?\n\nThis record is for the wise. The foolish disregard it, indulging in reckless anger and joy, while the wise avoid punishment and evade misfortune. If three admonitions go unheeded, one should desist. Heaven protects the good and does not favor the wicked. Each must be vigilant, refraining from mutual blame. Let each act in their own best interest, for all possess understanding. None should transgress against Heaven or force what is not recorded in the ledgers—such efforts are futile. The reason is this: Heaven does not protect the rebellious and perverse.",

      "translated_text": "Let transmission be to those worthy of it, that they may safeguard and elevate it. Do not violate the sacred texts, nor test the divine words; heed the admonitions of the gods, for Heaven metes out retribution. Do not lightly transgress, lest calamity follow—minor offenses invite reprimand, while grave faults admit no salvation. Thus do the gods oversee one another, reporting transgressions above; those who act falsely shall face judgment. Matters must be interconnected, not kept private. The gods inspect and uphold one another, so why doubt the need for later remorse? To halt midway is to invite scrutiny; failure to confess the truth will lead to examination, and only then will the guilty be brought low. Thus, all actions are subject to review. Those who persist in wrongdoing shall remain unchanged—this is the meaning. Do not transgress lightly, nor harbor doubt. The laws of the gods are weighty; one must be cautious, deliberate, ponder, and reflect upon them. Is not the Way of long life and enduring vitality worthy of reverence?\n\nThus is this text revealed to fill the void, to establish good deeds, and to ensure unbroken succession. Those who do good shall see their years lengthen, with no cause for doubt. The natural Dao knows no end; only through awakening and mutual correction can one avoid even the slightest misstep, which invites suspicion. Heaven delights in music to gladden the gods, who in turn listen. The virtuous receive reward, while those whose tones and melodies falter face judgment. Each has their own master; none may lack origin or end. Those who fail to cultivate virtue consume from Heaven’s granaries and wear the robes of the Minister of Agriculture, yet their cold and warmth shift like garments. The yang is honored, the yin debased; coarse and fine, all things—gold, silver, brocade, pearls, jade—are to be evenly distributed, with no arbitrary bestowals. Only those with merit may receive Heaven’s clothing and sustenance. As stated before, this is reiterated to prevent resentment or suspicion, for Heaven holds the commands of the gods in great esteem.\n\nAt year’s end, ledgers are gathered and reviewed. From mountains and seas to lands and waters, all shrines and communal altars submit their records; nothing may be lost or omitted. The guardians of dwellings observe the people’s transgressions, submitting monthly reports. The Minister of Agriculture and the officials of the temples then relay the documents in turn. The Great Yin Legal Bureau calculates debts and liabilities, deducting years from one’s lifespan. When the tally is exhausted, the yin spirits of the earth and the administrators of the earthly treasuries are summoned to reclaim the physical form and examine the hun and po souls. Detailed ledgers are submitted, verifying whether deeds align with records. Those found to harbor deceit or private schemes face penalties commensurate with their offenses. If the ledgers do not bear Heaven’s mandate, the spirits and numinous beings may not afflict the living. Each must inspect and correct themselves, exposing their own faults. Offenses grave enough to warrant death result in demotion to labor at river crossings, mountains, or seas, each according to the severity of their transgression, with no omissions. Each locale—prefectures, counties, post stations—has its overseers and magistrates to enforce the law, ensuring no unjust harm befalls the spirits or numinous beings.\n\nThus do the upper and lower realms circulate documents in accordance with established decrees. **On the Desire for Fine Clothing and Footwear, Admonition 189**\nFrom ancient times to the present, all have their allotted stations, moving upward, downward, or laterally, each receiving what is due. Like a line drawn with inked cord, nothing strays—how could one fail to discern the boundary between life and death? Each must be vigilant, not offending the gods, and fulfill their duties without neglecting their fate. Record these admonitions: the virtuous shall ascend, the wicked shall be demoted. In the convergence of fortune and misfortune, each receives what they desire. One may only follow, not defy. A perverse heart that resents the divine messengers reaps its own consequences—whom else can it blame? Some are difficult to transform, their knowledge deficient; all suffer the consequences. Those who act perversely beyond their station, then boast of it, spewing worldly affairs from their mouths, utterly lacking wisdom—seeing only the present, heedless of the future—shall meet with disaster and separation from loved ones, slandering the good. They invert Heaven and Earth, oblivious to the gods.\n\nThose who keep records to resolve enmities should offer abundant libations and fine meats, indulging freely. What seems acceptable in the moment later invites reproach, as others speak lightly, cursing and uttering unfilial words, engaging in deceit, slander, and theft—even of others’ wives—day and night lying in wait to seize opportunities. They sell what they seize to sustain themselves, coveting fine clothing and footwear, competing in disputes and arguments, disregarding reason in their pursuit of livelihood. How can such lives endure? Fools become notorious villains; when magistrates learn of them, their subordinates arrest and swiftly punish them, bringing calamity to kin and stranger alike, all sharing in the blame. The poor must rely on their own efforts, not idly fold their hands. These are the life ledgers, the endowments one receives at birth. Evil spirits follow them—how can they linger long? Such people are many, their fates intertwined, never ceasing. Thus it is said: evil spirits claim them. A moment’s carelessness, if unchecked, invites ruin; one’s own actions invite the resentment of others. What seems acceptable in the moment is heedless of the future. Heed the warnings and desist, that one may live out the remainder of their allotted years.\n\nRecords of good and evil determine the span of life and the time of its extension. One must cultivate virtue. Those who fail to perceive the worthies and sages, whose wisdom is abundant, who cherish life and dread death, and aspire to the ranks of the immortals, may yet prolong their years. Why abandon the world, inviting misfortune to flow from birth, even to the child in the womb? They say, “I am born of the same parents as others,” yet they blame Heaven and curse Earth, claiming evil should be separate, not mingled—pure and impure divided like lord and servant. Thus, those who follow the great Dao live, while those who do not become dust. This has been so from ancient times to the present. There are the good and the evil, passed down through generations, never ceasing—only varying in number. Heaven, knowing the prevalence of rebellion, has thus reiterated this text. After understanding the admonitions, let there be no doubt; ten or a hundred shall align—when could one escape?\n\n**On Not Forgetting the Admonitions and Attaining Blessings, Admonition 190**\nOnly Heaven and Earth, from their primordial beginnings, formed the spiritual essence, upholding the natural order and giving rise to all transformations. None fail to receive glory.",

      "translated_text": "Whereupon the celestial bureaucracy was established: the sun, moon, and stars; the celestial pivots and balances governing the seasons; and the Five Stars, each assigned its quadrant and duty. Clouds and rain are dispensed, the people’s cares are overseen by the Office of Agriculture, and primordial qi gathers and lingers. All grains, grasses, and trees; all creatures that crawl, pant, or wriggle; all that flies, walks, or swims—each contains primordial qi, enabling the people to use them for sacrifices and sustenance. Only those taken for harm may be used for one’s own needs. Oxen, horses, mules, and donkeys unfit for service are offered to the realm. When the earth spirits have abundance, they gather to share the feast.\n\nDo not kill those fit for service, nor the young of tooth—this is Heaven’s decree, revered by the divine spirits. Yet the people, foolish and reckless, slaughter wantonly, even those with child in the womb, turning life to death to feed the mouths of others. At the hour of death, all tremble, knowing they will not live. Thus Heaven, in its compassion and mercy, enacts prohibitions and bans; violators are punished.\n\nEven the six livestock shun the sight of bloodshed, unable to bear injury—yet humans, who should cherish themselves, instead act as bandits and butchers. Their predations are many: wielding blades without cause, killing without consequence. Though not immediately executed, Heaven accumulates their transgressions. Their slaughter never ceases; their corpses drift downward, unborn. Such ones shall never encounter fortune. The gods despise them, the overseers stand before them—when could they escape?\n\nThus the record of good and evil is weighty; only by not transgressing can one avoid it. Divine persons and perfected ones reveal this text to the people, its meaning unhidden, so they may not blame themselves. Hence it is written in the vernacular for clarity.\n\nThe wise and worthy do not transgress; the foolish must be admonished without cease. Teachers come in succession, yet none should forget the root. Cherishing the root while embracing the new, longing as in the beginning—this is the Way of life. Merits vary in greatness, and rewards differ accordingly.\n\nThis is the method for awakening the unknowing: the unknowing intent, the unknowing thought, the unknowing word, the unknowing aspiration—when both are made clear, this is Heaven’s will. The Way of generation and completion emerges therefrom.\n\nGain trust from Heaven, gain trust from Earth, gain trust from the Center, gain trust from the Four Seasons, gain trust from the Five Phases—these are all the faithful rewards Heaven bestows. Not a fraction is lost—do you not understand?\n\nThis is the commissioning of formless qi, the natural submission to transformation. Thus the Three Terraces and Seven Stars assist in rectifying Heaven’s majesty; the sun and moon illuminate right and wrong, enabling the natural order, so that none may later repent.\n\nHence the edict is reiterated to all underlings and overseers: names and commands are made clear, and those who receive punishment bear no resentment. This is what it means to avoid righting others’ wrongs. No precept, great or small, is exempt from being a model.\n\nNot forgetting these words brings long blessings. One should act with caution, not losing moderation. Thus words are tested by self-sacrifice. When writings remain unused, emperors and kings do not believe. Flatterers at their side prevent the texts from being understood. Disasters arise together—where can the people find refuge?\n\nThe *Scripture of Great Peace* reappears only after three *jiazi* cycles; better to admonish ten times so they may understand. Strive to seek knowledge while alive—even the worthy and sagely may attain it. The sage promotes the worthy, then seeks life thereafter, not despising those who follow.\n\nThe register of divine immortals lies at the North Pole, linked to Kunlun. Within Kunlun’s ruins dwell the perfected ones, their ascent and descent governed by constancy. The perfected ones oversee those recorded in the registers, their names listed in order. The exalted attain the exalted, the middling the middling, the lowly the lowly—none are left to beg or plead.\n\nThe first to arrive become teachers, honored as lords, addressed as fathers. Thus teachers, lords, and fathers must be clearly understood; ministers must be loyal, disciples obedient. Reverence flows upward, ascending ever higher.\n\nThus Heaven does not forget the teacher’s grace, Earth does not forget the teacher’s nurturance, and people do not forget the teacher’s generosity. Hence loyalty, filial piety, and trust arise, fostering life without malice, drawing near to clarity.\n\nHeaven’s light shines down to the Yellow Springs; Earth’s light shines up to the heavens. The clarity of the Center harmonizes above and below. When the Three Clarities align, harmony is achieved.\n\nHeaven names the Three Clarities as the sun, moon, and stars, which illuminate the Center and Earth below without cease. In lands devoid of virtue, yin qi obscures the sun, leaving it without light. The people live in fear; grains scarcely multiply. Drought and flood strike without pattern, and the people flee as refugees to lands with grain.\n\nHeaven pities them, guiding them to live in enlightened realms, where wise rulers prosper the refugees. They return to cultivate abandoned fields, and all grains grow to maturity. The people regain their sustenance, once more honoring their ancestors, and the ghosts and spirits find peace.\n\nAmong them are the wise and discerning, who seek divine immortality. Their names are recorded in registers and ledgers. They may ascend to become Heaven’s officials, patrolling the mortal realm, harmonizing wind and rain, and governing in peace. This text is shown to later generations.\n\nThus one should do good, benefiting Heaven. Thereafter, admonish your descendants to extend their years—how could they not attain it? Though the text is repeated, Heaven deeply loves humanity, desiring that all fulfill their years. Its exhortations are earnest and reiterated, entrusted to the gods.\n\nGood deeds are promptly recorded above; evil ones erase one’s name. Do not defy this text. Cultivate a mind of goodness, ever mindful, and seek life with unwavering aspiration. The reason is this: human aspiration should attain its aim. Strive with diligence, each according to their wish—Heaven neither compels nor forbids.\n\nThe same holds for the four directions beneath the earth, for the boundless heavens, the boundless earth, the boundless realms, the boundless clarity, and the boundless light. Yet even the smallest completion is Heaven’s great division. To govern and contemplate the affairs of Heaven above, Heaven governs and contemplates the Center’s harmony, and the Center brings peace.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the superior person governs with music to enact non-action and deliver the world; the middling person governs with music to harmonize and delight the common people, thereby regulating and ordering them; the petty person governs with music merely to entertain others, thereby summoning sustenance. These three kinds of people, each understanding their intent, when the qi of Great Peace arrives, allow them to act as they will, following their use of lutes and zithers—take care not to prohibit it. If the qi of music does not emerge, governance will be difficult to pacify. When governance is difficult to pacify, qi contends and disputes arise, leading to many punishments.\n\nMusic brings forth joy, and punishments bring forth penalties, like echoes and shadows, not deviating by even a fraction. Now, music is that by which anger is stilled, and anger is that by which music is stilled—these two oppose each other. Thus, when there is music, anger ceases; when there is anger, music ceases. Therefore, anger gives rise to punishments and penalties, the root of contention, while joy and delight are the gateway to virtue and the Dao. Hence, one should follow it, allowing the root of virtue and the Dao to grow—do not suppress it, for suppression will instead give rise to the gateway of penal misfortune.\n\nFrom this emerge good and ill fortune, from this arise safety and danger. Thus, music is yang, and punishments are yin. Yin and yang are ever opposed; when yang flourishes, yin wanes, and when yin flourishes, yang wanes. Yang is the ruler, yin is the minister. When the ruler is strong, the minister submits, and the people are easily governed. When the minister is strong, the ruler is treated with contempt and disorder arises—this is the natural law of Heaven.\n\nTherefore, one should follow the ruler’s joy to subdue the people and ministers, curbing their frequent anger. The people of later ages are foolish and do not deeply understand this intent, instead often cutting it off, causing yin qi to flourish and yang qi to wane. When yin qi flourishes, there are many thieves and bandits, and criminals never cease. All things fail to grow, often harmed by yin—great calamity lies here. When the qi of music flourishes, yang qi prevails, cutting off this harm. When the ruler’s qi flourishes, it brings extended years and added longevity, so that the highest elders live long.\n\nNow, ease and joy belong to Heaven above; haste, anger, and punishments belong to Earth below. When that which belongs to Heaven is put into practice, all affairs are ordered; when that which belongs to Earth is put into practice, all affairs are disordered. Perfected One, take heed—can these words not be deeply pondered? Indeed, indeed. You may be said to understand deeply.\n\nTransmit this to show the people of later ages, so that each may contemplate its meaning—take care not to obstruct or sever it. When there is joy, the virtue of the five directions emerges in full; when there is anger, the evil of the five directions emerges in full. When there is joy, the virtue of Heaven and Earth emerges in full; when there is anger, the evil of Heaven and Earth emerges in full. Thus, when Heaven and Earth are joyful, good responses emerge; when Heaven and Earth are not joyful, evil responses emerge.\n\nWhen the five directions are joyful and harmonious, good responses emerge from the five directions; when the five directions are not joyful and are angry, evil responses emerge from the five directions—this is no small matter. Therefore, it is said: do not sever it. Let all people together contemplate its meaning, all awakening to it in unison, so that the qi of joy and delight arrives and the qi of hasty anger departs. Excellent, excellent!

      "translated_text": "**Section One Hundred Ninety-Two**\n\n*(Preceding text lost.)* When one suffers illness and hardship, the heart aches with sorrow. Kneeling before the physician, one humbly offers filial words, serving with reverence, presenting all that the household possesses, and addressing the healer with utmost respect. The physician, seeing this, honors the person and devotes all effort to seeking true medicine—fresh, fine, and properly apportioned—so that the ailment may be known and the healer summoned to bring relief.\n\nOne constantly sheds tears, speaking to Heaven in repentance, striking one’s breast to beg for mercy, kowtowing to the earth without shunning mud or broken tiles, thereby securing the well-being of one’s parents. One teaches sons and daughters-in-law to remain always before their elders, preparing rich and delicate foods, allowing them to eat whatever they desire. One does not begrudge parents the family’s resources, nor let children and grandchildren endure hardship, but instead expends all the household possesses, cherishing a singularly filial heart in their presence.\n\nRelatives and neighbors, witnessing such filial goodness and knowing one has nothing left, come to offer provisions, summoning physicians on one’s behalf. They spread mats, laboring day and night, inquiring after the parents’ condition and care. Upon hearing even a small word of improvement, the heart rejoices—this is the result of filial devotion. Heaven, seeing such a filial heart, grants recovery, restoring health as before, and the heart is filled with joy.\n\nWhen one regains the ability to eat grain, one fasts and purifies, selling possessions to offer all to Heaven, then repays the ancestors. For every blessing received, one burns pure incense, never daring to break one’s word—this is the conduct proper to a filial child. The world may hear of such goodness yet fail to practice it; those who do act thus do so by nature’s own inclination. Heaven endows their fate, enabling filial goodness to be passed down through generations.\n\nIn managing livelihoods, one advances without encroaching on others, benefiting one’s parents. In marriages and neighborly relations, the filial receive reciprocity, never forgetting kindness—such is the excellence of this way. The years of one’s parents cannot be foreknown; one prepares in advance, reducing minor expenses to save year after year, storing surpluses in hidden places unknown even to local officials. When levies and requisitions deplete a family’s wealth, if one’s filial heart remains unfulfilled and nothing is left, and if the parents’ years come to an end without proper offerings, this would be an incomplete fulfillment of filial duty.\n\nThose who practice filial piety strive to perfect their merit. When their deeds become renowned and ascend to the highest courts, when commanderies and prefectures recommend them, and in a single day they receive honor—is this not the result of filial devotion? Their descendants inherit this legacy, perpetuating it for limitless generations. Such gratitude, never forgotten, is favored by Heaven, which dispatches good spirits to constantly guard and protect—this, too, is the result of filial piety.\n\nWithin such a household, one member may attain transcendence and long life, while later generations honor them, free from misfortune. Each lives out their years without premature death—could this be anything but goodness? From goodness, all things are accomplished, all goals achieved, all desires attained, all paths opened. Strive to practice this without slackening—such is the fortune of the good.\n\nThe filial and good are not encroached upon by others; should anyone harm them, Heaven swiftly punishes them before one’s eyes. This is knowable: to understand goodness as goodness and filial piety as filial piety, yet find it difficult to emulate, is a matter of natural disposition. Heaven grants the register of the good, and filial goodness is transmitted of itself, surpassing and elevating one another—how could there be an end to such a heart?\n\nThe good and filial are naturally revered by others, who do not offend or oppose them. Their reputation spreads to the eight distant regions, and when vacancies arise among prefectural and county officials, those who know of such filial households recommend them. Local officials, moved by human sentiment and wishing to hear of their filial goodness, send envoys to inquire. Those with discernment visit personally, learning of their conduct and recommending them. Year after year, they receive honors, wearing tokens of high virtue, their descendants inheriting the name of a \"house of transmitted filial piety,\" free from evil people.\n\nNot only do they practice filial piety at home, but it extends to all within and without. As officials, they are filial to their lord, enhancing their loyalty, and thus remain in high office, filial to the court. When commanderies and counties produce rare or counterfeit goods, they use their own wealth to purchase the finest, sparing the people from labor and corvée. Where commanderies and counties abound in kindness and filial piety, the five grains flourish, and no one dies prematurely. Heaven harmonizes wind and rain for them, ensuring timely seasons—this is the protection Heaven grants to the filial and good, sparing them from disaster.\n\nThe people follow their example, nourishing and obeying with devoted hearts, and Heaven does not oppose their will. Such goodness is supremely good, such filial loyalty supremely filial—thus it is perfected. Let the unfilial of the world emulate them, cultivating filial intent. When a great mandate pardons the world, all improper transgressions are absolved, and to the filial, the fraternal, and the diligent farmers, silks, wine, and meat are bestowed. Officials pay them respect, making their filial conduct known so that others may witness it. Those who see it, moved by sincerity, may advance in love, cherishing one another with goodwill—this is the grace Heaven bestows to guide the people in obedience.\n\nThis is the principle: goodness begets goodness, filial piety begets filial piety; lack of filial piety at the root yields lack of filial piety in the end, and evil at the root yields evil in the end. The good receive their wish for longevity, living to white-haired old age. Some reach one hundred and twenty, others over a hundred—this is the result of filial goodness, not mere empty words.\n\nNot only does Heaven love them, but the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, and stars all favor them, shining upon them to keep them from encountering misfortune. Such goodness is of this magnitude—how can it not be esteemed? Among the people Heaven creates, few can be good and filial, yet those who do so alone enjoy long life and attain high office—all through the practice of filial piety.\n\nThis is not mere empty praise; thus this scripture is revealed to instruct the living. Those who wish to follow its model will be granted extended life by Heaven. It may be transmitted to descendants as a safeguard. Those who practice filial piety to transcend the world, and those who aspire to office and rank, must first fulfill filial duty.",

      "translated_text": "The affairs of the world place filial piety above all else—none surpass it. Through accumulated merit and layered deeds, past and present are seamlessly linked, leaving nothing amiss. Those reborn as humans receive their parents’ grace and encounter the teachings of filial devotion. Heaven inscribes their names in the celestial registers, placing them among the deathless—such is the household of filial piety. They may ascend to the heavens, performing the work of the celestial realm, their loyalty and filial reverence recorded among all that is revered. Appointed to heavenly offices, their glory and favor grow daily, and in the heavens they are named \"Filial and Virtuous Divine Beings,\" honored by all spirits. When fine foods are sought, their filial deeds are first offered above; none compare to them. Their lifespan knows no limit, their radiance ever increasing. Above, they behold the boundless heavens; below, the boundless earth; and in their travels, they witness the boundless realms. They foresee events yet to come, and all spirits follow their commands, never opposing their will, all joining to recommend and proclaim them. The Supreme Sovereign, seeing their unmatched filial conduct, draws them near, both within and without, and the spirits hold them in ever greater reverence.\n\nThus it is said: what Heaven loves, the spirits honor; what Heaven detests, the spirits endanger. This is plain to see. The rest must each apply their own discernment, choosing what suits them best, following what is fitting.\n\nThe text pauses briefly here, yet its later teachings remain to be revealed, ensuring nothing is omitted.\n\n**The One Hundred and Ninety-Third Secret Transmission of the Nine Lords and the Supreme Sovereign**\n\nOnly the Supreme Sovereign possesses the law and order, illuminating and penetrating all, knowing all without exception, foreseeing events yet to unfold. Before the spirits speak, their intent is already known; before their forms appear, their actions are foreseen, leaving no room for deception. How could the words of the Supreme Sovereign fail to move all? Yet though people revere them, their hearts do not fully enact them—this is known, though their intent is not fully reflected.\n\nThe reason is this: the Supreme Sovereign is wholly divine, governing all that is born and transformed, all that lives and thrives. All is recorded in the divine registers, their ranks and stations clearly ordained—how could any fail to comply? Above the Nine August Ones stand the Nine Lords, who are the kin of the Supreme Sovereign. Each has their own domain, bestowing grace and favor, and all spirits follow their lead. The spirits honor their deeds, and none fail to comply. Lesser spirits, unable to grasp the intent of the Nine August Ones, how much less can worldly people?\n\nWith a sagacious mind and keen ears, one may perceive the patterns of fortune in their writings. The celestial registers, inscribed with radiant words, are etched on tablets of gold, their texts formed of silver. These records reside with the Heavenly Lord, with duplicates kept in the innermost chambers. Other documents and memorials are written on jade slips, their characters infused with spirit, their names shining with luminosity. With every utterance, illumination follows, revealing all that is known, never contradicting what is spoken.\n\nWhen divine beings and perfected ones receive the Heavenly Lord’s decrees, they fully proclaim the affairs of spirits above and below, all knowing the matters of the mortal realm. The Heavenly Lord, aware of the spirits’ words, ensures they adhere to the rules of script and measure. The natural Dao—what does it not know? What does it not transform? Its movements and actions are free from partiality.\n\nThey partake of the celestial kitchens’ fare and wear garments of pure essence—what more could they seek? Such is the conduct of the Supreme Sovereign. Great and small spirits each have their roles, all revering and respecting one another, never acting with selfishness. They follow their desires, moving with purposeful intent, knowing what can be achieved, never allowing confusion to cloud their minds, guiding each person according to their deepest wishes.\n\nThey declare: \"You have all received the immortal registers, and your lifespan shall know no end. Adorned with purple cords inscribed with gold and silver, you shall be enfeoffed as marquises with domains to govern, your intestines filled with silken brocades, gold, silver, pearls, and jade—whatever your heart desires shall be yours.\"\n\nYet this is not the path of immortals. They discern whether a person’s resolve is firm or faltering. Some are granted the semblance of beauties and jade maidens, crafted to test their composure and advantage. If their will wavers, the forms of great and small shift before them, their thoughts trailing after them, their minds fixed on posterity—this is the way of failure.\n\nSome are placed in deep mountains and vast valleys, among beasts and tigers and wolves, or in deep waters, to test their hearts. Others encounter venomous creatures, compelling them to act. Some fear ascending high mountains, entering deep valleys, or venturing into deep waters—such is the path to failure.\n\nThese trials warn the unwary, for only those with unwavering resolve and single-minded focus can withstand delusion and remain steadfast. They traverse mountains and valleys, deep and vast, waters profound and wide, their hearts unafraid. Though they encounter beauty, their will does not covet it. Though the semblances of family, great and small, seek to restrain them, they do not heed their words, holding fast to the Dao. Advancing to meet the Supreme Sovereign, they fulfill their loyalty and filial devotion without regard for lesser concerns—this is the way to success.\n\nThus we admonish the multitude, extracting the essential teachings. Heaven trusts the virtuous, allowing the immortals to deliver them. If a person is inherently good, how could Heaven deceive them? Those who are deceived harbor doubts, forcibly demanding immortality, seeking ease without merit—how could they not be deceived?\n\nHeaven cherishes life, favoring those of sincere intent and steadfast will, urging them to grasp the Three Illuminations. The Three Illuminations reside in the heart, governing the Hall of Light, channeling the radiance of the sun and moon. When the Three Illuminations attain the Dao, the heart’s resolve remains unshaken, and the records are inscribed—not to be forcibly sought.\n\nThose who ascend to heaven in broad daylight possess true essence, their nature inherently good, their hearts inherently luminous. They move with caution, their will unwavering, unmoved by wealth or profit. Their garments are coarse, barely covering their forms—such is the conduct of those who ascend to heaven.\n\nHeaven cherishes their goodness, sending benevolent spirits to guard and protect them, shielding them from harm. The celestial spirits love them, ensuring the completion of their merit. Such is the result of their own conduct. They do not covet worldly affairs or amass wealth, and thus their deeds are perfected.",

They cannot be equated with those of good heart and resolve.\n\nThose who seek life and dread death wish not to see such wicked men, yet fail to recognize their own nature, boasting of their strength and few who can surpass them. Instead, they lie in wait day and night to seize wealth without righteousness, avoiding toil to obtain it, believing they may long abide in harmony, speaking among others. Yet those beside them see through them and reproach their words. The spirits, hearing and observing their deeds and movements, know their hearts’ wickedness and that their goodness cannot last. They report to the heavenly gods: \"Within the harmony of the Dao, there is one of reckless speech and careless words, whose goodness cannot endure. In but a moment, their evil words reappear, devoid of trust or proof. They only engage in flattery and deceit—what benefit do they bring to others?\"\n\nThey are granted the grains to eat and silks and cloth to wear, changing garments with winter and summer, seeking food to please the palate and clothes to please the body. Though the market offers profitable gain, they refuse to seek it, yet claim to support aged parents. At dawn, they rise from bed, not knowing where they go. They peddle all they possess, shifting between host and guest, lounging in taverns with legs splayed, jesting and laughing, singing and dancing, making merry, boasting of their vigor. They whisper among themselves, spreading gossip and slander. When their wealth is exhausted and nothing remains to sustain them, they band together in wrongdoing, becoming wicked men beyond restraint. How could they find even half a day of goodness? Their actions bring no benefit to the household, only sorrow and poison to parents, siblings, wives, and children, who must ever bear this grief without relief.\n\nTheir plundering and theft know no end; though they see their hair turn white, they remain unaware that the spirits sent by Heaven stand at their side, enter their bodies, and hasten their deeds. They are made to meet misfortune, their years cut short, for their clamor of evil cannot be stilled. When their crimes reach the authorities, they are seized and lawfully punished, their lives not spared. Compared to death, how can they live again? Or they may be harmed by ghosts and spirits.",

      "translated_text": "Parents ever think of them, seeing only their solitary tears and lonely vigil, with none to aid or support. In old age, they are cast aside, their food foul and meager, rarely tasting anything rich or fine. Their clothes and shoes are threadbare, with none to mend them. Such is the extremity of evil—years and months pass, days stretch empty and long, their faces grow hideous, bearing no semblance to human countenance.\n\nAs sons of this kind, they leave their parents in old age with no one to rely upon; even kin refuse to acknowledge them. This is the conduct of the wicked, whose offenses rise to the heavens. Their kin suffer for them, their names shrouded in disgrace. When such a son dies, no burial is seen, no shroud or coffin provided—he is simply interred. Foxes and jackals devour him, his bones cast upon the wilds. When shall he again know the comforts of clothing and food?\n\nThus are the deeds of good and evil made plain: men bring these fates upon themselves. Whom can they blame? How profoundly foolish are the people of the world, failing to weigh the vast gulf between life and death! While alive, they possess the breath of life, behold the radiance of heaven and earth, sun and moon, and stars. But in death, shall they again know the brightness of heaven? In the depths of darkness, when shall light return?\n\nFools do not ponder deeply, bringing calamity upon their descendants, disasters beyond remedy, misfortunes that flow to later generations. Whose fault is this? If men do not reform, they forfeit their years—should they not then emulate the conduct of the virtuous and the immortal? In every action and word, let there be discipline, bringing benefit to parents, ensuring their well-being, their food rich, their clothes fine, their faces aglow with vitality.\n\nSuch is the filial son’s conduct, his strength not that of the wicked. Ought he not alone repay his parents’ nurturing care? To be an unfilial son—when you have children, will they be filial? Good begets good, evil begets evil, as a mirror reflects a man. Do you not know your own nature?\n\nThus the records of good and evil share the same script, yet the span of life or its absence—how vast the difference! A living man’s years are numbered; when his allotted time is spent, he becomes a ghost, no longer subject to inquiry. The wicked die young, and in the underworld, they are seized and interrogated, held to account for their misdeeds. They endure suffering without respite, never knowing joy. As ghosts, when shall they find pardon?\n\nSuch is the extremity of evil: even as ghosts, they remain wicked, with nowhere to turn. Those without sustenance at home take to begging, chasing the fleeting breath of the fugitive, their days numbered. The underworld, too, desires good spirits, not the wicked. Thus, let each reflect upon goodness, not transgressing the proper measure—this alone suffices. Otherwise, what hope remains?\n\nMen should share a common purpose, aligning their wishes with life. Does Heaven favor the unvirtuous? Why then do they persist in evil? The wicked cannot long endure beneath the gaze of heaven and earth, sun and moon, and stars. Thus are they hidden away in the underworld, denied the company of good spirits, bereft of joy or distinction.\n\nWhere the text repeats itself, it is to earnestly detest the wicked and deny them long life. The virtuous, favored by Heaven, beget descendants who are likewise good. Day by day, they encounter no taboos, their lives aligned with the moon’s phases and the radiance of sun, moon, and stars. For those born thus, what fear of not attaining long life? Such is the reward of virtuous conduct.\n\nIn the contemplation of good and evil, let each follow what brings peace. Heaven does not oppose men’s actions. Ponder again and again, reflect deeply—whether to advance or retreat, those who do not cling to life have no recourse. The words of this text are clear; doubt them not.\n\nLet not suffering reach its extremity. Be mindful of life, never slackening, and heed these words with care. Though the discourse pauses briefly, let its lessons linger. If any point remains unclear, reconsider it.\n\n**Admonition Against Transgressing Evil Precepts, One Hundred and Ninety-Five**\n\nOf those endowed with sagely virtue, each has their say, each their discourse. Each distinguishes their abilities, ranks their merits, and fulfills what is fitting, so that trust may be placed in them, and Heaven’s words revered. Heaven loves mankind and bestows great merit, winning the heart of Heaven—this is the aspiration of sagely virtue.\n\nAll men wish to align with Heaven, to grasp its intent, without complaint. Thus, let each follow their resolve, avoiding baseless words, for this is to gain the people’s favor, ensuring their trust and shared understanding, adhering to what is proper.\n\nTo dwell in the world is no easy matter. In every action, one must heed what is said, never straying from the established bounds, nor blaming others while shirking self-reproach. Such is the conduct of inequity. Each harbors grievances, provoking Heaven’s wrath and displeasure, declaring that life and fate are inconstant.\n\nThus, there are those in the world of sagely and harmonious hearts who speak their intent, revealing the origins of transgressions, urging each to reform. For the span of a man’s life arises from within, not from others. Hence, it is said that the Controller of Fate resides near, within the heart, not far from man, overseeing right and wrong. At every fault, it withdraws, and how can there be no loss of time, no shortening of years?\n\nKnowing the unvirtuous, it desires that they heed its warnings, finding peace. In moments of fault, let them reflect, lest they incur punishment and forfeit their years, harboring no resentment. Heaven is vastly forbearing and patient, not meting out punishment in a single day. Only when transgressions accumulate excessively does it dispatch the underworld’s officials to seize the soul, interrogate its deeds, and find them discordant with Heaven’s pattern. Deceit follows deceit, and the confession of faults brings unpardonable sin.\n\nThus, it again commands clear admonitions, explaining how evil conduct invites calamity, urging reform. If its words are ignored, how can one long remain among the living? Therefore, it distinguishes good and evil, ensuring no grievances arise. Heaven sets prohibitions to prevent transgression. Yet men deliberately violate them, defying the commands of Heaven’s spirits. How can they long endure among men?\n\nThus, the distinction between good and evil is made, so that none may complain. Heaven establishes prohibitions to prevent their breach. Yet men willfully transgress—let them be warned by the gods. Can they long remain among the living?",

      "translated_text": "Acting thus—can this be the Way to keep men from death? Does the Central Heaven remain unaware? The conduct of common folk cannot be thus adopted. How can they long abide within the harmony of the Center, partaking of what is edible? Yet they turn against the protection of the good spirits, and their years end in exhaustion. When the time of the Central Heaven’s people arrives, this is the proof of goodness. If one does good day after day, why fear not living out one’s full span? Thus, it is known that men cannot strive to do good but harm themselves. How much worse are the evil, who believe they may long share the same fate? Unaware, the gods of Heaven hasten them downward into the earth. Once beneath the soil, when shall they be reborn? Below, they are drawn ever deeper, their corpses dissolving—such are those who receive no Heavenly blessing. Can they still be reckoned among the living?\n\nLet each consider his own conduct and not add to the suffering of later lives—this is the mark of one who is moderately good. Otherwise, one becomes an evil person, unsupported by Heaven, unbearable to Earth. One must be cautious, avoid faults and debts, and thus be counted among men. One may then be a father or mother to one’s children and grandchildren, continuing the bestowal of kindness, and in turn gain added years, with vital essence flourishing, qi and strength robust—all the result of good conduct. Evil naturally declines; what room is there for doubt?\n\nFrom this day forward, one must carefully weigh and discern, distinguishing good from evil, and reflect on which path to follow. Then one may abide in peace, for Heaven does not oppose what men do. Yet if one ponders and ponders again, acting contrary to what is right while seeking long life—can such conduct long be seen by the gods of Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars? Will they willingly shine upon it? Though protected by the gods of Heaven, one strives to endanger oneself—whose fault is this? Should this not be the conduct of one who is good and filial? Such a person attains rank and emolument, is fed by the Minister of Agriculture, and long governs the people, ensuring that superiors and inferiors serve one another—this is the noblest of men. Such is the result of goodness; evil cannot preserve the body. How great is the difference?\n\nObserve this text and its admonitions. To disregard its words and act as one pleases—is this not to act against humanity? If one has evil and cannot reform, yet possesses filial piety, loyalty, sincerity, and trust, and expects Heaven’s reward; if one falls ill and seeks healing, but has committed too many evil deeds with no time for repentance—can one long be spared? Thus, this text is written to ensure that common folk do not complain when they receive punishment.\n\nLet those who wish to live reflect: if one does not commit evil, one will not forfeit one’s years. Having received this text and its warnings, one should know how to avoid transgressions and not incur evil. If one can reform and do good, one may long behold Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, and be equal to others—is this not goodness? Yet some disregard their lives, believing that death allows rebirth. As if one who does not know one’s own evil could deem it acceptable! They wish to be equal to others in speech, clothing, and food—can this last long?\n\nThose who fear death dare not violate these admonitions, and this too is the result of their allotted fate. If a person is even slightly decent, one should straightforwardly fulfill one’s destined duty—what is there to hesitate over? Let each be cautious and strive, reflecting on the safety or peril of one’s actions. The admonitions in this text are self-evident.\n\nThe Heavenly text desires men to do good and does not wish to hear of their evil. Thus, the register of life is not complete—there is no great mystery in this. Reflect carefully and do not grow lax. Heaven has a register of the living, which may be coveted; Earth has a register of the dead, which is most detestable. Between life and death, there is no comparison—does one not understand this? Knowing evil, one must be cautious and examine oneself. One must not for a moment lose one’s years and lifespan—how lamentable this would be!\n\nWhen speaking with others, let one’s words and voice win their hearts by doing good. Heaven favors this; let no evil words escape, lest one bring blame upon oneself. Since all share the same breath, one must choose words carefully before uttering them. Not even a single unkind word should be spoken, that one may prolong one’s life. Those who can ponder and practice the affairs of Heaven may obtain the essential words of the Heavenly gods. By heeding their admonitions and acting with reflection, one may alter one’s life register and be transferred to the bureau of long life.\n\nOne should cultivate oneself and rectify one’s conduct, never forgetting Heaven’s bestowals. One should set one’s heart on repaying this great kindness, making it easy to reform one’s aspirations. Heaven, in turn, will remember and ensure one does not encounter evil. One may trust the words of the Heavenly text and attain governance without strife.\n\nThe text’s words are not complete; one should select what is practicable and act accordingly, not forcing what one cannot do. Let each reflect on the good and evil of one’s own conduct. Heaven endows one’s nature—let there be no doubt. One should not deceive the good, nor should evil people obtain blessings. These words are clear—what room is there for doubt?\n\nThose who become immortals do not commit evil; each cherishes their life—this is the proof of goodness. The text’s words are concise, reiterating the wishes of Daoists past and present. It speaks of the good and evil of the Way, urging reflection. If one does not heed it, the fault is one’s own. Those who complain should know that their complaint stems from their own lack of understanding, which leads to poverty and old age, and ultimately to self-blame.\n\nThe rest is left to one’s own will. If one desires to cherish life, one should not commit evil. Thus, one must reflect and know suffering and joy. Whose joy is it? Whose suffering? One must also reflect on this and not utter complaints or reckless words. Let one think carefully and think of doing good—this is why these earnest words are spoken.\n\nLet one’s words be known and not transgress Heaven’s rules. By perfecting the natural Way, what cannot be accomplished? What cannot be transformed? All will welcome it—is this not the natural grace of Heaven?\n\nConsider the foolish below who do not reflect on receiving Heaven’s great share, being born as humans, and believing they will long endure.",

      "translated_text": "Yet one does not expect that there are divine spirits of shamans—one must cease and not offend them. The written admonitions are not few; they emerge again upon reflection. The texts bear duplicates, hence the repeated warnings. Regard those who do not heed the writings: let them reflect on doing good, for there is hope in living. Those who speak wicked and disobedient words are recorded without end. Be cautious and desist; desist and still reflect—reflect afterward on what is lacking, and if unsatisfied, expound further.\n\n**Incantation One Hundred Ninety-Six**\nNow, the people of the world each disobey filial piety, turning to rebellion and treachery, competing in disloyal and faithless deeds. They reverse the principle of requiting kindness, believing themselves to have become fully human and to endure long upon the earth. In all they say and teach, there is never the slightest good, only wicked words. Yet they constantly harbor ingratitude and refuse to bestow mercy, acting solely for their own satisfaction, never considering that suffering will follow their words. Such persons do not belong in this world; they ought not to have even a little trust. Stubbornly foolish, they believe they have won the hearts of others. Their spoken thoughts cannot be adopted, nor can they serve as models. Without fear or restraint, they commit transgressions and offenses, acting as they please, reckless of their lives, blind to long-term preservation. In their comings and goings, they do not repay their parents, nor do they attend to them morning and night, treating them as barbarians. Who are these people? From whom were they born? They slight their kin, neglecting food and drink, never understanding the Way. They are no better than the six livestock, with no fixed term for life or death. Their mouths crave fine flavors, their bodies fine clothing—does Heaven intend to let them live long? Their conduct cannot be followed. If they perish, will their deeds be of use? They provoke Heaven’s wrath, leaving no time for joy. Should Heaven cherish their lives and spare them from death? All they do is offensive and improper, yet they persist—this is self-seeking, as if they wish to avoid the sight of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, stars, and all living beings.\n\nHeaven’s admonitory texts clearly expound good and evil. If one does not believe these words, what recourse is there? Does one wish to live long and breathe freely? Are they not inferior even to the six livestock, birds, and beasts, which possess some understanding? Such extreme folly—how can one rely on the mysterious? They act frivolously, squandering all their wealth, engaging in reckless behavior that invites punishment, devoid of reason. From year to year, they neglect their households, wandering and playing, utterly unaware of restraint. Their thoughts never arise from proper measure, and so they cannot endure. These people owe their lives to their parents, yet their conduct lacks all righteousness. They show no loyalty or filial piety, no obedience, only rebellion. Should Heaven preserve them, allowing their eyes to blink and their breath to continue? Even in death, their transgressions remain, extending to their unborn children. Consider those who bring calamity: though they commit evil in life and die prematurely, they cut short the lives of those not yet born. Their hope of living as ghosts, then dying again, is insufficient to atone—is this not the result of their wickedness? How can they expect to live freely? If those born now resent their faults, why do they speak recklessly and act so arrogantly?\n\nWhy do the people of the world not reflect on themselves and reduce their transgressions? What benefit do accumulated faults bring to one’s body? They only shorten human life—should this not be considered? Why do they invite disaster upon themselves? This is plain to see. Those who dwell in the world, practicing filial piety and goodness, attain longevity, their descendants continuing in succession. They witness honorable offices and generous emoluments—is this not the result of doing good and being filial? Those who lack goodness and disregard future suffering are the most rebellious and wicked, beyond comparison, never ceasing. When your parents gave birth to you, did they wish to hear your goodness, or would they rather hear evil words, even in their old age? Siblings who resent one another never know joy. Each blames the other for their faults, yet they persist in their own ways, refusing to do good. Such conduct cannot last. It benefits neither Heaven nor Earth, neither people nor the four seasons, five phases, sun, moon, or stars. Such people are utterly wicked—what do they hope for? Should they not look up in reverence? Do they believe Heaven does not dispatch malevolent spirits to oversee their transgressions? They should not be surprised: in all they seek and do, there is nothing to rely upon. Day by day, they face decline, illness, and unending death—why would Heaven delight in killing them? The multitude says: “You have no understanding; in an instant, they are slain.” Or they may encounter the authorities, their wealth and property exhausted, their grievances and misfortunes continuing—is this not the result of their own conduct? Why blame Heaven and cry out in resentment?\n\nThe common people are thus: they wish to offend Heaven—what benefit is there in self-justification? Those who long evade sacrifices owe debts to the spirit officials, refusing to make amends. These debts should be resolved. Always in the third month of spring, on an auspicious day, perform the resolution. Three resolutions may reduce the written records, for spirit officials do not delight in heavily punishing people. Yet if documents persist, with superiors and inferiors shifting blame, how can the words of the common people—who cease when impoverished and do not complete their deeds—be heeded?\n\nIn life, all consume tangible things; in death, they should consume qi, yet they do not. Ancestors say that bearing children is for the time after death. Once they attain the consumption of qi, they join their peers and no longer consume one another. If children are born thus, how can you expect your descendants to care for you long? Your life will also end, like those who have gone before. When hunger strikes, what will you gain? In the heavenly offices, great filial piety is required. Sacrifices must be performed clearly—how can there be doubt? For three years after death, before burial, one must offer prayers and thanksgiving. One cannot say, “There are unburied dead on earth, yet no sacrifices are made.” Not eating increases transgressions and faults, harming descendants. This is plain to see—sacrifices must be performed.\n\nThose who were wealthy in life indulged in extravagance, slaughtering cattle, sheep, pigs, and the six livestock for sacrifices. The officials gradually grew distant, and later, they faced reproach, heedless of poverty.",
      "overlap_context": "flect on this and not utter complaints or reckless words. Let one think carefully and think of doing good—this is why these earnest words are spoken.\n\nLet one’s words be known and not transgress Heaven’s rules. By perfecting the natural Way, what cannot be accomplished? What cannot be transformed? All will welcome it—is this not the natural grace of Heaven?\n\nConsider the foolish below who do not reflect on receiving Heaven’s great share, being born as humans, and believing they will long endure.",

      "translated_text": "Wealth and property cannot be swiftly acquired, yet conduct remains unworthy—refusing to return what is due, sacrifices cease for long. How can reproach be swiftly resolved? One ought to frequently acknowledge debts and transgressions; only then may goodness follow, and descendants surely live long. Heaven delights in those who confess their faults first. For impoverished households that, knowing the taste of grain, gather to kowtow and strike their breasts in repentance, lifting their faces to thank Heaven—Heaven pities their hardship, and the sacrificial officials lend them means, allowing modest offerings. This is what Heaven grants; though one may possess only modest wealth, one must perform sacrifices without doubt. To fail in this is to meet one’s ancestors at the assembly of spirits, where the sacrificial officials reproach the neglect. Ghosts are sent to guard the home, and illness afflicts the living without end. The ancestors, bound and confined, cannot be consulted through divination; when the proper day arrives, one must act. Heaven’s granted respite expires—failure is not without consequence. One must thank Heaven and Earth, summon the bodily form into the earth, while the hun-soul is examined in the celestial prison, where transgressions are weighed in turn, and death follows in succession. The fault is too grave, thus this text is sent down so that all may know to accept Heaven’s punishment without resentment. Let them warn one another, that none may transgress again. Ancient records exist, yet offenders never cease. For those whose coffins remain unburied, sacrifices must not be neglected. Now this text is extended once more, for those of sincere heart to read and comprehend its meaning. Doubt not its words—still one may be inscribed in the register of the living. To doubt and fail to act is to fix the day of death. Reflect upon this; do not blame Heaven or fault the Earth.\n\nProceed, and let this text rest briefly in your thoughts. Thereafter, ponder its words, understand what must be done, and return to the Dao.\n\n**Heaven’s Faithful Retribution: Divine Formula One Hundred Ninety-Seven**\n\nOnly those who advance in goodness and seek life, who delight in repaying Heaven’s will, may extend their years from the present. Those who witness Heaven’s workings above say: “I too shall follow what Heaven transforms and accomplishes.” When they see the scriptures of long life, their forms and countenances change, their essence and spirit flourish, their radiance increases daily, without cease. Such are those of sincere and virtuous intent, who never forget Heaven’s grace. Those who repay kindness—when would they ever resent? Even in moments of rest, their hearts reproach themselves, grateful to have been born human and to rely upon Heaven’s completion. They come to know Heaven’s prohibitions, shunning harm and pursuing goodness, never opposing the divine. Seeing goodness, they follow it, never failing to reproach themselves and repent, turning toward rectitude. They ponder its meaning, never daring to grow complacent or doubtful. In their resolve to do good, they awaken to Heaven’s will, understanding it fully—no doubt remains. Reproaching themselves and repenting, days accumulate; having received blessings and protection, they uphold Heaven’s transformation, spared from peril. Knowing they receive Heaven’s recompense, how could they forget even for a moment? They fear the divine may reproach their words, thus they remain disquieted, never at ease. Driven by the desire to advance, they strive to fulfill Heaven’s will, fearing any lapse. Thus they purify their hearts and reform their conduct, moving the powers above, yearning for ascension and coveting life. Truly, they dread the term of short life, fearing prolonged absence from Heaven and Earth. They exhaust their strength and devote their loyalty, pondering their sincerity. Having heard the words of the divine many times yet never seen their forms, their hearts cannot rest, ever reverent and fearful, anxious day and night, never daring to grow complacent. For this reason, they dare not abandon goodness for evil deeds.\n\nAll people receive food and drink, inhaling Heaven’s primordial qi, allowing them to breathe. Knowing human sentiment, they understand they receive Heaven’s grace and must repay it—when would there be doubt? Heaven engenders the essence of humanity; Earth nurtures their form, allowing them to grow and mature. Seeing Heaven’s admonitions and reading its words, they tremble without fear, how could they speak in defiance? Their hearts ever quake—when would they know peace? Only the great divine, in timely mercy, repeatedly grants leniency, though they know they cannot repay such great kindness in full. Only the great divine, in boundless compassion, allows them to remain long within the qi of life, extending the years of their allotted span. They dare not forget the measure of great grace, nor the fullness of its bestowal, never daring to slacken even for a moment, nor betray its favor. Only the great divine completes them, allowing them to see the celestial spirits and converse with them, longing to hear further admonitions. They hold Heaven’s words in reverence, and only when they receive its response do they dare trust. The great divine responds to the words of the virtuous: the Heavenly Lord ever cherishes those of sincere and good heart, advancing them when they prove useful to Heaven.\n\nFrom now on, those of sincere and virtuous heart may present themselves and report to the Heavenly Lord, who will heed and employ their offerings without doubt. Surely it shall be as previously stated—this is what the Heavenly Lord dares to affirm. As the years and months draw near, strive to trust Heaven’s words. Heaven too trusts those of sincere and virtuous heart, who no longer dwell among the common. Their names are recorded in the celestial register, among those who ascend to Heaven in broad daylight—this covenant is not deceitful. The Heavenly Lord desires to advance the good, those of sincere heart who do not defy His words—such are the ones. The great spirits, from afar, witness their conduct. Though their households may lack for a time, as previously stated, they need not worry. Let them constantly reflect that they shall stand before the spirits of Heaven above—this is the result of goodness, and they must not grow weary.\n\nThose of sincere and virtuous heart say: “In life, I am no ascendant being, yet I resolve to repay the great divine, seeking advancement and coveting life. I exhaust all I know—how dare I hope for ascension in broad daylight?” When selected, they are deemed worthy, yet in life, they dare not presume. They fear being reproached by the great divine, yet by grace, they are fortunate to receive favor, their allotted measure of grace fulfilled. They regret only that they have not yet repaid it in full, and pray the great divine may grant them respite to recover. Hearing the great divine’s words, they compare their former intentions with their present resolve, advancing them to the Heavenly Lord, who declares: “This is one of sincere and virtuous intent.” The Heavenly Lord desires to draw near them, allowing no doubt.",

      "translated_text": "The bestowal of grace does not lie with the great divine—why then speak of repayment? Rather, one ought to clarify what one knows, ensuring that there is indeed a sign of reciprocation, and simply offer sincere gratitude with a pained heart. Thus shall the gods protect them, allowing no malevolent spirits to interfere. Be ever cautious in speech, making goodness the foremost topic, and inscribe words with trust as their bond, so as not to betray those of sincere and virtuous intent. Day and night, Heaven itself commands the divine generals to guard them, leaving no room for doubt. As for writings that command or obstruct, let them first be borne by those who inherit past burdens, and do not take them as cause for worry.\n\nThose of sincere and virtuous resolve say: “By nature, I am humble and lowly, long mired in the mundane world. I fear I cannot extricate myself from its midst, yet I yearn for the favor and kindness of the great divine, moved by their warmth and sincerity to recognize my own worth. Only when the great divine reports to the Heavenly Lord am I placed among the ranks of the undying—how then dare I hope for ascension in broad daylight?” The great divine replies: “The Heavenly Lord trusts those of sincere intent who advance in virtue. His decree admits no double promise, no room for doubt—this is the will of the Heavenly Lord himself. Though you may worry over your family’s insufficiency, with hunger and cold pressing upon you, Heaven’s kitchen is ever at hand. Simply look upward to accomplish the task, and the gods will themselves instruct your children—cast aside such concerns. After receiving your allotted measure, how could you ever forget the words of the great divine? Your only fear is that you may fail. You dare not neglect the great divine’s pillow and mat, keeping them ever in your heart and breast, never slackening.”\n\nSuch are the words of the great divine. The Heavenly Lord, who knows all, deems that goodness naturally attains goodness, and sincerity naturally wins the Heavenly Lord’s favor. When the matter was previously presented to the Heavenly Lord, he commanded the great divine: “As I have already stated, the day this person is to ascend must not be missed. Let no delay occur. The tally is already set within their heart, and the gods, seeing clearly, speak in confirmation. Transformation will come on the appointed day—only remain steadfast in thought day and night.” The disciple replies: “After receiving such a decree, how dare I slacken? Will I truly be made whole?” The great divine says: “You must inscribe the tally, and it will be seen for yourself. Have no fear of failing to attain heavenly longevity. It is not only the great divine who speaks thus—all the gods affirm that this is a person of sincere heart, and all the gods are concerned for them. Simply look upward to accomplish the task.”\n\nThe disciple says: “Such a weighty matter—if it comes to pass as wished, I shall only humble myself in reverence.” The great divine replies: “This is also the wish of such a person. One ought to respond with a sincere heart. The Heavenly Lord values their family, ensuring they do not fall into grave transgression. The burdens they bear shall be resolved—do not trust the words of spirit-mediums or diviners, for their divinations can neither add nor subtract. Those who seek to deliver and enliven others must rely on the true gods. Even if lesser spirits are negligent, the higher powers will resolve it—do not act recklessly in ways that are improper. This is known to those of sincere heart who walk the Dao.”\n\nEach must consider their own path, trust in Heaven’s words, for Heaven does not deceive those of sincere intent who advance in virtue. Though you may know kindness and constantly reflect upon it, never forgetting for a moment, beware: when malevolent spirits descend from below, those without resolve, who fail to guard themselves and indulge in reckless thoughts, will be cast down, unsettled, and their endeavors may come to naught. This scripture does not trust the wicked, nor do the wicked trust this scripture. Only when efficacy is demonstrated and reciprocation is received can it be truly known. Now, you must have faith in the writings of those who advance in virtue, for the gods themselves desire to see the sign of reciprocation. Those who lack sincere intent to advance in virtue will find nothing. The words of this scripture are already clear—when the sign is seen and verified, it will not be long.\n\nHow is this made evident? For those who delight in life, Heaven causes them to rejoice—this is Heaven’s sign of reciprocation. Such a person will surely transform into a divine being, ascending in broad daylight without doubt. Day by day, they grow lighter, their food intake diminishes, and their essence and radiance become ever more refined. Day by day, they draw nearer to the gods—this is the sign, the clearest of proofs. Have no doubt.”\n\nThe disciple says: “Having received your admonition and decree, I shall follow your words, reflecting upon and bearing them in mind, never slackening or forgetting.” Though I was once ignorant, after our meeting, I have grown ever closer, as if no different. The great divine says: “Excellent, excellent. You shall indeed be favored to succeed. Your name is fitting, and you shall complete the work—this is the constant admonition of the gods. Though the scripture’s words are many, they are weighty for the sake of the Way of life. Do not be alarmed, for the words will soon come to an end. Each has more to say to those of sincere intent and reflection.”\n\n“Yes, yes. I dare not forget.”\n\n**Decree on Advancing the Method, One Hundred and Ninety-Eighth**\n\nReflect upon the people of great sincerity and trust from ancient times to the present, each demonstrating efficacy and accumulating merit before Heaven, thus daring to step forward. In their actions and retreats, they have never committed even the slightest transgression. They constantly harbor compassion and benevolence, bestowing kindness and favor to benefit the multitude. They do not lose even the smallest trust, nor do they fail to revere Heaven and Earth, following the guidance of the four seasons and the five phases, aiding in the generation and completion of all things. They dare not harbor any intention of failure that would endanger themselves and bring instability. Thus, they examine their own transgressions and burdens, fearing they may not be resolved, and that the multitude of gods will record them, reporting them to the Most High.\n\nFor this reason, they dare to rest in peace. From ancient times to the present, goodness and evil flow in succession—when has there ever been an end? Therefore, they remain composed and tranquil, never slackening or forgetting Heaven’s works. Those who seek virtue reflect within their own hearts. When they see others with good hearts, they rejoice; when they see others with evil hearts, they are alarmed. They imagine the heavenly gods knowing all, each advancing in their own way. They further reflect: “Originally, I was born in the mundane world, yet my heart constantly yearns for the great transformation, coveting the Way of life and departing from the realm of death. I cherish the essence and radiance, desiring them to remain within me, so that I may love myself and my heart may be at peace. Otherwise, I fear I will not be among those who are constantly seen.”\n\nOnly the gods of Heaven, in their timely mercy, instruct them in advancement and retreat, aligning with Heaven’s will. They must not commit even the slightest transgression, lest it be heard by the Lord of the Most High.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, through the gods they seek broad inquiry, and only by not opposing them do they avoid suspicion. Having received a single portion of destiny, they dare not forget it even for a moment. They only reflect upon their words, contemplating the heavenly admonitions to perfect themselves and avoid peril. This is the day of the gods’ favor and grace, and they dare not rest, nor fail to reflect upon repaying this profound kindness.\n\nBefore the gods have reported to the Heavenly Lord, they learn of the dispatch and the attending gods who bear the decree. When these individuals speak or act, how can their intentions be fully questioned? The gods inquire of them, then report back: “The people of harmony and equilibrium, who cultivate goodness and accumulate merit over time, covet long life. They humbly declare their constant vigilance, fearing faults or debts, never slackening in their devotion. The gods recount their merits and effects.”\n\nThe gods then confer among themselves: “This person of merit and virtue, who reflects within the state of harmony, seeks to repay Heaven’s great kindness. Having long accumulated good deeds, they wish to declare their merits through the gods, yet harbor doubts and dare not advance to report to the Heavenly Lord. They have long entrusted themselves to the gods’ trust, having rendered service to Heaven. Those with merit should be advanced.” Yet the gods observe their conduct over time and wonder why they have not reported it.\n\nThe gods, filled with apprehension, say: “Originally, we did not know this person’s arrival, and fear they may not be entirely sincere.” They deliberate on their intentions, unaware whether the Heavenly Lord has heard of them. The gods, lacking resolve, see a meritorious person yet fail to report them to the messengers of the Way. They dispatch spirits to examine their accumulated deeds, finding great merit. The gods, thus without excuse, have no merits of their own, yet share an external mindset, assuming the Heavenly Lord remains unaware.\n\nThe gods offer their explanations, asking: “What use is there in this? Is it merely for gain? Can we each be at ease?” They thank the gods, acknowledging their duties, removing their crowns in apology: “We minor spirits, in our official roles, have fully devoted our loyal hearts, yet are questioned for our inexcusable faults, awaiting death at the gate.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord issues a decree: “Wait outside.” He commands the gods to prostrate themselves, standing in peril as they attend. The decree instructs: “The Heavenly Lord does not wish to harm the gods, nor yet bears to inflict injury. They are to be exiled to the land of harmony and equilibrium, in the capital of Luoyang for ten years, selling medicine to cure the sick without accepting excessive payment. After the exile, those of higher rank shall serve in the Hearing Bureau for one year, and only upon merit shall they be restored.”\n\nThus, the gods, seeing the Heavenly Lord pardon their capital offense and impose only a light exile, truly recognize their transgressions. Humbled and broken, they had not hoped to live, nor borne any intent of harm. They again offer their service to the Heavenly Lord, saying: “We inform the clerks of the Bureau and descend without delay, dispatching spirits to observe and report.”\n\nThe Bureau reports and dispatches them as the Heavenly Lord commands. The Heavenly Lord instructs the clerks to inform the great gods, reviewing their documents and ordering one god to inspect them. The clerks transmit the documents to the great gods and their subordinates, each fulfilling their duties. When they see those who covet advancement through merit and goodness, they are to present them, reporting all matters clearly.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord instructs the great gods: “Swiftly observe this person and question the dispatched spirits to see if their accounts align.” The great gods reply: “We were sent to observe this person, reviewing their days and merits, and report back. As instructed, we observed the meritorious in harmony and reported as the spirits declared.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “Such a person of merit, yet those under the gods’ charge failed to report them to the Heavenly Lord in a timely manner—was this not negligence? Having received a light exile in the land of harmony, let this serve as a warning henceforth. Those who fail to report merit shall be punished upon the Heavenly Lord’s hearing, bearing their own exile. Each must attend to their duties. Dispatch spirits to guide and transform them, that they may become gods and augment their essence and radiance. Review the registers, and for those not yet recorded, inscribe their names.”\n\nThe great gods receive the decree and return to the Bureau, examining the registers for the names. They report to the Bureau: “The documents list this person. We request to consult the Heavenly Lord’s internal registers to verify alignment.” The Heavenly Lord produces the documents and reviews them, finding them consistent with the external records. He then instructs the great gods: “Verify whether their term is complete and report back for careful review.”\n\nThe Heavenly Lord asks the great gods: “Did you not fully observe them, yet now request another review?” The great gods apologize for their duties, and the Heavenly Lord says: “Hasten the review and return swiftly.” The great gods then verify that the person’s term is complete. Their failure to report, being inexcusable, incurs guilt, and they await execution.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “For now, restore their rank and duties, but do not slacken.” He summons the person to ascend, cautioning them not to neglect their minor duties, knowing how to accumulate merit. “Yes, yes,” they reply, requesting to follow the Heavenly Lord’s decree. “So be it.”\n\nThe great gods then appoint the person to a minor post, observing their conduct. As the days and months are yet few, they request further verification of their sincerity. If their merits are great and their trustworthiness genuine, any deficiencies shall be filled by their appointment.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord says: “Heed what the great gods have reported and do not slacken.” The great gods reply: “Yes, yes. We request to dispatch spirits to observe and report.” The Heavenly Lord approves.\n\n*Text incomplete: Section 199, \"Without Written Decree, the Mandate is Not Fully Concluded\"*\n\nOnly in Heaven do the sagely and enlightened possess offices and duties, each exhausting their loyalty and conduct, never failing their superiors.

      "translated_text": "Wherever their circuit extends, wherever their reach encompasses, upon receiving the decree they proceed to inspect, never daring to linger even for a moment. Only after fulfilling their private duties do they dare speak, sincerely returning to their charge, never presuming to act on private matters beyond their station. They preserve the mandate in full, sparing neither day nor night in self-reproach, ever fearful of inadequate service. Each governs their own conduct, striving to align with the Supreme’s intent—how could they dare grow lax, lest they fail in propriety?\n\nDaily they advance of their own accord, requiring no divine admonition, yet desiring self-cultivation to attain longevity. In their dealings with the gods of Heaven, whether great or small, all matters are mutually known. What can be executed must not be undertaken arbitrarily, lest suspicion arise; every action is reported without cease. Why is this so? Each person harbors their own aspirations. Each has their own thoughts, their own achievements, their own calculations, their own perspectives, their own expressions. From birth, each desires attainment, each knows their place, and their hearts are thus made clear.\n\nIn this bureau’s affairs, reverence for life is paramount—life is foremost, while all else is secondary to one’s own reckoning. The *qi* of life infuses the human body, neither departing nor separating, mutually sustaining and completing. The gods, too, prize the attainment of their names, transforming and traversing without obstruction, moving freely through the smallest and greatest spaces.\n\nOrdinary people do not perceive the gods’ forms, yet the gods know one another intimately. Their forms are composed entirely of *qi*—how could they not achieve their ends? Great gods and lesser gods differ in the waxing and waning of their radiant essence. When their lifespan increases ninefold, so too do their years. Those who enact great transformations through goodness enjoy boundless longevity—above, there is no higher; below, no lower. They move without hindrance, without exterior or interior, their form like a ceaseless cycle. To halt is to halt; to proceed is to proceed. Through breath they become divine, their brilliance and splendor flourishing.\n\nYet even in ascent and descent, there are appointed times. When the moment arrives, they act and return in due course—not entirely at will, for hierarchy constrains them. Each serves as emissary to another, each bears their ledger, each holds their office. Their hearts must align with their duties, their resolve unwavering, their actions clear. Each witnesses their own merit, each advances what they know, harboring no private intent. Every action adheres to instruction, never straying from the teachings. With unceasing diligence, they press forward in their aspirations, halting only upon receiving the decree.\n\nSuch is the vow of the gods of life, each bearing a talismanic transmission as proof of their conduct. In all their inspections, they partake of provisions as stipulated, never exceeding the written decree, taking only what is allotted. The waystations of Heaven maintain their own records; those unentitled to stay must not linger.\n\nThe Heavenly Lord’s constant teaching forbids recklessness, lest the guardians of transmissions abuse their authority. Offices have their hierarchies—none may falsely claim high rank to prolong their stay in the waystations. The officials receive the Heavenly Lord’s decree, and any transgression in the waystations is reported, along with the offender’s name, rank, and affiliation. No concealment or deceit is possible, for the Heavenly Lord already knows. How could private favor be shown? All is made clear and just.\n\nTo act without the Lord’s command, to repeatedly submit ledgers—this dissipates one’s radiant essence and diminishes one’s lifespan. This is known and certain. One must be vigilant at all times, never daring to act on personal inclination, never failing to heed the teachings from above. The gods of Heaven continually inspect and recommend one another without respite.\n\nThose who follow, whether ascending or descending, must know these prohibitions. The sagely and enlightened do not transgress them, but lest later generations remain unaware of these warnings, the Heavenly decrees are disseminated to all under Heaven. Such is the Heavenly Lord’s great benevolence, lest any violate them.\n\nIt is the Heavenly Lord’s wish to cultivate goodness, and thus these texts are shown even to ordinary people. Though few among them understand the harmony between Heaven and Earth, each observes their own taboos. The decrees circulate throughout the world, among the people of the central harmony, the farmers of the roads, the gatherings at field boundaries, the households and official lodgings, the gates, wells, and hearths. The powers of punishment and virtue each govern their domains—evil must not be permitted.\n\nFurther records are kept, noting names and accumulating the sagely governance of myriad affairs. The Heavenly Lord of the Hall of Light learns of them, and human lifespans are reduced, even unto death. How can one not be cautious? Those who disregard these texts are later generations who disbelieve the words of their forebears. Thus, they are again issued to those of discernment who observe the prohibitions, that the common folk may know them. Without written decree, the mandate cannot be fully concluded.\n\nEvil records accumulate day by day, seldom diminishing. Therefore, the Lord first issues written admonitions to prevent transgressions. To violate them is to thin one’s destiny without doubt. One must follow the written decrees—minor transgressions may yet be remedied, but for grave offenses, how could pardon be obtained? The admonitory texts are not limited to a single scroll. One must be doubly, triply cautious, for the patterns of Heaven brook no license.\n\nThose with understanding seldom transgress. Should they err inadvertently, Heaven may pardon them, sparing them from the ranks of the wicked. But to persist in evil is to bind oneself to the ledgers of death, consigned to the Earthly Bureau, where one’s remains are interred. When will they emerge again? Their refined souls are confined, interrogated about their deeds in life. Their words differ, and they are subjected to torment. The suffering of their souls is extreme—whose fault is this but their own?\n\nBorn as fellow humans, why engage in evil? Each should guard their conduct well. Heaven bestows human lifespans, which cannot be regained. To do evil is to shorten one’s years—when will there be benefit? At this juncture, the Heavenly Lord acts with resolve, unwilling to overlook evil deeds and grant long life. Is this not known?\n\nThe repeated admonitions exist because people do not change, yet the Lord desires they live out their years. Those who refuse to do good bring ruin upon themselves, and what can be done with those who persist in evil? Minor transgressions may be pardoned for the sake of their future, but should they remain unprepared, they will be reminded again.\n\n**Admonition on Great Longevity, Section 200**\nOnly those of resolute intent remain unconfused in heart.

      "translated_text": "Each is allowed to follow their wishes, thus fulfilling their heart’s desires. The myriad twelve thousand beings all arise from the earth of central harmony, growing and flourishing, each returning to cover and shade its own roots. Their blossoms and fruits nourish the body and mouth, aiding the grain in the field, providing sour, salty, bitter, and bland flavors. Water transforms naturally into salt to harmonize all tastes. Beans become fermented paste to enhance the salt’s savor, their richness or lightness left to free will. All edible vegetables and creatures are given for the people to consume, sustaining warmth and fullness, nurturing their forms to grow, and passing this down through generations. Even the six livestock unfit for labor are fed to them, their meat made tender, sweet, and crisp for consumption.\n\nThese are the spirits Heaven appoints to their duties, balancing and equalizing all things so each may follow their wishes without disturbance to their peace. Is this not Heaven’s grace and benevolence bestowed upon the people? Why then does Heaven not demand repayment? When would Heaven ever seek recompense? It is only that the common people, having received such great kindness, fail to return thanks—this is why it is sought. Heaven feeds on the essence of qi’s radiance, naturally requiring no repayment from the people; what matters is their intent. Yet they do not reflect on the qi of Heaven that gives life and allows them to eat.\n\nAmong the people, those who know better yet fail to repay act as if it were their duty to serve Heaven’s commands. The appointed spirits move among the people, sending forth flying insects to issue decrees, urging farmers to hasten their planting, while the cuckoos call day after day. The people heed their words, and in every household, great or small, all who eat grain exhort one another from dawn to dusk. When the rains come and seeds are sown, Heaven makes them grow tall. Seasonal winds and rains sway their branches and leaves, filling their bodies day by day until they ripen to feed the people. Is this kindness not profound? From year to year, when will it ever end?\n\nYet in return, they show no filial piety, harboring rebellious hearts. What benefit does Heaven gain from nurturing evil people long enough to let them see the food before them? Do they believe Heaven is unaware? Why should it continue to sustain the unfilial and wicked? Thus, Heaven places malevolent spirits to follow them, making their transgressions weightier, their sins grave, and their misfortunes severe, leaving no time for pardon.\n\nWhy do the people persist in such ways, bringing upon themselves a shortened lifespan and the loss of their allotted years? Should they not observe how the filial and good alone attain longevity and descendants? Good and evil must be compared: the short-lived and the long-lived stand in contrast, just as life and death are as distant as paths that never meet. Those who do good and practice filial kindness live out their years, some even gaining extended lifespans, their descendants following in succession without premature death.\n\nIs this not the reward for good and filial conduct? Why then do they commit evil and inflict it upon others? Heaven deeply abhors such acts, swiftly cutting short their lives and bringing misfortune to their descendants—what hope remains for them? Heaven favors the good and rejects the wicked.\n\nOne should ponder the words of this text, for its teachings are complete and sufficient for self-protection, ensuring Heaven’s blessings. Why endure prolonged suffering and self-inflicted sorrow, filling the heart with grief? When sorrowful qi congeals and remains unresolved, day and night are filled with bitter sighs, thoughts consumed by the scattering of wealth and the fear of losing it forever. Illness lingers for years, confining one to bed, beyond the reach of physicians, the knotted qi unbroken. In constant distress, the body grows weak, food intake dwindles, and the grains cannot be digested. The five viscera are unsettled, the spleen fails to grind. This is the state of incompleteness, where breath is short and food will not pass.\n\nThe household watches, knowing recovery is unlikely. Those with wealth may have some savings, but those without see their resources exhausted, their inner and outer lives impoverished, unable to sustain one another. Death arrives, yet no coffin is prepared; they are buried in the earth. Only if they had managed their lives and possessed wealth would they be exhumed. For the impoverished, wealth departs and people scatter—when will they reunite? The family is torn apart, unable to save one another. Thus, they are buried without a coffin, becoming wandering ghosts without a home, with no one to offer them food. As hungry ghosts, they beg endlessly for sustenance. This is the consequence of evil deeds, yet they do not realize they have lost their clan.\n\nAlas, how painful! To die with no one to rely on. Such are those who accumulate misfortune, bringing ruin upon their lineage and leaving no descendants. Heaven grieves deeply for them. Thus, a posthumous child may be left, its gender unknown. Before the child grows, the mother remarries. When the child is older and asks their relatives, “Where are my parents?” they are told, “Your father was young and restless, unable to settle. He followed reckless companions, heedless of his family, became a bandit, and never ceased his crimes. The authorities executed him, and he fled elsewhere. His wealth was exhausted, and he never returned to his hometown. For years, he wandered in distant lands, and his fate remains unknown.”\n\nAll the households suffered from his poisonous deeds, and even distant relatives kept their distance. When your mother was pregnant with you, seeing you would carry on the lineage, she rejoiced in her heart. But the elders of the household had no one to depend on, impoverished and unable to support themselves, they sent her to work. She followed a traveling merchant, with no set date for return.\n\nThe posthumous child laments, “All people are born dependent on their parents, yet I alone have never seen mine.” When older, they ask about their father’s whereabouts. They are told, “Your father did evil, abandoning his parents and wandering far away. His fate is unknown, and no one has heard from him. It is said he is dead, but no one knows where.” The parents, grieving, fell ill and never recovered. They failed to live as proper humans, their wealth exhausted, their inner and outer lives ruined. The fault lies with distant relatives who shared no bond of kindness.\n\nShould one not look to Heaven and weep bitterly, tears soaking their clothes? The father’s evil deeds brought this upon himself, never to return home.",
      "overlap_context": "ecause people do not change, yet the Lord desires they live out their years. Those who refuse to do good bring ruin upon themselves, and what can be done with those who persist in evil? Minor transgressions may be pardoned for the sake of their future, but should they remain unprepared, they will be reminded again.\n\n**Admonition on Great Longevity, Section 200**\nOnly those of resolute intent remain unconfused in heart. Following Heaven’s transformations, they take their guidance where it is due.",

      "translated_text": "The child reproached himself endlessly, finding no relief. At times, he worked as a hired laborer for wealthy households, serving as their servant. Earning several thousand cash a year, his clothing came from this income, with little left to spare. After more than ten years of accumulation, he had enough to return to his hometown. He sought to summon his father’s spirit, weeping day and night, with no one to rely on. How grievous was his pain! His father’s past misdeeds left him without support, his tears flowing like a stream, never drying.\n\nHeaven, in its great sorrow, granted him robust health, allowing him to prosper in his livelihood and take a wife. With children and grandchildren, his heart found slight ease. He then told his son, “Your grandfather did evil, wandering far away and never returning. When travelers passed through, I would ask laborers and diviners about him, but none knew whether he lived or died, nor where his spirit might rest. After years of working to sustain myself, Heaven took pity on my hardship, blessing me with profit. With some savings, I sought a wife to help manage our livelihood, and thus you were born. I lament your grandfather’s misdeeds in his youth, and so I warn you now. From this day forward, you must only do good. Do not follow your grandfather’s path, wandering far away. Reflect on my own faults—it is Heaven’s mercy that I endure. Strive to cultivate virtue, avoid idleness, and order your livelihood. Do not take what belongs to others; let sufficiency be your measure. Care for one another, do not drink recklessly, nor engage in idle gossip or disputes, lest you invite ruin.\n\nPonder deeply your parents’ words, and you will avoid blame. If Heaven hears of your goodness, you may become a virtuous son, attaining a long and fulfilled life. I offer this as a great lesson. Let the gods hear and report it above. Heaven will send benevolent spirits to accompany you, ensuring your livelihood prospers, your wealth grows, and your children thrive in health. Thus, you will have enough—this is Heaven’s grace. At the festivals of spring, autumn, and the year’s end, offer thanks to Heaven. Never cease in your diligence to do good, and you will secure your own fortune. Guard your words and reflect on your actions. The heavenly spirits are ever near; do not speak recklessly. A moment’s carelessness may lead to ruin, while heedlessness may cost you your life. When you receive this warning, reproach yourself, not others—let this lesson be clear.\n\nThose who desire long life must not neglect these admonitions.\n\n**Illness and Heaven’s Judgment, Scroll 201**\n\nAll people dwell in the world, each with their proper path and accomplishments. None should be deprived of their aspirations; let each follow what brings them peace and joy—whether as merchants, farmers, officials, physicians, shamans, or artisans. The Dao allows all to flourish, providing for the people’s needs. This is Heaven’s teaching and transformation; what endeavor will not succeed if it sustains life?\n\nOne must remember to honor Heaven’s will, to extend kindness, and to offer pure and unceasing sacrifices in return for the four seasons’ blessings. This is how one repays Heaven’s grace. Through long practice of virtue, the spirits will favor you, for goodness is its own reward—what could fail to follow? Thus, Heaven ever watches above, judging human deeds. Spirits come and go, knowing all that people do, reporting good and evil without fail. How could there be any oversight?\n\nSome may doubt this, but Heaven reveals its signs through echoes and omens. The timing of wind and rain, swift or delayed, is made known—what room is there for doubt? Actions yield corresponding results, and written records preserve the law without error. How can people remain unaware? How can they indulge their desires and defy Heaven?\n\nHeaven, born of the primordial qi, naturally follows its own decrees. One dare not harbor even the slightest intention of defiance, fearing loss and the people’s suffering. To offend Heaven is to walk heedlessly into the net. Thus, Heaven commands this warning: to attain long life, one must be equal to the virtuous.\n\nHow can one act with such reckless abandon? Spirits follow those who do evil, observing their misdeeds and reporting every transgression, great or small, to Heaven. These are the faults of men—why blame Heaven’s decrees? The warnings are written, yet they are ignored. Only when illness strikes does one panic—how can it be avoided?\n\nTruly, the people’s folly brings no benefit to Heaven, only weariness and distress to the spirits. Physicians and shamans strive to heal, yet those who seek life forget their transgressions. When they committed evil, they gave no thought to repentance—why wait until illness strikes to seek deliverance? By then, death often follows.\n\nFor those who pray and sacrifice to the spirits, minor offenses may be absolved, but grave sins are not forgiven. Instead, they face greater demands: summons to false spirits, prostrations, and desperate pleas for life. Though petitions are submitted repeatedly, death’s verdict is sealed—how can one escape?\n\nPhysicians, shamans, and spirit-mediums, seeking only profit, claim the illness can be cured. They demand rich offerings, fine wine, and meat, invoking mighty spirits to intercede, promising deliverance from death. Yet the ledger of fate is not so easily altered. When wealth is exhausted, life is lost. If after three summons the spirits do not descend and the illness remains, why persist? Misfortune will only compound, and blame will follow.\n\nFalse spirits masquerade as true ones, acting with reckless violence, killing the innocent. Their crimes and grievances ascend to Heaven, where the Heavenly Lord judges them. Those who serve such spirits, even their descendants who seek blessings for the sick, will suffer retribution for their improper invocations.\n\nThose who claim their spirits are true yet teach others to invoke false spirits—how dare they stand before the Heavenly Lord to intercede for others? They only consume the people’s offerings of wine, meat, dates, and cakes. When the sick turn to these false spirit-mediums, those who recover are counted among the not-yet-dead. If their offenses have not yet been recorded above, they may be spared by Heaven’s mercy—but how can these false spirit-mediums claim credit for healing? Do they not boast of curing many?",

      "translated_text": "Those who extort rich offerings from others—when they witness the deeds of false spirits, they summon them to ascend and interrogate their hidden sins. If their hidden sins are many and grave, they will not survive. When those who serve spirits find their spirits no longer come and go, and the people’s condition worsens, their essence and spirit daily diminish—this is the calamity brought by the false spirits themselves. The spirit-mediums, having obtained the remnants of the false spirits’ offerings, use them to feed their households with rich food and fine clothing, believing their prosperity will last. Yet how can they hope to live long when the spirits have already condemned them? Those who receive many hidden offerings from spirits cannot escape retribution; their descendants will perish as well. They invert the truth, claiming, \"You have slain my descendants,\" or even wishing for their own households to vanish entirely.\n\nPeople ought to rectify themselves daily—do not blame Heaven. Yet people of this age are profoundly foolish and shallow. When struck by illness and near death, they do not turn to Heaven in repentance, nor do they confess their transgressions and bow their heads in remorse. Instead, their entire households, young and old, join in pleading for mercy. After days of such supplication, Heaven may pardon them, granting them time to recover. But if they repeat their offenses, their bowing will be of no avail—this is plain to see. Strive to do good, avoid forbidden acts, and you may live out your allotted years. If you refuse to do good, you invite a shortened life; if you choose to become a ghost, you scorn your own existence—what recourse remains?\n\nGuard your words carefully. Those who delight in understanding my teachings should reflect and not act unjustly. When ill, turn to Heaven. This spares expense and prevents great distress, avoiding the panic that drives entire households to flee their homes in terror. What use is fleeing for those already marked for death? Malevolent spirits follow them—can they truly escape? Fools act in such ways, yet how can they claim a place among the not-yet-dead? Do not flee. The house itself does not kill; the household merely declines. With Heaven’s spirits watching above, what fate do they seek? Do they truly not know their own place?\n\nBe cautious in speech. Heaven cherishes life and desires humanity’s survival—when has it ever wished to harm or kill? It establishes prohibitions precisely to prevent transgressions. Yet if you violate them, how can your lifespan extend? Reflect deeply, ponder these words, and cast aside doubt. When the text briefly pauses, resume your contemplation, and repeat what has been taught.\n\n**Section Two Hundred and Two: On the Resolution of Illness Through Heaven’s Reproof and Admonition**\nConsider the people of the world—how utterly foolish and isolated they are. They neglect filial piety and instead commit acts of rebellion. They disregard the great teachings of the scriptures and recklessly debase themselves. Having done no good for others, their evil deeds are frequently heard. Those who dwell in such ways invite disaster; those in the middle face decline; those below suffer illness without respite. This is the consequence of inflicting harm on others, leaving no room for grievances and no thought of bestowing kindness.\n\nDay and night, they oppress and exploit the good, provoking resentment and offering no benevolence in return. Instead, they scheme, entrapping others in guilt, subjecting them to punishment—even death—and severing their ties to their lords. Wealthy households, able to resolve disputes with wine, escape legal trouble without expense, while the penniless, entangled in the law, are summoned by officials. To secure their release, they exhaust their possessions, valuing every item, and pay the ransom. Half is taken by others, leaving just enough to feed their households with fine wine and meat, indulging their desires. They believe their actions will endure, yet others observe and judge them impartially. Their evil deeds will not go unnoticed.\n\nWhen the county magistrate is strict, officials are dispatched to monitor and report their misdeeds. Day and night, these officials watch, eager to expose their wrongdoing. They secretly record the names of the guilty and their accomplices, then deliver sealed reports to the magistrate’s gate, listing the offenders. Corrupt officials, acting as intermediaries, relay their misdeeds, feasting on fine wine and rich meats as they do so. When the magistrate receives the report, he summons the accused in secret, presents evidence, and ensures no false accusations arise. Once guilt is determined, the accused is sent to prison, where they are tortured to confess their hidden crimes. If others testify against them, their punishment is compounded. Even if the offense involves mere money, they do not strive to advance honestly or cultivate profitable livelihoods. Instead, they sell their tongues to entrap others, leading them into guilt—this is pure evil. How can they hope for long life? The high officials despise them, ensuring their demise. Whose fault is this? It stems entirely from the corruption of the wicked.\n\nParents grieve bitterly, and clans suffer torment. Those who act in such ways—what do they hope for? How can they desire long life? They invite punishment yet seek survival—what manner of person are they? Heaven observes from above, declaring its patience exhausted. The text is sent to the bureau of malevolent officials, dispatching officers and evil spirits to assist the county magistrate in punishing the lawless, ensuring they face the death penalty and lose all hope of survival. All this arises from greed for others’ wealth, which they hoard for themselves, sitting idly until their guilt is confirmed and death is certain. No descendants remain to make offerings to their ancestors—this is their own fault.\n\nFrom this point forward, those who come after must heed these warnings and cease their wrongdoing, or they will barely survive. Otherwise, they will surely join the ranks of the dead—there is no doubt. Be cautious, and avoid mutual resentment. A human life cannot be regained. All face the same fate—why not follow the prohibitions?\n\nThe lawless form gangs, banding together to rob others of their wealth, leaving their victims incomplete. Before the county magistrate can execute them, Heaven metes out punishment, annihilating their households and dooming their descendants. They gain wealth yet lose their lives—what part of this is not folly? Thus, these scriptures are frequently revealed to prevent such transgressions. Yet those who persist in their offenses face even greater peril, and many perish as a result. Heaven deeply abhors this.\n\nThose who possess understanding naturally avoid such crimes. Yet the people of this age remain utterly blind. They read the scriptures on longevity but disregard their words, dismissing them as untrustworthy.",

If their offenses have not yet been recorded above, they may be spared by Heaven’s mercy—but how can these false spirit-mediums claim credit for healing? Do they not boast of curing many?",

      "translated_text": "One should not assume that those who attain immortality as divine transcendents do so without first embodying filial piety and goodness—only thus do they achieve boundless longevity. Carefully consider their words: though their expressions may align, let your virtuous deeds manifest while your vices naturally dissipate. The warnings set forth in these scriptures, both preceding and following, aim solely to guide people toward goodness and prevent transgressions—when have they ever led one astray? You ought to reflect deeply, embedding these teachings within your five viscera, so they may be practiced faithfully. Do not defy the will of Heaven. Opposition yields no benefit; it only compounds your faults. Take heed not to harbor resentment—your conduct determines your fate; whom can you blame? Strive to follow goodness, for only thus can one be called human. Cherish your actions, lest you incur the reproach of spirits—do you not understand?\n\nEach must weigh their own choices wisely, lest they pursue wrongdoing and forfeit their lives without recompense. The accumulation of calamities is vast, and the cycle of resentment and hatred knows no end. A guarded heart is essential; empty words serve no purpose. The affairs of this world bring only sorrow and poison to humanity—what use is it to argue, hoping to foster harmony? Those who deem themselves virtuous, seeking to enlighten others, only reveal their own folly when they fail to measure up. Born as humans, they lack discernment, and when questioned, they offer no clarity. Such people are no better than livestock: though they recognize foul odors and fine garments, perform rituals of bowing and rising, they cannot serve as models. Their hearts are ever unruly. When they encounter elderly neighbors, they remain insolent and unmoved; they shut away women, passing judgment on their appearance. These are wicked people with nothing constructive to do—idle and arrogant, they curse and revile, denying the existence of earthly spirits. They incriminate one another, acting as they please without restraint.\n\nThey give no thought to the impending disasters, nor can they aid one another in time. Even when rescue comes, it arrives too late—what good does it do? Their meddling only breeds further chaos, yet the truth remains visible. How can they justify themselves or absolve their debts? Condemned by the multitude, their misdeeds persist until their households are ruined, their descendants lost, and their longevity forfeit. Pitiful are such actions—how can they endure? The *Scriptures of Great Peace* decree that those below must submit to those above to attain lasting stability. Failure to do so invites ruin and invites ungovernable chaos. The people of this age grow ever more callous, bereft of righteousness and principle. They indulge their immediate desires, heedless of their own lives. Reckless and unrestrained, they deny the existence of spirits, and those who neglect these teachings are many. Every action bears consequences, and the Hall of Light records all, scrutinizing past and present, submitting names to the authorities. When transgressions and debts are reported, the officials notify the Bureau of Grand Yin, whose agents summon the ancestors of the offender to be interrogated and punished. Commanded to return home, they utter curses and confess their wrongdoings, their misdeeds unceasing, thus afflicting the living with illness.\n\nThe afflicted household must perform rites to resolve the yin retribution and lift the heavenly reprimand, halting the misfortune. If the reprimand is not resolved, the illness persists, and the offender is held accountable anew. Once the reprimand remains unaddressed, they dismiss it as falsehood, yet their actions betray them—whether many or few, the consequences are clear. Thus, one must exercise caution henceforth, lest their faults multiply. Only through understanding can one avoid blame. Ignorance perpetuates the cycle between suffering and fortune without respite. Heed the words of these scriptures; do not incur debts against one another. It is difficult to keep records, and the spirits do not rest. They perceive human intentions, yet people persist in wrongdoing—this is the root of evil. Goodness begets goodness, while wickedness foreshortens life. Why harbor resentment? Your fate is of your own making. Submit to those above, and you will have no wicked children—do you not understand?\n\nBeware, beware—let this bring a brief respite. The scriptures are difficult to compose, their laws expansive; the key is to avoid transgression. Some passages may be slightly obscure, with minor inconsistencies. Reflect deeply on what follows, and let understanding guide you—take heed, take heed. Small matters lead to great consequences, and the text reiterates this, hence the brief pause. Further explanations will follow.\n\n**Chapter Two Hundred and Three: The Unyielding Covenant of Parents**\n\nOnly those who cultivate goodness naturally avoid transgressing the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, the four seasons, the five phases, the sun, moon, stars, and all spirits. Fearing the consequences of violation, they record their names above, thus resolving to practice goodness and filial devotion. The celestial prohibitions exist not to restrict the people but to ensure their flourishing—when would they wish for concealment? They provide for the sustenance of all living things—when would they desire mutual harm? It is humanity that violates these principles.\n\nThus, the virtuous refrain from wicked speech. Each teaching is clearly articulated, its warnings and outcomes plainly evident: goodness leads to life, while evil hastens death. What quarrel is there with the people? Therefore, the texts of the virtuous are presented to instruct the living, revealing the origins of fortune and misfortune, expounding the precepts to prevent transgressions. Those who practice goodness are free from wicked words. Heaven recognizes their virtue, dispatching spirits to accompany them, altering their life registers, and inscribing their names among the long-lived. Their merit is thus fulfilled, inspiring future generations to emulate their goodness. On days when the Celestial King governs, they face no taboos below. The remaining years of their ancestors are added to their own, granting them a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years. Their descendants inherit this benevolence, free from minor faults, and likewise enjoy longevity, their white hair succeeding one another. Generation after generation, their households prosper, their members complete. Whether tilling the land, engaging in trade, or serving as officials, they reap benefits. Promotions come frequently, free from the threat of punishment—such is the reward of goodness.\n\nYet people fail to emulate them, instead mocking their ways. The hearts of the virtuous remain steadfast in goodness, benefiting others. When they encounter those in distress, they lend aid without demanding repayment or interest. Those who receive their kindness will not betray them. Even a small repayment—offered with wine and meat in gratitude—fosters mutual goodwill.",

      "translated_text": "Heaven observes their conduct and further favors them, ensuring that in all their goings and outgoings, none dare offend them. Those who practice goodness—Heaven itself assists them, preventing them from encountering misfortune, for such is the outcome of their deeds.\n\nAs for those who do evil yet hope to attain longevity and descendants, this is a failure to discern. Thus, Heaven distinguishes their lifespans: those who can perform the deeds of Heaven, aligning their hearts and wills with the Dao, may attain transcendence, be recorded among the worthy and sagely, and have their spirits augmented—how limitless their years shall be! Therefore, it is said that goodness must not be neglected, for it is beyond what most can achieve. Thus, Heaven cherishes those who are good and does not wish them to harbor evil.\n\nThe good and the wicked each have their allotted place—how could they be equated? The words of Heaven’s scriptures are clear: the good are rewarded with goodness, while the wicked are warned, lest they fall into peril and forfeit their years. This is Heaven’s way: it extends the lives of the good and reduces the wicked to less than human—this is plain to see, so why doubt it?\n\nFrom birth to old age, a person naturally begets children and grandchildren, raising them to maturity and fulfillment. One should follow their inclinations, ensuring their contentment, never opposing their wishes, so each may find their proper place and fulfill their desires. To be a parent is no easy task, and children, in turn, must be filial, heeding their parents’ teachings. Thus, the bones, flesh, and limbs of the good remain whole, and what parents have begotten should be kept intact, free from harm or injury.\n\nWhat parents have given, one must not dare to repay with words; rather, when there is goodness, it should be advanced. If the household lacks wealth, one should be reverent, gentle, and tender, frequently inquiring after their well-being to know their safety—this is the highest form of goodness. Neighbors and close kin should all be treated with love and emulation, perfecting the practice of goodness.\n\nWhen encountering violent and wicked people, one must not dare to engage them in speech, lest conflict arise. Once conflict arises, the good person’s virtue is lost, and Heaven, too, comes to detest them. Thus, all must value and guard themselves, lest their descendants suffer. Beware of transgressing prohibitions, lest the household be unsettled—not only unsettled, but affecting kin both near and far. Disturbances within and without may lead to encounters with officials, the loss of property, and ruin.\n\nTherefore, one must be cautious and not violate the words of the scriptures. Those who can foster harmony and peace, without duplicity, each attending to their own duties and accomplishing their tasks—such are the deeds of the truly good. Heaven will surely grant them long life, and spirits and gods will protect them, never failing in their care. The offerings made in the four seasons follow their proper order, and in the marketplace, they select the finest goods without haggling over prices.\n\nThe reason for this is that all offerings possess spirit; they ascend and descend in accord with their due, and even slight impurities will be recorded in writing, never overlooked. Thus, one must follow the path of commerce with reverence, and the divine spirits will surely rejoice. They report to the Registrar of Destinies, and the officials of the ancestral shrines proceed in peace. If one personally ensures the purity of the incense, the offerings are accepted, and after the meal, the Five Ancestors are greatly venerated. Then, the food is consumed in its proper place, and all partake with joy.\n\nThe household prospers, and the children and grandchildren are all good, without a single wicked child. The commanderies and counties hear of this and summon them to serve as officials of rank, promoting them to the prefecture, where they are assigned prominent positions. The province, too, learns of them and summons them to serve in close proximity, recommending them for their integrity and outstanding talent—such is the result of goodness. Their conduct brings its own reward, and their position is assured. This is also the workings of fate and the allotment of destiny, a clear sign of their virtue, so that evil does not pass their door.\n\nAll the gods in Heaven declare that such conduct is especially good—only the will of Heaven remains unknown. Thus, the good texts record the deeds of the good on bamboo and silk, so that later generations may be inspired to advance, perpetuating the goodness of the household for generations. Their descendants never leave the court, beloved by emperors and kings, ever holding virtuous offices—such merit arises naturally, all from the blessings they have earned.\n\nTherefore, those who practice goodness should take this scripture as their model, for its words are trustworthy and not empty. **Above: Heaven’s discourse on filial piety to quell rebellion, repel the barbarians, and bring the world into compliance and ease of governance.**\n\n*This concludes the one hundred fourteenth scroll of the* Scripture of Great Peace.\n\n*(According to the Dunhuang manuscript* Catalogue of the Scripture of Great Peace*, this chapter should be titled* “The Secret of Filial Conduct Revered by the Divine.”*)*\n\n**Scroll One Hundred Sixteen of the** *Scripture of Great Peace*\n**A Certain Secret, Number Two Hundred Four**",

      "translated_text": "(Previous text lost)\n\nTheir qi converges, aligning with the emperor’s affairs—shared joy, shared heart, shared direction, shared course, shared pivot, shared root, shared intent. Thus the sages of old established the laws, assigning the emperor to the east in spring, the south in summer, the west in autumn, and the north in winter, to act in concert with Heaven’s qi. When qi is aligned, they meet in harmony. This is what is meant by carefully following the Dao of Heaven, sharing Heaven’s qi—thus they respond in accord and find joy. The harmony spoken of by the ruler is this mutual joy. When there is mutual joy, Heaven and Earth remain ever pleased, without strife or anger. Without strife or anger, disasters, harms, treacheries, and all malign forces vanish entirely. Once malign people are gone, the qi of peace arrives. The qi of peace from Heaven descends to govern below, while the qi of peace from Earth ascends to assist above.\n\nIf one does not follow this joy, using the qi that the August Heaven and Earth favor, but instead employs abandoned qi, all will fall into disorder and opposition—opposing the Dao of Heaven and Earth, opposing the emperor’s qi, acting contrary to the intent of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth will rage in conflict, myriad changes arise together, treachery and malice flourish daily, leading to unrest and disorder, and the qi of inauspicious years will come. Thus one must deeply understand this.\n\nExcellent, excellent! This foolish student has heard the command. Is it not clear? Heaven delights in this—O Perfected One, be vigilant.\n\nIndeed, indeed. I shall carefully record it and dare not forget.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Since the Heavenly Illuminated Master has no choice but to elaborate, I wish to hear how spring, summer, autumn, and winter each follow their qi according to their proper measures.\n\nOnly the sixth month differs: on the summer solstice, the *gong* tone is activated, and throughout the fifth and sixth months, it is purely the *gong* tone. Moreover, in music, one raises the voice in song and dance. The qi of kingship should be stirred—stirring reveals joy, and mutual compliance reveals mutual assistance. The qi of rest, imprisonment, and death all desire stillness and do not wish to be stirred. If stirred, they become displeased, then enraged, and from rage arise malign forces, treachery, disasters, and harms. This is the natural disposition of Heaven and Earth, not erring even once.\n\nWhich qi should be stirred? I wish to hear this as a model and dare not oppose a single qi.\n\nOne should first stir the emperor’s qi, then the king’s qi, then the minister’s qi, then the observer’s qi, and finally the subtle qi. These qi all lie before the Celestial Dipper, advancing daily to offer assistance and flourishing—thus they are stirred. The remaining qi lie behind the Celestial Dipper, where Heaven’s qi turns away, and their qi wanes daily. Thus they should not be stirred, for to do so would oppose Heaven and rebel against Earth, failing to align with the heart of Heaven and Earth—hence, it is inauspicious. Therefore, what Heaven faces is flourished, and what Heaven turns from is abandoned. This is how to know the seasons and qi, and from this, good and ill fortune, safety and peril may be discerned.\n\nMay I ask: if only the king’s tone is stirred, and the five tones are incomplete, how can a proper song and dance be formed?\n\nExcellent, your question! The reason is simply that when the regulators of yin and yang are first stirred, movement produces sound. Thus, when music moves, it always accompanies sound. Yang has sound—hence the first *gong*, third *zhi*, fifth *yu*, seventh *shang*, and ninth *jiao*—while the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth are not named as tones. Punishment belongs to great yin, which acts without sound, thus subtly harming people. \"Acting without sound\" refers to this.\n\nThen why does the military commander have sound?\n\nExcellent question!

      "translated_text": "Truly so—now even the slightly foolish student has awakened.\n\nThus, the sages of antiquity, when preparing to follow the Way of music, bore it on their left; when preparing to follow the Way of punishment, bore it on their right. Auspicious affairs honor the left; inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left belongs to yang; the right belongs to yin—each follows its own kind.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nTherefore, in my affairs of culture, I follow Heaven in intent and Earth in principle. Those who comply find fortune and prosperity; those who resist meet misfortune. If one’s intent differs from Heaven’s, what can one hope for?\n\nThus, Heaven possesses three qi: the upper qi is called *music*, the middle qi is called *harmony*, and the lower qi is called *punishment*. Music belongs to yang; punishment belongs to yin; harmony belongs to the center.\n\nTherefore, the southeast—yang and music—loves life; the northwest—yin and rage—loves killing. The qi of harmony follows, coming and going, now hidden, now revealed, to avoid harm. Thus, music should only accompany auspicious affairs and matters of life; it must not be used for inauspicious affairs or matters of death. This is the celestial pattern and law—it cannot be reversed.\n\nPerfected One, heed my words with care.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nNow, why do you speak of sound only in terms of the first *jia* day, without explaining it fully? How can one come to know all its applications?\n\nIt is proper to collate and compare the writings of all sages and worthies, each drawing from their own school, so that entry and exit, high and low, great and small, all correspond. Use one to illuminate ten, ten to illuminate a hundred, a hundred to illuminate a thousand, a thousand to illuminate ten thousand, ten thousand to illuminate the boundless. When all worthies deliberate together, nothing remains ungrasped. Thus, I merely present the beginning to you and do not exhaust every detail.\n\nThe superior person, upon seeing my text, will naturally grasp its full meaning. The middling person, upon seeing it, may yet ascend to understanding. The petty person, upon seeing it, may take it as a model and act accordingly. Without violating the prohibitions of Heaven and Earth, each may cultivate good intent on their own. To explain everything fully would only overwhelm with words, losing the guiding principles and leaving the text disordered and difficult to govern. Therefore, one should only reveal the beginning and allow them to ponder it themselves.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nGo now—my discourse on this minor matter is complete. If you have further doubts, return again.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask: when sounds are harmonious, can one know whether their intent is attained or not?\n\nOne can indeed know.\n\nThe qi of emperors and kings is determined by celestial numbers. When the qi of an emperor or king prevails, the resonance of their commands and proclamations issues forth first. This is like an emperor or king first issuing decrees to the world—all people and things follow accordingly, and the world attains peace. Those who dare disobey are rebels and will perish. Thus, when the qi of an emperor or king is first emitted, all else follows.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nIf, however, the qi of an emperor or king is not emitted first, and instead the qi of *rest* or *imprisonment* is activated prematurely, forcing the qi of the emperor or king to follow, this is a grave act of rebellion. Such is the pattern and law of Heaven and Earth—it cannot be forced.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMoreover, the five tones each have their own correspondences: some draw upon Heaven, some upon Earth, some upon the sun, moon, and stars, some upon the four seasons and five phases, some upon mountains and rivers, and some upon the people and the myriad things. When a tone moves, all that it governs is stirred, each yielding its own effects. Thus, when harmony aligns with its intent, good is produced; when it does not, evil arises.\n\nWhen tones are activated, the spirits of all things first come to pay homage, and only afterward do their forms respond. Therefore, when activating musical tones, one must always understand the matter at hand, carefully attaining its intent. Then, great peace may be achieved, and baleful qi dispelled. Perfected One, consider this well.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask: how does musical tone draw forth its correspondences?\n\nExcellent—your question strikes at the essential meaning!\n\nConsider spring, which moves first: when the great *jiao* string stirs on a *jia* day, above it draws forth Jupiter and the Heart Star, while below it draws forth the Eastern Marchmount. Its qi sways lesser yang; its tone sways the phase of wood; its spirit sways Gou Mang; its creature stirs the Azure Dragon; its position draws forth the Green Emperor; its spirits summon the green-robed jade maidens. From the highest heavens to the deepest earth, all come to pay homage in kind, delighting in its musical sound.\n\nSpeaking of one is to seek its kind—there is no end to it. If you refine and search for its essential meaning, you will grasp it all. Align it with ordinary texts and writings to form a model. Thus, when music attains its highest intent, one may transcend the world; when it attains its middle intent, one may bring about peace and dispel misfortune; when it attains its lower intent, one may bring joy to the people.\n\nAttaining its highest intent brings joy to the spirits; attaining its middle intent brings joy to the essences; attaining its lower intent brings joy to the body. When all intents are attained, emperors and kings may wander without care, music arises and punishment ceases, and spirits and essences are sated.\n\nI wish to hear the secret of how music arises and punishment ceases.\n\nExcellent, your words are apt!\n\nMusic is the essence of great yang; punishment is the essence of great yin. When yang flourishes, yin submits; when yin flourishes, yang submits. Thus, when music flourishes, punishment vanishes.\n\nWhy is music yang? And punishment?\n\nWhen tones are harmonious, their direction is harmonious and good; when tones are disharmonious, their direction is inauspicious and evil. At such times, listen carefully to the tones. Those who understand sound know all matters of fortune and misfortune; those who do not understand sound cannot know them.\n\nSound is the speech of music. Whether divining near or far, all must be aligned: the day, the hour, the surname, the written characters, the boundaries, the phases of prosperity, decline, rest, and decay—all are taken together to form the discourse. Those who listen with precision will not err.\n\nExcellent, excellent!\n\nMay I ask how to use music to dispel disasters, treachery, and inauspicious evil, following the patterns and numbers of Heaven and Earth?",
      "overlap_context": "named as tones.

Only when rage erupts and harm is imminent does sound arise from within, and they no longer communicate with words.\n\nDo you understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "When the Emperor should rise early or late to move his musical instruments and begin the chant, thereby dispelling the qi of sorrow and suffering to bring about Great Peace—excellent indeed! How skillfully you ask about the method.\n\nFor long has High Heaven been afflicted by disasters, pitying the Emperor’s sorrow and suffering. It has sent a Perfected One to preside over this inquiry—what doubts remain?\n\nVery well, very well. Be seated. I dare not conceal anything, for to hide the truth would invite Heaven’s censure, subjecting me to prolonged and heavy punishment, to no benefit for my celestial years. Be seated and listen carefully, as I shall distinguish and explain its essential meaning for you.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is like a cycle, ever revolving and returning to its beginning. When music arises, it must always accord with the timely ascendance of the ruling qi. Establish the resonance where the Dipper’s handle points, and let the sound respond to that direction. Stir the tones and voices—whether led by a person’s chant or each following its own pitch.\n\nThe numbers derive from the Six Jia and the Five Phases; the Five and Six Jia and Five Phases are the very numbers of Heaven and Earth. The seasonal qi is what Heaven and Earth respond to and act upon. For example, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, when the Dipper points to *yin*, it is called the time of the Supreme Thearch—first strike the Great Horn. At the midpoint of the month, when it aligns with *jia*; in the second month, when the Dipper points to *mao*, and at the midpoint with *yi*; in the third month, when it points to *chen*. Proceed accordingly, adjusting for the earliness or lateness of the seasonal qi to determine the measurements.\n\nFirst move the Emperor’s tone and Emperor’s strings, then the King’s tone and King’s strings, then the Minister’s tone and Minister’s strings, then the Candidate’s tone and Candidate’s strings, then the Standard’s tone and Standard’s strings, each in their proper sequence. This is called receiving Heaven’s teaching and following Earth’s qi. If Heaven and Earth themselves delight in and employ it, how much more so should humans?\n\nHumans are the most honored of all beings, the children of Heaven. When people reverently and respectfully employ these numbers, Heaven delights in them; when they carefully and obediently employ them, Earth delights in them. This is like a filial child following the teachings of father and mother—how could parents not love and favor them?\n\nNow Heaven has sent you to ask these matters. As I serve as Heaven’s interlocutor, expounding the regulations for Great Peace above, I dare not omit anything. I fear the punishment of Heaven and Earth and dare not deceive the Perfected Ones or conceal anything. Only when not asked do I remain silent; when asked, I speak without reserve. Observing the Perfected One’s inquiry, I perceive that Heaven desires to speak, and so I explain fully for you.\n\nIf you, Perfected One, obtain this Dao, ponder its meaning deeply and transmit it to later generations, enabling them to emulate it and thereby eliminate all manner of disasters. Above, this will pacify the qi of Heaven and Earth; below, it will assist the Emperor in governance. It will settle the hearts of all people, preventing them from straying into wickedness, and allow the twelve thousand things each to find their proper place—how joyous this would be!\n\nGreat indeed, great indeed! The Perfected Ones may truly be said to understand.\n\nMay I ask about the affairs of the Six Caverns and Eight Directions: which are most auspicious and good, and which are most inauspicious and evil?\n\nExcellent, your inquiry. Now listen carefully, as I explain its meaning. That which is mutually accordant and joyful is good and auspicious; that which is mutually opposed and sorrowful is inauspicious and evil. Mutual accord and joy produce good sounds; mutual opposition and sorrow produce inauspicious sounds.\n\nThus, music is joy in itself. Mutual accord and joy are good music; auspicious affairs alone may be accompanied by music. Inauspicious and evil affairs must not have music—if music is present, it is called \"joy,\" yet misfortune will only multiply.\n\nTherefore, when the qi of the Emperor, the King, or the Minister is ascendant, all reside before the Celestial Dipper—this is auspicious. What Heaven and Earth delight in, they wish to arise; what they share, they employ together. Thus, one should delight in, follow, and prosper it. The qi of rest and decline is what Heaven and Earth jointly abandon and weaken; thus, it should be abandoned, and music should not be performed. To perform music is to go against the will of Heaven and Earth, constituting great rebellion and discord with the seasonal qi.\n\nThe seasonal qi is the proper qi of Heaven’s seasons. Heaven and Earth take this as their standard: the qi of ascendance and prosperity governs Great Peace, while the qi of decline and extinction establishes inauspicious years. The qi of ascendance and prosperity generates abundance and many good affairs. Thus, in years of Great Peace, all things flourish, and good things abound—this is clear evidence, the great effect of Heaven and Earth. The manifestations of Heaven and Earth’s delight in goodness extend to the people and the myriad things; this is the great evidence and verification.\n\nThus, the sages and worthies of antiquity deeply examined and correlated these signs to know the success or failure of their conduct. They clearly understood that like kinds, like affairs, and like qi correlate with one another. When one obtains the image of a like qi or kind, one reforms one’s nature and changes one’s conduct, daring not to act wrongly. The language of Heaven and Earth is revealed through these effects, not through direct speech with people. By observing the images and kinds obtained, one may know for oneself.\n\nThe qi of imprisonment, decline, death, and extinction generate little and accomplish no good affairs. Thus, in inauspicious years, little is produced, no good omens appear, and no good things arise—this is the correlation of like affairs and like qi.\n\nTherefore, those who would bring about Great Peace must perform music in full, for music accords with and delights in the ascendant qi, and the balanced qi arrives. But in inauspicious years, music must not be performed, nor may it be performed without cause. The qi of imprisonment and decline opposes Heaven and Earth; thus, in inauspicious years and affairs, music must not be performed.\n\nThe qi of ascendance and prosperity is where virtue resides; the qi of imprisonment and decline is where punishment resides. Thus, a virtuous ruler who cherishes life is enabled by Heaven to perform music, while a ruler without virtue may not—this is the clear evidence of Heaven.\n\nDo you, Perfected One, understand?\n\nIndeed, indeed! Today, having fully inquired of the Illuminated Master of Heaven, I now fully comprehend the meaning of Heaven’s music. Before asking, I thought music a trivial matter, something anyone could perform at any time. Now, having asked, I shall never again act carelessly.\n\nExcellent! You, who understand matters, may truly be said to grasp the principles of texts and to have long attained Heaven’s intent.",

      "translated_text": "When the Great Peace arrives, all baleful qi departs.\n\nWith reverence, I humbly inquire again concerning the doubts in my heart. Speak plainly and without reservation.\n\nIndeed, indeed!\n\nNow, the qi of Heaven and Earth is half in ascendance and half in repose, like the unceasing alternation of day and night. How then could music be performed all day long? Should it be played only in the direction of ascendant qi, when the qi of kingship prevails? Yet when music begins, it is because the Son of Heaven initiates it—not because the qi of repose does. The same holds for the year, the month, the day, and the hour.\n\nThough this humble one has yet to grasp the full meaning, if one wishes to perform music for the year, it should be done in the east at *mao*, in the second month of spring. If for the month, it should correspond to that month; for the day, to the day of ascendant qi; for the hour, to the hour of ascendant qi. Only thus may one be said to accord with the Dao of Heaven, and baleful qi will depart. To act otherwise is to disrupt the celestial order and invite calamity.\n\nThus, the sage-kings of antiquity, deeply understanding the intent of Heaven and Earth, dared not perform music during inauspicious affairs. When inauspicious affairs are met with music, those ills multiply daily, growing beyond remedy—hence, music must not be performed then.\n\nHeaven endows each being with its own spirit.

      "translated_text": "The perfected one who wishes to know its great efficacy may compare it to the Dao of Heaven. All that is pure and serene delights in returning to Heaven; all that is heavy and turbid delights in returning to Earth—each follows its own abode, and none can be faulted for this. Thus, delighting in goodness brings goodness; delighting in inauspiciousness brings inauspiciousness, just as water flows downward and fire rises upward, not erring by even a fraction. The perfected one entrusts this text to a ruler of virtue to show to ordinary people. Now that the qi of Great Peace has arrived and Heaven promotes goodness, all are made to delight in goodness, and none may again take pleasure in inauspicious affairs without cause. Those who delight in inauspicious affairs make themselves enemies of Heaven and bring blame upon Earth—their transgressions cannot be erased. Today, those in Heaven name such people who delight in inauspicious affairs as great rebels. The baleful qi of Heaven and all the blames within Earth will descend and converge upon them.\n\nShould an urgent matter arise suddenly and one must perform music for an auspicious affair, yet there is no time to await the ascendant qi of the proper region or the hour of the Dipper’s culmination, what then is to be done? Excellent indeed is your question, for it grasps the essential meaning. In such a case, have the musicians reside in the region of ascendant qi. If they cannot reside there, let the musicians and the assembled people all face the ascendant direction and make their request. They should employ the same tones and the same numerical correspondences. Even if only the person’s surname and given name are used, holding the pitch pipes and calendrical calculations, so long as the tones and qi resonate in accord, one may follow the time of ascendant qi and have them perform the music—this too is permissible. In this way, all acts in accordance with the teachings and commands of Heaven and Earth, and no disasters will arise. To act otherwise is to align with the qi of baleful prisoners, and all manner of inauspicious affairs will arise.\n\nMoreover, when raising voices in song or leading music, one must also employ the auspicious—auspicious tones and good affairs. The qi of ascendant and prosperous phases is like a ruler among men; it does not wish to hear of inauspicious affairs, inauspicious words, or inauspicious tones. The reason is this: the qi of ascendant and prosperous phases serves as the agent of August Heaven, presiding over generation and completing good affairs, thereby aiding Heaven in the generation and completion of all things. Evil tones and inauspicious affairs do not aid Heaven in the generation and completion of all things. Thus, the qi of ascendance does not wish to delight in hearing them, nor does the qi preceding the Dipper’s culmination. Therefore, the sage-king emperors of antiquity all accumulated good words and good deeds, never admitting inauspicious and evil affairs. Such words were called \"ominous speech,\" and the crime was punishable by death. Even if the crime did not warrant death, they were killed simply for the ominousness of their inauspicious speech. Does the perfected one understand the severity of this prohibition?\n\nIndeed, indeed.",
      "overlap_context": "f antiquity, deeply understanding the intent of Heaven and Earth, dared not perform music during inauspicious affairs. When inauspicious affairs are met with music, those ills multiply daily, growing beyond remedy—hence, music must not be performed then.\n\nHeaven endows each being with its own spirit. When music is good, good spirits arrive; when music is evil, evil spirits arrive—this is the natural disposition, nothing strange. Only the foolish fail to ponder this deeply.\n\nExcellent!

      "translated_text": "Ah, how solemn! Ah, how solemn!\n\nTo know early and be alarmed ensures long preservation; not to know is the root of death. Let me expound:\n\nFirst, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ imperial qi, and by amplifying the joy directed toward Heaven threefold, Heaven is greatly pleased. The imperial ruler enjoys longevity, evil and misfortune are extinguished, celestial disasters and harms are all dispelled, and the qi of the Great Yang does not contend in anger, bringing peace to the realm. Those who know to first move in alignment with and delight in this are supported by the Dao of Heaven, and true spirits emerge. Even those dwelling in hidden caves come forth with joy to aid the upright—how wondrous!\n\nSecond, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of Heaven and Earth and the four seasons’ royal qi, and by doubling the joy directed toward Earth, Earth’s qi is greatly pleased and does not contend in anger. This grants the ruler longevity, dissolves treachery, theft, and warfare, and brings prosperity to the realm. Those below all delight in submitting to their superiors, and the worthy emerge to assist in governance. Earth spirits align in nurturance—how wondrous!\n\nThird, by first aligning with and delighting in the qi of ministerial and subtle qi, the qi of harmony and balance is greatly pleased. Ruler and ministers, the people all act with reverence, each preserving their place. Thus, flattery, deceit, theft, and banditry do not arise, and the borders are secure. As harmonious qi daily flourishes, royal qi is born, and all things incline toward goodness.\n\nFourth, be cautious never to move or delight in the qi of death and destruction, for it brings severe banditry and many sudden deaths. The realm remains in constant peril, unable to find peace, and malevolent qi and spectral beings proliferate, causing grave harm. When extreme, this is called chaos and disturbance. The qi of utmost yin induces rebellion and inversion—beware, beware!\n\nFifth, do not move or delight in the qi of imprisonment and decline, for it brings much banditry, incarceration, litigation, and a flurry of punishments. Peace becomes difficult, the people harm one another, and chronic illnesses multiply.\n\nSixth, do not move or delight in the qi of decline and cessation, for it brings many ailing and infirm people. It also breeds cunning and deceitful individuals who cheat one another, fosters much slander and strife, depletes the realm’s wealth, and leaves the people impoverished.\n\nDelight in the three upper divisions—imperial, royal, ministerial, and subtle qi—and Heaven, Earth, and humanity are pleased. Timely rains and disasters are dispelled, for this is called aligning with the good qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, thereby bringing forth good affairs. To delight in the three lower divisions—the qi of death, destruction, imprisonment, decline, and cessation—is to invite rebellion and disaster. Heaven’s seasons bring perverse harms in great multitude, which cannot be restrained or prevented.\n\nIf these debased qi are stirred and delighted in, malevolent qi is greatly unleashed. The wise and learned withdraw into hiding, the magistrates lose governance, the people and ministers become difficult to rule, and affairs multiply in chaos. One cannot but guard against and be cautious of this!\n\nAll matters under Heaven and Earth have their fixed and constant laws. Where qi resides, one should face the honored and desire to express joy; where qi is absent, in decline or death, joy is inappropriate. Thus, to delight in goodness is called \"aligning with governance\" in Heaven; to delight in evil is called \"rebelling against decree.\" Those who align with governance gain Heaven’s power; those who rebel against decree gain Heaven’s harm. Those who gain Heaven’s power attain longevity; those who gain Heaven’s harm incur misfortune and calamity.\n\nThe reason is this: Heaven’s governance is like an echo and shadow—it does not wrest away what brings people peace. To delight in goodness is to receive goodness; to delight in evil is to receive evil. What more need be said? Good and evil, safety and peril each follow their kind and do not err—only the foolish fail to consider this.\n\nThus, those who delight in the Dao attract the Dao; those who delight in virtue attract virtue; those who delight in martial prowess attract martial prowess; those who delight in uprightness attract uprightness; those who delight in perversity attract perversity. How could it be otherwise?\n\nTherefore, I have deeply pondered Heaven’s laws to admonish the perfected one. How solemn! Heaven’s laws must not be transgressed. Thus, I earnestly exhort you. Indeed, indeed.\n\nThe reason for amplifying the joy directed toward imperial qi threefold when delighting in the worthy is that imperial qi is most honored and supreme, symbolizing Heaven’s supremacy, hence the tripled joy. Heaven governs and commands Earth and humanity, thus the threefold amplification, symbolizing Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\n\nWhen Heaven, Earth, and humanity are seen to delight in and bring order, all things each attain their proper place. Auspicious signs and good omens—twelve thousand in number—all emerge in full. Thus, one first delights in them.\n\nWhen delighting in them, one should listen attentively with single-minded focus, sit upright in prolonged contemplation, and feel joy and gladness in the heart, utterly content. Be loyal, sincere, and utterly without ill intent, as if sitting before the imperial ruler, daring not to be perverse. Heaven responds to such conduct, and evil, misfortune, and disasters all depart. By honoring Heaven as supreme and imperial qi as authority, Heaven naturally follows the law, and the attainment of Great Peace is not difficult.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe reason for doubling the joy directed toward royal qi when delighting in its harmony is that royal qi symbolizes Earth, and Earth dwells alongside humanity, hence the doubled joy to delight in Earth. When Earth and humanity are seen to delight and rejoice, all things are ordered and attain their proper state. Moreover, Earth is humble, thus its joy is less than Heaven’s.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nFurthermore, royal qi is weaker than imperial qi, humbler by one degree, hence the reduction. The law of precedence between honor and humility is naturally apportioned.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe reason for delighting in ministerial and subtle qi in a single measure is that ministerial and subtle qi symbolize harmony and humanity. Harmonious humanity is humbler than Heaven and Earth, hence its joy is less. Humanity governs and orders all things for Heaven and Earth. When humanity delights, it rejoices in goodness; by doing good, all things are ordered. When humanity does not delight, it does evil; by doing evil, all things meet with misfortune.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMoreover, humanity is the chief of all harmonious things. When the chief delights in order, all things are ordered; when the chief is in chaos, all things are in chaos. Thus, one first delights in the chief to align with and delight in the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nTherefore, the qi of supreme goodness is most honored and good, hence the tripled joy to delight in goodness. Thus, the ancient imperial rulers who governed well and aligned with Heaven’s will gained this multiplied joy—clear evidence of this.",

      "translated_text": "Now the qi of Great Peace arrives, thus teaching the flourishing of joy. When the qi of decline and chaos responds to inauspicious years, joy cannot flourish; if one forces joy to flourish, it is called \"flourishing joy amidst misfortune and decay\"—in Heaven’s reckoning, this is named \"great rebellion.\" Is not the root of disasters and the origin of calamities something to be guarded against with utmost care?\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nTherefore, the next in rank is the kingly qi, whose joy is doubled, yet it does not match the imperial qi, hence its joy is lesser. Thus, those whose governance is only slightly good find their joy diminished. The reason for this diminution is that their qi is weak and not supremely good, so they dare not indulge in excessive joy. Amidst this, inauspicious qi lingers, so they dare not fully express their joy. It is like a household with seven virtues and three vices—though the heart may incline toward joy, this is the meaning of such restraint.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nConsider this: with seven virtues and three vices, where goodness outweighs evil, can one rest in ease and cease rejoicing? Though the human heart may delight, it occasionally recalls the three vices, preventing pure, unalloyed joy—this is the nature of Heaven. Only when virtue is complete, with not a single worry remaining, does great joy arise. Thus, joy is for delighting in goodness, not for delighting in misfortune.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMy words are the luminous contract of Heaven, not erring in the slightest. Therefore, the next in rank is the single joy of the ministerial qi and the subtle qi, which governs minor stability. Human virtue is at its least here, not matching the qi of Heaven and Earth. Thus, it is faint and slight, not equaling Heaven and Earth, and so its joy is diminished. The ministerial qi and subtle qi bring minor transformations, governing the central lands where evil often outweighs goodness, so they dare not fully express their joy. To do so would be called \"rejoicing in misfortune and evil.\" Since goodness is scant, their joy is scant as well. The reason for this scantiness is that they only rejoice in the goodness within, not daring to rejoice in the misfortune and evil within. To rejoice in the misfortune and evil within is like a petty person with seven vices and three virtues—can the three virtues alone secure threefold joy? With seven vices, there are instead sevenfold sorrows and afflictions. How can one rest in joy?\n\nThe reason for this lies in the principle of tenfold division: ten is divided thrice. The imperial qi is entirely good in all ten parts; the kingly qi has two parts good and one part evil; the ministerial qi has two parts evil and one part good. Thus, the imperial qi mirrors Heaven, which constantly delights in life, harbors no harmful intent, and desires to bestow blessings. The Three Sovereigns emulated this, ever purely good and kind, without evil or harmful intent. Heaven resembles the Three Sovereigns, and the Three Sovereigns resemble Heaven. Thus, the supremely good person has not a single vice, only ever desiring to do good. Does this not mirror Heaven? Does it not mirror the true spirit?\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe kingly qi mirrors Earth, which constantly nurtures and favors virtue. The Five Emperors emulated this. Though Earth’s nurturing is called \"killing,\" the Five Emperors still employed punishments.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nThe ministerial qi and subtle qi mirror humanity, which has no constant law and frequently changes. The Three Kings emulated this, having no fixed principles. For harmonious qi shifts and alters, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating, thus there is no constancy in high or low. It observes firmness and follows it; it observes softness and follows it—hence its lack of constancy. The qi of decline, death, imprisonment, and ruin mirrors the myriad things, endlessly changing and chaotic, with no regular pattern of emergence or withdrawal. The Five Hegemons emulated this, their qi disordered and inauspicious, thus they could not possess joy.\n\nThe nature of Heaven and Earth is to rejoice in goodness, not to rejoice in evil. The martial power of Heaven and Earth is for punishing evil, not for punishing good. The standards of Heaven and Earth cannot be reversed.\n\nHow excellent! How excellent!\n\nMay I ask about the meaning of \"rejoicing in goodness\"? I wish to hear the great secret, that my foolish heart may fully understand and never again dare to question. Could I be permitted to hear it?\n\nDo you yourself not yet understand?\n\nI have gained some small understanding, but I fear that people of later ages, long sunk in accumulated ignorance, even when given these words, may still fail to comprehend and thus violate Heaven’s prohibitions. Therefore, I dare not refrain from asking. The great secret is easy to know.\n\nExcellent are your words, for you have grasped their meaning. Very well, be seated, and I shall now explain it.",

People silently love one another, never contending, and joy arises of itself. Above and below, none harm or plunder each other, and all delight together. Therefore, joy arises from goodness and rejoices in goodness—Heaven causes this to be so naturally.\n\nExcellent! Excellent!\n\nIn the most inauspicious years, not a single thing is good. Every person suffers hunger and cold, weeping and wailing, harming and plundering one another. Silently, sorrow, bitterness, and resentment arise within, and their hearts know no joy. How could they sing, dance, or find delight? Silently, they wither and perish. Thus, inauspicious years and evil times bring no joy—Heaven causes this to be so naturally. This is clear evidence that Heaven does not delight in misfortune and evil.\n\nTherefore, joy arises to celebrate goodness, while martial power arises to punish misfortune. Thus, when the ancient emperors and kings were about to rise, they received the response of joy and goodness; when they were about to decline, they received the response of evil. This is the natural law.\n\nThus, joy gives rise to goodness, and goodness gives rise to joy; misfortune gives rise to joylessness, and martial power gives rise to misfortune. Non-action gives rise to joy, and joy gives rise to non-action. Martial power gives rise to chaos, and chaos gives rise to martial power. Joy gives rise to song and dance, and song and dance give rise to joy.

I wish to hear of them.\n\nIndeed, from ancient times to the present, all who cultivate the Dao take the August Heaven as their model. The most excellent appellation—crowning the unsurpassed, encompassing the boundless, inwardly without interior, outwardly without gap, entering without aperture—serves as the teacher of all affairs under heaven. It is the origin of life, the elder of all matters, the enduring attainment of sages and worthies past and present. It is how emperors and kings secure the heart of Heaven, becoming the parents who bring peace to the people, the source from which all transformations arise.\n\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nThe Dao is Heaven itself—pure and luminous, unwilling to be defiled or shamed. Yet now, those who study and practice the Dao all engage in four ruinous deeds, jointly defiling the numinous Dao of August Heaven, throwing into chaos the principles of Earth, and rendering themselves unfit to lead transformation, to serve as models, or to be parents. Together, they destroy Heaven’s precious vessels. Heaven names them all as *greatly rebellious sons*.\n\nYou dwell upon the earth—if you do not conform to the models of the Dao, how could Heaven, in its tranquility, conform to your models instead? Do you wish to know the truth of this? It is as if a petty man among the common folk does not conform to the models of the Dao. Would he, standing before the emperor, then conform to those models? If one remains below and fails to conform to the Dao’s models, yet Heaven were to cherish him and take him as its model—would this not mean that those in the heavens above and before the emperor would instead be ruled by those who hoard wickedness? Thus, Heaven above deeply perceives their deviation from the Dao, not out of deliberate malice in reproaching them.\n\nNow, as the Primordial Qi of the Cavernous Upper August arrives, it will no longer tolerate these four kinds of people. These four cause both Heaven above and Earth below to despise those who practice the Dao, instead branding them as *evil sons*. This is why the human Dao daily declines and fades, resting in decay without revival. Today, all under heaven commit evil—this is precisely the ruin wrought by these four.\n\nHeaven above greatly abhors and reproaches them, and thus seeks to select seven others instead.\nDo you understand, Perfected One?\n\nThis foolish one’s nature is dull and slow—I still do not comprehend.

      "translated_text": "The Dao is the teacher of August Heaven, the most precious treasure of Heaven. Those who practice it must conduct themselves as if formed by Heaven itself. The Dao ought to be practiced with utmost reverence, for Heaven cherishes and employs those who do so. Yet now, some who have erred and attained the Dao ascend to Heaven, only to be received with inquiry—only to reveal conduct lacking in reverence and filial piety. The Dao is the foremost transformer, and Heaven serves as the model for humanity. How could it reverse its role to shelter and nurture the irreverent and unfilial of the world? If a child harbors such evil conduct, how could Heaven deem it fitting to grant this person longevity and share its work? Would Heaven instead take such a rebellious child as its master? Even on Earth, such a person would not be employed—how could Heaven employ them? Thus, no one who is unfilial and practices the Dao has ever ascended to Heaven. Though they may depart, they are all deceived by malevolent spirits and treacherous ghosts. They will dwell in death upon barren lands, in desolate wilds, their forms punished. Heaven’s response to humanity is as swift as an echo—how could evil conduct yield good reward? Such cases are rare in past and present. Though many on Earth have practiced the Dao, few have been deemed worthy. Now, in Heaven, there are few good people, none with whom to share its work—their conduct is entirely wicked. Why does Heaven not immediately destroy them, instead consigning them to barren lands, to uninhabited wilds where breath ceases? It does not immediately annihilate them because between Heaven and Earth, qi gathers in abundance, fostering harmony—this is called the balanced harmony of the center. It is like human harmony, which encompasses all without exception. Thus, Heaven temporarily tolerates them, for Heaven governs with clarity and brightness, like standing before an imperial sovereign—it cannot harbor the wicked. Therefore, Heaven does not employ such people in its governance, nor does Earth. Heaven does not employ the irreverent and unfilial, just as a sagely king does not employ the irreverent and unfilial. If even a sagely king refuses to govern with them, how could Heaven alone do so? The ancient sages and worthies did not govern with such people because they deeply observed Heaven’s laws and modeled their conduct upon them. To govern with the foolish would incur Heaven’s great resentment. How do we know this? When a ruler governs with such people, Heaven manifests many disasters and omens, and the barbarians frequently invade—this is clear proof of Heaven’s hatred. Is this not as unchanging as the compass and square, as binding as a contract? Now, if even humanity detests and despises such people, how could Heaven itself employ them? What humanity hates, Heaven also hates; what humanity cherishes, Heaven also cherishes. Thus, the ancient worthies and sages deeply understood Heaven’s will and always modeled their conduct upon it, not daring to deviate even slightly. Therefore, they alone enjoyed Heaven’s favor and gained its heart. If one does not align with Heaven’s heart, one does not gain it—and great misfortune follows. If human conduct is already thus, how much more so for those who would become Heaven’s chosen officers? Heaven’s chosen officers must work alongside Heaven, governing the boundless arts. They must join forces for eternity, harmonize their qi with one heart—how could a Perfected One be remiss in this? Be vigilant! My words embody the pure will of Heaven—do not transgress them.

      "translated_text": "The foolish student’s heart holds but a single good understanding in this. You, too, should refine even this single good understanding—common people do not grasp it, lost in their dark and muddled confusion. Heaven detests this, and so has sent me down to proclaim the great teaching, fully revealing Heaven’s laws. From this point onward, let all learners take heed and be vigilant.\n\nNow Heaven values and esteems the transmission of life in succession, so the four seasons receive Heaven’s Daoist instruction, passing life onward to generate and complete, without end. Thus do all things flourish and endure. Therefore, Heaven is named the Father of Generation, Earth the Mother of Nurturance. Following the qi of the Six Jia, Twelve Branches, and Eight Trigrams as their guiding principles, they take turns generating and employing one another. Thus, the Dao of Heaven remains eternally present, never destroyed or ruined—this is the constant work of its transformative power.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao must be pure and take Heaven as their model. Yet many, though outwardly pure, leave no posterity, jointly extinguishing Heaven’s lineage. The steadfast among them still uphold Heaven’s nature, but their qi is insufficient. The unsteadfast force the matter, obstructing and blocking the Dao of yin and yang. Scattering their seed across the four wilds, some even abandon and kill, leaving their wives and children destitute—these are all people who greatly destroy and lose the Dao. They are unworthy of emulation, beings of great misfortune in every fraction, unfit to serve as teachers or models for others. How could they possibly align with the laws of the Heavenly Master?\n\nThe August Heaven is the elder of all affairs, the parent of humanity, the model from which all sages under Heaven take their pattern. Why would one act recklessly, losing the Dao and behaving without posterity, to serve alongside such a one? If Heaven were to govern jointly with such a person, Heaven would be named a master who shelters evil, promoting inauspicious arts—how could this be called sagely, how could one serve as a teacher above others? Therefore, Heaven does not tolerate or cease to stop them.\n\nThe ancient sages and great worthies knew well to avoid such transgressions, refusing to govern alongside those without posterity, for in doing so, they would fail to gain Heaven’s heart. Thus, the sages and worthies—whom Heaven causes to be esteemed and to have posterity—jointly detest those without posterity. The sages deeply understood Heaven’s will and always modeled themselves upon it, not deviating even slightly. How much more so for Heaven itself?\n\nNow, for a long time, there have been no good people above in Heaven, so I have been sent down to proclaim these great words, to instruct and admonish those who come later, that the foolish may all come to know. If those above in Heaven employ such people, would Heaven above not instead become a host for those without posterity? Acting in this way, would one ascend to Heaven? Would Heaven above love those without posterity and not favor life? Thus, all such people die in barren lands, lifeless soils, and desolate wilds where no one dwells, each sent to return to their own kind. You do not favor life, opposing Heaven, so you are cast into places where nothing grows. You delight in desolation, so you are cast into wilds where no one lives.\n\nCommon people, blind and unseeing, claim they have already transcended the world—this is not true. I dare not deceive the Perfected One. I have personally descended after journeying above in Heaven. Whether one sees or not is like showing the sun to the blind—telling them they are being deceived, they cover their mouths and laugh. Fools are just like this. Perfected One, be vigilant! What Heaven above detests, those above also detest. Excellent, excellent!\n\nThe foolish student has never before witnessed such matters of Heaven above—only now has he truly awakened to this. You must strive to perform good deeds. My writings heal the illnesses of Heaven and Earth, relieve the sorrows and sufferings of emperors and kings. When your merit is complete and you ascend to Heaven, you will see for yourself—the efficacy of my words will be greatly proven. Indeed, indeed. I dare not delay, nor dare I be remiss.

      "translated_text": "Oh, how grave! Oh, how grave!\n\nThus, the human head and mouth resemble Heaven, unwilling to delight in seeing defilement or disgrace, always desiring freshness and brightness, desiring good things. Therefore, when people in the world indulge in filth, disgrace, and evil, feeding such things to others, Heaven sends down thunder and lightning to capture and seize them. Perfected One, do you recognize this as perverse and wicked? Indeed, indeed. This foolish one deeply fears it.\n\nFrom the great central high antiquity to now, people claim to be good, utterly distinct from common folk. Yet those who study the Dao often instruct one another to eat feces and drink urine, calling themselves plain and good people—Heaven and the Dao deeply detest this. In Heaven, such are named the great rebellious children, whose human forms Heaven does not wish to see. These are the marks of great evil, the descent of dog and swine spirits.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to Heaven, and Heaven possesses the Dao, which serves as the teacher and elder for all affairs. The true Dao is that by which goodness flourishes and evil is eliminated. Thus, when ancient sage-kings and emperors were about to rise, they all received the Dao as their teacher, entering to receive its strategies and wisdom, transforming their people. The teacher was honored, and it was said that they could know Heaven’s will and emulate Heaven in their conduct.\n\nIn Heaven, those who follow the good Dao are also revered and esteemed, for it is said they can harmonize with the winds and qi, follow the four seasons, uphold the five phases, regulate wind and rain, assist the sun, moon, and stars in shining brightly, and cause the myriad things to flourish. Now, how can those who eat feces and drink urine serve as teachers?\n\nToday, even earthly teachers fall short, named rebellious children—how could they possibly become teachers in Heaven? Such petty people are profoundly foolish, deeply mired in defiling and disgracing the Dao of Heaven.\n\nPerfected One, having received this ultimate text, ponder its meaning: what the earth below uniformly detests, Heaven above also detests; what Heaven above detests, the earth below likewise does. Thus, when people below detest eating feces and drinking urine, Heaven above also detests it, and so sends down thunder and lightning to strike them dead.\n\nThese words are merely to enlighten those on earth, for Heaven’s detestation is far more severe. If even those on earth abhor this, how much more so in Heaven? Heaven is pure, bright, and fresh—how could it instead gather and shelter those who eat feces and drink urine?\n\nEven if one errs by chance and momentarily attains the Dao, they will not ascend to Heaven. All will perish in the lands of the five wastes, where qi is cut off and fortune fails, to follow their conduct, to manifest their transgressions, each returning to what they sought—no deception here.\n\nPerfected One, if your years have reached their virtuous end, be warned and cautious, setting an example for those to come. When the equable qi of the Supreme August One descends, such evil conduct will find no refuge—death for transgression is clear indeed.\n\nOh, how grave! Oh, how grave!

It governs emergence, not reception; it governs triumph, not submission. To submit is to act in rebellion. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven cannot be coerced by force, for coercion and duress bring about the ruin of humankind.\n\nHeaven presides over goodness, over clarity and luminosity; it takes no delight in witnessing stagnation, defilement, or disgrace. Now the gift of Heaven and the Dao is called the \"Peerless Appellation.\" Thus, emperors and kings model their conduct upon Heaven, styling themselves \"Peerless Sovereigns.\" They dare not lose even a fraction of Heaven’s way—adherence brings fortune, while deviation brings great misfortune.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao to attain longevity must purely emulate Heaven. Heaven delights in life; therefore, those who seek longevity must purely guard Heaven’s primordial life-generating qi, and their conduct must follow the intent of the Dao of Heaven. As for Earth, it presides over disgrace and destruction, over concealment—one must not follow Earth’s intent.\n\nThe Dao is the root of the great transformation, the teacher and elder of the great transformation. Thus, nothing under Heaven comes into being without emulating it. Yet now, petty and foolish men who seek the Dao bring no benefit to the people; instead, they collectively defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven. Their rebellion is extreme and without form.

      "translated_text": "Excellent indeed is your question! Heaven has prompted your words—open wide your ears and listen attentively.\n\nDoes not Heaven and the Dao favor bestowal, favor life, and favor praise? Why then do they not divine with hexagrams, dispense medicines, and bring benefit to the people, allowing spirits to govern humanity so that illness may surely cease? These three kinds of men may all be called masters, yet they do not profit the Dao of Heaven, nor dare they defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven does not deceive; it ever demands utmost sincerity. If one deceives with the pretense of not deceiving, in time, day by day, misfortune and decline will follow. The Dao of Heaven does not delight in defilement and disgrace, nor does it desire to benefit others. Heaven is supreme above all, and the Dao is yet more exalted—it is the teacher and model of the Heavenly Sovereign, loftier even than Heaven. Thus, Heaven and the Dao preside over cultivation and rectitude, ever leading in all affairs. Thereby they harmonize yin and yang, regulate wind and rain, rectify day and night, and array the ranks. Between Heaven and Earth, none fail to receive grace and destiny, each attaining its proper place.\n\nYet now, petty and foolish men who pursue the Dao instead engage in deceit, arrogance, delusion, and madness. Together they confuse and disrupt the Dao of Heaven, ruin the primal transformations of Heaven, and turn to begging for others’ possessions, bringing no benefit to the people. They defile and disgrace the Dao of Heaven. Though they claim to benefit the common folk, they cannot serve as models for teachers. Instead, they lead later generations to teach one another the Dao, causing people to become deluded, arrogant, deceitful, and defiled, resorting to begging. Thus, their conduct is named the Dao of the deluded, arrogant beggar. They cause all people to revile Heaven together, to despise the true Dao, and to sever the great transformation. Heaven deeply abhors them; the Dao deeply detests them. Heaven above does not wish to see their form.\n\nNow, the Supreme Sovereign of Heaven has sent forth the great rectifying qi. The sun, moon, and stars are arrayed in order, all reverently illuminating the Dao and Heaven. They regulate wind and rain, harmonize yin and yang, and cause the myriad things to each attain their proper place. Yet those who previously chanced upon the Dao and ascended to Heaven found no office there. Heaven questioned them and found them full of transgressions, unfit to serve together. You all dwell upon the earth and are still called deluded, arrogant beggars—how could you be fit to serve as teachers to emperors and kings, let alone as teachers in Heaven above?\n\nHeaven abhors them; the great Dao declines and falls into ruin. The fault lies with the people of later ages who, in learning from one another, lost the proper standards. Heaven is afflicted by this, deeply grieved. The Dao of Heaven is obstructed, and thus it has sent me down to discuss with the Perfected One and distinguish the gains and losses of the Dao. It delights in the awakening of all under Heaven, that they may together know the intent of Heaven above, reform their conduct, transform their hearts, and no longer transgress Heaven’s prohibitions. Then those who study will succeed. If they persist in their former ways, Heaven will not raise them up.\n\nThey shall surely return to die in the land of the five disgraceful things, their lives consigned to the five defiled soils, cut off in the desolate wilds of delusion and madness. Above, there are no Three Luminaries; below, no fertile earth. Why is this? I wish to hear: how grave is their transgression? It is not that they are punished without cause. The Dao of Heaven serves as the law, and each follows its kind—this is the deprivation from below.\n\nWhy then are they not immediately killed, but instead brought to this? If they were to be instantly destroyed, they would claim to seek long life and profess utmost faith. If they were to be killed outright, they would weep to Heaven and wail to Earth, calling themselves deeply wronged, yet unaware of the source of their transgressions. Thus, Heaven examines and tests them, later casting them into the land of the five disgraceful and deluded things, that they may come to know themselves.\n\nDo you wish to know the truth of this? It is like a wise king examining a person’s transgressions and holding them accountable—not immediately killing them, but rather, according to the severity of their crime, sending them to prison. Great crimes go to great prisons, small crimes to small prisons, where they are governed until the person submits, comes to know their fault, and dies without resentment or complaint. If their words are not thoroughly examined, they may protest their innocence, die with grievance in their hearts, and harbor resentment. Thus, the hegemons of the Five Dynasties had many subjects and ministers who died with grievance in their hearts.\n\nDo you now understand that the administration of punishment in Heaven above is like this? Perfected One, do you comprehend? How admirable! How admirable! To know awe and reverence is the gateway to life; not to know awe and reverence is the root of death. Heed my words well—my words are the soldiers of the rectified Heaven. Do not defy or slight them, for defiance brings harm. Minor defiance brings minor harm; great defiance brings annihilation.\n\nI caution you, Perfected One: the people of later ages accumulate folly, trusting their ignorant hearts, and say, “It is not so,” thereby bringing ruin upon themselves. I personally traverse the realm above Heaven and know its affairs below—ten thousand times, not one is lost. I dare not deceive you. Though I do not fear the Perfected One, I fear the majesty of Heaven. Thus, my words are trustworthy. That I repeat and emphasize them is to guard against those who might stubbornly err. Therefore, I reiterate to make my words more abundant and refined.\n\nThe affairs of Heaven above are truly distant and difficult to know, so the scriptures are frequently sent down to align with the earth. Good upon the earth is good in Heaven above; evil upon the earth is evil in Heaven above. Thus, when people do good upon the earth, Heaven above responds with goodness; when people do evil upon the earth, Heaven above responds with evil—this is the ascent of their qi. The five qi are interconnected, above and below as one; the six jia are linked, above and below as one. The twelve branches unite above and below, and none, whether near or far, fail to communicate. If below is good, above is bright; if below is evil, above is inauspicious.\n\nThus, the Five Phases arise below, and the Five Stars shine above. This is how Heaven enlightens the people under Heaven—all Three Luminaries are likewise. Heaven above and the earth below are connected through the Three Luminaries. When the Three Luminaries shine below, so too in Heaven above; when Heaven above is bright, so too upon the earth. The two respond to one another, harmonizing to form the warp and woof. What is greatly good in Heaven above is likewise upon the earth.",

      "translated_text": "Just as Heaven possesses the six jia and twelve branches, so too does the earth; just as the earth possesses the six jia and twelve branches, so too does Heaven. Thus, above and below ever correspond, not erring by even a hair’s breadth. O Perfected One, be vigilant in this. Though My words may seem distant, guard against concealing them; show them to learners, but transmit them only after fasting and purification. Be vigilant.\n\nFollow the text as law; do not recite it in darkness.\n\n“Yes, yes. I humbly ask: since the Middle Antiquity of the Most High, among those who taught the Dao, many abandoned their homes and forsook their kin, cast aside wives and children, and feigned madness—begging, eating filth, drinking urine. Later learners, following their example, passed these practices down as teachings, each with its own master and method, yet none were empty or careless.”\n\n“Excellent is your challenging question, for it exposes their perverse intent. Does Heaven despise them, that you ask this? How cunning their words—why do you raise this? Long have I wondered at this, yet none dared ask directly, ever holding it in silent distress. Excellent indeed! Has Heaven truly appointed you to raise this matter?”\n\n“Very well. Open your ears, and I shall distinguish and explain it for you. When the Supreme Heaven first revealed the true Dao, it was not like this. All practiced filial devotion to their parents, maintained descendants with wives and children, kept proper appearance, and were not mad—nor did they eat filth or drink urine. All their actions accorded with the Dao and moved within its laws. The highest adepts became teachers and assistants to emperors and kings, transmitting and nurturing their kind without harm.\n\nAt that time—like the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors—they acted by the true Dao, striving to benefit and never to harm or injure. Thus, they practiced the true Dao openly, without concealment. But when the Three Kings brought chaos and the Five Hegemons arose, rulers and ministers, the people, all deceived and slighted one another. Hence, they feigned madness, fearing discovery, begging, eating filth, drinking urine—these are the deeds and words of the desperate and destitute.\n\nThe Dao, too, has its cycles of decline and flourishing, like the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons. In later ages, the way of hegemony prevailed: begging, abandoning kin, forsaking wives and children, eating filth, drinking urine—this is the decline of the Dao, the rise of hegemony. Thus, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors often attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven, some through corpse liberation, others by departing in bodily form. The Three Kings lived out their years, but the Five Hegemons gained no true Dao, all dying in battle upon the wilds. Those who now cling to this hegemonic way in the later age likewise perish upon the wilds—this is what it means.\n\nI do not deceive you, Perfected One: this, too, is a hegemonic Dao, no different from the hegemons and kings. How could they ascend to Heaven? Excellent, excellent! The foolish heart of this student is now truly enlightened. I never imagined the Dao could have a hegemonic aspect. Only through the Heavenly Master’s explanation have I come to know this. Truly, truly… how profound! You may be said to have opened my eyes.\n\nI ask: what should learners of today do? Now, the great cycle of the Heavenly Dao is complete and fully prepared. From this time onward, it differs from the past. If one seeks to practice the hegemonic methods of Middle Antiquity, the true Dao will not come. O Perfected One, be warned and vigilant. If you desire long life and joyful existence, study My texts. Lose even a hair’s breadth, and your life will not be whole—how can you fail to guard it?\n\nThe primordial Dao of the Origin-Yuan has arisen; the fire-light practices it. The hegemonic Dao is ended.

I merely fear that excessive words and ornate phrasing would obscure the meaning, which is why I limit myself to the Perfected One’s discourse.\n\nWords are the handle of the Dao, the origin of all scripture. Do not be disheartened, for I shall now distinguish these matters for you.\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\nNow, in the heavens above, the Supreme Sovereign’s Primordial Qi of Equilibrium flourishes in full vigor. The yang sun shines brightly, perverse qi halts and recedes, while upright qi advances. Decay dissipates, and the Dao and virtue align with yang.\n\nHeaven urgently prohibits setting fire to the mountain forests and thickets of trees. Why is this? I wish to hear of it.\n\nIndeed, mountains are great yang, the web of the upper earth, their sovereign. The myriad rooted things—trees are their chief, their ruler, their yang. Fire, too, is the sovereign and chief of the Five Phases, their yang. Three sovereigns, three yangs, when they meet, they mutually diminish one another.\n\nThus, Heaven’s decree urgently forbids burning mountain forests and thickets. If trees are not burned, they remain within yin. Yin is called \"mother,\" and thus leans downward. This is why Heaven causes the branches of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* to first sprout and flourish abundantly. When they flourish, fire reigns; when fire reigns, the sun grows ever brighter. When *bing* and *ding* flourish, *si* and *wu* rejoice. Why is this? I wish to hear of it.\n\nThis is Heaven’s pattern, its nature. When the mother is abundant and reigns, her child assists. When the child assists, it receives qi for a long duration, extending life. Thus, Heaven prohibits this.\n\nWhen yang flourishes, yin’s treachery daily recedes; when yang wanes, yin’s treachery daily rises. Thus, the cunning and deceitful always emerge in the depths of night—this is the great proof of treachery arising when yang wanes. Therefore, Heaven desires to eliminate treachery and so prohibits this.

      "translated_text": "I ask: when the Three Yangs align, why does misfortune and decline follow?\n\nExcellent indeed, your question—you have grasped its essence. Now, the Three Yangs correspond to the yang of Heaven, the yang of Earth, and the yang of Man. All three are entirely yang, without a trace of yin; all three are rulers, without a single minister; all three are male, without a single female. This is the path to annihilation, the Way without posterity. It dares not transmit its kind, nor can it mutually generate and complete—hence, it is inauspicious. This is what is meant by having Heaven but no Earth, having the sun but no moon, having above but no below, having exterior but no interior. In Heaven, this is called the *Record of Established Ruin*, and thus it is detested and prohibited.\n\nExcellent indeed. Though foolish, I have ventured to ask this, and I am deeply wary of it. You who know wariness—this is the root of life. Those who do not know wariness—this is the gate of misfortune.\n\nIndeed, indeed.\n\n**Method of Burning the Lower Field’s Weeds, Two Hundred Ten**\n\nI ask: regarding the weeds of the lower field, may they be burned?\n\nHeaven does not prohibit burning them. They ought to be burned.\n\nBut why ought they be burned? I wish to hear of it.\n\nNow, weeds are the yin of wood and correspond to *yi*. Wood corresponds to *jia*. *Jia* is yang and of the same kind as wood, hence they correspond. *Yi* is yin and of the same kind as weeds, hence it corresponds to *yi*. *Yi* fears metal, and metal injures wood; when wood is injured, yang declines, and when yang declines, false treachery arises—thus, they ought to be burned.\n\nMoreover, Heaven says: *yi* is yin, weeds are yin, and the lower field is the yin of earth. When the Three Yin align, they instead jointly generate treachery. Thus, the Dark Warrior dwells in the northern pole of yin, and when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born anew. Fire is yang, and when yin obtains yang, it follows auspiciously, generating good affairs. Therefore, Heaven instructs: burn the weeds of the lower field to please yin and invigorate yang—thus, burn them. This is also the way of Heaven.\n\n*Jia* is the wood of Heaven. *Yi* is the weeds of Heaven. What then are *yin* and *mao*?\n\nNow, *yin* is also yang and the wood of Earth. *Mao* is yin and the weeds of Earth. These four all move eastward. Yet yang is called wood, and yin is called weeds—this is the natural law, the classic of Heaven. I dare not deceive the Perfected One.\n\nYou inquire of Heaven’s affairs to resolve doubts, and I expound Heaven’s affairs. Together, we share this duty, jointly ordering yin and yang, removing the ailments of Heaven and Earth, ensuring the Emperor knows no sorrow, and enabling the twelve thousand things to each find their place. None will fail to emerge joyfully, and there will be no grievances or entanglements.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed.",

      "translated_text": "Peradventure, the Perfected One may be said to have grasped the Dao.\n—Not at all, not at all.\nYet in learning and inquiring of the Dao, what offering should there be?\n—Indeed, indeed. I strike my breast and heart, never to depart from it.\n\nExcellent indeed, excellent indeed. In learning and inquiry, you have attained its method.\n\n**Heavenly Spirits Examine Transgressions and Adjudicate the Threefold Concord: Scroll Two Hundred Eleven**\n\nNow, the harmonious and equable qi of Heaven descends in goodness, yet I ever fear that the people may, through misfortune, violate the seasonal ordinances and harm it. Today, all the spirits of Heaven jointly record those who delight in killing and wounding, the sons who hunt, shoot, fish, and trap, those who defy the Dao of Heaven and do no good, those who habitually take life and inflict harm. Heaven deeply reproves them; Earth deeply abhors them; the host of spirits deeply condemns them.\n\nI now fear that petty men, accumulating folly, can no longer be restrained, and together they pollute and disrupt the pure, equable qi of the Cavernous Emperor. Thus, Heaven’s great urgency compels the deployment of all spirits to record their deeds, following their actions day by day, noting even the slightest transgressions for examination.\n\nThree years, including intercalary months, constitute one intermediate reckoning; five years, one great reckoning. Those with grave transgressions shall be held accountable; those with minor faults shall have their years diminished and their allotted spans curtailed. Every three generations, a great reckoning is conducted; every five generations, annihilation follows. Therefore, today Heaven gathers the documents of the Three Dao, and all spirits jointly record transgressions, severing the propensity for killing, wounding, and penal punishment—while fostering joy, the same holds true upon Earth.\n\nFortunate is the Perfected One who cultivates goodness, ever desiring to render virtue unto August Heaven and pity the Emperor’s sorrows and afflictions when the seasonal qi are discordant. The true fault lies with those who delight in killing and wounding, hunting, shooting, fishing, and trapping, who together promote penal punishment and habitually harbor intentions contrary to Heaven and Earth. Thus, long-standing disorder and disharmony persist, and Emperors past and present have incurred sorrow and affliction—this is a grievous transgression.\n\nFortunate is the Perfected One who ever seeks to render merit unto Heaven and grace unto the Emperor. Today, Heaven accumulates its virulent toxins. The host of spirits instructs me in these words, and thus I now entrust this document to the Perfected One, to return it to the virtuous ruler and display it throughout the world. Let each person who receives this text deeply reflect, pondering their faults and heeding its words.\n\nToday, the harmonious and equable qi of Heaven descends in full, yet it does not favor those who harbor malice and treachery. Knowing that Heaven holds these words, how dare I not transmit them below? To remain silent would be to become complicit in malice and treachery, bringing harm upon myself—I dare not transgress. Therefore, I report these matters. All Perfected Ones, take heed.\n\nIf the Perfected One does not speak, harm shall befall you. If you display this to the common people and they, in their folly, violate it, harm shall befall them, and Heaven shall no longer hold the Perfected One accountable.\n\nFrom this day forward, Heaven shall mobilize the host of spirits to conduct examinations and govern the people. In Heaven, the Three Dao gather and circulate documents to record transgressions; the spirits, too, circulate documents of the Three Dao to record transgressions; thus, people likewise circulate documents of the Three Dao to record transgressions. Therefore, people take their pattern from Heaven, Heaven takes its pattern from people, and Heaven, Earth, and humanity each have their affairs. They emulate the numinous spirits and likewise model their affairs upon their methods.\n\nThus, the spirits and qi of ghosts admonish humanity, and admonition is ever present. Heaven, Earth, and humanity act in unison. Therefore, spirits respond to Heaven’s qi and act; refined beings respond to Earth’s qi and arise; ghosts respond to human governance and contend. These three are the agents of harmony and disharmony in Heaven and Earth, moving in accord with the spirit-qi, responding to the seasons in their comings and goings, traversing the Cavernous without interruption, their movements and abodes difficult to discern.\n\nThus, today the Dao of Heaven transmits governance, differing from ancient times. To divine the present by the past often misses the mark; to divine the past by the present no longer accords. Therefore, ancient texts have declined and are difficult to employ; their use seldom hits the mark. Yet there are places where true and authentic texts are gathered.\n\nThus, Heaven speaks of \"adjudication and examination.\" Former and latter, threefold concord: the median goodness is taken to clarify affairs and align intentions. Only then is the Dao of Heaven rectified, the kingly Dao complete, all evil and wickedness expelled, the Emperor greatly joyful, and affairs at peace. People, through their own caution, attain Heaven’s intent.\n\nPerfected One, do you grasp the gravity of these matters?\n—Indeed, indeed.\nExcellent. You have comprehended its meaning.",

      "translated_text": "Now, the reason Heaven above strives to foster and nurture all life while urgently preventing harm and injury lies in the Dao’s constant regulation of the three qi. The first favors generation and is called yang; the second favors completion and is called harmony; the third favors destruction and is called yin. Thus, Heaven presides over generation, humanity presides over nurturing and completion, and what is completed is called destruction—destruction that conceals. Heaven, Earth, and humanity share this work together, their tasks mutually dependent. Without yang, nothing is born; without harmony, nothing is completed; without yin, nothing is destroyed. These three are interdependent as one household, jointly bringing forth the twelve thousand things. Yet the Dao of Heaven encompasses beginning, end, and middle.\n\nNow, since the Dao of Heaven first arose, it has completed a great cycle and returned, presently aligning with humanity and yang. Yang favors generation and abhors destruction; what is generated requires joy to unite hearts in mutual growth. Yet if destructive qi intrudes, it causes injury and prevents generation and completion. If you wish to know its truth, consider the child in the womb—even slight harm will cause injury and death, and once dead, it cannot be revived. Each loss is one person abandoned, and if such injuries continue unchecked, the line is severed, leaving no posterity, and the household perishes without succession. Thus, the urgency is greatest when punishments and killings occur. The Dao of Heaven is not always like this.\n\nNow, the urgency has grown even greater, and I shall make it clear for the Perfected One to discern, so that people of later ages may fully awaken to the Dao of Heaven. I do not wish for destruction and injury to prevail, which is why I speak so plainly to the Perfected One. Common people follow me only in idle literary pursuits, crafting clever words. Therefore, I shall further present the celestial proofs of punishment and Heaven’s evidence.\n\nNow, the first year of the sexagenary cycle is the celestial norm, when the sun returns to its origin at the winter solstice. The second year is the terrestrial norm, when things spread their roots. The third year is the human norm, when at dawn people rise, open their doors, and attend to their duties. These three together mark the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity—the root of all things. The initial generation belongs to yang, which is the primordial qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Thus, *Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen* reside on the northeast face, with harmony at the center between *Kan* and *Gen*, where yin and yang unite to generate at the center.\n\nTherefore, all who conceive reside in the middle of the abdomen, slightly below the center of harmony. When yang unites, it first generates and sends forth its form and qi, casting them to other regions—this is where the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity first arise, where things renew above and below. There must be no punishments or killings, for qi resides within. When the qi of virtue and yang are established, the myriad things attain their proper generation; if inauspicious qi intrudes, it causes injury. Thus, punishments are cast out.\n\nNow, the Dao of Heaven has completed a great cycle and renewed, with pure yang governing above and below. Therefore, punishments must be urgently abolished. Heaven is called spirit, and yang is also called spirit; thus, Heaven now sends spirits to govern humanity. Perfected One, do you wish to know whether my writings align with Heaven? From now on, those who violate my writings and favor punishments and killings will be examined by Heaven above. People will also urgently condemn them, and spirits will examine them. Heaven above and Earth below, though in different realms, will conspire together; ghosts and spirits, though not of the same household as humanity, will also conspire. This is the arrival of Heaven’s balanced qi.\n\nThe initial qi of Heaven renews above, the initial qi of Earth renews below, and the initial qi of humanity renews at the center. These three qi now begin together, unwilling to encounter the qi of punishment, evil, or misfortune, and desiring only to meet joyful qi. Therefore, from now on, Heaven and Earth will joyfully abolish punishments. Perfected One, do you understand? —Indeed, indeed.",

      "translated_text": "The foolish and benighted among the living suppose that Heaven swiftly punishes those who do evil by forbidding injury and killing. They do not realize that this concerns the generative qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity— the very root and origin of renewal. Hearing the Celestial Master expound this, I am deeply awed and humbled. To feel such awe and humility is to awaken, to grasp the intent of the Dao of Heaven. Excellent! You who understand these matters, take heed of this text and be careful never to sever it, lest you harm yourself. —Indeed, indeed. —I dare not, I dare not. Go forth and hold it in reverence.\n\nAll who study and inquire do so for their own sake, striving to align with the Dao of Heaven. —Indeed, indeed. Proclaim these celestial prohibitions; do not conceal them. —Indeed, indeed.\n\nMay I ask why the Dao of Heaven now establishes this great cycle as the primordial beginning, and why the celestial reckoning precisely corrects the texts at this time? Excellent is your challenging question—it perfectly accords with the mind of Heaven. Now is the ascendance of the Five Yangs, the inception of the Five Fires. The supreme Fire ascends to become Heaven, manifesting as the radiance of the sun and moon. Fire is red, sharing Heaven’s color; Heaven is red, and Fire is red—red is the mark of the numinous. Heaven and the numinous endure eternally, attaining the origin of all things. Thus, the eleventh month is the celestial standard, and so too in the heavens above. Its qi is red, for red is the sun’s returning inception. The initial nine qi belong to *jiazi*, the chief and foremost of the Six *Jia*s. *Jia* is essence, the heart of all matters; thus *jia* emerges first from *zi*, ascending to become the Heart Star. The spirit of Fire is the human heart. The heart of humanity is sacred and numinous, most revered and truly good. Thus, the sacred heart of the numinous can create and initiate all things, serving as their primordial origin. The law of the sacred begins with the heart, and nothing remains unexplained. Therefore, the most flourishing of the red is Heaven, the sun, and the heart—Heaven, the sun, and the heart ever shine, illuminating all without exception. Henceforth, those who practice this Dao will utterly eradicate all that is wicked and perverse.\n\nThe birth of Yang occurs within the depths of darkness. Thus, Yang qi arises in the north, emerges in the east, flourishes in the south, and wanes in the west—such is the law of Heaven. Excellent! May I ask why the birth of Yang now occurs precisely within the depths of darkness? All that is born returns to its origin; only when Yin and Yang unite can generation occur. Thus, all that is born reverts to its initial beginning. When Heaven and Earth were undivided at their first arising, there was neither above nor below, neither sun nor moon nor the Three Luminaries. All was profoundly dark, without division or pattern. Though without division, within it inherently existed above and below, left and right, exterior and interior, Yin and Yang, all mutually sustaining yet undifferentiated. When Yin and Yang first sustained one another to generate life, their emanation was boundless, still undivided. Only after birth did head and limbs become distinct. How do we know that the inception of Yin and Yang, the beginning of generation, was thus? Therefore, when humanity now undergoes transformation to generate life, they all withdraw to secluded, dark places—Heaven ensures they do not forget their origin. The initial reception of Heaven and Earth’s law is humanity’s primal state; thus, Heaven ensures they do not forget.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Hearing the August Celestial Master’s words, I now understand the principles of division. You may be said to have been easily enlightened. May I ask why Yang and Fire are uniquely paired? The qi of each phase has its own pairing; Fire is not alone. Metal and Fire are most closely paired, as the chief of the Red Emperor. Does not the *Celestial Strategy* state it thus? *Bingwu* and *dingsi* are the ancestral beginning. \"Beginning\" means first, foremost. Thus, the text speaks of the ancestral beginning. The inception of all things arises from the red heart. The heart penetrates and illuminates, knowing all matters. Yang arises within Yin, also penetrating and illuminating. Water is dark without but bright within, penetrating and illuminating, for it contains Yang essence. Thus, Yang begins in the north, while Yin begins in the south. In the eleventh month, the earth below is warm; in the fifth month, the earth below is cold.\n\nNow, why do Yin and Yang begin not in the heavens above but precisely within the earth? Excellent is your challenging question. The earth is the mother; the father’s essence is bestowed upon the mother, hence within Yin. Its emanation of Yang essence originates equally from Heaven. Yang is the transforming inception of qi, subtle and difficult to perceive. It enters Yin to take form, becoming visible and manifest; thus, its record lies within Yin, not within Yang. Now, when rain and snow fall, they follow the same transformative Dao—visible and perceptible. Why then say that Yang’s subtle emanation is imperceptible?\n\nExcellent is your question! It is difficult to grasp its intent. I wish to explain it clearly for you, Perfected One, but fear that the great form of the Dao of Heaven would become manifest. Yet I fear you would harbor resentment. To be a teacher, to stand above others, is difficult. Please sit calmly, and I shall explain subtly.\n\nWhen Heaven’s rain and snow are about to form, they are but breath and qi. Only when Yin and Yang unite can their emanation become perceptible. At that moment, Heaven’s qi descends, Earth’s qi ascends, and their emanations converge. Thus, rain and snow take form and become visible. May I ask: now, when clouds rise from crumbling mountains, all is visible. Why then say it is imperceptible? I wished not to ask, but my heart was heavy with distress. Now I must ask fully. As your disciple, I am not modest, yet if I do not ask, I cannot attain understanding. Thus, I must ask without hesitation.\n\nVery well. I shall explain subtly, though it cannot be fully exhausted.",

      "translated_text": "Yet when clouds and rain shatter mountains, this is the rage of excessive Yin, which cannot restrain itself from harming the transformations of Yang—a dire omen, not a virtuous change. It wounds the Way of transformation, a failure of Yin, an injury to Yin.\n\nPerfected One, do not press further in questioning. The Way of Heaven cannot be exhaustively examined or fully spoken. Ponder its meaning yourself.\n\nVery well, very well. I shall depart.\n\n**The Dao’s Blessing on Three Kinds of People, Secret Teachings 213**\n\nThe Perfected One bowed twice and respectfully inquired of the Heavenly Master about the Dao:\n\nWhen the Qi of Great Peace arrives, who is fit for the Dao? Who is unfit for the Dao?\n\nExcellent, your question is apt. The Dao and humankind are like wind and rain: those who act upon it prosper; those who do not, desist. Those who delight in acting are its people; those who do not delight in acting are not its people. Those who act without strain, who are easily opened and penetrated—these are its people. Those who remain closed and impenetrable, who labor all day without success—these are not its people. To act is auspicious; not to act is inauspicious—such is its people. Those who do not act remain naturally auspicious and free from suffering, yet once they act, they suffer instead—these are not its people.\n\nMoreover, in nurturing oneself, one must examine carefully. The Dao is the tally of the upright. Illness, demonic forces, and malevolent spirits are the pathways of wickedness, thieves who murder good people. When some see others about to enter the true Dao, they grow resentful, quarrel with them, and though they act for the true Dao, they bring misfortune instead of goodness, finding false peace among the mediocre. One must be vigilant and refine oneself: attaining the Dao brings good fortune; losing it brings misfortune. The mandate of life and death cannot be taken lightly or treated carelessly.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your foolish disciple now understands.\n\nSince the Perfected One has asked about these doubts, I shall now impart the essential words of Heaven. The reason my Dao endures and nurtures is that there are those who delight in the Dao, delight in virtue, and delight in benevolence, who disregard worldly affairs and cherish life alone. The Dao rightly endures in nurturing and guarding these two kinds of people. Those who fall below this standard—my Dao does not endure in nurturing them.\n\nWhy is this? The human Dao covers all without exception—why then does it uniquely favor these three kinds of people and not others?\n\nExcellent indeed, your challenging question grasps the meaning. When the Great Dao emerges, all people receive its grace, even grasses and trees—none fail to be transformed for the good, all attain their proper place, and each fulfills its natural lifespan. Those without Dao, virtue, or benevolence cannot be nurtured for long.\n\nWhy? Simply because they do not delight in Dao, virtue, or benevolence. Why then can only those who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence be nurtured for long?\n\nI wish to hear the meaning.\n\nAh, you are perceptive! Your question cuts to the ultimate secret. Listen carefully, and I shall distinguish its meaning for you.\n\nVery well.\n\nThose who delight in Dao, virtue, and benevolence—these three kinds of people each possess the mandate of the Three Powers. Those who delight in the Dao belong to the mandate of Heaven; those who delight in virtue and nurturing belong to the mandate of Earth; those who delight in benevolence belong to the mandate of humanity. These three kinds of people correspond to the harmony of Yin and Yang, and all have their names recorded in the registers. Thus, the myriad spirits of Heaven declare: “Our scriptures can nurture them.” Those who do not act thus have no record in the registers, and so our scriptures cannot nurture them for long.\n\nNow that the Qi of Great Peace has arrived, there is no favoritism, and so it does not nurture the wicked for long—unlike the past, during times of internal disorder, when it could encompass and nurture evil people.\n\nI wish to hear the full explanation.\n\nWhen the Qi of wickedness and evil arises, it can nurture evil people for long but cannot nurture good people for long, for their harm is great and the good are few. It is like the arrival of bitter cold, when the Qi of heat declines. Now that the upright Qi has arrived, it cannot nurture evil people for long—like the arrival of Yang Qi, when Yin Qi dissipates.\n\nWhen the Great Yang’s crimson Qi ascends, it is the flourishing essence of fire. The ruler of fire shines above as the sun. The sun illuminates and examines the wicked, so they cannot act wrongly—thus, evil people are not tolerated.\n\nMoreover, the Dao governs life, virtue governs nurturing, and benevolence governs the mind’s use of love.

May I ask: now, when clouds rise from crumbling mountains, all is visible. Why then say it is imperceptible? I wished not to ask, but my heart was heavy with distress. Now I must ask fully. As your disciple, I am not modest, yet if I do not ask, I cannot attain understanding. Thus, I must ask without hesitation.\n\nVery well.

      "translated_text": "Be seated calmly, and I shall further expound for you.\nVery well, very well.\n\nFirst, in the study of the Dao: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nSecond, in the study of virtue: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nThird, in the study of benevolence: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nFourth, in the study of office: those of great attainment reside in Heaven, those of middling attainment reside among the divine spirits, and those of small attainment reside among men.\n\nFifth, in the love of amassing wealth and property: those who amass much reside in Heaven, those who amass a middling amount reside among the divine spirits, and those who amass little reside among men.\n\nThus, in these five matters—whether of great, middling, or small attainment—all depend on one’s effort. Surrender your fate to Heaven, return your virtue to Earth, and render your benevolence to men. Uphold these three principles.\n\nCultivate the self with a worthy heart and good intentions; ponder and reflect upon them, and the self may be perfected. Accumulate and gather them, and the spirits will naturally arise. Guard and nurture them, and the Dao will naturally be achieved. Delight in and cherish them, and the self will naturally flourish.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is neither partial nor distant; it bestows itself upon the good.\n\nThus, Heaven exerts itself to enact the Dao, completing one cycle each day. This daily cycle follows the pattern by which all things are born, modeling themselves upon the Six Jia, the Five Phases, and the Four Seasons. If even one qi fails to arrive, a thing will be incomplete, and its birth will be insufficient and unbalanced.\n\nFor one who would be a ruler, a superior, or a parent, such imbalance is a grave transgression.\n\nTherefore, Heaven completes one cycle each day, personally overseeing its enactment. It does so because, for instance, if you were Water, and the qi of Water were incomplete, the qi of the Five Phases and the Four Seasons would be insufficient. Thus, Heaven enacts and oversees the cycle:\n\nWhen Jia aligns above, there is the Phase of Wood and the qi of spring.\nWhen Bing aligns above, there is the Phase of Fire and the qi of summer.\nWhen Wu aligns above, there is the Phase of Earth and the qi of the four seasons’ center.\nWhen Geng aligns above, there is the Phase of Metal and the qi of autumn.\nWhen Ren aligns above, there is the Phase of Water and the qi of winter.\n\nWhen the Five Bodies are complete and the Four Qi are established, then all things may be born. When the transformations of Heaven and Earth are evenly bestowed, and the noble and the humble, the great and the small, are as one, there will be no contention or litigation—thus may one be a ruler or a parent.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao, virtue, and benevolence must model themselves upon this to align with the will of Heaven. They must not treat themselves lightly or act recklessly.\n\nThe Way of Heaven is thus established as a model—how much more so for man?\n\nTherefore, the superior person models Heaven and embodies the Dao; the middling person models Earth and embodies virtue; the inferior person models man and embodies benevolence. Those who fall below this are no longer counted among men and share the impermanent fate of birds, beasts, grasses, and trees.\n\nTrue person, having received my written teachings, you must deeply ponder their essential meaning. If you follow them without fail, you will harmonize with Heaven and partake in its work. Those who act contrary to my teachings are the enemies of Heaven and Earth, and I shall not tolerate them. What my written teachings revile is precisely what is correct.\n\nTrue person, be vigilant. Transmit this to the superior person, return it to the authorities, and show it to the common people. From this day forward, Heaven differs from ancient times.\n\nExcellent, excellent!",

Thus, the Great Yang’s work of giving life, nurturing, and growth is the most laborious—this is what it means.\n\nExcellent, excellent! Your foolish disciple has heard your decree again.",
