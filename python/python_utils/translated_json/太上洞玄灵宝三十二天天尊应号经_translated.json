  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Celestial Worthies’ Responsive Titles**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Celestial Worthies’ Responsive Titles*. Author unknown. Likely composed between the Sui and Tang dynasties. Originally twenty-six scrolls, detailing the invocation and veneration of the proper names and titles of the Thirty-Two Heavens. Only the twelfth and twenty-second scrolls survive. Source: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Taiping Section.\n\n*(Scrolls 1–11 originally missing)*\n\n**Scroll Twelve of *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Celestial Worthies’ Responsive Titles***\n\n**The Desire Realm**\n**The Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity**\n\nAt that time, within the assembly, an immortal named Brahma-Luminance rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, and advanced to inquire of the Heavenly Lord of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity:\n\n\"In former times, while attending upon the Celestial Worthy, I wandered through the numinous realms and witnessed the Dharma assembly—its wonders beyond conception. Yet the radiance of this day is unprecedented. The ranks of sacred perfected immortals ascend in joyous exultation, unable to contain themselves. The Celestial Worthies of the ten directions don crowns of dawn’s blossoms and robes of cloud-brocade, preaching in a single voice to deliver the gods and humans. To their left stand the supreme perfected immortals; to their right, the vajra-enforcers. Flying frost and purple mist, jade blossoms and sacred herbs, reverse winds and numinous incense—all ascend to veil the sun. At this responsive assembly, the rapture is ineffable. May all beings who partake in this find peace and bliss.\n\nYet I wonder: for the countless men and women of the lower realms, who through innumerable lives have accumulated habits that form their karma, how may they, through the causes and conditions of life after life, escape the trials of judgment? To what should they turn, that they might resolve their profound transgressions?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity replied: \"Your great compassion in pitying all beings for such causes and conditions is of immense merit. I shall explain for you—listen carefully and uphold this teaching.\n\nThe karmic retribution of beings is not of a single origin; only by universally entreating the true numina may they attain liberation. Now, I reveal the Celestial Worthies’ responsive titles from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Golden Flower Palace, to be shown to future generations. Guard this secret and do not recklessly divulge it. Devout men and women should diligently pay reverence, beseeching the erasure of their deep transgressions. Burn incense, light lamps, contemplate the spirits, and venerate the masters—all in accordance with the ritual statutes. Strike the celestial bell twelve times, swallow saliva thrice, regulate the voice and harmonize the qi, then chant the *Boundless Cavern Hymn*:\n\n*Luminous clarity nurtures blessings,*\n*That path reverses Dragon Mountain.*\n*Ah! The jade grove’s branches sway,*\n*Resplendent, the four quarters unfurl.*\n*Suddenly, the numinous kalpa transforms,*\n*As Hāmā spreads the stars.*\n*Flowing truth graces the three realms’ courts,*\n*Chanting and whistling, destiny’s toil arrives.*\n\nWithin the Golden Flower Palace of the Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity, from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Nine Qi Heaven of the Eastern Infinite Realm’s Hundred Celestial Worthies, compassionate responsive titles: through burning incense, fasting, and reverent worship, one may erase the records of the Nine Dark Prisons’ Jade Caskets of the Long Night, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like burdens of sin, and attaining boundless good karma.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, faithfully venerate:\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Tenfold Wondrous Light.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Eightfold Majestic Formation.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Permeation of

wholeheartedly take refuge and submit, prostrating before the Silver Tablets and Jade Records of the Golden Flower Palace, invoking the compassionate appellations of the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Eastern Boundless World, extolling and praising, chanting the cavernous scriptures, contemplating the divine and invoking the true, burning incense and lighting lamps, maintaining purity in quiet chambers—they may beseech the eradication of all sins from the beginningless kalpas to this present life, spanning both the living and the dead, the accumulated transgressions of deceitful and false speech. For the Ten Direct Gods of the East, the Heavenly Emperor’s Messengers, the Directors of Destiny and Recorders of Deeds, inscribe these sins in the ledgers, submitting them to the celestial courts, where they bind across lifetimes, unsevered and inescapable. These transgressions are bound in the Jade Casket of the Divine Officials’ Bureau in the Eastern Boundless World of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, and in the lower realms, examined in the Fengdu Hell of raging winds and surging waves, enduring kalpas of suffering without hope of liberation, their sins fully endured, with no prospect of return. For such transgressions, may all be eradicated, the Five Sufferings forever dissolved, body and soul at peace, clothing and sustenance naturally provided, and joyous ease attained. Above, this relies on the great compassion of the Celestial Worthies; below, it rewards the sincerity of men and women’s devotion. In the Golden Flower Palace of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, within the Silver Tablets and Jade Records, the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Southern Three Qi’s Boundless World compassionately respond to their invocations. Through burning incense, maintaining purity, reverent worship, and devout prayer, the Nine Dark Hells’ Jade Caskets of eternal night are erased, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like accumulation of sins, and securing boundless good karma.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Inner Tone’s Supreme Grade.\nWith

common men or women who, with wholehearted devotion, pay homage to the Purple Origin Treasure Repository of the Luminous Perfection Terrace’s Jade Slips and Mystic Scriptures, and invoke the compassionate appellations of the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Western Realm of Boundlessness, extolling and praising them, chanting the Cavern Chapters, contemplating the deities and invoking the Perfected, burning incense and lighting lamps in a pure and quiet chamber—then they may beseech the eradication of sins accumulated from kalpas without beginning, through lifetimes without end, within their family lineage, ancestral halls, ninefold kin and affinal relations, and all karmic entanglements, arising from the transgressions of secretly transmitting scriptures to disciples after having illicitly obtained them. These sins are recorded by the Ten Upright Deities of the West and the Directors of Destiny and Life Registers of the Great One, their offenses reported to the Heavenly Courts, binding them across lifetimes in inextricable knots.\n\nThe sins strike the Jade Casket of the Divine Officials’ Repository in the Western Realm of Boundlessness of No-Thought River Origin, descending to be examined by the Lower Origin’s Investigative Bureau of the Great Mystery’s Azure Records. Through kalpas of toil and suffering, there is no means of liberation, cycling endlessly without limit, dying and reviving, obscured and then enlightened, enduring manifold retributions and experiencing every strange form.\n\nMay such sins be wholly absolved, the Nine Dark Prisons dismissed from judgment, the Three Wretched Realms emptied, the eternal night illumined, and all beings roam freely in bliss—above, bearing the great mercy of the Heavenly Worthy; below, rewarded for the sincerity of men and women who submit their lives in devotion.\n\nUpon the Purple Origin Treasure Repository of the Jade Tablets of Mysterious Script within the Terrace of Luminous Perfection of the No-Thought River Origin Heaven, the One Hundred Heavenly Worthies of the Five Qi Heaven in the Northern Realm of the Boundless World respond to compassionate invocations. Through the burning of incense, fasting, and reverent worship, they erase the records of the Nine Dark Prisons from the Jade Caskets of Eternal Night, universally liberating beings of heaven and earth from suffering, dissolving the sins of Ganges’ sands, and securing the blessings of dust-mote multitudes.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, bow in faith to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Virtue and Sacred

Yet the radiance of this day is unprecedented. The ranks of sacred perfected immortals ascend in joyous exultation, unable to contain themselves. The Celestial Worthies of the ten directions don crowns of dawn’s blossoms and robes of cloud-brocade, preaching in a single voice to deliver the gods and humans. To their left stand the supreme perfected immortals; to their right, the vajra-enforcers. Flying frost and purple mist, jade blossoms and sacred herbs, reverse winds and numinous incense—all ascend to veil the sun. At this responsive assembly, the rapture is ineffable. May all beings who partake in this find peace and bliss.\n\nYet I wonder: for the countless men and women of the lower realms, who through innumerable lives have accumulated habits that form their karma, how may they, through the causes and conditions of life after life, escape the trials of judgment? To what should they turn, that they might resolve their profound transgressions?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Lord of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity replied: \"Your great compassion in pitying all beings for such causes and conditions is of immense merit. I shall explain for you—listen carefully and uphold this teaching.\n\nThe karmic retribution of beings is not of a single origin; only by universally entreating the true numina may they attain liberation. Now, I reveal the Celestial Worthies’ responsive titles from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Golden Flower Palace, to be shown to future generations. Guard this secret and do not recklessly divulge it. Devout men and women should diligently pay reverence, beseeching the erasure of their deep transgressions. Burn incense, light lamps, contemplate the spirits, and venerate the masters—all in accordance with the ritual statutes. Strike the celestial bell twelve times, swallow saliva thrice, regulate the voice and harmonize the qi, then chant the *Boundless Cavern Hymn*:\n\n*Luminous clarity nurtures blessings,*\n*That path reverses Dragon Mountain.*\n*Ah! The jade grove’s branches sway,*\n*Resplendent, the four quarters unfurl.*\n*Suddenly, the numinous kalpa transforms,*\n*As Hāmā spreads the stars.*\n*Flowing truth graces the three realms’ courts,*\n*Chanting and whistling, destiny’s toil arrives.*\n\nWithin the Golden Flower Palace of the Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Youthful Purity, from the Silver Tablets and Jade Registers of the Nine Qi Heaven of the Eastern Infinite Realm’s Hundred Celestial Worthies, compassionate responsive titles: through burning incense, fasting, and reverent worship, one may erase the records of the Nine Dark Prisons’ Jade Caskets of the Long Night, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like burdens of sin, and attaining boundless good karma.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, faithfully venerate:\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Tenfold Wondrous Light.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Eightfold Majestic Formation.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Permeation of the Dao’s Assembly.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Lofty Emptiness’s Dao in Motion.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Lofty Radiance in Motion.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Threefold Flower of the Western Numinous Realm.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Serene Abiding and Eternal Presence.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Utmost Splendor’s Luminous Brilliance.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Dao’s Fourfold Brahma Heavens.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the True Dao’s Illuminating Deliverance.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the True Treasure’s Quiescent Stillness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Sacred Perfected Eastern Florescence.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Precept-Born Cavern Mystery.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Serene Abiding and Radiant Unity.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Four Heavens’ Lofty Reverence.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Wisdom’s Emptiness in Motion.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Southern Culmen’s Cavern Luminance.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Profound Mystery’s Preservation.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Threefold Flower’s Sacred Perfection.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Three Heavens’ Supreme.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Wisdom’s Merit Revealing Clarity.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Golden Radiance’s Quiescent Stillness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Plain Permeation’s Wondrous Joy.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Primal Chaos’s Supreme Unity.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Unobstructed Cavern Emptiness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Immortals’ Dao in Primal Chaos.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Myriad Wonders’ Expedient Means.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Wondrous Motion’s Luminous Transformation.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Fourfold Luminance’s Carefree Wandering.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Expedient Means and Right Wisdom.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Utmost Dao’s Wisdom and Clarity.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Golden Scripture’s Quiescent Stillness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Vermilion Garden’s Wondrous Splendor.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Three Heavens’ Mysterious Awakening.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Responsive Wonders’ Illuminating Light.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Purple Perfected Southern Luminance.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Dharma King’s Empty Sovereign.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Treasure Scripture’s Upper Prime.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Upper Prime’s Radiance in Motion.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Earthly Sovereign’s Eightfold Simplicity.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Cause, Effect, and Blessed Fortune.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Northern Perfected Wondrous Light.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Vermilion Reflection’s Mysterious Origin.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Empty Quiescence’s Cavern Wisdom.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Supreme Mystery’s Supreme Ultimate.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Lofty Perfected Savior of Lives.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Luminous Response to Imperial Destiny.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Expedient Means and Skillful Goodness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Wondrous Countenance’s Transformative Completion.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Radiant Motion’s True Vastness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Myriad Wonders’ True Emptiness.\nThe Celestial Worthy of Lofty Motion’s Vast Luminance.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Cavern Nature’s Empty Quiescence.\nThe Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Origin’s Eternal Joy.\"",

These transgressions are bound in the Jade Casket of the Divine Officials’ Bureau in the Eastern Boundless World of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, and in the lower realms, examined in the Fengdu Hell of raging winds and surging waves, enduring kalpas of suffering without hope of liberation, their sins fully endured, with no prospect of return. For such transgressions, may all be eradicated, the Five Sufferings forever dissolved, body and soul at peace, clothing and sustenance naturally provided, and joyous ease attained. Above, this relies on the great compassion of the Celestial Worthies; below, it rewards the sincerity of men and women’s devotion. In the Golden Flower Palace of the Clear Brightness and Youthful Youth Heaven, within the Silver Tablets and Jade Records, the one hundred Celestial Worthies of the Southern Three Qi’s Boundless World compassionately respond to their invocations. Through burning incense, maintaining purity, reverent worship, and devout prayer, the Nine Dark Hells’ Jade Caskets of eternal night are erased, universally liberating humans and gods from suffering, dissolving the dust-like accumulation of sins, and securing boundless good karma.\n\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Inner Tone’s Supreme Grade.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Golden Palace’s Wondrous Quiescence.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of Liberation’s Constant Radiance.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Three Clarities’ Dharma King.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Precious Life’s Jade Perfection.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Western Luminance’s Lofty Sage.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Golden Mystery’s Wondrous Splendor.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Jeweled Capital’s Dharma Treasure.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Earthly August One’s Azure Perfection.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Wondrous Fruit’s Cinnabar Fruit.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Precepts’ Birth of True Perfection.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Empty Immortals’ Dharma Ocean.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Purple Clarity’s Pervasive Light.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the August Emperor’s Lofty Victory.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Vermilion Chariot’s Wondrous Splendor.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Majestic Light’s Pure Luminance.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Great Dao’s Transformative Luminance.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of Transformative Quiescence’s Responsive Manifestation.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of True Emptiness’ Virtue and Response.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of True Luminance’s Supreme Void.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the True Grade’s Pervasive Moistening.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Cinnabar and Purple’s Wondrous Primacy.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Jade Reflection’s Dharma Ocean.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Illuminating Light’s Immortal Spirits.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Mysterious Response’s Salvific Luminance.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Flying Immortals’ Supreme Spirits.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Universal Constant Salvation.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Middle Grade’s True Awakening.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Eternal Joy’s Expedient Means.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Ninefold Light’s Great Cavern.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Azure Florescence’s Dharma Vessel.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Death-Transcending Sage King.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Luminous Light’s Jade Radiance.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Wondrous Light’s Orthodox Dharma.\nWith wholehearted devotion, I pay homage to the Celestial Worthy of the Jeweled Splendor’s Dharma Ocean.",

without end, within their family lineage, ancestral halls, ninefold kin and affinal relations, and all karmic entanglements, arising from the transgressions of secretly transmitting scriptures to disciples after having illicitly obtained them.
