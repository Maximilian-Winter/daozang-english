Or again, households stricken by pestilence, bodies tainted by noxious qi, afflicted with grave or minor ailments, kin perishing, wealth dissipating. Such manifold sufferings all arise from the baleful qi of the Six Heavens, the Lord of Northern Fengdu, the Eight Demon Marshals, the Death Generals of the mortal realm, and the deities of the Five Peaks, who traverse the world, seizing upon transgressions to unleash their poisonous qi and slay the wicked. From year’s end to month’s close, countless have fallen prey, entangled in one another’s doom, leading to their deaths. No one among the people can escape—how grievous and lamentable!\n\nI dispatch mighty spirits to spread across the world, patrolling to deliver and save, yet who among men knows this? Now I once more declare unto you the wondrous, inconceivable methods of salvation by the Great Divine General Zhenwu, whose responses are divinely efficacious.\n\nThe Perfected One implored, “O Great Compassion, Great Mercy! For the sake of all beings, I beseech you to bestow your teachings.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied, “On the Three Yuan festivals, the Eight Nodal Days, the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, and the third, seventh, and tenth days of each month—these appointed times of descent—abstain from pungent offerings and impure meats. Curb the six senses, banish wayward thoughts, and attain purity. Burn incense, observe the fast, recite the Dao, and surrender your fate to the Forty-Nine Venerable Heavenly Worthies of the Northern Realm. First repent for your own transgressions, openly confess your sins, and dissolve all karmic offenses to avert calamities. From water, fire, blades, and warfare, from tigers, wolves, venomous beasts, malevolent spirits, and spectral apparitions, you shall forever be spared.\n\nToday, with heartfelt devotion, I reverently embrace these mysterious words. You must earnestly venerate the sacred names of these emanations. May this merit broadly deliver all beings and universally ferry them across.\n\nI, so-and-so, have dwelt in this world for countless kalpas, sunk in the mire of sin and suffering, yet to attain liberation. Today, for such-and-such a purpose, I prostrate myself in this repentance rite, body and limbs pressed to the earth, wholeheartedly invoking:\n\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious and Potent Kan and Kui.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Watchtower’s Emanation.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sunlight’s Auspicious Response.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Yin’s Divine Transformation.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Radiant Martial Star.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Embryonic Splendor of Xu and Wei.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Perfect True Appearance.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Solemn and Majestic Power.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Vows to Sever Demonic Hordes.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Assists the Jade Emperor.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmonious Purity and Joy.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Accumulates Merit to Attain Sagehood.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Divine Vision.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Aid and Compliance.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Presence and Responsive Power.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme and Wondrous Conduct.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Merit Rises Above the Dragon Han.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Manifests Divine Power in the Upper Realm.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Might Extends Over the Nine Earths.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Virtue Subdues the Five Peaks.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Unspoken Benevolent Response.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Unhindered Divine Power.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Pacifies the Six Cave-Heavens.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Purifies the World.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Aids the Revival of the Central Realm.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Nurtures the Multitudes.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Perfects and Propagates Wondrous Transformations.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Ever Abides to Protect the World.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Transformations Pervade the Six Directions.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Whose Grace Moistens the Myriad Beings.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Autonomous and Sovereign Power.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Divine Might.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Brings Peace to the Realm.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Subdues Demons and Upholds the Precepts.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Proclaims the Dharma on Heaven’s Behalf.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Guards the Body.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Dispels Ghosts and Eradicates Malevolent Spirits.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma Cloud’s Flowing Moisture.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Universal Compassion and State Protection.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Blessings and Preserves the Spirit.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Resolves Grievances and Relieves Suffering.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Ever Contemplates Deliverance of Beings.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Eradicates Transgressions.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves the Living and Raises the Dead.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Protects Souls with Compassionate Salvation.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Safeguards Homes and Pacifies the Realm.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Might and Virtue.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Natural True Ultimate.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Heavenly Worthy Who Dispels Disasters and Bestows Blessings.\nWith utmost reverence, I bow to the Divine Host of the Mysterious Heaven.\n\nI, so-and-so, wholeheartedly surrender my spirit, body, and fate to the Forty-Nine Venerable Heavenly Worthies of the Great Dao of the Northern Realm and all the divine hosts.\n\nAlas! The human body is hard to obtain, and encountering the true Dharma is even rarer. The Way of Heaven cherishes life, yet few complete their allotted years. Contemplating the six senses’ unenlightenment, I see the five blessings ever lacking. All dwell beneath the canopy of heaven and earth, yet emerge from the potter’s hand of fate. Some, though impoverished, have many children; others, though wealthy, are childless. Just as they begin to enjoy life, they suddenly lose their allotted span; before they grasp cultivation, their fortune is already spent. Some perish by the sword, their bones left to bleach; others die in childbirth, their bodies harmed. Some are deceived by malevolent spirits; others are chastised by Heaven. Such manifold karmic retributions, such varied causes and conditions—yet all they know is to chase profit and covet fame, heedless of deceiving Heaven and defrauding Earth. They neglect precepts and lack hidden merits. When their time comes, they sigh in vain, for when trouble strikes, they have no recourse.\n\nI deeply fear that in this lifetime and across three existences, I have been unfilial and disloyal, committed adultery and theft, harbored heavy greed and wrath, amassed sins of killing, spoken falsely, and been deluded and obstinate. The five grave offenses lie within me; with a forked tongue, I have slandered others. I dread the unending torments of hell and fear the celestial records of my deeds.”\n\nBound to the torments of birth and death, the dark ledgers’ stains endure. Looking up, I rely on the grace of the Most Sacred, that all transgressions across many lives be fully absolved. Next, may grievous spirits disperse, the living and the dead part ways; may the departed transcend and be reborn, the living attain felicity. May the Nine Dark Realms cease their accusations, and the world know peace. May all sentient beings receive deliverance, together ascend the Dao’s shore, and realize entry into the Unconditioned.\n\nWe, your servants, bow our heads in reverence, offering homage to the Supreme Void Sovereign, the True and Perfect Three Treasures.\n\nHere concludes the *Precious Repentance of Zhenwu, Numinous and Responsive, Protector of the World, Dispeller of Disasters and Eradicator of Sins*.",
