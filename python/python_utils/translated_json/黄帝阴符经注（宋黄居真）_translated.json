  "full_translation": "**\"The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *The Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing* Commentary\n**Author:** *Huáng Qūzhēn* (attributed), likely composed in the Northern Song Dynasty.\n**Recorded in:** *Comprehensive Records of the Arts and Literature* (《通志艺文略》).\n**Volume:** One scroll.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (《正统道藏》), *Tongzhen* (洞真) section, *Yujue* (玉诀) category.\n**The Yellow Emperor’s *Yinfu Jing* Commentary** – *Xūjìng* (虚靖) Master, the Purple Robe Daoist *Huáng Qūzhēn* (黄居真), made this commentary.\n\n**The Dao of Heaven, grasping Heaven’s movements—exhausted are they.**\nThe *Yijing* (《易》) says: *\"Observe Heaven’s divine Dao, and the four seasons will not falter.\"* It also says: *\"What ends must begin again—this is the Way of Heaven.\"*\n\nHeaven’s Dao flows but does not accumulate, hence the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are bound to it.\nHeaven’s movements are vigorous yet unceasing, thus the four seasons and myriad things arise from them.\nThe **perfected sage**, when observing its flow, aligns with it in endless circulation;\nwhen grasping its movements, harmonizes with it in eternal beginning and end.\n**Ebb and swell, fullness and emptiness—none can defy them.**\n**Breathing and extension, contraction and repose—never without their influence.**\nAt rest, he shares **virtue/power** with *yin*; in motion, he rides the waves with *yang*.\nIf such is the case, what further need be added?\nThus it is said: *\"The Dao of Heaven, grasping Heaven’s movements—exhausted are they.\"*\n\nHeaven has **five bandits**—those who see them prosper.\nThe **five bandits** dwell within the mind yet manifest in Heaven’s operations.\nHumans are born from the *qi* of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water,\nand also die from the *qi* of metal, wood, earth, water, and fire.\nFrom the perspective of the **perfected sage**,\nwhat joy is there in birth? What harm in death?\nThat which gives me life is also that which brings my ruin.\nKnowing their workings, discerning their shifts—\nmetal and wood never truly obstruct each other,\nwater and fire never truly oppose each other.\nWhen the five align and blend as one,\nthen alone does one endure and remain whole forever.\nWhy should one weigh birth and death?\n\nTo follow is Heaven’s **virtue/power**; to oppose is the **bandit**.\nTheir origins lie in the mind’s own choices,\nyet their manifestation occurs through Heaven’s operations.\n**The cosmos lies within the hand;**\n**all transformations arise from the body.**\nTo close the door is called *yǔ* (宇);\nto open the door is called *zhòu* (宙).\nThe cosmos is the greatest of all,\nyet it never strays beyond my grasp—\nI can make it so that no calamity befalls me,\nhow much more so for lesser things?\n**Growth and decay, movement and stillness—**\nthese are the myriad things of change,\nyet they never leave the confines of my hundred limbs.\nI can make them free from Heaven’s **blockages** and **faults**,\nhow much more so for the few?\n\nHeaven’s nature—**humanity** (*rén*).\nThe human mind—**the mechanism** (*jī*).\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao is to **settle** humanity;\nHeaven and humanity are never truly separate—\nonly the **perfected sage** attains this.\nTo fully embody Heaven’s nature is called **humanity** (*rén*);\nto master the human mind is called **the mechanism** (*jī*).\nWhen Heaven’s nature is exhausted,\nthen the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) are complete;\nwhen the mind’s mechanism is illuminated,\nthen one becomes the **master of all things** (*wù zǎi*).\n\nAt rest and returning to the root,\none remains **serene and ever tranquil** (*zhànrán chángjì*).\nIn motion and responding to change,\none **turns and transforms without end** (*wòxuán wúqióng*).\nTo **unleash the human** and **settle Heaven**,\nto **settle Heaven** and **unleash the human**—\nthen the **profound and manifest** are in secret harmony,\nand **transformations** become visible.\n\nIf one cannot establish Heaven’s Dao,\nthen the mind’s impulses will never cease,\nand its outward expressions—\nhow could they not be perilous?\nCan birds **align in fixed postures** (*xiāngyú dìng*)?\nThus it is said: *\"To establish Heaven’s Dao is to settle humanity.\"*\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism** (*shā jī*),\ndragons and snakes rise upon the land.\nWhen humanity unleashes the **killing mechanism**,\nHeaven and Earth **reverse and overturn**.\nWhen Heaven and humanity **unleash together**,\nall transformations are settled by the mechanism.\n**Natures** have skill or clumsiness,\nwhich can be **concealed and hidden**.\nTo **transform and adapt**—this is what the mechanism does.\nHeaven effects change without speech,\nand the mechanism is truly great.\n\nThe **perfected sage who establishes Heaven**—\ncan humanity be without the mechanism?\nYet the mechanism of the mind is not the **ultimate mechanism**;\nthe mechanism without the mind is the **ultimate mechanism** (*jī de jí*).\nThe mechanism moves here,\ntransformations take form there—\nall in their natural course.\nThus when Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism**,\nrivers can become land, land can become rivers;\nwhen humanity unleashes the **killing mechanism**,\none can **transcend Heaven’s inability to bear**,\nand **transcend Earth’s inability to cover**—\nthe mechanisms of Heaven and humanity reach their peak here.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the killing mechanism is unleashed by Heaven and humanity,\nthe Three Powers are at ease,\nand all transformations are settled by it—\nwho can escape my mechanism?\"*\n\nThough this is so,\nthe mind arises from **nature**,\nthe mechanism from the mind.\nThe **skilled**—humanity;\nthe **clumsy**—Heaven.\nTo **obscure the mind and restore nature**,\neven the greatest mechanism can be concealed.\nThe **nine orifices’** evils lie in the **three keys** (*sān yào*),\nwhich can be **mastered in motion and stillness**.\nThe ear’s **distraction by sound**,\nthe eye’s **distraction by color**,\nthe nose’s **distraction by odor**,\nthe mouth’s **distraction by taste**—\nand the **transformations of water and grain**—\nall are **evils of yin and yang**.\nAmong these nine,\nthe **three keys** are essential:\nthe ear, the eye, and the mouth.\n\nThe ear’s **delusion by sound**,\nthe eye’s **delusion by color**,\nthe mouth’s **delusion by taste**—\nthese are the most severe of evils.\nThe **sage** can make the nine orifices\nnot **control** him,\nthus it is said:\n*\"Only the sage can truly embody the form,\nin motion yet evils cannot overcome him,\nat rest yet evils cannot enter him—\nmotion is acceptable, stillness is acceptable.\"*\nThus it is said: *\"One can act in motion, one can act in stillness.\"*\n\nFire arises from wood,\nand **calamity** (*huò*) must be **checked** (*kè*) when it emerges.\n**Deceit** (*jiān*) arises from the state,\nand **rebellion** (*kuì*) must be **broken** (*kuì*) when its time comes.\nFire can indeed **check wood**,\nbut when it is **restrained by water**,\nthen fire cannot act—\ncalamity must first emerge before it can be checked.\nDeceit can indeed **break the state**,\nbut when it is **overcome by righteousness** (*zhèng*),\nthen deceit cannot act—\nrebellion must first arise before it can be shattered.\n\nThus one knows:\nthe **evils of yin and yang**,\nthe **arising of deceit and rebellion**—\nall require **what they await** before they must necessarily occur.\nTo **know and refine** this is to be called the **sage**.\n\nTo know Heaven’s operations,\nto know humanity’s operations,\nto know stillness and **restoring nature**,\nto know motion and **the mechanism**,\nto know the **endlessness of all transformations**,\nto know the **three keys** among the nine evils—\nthen one **clears and quiets**,\nwandering through the **domain of the spirit** (*shén tíng*).\n**Only the origin, only silence**—\nthis is the **ultimate attainment of the Dao** (*dào de jí*).\"\n\n「Thus, when one cultivates to the point of **not clashing with the crafty** (*lìng*),\nand refines to the point of **not conflicting with things**,\none remains **serene and simple**, holding to **Oneness** alone.\n\nThe **sage** or the **able one** who attains this,\ncannot be moved by **creation and transformation** (*zào huà*),\nnor constrained by Heaven and Earth—\nto **enrich the state and secure the people** (*fù guó ān mín*),\nto **strengthen the army and win battles** (*qiáng bīng zhàn shèng*),\nthese are but trifles in their hands.\n\nHeaven gives life, Heaven takes life—\nthis is the **principle of the Dao** (*dào zhī lǐ*).\nWhen **yang** expands once, all things cannot but be born;\nwhen **yin** contracts once, all things cannot but be slain.\nThey are born and slain of their own accord—\nwho compels them thus?\nThe Dao’s operations are such.\n\nIf one cannot **respond to this principle** (*wù néng*),\nthen even Heaven’s way of being Heaven would be diminished.\nYet Heaven has no **intent**—\nit merely **takes what is due** (*xián zì qǔ*).\nHence it is said: **\"This is the Dao’s principle.\"**\n\nHeaven and Earth are the **\"great thieves\"** of all things;\nAll things are the **\"thieves\"** of humankind;\nHumankind are the **\"thieves\"** of all things.\nWhen the **three thefts** are **properly aligned** (*sān dào jí yí*),\nthe **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) are **established in harmony**.\nHence it is said:\n**\"To eat in accordance with the seasons** (*shí qí shí*),\n**the hundred bones** (*bǎi huái*) are in order.\nTo **move with the mechanism** (*dòng qí jī*),\n**all transformations** are at peace.\nHeaven and Earth are the **greatest forms** (*xíng zhī dà zhě*),\nHeaven provides **qi** (*yì*) to nurture the beginning of all things,\nEarth provides **form** (*xíng*) to nurture their growth.\nHumankind and all things cannot escape the **covering canopy** (*fù zǎi zhī jiān*),\neach **depending on the other** (*xiāng yǒu yǐ xiāng chéng*),\neach **failing if the other is absent** (*xiāng wú yǐ xiāng fèi*).\nThey are **unable to stand alone**.\n\nMoreover, what they **do not possess** yet **take** is called theft—\nHeaven and Earth do not steal from all things,\nyet without them, the **Dao of endless transformations** cannot be fulfilled.\nAll things do not steal from humankind,\nyet without them, the **effect of proliferation** cannot be achieved.\nHumankind do not steal from all things,\nyet without them, the **function of nourishment** cannot be complete.\nWhy so?\nIf Heaven and Earth, being vast,\ndo not **begin and end with all things**,\nthen Heaven would **perish in peril** (*jī hū pà*).\nHence they are the **thieves of all things**.\nIf all things, being numerous,\ndo not **have humankind to assist and nurture them**,\nthen they would **perish in peril** (*jī hū nì*).\nHence they are the **thieves of humankind**.\nIf humankind, being **spiritually endowed** (*líng*),\ndo not **have all things to sustain and nourish them**,\nthen they would **perish in peril** (*jī hū tiāo*).\nHence they are the **thieves of all things**.\n**Mutual theft** is what makes them **properly aligned**.\nHence it is said:\nWhen the **three thefts** are **properly aligned** (*sān dào jí yí*),\nthen the **Three Powers**—Heaven, Earth, and humankind—\nstand **thus established**.\n\nHumankind knows their **spirit** (*shén*),\nbut does not know that their **non-spirit** is what makes them **spiritual** (*shén*).\nThe **spirit’s operations** are indeed wondrous—\nif one can **discern its form** (*yì qí zhuàng*),\nthen it is not wondrous—\nthis is the **ultimate of spirit** (*shén zhī zhì*).\nThe *Yì* says:\n**\"The spirit**—this is the **wondrous principle** of all things,\nand **speech** (*yán*) is what it **expresses** (*wéi yán*).\nIs this not what is meant by ‘humankind knows their spirit’?\"**\nIt further says:\n**\"Not hasty yet swift,\nnot walking yet arriving**—\nis this not what is meant by ‘humankind does not know\nthat their non-spirit is what makes them spiritual’?\"**\n\nThe sun and moon have their **fixed cycles** (*shù*),\nthe small and great have their **fixed measures** (*dìng*).\nFrom these **sage’s achievements** arise,\nand from these **spiritual mechanisms** emerge.\nThe sun moves swiftly—\nit completes one **circuit of Heaven** (*zhōu tiān*) in a day;\nthe moon moves slowly—\nit completes one **circuit of Heaven** in a month.\nSwiftness and slowness have their **natural degrees** (*zì rán zhī dù*),\nwhich cannot be **exceeded** (*bù kě yú*).\n\nThat things are not uniform is their **nature** (*qíng*).\nThe **soaring pheonix** (*guāng féng*) and **great eagle** (*píng*) are vast,\nthe **wren** (*jiāo liú*) is small—\neach **finds its place** in the **nature of life and death** (*xìng mìng zhī qíng*).\nSmall and great have their **natural measures** (*zì rán zhī liàng*),\nwhich cannot be **changed** (*bù kě yì*).\n\nTo **understand the natural cycles** (*míng hū zì rán zhī shù*),\nto **harmonize with the small and great** (*yī hū xiǎo dà zhī liàng*),\nto **remain still and achieve the sage-ruler’s power** (*jìng ér shèng wáng zhī gōng*),\nto **grasp the subtleties and unlock the spirit’s mechanisms** (*miào ér shén míng zhī jī*),\nthis is where **attainment** lies.\n\nAs for **stealing the mechanism** (*dào qí jī*),\nnone under Heaven can **see** or **know** it.\nThe **gentleperson** who **holds fast to it** (*yù zhōng*) remains unharmed,\nwhile the **petty person** who **seizes it** (*qǐng mìng*) risks their life.\nHeaven and Earth **steal from all things** to **perfect transformation’s subtleties**,\nall things **steal from humankind** to **achieve proliferation’s effect**,\nhumankind **steal from all things** to **fulfill the function of nourishment**—\nall are **natural mechanisms**.\n\nThese **natural mechanisms** are **operated by the spirit** (*shén zhī yùn*),\nyet who **directs and controls** them?\nWho **governs and upholds** them?\nIt seems there is a **hidden mechanism** (*jī guī*) within,\nyet none can **halt it on their own** (*zì yǐ*).\nThe people of the world **use it daily without knowing**—\nhow could they **perceive its subtleties** (*wū dǔ qí wēi*)?\nThe **gentleperson’s mechanism aligns with the spirit** (*jūn zǐ jī yǔ shén qì*),\nstillness **unites with the subtleties of yin and yang** (*jìng hé yīn yáng zhī miào*),\nthus they **preserve their life**.\nThe **petty person’s mechanism conflicts with the spirit** (*xiǎo rén jī yǔ shén wéi*),\naction **follows the shifting of mechanisms** (*dòng wéi jī biàn zhī xíng*),\nthus they **meet their fate** (*shì suǒ qīng zhī mìng*).\nTo **understand the mechanism of theft** (*míng hū dào qí jī*),\nthen the people will be **at peace** and the state **prosper**.\n\nThe **blind** excel in hearing,\nthe **deaf** excel in sight.\nIf one’s **intent** (*yòng zhì*) is **not divided** (*bù fēn*),\nthen it **unites with the spirit** (*yǔ shén wéi yī*).\nThough the blind cannot see,\ntheir hearing **gathers much knowledge** (*duō wén*),\nwhy must they **rely on their eyes** (*dá bì yòng mù*)?\nThough the deaf cannot hear,\ntheir sight **gathers much perception** (*duō jiàn*),\nwhy must they **rely on their ears** (*dá bì yòng ěr*)?\nEars can **make one discerning** (*cōng rén*),\nbut also **make one deaf**;\neyes can **make one enlightened** (*míng rén*),\nbut also **make one blind**.\nThe **sage** does not **use vision and hearing through ears and eyes** (*shèng rén shì tīng bì yòng ěr mù*),\nthus their **discernment and enlightenment** grow ever broader.\nThe **common folk** must **use vision and hearing through ears and eyes** (*zhòng rén shì tīng bì yòng ěr mù*),\neven if they possess them—\nhow are they different from the **deaf and blind**?\nIs it not so that the **spirit’s dwelling** (*shén zhī yù*) lies\nnot **within the ears and eyes** (*fú zài ěr mù*)?\n\nTo **cut off one source of profit** (*jué lì yī yuán*),\none **can employ ten times the troops** (*shì yòng shī shí bèi*).\nTo **reverse the fortunes of day and night three times** (*sān fǎn zhòu yè*),\none **can employ ten thousand times the troops** (*shì yòng shī wàn bèi*).\nEven **feasting and eating** must **bring disputes** (*yǐn shí bì yǒu chǎo*),\nhence one **receives them with disputes** (*shòu zhī yǐ chǎo*).\nDisputes must **arise from the masses** (*chǎo bì yóu zhòng qǐ*),\nhence one **receives them with the troops** (*shòu zhī yǐ shī*).\nWhen the **troops are raised** (*shī zhī xīng*),\nit is **due to disputes**.\nWhen **disputes arise** (*chǎo zhī zuò*),\nit is **due to feasting and eating**.\nFeasting and eating are **trivial matters** (*xiǎo yì*),\nyet the **troops are truly rooted in these**.\n\nWhat of **greater profits**?\nThe **sage** does not **repeat the raising of troops** (*bù chóng xīng shī*),\nbut **prizes greed for profit** (*zhòng tān lì*).\nIf one truly **cuts off one source of profit**,\nand **prevents myriad openings and flaws** (*qiān máo wàn kǒng bù zuò*),\nthen their **accumulation grows ever deeper** (*suǒ jī yì hòu*).\nHow could the people **not be at peace**?\nHow could the state **not prosper**?\n\nTo **employ the troops in this manner** (*yǐ cǐ yòng shī*),\none **can use ten as one hundred**,\none hundred as one thousand,\none thousand as ten thousand—\nhence it is said: **\"ten times the force.\"**\nThis **Dao**—\nif one **knows it** yet **cannot practice it**,\nif one **practices it** yet **cannot uphold it firmly** (*bù néng shǒu zhī gù*),\nbut if one **practices it with sincerity** (*dù*),\nand **holds fast to it resolutely** (*shǒu zhī gù*),\nthen even if **day and night are reversed three times** (*zhòu yè jiān sān fǎn*),\nthey **will not perish** (*bù dài*).\nThen again, this would be **ten thousand times the force** in employing troops—\nwhy **exhaust my people** and **drain my wealth** (*liáo wú zhī mín jié wú zhī cái*),\nto **take others’ profit as my own** (*qǔ bǐ zhī lì wéi wǒ zhī lì*)?\n\n「The Way is naturally without armies yet strong,\nwithout battle yet victorious.\nThe mind arises from things and perishes with things—\nits mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe Sage sees the Dao yet not things,\nso his mind never arises, never perishes;\nThe common folk see things yet not the Dao,\nso their minds arise from things and perish with things.\n\nThe Sage rules heaven and earth with his fingers and palms,\nguides the ten thousand transformations within his mind—\nall through the movement of spirit and the workings of the heart,\nthus he can receive things as effortlessly as market transactions,\nhis heart as still as water,\nwhen the true mechanism unfolds,\nhe is not deceived by things.\n\nBut men differ from this:\nthey see what they desire and their minds are unsettled,\ntheir mechanisms are shallow indeed.\n\nHeaven, though lacking favor, gives rise to great favor.\nSwift thunder and violent winds—\nnone escape its influence.\nThe four seasons proceed in their own order,\nyin and yang create in their own way—\nHeaven acts without doing yet accomplishes all things.\nWhen things arise, flourish, decline, or perish,\nit is by their own nature,\nwhat favor does Heaven bestow?\nBecause Heaven lacks favor,\nno thing can harm it—\nthis is the true source of its great favor.\n\nYet even so,\nthings cannot generate themselves;\nthey must await something.\nThunder stirs them, wind moves them—\nall respond in unison.\n\nThe utmost joy lies in the nature’s ease,\nthe utmost stillness is pure and untainted.\nDoes the world have such great joy?\nAll things are complete within me—\nreturning to sincerity within oneself,\nno joy surpasses this—\nfor within the divisions of nature,\nit is said: \"I do not depend on the external.\"\n\nThe world’s restless pursuers,\nwhen they see something,\ngenerate covetous hearts;\nwhen they find joy,\ngenerate exultant hearts.\nBut the Perfect One’s joy differs from this—\nthus it is called *nature’s ease*.\n\nFortune and misfortune,\nregret and blame,\narise from movement.\nMovement cannot be free of entanglement—\nhow can it be pure?\nThe Perfect One dwells in steadfast stillness,\nwhere nothing can be used or not used—\nwhat entanglements remain?\nThus it is said:\nGreat purity knows no entanglement,\nunless one attains utmost stillness,\nhow can this be achieved?\n\nHeaven’s utmost particularity\nmanifests as utmost universality.\nGreat artifice does not serve things—\nall things are complete,\nclouds move and rain falls,\nthunder roars and wind flies—\ndoes it have a heart?\nWhen things are allowed to thrive and flourish,\nit is called *virtue*—\nthus it is said:\nUniversality and particularity,\nthe virtue of heaven and earth.\nThose that fly or run,\nthose that move or rest,\nall take their own course.\nAll things say: \"Heaven favors me,\"\ngranting me this existence—\ndoes Heaven carve and shape things?\nThis is called *utmost universality*.\n\nThe nature of birds is determined by *qi*.\nWater and fire have their own checks and balances,\nyet no extinguishing power—\nit is the *qi* that responds,\nnaturally so, without intention.\n\nTo check one form with another,\ngreat and small are not in harmony,\nso the great always prevail,\nthe small always falter.\nThe tortoise devours the python,\nthe flying squirrel severs the monkey—\nis it by form alone?\nIt is the *qi* that submits.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nWhat lives here may not die there,\nwhat dies there may not live here.\nThe Perfect One transcends the realm of existence and non-existence,\nleaving behind the domains of movement and stillness—\nso life brings no delight,\ndeath brings no revulsion—\nwhat bonds or entanglements remain?\n\nRoots are like a tree’s roots:\nspring and summer come first,\nand it flourishes;\nautumn and winter come last,\nand it withers.\nBut if you call it the root and trunk,\nthen there is neither life nor death.\n\nMan is ensnared by form,\nentangled by numbers—\nalso like a tree’s roots.\nFavor arises from harm,\nharm arises from favor.\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—\nthey treat all things as fodder for the gods;\nThe Sage is not kind—\nhe treats the people as fodder for the gods.\nTrue kindness is the very reason for not being kind—\nonly Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are thus,\nnot the narrow, private granting or withholding of power.\n\nYet Heaven’s domain is not yet divided,\nthe Sage’s presence not yet revealed—\nwhat of kindness or unkindness?\nKindness and unkindness\nare merely observed from things.\n\nThe foolish man calls Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*,\nI say the patterns and principles of time and things are *wise*.\nCommon and ignorant,\nthey lack true understanding—\nthey follow yin and yang,\nare enslaved by creation.\nThey see only the dazzling changes of Heaven and Earth,\nand the clear, orderly principles of Heaven and Earth.\nDim and obscured,\nthey do not know what sustains them—\nthus they call Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*.\n\nBut the Perfect One differs:\nthe movement of time is endless,\nyet I follow it without resistance;\nthings generate without end,\nyet I align with them without opposition.\nTheir interplay creates patterns,\ntheir interweaving creates principles—\nthus it is said:\nI call the patterns and principles of time and things *wise*.」",

What harm in death?\nThat which gives me life is also that which brings my ruin.\nKnowing their workings, discerning their shifts—\nmetal and wood never truly obstruct each other,\nwater and fire never truly oppose each other.\nWhen the five align and blend as one,\nthen alone does one endure and remain whole forever.\nWhy should one weigh birth and death?\n\nTo follow is Heaven’s **virtue/power**; to oppose is the **bandit**.\nTheir origins lie in the mind’s own choices,\nyet their manifestation occurs through Heaven’s operations.\n**The cosmos lies within the hand;**\n**all transformations arise from the body.**\nTo close the door is called *yǔ* (宇);\nto open the door is called *zhòu* (宙).\nThe cosmos is the greatest of all,\nyet it never strays beyond my grasp—\nI can

(*jī*).\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao is to **settle** humanity;\nHeaven and humanity are never truly separate—\nonly the **perfected sage** attains this.\nTo fully embody Heaven’s nature is called **humanity** (*rén*);\nto master the human mind is called **the mechanism** (*jī*).\nWhen Heaven’s nature is exhausted,\nthen the **Three Powers** (*sān cái*) are complete;\nwhen the mind’s mechanism is illuminated,\nthen one becomes the **master of all things** (*wù zǎi*).\n\nAt rest and returning to the root,\none remains **serene and ever tranquil** (*zhànrán chángjì*).\nIn motion and responding to change,\none **turns and transforms without end** (*wòxuán wúqióng*).\nTo **unleash the human** and **settle Heaven**,\nto **settle Heaven** and **unleash the human**—\nthen the **profound and manifest** are in secret harmony,\nand **transformations** become visible.\n\nIf one cannot establish Heaven’s Dao,\nthen the mind’s impulses will never cease,\nand its outward expressions—\nhow could they not be perilous?\nCan birds **align in fixed postures** (*xiāngyú dìng*)?\nThus it is said: *\"To establish Heaven’s Dao is to settle humanity.\"*\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes the **killing mechanism** (*shā jī*),\ndragons and snakes rise upon the land.\nWhen humanity unleashes the **killing mechanism**,\nHeaven and Earth **reverse and overturn**.\nWhen Heaven and humanity **unleash together**,\nall transformations are settled by the mechanism.\n**Natures** have skill or clumsiness,\nwhich can be **concealed and hidden**.\nTo **transform and adapt**—this is what the mechanism does.\nHeaven effects change without speech,\nand the mechanism is truly great.\n\nThe **perfected sage who establishes Heaven**—\ncan humanity be without the mechanism?\nYet the mechanism of the mind is not the **ultimate mechanism**;\nthe mechanism without the mind is the **ultimate mechanism** (*jī de jí*).\nThe mechanism moves here,\ntransformations take form there—\nall in their

Heaven’s inability to bear**,\nand **transcend Earth’s inability to cover**—\nthe mechanisms of Heaven and humanity reach their peak here.\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the killing mechanism is unleashed

      "translated_text": "「The Way is naturally without armies yet strong,\nwithout battle yet victorious.\nThe mind arises from things and perishes with things—\nits mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe Sage sees the Dao yet not things,\nso his mind never arises, never perishes;\nThe common folk see things yet not the Dao,\nso their minds arise from things and perish with things.\n\nThe Sage rules heaven and earth with his fingers and palms,\nguides the ten thousand transformations within his mind—\nall through the movement of spirit and the workings of the heart,\nthus he can receive things as effortlessly as market transactions,\nhis heart as still as water,\nwhen the true mechanism unfolds,\nhe is not deceived by things.\n\nBut men differ from this:\nthey see what they desire and their minds are unsettled,\ntheir mechanisms are shallow indeed.\n\nHeaven, though lacking favor, gives rise to great favor.\nSwift thunder and violent winds—\nnone escape its influence.\nThe four seasons proceed in their own order,\nyin and yang create in their own way—\nHeaven acts without doing yet accomplishes all things.\nWhen things arise, flourish, decline, or perish,\nit is by their own nature,\nwhat favor does Heaven bestow?\nBecause Heaven lacks favor,\nno thing can harm it—\nthis is the true source of its great favor.\n\nYet even so,\nthings cannot generate themselves;\nthey must await something.\nThunder stirs them, wind moves them—\nall respond in unison.\n\nThe utmost joy lies in the nature’s ease,\nthe utmost stillness is pure and untainted.\nDoes the world have such great joy?\nAll things are complete within me—\nreturning to sincerity within oneself,\nno joy surpasses this—\nfor within the divisions of nature,\nit is said: \"I do not depend on the external.\"\n\nThe world’s restless pursuers,\nwhen they see something,\ngenerate covetous hearts;\nwhen they find joy,\ngenerate exultant hearts.\nBut the Perfect One’s joy differs from this—\nthus it is called *nature’s ease*.\n\nFortune and misfortune,\nregret and blame,\narise from movement.\nMovement cannot be free of entanglement—\nhow can it be pure?\nThe Perfect One dwells in steadfast stillness,\nwhere nothing can be used or not used—\nwhat entanglements remain?\nThus it is said:\nGreat purity knows no entanglement,\nunless one attains utmost stillness,\nhow can this be achieved?\n\nHeaven’s utmost particularity\nmanifests as utmost universality.\nGreat artifice does not serve things—\nall things are complete,\nclouds move and rain falls,\nthunder roars and wind flies—\ndoes it have a heart?\nWhen things are allowed to thrive and flourish,\nit is called *virtue*—\nthus it is said:\nUniversality and particularity,\nthe virtue of heaven and earth.\nThose that fly or run,\nthose that move or rest,\nall take their own course.\nAll things say: \"Heaven favors me,\"\ngranting me this existence—\ndoes Heaven carve and shape things?\nThis is called *utmost universality*.\n\nThe nature of birds is determined by *qi*.\nWater and fire have their own checks and balances,\nyet no extinguishing power—\nit is the *qi* that responds,\nnaturally so, without intention.\n\nTo check one form with another,\ngreat and small are not in harmony,\nso the great always prevail,\nthe small always falter.\nThe tortoise devours the python,\nthe flying squirrel severs the monkey—\nis it by form alone?\nIt is the *qi* that submits.\n\nLife is the root of death,\ndeath is the root of life.\nWhat lives here may not die there,\nwhat dies there may not live here.\nThe Perfect One transcends the realm of existence and non-existence,\nleaving behind the domains of movement and stillness—\nso life brings no delight,\ndeath brings no revulsion—\nwhat bonds or entanglements remain?\n\nRoots are like a tree’s roots:\nspring and summer come first,\nand it flourishes;\nautumn and winter come last,\nand it withers.\nBut if you call it the root and trunk,\nthen there is neither life nor death.\n\nMan is ensnared by form,\nentangled by numbers—\nalso like a tree’s roots.\nFavor arises from harm,\nharm arises from favor.\nHeaven and Earth are not kind—\nthey treat all things as fodder for the gods;\nThe Sage is not kind—\nhe treats the people as fodder for the gods.\nTrue kindness is the very reason for not being kind—\nonly Heaven, Earth, and the Sage are thus,\nnot the narrow, private granting or withholding of power.\n\nYet Heaven’s domain is not yet divided,\nthe Sage’s presence not yet revealed—\nwhat of kindness or unkindness?\nKindness and unkindness\nare merely observed from things.\n\nThe foolish man calls Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*,\nI say the patterns and principles of time and things are *wise*.\nCommon and ignorant,\nthey lack true understanding—\nthey follow yin and yang,\nare enslaved by creation.\nThey see only the dazzling changes of Heaven and Earth,\nand the clear, orderly principles of Heaven and Earth.\nDim and obscured,\nthey do not know what sustains them—\nthus they call Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles *sage*.\n\nBut the Perfect One differs:\nthe movement of time is endless,\nyet I follow it without resistance;\nthings generate without end,\nyet I align with them without opposition.\nTheir interplay creates patterns,\ntheir interweaving creates principles—\nthus it is said:\nI call the patterns and principles of time and things *wise*.」",
