  "full_translation": "**The *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue: Expanded Commentary in Manuscript Form**\n*(Title: Expanded Commentary on the True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue)*\nBy Yuan-dynasty scholar **Wang Shouzheng** (Five-Peak Qing’an Hermit)\nTwenty scrolls (originally missing Scroll One and Scroll Two)\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era), *Dòngshén* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Yùjuè* (Jade Precepts) Category\n\n---\n**Scroll Three of the Expanded Commentary on the *True Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue***\n\n**Chapter Nine: \"Holding Fullness Without Excess\"**\n*\"Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them well.\nWealth and honor breed arrogance—self-inflicted ruin follows.\"*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* records that **Bai Gong Sheng** of Chu, though he held the kingdom, could not distribute its treasures to the people.\n\n**Manuscript Annotation:**\nFrom the *Huainanzi*’s *\"Honglie Jiedao Training\"*:\nBai Gong’s given name was **Sheng**; he was enfeoffed at Bai, hence \"Bai Gong.\" He was the grandson of Chu Ping Wang and son of Crown Prince Jian.\n\n*(Note: The full account is already preserved in the original text.)*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Ruan Xuanzhi** (Range the Elder), son of Fan Wenzi, governed as chief minister during the reign of Duke Zhao of Lu. The tribute from other lords grew heavy.\n\n**Manuscript Annotation:**\nThe people of Zheng resented this, so **Zi Chan** (Child of Production, i.e., **Zi Chan of Zheng**, named **Qiu**, the senior minister) sent a letter to Xuanzhi.\n*(Zi Chan was the chief minister of Zheng.)*\n*\"Leaving a message\"* (寓书) means sending a letter.\nThis is to inform Xuanzhi.\n\n*(The full account is already complete and need not be repeated.)*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Wang Zi Chao** and **Bin Meng** were favored by King Jing of Zhou, who wished to establish Meng as heir.\n\n**Manuscript Annotation:**\nWang Zi Chao was the eldest son of King Jing.\nBin Meng’s given name was **Qi**, and he was Chao’s tutor.\nMeng said:\n*\"Why should a rooster fear being used by man?*\n*Men differ from this.*\nThough the sacrificial rooster may be adorned with honor, it will still be slaughtered.\nIf a man is adorned with honor, he will rise to nobility—his fate differs from the rooster’s.\"*\n\n*(This implies Meng advised Chao to let the king bestow early favor upon him, lest he later be discarded.)*\n*\"When achievement is complete and name secured, withdrawal is the Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\nThe *Classic of Changes* states:\n*\"To know advancement yet not retreat, to know preservation yet not destruction, to know gain yet not loss—only the Sage avoids the regret of excess.\"*\n\n**Manuscript Annotation:**\nFrom the *Zhouyi* (Commentary on the *Yijing*), the *File of Qian* (乾卦) states:\n*\"‘Excess’ (亢) means—*\n*to know advancement yet not retreat,*\n*to know preservation yet not destruction,*\n*to know gain yet not loss—*\n*who but the Sage can do this?*\n*Who but the Sage knows advancement, retreat, preservation, destruction, gain, and loss without losing the proper way?\"*\n\nThis clarifies the meaning of the **ninth line of Qian**.\n*\"If one does not know advancement, retreat, preservation, destruction, gain, or loss,*\n*then this uppermost line (上九) will bring regret through excess.*\n*This is because of these three failings.*\n*If one fully knows these three, even in the highest position, one will not exceed.\"*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\n*\"When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines.\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes.\nThe seasons cycle—achievement brings withdrawal.\"*\n\n**Manuscript Annotation (Du Qujing’s Interpretation):**\n*\"When the sun is at its peak, the moon at its full,*\n*summer gives way to winter,*\n*spring’s flourish yields to autumn’s fall—*\n*such is the Dao of Heaven.*\nIf man aligns with Heaven’s fullness and emptiness,\nforgets merit and name,\nwithdraws from office and declines honor,\nhe will not stray from Heaven’s natural cycles—\nthen there will be no cause for blame.\"*\n\n**Expanded Commentary:**\nTake **Zhang Liang of Han**, the **Leave-Home Master** (i.e., **Zhang Zifang**).\nThough ennobled with a ten-thousand-house fief,\nhe abandoned worldly affairs to follow **Chisongzi** (赤松子).\n\nDuring the **Han Xuan Emperor’s** reign, **Su Guang** (字仲翁), whose nephew **Su Shou** was his adopted son, both hailed from **Lanling, Donghai**.\nGuang served as **Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent**, while Shou was **Minor Tutor**.\nGuang said:\n*\"I have heard: ‘Knowing when to stop brings no peril; knowing contentment brings no disgrace.’*\n*I have also heard: ‘When achievement is complete and name secured, withdrawal is the Dao of Heaven.’\"*\n\nFather and son thus resigned on grounds of illness.\nThe Emperor granted them **thirty *jin* of gold**, while the Heir Apparent gave **fifty *jin***.\nThey submitted a memorial requesting retirement and returned home.\nIs this not the Dao of Heavenly withdrawal?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One**\n\nWhen nurturing the vital essence and embracing the One,\nhow could it ever depart?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"To bear\"* (載) means to carry by vehicle.\n*\"To bear\"* (載) also means to ascend by vehicle.\n\nQuoted from *Broad Exalted Meaning*:\n*\"Nurturing the vital essence\"*—\nThe human body is where spirit-qi resides and where soul-spirit (魂魄) takes form.\nTo move and carry the body is like a vehicle bearing goods.\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* states:\n*\"The body is the chariot of the spirit.\"*\nSince it is likened to a vehicle, it must be carried.\n\nThe **empty shell** (虚魄) is the manifestation of yin-qi—\nthe form of a person.\nYang-qi is formless—\nthe spirit of a person,\nthe vessel of form.\nYet when yang-qi has not yet descended,\nit lies inert, devoid of awareness,\nlike a dull stone or withered wood.\nWhen yang-qi descends,\nit gains movement—\nthus, form is called *arcane shell* (魄), belonging to yin.\nSpirit is called *soul* (魂), belonging to yang.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of yang-qi,\ndeath cannot be complete.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of yin-qi,\ntranscendence cannot be achieved.\nThus, refining yin-qi to exhaustion grants ascent to the Nine Heavens as an immortal,\nconsorting with yang.\nRefining yang-qi to exhaustion plunges one to the Nine Abysses as a ghost,\nconsorting with yin.\nTherefore, one must preserve the yang-soul,\nnurture the yin-shell,\nto safeguard life,\nembrace the One and uphold the Dao,\nlest it ever depart for an instant.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nQu Yuan’s *Li Sao* states:\n*\"Bearing the vital essence and ascending the crimson mist,\nparting the floating clouds to mount upward.\"*\n\nQuoted:\nQu Yuan was a Grand Minister of the Three Gorges in Chu.\n*Li Sao* is the title of his literary work.\n*\"Bearing the vital essence\"* means to carry soul-spirit and ascend the crimson mist—\nthe crimson mist being the rising vapor of earthly breath.\n*\"Clouds\"* refers to the vapors of mountains and rivers.\n*\"Parting\"* means to depart.\nTo depart from floating clouds,\nto carry soul-spirit,\nto stride across the crimson mist and soar,\nto part from floating clouds and ascend—\nthis is the mastery of qi to achieve supreme softness.\nCould it be like the infant brother?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThus it is said:\n*\"Hold firm to your resolve, yet do not exhaust your qi.\"*\n*\"Shuffling\"* and *\"hurrying\"*—\nthese are movements of qi,\nyet they agitate the mind.\n\nQuoted from *Mencius’ Discussion with Gongsun Chou, Upper Section*:\nGongsun Chou was a disciple of Mencius from Qi.\nHe saw Mencius speak of resolve first, then qi.\nThus he asked:\n*\"If so, then focusing solely on resolve suffices.\"*\nAgain he asked:\n*\"Why must one not exhaust qi?\"*\nMencius replied:\n*\"When resolve is singular, it moves qi.\n**Annotation:** *Singular* means unified.\n*Shuffling* means stumbling.\n*Hurrying* means rushing.\nMencius said that when resolve is directed with singularity,\nqi follows inevitably.\nYet when qi is concentrated in one direction,\nresolve itself is moved in turn—\nas when a person stumbles or rushes,\nqi is fixed upon that action,\nand the mind is disturbed in return.\nThus one must hold firm to resolve\nwhile ensuring qi is not exhausted.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"To wail all day yet the throat unsore—\nthis is the pinnacle of harmony.\"*\n\nQuoted from the original text of *Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Virtue*.\nSū’s annotation:\n*\"When the heart stirs, qi is injured.\nWhen qi is injured, the throat grows sore.\nTo wail all day yet the throat unsore—\nthis proves the heart undisturbed and qi in harmony.\"*\n\n**Could governance of the people and the realm be without action?**\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"Cultivate within yourself, and virtue becomes genuine.\nCultivate for the world, and virtue becomes universal.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Bìxū Zhēnrén’s* *Subtle Gatherings*:\n*\"Nearly applied to the self, yet extending far to the world.\"*\nTo cultivate the Dao within the body—\nfew thoughts, few desires—\nextends life and strengthens vitality,\nwhile all falsehoods are exhausted.\n\nSū’s elucidation:\n*\"Once the self is cultivated,\nits virtue naturally extends outward,\neven to governing the world.\"*\n\n**Could the opening and closing of the Celestial Gate be without duality?**\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe *Celestial Gate* is the gate of Nature.\nNature gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nQuoted from *Zhuangzi’s* *\"Gēngsāng Chú\"*:\nGuo Xiang’s annotation:\n*\"The Celestial Gate is the name of the origin of all things.\nIt is called the Celestial Gate.\nIt is also called the Gate of All Marvels.\"*\nChéng Fashi said:\n*\"Heaven is the name of Nature.\nThe principles of creation and transformation,\nthough named, lack substance—\nonly observing all things emerging from this gate,\nthus the Scripture calls it the Gate of All Marvels.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"There is birth, there is death,\nthere is exit, there is entry.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Zhuangzi’s* *\"Gēngsāng Chú\"*—\nthe text has already been detailed.\n\n**Translation:**\n\nAgain, the *Yì Jì* says:\n*\"Opening the gate is called **Qián (乾)**,\nclosing the gate is called **Kūn (坤)**,\nalternating closure and opening is called **change (變)**.\nEndless coming and going is called **harmony (通)**.\nBright and clear in all directions—\nhow could one remain unaware?\"*\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation** continues:\n*\"Like the reflection of objects in a mirror.\"*\n\nQuoted from **Bìxū (碧虚)**:\n*\"This is used to illustrate the mirror—\nthe mirror’s inherent clarity and purity,\nyet sometimes obscured by dimness,\nfor dust and grime adhere to it.\nIf one wipes away the dust and grime,\nall things are reflected with perfect lucidity.\nThis metaphorizes the practitioner of Dao,\nwho nurtures their **hún (魂)** and **pò (魄)**,\nembracing unity (抱一),\npreventing separation—\nthen their true nature (一性) shines forth.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation** continues:\n*\"Thus, the ruler of a state,\nthough their **virtue/power (德)** be bright and clear,\nlike the sun and moon illuminating the land,\nshould practice **withdrawing the senses (收視反聽)**,\nsealing their ears (塞聪) and dimming their sight (蔽明),\nso that the common folk live their daily lives\nunaware of its presence.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Guǎng Shèng Yì (廣聖義)*:\n*\"Bright and clear—\nthe wisdom of illumination (明白慧照).\nThe wisdom of illumination,\nwithout near or far—\nwhen the mind is stilled,\nthe heart forgotten,\nit is as though one has no knowledge.\nIf one boasts of their knowledge,\nthey cling to attachments\nand lose the Dao.\"*\n\n*\"The sovereign bears the singular vision (負獨見之明),\ngoverning their realm—\nyet their governance (政察察) is too scrutinizing,\nand the people grow weary and impoverished.\nThe **Laozi (老君)** warns against this,\ncommanding them to forget their deeds (忘功),\ncease their illumination (息照),\njust as one might stuff their ears with cloth (黈纩塞耳)\nto close their hearing,\nor let their crown veil (冕旒垂目)\nobscure their sight—\nthis too is the meaning of **withdrawing the senses (收視反聽)**,\nsealing their ears (塞聪) and dimming their sight (蔽明),\nso that the common folk live their daily lives\nunaware of its presence.\"*\n\nThe text above has already been detailed—\nno need to repeat it.\n**Thirty Spokes Chapter (三十辐章)**, the eleventh.\n\n**Thirty Spokes Chapter (三十辐章)**\n\nThe thirty spokes converge at a single hub—\nwhen the hub is empty, its use is fulfilled.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nThe *Zhou Li* (《周礼》) *Kaogong Ji* (考工记) states:\n*\"The carriage roof is round to symbolize Heaven,\nthe carriage body is square to symbolize Earth.\"*\n\nThe meaning is clear—no further elaboration is needed.\n\nWhen one hollows out doors and windows to make a dwelling,\nits emptiness is what makes it useful.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nIn antiquity, people lived in caves.\nThe *Yi* (《易》) *Xici* (系辞) says:\n*\"In the upper antiquity, people dwelled in caves and lived in the wilds;\nlater, the sages transformed this with palaces and dwellings.\"*\n\nThe hexagram *Dazhuang* (大壮) is taken.\nIn the upper antiquity, before palaces were built,\npeople merely nested in summer and dwelled in caves in winter.\nThus, dwellings were constructed to replace this.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nThe *Shijing* (《诗》) says:\n*\"Taofu, Taofu—digging and covering the cave.\"*\nMeaning: they dug into the earth and covered it above.\n\nThe *Mao Shisan* (《毛诗》) on *Wenwang’s* (文王) *Mian* (绵) ode says:\n*\"Ancient Gong Danfu,\ndug and covered the cave—\nno home yet existed.\"*\n\nAncient Gong was the Duke of Nan (邠公).\n*Ancient* means *long-standing*.\n*Dan* is his given name.\nHe was the ancestor of King Wen.\n\nDwelling in Nan, he governed with virtue,\nand many followed him.\nThough he had no residence,\nhe shaped the earth and covered it,\ndug the ground and hollowed it—\nfather, son, husband, wife dwelling together became a *family*.\n\n**Annotations:**\nThe ministers of feudal lords addressed their lord as *Jun* (君).\n*Fu* (复) means to cover upon the earth.\n*Zaotü* (凿穴) means to dig—all like the shaping of clay.\nThis is like the kilns of today.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nZhuangzi says:\n*\"If a dwelling has no empty space,\nmother-in-law and daughter-in-law will clash in the paths.\"*\nThe *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》) *Waiwu* (外物) chapter says:\n*\"If a dwelling has no empty space,\nthe paths become narrow and congested,\nand mother-in-law and daughter-in-law will quarrel over passage.\"*\n\nThe daughter-in-law should yield to her mother-in-law as a mark of filial piety,\nyet now they contend over paths,\nwith nowhere to go but to harbor private grudges—\nthis leads to rebellion and strife.\n\nThus, *having* is for *utility*,\n*emptiness* is for *use*.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nThe *Yi* (《易》) says:\n*\"That which is above form is called the Dao;\nthat which is below form is called instruments.\"*\nFrom the *Yi* (《易》) *Xici* (系辞).\n\nThe *Guangsheng Yi* (《广圣义》) says:\n*\"That which is above form is the root of the Dao—\npure, tranquil, and non-acting in its loftiness.\nThat which is below form is the function of the Dao—\nreceiving essence and flowing into form in its lowliness.\"*\n\n---\n**Five Colors Chapter (五色章) [Twelfth]**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nthe five tones deafen the ears,\nthe five flavors dull the palate.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:**\nThe five colors were established\nto manifest the symbols of the Five Phases.\nEmbroidered patterns of *fǔfú* (黼黻) distinguish the adornments of rank.\n\n**Annotations:**\nThe five colors are: *qīng* (青, blue-green), *huáng* (黄, yellow), *bái* (白, white), *chì* (赤, red), *hēi* (黑, black).\nThe Five Phases: *jīn* (金, metal), *mù* (木, wood), *shuǐ* (水, water), *huǒ* (火, fire), *tǔ* (土, earth).\n\n*Fǔfú* (黼黻) embroidery—\nthe *Shangshu* (《尚书》) *Yì Jì* (益稷) says:\n*\"The Emperor said to Shun:\n'You are my arms, legs, ears, and eyes.\nI wish to govern left and right with the people—\nyou shall assist me.\nI wish to exert strength in the four directions—\nyou shall lead.\nI wish to observe the symbols of ancient times—\nthe sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, and *huá-chóng* (华虫),\nso make them manifest.\nThe ancestral vessels, *zǎo* (藻), fire, powdered rice, *fǔfú* (黼黻), *xì* (絺), and embroidery—\nwith five colors vividly applied,\nmake the garments—\nyou shall clarify them.'*\n\n**Explanation:**\nWhenever *rǔ* (汝) is spoken,\nit refers to the ministers of the time—\nthose below Yu.\n\nThe making of garments must be distinguished:\n*Clothing* (衣) is for the upper body,\n*skirt* (裳) is for the lower.\nTogether, they have twelve chapters\nto differentiate the adornments of rank.\n\nAll clothing is dark (*xián* 玄),\nall skirts are embroidered (*shù* 肃, *qǐ* 绮).\nThe sun, moon, stars, mountains, dragons, and *huá-chóng* (华虫)—\nthese six patterns appear on the clothing,\nand are also seen on the ancestral vessels in the ancestral temple.\n\n*Zǎo* (藻), fire, powdered rice, *fǔ* (黼), *fú* (黻)—\nthese six are embroidered on *xì* (絺) for the skirts alone.\n\nThe sun, moon, stars symbolize *clarity*,\nthe mountains symbolize *benevolence*.\n\nThe dragon symbolizes the manifestation of transformation.\n\nThe *huá-chóng* (华虫) are creatures of luminous clarity.\n\nThe Sage governs the world with clarity,\nand enacts virtue through action—\nthough their methods may be unfathomable,\nyet their governance, teachings, laws, and rites are fully realized.\nWith these, they rule the people,\nand the people find peace.\nWith these, they serve the spirits,\nand the spirits are honored.\nThus, these six motifs appear on the ancestral vessels,\nand again on the garments.\n\nSoftness, compliance, purity, and cleanliness—\nthese are the qualities of *zǎo* (藻),\nfit for presenting offerings.\n\nRadiance, brightness, and swiftness—\nthese are the qualities of fire,\nfit for cooking and preparation.\n\nRice nourishes humanity,\npowdered rice (粉) adorns the world,\nwhile *fǔ* (黼) serves as a boundary,\nand *fú* (黻) distinguishes rank.\n\nThe Sage adorns truth with *zǎo*,\nand polishes the Dao of kingship with powdered rice,\nto nourish the world—\nlying in their ability to set boundaries while maintaining distinction.\n\nOnly then can governance be perfected.\nThese six motifs appear on the skirts.\n\nYet later generations, with their embroidered finery,\npursued dazzling hues—\ngreen and yellow, pleasing to the eye,\nbut straying into excess,\ndraining vitality and dimming wisdom,\nunable to perceive the color beyond color.\nWhat else could this be but blindness?\nThis is the corruption of the five colors.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe establishment of the five tones\nwas meant to manifest the sounds of the Five Phases.\n\nMetal, stone, silk, bamboo—\nthese convey the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe five tones, as per Han Sima Xiangru’s account:\n*Gōng* (宫) is centrality—\nthe virtue of the ruler.\n*Shāng* (商) is clarity—\nthe completion of things.\n*Jiǎo* (角) is the beginning—\nthe emergence of things.\n*Zhēng* (征) is prosperity—\nthe flourishing and abundance of things.\n*Yǔ* (羽) is concealment—\nthe gathering and storage of things.\n\nThe *Shàngshū* [益稷篇] states:\n\"The Emperor said:\n'I wish to hear of the six *lǜ* (律), the five tones, and the eight sounds,\nto govern with precision,\nso that my words may be properly expressed.\nYou must listen.\nIf I err, correct me.\nDo not merely assent on the surface—\nafterward, speak freely.'\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe six *lǜ* are:\nEleventh month—Huángzhōng (黄钟),\nFirst month—Tàizhū (太簇),\nThird month—Gūxǐ (姑洗),\nFifth month—Ruìbīn (蕤宾),\nSeventh month—Yízé (夷则),\nNinth month—Wúshè (无射).\n\nThe six *lǘ* (吕) are:\nSecond month—Jiázhōng (夹钟),\nFourth month—Zhōnglǘ (中吕),\nSixth month—Línzhōng (林钟),\nEighth month—Nánlǘ (南吕),\nTenth month—Yìngzhōng (应钟),\nTwelfth month—Tàilǘ (太吕).\n\nThese are the six *lǘ*.\n\nThe five tones are *gōng, shāng, jiǎo, zhēng, yǔ*.\nThe eight sounds are metal, stone, silk, bamboo, clay, wood, gourd, and leather.\n\nYou, Yu, must heed and follow these,\nand thus create the *lǐ* (礼) and *fú* (服),\nmaking them clear and manifest.\n\nThis is the corruption of the five tones above.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe establishment of the five flavors\nwas meant to manifest the harmony of the Five Phases,\nyet people indulge in coarse and refined tastes,\ntheir appetites insatiable,\nclouding their spirit and defiling their essence.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe five flavors are sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and spicy.\n*Shuǎng* (爽) means \"to err\"—\nwhen taste is overindulged, harm follows,\nleading to deafness, blindness, and loss of discernment.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe delight in *chúhuàn* (刍豢).\n\n**Annotation:**\nFrom *Mèngzǐ* [告子章句上]:\n\"Mencius said:\n'The joy of ritual and righteousness to my heart\nis like the joy of coarse and refined foods to my mouth.'\n*Sū* (刍) refers to grass—\ngrass-fed animals, such as cattle and sheep.\n*Huàn* (豢) refers to grain-fed livestock—\npigs and dogs of the sort.\nThus, it is said that *chúhuàn* delights the palate.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe insatiable gluttony of *tāotiè* (饕餮).\n\n**Annotation:**\nGreed for wealth is called *tāo* (饕),\ngreed for food is called *tiè* (餮).\nIt speaks of those who are insatiable in their greed for wealth and food.\n\nAll these—*tāotiè*—\nobscure the spirit and defile the essence,\nlosing their proper balance.\n\nHunting and falconry drive men to madness.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nAs recorded in the *Lǐjì* [王制].\n\n「Annotations from *Zhōulǐ* [周礼] state:\nSpring *sōu* (搜), selecting those barren.\nSummer *miáo* (苗), taking those that do not bear grain.\nAutumn *xiàn* (狝), slaughtering in abundance.\nWinter *shòu* (狩), hunting without restraint.\n\n*Shòu* (狩) means to take without discrimination.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nExcessive hunting without measure—\nas in Summer *Tàikāng*’s hunt beyond *Luòbiǎo* (洛表),\nwhere the Five Sons all lamented.\n\n**Annotation:**\nExcessive hunting is recorded in *Shàngshū* [五子之歌]:\n\"Tàikāng occupied the throne,\nindulging in ease and pleasure, destroying his virtue.\nThe people all turned against him.\nHe wandered recklessly beyond *Luòbiǎo*,\nreturning only after ten cycles of the moon.\nThe Five Sons all lamented.\"\nThe Five Sons were Tàikāng’s five younger brothers.\nThey composed this song to admonish *Dà Yǔ*’s warnings.\n\nIts second verse states:\n*\"Teachings say:\nWithin, moral corruption spreads;\nwithout, hunting grows wanton.\nSweet wine and music,\ntall halls and carved walls—\nif one indulges in these,\nruin is inevitable.*\nNow, this serves as proof:\nIf laws are disregarded,\nchasing wild pursuits without restraint,\nexhausting the land and harming farmers,\nclimbing cliffs and crossing dangers,\nreturning only after months—\nwhat else but madness could follow?\nThis is the folly of hunting.\"\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe *Aī Gōng* of *Qí* loved hunting,\na subject of poetic censure.\n\n**Annotation from *Máo Shī* [毛诗卷第五]:\n*\"Returning, he censures wastefulness.\"*\nAī Gōng delighted in hunting,\nfollowing beasts without restraint,\nand the people imitated him,\nmaking it a national custom.\nSkill in hunting was called *xián* (accomplished),\nleisure in chasing was called *hào* (virtuous).\nRare treasures became obstacles to conduct.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe *Míngyuè* (明月) Jewel.\n\n**Annotation:**\nFrom *Tōngjiàn* [通鉴], *Xiǎnwáng*’s fourteenth year:\nWhen *Qí* and *Wèi* met for a hunt in the wilds,\n*Wèi Huì Wáng* asked *Qí Wēi Wáng*:\n\"Does *Qí* possess any treasures?\"\nWēi Wáng replied, \"None.\"\nHuì Wáng said, \"Though my kingdom is small,\nI still have ten *jǐncùn* pearls—\neach illuminating twelve chariots before and behind.\"\nWēi Wáng said, \"What I treasure differs from yours.\nI have *Tán Zǐ*, who guards the southern city—\nthen the *Chǔ* dare not raid.\n*Yǎn Zǐ*, who guards *Gāotáng*—\nthen the *Zhào* dare not fish east of the *Hé*.\n*Pínfū*, who guards *Xúzhōu*—\nthen *Yān* and *Zhào* migrate there, seventy families strong.\n*Zhǒngshǒu*, who guards against thieves—\nthen the roads are safe, no lost goods.\nThese four ministers illuminate a thousand *lǐ*—\nhow much more than twelve chariots!\"\nHuì Wáng was ashamed.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThe *Yèguāng* (夜光) Pearl.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThe *Chū* king possessed a *Yèguāng* pearl.\nAsked where it came from, he replied:\n*\"A Chū minister, *Suī Hòu*, once traveled\nand saw a cowherd boy strike a snake,\nwounding it fatally.\nSuī Hòu pitied it, saved it, washed it in water,\nand sealed its wound with medicine—reviving it.\nThe snake vanished into the water,\nreturning as the *Hǎilóng Wáng*’s son.\nLater, it brought a seven-*cùn* pearl in gratitude.\nSuī Hòu presented it to the *Chū* king,\nwho placed it on his hall at night—\nits light illuminated the palace,\nearning it the name *Yèguāng* pearl.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nMencius said:\n*\"Treasure jade and pearls,\nand calamity will befall.\"*\n\n**Annotation from *Mèngzǐ* [尽心章句下]:\nMencius said:\n\"The treasures of a ruler are three:\nland, people, and governance.\nTreasure jade and pearls,\nand calamity will befall.\"\n*Yín Shì* commented:\n*\"Those who hold true treasure are secure;\nthose who lose true treasure are in peril.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThus, when *Xī Lǚ* presented the *Yáng* (獒) hound,\n*Chào Gōng* composed a warning to *Zhōu Wǔ Wáng*.\n\n**Annotation from *Shàngshū* [旅獒篇]:\n*\"Xī Lǚ presented the *Yáng* hound.\"*\nThe western *Yáng* people offered a great dog—\nfour *chǐ* tall, called *Yáng*,\nremarkable for its size.\n*Tàibǎo* composed *\"Lǚ Yáng.\"*\nChào Gōng, named *Shì*, served as *Tàibǎo*,\nadmonishing *Wǔ Wáng* with these words:\n*\"Ah!\nA sage king governs with virtue,\nand all distant peoples come as guests.\nNone are too far or near—\nall bring their offerings.\nIf one does not create useless things,\ngreat achievements are made.\nIf one does not value rare objects\nbut instead values useful ones,\nthe people will

replied:\n\"Yǎn, is this not excellent?\nYet you ask of it.\nNow, I have lost my self—do you understand?\"\nThis is also akin to saying *\"I have no body\"* [吾无身].\nWhen one attains such a state,\nformer honors and humiliations fade away—\nwhat need remains for them?\n\nThus, to cherish the body as the world’s treasure,\nas though it could be entrusted with the world,\nto love the body as the world’s foundation,\nas though it could bear the world’s weight.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nAs when **Shùn’s** [舜] offering the throne to **Zǐzhōu Zhīfù** [子州支父].\nFrom *Zhuangzi* [《庄子》],

[让王篇]:\nThe people of Yuè killed their rulers for three generations.\nWángzǐ Sōu, fearing this, fled to **Dān Xué** [丹穴]—\na cave in the southern mountains.\nYuè, having no king, searched for Wángzǐ Sōu but could not find him,\nso they pursued him into the cave.\nThey burned him with mugwort and carried him in a jade carriage—\nthe royal litter.\nWángzǐ Sōu grasped the reins and ascended,\ngazing upward to the sky, he cried:\n*\"O ruler, ruler!\nWhy must you abandon me?\"*\n\nWángzǐ Sōu did not dislike being king—\nhe disliked the burdens of kingship.\nOne such as Wángzǐ Sōu\ncan be said to

praise them.\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*The Zuo Commentary* states:\n*\"The Most Exalted Dao/Way establishes virtue; the next level establishes deeds.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Xiang’s Twenty-Fourth Year*:\nMu Shu went to Jin, and Fan Xuanzi received him, asking, *\"The ancients said, ‘To die and yet not perish—what does this mean?’\"* Mu Shu did not respond.\nFan Xuanzi said:\n*\"The ancestors of my house, from the time of Yu onward, were the Yao-Tang Clan. In the Xia, they were the Yu-Long Clan—this refers to Liu Lei. See the account in Duke Zhao’s Twenty-Ninth Year. In the Shang, they were the Shi-Wei Clan—Shi-Wei was the name of a state. Southeast of Bai-Ma County in Dong Commandery lies Wei City. In the Zhou, they were the Tang-Du Clan—Tang and Du were two states. At the end of the Yin, the Shi-Wei State was moved to Tang, and Duke Cheng of Zhou destroyed Tang, relocating them to Du, where they became Duke Bu of Du. Duke Bu’s son, Yi Shu, fled to Jin, and four generations later, Shi Hui received a fief in Fan, restoring the Fan Clan. Du is now Du County in Jingzhao Commandery. The Jin ruler made Fan the host of the Summer Alliance—this is what is meant, is it not?\"*\n\nMu Shu replied:\n*\"From what I’ve heard, this is called ‘hereditary rank,’ not ‘not perishing.’ Ru had a former minister named Zang Wen Zhong. After his death, his words endured—this is what is meant, is it not?\"*\n\nI have heard that the Most Exalted Dao/Way establishes virtue; the next level establishes deeds; the next establishes words. Historians like Shi Yi, Zhou Ren, and Zang Wen Zhong—though time passes, they are not forgotten. This is what is meant by ‘not perishing.’ As for preserving one’s lineage and surname, guarding ancestral altars, and ensuring one’s descendants never perish—no state lacks this. The greatest of ranks cannot be called ‘not perishing.’\"\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Heaven and Earth Chapter*:\n*\"In the age of supreme virtue, no one is praised for talent, no one is employed for skill. Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer.\"*\n\n**Explanation:**\n*\"Above, since there is no governance, below, all are pure and natural—like wild deer, free from royal rites.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*Zhuangzi said:*\n*\"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—then the world begins to doubt.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Horsefoot Chapter*:\n*\"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—these are the appearances of exerting effort for benevolence and righteousness. To force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—both are the outward forms of contriving benevolence and righteousness.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"Yao’s benevolence was like the heavens; those who approached him were like the sun. Shun had a fragrant virtue, and the people rejoiced in him. Thus, he moved his capital three times to Chengdu, and when he reached Deng’s ruins, ten thousand families followed him.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Xu Wu Gui Chapter*:\n*\"Shun, in humble attire, wandered through Kang Qu. He heard children singing:*\n*'Establish the people, do not deviate from your utmost!*\n*Unknowing and unthinking,*\n*Follow the Way of the Sovereign.’*\n*‘Cheng’ means ‘the many.’*\n*He who makes all things reach their utmost*\n*does not violate their natural dispositions.*\n*If one governs by knowledge and understanding,*\n*how could this be in accord with the Dao of Heaven?’\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"The people’s songs praised Shun.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Mencius, Chapter on Wan Zhang (Upper)*:\nMencius answered Wan Zhang:\n*\"Shun served Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something a man could do alone; it was Heaven’s will. When Yao died, after three years of mourning, Shun moved Yao’s son to the south of the Nan River. The feudal lords who came to pay homage did not go to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes did not bring them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang praises did not sing of Yao’s son but of Shun. Hence, it was Heaven’s will.\"*\n\n*The Nan River is in the southern part of Ji Province, also in Yu Province. ‘Disputes’ refers to unresolved legal cases.*\n\nThe next level is to be feared and scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel. When the Zhou held alliances, the people began to doubt.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Zhao’s Fourth Year*:\n*\"The Duke of Chu, Ling Wang, assembled the feudal lords at Shen. Jie Ju spoke to the Duke of Chu:*\n*'I have heard that when feudal lords do not return in proper attire, they are not to be followed. This is the ritual norm for returning.*\n*Jie Ju said:*\n*'The deeds of the Six Kings and Two Dukes—*\n*—the Six Kings’ deeds: Qi Yu’s fishing pavilion feast, Tang’s command at Jing Bo, Wu Wang’s assembly at Meng Jin, Cheng Wang’s search at Qi Yang, Kang Wang’s court at Tang Guan, and Mu Wang’s gathering at Tu Shan.*\n*—the Two Dukes’ deeds: Qi Huan’s army at Ling and Jin Wen’s alliance at Qian Tu.*\n*All these were meant to demonstrate ritual to the feudal lords, the means by which they were commanded.*\n*But Xia Jie held the Ren Alliance—Ren was a state—and the ruler of Man rebelled. Shang Zhou held the search at Li—Zhou hunted in the eastern Yi state of Li—and the Yi people rebelled. Zhou You held the alliance at Da Shi—the central peak—and the barbarians rebelled against Zhou. Because of this, they rebelled against Zhou. All these were meant to show extravagance and excess to the feudal lords. The feudal lords thus abandoned their commands.*\n*Now, Your Majesty, with your excess, will this not fail?’*\n*The King did not listen.*\n\n*The Shang Classics contain the text of Tang’s oath. The Zhou had the assembly at Mu Ye and Meng Jin.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: **\"Sincerity (chéng) is what is called *having naivety (fú) in the heart.**\"*\nFrom the *Book of Changes*, the hexagram *Zhong Fú* (Inner Truth), line five:\n*\"With sincerity, it is as though there were no response (wú dá).\"*\n*\"As though there were no response\"*—this is the language binding one’s trust.\nWhen one is in the central position, relying on sincerity to interact with others, and occupies a high station as the master of oaths, how could one abandon trust? Thus, *having naivety (fú)*—because one *has naivety*, one avoids blame.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: **\"Trust is what can be repeated in speech.\"**\nFrom the *Analects* (Book of Learning, First):\nMaster You said:\n*\"Trust is close to righteousness—speech can be repeated.*\n*Reverence is close to ritual—it keeps one distant from shame and disgrace.*\n*Thus, one does not lose one’s kin, and they can be revered as well.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: **\"Qi Huan did not betray Cao Gui—also called Cao Mò—at the Alliance.\"**\nFrom the *Records of the Grand Historian*:\nCao Mò was a man of Lu.\nHe served Duke Zhuang of Lu through his strength and courage.\nDuke Zhuang favored martial prowess, and Cao Mò became Lu’s general.\nHe fought against Qi three times and was defeated each time.\nDuke Zhuang, fearful, offered the territory of Suì to make peace.\nYet he still kept Cao Mò as general.\nQi Huan Gong agreed to meet with Duke Zhuang at Kē and take the oath.\nAfter the two dukes had sworn on the altar,\nCao Mò seized a dagger and held Qi Huan Gong hostage.\nNone of Qi Huan Gong’s attendants dared move.\nHe asked: *\"What do you intend?\"*\nCao Mò replied:\n*\"Qi is strong, Lu is weak, and the great state has already aggressed against Lu severely. Now Lu’s walls are ruined, pressing against Qi’s borders—you must consider this!\"*\nQi Huan Gong then agreed to return all the lands he had seized from Lu.\nAfter speaking, Cao Mò cast his dagger aside, descended from the altar, and knelt facing north among the assembled ministers, his expression unchanged, his words as before.\nQi Huan Gong, enraged, wished to break his oath.\nGuan Zhong said: *\"That cannot be done.\"*\n\nThe **Way** is abandoned when greed for petty gains leads one to abandon trust among the **lords of the states** and lose the support of the world—better to yield than to persist.\n\nThus, Qi Huan Gong finally ceded the lands he had seized from Lu.\nAll the territories lost by Cao Mò in three battles were restored to Lu.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: The people of Jin did not abandon the promise to attack Yuan.\n*Recorded*: The Jin army attacked Yuan.\nDuke Wen of Wei led his soldiers to attack Yuan.\nThe Jin lord besieged Yuan, ordering three days’ worth of provisions. When Yuan refused to surrender, he ordered his troops to withdraw.\nA spy reported: *\"Yuan is about to surrender.\"*\nThe military officers said: *\"Let us await it.\"*\nThe duke replied: *\"Trust is the treasure of a state, the shelter of its people. To gain Yuan but lose trust—how could we shelter them?*\nThe more we lose, the greater the harm. Withdraw one step, and Yuan will surrender itself.\"\nFrom then on, the **lords of the states** submitted in allegiance, just as they had to the promise to attack Yuan.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: Wu Qi did not renege on the reward for moving the chariot axle.\n*Recorded* from *The Historical Records*: Wu Qi, a general of Wei, sought to attack Qin but feared the soldiers and troops would not trust him. He buried a chariot axle at the eastern market gate.\nHe posted: *\"If anyone can move this axle to the western gate, I will grant them land, fields, and a residence of one hundred *mu* and one hundred *jin* of gold.\"*\nAfter three days, no one dared to move it.\nHe revised the posting: *\"If anyone can move it, I will grant them land, fields, and a residence of five hundred *mu* and one hundred *jin* of gold.\"*\nAt that time, a man came forward and moved it, so he was rewarded accordingly.\nThus, he summoned recruits to attack Qin and succeeded.\nThis was a case where he did not renege on the reward for moving the axle.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: The Marquis of Wei did not violate the hunter’s appointment.\n*Recorded* from *The Historical Records*: The Marquis of Wei was Wei Wen Hou.\nThe hunter was an official overseeing mountains and marshes.\nWen Hou had made an appointment with the hunter for a hunt, but the next day, as he was about to depart, he happened to be enjoying wine and music with his ministers, when a heavy rain fell. He ordered his carriage to proceed to the wilds.\nHis attendants said: *\"Today we are drinking and enjoying ourselves, and now it rains—where shall we find shelter?\"*\nWen Hou said: *\"I do not rest upon beasts and birds. I have made an appointment with the hunter—how could I fail to meet him? I fear losing trust, so I will go despite the rain.\"*\n\n**The Great Dao Abandoned, Virtue/Power Emerges** (Chapter XVIII)\nWhen the **Great Dao** is abandoned, there arise **virtue/power** and righteousness.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *\"Fish forget each other in the water; men forget each other in the arts of the **Way**.\"*\n*Recorded* from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *Great Master [Da Zong Shi]*) states: *\"When the spring dries up, fish share the land together. They breathe upon one another to keep moist, and splash water upon one another to keep wet—this is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes.\"*\n\nWhen wisdom arises, great deceit follows.\n*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *\"Discard petty wisdom, and great wisdom will shine forth.\"*\n*Recorded* from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *External Things [Wai Wu]*) states: *\"Discard petty wisdom, and great wisdom will shine forth.\"*\nPettiness is self-serving; great wisdom follows the natural course.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: How difficult it is to indulge in petty cleverness!\n*Recorded* from *The Analects* (□ *The Duke of Wei [Wei Ling Gong]*) (Chapter XV): The Master said: *\"To dwell together all day without discussing **virtue/power**, and to delight in petty cleverness—how difficult it is!\"*\nPettiness is the indulgence of private desires.\nWhen words do not touch upon **virtue/power**, the heart grows reckless and extravagant.\nWhen one delights in petty cleverness, the inclination toward reckless risk and fortune-seeking matures.\n\"*How difficult it is!\"* means that such a person cannot attain **virtue/power**, and disaster will surely follow.\n\n*Extended Meaning*: Zhuangzi said: *\"The true nature of the horse lies in its grazing on grass, drinking water, and lifting its hoof to stand.\"*\nThe text from *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Horse’s Hoof [Ma Ti]*) has already been detailed in the **Meaning**, so it is not repeated here.\n\n「Extended Meaning」:\n\nIn the age of **Dao**’s pristine origin, the people did not know what to do, nor where to go. They carried their food in their mouths while strolling in contentment, drumming their bellies as they wandered freely.\n\n*Quoted*: In the time of **Hēxiū** (the Radiant Virtue), the people dwelled without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go, carried their food in their mouths while strolling in contentment, drumming their bellies as they wandered freely. The people could attain this state.\n\n*Commentary*: *Zhī* (adapt). **Hēxiū**, an ancient sovereign. Also, one whose radiant **virtue/power** caused the people to rally to him—thus called **Hēxiū**. This refers to the **Flame Emperor** (Yán Dì).\n\nIt is said: To carry food in the mouth while frolicking, indistinguishable from an infant; to drum the belly while roaming, no different from a child.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nTo bend and twist **ritual and music** to rectify the forms of the world,\nTo stretch and strain **benevolence and righteousness** to soothe the hearts of the world.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Horse’s Hoof [Mǎ Tí]*).\n\n*Commentary*: To fold, bend, and rotate in performing **ritual and music** to correct the body’s posture; to yearn and aspire to soothe the soul. Thus, they stand on tiptoe, proud of their knowledge, and engage in deceitful scheming, all vying for profit and gain—yet they know not when to stop. Alas, the excesses of the sages!\n\nAmong kin, discord arises, yet there is filial piety and kindness.\nIn a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n*The Classic of Rites* states: *\"When the **Dao** prevails, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children.\"*\n\n*Quoted from* *The Classic of Rites* (□ *The Great Plan of Sacrifice [Lǐ Yùn]*):\n\n*\"When the **Dao** prevails, the world is held in common. The worthy and capable are selected, trust is cultivated, and harmony is fostered. Thus, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children. The aged have a place to end their days, the strong have useful labor, the young have nurturing, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and infirm all receive sustenance.\"*\n\nAgain, citing filial piety and kindness.\n\n*The Analects*: Duke Kāng of Zhōu asked: *\"How can one govern the people so that they are respectful, loyal, and encouraged?\"* The Master replied: *\"Rule them with solemnity, and they will be respectful. Be filial and kind, and they will be loyal.\"* Filial to one’s parents, kind to the multitude.\n\n*The Erya* states: *\"To serve one’s parents well is called filial piety.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nMinisters who gouge out eyes and split open hearts.\n\n*Quoted from* *Records of the Grand Historian* (□ *The Annals of the Shang Dynasty [Yīn Běn Jì]*):\n\n*\"Zhòu Xīn (King Zhòu) was unrighteous, and the world called him **Jiè** (the Tyrant).\"* **Jiè** refers to one who violates laws, destroys righteousness, and harms the good.\n\nKing **Jiè**’s debauchery knew no end. **Mǐzǐ** repeatedly admonished him but was ignored, so he fled with the Grand Music Master and the Minor Music Master. **Bǐ Gān**, the king’s son, said: *\"As a subject, one cannot fail to contend to the death.\"* He then forcibly admonished **Jiè**.\n\n**Jiè** raged: *\"I have heard that sages have seven orifices in their hearts. Let us dissect **Bǐ Gān** to see!\"*\n\n*The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Thief and the Ruined Wall [Tóu Huàn]*) states:\n*\"**Bǐ Gān**’s heart was split open, **Wú Zǔ**’s eyes were gouged out—these were the calamities of loyalty.\"*\n\nThese are ministers who gouge eyes and split hearts, whose loyalty and righteous death only manifest when the ruler is corrupt. Hence, *\"In a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n**Gǔsōu** was obstinate, yet **Shùn** was called the Great Filial Son.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* (□ *The Record of Yáo [Yáo Diǎn]*):\n\n*\"The blind father, the obstinate mother, the arrogant brother—yet he harmonized them all. With filial piety unceasing, he did not tolerate evil. This was the Great Filial Son.\"*\n\n*The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Wàn Zhāng [Wàn Zhāng Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):\n\n*\"The truly filial serve their parents with reverence all their lives. At fifty, I saw such filial piety in the Great **Shùn**.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n**Zēng Zhì** was stern, yet **Zēng Shēn** was praised for nurturing.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Lí Lóu [Lí Lóu Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):\n\n*\"When **Zēng Shēn** cared for **Zēng Zhì**, he always ensured there was wine and meat. When serving, he would ask who to give the leftovers to. If there were any remaining, he would say, ‘There is.’ Thus, **Zēng Shēn** could be said to nurture his **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nTo serve one’s parents as **Zēng Shēn** did—this is acceptable.\n\n---\n**Chapter XIX: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nZhuangzi said: *\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom, to release and unite thieves and robbers—then the world begins to flourish.\"*\n\n*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*):\n\n*\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom.\"*\n\n*Commentary*: *\"Strike down\"* means to criticize and reject. Now, to speak of striking down is also to denounce **ren and yì**, to abandon the sage and discard wisdom. To not value rare and difficult goods, thus releasing and pardoning thieves and robbers, without resorting to harsh punishments—then the world attains great peace.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nTo abandon petty wisdom, then great wisdom becomes clear.\n\n**Chapter XIX: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**\n\n*Extended Meaning*:\nZhuangzi said: *\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom, to release and unite thieves and robbers—then the world begins to flourish.\"*\n\n*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*):\n\n*\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom.\"*\n\n*Commentary*: *\"Strike down\"* means to criticize and reject.

When **ren** and **yì** are discarded, and clever artifices and material gains abandoned, thieves and bandits vanish.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n*\"巧\"* (qiǎo) means \"artifice,\" referring to intricate carvings, mechanical devices, and locks like *\"扃鐍\"* (jiōng shū, \"double bolt and lock\").\nQuoted from *Zhuangzi* (□ *The Chapter on Opening Coffers and Chests [Kōu Qìè]*):\n\n*\"Yet when great thieves arrive, they carry off the chest and the coffer, sling the bags over their shoulders and run away, fearing only that the cords and bolts may not be secure enough.

His attendants were puzzled and asked: *\"Why does the Prime Minister not fear the mighty Qin, yet fear Lián Pó?\"* Xiàngrú replied: *\"Qin does not dare to lightly attack Zhào because it fears me and General Pó.

This shows how one who fears must refine himself, and how straight virtue can correct the bent.\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"There are those who, though talented, fragment their virtue.\"*\n\n**Annotation from *Zhuāngzǐ* (人间世):**\n*\"Zhīlí Cū\"* was a man whose jawbone was hidden beneath his navel, whose shoulders rose above his neck, and who could point to the sky by grasping his hair. He could mend needles and weave mats to sustain himself. When beating a drum and playing the *shí* (a divination instrument), he could feed ten men. When summoned for military service, he would roll up his sleeves and stand among the soldiers. When the state demanded labor, he would feign illness to avoid work. When the state gave grain to the sick, he would accept three *zhòng* (a measure) of six *shǐ* (a smaller measure) and four *dòu* (a still smaller measure), along with ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural span. But one who fragments his virtue—his talents go unexalted, his name unsung. If a man understands this and cultivates himself, how could he not preserve his enduring reputation?\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"The *Yì* says: 'Simple and unadorned, yet all under heaven’s principles are attained.'\"*\n**Annotation from *Yìjīng* (系辞上):**\n*\"Simple and unadorned, yet all under heaven’s principles are attained.\"* **Commentary:** *\"No principle under heaven does not arise from simplicity, nor do all things in the world achieve their proper order without it.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"Zhuāngzǐ said: 'When knowledge fails to settle the world, then adorn it with words, augment it with learning.

If an official had meritorious service passed down through generations, then there were official clans—meaning they took the old offices and old domains as their clans.\n\nDomains were also so named. The Duke bestowed the posthumous title *Zhǎn* (展) as a surname. Prince Wúhài (无骇) was the grandson of the Duke of Zhǎn (展), hence he was of the Zhǎn clan.\n\nThus, the Dao is vast, Heaven is vast, Earth is vast, and the King is also vast. Within the realm, there are four vast things, and the King occupies one of them.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nUnder all Heaven, there is nothing that is not the King’s land.\nWithin the borders of the

who worried that Heaven and Earth would collapse and fall, leaving him nowhere to rest his body, and so he neglected his sleep and food.\n\nThere was also someone who worried about his worry, and so went to enlighten him, saying:\n“Heaven is but accumulated *qi* (炁), where there is no place where *qi* does not exist.\nLike bending and stretching, inhaling and exhaling, one moves within Heaven all day.\nWhy should you worry about its collapse?”\n\nIf we examine this passage, its words are broad and its meaning profound, and it cannot be exhaustively cited.\n\nBut according to the theory of Heaven as accumulated *qi*, since it says one moves within Heaven all day,\nthen it is known that from Earth upward, all things belong to Heaven.\n\nThus it is said: *“Not necessarily lofty and distant, but vast and boundless.”*\nAgain, the *Zhuāngzǐ’s* “Xiāoyáo Yóu” (逍遥游) chapter states:\n“Heaven’s vastness, vastness—\nis it its true color?\nIts boundlessness, without end?\nIts gaze upon

Tàigōng Rèn went to comfort him and said: \"Master, are you near death?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" \"Do you dislike death?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Tàigōng Rèn said: \"You have spoken of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea, there is a bird called Yìdài. Its appearance is drooping and sluggish, unable to soar high. Yet it seems powerless, yet it rises with a gentle push and rests in the shelter of others, never daring to lead when advancing, nor lag when retreating, never daring to taste first when feeding—it must wait for the remnants. Thus, its movements are never singled out, and it blends with the crowd. Yet outsiders can never harm it, so it avoids calamity. Straight trees are cut first, sweet wells are drained first. Your cleverness deceives the ignorant, your polished conduct reveals the filthy—your brilliance is like displaying the sun and moon in daylight, so you cannot escape misfortune.\"*\n\n*I once heard from a Great Achiever say: \"Those who boast of their own merits have no true merit. When merit is attained, it is lost. When fame is gained, it is diminished. Who can abandon merit and fame and return to the common folk? The Dao flows without claiming residence, virtue acts without seeking recognition—pure and constant, this is the way of the mad. They discard their traces and abandon their influence, not striving for merit or fame. Thus, they bear no blame from others, nor do others blame them. The Perfect Ones are unheard of. Why do you take such joy in this?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"Excellent! To renounce one’s associations and abandon one’s disciples, to flee to the Great Marsh, wearing coarse hemp garments, eating acorns and chestnuts, entering the realm of beasts without disturbing their order, entering the realm of birds without disrupting their flight—if beasts and birds do not harm them, how much more so will humans?\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*The Seven Saints were all lost in confusion, with nowhere to inquire about the Dao.*\n\nQuoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *\"Xúwúguǐ\"* [徐无鬼篇]:\n*Huángdì was about to meet Dàwěi at Jùcí Mountain.

Chǐ then became Qi’s prime minister. Desiring to divide Qi’s lands with Yān, he seized and executed the King of Qi.\n\nGǔzǐ [Gongsun Chuo] said: *\"A state is the common benefit and advantage of all under Heaven. If one holds it by the Dao/Way, it brings great peace, great prosperity, and the accumulation of virtue. If one holds it without the Dao/Way, it brings great peril, great burdens, and it is better to have it not at all. When its decline reaches its extreme, even a commoner cannot escape it. The cases of Qi’s Duke Mǐn and Song’s Duke Xiàn are examples of this. This was not without the Dao/Way—yet each met their fate through death of themselves.\"*\n\nThe First Emperor of Qin, in his first year of Zhengshì (Year 1), from the *yǐmǎo* (2nd month of the 1st year) to the twenty-sixth year of *gēngchén* (7th month of the 26th year), pacified the feudal lords and extinguished the Six States, and took the title of First Emperor.\n\nIn the autumn of the thirty-seventh year, the seventh month, he died at the Sandbank Terrace.\n\nHú Hài ascended the throne, styling himself the Second Emperor. In the third year, the chancellor Zhào Gāo, fearing execution for himself, secretly ordered the magistrate of Xiányáng, Yān Lè, to lead a thousand or more scribes and soldiers to the Palace of the Watching Tides. Yān Lè went before the Second Emperor and repeatedly said: *\"Your Majesty is arrogant and unchecked, slaughtering without the Dao/Way. All under Heaven have rebelled against Your Majesty—Your Majesty should consider your own fate.\"* Lè then advanced his troops. The Second Emperor killed himself. The child Yīng was then enthroned as the Qin King.\n\nIn the winter of the first year of the High Ancestor [Emperor Gaozu], the tenth month, Pèi Gōng arrived at Bàshàng. The Qin King Yīng came forth in a plain carriage with white horses, his neck bound with a rope, surrendering the imperial seal and the credentials of command. The *Zìshū* records the character *穿* as \"chāo\" (to pierce), and the *Zhìyǐn* (phonetic annotation) explains: *\"The piercing of the wheel is pronounced 'chāo' with the tone of 穿.\"* Pèi Gōng then led his forces westward to slaughter Xiányáng, killing the surrendered Qin King Yīng and burning the Qin palaces. Yīng ruled for forty-six days until the state fell and he died—was this not a calamity upon his descendants?\n\nIn the autumn of the second year of Emperor Wǔ’s reign of *Hé* (Peace), the fourth month, the Emperor visited Gānquán. In the seventh month, the autumn, the Crown Prince Jù killed the envoy Jiāng Chōng, and, revealing this to Empress Hòu, raised troops in rebellion. The decree ordered the chancellor Qū Máo to suppress them. Jù fled to Lake Lú, and Empress Hòu Wèi, along with Jù, both killed themselves. The Hú clan [Empress Hòu’s family] said: *\"The Emperor’s ambitions were vast, his desires many—he exhausted military strength and waged wars without restraint, undertook massive construction projects, and never ceased his tours. When the people’s strength was spent, bandits swarmed, and then great disaster befell his descendants—was this not fitting?\"*\n\nWhere the Teacher’s forces have passed, thorny thickets spring up.\nAfter the great armies, there will surely be years of famine.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed—thorny thickets spring up.\"* The annotation reads: *\"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed\"*—this is from the *Zhuangzi*’s [*Fisherman*] chapter: *\"When officials attend to their duties and people worry over their affairs, then none overstep their bounds. Thus fields lie fallow, stones are exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies go unpaid, wives and concubines are discordant, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the woes of the common folk.\"* This clearly shows that after great armies pass, farmers lose their livelihoods, fields become overgrown with thorny thickets, and years of famine are sure to follow.\n\nThus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength through it. Act decisively yet take no pride, act decisively yet boast not, act decisively yet grow not arrogant—when action is unavoidable, this is acting decisively without seeking strength.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"Since the Sage drew the trigrams, bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world.\"* This is quoted from the *Zhouyi’s* [*Lower Appendices*]. *\"Bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world\"*—this is derived from *Kui* [Divergence]. *Kui* means \"contrariety.\" When things are contrary, disputes arise, and the use of bows and arrows is to awe and suppress such disputes. This was the Sage’s reluctant resort to force, demonstrating his awe—not that he delighted in killing.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"Gengsangzi said: The origin of war began with the first appearance of humankind.\"* He also said: *\"If there were a throat medicine that could kill, one should not ban all physicians in the world.\"* As for warfare, it cannot be abolished in the world. Those who govern with the Dao as their assistant should uphold the yielding and tranquil, not rely on force to dominate the world. If attacked by an enemy and forced to respond, then it is called skillful use of arms. This is quoted from the *Kangcangzi’s* [*On Military Strategy*] chapter. Now, these are taken as evidence: though war cannot be abolished, one must not rely on it, warning against using force to dominate the world.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"The Spring and Autumn Annals says: Killing the enemy is decisive.\"* The annotation reads: *\"In the second year of Duke Huan of Lu, Spring, the Spring and Autumn Annals records that the Marquis Gui of Zheng, having received his orders from Chu, attacked Song. Hua Yuan of Song, leading the armies of Le and Ju, confronted them. On the 12th day of the second month, they clashed at Da Ji, and the Song forces were routed. Hua Yuan was captured, and his capture was made known to demonstrate his survival. They seized Le and Ju’s commander, Hua Yuan, along with 460 chariots and 250 captives, and cut off the heads of 100 others. The Song minister Kuang Jiao welcomed the Zheng forces, but the Zheng soldiers threw him into a well. Kuang Jiao was a Song minister. They overturned their spears to rescue him, capturing Kuang Jiao instead. The sage said: ‘He violated protocol and disobeyed orders—it was fitting that he be taken prisoner.’ In warfare, the display of decisive resolve and attentive listening is called ‘protocol.’ Listening means keeping orders constantly in mind, internalizing them, and imagining their implementation. Killing the enemy is decisive; achieving decisiveness is resolute. If one reverses this, one will surely be punished. Reversing it is punishment. Before the battle, Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to feed the soldiers, but his charioteer, Yang Zhen, refused to partake. In battle, Yang Zhen said: ‘Yesterday’s sheep was yours to command; today’s matter is mine to command.’ He fought against the Zheng forces, and thus their army was defeated. The sage said: ‘Yang Zhen was not a true man. Out of personal resentment, he caused the nation’s treasures to be exhausted.’ What greater crime is there than this? The *Shijing* speaks of ‘the unvirtuous among men’—taking from the *Small Odes*, it refers to how unvirtuous men blame one another and bring ruin. This was Yang Zhen’s case. Thus, killing the enemy is decisive, meaning to stop the enemy. When war is unavoidable, it is used to stop the enemy, so that they no longer become raiders—hence, ‘not daring to seek strength through it.’\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"After Tang conquered Xia, he spoke of his temporary virtue.\"* The annotation reads: *\"From the Shang Book’s* [*Commissioner Zhi’s Instructions to Tang*]. Tang exiled Jie to Nan Chao, a place named ‘Only Shameful Virtue.’ He said: ‘I fear that future generations will use this as grounds for criticism.’ Though Tang followed Heaven and responded to the people, having inherited the succession from Yao, Shun, and Yu, he still felt uneasy in his heart, ashamed that his virtue did not match the ancients, as if fearing that the world would later use this as grounds for criticism.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"When returning to Bo, he had the fear of standing at the brink.\"* The annotation reads: *\"Tang’s Speech.\"* The king, having conquered Xia, returned to Bo and proclaimed his intentions to all under Heaven. Bo was Tang’s capital, located in Gu Shu County of Song Prefecture. He said: *\"Let me, as one man, unite and pacify this land—thus securing my state. But I fear I have not yet measured up to the expectations of Heaven and Earth, trembling with dread as if about to fall into a deep abyss.\"* Heaven entrusted me to unite and pacify this land, but the weight of this responsibility is so great that I fear I am unworthy. I do not yet know if I have offended Heaven and Earth, and I am filled with terror, as if standing at the brink of a deep abyss.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"In the Spring and Autumn period, Wu had once defeated Yue but harbored contempt for Chu.\"* This is detailed in the *Spring and Autumn* annotations and need not be repeated. *\"When things flourish, they decline—this is called ‘not the Way.’ The un-Way perishes early.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"The Way exists before the ancient sages but is not called ‘first.’\"* This is quoted from the *Zhuangzi’s* [*Master of the Heavenly Pattern*] chapter. *\"Before the Great Ultimate, it was not called ‘high’; beneath the six extremes and six unities, it was not called ‘deep’; before Heaven and Earth came into being, it was not called ‘long-lasting’; enduring beyond the ancient sages, it was not called ‘old.’\"* This speaks of the Way being everywhere yet nowhere, its presence everywhere yet its essence nowhere. The *Chapter on the Mysterious Oneness* has already elaborated on this. The *Chapter on Fine Arms* follows as the thirty-first.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"The gentleman values the left when at home but the right when wielding arms. Arms are an ill-omened instrument, not the tool of the gentleman; when unavoidable, they are used with equanimity as the highest principle.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"When barbarians and Yi tribesmen [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples] act deceitfully against the Xia—when raiders or violent bandits prey upon others—this is quoted from the *Shun’s Appointments* chapter. The Emperor Shun commanded Gao Yao: ‘Barbarians and Yi tribesmen act deceitfully against the Xia; raiders are called *kòu*, bandits *zéi*, the treacherous are *jiān*, and those who sow internal discord are *niè*. You shall be the *shì* [officer], overseeing the administration of punishments. The five punishments must be meted out with due deliberation, and the five stages of exile must be justly applied. Only the enlightened can truly fulfill this.’ This speaks of Shun’s command to Gao Yao as the *shì*, where the barbarians and Yi tribesmen, the *Róng* and *Dì* [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples], sow chaos within the central Xia, harming the common folk. You, as the *shì*, must govern and resolve these matters, ensuring your wisdom and discernment are unerring so that punishments fit the crimes and all submit without doubt. The five stages of exile refer to the severity of the crime, while the ‘three applications’ are interpreted by Confucius as: the greatest crimes are punished in the open fields, lesser ones by the great ministers in the court, and the smallest by the officers in the marketplace. The five degrees of exile denote those deserving leniency, yet their dwellings are still classified into three ranks—just as the five grades of nobility are divided into three tiers. Though the use of arms and warfare may be unavoidable, the gentleman acts only when compelled, hence the saying: ‘The gentleman of the Dao uses arms only when he has no choice.’*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates further: *\"To conquer and settle chaos and violence is the proper use of arms. To prevail in battle is called ‘conquest’ (*kè*), to inflict harm on others is ‘calamity’ (*huò*), and to act contrary to virtue, spreading confusion, is ‘disorder’ (*luàn*). This is quoted from: ‘To conquer and settle chaos’—this is how Jiāng Zǐyá [Maizi of Qi] of the Jiāng clan, fishing at the Pán River, split a fish and found a jade pendant within, inscribed with this text, titled *The Six Taos* (*Liù Táowéi*). The first is the *Wén Táowéi* [‘Cultural Tao’], adhering to the Dao of the state without transgressing Heaven’s natural order. The second is the *Wǔ Táowéi* [‘Martial Tao’], conquering chaos and subduing the eight directions with might. The third is the *Lóng Táowéi* [‘Dragon Tao’], harmonizing yin and yang without overstepping seasonal command. The fourth is the *Hǔ Táowéi* [‘Tiger Tao’], skillfully employing claws and fangs to crush the wicked. The fifth is the *Bào Táowéi* [‘Leopard Tao’], seizing opportunities to quell disasters with wisdom rooted in strategy and timing. The sixth is the *Quǎn Táowéi* [‘Hound Tao’], probing the subtlest intelligence or achieving unexpected feats through reconnaissance. *Táo* means ‘to conceal’—the arts of warfare and stratagem must not be lightly revealed to others, hence the term ‘concealed Tao.’*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"This is not for the sake of coveting land or wealth. This is quoted from the time of Emperor Xuān of the Han Dynasty, when Wèi Xián served as Chancellor. During the *Yuán Kāng* era, the Xiongnu sent troops to attack the Han, encroaching upon their cultivated fields. The military commander could not repel them. The emperor consulted with General Zhōngguó Zhāng Zǐguó and others, intending to exploit the Xiongnu’s decline by sending troops to strike their right flank, preventing further harassment of the Western Regions. The chancellor submitted a memorial advising: ‘I have heard that armies raised to rescue chaos and punish tyranny are called *yìbīng* [‘righteous armies’], and armies of righteousness bring victory. When enemies attack us and we rise in response, this is called *yìngbīng* [‘retaliatory armies’], and armies that retaliate prevail. When one fights over petty grievances, unable to tolerate anger, this is called *fènbīng* [‘wrathful armies’], and armies born of wrath are defeated. When one seeks to seize another’s land or treasures, this is called *tān bīng* [‘greedy armies’], and greedy armies are destroyed. When one relies on the state’s power and the people’s numbers, desiring to display one’s might over enemies, this is called *jiāo bīng* [‘proud armies’], and proud armies perish. These five principles are not merely human affairs; they align with the *Xuán Tóng* [‘Mysterious Unity’], taken as evidence to prove their truth, and when unavoidable, they are the truth—yet one must not force them.’ The above aligns with the *Wénzǐ’s* [*Chapter on the Martial Dao*] section.*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"When Bái Gōng of Chu rebelled, his forces were subdued by the *jiā* [a penal measure], and Yí Liáo of Shì Nán [Market South] played with his balls, resolving the feud between the two families. Sūn Shū’áo [Chancellor of Chu] lay down with a feather fan, and the people of Yǐng [Chu capital] abandoned their rebellion. This is quoted from the *Xuánwúguǐ* [‘Spiritless Xuán’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how Yí Liáo of Shì Nán and Sūn Shū’áo both employed the un-Way of the Way and the unstated eloquence of the unstated to resolve the feuds of the two families. This may be called ‘victory without battle, equanimity as the highest principle.’ To relish in victory yet not take pride in it, while others praise it, is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world. This is quoted from the *Liáng Huì Wáng* [‘Dialogues with King Liang of Huì’] chapter of the *Mencius*. Mencius saw King Xiāng of Liáng, the son of King Huì, named Hé. Upon leaving, he remarked: ‘Looking at him, he did not seem like a ruler; approaching him, I saw no one to fear. Suddenly, he asked: “How shall the world be settled?” I replied: “It is settled by unity.” Who can achieve unity? The king asked again, and I answered: “Those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity.” *Shì* means ‘to love’ or ‘to be fond of.’ Yet among those who shepherd the world, there are none who do not delight in killing. If there were someone who did not delight in killing, then the people of the world would all crane their necks, eagerly awaiting him. Truly so, the people would flock to him like water rushing downward, unstoppable.’ This is quoted from the *Lièzǐ* [‘Liezi’], where Zhào Xiāngzǐ dispatched his newly appointed officer Xīnzhì Mùzǐ to attack the Zhái [a tribe], and he emerged victorious. This is also quoted from the *Shuō Fú* [‘Discussing the Seal’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity.\"*\n\n「When it comes to auspicious matters, precedence is given to the left; for inauspicious matters, to the right. The *Piān Jiāngjūn* [“Associate General”] is placed on the left, and the *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] on the right—this is explained through the *Sāng Lǐ* [“Funeral Rites”]. Quoted from: *‘Precedence on the left, precedence on the right’*—this is from the *Tán Qióng* [“The Dried Bamboo”] chapter of the *Lǐjì* [“Book of Rites”]. Its meaning has already been detailed elsewhere; no need to repeat it here.\n\nNow, if one were to take this as an analogy: suppose a valiant warrior achieves victory and earns distinction, rising to the rank of *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] and dwelling on the right to preside over killing—then it is said that victory is treated with the rites of mourning, and he is not worthy of elevation.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless.\n*Pǔ* [“uncarved wood”/“primordial simplicity”], though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.\n\n**Elaborating the Meaning:**\nThe talents of the world include those who can command the eyes through clarity, the ears through sharpness, the strength through valor, and the speech through eloquence. These are all named qualities, which the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity does not employ. Quoted from the *Zhòng Nǐ* [“Confucius”] chapter of the *Lièzǐ* [“Liezi”]:\nThe marshes of *Zhèng* [“Zheng”] were abundant with sages, and the *East Rì* [“East Village”] was rich with talents.\nAmong the marsh’s retainers was a man called *Bó Fēngzǐ* [“Master Bo Feng”], who, while passing through the East Village, encountered *Dèng Xī* [“Deng Xi”].\nDeng Xi glanced at his followers and laughed: *“You dance and prance to deceive that coming one, Master Bo Feng! What do you think of him?”*\nHis followers replied: *“We wish to know his reputation.”*\nDeng Xi was a renowned debater and sage of Zheng.\nHe asked Bo Fengzǐ: *“Do you understand the principle of nurturing?”*\n*“He who loves and nurtures others yet cannot nurture himself is but a dog or pig.”*\n*“To nurture things while they in turn serve you—that is the power of man.”*\n*“If you command your followers to eat until full, wear until at ease, and manage state affairs, then you are fulfilling the role of a governing official. Yet they gather in age groups, and you provide them with nothing more than prison cells, stables, and kitchens—what difference is there between you and a dog or pig?”*\nBo Fengzǐ did not respond.\nThen Bo Fengzǐ’s followers, one by one, stepped forward and said: *“Master, you have not heard of the abundance of skilled craftsmen in Qi and Lu? There are those who excel in earthwork and carpentry, those who excel in metalwork and leathercraft, those who excel in music and song, those who excel in arithmetic and record-keeping, those who excel in military strategy, and those who excel in temple rites—all talents are present. Yet none hold official rank, nor can they be properly employed. Those who place them in office lack knowledge, and those who employ them lack ability. Yet it is knowledge and ability that are needed to employ them. The officials are merely those we appoint; why do you boast?”*\nDeng Xi had no reply, and he fixed his gaze upon his followers before departing.\nThis illustrates how those with knowledge, talent, and ability are employed by those without—how can they be held in esteem?\n\nThus, those who embrace the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity do not flaunt their reputation or display their talents. They remain obscure and silent, wandering freely through the world, and none dare employ them. When ordinary men see such individuals, they do not need words to explain—merely by observing them, the Dao/Way is preserved. All things naturally submit and follow their transformation.\nHence, the Classic states:\n*The Dao/Way is ever nameless.\nUncarved wood, though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.*\n\n**Elaborating the Meaning:**\nEven dust and chaff can mold the *Yáo Shùn* [“Emperors Yao and Shun”].\nQuoted from the *Xiāoyáo Yóu* [“Free and Easy Wandering”] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*:\n*“When the great flood submerged the heavens, they did not drown. In the great drought, metal and stone melted, mountains withered, yet they did not feel the heat.”*\nIt is their dust and chaff that could shape Yao and Shun—who would dare to treat such matters as their own?\n\n**Annotation:**\nYao and Shun are merely names of worldly affairs.\nThose who act for the sake of names are not true to the Dao/Way.\nThus, Yao and Shun are not merely Yao and Shun—they must embody the reality of the *Shénrén* [“Divine/Sage Person”].\nNow, what we call Yao and Shun are but labels for their dust and chaff.\n\n**End of the Eighth Scroll of *Mìo* [“Marvelous”] from *Yùjué Lì* [“Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’]**\n**End of the Ninth Scroll of *Yùjué Lì* [“Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’]\"]**\n\n「The *Five-Peak* [Wǔfēng] Collection of Master Rùshòu Guózhèng\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: *Knowing Others is Wisdom***\n\nKnowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nIf one distinguishes black and white.\n\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“Master Zhuang”]—**Outer Chapters, *Tiānyùn* [“Heaven’s Destiny”] Scroll**—\nZhuāngzi said: “The wild goose [huà, also *hè*], like the crane, does not need to bathe daily to become white, nor does the crow need to be struck with pitch to become black. The simplicity of black and white is not what makes them distinct. This is because black and white are naturally so.”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nWisdom lies in discerning the vice and virtue of others.\n\nQuoted from *Mèngzǐ* [“Master Meng”]:\n“What resides in people is nothing finer than their pupils. The pupils cannot conceal their evil. If the heart is upright, the pupils will be bright. If the heart is not upright, the pupils will be dull. Listen to their words and observe their pupils, and how can one deceive you? How can one hide from you? *Yù* [“hide”]. This means that a person’s vice and virtue are revealed in their pupils. When people interact with things, their spirit manifests in their eyes. Thus, if the heart is upright, the spirit will gather and the eyes will shine. If the heart is not upright, the spirit will scatter and the eyes will grow dim. By observing this, one cannot fail to see a person’s vice and virtue, good and evil. Hence it is said: *Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nYet they cannot see their own eyelashes.\n\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll of *Gēngsāng Chǔ* [“Elder Geng Sang”]**:\nLǎozi [Master Lao] said: “I once saw you as though you were my eyebrows and eyelashes, my hair and fur.” *Zhījiān* [“between”].\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThen again, one must know oneself.\n\nQuoted from the *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* [“Appendices of the *Book of Changes*”]:\n“Then again, one must know oneself”—meaning that if one can repeatedly reflect upon oneself, one will know one’s own gains and losses.\n\nThe one who overcomes others has strength; the one who overcomes themselves is powerful.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe way of constant victory.\n\nQuoted from the *Lièzǐ* [“Master Lie”]—**Scroll of *Huángdì* [“The Yellow Emperor”]**:\n“There is a way of constant victory in the world, and there is a way that is not constant. The way of constant victory is called *softness* [rǒu]; the way that is not constant is called *strength* [qiáng]. These two terms may also be read as *ease* [yì]. Yet people do not know this. Hence, the teachings of antiquity say: ‘The strong first do not act like the strong; the soft first act like the soft.’ Those who first do not act like the strong, when they reach the point of acting like the strong, are in danger.”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nYì [Yi the Archer] excelled in archery, and Jīu [Jiutang] excelled in rowing boats, both relying on strength to overcome others. Yet neither attained their own death.\n\nQuoted from the *Lúnyǔ* [“Analects”]—**Scroll of *Xiànwèn* [“Conduct and Military Affairs”], Chapter Fourteen**:\nNángōng Shì [Nan Gongshi] asked Confucius: “If it were Nan Róng [Nan Rong], who would Yi the Archer and Jiutang overcome in boat rowing, both would not attain their natural end. Yi was the ruler of the state of *Yǒuyú Shì* [‘State of Youyu’], the most skilled archer of his time. He usurped the throne of *Tàikàng* [‘Great Kang’] of the Xia dynasty and established himself, but his minister *Hándí* [Han Ni] killed him and took his place. The *Chūnqiū Zhuàn* [“Transmissions of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*”] states that Jiutang was the son of *Jiāo Tìng* [‘Jiao Ting’], whose strength allowed him to row a boat across land. Later, he was killed by *Xiàhòu Shàokāng* [‘Xiahou Shaokang’].”\n\nYì and Jiutang were both powerful and violent figures of old, yet neither attained their natural end. Both relied on their strength not only to overcome others but also to fail in overcoming themselves—this is what Lǎozi [Master Lao] warned people against.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\n“To sit on gold and leather [*rèn jīn gé*], dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North.\n\nQuoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:\n“To sit on gold and leather, dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North. *Rèn* [“sitting on”], meaning a mat or a bedroll. *Jīn gé* [“gold and leather”] refers to weapons: *gold* [jīn] to spears and *leather* [gé] to armor. The North’s climate is harsh and resolute, so to conquer others with daring strength is considered *strength*—the deed of the strong.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Master [Confucius] spoke of “harmony without dissipation, steadfastness without leaning”—this is the power of *rectification* [jiāo].\n\nQuoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:\n“The gentleman is harmonious without dissipation, powerful in his steadfastness!” *Jiāo* [“powerful”] is described in the *Shījīng* [“Book of Odes”] as: *“Jiāo jiāo wǔ fū”* [“Resolute, resolute, the martial man”]. *Lì* [“lean”] means partiality or bias. This is what is called the impossible feat of the *middle path* [zhōngyōng]. It is not because they cannot overcome themselves; rather, it is because their personal desires cannot choose and hold to virtue and righteousness. Where does the Master’s power lie? In this, the Master instructed Zǐlú [Zilu], suppressing his impulsive vigor and advancing him with the courage of virtue and righteousness.\n\nThe contented attain wealth; the resolute attain purpose.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nZhuāngzi said: “Zēngzǐ [Zengzi] dwelt in Wèi [Wei], wearing a patched hemp cloak with no lining.”\n\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll\n\n「Not losing one’s place brings lasting stability; dying yet not perishing brings enduring life.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nIt is the abiding constancy. The *Xiàng* [“image”/symbol] states: *“The noble man stands firm without altering his Dao/Way, thus not losing his place.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhōuyǐ Dáguà* [“*Yì* [‘*Changes*]—**Hexagram of Constancy**] are the words of many: *“Constancy (héng) is enduring duration (jiǔ). The strong ascends while the yielding descends. The strong is revered; the yielding is humbled—thus one attains their yielding.”*\nThe *Xiàng* [“image”/symbol] says: *“Thunder and wind in constancy—thus the noble man stands firm without altering his Dao/Way.”*\nThe noble man establishes himself, attaining the Dao/Way of enduring duration, unchanging in his course. His course is like the Dao/Way itself.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nLǐzǐ [Liezi]’s refusal to transform. Quoted from the *Lìzǐ* [“*Liezi*”]—**Scroll of Heaven and Destiny** are the words of his disciples. He said: *“There is birth yet no birth, there is transformation yet no transformation. Not born by things, not transformed by things—thus he can be born among all beings, transformed by all transformations.”*\nHe who does not birth can birth all things; he who does not transform can transform all things. The one who births cannot avoid birth; the one who transforms cannot avoid transformation.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nZhuāngzi’s [Zhuangzi’s] immortality. Quoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“*Zhuangzi*”]—**Scroll of the Great Master** says:\n*“Only when external birth is achieved can one then attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, one can then perceive the singular. Perceiving the singular, one can then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, one can then achieve neither death nor birth.”*\nHe who can harmonize with the *rén* [“human”] yet not exalt the morning, who forgets the far and near of time—this is the one who perceives the singular.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe *Shì* [“Buddha”/“*Religion of the Thusness*”]’s imperishability. Quoted from the *Zhuándēng Lù* [*“Record of the Transmission of the Lamp”*]:\nHuìnéng [Huineng] the Great Master said to the inner attendant Xuē Jiǎn [Xue Jian]: *“When I speak of neither birth nor annihilation, it is because originally there was no birth, and now there is no annihilation. This is the clear understanding of attaining eternal life.”*\nThis means: when a person dwells in the world between heaven and earth, if they rest in their innate nature, entrust themselves to the harmony of the Dao/Way, and come and go with the transformations of nature—then the noble man observes the actions of a person, and knows their longevity or brevity. How much more so for those who cultivate the Great Dao/Way and nourish the primordial *hé* [“harmony”], yet cannot attain eternal life?\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\n*“The body is like cicada shell or snake skin—it is merely shed and abandoned.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“*Zhuangzi*”]—**Scroll of Equalizing All Things** are the words:\nWàngliǎng [Wangliang] asked the *Yǐng* [“shadow”]. The shadow said: *“I await the snake’s shedding, its skin clinging beneath its belly, unable to move.”*\nIs it like cicada wings? If one awaits the snake’s shedding like cicada wings, then there is no particular purpose to cling to—thus one seeks endless blame, ultimately reaching ‘no awaiting’ and not uniquely transforming in the *Xuānmíng* [“Mysterious Darkness”].\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao/Way is Boundless**\nThe Great Dao/Way is boundless, yet it can be found on either side.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Dao/Way is supremely high and has no above; supremely deep and has no below. Above it, there is no above; below it, there is no below. It can be high and deep, can ascend and descend. Level as a carpenter’s rule, straight as a plumb line—yet not a rule to level, thus all is even; not a plumb line to straighten, thus all is upright.\nRound as a compass, square as a set-square—yet not round to make round, thus without roundness; not square to make square, thus without squareness. It envelops heaven and earth yet has no outer or inner; its greatness has no limits, its subtlety no depths.\nPiercing like an unfurling cover, yet nothing obstructs it. Great roundness without boundary, great passage without hindrance.\nThus, those who embody the Dao/Way do not grow angry nor rejoice. Their sitting is without care, their sleep without dreams—thus they are in perfect *Xuāntóng* [“Mysterious Harmony”].\nAs proof: the Dao/Way is vast and boundless, yet it can be found on either side.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Great Dao/Way is nowhere not present—whether left or right, all encounter its source.\nQuoted from the *Mèngzǐ* [“*Mencius*”]—**Scroll of Leaving and Liao** [“*Leaving and Liao*”] says:\n*“The noble man deeply cultivates with the Dao/Way, seeking to attain it himself. Attaining it himself, he rests in it securely. Resting in it securely, his resources grow profound. His resources profound, he can take from it on either side and always find its source.”*\nThus, the noble man seeks to attain it himself. This is the one who embodies the Dao/Way, turning inward to find it within.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol**\nGrasping the Great Symbol, all under heaven come forth.»\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Symbol (Continued)**\n\n*\"Going forth without harm, peace and ease prevail.\"*\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nShun’s conduct was pure and benevolent—his people rejoiced in him.\nThree times he moved the capital to Chengdu, until at Deng’s ruins, ten thousand families came to him.\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ* [“*Chuang Tzu*”]—**Section on Xu Wu Gui** [“*The Spirit of the Dead*”]—its meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nThe Great King resided in Fēng, but the Di people invaded, so he settled beneath Qí Mountain, and those who followed him came as if to market.\nQuoted from the *Mèngzǐ* [“*Mencius*”]—**Scroll of the Dialogues with King Liang Hui of Qi, Lower**—its meaning is already detailed; no need to repeat it.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nWhen the people of Teng asked: *“The people of Qi are about to fortify Xué—how can this be prevented?”*\nMencius’ reply to the Lord of Teng is already thoroughly explained; no need to repeat it.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nWhen the realm is secure and the people prosperous, all rejoice in great peace.\nQuoted from the *Língbǎo Wúliàngdù Rén Jīng* [“*Scripture of the Soul’s Infinite Liberation*”], Upper Scroll:\n*“Equal in compassion, differing in form yet united in kinship—when the realm is secure and the people prosperous, all rejoice in great peace.”*\nThis speaks of the sage-ruler, to whom all people flock without harm, all joyfully finding ease and peace.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nWhen balanced, there is no peril of steepness or decline.\nQuoted from the *Yì Jìshí* [“*Appended Statements of the *Yì* [‘*Changes*’]*”]:\nThe *Yì* says: *“Without balance, there is no decline—decline is the result of imbalance.”*\nMusic and bait—even travelers will stop.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nThe *Zhuāngzǐ* records: North Gate Cheng questioned the Yellow Emperor, saying:\n*“Your Majesty displayed the music of Xiánchí in the wilds of Dòngtíng.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzǐ*—**Section on Heaven’s Design**—\nNorth Gate Cheng, a subject of the Yellow Emperor, sought to elucidate the Dao of supreme music, thus engaging these two in dialogue.\nXiánchí, a name for music. *Zhang*, to perform. *Xián* is harmony. Dòngtíng’s wilds refer to the space between Heaven and Earth—not the lake Dòngtíng.\n*Yù*, to retreat in weariness. *Zú*, to conclude. *Fù*, to repeat. *Huò*, to be confused. *Bù wù*, not to awaken to supreme music.\nAt first hearing, one is startled in fear.\nUpon hearing it again, one gradually grasps its meaning, so fear retreats in weariness.\nAt last hearing, one knows supreme music—harmonizing with the Two Forces, sight and hearing vanish, the mind undivided, like one in darkness and confusion.\nGentle and even, without bias, silent and without knowing, lost in seated forgetfulness—self and objects both forgotten—this is *zuòwáng* [“seated forgetfulness”].\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng*:**\nWhen the people of Qi suffered famine, Qián’áo prepared food by the roadside to feed the hungry.\nA starving man, sleeves tucked and sandals worn, came shuffling in exchange—Qián’áo held food in his left hand and drink in his right, saying: *“Come, eat!”*\nThe man raised his brows and glared, saying: *“I would rather starve to death than accept food given with such contempt.”*\nQuoted from the *Mèngzǐ*—**Scroll of Dialogues with Gào Zǐ, Upper**—\nMencius said: *“A single basket of rice, a single bowl of soup—if obtained, one lives; if not, one dies. If given with a sneer, even a wayfarer would refuse it. If given with a kick, even a beggar would scorn it.”*\nZhū Xī’s annotation: *Dòu*, a wooden vessel. *Hūtuò*, the sound of spitting. *Xíngdào zhī rén*, an ordinary traveler.\n\n「**Zhū Xī’s annotations:**\n*Cù*, to trample or tread upon. *Qǐrén*, the beggar. *Bùxiè*, not deeming it pure or worthy. Though the hunger is dire, yet he still abhors rudeness—there are those who would rather die than eat from such contempt. This shows that the innate sense of shame and disgust in all people is stronger than the fear of death.\n\nThis passage shares similar meaning with the refusal of food given with a sneer, hence its inclusion as evidence. It illustrates that hunger is a grave affliction for man, yet when food is offered without respect, even travelers would refuse it, let alone beg for it. This is the rejection of food due to insufficient courtesy.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nZhuangzi said: *“Righteousness and justice are but the guesthouses of ancient kings—one may lodge there for a night, but cannot dwell long.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhuangzi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Destiny**—\n*Schūlù*, guesthouses or inns. One cannot stay long.\n\nTo employ righteousness for universal love and justice to restrain wrongdoing—what is this but a temporary shelter, like lodging in an inn? It cannot be a lasting bond. The Daoist’s transformation of people is through the Way itself, enduring and tranquil. How could it be dispersed?\n\nThe Way’s expression is subtle, without taste. To look at it, one cannot see its form; to listen to it, one cannot hear its sound; to use it, one cannot exhaust its potential.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nLiezi said: *“The form that shapes the form is substantial, yet the shaping of forms is not always present.”*\nQuoted from the *Liezi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Bountiful Grace**—\nThe meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it. This speaks of the efficacy of *wuwei* (non-action) aligning with the Way, its truth indeed boundless.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Principle of Inversion**\nWhen one would gather, one must first let loose.\nWhen one would weaken, one must first let grow strong.\nWhen one would discard, one must first let flourish.\nWhen one would take away, one must first give.\nThis is called *subtle illumination* (*wēimíng*).\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThe profound mysteries of the Sage are nowhere more exquisite than in the interplay of *power* (*quán*) and *substance* (*shí*).\nQuoted from the *Tang* annotation by **Du Tian Shi** (Du the Master of the Tang):\nThe Sage’s teachings are divided into two paths—*power* and *substance*. The superior scholar, with keen insight, grasps the true essence of *substance*. The mediocre or lesser scholar must be guided through the path of *power*.\n\nThe methods of *power* are vast and adaptable. Following the scriptures, four key principles are outlined:\n1. *“When one would gather, one must first let loose”*—this restrains the mind.\n2. *“When one would weaken, one must first let grow strong”*—this restrains the nature.\n3. *“When one would discard, one must first let flourish”*—this restrains desire.\n4. *“When one would take away, one must first give”*—this restrains greed.\n\nIf the mind is restrained in its extravagance, the Way becomes harmonious.\nIf the mind is unrestrained, excess arises.\nBy fostering excess, one invites error, then reflecting, one returns to restraint.\nThis is the *power* of gathering the mind.\n\nIf the nature is weak, virtue is preserved whole.\nIf the nature is strong, calamity ensues.\nBy fostering strength, one invites calamity, then reflecting, one returns to weakness.\nThis is the *power* of subduing the nature’s strength.\n\nIf desire is few, conduct remains pure.\nIf desire is many, the spirit becomes turbid.\nWhen desire deepens and turbidity reaches its extreme, one reflects and returns to purity.\nThis is the *power* of discarding desire and clarifying the spirit.\n\nIf one is not greedy, frugality prevails.\nIf greed is extreme, ruin befalls the body.\nBy fostering greed, one invites ruin, then reflecting, one returns to frugality.\nThis is the *power* of cultivating frugality to overcome greed.\n\nAll these methods first push to the utmost the unrestrained heart, so that it becomes entangled in avarice and desire, before guiding it back to its true nature and the Way.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem contrary to the principle of *wuwei* (self-transformation through non-action), but the nature varies in acuity, and enlightenment differs in gradual or sudden attainment. Those who attain sudden enlightenment need no guidance through *power*; those who progress gradually require skillful inducement. Thus arises the distinction between *power* and *substance*.\n\nThe Way and its teachings ultimately converge in great principle, hence it is said that *power* is precious in harmonizing meaning.\n\nThe petty man scorns *power*, and the Way is thereby accused of deceit. Hence, *power* cannot be lightly revealed to those who do not understand the Way.\n\nThe *Analects* say: *“One may be able to stand with [him], but not yet to employ *power* with [him].”* This speaks of the difficulty of using *power*.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThis is how the Sage knows that when one treads upon frost, the coming of solid ice is near.\nQuoted from the *Zhouyi*—**Hexagram *Kūn* (The Receptive)**—\n**Line One:** *Treading upon frost, solid ice comes.*\n\nThis refers to the subtle *yin* energy of the first line, like the beginning of cold, yet by gradually accumulating its presence, solid ice forms. Though the Way initially appears soft and yielding, its gradual accumulation leads to firmness and strength.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nGōu Jiàn (勾践) sought to weaken the state of Wu, yet he urged them to attack Qi.\nQuoted from the *Shiji* (Records of the Grand Historian):\n**Confucius in Wei**, hearing that **Tiān Cháng** (田常) of Qi sought to create chaos, told his disciples: *“I cannot bear to see my ancestral homeland suffer at the hands of an enemy.”*\n\nNow I desire to humble my stance before **Tiān Cháng** (田常) to save **Lǚ** (鲁), yet who shall I send as an envoy?\n\nZǐ Gòng (子贡) volunteered to serve as the envoy. The Master (夫子) consented.\n\nThus, he went to Qi (齐) and persuaded **Tiān Cháng** to delay his troops. \"I will seek aid from Wu (吴) to save Lǚ, but now I ask you to attack Qi (齐) while Wu's forces welcome you.\" **Tiān Cháng** agreed.\n\nZǐ Gòng then went south to persuade the **Wu King** (吴王), saying: *\"In name, we save Lǚ, but in truth, we aim to constrain the powerful state of Qi. By aiding Lǚ and attacking Qi, our prestige shall extend to the Jin state (晋国). The other lords will surely follow suit and pay homage, and the hegemonic enterprise will flourish.\"*\n\nThe **Wu King** then dispatched Zǐ Gòng to the **Yue** (越). Zǐ Gòng said: *\"Wu has persuaded our king to aid Lǚ and attack Qi, yet their true intent is to weaken Yue. The Wu King desires this but fears Yue.\"*\n\n**Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) bowed his head to the ground and said: *\"I, the humble one, have always been unprepared for strength, yet I dared to oppose Wu (吴). I was constrained at **Kuài Jī** (会稽), my suffering piercing to the marrow, my lips and tongue parched day and night. I only wished to follow the Wu King to death in his footsteps—that was my earnest desire. Now, if you, my great minister, would kindly inform me of the advantages and harms, I would be most grateful.\"*\n\nZǐ Gòng said: *\"The Wu King is a fierce and violent man. His ministers cannot endure him, and his state is exhausted. This is the opportune moment to retaliate against him.\"*\n\nThe **Yue King** (越王) **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) then sent his minister **Wén Zhǒng** (文种) to bow before the Wu King and say: *\"Yue offers all three thousand warriors within its borders to serve Wu.\"*\n\nThe Wu King accepted the **Yue King’s** terms, pardoned **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践), and allowed him to remain. He then mobilized his own troops to attack Qi and defeated them.\n\nZǐ Gòng then went north to see the **Jin Lord** (晋君). *\"Now that Qi is weakened, Wu and Jin shall meet at **Huáng Pó** (黄池).\"* The **Yue King** (越王) seized the opportunity to attack Wu (吴). The Wu King returned and fought against Yue, but was annihilated.\n\nThe **Master** (孔子) said: *\"If one could indeed disrupt Qi to save Lǚ, that was my initial wish. If they could further strengthen Jin to weaken Wu, and if Wu were to perish while Yue became hegemon—that was Zǐ Gòng’s strategy. Yet, ‘beautiful words harm sincerity; be cautious with speech.’\"*\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThe **Qi King** (齐桓公) loved delicacies, and **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooked his own son to please him.\nThe **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him.\nThe **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians.\n\nQuoted from the *Huáinánzǐ*—**Section *Zhǔshù* (主术训)**—\nThe *Hóngliè Jiě* (鸿烈解) states: *\"The Qi King loved delicacies, and Yì Yá cooked his own son to please him.\"* According to the *Shiji*—**Qi Family History** (齐世家)—\nInitially, the **Qi King** (齐桓公) had three wives, yet none bore him children. He indulged in concubines, numbering six like his wives, with the eldest being **Wèi Jī** (卫姬), who bore **Wú Kuī** (无亏). The younger **Wèi Jī** bore **Huì Gōng** (惠公元). **Zhèng Jī** (郑姬) bore **Xiào Gōng** (孝公昭). **Gě Yíng** (葛嬴) bore **Zhāo Gōng** (昭公潘). **Mì Jī** (密姬) bore **Yì Gōng** (懿公商人). **Sòng Huá Zǐ** (宋华子), as **Jiá Qí** (贾逵) said, was the daughter of the **Sòng Huá** (宋华) clan, of the **Zǐ** (子) lineage, and bore **Gōng Zǐ Yōng** (公子雍). **Yōng** (雍) was the chief of the **Yōng** (雍) officials, who served at the **Master’s** (桓公) table. There were inner and outer **Yōng** officials, and this man was named **Chéng** (丞) for the **Yōng** (雍) office—**Yì Yá** (易牙) was he. Through the eunuch **Shù Dāo** (竖刁), he offered lavish gifts to the **Qi King**, gaining favor. The **Qi King** granted his request.\n\nOnce **Yì Yá** (易牙) gained the **Qi King’s** favor, he petitioned for the eldest **Wèi Jī** (卫姬) to establish **Wú Kuī** (无亏) as heir. **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) fell ill, and the **Qi King** asked: *\"Among my ministers, who is capable of succeeding you?\"* **Guān Zhòng** replied: *\"No one knows his subjects better than the ruler.\"* The **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Yì Yá** (易牙)?\"* He answered: *\"He killed his own son to please you—this is not human nature, and he cannot be trusted.\"* The **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Kāifāng** (开方)?\"* He answered: *\"He abandoned his own son, the crown prince of a thousand chariots, to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to approach.\"* **Kāifāng** (开方) was the **Qi King’s** son, who had removed the crown prince of a thousand chariots and submitted himself to his father.\n\nThe **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Gōng Zǐ Shù Dāo** (公子竖刁)?\"* He answered: *\"He castrated himself to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to trust.\"*\n\nWhen **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) died, the **Qi King** did not heed his warnings and ultimately relied on these three men. The three men held absolute power—this is what is meant by **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooking his own son to ingratiate himself with the **Qi King**.\n\nThe **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him. According to the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋), **Lí Gōng** (僖公) in the second year said:\n**Jìn Gǒu Xī** (晋苟息) requested to use the **carriage of horses** from **Qú** (屈产) and the **jewel of Chuí Jié** (垂棘) to borrow passage through **Yu** (虞) and attack **Huò** (虢). **Xún Xī** (荀息) was **Xún Shù** (荀叔). **Qú** (屈) produced fine horses, and **Chuí Jié** (垂棘) yielded beautiful jade—thus their names. Four horses make a **carriage** (乘). The path from Jin to Huò passed through Yu, so passage was requested.\n\nThe **Jin King** said: *\"These are my treasures.\"* **Xún Xī** replied: *\"If you gain passage through Yu, it is like possessing an outer granary.\"* The **Jin King** said: *\"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) remains there.\"* **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) was a loyal minister of Yu. **Xún Xī** replied: *\"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) is a weak man who cannot give strong advice. Moreover, he is younger than you, and you favor him. Even if he advises you, you will not listen.\"*\n\nThe **Jin King** did not heed **Míng Zhī Qí**’s warnings. He then borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò, and **Xún Xī** (荀息) offered rich gifts to win favor. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised against it, but was not listened to. Jin’s army then destroyed **Xià Yáng** (下阳).\n\nIn the fifth year, the **Jin King** again borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised him: *\"Yu and Huò are neighbors. If Huò falls, Yu will surely follow. Jin cannot be provoked, nor can an enemy be trifled with. To do this once is already too much—how can it be done twice?\"* The proverb says: *\"Like a carriage and its axle, or lips and teeth—if one perishes, the other cannot survive.\"* This refers to Yu and Huò.\n\nThe **Yu King** (虞公) did not listen. In the twelfth month of winter, on the first day of the new moon (**Gěng Zǐ** 丙子), Jin destroyed Huò. The **Huò King** (虢公), **Chǒu** (丑), fled to the capital of **Jīng** (京师). Jin’s army returned and camped in Yu, then attacked and annihilated it. They captured the **Yu King** (虞公) and his ministers, including **Bó** (伯), and used them to humiliate **Qín Mù Gōng** (秦穆公)’s daughter, who was sent as a **bride** (媵).\n\nThe **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians. According to the *Shiji*—**Qin Family History** (秦本纪)—\nIn the thirty-fourth year of **Qín Mù Gōng** (秦穆公), the **Róng King** (戎王) sent **Yóu Yú** (由余) to Qin.\n\nYóu Yú, whose lineage was originally from **Jìn**, fled and entered the **Róng**, yet he retained his ability to speak **Jìn’s tongue**. Having heard of **Qín Mù Gōng**’s virtue, the **Róng King** thus sent Yóu Yú to observe Qin.\n\nAt this, **Qín Mù Gōng** withdrew and consulted **Nèishǐ Liào** (内史廖), saying: *\"I have heard that neighboring lands possess a sage—this is a cause for concern among rival states. Now Yóu Yú is virtuous, and he is my undoing. What shall I do with him?\"*\n\n**Nèishǐ Liào** replied: *\"The **Róng King** dwells among the **Qún Nì** (群匿), and has yet to hear the sounds of the **Central States** (中国). Your Highness might try sending him female musicians, to disrupt his resolve, and then request Yóu Yú’s presence, to create distance between them. Retain him without sending him back, thus breaking his expectations. The **Róng King** will surely suspect him, and if there is discord between the king and his subject, he may be captured. Moreover, the **Róng King** loves music, and will surely neglect his governance.\"*\n\n**Qín Mù Gōng** said: *\"Excellent.\"* Then, he seated Yóu Yú on a curved couch, served him food with ceremonial vessels, and interrogated him thoroughly about the terrain and military strength of the **Róng**. Only afterward did he command **Nèishǐ Liào** to send the **Róng King** eight sets of female musicians. The **Róng King** received them and delighted in them, never returning for an entire year. Thus, Qin recalled Yóu Yú. He then advised, but the **Róng King** did not heed him. **Qín Mù Gōng** repeatedly sent envoys to entice Yóu Yú, who eventually departed and submitted.\n\n**Qín Mù Gōng** treated him with guest courtesies and inquired about the strategy for attacking the **Róng**. In the thirty-seventh year, Qin employed Yóu Yú’s counsel to assault the **Róng King**, expanding its territory by twelve states and a thousand *lǐ*, and thus became the hegemon of the **Western Róng**.\n\nThis is how **Qín Mù Gōng** used female musicians to entice the **Hu Lord** (胡王).\n\nHence, **Xuán Tóng** cited this to illustrate how **Shè Zhāng** (歙张) wielded the power of attraction and repulsion in this manner.\n\n**Yǎn Yì** (衍义) states: The **Master Zhuāng** (庄子) recounts how **Xu Nuóguǐ** (徐无鬼), surnamed Xu and given the name Nuóguǐ, a **recluse** (隐士) of **Wèi**, first attended to the **Wèi King’s** (魏武侯) dogs and horses, then spared his **spirit and form** (神形), and finally proposed matters of governance. This is the wisdom of one who understands the **art of attraction and repulsion** (歙张之权).\n\nHe excerpted the text from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Xu Nuóguǐ Chapter** (徐无鬼篇):\n\n*\"Xu Nuóguǐ, surnamed Xu and given the name Nuóguǐ, was a **recluse** (隐士) of **Wèi**. Through **Yú Shāng** (女商), he saw **Wèi Wǔhóu** (魏武侯). Yú Shāng, with the surname **Nǚ** (女) and given name **Shāng**, was a favored minister of **Wèi**. **Wèi Wǔhóu** was the son of **Wèi Wénhóu** (魏文侯), the eighth-generation descendant of **Bì Wàn** (毕万).\"*\n\n**Wèi Wǔhóu** addressed him, saying: *\"Master, you must be weary. You endure the toil of the mountains and forests, and thus deign to see me, your humble subject.\"*\n\n**Xu Nuóguǐ** replied: *\"I toil for you, yet what toil do you endure for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your pleasures and aversions, your very essence and life will fall ill. If you suppress your desires and constrain your pleasures and aversions, your ears and eyes will suffer. I toil for you—what toil do you endure for me?\"*\n\n**Wèi Wǔhóu** remained silent, his expression aloof.\n\nAfter a moment, **Xu Nuóguǐ** said: *\"Let me speak of my observations of dogs. The lowest kind seeks only to fill its belly—that is the nature of a fox. The middle kind gazes at the sun, while the highest seems to have lost a part of itself. But even my observations of dogs pale beside my observations of horses. A straight horse aligns with the plumb line, a curved one with the hook, a square one with the carpenter’s square, a round one with the compass—that is the horse of a kingdom. Yet even that does not compare to the horse of the world.\n\nThe horse of the world, when it has reached its peak, is like one who fears and trembles. If it stumbles, if it seems to lose a part of itself—such a horse transcends dust, leaving no trace, its whereabouts unknown.\"*\n\n**Wèi Wǔhóu** was overjoyed and laughed aloud.\n\nAs **Xu Nuóguǐ** departed, **Yú Shāng** said: *\"Master, how did you so delight our lord?\"*\n\n*\"Those who counsel our lord,\"* replied **Xu Nuóguǐ**, *\"speak to him of *shī* and *shū*, of *lǐ* and *yuè* when addressing him from afar, or of *Jīnbǎn Liùtāo* and *Jīnbǎn Liùwéi*—these are titles from the *Zhōu Shū*. They also speak of *wénwǔ hǔbàolóngquǎn*, which is called *Lǚ Wàng’s Liùwéi*. Those who serve with great merit are countless, yet our lord has never opened his mouth to them. Today, how did you so delight our lord?\"*\n\n*\"I spoke only of my observations of dogs and horses,\"* said **Xu Nuóguǐ**.\n\n*\"Is that all?\"* asked **Yú Shāng**.\n\n*\"Have you not heard of the exiled man of Yúe?\"* he said. *\"After a few days away from his homeland, he rejoices to see those he knows. After a month, he rejoices to see those he once saw at home. After a year, he rejoices even at the sight of one who resembles a man. Is it not that the longer one is distant from people, the deeper one’s longing for them becomes? The man who flees into emptiness clings to the narrow paths of *lídié*, stumbling through the void—yet when he hears the sound of footsteps approaching, he rejoices. How much more so when he hears the cough of kin or loved ones at his side! For long have none spoken the words of the True Person to our lord, their voices coughing beside him. This is how one must first strike the chord before speaking of governance—then he will surely take delight. This too is the art of attraction and repulsion.\"*\n\nThus **Xuán Tóng** recorded this to illustrate the principle.\n\n*\"The soft overcomes the hard. Fish cannot be dragged from the depths, and the sharpest tools of a kingdom must not be displayed to the people.\"*\n\n**Corollary:** *\"Just as fish cannot be dragged from the depths—for if they were, they would be caught. I excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Gēngsāng Chú Chapter**:*\n\n*The beasts of the wicker carriage, if they break free and climb the mountains, will not escape the nets. The fish that swallows a boat, if it is stranded and loses the water, even ants will torment it. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of heights, and fish and turtles do not tire of depths. Is this not what is meant?\"*\n\n**Corollary:** *\"This is called *dúhuà*—self-so transformation.\"*\n\nI excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Zài Yòu Chapter**: *\"The man of singular possession—this is called the utmost nobility.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the man of singular possession, whom the people gladly follow, whom the masses bear aloft, whom they would make their lord—not merely the utmost nobility, but the utmost reverence.\n\nFrom the *Dà Zōngshī Chapter*: *\"Only when the morning is clear can one see the singular. Only when one sees the singular can one transcend past and future. To follow the ceaseless renewal of the Transforming, to move with the ever-changing and yet never be swayed by things—this is called *dúhuà*.\"*\n\n**Corollary:** *\"The *Yì* says: *‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence.’* I excerpt from the *Yì Jìshī*:*\n\n*‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence’—this means compliance. To act in accordance with the times and suit the occasion is to exercise influence. If one does not comply with the times and adapt to change, one cannot exercise influence.\"*\n\n**Corollary:** *\"To fish, one must use the right bait.\"*\n\nI excerpt from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Xu Nuóguǐ Chapter**: *\"Thus the True Person detests the multitude, for the multitude brings discord, and discord brings harm. Therefore, he has no particular favorites, no particular estrangements. Embracing virtue and harmony, he aligns with the Dao of the world—this is the True Person.\"*\n\n*\"To ants, knowledge is discarded; to fish, strategy is found; to sheep, intention is abandoned.*\n\n**Explication:** *One who does not covet mutton discards knowledge for ants. One who does not teach others through the stench of mutton abandons intention for sheep. Having cast aside *rén* and *yì* in harmony with the Ultimate Way, unharmed and forgotten in the rivers and lakes, thus to fish, strategy is found—this is why these words censure Yú Shùn’s teaching through the stench of mutton.\"*\n\n**End of handwritten notes from *Yàodé Zhēnjīng Yǎnyì*, Volume Nine. Beginning of Volume Ten.**\n\n**Five-Peak Hermit Wang Shouzheng’s Collected Works**\n**Chapter Thirty-Seventh: The Dao Ever Does Without Doing**\n\nThe Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\n*The Yanyi* explains: The Dao’s constant is non-action.\n[Quoted from *Zhuangzi*’s *Tian Di* chapter.]\n\nThus it is said:\nThe ancients who nurtured the world—\nwithout desire, the world was sufficient;\nwithout doing, all things transformed.\n\nAgain it is said:\nTo do without doing is called Heaven;\nto speak without speaking is called virtue.\n*The Yanyi* explains: Few are the virtuous in the world, many the unvirtuous.\n[Quoted from *Zhuangzi*’s *Qū Qìe* chapter—\nthe words of the robber Zhí answering his followers.]\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nThe virtuous cannot stand without the Sage’s Dao,\nnor can Zhí act without it.\nFew are the virtuous in the world, many the unvirtuous—\nthus the Sage’s benefit to the world is little,\nwhile his harm to it is great.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Claim Virtue**\n\nThe supreme virtue does not claim virtue,\nand thus has virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus has no virtue.\n\n*The Yanyi* explains: *Zhīlí*’s actions—\nthe people use them daily yet know them not.\n[Quoted:] *Zhīlí*’s actions—\nhis virtue is disjointed, fractured, and scattered,\nnot displaying its function, not revealing its name’s meaning.\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*’s *Ren Jian Shi* chapter:\n*Zhīlí* the crippled—\nhis chin hid in his navel, his shoulders higher than his neck,\nhis hair tied upward, pointing to Heaven.\nFive orifices above—\nthe five orifices, the five viscera.\nHis thighs served as ribs.\nHe sharpened needles, mended nets,\nsewed clothes, and cleaned courtyards—\nenough to fill his belly.\nHe divined with tally sticks and milfoil stalks.\n\n**The Scattered Virtue**\n\nSowing seeds, enough to feed ten people.\nWhen the ruler summoned warriors, *Zhīlí* would bare his arms among them.\nWhen the ruler imposed great labor, *Zhīlí* would refuse work due to his chronic illness.\nWhen the ruler gave grain to the sick, *Zhīlí* would accept three *zhōng* of six *shí*, four *dòu*—a *zhōng*—and ten bundles of firewood.\nThough *Zhīlí*’s body was disjointed,\nstill he was able to nourish himself,\nand live out his natural years—\nhow much more so for one whose virtue was scattered!\n\nIf one could preserve his original Dao,\nthus, the people use it daily yet know it not.\n\n*The Yì Xìyì* states:\nOne yin and one yang—the Dao.\nTo follow it is good.\nTo complete it is nature.\nThe benevolent see it and call it benevolence,\nthe wise see it and call it wisdom.\nThe people use it daily yet know it not,\nthus the Dao of the noble is rare.\nThis is the Way of supreme virtue,\nwhich does not claim virtue,\nand thus the people use it daily yet know it not.\n\nWhen the ruler performed rites and there was no response,\nhe would bare his arms and press forward.\n*The Yanyi* explains:\nRites are to be followed—\nto be practiced and enacted.\nThey distinguish the high and low,\nand establish noble and ignoble.\n\n*The Yì Lǚ Guà Dàxiàng* states:\nAbove, Heaven; below, the marshes—\nthe *Lǚ* hexagram.\nThe noble one uses it to distinguish the high and low,\nand settle the people’s intentions.\n\n*The Yanyi* explains:\nJade and silk exchanged in procession,\nand dignified bearing in response.\n*The Lǘ Yǔ* (from the *Yáng Huò* chapter) states:\nConfucius said:\n“Rites, rites—\nis it jade and silk that is spoken of?\nMusic, music—\nis it bells and drums that is spoken of?”\n\n*The Lǐjì* (from the *Zhōngyōng* chapter) states:\nThree hundred rites of decorum,\nthree thousand dignities of bearing—\nin one word, it may be summed:\nDo not fail in reverence.\n\nRites are rooted in reverence,\nmusic in harmony.\nThat which commands awe is dignity,\nthat which sets the example is decorum.\nJade and silk are the implements of rites,\nto express their intent.\nBells and drums are the instruments of music,\nto guide its harmony.\nThus, reverence within harmony—\nthis is the foundation of rites and music.\nBells and drums—\nthis is the superficial aspect of rites and music.\n\nHence it is said:\nJade and silk exchanged in procession,\ndignified bearing in response,\nuplifted hands, bowed arms, clenched fists—\nadvancing and retreating with measured glances and gestures—\nthis is the outward form of rites.\nThus, when the superficial rites are met with no response,\nit reaches the point of bared arms and pressing forward.\n\n*The Yanyi* explains:\nUplifted hands, bowed arms, clenched fists—\nthis is the ritual of a subject.\n*Uplifted*—interlaced hands.\n*Bowed arms*—kneeling with bent knees.\n*Clenched fists*—bent waist.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* (from the *Dà Zōngshī* chapter) states:\nThe noble one uses rites as his wings,\nto move through the world.\nSince it is said that great rites align with Heaven and Earth,\nand that rites are used as wings to move through the world,\nhow could there be such disorder as bared arms and pressing forward?\n\n*The Yanyi* explains:\nTo come without returning is not rites.\nTo return without coming is also not rites.\n\n*The Lǐjì* states:\nThis is the way rites distinguish high and low,\nand separate near and distant.\n\n*Bared arms*—to roll up sleeves and bare arms,\nthen press forward and tug—\nthis is the ritual of response and reciprocity.\nWhen one acts thus and receives no response,\nthen in anger he presses forward and tugs.\n\n*The Yanyi* explains:\nA single word unanswered,\na single bow unreturned—\ntwo states would become desolate,\nthen one would bare his arms and press forward.\n\n*The Chūnqiū* (from the *Xuān Gōng* year twelve) states:\nThe Duke of Chu again sent envoys to seek alliance with Jin,\nand the people of Jin agreed.\nThe Duke of Chu said:\n“This is not within your knowledge.”\n\nKing Wu conquered Shang and composed a hymn:\n*\"To pacify the myriad states and ensure abundant harvests.\"*\n\nThe Way of **virtue/power** (武) restrains violence and ceases war,\npreserves the great and stabilizes achievements,\nsettles the people and harmonizes the masses,\nand enriches wealth—\nthis is its **virtue/power** (德).\nThus, he commands his descendants never to forget its principles.\nNow, I have caused the two states to suffer desolation and violence.\nToday, I wage a single battle and leave the people of Jin and Chu as desolate bones in the wild—\nthis is the failure to restrain violence.\n\n*The Yanyi* further expounds:\nDuring the Spring and Autumn period, the Duke of Chu (宣王) courted the feudal lords,\nand the records of *rites* (义) were fully documented.\n\nIt is also said:\nIn the age of **ultimate virtue/power** (至德), one acts sincerely without knowing it as loyalty.\n*The Yanyi* cites the words from the *Zhuangzi*—[*Xuan Tian Di* §] (天地篇):\nIn the age of **ultimate virtue/power** (至德),\none does not exalt the worthy,\nnor employ the capable.\nThe ruler is like a tree trunk,\nthe people like wild deer.\nOne acts upright without knowing it as **rites** (义),\nloves one another without knowing it as **benevolence** (仁),\nacts sincerely without knowing it as loyalty,\nresponds appropriately without knowing it as **trustworthiness** (信),\nand moves in harmony without considering it as a gift.\nThus, the true **Daoist** (大丈夫) dwells in its substance,\nnot in its superficiality.\nHe resides in its reality,\nnot in its embellishments.\nTherefore, he abandons that and takes this.\n\n*The Yanyi* further expounds:\nThis is why the scholars of Jin and Song indulge recklessly and forget restraint—\nuntil their states collapse and they perish without knowing it.\n\n*The Yanyi* cites:\nDuring the era of **Sima Zhao** (司马昭), three years passed,\nand **Qi Kang** (嵇康) of **Jiao Prefecture** (樵郡)\nwas renowned for his grand and splendid literary style,\nfond of discussing the *Zhuangzi* and *Laozi*,\nyet also valuing the odd and the chivalrous.\nHe was closely acquainted with **Ruan Ji** (阮籍) of **Chenliu** (陈留),\nhis brother **Ruan Xuan** (阮咸),\n**Shan Tao** (山涛) of **Hejin** (河内),\n**Xiang Xiu** (向秀) of **Henan** (河南),\n**Wang Rong** (王戎) of **Langye** (琅琊),\nand **Liu Ling** (刘伶) of **Pei** (沛).\nTogether, they were called the **Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove** (竹林七贤),\nall embracing emptiness,\ndespising rites and laws,\nindulging in wine and revelry,\nand neglecting worldly affairs.\n**Zhong Hui** (锺会), favored by **Sima Zhao**,\nheard of **Qi Kang**’s reputation and visited him.\n**Qi Kang** sat cross-legged, his sleeves rolled up,\nand did not rise to greet him.\nHui was about to leave.\n**Qi Kang** asked:\n“What have you heard that brought you here?\nWhat have you seen that makes you leave?”\nHui replied:\n“I have heard what I heard and seen what I saw.”\n**Qi Kang** deeply resented him.\n**Shan Tao**, serving as a **Briefing Department Officer** (吏部郎),\nrecommended **Qi Kang** to replace himself.\n**Qi Kang** wrote to him:\n“You claim I am unfit for the common world,\nyet you do not denigrate the **virtue/power** (德) of the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** (汤武).”\n**Sima Zhao** heard this and grew angry.\n**Qi Kang** was close friends with **Lü An** (吕安) of **Dongping** (东平),\nso **Zhong Hui** slandered them,\nsaying that **Lü An** and **Qi Kang** had great reputations\nyet their discussions were licentious,\nand they disturbed the times and corrupted teachings,\nmaking it appropriate to eliminate them.\nThus, **Lü An** and **Qi Kang** were executed.\nThis is cited as proof—\nindeed, the reckless forget restraint,\nand thus their states collapse and they perish without knowing it.\n\n*The Yanyi* cites the *Southern History*—[*Song Dynasty Records* §] (宋纪):\n**Xie Lingyun** (谢灵运), of **Yangxia** (阳夏) in **Chen Prefecture** (陈郡),\nwas the son of **Xie Ying** (谢瑛), the **Secretary of the Imperial Library** (秘书郎).\nHe was appointed **Prefect of Yongjia** (永嘉太守).\nThe prefecture had famed mountains and waters,\nwhich **Xie Lingyun** had always loved.\nSince he could not fulfill his ambitions as prefect,\nhe indulged in unrestrained wanderings,\nvisiting every county,\noften staying beyond the prescribed terms.\nHe no longer cared for governing or hearing cases.\nWherever he went, he composed poems to express his thoughts.\nAfter one year in Yongjia,\nhe feigned illness and resigned his post,\nthen moved to **Kuiji** (会稽),\nrestoring his old estates,\nadjoining mountains and rivers,\nand enjoying the finest secluded residences.\nHe consorted with the recluse **Wang Hongzhi** (王弘之),\n**Zha Chun** (扎淳之), and others,\nindulging in licentious pleasures,\nwith the intention of ending his days there.\nFrom **Shi Ning** (始宁) in the **Southern Mountains** (南山),\nhe began clearing paths and cutting trees,\nuntil he reached **Linhai** (临海), with hundreds following him.\nThe **Prefect of Linhai** (临海太守), **Wang Zhu** (王珠),\nwas alarmed and thought them bandits.\n\n*The Yanyi* says:\nThe **Xie** (谢) family, since the **Jin Dynasty** (晋),\nhas passed down the **Dao of elegance** (雅道).\n**Xie Jing** (景恒) and **Xie Jingren** (景仁)\nwere renowned for their **virtue/power** (德) and substance (素).\n**Xie Jingmao** (景懋) and **Xie Jingxian** (景先)\nwere praised for their integrity (节) and elegance (美).\n**Xie Fang** (方明) upheld the standards of conduct (行已之度),\nand **Xie Xuanhui** (玄晖) excelled in literary brilliance (藻续之奇).\nEach dominated their time,\nand they can truly be called a **house of virtue** (德门).\n**Xie Lingyun**’s talent and fame were unparalleled in the **Jiangzuo** (江左) region,\nyet he alone grew reckless without restraint,\nleading to his own downfall.\nPeople have their own strengths,\nbut this is indeed the truth—\nalas, what a pity.\n\n*The Yanyi* cites *The Chapter on the One from Ancient Times* (昔之得一章, third ninth):\nThose who obtained **the One** (一) in ancient times—\n**Heaven** (天) obtained **the One** and was clear.\n**Earth** (地) obtained **the One** and was tranquil.\n**The Spirit** (神) obtained **the One** and was responsive.\n**The Valley** (谷) obtained **the One** and was full.\nAll things obtained **the One** and thus were born.\nThe feudal lords and kings obtained **the One**,\nand thus became the **rightful rulers of the world** (天下正).\n\n*The Yanyi* further expounds:\nIt cites the original scripture:\n*The Dao* generates **the One** (一). For things, **the One** is their **vital essence** (精).\n**Primordial Qi** (元气) is the child of *The Dao*.\n**Primordial Qi** is the **subtle and harmonious essence** (冲和之妙气).\nIt becomes the foundation of **Yin and Yang** (阴阳),\nthe mother of all things,\nunchanging from ancient to modern,\nendless from beginning to end.\nHow vast is **the One** (一)!\n\n**The One** is **Primordial Qi** (元气).\nIt can manifest as **Yin** (阴) and **Yang** (阳),\nyet does not belong to **Yin and Yang**,\nascending to the **Jade Capital and Golden Gates** (玉京金阙)\nwithout becoming pure.\nDwelling in **clay tiles, thatch, and coarse mats** (瓦甓茅薜),\nit does not become impure.\n**The Heavenly Primordial** (乾元) relies on it for its beginning,\n**The Earthly Primordial** (坤元) relies on it for its growth.\nWhen **the Sovereign** (制御) acts with purpose,\nthen **the True Ruler** (真宰) emerges.\n\n*The Yanyi* further expounds:\nIt refers to **the True Sovereign** (真君) as the one who governs the form,\nand **the True Ruler** (真宰) as the one who governs the body.\n*The Yanyi* cites the *Zhuangzi*—[*Qiwu Lun* §] (齐物论):\nWithout that, there is no self.\nWithout self, there is nothing to take.\nYet it is close at hand,\nand one does not use it to act.\nIf there is a **True Ruler** (真宰),\nyet one cannot discern its traces (朕),\nthen all would have ministers and servants.\nTheir ministers and servants would be insufficient to govern them.\nThey would alternately become rulers and ministers.\nYet there is a **True Sovereign** (真君) who truly exists.\nWhether one finds its essence or not,\nit neither benefits nor harms its true nature.\n\n*The Yanyi* further expounds:\nThe five ranks of feudal lords—\n**Kings** (侯王) are the **highest rank** (五等之爵).\nThe **King** (王) is the **Sovereign of the Four Seas** (四海之尊).\nThe **Marquis** (侯) is the second rank among the five.\nIndeed, the five ranks were established,\nwith **Duke** (公), **Marquis** (侯), **Earl** (伯), **Viscount** (子), and **Baron** (男),\nto assist the **King** (王者).\n\nThe **King** (王) is the **Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Chariots** (万乘之君).\n**Sovereign** (君) refers to the **King** (王),\nthe **Son of Heaven** (天子).\nThe **Son of Heaven** holds the **sealed lands of a hundred thousand households** (提封百万赋),\nand **sixty-four thousand wells** (六十四万井).\nHe issues **a hundred thousand warhorses** (戎马百万匹),\nand **ten thousand chariots of war** (兵车万乘),\nthus he is called the **Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots** (万乘之主).\n\n「Thus, the **feudal lords** (侯王) can **permanently hold the Mandate of Heaven** (永有天下), with none failing to submit (无思不服).\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"none failing to submit\"* (无思不服) appears in the *\"Mao Poems\"* (《毛诗_), specifically in the *\"Great Odes\"* (□大雅)—the *\"King Wen’s Resounding Virtue\"* (文王有声篇), where it states:\n*\"At Hao, King Wu established his capital and cleared the festering sores [of the land],\noffering rites from the west, from the east, from the south, from the north—\nnone failing to submit (无思不服).\"*\n　　*\"None failing to submit (无思不服), the august **Sovereign** (皇王) shines forth!\"*\n　　It speaks of **King Wu** establishing his domain at **Hao** (镐京).\n　　**Commentary:** *\"From\"* (自) means *\"by\"* or *\"through\"* (由), indicating that **King Wu** at **Hao** (镐京) performed the **clearing of festering sores** (辟痈) ritual, and all came from the four quarters to witness.\nAll were moved by **King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化), their hearts without fail submitting to him.\n\n　　It further states: *\"The august **Sovereign** shines forth!\"* (皇王烝哉).\n*\"August\"* (皇) means *\"great\"* (大), *\"shines forth\"* (烝) means *\"to rule\"* (君).\nThis refers to the **greatness of King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化大), allowing him to rule (君) throughout the ages.\n\n　　Now, this passage is cited to prove that when the **feudal lords** attain **Oneness** (一) and align with it (正), all **ten thousand states** (万国) rejoice and submit.\nThus, it is said: *\"The **feudal lords** who attain **Oneness** (侯王得一) set it as the standard for all under Heaven (以为天下正).\"*\n\n　　The consequences of failing to achieve this are dire:\nIf the **Way** (道) is not upheld, **Heaven** (天) will fear to remain clear (清), and may split asunder (裂).\nIf the **Way** is not aligned, the **Earth** (地) will fear to remain at peace (宁), and may erupt (发).\nIf the **Way** is not perfected, the **Spirit** (神) will fear to remain responsive (灵), and may grow dormant (歇).\nIf the **Way** is not sustained, the **valleys** (谷) will fear to remain full (盈), and may run dry (竭).\nIf the **Way** is not upheld, **all things** (万物) will fear to thrive (生), and may face extinction (灭).\nIf the **feudal lords** fail to attain **Oneness**, they may fear losing their exalted status (贵高), and their rule may falter (蹶).\n\n　　**Explication:** *\"The **Lingzhi** (《列子》) records that a man from **Qi State** (杞国) worried that Heaven and Earth would collapse and perish, leaving no place for his body to rest.\"*\n\n　　**Annotation from *Lingzhi’s* \"Heaven’s Bounties\" (□天瑞篇):**\n*\"In **Qi State** (杞国), there was a man. **King Tang of Yin** (殷汤) granted the **descendant of Xia** (夏后) the land of **Qi**, and the **Zhou** (周) later reaffirmed this grant.\nNow, it lies within **Chenliu County, Yongqiu** (陈留雍丘县), which is the territory of **Qi Prefecture** (杞州) today.\"*\n\n　　*(The **Explication** already contains this record, so it is not repeated here.)*\n\n　　Therefore, **exalted status** (贵) must be grounded in **humility** (贱), and **height** (高) must be rooted in **lowliness** (基).\nHence, the **feudal lords** (侯王) refer to themselves as *\"the lone one\"* (孤), *\"the few\"* (寡), or *\"not the grain\"* (不谷)—\nthis is their way of grounding themselves in humility (以贱为本), is it not?\nIndeed, it is not so.\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"the lone one\"* (孤) appears in the *\"Left Transmission\"* (《左传》):\n*\"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).\nThe **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德).\"*\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **seventh year of Duke Zhao** (昭公七年), the **King of Chu** (楚子) built the **Chengfang Terrace** (成章华之台) and wished to share it with the **feudal lords** (诸侯).\nTo uphold this tradition, he dared not let it fall into ruin (弗敢失陨坠), and so summoned the **ancestral spirits** (诸宗桃), saying:\n*\"My **ancestral Sovereign**, **King Gong** (恭王), stretched his neck and gazed northward,\nlonging for the **Sun and Moon** (日月) to fulfill his hopes (以冀).\nHe passed down his **Mandate** (序) and entrusted it (相授).\nTo this day, there have been four **Sovereigns** (王) of Chu (四王矣).\"*\nThese are **King Gong** (恭), **King Kang** (康), **King Jiao Ao** (郏敖), and **King Ling** (灵王).\n\n*\"Yet their blessings and grace (嘉惠) did not reach far,\nonly **Duke Xiang** (襄公) came to honor my funeral rites (临我丧).\"*\n*\"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).\nThe **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德).\"*\nThis refers to the **great mourning rites for King Kang** (康王大丧) being neglected, and **King Ling of Chu** (楚灵) lacking **trustworthiness** (信), thus his rule did not endure (不终).\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"the few\"* (寡人) follows the precedent set by earlier **Sovereigns** (先君) who deemed themselves *\"the few\"* (寡人) as **virtuous** (贤).\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **third year of Duke Yin** (隐公三年), **Duke Xuan of Song** (宋宣公) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established his younger brother **Duke Mu** (穆公) as ruler.\nWhen **Duke Mu** (穆公) fell ill, he summoned **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (大司马孔父) and entrusted him, saying:\n*\"My **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established **the few** (寡人) as ruler,\ndeeming **the few** (寡人) virtuous (为贤),\nand commanding him to oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).\nIf **the few** (寡人) were to abandon **virtue** (德) and refuse to yield (不让),\nand if **Yi** (与夷) were to succeed me (段后),\nthen when my **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) inquires of **Yi** (与夷),\nwhat words would he use to respond?\nI beg you, **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (子), to uphold this (奉之),\nand oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).\nEven if **the few** (寡人) were to die,\nhe would have no regrets (无悔焉).\"*\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"not the grain\"* (不谷) follows the precedent of **Duke Ling of Chu** (楚灵) condemning those who lack **perfected virtue** (成德).\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **eleventh year of Duke Cheng** (成公十一年), there was the **Orderfu Meeting** (令狐之会) between **Qin and Jin** (秦晋).\n**Duke Li of Jin** (晋侯) arrived first, but **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯) refused to cross the **River Fen** (河).\nThese were **Duke Li of Jin** (晋厉公) and **Qin’s Marquis Huan** (秦桓公).\n\n*\"Qin betrayed the Jin alliance (背晋盟),\nand **Duke Li of Jin** sent **Lu’s Minister** (吕相) to sever ties with Qin (绝秦).\"*\n**Lu’s Minister** (吕相) questioned **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯), saying:\n*\"The **people of Chu** (楚人) detest those who divide their **virtue** (德) into two or three (二三其德),\nand they have come to inform us:\n'Qin betrayed the **Orderfu Alliance** (令狐之盟),\nyet now comes to seek a new alliance from us (来求盟于我).\nWe proclaim to **Heaven’s Emperor** (皇天上帝), **Qin’s Three Dukes** (秦三公), and **Chu’s Three Kings** (楚三王):\nThough we have relations with Jin (余虽与晋出入),\nwe only seek our own advantage (余惟利是视).\n**Not the grain** (不谷) detests those who lack **perfected virtue** (无成德),\nand thus we declare this to warn against **disunity** (不一).'\"*\n\n---\n**The Tenth Scroll of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing* by Lingzhi* (《道德真经衍义手妙卷》) ends here.\n**The Eleventh Scroll of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing* by Lingzhi* (《道德真经衍义手钞卷》) concludes.**\n\nThe **Eleventh Scroll** of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing* by Lingzhi* (《道德真经衍义手钞卷》) continues:\n\n**Chapter Forty: \"The Dao/Way's Movement Through Reversal\" (反者道之动)**\n\nThe **Dao/Way's Movement Through Reversal**:\nThe *Lingzhi Explication of the *Yijing* (易复卦)* states: *\"The strong reverses; moving yet proceeding with gentleness, thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Abridgment of the *Yijing* (易经复卦众)* records: *\"The *Fuxi* hexagram: Reversal, success. The strong reverses; moving yet proceeding with gentleness, thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame.\"*\n\nWang Bi annotates: *\"Entering is reversal, exiting is the growth of the strong; hence there is no strain.\"* Strain is akin to illness, companions refer to yang; hence it is said, *\"Thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world.\"* This is from the *Zhouyi Xici* (周易系辞).\n\nThe *Yijing* (易) is without thought, without action. Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world—what can be more sincere than this? Who else could attain this?\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Gazing upward at Heaven, looking downward at Earth.\"* This is from the *Yijing Xici* (易系辞).\n\nWang Bi annotates: *\"Thus it can fully expound the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth: gazing upward to observe celestial omens, looking downward to examine terrestrial geography. Hence one knows the principles of darkness and light. It begins with the original and ends with the terminal, thus understanding the sayings of death and life.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Among the Five Phases, water reverses its flow, fully unified, and moves beneficially with the times.\"* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□黄帝篇).\n\nThe full meaning is already contained in the *Daodejing* (道经□内道冲章第四篇), so I shall not repeat the major points here. *\"Reversing its flow, fully unified\"* means that when water reverses, it aligns with the Dao/Way; when it is deep and still, it attains full unity. Laozi says: *\"When the heart is good, it is deep and vast, empty and still, not mingling with things. Though the waves and currents may vary, the nature of the depths remains unchanged, and when it moves, it does so in perfect timing.\"* Hence it is said: *\"Reversing its flow, fully unified, and moving beneficially with the times.\"*\n\n**The Dao/Way's Use Through Weakness (弱者道之用)**\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Pointing at me, you overcome me; stepping on me, you overcome me. Yet, as the wind travels, the boundless void can be said to be weak.\"* This is from the *Zhuangzi* (庄子□秋水篇).\n\nThe wind said: *\"When I move your spine and ribs, there is a likeness. Yet now I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea without any likeness—why is this?*\n*The wind replied: *\"Indeed. I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet when you point at me, I cannot bend your finger; when you step on me, I cannot bend your foot. This is the weakness of the small overcoming the small. I alone can uproot great trees and raise great houses, strike the vast expanse of the sea.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Release it to the east, and it flows east; release it to the west, and it flows west. Thus, water entrusted to the boundless void can be said to be weak.\"* This is from the *Mengzi* (孟子□告子章句上).\n\nGaozi said: *\"Human nature is like rushing water: released to the east, it flows east; released to the west, it flows west. Human nature’s lack of distinction between good and evil is like water’s lack of distinction between east and west.\"* Rush refers to the swirling and winding appearance of waves.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Liezi said: 'Form arises from the formless; thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?'\"* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□天瑞篇).\n\nLiezi said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage followed yin and yang to govern Heaven and Earth. The formless gives rise to form, thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?*\n*This refers to the greatest forms of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang are not divine consciousness, yet form arises from the formless—does Heaven and Earth possess divine consciousness and innate nature? If they do not, then from where does it arise?\"*\n*This hypothetical question serves to illustrate that all things have their origin in the formless.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: \"The Superior Person Hears the Dao/Way\" (上士闻道章)**\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao/Way and diligently practices it.\nThe middle person hears the Dao/Way and holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not exist.\nThe inferior person hears the Dao/Way and laughs at it.\nIf one does not laugh, it is not the Dao/Way.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this.\"* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□子罕第九).\n\nThe Master said: *\"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this.\"* Fan Shi annotated: *\"Yanzi heard the Master’s words and understood them with his mind, practicing them with his strength. In the midst of chaos or adversity, he never failed to follow them. Like all things receiving timely rain and nourishment, flourishing and growing, how could he grow weary? This is what the other disciples could not match.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"As in the *Lunyu* where one can speak to the superior and the inferior.\"* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□雍也第六).\n\nThe Master said: *\"Above the middle person, one can speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. Below the middle person, one cannot speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. This is because the quality of those below the middle person is such that if spoken to abruptly of things too lofty, not only can they not comprehend, but they will also presumptuously aspire to equal them, incurring the flaw of detachment from their own condition and ultimately remaining inferior.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Like Zi Xia, who upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world rejoiced in returning, yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way found joy in it.\"* This is from the *Shiji* (史记□礼书), where Zi Xia’s eminent disciple is recorded.\n\nIt is said: *\"Upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world, he rejoiced in returning; yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way, he found joy.\"* Both cases, his heart was conflicted and unable to decide itself, much less those below the middle person who are gradually steeped in losing the teachings and conforming to customs.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"The eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled.\"* This is from the *Zhuangzi*, in the dialogue between Daozi and Confucius.\n\nDaozi said: *\"Now I tell you: according to human desires, the eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled.\"*\n\n「A man’s lifespan may reach a hundred years at its best, eighty in the middle, and sixty at its worst. Yet even when excluding the days lost to sickness, emaciation, death, mourning, sorrow, and calamity, one may open their mouth in laughter no more than four or five times within a month.\n\nHeaven and Earth are boundless, yet the eight deaths are limited in time. Wielding finite tools within the infinite expanse, one’s life passes swiftly—like a galloping *qí* (骐) and *jì* (骥) racing through a narrow gap. This is akin to the *zhāngfú* (章甫) hat being deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè* (越).\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"You’re So Uplifted\"* (逍遥游) chapter: *\"A man of Sòng (宋) sold his *zhāngfú* hat as merchandise.\"* The *zhāngfú* was the ceremonial hat of *Zōu* (邹) and *Lǔ* (鲁). The people of *Yuè* (越), however, had the custom of cutting their hair and tattooing their bodies, prizing neither hats nor headgear. Thus, it was said that the *zhāngfú* was deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè*.\n\nThis is also like *Hé Pú* (和璞) being abandoned by the state of *Chǔ* (楚).\n\nFrom the text: *Hé Pú* (和璞), whose given name was *Hé* (和) and surname *Biàn* (卞), was a man of *Chǔ* (楚). He dwelled beneath the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains, which lie in *Chǔ*’s territory and yield fine jade. *Biàn Hé* (卞和) found a jade *pú* (璞) and presented it to the *Chǔ* king. The king flew into a rage and had his left foot amputated. When the *Chǔ* king died and *Wǔ* (武) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) presented the jade again. *Wǔ* the king said: *\"You deceived my predecessor, and now I have had your right foot amputated.\"* *Hé* (和) embraced the jade and wept at the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains. When *Wǔ* the king died and *Chéng* (成) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) once more sought to present the jade. *Chéng* the king ordered his ministers to carve it, and indeed it proved to be fine jade. Its value was beyond estimation.\n\nThis is also like saying: *\"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*: *\"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way.\"* This passage appears in *\"Qīu Shuǐ\"* (秋水), where it states: *\"The fish of the Northern Sea cannot be spoken to about the ocean, for it is confined by the shallows. The summer insects cannot be spoken to about ice, for they are bound to their season. A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way, for he is enslaved by doctrine.\"* This implies that lesser scholars do not grasp the subtleties of the Dao/Way, and that to make them laugh is insufficient to reveal its true nature.\n\nThere are sayings to this effect: *\"The Way of the Sage is like a valley, the great clarity like shame, the boundless virtue like insufficiency, the established virtue like theft, the pure truth like deception.\"* This is also like *Confucius* saying: *\"I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭).\"* From the *\"Lunyu\"* (论语) chapter *\"Shùér\"* (述而), it states: *\"The Master said: I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭).\"* The note explains: *\"Transmitting (述) means passing on what is old; innovating (作) means creating new beginnings.\"* Thus, only the Sage can innovate, while the virtuous may transmit. *\"Modestly compare\"* (窃比) is a respectful phrase, *\"I\"* (我) is a term of affection. *Péng* (彭) was a great minister of the *Shāng* (商) dynasty, as recorded in *\"Dàzǎi Lǐ\"* (大载礼). He was one who trusted in antiquity and transmitted its wisdom.\n\nThis is also like saying: *\"A good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Shǐjì\"* (史记) *\"Lìe Zhuàn\"* (列传): During the reign of *Yōu* (幽) King of *Zhōu* (周), *Confucius* visited the *Zhōu* capital. He served the elderly *Lǎozǐ* (老子) with great reverence and asked him about rites. *Lǎozǐ* (老子) replied: *\"The person you speak of, his flesh and bones, have all decayed. Only his words remain in your ears. Moreover, a gentleman rides when the times are favorable, and walks with a staff when they are not. I have heard that a good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your ostentatious demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I tell you is this: rid yourself of such traits.\"*\n\nThis is also like *Zhuangzi* saying: *\"Action only when necessity compels.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Kèyì\"* (刻意) chapter: *\"Thus, the Sage’s birth is the unfolding of Heaven’s will, and his death is Heaven’s course. At rest, he aligns with the stillness of *yin* (阴) and harmonizes with its virtue; in motion, he surfs the waves of *yáng* (阳) and rides its flow. He does not precede things, nor does he initiate calamity. He responds only when moved, and acts only when necessity compels.\"* This is also like the *Hànyīn* (汉阴) old man, who *\"stood alone, bearing the True as his sole responsibility, and kept apart from the world’s conventions.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Tiāndì\"* (天地) chapter: *Zǐgōng* (子贡) traveled south to *Chǔ* (楚), then returned to *Jìn* (晋). Passing through *Hànyīn* (汉阴), he saw an old man diligently preparing a garden plot, dividing fifty *mǔ* (亩) into *qí* (畦). The old man dug a well, entered it with a bucket, and emerged to pour water, his movements clumsy yet laborious. *Zǐgōng* (子贡) said: *\"There is a device here—a *gāo* (槔) lever—that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring far less effort while achieving far more.\"* The gardener raised his head to look at him and said: *\"How so?\"* *Zǐgōng* (子贡) explained: *\"Carve a wooden lever, with the rear weighted and the front light. Draw water like pulling a string, and release it in measured surges—this is called a *gāo* (槔).\"* The gardener flushed with anger and laughed: *\"I have heard from my teacher: whoever uses a device will inevitably engage in contrivance, and whoever engages in contrivance will inevitably harbor a contriving heart. A contriving heart, once lodged in the chest, leaves no room for pristine whiteness. When pristine whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s emergence is unstable. An unstable spirit cannot be borne by the Dao/Way. I am not unaware, but I choose it out of shame.\"*\n\n*Zǐgōng* (子贡) was abashed and bowed his head, offering no further reply.\n\nThis is also like *\"Harmonizing with things, blending one’s light.\"* From the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Gēngsāng Chǔ\"* (庚桑楚) chapter: *\"He moves without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does—this is how he follows things and rides their flow, the very essence of nurturing life.\"* This means that things flow as they are, and the Sage blends into their currents, his light harmonized and his traces obscured. In this, the Perfect Man has no heart, merging with the *Xuándào* (玄道, Mysterious Way).\n\nThe greatest square has no corners, the greatest vessel takes time to complete, the greatest sound is faint, the greatest form is shapeless. This is also like the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) and *húliè* (瑚琏).\n\nFrom the text: The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) are great tripods. The *\"Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn\"* (黄帝内传) states: *\"The Yellow Emperor explored the copper of *Shǒu* (首) Mountain and cast tripods at *Jīng* (荆) Mountain, which is today’s *Láochéng* (湖城) to the south. These were called the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of *Jīng* (荆) Mountain.\"*\n\n「The *Húliè* (瑚琏) is referenced in *Lǔyǔ* (《鲁语》□公冶长篇). Zǐgòng (子贡) asked: *\"How might I compare, Master?\"* The Master replied: *\"You are a vessel.\"* He asked: *\"What vessel?\"* The Master said: *\"The *Húliè* (瑚琏).\"* The text records: *\"The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of the *Rǔ* (鲁) were made of millet and wheat; the *Xià* (夏) called them *Hú* (瑚), the *Shāng* (商) called them *Liè* (琏), the *Zhōu* (周) called them *Fǔguì* (簠簋). All were sacred vessels for ancestral temples, valued for their nobility.\"* Thus it is said: *\"The greatest vessel takes time to complete.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) said: *\"True beauty lies in enduring duration.\"* Referencing *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□人间世篇), *Yègōng Zǐgāo* (叶公子高), about to be dispatched to *Qí* (齐), consulted *Zhòngní* (仲尼). Zhòngní instructed him accordingly. Hence the saying: *\"Do not hasten the completion, nor urge it to fruition—excess only harms.\"* To hasten completion is perilous, yet true beauty lies in enduring duration; what is forced to completion cannot be altered for the worse—should one not fear this?\n\n**Chapter 42: *Dàoshēngyī* (道生一)**\nThe Dao/Way gives rise to One (一), One gives rise to Two (二), Two gives rise to Three (三), Three gives rise to myriad things (万物).\nExpounding further: *\"In undifferentiated unity, the One *Qì* (氤氲) does not yet scatter.\"* This undifferentiated unity is the One (一). The One (一) is the *Tàijí* (太极). Referencing *Lièzǐ* (《列子》□天瑞篇), Zǐ Lièzǐ (子列子) said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage followed the interplay of yin and yang to govern the heavens and earth. For what has form arises from what is formless—how then did the heavens and earth come into being?\"* Hence it is said: *\"There is the *Tàiyì* (太易), the *Tàichū* (太初), the *Tàishǐ* (太始), and the *Tàisù* (太素).\"* The *Tàiyì* (太易) is the state before *Qì* (氣) manifests; the *Tàichū* (太初) is the origin of *Qì*; the *Tàishǐ* (太始) is the origin of form; the *Tàisù* (太素) is the origin of substance. When *Qì*, form, and substance are present yet not yet differentiated, it is called *Húnlún* (浑沦). *Húnlún* means that myriad things are undifferentiated yet not yet separated. It is unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to, untraceable when followed—thus it is called *Yì* (易). *Yì* has no fixed form; it transforms into One (一), One into Seven (七), Seven into Nine (九). Nine transformations (九变) signify completion (究). Then it transforms again into One (一). One (一) is the beginning of form’s transformation (形变之始). The light and pure *Qì* ascends to become the heavens, the heavy and turbid descends to become the earth, and the harmonious *Qì* coalesces as humanity. Thus it is said: *\"The heavens and earth contain the essence, and myriad things are born through transformation.\"* Expounding further: *\"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (氤氲) give rise to myriad things through transformation.\"*\n\nReferencing *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* (《周易系辞》): *\"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) embrace, and myriad things are refined through transformation (化醇).\"* When male and female intermingle their essences, myriad things are born through transformation (化生). *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) signifies mutual attachment; it speaks of the heavens and earth without intention, naturally attaining unity. Only when the two *Qì* (二气) embrace in *Yīnyūn* (絪缊), harmoniously converging, do myriad things respond and transform into refined essences (精醇). All things bear yin and embrace yang, their harmonious *Qì* (冲气) as their mediator.\n\nExpounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□田子方) states: *\"The utmost yang blazes with radiance, the utmost yin is solemn and grave. This solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance arises from the earth.\"* The utmost yin is solemn and grave, the utmost yang blazes with radiance; this solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance from the earth. This solemnity is yin-*Qì* (阴气), this radiance is yang-*Qì* (阳气)—it speaks of their harmonious balance (交泰). When the two *Qì* (二) intermingle and achieve harmony, then things are born.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Perfect Man empties his spiritual chamber, and pure white *Qì* converges.\"* Referencing: *\"The heart is the abode of the spirit and soul.\"* Hence it is said: *\"The spiritual chamber is an empty space, where pure white *Qì* arises.\"* Expounding further: *\"The virtuous man does not perturb his heart, and thus his *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* may be nurtured.\"* Referencing *Mèngzǐ* (《孟子》□公孙丑章句上), *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) said: *\"At forty, I do not perturb my heart.\"* Forty is the age when a strong and capable man’s Dao/Way is clear, his virtue/power established. *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子) also said: *\"At forty, one is free from confusion\"*—meaning the same as *Mèngzǐ*’s *\"not perturbing the heart.\"*\"* *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *\"Master, how do you excel?\"* He replied: *\"I know speech, and I excel at nurturing my *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*.\"* This was *Gōngsūn Qiú* (公孙丑) asking *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) why his *\"not perturbing the heart\"* differed from *Tàozǐ* (告子). *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* is what one gains by not perturbing the heart. *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *\"What is this *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*?\"* He replied: *\"It is difficult to speak of.\"* As *Qì*, it is vast and resolute; if one nourishes it uprightly without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth. What men abhor are solitude, poverty, and lack of grain—yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Thus, things may sometimes be diminished to gain greater benefit, or increased to greater detriment.\n\nExpounding further: *\"Solitude, poverty, and lack of grain\"* are omens of misfortune. Referencing *Zuǒzhuàn* (《左传》) and *Chūnqiū* (《春秋》)—already recorded in the earlier chapter on *\"Obtaining the One\"* (得一), and thus not repeated here.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility.\"* Referencing *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ Tuǎncí* (《周易谦卦彖辞》): *\"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility; the Dao/Way of earth transforms excess into flowing humility; spirits and gods harm excess and favor humility; human nature abhors excess and loves humility. Humility is exalted and luminous, lowly yet uncrossable—this is the end of the virtuous man.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"Lowly to preserve oneself.\"* Referencing the *Yáo cí* (爻辞) of *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ* (《周易谦卦》), *Chūliù* (初六): *\"Humility, humility—the virtuous man. Crossing great rivers, auspicious.\"* The *Xiàng cí* (象辞) says: *\"Humility, humility—the virtuous man, lowly to preserve himself.\"* This means that the humbly virtuous man always nurtures his fortune through humility.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The gluttonous and greedy seek wealth and nobility.\"* Referencing: *\"The *Tāotiè* (饕餮) were the unworthy sons of *Zǐyún Shì* (缙云氏).\"* The gluttonous (餮) and the greedy (饕) are those who covet wealth and profit to attain riches and nobility—yet do they not know the Sage’s words: *\"To be unrighteous yet rich and noble is to me like floating clouds\"*?\n\nExpounding further: *\"The *Shū* (《书》) says: *\"Fullness invites loss.\"*\"* Referencing *Shàngshū* (《尚书》□大禹谟), *Yǔ* (禹) was praised: *\"Only through virtue does one move heaven, reaching even the distant—excess invites loss, humility invites benefit. This is the Dao/Way of time.\"*\n\n「Expounding further: *\"The mighty Qin perished through its despotism.\"* Referencing *Guǎng Sàng Yì* (《广圣义》), it says: *\"In ancient times, Qin devoured the seven kingdoms, unified the nine regions, its strength was mighty and its armies invincible. Yet in the end, it crumbled like earth and shattered like pottery, not even lasting a generation. Fú Sū (扶苏) died at the Great Wall, and Yīng (子婴) surrendered at Zhì Dào (轵道), reigning for but forty-six days before Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) arrived to behead him—its lineage extinguished, its state annihilated. From this, is it not clear that despotism brings ruin?\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Great Han flourished through harmony and benevolence.\"* Referencing: *\"The Han High Ancestor, Liú Bāng (刘邦) of Pēngchéng (彭城) and Fēngpèi (丰沛), promoted the worthy and employed the capable, waged a fierce battle with Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) to seize the realm. His virtue subdued mighty Chu (楚), his benevolence extended to all living beings. Wise strategists plotted for him, and virtuous advisors turned their talents toward him, allowing him to achieve imperial success through the Three Heroes (三杰)—his conquests were sealed by their counsel. With the Three Chapters (三章), he eased the weariness of the people: In the eleventh month of the second year of his reign, the Stripe Prince (沛公) summoned all the elders and leaders of the counties, saying: 'Elders, you have suffered under Qin’s harsh laws for so long. I have made a pact with the feudal lords: whoever enters the Central Plains first shall be king. I shall be king of the Central Plains, and with you, I shall enact only Three Chapters of law. Those who kill shall die, those who wound or steal shall be punished accordingly—all other Qin laws shall be abolished. Let all officials and citizens rest in peace as before.' Thus, the people found security under his rule.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, Yì (羿) excelled in archery, and Jié (奡) was skilled in rowing—yet none met a good end.\"* Referencing: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, yet did not meet a good end.\"* This is from *Lúnyǔ* (《论语》□《公冶长第五》). The Master said: *\"When the Dao/Way cannot be practiced, one may board a raft and float upon the sea.\"* Those who follow me, it is Zǐ Lù (子路) and me. Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced. The Master said: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路), his love of valor surpasses mine, yet he lacks the means to wield it properly.\"* Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced, assuming the Master’s words were a compliment, unaware of their true intent. The Master praised his valor yet criticized his inability to measure actions with righteousness. Yì (羿), the skilled archer, was the ruler of the State of Yǒuqióng (有穷氏), whose strength lay in his archery. Jié (奡), the boat rower, relied on his physical prowess—able to navigate vessels on land, as previously recorded in the thirty-third chapter, and thus not repeated here. These three men all depended on their valor and strength to triumph over others, yet none met a good end—all failed to grasp the virtue of gentleness and yielding. Therefore, the ancient Master warns through this example.\"*\n\nThe *Zhēn Jīng* (《道德真经》) annotated handwritten notes conclude here, Volume the Eleventh.\n\n**Volume the Twelfth of *Zhēn Jīng* Annotated Handwritten Notes**\n*Collected by Master Wáng Shǒuzhèng, the Recluse of Wǔfēng Qīng’ān*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Supreme Gentleness of the World**\n\nThe supreme gentleness in the world\nOvercomes the supreme firmness in the world.\n\n**Annotated Commentary:**\n*\"The flowing and surging of water.\"*\n\n**Handwritten Note:**\nThe flowing and surging of water—from *Lìezǐ*’s *\"Huángdì Pān\"* (黄帝篇), where Pán Jū notes the distinctions between backwash and forward flow, already recorded in *Dàodé Jīng*, Chapter Four: *\"The Way’s Pervasiveness.\"* No repetition here.\n\n**Without form, it enters the formless.**\n**Annotated Commentary:**\n*\"Piercing metal, penetrating stone.\"*\n\n**Handwritten Note:**\nQuoted from *Lìezǐ*’s *\"Zhōu Mùwáng Pān\"* (周穆王篇):\nIn the time of King Mù of Zhōu, a transformed being arrived from the Western Extremity.

Extending the meaning: **Gāoyáo** was mute yet served as the Grand Judge, and under his rule, no cruel punishments existed throughout the land. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.\n\n**Shī Guāng**, blind yet appointed as the Grand Steward, ensured **Jìn**’s governance remained uncorrupted. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern order.\n\nQuoting *Wénzǐ*’s *\"Spiritual Essence\"* (精神篇), it is said: **\"Lǎo Jūn** spoke: ‘The sun’s warmth in winter, the shade in summer—all things return to them without being summoned. They come when not invited, depart when not dismissed, vast and mysterious, their work accomplished without conscious effort. Yet men wait for the sun to illuminate their sight and for words to issue commands. In governance, such reliance is difficult indeed.\n\n**Gāoyáo**, though mute, administered the Grand Judiciary, and no cruel punishments existed under his rule. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *\"Explanations of the Master’s Arts\"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though his judgment may seem obscure, the laws and disputes were handled with fairness, so there is value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’\n\n**Shī Guāng**, though blind, governed with great order, ensuring **Jìn**’s realm had no chaotic rule. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *\"Explanations of the Master’s Arts\"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though he was blind, he brought great order, and **Jìn**’s realm was free from corruption—thus, there is value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** silent command, its unseen insight—this is how the **sage** serves as a teacher. The people are transformed by what they observe, not by his words alone.\n\nExtending the meaning, this passage is cited to prove the **teaching without words**, the **benefits of non-action**—though few can attain such harmony, it is no empty claim.\n\nExtending the meaning: Among the **Nine Schools** and **Hundred Masters**, few can truly grasp the **non-action** of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nQuoting: The **Nine Schools**—as recorded in the *Han Records*—are nine of the ten **schools of thought** worthy of observation.\n\nThe nine families are:\n1. **Confucianism** (儒家),\n2. **Daoism** (道家),\n3. **Yin-Yang** (阴阳家),\n4. **Legalism** (法家),\n5. **Logicians** (名家),\n6. **Mohism** (墨家),\n7. **Diplomatic Strategists** (纵横家),\n8. **Miscellaneous** (杂家),\n9. **Agrarianism** (农家).\n\nThe **Hundred Masters** of **military schools**—outside the **Six Classics**’s orthodox teachings—each composed their own works. From the **Zhōu** dynasty onward, they established doctrines and recorded texts, numbering over a hundred, all titled **\"Zǐ\"** (子).\n\n**\"Zǐ\"** (子) is the general term for **scholar** or **master**. Not daring to equal the **Six Classics**, they were all called **\"Zǐ\"**, writing **treatises**, **records**, and **books**, sometimes named after their **clans**, sometimes after their **era-specific titles**. Thus we have **Chángzǐ**, **Zēngzǐ**, **Yànzǐ**, **Mèngzǐ**, **Guānzǐ**, **Sūn Qíngzǐ**, **Lǔ Liánzǐ**, **Lièzǐ**, **Zhuāngzǐ**, **Gēngsāngzǐ**, **Wángsūnzǐ**, **Yín Wénzǐ**, **Gōngsūn Nízǐ**, *Lǚshì Chūnqiū* (吕氏春秋), **Dèng Xīzǐ**, **Guǐgǔzǐ**, **Lù Jiā**, **Cháo Cuò**, **Jiǎ Yì**, **Huán Tán**, **Cuī Zǐ**, **Zhōushēng Liè**, **Wèi Lǎng**, **Rén Huì**, **Kāi Xuán**, **Sū Yàn**, **Fú Xuán**, **Táng Bàng**, **Qín Jīng**, **Ruǎn Wǔ**, **Shāng Jūn**, **Lù Yún**, **Biànzǐ**, **Fú Lǎng**, **Sūn Wǔ**, **Shì Shèngzhī**—these are the ones.\n\nSome adopted **alternate titles**, such as:\n**Zǐsīzǐ** (子思子), *Tàigōng Jīnkuì* (太公金匮), **Huáinánzǐ** (淮南子), *Yán Tiě Lùn* (盐铁论), *Shuōyuàn* (说苑), *Xīn Xù* (新序), *Lùnhéng* (论衡), *Qiánfú Lùn* (潜夫论), *Fēngsú Tōng* (风俗通), **Wénzǐ** (文子), **Shēn Jiàn** (申鉴), *Chángyán* (昌言), *Diǎnlùn* (典论), *Dǔlùn* (笃论), *Zhōnglùn* (中论), *Wànjī Lùn* (万机论), *Zhōngjīng* (忠经), *Yìlín* (意林), *Dàoyán Lù* (道言录), *Shíjì Jì* (岁时记), *Qíjiù Jì* (耆旧记), *Fǎxùn Wǔjiào* (法训五教), *Shūruò Diǎn yǔ* (刍荛典语), *Mòjì* (默记), *Zhèngshū* (正书), *Zhènglùn* (正论), *Wùlùn* (物论), **Hánzǐ** (韩子), *Rénwù Zhì* (人物志), *Chéngbài Zhì* (成败志), *Tōnglùn* (通论), *Zhèngbù Zhì* (正部志), *Wéitōng Yǔ* (纬通语), *Guóyǔ* (国语), *Yuè Juéshū* (越绝书), *Bàopǔzǐ* (抱朴子), *Shìyào Xīnlùn* (世要新论), *Xīyán Yōuqiú* (析言幽求), *Chánglèzǐ* (长乐子), *Jiāyǔ* (家语), *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经), *Fāngyán* (方言), *Fǎyán* (法言), *Zhìlín* (志林), *Sōushén Jì* (搜神记), *Bówù Zhì* (博物志), *Yìxùn* (义训), *Shānhǎi Jīng* (山海经), *Shuǐjīng* (水经), *Dàyuāng Jì* (大荒记), *Shízōu Jì* (十洲记), *Shíyí Lù* (拾遗录), *Běncǎo* (本草), *Xiàngniú Jīng* (相牛经), *Xiàngmǎ Jīng* (相马经), *Xiànghè Jīng* (相鹤经), *Zhōubì* (周髀), *Zhúpǔ* (竹谱), *Sūnzǐ Bīngfǎ* (孙子兵法), *Sīmǎ Bīngfǎ* (司马兵法), *Sūnzǐ Suànjīng* (孙子算经), *Huángshí Gōngjì* (黄石公记), *Xiàngbèi Jīng* (相贝经), and *Wànbì Shù* (万毕术)—these are the ones.\n\nSome delve into **Daoist** profundities, others into **Confucian** rites and scriptures, some adhere to **music, calendrics, and astronomy**, others follow **Yin-Yang** symbols and **divinatory classics**, some constrain themselves by **logical methods**, others by **strategic expedience**. Each exhausts their own strengths, presenting their views in turn. Yet their doctrines vary—now strict, now lenient, now active, now passive—each confined to one corner, few able to **unify and penetrate** all things. To measure them against the **non-action** of the **Dao/Way**, few can attain its heights.\n\nOnly the **ruler who embodies the Dao/Way**, the **sovereign of supreme virtue/power**, whose mind harbors no concerns, whose spirit no thoughts—whose movements are formless, whose stillness boundless—who aligns with the **Dao/Way** and is vast in harmony, can follow in the footsteps of **primordial purity** (玄元).\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: \"Names and Reality\"**\nWhat is closer: **names** and **reality**?\nWhat is more abundant: **reality** and **wealth**?\nWhat is more harmful: **gain** and **loss**?\n\nExtending the meaning: **Reality** is the host, while **names** are the guest. **Names** are the guest of **reality**. To abandon the host for the guest is called **inversion**.\n\nQuoting *Lièzǐ*’s *\"Yáng Zhū\"* (杨朱篇): **Yáng Zhū** taught in **Lǔ**, lodging at **Mèng**’s house.\n**Mèng**’s family asked: *\"Enough with the self—why seek after **names**?\"*\nHe replied: *\"**Names** bring **wealth**.\"*\n*\"Once wealthy, why persist?\"*\n*\"To attain **nobility**.\"*\n*\"Once noble, why continue?\"*\n*\"To secure **death**.\"*\n*\"Once dead, why bother?\"*\n*\"For one’s **descendants**.\"*\n*\"What benefit do **names** bring to descendants?\"*\n*\"**Names** are the means to burden one’s own **body**, to exhaust one’s **heart**. Those who ride upon **names** shower blessings upon their **clans**, favoring their **kinfolk** and benefiting the entire **neighborhood**. What more for descendants?\"*\n\nExtending the meaning: Like **Bào Jiāo** and **Zǐ Tuī**’s kin, they are those who **cling to names** at the expense of **reality**.」\n\n「Excerpt: **Bào Jiāo**—as recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Thieves Zhí\" chapter**—was a man whose conduct defied the world. He died by embracing a tree. His given name was Jiāo, of the Bào clan, a recluse of the Zhou era. His conduct was pure and unyielding: he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance, neither serving the Son of Heaven nor associating with feudal lords. When **Zǐ Gòng** passed by, he said, *\"I have heard that one does not tread upon lands whose governance is unjust, nor accept benefits from a disgraced lord. Yet you walk this land and consume its bounty—how can this be just?\"* Bào Jiāo replied, *\"I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but despises retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly die.\"* Thus, he stood and embraced the tree until he withered away.\n\n**Jiè Zǐ Tuī** was one of unparalleled loyalty. He cut his own thigh to feed **Wén Gōng**, but when Wén Gōng later betrayed him, Jiè Zǐ Tuī, enraged, fled and burned to death while embracing a tree. In his youth, **Jìn Wén Gōng** (Zhòng ěr) faced persecution from his stepmother **Lì Jī**, whose son, **Yí Jiù**, sought to supplant him. Lì Jī slandered Zhòng ěr to **Xiàn Gōng**, who believed her, forcing Zhòng ěr into exile. Starving along the road, Jiè Zǐ Tuī cut his own thigh to feed him. Later, when Zhòng ěr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers—all but Jiè Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed *The Dragon-Snake Song*, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. Wén Gōng, repentant, pursued him to **Jiè Shān** (also called **Mián Shān**), but Jiè Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge. The king set the mountain ablaze, hoping to drive him out, but Jiè Zǐ Tuī made no attempt to escape. Instead, he embraced a tree and burned to death.\n\nThus, these two exemplify those who cling to **names** while burdening **reality**.\n\n**Extended Meaning:** The wealthy toil endlessly to enrich themselves, the noble exhaust themselves in ceaseless scheming. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"The Ultimate in Joy\" chapter**:\n*\"What the world reveres are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine silks, beauty, and music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are unease of the body, lack of delicacies, absence of fine garments, deprivation of beauty, and silence of music. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. How foolish the body is! The wealthy exhaust themselves in labor, hoarding wealth they cannot fully enjoy—their bodies are thus enslaved by externals. The noble toil night and day, fretting over right and wrong—their bodies are thus estranged. Man is born with care, and the long-lived merely delay death through marriage and wisdom. What suffering is this! Their bodies are thus alienated.\n\nBy this reasoning, the wealthy and noble—greedy for **names**, enslaved by **gain**—bear lifelong burdens and know no moment of true joy. This serves as proof for the argument: *Which is greater, the body’s toll or the cost of wealth?*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** The scholar’s sacrifice is for **names**; the greedy man’s for **gain**. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**:\n*\"Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties, none under heaven have failed to trade their nature for material things. The petty man sacrifices his body for profit, the scholar for **names**, the noble for his clan, and the sage for the world. Thus, though their pursuits differ and their **names** and **reality** diverge, all harm their nature by sacrificing their bodies—one end, the same result.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Bó Yí** died beneath the **Shǒuyáng** slope. (The full account is detailed in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**, and thus is omitted here.)\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Zhí Zhí** died for **gain** upon **Dōng Líng**’s heights. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**): Zhí Zhí, a younger kinsman of **Liǔ Xià Huì**, bore the name Zhí, commanding nine thousand soldiers as a notorious bandit. **Dōng Líng** was the name of a mountain—also called **Tài Shān**—located within Jì Zhōu, fifteen *lǐ* from **Dōng Píng**. There, Zhí Zhí met his end.\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Méng Zhòng** refused the楚相’s offer, preferring instead to be a **yèwěi** (dragging-tail) tortoise. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Autumn Water\" chapter**): **Zhuāngzǐ** fished in the **Pú** River, while **Chǔ Wēi Wáng** sent two officials to invite him, saying, *\"We would honor you with our entire realm.\"* Zhuāngzǐ, holding his fishing rod, paid them no mind, replying, *\"I have heard that楚 has a sacred tortoise, dead these three thousand years. The king wraps it in silk and enshrines it in his ancestral temple. Would it not prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud, over death, honored as a relic?\"* The two officials answered, *\"It would prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud.\"* Zhuāngzǐ said, *\"Then go—I too shall drag my tail in the mud.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Tiān Shī** declined the post of **Dàfū**, instead wishing to study the **Way of Xuān Yuán**. (As recorded in *Zhāng Shì Jiā Zhuán*): **Tiān Shī**, surnamed Zhāng with the given name Dào Líng and courtesy name **Fú Hàn**, was the sixth-generation descendant of **Xiù Hóu**. Naturally reticent and fond of antiquity, he mastered the classics and histories, as well as the studies of stars, constellations, and *tú wéi* (divinatory texts). He relieved the urgent needs of others without regard to kinship, his reputation spreading through court and commoner alike. When **Hàn Cháng Dì** issued an edict summoning him as **Jiànyì Dàfū**, he declined.*\n\n**Translation:**\n\n「Sighing, he said to his disciples: *\"Human lifespan lasts but a hundred years—an instant in time! Even parents, wives, and children, though most beloved, cannot be kept forever. And if my own body is not yet perfected, how could I ever possess the noble wealth beyond it? I have heard that in the ancient age, Xuān Yuán and Qiáo Sōng attained the Dao, ascending to the heavens and wandering in the boundless. They are my teachers. I shall abandon the world, sever all ties, and study their Way. I now bid farewell to you all.\"*\n\nThereupon, his disciples wept and departed, but only **Wáng Cháng** begged to follow. The **Tiān Shī**, pitying his resolve, and after attending to his own affairs, entered **Qián Héng** and reached **Sōng Yáng**, where he taught the *Huángdì Jiǔ Dǐng Dān Jīng* to the **Shén Rén**. Later, he sought **Xīchéng Shān**, built an altar to worship the **Zhēn**, and refined the **Jiǔ Dān**.\n\nIn the ninth month on the ninth day of the **Yǒngshòu** era’s second year, the **Tàishàng** sent a **Yún Yú** (cloud carriage) to welcome him at the **Yúntái Fēng** Peak. In broad daylight, he ascended to the heavens, at the age of **one hundred and twenty-three**.\n\nDuring the **Tiānbǎo** era’s seventh year, he was posthumously honored as **Tiān Shī**. In the **Mén Hé** era’s fourth year of the **Lí Zōng** reign, he was again honored as the **Sān Qīng Fújiào Dàfǎshī** (Grand Master of the Dao who upholds the Teachings). The **Sòng** court conferred upon him the titles **Sān Tiān Fǔyuán Dàfǎshī** (Grand Master of the Three Heavens who aids the Origin) and **Jìng Yìng Zhēnjūn** (Resplendent and Responsive True Lord).\n\n**Extended Meaning:** As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*: **Yuán Xiàn** dwelled in a **huán dǔ** (circular, thatched) hut in **Lǔ**. It states in the *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"□ Ràng Wáng\" (Possibly \"□ Let to King\" or \"□ Ràng Wáng Píàn\" if referring to the *Ràng Wáng* chapter): **Yuán Xiàn**, a disciple of **Kǒngzǐ**, was surnamed **Yuán**, named **Sī**, and had the courtesy name **Xiàn**. **Zǐ Gòng**, another disciple of **Kǒngzǐ**, was named **Zì**, skilled in speech, and fond of luxury and splendor. The text fully preserves his account, without repetition.*\n\n「Extended Meaning states: As recorded in *The Northern History (Běi Shǐ)*: The **Empress Dowager of the Northern Wei (Wèi Míng Tàihòu)** visited the **Glass Cave (Jiǎn Zàng)**.\n\nTranscription from *The Northern History*: The Empress Dowager of the Northern Wei made a state visit to the Glass Cave.\n\n---\n**Handwritten Notes on the Extended Meaning of the *Dao De Jing* (Moral Teachings of the Way and Its Virtue) – Volume XII concludes.

Resplendent were his institutions.

The golden tones are the beginning of order, and the jade resonances are its completion. The beginning of order refers to the threads of wisdom, like the strands of music. This is the work of intelligence. The completion of order is the work of sainthood. That Confucius did not claim sainthood is as stated in **[Possibly \"Chapter on Gōngsūn Chǒu\" (Gōngsūn Chǒu Zhāngjù Shàng)]**:\n\nGōngsūn Chǒu asked: *\"Then the Master was indeed a sage?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"How can you say such a thing?*\n*Once, Zǐ Gòng asked me: ‘Are you a sage?’*\n*I said: ‘Sainthood is beyond me. I only learn without satiety and teach without weariness.’*\n*Zǐ Gòng said: ‘To learn without satiety is wisdom. To teach without weariness is benevolence.

As **Shìshī** (a judicial officer), he was exiled—*Shìshī* being a position overseeing legal matters. *\"Out\"* here means *\"banished.\"*\n\n「Once banished twice, someone said to him: *\"You cannot yet leave.\"* He replied: *\"If one serves others with uprightness, where would one not be banished three times? If one serves others with crookedness, why must one leave one’s parents’ domain?\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning states:** *Carving and shaping myriad forms, yet not claiming skill.*\nTranscription: *The greatest skill, as Zhuangzi said, is to \"cover and load the heavens and earth, carve and shape myriad forms, yet not claim skill.\" Would one who makes mulberry-leaf paper claim skill?*\n**Extended Meaning states:** *As in Ziqing’s carving of wood into a vessel.*\n*Ziqing was the Grand Carpenter of Lu.

These texts comprised fifteen families and one hundred thirteen chapters.*\n\n**Extended Meaning states:** *Thus, the Master said, \"I wish to speak not at all.\"*\nTranscription: *What speech does Heaven make?

What speech does Heaven make?*\nFrom the *Yánghuò* (Yang Huo) chapter of *The Analects*:\nThe Master said: *\"I wish to speak not at all.\"*\nZigong said: *\"If you do not speak, how shall we, your disciples, have anything to transmit?\"*\nThe Master said: *\"What speech does Heaven make?

The finest hemp cloth was called *zì*, the coarser *xì*. He would first put on his inner garment, then the outer layer of *zì* and *xì*.\n\nFrom *Chapter on \"Tianxia You Dao\"* (The World in Harmony), Forty-Sixth:\n*No guilt is greater than covetousness,\nNo calamity is greater than insatiability,\nNo blame is greater than the desire to seize.*\n\n**Extended Meaning states:** *The calamity of greed and recklessness.*\n\nFrom the *Lower Appendices* of the *Yì* (Book of Changes):\n*\"Goodness not accumulated is insufficient to establish a name,\nEvil not accumulated is insufficient to destroy one’s life.\nThe petty man considers minor goodness as useless and does not practice it,\nAnd considers minor evil as harmless and does not abandon it.\nThus, evil accumulates and becomes irrepressible,\nGuilt grows great and becomes unforgivable.*\nThe *Yì* says: *Greed and recklessness bring ruin.*\n\n**Extended Meaning states:** *Like the case of the Qí man who snatched gold—\nHe who sees gold but not the man is truly

moon,\nin sequence with the Four Seasons,\nin fortune with the spirits and gods.\nActing before Heaven, Heaven does not oppose;\nacting after Heaven, one follows Heaven’s timing.\n*This means: when one acts before Heaven’s timing,*\n*Heaven’s Dao responds in harmony and does not resist.*\n*When one acts after Heaven’s timing,*\n*one submits in reverence to Heaven’s Dao and dares not defy it.*\nThus, if a ruler can be so,\nhe need not peer through windows or gaze afar—\nHeaven’s Dao becomes clear of itself.\nTherefore, the Sage acts without exertion yet knows,\nsees without looking yet

styled Wén Bǎo,\nalways shut his door and read. When he slept, he tied a string to his head\nand hung it from the rafters. Later, he became a great scholar.\nThe Emperor summoned him, but he did not respond.\n\nThe one who pricks his thigh: *The Records of the Grand Historian* says,\nSū Qín was a man of Luòyáng in the Eastern Zhōu.\nHe studied under Master Guǐgu, wandering for several years,\nthen returned in great distress. His brothers, sisters-in-law,\nwives, and concubines all mocked him.\nQín heard this and felt ashamed, so he closed himself in his room.\nHe obtained *The Stratagems of Tàigōng*, lay down and read it,\nand when he wanted to sleep, he pulled a thorn to prick his thigh,\nso that blood flowed down to his heel. Later, he counselled Zhào,\nand Zhào heeded him. Thus, he wore the seals of the Six Kingdoms’ ministers,\nand roamed the world with his schemes.\n\nThe one who studies by candlelight: In the past, Sun Kāng,\nbeing poor, struggled to learn without money to buy oil.\nHe often studied by the light of snow. Later, he became Grand Scribe.\n\nThe one who gathers fireflies: Sòng Chē Yìn, styled Wǔzǐ,\nalso suffered poverty and devoted himself to learning.\nAt night, he used a crimson silk bag to gather dozens of fireflies,\nand read by their light. His relentless pursuit of learning\nthus led him to become a great scholar as well.\n\nNow, those who seek learning,\nall begin by daily studying to grasp the Dao,\ncultivating skill to mend their faults,\nand end by awakening to truth and forgetting words,\ndiscarding skill and letting go of attachment—\nusing perception and hearing as the gradual stages of cultivation,\nand diminishing skillful actions as the gateway to enlightenment in the Dao.\nThese few men here,\nhave lifelong worries but no single day’s joy,\nlaboring their minds and exhausting their spirits,\ndrowning themselves in vast learning—\nthen they must inevitably reach their end.\n\nExtended meaning states:\nOnly by humbling one’s ambition and striving for timely diligence\ndoes true cultivation arise.\nQuoted from *The Book of Documents* [□] *Saying of Mìng* [below]:\n*\"Only by humbling one’s ambition and striving for timely diligence\ndoes true cultivation arise.\nWith sincere devotion to this, the Dao accumulates within oneself.\"*\n\nThis means:\nTo humble one’s ambition is as if unable to do so,\nTo diligently study is as if unable to keep up—\nReceiving others with emptiness,\nExerting oneself with earnestness—\nThen one’s cultivation will flow like a spring,\nuninterrupted and abundant in its coming.\n\nExtended meaning states:\nTo drown oneself in vast learning,\nTo use culture to extinguish one’s innate nature.\nQuoted from *Zhuāngzǐ* [□] *The Chapter on Refining One’s Nature*:\n*\"Knowledge without depth,\nSeeking to establish the world,\nThen adorn it with culture,\nAnd enrich it with vast learning.\nCulture extinguishes the innate nature,\nVast learning drowns the mind.\nOne does not know that the innate nature is the foundation of culture.\nCulture’s brilliance hides within simplicity,\nThe innate nature’s depth endures in the mind.\nVast learning obscures the mind’s essence—\nOnly by abandoning learning and letting go of culture\nCan one attain the beauty of effortless action.\"*\n\nExtended meaning states:\nThus, the *Yì* [□] *Benefit* [hexagram] is great.\nThe *Xìang* [□] says: *\"Wind and thunder, Benefit.*\nThe gentleman, seeing good, moves toward it,\nHaving faults, corrects them.\"\n\nQuoted:\nThe words of the *Benefit* [hexagram] say,\n*\"Wind must precede thunder,\nThunder must follow wind,\nThen all things will be benefited.*\nThus it is said: *Wind and thunder, Benefit.*\nTo move means to migrate and emulate,\nTo correct means to amend and restrain.\nMoving toward good and correcting faults—\nNo greater benefit exists.\"*\n\nExtended meaning states:\nThe greatness of *Diminishing* [□].\nThe *Xìang* [□] says: *\"Mountain and marsh, Diminishing.*\nThe gentleman uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire.\"\n\nQuoted:\nThe words of the *Diminishing* [hexagram] say,\n*\"Mountain beneath, marsh above—Diminishing.*\nThe gentleman uses this to restrain anger and suppress desire.\"\n\nAnnotation:\n*\"The desires of man are stirred by things,\nAnd the world’s circumstances bring joy or sorrow—\nThus, emotions have anger and craving.\nTo restrain means to still what has already arisen,\nTo suppress means to block what is yet to come.\nAnger and desire both have past and future—\nRestraining and suppressing are profound principles that complement each other.\"*\n\nTaking the world requires the Way of non-action.\nWhen one has affairs, it is not enough to take the world.\n\nExtended meaning states:\nQín conquered the Six Kingdoms.\nQuoted:\nQín Shǐhuáng’s name was Zhèng,\nThe son of Zhuāngxiāng Wáng.\nIn the twenty-sixth year of his reign,\nHe extinguished the Six Kingdoms,\nConquered the world,\nAnd proclaimed himself the First Emperor.\nThe Six Kingdoms—Yān, Qí, Chǔ, Wèi, Hàn, and Zhào—\nWere all annihilated in his time.\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* says:\n*\"Qín Shǐhuáng rose to greatness,\nAnd with one stroke of his policy, vanished without a trace.\"*\n\nExtended meaning states:\nHe abolished the *well-field system*,\nOpened the *intermediate fields*,\nRemoved the *straight roads*,\nBuilt the *A Fáng*,\nConstructed the *Great Wall*,\nAnd developed the *Five Ridges*.\n\nQuoted:\nThe *well-field system*: According to *The Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Gǔliáng Transmission*,\nIn ancient times, three hundred paces made a *lǐ*,\nCalled *well-field*.

The Perfect Man’s use of mind is like a mirror: neither grasping nor repelling, responding yet not hoarding. Thus, he overcomes all things without harm.\"*\n\n**Extended Commentary:** In ancient times, **Qín Mù Gōng** once lost his thousand-*lǐ* steed.\n\n**Handwritten Notes:** This is the text from *The Spring and Autumn Annals*; it is already recorded in the *Extended Commentary* and need not be repeated.\n\n*\"I believe those who trust me, and I also believe those who do not.\"*\n\n**Extended Commentary:** In ancient times, a man presented a live fish to **Zǐ Chǎn**.\n\n**Handwritten Notes** (*Mèngzǐ – \"Wàn Zhāng Shàng\" Section*): The text is already detailed in the *Extended Commentary* and need not be repeated again.\n\n「Yet further, he spoke of the tranquil and contented manner of aligning with one’s **Dao/Way** and **qi/vital energy**, this being the text from *The Analects – \"Xiāng Páng\"* Section. Its general meaning is that the tranquil and sincere demeanor of one who embodies **virtue/power** appears as though he cannot speak, yet it is the humble and yielding posture of one who does not presume his wisdom over others.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: \"Life and Death\"**\nLife and death, entering and exiting.\n\n**Extended Commentary:** Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. The handwritten notes from *The Zhouyi* (I Ching) state: \"Hence, he knows the **Dao/Way** of encompassing all things.\" Gazing upward to study the celestial patterns, looking downward to examine the earthly structures, thus one knows the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest. Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. This speaks of using the **Dao/Way** of *The Zhouyi* in upward contemplation and downward observation, thereby knowing the unseen yet profound (幽) and the seen yet apparent (明), the principles and their applications.\n\nObserving the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. It means that by applying the principles of *The Zhouyi* to trace the initial stages and the final outcomes of all things, one comprehends the auspicious and inauspicious fate of their beginnings and endings, thereby knowing the doctrine of life and death.\n\nOf those who live, ten in every thirteen are reckless; of those who die, ten in every thirteen are reckless. In the course of human life, ten in every thirteen meet their death through reckless actions.\n\n**Extended Commentary:** This refers to the use of the nine orifices and four limbs, or the three activities and ten evils.\nThe handwritten notes from **Hán Fēi** state: \"Ten in every thirteen refers to the nine orifices and four limbs.\" That is, the two ears, two eyes, two nostrils (considered as two orifices), along with the mouth and the two lower orifices, totaling nine orifices. The two hands and two feet are termed the four limbs. **Hé Shàng Gōng** also agrees with this interpretation.\n\nAnother interpretation cites the three activities and ten evils. The three activities refer to **body, speech, and mind**. The ten evils are:\n1. Killing living beings,\n2. Theft and robbery,\n3. Lewdness and licentiousness,\n4. Treason and rebellion against superiors,\n5. Defaming and slandering sacred scriptures and laws,\n6. Cursing and blaspheming in darkness,\n7. Secret plotting, resentment, and jealousy,\n8. Slanderous speech and causing discord,\n9. Breaking vows and violating precepts,\n10. Touching or defiling altars and sacred grounds.\n\n**Sūn Dēng’s** explanation states: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those of the living kind, few abide by the **Dao/Way**, while many defy it. Hence, of those who live recklessly, three in every ten conform to the **Dao/Way**. Those who live not in accordance with the **Dao/Way** and die not in accordance with reason are few, while those who defy them are many. Thus, of those who die, three in every ten submit to their fate.\n\nThe *Broad Explication of the Sacred* states: One who does not take joy in life yet remains content with it is among those who live recklessly. If one does not let desires and greed disrupt his mind while alive, nor let excessive nourishment harm his nature, but remains at ease with simplicity and humility, aligns with the natural flow of **qi/vital energy**, maintains the tranquility of his spirit, and steadies his mind—then, without seeking to prolong life, life itself will be extended. Without striving to advance in the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** will progress naturally. This is the teaching of **Dù Tiānshī**.\n\nIn my humble view, those who preserve life in such a manner are not merely three in every ten. Even among a thousand or ten thousand, there may be none or only one or two. Thus, by this reasoning, are they not few indeed?\n\nThe *Yanyì* states: **\"To dwell in harmony with the times and align with the natural order.\"** It cites the text from the *Zhuangzi*’s **\"Great Master\"** chapter:\n\n*\"To gain is to follow the times; to lose is to conform. He who dwells in harmony with the times and aligns with the natural order is impervious to sorrow and joy. This is what the ancients called **‘suspended detachment’**—detachment without bonds or attachments. Why so? Because his vital essence is profound and unexhausted.\"*\n\nThe *Yanyì* elaborates: *\"Excessive pursuit of life-nourishing substances, when taken to excess, leads to death.\"* It cites the *Zhuangzi*’s **\"Mastering Life\"** chapter:\n\n*\"The first requirement for nurturing the form is moderation. There are cases where nourishment abounds, yet the body remains unnourished. Truly, those skilled in preserving life traverse land without fear of rhinoceros or tiger, enter battlefields unarmored by weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn, the tiger no place to extend its claws, and weapons no opening to pierce—why? Because they dwell in **‘non-death’**.\"*\n\nThe *Yanyì* further explains: *\"Zhuangzi said: ‘If one empties oneself to wander through the world, who could harm them?’\"* It cites the *Zhuangzi*’s **\"Mountain Trees\"** chapter:\n\n*\"Two square boats drifted side by side upon the river. A hollow vessel came to collide with them—though the passage was narrow and constricted, no anger arose, for the vessel was empty. A man of such a mind, if another stood upon him, would call out, ‘Expand and contract!’ If the first call went unheard, the second unheard, then a third—he would not respond with harshness. Earlier, he was not angry yet now he is; earlier, he was empty yet now he is full. If one empties themselves to wander through the world, who could harm them?\"*\n\nThe *Yanyì* concludes: *\"As in the Daoist transmission of Liu Gang.\"* It notes: *\"This is recorded in the *List of Immortals*, with its meaning already fully elaborated. This is Chapter Fifty-One of *Dao Sheng*.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to it, virtue/power nurtures it, things shape it, and circumstances complete it.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Thus, the naked cannot but be naked, and those with scales, shells, fur, or feathers cannot but have scales, shells, fur, or feathers.\"*\n\nRecorded in *The Analects of Confucius*, Chapter Twenty-Four of *The Five Emperors*: These are the words of Confucius in response to Zigong.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Indeed, I once heard from Laozi that it was as you say. Thus, those born of firm earth are sturdy, those of weak earth are yielding, those of crumbling earth are vast, those of sandy earth are refined, those of damp earth are beautiful, and those of exhausted earth are ugly. Those who eat water excel in swimming and endure cold, those who eat earth are without desire and do not tire—*they do not breathe*—those who eat wood are strong but unrefined—*their vital essence is ungoverned*—those who eat grass are swift but foolish, those who eat mulberry leaves have silken threads like silkworms, those who eat meat are courageous and defensive, those who eat qi are spiritually enlightened and long-lived, those who eat grains are wise and clear-sighted, and those who eat nothing do not die but become divine.\"*\n\n*The Huainanzi* states: *\"Though strong yet not violent, this too is the appearance of the unrefined.\"*\n\nThus it is said: *\"Among feathered creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the phoenix is their sovereign. Among furred creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the qilin is their sovereign. Among shelled creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the tortoise is their sovereign. Among creatures with hidden forms, there are three hundred and sixty, and humanity is their sovereign.\"* This is the beauty of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThough their forms and kinds differ, the sovereign must act in accordance with the Dao/Way when moving and must rest in accordance with the Dao/Way, ever following nature without harming what is born. This is called *ren* and longevity.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"As for the young, the strong, and the old—death is inevitable.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Liezi* (missing character in *\"Heavenly Blessing\"* chapter): The Yellow Emperor said: *\"When the spirit enters its gate and the bones return to their roots, what remains of me?\"*\n\nFrom birth to death, the Great Transformation has four stages: infancy, youth and vigor, old age, and death. In infancy, the qi is concentrated and the will is singular—harmony at its peak. Nothing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and vigor, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts surge—things assail it, and virtue declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body nears rest—nothing precedes it. Though it does not reach the fullness of infancy, it is already distant from youth and vigor. In death, it returns to stillness, reaching its extreme.\n\nThus, all things revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"This is what Zhuangzi called the True Sovereign.\"* It also cites Zhuangzi’s *\"True Steward\"*:\n\n*\"One does not know what it is that commands, yet if there is a True Sovereign, it is only that its traces and succession are not grasped—how could it be otherwise than sovereign and minister?\"* A True Sovereign indeed exists.\n\nThe Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"As in the case of the five ranks of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.\"*\n\nRecorded: The Zhou established five ranks of nobility—duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. The ancient kings’ laws also had five grades: sovereign, nobles, ministers and great officers, scholars, and commoners—including the sovereign himself.\n\nIn the world, the ruler governs not because he lacks talent or tools. When he selects and employs them, he then confers titles and honors, bestowing nobility and prestige. Yet this nobility and prestige have their limits. The Dao/Way gives birth to things and is revered by them. Virtue/power nurtures all things and is honored by them. Endlessly generating without cessation, the function of giving birth is eternally revered. Endlessly completing without exhaustion, the function of perfecting is eternally honored. How could there be any limit?\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Mencius said: There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Mencius*, *\"Telling Zigong of Proper Conduct\"* (Upper): *\"There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity. Ren, yi, zhong, and xin—joy in goodness without weariness—this is the noble title of Heaven. Dukes, ministers, and great officers—this is the noble title of humanity. The noble title of Heaven is earned through virtue/power, and the noble title of humanity is earned through emolument. The ancients cultivated their noble title of Heaven, and the noble title of humanity followed. Today’s people cultivate their noble title of Heaven to seek the noble title of humanity. Once they obtain the noble title of humanity, they abandon their noble title of Heaven—this is the greatest confusion, and it will surely lead to ruin.\"*\n\nNow Mencius takes *ren*, *yi*, *zhong*, and *xin* as the noble title of Heaven. How much more so the Dao/Way and virtue/power, which surpass *ren* and *yi*! Thus it is said: *\"The Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so.\"*\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Zhuangzi fishing in the Pu River.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Zhuangzi*, *\"Autumn Water\"* chapter: Pu is the name of a river, belonging to Dong Commandery—today’s Pu County in Puyang. The King of Chu (Chu King Wei) knew Zhuangzi was a sage of great insight, so he sent envoys to offer him the position of minister, first testing his intentions. He wished to entrust the governance of his realm to a worthy, for state affairs were burdensome and he bore many worries. The meaning is already fully elaborated; there is no need to repeat it.\n\n*\"To act without possession, to labor without reliance, to grow without domination—this is called the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Retreating and hiding in secrecy—this is profound and distant.\"*\n\nRecorded in *The System of the Classic of Changes*: The Master said: *\"What is the *Yijing* for? It opens what is hidden and completes undertakings, encompassing the Dao/Way of all under Heaven. Such is its function. Thus, the sage uses it to harmonize the wills of all under Heaven, to establish the undertakings of all under Heaven, and to resolve the doubts of all under Heaven. Therefore, the virtue/power of the stalks is round and divine, the virtue/power of the trigrams is square and knowing, and the meanings of the six lines are easy yet profound. The sage uses this to purify the heart, retreating and hiding in secrecy, sharing in the joys and sorrows of the people. Divine insight knows the future, and knowledge preserves the past—who could rival this?\"*\n\nThe ancient were the wise and enlightened, the sagely and martial yet without killing.\n\nOriginally, when Confucius spoke of *retreat and concealment in secrecy* (退藏於密), he referred to the ancient wise and enlightened sages, who without exception followed the Dao/Way of the *Yijing*, harmonizing their virtue/power with the divine knowledge of the trigrams and lines, purifying their hearts, nurturing their virtue/power, and retiring in secrecy—yet never revealing their traces.\n\nIs this not the *profound virtue/power* (玄德)?\n\nUnder Heaven, there exists the *Beginning Chapter* (有始), the fifty-second chapter:\n\n*\"Block its *Yui* (兑), close its gates—then one’s entire life will not labor.\"*\n\nElaborated meaning: The six senses each have their own delight.\n\nRecorded: The six senses (六根)—as the Left Venerable Master of the *Taiji* (太极) Confession states—are the cause of the entanglement of life, birth, and suffering. They arise from the three actions (三业): the six senses are the eye-sense (眼根), ear-sense (耳根), nose-sense (鼻根), tongue-sense (舌根), body-sense (身根), and mind-sense (意根). All senses give rise to all actions (业), hence it is said: the six senses are like plants and trees, producing all flowers and fruits, perpetually generating one another.\n\nElaborated meaning: The Yellow Emperor inquired about *governing the body* (治身) of the Dao/Way from Guangchengzi.\n\nRecorded in *The Zhuangzi* (《庄子》□*On Nurturing the Perfect*—在宥篇): The meaning is already detailed in the *Recorded Sayings* (义中载之), and thus it is not repeated here.\n\nElaborated meaning: This is called *having the Joyous* (兑). When the Joyous is present and the heart (心) emerges, it engages with things (物). If one blocks the Joyous so that it does not flow, then the heart will not emerge.\n\nRecorded in *The Sayings on the Hexagrams* (《易说卦》): \"Joy is spoken of as *Joyous* (兑), which is the marsh. Nothing delights all things as much as the marsh does.\" Again, *Joyous* (兑) is likened to the eye, the gate, and the mouth, and thus it warns against their closure and the disasters that follow. If this gate of disaster is applied to a state, governance will falter; if practiced in the body, the Dao/Way will decline. If properly closed and sealed, then the body will be at ease and the state will be orderly. To open the Joyous and advance its affairs will never bring salvation in the end.\n\nElaborated meaning: Once the five desires’ gate is opened, the six dusts’ affairs are accomplished, and the mind and spirit grow weary within.\n\nRecorded in *The Zhuangzi*: The words of Zhiqi (盗跖) admonishing Confucius: \"Now I shall tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see colors, the ears desire to hear sounds, the nose desires to smell fragrances, the tongue desires to taste flavors, and the will desires fulfillment. These are the six dusts’ affairs.\"\n\nThis is the original language from the *Scripture of the Gathering of the Jade Emperor* (玉皇本《行集经》), Chapter One: At that time, the Jade Emperor issued a grand and wondrous sound, addressing all the celestial beings and holy assemblies of the Ten Directions: \"You must listen carefully. These guilty beings, across countless kalpas, though lacking in wisdom, have committed the ten evil deeds. The six dusts pervade their defilement, the three actions bind them tightly, and they indulge their hearts without restraint, never awakening. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions accumulate day by day, month by month.\n\nWhat are the six dusts? They are the dusts of the six senses—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.\n\nThese guilty beings, having long fallen into the sufferings of kalpas, indulged their dust-obscured nature, thus becoming thoroughly defiled by the six dusts and entangled by the three actions. These are all the types of transgressions.\n\nElaborated meaning: There was a man named Zhang Bao in the Song Dynasty.\n\nRecorded: Zhang Bao was a man from Chengdu. He admired the wife of the magistrate of Huayang County. He made me, the fifth chapter of the *Jie* (介) preface, stand out.\n\nIf I were to have knowledge, I would walk the Great Dao,\nYet only fear to act with benevolence.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** This is how *Niè Quē* questioned *Wáng Ní*:\n*\"Do you know what all things hold in common?\"*\nRecorded from the text of *Zhuāngzǐ’s* [\"齐物论\"] *On Equalizing Things*:\nNiè Quē was a disciple of Wáng Ní.\nWáng Ní replied: *\"How should I know?\"*\n*\"Do you know what you do not know?\"*\n*\"How should I know?\"*\n*\"Then do things have no knowing?\"*\n*\"How should I know?\"*\n*\"Well, let me try to speak of it.*\n*How do I know that what I call knowing is not ignorance?\"*\n\nThe Great Dao is most level, yet people love shortcuts.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** As with *Tán Tái Miè Míng*, who never took shortcuts.\nRecorded from the words of the *Lúnyǔ’s* [\"雍也\"] *Yōng Yě* (Sixth Chapter):\nZǐyóu, named Yǎn, styled Zǐyǔ, was a disciple of Confucius.\nHe served as magistrate of Wǔchéng, a lower city of Lǔ.\nThe Master said: *\"Have you found a worthy man there?\"*\nHe replied: *\"There is Tán Tái Miè Míng—he never takes shortcuts.\nUnless it is official business, he never enters my home.\nHis courtyard is always swept clean, his fields well tilled,\nAnd his granaries are always empty.\"*\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Such as the excesses of *Zhòu*—his palaces and pavilions,\nThe *Chu*’s *Chānghuá*, and *Qín*’s *Āfáng*—all are of this kind.\nRecorded:\n*\"Palaces and pavilions\"*—from the *Shūjīng’s* [\"泰誓上\"] *Tài Shì (Upper)*:\nKing Wǔ said: *\"Now King Zhòu of the Shāng,\nDoes not revere the Highest Heaven,\nBrings calamity upon the people,\nDrowns himself in wine and debauchery.\nHe indulges in licentiousness, corrupts women,\nCommits atrocities—punishing whole clans,\nCondemning officials by generations—\nHis palaces, pavilions, ponds, and extravagant attire\nExhaust the common folk.\nHe burns and roasts loyal ministers,\nDismembers pregnant women.\nThe August Heaven, enraged, commands my father, the Duke,\nTo solemnly enforce Heaven’s might—\nThe great vengeance has yet to be fulfilled.\"*\n\nAnd the *Chu*’s *Chānghuá*—from the *Chūnqiū*, *Zhāo Gōng* Year 7:\nThe Lord of Chu built the *Chānghuá* terrace,\nWishing to sacrifice the feudal lords upon it.\n*\"Fall\"* here means \"sacrifice.\"\nAs in *Hú Zēng’s* poetic history:\n*\"Endless withered grass buries Chānghuá,*\n*Laughing at King Líng’s past extravagance—\n*Before the platform’s earth dried, the music ceased,\n*Alas, his body lies in a commoner’s grave.\"*\n\nAnd *Qín*’s *Āfáng*—from poetic history:\n*\"Newly built Āfáng’s walls were yet un-dried,\nWhen Pèngyōng’s army already entered Cháng’ān.\nThe emperors drained the people’s strength for grand schemes—\nGreat undertakings crumble as sand, not hard to foresee.\"*\n\nThis speaks of rulers who neglect the roots,\nPursuing only splendor,\nNearly destroying the foundation—\nHow can this be a lasting Dao?\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Towering halls and carved walls.\nRecorded from the *Shàngshū’s* [\"五子之歌\"] *Wǔzǐ’s Song*.\n\n「The Five Sons were the younger brothers of Tàikāng.  When Tàikāng sat upon the throne in name only, indulging in ease and pleasure to extinguish his own virtue, they composed this song to admonish him.  It says:\n\n*\"The Way teaches thus:*\n*Within, he indulged in wanton excess,*\n*Without, he hunted beasts without restraint.*\n*Drunk on wine, lost in music,*\n*Towering halls and carved walls—*\n*One such act, and none shall escape ruin.\"*\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Fields and rice paddies left barren.\nThis is how the poets censured King Yōu.\nRecorded from the *Máo Shī*’s [\"小雅·楚茨\"] *Xiǎoyǎ·Chǔcú*, censuring King Yōu.\n\n*\"Excessive governance and heavy taxation,*\n*Fields and rice paddies left barren,*\n*Famine and pestilence descend,*\n*The people perish and flee.*\n*Sacrifices fail to nourish the spirits,*\n*Thus the virtuous ones ponder the ancient ways.*\n\n*Clad in fine embroidery,*\n*Wearing sharp blades,*\n*Disdaining ordinary food,*\n*Yet wealth overflows.*\n*This is called ‘robber’s ostentation’—*\n*How can it be the true Dao?\"*\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Clad in fine embroidery, like Emperor Yángdì of Sui, who clipped silk to make flower-like adornments for his dragon boat.\n\nRecorded: In the first year of Sui’s *Dàyì* era (605 CE), the fifth month, Emperor Yángdì constructed the Western Gardens, two hundred *lǐ* in circumference. Within it lay a man-made sea, ten *lǐ* or more in breadth. He built the Fāngzhàng, Pénglái, and Yíngzhōu mountains, each a hundred *zǐ* in height, with pavilions, towers, and palaces dotting their peaks. To the north of the sea, he dug a canal winding into its heart. Sixteen gateways of the Green Canal were all built along its banks, each presided over by a consort of the fourth rank. The gardens were lavish beyond measure. When the trees within the palace were trimmed, he would clip silk to fashion flower and leaf decorations, replacing them whenever the colors faded. Within the ponds, he similarly clipped silk to create lotus and water chestnut plants, exchanging them for new ones when their hues grew dull. The sixteen gateways vied with each other in offering exquisite delicacies, seeking favor through extravagant displays. The Emperor delighted in nightly excursions through the gardens with thousands of attendants, composing the *Qīngyè Yóu* (\"Clear Night Journey\") song to be performed on horseback. In the eighth month, the Emperor traveled to Jiāngdū. When he boarded the dragon boat there, it was four tiers high, forty-five *zǐ* in height, and two hundred *zǐ* long, with a main hall, inner hall, and court chamber on the topmost level. The middle two tiers housed a hundred and twenty rooms, all adorned with gold and jade. The lowest tier served as quarters for the eunuch attendants. The Empress rode in a floating pavilion, its design slightly smaller than the Emperor’s. There were also nine *Fújǐng* (\"Floating Scenes\") vessels, three tiers high, each a water palace. Thousands more boats carried the consorts, royal princes, officials, monks, nuns, Daoists, and foreign guests. Altogether, they employed over eighty thousand oarsmen, all dressed in brocade robes. A thousand more vessels bore the escorting guards, their prows and sterns linked in an unbroken line for two hundred *lǐ*. Cavalry patrolled the shores on either side. Every prefecture and county within five hundred *lǐ* was commanded to offer tribute—some sending as much as a hundred cartloads of the rarest aquatic and terrestrial delicacies. The palace women, sated with drink, would often discard the remainder of their meals in the dirt before departing.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** The Jin lord Hécāi made a purple silk windbreak forty *lǐ* long, while Shí Chóng made a brocade windbreak fifty *lǐ* long. Recorded from the *Jìn Shū*: Shí Chóng, styled Jìlún, was by nature extravagant. At that time, the Jin lord Hécāi had made a forty-*lǐ* purple silk windbreak, and Chóng, to surpass him in wealth, made a fifty-*lǐ* brocade windbreak. Later, when his concubine Lǜzhū was executed, he went to the Eastern Market and sighed, *\"These slaves profit from my wealth!\"* The executioners replied, *\"You knew wealth could bring harm—why not disperse it earlier?\"* Chóng had no answer.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** The Later Han official Mǎ Liáo submitted a memorial stating that in the capital, men favored wide sleeves. Recorded: In the first year of the *Jiànchū* era (76 CE) under Emperor Zhāng of Later Han, he issued an edict to correct customs and promote virtue, which must have its origin. The *Shū* says: *\"King Wú of the State of Wú loved swordsmen, and the people were many with wounds.\"* *\"King Fēn of the State of Zhāo delighted in slender waists, and many starved to death in the palace.\"* The people of Cháng’ān would say: *\"In the capital, men favor tall hairdos—so the four quarters raise their hair by a foot.\"* *\"In the capital, men favor broad eyebrows—so the four quarters pluck theirs to half their foreheads.\"* *\"In the capital, men favor wide sleeves—so the four quarters wear entire bolts of silk.\"* Though these words seem like jest, they reflect reality.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Wearing sharp blades, like King Wú of Wú, who commissioned the smith Gān Jiāng to forge swords. The swords came in two forms: one called *Gān Jiāng*, the other *Mòyē*. The earlier records mention the same.\n\nRecorded from the *Zhuāngzǐ* [\"说剑篇\"] *Shuō Jiàn* chapter: In ancient times, King Wén of Zhāo—also known as Zhāo Hùiwén Wáng—was the son of Zhāo Líng Wáng. He loved swords, and three thousand or more swordsmen gathered at his gates, day and night clashing before him, with hundreds dying or wounded. Yet he never tired of it. Thus for three years, until his realm declined and the feudal lords conspired against him.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** If Hé Zéng of the Jin dynasty ate ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, he would still claim there was no place to set his chopsticks. Recorded: During the reign of Jin Wǔdì, the Chancellor Hé Zéng, styled Yǐngkǎo, consumed ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, yet still complained there was no place to set his chopsticks. He would not eat steamed buns unless they were cut into ten pieces. At that time, the general Qín Xiù remarked, *\"Zéng’s arrogance and excess are beyond measure—he should be posthumously named with a shameful title.\"* A title that does not match the person’s deeds is called *miù* (谬), and one who flouts order and behaves wantonly is called *chǒu* (丑).\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** King Zhòu of the Shang dynasty hoarded the wealth of Lùtái and amassed the grain of Jiǔqiáo. Recorded: King Zhòu of the Shang accumulated wealth without dispersing it, filled his granaries without knowing contentment. The *Shàngshū* states: When King Wǔ of the Zhōu defeated the Shang, he declared, *\"Scatter the wealth of Lùtái and distribute the grain of Jiǔqiáo, bestow bounty upon all under heaven, and the myriad peoples will rejoice and submit.\"*»\n\nThe *Elaborated Meanings of the Daoist Classic* concludes here.\nThe *Daoist Classic’s Elaborated Meanings* continue in the fifteenth scroll.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: \"The Well-Established Shall Not Be Uprooted\"**\nFrom *The Collected Works of the Reclusive Gentleman Wáng Shǒuzhèng of Wǔfēng*\n\nThe well-established shall not be uprooted,\nThe well-embraced shall not be lost—\nThen descendants shall never cease their sacrifices.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:** First, establish the roots firmly, then cultivate the branches.\n\nQuoted from *The Zhuāngzi* [□ *Heaven and Earth*]:\nIn the age of supreme virtue,\nThere is no veneration of the worthy,\nNo employment of the capable.\nThe ruler is like a branch marking the way,\nThe people like wild deer.\nThis speaks of the ruler’s non-action above,\nAnd the people’s natural simplicity below—\nLike wild deer, they are free from royal rites.\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:** Those who embrace the people with the Dao\nShall have the hundred folk return and never depart.\n\nQuoted: The *Elaborated Meaning* takes those who embrace the people with the Dao—\nLike the Great King (Tàiwáng)—\nAs the very model of a Dao-bearing ruler.\nWhen he left Yín and they followed him as to market,\nThis is called the hundred folk returning and never departing.\nThus it is said: *The well-embraced shall not be lost.*\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:** Those who with the Dao embrace the Primordial and hold to Oneness\nShall have their spirit complete and never lost.\n\nQuoted: The *Zhuāngzi* [□ *On Nurturing Life*] says:\nGuāngchéngzǐ spoke: *\"Come, I shall tell you of the supreme Dao.\"*\nAnd again: *\"I hold to its Oneness and dwell in its harmony.\"*\nThus I have cultivated my body for twelve hundred years,\nYet my form has never decayed.\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice and knelt in homage, saying:\n*\"This is what we call Heaven!\"*\nThus the *Elaborated Meaning* cites those who with the Dao embrace the Primordial and hold to Oneness—\nTheir spirit is complete and never lost.\nGuāngchéngzǐ is the very model of one who with the Dao embraces the Primordial and holds to Oneness.\nTo cultivate the body for twelve hundred years without decay—\nThis is called the spirit complete and never lost.\nThus it is said: *The well-embraced shall not be lost.*\n\n**Elaborated Meaning:** When the Great King dwelt in Yín,\nThe Rú people invaded him.\nHe served them with hides, jade, and pearls,\nYet could not escape.\n\nQuoted from *The Mèngzǐ* [□ *Sentences on King Huì of Lǐ, Lower*]:\nTéng was a small state.\nIf it exhausted its strength to serve a great power,\nIt could not escape—how then could it?\nMèngzǐ replied:\n*\"In ancient times, the Great King dwelt in Yín.\nThe Rú people invaded him.\nHe served them with hides and jade—\nYet could not escape.\nHe served them with dogs and horses—\nYet could not escape.\nHe served them with pearls and jade—\nYet could not escape.\nThen he gathered his elders and told them:\n'What the Rú people desire is our land.\nI have heard: A gentleman does not use what nourishes others to harm them.\nMy lords, what fear is there of lacking a ruler?\nI shall depart.'\nHe left Yín, crossed the Liáng Mountains,\nAnd settled beneath Qí Mountain.\nThe people of Yín said:\n'A benevolent man—\nWe must not lose him!'\nThose who followed him came as to market.\"*\n\nThe span of the Zhou Dynasty’s reign extended through the ages of King Wén, King Wǔ, King Chéng, and King Kāng—all sovereigns who embraced the **Dao** and cultivated **virtue**. Thus, their descendants succeeded one another for thirty-seven generations, spanning eight hundred and sixty-seven years. Their enduring prosperity and unbroken sacrifices were such that even when later rulers desecrated ancestral temples, the **sacrificial rites** to **Hòujì**, King Wén, and the **sacrifices at the altar of heaven** (*jiāosì*) never ceased.\n\nThe *Yǎn Yì* states: *\"Even after the destruction of ancestral temples, the sacrifices to Hòujì, King Wén, and the **sacrifices at the altar of heaven** were never interrupted.\"*\n\nFrom the *Shǐjì* records: When Confucius was in Qí, he lodged in the outer guesthouse. Qí Jinggōng visited him. After the formal exchanges between host and guest concluded, an attendant reported: *\"A Zhou envoy has just arrived, saying that a calamity has befallen one of the ancestral temples of the former kings.\"* Jinggōng inquired: *\"Which king’s temple has been stricken?\"*\n\nConfucius replied: *\"This must be the temple of King Lǐ.\"*\n\nThe duke asked: *\"How do you know?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"The *Shī* says: ‘Majestic, O Heaven above, your commands are without error. Heaven rewards virtue with virtue.’ This is a lost poem. ‘Majestic’ (*huánghuáng*) means splendid. ‘Error’ (*tè*) means deviation. Calamity follows the same principle. King Lǐ abandoned the institutions of Kings Wén and Wǔ, introducing dark yellow and extravagant adornments, towering palaces, and lavish carriages and horses—none of which could be rectified. Thus, Heaven’s punishment rightly fell upon his temple. This divination aligns with the signs.\"*\n\nThe duke asked: *\"Why did Heaven punish his temple instead of his person?\"*\n\nConfucius replied: *\"It was for the sake of Kings Wén and Wǔ. If Heaven had punished his person, would not the descendants of Wén and Wǔ have been extinguished? Therefore, the calamity struck his temple to expose his transgressions.\"*\n\nSoon, an attendant reported: *\"The temple stricken was indeed that of King Lǐ.\"* Jinggōng rose in astonishment, bowed twice, and said: *\"Truly, the wisdom of the Sage surpasses others far beyond measure. If his teachings were followed throughout the world, his **virtue** would be universal.\"*\n\n「Elucidating its meaning, it states: *\"When kin and relatives are harmonious, and undertakings are well-ordered, **virtue** is cultivated.\"*\n\nQuoting *The Book of Documents [□Yáo Diǎn]*:\n*\"He [Yáo] selected and appointed men of outstanding **virtue**, thus bringing harmony to the nine clans.\"* The annotation reads: *\"This means Yáo could recognize and employ men of exceptional **virtue**, thereby fostering harmony among his high ancestors, descendants, and all collateral relations—together comprising the nine clans.\"*\n\nWith the nine clans in harmony, he governed the people with clarity, making them bright and well-ordered. He united all under Heaven in concord, and the common folk thrived in their changing times.\n\nZhang’s interpretation states: *\"Yáo cultivated **virtue** through selecting and appointing men of outstanding **virtue**—this was his way of perfecting himself. To bring harmony to the nine clans was his way of perfecting his family. To govern the people with clarity was his way of perfecting his state. To unite all under Heaven in concord was his way of perfecting the world. This is the proper sequence: first perfect oneself, then harmonize the family, then govern the state, and finally bring peace to the world.\"*\n\nElucidating its meaning further, it states: *\"The blessings of accumulated goodness extend to future generations.\"* Quoting *The Commentary on the Hexagrams of the Yijing [Kūn Guà Wén Yán]*:\n*\"A family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings.\nA family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering calamities.\"*\n\nWhen a subject slays his lord, or a son slays his father, such deeds are not the result of a single day or night. Their origins lie in gradual decline. From failing to discern **virtue** early, one may say: *\"Those who govern states and families can they not take warning?\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"All treasures flourish abundantly.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Gēngsāng Chú*]:\n\nThe Master said: *\"How do my disciples differ from me? When spring qi arises, all grasses sprout; when autumn arrives, all treasures mature.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"This is what is meant by using its remnants to govern people.\"* *\"This is what is meant by using its dregs to govern the state.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Ràng Wáng Piān*]:\n\n*\"The true Dao is used to cultivate the self. Its remnants are used to govern the state; its dregs are used to govern the world. Therefore, one observes the self to understand the self, the family to understand the family, the village to understand the village, the state to understand the state, and the world to understand the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"The Yijing says: 'Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.'\" It is a matter of reflecting inward and seeking within oneself.\"* Quoting the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five line:\n\n*\"Nine-five: Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.*\n*The Commentary says: 'Observe my life'—this means observing the people.*\n*Master Bào’s interpretation says: This nine-five line, with its gentle yet upright position, embodies the just and central. It embodies yielding compliance to cultivate virtue, and uses rectitude to govern the people, becoming the sovereign of great observation. Yet those below follow those above, like shadows responding to form; the people follow the ruler, like clay shaped by the potter’s wheel. If you show them evil, evil will take root; if you lead them with goodness, goodness will flourish. Transformation begins from the self, and its influence extends to the four seas. To examine one’s virtue, first observe the people. When the gentleman’s conduct is exemplary, there will be no blame.*\n\n*Thus, this line from the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five is cited to verify the meaning of 'How do I know the world is thus?'—speaking of the five methods of observation, and knowing the world through observing its people.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\n*\"The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not harm, and predatory birds do not snatch.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"If life’s blessings increase daily, the depth of virtue will diminish.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Dé Chóng Fú Piān*]:\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: *\"Is it true that humans have no emotions?\"*\nZhuangzi replied: *\"Yes.\"*\nHuizi said: *\"If humans have no emotions, why call them human?\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Dao gives them form, Heaven gives them shape—how could they not be called human?\"*\nHuizi said: *\"If they are called human, how can they lack emotions?\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"This is not what I call emotion. What I call 'no emotion' is that humans do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm themselves; they follow nature without excess.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Silent, as if having lost their mate.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Qí Wù Lùn*]:\n\nNánguò Zǐqí sat leaning against his elbow, gazing upward and sighing deeply, silent as if having lost his mate. This describes the perfected sage, silent as if having lost their mate—like an infant’s innocence, so nothing can harm them.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Their harmony is in perfect accord with all things; who could harm them?\"* Quoting *Liezi* [□ *Huángdì Piān*:\n\nZhào Xiāngzǐ led ten thousand soldiers on a hunt in the mountains, setting fires to drive game. The flames scorched a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a rocky crevice, moving with the smoke’s rise and fall. The soldiers took him for a ghost. After the fire passed, he emerged slowly, as if untouched. Xiāngzǐ was astonished and detained him. Upon close inspection, his form, color, and orifices were human; his breath, voice, and manner were human. Xiāngzǐ asked: *\"What way did you dwell in stone? What way did you pass through fire?\"*\nThe man replied: *\"What do you call 'stone'? What do you call 'fire'?\"*\nXiāngzǐ said: *\"What you emerged from was stone; what you passed through was fire.\"*\nThe man said: *\"I do not know.\"*\nWhen Wèi Wénhòu heard of this, he asked Zǐxià: *\"Who is this man?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"Based on what I’ve heard from the Master, those in perfect harmony are in perfect accord with all things. Nothing can harm them, so they can wander among metals and stones, tread upon water and fire—all is possible.\"*\nWénhòu said: *\"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"He has hollowed his heart and discarded wisdom—I cannot do it either. Still, I will speak of it when I have leisure.\"*\nWénhòu said: *\"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"The Master can do it but chooses not to.\"*\nWénhòu was greatly pleased.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Like in the Spring and Autumn Annals, where Dù Bǐ compared with the daughter of the Duke of Chu, and bore a son, Wén.\"* Quoting *Spring and Autumn* (Lí Gōng 21st year): The meaning is already recorded; no need for repetition.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Like in the *Shijing*, which says: 'When Houji was born to Jiāngléi, he was abandoned in a narrow lane, where cows and sheep trampled him. He was abandoned in a dense forest, where loggers felled trees. He was abandoned on the ice, where a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried.'\"* Quoting *Máo Shī* [*Dà Yá* • *Shēng Mín*]:\n\n*\"Revering the ancestral Houji, born to Jiāngléi, the achievements of Wén and Wǔ began with him. Thus, he was matched with Heaven. Abandoned in a narrow lane, cows and sheep trampled him. Abandoned in a dense forest, loggers felled trees. Abandoned on the ice, a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried. Though his bones were frail and his sinews soft, his grip was firm. Before knowing the union of male and female, his vigor was already strong—the peak of vital essence. He cried all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse—the peak of harmony.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Zhuangzi said: 'The true person’s breath originates from the heels; the common person’s breath originates from the throat.'\"*\nQuoting *Zhuangzi* [*Dà Zōngshī Piān*]:\n\n*\"The ancient true persons slept without dreaming, awoke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. This describes the inner breath. The true person’s breath originates from the heels—the root of the feet.

Lún Biān asked: 'Is the Sage still alive?' Huan Gōng said: 'He has already died.' Lún Biān said: 'Then what you read is merely the leavings and dregs of the ancients.' Huan Gōng said: 'My lord reads the books, how dare the wheelwright comment? If he has understanding, let him speak; if not, let him die.' Lún Biān said: 'I observe it through my own craft. When carving wheels, if I proceed too slowly, the wood becomes soft yet unyielding; if too swiftly, it becomes bitter yet does not penetrate. Neither too slow nor too swift, I attain it with my hands and resonate it in my mind—yet my mouth cannot speak it. There is a measure inherent within this process. I cannot teach my craft to my son, nor can my son receive it from me, hence at seventy years old I am still a wheelwright. The ancients’ true teachings could not be transmitted, so they died with them. Thus what you read is merely the leavings and dregs of the ancients.'*\n\n*Therefore, it cannot be grasped as near or distant, beneficial or harmful, honored or degraded—yet for this very reason, it is held in highest esteem by all under Heaven.*\n\n*The extended meaning states: *\"If* [Zǐ] *Lièzi lived in the Jìng gardens for forty years, yet no one recognized him.\"*\n\nQuoting from *Lièzi* [*Tiānrú Piān*]:\n\n*\"Zǐ Lièzi dwelled in the Jìng gardens for forty years, and no one knew him.

Lord does not comply with him,\nand the diviner declares his fate shall perish with the times.\nYou shall diligently serve me,\nexecuting the Heavenly punishment upon him.\"*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** section’s text states:\n\n*\"The scope of its meaning is: Even the petty theft of hooks may escalate to the grand scale of usurping a state—such as Tian Chengzi [田成子], who in a single day assassinated the Qi king [齐君] and stole his realm. What he stole was not merely the kingdom—he also took its sacred laws and virtuous governance. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief, yet enjoyed the security of Yao [尧] and Shun [舜]. Small states dared not oppose him, and great states dared not punish him; twelve generations held Qi’s sovereignty. The scope of its meaning is: Li Si [李斯] advised Er Shi [二世] to employ the **supervision and punishment** technique to suppress theft. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the second winter of Er Shi’s reign in the Qin [秦], the Second Emperor frequently rebuked Li Si, who held the Three Ducal positions [三公]. How could it be that theft persisted under such authority? Li Si, fearful and trembling, enriched his titles and ranks, unsure of his fate, and thus curried Er Shi’s favor, replying in writing: The sage ruler must be capable of employing the **supervision and punishment** technique. Hence, Shen Zi [申子] said: ‘He who holds the world yet does not indulge in wantonness, but instead treats the world as a shackle upon himself—there is no other reason than his inability to supervise and punish, while instead burdening himself with the labor of the people, like Yao and Yu [尧、禹]. Thus, he is called a shackle.’ If one cannot practice the clear techniques of Shen and Han [申、韩], nor follow the **Dao/Way of supervision and punishment**, but instead merely seeks to gratify himself with the world’s ease, while exhausting his own form and spirit to serve the people, then he is but a drudge for the common folk—not one who nurtures the world. What is there to honor in this? Therefore, the enlightened ruler employs the **supervision and punishment** technique to make absolute judgments from above, so that authority rests not in his ministers. Then he can extinguish the paths of benevolence and righteousness, sever the eloquence of persuasive speech, and halt the clamor of carts and horses. The Leftist School [左氏] was particularly adept at this. Yet, though his heart yearned for wantonness, none dared resist him. Thus, the ministers and people could not even offer timely warnings of errors—who would dare to plot change? Er Shi was pleased, and so the **supervision and punishment** grew ever stricter: those who taxed the people heavily were hailed as sagacious historians; those who killed many were called loyal ministers. Half of the travelers on the roads were under sentence, and corpses piled daily in the markets; the Qin people grew ever more terrified and prone to rebellion. The scope of its meaning is: Han Wudi [汉武帝] entrusted Zhang Tang [张汤] and Zhao Yu [赵禹] to codify the laws. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the fifth year of the *Jian Yuan* era [建元], the Emperor commissioned the Grand Master of Justice Zhang Tang and the Middle Master of Justice Zhao Yu to jointly revise the legal codes. The decree emphasized harsh interpretations and binding officials to their duties. Zhang Tang’s biography was recorded, and his method of ‘**foresightful legal scholars**’ [见知法史] was adopted, with officials mutually overseeing each other’s application of the law, growing ever stricter from this point onward. Zhao Yu’s biography was also recorded. Hence, the sages proclaimed: ‘I take no action, yet the people transform themselves. I involve myself in no affairs, yet the people grow rich. I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves. I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.’ The scope of its meaning is: Like Yao and Shun, who were silent and still in their governance, reclining in their halls while the people flourished. Quoted from the words of *Yangzi* [杨子] in *The Inquiry into the Dao/Way* [问道篇]: ‘In ancient times, Yu and Xia [虞、夏] inherited Yao’s title and followed Yao’s Dao/Way. The laws were clear, and the rites and music were established. They ruled with ease, their hands folded in their sleeves, and the people flourished. *Fu* [阜] means *rich* [富]. They reclined with folded sleeves upon the rocky veranda, observing the people’s natural prosperity.’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘**Wen** [文] and **Wu** [武] neither knew nor recognized [不识不知], yet they conformed to the Heavenly Emperor’s will. With folded sleeves and hands at rest, the world was governed.’ Quoted from the words in *The Mao Commentary* [毛诗] on *The Great Odes* [大雅], *The Sovereign’s Majesty* [皇矣篇]: ‘The Emperor spoke to King Wen: “I cherish the virtue/power of the people, neither raising my voice nor showing favor, neither prolonging summers nor shortening winters, not knowing nor recognizing—yet I follow the Heavenly Emperor’s will.”’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘Like Cao Can [曹参], who served as Han’s chancellor, where Hui Di [惠帝] criticized him for not attending to affairs. The account in the *Book of Han* [汉书] has already been cited—no need to repeat it here.’ His governance is described in *The Fifth and Eighty Chapter of the Bright and Virtuous* [闷闷章第五十八].\"\n\nMisfortune, oh misfortune, is the reverse of fortune,\nFortune, oh fortune, harbors misfortune within.\n*Extended meaning:* Fortune concealed within misfortune—\nas in *Liezi*’s account of a Song man who practiced benevolence and righteousness.\n*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *Sayings of the Symbol* [说符篇], *already cited in meaning—no need to repeat.*\n\n*Extended meaning:* Misfortune hidden within fortune—\nas in *Liezi*’s account of the wealthy man of Yu’s ancestral hall.\n*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *Sayings of the Symbol* [说符篇], *already cited in meaning—no need to repeat.*\n\nThus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nSharp yet does not pierce,\nUpright yet does not overreach,\nLuminous yet does not dazzle.\n*Extended meaning:* The *Classic* says: \"Upright and gentle.\"\n*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* [尚书] *□* *The Admonitions of Gao Yao* [皋陶谟].\nGao Yao spoke: \"Du, also, in conduct has nine virtues.\nIt is said that if a man has virtue, then his words are adopted.\nYu asked: 'How?'\nGao Yao replied: 'Wide yet cautious, wide and gentle yet dignified and cautious.\nGentle yet steadfast, gentle and obedient yet firmly rooted.\nReverent yet respectful, earnestly reverent and meticulous.\nIn chaos yet respectful—chaos is order.\nAgitated yet resolute, trained in agitation yet firmly determined.\nUpright yet gentle, direct yet warm and temperate.\nSimple yet honorable, simple yet principled.\nStrong yet solid, strong and robust yet sincere.\nPowerful yet righteous—powerful in courage yet virtuous.\nManifest their constant virtue—manifest means evident.\nTheir virtue is evident in their person, and yet they remain constant from beginning to end—truly auspicious scholars.'\n*Chapter on Governing Men and Serving Heaven* [治人事天] *Fifty-Ninth.*\n\nNow, only frugality is called early preparation.\nEarly preparation is the accumulation of virtue.\nAccumulate virtue greatly, and nothing shall you fail to overcome.\nFail to overcome nothing, and none shall know your limit.\nKnow no limit, and you may have a realm.\n*Extended meaning:* Mencius said: \"Cultivate the mind, nurture the nature—this is how one serves Heaven.\"\n*Quoted from* *Mencius* [孟子] *□* *Exhausting the Heart* [尽心章句上].\n*Note:* \"Cultivate\" means to hold fast without abandoning; \"nurture\" means to follow without harm; \"serve\" means to attend without transgression.\n\n*Extended meaning:* The utmost virtue—fire cannot burn it, water cannot drown it.\n*Quoted from* *Liezi* [列子] *□* *The Yellow Emperor* [黄帝篇].\nAll things are without love or fear—\nentering water, not drowned;\nentering fire, not burned;\nhewn or beaten, no pain;\nstruck or battered, no injury;\nwalking on air as on solid ground,\nsleeping on void as on a couch—\nclouds and mists do not obstruct his sight,\nthunder and lightning do not disturb his hearing,\npraise and blame do not sway his heart,\nmountains and valleys do not impede his step—\nhis movement is divine.\n\n*Extended meaning:* Once, Geng Sangzi dwelt on the slopes of Yu Mountain.\n*Quoted from* *Zhuangzi* [庄子] *□* *Geng Sang Chu* [庚桑楚].\nOnce, Geng Sangzi bore the surname Geng, given name Chu, a disciple of the Old Master.\nHe dwelt on the slopes of Yu Mountain.\nThe mountain is named in the land of Lu.\n\nThe meaning already cited is complete, and no repetition is made.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Governing the Great Realm**\nTo rule the world with the Dao,\nits spirits shall lack divinity.\n\n*Extended meaning:* When birds, beasts, fish, and turtles all thrive,\nthen the spirits and gods also find peace.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* [《尚书》] *□* *The Instructions of Yi* [《伊训》], admonishing King Tai Jia, the heir to the throne:\n\n*\"Alas!

'I have no offerings for the sacrificial beasts.'\nTang sent him cattle and sheep.\nThe Lord of Ge ate them but still did not sacrifice.\nTang sent someone again to ask, 'Why do you not

in *The Spring and Autumn Annals* and *Records of the Grand Historian*.\nZigong advised King Gou of Yue, saying: 'If Your Majesty truly sends troops to aid him,\nand uses precious treasures to please

this,\nand so ultimately faces none.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Jin Jie Yang** had no **double commands**,\nand **Lu Zhong You** had no **premature pledges**—\nthese are praised in both ancient and modern times.\nQuoted:\n*\"**Jin Jie Yang** had no double commands\"—\nin *The Spring and Autumn Annals*, **Duke Xuān of Lu**, Year 15,\nspring, *\"Gong Sun Guifu met the Chu lord at Song.\nThe people

You cherished the upright and distanced the petty.\n\nNow it is not so. You treat the petty lightly, familiarizing yourself with them and drawing near. To be intimate with the petty is not the Dao of governance. To distance the upright is not the virtue of a flourishing state. This is the fourth failure to persist.\n\nIn the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty modeled yourself after the sage-kings of Tang and Yu, reducing gold and returning to simplicity. In recent years, however, you have taken delight in rare and difficult-to-obtain treasures, sparing no effort to acquire them—no matter how distant. Your fondness for luxuries has grown, yet the pursuit of substance remains unattainable. This is the fifth failure to persist.\n\nIn the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty sought the worthy as if parched. Those recommended by the virtuous were trusted and entrusted. In recent years, however, you favor and detest those whom the virtuous condemn, and those you recommend are not necessarily trustworthy. A lifetime of conduct does not vanish in an instant. Moreover, the upright cultivate benevolence and magnanimity, while the petty thrive on slander and calumny for their own gain. If Your Majesty does not discern their roots but lightly judges them, you drive the steadfast from the path while advancing the scheming, causing men to seek only to evade blame and exert no true effort. This is the sixth failure to persist.\n\nWhen Your Majesty first ascended the throne, you abolished the hunting grounds within and cut off the sources of the chase without. Yet after several years, you could not sustain your resolve. Though you did not indulge in prolonged hunts, you sometimes exceeded the proper rites of the three drives, making the pleasures of the chase visible to the people and the tribute of falcons and hounds reaching even to the distant barbarians. You depart at dawn and return only at night, finding joy in galloping, heedless of unforeseen calamities. Once such recklessness takes hold, how can it be rectified? This is the seventh failure to persist.\n\nConfucius said: *\"A ruler governs his ministers with propriety, and a minister serves his ruler with loyalty.\"* When Your Majesty first took the throne, you received your subjects with reverence, and the benevolence of the ruler flowed downward while the loyalty of the ministers ascended. In recent years, however, you have neglected much. When they wish to speak, your demeanor is not welcoming; when they wish to petition, your grace is not extended. You often seize upon their faults and interrogate them over trivial errors. Even with the most eloquent arguments, none can fully express their loyalty. How then can you expect harmony between ruler and subjects, or mutual trust between sovereign and minister? This is the eighth failure to persist.\n\nArrogance must not be indulged, desires must not be gratified, pleasures must not be carried to excess, and ambition must not be sated. In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty diligently governed, bending yourself to serve others. Yet in recent years, you have subtly grown proud, relying on the grandeur of your achievements, and scorned the wisdom of past sages. You look down upon the present age—this is the growth of arrogance. Though you may suppress your inclinations and follow counsel, you cannot forget it—this is the gratification of desire. Your mind is set on amusement, your heart knows no satiety. Though you have not entirely abandoned governance, you no longer devote yourself wholly to the Dao—this is pleasure nearing its peak. The land is at peace, the barbarians submit, yet you still exhaust the soldiers and horses, punishing distant tribes—this is ambition nearing fulfillment. This is the ninth failure to persist.\n\nIn the time of Yao and Tang, or Shun and Wu, there were no absent disasters. Yet they were called sages because they had both beginning and end, doing nothing and desiring nothing. In recent years, however, the people have been weary from labor, and those of the Central Plains are especially exhausted. The artisans of the capital are all detained daily for forced labor. The soldiers of the regular armies are frequently sent on separate expeditions. The markets of the villages are never empty of conscripts, and the roads are filled with relays of forced laborers.\n\nThe harm once taken root, it is easy to be startled and disturbed. Should drought or flood strike, and the grain and wheat fail to harvest, the people’s hearts may not remain as settled as before. This is the tenth failure to persist.\n\n**On External Treasures:**\nThe common world values gold, jade, pearls, and jewels. The *Qianziwen* commentary states: *\"Gold is born in Lishui.\"* Lishui is in Yongchang Commandery of Yizhou, where gold often floats to the surface—all of it superior quality. Jade comes from the southern Kun Mountain. In the valleys of Kun Mountain in Chu and Jing, fine jade is found. Pearls, sometimes called *nightlight*, may reach an inch in diameter, their glow illuminating twelve chariots. *Bao* refers to rare and precious plants, minerals, feathers, and furs—whatever the world holds dear. Yet these external treasures, sought beyond measure, exhaust life and harm nature. Unlike the Daoist ruler, who treasures virtue, or the cultivator, who values the Way alone, they do not covet what lies beyond. Thus, they preserve their natural state, unburdened by rare and costly goods.\n\n**Chapter 65: The Difficulty of Governing the People**\nThe people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive. Therefore, ruling by cleverness is ruinous to the state, while not ruling by cleverness brings fortune.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nZhuangzi said: *\"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder.\"* The *Zhuangzi* [\"Bùkē Qìe\" (器蠹)] states:\n*\"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder. How do we know this? When the cleverness of crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps increases, birds are thrown into confusion above. The net is small and fine, resembling the star *Bi*, hence its name. Shooting with a bowstring is called *yi*. The crossbow’s trigger is called *ji*. When the cleverness of hooks, bait, and nets increases, fish are thrown into confusion in the water. *Gǔ* and *zhuì* are both nets; *sǔn* is also a trap. Hooks are fishing hooks; bait is fish bait. When the cleverness of *xuēgé*—the frames for spreading nets—and *luòluò*, *jiéfú* increases, beasts are thrown into confusion in the marshes. The *Erya* says: Nets for birds are called *luò*; nets for hares are called *jié* or *fú*—all are hare nets. Cleverness in deceit, gradual poisoning, and sophistry—such as *jiéhuá* (pretense of knowledge), *jiānbái* (rigid argument), and convoluted speech—when excessive, confuses the people with debate. The *Xihua* Master’s commentary states: *\"Cleverness in calculation, deceit, and gradual corruption harms things. Jiéhuá is probing; jiānbái is rigid argument; sophistry and pretense are deceitful.\"* The cleverness of rigid argument and the sophistry of *jiān* (contradiction) and *bái* (dogmatic assertion), along with the deceit of *jié* (pretense) and *tóngyì* (false agreement), all deviate from true principle. Thus, the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lying in the love of cleverness. For true sages, wisdom is a sharp tool for the state.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nTake Emperor Ming of Han, whose narrow and scrutinizing nature—\n*The Han Shu* records this in detail; no need for repetition.\n\n**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as Kings of All Valleys**\nThe river and sea reign over all valleys because they excel in humility, thus becoming kings of all valleys.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The Earth’s Way transforms fullness into flowing humility.\"* The *Yi* [\"Qian\" (谦) Hexagram] states:\n*\"Qian (Humility) is auspicious. The Heavenly Way descends to aid and shines brightly. The Earthly Way is low yet ascends. The Heavenly Way diminishes fullness and increases humility. The Earthly Way transforms fullness into flowing humility. Ghosts and spirits harm fullness but bless humility. Human nature abhors fullness and loves humility. Humility is exalted yet uncrossable; the virtuous person’s end is thus. Therefore, the sage, wishing to surpass others, speaks humbly. Wishing to lead others, places himself last. Thus, though in high position, he is not burdensome; though in front, he does no harm. Therefore, the world gladly follows without tiring.\"*\n\n**Elaboration:**\nYet the sage knows that fullness invites loss.\n*The Shangshu* [\"Dà Yǔ Mó\" (大禹谟)] states:\n*\"Thirty days, the people rebelled against the command. Yi Zhan advised Yu: 'Only virtue moves Heaven, reaching even the distant. Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain. This is the Way of Heaven.'\"*\nIt further cites *\"restraining oneself in humility and retreat\"*—the fourth line of *Qian* is without misfortune, for those who do not violate principle move in accord with reason, thus facing no adversity.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nAs in *Zhuangzi*, where Duke Ai of Lu asked Zhongni:\n*The Zhuangzi* [\"Dé Chōng Fú\" (德充符)] states:\n\nThe meaning is already complete, so it shall not be repeated again.\nBecause he does not contend, therefore none under Heaven can contend with him.\n\n**Elaboration:**\n*The Classic of Documents* states:\n*\"You alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you in ability.\nYou alone do not vaunt, and none under Heaven will contend with you in merit.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Classic of Documents* [\"Dà Yǔ Mó\" (大禹谟)]:\nThe Emperor said, *\"O, Shun, the Emperor!\nCome, O Yu.\nThe floodwaters are vast and turbulent.\nHeed my warning, and fulfill your success—only you are virtuous.\nYou have been diligent in the state, frugal in your household, and have not been arrogant or presumptuous—only you are virtuous.\nYou alone do not boast, and none under Heaven will contend with you in ability.\nYou alone do not vaunt, and none under Heaven will contend with you in merit.\nI extol your virtue and praise your great achievements.\nThe celestial mandate rests upon you—you shall ascend to become the sovereign of the realm.\"*\n\n*End of the hand-copied annotations for Volume Seventeen of The Daoist Classic of Virtue and Power*\n*Beginning of Volume Eighteen*\n*Collected Works of the Recluse Wang Shouzheng of Five-Peak Serenity*\n*Chapter Sixty-Seven: \"All Under Heaven\"*\n\nI possess three treasures, which I cherish and uphold:\nOne is called **benevolence (慈)**, two is called **frugality (俭)**, three is called **\"not daring to act before all under Heaven (不敢为天下先)**.\"\n\n*Annotations expand upon:*\nThe Great Yu cultivated his conduct, and **restraint (克检)** was his virtue.\nKing Wen of Zhou governed with **frugality as his Dao (化)**.\n\n*Hand-copied excerpt from The Classic of Documents (尚书)□Yu’s Discourse (大禹谟):*\n\"Frugal in your household, not arrogant or presumptuous—only you are virtuous.\nAgain, it is said that **frugality was King Wen’s Dao**.\nThis is the **achievement (功致)** of the ode *\"The Ram and the Magpie’s Nest\"* from *The Mao Poems (毛诗)□Country Songs (国风)□羔羊□鹊巢*.\nThe customs of the Southern Chu state reflect King Wen’s governance, where all in office practiced **frugality and rectitude (节俭正直)**, their virtue as gentle as a ram.\n\n*The Classic of Documents (书) states:*\n‘**Reverence and frugality are the essence of virtue (恭俭惟德)**.\nThis is the language of *The Classic of Documents□The Officers of Zhou (周官篇)*:\n**\"One’s station does not invite arrogance, one’s emoluments do not invite excess—reverence and frugality are the essence of virtue, lest you bear falsehood (无载尔伪).**\nTo act with **virtue brings ease to the heart and rest on the day (作德心逸日休)**,\nTo act with **falsehood brings labor to the heart and clumsiness on the day (作伪心劳日拙).**\n\n**Benevolence (慈)** thus enables **courage (勇)**.\n**Frugality (俭)** thus enables **breadth (广)**.\n**\"Not daring to act before all under Heaven (不敢为天下先)\"** thus enables **completion of great works and enduring leadership (成器长)**.\n\n*Annotations expand upon:*\nMencius said: **\"The virtuous have no rival (仁者无敌).\"**\n*Hand-copied excerpt from Mencius□The Sentences of King Hui of Liang (梁惠王章句上):*\nMencius’ reply to King Hui of Liang.\nIf he drowned his people, and you went to punish him—who would dare rival the king?\nThus it is said: **\"The virtuous have no rival, O king—do not doubt.\"**\n\n*Annotations expand upon:*\nEmperor Shun was **by nature virtuous (性仁)**, and his punishments were limited to four crimes.\n*Hand-copied excerpt from Mencius□The Exhaustion of the Heart (尽心上):*\nMencius said: **\"Yao and Shun were virtuous by nature, Tang and Wu by personal cultivation, the Five Hegemons by borrowed virtue.

benevolence.\nWhen he held office and assisted in governance,\nDuring the reigns of Emperor Cheng and Emperor Ai,\nHe labored diligently for the state,\nUpright in his conduct, his deeds always commended—\nHow could he be one who, though praised at home and abroad,\nFeigned virtue while acting contrary to it?\"*\n\nYet Mang, though lacking in virtue, possessed cunning and deceitful talent,\nAnd leveraged the four generations of his family’s power,\nEncountering a weakened Han dynasty with three severed imperial lines,\nWhile the dowager empress’s longevity made him the clan’s patron—\nThus he indulged his treachery, consummating the crime of usurpation.\n\nSpeaking of this, it was also the work of fate,\nNot something human strength could govern.\n\nWhen he usurped the throne and ruled illegitimately,\nHis tyranny over the people reached the heavens,\nHis cruelty and wickedness knew no bounds,\nHis poison spread across the Central States,\nHis chaos extended to the barbarian lands—\nYet he still had not sated his desires.\n\nThus, within the Four Seas, the people lost their joy in life,\nTheir voices rose in tumult, their words clamored like dust.\nBoth court and commoners seethed with anger,\nFrom near and far, they rose in revolt.\nCities fell unguarded, the state fractured,\nUntil the land’s towns and cities became ruins,\nMounds and graves were dug up,\nHarm extended to all living beings,\nAnd guilt fell upon the bones of the dead.\n\nAmong the treacherous ministers and wicked tyrants recorded in history,\nNone matched Wang Mang in the scale of his ruin.\n\nSome say: *\"Later Han’s Emperor Guangwu, with eight thousand men,\nDefeated Wang Mang’s army of a million and executed him,\nRestoring the Han dynasty to its former glory.\"*\n\n**Extended Commentary:**\nThe Qin King Fú Jiān mobilized ninety-seven hundred thousand soldiers.\nQuoted from: According to *The Book of Jin*,\nFú Jiān, styled Yǒnggù, was Jiān’s grandson and Xióng’s son.\nHaving usurped the imperial title, he appointed Wáng Měng as chancellor,\nAnd pacified all the states—only the southeastern corner remained for Jin.\nWhen Měng died, Jiān frequently convened his ministers,\nDesiring to attack Jin.\nThe ministers all cited the Year Star and the Constellation Star in the Dipper and Ox,\nSaying Jin’s division was not yet ripe for conquest.\nThere were omens of long stars in wells and water shadows,\nAnd other portents too numerous to recount.\nThe monk Dào Ān joined in pleading against the war, but Jiān would not listen.\n\nThus he conscripted ninety-seven hundred thousand soldiers,\nA thousand li long, their banners stretching into the distance—\nYet Mùróng Wěi, Mùróng Chuí, and others all secretly held back their troops,\nAnd the army reached the city of Yī.\nJin’s Xiè Xuán, styled Yòuliú, led his forces to meet the enemy.\nJiān advanced to Leisurely Hill, arraying his troops along the Fēishuǐ River.\nXuán’s army could not cross.\nXuán sent word to Fú Róng:\n*\"You have crossed far into our lands,\nYet camp beside the river in formation—\nDo you not wish for swift battle?\"*\nThe troops gradually withdrew,\nAllowing their soldiers room to maneuver.\nXuán said to his generals:\n*\"Let us rein in our horses and observe—\nIs this not delightful?\"*\nJiān’s men all said:\n*\"We should block the Fēishuǐ River,\nPreventing them from crossing.\nOur numbers are vast, theirs few—\nWe must ensure complete victory.\"*\nJiān said:\n*\"Retreat the army,\nLet them pass,\nAnd I will press my iron cavalry—\nHundreds of thousands strong—\nTo the riverbank and slaughter them.\"*\nRóng also agreed.\nThus Jiān ordered the retreat,\nAnd the troops, in confusion, could not halt.\n\n「Then Xuán, along with Xié Yàn and Huán Yī, led eight thousand elite troops across the Fēishuǐ River. Xié Ān’s stone army withdrew slightly from Zhāng Wēi’s forces, and Xuán and Yàn pressed forward, engaging in a decisive battle south of the Fēishuǐ River.\n\nFirm struck by an arrow in mid-stream, he beheaded Fú Róng on the battlefield. The enemy forces fled in disarray, trampling one another and drowning in the river, their numbers beyond reckoning. The Fēishuǐ ran red with blood. The remaining troops abandoned their armor and fled in the night; upon hearing the sound of wind and cranes, they mistook it for the approach of the imperial forces.\n\nExposed to the elements and suffering from hunger and cold, seventeen or eighteen out of every ten perished. Firm was thus utterly defeated and retreated to Cháng’ān.\n\nLater, Mùróng Chōng raised his army, causing great turmoil within the Passes. Mùróng Chuí also rebelled against Firm and returned to Yè, proclaiming himself the Later Yān. Yáo Xīn likewise rebelled against Firm, proclaiming himself the Later Qín. Additionally, Lǚ Guāng declared himself the Later Liáng in Liáng State. Rebels and deserters proliferated like bristles on a hedgehog, with uprisings erupting everywhere. Cháng’ān was besieged and pressed by Mùróng Zhòng, its inhabitants facing dire peril.\n\nFirm then left his eldest son, Tàizǐ Hóng, to defend the city, and fled with five hundred horsemen to Wǔjiāng Shān. There, he was captured by Yáo Xīn’s general Yǐn Wéi and delivered to Xīn, who ordered his abdication. Firm cursed him, and was slain by Xīn.\n\nThe realm’s Tàizǐ Hóng, along with Zhāng Dàfū and others, surrendered the city to Mùróng Chōng, and the state thereby perished.\n\nYǎn Yì further notes: If it were Emperor Yáng of the Sui Dynasty, commanding four hundred thousand troops to assemble at Píngyáng.\n\nQuoted from *The Book of Sui*: Emperor Yáng’s given name was Guǎng. Upon Emperor Wén’s ascension, he was封 as Jìn Róng. His nature was one of artificial display; though he was praised for his仁孝 virtue, he deposed the heir-apparent and installed himself instead.\n\nAfter taking the throne, he visited Luòyáng, established the Eastern Capital, and conscripted over a hundred thousand able-bodied men from Hé Nán to dredge the Píng Canal, reaching Huái and Sì. He commissioned a hundred thousand dragon and phoenix vessels, establishing their collective name. All were adorned with gold and jade, and he then proceeded to Jiāngdū.\n\nHis fleet stretched unbroken for a thousand miles, the prow and stern of his ships linked in endless succession.»\n\nEight years into his reign, he personally led troops to campaign against Liáo, claiming an army of two hundred thousand. The battle against Gāolí failed, and he recalled his forces.\n\nIn the thirteenth year, he visited Jiāngdū—now Yángzhōu—where the ancient Chǔ royal palace stood. There, Lǐ Mì, Dòu Jiàndé, and others raised their banners, and bandits proliferated, seizing and plundering counties across all the **Dào**. Rebel leaders vied for prominence, and no state or prefecture in the empire remained free of them. To compound the misery, famine and drought ravaged the land, with men and women dying in such numbers they could not be counted. Thus, Emperor Gāozǔ of Táng raised the banner of righteousness in Tàiyuán, entered Cháng'ān, and rescued the empire from its calamities, replacing Emperor Yáng (also called Yì or Shì).\n\nYáng was the son of the reigning sovereign. Initially, he was honored as the **Shànghuáng**, but later he was killed by Yǔhuà Guāngjí.\n\nThe following year, the Sui dynasty abdicated in favor of the Táng.\n\nEmperor Gāozǔ and Emperor Tàizōng seized the opportunity to restore order, conquering the empire with merely three hundred thousand troops—like pulling down rotting wood or crushing withered branches—until the realm was finally pacified. Such were the fates of **Fú Jiān** and Emperor Yáng: true **\"fēnbēng\"** in the making.\n\nAs the *Lǔyǔ* states: *\"A state divided by strife and disintegration is thus.\"* All the above examples share one fate: they relied on their strength and waged war to seek victory, yet met crushing defeat from which they could not recover.\n\nAs for the **Yìzhōng** of the *Chūnqiū* (Lǐ Gōng), when **Qín Mù Gōng** sought to attack Jìn, the matter has already been detailed in the **Yìzhōng**—no need to repeat it here.\n\nThus concludes the **Dàodé ZhēnJīng Yìzhōng Miàojiàn** scroll, the nineteenth of the **Miàojiàn**.\n\n**Dao/Way and Virtue True Classic Elucidations Manuscript Roll Twenty**\n*Collected by the Recluse of Five Peaks, Qing’an Rongsheng, Wang Shouzheng*\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seventh: The Dao/Way of Heaven**\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is like drawing a bow.\nThe high it depresses, the low it raises,\nThe excessive it diminishes, the deficient it supplements.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nThe bow’s use requires harmonizing materials and form,\nSo that slack and tension are balanced and effective.\n*Quoted from the Zhou Li:*\nThe bowmaker crafts bows, gathering six materials—dry wood, sinew, horn, silk, glue, and lacquer—at their proper times.\nWhen the six materials are gathered, the skilled artisan blends them.\nThe wood must be red-black with a resonant tone.\nFor long-range shooting, power is used; for deep penetration, straightness.\nThe horn should be green-white with a full tip.\nGenerally, autumn-killed horn is thick, spring-killed horn is thin.\nThe horn of young oxen is straight and glossy; that of old oxen is curved and rough.\nWhen the three colors are complete, it is excellent—\nThen in winter, dry the wood;\nIn summer, treat the sinew;\nIn spring, soften the horn;\nIn autumn, combine silk, glue, and lacquer.\nWhen the form is set in cold, the bow neither sags nor strains.\nWith fine materials and skilled craftsmanship, made at the right time,\nThis is called *Sanjun* [Three Harmonies].\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Establishing the Dao/Way of Heaven: yin and yang.\"*\n*Quoted from the Zhouyi’s* Sayings on the Trigrams:\n*\"In ancient times, the Sage composed the Changes*\n*To align with the principles of nature and life.*\nThus, the Dao/Way of Heaven is established as yin and yang,\nThe Dao/Way of Earth as softness and hardness,\nThe Dao/Way of Humanity as virtue and righteousness.\nCombining the Three Powers and pairing them,\nThus the Changes form six lines into a hexagram.\nDividing yin and yang, alternating softness and hardness,\nThus the Changes form six positions into a chapter.\"\n\n**Elucidations:**\nThe sun and moon, cold and heat,\nCome and go in turn—\nThus, the excessive is diminished.\nWhat departs is given to the deficient,\nAnd the year’s work is fulfilled.\n*Quoted from the Yi System:*\n*\"The sun departs, the moon arrives; the moon departs, the sun arrives.\nThe sun and moon push against each other, and light is born.\nCold departs, heat arrives; heat departs, cold arrives.\nCold and heat push against each other, and the year’s work is fulfilled.\nIs this not so?\"*\n\n**Elucidations:**\nThus, raising the deficient and diminishing the excessive through humility,\nSeeking balance and equitable distribution.\n*Quoted:*\nFrom the above text, the *Yi’s* Humility Hexagram’s symbol says:\n*\"The Dao/Way of Heaven diminishes the excessive and supplements humility.\"*\nIts image:\n*\"Earth over mountain: Humility.\nThe superior person, with compassion, aids the few,\nBalancing things and distributing evenly.\"*\nNow, taking these passages to illustrate\nThe warning of Heaven’s Dao/Way—depressing the high, raising the low.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nBut humanity’s Dao/Way is the opposite—\nDiminishing the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nThe *Yi’s* Diminishing Hexagram says:\n*\"Diminish the lower, benefit the upper; its Dao/Way ascends.\"*\nThe Benefiting Hexagram says:\n*\"Diminish the upper, benefit the lower; the people rejoice without bound.\"*\n*Quoted from the Yi:*\nThe Diminishing Hexagram’s *Simian* says:\n*\"Diminish the lower, benefit the upper; its Dao/Way ascends.\"*\nThe Benefiting Hexagram’s *Simian* says:\n*\"Diminish the upper, benefit the lower; the people rejoice without bound.\"*\nFrom above to below, its Dao/Way shines greatly.\nMoreover, according to the original hexagram’s interpretation,\nIn the T’ai Hexagram, diminishing the Nine at the third position\nAnd benefiting the Nine at the top forms Diminishing.\nIn the Pi Hexagram, diminishing the Nine at the fourth position\nAnd benefiting the Nine at the first forms Benefiting.\nThus, taking from the upper’s excess\nTo benefit the lower’s deficiency—\nThis is called Benefiting.\nIts meaning:\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is balanced—\nThe excessive must be diminished, the deficient must be supplemented,\nOpposite to humanity’s Dao/Way.\nThis is diminishing the deficient to serve the excessive,\nTaking from the many to benefit the few.\nNow, combining the meanings of\nDepressing the high, raising the low,\nDiminishing the excessive, supplementing the deficient,\nThe essentials for governing the state and harmonizing the people,\nThe rules for cultivating oneself and aligning with the Dao/Way—\nThis is its unique virtue.\nWho can serve the world with their excess?\nOnly those in accord with the Dao/Way.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nIn the past, the Celestial Master Zhi Qianyou,\nWhen alive, was renowned for his *Kaochao* method.\n*Quoted from the Celestial Master’s Family Transmission:*\nThe full account is already in the *Elucidations*—\nNo need to repeat it here.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Soft and Weak of the World**\n\nThe soft and weak of the world have none more so than water,\nYet in assaulting the firm and strong, none can surpass it—\nIts power cannot be exchanged.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nWater’s nature is gentle, yielding without contention,\nIts motion and stillness adapt to the times,\nIts form and shape conform to the vessel.\n\nQuoted from\n\n**Thus the Sage speaks:**\n\nTo bear the filth of the state—this is called the steward of the ancestral altars.\nTo bear the misfortunes of the state—this is called the sovereign of all under Heaven.\nUpright speech as if inverted.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nIf the sovereign can contain impurity and endure defilement,\nDrawing all the faults of the myriad regions unto himself.\n\nQuoted from *The Book of Documents* [□ *Tang’s Admonition*]:\n*\"If you have virtue, I dare not conceal it.\nIf the guilt lies with me, I dare not pardon myself—\nOnly let it be weighed in the heart of the Most High.\nAs for the myriad regions, if they have guilt, it lies with me alone.\nIf I alone bear guilt, I shall not harm the myriad regions.\"*\n\n**Elucidations:**\nIn the Spring and Autumn period, Jin attacked Chu, advancing three *shè* without halt.\nThe ministers requested permission to strike.\nQuoted from *The Honglei Explanations*:\n*\"Jin attacked Chu—three *shè* (each *shè* being thirty *li*)—and did not stop.\nThe ministers said: ‘May we strike?’\nZhuang Wang replied: ‘In the days of my predecessors, Jin did not attack Chu.’*\n(The meaning is complete; no need to repeat the full text.)\n\n**Elucidations:**\nSong Jing Gong was afflicted by Upholder of the Stars [Mars] in the Heart constellation.\nQuoted from *The Honglei Explanations* (the full text is preserved there; no need to repeat.)\n\n「Chapter Seventy-Nine: Resolving Great Grievances\nResolving great grievances will inevitably leave lingering grievances—\nhow can this be considered a good deed?\n\n**Elucidations:**\nZhuangzi said: *\"Those who seek vengeance do not break the *nuè* handle,*\n*even if they harbor resentment, they do not blame the stray tiles.*\nThe *nuè* handle is a component of the *nuè* sword (a legendary weapon).\nThough one might resent the stray tiles,\npeople do not blame them—\nfor they lack sentience.\nThus, the sage holds only the left contract,\nand does not demand repayment from others.*\n\n**Elucidations:**\nFrom *The Book of Rites (Liji)*:\n*\"The one presenting millet holds the contract’s terms.*\n(The meaning is complete; no need to repeat the full text.)\n\nTherefore, those with **virtue** oversee contracts (*qì*), those without oversee the *chè* (lit. ‘piercing’).\nThe Dao of Heaven shows no favoritism—\nit always aligns with those of **virtue**.\n\n**Elucidations:**\n(Like Guo Ju’s filial piety toward his mother—\nthe meaning is already complete; no need to repeat.)\n\n**Chapter Eighty: The Small State with Few People**\nThe small state with few people...»\n\nLet the state have tenfold and hundredfold implements yet not use them.\nLet the people hold death in reverence, yet not flee their homes.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nAs with the Three Migrations of Pan Geng—\nPan Geng, younger brother of Yang Jia,\nfrom his ancestor Yi’s capital at Geng Yi by the River,\nmoved to Yin.\n**Annotation:** *The Three Migrations of Pan Geng* (the *Rites of Zhou* states):\nThe upper section addressed the nobles,\nthe middle the common folk,\nthe lower the officials, clans, and surnames—\nillustrating the benefits of relocation\nand the perils of refusal.\nAfter Pan Geng’s migration,\nhe settled his people in their new homes,\nthen ordered their ranks,\nand soothed the myriad multitudes.\n\nThe Great King’s relocation beneath Ji Mountain\nis already detailed in the *Sixteen Chapters of the Great State* (under the *Downflow* section),\nso it need not be repeated.\n\n**Elucidations:**\nWhen the people scatter and dwell not in peace,\nyet still return to labor and restore their homes—\neven the aged and widowed\nfind their proper place.\nThough there are boats and carriages,\nnone are mounted upon them.\nThough there are armor and weapons,\nnone are arrayed in battle.\nLet the people return to knotted cords for their use.\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*Carving wood into boats*\nto cross the waters.\n**Annotation:** *The Zhou易 (Easy)* (in its *Lower Appendices*) states:\n*\"Carving wood into boats, hewing wood into oars—*\nthe advantage of boats and oars\nlies in ferrying what cannot pass\nand reaching distant lands,\nthus benefiting all under Heaven.\"\nThis is drawn from the *Yan* (泱) hexagram,\nwhose *Simile* (彖辞) reads:\n*\"Advantageous to cross great rivers—*\nto ride upon wood is to achieve merit.\"*\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*Zhuangzi* says:\nIn the age of **ultimate virtue**,\nmountains lack paths or tunnels,\nmarshes lack boats or bridges—\nall things thrive in clusters,\nbound to their native lands.\n**Annotation:** *From Zhuangzi’s* **《Ma Ti (马蹄篇)》** *it reads:*\n*\"In the age of **ultimate virtue**,\ntheir movement is **filling**—*\n**filling** (填填) denotes contentment.\nTheir gaze is **precious**—*\n**precious** (颠颠) means upright vision.\"*\n\nAt this time,\nmountains had no paths or tunnels,\nmarshes had no boats or bridges—\nall things flourished in clusters,\nbound to their native lands,\nbirds and beasts gathered in herds,\ngrasses and trees grew in abundance.\n\nTherefore, beasts could be tethered and led to roam,\nand the nests of birds could be climbed to observe.\n\nIn the age of **ultimate virtue**,\npeople dwelled together with beasts,\nand their clans mingled with all things—\nhow could they distinguish between the **noble** and the **petty**?\n\nAt this time,\nthe people were self-sufficient,\nwith no need for trade, commerce, or migration.\nThus, it is said:\n*\"Though there were boats and carriages,\nthere was nothing to ride upon.\"*\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*\"Though there were strong armor and sharp weapons,\nthere was no occasion to display them.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Mencius* **《Liang Hui Wang Zhang Ju Shang (梁惠王章句上)》**,\nMencius spoke to **King Hui of Liang** (梁惠王):\n*\"If you, O King, were to practice **benevolent governance** (仁政) among the people,\nreduce punishments,\nlighten taxes and levies,\nand encourage deep plowing with frequent crop rotation—\nthen the strong would use their leisure days\nto cultivate filial piety, fraternal respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness,\nserving their fathers and elder brothers at home,\nand their superiors abroad.\nThus, they could be made to wield their spears\nand repel the **fierce armor and sharp weapons** of Qin and Chu.\"*\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*The Book of Changes* (《易》) system states:\n*\"In the upper antiquity, they governed by knotting cords.\nLater sages replaced this with written contracts,\nand the myriad officials governed with them,\nwhile the common people discerned right from wrong.\nThis is drawn from the **Jue** (夬) hexagram,\nwhich signifies **resolution** (决).\nFive yang lines jointly resolve one yin line—\ntaking the meaning of decisive judgment.\"*\n\n*\"They found their food sweet,\ntheir garments fine,\ntheir dwellings secure,\nand their customs joyful.\nNeighboring countries were visible to one another,\nand the sounds of roosters and dogs could be heard—\nyet the people lived and died\nwithout ever visiting one another.\"*\n\nThe **Elucidations** state:\n\n*\"Though their fare be coarse—vegetable gruel and hemp porridge—\nwhat they eat is always sweet.\n**Annotations:**\n*Vegetable fare* is taken from *The Analects* (《论语》·述而篇), where Confucius says:\n*'To eat coarse rice, drink water, bend one’s arm as a pillow—\njoy lies therein.'*\n*Unrighteous wealth is like floating clouds to me.*\n\n*[Further], hemp porridge* is cited from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·让王篇):\n*When Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai,\nfor seven days he ate no cooked food,\nhis hemp porridge unseasoned,\nhis complexion wan—\nyet he played his lute and sang within his chamber.*\nHere, the intent transcends mere sweetness of food;\nit lies in the joy of the Dao itself.*\n\n---\n\n*\"Though their garments be rough—hemp cloth and deer-fur pelts—\nwhat they wear is always fine.\n**Annotations:**\nFrom *Liezi* (《列子》·天瑞篇):\n*Confucius wandered on Mount Tai,\nand saw Rong Qichang walking in the wilds of Yong,\nclad in deer-fur, girded with a rope,\nplucking his lute and singing.\nConfucius asked: ‘Master, whence comes your joy?’\nHe replied: ‘My joys are manifold.\nThat I am born human—this is my first joy.\nThat I am male, honored above female—this is my second.\nThat I have lived to ninety—this is my third.\nPoverty is the common lot; death, the end of all.\nTo dwell in the common and reach the end—what is there to fear?’\nConfucius said: ‘Truly, one who knows how to ease himself!’\nThus, this is cited to prove the joy of deer-fur attire.*\n\n---\n\n*\"Though their dwellings be humble—reed-thatched huts and wattle walls—\ntheir homes are always secure.\n**Annotations:**\n*Reed-thatched huts and wattle walls* are taken from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·让王篇):\n*Yuan Xian dwelt in Lu,\nin a walled chamber of four paces,\nthatched with living grass.\nHis wicker door was incomplete,\na willow branch its hinge.\nHis jar-windowed rooms,\npatched with coarse cloth—\nleaking above, damp below—\nhe sat cross-legged, plucking his strings.\nThus is proven the security of such humble dwellings.*\n\n---\n\n*\"Though they endure the torments of southern heat and northern cold,\ntheir abode is ever joyous.\n**Annotations:**\n*Southern heat and northern cold*—\nThe southernmost lands are lands of pure yang, scorched by fire-mountains,\nwhere rats spin their fur into cloth, called *fire-washed silk*.\nThe northernmost lands are lands of pure yin, frozen by ice-mountains,\nwhere silkworms dwell, known as *ice-silkworms*.\nThough neither heat nor cold can harm them,\nyet each abides in its place,\neach fulfills its nature—\nthus is proven the harmony of *dwelling in one’s place*.\n\n---\n\n*\"By nature, their customs know no untimely death,\ntheir land no pestilence.\n**Annotations:**\nFrom *Liezi* (《列子》·黄帝篇):\n*The Listening-to-the-Maiden Mountain lies in the River-Sea Isles,\nas recorded in *The Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\nUpon it dwell divine beings.\nThey breathe the wind, drink the dew,\nconsume no five grains,\ntheir hearts as deep as springs,\ntheir forms as pure as maidens.\nThey neither cling nor love;\nthe sage and the immortal serve them.\nThey neither fear nor rage;\nthe spirits and demons obey them.\nThey neither bestow nor repay,\nyet all is sufficient.\nThey neither hoard nor gather,\nyet lack nothing.\n*Shen* (蹇) means deficiency.\nThe harmony of yin and yang is constant,\nthe sun and moon ever bright,\nthe seasons ever true,\nthe winds and rains ever balanced,\nthe harvests ever bountiful.\nTheir land knows no injury,\ntheir people no calamity,\ntheir creatures no blemish,\ntheir spirits no malevolence.*\n\n---\n\n*\"Like fish that swim in rivers and lakes,\nor men who forget each other in the Way.\n**Annotations:**\nFrom *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·大宗师篇):\n*When the spring dries up,\nthe fish gather on land,\nblowing on one another to keep moist,\nsplashing each other with spittle—\nyet this is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes.*\n\n---\n\n*\"In one village, only the Zhu and Chen clans,\nintermarried through generations.\n**Annotations:**\nBai Juyi composed a poem in praise of this.\n*[Quoted from] ‘Trustworthy Words Are Not Beautiful’ (信言不美), Chapter Eighty.*\n\nTrue words are not beautiful,\nbeautiful words are not true.\nThe virtuous do not argue,\nthose who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not all-knowing,\nthe all-knowing are not wise.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nAs the *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Thieving words are most sweet,\nthe finest of tastes.\"*\n*\"Crafty words flow like a reed-pipe,\nthe finest of sounds.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Mao’s Commentary on the Odes* (《毛诗》·《小雅》·《巧言》):\n*\"The noble man makes many oaths,\nyet disorder grows long.*\n*The noble man trusts thieves,\nyet disorder grows violent.*\n*Thieving words are most sweet,\nyet disorder grows gluttonous.*\n*Not their steadfastness—\nit is the king’s fault.*\n*Tenderly nurtured, the willow grows,*\n*the noble man plants it.*\n*Coming and going, words are spoken,*\n*yet the heart counts them.*\n*Snake-like, grand words,*\n*they issue from the mouth.*\n*Crafty words flow like a reed-pipe,*\n*their falsehood is thick.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nConfucius said: *\"Words, merely to convey meaning—\nthus, no need for eloquence.\"*\nQuoted from *The Analects* (《论语》·《卫灵公》 15):\n*\"The Master said: ‘Words, merely to convey meaning—\nnothing more.’*\n*Language seeks only to express intent,*\n*not to adorn with richness.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*\"One thread runs through it all.\"*\nQuoted from *The Analects* (《论语》·《里仁》 4):\n*\"The Master said: ‘Zeng, my Way is one thread running through it all.’\"*\n*Zeng* was the name of Zengzi.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nZhuangzi said: *\"When ornamentation extinguishes substance,\nand erudition drowns the heart,\nthus it is said: ‘The all-knowing are not wise.’\"*\nQuoted from *Zhuangzi* (《庄子》·《缮性篇》):\n*\"Then they adorn it with ornament,\nenrich it with erudition.\nOrnamentation extinguishes substance,\nerudition drowns the heart—\nthen the people begin to be confused and disordered,\nunable to return to their true nature\nand restore their original state.*\n*The great principle speaks of how the world indulges in artificial pursuits,\nusing superficial elegance to obscure their innate simplicity.\nWith vast learning and broad reading,\nthey drown their pure and sincere hearts.\nThus they lose the Dao of effortless spontaneity.*\n*Hence the Classic says: ‘The wise are not all-knowing,\nthe all-knowing are not wise.’*\n*The Sage does not hoard.*\n*Having given to others,\nhe grows ever more abundant.*\n*Having given to others,\nhe grows ever more plentiful.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nFan Zhongyan instructed his son,

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Ten: Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing the One**\n\nWhen nurturing the vital essence and embracing the One,\nhow could it ever depart?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"To bear\"* (載) means to carry by vehicle.\n*\"To bear\"* (載) also means to ascend by vehicle.\n\nQuoted from *Broad Exalted Meaning*:\n*\"Nurturing the vital essence\"*—\nThe human body is where spirit-qi resides and where soul-spirit (魂魄) takes form.\nTo move and carry the body is like a vehicle bearing goods.\nThe *Western Ascension Scripture* states:\n*\"The body is the chariot of the spirit.\"*\nSince it is likened to a vehicle, it must be carried.\n\nThe **empty shell** (虚魄) is the manifestation of yin-qi—\nthe form of a person.\nYang-qi is formless—\nthe spirit of a person,\nthe vessel of form.\nYet when yang-qi has not yet descended,\nit lies inert, devoid of awareness,\nlike a dull stone or withered wood.\nWhen yang-qi descends,\nit gains movement—\nthus, form is called *arcane shell* (魄), belonging to yin.\nSpirit is called *soul* (魂), belonging to yang.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of yang-qi,\ndeath cannot be complete.\nAs long as there remains even a thread of yin-qi,\ntranscendence cannot be achieved.\nThus, refining yin-qi to exhaustion grants ascent to the Nine Heavens as an immortal,\nconsorting with yang.\nRefining yang-qi to exhaustion plunges one to the Nine Abysses as a ghost,\nconsorting with yin.\nTherefore, one must preserve the yang-soul,\nnurture the yin-shell,\nto safeguard life,\nembrace the One and uphold the Dao,\nlest it ever depart for an instant.\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nQu Yuan’s *Li Sao* states:\n*\"Bearing the vital essence and ascending the crimson mist,\nparting the floating clouds to mount upward.\"*\n\nQuoted:\nQu Yuan was a Grand Minister of the Three Gorges in Chu.\n*Li Sao* is the title of his literary work.\n*\"Bearing the vital essence\"* means to carry soul-spirit and ascend the crimson mist—\nthe crimson mist being the rising vapor of earthly breath.\n*\"Clouds\"* refers to the vapors of mountains and rivers.\n*\"Parting\"* means to depart.\nTo depart from floating clouds,\nto carry soul-spirit,\nto stride across the crimson mist and soar,\nto part from floating clouds and ascend—\nthis is the mastery of qi to achieve supreme softness.\nCould it be like the infant brother?\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThus it is said:\n*\"Hold firm to your resolve, yet do not exhaust your qi.\"*\n*\"Shuffling\"* and *\"hurrying\"*—\nthese are movements of qi,\nyet they agitate the mind.\n\nQuoted from *Mencius’ Discussion with Gongsun Chou, Upper Section*:\nGongsun Chou was a disciple of Mencius from Qi.\nHe saw Mencius speak of resolve first, then qi.\nThus he asked:\n*\"If so, then focusing solely on resolve suffices.\"*\nAgain he asked:\n*\"Why must one not exhaust qi?\"*\nMencius replied:\n*\"When resolve is singular, it moves qi.\n**Annotation:** *Singular* means unified.\n*Shuffling* means stumbling.\n*Hurrying* means rushing.\nMencius said that when resolve is directed with singularity,\nqi follows inevitably.\nYet when qi is concentrated in one direction,\nresolve itself is moved in turn—\nas when a person stumbles or rushes,\nqi is fixed upon that action,\nand the mind is disturbed in return.\nThus one must hold firm to resolve\nwhile ensuring qi is not exhausted.\"*\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"To wail all day yet the throat unsore—\nthis is the pinnacle of harmony.\"*\n\nQuoted from the original text of *Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Virtue*.\nSū’s annotation:\n*\"When the heart stirs, qi is injured.\nWhen qi is injured, the throat grows sore.\nTo wail all day yet the throat unsore—\nthis proves the heart undisturbed and qi in harmony.\"*\n\n**Could governance of the people and the realm be without action?**\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\n*\"Cultivate within yourself, and virtue becomes genuine.\nCultivate for the world, and virtue becomes universal.\"*\n\nQuoted from *Bìxū Zhēnrén’s* *Subtle Gatherings*:\n*\"Nearly applied to the self, yet extending far to the world.\"*\nTo cultivate the Dao within the body—\nfew thoughts, few desires—\nextends life and strengthens vitality,\nwhile all falsehoods are exhausted.\n\nSū’s elucidation:\n*\"Once the self is cultivated,\nits virtue naturally extends outward,\neven to governing the world.\"*\n\n**Could the opening and closing of the Celestial Gate be without duality?**\n\n**Explanatory Elucidation:**\nThe *Celestial Gate* is the gate of Nature.\nNature gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nQuoted from *Zhuangzi’s* *\"Gēngsāng Chú\"*:\nGuo Xiang’s annotation:\n*\"The Celestial Gate is the name of the origin of all things.\nIt is called the Celestial Gate.\nIt is also called the Gate of All Marvels.\"*\nChéng Fashi said:\n*\"Heaven is the name of Nature.\nThe principles of creation and transformation,\nthough

In the Xia, they were the Yu-Long Clan—this refers to Liu Lei. See the account in Duke Zhao’s Twenty-Ninth Year. In the Shang, they were the Shi-Wei Clan—Shi-Wei was the name of a state. Southeast of Bai-Ma County in Dong Commandery lies Wei City. In the Zhou, they were the Tang-Du Clan—Tang and Du were two states. At the end of the Yin, the Shi-Wei State was moved to Tang, and Duke Cheng of Zhou destroyed Tang, relocating them to Du, where they became Duke Bu of Du. Duke Bu’s son, Yi Shu, fled to Jin, and four generations later, Shi Hui received a fief in Fan, restoring the Fan Clan. Du is now Du County in Jingzhao Commandery. The Jin ruler made Fan the host of the Summer Alliance—this is what is meant, is it not?\"*\n\nMu Shu replied:\n*\"From what I’ve heard, this is called ‘hereditary rank,’ not ‘not perishing.’ Ru had a former minister named Zang Wen Zhong. After his death, his words endured—this is what is meant, is it not?\"*\n\nI have heard that the Most Exalted Dao/Way establishes virtue; the next level establishes deeds; the next establishes words. Historians like Shi Yi, Zhou Ren, and Zang Wen Zhong—though time passes, they are not forgotten. This is what is meant by ‘not perishing.’ As for preserving one’s lineage and surname, guarding ancestral altars, and ensuring one’s descendants never perish—no state lacks this. The greatest of ranks cannot be called ‘not perishing.’\"\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Heaven and Earth Chapter*:\n*\"In the age of supreme virtue, no one is praised for talent, no one is employed for skill. Above, like a tree branch; below, like wild deer.\"*\n\n**Explanation:**\n*\"Above, since there is no governance, below, all are pure and natural—like wild deer, free from royal rites.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*Zhuangzi said:*\n*\"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—then the world begins to doubt.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Horsefoot Chapter*:\n*\"When it comes to the Sage, to force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—these are the appearances of exerting effort for benevolence and righteousness. To force oneself for benevolence, to strain for righteousness—both are the outward forms of contriving benevolence and righteousness.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"Yao’s benevolence was like the heavens; those who approached him were like the sun. Shun had a fragrant virtue, and the people rejoiced in him. Thus, he moved his capital three times to Chengdu, and when he reached Deng’s ruins, ten thousand families followed him.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Zhuangzi, Xu Wu Gui Chapter*:\n*\"Shun, in humble attire, wandered through Kang Qu. He heard children singing:*\n*'Establish the people, do not deviate from your utmost!*\n*Unknowing and unthinking,*\n*Follow the Way of the Sovereign.’*\n*‘Cheng’ means ‘the many.’*\n*He who makes all things reach their utmost*\n*does not violate their natural dispositions.*\n*If one governs by knowledge and understanding,*\n*how could this be in accord with the Dao of Heaven?’\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"The people’s songs praised Shun.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Mencius, Chapter on Wan Zhang (Upper)*:\nMencius answered Wan Zhang:\n*\"Shun served Yao for twenty-eight years—this was not something a man could do alone; it was Heaven’s will. When Yao died, after three years of mourning, Shun moved Yao’s son to the south of the Nan River. The feudal lords who came to pay homage did not go to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who had disputes did not bring them to Yao’s son but to Shun. Those who sang praises did not sing of Yao’s son but of Shun. Hence, it was Heaven’s will.\"*\n\n*The Nan River is in the southern part of Ji Province, also in Yu Province. ‘Disputes’ refers to unresolved legal cases.*\n\nThe next level is to be feared and scorned.\nWhen trust is insufficient, distrust arises.\n\n**Extended Meaning Annotation:**\n*\"When the Shang made oaths, the people began to rebel. When the Zhou held alliances, the people began to doubt.\"*\n\nQuoting from *The Spring and Autumn Annals, Duke Zhao’s Fourth Year*:\n*\"The Duke of Chu, Ling Wang, assembled the feudal lords at Shen.

Shang Zhou held the search at Li—Zhou hunted in the eastern Yi state of Li—and the Yi people rebelled. Zhou You held the alliance at Da Shi—the central peak—and the barbarians rebelled against Zhou. Because of this, they rebelled against Zhou. All these were meant to show extravagance and excess to the feudal lords.

Alas, the excesses of the sages!\n\nAmong kin, discord arises, yet there is filial piety and kindness.\nIn a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge.\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n*The Classic of Rites* states: *\"When the **Dao** prevails, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children.\"*\n\n*Quoted from* *The Classic of Rites* (□ *The Great Plan of Sacrifice [Lǐ Yùn]*):\n\n*\"When the **Dao** prevails, the world is held in common. The worthy and capable are selected, trust is cultivated, and harmony is fostered. Thus, one does not love only one’s own parents, nor cherish only one’s own children. The aged have a place to end their days, the strong have useful labor, the young have nurturing, and the widowed, orphaned, disabled, and infirm all receive sustenance.\"*\n\nAgain, citing filial piety and kindness.\n\n*The Analects*: Duke Kāng of Zhōu asked: *\"How can one govern the people so that they are respectful, loyal, and encouraged?\"* The Master replied: *\"Rule them with solemnity, and they will be respectful. Be filial and kind, and they will be loyal.\"* Filial to one’s parents, kind to the multitude.\n\n*The Erya* states: *\"To serve one’s parents well is called filial piety.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nMinisters who gouge out eyes and split open hearts.\n\n*Quoted from* *Records of the Grand Historian* (□ *The Annals of the Shang Dynasty [Yīn Běn Jì]*):\n\n*\"Zhòu Xīn (King Zhòu) was unrighteous, and the world called him **Jiè** (the Tyrant).\"* **Jiè** refers to one who violates laws, destroys righteousness, and harms the good.\n\nKing **Jiè**’s debauchery knew no end. **Mǐzǐ** repeatedly admonished him but was ignored, so he fled with the Grand Music Master and the Minor Music Master. **Bǐ Gān**, the king’s son, said: *\"As a subject, one cannot fail to contend to the death.\"* He then forcibly admonished **Jiè**.\n\n**Jiè** raged: *\"I have heard that sages have seven orifices in their hearts. Let us dissect **Bǐ Gān** to see!\"*\n\n*The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Thief and the Ruined Wall [Tóu Huàn]*) states:\n*\"**Bǐ Gān**’s heart was split open, **Wú Zǔ**’s eyes were gouged out—these were the calamities of loyalty.\"*\n\nThese are ministers who gouge eyes and split hearts, whose loyalty and righteous death only manifest when the ruler is corrupt. Hence, *\"In a chaotic state, loyal ministers emerge.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n**Gǔsōu** was obstinate, yet **Shùn** was called the Great Filial Son.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Book of Documents* (□ *The Record of Yáo [Yáo Diǎn]*):\n\n*\"The blind father, the obstinate mother, the arrogant brother—yet he harmonized them all. With filial piety unceasing, he did not tolerate evil. This was the Great Filial Son.\"*\n\n*The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Wàn Zhāng [Wàn Zhāng Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):\n\n*\"The truly filial serve their parents with reverence all their lives. At fifty, I saw such filial piety in the Great **Shùn**.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\n**Zēng Zhì** was stern, yet **Zēng Shēn** was praised for nurturing.\n\n*Quoted from* *The Mencius* (□ *The First Chapter of Lí Lóu [Lí Lóu Zhāng Jù Shàng]*):\n\n*\"When **Zēng Shēn** cared for **Zēng Zhì**, he always ensured there was wine and meat. When serving, he would ask who to give the leftovers to. If there were any remaining, he would say, ‘There is.’ Thus, **Zēng Shēn** could be said to nurture his **virtue/power**.\"*\n\nTo serve one’s parents as **Zēng Shēn** did—this is acceptable.\n\n---\n**Chapter XIX: Discarding the Sage, Abandoning Wisdom**\n\n**Extended Meaning**:\nZhuangzi said: *\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom, to release and unite thieves and robbers—then the world begins to flourish.\"*\n\n*Quoted from* *The Zhuangzi* (□ *The Winnowing Basket [Zhuàn Kuāng]*):\n\n*\"To strike down sagehood and wisdom.\"*\n\n*Commentary*: *\"Strike down\"* means to criticize and reject.

When summoned for military service, he would roll up his sleeves and stand among the soldiers. When the state demanded labor, he would feign illness to avoid work. When the state gave grain to the sick, he would accept three *zhòng* (a measure) of six *shǐ* (a smaller measure) and four *dòu* (a still smaller measure), along with ten bundles of firewood.

If one guards the spirit without loss, this is the Way. But once the sheep is lost in wandering paths, it cannot be recovered. Only by guarding the spirit—neither losing nor gaining—does one attain non-dependence. The same applies to excessive adherence to benevolence and righteousness.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"Gēngsāngzǐ said: 'If ten thousand men each draw their bows to shoot at a single hawk, the hawk cannot escape being struck.'\"*\n**Annotation from *Lièzǐ* (清神第一):**\n*\"How can one sorrow or rejoice in turn without disturbing the true nature? Much less can the myriad things, in their multitude, uplift and agitate the heart and spirit! Thus, if ten thousand men bend their bows toward a single hawk, how could the hawk escape being struck? This speaks of the hawk as a cunning bird, and all men turn their arrows upon it. It is a metaphor for the heart’s myriad distractions—when emotions surge and the mind is tossed, it is like that hawk pierced by stillness. When the myriad things dazzle and confuse, how could life remain unharmed?\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"Only water approaches the Way: flowing east or west, yet nothing can harm it.\"*\n\n**Annotation from *Mèngzǐ* (告子章句上):**\n*\"Gào Zǐ said: 'Human nature is like a rushing stream—if released toward the east, it flows east; if released toward the west, it flows west.'\"*\n*\"This speaks of water’s nature: it follows downward, benefits all things without contention, and thus nothing harms it. Therefore, the sage embraces unity as the model for all under heaven. Not seeing himself, he becomes bright. Not asserting himself, he becomes manifest. Not boasting of himself, he achieves deeds. Not vaunting himself, he endures.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** *\"Yú Shùn had four eyes.\"*\n\n**Annotation from *Shàngshū* (舜典):**\n*\"On the first day of the first month, Shùn paid homage at the ancestral temple, consulted the Four Yù (regional officials), opened the four gates, and illuminated the four senses.

Yet to indulge in deformity, to cling like a parasitic growth or a pendulous wart—these too are born of form, yet to indulge in excess beyond nature.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: *The Undifferentiated Whole***\nThere exists an undifferentiated whole that arose before Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted;\nit lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not profound;\nit arises before Heaven and Earth yet is not enduring;\nit endures beyond the ancient past yet is not aged.\"*\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*—**《大宗师》**—it is said:\n*\"The Dao precedes the Supreme Ultimate yet is not exalted;\nit lies beneath the Six Extremes yet is not profound;\nit arises before Heaven and Earth yet is not enduring;\nit endures beyond the ancient past yet is not aged.\"*\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe *Supreme Ultimate* (太极) refers to the Five Qi (五气).\nThe *Six Extremes* (六极) are the Six Directions (六合).\nYet the Dao, above the Five Qi, is not distant;\nbeneath the Six Directions, it is not abyssal;\nbefore Heaven and Earth, it is not eternal;\nenduring beyond the ancient past, it is not aged.\nIt is said that the Dao is neither high nor deep, neither long nor old—\nthus, the Dao is everywhere, yet in all places, it is nowhere.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nThis is what the *Yijing*—**《系辞》**—refers to as the *Supreme Ultimate*.\nIt is said:\n*\"Thus, the *Yijing* has the Supreme Ultimate,\nwhich generates the Two Complements,\nthe Two Complements generate the Four Symbols,\nthe Four Symbols generate the Eight Trigrams.\"*\n\n**Annotation:**\n*\"What exists must begin with the nonexistent,\nthus the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Complements.\nThe Supreme Ultimate is the nameless name—\nyet it can be named, taking its extreme from what has,\nthus it is called the Supreme Ultimate.\"*\n\nThe Four Symbols are Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire.\nSilent and boundless, it stands alone yet never changes,\ncirculates endlessly yet never falters—\nit can be the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nEven form and shadow depend on each other,\nyet this is called *self-so* (独化).\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*—**《齐物论》**—it is said:\n*\"Wángliǎng asked his shadow:\n'Just now, you walked; now you stand.\nJust now, you sat; now you rise.\nWhy do you lack consistency?'\n\nThe shadow replied:\n'Do I depend on something to be thus?\nWhat I depend on also depends on something to be thus.\nDo I depend on the serpent’s scales or the cicada’s wings?\nHow would I know why it is so?\nHow would I know why it is not?'\n\nGuó Xiāng’s annotation says:\n'If it depended on the serpent’s scales or the cicada’s wings,\nthen the reason for its lack of consistency would not be difficult to discern.\nBut since it does not depend on such things and yet transforms alone,\nthis is why it is said.'\n\nThus, the extended meaning takes this to illustrate\nthat which stands alone yet never changes.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nWhen gathered, it is the essence of pure substance,\nhidden within millet grains.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*\"Millet grains\"* are the words from *The Scripture on Nourishing Life* (*Dù Rén Jīng*).\nXué Yōuxī’s annotation says:\n*\"Millet grains are the first of the five grains.\nRice is the foundation of human life—\nthus, the saying that one who attains the Dao\nhas the resources of the Way spread throughout the cosmos,\nyet even in its smallest form, it is hidden within millet grains.\nThis illustrates that the Dao encompasses all without burdening existence—\nhow then could there be any danger or peril?\nThus it is said: it circulates endlessly yet never falters.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nIt flows through the Six Void Directions,\nits applications inexhaustible.\n\nFrom the *Yijing*—**《下系辞》**—it is said:\n*\"The *Yijing* as a book cannot be distant;\nthe Way it describes is ever-shifting.\nIt does not remain fixed, flowing through the Six Void Directions,\nabove and below without constancy,\nthe strong and weak transforming—\nit cannot be codified as a fixed standard,\nonly adapting to change.\nThis is how the great Dao, as the One Qi,\ncirculates through the six lines,\nextending throughout Heaven and Earth,\nin all four directions, above and below—\nits applications are inexhaustible,\nthus it is said: it circulates endlessly yet never falters.\"*\n\nI do not know its name—\nI call it *Dao*.\nIf I must name it, I call it *Great*.\nGreat is *Passing*;\nPassing is *Distant*;\nDistant is *Returning*.\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*\"Name\"* (名) refers to its *virtue/power*;\n*\"Character\"* (字) refers to its *essence*.\nFrom *Du Tian Shi’s* *Broad Explication of Sacred Meaning* (*Guang Shèng Yì*) it is said:\n*\"To name a thing is to define its essence;\nto characterize a thing is to define its virtue/power.\nWhen a thing is born, its name is established—\nthis is the norm.\nThere has never been a thing without a name.\"*\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan of Lu, sixth year, ninth month, *Dingmǎo*, Prince Zǐtóng was born.\nThe Duke asked Shēn Rú for a name.\nShēn Rú replied:\n*\"Names have five categories:\n*Trustworthy* (信), *Virtuous* (义), *Symbolic* (象), *Borrowed* (假), and *Resemblance* (类).\nTo name based on birth is trustworthy—\nlike Táng Chú Yú or Lǔ Gōngzǐ Yǒu.\nTo name based on virtue is virtuous—\nlike Wén Wáng Chāng or Wǔ Wáng Fā.\nTo name based on resemblance is symbolic—\nlike Kǒngzǐ’s *Xiàng* (象) and *Níqiú Shān* (尼丘山).\nTo borrow from things is borrowed—\nlike Bó Yú’s birth, when someone presented fish,\nso he was named *Lǐ* (鲤, ‘carp’).\nTo take from the father is resemblance—\nlike Zǐtóng’s birth, born on the same day as his father.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\nBefore Heaven and Earth arose, it is difficult to speak of its lineage.\n\n**Annotation:**\n*\"Lineage\"* (氏族) is from the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke Huan’s eighth year, winter—\nPrince Wúhài died, and Prince Yǔfù’s father requested a posthumous title from the clan.\nThe Duke asked Zhòng Zhōng about the clan.\nZhòng Zhōng replied:\n*\"The Son of Heaven establishes virtue,\ngrants a surname based on birth,\nand bestows a clan name with land,\nthus naming the lineage.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The feudal lords took their ancestral fathers’ posthumous titles as surnames, and from these surnames came the clans. If an official had meritorious service passed down through generations, then there were official clans—meaning they took the old offices and old domains as their clans.\n\nDomains were also so named.

The inner and outer winds of the transcendent had fully awakened in me.*\n\n*Then my eyes became like ears, ears like nose, nose like mouth—no distinction between them. My mind concentrated, my form released, my bones and flesh dissolved into oneness, and I no longer knew where my body leaned or my feet trod. I drifted east and west with the wind, like a dry leaf or empty husk, utterly unaware whether the wind rode me or I rode the wind.*\n\n*Now you dwell at your Master’s doorstep, not even completing the minimal span of time, yet you resent and grumble repeatedly. Your slightest part will be abandoned by qi, your smallest node will be cast off by the earth. How can you hope to walk upon the void and ride the wind?*\n\nYǐn Shēng was deeply ashamed, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.\n\n*If Lìzǐ and Lǎoshāngshì could truly be called those who forget their teachers and their teachings, then today I take this to prove the meaning of not valuing one’s teacher and not cherishing one’s teachings.*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*Confucius, upon seeing Tàigōng Rèn, then abandoned his disciples and renounced his associations.*\n\nQuoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *\"Shānmù\"* [山木篇]:\n*Confucius was trapped between Chén and Cài, seven days without food. Tàigōng Rèn went to comfort him and said: \"Master, are you near death?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" \"Do you dislike death?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Tàigōng Rèn said: \"You have spoken of the way of not dying. In the Eastern Sea, there is a bird called Yìdài. Its appearance is drooping and sluggish, unable to soar high. Yet it seems powerless, yet it rises with a gentle push and rests in the shelter of others, never daring to lead when advancing, nor lag when retreating, never daring to taste first when feeding—it must wait for the remnants. Thus, its movements are never singled out, and it blends with the crowd. Yet outsiders can never harm it, so it avoids calamity. Straight trees are cut first, sweet wells are drained first. Your cleverness deceives the ignorant, your polished conduct reveals the filthy—your brilliance is like displaying the sun and moon in daylight, so you cannot escape misfortune.\"*\n\n*I once heard from a Great Achiever say: \"Those who boast of their own merits have no true merit. When merit is attained, it is lost. When fame is gained, it is diminished. Who can abandon merit and fame and return to the common folk? The Dao flows without claiming residence, virtue acts without seeking recognition—pure and constant, this is the way of the mad. They discard their traces and abandon their influence, not striving for merit or fame. Thus, they bear no blame from others, nor do others blame them. The Perfect Ones are unheard of. Why do you take such joy in this?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"Excellent! To renounce one’s associations and abandon one’s disciples, to flee to the Great Marsh, wearing coarse hemp garments, eating acorns and chestnuts, entering the realm of beasts without disturbing their order, entering the realm of birds without disrupting their flight—if beasts and birds do not harm them, how much more so will humans?\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*The Seven Saints were all lost in confusion, with nowhere to inquire about the Dao.*\n\nQuoted from *Zhuāngzǐ*’s *\"Xúwúguǐ\"* [徐无鬼篇]:\n*Huángdì was about to meet Dàwěi at Jùcí Mountain. Fāngmíng acted as charioteer, Chāngyú as the companion riding beside the chariot, Zhāng Ruò and Zhōu Yǐn as the leading horses. Kūn Hūn and Huá Gǔ served as rear attendants. When they reached the wilderness of Xiāngchéng, the Seven Saints were all lost in confusion. Today, your state has a Xiāngchéng County, located south of Tàiyǐ Mountain—this is where Huángdì sought the Dao.*\n\n*From Huángdì onward, including Huá Gǔ, there were a total of seven such Saints.*\n\nAnnotation: *Saints—this is a title. Once names arise, the Way is lost.*\n\n*Even if you desire it, Dàwěi is beyond reach. Nowhere to inquire about the Dao.*\n\n*They encountered a young boy tending horses, and asked him about the Way. The boy was a Daoist.*\n\n*\"Do you know of Jùcí Mountain?\"* The boy replied: *\"Yes.\"* *\"Do you know where Dàwěi resides?\"* The boy replied: *\"Yes.\"*\n\nHuángdì said: *\"Strange, little boy! Not only do you know of Jùcí Mountain, but you also know where Dàwěi resides. May I ask you about governing the world?\"*\n\nThe boy said: *\"Governing the world is no different from this! What more is there to do?*\n\n*Knowing its grandeur yet guarding its humiliation—this is the way to govern the world.*\n\n*To govern the world by guarding its humiliation, one’s constant virtue is then sufficient, returning to simplicity.*\n\n**Extended Meaning:**\n*Grass and trees flourish as honor. Quoted from the* **Zhōuyǐ** [周易] *Būn* [坤] *Hexagram’s text:*\n\n*\"Heaven and Earth undergo transformations, and grass and trees flourish. Heaven and Earth close in, and the virtuous withdraw.\"*\n\n*Kǒng Yǐngdá’s* **Zhèngyì** [正义] *states:*\n\n*\"This passage explains the six lines: Heaven and Earth undergo transformations refers to the interaction of yin and yang, nurturing all things, so grass and trees flourish.

      "translated_text": "The *Yan Yi* states: *\"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed—thorny thickets spring up.\"* The annotation reads: *\"Fields lie fallow, stones exposed\"*—this is from the *Zhuangzi*’s [*Fisherman*] chapter: *\"When officials attend to their duties and people worry over their affairs, then none overstep their bounds. Thus fields lie fallow, stones are exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes and levies go unpaid, wives and concubines are discordant, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the woes of the common folk.\"* This clearly shows that after great armies pass, farmers lose their livelihoods, fields become overgrown with thorny thickets, and years of famine are sure to follow.\n\nThus, the virtuous act decisively but do not seek strength through it. Act decisively yet take no pride, act decisively yet boast not, act decisively yet grow not arrogant—when action is unavoidable, this is acting decisively without seeking strength.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"Since the Sage drew the trigrams, bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world.\"* This is quoted from the *Zhouyi’s* [*Lower Appendices*]. *\"Bending wood into bows and shaping wood into arrows, the sharpness of bows and arrows was used to awe the world\"*—this is derived from *Kui* [Divergence]. *Kui* means \"contrariety.\" When things are contrary, disputes arise, and the use of bows and arrows is to awe and suppress such disputes. This was the Sage’s reluctant resort to force, demonstrating his awe—not that he delighted in killing.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"Gengsangzi said: The origin of war began with the first appearance of humankind.\"* He also said: *\"If there were a throat medicine that could kill, one should not ban all physicians in the world.\"* As for warfare, it cannot be abolished in the world. Those who govern with the Dao as their assistant should uphold the yielding and tranquil, not rely on force to dominate the world. If attacked by an enemy and forced to respond, then it is called skillful use of arms. This is quoted from the *Kangcangzi’s* [*On Military Strategy*] chapter. Now, these are taken as evidence: though war cannot be abolished, one must not rely on it, warning against using force to dominate the world.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"The Spring and Autumn Annals says: Killing the enemy is decisive.\"* The annotation reads: *\"In the second year of Duke Huan of Lu, Spring, the Spring and Autumn Annals records that the Marquis Gui of Zheng, having received his orders from Chu, attacked Song. Hua Yuan of Song, leading the armies of Le and Ju, confronted them. On the 12th day of the second month, they clashed at Da Ji, and the Song forces were routed. Hua Yuan was captured, and his capture was made known to demonstrate his survival. They seized Le and Ju’s commander, Hua Yuan, along with 460 chariots and 250 captives, and cut off the heads of 100 others. The Song minister Kuang Jiao welcomed the Zheng forces, but the Zheng soldiers threw him into a well. Kuang Jiao was a Song minister. They overturned their spears to rescue him, capturing Kuang Jiao instead. The sage said: ‘He violated protocol and disobeyed orders—it was fitting that he be taken prisoner.’ In warfare, the display of decisive resolve and attentive listening is called ‘protocol.’ Listening means keeping orders constantly in mind, internalizing them, and imagining their implementation. Killing the enemy is decisive; achieving decisiveness is resolute. If one reverses this, one will surely be punished. Reversing it is punishment. Before the battle, Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to feed the soldiers, but his charioteer, Yang Zhen, refused to partake. In battle, Yang Zhen said: ‘Yesterday’s sheep was yours to command; today’s matter is mine to command.’ He fought against the Zheng forces, and thus their army was defeated. The sage said: ‘Yang Zhen was not a true man. Out of personal resentment, he caused the nation’s treasures to be exhausted.’ What greater crime is there than this? The *Shijing* speaks of ‘the unvirtuous among men’—taking from the *Small Odes*, it refers to how unvirtuous men blame one another and bring ruin. This was Yang Zhen’s case. Thus, killing the enemy is decisive, meaning to stop the enemy. When war is unavoidable, it is used to stop the enemy, so that they no longer become raiders—hence, ‘not daring to seek strength through it.’\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"After Tang conquered Xia, he spoke of his temporary virtue.\"* The annotation reads: *\"From the Shang Book’s* [*Commissioner Zhi’s Instructions to Tang*]. Tang exiled Jie to Nan Chao, a place named ‘Only Shameful Virtue.’ He said: ‘I fear that future generations will use this as grounds for criticism.’ Though Tang followed Heaven and responded to the people, having inherited the succession from Yao, Shun, and Yu, he still felt uneasy in his heart, ashamed that his virtue did not match the ancients, as if fearing that the world would later use this as grounds for criticism.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"When returning to Bo, he had the fear of standing at the brink.\"* The annotation reads: *\"Tang’s Speech.\"* The king, having conquered Xia, returned to Bo and proclaimed his intentions to all under Heaven. Bo was Tang’s capital, located in Gu Shu County of Song Prefecture. He said: *\"Let me, as one man, unite and pacify this land—thus securing my state. But I fear I have not yet measured up to the expectations of Heaven and Earth, trembling with dread as if about to fall into a deep abyss.\"* Heaven entrusted me to unite and pacify this land, but the weight of this responsibility is so great that I fear I am unworthy. I do not yet know if I have offended Heaven and Earth, and I am filled with terror, as if standing at the brink of a deep abyss.\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"In the Spring and Autumn period, Wu had once defeated Yue but harbored contempt for Chu.\"* This is detailed in the *Spring and Autumn* annotations and need not be repeated. *\"When things flourish, they decline—this is called ‘not the Way.’ The un-Way perishes early.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* states: *\"The Way exists before the ancient sages but is not called ‘first.’\"* This is quoted from the *Zhuangzi’s* [*Master of the Heavenly Pattern*] chapter. *\"Before the Great Ultimate, it was not called ‘high’; beneath the six extremes and six unities, it was not called ‘deep’; before Heaven and Earth came into being, it was not called ‘long-lasting’; enduring beyond the ancient sages, it was not called ‘old.’\"* This speaks of the Way being everywhere yet nowhere, its presence everywhere yet its essence nowhere.

      "translated_text": "The *Yan Yi* states: *\"The gentleman values the left when at home but the right when wielding arms. Arms are an ill-omened instrument, not the tool of the gentleman; when unavoidable, they are used with equanimity as the highest principle.\"*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"When barbarians and Yi tribesmen [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples] act deceitfully against the Xia—when raiders or violent bandits prey upon others—this is quoted from the *Shun’s Appointments* chapter. The Emperor Shun commanded Gao Yao: ‘Barbarians and Yi tribesmen act deceitfully against the Xia; raiders are called *kòu*, bandits *zéi*, the treacherous are *jiān*, and those who sow internal discord are *niè*. You shall be the *shì* [officer], overseeing the administration of punishments. The five punishments must be meted out with due deliberation, and the five stages of exile must be justly applied. Only the enlightened can truly fulfill this.’ This speaks of Shun’s command to Gao Yao as the *shì*, where the barbarians and Yi tribesmen, the *Róng* and *Dì* [or ‘uncivilized’ peoples], sow chaos within the central Xia, harming the common folk. You, as the *shì*, must govern and resolve these matters, ensuring your wisdom and discernment are unerring so that punishments fit the crimes and all submit without doubt. The five stages of exile refer to the severity of the crime, while the ‘three applications’ are interpreted by Confucius as: the greatest crimes are punished in the open fields, lesser ones by the great ministers in the court, and the smallest by the officers in the marketplace. The five degrees of exile denote those deserving leniency, yet their dwellings are still classified into three ranks—just as the five grades of nobility are divided into three tiers. Though the use of arms and warfare may be unavoidable, the gentleman acts only when compelled, hence the saying: ‘The gentleman of the Dao uses arms only when he has no choice.’*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates further: *\"To conquer and settle chaos and violence is the proper use of arms. To prevail in battle is called ‘conquest’ (*kè*), to inflict harm on others is ‘calamity’ (*huò*), and to act contrary to virtue, spreading confusion, is ‘disorder’ (*luàn*). This is quoted from: ‘To conquer and settle chaos’—this is how Jiāng Zǐyá [Maizi of Qi] of the Jiāng clan, fishing at the Pán River, split a fish and found a jade pendant within, inscribed with this text, titled *The Six Taos* (*Liù Táowéi*). The first is the *Wén Táowéi* [‘Cultural Tao’], adhering to the Dao of the state without transgressing Heaven’s natural order. The second is the *Wǔ Táowéi* [‘Martial Tao’], conquering chaos and subduing the eight directions with might. The third is the *Lóng Táowéi* [‘Dragon Tao’], harmonizing yin and yang without overstepping seasonal command. The fourth is the *Hǔ Táowéi* [‘Tiger Tao’], skillfully employing claws and fangs to crush the wicked. The fifth is the *Bào Táowéi* [‘Leopard Tao’], seizing opportunities to quell disasters with wisdom rooted in strategy and timing. The sixth is the *Quǎn Táowéi* [‘Hound Tao’], probing the subtlest intelligence or achieving unexpected feats through reconnaissance. *Táo* means ‘to conceal’—the arts of warfare and stratagem must not be lightly revealed to others, hence the term ‘concealed Tao.’*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"This is not for the sake of coveting land or wealth. This is quoted from the time of Emperor Xuān of the Han Dynasty, when Wèi Xián served as Chancellor. During the *Yuán Kāng* era, the Xiongnu sent troops to attack the Han, encroaching upon their cultivated fields. The military commander could not repel them. The emperor consulted with General Zhōngguó Zhāng Zǐguó and others, intending to exploit the Xiongnu’s decline by sending troops to strike their right flank, preventing further harassment of the Western Regions. The chancellor submitted a memorial advising: ‘I have heard that armies raised to rescue chaos and punish tyranny are called *yìbīng* [‘righteous armies’], and armies of righteousness bring victory. When enemies attack us and we rise in response, this is called *yìngbīng* [‘retaliatory armies’], and armies that retaliate prevail. When one fights over petty grievances, unable to tolerate anger, this is called *fènbīng* [‘wrathful armies’], and armies born of wrath are defeated. When one seeks to seize another’s land or treasures, this is called *tān bīng* [‘greedy armies’], and greedy armies are destroyed. When one relies on the state’s power and the people’s numbers, desiring to display one’s might over enemies, this is called *jiāo bīng* [‘proud armies’], and proud armies perish. These five principles are not merely human affairs; they align with the *Xuán Tóng* [‘Mysterious Unity’], taken as evidence to prove their truth, and when unavoidable, they are the truth—yet one must not force them.’ The above aligns with the *Wénzǐ’s* [*Chapter on the Martial Dao*] section.*\n\nThe *Yan Yi* elaborates: *\"When Bái Gōng of Chu rebelled, his forces were subdued by the *jiā* [a penal measure], and Yí Liáo of Shì Nán [Market South] played with his balls, resolving the feud between the two families. Sūn Shū’áo [Chancellor of Chu] lay down with a feather fan, and the people of Yǐng [Chu capital] abandoned their rebellion. This is quoted from the *Xuánwúguǐ* [‘Spiritless Xuán’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how Yí Liáo of Shì Nán and Sūn Shū’áo both employed the un-Way of the Way and the unstated eloquence of the unstated to resolve the feuds of the two families. This may be called ‘victory without battle, equanimity as the highest principle.’ To relish in victory yet not take pride in it, while others praise it, is to delight in killing. Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their ambitions in the world. This is quoted from the *Liáng Huì Wáng* [‘Dialogues with King Liang of Huì’] chapter of the *Mencius*. Mencius saw King Xiāng of Liáng, the son of King Huì, named Hé. Upon leaving, he remarked: ‘Looking at him, he did not seem like a ruler; approaching him, I saw no one to fear. Suddenly, he asked: “How shall the world be settled?” I replied: “It is settled by unity.” Who can achieve unity? The king asked again, and I answered: “Those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity.” *Shì* means ‘to love’ or ‘to be fond of.’ Yet among those who shepherd the world, there are none who do not delight in killing. If there were someone who did not delight in killing, then the people of the world would all crane their necks, eagerly awaiting him. Truly so, the people would flock to him like water rushing downward, unstoppable.’ This is quoted from the *Lièzǐ* [‘Liezi’], where Zhào Xiāngzǐ dispatched his newly appointed officer Xīnzhì Mùzǐ to attack the Zhái [a tribe], and he emerged victorious. This is also quoted from the *Shuō Fú* [‘Discussing the Seal’] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*. Though these matters have been detailed elsewhere, I quote them here to illustrate how those who do not delight in killing can achieve unity.\"*",

The *Piān Jiāngjūn* [“Associate General”] is placed on the left, and the *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] on the right—this is explained through the *Sāng Lǐ* [“Funeral Rites”]. Quoted from: *‘Precedence on the left, precedence on the right’*—this is from the *Tán Qióng* [“The Dried Bamboo”] chapter of the *Lǐjì* [“Book of Rites”]. Its meaning has already been detailed elsewhere; no need to repeat it here.\n\nNow, if one were to take this as an analogy: suppose a valiant warrior achieves victory and earns distinction, rising to the rank of *Shàng Jiāngjūn* [“Commanding General”] and dwelling on the right to preside over killing—then it is said that victory is treated with the rites of mourning, and he is not worthy of elevation.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless.\n*Pǔ* [“uncarved wood”/“primordial simplicity”], though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.\n\n**Elaborating the Meaning:**\nThe talents of the world include those who can command the eyes through clarity, the ears through sharpness, the strength through valor, and the speech through eloquence. These are all named qualities, which the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity does not employ. Quoted from the *Zhòng Nǐ* [“Confucius”] chapter of the *Lièzǐ* [“Liezi”]:\nThe marshes of *Zhèng* [“Zheng”] were abundant with sages, and the *East Rì* [“East Village”] was rich with talents.\nAmong the marsh’s retainers was a man called *Bó Fēngzǐ* [“Master Bo Feng”], who, while passing through the East Village, encountered *Dèng Xī* [“Deng Xi”].\nDeng Xi glanced at his followers and laughed: *“You dance and prance to deceive that coming one, Master Bo Feng! What do you think of him?”*\nHis followers replied: *“We wish to know his reputation.”*\nDeng Xi was a renowned debater and sage of Zheng.\nHe asked Bo Fengzǐ: *“Do you understand the principle of nurturing?”*\n*“He who loves and nurtures others yet cannot nurture himself is but a dog or pig.”*\n*“To nurture things while they in turn serve you—that is the power of man.”*\n*“If you command your followers to eat until full, wear until at ease, and manage state affairs, then you are fulfilling the role of a governing official. Yet they gather in age groups, and you provide them with nothing more than prison cells, stables, and kitchens—what difference is there between you and a dog or pig?”*\nBo Fengzǐ did not respond.\nThen Bo Fengzǐ’s followers, one by one, stepped forward and said: *“Master, you have not heard of the abundance of skilled craftsmen in Qi and Lu? There are those who excel in earthwork and carpentry, those who excel in metalwork and leathercraft, those who excel in music and song, those who excel in arithmetic and record-keeping, those who excel in military strategy, and those who excel in temple rites—all talents are present. Yet none hold official rank, nor can they be properly employed. Those who place them in office lack knowledge, and those who employ them lack ability. Yet it is knowledge and ability that are needed to employ them. The officials are merely those we appoint; why do you boast?”*\nDeng Xi had no reply, and he fixed his gaze upon his followers before departing.\nThis illustrates how those with knowledge, talent, and ability are employed by those without—how can they be held in esteem?\n\nThus, those who embrace the Dao/Way of nameless simplicity do not flaunt their reputation or display their talents. They remain obscure and silent, wandering freely through the world, and none dare employ them. When ordinary men see such individuals, they do not need words to explain—merely by observing them, the Dao/Way is preserved. All things naturally submit and follow their transformation.\nHence, the Classic states:\n*The Dao/Way is ever nameless.\nUncarved wood, though humble, yet the world dares not subjugate it.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it, all things would naturally submit in reverence.*\n\n**Elaborating the Meaning:**\nEven dust and chaff can mold the *Yáo Shùn* [“Emperors Yao and Shun”].\nQuoted from the *Xiāoyáo Yóu* [“Free and Easy Wandering”] chapter of the *Zhuangzi*:\n*“When the great flood submerged the heavens, they did not drown. In the great drought, metal and stone melted, mountains withered, yet they did not feel the heat.”*\nIt is their dust and chaff that could shape Yao and Shun—who would dare to treat such matters as their own?\n\n**Annotation:**\nYao and Shun are merely names of worldly affairs.\nThose who act for the sake of names are not true to the Dao/Way.\nThus, Yao and Shun are not merely Yao and Shun—they must embody the reality of the *Shénrén* [“Divine/Sage Person”].\nNow, what we call Yao and Shun are but labels for their dust and chaff.\n\n**End of the Eighth Scroll of *Mìo* [“Marvelous”] from *Yùjué Lì* [“Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’]**\n**End of the Ninth Scroll of *Yùjué Lì* [“Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’]\"]**",

The simplicity of black and white is not what makes them distinct. This is because black and white are naturally so.”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nWisdom lies in discerning the vice and virtue of others.\n\nQuoted from *Mèngzǐ* [“Master Meng”]:\n“What resides in people is nothing finer than their pupils. The pupils cannot conceal their evil. If the heart is upright, the pupils will be bright. If the heart is not upright, the pupils will be dull. Listen to their words and observe their pupils, and how can one deceive you? How can one hide from you? *Yù* [“hide”]. This means that a person’s vice and virtue are revealed in their pupils. When people interact with things, their spirit manifests in their eyes. Thus, if the heart is upright, the spirit will gather and the eyes will shine. If the heart is not upright, the spirit will scatter and the eyes will grow dim. By observing this, one cannot fail to see a person’s vice and virtue, good and evil. Hence it is said: *Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nYet they cannot see their own eyelashes.\n\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll of *Gēngsāng Chǔ* [“Elder Geng Sang”]**:\nLǎozi [Master Lao] said: “I once saw you as though you were my eyebrows and eyelashes, my hair and fur.” *Zhījiān* [“between”].\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThen again, one must know oneself.\n\nQuoted from the *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* [“Appendices of the *Book of Changes*”]:\n“Then again, one must know oneself”—meaning that if one can repeatedly reflect upon oneself, one will know one’s own gains and losses.\n\nThe one who overcomes others has strength; the one who overcomes themselves is powerful.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe way of constant victory.\n\nQuoted from the *Lièzǐ* [“Master Lie”]—**Scroll of *Huángdì* [“The Yellow Emperor”]**:\n“There is a way of constant victory in the world, and there is a way that is not constant. The way of constant victory is called *softness* [rǒu]; the way that is not constant is called *strength* [qiáng]. These two terms may also be read as *ease* [yì]. Yet people do not know this. Hence, the teachings of antiquity say: ‘The strong first do not act like the strong; the soft first act like the soft.’ Those who first do not act like the strong, when they reach the point of acting like the strong, are in danger.”\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nYì [Yi the Archer] excelled in archery, and Jīu [Jiutang] excelled in rowing boats, both relying on strength to overcome others. Yet neither attained their own death.\n\nQuoted from the *Lúnyǔ* [“Analects”]—**Scroll of *Xiànwèn* [“Conduct and Military Affairs”], Chapter Fourteen**:\nNángōng Shì [Nan Gongshi] asked Confucius: “If it were Nan Róng [Nan Rong], who would Yi the Archer and Jiutang overcome in boat rowing, both would not attain their natural end. Yi was the ruler of the state of *Yǒuyú Shì* [‘State of Youyu’], the most skilled archer of his time. He usurped the throne of *Tàikàng* [‘Great Kang’] of the Xia dynasty and established himself, but his minister *Hándí* [Han Ni] killed him and took his place. The *Chūnqiū Zhuàn* [“Transmissions of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*”] states that Jiutang was the son of *Jiāo Tìng* [‘Jiao Ting’], whose strength allowed him to row a boat across land. Later, he was killed by *Xiàhòu Shàokāng* [‘Xiahou Shaokang’].”\n\nYì and Jiutang were both powerful and violent figures of old, yet neither attained their natural end. Both relied on their strength not only to overcome others but also to fail in overcoming themselves—this is what Lǎozi [Master Lao] warned people against.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\n“To sit on gold and leather [*rèn jīn gé*], dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North.\n\nQuoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:\n“To sit on gold and leather, dying without regret”—this is the strength of the North. *Rèn* [“sitting on”], meaning a mat or a bedroll. *Jīn gé* [“gold and leather”] refers to weapons: *gold* [jīn] to spears and *leather* [gé] to armor. The North’s climate is harsh and resolute, so to conquer others with daring strength is considered *strength*—the deed of the strong.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Master [Confucius] spoke of “harmony without dissipation, steadfastness without leaning”—this is the power of *rectification* [jiāo].\n\nQuoted from *Zhōngyōng* [“The Doctrine of the Mean”], Chapter Ten:\n“The gentleman is harmonious without dissipation, powerful in his steadfastness!” *Jiāo* [“powerful”] is described in the *Shījīng* [“Book of Odes”] as: *“Jiāo jiāo wǔ fū”* [“Resolute, resolute, the martial man”]. *Lì* [“lean”] means partiality or bias. This is what is called the impossible feat of the *middle path* [zhōngyōng]. It is not because they cannot overcome themselves; rather, it is because their personal desires cannot choose and hold to virtue and righteousness. Where does the Master’s power lie? In this, the Master instructed Zǐlú [Zilu], suppressing his impulsive vigor and advancing him with the courage of virtue and righteousness.\n\nThe contented attain wealth; the resolute attain purpose.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nZhuāngzi said: “Zēngzǐ [Zengzi] dwelt in Wèi [Wei], wearing a patched hemp cloak with no lining.”\n\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi*—**Scroll",

This is the clear understanding of attaining eternal life.”*\nThis means: when a person dwells in the world between heaven and earth, if they rest in their innate nature, entrust themselves to the harmony of the Dao/Way, and come and go with the transformations of nature—then the noble man observes the actions of a person, and knows their longevity or brevity. How much more so for those who cultivate the Great Dao/Way and nourish the primordial *hé* [“harmony”], yet cannot attain eternal life?\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\n*“The body is like cicada shell or snake skin—it is merely shed and abandoned.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhuāngzi* [“*Zhuangzi*”]—**Scroll of Equalizing All Things** are the words:\nWàngliǎng [Wangliang] asked the *Yǐng* [“shadow”]. The shadow said: *“I await the snake’s shedding, its skin clinging beneath its belly, unable to move.”*\nIs it like cicada wings? If one awaits the snake’s shedding like cicada wings, then there is no particular purpose to cling to—thus one seeks endless blame, ultimately reaching ‘no awaiting’ and not uniquely transforming in the *Xuānmíng* [“Mysterious Darkness”].\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Great Dao/Way is Boundless**\nThe Great Dao/Way is boundless, yet it can be found on either side.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Dao/Way is supremely high and has no above; supremely deep and has no below. Above it, there is no above; below it, there is no below. It can be high and deep, can ascend and descend. Level as a carpenter’s rule, straight as a plumb line—yet not a rule to level, thus all is even; not a plumb line to straighten, thus all is upright.\nRound as a compass, square as a set-square—yet not round to make round, thus without roundness; not square to make square, thus without squareness. It envelops heaven and earth yet has no outer or inner; its greatness has no limits, its subtlety no depths.\nPiercing like an unfurling cover, yet nothing obstructs it. Great roundness without boundary, great passage without hindrance.\nThus, those who embody the Dao/Way do not grow angry nor rejoice. Their sitting is without care, their sleep without dreams—thus they are in perfect *Xuāntóng* [“Mysterious Harmony”].\nAs proof: the Dao/Way is vast and boundless, yet it can be found on either side.\n\n**Elaborations on the *Dàodé Zhēnjīng* [‘*Dao/Way and Virtue/Power Classic*’] say:**\nThe Great Dao/Way is nowhere not present—whether left or right, all encounter its source.\nQuoted from the *Mèngzǐ* [“*Mencius*”]—**Scroll of Leaving and Liao** [“*Leaving and Liao*”] says:\n*“The noble man deeply cultivates with the Dao/Way, seeking to attain it himself. Attaining it himself, he rests in it securely. Resting in it securely, his resources grow profound. His resources profound, he can take from it on either side and always find its source.”*\nThus, the noble man seeks to attain it himself.

      "translated_text": "「**Zhū Xī’s annotations:**\n*Cù*, to trample or tread upon. *Qǐrén*, the beggar. *Bùxiè*, not deeming it pure or worthy. Though the hunger is dire, yet he still abhors rudeness—there are those who would rather die than eat from such contempt. This shows that the innate sense of shame and disgust in all people is stronger than the fear of death.\n\nThis passage shares similar meaning with the refusal of food given with a sneer, hence its inclusion as evidence. It illustrates that hunger is a grave affliction for man, yet when food is offered without respect, even travelers would refuse it, let alone beg for it. This is the rejection of food due to insufficient courtesy.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nZhuangzi said: *“Righteousness and justice are but the guesthouses of ancient kings—one may lodge there for a night, but cannot dwell long.”*\nQuoted from the *Zhuangzi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Destiny**—\n*Schūlù*, guesthouses or inns. One cannot stay long.\n\nTo employ righteousness for universal love and justice to restrain wrongdoing—what is this but a temporary shelter, like lodging in an inn? It cannot be a lasting bond. The Daoist’s transformation of people is through the Way itself, enduring and tranquil. How could it be dispersed?\n\nThe Way’s expression is subtle, without taste. To look at it, one cannot see its form; to listen to it, one cannot hear its sound; to use it, one cannot exhaust its potential.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nLiezi said: *“The form that shapes the form is substantial, yet the shaping of forms is not always present.”*\nQuoted from the *Liezi*—**Chapter on Heaven’s Bountiful Grace**—\nThe meaning is already complete; no need to repeat it. This speaks of the efficacy of *wuwei* (non-action) aligning with the Way, its truth indeed boundless.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Principle of Inversion**\nWhen one would gather, one must first let loose.\nWhen one would weaken, one must first let grow strong.\nWhen one would discard, one must first let flourish.\nWhen one would take away, one must first give.\nThis is called *subtle illumination* (*wēimíng*).\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThe profound mysteries of the Sage are nowhere more exquisite than in the interplay of *power* (*quán*) and *substance* (*shí*).\nQuoted from the *Tang* annotation by **Du Tian Shi** (Du the Master of the Tang):\nThe Sage’s teachings are divided into two paths—*power* and *substance*. The superior scholar, with keen insight, grasps the true essence of *substance*. The mediocre or lesser scholar must be guided through the path of *power*.\n\nThe methods of *power* are vast and adaptable. Following the scriptures, four key principles are outlined:\n1. *“When one would gather, one must first let loose”*—this restrains the mind.\n2. *“When one would weaken, one must first let grow strong”*—this restrains the nature.\n3. *“When one would discard, one must first let flourish”*—this restrains desire.\n4. *“When one would take away, one must first give”*—this restrains greed.\n\nIf the mind is restrained in its extravagance, the Way becomes harmonious.\nIf the mind is unrestrained, excess arises.\nBy fostering excess, one invites error, then reflecting, one returns to restraint.\nThis is the *power* of gathering the mind.\n\nIf the nature is weak, virtue is preserved whole.\nIf the nature is strong, calamity ensues.\nBy fostering strength, one invites calamity, then reflecting, one returns to weakness.\nThis is the *power* of subduing the nature’s strength.\n\nIf desire is few, conduct remains pure.\nIf desire is many, the spirit becomes turbid.\nWhen desire deepens and turbidity reaches its extreme, one reflects and returns to purity.\nThis is the *power* of discarding desire and clarifying the spirit.\n\nIf one is not greedy, frugality prevails.\nIf greed is extreme, ruin befalls the body.\nBy fostering greed, one invites ruin, then reflecting, one returns to frugality.\nThis is the *power* of cultivating frugality to overcome greed.\n\nAll these methods first push to the utmost the unrestrained heart, so that it becomes entangled in avarice and desire, before guiding it back to its true nature and the Way.\n\nAt first glance, this may seem contrary to the principle of *wuwei* (self-transformation through non-action), but the nature varies in acuity, and enlightenment differs in gradual or sudden attainment. Those who attain sudden enlightenment need no guidance through *power*; those who progress gradually require skillful inducement. Thus arises the distinction between *power* and *substance*.\n\nThe Way and its teachings ultimately converge in great principle, hence it is said that *power* is precious in harmonizing meaning.\n\nThe petty man scorns *power*, and the Way is thereby accused of deceit. Hence, *power* cannot be lightly revealed to those who do not understand the Way.\n\nThe *Analects* say: *“One may be able to stand with [him], but not yet to employ *power* with [him].”* This speaks of the difficulty of using *power*.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThis is how the Sage knows that when one treads upon frost, the coming of solid ice is near.\nQuoted from the *Zhouyi*—**Hexagram *Kūn* (The Receptive)**—\n**Line One:** *Treading upon frost, solid ice comes.*\n\nThis refers to the subtle *yin* energy of the first line, like the beginning of cold, yet by gradually accumulating its presence, solid ice forms. Though the Way initially appears soft and yielding, its gradual accumulation leads to firmness and strength.\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nGōu Jiàn (勾践) sought to weaken the state of Wu, yet he urged them to attack Qi.\nQuoted from the *Shiji* (Records of the Grand Historian):\n**Confucius in Wei**, hearing that **Tiān Cháng** (田常) of Qi sought to create chaos, told his disciples: *“I cannot bear to see my ancestral homeland suffer at the hands of an enemy.”*",

This is the opportune moment to retaliate against him.\"*\n\nThe **Yue King** (越王) **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践) then sent his minister **Wén Zhǒng** (文种) to bow before the Wu King and say: *\"Yue offers all three thousand warriors within its borders to serve Wu.\"*\n\nThe Wu King accepted the **Yue King’s** terms, pardoned **Gōu Jiàn** (勾践), and allowed him to remain. He then mobilized his own troops to attack Qi and defeated them.\n\nZǐ Gòng then went north to see the **Jin Lord** (晋君). *\"Now that Qi is weakened, Wu and Jin shall meet at **Huáng Pó** (黄池).\"* The **Yue King** (越王) seized the opportunity to attack Wu (吴). The Wu King returned and fought against Yue, but was annihilated.\n\nThe **Master** (孔子) said: *\"If one could indeed disrupt Qi to save Lǚ, that was my initial wish. If they could further strengthen Jin to weaken Wu, and if Wu were to perish while Yue became hegemon—that was Zǐ Gòng’s strategy. Yet, ‘beautiful words harm sincerity; be cautious with speech.’\"*\n\n**Extended meaning:**\nThe **Qi King** (齐桓公) loved delicacies, and **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooked his own son to please him.\nThe **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him.\nThe **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians.\n\nQuoted from the *Huáinánzǐ*—**Section *Zhǔshù* (主术训)**—\nThe *Hóngliè Jiě* (鸿烈解) states: *\"The Qi King loved delicacies, and Yì Yá cooked his own son to please him.\"* According to the *Shiji*—**Qi Family History** (齐世家)—\nInitially, the **Qi King** (齐桓公) had three wives, yet none bore him children. He indulged in concubines, numbering six like his wives, with the eldest being **Wèi Jī** (卫姬), who bore **Wú Kuī** (无亏). The younger **Wèi Jī** bore **Huì Gōng** (惠公元). **Zhèng Jī** (郑姬) bore **Xiào Gōng** (孝公昭). **Gě Yíng** (葛嬴) bore **Zhāo Gōng** (昭公潘). **Mì Jī** (密姬) bore **Yì Gōng** (懿公商人). **Sòng Huá Zǐ** (宋华子), as **Jiá Qí** (贾逵) said, was the daughter of the **Sòng Huá** (宋华) clan, of the **Zǐ** (子) lineage, and bore **Gōng Zǐ Yōng** (公子雍). **Yōng** (雍) was the chief of the **Yōng** (雍) officials, who served at the **Master’s** (桓公) table. There were inner and outer **Yōng** officials, and this man was named **Chéng** (丞) for the **Yōng** (雍) office—**Yì Yá** (易牙) was he. Through the eunuch **Shù Dāo** (竖刁), he offered lavish gifts to the **Qi King**, gaining favor. The **Qi King** granted his request.\n\nOnce **Yì Yá** (易牙) gained the **Qi King’s** favor, he petitioned for the eldest **Wèi Jī** (卫姬) to establish **Wú Kuī** (无亏) as heir. **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) fell ill, and the **Qi King** asked: *\"Among my ministers, who is capable of succeeding you?\"* **Guān Zhòng** replied: *\"No one knows his subjects better than the ruler.\"* The **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Yì Yá** (易牙)?\"* He answered: *\"He killed his own son to please you—this is not human nature, and he cannot be trusted.\"* The **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Kāifāng** (开方)?\"* He answered: *\"He abandoned his own son, the crown prince of a thousand chariots, to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to approach.\"* **Kāifāng** (开方) was the **Qi King’s** son, who had removed the crown prince of a thousand chariots and submitted himself to his father.\n\nThe **Qi King** asked: *\"What of **Gōng Zǐ Shù Dāo** (公子竖刁)?\"* He answered: *\"He castrated himself to serve you—this is not human nature, and he is hard to trust.\"*\n\nWhen **Guān Zhòng** (管仲) died, the **Qi King** did not heed his warnings and ultimately relied on these three men. The three men held absolute power—this is what is meant by **Yì Yá** (易牙) cooking his own son to ingratiate himself with the **Qi King**.\n\nThe **Yu Lord** (虞君) loved treasures, and the **Jin King** (晋献公) used a **carriage of horses** (璧马) to lure him. According to the *Spring and Autumn Annals* (春秋), **Lí Gōng** (僖公) in the second year said:\n**Jìn Gǒu Xī** (晋苟息) requested to use the **carriage of horses** from **Qú** (屈产) and the **jewel of Chuí Jié** (垂棘) to borrow passage through **Yu** (虞) and attack **Huò** (虢). **Xún Xī** (荀息) was **Xún Shù** (荀叔). **Qú** (屈) produced fine horses, and **Chuí Jié** (垂棘) yielded beautiful jade—thus their names. Four horses make a **carriage** (乘). The path from Jin to Huò passed through Yu, so passage was requested.\n\nThe **Jin King** said: *\"These are my treasures.\"* **Xún Xī** replied: *\"If you gain passage through Yu, it is like possessing an outer granary.\"* The **Jin King** said: *\"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) remains there.\"* **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) was a loyal minister of Yu. **Xún Xī** replied: *\"**Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) is a weak man who cannot give strong advice. Moreover, he is younger than you, and you favor him. Even if he advises you, you will not listen.\"*\n\nThe **Jin King** did not heed **Míng Zhī Qí**’s warnings. He then borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò, and **Xún Xī** (荀息) offered rich gifts to win favor. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised against it, but was not listened to. Jin’s army then destroyed **Xià Yáng** (下阳).\n\nIn the fifth year, the **Jin King** again borrowed passage through Yu to attack Huò. **Míng Zhī Qí** (宫之奇) advised him: *\"Yu and Huò are neighbors. If Huò falls, Yu will surely follow. Jin cannot be provoked, nor can an enemy be trifled with. To do this once is already too much—how can it be done twice?\"* The proverb says: *\"Like a carriage and its axle, or lips and teeth—if one perishes, the other cannot survive.\"* This refers to Yu and Huò.\n\nThe **Yu King** (虞公) did not listen. In the twelfth month of winter, on the first day of the new moon (**Gěng Zǐ** 丙子), Jin destroyed Huò. The **Huò King** (虢公), **Chǒu** (丑), fled to the capital of **Jīng** (京师). Jin’s army returned and camped in Yu, then attacked and annihilated it. They captured the **Yu King** (虞公) and his ministers, including **Bó** (伯), and used them to humiliate **Qín Mù Gōng** (秦穆公)’s daughter, who was sent as a **bride** (媵).\n\nThe **Hu Lord** (胡王) loved music, and the **Qin King** (秦穆公) enticed him with female musicians.

The man who flees into emptiness clings to the narrow paths of *lídié*, stumbling through the void—yet when he hears the sound of footsteps approaching, he rejoices. How much more so when he hears the cough of kin or loved ones at his side! For long have none spoken the words of the True Person to our lord, their voices coughing beside him.

Only when one sees the singular can one transcend past and future. To follow the ceaseless renewal of the Transforming, to move with the ever-changing and yet never be swayed by things—this is called *dúhuà*.\"*\n\n**Corollary:** *\"The *Yì* says: *‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence.’* I excerpt from the *Yì Jìshī*:*\n\n*‘Sūn proceeds by exercising influence’—this means compliance.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the **feudal lords** (侯王) can **permanently hold the Mandate of Heaven** (永有天下), with none failing to submit (无思不服).\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"none failing to submit\"* (无思不服) appears in the *\"Mao Poems\"* (《毛诗_), specifically in the *\"Great Odes\"* (□大雅)—the *\"King Wen’s Resounding Virtue\"* (文王有声篇), where it states:\n*\"At Hao, King Wu established his capital and cleared the festering sores [of the land],\noffering rites from the west, from the east, from the south, from the north—\nnone failing to submit (无思不服).\"*\n　　*\"None failing to submit (无思不服), the august **Sovereign** (皇王) shines forth!\"*\n　　It speaks of **King Wu** establishing his domain at **Hao** (镐京).\n　　**Commentary:** *\"From\"* (自) means *\"by\"* or *\"through\"* (由), indicating that **King Wu** at **Hao** (镐京) performed the **clearing of festering sores** (辟痈) ritual, and all came from the four quarters to witness.\nAll were moved by **King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化), their hearts without fail submitting to him.\n\n　　It further states: *\"The august **Sovereign** shines forth!\"* (皇王烝哉).\n*\"August\"* (皇) means *\"great\"* (大), *\"shines forth\"* (烝) means *\"to rule\"* (君).\nThis refers to the **greatness of King Wu’s virtue and transformation** (德化大), allowing him to rule (君) throughout the ages.\n\n　　Now, this passage is cited to prove that when the **feudal lords** attain **Oneness** (一) and align with it (正), all **ten thousand states** (万国) rejoice and submit.\nThus, it is said: *\"The **feudal lords** who attain **Oneness** (侯王得一) set it as the standard for all under Heaven (以为天下正).\"*\n\n　　The consequences of failing to achieve this are dire:\nIf the **Way** (道) is not upheld, **Heaven** (天) will fear to remain clear (清), and may split asunder (裂).\nIf the **Way** is not aligned, the **Earth** (地) will fear to remain at peace (宁), and may erupt (发).\nIf the **Way** is not perfected, the **Spirit** (神) will fear to remain responsive (灵), and may grow dormant (歇).\nIf the **Way** is not sustained, the **valleys** (谷) will fear to remain full (盈), and may run dry (竭).\nIf the **Way** is not upheld, **all things** (万物) will fear to thrive (生), and may face extinction (灭).\nIf the **feudal lords** fail to attain **Oneness**, they may fear losing their exalted status (贵高), and their rule may falter (蹶).\n\n　　**Explication:** *\"The **Lingzhi** (《列子》) records that a man from **Qi State** (杞国) worried that Heaven and Earth would collapse and perish, leaving no place for his body to rest.\"*\n\n　　**Annotation from *Lingzhi’s* \"Heaven’s Bounties\" (□天瑞篇):**\n*\"In **Qi State** (杞国), there was a man. **King Tang of Yin** (殷汤) granted the **descendant of Xia** (夏后) the land of **Qi**, and the **Zhou** (周) later reaffirmed this grant.\nNow, it lies within **Chenliu County, Yongqiu** (陈留雍丘县), which is the territory of **Qi Prefecture** (杞州) today.\"*\n\n　　*(The **Explication** already contains this record, so it is not repeated here.)*\n\n　　Therefore, **exalted status** (贵) must be grounded in **humility** (贱), and **height** (高) must be rooted in **lowliness** (基).\nHence, the **feudal lords** (侯王) refer to themselves as *\"the lone one\"* (孤), *\"the few\"* (寡), or *\"not the grain\"* (不谷)—\nthis is their way of grounding themselves in humility (以贱为本), is it not?\nIndeed, it is not so.\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"the lone one\"* (孤) appears in the *\"Left Transmission\"* (《左传》):\n*\"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).\nThe **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德).\"*\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **seventh year of Duke Zhao** (昭公七年), the **King of Chu** (楚子) built the **Chengfang Terrace** (成章华之台) and wished to share it with the **feudal lords** (诸侯).\nTo uphold this tradition, he dared not let it fall into ruin (弗敢失陨坠), and so summoned the **ancestral spirits** (诸宗桃), saying:\n*\"My **ancestral Sovereign**, **King Gong** (恭王), stretched his neck and gazed northward,\nlonging for the **Sun and Moon** (日月) to fulfill his hopes (以冀).\nHe passed down his **Mandate** (序) and entrusted it (相授).\nTo this day, there have been four **Sovereigns** (王) of Chu (四王矣).\"*\nThese are **King Gong** (恭), **King Kang** (康), **King Jiao Ao** (郏敖), and **King Ling** (灵王).\n\n*\"Yet their blessings and grace (嘉惠) did not reach far,\nonly **Duke Xiang** (襄公) came to honor my funeral rites (临我丧).\"*\n*\"The lone one (孤) and his few ministers (二三臣) grieve in their hearts, their plans in disarray (失图).\nThe **Altar of the State** (社稷) is not secure (遑), how much less could they cherish and ponder the **virtue of their Sovereign** (君德).\"*\nThis refers to the **great mourning rites for King Kang** (康王大丧) being neglected, and **King Ling of Chu** (楚灵) lacking **trustworthiness** (信), thus his rule did not endure (不终).\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"the few\"* (寡人) follows the precedent set by earlier **Sovereigns** (先君) who deemed themselves *\"the few\"* (寡人) as **virtuous** (贤).\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **third year of Duke Yin** (隐公三年), **Duke Xuan of Song** (宋宣公) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established his younger brother **Duke Mu** (穆公) as ruler.\nWhen **Duke Mu** (穆公) fell ill, he summoned **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (大司马孔父) and entrusted him, saying:\n*\"My **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) abandoned his son **Yi** (与夷) and established **the few** (寡人) as ruler,\ndeeming **the few** (寡人) virtuous (为贤),\nand commanding him to oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).\nIf **the few** (寡人) were to abandon **virtue** (德) and refuse to yield (不让),\nand if **Yi** (与夷) were to succeed me (段后),\nthen when my **ancestral Sovereign** (先君) inquires of **Yi** (与夷),\nwhat words would he use to respond?\nI beg you, **Great Marshal Kong Fu** (子), to uphold this (奉之),\nand oversee the **Altar of the State** (社稷).\nEven if **the few** (寡人) were to die,\nhe would have no regrets (无悔焉).\"*\n\n　　**Explication:** The phrase *\"not the grain\"* (不谷) follows the precedent of **Duke Ling of Chu** (楚灵) condemning those who lack **perfected virtue** (成德).\n\n　　**Annotation:** In the *\"Spring and Autumn Annals\"* (《春秋》), during the **eleventh year of Duke Cheng** (成公十一年), there was the **Orderfu Meeting** (令狐之会) between **Qin and Jin** (秦晋).\n**Duke Li of Jin** (晋侯) arrived first, but **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯) refused to cross the **River Fen** (河).\nThese were **Duke Li of Jin** (晋厉公) and **Qin’s Marquis Huan** (秦桓公).\n\n*\"Qin betrayed the Jin alliance (背晋盟),\nand **Duke Li of Jin** sent **Lu’s Minister** (吕相) to sever ties with Qin (绝秦).\"*\n**Lu’s Minister** (吕相) questioned **Qin’s Marquis** (秦伯), saying:\n*\"The **people of Chu** (楚人) detest those who divide their **virtue** (德) into two or three (二三其德),\nand they have come to inform us:\n'Qin betrayed the **Orderfu Alliance** (令狐之盟),\nyet now comes to seek a new alliance from us (来求盟于我).\nWe proclaim to **Heaven’s Emperor** (皇天上帝), **Qin’s Three Dukes** (秦三公), and **Chu’s Three Kings** (楚三王):\nThough we have relations with Jin (余虽与晋出入),\nwe only seek our own advantage (余惟利是视).\n**Not the grain** (不谷) detests those who lack **perfected virtue** (无成德),\nand thus we declare this to warn against **disunity** (不一).'\"*\n\n---\n**The Tenth Scroll of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing* by Lingzhi* (《道德真经衍义手妙卷》) ends here.\n**The Eleventh Scroll of *Daoist Classics: Explication of the *Daodejing*

The strong reverses; moving yet proceeding with gentleness, thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame.\"*\n\nWang Bi annotates: *\"Entering is reversal, exiting is the growth of the strong; hence there is no strain.\"* Strain is akin to illness, companions refer to yang; hence it is said, *\"Thus entering and exiting without strain, companions arriving without blame.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world.\"* This is from the *Zhouyi Xici* (周易系辞).\n\nThe *Yijing* (易) is without thought, without action. Motionless and still, yet responding and thus communicating throughout the world—what can be more sincere than this? Who else could attain this?\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Gazing upward at Heaven, looking downward at Earth.\"* This is from the *Yijing Xici* (易系辞).\n\nWang Bi annotates: *\"Thus it can fully expound the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth: gazing upward to observe celestial omens, looking downward to examine terrestrial geography. Hence one knows the principles of darkness and light. It begins with the original and ends with the terminal, thus understanding the sayings of death and life.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Among the Five Phases, water reverses its flow, fully unified, and moves beneficially with the times.\"* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□黄帝篇).\n\nThe full meaning is already contained in the *Daodejing* (道经□内道冲章第四篇), so I shall not repeat the major points here. *\"Reversing its flow, fully unified\"* means that when water reverses, it aligns with the Dao/Way; when it is deep and still, it attains full unity. Laozi says: *\"When the heart is good, it is deep and vast, empty and still, not mingling with things. Though the waves and currents may vary, the nature of the depths remains unchanged, and when it moves, it does so in perfect timing.\"* Hence it is said: *\"Reversing its flow, fully unified, and moving beneficially with the times.\"*\n\n**The Dao/Way's Use Through Weakness (弱者道之用)**\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Pointing at me, you overcome me; stepping on me, you overcome me. Yet, as the wind travels, the boundless void can be said to be weak.\"* This is from the *Zhuangzi* (庄子□秋水篇).\n\nThe wind said: *\"When I move your spine and ribs, there is a likeness. Yet now I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea without any likeness—why is this?*\n*The wind replied: *\"Indeed. I rise from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea, yet when you point at me, I cannot bend your finger; when you step on me, I cannot bend your foot. This is the weakness of the small overcoming the small. I alone can uproot great trees and raise great houses, strike the vast expanse of the sea.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Release it to the east, and it flows east; release it to the west, and it flows west. Thus, water entrusted to the boundless void can be said to be weak.\"* This is from the *Mengzi* (孟子□告子章句上).\n\nGaozi said: *\"Human nature is like rushing water: released to the east, it flows east; released to the west, it flows west. Human nature’s lack of distinction between good and evil is like water’s lack of distinction between east and west.\"* Rush refers to the swirling and winding appearance of waves.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Liezi said: 'Form arises from the formless; thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?'\"* This is from the *Liezi* (列子□天瑞篇).\n\nLiezi said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage followed yin and yang to govern Heaven and Earth. The formless gives rise to form, thus how did Heaven and Earth come to be?*\n*This refers to the greatest forms of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang are not divine consciousness, yet form arises from the formless—does Heaven and Earth possess divine consciousness and innate nature? If they do not, then from where does it arise?\"*\n*This hypothetical question serves to illustrate that all things have their origin in the formless.*\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: \"The Superior Person Hears the Dao/Way\" (上士闻道章)**\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao/Way and diligently practices it.\nThe middle person hears the Dao/Way and holds it uncertainly, as if it exists or does not exist.\nThe inferior person hears the Dao/Way and laughs at it.\nIf one does not laugh, it is not the Dao/Way.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this.\"* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□子罕第九).\n\nThe Master said: *\"Speaking to him and he does not grow weary—his response is like this.\"* Fan Shi annotated: *\"Yanzi heard the Master’s words and understood them with his mind, practicing them with his strength. In the midst of chaos or adversity, he never failed to follow them. Like all things receiving timely rain and nourishment, flourishing and growing, how could he grow weary? This is what the other disciples could not match.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"As in the *Lunyu* where one can speak to the superior and the inferior.\"* This is from the *Lunyu* (论语□雍也第六).\n\nThe Master said: *\"Above the middle person, one can speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. Below the middle person, one cannot speak to him of the superior Dao/Way. This is because the quality of those below the middle person is such that if spoken to abruptly of things too lofty, not only can they not comprehend, but they will also presumptuously aspire to equal them, incurring the flaw of detachment from their own condition and ultimately remaining inferior.\"*\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"Like Zi Xia, who upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world rejoiced in returning, yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way found joy in it.\"* This is from the *Shiji* (史记□礼书), where Zi Xia’s eminent disciple is recorded.\n\nIt is said: *\"Upon seeing the bustling splendor of the world, he rejoiced in returning; yet hearing the Master’s Dao/Way, he found joy.\"* Both cases, his heart was conflicted and unable to decide itself, much less those below the middle person who are gradually steeped in losing the teachings and conforming to customs.\n\nThe *Lingzhi Explication* states: *\"The eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled.\"* This is from the *Zhuangzi*, in the dialogue between Daozi and Confucius.\n\nDaozi said: *\"Now I tell you: according to human desires, the eyes wish to see colors, the ears wish to hear sounds, the mouth wishes to discern flavors, the will and qi wish to be fulfilled.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「A man’s lifespan may reach a hundred years at its best, eighty in the middle, and sixty at its worst. Yet even when excluding the days lost to sickness, emaciation, death, mourning, sorrow, and calamity, one may open their mouth in laughter no more than four or five times within a month.\n\nHeaven and Earth are boundless, yet the eight deaths are limited in time. Wielding finite tools within the infinite expanse, one’s life passes swiftly—like a galloping *qí* (骐) and *jì* (骥) racing through a narrow gap. This is akin to the *zhāngfú* (章甫) hat being deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè* (越).\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"You’re So Uplifted\"* (逍遥游) chapter: *\"A man of Sòng (宋) sold his *zhāngfú* hat as merchandise.\"* The *zhāngfú* was the ceremonial hat of *Zōu* (邹) and *Lǔ* (鲁). The people of *Yuè* (越), however, had the custom of cutting their hair and tattooing their bodies, prizing neither hats nor headgear. Thus, it was said that the *zhāngfú* was deemed worthless by the people of *Yuè*.\n\nThis is also like *Hé Pú* (和璞) being abandoned by the state of *Chǔ* (楚).\n\nFrom the text: *Hé Pú* (和璞), whose given name was *Hé* (和) and surname *Biàn* (卞), was a man of *Chǔ* (楚). He dwelled beneath the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains, which lie in *Chǔ*’s territory and yield fine jade. *Biàn Hé* (卞和) found a jade *pú* (璞) and presented it to the *Chǔ* king. The king flew into a rage and had his left foot amputated. When the *Chǔ* king died and *Wǔ* (武) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) presented the jade again. *Wǔ* the king said: *\"You deceived my predecessor, and now I have had your right foot amputated.\"* *Hé* (和) embraced the jade and wept at the *Jīng* (荆) Mountains. When *Wǔ* the king died and *Chéng* (成) the king ascended the throne, *Hé* (和) once more sought to present the jade. *Chéng* the king ordered his ministers to carve it, and indeed it proved to be fine jade. Its value was beyond estimation.\n\nThis is also like saying: *\"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way.\"*\n\nFrom the *Zhuangzi*: *\"A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way.\"* This passage appears in *\"Qīu Shuǐ\"* (秋水), where it states: *\"The fish of the Northern Sea cannot be spoken to about the ocean, for it is confined by the shallows. The summer insects cannot be spoken to about ice, for they are bound to their season. A rigid scholar cannot be spoken to about the Dao/Way, for he is enslaved by doctrine.\"* This implies that lesser scholars do not grasp the subtleties of the Dao/Way, and that to make them laugh is insufficient to reveal its true nature.\n\nThere are sayings to this effect: *\"The Way of the Sage is like a valley, the great clarity like shame, the boundless virtue like insufficiency, the established virtue like theft, the pure truth like deception.\"* This is also like *Confucius* saying: *\"I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭).\"* From the *\"Lunyu\"* (论语) chapter *\"Shùér\"* (述而), it states: *\"The Master said: I transmit but do not innovate, I trust and love the ancient ways. In this, I modestly compare myself to my old teacher, *Péng* (彭).\"* The note explains: *\"Transmitting (述) means passing on what is old; innovating (作) means creating new beginnings.\"* Thus, only the Sage can innovate, while the virtuous may transmit. *\"Modestly compare\"* (窃比) is a respectful phrase, *\"I\"* (我) is a term of affection. *Péng* (彭) was a great minister of the *Shāng* (商) dynasty, as recorded in *\"Dàzǎi Lǐ\"* (大载礼). He was one who trusted in antiquity and transmitted its wisdom.\n\nThis is also like saying: *\"A good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Shǐjì\"* (史记) *\"Lìe Zhuàn\"* (列传): During the reign of *Yōu* (幽) King of *Zhōu* (周), *Confucius* visited the *Zhōu* capital. He served the elderly *Lǎozǐ* (老子) with great reverence and asked him about rites. *Lǎozǐ* (老子) replied: *\"The person you speak of, his flesh and bones, have all decayed. Only his words remain in your ears. Moreover, a gentleman rides when the times are favorable, and walks with a staff when they are not. I have heard that a good merchant conceals his wares as if they were nonexistent, and a man of great virtue appears humble in his bearing. Abandon your arrogance and excessive desires, your ostentatious demeanor and licentious thoughts—these are all of no benefit to your person. What I tell you is this: rid yourself of such traits.\"*\n\nThis is also like *Zhuangzi* saying: *\"Action only when necessity compels.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Kèyì\"* (刻意) chapter: *\"Thus, the Sage’s birth is the unfolding of Heaven’s will, and his death is Heaven’s course. At rest, he aligns with the stillness of *yin* (阴) and harmonizes with its virtue; in motion, he surfs the waves of *yáng* (阳) and rides its flow. He does not precede things, nor does he initiate calamity. He responds only when moved, and acts only when necessity compels.\"* This is also like the *Hànyīn* (汉阴) old man, who *\"stood alone, bearing the True as his sole responsibility, and kept apart from the world’s conventions.\"*\n\nFrom the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Tiāndì\"* (天地) chapter: *Zǐgōng* (子贡) traveled south to *Chǔ* (楚), then returned to *Jìn* (晋). Passing through *Hànyīn* (汉阴), he saw an old man diligently preparing a garden plot, dividing fifty *mǔ* (亩) into *qí* (畦). The old man dug a well, entered it with a bucket, and emerged to pour water, his movements clumsy yet laborious. *Zǐgōng* (子贡) said: *\"There is a device here—a *gāo* (槔) lever—that can irrigate a hundred plots in a day, requiring far less effort while achieving far more.\"* The gardener raised his head to look at him and said: *\"How so?\"* *Zǐgōng* (子贡) explained: *\"Carve a wooden lever, with the rear weighted and the front light. Draw water like pulling a string, and release it in measured surges—this is called a *gāo* (槔).\"* The gardener flushed with anger and laughed: *\"I have heard from my teacher: whoever uses a device will inevitably engage in contrivance, and whoever engages in contrivance will inevitably harbor a contriving heart. A contriving heart, once lodged in the chest, leaves no room for pristine whiteness. When pristine whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s emergence is unstable. An unstable spirit cannot be borne by the Dao/Way. I am not unaware, but I choose it out of shame.\"*\n\n*Zǐgōng* (子贡) was abashed and bowed his head, offering no further reply.\n\nThis is also like *\"Harmonizing with things, blending one’s light.\"* From the *\"Zhuangzi\"*’s *\"Gēngsāng Chǔ\"* (庚桑楚) chapter: *\"He moves without knowing where he goes, dwells without knowing what he does—this is how he follows things and rides their flow, the very essence of nurturing life.\"* This means that things flow as they are, and the Sage blends into their currents, his light harmonized and his traces obscured. In this, the Perfect Man has no heart, merging with the *Xuándào* (玄道, Mysterious Way).\n\nThe greatest square has no corners, the greatest vessel takes time to complete, the greatest sound is faint, the greatest form is shapeless. This is also like the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) and *húliè* (瑚琏).\n\nFrom the text: The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) are great tripods. The *\"Huángdì Nèi Zhuàn\"* (黄帝内传) states: *\"The Yellow Emperor explored the copper of *Shǒu* (首) Mountain and cast tripods at *Jīng* (荆) Mountain, which is today’s *Láochéng* (湖城) to the south. These were called the *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of *Jīng* (荆) Mountain.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「The *Húliè* (瑚琏) is referenced in *Lǔyǔ* (《鲁语》□公冶长篇). Zǐgòng (子贡) asked: *\"How might I compare, Master?\"* The Master replied: *\"You are a vessel.\"* He asked: *\"What vessel?\"* The Master said: *\"The *Húliè* (瑚琏).\"* The text records: *\"The *Jiǔdǐng* (九鼎) of the *Rǔ* (鲁) were made of millet and wheat; the *Xià* (夏) called them *Hú* (瑚), the *Shāng* (商) called them *Liè* (琏), the *Zhōu* (周) called them *Fǔguì* (簠簋). All were sacred vessels for ancestral temples, valued for their nobility.\"* Thus it is said: *\"The greatest vessel takes time to complete.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (庄子) said: *\"True beauty lies in enduring duration.\"* Referencing *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□人间世篇), *Yègōng Zǐgāo* (叶公子高), about to be dispatched to *Qí* (齐), consulted *Zhòngní* (仲尼). Zhòngní instructed him accordingly. Hence the saying: *\"Do not hasten the completion, nor urge it to fruition—excess only harms.\"* To hasten completion is perilous, yet true beauty lies in enduring duration; what is forced to completion cannot be altered for the worse—should one not fear this?\n\n**Chapter 42: *Dàoshēngyī* (道生一)**\nThe Dao/Way gives rise to One (一), One gives rise to Two (二), Two gives rise to Three (三), Three gives rise to myriad things (万物).\nExpounding further: *\"In undifferentiated unity, the One *Qì* (氤氲) does not yet scatter.\"* This undifferentiated unity is the One (一). The One (一) is the *Tàijí* (太极). Referencing *Lièzǐ* (《列子》□天瑞篇), Zǐ Lièzǐ (子列子) said: *\"In ancient times, the Sage followed the interplay of yin and yang to govern the heavens and earth. For what has form arises from what is formless—how then did the heavens and earth come into being?\"* Hence it is said: *\"There is the *Tàiyì* (太易), the *Tàichū* (太初), the *Tàishǐ* (太始), and the *Tàisù* (太素).\"* The *Tàiyì* (太易) is the state before *Qì* (氣) manifests; the *Tàichū* (太初) is the origin of *Qì*; the *Tàishǐ* (太始) is the origin of form; the *Tàisù* (太素) is the origin of substance. When *Qì*, form, and substance are present yet not yet differentiated, it is called *Húnlún* (浑沦). *Húnlún* means that myriad things are undifferentiated yet not yet separated. It is unseen when viewed, unheard when listened to, untraceable when followed—thus it is called *Yì* (易). *Yì* has no fixed form; it transforms into One (一), One into Seven (七), Seven into Nine (九). Nine transformations (九变) signify completion (究). Then it transforms again into One (一). One (一) is the beginning of form’s transformation (形变之始). The light and pure *Qì* ascends to become the heavens, the heavy and turbid descends to become the earth, and the harmonious *Qì* coalesces as humanity. Thus it is said: *\"The heavens and earth contain the essence, and myriad things are born through transformation.\"* Expounding further: *\"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (氤氲) give rise to myriad things through transformation.\"*\n\nReferencing *Zhōuyǐ Xìcí* (《周易系辞》): *\"The heavens and earth in their *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) embrace, and myriad things are refined through transformation (化醇).\"* When male and female intermingle their essences, myriad things are born through transformation (化生). *Yīnyūn* (絪缊) signifies mutual attachment; it speaks of the heavens and earth without intention, naturally attaining unity. Only when the two *Qì* (二气) embrace in *Yīnyūn* (絪缊), harmoniously converging, do myriad things respond and transform into refined essences (精醇). All things bear yin and embrace yang, their harmonious *Qì* (冲气) as their mediator.\n\nExpounding further: *Zhuāngzǐ* (《庄子》□田子方) states: *\"The utmost yang blazes with radiance, the utmost yin is solemn and grave. This solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance arises from the earth.\"* The utmost yin is solemn and grave, the utmost yang blazes with radiance; this solemnity emanates from the heavens, this radiance from the earth. This solemnity is yin-*Qì* (阴气), this radiance is yang-*Qì* (阳气)—it speaks of their harmonious balance (交泰). When the two *Qì* (二) intermingle and achieve harmony, then things are born.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Perfect Man empties his spiritual chamber, and pure white *Qì* converges.\"* Referencing: *\"The heart is the abode of the spirit and soul.\"* Hence it is said: *\"The spiritual chamber is an empty space, where pure white *Qì* arises.\"* Expounding further: *\"The virtuous man does not perturb his heart, and thus his *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* may be nurtured.\"* Referencing *Mèngzǐ* (《孟子》□公孙丑章句上), *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) said: *\"At forty, I do not perturb my heart.\"* Forty is the age when a strong and capable man’s Dao/Way is clear, his virtue/power established. *Kǒngzǐ* (孔子) also said: *\"At forty, one is free from confusion\"*—meaning the same as *Mèngzǐ*’s *\"not perturbing the heart.\"*\"* *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *\"Master, how do you excel?\"* He replied: *\"I know speech, and I excel at nurturing my *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*.\"* This was *Gōngsūn Qiú* (公孙丑) asking *Mèngzǐ* (孟子) why his *\"not perturbing the heart\"* differed from *Tàozǐ* (告子). *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì* is what one gains by not perturbing the heart. *Gǎnwèn* (敢问): *\"What is this *Hàorán* (浩然) *Qì*?\"* He replied: *\"It is difficult to speak of.\"* As *Qì*, it is vast and resolute; if one nourishes it uprightly without harm, it fills the space between heaven and earth. What men abhor are solitude, poverty, and lack of grain—yet kings and nobles take these as their titles. Thus, things may sometimes be diminished to gain greater benefit, or increased to greater detriment.\n\nExpounding further: *\"Solitude, poverty, and lack of grain\"* are omens of misfortune. Referencing *Zuǒzhuàn* (《左传》) and *Chūnqiū* (《春秋》)—already recorded in the earlier chapter on *\"Obtaining the One\"* (得一), and thus not repeated here.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility.\"* Referencing *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ Tuǎncí* (《周易谦卦彖辞》): *\"The Dao/Way of heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility; the Dao/Way of earth transforms excess into flowing humility; spirits and gods harm excess and favor humility; human nature abhors excess and loves humility. Humility is exalted and luminous, lowly yet uncrossable—this is the end of the virtuous man.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"Lowly to preserve oneself.\"* Referencing the *Yáo cí* (爻辞) of *Zhōuyǐ Tiǎn Coǎ* (《周易谦卦》), *Chūliù* (初六): *\"Humility, humility—the virtuous man. Crossing great rivers, auspicious.\"* The *Xiàng cí* (象辞) says: *\"Humility, humility—the virtuous man, lowly to preserve himself.\"* This means that the humbly virtuous man always nurtures his fortune through humility.\n\nExpounding further: *\"The gluttonous and greedy seek wealth and nobility.\"* Referencing: *\"The *Tāotiè* (饕餮) were the unworthy sons of *Zǐyún Shì* (缙云氏).\"* The gluttonous (餮) and the greedy (饕) are those who covet wealth and profit to attain riches and nobility—yet do they not know the Sage’s words: *\"To be unrighteous yet rich and noble is to me like floating clouds\"*?\n\nExpounding further: *\"The *Shū* (《书》) says: *\"Fullness invites loss.\"*\"* Referencing *Shàngshū* (《尚书》□大禹谟), *Yǔ* (禹) was praised: *\"Only through virtue does one move heaven, reaching even the distant—excess invites loss, humility invites benefit. This is the Dao/Way of time.\"*",

Yet in the end, it crumbled like earth and shattered like pottery, not even lasting a generation. Fú Sū (扶苏) died at the Great Wall, and Yīng (子婴) surrendered at Zhì Dào (轵道), reigning for but forty-six days before Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) arrived to behead him—its lineage extinguished, its state annihilated. From this, is it not clear that despotism brings ruin?\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"The Great Han flourished through harmony and benevolence.\"* Referencing: *\"The Han High Ancestor, Liú Bāng (刘邦) of Pēngchéng (彭城) and Fēngpèi (丰沛), promoted the worthy and employed the capable, waged a fierce battle with Xiàng Yǔ (项羽) to seize the realm. His virtue subdued mighty Chu (楚), his benevolence extended to all living beings. Wise strategists plotted for him, and virtuous advisors turned their talents toward him, allowing him to achieve imperial success through the Three Heroes (三杰)—his conquests were sealed by their counsel. With the Three Chapters (三章), he eased the weariness of the people: In the eleventh month of the second year of his reign, the Stripe Prince (沛公) summoned all the elders and leaders of the counties, saying: 'Elders, you have suffered under Qin’s harsh laws for so long. I have made a pact with the feudal lords: whoever enters the Central Plains first shall be king. I shall be king of the Central Plains, and with you, I shall enact only Three Chapters of law. Those who kill shall die, those who wound or steal shall be punished accordingly—all other Qin laws shall be abolished. Let all officials and citizens rest in peace as before.' Thus, the people found security under his rule.\"*\n\nExpounding further: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, Yì (羿) excelled in archery, and Jié (奡) was skilled in rowing—yet none met a good end.\"* Referencing: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路) loved valor, yet did not meet a good end.\"* This is from *Lúnyǔ* (《论语》□《公冶长第五》). The Master said: *\"When the Dao/Way cannot be practiced, one may board a raft and float upon the sea.\"* Those who follow me, it is Zǐ Lù (子路) and me. Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced. The Master said: *\"Zǐ Lù (子路), his love of valor surpasses mine, yet he lacks the means to wield it properly.\"* Zǐ Lù heard this and rejoiced, assuming the Master’s words were a compliment, unaware of their true intent. The Master praised his valor yet criticized his inability to measure actions with righteousness. Yì (羿), the skilled archer, was the ruler of the State of Yǒuqióng (有穷氏), whose strength lay in his archery. Jié (奡), the boat rower, relied on his physical prowess—able to navigate vessels on land, as previously recorded in the thirty-third chapter, and thus not repeated here. These three men all depended on their valor and strength to triumph over others, yet none met a good end—all failed to grasp the virtue of gentleness and yielding.

Extending the meaning: **Gāoyáo** was mute yet served as the Grand Judge, and under his rule, no cruel punishments existed throughout the land. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.\n\n**Shī Guāng**, blind yet appointed as the Grand Steward, ensured **Jìn**’s governance remained uncorrupted. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern order.\n\nQuoting *Wénzǐ*’s *\"Spiritual Essence\"* (精神篇), it is said: **\"Lǎo Jūn** spoke: ‘The sun’s warmth in winter, the shade in summer—all things return to them without being summoned. They come when not invited, depart when not dismissed, vast and mysterious, their work accomplished without conscious effort. Yet men wait for the sun to illuminate their sight and for words to issue commands. In governance, such reliance is difficult indeed.\n\n**Gāoyáo**, though mute, administered the Grand Judiciary, and no cruel punishments existed under his rule. Thus, there must be value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *\"Explanations of the Master’s Arts\"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though his judgment may seem obscure, the laws and disputes were handled with fairness, so there is value in **speech**—the ability to convey justice.’\n\n**Shī Guāng**, though blind, governed with great order, ensuring **Jìn**’s realm had no chaotic rule. Thus, there must be value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’ From *Huáinán Hóngliè*’s *\"Explanations of the Master’s Arts\"* (解主术训篇): ‘Though he was blind, he brought great order, and **Jìn**’s realm was free from corruption—thus, there is value in **vision**—the ability to discern what is seen.’\n\nThe **Dao/Way’s** silent command, its unseen insight—this is how the **sage** serves as a teacher. The people are transformed by what they observe, not by his words alone.\n\nExtending the meaning, this passage is cited to prove the **teaching without words**, the **benefits of non-action**—though few can attain such harmony, it is no empty claim.\n\nExtending the meaning: Among the **Nine Schools** and **Hundred Masters**, few can truly grasp the **non-action** of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nQuoting: The **Nine Schools**—as recorded in the *Han Records*—are nine of the ten **schools of thought** worthy of observation.\n\nThe nine families are:\n1. **Confucianism** (儒家),\n2. **Daoism** (道家),\n3. **Yin-Yang** (阴阳家),\n4. **Legalism** (法家),\n5. **Logicians** (名家),\n6. **Mohism** (墨家),\n7. **Diplomatic Strategists** (纵横家),\n8. **Miscellaneous** (杂家),\n9. **Agrarianism** (农家).\n\nThe **Hundred Masters** of **military schools**—outside the **Six Classics**’s orthodox teachings—each composed their own works.

      "translated_text": "「Excerpt: **Bào Jiāo**—as recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Thieves Zhí\" chapter**—was a man whose conduct defied the world. He died by embracing a tree. His given name was Jiāo, of the Bào clan, a recluse of the Zhou era. His conduct was pure and unyielding: he carried burdens, gathered firewood, and gathered acorns for sustenance, neither serving the Son of Heaven nor associating with feudal lords. When **Zǐ Gòng** passed by, he said, *\"I have heard that one does not tread upon lands whose governance is unjust, nor accept benefits from a disgraced lord. Yet you walk this land and consume its bounty—how can this be just?\"* Bào Jiāo replied, *\"I have heard that a virtuous man values advancement but despises retreat, that the worthy are easily shamed but lightly die.\"* Thus, he stood and embraced the tree until he withered away.\n\n**Jiè Zǐ Tuī** was one of unparalleled loyalty. He cut his own thigh to feed **Wén Gōng**, but when Wén Gōng later betrayed him, Jiè Zǐ Tuī, enraged, fled and burned to death while embracing a tree. In his youth, **Jìn Wén Gōng** (Zhòng ěr) faced persecution from his stepmother **Lì Jī**, whose son, **Yí Jiù**, sought to supplant him. Lì Jī slandered Zhòng ěr to **Xiàn Gōng**, who believed her, forcing Zhòng ěr into exile. Starving along the road, Jiè Zǐ Tuī cut his own thigh to feed him. Later, when Zhòng ěr returned to ascend the throne as Wén Gōng, he rewarded his followers—all but Jiè Zǐ Tuī. The latter composed *The Dragon-Snake Song*, inscribed it on the camp gate, and departed in fury. Wén Gōng, repentant, pursued him to **Jiè Shān** (also called **Mián Shān**), but Jiè Zǐ Tuī refused to emerge. The king set the mountain ablaze, hoping to drive him out, but Jiè Zǐ Tuī made no attempt to escape. Instead, he embraced a tree and burned to death.\n\nThus, these two exemplify those who cling to **names** while burdening **reality**.\n\n**Extended Meaning:** The wealthy toil endlessly to enrich themselves, the noble exhaust themselves in ceaseless scheming. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"The Ultimate in Joy\" chapter**:\n*\"What the world reveres are wealth, nobility, longevity, and virtue. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine silks, beauty, and music. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and vice. What it suffers are unease of the body, lack of delicacies, absence of fine garments, deprivation of beauty, and silence of music. If these are denied, great anxiety and fear arise. How foolish the body is! The wealthy exhaust themselves in labor, hoarding wealth they cannot fully enjoy—their bodies are thus enslaved by externals. The noble toil night and day, fretting over right and wrong—their bodies are thus estranged. Man is born with care, and the long-lived merely delay death through marriage and wisdom. What suffering is this! Their bodies are thus alienated.\n\nBy this reasoning, the wealthy and noble—greedy for **names**, enslaved by **gain**—bear lifelong burdens and know no moment of true joy. This serves as proof for the argument: *Which is greater, the body’s toll or the cost of wealth?*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** The scholar’s sacrifice is for **names**; the greedy man’s for **gain**. As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**:\n*\"Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties, none under heaven have failed to trade their nature for material things. The petty man sacrifices his body for profit, the scholar for **names**, the noble for his clan, and the sage for the world. Thus, though their pursuits differ and their **names** and **reality** diverge, all harm their nature by sacrificing their bodies—one end, the same result.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Bó Yí** died beneath the **Shǒuyáng** slope. (The full account is detailed in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**, and thus is omitted here.)\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Zhí Zhí** died for **gain** upon **Dōng Líng**’s heights. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Overlapping Thumbs\" chapter**): Zhí Zhí, a younger kinsman of **Liǔ Xià Huì**, bore the name Zhí, commanding nine thousand soldiers as a notorious bandit. **Dōng Líng** was the name of a mountain—also called **Tài Shān**—located within Jì Zhōu, fifteen *lǐ* from **Dōng Píng**. There, Zhí Zhí met his end.\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Méng Zhòng** refused the楚相’s offer, preferring instead to be a **yèwěi** (dragging-tail) tortoise. (As recorded in *Zhuāngzǐ*’s **\"Autumn Water\" chapter**): **Zhuāngzǐ** fished in the **Pú** River, while **Chǔ Wēi Wáng** sent two officials to invite him, saying, *\"We would honor you with our entire realm.\"* Zhuāngzǐ, holding his fishing rod, paid them no mind, replying, *\"I have heard that楚 has a sacred tortoise, dead these three thousand years. The king wraps it in silk and enshrines it in his ancestral temple. Would it not prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud, over death, honored as a relic?\"* The two officials answered, *\"It would prefer life, dragging its tail in the mud.\"* Zhuāngzǐ said, *\"Then go—I too shall drag my tail in the mud.\"*\n\n**Extended Meaning:** **Tiān Shī** declined the post of **Dàfū**, instead wishing to study the **Way of Xuān Yuán**. (As recorded in *Zhāng Shì Jiā Zhuán*): **Tiān Shī**, surnamed Zhāng with the given name Dào Líng and courtesy name **Fú Hàn**, was the sixth-generation descendant of **Xiù Hóu**. Naturally reticent and fond of antiquity, he mastered the classics and histories, as well as the studies of stars, constellations, and *tú wéi* (divinatory texts). He relieved the urgent needs of others without regard to kinship, his reputation spreading through court and commoner alike. When **Hàn Cháng Dì** issued an edict summoning him as **Jiànyì Dàfū**, he declined.*",

Those who ride upon **names** shower blessings upon their **clans**, favoring their **kinfolk** and benefiting the entire **neighborhood**.

Even parents, wives, and children, though most beloved, cannot be kept forever. And if my own body is not yet perfected, how could I ever possess the noble wealth beyond it? I have heard that in the ancient age, Xuān Yuán and Qiáo Sōng attained the Dao, ascending to the heavens and wandering in the boundless. They are my teachers.

      "translated_text": "「Yet further, he spoke of the tranquil and contented manner of aligning with one’s **Dao/Way** and **qi/vital energy**, this being the text from *The Analects – \"Xiāng Páng\"* Section. Its general meaning is that the tranquil and sincere demeanor of one who embodies **virtue/power** appears as though he cannot speak, yet it is the humble and yielding posture of one who does not presume his wisdom over others.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: \"Life and Death\"**\nLife and death, entering and exiting.\n\n**Extended Commentary:** Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. The handwritten notes from *The Zhouyi* (I Ching) state: \"Hence, he knows the **Dao/Way** of encompassing all things.\" Gazing upward to study the celestial patterns, looking downward to examine the earthly structures, thus one knows the reasons behind the hidden and the manifest. Observing the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. This speaks of using the **Dao/Way** of *The Zhouyi* in upward contemplation and downward observation, thereby knowing the unseen yet profound (幽) and the seen yet apparent (明), the principles and their applications.\n\nObserving the origin and returning to the end, one thus understands the doctrine of life and death. It means that by applying the principles of *The Zhouyi* to trace the initial stages and the final outcomes of all things, one comprehends the auspicious and inauspicious fate of their beginnings and endings, thereby knowing the doctrine of life and death.\n\nOf those who live, ten in every thirteen are reckless; of those who die, ten in every thirteen are reckless. In the course of human life, ten in every thirteen meet their death through reckless actions.\n\n**Extended Commentary:** This refers to the use of the nine orifices and four limbs, or the three activities and ten evils.\nThe handwritten notes from **Hán Fēi** state: \"Ten in every thirteen refers to the nine orifices and four limbs.\" That is, the two ears, two eyes, two nostrils (considered as two orifices), along with the mouth and the two lower orifices, totaling nine orifices. The two hands and two feet are termed the four limbs. **Hé Shàng Gōng** also agrees with this interpretation.\n\nAnother interpretation cites the three activities and ten evils. The three activities refer to **body, speech, and mind**. The ten evils are:\n1. Killing living beings,\n2. Theft and robbery,\n3. Lewdness and licentiousness,\n4. Treason and rebellion against superiors,\n5. Defaming and slandering sacred scriptures and laws,\n6. Cursing and blaspheming in darkness,\n7. Secret plotting, resentment, and jealousy,\n8. Slanderous speech and causing discord,\n9. Breaking vows and violating precepts,\n10. Touching or defiling altars and sacred grounds.\n\n**Sūn Dēng’s** explanation states: Among the things of Heaven and Earth, those of the living kind, few abide by the **Dao/Way**, while many defy it. Hence, of those who live recklessly, three in every ten conform to the **Dao/Way**. Those who live not in accordance with the **Dao/Way** and die not in accordance with reason are few, while those who defy them are many. Thus, of those who die, three in every ten submit to their fate.\n\nThe *Broad Explication of the Sacred* states: One who does not take joy in life yet remains content with it is among those who live recklessly. If one does not let desires and greed disrupt his mind while alive, nor let excessive nourishment harm his nature, but remains at ease with simplicity and humility, aligns with the natural flow of **qi/vital energy**, maintains the tranquility of his spirit, and steadies his mind—then, without seeking to prolong life, life itself will be extended. Without striving to advance in the **Dao/Way**, the **Dao/Way** will progress naturally. This is the teaching of **Dù Tiānshī**.\n\nIn my humble view, those who preserve life in such a manner are not merely three in every ten.

Because they dwell in **‘non-death’**.\"*\n\nThe *Yanyì* further explains: *\"Zhuangzi said: ‘If one empties oneself to wander through the world, who could harm them?’\"* It cites the *Zhuangzi*’s **\"Mountain Trees\"** chapter:\n\n*\"Two square boats drifted side by side upon the river.

A man of such a mind, if another stood upon him, would call out, ‘Expand and contract!’ If the first call went unheard, the second unheard, then a third—he would not respond with harshness. Earlier, he was not angry yet now he is; earlier, he was empty yet now he is full.

      "original_text": "道生之，德畜之，物形之，势成之。 衍义云：则裸者不得不裸，鳞介毛羽者不得不鳞介毛羽。 钞《孔子家语》中五帝第二十四章中之辞。 此孔子答子贡之言。 孔子曰：然吾昔闻诸，老聃亦如汝之言，是故坚土之人刚，弱土之人柔，墟土之人大，沙土之人细，息土之人美，先耗也土之人丑，食水者善游而耐寒，食土者无心而不息，不气息也食木者多力而不治，血气不治。 《淮南子》曰：多力而弗戾，亦不治之貌者也。 食草者善走而愚，食桑者有绪而蛾，食肉者勇毅而捍，食气者神明而寿，食谷者智慧而明，不食者不死而神。 故曰羽虫三百有六十而凤为之长，毛虫三百有六十而麟为之长，甲虫三百有六十而龟为之长，躲虫三百有六十而人为之长。 此乾坤之美也。 殊形异类之数，王者动必以道动，静必以道静，必顺理而不害其所生，谓之仁寿焉。 衍义云：以至少壮老死不得不少壮老死。 钞《列子□天瑞篇》之文。 黄帝曰：精神入其门，骨骸反其根，我尚何存。 人自生至终，大化有四：婴孩也，少壮也，老耄也，死亡也。 其在婴孩，气专志一，和之至也。 物不伤焉，德莫加焉。 其在少壮，则血气飘溢，欲虑充起，物所攻焉，德故衰焉。 其在老耄，则欲虑柔焉，体将休焉，物莫先焉。 虽未及婴孩之全，方於少壮，间矣。 其在死亡也，则之於息焉，反其极矣。 是以万物莫不尊道而贵德。 衍义云：庄子所谓真君。 又引庄子所谓真宰是也。 钞《庄子□齐物论》之文。 不知其所为使，若有真宰，而特不得其朕其递，相为君臣乎。 其有真君存焉。 道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之爵，而常自然。 衍义云：公、侯、伯、子、男之例。 钞：周设五等之爵，有公、侯、伯、子、男也。 先王制法则有天子、诸侯、卿大夫、士、庶，亦有五等，而兼王焉。 人之处世，上以君其不有材器也。 君举而用之，然后爵之而尊，宠之而贵。 而此尊贵，乃有穷极之时。 今道以生物，为物所尊。 德以畜万物，为物所贵。 生生而不绝，故生物之功常尊。 成成而不穷，故成物之功常贵。 岂有穷极之期乎。 衍义云：孟子曰：有天爵者，有人爵者。 钞《孟子□告子章句上》云：有天爵者，有人爵者，仁义忠信，乐善不倦，此天爵也。 公卿大夫，此人爵也。 天爵以德，人爵以禄。 古之人修其天爵，而人爵从之。 今之人修其天爵，以要人爵。 既得人爵，而弃其天爵，则惑之甚者也，终亦必亡而已矣。 今孟子以仁义忠信为天爵，况道之与德又在仁义忠信之上，故云道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之爵，而常自然。 衍义云； 庄子钓於濮水。 钞《庄子□秋水篇》之文。 濮，水名，属东郡，今濮州濮阳县是也。 楚王，楚威王也。 知庄生贤达，屈为卿辅，发使命先迷其意，愿以国境之内委托贤人，王事殷繁，不无忧累之也。 义中已备，不必重录。 生而不有，为而不恃，长而不宰，是谓玄德 衍义云：退藏於密，可谓深远。 钞《易系辞》之文。 子曰：夫易何为者也，夫易开物成务，冒天下之道，如斯而已者也。 是故圣人以通天下之志，以定天下之业，以断天下之疑。 是故蓍之德圆而神，卦之德方以知，六爻之义易以贡。 圣人以此洗心，退藏於密，吉凶与民同患。 神以知来，知以藏往，其孰能与於此哉。",
      "translated_text": "The Dao/Way gives birth to it, virtue/power nurtures it, things shape it, and circumstances complete it.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Thus, the naked cannot but be naked, and those with scales, shells, fur, or feathers cannot but have scales, shells, fur, or feathers.\"*\n\nRecorded in *The Analects of Confucius*, Chapter Twenty-Four of *The Five Emperors*: These are the words of Confucius in response to Zigong.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Indeed, I once heard from Laozi that it was as you say. Thus, those born of firm earth are sturdy, those of weak earth are yielding, those of crumbling earth are vast, those of sandy earth are refined, those of damp earth are beautiful, and those of exhausted earth are ugly. Those who eat water excel in swimming and endure cold, those who eat earth are without desire and do not tire—*they do not breathe*—those who eat wood are strong but unrefined—*their vital essence is ungoverned*—those who eat grass are swift but foolish, those who eat mulberry leaves have silken threads like silkworms, those who eat meat are courageous and defensive, those who eat qi are spiritually enlightened and long-lived, those who eat grains are wise and clear-sighted, and those who eat nothing do not die but become divine.\"*\n\n*The Huainanzi* states: *\"Though strong yet not violent, this too is the appearance of the unrefined.\"*\n\nThus it is said: *\"Among feathered creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the phoenix is their sovereign. Among furred creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the qilin is their sovereign. Among shelled creatures, there are three hundred and sixty, and the tortoise is their sovereign. Among creatures with hidden forms, there are three hundred and sixty, and humanity is their sovereign.\"* This is the beauty of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThough their forms and kinds differ, the sovereign must act in accordance with the Dao/Way when moving and must rest in accordance with the Dao/Way, ever following nature without harming what is born. This is called *ren* and longevity.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"As for the young, the strong, and the old—death is inevitable.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Liezi* (missing character in *\"Heavenly Blessing\"* chapter): The Yellow Emperor said: *\"When the spirit enters its gate and the bones return to their roots, what remains of me?\"*\n\nFrom birth to death, the Great Transformation has four stages: infancy, youth and vigor, old age, and death. In infancy, the qi is concentrated and the will is singular—harmony at its peak. Nothing harms it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and vigor, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts surge—things assail it, and virtue declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body nears rest—nothing precedes it. Though it does not reach the fullness of infancy, it is already distant from youth and vigor. In death, it returns to stillness, reaching its extreme.\n\nThus, all things revere the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"This is what Zhuangzi called the True Sovereign.\"* It also cites Zhuangzi’s *\"True Steward\"*:\n\n*\"One does not know what it is that commands, yet if there is a True Sovereign, it is only that its traces and succession are not grasped—how could it be otherwise than sovereign and minister?\"* A True Sovereign indeed exists.\n\nThe Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so.\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"As in the case of the five ranks of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron.\"*\n\nRecorded: The Zhou established five ranks of nobility—duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. The ancient kings’ laws also had five grades: sovereign, nobles, ministers and great officers, scholars, and commoners—including the sovereign himself.\n\nIn the world, the ruler governs not because he lacks talent or tools. When he selects and employs them, he then confers titles and honors, bestowing nobility and prestige. Yet this nobility and prestige have their limits. The Dao/Way gives birth to things and is revered by them. Virtue/power nurtures all things and is honored by them. Endlessly generating without cessation, the function of giving birth is eternally revered. Endlessly completing without exhaustion, the function of perfecting is eternally honored. How could there be any limit?\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Mencius said: There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Mencius*, *\"Telling Zigong of Proper Conduct\"* (Upper): *\"There is the noble title of Heaven, and there is the noble title of humanity. Ren, yi, zhong, and xin—joy in goodness without weariness—this is the noble title of Heaven. Dukes, ministers, and great officers—this is the noble title of humanity. The noble title of Heaven is earned through virtue/power, and the noble title of humanity is earned through emolument. The ancients cultivated their noble title of Heaven, and the noble title of humanity followed. Today’s people cultivate their noble title of Heaven to seek the noble title of humanity. Once they obtain the noble title of humanity, they abandon their noble title of Heaven—this is the greatest confusion, and it will surely lead to ruin.\"*\n\nNow Mencius takes *ren*, *yi*, *zhong*, and *xin* as the noble title of Heaven. How much more so the Dao/Way and virtue/power, which surpass *ren* and *yi*! Thus it is said: *\"The Dao/Way is exalted, virtue/power is noble—none confer titles upon it, yet it is ever naturally so.\"*\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Zhuangzi fishing in the Pu River.\"*\n\nRecorded in *Zhuangzi*, *\"Autumn Water\"* chapter: Pu is the name of a river, belonging to Dong Commandery—today’s Pu County in Puyang. The King of Chu (Chu King Wei) knew Zhuangzi was a sage of great insight, so he sent envoys to offer him the position of minister, first testing his intentions. He wished to entrust the governance of his realm to a worthy, for state affairs were burdensome and he bore many worries. The meaning is already fully elaborated; there is no need to repeat it.\n\n*\"To act without possession, to labor without reliance, to grow without domination—this is called the Mysterious Virtue.\"*\n\n*Yanyì* notes: *\"Retreating and hiding in secrecy—this is profound and distant.\"*\n\nRecorded in *The System of the Classic of Changes*: The Master said: *\"What is the *Yijing* for? It opens what is hidden and completes undertakings, encompassing the Dao/Way of all under Heaven. Such is its function. Thus, the sage uses it to harmonize the wills of all under Heaven, to establish the undertakings of all under Heaven, and to resolve the doubts of all under Heaven. Therefore, the virtue/power of the stalks is round and divine, the virtue/power of the trigrams is square and knowing, and the meanings of the six lines are easy yet profound. The sage uses this to purify the heart, retreating and hiding in secrecy, sharing in the joys and sorrows of the people. Divine insight knows the future, and knowledge preserves the past—who could rival this?\"*",

Earlier, he was not angry yet now he is; earlier, he was empty yet now he is full. If one empties themselves to wander through the world, who could harm them?\"*\n\nThe *Yanyì* concludes: *\"As in the Daoist transmission of Liu Gang.\"* It notes: *\"This is recorded in the *List of Immortals*, with its meaning already fully elaborated. This is Chapter Fifty-One of *Dao Sheng*.\"*",

If this gate of disaster is applied to a state, governance will falter; if practiced in the body, the Dao/Way will decline.

      "translated_text": "「The Five Sons were the younger brothers of Tàikāng.  When Tàikāng sat upon the throne in name only, indulging in ease and pleasure to extinguish his own virtue, they composed this song to admonish him.  It says:\n\n*\"The Way teaches thus:*\n*Within, he indulged in wanton excess,*\n*Without, he hunted beasts without restraint.*\n*Drunk on wine, lost in music,*\n*Towering halls and carved walls—*\n*One such act, and none shall escape ruin.\"*\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Fields and rice paddies left barren.\nThis is how the poets censured King Yōu.\nRecorded from the *Máo Shī*’s [\"小雅·楚茨\"] *Xiǎoyǎ·Chǔcú*, censuring King Yōu.\n\n*\"Excessive governance and heavy taxation,*\n*Fields and rice paddies left barren,*\n*Famine and pestilence descend,*\n*The people perish and flee.*\n*Sacrifices fail to nourish the spirits,*\n*Thus the virtuous ones ponder the ancient ways.*\n\n*Clad in fine embroidery,*\n*Wearing sharp blades,*\n*Disdaining ordinary food,*\n*Yet wealth overflows.*\n*This is called ‘robber’s ostentation’—*\n*How can it be the true Dao?\"*\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Clad in fine embroidery, like Emperor Yángdì of Sui, who clipped silk to make flower-like adornments for his dragon boat.\n\nRecorded: In the first year of Sui’s *Dàyì* era (605 CE), the fifth month, Emperor Yángdì constructed the Western Gardens, two hundred *lǐ* in circumference. Within it lay a man-made sea, ten *lǐ* or more in breadth. He built the Fāngzhàng, Pénglái, and Yíngzhōu mountains, each a hundred *zǐ* in height, with pavilions, towers, and palaces dotting their peaks. To the north of the sea, he dug a canal winding into its heart. Sixteen gateways of the Green Canal were all built along its banks, each presided over by a consort of the fourth rank. The gardens were lavish beyond measure. When the trees within the palace were trimmed, he would clip silk to fashion flower and leaf decorations, replacing them whenever the colors faded. Within the ponds, he similarly clipped silk to create lotus and water chestnut plants, exchanging them for new ones when their hues grew dull. The sixteen gateways vied with each other in offering exquisite delicacies, seeking favor through extravagant displays. The Emperor delighted in nightly excursions through the gardens with thousands of attendants, composing the *Qīngyè Yóu* (\"Clear Night Journey\") song to be performed on horseback. In the eighth month, the Emperor traveled to Jiāngdū. When he boarded the dragon boat there, it was four tiers high, forty-five *zǐ* in height, and two hundred *zǐ* long, with a main hall, inner hall, and court chamber on the topmost level. The middle two tiers housed a hundred and twenty rooms, all adorned with gold and jade. The lowest tier served as quarters for the eunuch attendants. The Empress rode in a floating pavilion, its design slightly smaller than the Emperor’s. There were also nine *Fújǐng* (\"Floating Scenes\") vessels, three tiers high, each a water palace. Thousands more boats carried the consorts, royal princes, officials, monks, nuns, Daoists, and foreign guests. Altogether, they employed over eighty thousand oarsmen, all dressed in brocade robes. A thousand more vessels bore the escorting guards, their prows and sterns linked in an unbroken line for two hundred *lǐ*. Cavalry patrolled the shores on either side. Every prefecture and county within five hundred *lǐ* was commanded to offer tribute—some sending as much as a hundred cartloads of the rarest aquatic and terrestrial delicacies. The palace women, sated with drink, would often discard the remainder of their meals in the dirt before departing.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** The Jin lord Hécāi made a purple silk windbreak forty *lǐ* long, while Shí Chóng made a brocade windbreak fifty *lǐ* long. Recorded from the *Jìn Shū*: Shí Chóng, styled Jìlún, was by nature extravagant. At that time, the Jin lord Hécāi had made a forty-*lǐ* purple silk windbreak, and Chóng, to surpass him in wealth, made a fifty-*lǐ* brocade windbreak. Later, when his concubine Lǜzhū was executed, he went to the Eastern Market and sighed, *\"These slaves profit from my wealth!\"* The executioners replied, *\"You knew wealth could bring harm—why not disperse it earlier?\"* Chóng had no answer.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** The Later Han official Mǎ Liáo submitted a memorial stating that in the capital, men favored wide sleeves. Recorded: In the first year of the *Jiànchū* era (76 CE) under Emperor Zhāng of Later Han, he issued an edict to correct customs and promote virtue, which must have its origin. The *Shū* says: *\"King Wú of the State of Wú loved swordsmen, and the people were many with wounds.\"* *\"King Fēn of the State of Zhāo delighted in slender waists, and many starved to death in the palace.\"* The people of Cháng’ān would say: *\"In the capital, men favor tall hairdos—so the four quarters raise their hair by a foot.\"* *\"In the capital, men favor broad eyebrows—so the four quarters pluck theirs to half their foreheads.\"* *\"In the capital, men favor wide sleeves—so the four quarters wear entire bolts of silk.\"* Though these words seem like jest, they reflect reality.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** Wearing sharp blades, like King Wú of Wú, who commissioned the smith Gān Jiāng to forge swords. The swords came in two forms: one called *Gān Jiāng*, the other *Mòyē*. The earlier records mention the same.\n\nRecorded from the *Zhuāngzǐ* [\"说剑篇\"] *Shuō Jiàn* chapter: In ancient times, King Wén of Zhāo—also known as Zhāo Hùiwén Wáng—was the son of Zhāo Líng Wáng. He loved swords, and three thousand or more swordsmen gathered at his gates, day and night clashing before him, with hundreds dying or wounded. Yet he never tired of it. Thus for three years, until his realm declined and the feudal lords conspired against him.\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** If Hé Zéng of the Jin dynasty ate ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, he would still claim there was no place to set his chopsticks. Recorded: During the reign of Jin Wǔdì, the Chancellor Hé Zéng, styled Yǐngkǎo, consumed ten thousand coins’ worth of food daily, yet still complained there was no place to set his chopsticks. He would not eat steamed buns unless they were cut into ten pieces. At that time, the general Qín Xiù remarked, *\"Zéng’s arrogance and excess are beyond measure—he should be posthumously named with a shameful title.\"* A title that does not match the person’s deeds is called *miù* (谬), and one who flouts order and behaves wantonly is called *chǒu* (丑).\n\n**Elaborated meaning:** King Zhòu of the Shang dynasty hoarded the wealth of Lùtái and amassed the grain of Jiǔqiáo. Recorded: King Zhòu of the Shang accumulated wealth without dispersing it, filled his granaries without knowing contentment. The *Shàngshū* states: When King Wǔ of the Zhōu defeated the Shang, he declared, *\"Scatter the wealth of Lùtái and distribute the grain of Jiǔqiáo, bestow bounty upon all under heaven, and the myriad peoples will rejoice and submit.\"*»\n\nThe *Elaborated Meanings of the Daoist Classic* concludes here.\nThe *Daoist Classic’s Elaborated Meanings* continue in the fifteenth scroll.",

      "translated_text": "The extended meaning states: *\"All treasures flourish abundantly.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Gēngsāng Chú*]:\n\nThe Master said: *\"How do my disciples differ from me? When spring qi arises, all grasses sprout; when autumn arrives, all treasures mature.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"This is what is meant by using its remnants to govern people.\"* *\"This is what is meant by using its dregs to govern the state.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Ràng Wáng Piān*]:\n\n*\"The true Dao is used to cultivate the self. Its remnants are used to govern the state; its dregs are used to govern the world. Therefore, one observes the self to understand the self, the family to understand the family, the village to understand the village, the state to understand the state, and the world to understand the world. How do I know the world is thus? By this.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"The Yijing says: 'Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.'\" It is a matter of reflecting inward and seeking within oneself.\"* Quoting the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five line:\n\n*\"Nine-five: Observe my life, and the gentleman will have no blame.*\n*The Commentary says: 'Observe my life'—this means observing the people.*\n*Master Bào’s interpretation says: This nine-five line, with its gentle yet upright position, embodies the just and central. It embodies yielding compliance to cultivate virtue, and uses rectitude to govern the people, becoming the sovereign of great observation. Yet those below follow those above, like shadows responding to form; the people follow the ruler, like clay shaped by the potter’s wheel. If you show them evil, evil will take root; if you lead them with goodness, goodness will flourish. Transformation begins from the self, and its influence extends to the four seas. To examine one’s virtue, first observe the people. When the gentleman’s conduct is exemplary, there will be no blame.*\n\n*Thus, this line from the *Guàn* hexagram’s ninth-five is cited to verify the meaning of 'How do I know the world is thus?'—speaking of the five methods of observation, and knowing the world through observing its people.\"*\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\n*\"The depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant. Poisonous insects do not sting, fierce beasts do not harm, and predatory birds do not snatch.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"If life’s blessings increase daily, the depth of virtue will diminish.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Dé Chóng Fú Piān*]:\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: *\"Is it true that humans have no emotions?\"*\nZhuangzi replied: *\"Yes.\"*\nHuizi said: *\"If humans have no emotions, why call them human?\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"The Dao gives them form, Heaven gives them shape—how could they not be called human?\"*\nHuizi said: *\"If they are called human, how can they lack emotions?\"*\nZhuangzi said: *\"This is not what I call emotion. What I call 'no emotion' is that humans do not let their likes and dislikes internally harm themselves; they follow nature without excess.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Silent, as if having lost their mate.\"* Quoting *Zhuangzi* [□ *Qí Wù Lùn*]:\n\nNánguò Zǐqí sat leaning against his elbow, gazing upward and sighing deeply, silent as if having lost his mate. This describes the perfected sage, silent as if having lost their mate—like an infant’s innocence, so nothing can harm them.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Their harmony is in perfect accord with all things; who could harm them?\"* Quoting *Liezi* [□ *Huángdì Piān*:\n\nZhào Xiāngzǐ led ten thousand soldiers on a hunt in the mountains, setting fires to drive game. The flames scorched a hundred *li*. A man emerged from a rocky crevice, moving with the smoke’s rise and fall. The soldiers took him for a ghost. After the fire passed, he emerged slowly, as if untouched. Xiāngzǐ was astonished and detained him. Upon close inspection, his form, color, and orifices were human; his breath, voice, and manner were human. Xiāngzǐ asked: *\"What way did you dwell in stone? What way did you pass through fire?\"*\nThe man replied: *\"What do you call 'stone'? What do you call 'fire'?\"*\nXiāngzǐ said: *\"What you emerged from was stone; what you passed through was fire.\"*\nThe man said: *\"I do not know.\"*\nWhen Wèi Wénhòu heard of this, he asked Zǐxià: *\"Who is this man?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"Based on what I’ve heard from the Master, those in perfect harmony are in perfect accord with all things. Nothing can harm them, so they can wander among metals and stones, tread upon water and fire—all is possible.\"*\nWénhòu said: *\"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"He has hollowed his heart and discarded wisdom—I cannot do it either. Still, I will speak of it when I have leisure.\"*\nWénhòu said: *\"Why doesn’t my teacher do this?\"*\nZǐxià replied: *\"The Master can do it but chooses not to.\"*\nWénhòu was greatly pleased.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Like in the Spring and Autumn Annals, where Dù Bǐ compared with the daughter of the Duke of Chu, and bore a son, Wén.\"* Quoting *Spring and Autumn* (Lí Gōng 21st year): The meaning is already recorded; no need for repetition.\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Like in the *Shijing*, which says: 'When Houji was born to Jiāngléi, he was abandoned in a narrow lane, where cows and sheep trampled him. He was abandoned in a dense forest, where loggers felled trees. He was abandoned on the ice, where a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried.'\"* Quoting *Máo Shī* [*Dà Yá* • *Shēng Mín*]:\n\n*\"Revering the ancestral Houji, born to Jiāngléi, the achievements of Wén and Wǔ began with him. Thus, he was matched with Heaven. Abandoned in a narrow lane, cows and sheep trampled him. Abandoned in a dense forest, loggers felled trees. Abandoned on the ice, a bird sheltered him with its wings; the bird flew away, and Houji cried. Though his bones were frail and his sinews soft, his grip was firm. Before knowing the union of male and female, his vigor was already strong—the peak of vital essence. He cried all day, yet his throat did not grow hoarse—the peak of harmony.\"*\n\nThe extended meaning states: *\"Zhuangzi said: 'The true person’s breath originates from the heels; the common person’s breath originates from the throat.'\"*\nQuoting *Zhuangzi* [*Dà Zōngshī Piān*]:\n\n*\"The ancient true persons slept without dreaming, awoke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. This describes the inner breath. The true person’s breath originates from the heels—the root of the feet. The common person’s breath is shallow and labored, originating from the throat.\"*",
      "overlap_context": ".\"* Quoting *The Commentary on the Hexagrams of the Yijing [Kūn Guà Wén Yán]*:\n*\"A family that accumulates goodness will surely have abundant blessings.\nA family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering calamities.\"*\n\nWhen a subject slays his lord, or a son slays his father, such deeds are not the result of a single day or night. Their origins lie in gradual decline. From failing to discern **virtue** early, one may say: *\"Those who govern states and families can they not take warning?\"*",

Huan Gōng said: 'My lord reads the books, how dare the wheelwright comment? If he has understanding, let him speak; if not, let him die.' Lún Biān said: 'I observe it through my own craft. When carving wheels, if I proceed too slowly, the wood becomes soft yet unyielding; if too swiftly, it becomes bitter yet does not penetrate. Neither too slow nor too swift, I attain it with my hands and resonate it in my mind—yet my mouth cannot speak it. There is a measure inherent within this process. I cannot teach my craft to my son, nor can my son receive it from me, hence at seventy years old I am still a wheelwright. The ancients’ true teachings could not be transmitted, so they died with them. Thus what you read is merely the leavings and dregs of the ancients.'*\n\n*Therefore, it cannot be grasped as near or distant, beneficial or harmful, honored or degraded—yet for this very reason, it is held in highest esteem by all under Heaven.*\n\n*The extended meaning states: *\"If* [Zǐ] *Lièzi lived in the Jìng gardens for forty years, yet no one recognized him.\"*\n\nQuoting from *Lièzi* [*Tiānrú Piān*]:\n\n*\"Zǐ Lièzi dwelled in the Jìng gardens for forty years, and no one knew him.

      "translated_text": "The **Dao/Way** section’s text states:\n\n*\"The scope of its meaning is: Even the petty theft of hooks may escalate to the grand scale of usurping a state—such as Tian Chengzi [田成子], who in a single day assassinated the Qi king [齐君] and stole his realm. What he stole was not merely the kingdom—he also took its sacred laws and virtuous governance. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief, yet enjoyed the security of Yao [尧] and Shun [舜]. Small states dared not oppose him, and great states dared not punish him; twelve generations held Qi’s sovereignty. The scope of its meaning is: Li Si [李斯] advised Er Shi [二世] to employ the **supervision and punishment** technique to suppress theft. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the second winter of Er Shi’s reign in the Qin [秦], the Second Emperor frequently rebuked Li Si, who held the Three Ducal positions [三公]. How could it be that theft persisted under such authority? Li Si, fearful and trembling, enriched his titles and ranks, unsure of his fate, and thus curried Er Shi’s favor, replying in writing: The sage ruler must be capable of employing the **supervision and punishment** technique. Hence, Shen Zi [申子] said: ‘He who holds the world yet does not indulge in wantonness, but instead treats the world as a shackle upon himself—there is no other reason than his inability to supervise and punish, while instead burdening himself with the labor of the people, like Yao and Yu [尧、禹]. Thus, he is called a shackle.’ If one cannot practice the clear techniques of Shen and Han [申、韩], nor follow the **Dao/Way of supervision and punishment**, but instead merely seeks to gratify himself with the world’s ease, while exhausting his own form and spirit to serve the people, then he is but a drudge for the common folk—not one who nurtures the world. What is there to honor in this? Therefore, the enlightened ruler employs the **supervision and punishment** technique to make absolute judgments from above, so that authority rests not in his ministers. Then he can extinguish the paths of benevolence and righteousness, sever the eloquence of persuasive speech, and halt the clamor of carts and horses. The Leftist School [左氏] was particularly adept at this. Yet, though his heart yearned for wantonness, none dared resist him. Thus, the ministers and people could not even offer timely warnings of errors—who would dare to plot change? Er Shi was pleased, and so the **supervision and punishment** grew ever stricter: those who taxed the people heavily were hailed as sagacious historians; those who killed many were called loyal ministers. Half of the travelers on the roads were under sentence, and corpses piled daily in the markets; the Qin people grew ever more terrified and prone to rebellion. The scope of its meaning is: Han Wudi [汉武帝] entrusted Zhang Tang [张汤] and Zhao Yu [赵禹] to codify the laws. Quoted from *The Comprehensive Mirror* [通鉴]: In the fifth year of the *Jian Yuan* era [建元], the Emperor commissioned the Grand Master of Justice Zhang Tang and the Middle Master of Justice Zhao Yu to jointly revise the legal codes. The decree emphasized harsh interpretations and binding officials to their duties. Zhang Tang’s biography was recorded, and his method of ‘**foresightful legal scholars**’ [见知法史] was adopted, with officials mutually overseeing each other’s application of the law, growing ever stricter from this point onward. Zhao Yu’s biography was also recorded. Hence, the sages proclaimed: ‘I take no action, yet the people transform themselves. I involve myself in no affairs, yet the people grow rich. I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves. I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.’ The scope of its meaning is: Like Yao and Shun, who were silent and still in their governance, reclining in their halls while the people flourished. Quoted from the words of *Yangzi* [杨子] in *The Inquiry into the Dao/Way* [问道篇]: ‘In ancient times, Yu and Xia [虞、夏] inherited Yao’s title and followed Yao’s Dao/Way. The laws were clear, and the rites and music were established. They ruled with ease, their hands folded in their sleeves, and the people flourished. *Fu* [阜] means *rich* [富]. They reclined with folded sleeves upon the rocky veranda, observing the people’s natural prosperity.’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘**Wen** [文] and **Wu** [武] neither knew nor recognized [不识不知], yet they conformed to the Heavenly Emperor’s will. With folded sleeves and hands at rest, the world was governed.’ Quoted from the words in *The Mao Commentary* [毛诗] on *The Great Odes* [大雅], *The Sovereign’s Majesty* [皇矣篇]: ‘The Emperor spoke to King Wen: “I cherish the virtue/power of the people, neither raising my voice nor showing favor, neither prolonging summers nor shortening winters, not knowing nor recognizing—yet I follow the Heavenly Emperor’s will.”’ The scope of its meaning is: ‘Like Cao Can [曹参], who served as Han’s chancellor, where Hui Di [惠帝] criticized him for not attending to affairs. The account in the *Book of Han* [汉书] has already been cited—no need to repeat it here.’ His governance is described in *The Fifth and Eighty Chapter of the Bright and Virtuous* [闷闷章第五十八].\"",

      "translated_text": "This is the third failure to persist.\n\nIn the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty honed your reputation and integrity, took nothing for yourself, and associated only with the virtuous. You cherished the upright and distanced the petty.\n\nNow it is not so. You treat the petty lightly, familiarizing yourself with them and drawing near. To be intimate with the petty is not the Dao of governance. To distance the upright is not the virtue of a flourishing state. This is the fourth failure to persist.\n\nIn the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty modeled yourself after the sage-kings of Tang and Yu, reducing gold and returning to simplicity. In recent years, however, you have taken delight in rare and difficult-to-obtain treasures, sparing no effort to acquire them—no matter how distant. Your fondness for luxuries has grown, yet the pursuit of substance remains unattainable. This is the fifth failure to persist.\n\nIn the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty sought the worthy as if parched. Those recommended by the virtuous were trusted and entrusted. In recent years, however, you favor and detest those whom the virtuous condemn, and those you recommend are not necessarily trustworthy. A lifetime of conduct does not vanish in an instant. Moreover, the upright cultivate benevolence and magnanimity, while the petty thrive on slander and calumny for their own gain. If Your Majesty does not discern their roots but lightly judges them, you drive the steadfast from the path while advancing the scheming, causing men to seek only to evade blame and exert no true effort. This is the sixth failure to persist.\n\nWhen Your Majesty first ascended the throne, you abolished the hunting grounds within and cut off the sources of the chase without. Yet after several years, you could not sustain your resolve. Though you did not indulge in prolonged hunts, you sometimes exceeded the proper rites of the three drives, making the pleasures of the chase visible to the people and the tribute of falcons and hounds reaching even to the distant barbarians. You depart at dawn and return only at night, finding joy in galloping, heedless of unforeseen calamities. Once such recklessness takes hold, how can it be rectified? This is the seventh failure to persist.\n\nConfucius said: *\"A ruler governs his ministers with propriety, and a minister serves his ruler with loyalty.\"* When Your Majesty first took the throne, you received your subjects with reverence, and the benevolence of the ruler flowed downward while the loyalty of the ministers ascended. In recent years, however, you have neglected much. When they wish to speak, your demeanor is not welcoming; when they wish to petition, your grace is not extended. You often seize upon their faults and interrogate them over trivial errors. Even with the most eloquent arguments, none can fully express their loyalty. How then can you expect harmony between ruler and subjects, or mutual trust between sovereign and minister? This is the eighth failure to persist.\n\nArrogance must not be indulged, desires must not be gratified, pleasures must not be carried to excess, and ambition must not be sated. In the early Zhenguan era, Your Majesty diligently governed, bending yourself to serve others. Yet in recent years, you have subtly grown proud, relying on the grandeur of your achievements, and scorned the wisdom of past sages. You look down upon the present age—this is the growth of arrogance. Though you may suppress your inclinations and follow counsel, you cannot forget it—this is the gratification of desire. Your mind is set on amusement, your heart knows no satiety. Though you have not entirely abandoned governance, you no longer devote yourself wholly to the Dao—this is pleasure nearing its peak. The land is at peace, the barbarians submit, yet you still exhaust the soldiers and horses, punishing distant tribes—this is ambition nearing fulfillment. This is the ninth failure to persist.\n\nIn the time of Yao and Tang, or Shun and Wu, there were no absent disasters. Yet they were called sages because they had both beginning and end, doing nothing and desiring nothing. In recent years, however, the people have been weary from labor, and those of the Central Plains are especially exhausted. The artisans of the capital are all detained daily for forced labor. The soldiers of the regular armies are frequently sent on separate expeditions. The markets of the villages are never empty of conscripts, and the roads are filled with relays of forced laborers.",

      "translated_text": "The harm once taken root, it is easy to be startled and disturbed. Should drought or flood strike, and the grain and wheat fail to harvest, the people’s hearts may not remain as settled as before. This is the tenth failure to persist.\n\n**On External Treasures:**\nThe common world values gold, jade, pearls, and jewels. The *Qianziwen* commentary states: *\"Gold is born in Lishui.\"* Lishui is in Yongchang Commandery of Yizhou, where gold often floats to the surface—all of it superior quality. Jade comes from the southern Kun Mountain. In the valleys of Kun Mountain in Chu and Jing, fine jade is found. Pearls, sometimes called *nightlight*, may reach an inch in diameter, their glow illuminating twelve chariots. *Bao* refers to rare and precious plants, minerals, feathers, and furs—whatever the world holds dear. Yet these external treasures, sought beyond measure, exhaust life and harm nature. Unlike the Daoist ruler, who treasures virtue, or the cultivator, who values the Way alone, they do not covet what lies beyond. Thus, they preserve their natural state, unburdened by rare and costly goods.\n\n**Chapter 65: The Difficulty of Governing the People**\nThe people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive. Therefore, ruling by cleverness is ruinous to the state, while not ruling by cleverness brings fortune.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nZhuangzi said: *\"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder.\"* The *Zhuangzi* [\"Bùkē Qìe\" (器蠹)] states:\n*\"If the ruler sincerely loves cleverness but lacks the Way, the world will fall into great disorder. How do we know this? When the cleverness of crossbows, snares, and mechanical traps increases, birds are thrown into confusion above. The net is small and fine, resembling the star *Bi*, hence its name. Shooting with a bowstring is called *yi*. The crossbow’s trigger is called *ji*. When the cleverness of hooks, bait, and nets increases, fish are thrown into confusion in the water. *Gǔ* and *zhuì* are both nets; *sǔn* is also a trap. Hooks are fishing hooks; bait is fish bait. When the cleverness of *xuēgé*—the frames for spreading nets—and *luòluò*, *jiéfú* increases, beasts are thrown into confusion in the marshes. The *Erya* says: Nets for birds are called *luò*; nets for hares are called *jié* or *fú*—all are hare nets. Cleverness in deceit, gradual poisoning, and sophistry—such as *jiéhuá* (pretense of knowledge), *jiānbái* (rigid argument), and convoluted speech—when excessive, confuses the people with debate. The *Xihua* Master’s commentary states: *\"Cleverness in calculation, deceit, and gradual corruption harms things. Jiéhuá is probing; jiānbái is rigid argument; sophistry and pretense are deceitful.\"* The cleverness of rigid argument and the sophistry of *jiān* (contradiction) and *bái* (dogmatic assertion), along with the deceit of *jié* (pretense) and *tóngyì* (false agreement), all deviate from true principle. Thus, the world often falls into great disorder, the fault lying in the love of cleverness. For true sages, wisdom is a sharp tool for the state.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nTake Emperor Ming of Han, whose narrow and scrutinizing nature—\n*The Han Shu* records this in detail; no need for repetition.\n\n**Chapter 66: The River and Sea as Kings of All Valleys**\nThe river and sea reign over all valleys because they excel in humility, thus becoming kings of all valleys.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"The Earth’s Way transforms fullness into flowing humility.\"* The *Yi* [\"Qian\" (谦) Hexagram] states:\n*\"Qian (Humility) is auspicious. The Heavenly Way descends to aid and shines brightly. The Earthly Way is low yet ascends. The Heavenly Way diminishes fullness and increases humility. The Earthly Way transforms fullness into flowing humility. Ghosts and spirits harm fullness but bless humility. Human nature abhors fullness and loves humility. Humility is exalted yet uncrossable; the virtuous person’s end is thus. Therefore, the sage, wishing to surpass others, speaks humbly. Wishing to lead others, places himself last. Thus, though in high position, he is not burdensome; though in front, he does no harm. Therefore, the world gladly follows without tiring.\"*\n\n**Elaboration:**\nYet the sage knows that fullness invites loss.\n*The Shangshu* [\"Dà Yǔ Mó\" (大禹谟)] states:\n*\"Thirty days, the people rebelled against the command. Yi Zhan advised Yu: 'Only virtue moves Heaven, reaching even the distant. Fullness invites loss; humility invites gain. This is the Way of Heaven.'\"*\nIt further cites *\"restraining oneself in humility and retreat\"*—the fourth line of *Qian* is without misfortune, for those who do not violate principle move in accord with reason, thus facing no adversity.\n\n**Elaboration:**\nAs in *Zhuangzi*, where Duke Ai of Lu asked Zhongni:\n*The Zhuangzi* [\"Dé Chōng Fú\" (德充符)] states:",

for deep penetration, straightness.\nThe horn should be green-white with a full tip.\nGenerally, autumn-killed horn is thick, spring-killed horn is thin.\nThe horn of young oxen is straight and glossy; that of old oxen is curved and rough.\nWhen the three colors are complete, it is excellent—\nThen in winter, dry the wood;\nIn summer, treat the sinew;\nIn spring, soften the horn;\nIn autumn, combine silk, glue, and lacquer.\nWhen the form is set in cold, the bow neither sags nor strains.\nWith fine materials and skilled craftsmanship, made at the right time,\nThis is called *Sanjun* [Three Harmonies].\n\n**Elucidations:**\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Establishing the Dao/Way of Heaven: yin and yang.\"*\n*Quoted from the Zhouyi’s* Sayings on the Trigrams:\n*\"In ancient times, the Sage composed the Changes*\n*To align with the principles of nature and life.*\nThus, the Dao/Way of Heaven is established as yin and yang,\nThe Dao/Way of Earth as softness and hardness,\nThe Dao/Way of Humanity as virtue and righteousness.\nCombining the Three Powers and pairing them,\nThus the Changes form six lines into a hexagram.\nDividing yin and yang, alternating softness and hardness,\nThus the Changes form six positions into a chapter.\"\n\n**Elucidations:**\nThe sun and moon, cold and heat,\nCome and go in turn—\nThus, the excessive is diminished.\nWhat departs is given to the deficient,\nAnd the year’s work is fulfilled.\n*Quoted from the Yi System:*\n*\"The sun departs, the moon arrives;
