  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Sui-Tang period.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine Perfected on the Fivefold Return and Thrice Reversion in the Practice of the Daoist Observances* expounds the method of cultivating the five gates of observation. One fascicle. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Tai Xuan Section.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Good men and women who cultivate the true Way must observe without desire, subtly perceiving the true mind, penetratingly and luminously illumined. Thoughts of conditioned action arise in the present mind, yet they do not originate from the illuminating mind; one knows and grasps the dharmas of the mind. Simply understand the mind and the dharmas of the mind; do not generate the understanding of the mind and the dharmas of the mind. Let the mind be quiescent; do not generate the quiescence of the quiescent mind. Let quiescence be non-quiescence; do not make non-quiescence non-quiescent.\n\nIt further states: Wood without fire and earth without fire—these two are alike in their absence. Wood without fire and wood without man—these two are alike in their absence. The mind without knowing and wood without knowing—these two are alike in their absence. The mind without knowing and the mind without wood—these two are alike in their absence. Within sameness, confusion arises, thus grasping the true leads to error. Beyond sameness, severance occurs, thus grasping the true leads to nothingness. Therefore, within the great chaos, there are immeasurable natures; the immeasurable natures all depend on the true nature. Through karmic resonance, forms are generated—like fire arising from wood, like knowing arising from the mind. They manifest and transform in the world, impermanent and subject to arising and ceasing. The true nature of the Dao is fundamentally without arising or ceasing. Those who purify their minds and unite with the Dao thereby return to the root and recover the true constancy of life.\n\nAt that time, a verse was intoned within the Mystery:\n\nKnowing arises from conditions,\nFire is born from causes.\nEach is a true seed-nature,\nYet riding the current, the source of the Dao is lost.\nTo still knowing by arousing the mind,\nThe mind arises, and knowing becomes more vexed.\nUnderstanding that the nature is fundamentally empty,\nKnowing is the gate of all wonders.\n\nThe Dao speaks: When uncarved wood is fashioned into vessels, one rides the current of discriminating consciousness and perceives objects. Within the dharmas of perceiving objects, there are four deluded knowings: first, the knowing of the inner mind; second, the knowing of external objects; third, the shared knowing of both; fourth, the abandonment of knowing. Yet these deluded knowings are merely names; apart from these four delusions, there is no separate truth. Why is this so? Knowing is not two, hence the delusion of inner and outer. Knowing is not one, hence the delusion of the middle. Knowing is not nonexistent, hence the delusion of severance. Knowing is not existent, hence the delusion of constancy. Therefore, the perception of objects is like dew, like bubbles.\n\nIt is also said: Ordinary beings create marvels as illusions; sages manifest transformations through spiritual powers. Echoes, reflections, dreams, and imaginings are all empty; grasping sameness as truth is erroneous. Only with the power of wisdom can one luminously illumine the true. Understanding the mind is the Dao; the true and the deluded are not two. Without abandoning inner and outer, the true and the deluded are not one. As objects appear, consciousness arises; as consciousness arises, objects are seen. Consciousness and objects have no fixed existence or nonexistence. Without before or after, neither constant nor severed, ultimately pure and quiescent, perfectly tranquil and unconditioned, naturally and spontaneously, one ascends to the fruit of the Great Unity. This is the returning to the Dao, reverting to the root and the true constancy.\n\nAt that time, a verse was intoned in the void:\n\nUncarved wood fashioned into vessels,\nImages of wheels emerge from the formless.\nHolding the center without faltering in faith,\nOne rides the current, revolving through life and death.\nConsciousness and objects arise interdependently,\nInner and outer deluded knowings are formed.\nUnderstanding that the true and the deluded are one,\nThe mind returns and merges with the Dao.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From green to yellow is the wave; abandoning green and other colors to enter the eye is the return to the body. From the eye to the ear is the wheel of consciousness; abandoning the eye and other sense organs to return to the mind is the return to spirit. From thought to thought is arising and ceasing; abandoning thoughts and other numerical states to revert to quiescence is the return to life. Returning to life and uniting with the Dao, the Dao also unites with it. Inner and outer are equally true, free and unimpeded. The nature of unimpededness pervades the dharma-realm, universally penetrating the Dao-eye. It illumines all forms and characteristics; green and other characteristics appear within the Dao-eye. The eye and the characteristics are neither identical nor separate. They equally abide in the true essence, neither severed nor constant.\n\nWithin this dharma, a verse was intoned:\n\nWhen the mind is pure, the true root appears,\nWhen the root is pure, the wondrous object is revealed.\nThe wondrous object now communicates with the mind,\nThe mind is clear, and life is constantly returned.\nThe Dao-mind is fundamentally not two,\nYet it flows together in the five destinies.\nDetached from things, detached from life and death,\nNeither human nor Daoist realm.\n\nThe Dao speaks: From Yi to Qin is transmigration; from human to ghost is hastening through the realms. From the mundane to the immortal is escaping death; from the ordinary to the sage is returning to constancy. Returning to constancy and recovering life, recovering life and realizing the Dao, the nature of the Dao is limpid and pure, universally and perfectly luminous. Thus, it can uphold and illumine all characteristics such as Yi. Characteristics and nature are interdependent; dependent, thoughts arise. Thoughts do not abide; they arise and cease together. This arising and ceasing nature neither arises nor ceases, neither arises nor ceases, hence it is neither provisional nor real. Therefore, all Daoist realms enter into the great nature of the Dao, transcending conditioned existence and departing from all karmic characteristics.\n\nAt that time, within this nature, a verse was intoned:\n\nThe realms of Yi, Qin, and others,\nThrough karmic resonance, share the same abode.\nThe paths of humans and ghosts differ,\nYet existence and nonexistence do not obstruct each other.\nEscaping death, one practices the return to the Dao,\nRecovering life, one reverts to true constancy.\nWith a limpid mind and a pure Dao-eye,\nAll wonders appear in their directions.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The four dharma-gates practiced by the Perfected—if heavenly beings, humans, men, and women cultivate them without laxity, they will ascend to the unconditioned and unite with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe Dao speaks: The true wonder of virtue and the Dao embodies the primordial and boundless. It pervades yin and yang, congeals the numinous in heaven and earth, scatters essence and disperses simplicity, shaping and forming all things. The resonance of forms and categories is not subject to karmic conditions; the responses of karmic nature unfold in myriad ways. The dark and mysterious origin of the karmic realm neither increases nor decreases. Only life and death, through defilement, become causes. The Nine Hells and the Five Perfected, riding the currents of action, receive their retribution.\n\nWhat are the Nine Hells?\n1. The first is the Hell of Violating the Great Dao: contracting the profound darkness, naturally receding, the true constancy is concealed. The measuring ghosts afflict the dharma-body, and one receives the hidden retribution of the Pure and True Hell. The Jade Emperor presides over it, maintaining equanimity while bearing the transgression.\n\nSecond is the Hell of Violating the Dark Virtue: losing the origin of transformation, purity receives turbidity, and the utmost nature surges. The deluded ghosts afflict the seed-consciousness, and one receives the karmic retribution of the Three Bonds Hell. The Heavenly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining restlessness while bearing the transgression.\n\nThird is the Hell of Violating the Nature’s Origin: arising defiled emotions, the mysterious essence is lost, and true wisdom is submerged. The grotesque ghosts afflict the conditional body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Final Beginning Hell. The Earthly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining delusion while bearing the transgression.\n\nFourth is the Hell of Violating Rational Nature: pursuing chaos and vexation, the nature of intent is deluded, and the origin of consciousness is impaired. The deceitful ghosts afflict the square body, and one receives the destructive retribution of the Five Relations Hell. The Human Sovereign presides over it, maintaining suffering while bearing the transgression.\n\nFifth is the Hell of Violating Trust and Practicing Deceit: the mouth is obstructed and the spleen labored. The Azure Heaven ghosts afflict the abandoned will and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Universal Plunder Hell. The Yellow Emperor presides over it, maintaining flogging while bearing the transgression.\n\nSixth is the Hell of Violating Benevolence and Practicing Killing: the eyes darken and the liver decays. The White Heaven ghosts afflict the scattered soul and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Wind and Thunder Hell. The Green Emperor presides over it, maintaining blades while bearing the transgression.\n\nSeventh is the Hell of Violating Righteousness and Practicing Robbery: the nose is blocked and the lungs wither. The Vermilion Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Vajra Hell. The White Emperor presides over it, maintaining burning while bearing the transgression.\n\nEighth is the Hell of Violating Propriety and Practicing Licentiousness: the tongue is numbed and the heart startled. The Dark Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Fire Veil Hell. The Red Emperor presides over it, maintaining freezing while bearing the transgression.\n\nNinth is the Hell of Violating Wisdom and Practicing Folly: the ears deafen and the kidneys exhaust. The Black Heaven ghosts afflict the withered essence and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Profound Cold Hell. The Black Emperor presides over it, maintaining crushing while bearing the transgression.\n\nThe punishments received in these hells are measured in kalpas for the grave and in years for the light, cycling through their karmic power until the full count is reached. To depart from them, one must cultivate the Five Victories. What are the Five Victories?\n\nFirst is the initial examination of the Five Knowings, illuminating the Ten Practices, entering the Gate of Non-Delusion.\nSecond is the subsequent observation of the mind’s wisdom, understanding impermanence, entering the Gate of Arising and Ceasing.\nThird is the advanced cultivation of faith and wisdom, purifying the karmic field, entering the Gate of Returning to Stillness.\nFourth is the wondrous attainment of the seed of mystery, merging with the dark root, entering the Gate of Penetrating True Clarity.\nFifth is the defiled union with the illuminating Dao, ascending to universal brightness, entering the Gate of True Penetration and Realization.\n\nThese Five Perfected practices, when cultivated, render body and mind wondrously penetrating, fully and perfectly accomplished. One departs from impermanence and attains the True Constant Dao. The True Constant Dao pervades without limit, neither existent nor non-existent, neither constant nor discontinuous—this is the true nature of the Dao, naturally so.\n\nWithin this dharma, a verse is composed:\n\nThe True Constant sustains the Six Paths,\nTraversing realms to arise from violated ethics.\nLuminous, it abides in the wilds of stillness;\nObscure, the ten thousand images divide.\nKarmic impressions receive form and transformation;\nForms, in turn, stir mind and spirit.\nSpirit and form mutually depend,\nMovement becomes the cause of karmic return.\nNine transgressions lead to their hells;\nFive Victories ascend to their perfection.\nThe Dao’s mystery penetrates the sea of mind;\nThe mind’s mystery is the Dao’s nature.\nAs non-being, it is not the extinction of nature;\nAs being, it is not duality.\nIn things, it is neither life nor death;\nApart from things, it is not constant nor existent.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you can cultivate the Five Victories and ascend into the True Gate, you will depart from the Nine Hells, attain the supreme position, fully realize the dharma-realm, and verify the True Constant Dao.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of immortals, hearing this teaching, rejoiced in their hearts and praised in verse:\n\nThe ten directions’ boundless realms,\nOne Dao, one sentient being.\nSix destinies linked like a sinking sea,\nOne constant, one failure to succeed.\nTruth and delusion are not two realities;\nSin and merit are not empty names.\nOnly by verifying the Dao’s essence\nDo the Three Realms become the Three Purities.\n\nThe Perfected One practices the Dao and offers this verse of verification.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you wish to depart from all suffering and ascend into non-action, you must cultivate the Nine Perfected practices of advancing the Dao.\n\nThe practitioner of the Dao upholds precepts, ceases thoughts, purifies the mind, and guards the One. Externally, they sever all views; internally, they remove all defilements. Departing from the Three Existences, they verify that non-action, naturally and spontaneously attaining the supreme position.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One, hearing this teaching, attained liberation of mind. Proceeding to the Dao-ground, they received benefit according to their depth or shallowness, each praising their capacity in verse:\n\nThe first Perfected One’s verse:\nHaving understood and departed from all views,\nThe mind is still, external defilements removed.\nThe six evils and delusions are exhausted;\nThe Correct One naturally abides.\nAttaining verification of no-self,\nUtterly alone yet not solitary,\nAscending through the gates of myriad wonders,\nForever penetrating emptiness and non-being.\n\nThe second Perfected One’s verse:\nThe utmost person verifies the emptiness of dharmas,\nNature pure, internally without defilement.\nDesires and cravings already extinguished,\nWithout defilement, without anything.\nThus attaining liberation,\nUnbound by any experience,\nArriving at the ground of non-action,\nEver noble, feeding on the Mother.\n\nThe third Perfected One’s verse:\nWithout place, without end or beginning,\nNeither perishing nor abiding.\nWithout thought, without love of form,\nMysteriously uniting with the subtle and imperceptible.\nAttaining equality with the True One’s wanderings,\nTransformations beyond reckoning.\nPenetratingly vast, without form,\nAscending the mysterious, returning or not returning.\n\nThe fourth Perfected One’s verse:\nWithout emptiness, without formless,\nWithout consciousness, without habitual seeing.\nWithout mind, without non-thought,\nWithout nature, without conditioned arising.\nSpirit and form do not follow one another,\nMutually dependent yet not interpenetrating.\nForever severing the flow of life and death,\nNo suffering can reach them.\n\nThe fifth Perfected One’s verse:\nThe mind’s essence has no location,\nTrue nature abides in emptiness.\nDesires and habits already extinguished,\nSpirit penetrates into the unobstructed.\nNot abiding in any existence or emptiness,\nNot forsaking the Great Clarity’s gate.\nNaturally penetrating the wondrous seed,\nWandering and dwelling in the True Pure Heaven.\n\nThe sixth Perfected One’s verse:\nTrue nature admits no grasping or rejecting,\nThe habits of form naturally perish.\nNot exhausting conditioned action,\nNot dwelling in the Dao-ground.\nEver in the boundless realm,\nAccordant with things yet not illuminating.\nUnobstructed, without division,\nMysteriously one with the Dao’s guiding principle.\n\nThe seventh Perfected One’s verse:\nIlluminating wisdom enters dependent arising,\nSpirit radiant, surging through the Great Void.\nThe habits of form already extinguished,\nPast knots completely dissolved in emptiness.\nThus in the sea of life and death,\nAt ease in the palace of liberation.\n\nWithout arising from the Great Samādhi,\nWisdom operates boundlessly.\n\nThe eighth Perfected One’s verse:\nHeart and Dao are not two principles,\nWithout bounds, without location.\nIn function yet ever quiescent,\nWithout birth, without any master.\nTruth and delusion share the same source,\nResponding to change without fixed abode.\nThe hundred dharmas naturally unfold in clarity,\nThe three mysteries luminously manifest.\n\nThe ninth Perfected One’s verse:\nThe power of empty wisdom is self-so,\nThrough responsive realization the Dharma-body is attained.\nThe two truths are ever quiescent,\nThe three ages illumine the precious round.\nPast and present know no before or after,\nThe one who masters is no-self.\nSeven transformations have no fixed form,\nThe six penetrations are not other than spirit.\n\nAt this time, each Perfected One having recited their verses, all paid reverent respect, remained in their stations, hearts filled with joy, and arrayed in full dignity. They turned toward the Dao Lord, offered salutations, and departed.\n\n*The Scripture on the Nine Perfected Ones’ Fivefold Return and Threefold Reversion in the Practice of the Dao-Contemplation Gate of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "Second is the Hell of Violating the Dark Virtue: losing the origin of transformation, purity receives turbidity, and the utmost nature surges. The deluded ghosts afflict the seed-consciousness, and one receives the karmic retribution of the Three Bonds Hell. The Heavenly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining restlessness while bearing the transgression.\n\nThird is the Hell of Violating the Nature’s Origin: arising defiled emotions, the mysterious essence is lost, and true wisdom is submerged. The grotesque ghosts afflict the conditional body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Final Beginning Hell. The Earthly Sovereign presides over it, maintaining delusion while bearing the transgression.\n\nFourth is the Hell of Violating Rational Nature: pursuing chaos and vexation, the nature of intent is deluded, and the origin of consciousness is impaired. The deceitful ghosts afflict the square body, and one receives the destructive retribution of the Five Relations Hell. The Human Sovereign presides over it, maintaining suffering while bearing the transgression.\n\nFifth is the Hell of Violating Trust and Practicing Deceit: the mouth is obstructed and the spleen labored. The Azure Heaven ghosts afflict the abandoned will and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Universal Plunder Hell. The Yellow Emperor presides over it, maintaining flogging while bearing the transgression.\n\nSixth is the Hell of Violating Benevolence and Practicing Killing: the eyes darken and the liver decays. The White Heaven ghosts afflict the scattered soul and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Wind and Thunder Hell. The Green Emperor presides over it, maintaining blades while bearing the transgression.\n\nSeventh is the Hell of Violating Righteousness and Practicing Robbery: the nose is blocked and the lungs wither. The Vermilion Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Vajra Hell. The White Emperor presides over it, maintaining burning while bearing the transgression.\n\nEighth is the Hell of Violating Propriety and Practicing Licentiousness: the tongue is numbed and the heart startled. The Dark Heaven ghosts afflict the departed spirit and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Fire Veil Hell. The Red Emperor presides over it, maintaining freezing while bearing the transgression.\n\nNinth is the Hell of Violating Wisdom and Practicing Folly: the ears deafen and the kidneys exhaust. The Black Heaven ghosts afflict the withered essence and body, and one receives the annihilative retribution of the Profound Cold Hell. The Black Emperor presides over it, maintaining crushing while bearing the transgression.\n\nThe punishments received in these hells are measured in kalpas for the grave and in years for the light, cycling through their karmic power until the full count is reached. To depart from them, one must cultivate the Five Victories. What are the Five Victories?\n\nFirst is the initial examination of the Five Knowings, illuminating the Ten Practices, entering the Gate of Non-Delusion.\nSecond is the subsequent observation of the mind’s wisdom, understanding impermanence, entering the Gate of Arising and Ceasing.\nThird is the advanced cultivation of faith and wisdom, purifying the karmic field, entering the Gate of Returning to Stillness.\nFourth is the wondrous attainment of the seed of mystery, merging with the dark root, entering the Gate of Penetrating True Clarity.\nFifth is the defiled union with the illuminating Dao, ascending to universal brightness, entering the Gate of True Penetration and Realization.\n\nThese Five Perfected practices, when cultivated, render body and mind wondrously penetrating, fully and perfectly accomplished. One departs from impermanence and attains the True Constant Dao. The True Constant Dao pervades without limit, neither existent nor non-existent, neither constant nor discontinuous—this is the true nature of the Dao, naturally so.\n\nWithin this dharma, a verse is composed:\n\nThe True Constant sustains the Six Paths,\nTraversing realms to arise from violated ethics.\nLuminous, it abides in the wilds of stillness;\nObscure, the ten thousand images divide.\nKarmic impressions receive form and transformation;\nForms, in turn, stir mind and spirit.\nSpirit and form mutually depend,\nMovement becomes the cause of karmic return.\nNine transgressions lead to their hells;\nFive Victories ascend to their perfection.\nThe Dao’s mystery penetrates the sea of mind;\nThe mind’s mystery is the Dao’s nature.\nAs non-being, it is not the extinction of nature;\nAs being, it is not duality.\nIn things, it is neither life nor death;\nApart from things, it is not constant nor existent.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you can cultivate the Five Victories and ascend into the True Gate, you will depart from the Nine Hells, attain the supreme position, fully realize the dharma-realm, and verify the True Constant Dao.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of immortals, hearing this teaching, rejoiced in their hearts and praised in verse:\n\nThe ten directions’ boundless realms,\nOne Dao, one sentient being.\nSix destinies linked like a sinking sea,\nOne constant, one failure to succeed.\nTruth and delusion are not two realities;\nSin and merit are not empty names.\nOnly by verifying the Dao’s essence\nDo the Three Realms become the Three Purities.\n\nThe Perfected One practices the Dao and offers this verse of verification.\n\nThe Dao speaks: Good men and women, if you wish to depart from all suffering and ascend into non-action, you must cultivate the Nine Perfected practices of advancing the Dao.\n\nThe practitioner of the Dao upholds precepts, ceases thoughts, purifies the mind, and guards the One. Externally, they sever all views; internally, they remove all defilements. Departing from the Three Existences, they verify that non-action, naturally and spontaneously attaining the supreme position.\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One, hearing this teaching, attained liberation of mind. Proceeding to the Dao-ground, they received benefit according to their depth or shallowness, each praising their capacity in verse:\n\nThe first Perfected One’s verse:\nHaving understood and departed from all views,\nThe mind is still, external defilements removed.\nThe six evils and delusions are exhausted;\nThe Correct One naturally abides.\nAttaining verification of no-self,\nUtterly alone yet not solitary,\nAscending through the gates of myriad wonders,\nForever penetrating emptiness and non-being.\n\nThe second Perfected One’s verse:\nThe utmost person verifies the emptiness of dharmas,\nNature pure, internally without defilement.\nDesires and cravings already extinguished,\nWithout defilement, without anything.\nThus attaining liberation,\nUnbound by any experience,\nArriving at the ground of non-action,\nEver noble, feeding on the Mother.\n\nThe third Perfected One’s verse:\nWithout place, without end or beginning,\nNeither perishing nor abiding.\nWithout thought, without love of form,\nMysteriously uniting with the subtle and imperceptible.\nAttaining equality with the True One’s wanderings,\nTransformations beyond reckoning.\nPenetratingly vast, without form,\nAscending the mysterious, returning or not returning.\n\nThe fourth Perfected One’s verse:\nWithout emptiness, without formless,\nWithout consciousness, without habitual seeing.\nWithout mind, without non-thought,\nWithout nature, without conditioned arising.\nSpirit and form do not follow one another,\nMutually dependent yet not interpenetrating.\nForever severing the flow of life and death,\nNo suffering can reach them.\n\nThe fifth Perfected One’s verse:\nThe mind’s essence has no location,\nTrue nature abides in emptiness.\nDesires and habits already extinguished,\nSpirit penetrates into the unobstructed.\nNot abiding in any existence or emptiness,\nNot forsaking the Great Clarity’s gate.\nNaturally penetrating the wondrous seed,\nWandering and dwelling in the True Pure Heaven.\n\nThe sixth Perfected One’s verse:\nTrue nature admits no grasping or rejecting,\nThe habits of form naturally perish.\nNot exhausting conditioned action,\nNot dwelling in the Dao-ground.\nEver in the boundless realm,\nAccordant with things yet not illuminating.\nUnobstructed, without division,\nMysteriously one with the Dao’s guiding principle.\n\nThe seventh Perfected One’s verse:\nIlluminating wisdom enters dependent arising,\nSpirit radiant, surging through the Great Void.\nThe habits of form already extinguished,\nPast knots completely dissolved in emptiness.\nThus in the sea of life and death,\nAt ease in the palace of liberation.",

The first is the Hell of Violating the Great Dao: contracting the profound darkness, naturally receding, the true constancy is concealed. The measuring ghosts afflict the dharma-body, and one receives the hidden retribution of the Pure and True Hell.
