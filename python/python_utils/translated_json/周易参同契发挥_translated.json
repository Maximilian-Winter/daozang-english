  "full_translation": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Volume 14*\n*Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*\n*Daoist School*\n\n**Editorial Summary**\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully observe: *Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes* in three *juan*, with one *juan* of *Resolving Doubts*, was composed by Yu Yan of the Song. Yan’s *Collected Explanations of the Zhou Changes* has already been recorded. This work expounds the Dao of cinnabar elixirs through the water and fire, yin and yang of the human body. Though it does not match the specialized Daoist scholarship of the three commentaries by Peng Xiao, Chen Xianwei, and Chen Zhixu, its sources are exceedingly broad. Its three chapters of *Resolving Doubts* examine discrepancies and similarities, surpassing even Zhu Xi’s edition in thoroughness and clarity.\n\nThe *Catalogue of the Daoist Canon* by Yunji Daolu states that the two works together comprise fourteen *juan*, while Jiao Hong’s *Bibliographic Treatise of the History of the Realm* records twelve *juan*. Mao Jin’s *Treasured Writings from the Ford of Jin* combines Yan’s commentary with the three commentaries of Xiao and the others into a single compilation, deviating from the original. Moreover, it omits *Resolving Doubts*, which has since been lost. This edition includes illustrations in every *juan* and was printed in the third year of the Zhida era (1310) by Zhang Yufeng, the succeeding Celestial Master. It consists solely of three *juan* of *Elucidations*, with one *juan* of *Resolving Doubts* appended.\n\nAn examination of Yan’s preface to *Other Writings on the Changes* also describes the oral instructions of the cinnabar Dao as meticulously preserved in the three chapters of *Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*. The record in Yunji Daolu may have conflated this work with others, while Jiao Hong’s account appears to have been copied and distorted from other sources, rendering it increasingly unreliable.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the sixth month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign (1780).\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Feixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collators:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Preface to the Reprinted *Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes***\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Changes*, it began with Fuxi, who received the *Hetu* and drew the trigrams. King Wen expanded them and appended the hexagram statements; the Duke of Zhou extended the six positions to determine fortune and misfortune and appended the line statements. Confucius, following the *Great* and *Lesser Images*, composed the *Ten Wings*. Its fundamental principle lies in the *taiji*: when it moves, it generates yang; when it rests, it generates yin. Once the Two Modes are divided, the Four Images are established. Movement and stillness mutually serve as their root, giving rise to the Five Phases. Through the interplay of yin and yang, odd and even, the Eight Trigrams are formed. The Yellow Emperor commanded Da Rao to create the *jiazi* cycle: its ten stems and twelve branches merely explore the nature of the Five Phases, yet they too do not depart from the directional positions of the Eight Trigrams. When trigrams are doubled, they become sixty-four hexagrams; when divided, they yield three hundred eighty-four lines. Thus, there is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Man. With the Dao of the Three Powers complete, all things filling Heaven and Earth possess principle, qi, image, and number. Their waxing and waning, advance and retreat, preservation and destruction—none fall outside the sage’s compass, for he discerns and comprehends their underlying causes. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* is vast and all-encompassing. By means of it, teachings are established, and the methods of calendrical calculation and divination are founded upon the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, sufficient to disclose things and accomplish tasks, thereby guiding the people. Indeed, the *Changes* is for the counsel of the noble person—how can one not employ it?\n\nYet the world does not embody the ceaseless movement of Heaven and Earth, does not explore the mutual generation and restraint of the Five Phases, nor follow the ebb and flow of hexagrams and lines. Acting recklessly, they fail to return to themselves, unaware of what cultivation and refinement entail. Few are those who preserve their seven-foot bodies and return them whole. How much less can they hope for longevity and enduring vision amidst Heaven and Earth?\n\nThose of the immortal lineage who attain longevity and enduring vision do so through the Dao of the returned elixir. However, the immortals of antiquity necessarily possessed esoteric transmission and oral instruction; their secret formulas were seldom lightly disclosed. Thus, few accounts of them exist in the world. Some, not following the great Dao but relying on private cleverness, claim that crooked shortcuts are easily traversed or that heterodox byways lead to attainment. The worst of them consume desiccating medicines, drink noxious drafts, and ingest poisonous pellets, mistaking them for divine elixirs—only to lose their lives and forfeit their years. How can they preserve longevity?\n\nBy the Later Han, Wei Boyang recognized that the Dao of the returned elixir must not be led astray by perverse doctrines but must be rooted in the Dao of the *Changes*. For the Dao of the *Changes* encompasses the mechanism of yin and yang, movement and stillness, and embraces the marvel of hexagram and line transformation—ceaselessly generating, endlessly transforming. Now, when we turn inward to observe our bodies, are they not also a Heaven and Earth? The primordial qi we receive is none other than the qi of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth endure, why can we not emulate them?\n\nThis is why the *Cantong qi* was composed. *Can* means to consult the *Changes* and find no error; *tong* means to align with the *Changes* and find no discrepancy; *qi* means to silently comprehend and naturally preserve the *Changes*. Formerly, I heard that the immortals of old possessed the method of refining the elixir. Once the elixir was completed, one could ascend in flight, achieving longevity. Thus, the famous mountains and scenic places of the world all bear the strange traces of furnaces and crucibles. Alas! The odd stones in the mountains that occasionally resemble furnaces and crucibles are but coincidences. Upon reading this book, I realized that the notion of refining the elixir in furnaces and crucibles is delusion. The teachings of the immortals on guiding and refining cultivation operate within; they do not rely on external means. What is taken lies within oneself; it does not depend on...\n\nWhat is sought lies within oneself, not in external things. Gold, for instance, is prized for its purity—unmixed, unadulterated. Without refining it with lead and mercury through fire, how could one attain its true essence, its unyielding hardness, to form the elixir and emulate the immortality of Heaven and Earth? Now, the *Cantong qi* borrows this principle: it takes the Qian and Kun of one’s body as the crucible, the Kan and Li—the sun and moon—as the medicinal ingredients. By concentrating the spirit and gathering the *qi*, causing the Dragon and Tiger to unite in essence and interact, advancing the fire phases to await their transformations, the Dao of the elixir may be accomplished.\n\nYet this book, though examined and annotated by Master Zhu Ziyang, still leaves many doubts unresolved. Though it provides a thread of understanding, the very materials and apertures remain obscure—how much more so for those beneath Master Zhu’s level of insight? In the Zhiyuan era, Master Yuyu, Quanyangzi, first delved deeply into this text. Initially, he failed to grasp its subtleties, finding it exceedingly difficult. Only through long accumulation of effort and unwavering faith did enlightenment come as if by divine revelation. Thereafter, he gathered the secret formulas of various perfected ones and compared them with this book, finding no discrepancy with the teachings of the *Changes*. Thus, he expounded upon this work, adding annotations that illuminated the Dao of the elixir as clearly as pointing to one’s palm.\n\nYet while the method of the returned elixir is said to be supremely simple and easy—accessible to all—it is also spoken of as requiring three years and nine cycles, appearing easy but proving difficult in truth. It demands prolonged dedication. Therefore, those who study the Dao in hopes of becoming immortals must not measure it hastily or glimpse it superficially. They must seek its doors and windows, examine its gates and pivots, wield the bellows and key, advance the fire phases, and guard the Dragon and Tiger until their union. Then the Yellow Sprout will grow of itself, the Jade Flower will manifest, and the Dao of the returned elixir will be within reach.\n\nWith this, one may ascend in flight, achieve eternal existence, ride the long clouds between the eight poles, and brave the fierce winds of the nine heavens—utterly severed from the world, dwelling in the divine isles, forever ascending the immortal’s throne. Once in a hundred generations, one descends to wander among mortals, bestowing long life and salvation, while none can fathom their whereabouts. Looking down upon the ephemeral world, where mayflies flicker in the morning and gnats rise and fall, it is truly not worth even a laugh.\n\n*Preface to the* Elucidation of the *Cantong qi*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Elucidation of the* Cantong qi*, Volume One*\n*Upper Chapter*\n*By Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty*\n\nThe Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. One closing and one opening is called *change*; endless coming and going is called *communication*—this is why Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*. Qian gives birth to three sons; Kun gives birth to three daughters. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born—this is why Qian and Kun are the father and mother of all hexagrams.\n\nThe human body models Heaven and emulates Earth, sharing the same yin and yang as Heaven and Earth. If one understands that this body shares the same yin and yang with Heaven and Earth, then one may discuss the Dao of the returned elixir.\n\nKan and Li form the encompassing frame, turning the wheel with the axle as its center. Kan is the moon; Li is the sun. The sun and moon travel along the ecliptic, circulating endlessly day and night, like the revolving frame of a wheel. The hub is like the body; the axle is like the heart. If one wishes the hub to turn, one must align the axle. For those who cultivate the returned elixir, circulating the sun and moon within their body to follow the same path as Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations—how could they not rectify their heart?\n\nThe four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the bellows and pipe, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer holds the reins and bit with precision, adhering to the guiding line, following the tracks, maintaining the center to regulate the exterior. The numbers are recorded in the calendar’s monthly nodes: five or six weave the warp and weft, serving the sun to combine into sixty. Hard and soft have their inner and outer aspects. At dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs; at dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, used in sequence. Before reaching the dim light of dawn, the cycle ends and begins anew.\n\nQian is the pure yang, male hexagram; Kun is the pure yin, female hexagram. Kan contains yang within yin; Li contains yin within yang—these are the hexagrams of female and male union. The elixir method positions Qian and Kun above and below, arranges Kan and Li to the east and west, so that the opening and closing of Qian and Kun, the coming and going of Kan and Li, resemble the form of bellows and pipe. Thus it is said: \"The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipe.\" The bellows and pipe are empty vessels—the bellows is the leather sack, the pipe its tube. The *Daodejing* of Laozi states: \"Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?\" Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-producing. The great void’s vastness resembles the body of the bellows; the opening and closing, coming and going of qi resemble its function. Knowing this, one has grasped more than half of the Dao of the returned elixir.\n\nYet this Dao exists when grasped and perishes when released. Therefore, one must guard one’s inner realm and restrain one’s outer conduct, as in the *Liezi: Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing*, which speaks of the charioteering of the Taidou clan. Only then may one engage in this practice. For the charioteering of the Taidou clan is to harmonize the reins and bit with utmost precision, adjusting swiftly or slowly as needed.\n\nThe harmony of lips and tongue is precisely measured within the chest, while rhythm is maintained in the grip of the hands. Between palm and grasp, the center is inwardly attained, and outwardly, the horse’s will is met. Thus can one advance and retreat as if treading a taut line, or turn and curve as if compass and square. The method of refining the elixir is likewise.\n\nThe numbers in the *lü* and calendric reckonings circulate through twelve positions: twelve pitches of the *lü* correspond to twelve months, and twelve years to a cycle. The monthly nodes of five and six arise from dividing a thirty-day month into six nodes. The warp is the fixed positions of Qian and Kun, north and south; the weft is the subtle workings of Kan and Li, east and west. The \"servant of the sun\" follows the sun’s command, its timing moving in perfect accord with the heavens, rising and setting without the slightest deviation.\n\nThe combination yields sixty: the *Book of Changes* has sixty-four hexagrams, but excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, exactly sixty remain. Each day has twelve hours, with two hexagrams governing affairs, each line corresponding to one hour—two hexagrams totaling twelve lines, matching the numbers of the *lü* and calendric reckonings. Combined with a thirty-day month, this yields sixty hexagrams. Arranging sixty hexagrams within a thirty-day month, at dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* governs the morning and *Meng* the evening; day and night’s twelve hours precisely correspond to two hexagrams and twelve lines. From there, morning *Xu* and evening *Song*, morning *Shi* and evening *Bi*, follow in sequence until the month’s end, when *Jiji* and *Weiji* are used. From dark moon to new moon, the cycle repeats endlessly. Within these hexagrams, the inner and outer, hard and soft bodies may reverse or oppose one another—none of this need be rigidly adhered to.\n\nAs Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Herein grasp the meaning, seek not the image;\nTo exhaust the lines is but to labor in vain.\"*\nFor the sixty hexagrams are not rigidly assigned within a thirty-day month.\n\nSome, failing to comprehend this principle, cling to the doctrine of hexagram images, asserting that two hours of the day serve as the firing times, meticulously measuring the weight of lines to gauge the qi’s timing. Day and night, they anxiously watch the sundial and water clock—how grievously mistaken!\n\nThe sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness vary in earliness and lateness. Chen Niju’s *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"The heavens clearly divide twelve forms; all take them as the program for elixir refinement.\"* This refers to the sun and stars as the measure. The sun is fire; the stars are the timing. If one can reverse the heavens’ sun and stars to seek them within the body, then the position of the sun’s arrival becomes the hour. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"To refine the medicine, know dawn and dusk\"*—this refers to movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness. Movement is rising at sunrise to work; stillness is resting at sunset. Within our own bodies, there is naturally a sunrise and sunset, early and late. The firing times and movements of stillness and activity all secretly align with the celestial measures, none but using the pivot of the heavens and the tides of time as the moments for inner work.\n\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; in autumn and winter, employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Hexagrams have six lines: the lower three are inner, the upper three outer. Take, for example, the morning use of *Zhun* and evening use of *Meng*. Morning *Zhun* is the time of yang fire’s ascent, and *Zhun*’s *chujiu* line corresponds to *zi* within the body, moving from inner to outer—hence *\"in spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\"* Evening *Meng* is the time of yin tally’s descent, and *Meng*’s *shangjiu* line corresponds to *wu* within the body, moving from outer to inner—hence *\"in autumn and winter, employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\"*\n\nYet the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter; *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *hai*; and the doctrines of inner body and outer use are all metaphors. If one rigidly adheres to images and texts, practicing hexagram qi, one merely grasps Qian and Kun as the crucible, kneads the crow and hare as medicine, and cooks them—how could this refer to the Qian and Kun outside the body, the crow and hare outside the body? The seeker must seek them within the body.\n\nNow, the celestial positions...\n\nAbove lies the position of earth, below the two qi circulate—ascending and descending in endless alternation, like a bellows. Man, born of harmonious qi between heaven and earth, shares the same original body with them. If one awakens to the bellows’ marvel of heaven and earth, this heart becomes empty, still, and serene, and qi naturally flows throughout above and below. When it opens, qi issues forth; when it closes, qi enters in. Qi issuing forth resembles earth qi ascending; qi entering resembles heaven qi descending. Thus may one equal heaven and earth in longevity.\n\nMaster Zihua said: \"The ancients who understood the Dao built ramparts to guard against the perverse and dammed the source to nurture the true. Dwelling in seclusion, undisturbed by things, they regulated their breath to unite with spirit and qi. Guarding the po, observing precepts, they sealed their senses, focused without distraction—thus true qi was preserved. Above and below, it irrigated; qi flowed unimpeded, like water’s current, like the sun and moon’s ceaseless motion. Yin nourished the viscera; yang fortified the bowels. The source flowed abundantly, full yet not overflowing, balanced yet not brimming—this is called long life.\"\n\nTo abandon this and claim, \"I possess a swift method to ascend the clouds,\" is but a devious byway of misguided learning, not the great elixir’s Way.\n\nHeaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. The established positions are the arrayed stations of yin and yang’s pairing. The *Yi* speaks of Kan and Li: Kan and Li are Qian and Kun’s two functions. Without fixed lines or positions, they circulate through the six voids, their coming and going unfixed, their above and below without constancy.\n\nQian is heaven; Kun is earth—our body’s crucible. Li is the sun; Kan is the moon—our body’s medicine. The precelestial eight trigrams place Qian in the south and Kun in the north, Li in the east and Kan in the west. South and north array the positions of heaven and earth’s pairing; east and west divide the gates of sun and moon’s ingress and egress. Reversing the search to seek within our body, the principle is one.\n\nQian and Kun are the substance; Kan and Li are the function. These two, Kan and Li, circulate, ascending and descending through the six voids, coming and going above and below—indeed, without fixed lines or positions. Within our body’s crucible, Kan and Li move: heaven hides in the latent, earth hides in the latent—how could there be fixed lines or positions?\n\nConcealed and submerged, they transform within. \"Concealed and submerged\" means spirit enters qi, qi enters the navel, and sinks to return to the sea’s depths. \"Transforming within\" means when the time arrives, qi naturally transmutes; when stillness reaches its extreme, the mechanism spontaneously activates, and the sun’s orb is embraced and brought forth. As Chen Xiyi’s *Zhi Pian* says: \"Vast, without trace, returning to the mysterious; latent, with mechanisms, the sacred embryo is knit\"—this is the meaning.\n\nEnveloping the ten thousand things as the Dao’s guiding principle, the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"The Dao arises from emptiness and nonbeing; from the one qi, yin and yang are produced. Yin and yang unite to generate the three bodies; the three bodies engender the ten thousand things.\" The mother of the golden elixir is none other than the precelestial one qi. Split, it becomes two; divided, it becomes three; dispersed, it becomes the ten thousand things—all emerge from this one qi. Thus it is said: \"Enveloping the ten thousand things as the Dao’s guiding principle.\"\n\nTo use the insubstantial to govern the substantial, the vessel’s function is emptiness. The *Daode Jing* says: \"Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the center’s emptiness that makes the cart useful. Clay is shaped into vessels; it is the hollowness within that makes the vessel useful. Doors and windows are cut to make a room; it is the empty space that makes the room useful. Thus, what is present provides the advantage; what is absent provides the function.\"\n\nLin Yanzhai’s commentary states: \"The hub is the part of the wheel that holds the axle; the spokes are the wheel’s limbs. The hub is empty in the center, hence it can move the cart. Clay is the potter’s material; hollow and round, it can become a vessel. Doors and windows are the room’s passages for light—these three are all metaphors for the function of emptiness. Thus it is said: 'What is present provides the advantage; what is absent provides the function.' Carts, vessels, and rooms are all real advantages, yet their usefulness as cart, vessel, or room lies in the function of emptiness.\"\n\nNow, Master Wei’s statement—\"to use the insubstantial to govern the substantial, the vessel’s function is emptiness\"—truly employs Laozi’s meaning. In the elixir method, the great emptiness serves as crucible and furnace, and within the great emptiness, there naturally exists a wondrous function. Marvelous! Marvelous!\n\nGuan Yinzi says: \"Clothing sways in the void to obtain wind; exhaling upon things obtains water.\" Chen Baoyi’s commentary states: \"Knowing that swaying in the void obtains wind, then striking our bellows can generate qi. Knowing that exhaling upon things obtains water, then nurturing our qi can transform essence.\" If one is ignorant of this and seeks elsewhere, the so-called crucible and furnace are not the Way of emptiness and nonbeing.\n\nThus, advancing and retreating, Kan and Li vanish and reappear. \"Advancing\" is the time for kindling the fire, when Kun’s three lines transform into Qian. \"Retreating\" is the time for withdrawing the tally, when Qian’s three lines transform into Kun. Now, from the new moon when the Zhen trigram governs, passing through Dui to Qian, and from the full moon when the Xun trigram governs, passing through Gen to Kun, Kan and Li’s line positions are unseen—is this not the vanishing of Kan and Li?\n\nYet Kan and Li do not vanish; they move through the six voids, their coming and going unfixed.\n\nWords are not carelessly crafted; theories are not idly born. Drawing evidence, verifying effects, measuring with spirit and numen, tracing the origins of characters to confirm principles: Kan is the essence of the wu month; Li is the light of the si day. Sun and moon are the *Yi*’s correlates of firm and yielding. Earth rules the four seasons, weaving the warp of beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy a quarter, all receiving the power of the central palace’s wu and si.\n\nKan is yin without and yang within—the image of the moon. Li is yang without and yin within—the image of the sun. Kan receives wu, the yang earth; Li receives ji, the yin earth. When the two earths unite, yin and yang harmonize, firm and yielding correspond—like the two characters for sun and moon combining to form the character *yi*. Green, red, white, and black are wood, fire, metal, and water. Wood, fire, metal, and water each occupy a quarter; only earth resides in the center, dividing its flourishing seasons among chen, xu, chou, and wei to weave the warp of the year’s beginning and end. Thus, wood receives its flourishing, fire its rest, metal its birth, and water its cessation—all receive its power.\n\nYet this earth pervades everywhere...\n\nWithin the universe, there is no fixed position for earth—when in Kan, it is wu earth; when in Li, it is ji earth; when in the central palace, it is wu-ji earth; when in the four seasons, it is chen-xu-chou-wei earth. Yet it is the same substance. How profound! The *Wuzhen Pian* poem states: \"The Four Symbols and Five Phases all rely on earth,\" and again: \"Only because each holds true earth within does the golden elixir achieve return and restoration.\" For without true earth to harmonize them, yin and yang remain blocked, firm and yielding sundered—no elixir can form.\n\nAlas! When Master Wei composed this book to reveal the secrets of this Dao, he drew only from verified evidence and personal attainment. Yet fearing this might still fail to convince later generations, he further calibrated the numinous workings of sun and moon as a method and traced the principles of the *Yi* hexagrams as proof—truly profound and luminous. How could he have idly fabricated groundless words or spun useless theories to deceive those who come after?\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery. No image is more luminous than that of sun and moon. To fathom the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; they converge like spokes in a turning wheel, alternating in ebb and flow. The *Yi* is imagery—precisely what the earlier passage meant by \"sun and moon forming *yi*.\"\n\nMaster Wei’s purpose in this work was to point out the yin and yang within the body. Yet the body’s yin and yang are formless and ungraspable—ordinary people use them daily without awareness. If not for borrowing images and objects, how could one illuminate them so that others might fathom the numinous and know transformation? Thus, he looked up and down between heaven and earth, where only the images of sun and moon stand out in luminous clarity. By presenting what is manifestly clear, he enabled others to perceive the yin and yang of heaven and earth and silently grasp the wonders of transformation. Then the daily workings of one’s own body, though unspoken, become self-evident.\n\nFor sun and moon traverse the ecliptic: one emerges, one retreats; they alternate above and below, intertwining in expansion and contraction, cycling through day and night like a wheel turning endlessly. If one reflects inwardly and extends this insight, one finds that within one’s own body, sun and moon exist no differently than in heaven and earth.\n\nHan Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states:\n*\"The Dharma-wheel must turn—always turn—*\n*Yet it lies within the body, unseen.*\n*When set in motion, it resembles the sun-wheel—*\n*The sun-wheel turns toward me, within my body.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Let the Dharma-wheel turn without cease;*\n*Thought by thought, cling not—*\n*The wheel turns of itself;*\n*What need is there for external seeking?\"*\n\nThe *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines. \"Extracting the tally\" refers to the sixty-four hexagrams—a complete *Yi* totals three hundred eighty-four lines, while one *jin* of the great medicine totals three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. This is the resonance between the Dao of the elixir and the Dao of the *Yi*, and thus the *Cantong Qi* was composed.\n\nThe lines are the strokes of the hexagrams; the tally is the union of hexagrams. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams. In the elixir method, Qian and Kun serve as the cauldron and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, and the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire phases. Now, observing Qian and Kun: they begin with *Zhun* and end with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, with every inversion and correspondence in between perfectly aligned. Herein lies the Dao: \"One yin, one yang.\" The ancient immortals, by extracting the tally from the lines, metaphorically compared cauldron, medicinal substances, and fire phases—truly ingenious and comprehensive.\n\nFrom the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth conjoin their essence, and sun and moon mutually sustain each other. \"From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon\" refers to the interval between the last and first days of the lunar month.\n\nWhen *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally, it is Qian interpenetrating Kun to form *Zhen*, wherein the single yang is born within the body. At this moment, spirit and qi intermingle, qi and spirit unite—akin to heaven and earth conjoining their essence, sun and moon merging as one. Thus it is said: \"At this moment, heaven and earth conjoin their essence, sun and moon mutually sustain each other.\" Heaven and earth are the Qian and Kun within our bodies; sun and moon are the Kan and Li within us. As heaven and earth and sun and moon unite in due season, they refine the myriad things to accomplish the year’s work. As Qian and Kun and Kan and Li unite in due season, they seize the transformations of creation to form the sacred embryo.\n\nMaster Wei sighed: scholars, failing to comprehend the yin-yang transformations within their own bodies, borrow the moment of sun-moon conjunction as a metaphor. Yet it is not that only the interval between the dark and dawn of the new moon may be employed for inner work. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Sun and moon meet once every thirty days; the method of exchanging days for seasons lies in spiritual work.\" If practitioners grasp the subtlety of exchanging days for seasons, they may seize heaven and earth’s mechanism to complete the Great Elixir.\n\n\"Yang, the male, scatters the mysterious; yin, the female, gathers the yellow transformation.\" \"Yang, the male, scatters the mysterious\" refers to heavenly qi descending to earth; \"yin, the female, gathers the yellow transformation\" refers to earth receiving heavenly qi to generate beings. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Sweet dew descends when heaven and earth unite; the yellow sprout arises when Kan and Li intermingle.\" The generation of medicinal substances in elixir arts resembles the generation of beings in heaven and earth—both proceed from the intermingling of yin and yang, one scattering, one transforming, to produce the mysterious yellow.\n\nWhen primordial chaos intermingles, the root and foundation are established. As yin and yang qi ascend and descend to intermingle and merge as one, it is called \"primordial chaos.\" Primordial chaos is the outer enclosure of heaven and earth, the womb of the myriad things. In elixir arts, taking this as the starting point to establish the root and foundation means that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all reside within one’s body, with no need to seek them externally.\n\nCultivating and nurturing within the *yinen*, spirit congeals to form the body. *Yinen* is the root and stem. When elixir arts are cultivated here and the inner light is turned inward, spirit clings to qi and congeals, qi clings to spirit and abides—naturally interweaving to form the embryo. If the spirit’s light leaks outward and the qi-steed gallops abroad, then sun and moon lose their way, gold and mercury part crucibles. How then may one hope to complete the elixir? The *Baizi Qingzhu Yuye Dansui Ge* says: \"In former days, I met my teacher and received the oral transmission: simply focus spirit to enter the qi-cavern.\" This is why it is called \"spirit-elixir\" and named \"spirit-immortal.\"\n\nAll beings tread this path to emerge, even the wriggling and crawling. The way of yin-yang intermingling is the source of all generation and transformation. Not only do humans and beasts emerge thereby; even the flying, wriggling, crawling, and breathing—down to the most minute creatures—all proceed from this. Thus it is said: \"All beings tread this path to emerge; the wriggling and crawling none are without it.\" Applied to others, it generates people; preserved within oneself, it generates the medicinal substance. The only distinction lies in whether one is sagely or common, moving with or against the current.\n\nThus Confucius praised the *Hong Meng*, saying: \"The virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the empty.\" Ancient texts esteemed the *Yuan Huang*; the *Guanju* established the beginning. The *Book of Rites* took capping and marriage as weighty; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* made the first year paramount. From this we know that the sages’ composition of classics all had a foundational reference. If one practices elixir arts without investigating their origins, how may one thoroughly comprehend yin-yang and deeply penetrate the transformations of creation?\n\nThe sage is not born in vain; above, he observes the celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension, in accord with the seasons. The tally is the union: the moon travels through the heavens, once each month uniting with the sun, hence called the celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension in accord with the seasons: from the first day of the month onward, its light gradually advances, the *hun* lengthens, the *po* wanes, yang extends, yin contracts—like the progression from midnight to noon. From the sixteenth day onward, its light gradually retreats, the *po* lengthens, the *hun* wanes, yin extends, yang contracts—like the progression from noon to midnight. The perfected of old observed heaven’s way and grasped heaven’s movements, then borrowed the celestial tally’s advance and retreat, yin-yang’s contraction and extension, to establish the method of fire phases as a model for others. For heaven and earth are like a single crucible, sun and moon the medicinal substances. The sun and moon’s movements through heaven and earth—coming and going, rising and setting—are the fire phases. If one can turn inward to seek this within oneself, one may silently grasp the subtlety of the fire phases’ advance and retreat.\n\nThus the *Yi* unites the heart of heaven; the *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning. The *Yi* is called \"one yin, one yang.\"\n\nThe heart of heaven lies at the center of the northern *zi* hour. The *Fu* hexagram corresponds to the eleventh month. As a hexagram, *Fu* precisely aligns with the central *qi* of the northern *zi* position, responding to the winter solstice. As Shao Kangjie’s *Jirang Ji* states in its *Winter Solstice Chant*: \"At the winter solstice, the midpoint of *zi*, the heart of heaven remains unchanged.\" Zhu Xi praised this poem as most excellent. For the *lidong* solar term falls in the first half of the tenth month, *xiaoxue* in the middle of the tenth, *daxue* in the first half of the eleventh, the winter solstice in the middle of the eleventh, *xiaohan* in the first half of the twelfth, and *dahan* in the middle of the twelfth. Thus, the midpoint of *zi* in the winter solstice is the midpoint of the eleventh month. Some say the midnight *zi* hour is the winter solstice, but this is incorrect, for the first half of the *zi* hour belongs to the preceding period. Most who calculate the Five Phases are unaware of this, yet the reckoning invariably begins here without the slightest deviation—this is why it is called the heart of heaven. Now, when Master Wei established the *Yi* as uniting the heart of heaven and the *Fu* hexagram as marking the beginning, he referred to the yang *qi* lying dormant in the first month of winter, the month of pure yin, beginning beneath the *Kun* hexagram. There, it accumulates into a single yang line, transforming into the *Fu* hexagram. While it is commonly known that the tenth month is *Kun* and the eleventh month sees the emergence of a single yang line beneath five yin lines, forming *Fu*, few realize that the eleventh month’s winter solstice does not spontaneously generate a single yang line to become *Fu*. Rather, in the tenth month’s *xiaoxue*, a yang line has already begun to stir within the lowest line of *Kun*. Yet within a single day or month, it grows by only one-thirtieth. Only after accumulating for a full month, by the eleventh month’s winter solstice, does it complete a single line, forming *Fu*. This, too, is a metaphor. The year takes the winter solstice as *Fu*, the month takes the new moon’s dawn as *Fu*, and the day takes the *zi* hour as *Fu*—all serve to elucidate the transformations within the body, and one need not rigidly adhere to years, months, days, or hours.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* states: \"A month has three decades, a day shares the same cultivation. The alchemical method emulates heaven’s work.\" For the year corresponds to the month, the month to the day, and the day to the hour. Compressing a year into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour—within a single hour, there lies the mechanism of a single yang’s return. This mechanism does not reside in the winter solstice, nor in the new moon’s dawn, nor in the *zi* hour. Without profound insight into heaven and earth’s yin and yang, none may know this mysterious mechanism, so secret is it.\n\nThe eldest son inherits the father’s body and establishes the foundation through the mother. The *Qian* father’s lowest line intermingles with the *Kun* mother’s first line, forming *Zhen*, which is the eldest son. Thus it is said: \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body.\" *Zhen* arises from *Kun*’s body, just as an infant is born from its mother’s womb. Hence it is said: \"Establishes the foundation through the mother.\" The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"The Golden Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son, sent to the Western Neighbor to inherit the body.\" This is the same principle. Understanding this, one knows that in refining the elixir, there is no need to seek the winter solstice—within the body, a single yang naturally arises, and one need not cling to the constraints of years, months, days, or hours.\n\nThe waxing and waning respond to the *zhong* pitch; ascent and descent follow the Dipper’s pivot. From *zi* to *si* is waxing; from *wu* to *hai* is waning. The waxing and waning respond to the *zhong* pitch: within a year’s twelve months, the pitch pipes change each month, cycling through all twelve. The waxing and waning of the body’s fire phases are the same. From below to above is ascent; from above to below is descent. Ascent and descent follow the Dipper’s pivot: within a day’s twelve hours, the Dipper’s handle shifts each hour, traversing all twelve earthly branches. The body’s fire phases’ ascent and descent are likewise. The *Zhixuan Pian* states: \"Vast, the ninefold earth shifts the pitch pipes; dim, the boundless heavens turn the Dipper’s handle.\" This is but a metaphorical comparison—it does not mean using the length of pitch pipes or the Dipper’s direction as a measure.\n\nOn the third day, brightness emerges; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west. On the third day of the lunar month, the crescent moon appears at dusk in the west, at the *geng* position, resembling *Zhen*. This corresponds to *Zhen*’s reception of *geng*. In terms of the body’s fire phases, this is the moment when the river chariot must not pause even briefly.\n\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding* at the upper *cui*, level as a stretched cord. By the eighth day, the moon reaches the upper *cui*, appearing at dusk in the south at the *ding* position, resembling *Dui*. This corresponds to *Dui*’s reception of *ding*, symbolizing the halfway ascent of the body’s yang fire.\n\nOn the fifteenth, *Qian*’s body is full and complete, *jia* in the east. By the fifteenth, the moon opposes the sun, appearing at dusk in the east at the *jia* position, resembling *Qian*. This corresponds to *Qian*’s reception of *jia*, symbolizing the body’s yang fire at its fullest.\n\nThe toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon shine without dual brightness. The toad is the moon’s essence; the hare’s spirit is the sun’s light. \"Sun and moon shine without dual brightness\" means the sun illuminates the day, the moon the night. When the sun rises, the moon sets; when the moon rises, the sun sets. Day and night alternate in illumination, their appearances and withdrawals reciprocally unfolding. How is human breath different? As the *Huangting Jing* states: \"Exhale the sun, inhale the moon—breath is preserved.\" For breath is none other than the sun and moon.\n\nThe toad observes the hexagram’s node; the hare spits forth radiance. In the alchemical method, the first half of the month is yang, belonging to *Zhen*, *Dui*, and *Qian*; the latter half is yin, belonging to *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. Thus it is said: \"The toad observes the hexagram’s node.\" The moon is supreme yin; the sun is supreme yang. Yang governs emission; yin governs absorption. The moon itself has no light but receives the sun’s light to become bright. Hence it is said: \"The hare spits forth radiance.\"\n\nAt seven and eight, the Dao is complete, bending and descending low. Seven and eight refer to the fifteenth. The yang fire ascends from *Zhen* to the fifteenth, where pure *Qian* reaches its fullness—this is the culmination of the first half of the month. Its momentum is exhausted, its path perilous. Thus, it must inevitably bend, turn, and descend. As Chen Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi Shu* states: \"Within the ninefold city, the dragon chariot departs; before the twelvefold tower, the tiger carriage returns.\" This is the same principle.\n\nAt sixteen, it turns to receive the mandate; *Xun*’s *xin* appears at dawn’s clarity. By the sixteenth day, the moon begins to wane, appearing at dawn in the west at the *xin* position, its brightness just diminished. This resembles *Xun*, corresponding to *Xun*’s reception of *xin*. In terms of the body’s fire phases, this is the moment when yin receives yang’s succession, the peak turning back.\n\n*Gen* aligns with *bing* at the southern lower *cui* on the twenty-third. By the twenty-third day, the moon reaches the lower *cui*, appearing at dawn in the south at the *bing* position, half its brightness diminished. This resembles *Gen*, corresponding to *Gen*’s reception of *bing*, symbolizing the halfway descent of the body’s yin tally.\n\n*Kun*’s *yi* on the thirtieth day in the east guards its brightness. By the thirtieth day, the moon’s brightness is concealed, appearing at dawn in the east at the *yi* position, guarding its light. This resembles *Kun*, corresponding to *Kun*’s reception of *yi*.\n\nBy the thirtieth day, the moon becomes *hui* (dark), appearing at dawn in the east at the *yi* position, its light entirely concealed. This resembles *Kun*, corresponding to *Kun*’s reception of *yi*, symbolizing the moment when the body’s yin tally reaches its utmost.\n\nWhen one phase ends, succession passes to the next, and the corporeal form revives like the dragon. Master Wei divides the thirty days of a month into six phases: from the first day of the new moon to the fifth day is the first phase, belonging to *Zhen*; the sixth to the tenth day is the second phase, belonging to *Dui*; the eleventh to the fifteenth day is the third phase, belonging to *Qian*; the sixteenth to the twentieth day is the fourth phase, belonging to *Xun*; the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth day is the fifth phase, belonging to *Gen*; and the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day is the sixth phase, belonging to *Kun*. When the six phases conclude, the sun and moon conjoin at the new moon, and yang once more receives yin’s succession, transforming again into *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the dragon—a single yang stirring beneath two yins. Beneath the depths of the abyss, is there not a moving creature? Is this not the dragon?\n\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. *Qian* receives *jia* and *ren*, while *Kun* receives *yi* and *gui*. Thus it is said: *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*. The ten celestial stems begin with *jia* and *yi* and conclude with *ren* and *gui*. Thus it is said: *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. The *na jia* method is but a metaphor drawn from the fire phases. The waxing and waning of the fire phases differ not from the moon’s waxing and waning. Now, arranging the six hexagrams across a month: *Zhen* corresponds to the third day, when the moon emerges at *geng*; *Dui* to the upper *cui*, when the moon appears at *ding*; *Qian* to the full moon, when the moon is full at *jia*; *Xun* to the sixteenth day, when the moon wanes at *xin*; *Gen* to the lower *cui*, when the moon diminishes at *bing*; and *Kun* to the dark moon, when the moon vanishes at *yi*. This is merely a borrowing to discuss the advance and retreat of the six hexagrams’ fire phases within the body—it is not truly the thirty days of a month.\n\nHow can this be clarified? When measured against the calendar, day and night vary in length. If the day is short and the sun sets at *shen*, the moon conjoins at *shen* and reaches fullness at *yin*. If the day is long and the sun sets at *xu*, the moon conjoins at *xu* and reaches fullness at *chen*. Over twelve months, the three-day-old moon does not always appear at *geng*, nor does the fifteen-day-old moon always appear at *jia*. With the new moon’s conjunction varying in timing, the upper and lower *cui* do not invariably fall on the eighth and twenty-third days, nor do the full and dark moons invariably fall on the fifteenth and thirtieth days. When Master Wei speaks of the three-day moon emerging as *shuang*, *Zhen* receiving *geng* in the west, or the sixteenth day’s turning receiving *Xun*’s succession with *xin* appearing at dawn, he refers to the equinoxes when day and night are balanced, using them merely as metaphors—not truly advancing the fire when the moon emerges at *geng* or retreating the tally when the moon wanes at *xin*.\n\nScholars need only observe the moon’s waxing and waning and reflect upon their own bodies. The arising of one yang within the body is the *Zhen* image of the three-day moon’s birth. The growth of two yangs is the *Dui* image of the eight-day moon’s *cui*. The fullness of three yangs is the *Qian* image of the fifteen-day full moon. The arising of one yin is the *Xun* image of the sixteen-day waning moon. The growth of two yins is the *Gen* image of the twenty-third-day moon’s *cui*. The fulfillment of three yins is the *Kun* image of the thirty-day moon’s concealment. How can one rigidly adhere to the moon’s directions of emergence and setting, regulate them by the hexagrams’ line structures and numbers, or constrain them by the calendar’s methods of expansion and contraction?\n\nSeven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. Together, the four sum to thirty, matching the thirty days of a month—this is the *Yi*’s image of concealment and disappearance. Seven is the fire number, eight the wood number; combined, they make fifteen. Nine is the metal number, six the water number; combined, they also make fifteen. Together, the four sum to thirty, corresponding to the thirty days of a month. When the thirty-day count concludes, the sun and moon unite as one, and the *Yi*’s image vanishes without trace. The *Fuming* chapter states: “One month, one return, makes one revolution; one year, nine revolutions, nine returns.” It relies solely on the two hexagrams to reckon punishment and virtue, with five and six revolving back to *wu* and *si*. Five and six together make thirty.\n\nThis resembles the midwinter node, when grasses and trees wither and decay, aiding yang’s interrogation of *shang*. The traveler and the lord deeply conceal themselves, following the season’s rhythm, closing their mouths and refraining from discoursing on the Dao of Heaven—so vast, so profound, formless and boundless, empty and unseen. To rectify errors and dispel delusions, one must first dissolve the outer frame.\n\nIn the alchemical method, the winter solstice and the moments between dark and new moons are all metaphors for the time when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. Speaking of a month, it is like the dark moon’s night, when the moon’s light vanishes without trace. Speaking of a year, it is like the midwinter node, when grasses and trees wither and decay. Their meaning is one and the same. The *Yi* states: “Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*. The former kings, on reaching this day, closed the passes, and merchants and travelers did not journey; the lord did not inspect the regions.” This is to cultivate stillness in preparation for movement, aligning with the Dao of Heaven.\n\nYet the Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless; the true mechanism lies within a single moment. The profound and formless finds its wonder in the hidden and obscure. Thus, at the moment of the winter solstice, one must first seal the *Dui*, calm the heart, and guard silence, causing metal and mercury to return together to the crucible, like the sun and moon uniting as one. Conceal the outer frame, sinking it into the abyssal void, so that spirit congeals, qi gathers, and the golden liquid coagulates. If one forgets this sealing of silence and recklessly lets the heavy tower’s vastness pour forth, one invites only injury and defeat.\n\nThis separate arrangement of the four images is to enlighten later generations who are blind. The four images are seven, eight, nine, and six—the same as the “seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond” mentioned above. Combined, seven, eight, nine, and six make thirty, corresponding to the thirty days of a month—all are metaphorical images. Master Wei, seeing that scholars failed to grasp his meaning and blindly led one another to mistakenly take the waxing and waning of the thirty days as the fire phases of a month, thus separately arranged these four images of seven, eight, nine, and six to enlighten the unenlightened, hoping to reveal that the thirty days of a month are all metaphors—not truly advancing the fire on the third day of the moon or retreating the tally on the sixteenth day. This is like the branches *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*; the earthly branches *zi*, *shen*, *yin*, and *xu*; the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the solar terms of solstices, equinoxes, beginnings, and closings; day and night; dawn and dusk; and the return to one’s dwelling—all share this meaning. If scholars understand that seven, eight, nine, and six correspond to the thirty days of a month, they can silently comprehend all other broad metaphors. Why cling to the text and rigidly adhere to the images?\n\nThe eight hexagrams are arrayed, and the luminaries move without losing the center.\n\nThe center is the Yellow Way. The eight directions are arrayed with the eight trigrams, and the twenty-eight lunar lodges encircle them—this is the path along which the sun and moon travel. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Once you drive the two substances back to the Yellow Way, how could the numinous elixir fail to form?\" When refining the elixir, if the \"monkey of the mind\" gallops wildly outward, you must gather your vision, return your hearing, and concentrate your spirit for a moment, so that the two substances return to the Yellow Way without losing the center. Then, in harmonious union, they condense into a single drop of dew, which descends into the Cinnabar Field.\n\nThe primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive; its effects must be inferred and verified. The primordial essence arises from the profound and obscure, invisible to the eye. The *Daodejing* says: \"Profound! Obscure! Within it lies essence. Its essence is most real, and within it lies sincerity.\" The Way of the Great Elixir accords with the transformations of nature. When the celestial sign arrives, the jade bell tolls once, and the grotto of the immortals opens wide—this is its verification. An ancient song says: \"Beneath the first green, the moon and sun rise together on either side, merging into one.\" Without penetrating the yin and yang of heaven and earth or deeply grasping the transformations of one’s own body, how could one hastily proceed?\n\nWhen dwelling in stillness, observe its images and model its forms. When refining the elixir, externally set up a gnomon and water clock to measure the celestial movements of the sun’s shadow, while internally cultivate the True One to verify the body’s own timekeeping. Only then will you not lose the mechanism of heaven and earth. When spirit is settled and qi harmonized, inner and outer align; when spirit is dull and qi restless, the moments diverge—this cannot be left unregulated.\n\nSet up the gnomon as a standard and observe the signs to determine auspiciousness. The fire times of the Great Elixir do not rely on fixed hours—why set up a gnomon and observe the signs? It is to avoid missing the moment when heaven and humanity jointly activate the mechanism. If one does not guard this mysterious moment but instead busies oneself from dawn to dusk with the sundial and water clock, taking them as the fire times, one errs gravely.\n\nIssue commands in accord with the seasons, and do not miss the time when the lines move. When *Dizhen* (Earth Thunder) stirs and the *Xun* gate opens, the dragon leaps toward the eastern pool—this is the moment when the single yang line stirs within the body. At this time, warm qi surges and merges, and the heart feels a fleeting trance; one must swiftly advance the fire without delay. The *Zhuyu Jihuanyuan* says: \"When the wind first rises in the myriad hollows and the moon first rounds the thousand peaks, hasten to issue commands and circulate the Celestial Cycle.\" This is what it means. The *Zhixuan Pian* says: \"Guard the child in the radiant light, and employ the general amid the drumbeats\"—this, too, refers to the same.\n\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s forms; in the center, investigate the human heart. Cross-reference and verify the Three Powers. The *Xiqizhen Sanzhu Mingxu* says: \"Revolving with the sun and moon, wheeling with the Milky Way, the turning is endless, and life knows no bounds.\" This means the Way of the Great Elixir aligns with the Way of Heaven. The *Shizhong Yin* in *Xiqizhen* says: \"Its wondrous workings flow like rivers, endless in their circling; it nurtures the mysterious valley and irrigates the Jade Pond.\" This means the Way of the Great Elixir aligns with the Way of Earth.\n\nWhy does the Way of the Great Elixir align with heaven and earth? It all lies in the silent operation of this heart. The ancients who refined the elixir looked up to observe the celestial patterns, looked down to examine earth’s principles, and centered their inquiry on the human heart. Thus, they emptied their hearts, moved their spirits, turned the Celestial Pivot, and rotated the Earth’s Axis. Above, they responded to the revolving brilliance of the Milky Way; below, they matched the rising and falling of the ocean tides. Though heaven and earth are vast and their transformations wondrous, the luminous movements of the sun, moon, and stars, the cyclic array of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams—all were gathered into their own bodies. Some became their crucibles, some their medicinal substances, some their fire times. Turning inward to observe, the Three Powers were complete within them, for they never sought outside their own bodies.\n\nThe *Jirang Ji Guanyin* says:\n*\"One thing comes with one body,\nOne body still holds one Qian and Kun.\nIf you know the myriad things are complete within you,\nWhy set the Three Powers apart as separate roots?\nHeaven’s pivot lies within the center,\nCreation arises from the heart.\nHow could heaven and humanity have two different principles?\nThe Way does not act in vain—it lies deep within the human.\"*\nHow could there be any doubt?\n\nWhen active, follow the changes of the hexagrams; when still, adhere to the judgments of the *Tuan* texts. The *Daodejing* says: \"Attain the utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. Things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny.\" How perfect! This is why the myriad things return to their destiny.\n\nWithin this body lies the great elixir of golden cinnabar—is its embryo nurtured in the midst of utmost stillness and born at the moment when yin reaches its extreme?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Supreme indeed is the primal power of Kun! All things owe their birth to it, for it follows Heaven in due sequence.\" Kun’s profound capacity to bear all things is a virtue boundless in scope. As Kun is the hexagram of pure yin, the earth, it receives and enfolds Heaven’s qi, and thus the hundred creatures all emerge from the soil. The alchemical method, at the moment of containing light and returning illumination, conceals the spirit within—this is no different from the pure yin of the moon, the closure of winter’s depths. The \"Returning to Destiny\" chapter says: \"Having received the true immortal’s formula, one refines the utmost yang within yin.\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nYet when stillness reaches its extreme, movement must follow. In an instant, one yang stirs beneath the six yins, transforming first into *Fu* (Return), then into *Lin* (Approach), *Tai* (Peace), *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), *Guai* (Breakthrough), until at the sixth change it becomes pure *Qian*—the yang qi then pervades the six voids, and a single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\n\nWhen Qian and Kun circulate in their workings, Heaven and Earth are then well-ordered. The functions of Qian and Kun are Kan and Li. When Heaven and Earth obtain Kan and Li to operate between them, yin and yang harmonize in great peace, and auspicious qi arises. If for a single day Heaven and Earth were without Kan and Li, the workings of creation would nearly cease. Is the wondrous use of the great elixir any different from the workings of Qian and Kun?\n\nHow could one not be cautious? The first stirring of the yang is the beginning of elixir-making—just as it is the beginning of a ruler’s governance. When issuing decrees and commands, how could one not be cautious?\n\nThe subtle mechanisms must be tightly sealed, then expansively deployed to distribute the treasure. \"Tightly sealed\" means the eyes contain their light, the ears concentrate their resonance, the nose regulates its breath, the tongue seals its qi, the feet are crossed in proper sitting, and the spirit is inwardly guarded—without a single thought diverted outward. For when the eyes do not see, essence naturally returns to the liver; when the ears do not hear, essence naturally returns to the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, spirit naturally returns to the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po soul naturally returns to the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, intent naturally returns to the spleen. Thus, essence resides in the liver yet does not leak through the eyes; the po soul resides in the lungs yet does not leak through the nose; spirit resides in the heart yet does not leak through the mouth; essence resides in the kidneys yet does not leak through the ears; intent resides in the spleen yet does not leak through the four limbs or the nine apertures. When all five are without leakage, spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent blend and fuse, transforming into a single qi that gathers in the *dantian*. When the breath shifts through the nose and the heart suddenly awakens, the Dragon and Tiger surge through the pass, the great path opens, and a single channel flows into the nectar of jade.\n\nThe crucial pivot of the Dao is the Dipper’s handle, unifying the warp and woof of transformation. The essence of the elixir Way lies entirely in the Dipper. The Dipper governs the turning of yin and yang throughout the body and commands the myriad transformations within—just as a net has its warp or a garment its fastening. For the three *dantian* are divided in three places; if the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle is activated, true qi circulates up and down like the flow of the Celestial River. This is called the crucial pivot. As the *Fuming Pian* states: \"Drive back the Northern Dipper, turn the Celestial Stem; grasp the Southern Asterism and enter the Grotto Chamber\"—this is the crux within the crux.\n\nWhen the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"At the moment of receiving qi, it is easy to obtain; in the work of withdrawal and addition, beware of danger.\" The first yang arises within the body—this is the moment of receiving qi. Though easily attained, if one acts at this time, fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement. Not the slightest deviation is permissible.\n\nThe five planets move in disarray, responding to the seasons; the four and seven fall into discord, separating and uniting, rising and bowing. The five phases must be gathered, the metal and fire must share the same crucible—all depends on a single thought to return to the root and revert to the source. Otherwise, the constellations within the tripod will all be misaligned, and Heaven and Earth will be as distant as if suspended apart.\n\nThe Literary Star governs and records, interrogating the Terrace and Assistants; the hundred officials and functionaries each oversee their respective domains. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The six stars of the Dipper’s bowl are called the Palace of Literary Florescence.\" Here, \"governing and recording\" refers to the Crimson Palace’s sovereign, who unites Kun and Qian. Within the human body, where is there a so-called Literary Star? It is nothing but a metaphor. Heaven has its Three Terraces and Four Assistants; the elixir has its Three Dragons and Four Tigers. To interrogate the Terraces and Assistants means that *jia* and *yi* must not lose *geng* and *xin*, nor should there be the slightest error. Heaven has its multitude of stars and their corresponding regions; the elixir has its multitude of hexagrams and fire signs. The hundred officials and functionaries each oversee their domains—this refers to arranging the twenty-four qi of the year, aligning the twenty-eight lunar lodges of the celestial circuit, and meticulously calculating the fire times of the tripod and furnace. From this, it is clear that the myriad images of Heaven all reside within this single body.\n\nThe sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the rhythm of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. The sun has fifteen *du* of hardness and fifteen *du* of softness; the moon has twelve pipes, six of yin and six of yang. In the elixir Way, the sun is fire, and \"containing the essence of the five phases\" means one thing contains five colors. The moon is the medicine, and \"receiving the rhythm of the six pitch-pipes\" means refining white metal with the six hexagrams. \"Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew\" means the Great Yang moves one degree each day; when it has moved thirty degrees, it once again conjoins with the Great Yin, cycling endlessly without pause.\n\nThe beginning and end, the threads of existence and extinction—\"beginning\" is the new moon; \"end\" is the dark moon. The \"threads of existence and extinction\" lie between the dark and new moons, when yin is nearly exhausted yet not entirely so, and yang is about to arise yet has not yet done so. However, this \"dark and new moon\" is a metaphor—it does not truly refer to the end of the thirtieth day or the beginning of the first day.\n\nIf the ruler is arrogant, excessive, and overflowing, violating the Dao; or if the ministers are devious and obsequious, acting contrary to the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the lunar phases will fall into discord, leading to misfortune and calamity. The law enforcers will admonish, criticize, and interrogate, leaving fault with the ruler. The ruler is spirit; the ministers are qi. When making the elixir, lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible; the body and mind must be still and unmoving. For if the body moves, qi scatters; if the mind moves, spirit scatters. Only by concentrating spirit and gathering qi, with heart and breath mutually dependent, can the numinous embryo be formed. Otherwise, the waxing and waning within the body will fall into discord, leading to misfortune and calamity. Tracing the cause, it is because the heart-ruler has become unrestrained and violated the Dao, so the qi-ministers also act deviously and contrary to the proper path. Thus, it is said: \"The law enforcers admonish, criticize, and interrogate, leaving fault with the ruler.\"\n\nWhen the Celestial Pole is properly aligned, one may roam freely and entrust matters to subordinates. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"Beneath the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterism, at the brows and eyelashes, with a mind like ashes, practice water and fire, stabilize the breath, and gather true lead.\" It also says: \"Essence and qi are the original foundation; spirit and numinosity share one household. If you can capture the five thieves, you may naturally unite the Three Flowers.\" When containing light in silence, one must be continuous yet seemingly present, allowing things to proceed naturally—do not labor the spirit.\n\nThe Bright Hall enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm from the Dao. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The Eastern Palace’s Azure Dragon, the Chamber and Heart—the Heart is the Bright Hall.\" In the human body, this is the Grotto Chamber, the Purple Ultimate, the Numinous Gate and Portal. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Between the Bright Hall and Golden Cabinet, the Purple Chamber, the Perfected of Highest Clarity stand before me; the Yellow Skirt Child’s cinnabar qi frequently troubles me. I ask: where is it? Between the two brows, from which light hangs down and shines.\" Thus, the ruler sits in the Bright Hall to enact governance, communicating the Dao to the nine barbarian tribes and the eight wild regions. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"The Grotto Gate is ever tranquil, illuminating Penglai, guarding eternal spring\"—this is the same principle.\n\nInwardly, one nurtures the self through tranquility and emptiness. Wang Chongyang’s *Complete Reality Collection* says: \"The wondrous use of the Mysterious Pass is not difficult to fathom—it lies only in wordless silence.\" For when the heart is at peace and empty, the Dao naturally comes to reside; when emptiness is extreme and stillness profound, the original yang true qi naturally returns.\n\nReturn to the root and illuminate within to transform the body. The *Complete Reality Collection* says: \"To penetrate, one must search for the origin; to see, one must look within.\" Returning to the root and reverting to the source, turning the light inward—this is the great principle of cultivation. The former Confucians said: \"The Daoist method of nurturing life is to withdraw the gaze and return the vision, like metal and water concealing their light within.\" How true are these words!\n\nSeal the mouth and fortify the numinous root. The mouth is *dui*; the numinous root is the Kan Palace. Seal the mouth so that the upper does not leak; fortify the numinous root so that the lower does not escape. The *Taiqing Jing* of Master Yin says: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss to beautify the numinous root.\" For when spirit does not stray outward, harmonious qi fills and beautifies the within.\n\nThe Three Lights sink into obscurity to nurture the Child Pearl. The Three Lights are the numinous images of the Cavern Chamber. If one can gather the Three Lights and reflect them inward, then the central true position will produce the Mysterious Pearl. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"The Cavern Chamber’s numinous images—the Dipper, sun, and moon—shine with the Three Lights, illuminating the Chamber of the Child.\" Those with clear eyes, pray consider this.\n\nSeen yet unseen, near yet easily sought—\nThe Golden Elixir, the great medicine, lies only before the eyes. Is it not near? Yet why is it unseen, ungrasped? Though near, it is as distant. If one obtains the method and seeks it, then in but a moment’s effort, golden blossoms fill the sight—how could it be far? The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"The effort is easy, the medicine not remote.\" Once revealed, one must laugh—laugh at how near and easily sought it is, yet people seek it in the lofty and distant.\n\nThe *Fuming Pian* says: \"Clearly, it lies only before the eyes—yet people of this age do not see it.\" Precisely because they do not see, they abandon the internal to pursue the external: some gather the essence of the sun and moon, some refine metals, stones, herbs, and woods, some practice chamber arts—truly, \"the Dao is near yet sought afar, the task is easy yet sought in difficulty.\" How lamentable!\n\nThe Yellow Center gradually opens, its principle moistening and suffusing the skin. When the Elixir Field contains substance and the one qi flows unimpeded, harmony accumulates within and radiant splendor manifests without.\n\nAt the outset, rectify the foundation—then the end of cultivation may be grasped; establish the root, and the branch may be held. When the exterior is upright, the shadow is straight; when the source is deep, the flow is long. Attain the One, and the myriad affairs are complete.\n\nThis One is what veils the world—none know it. The Ancestor of the Great Dao arises from nothing but qi to accomplish transformation: divided, it becomes black and white; separated, it becomes blue and yellow. Metaphorically, it is called sun and moon; named, it is called dragon and tiger. All these manifold forms are but the two words *yin* and *yang*—yet in truth, they are a single thing.\n\nThe names \"divine water\" and \"flower pool,\" the designations \"crucible\" and \"earth cauldron\"—all refer to one place. Some say it is the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice; others, the interval between the last and first days of the lunar month. People do not know that the return of the first yang must occur at the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice, or that the union of sun and moon must take place between the last and first days of the month. Thus, they pore over calendars, count the hours, and err gravely.\n\nYet who knows that within the compression of years into months, months into days, days into hours—even within a single hour—lies the creation of a year, a month? Still, that hour is but one place; that place, but one thing.\n\nThus, the Winter and Summer Solstices, the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, the *mao* and *you* hours, the *jia* and *geng* days, the last and first days of the lunar month, the waxing and waning phases, the *zi* and *wu* hours, the *ji* and *hai* days, the *zi* and *shen* hours, the *yin* and *xu* hours—all twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two seasonal markers, the annual conjunctions and monthly revolutions, the moments of *li* and *kan*, the months of the Hare and the Rooster, the cavities of *xun* and *qian*, the gates of the two eights, the *zhun* of dawn and the *pi* of dusk, the *gou* of day and the *fu* of night—all reside within this single center. As the *Chuixu Pian* states:\n\n*\"Later, it returns as before—\nGo ask those wild fox spirits how many they’ve deceived.\nNone know this single place,\nAll mistaking side doors for the true Way.\"*\n\nHow many in this world truly know this One?\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: *\"The highest virtue is non-action, without deliberate seeking; the lesser virtue acts, its function unceasing.\"* Here, \"the highest virtue is non-action, without deliberate seeking\" means the spirit abides in the Mysterious Palace in silent non-doing. \"The lesser virtue acts, its function unceasing\" means *qi* rises in the Gate of the Female, continuous and unbroken. This borrows Laozi’s words to reveal the secret of the interpenetration of *kan* and *li*.\n\nWhen the upper gate is closed, it is called \"having\"; when the lower gate is closed, it is called \"nothing.\" \"Nothing\" serves \"having\"; above, the spirit-virtue dwells within these two apertures, following the mutual necessity of having and nothing. \"When the upper gate is closed, it is called 'having'\"—the *li* Palace has form, concealing true Water. \"When the lower gate is closed, it is called 'nothing'\"—the *kan* Gate is formless, the Crimson Dragon hidden. \"Nothing\" serves \"having\"; above, the spirit-virtue dwells—when the Original Spirit rests in its palace, *qi* follows and ascends. Thus, the wonder lies in the eight gates being firmly sealed. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\n*\"The eldest son sips wine from the West,\nThe youngest daughter first opens the Northern flowers.\nIf the green moths meet thereafter,\nThe Yellow House’s gates must be locked at once.\"*\n\nThe Yellow House is the palace where the Original Spirit resides. \"These two apertures follow the mutual necessity of having and nothing\"—if the lower is not closed, fire does not gather; if the upper is not closed, the medicine does not rise. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n\n*\"Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly,\nThen let the flowing pearl unite in proper match.\"*\n\nWhat are the \"flowing pearl\" and \"earthen crucible\"? They are alternate names for the two cavities of *kan* and *li*.\n\n*\"Know the white, guard the black—\nThe numinous will come of itself.\"*\n\n\"White\" is the essence of Metal; \"black\" is the foundation of Water. \"White\" is Metal; \"black\" is Water. In the elixir method, Water is the foundation, and the essence of Metal is born within Water. Thus, to \"know the white\" is only to guard the black; when the black is guarded, the white appears of itself. How to guard it? Like a cat watching its hole, waiting for the mouse—its body unmoving, its eyes unblinking, its mind fixed solely on the mouse, without any other thought. The \"numinous\" is the heavenly mechanism. To steal this mechanism, one must first empty the heart. When the heart is empty, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, the breath settles; when the breath settles, both sides ascend as one, and the numinous clarity comes of itself. As the *Li Sao Yuan You* says:\n\n*\"Without disturbance to guard it,\nIt will naturally be one.\nThe spirit’s aperture is open—\nIn the midnight hour, preserve emptiness to await it,\nNon-action comes first.\"*\n\nThis aligns with the commentary of Master Zhu of Ziyang: *\"Master Guangcheng’s instruction to the Yellow Emperor was nothing more than this—truly the essential secret of immortals.\"*\n\nWater is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One, the beginning of *yin* and *yang*. It contains the Yellow Sprout, master of the Five Metals, the Northern River Chariot. Thus, the crucible is black without but holds golden radiance within—*wearing coarse cloth while hiding jade*. The outer appears mad, yet Water is the pivot of the Dao, the beginning of *yin* and *yang*. Why? Heaven’s One generates Water, which stands first among the Five Phases. Water’s One, when added to Earth’s Five, becomes Water’s completion number—is this not the image of the Mysterious containing the Yellow Sprout? The \"Mysterious containing the Yellow Sprout\" is Lead born within Water. Lead is the master of the Five Metals, produced within the Northern Mysterious Barrier when Earth is added. The Yellow Sprout is the golden radiance, the essence of the crucible. Thus, the crucible’s body is black without, while golden radiance is concealed within—like a priceless treasure hidden in a coarse-clad man’s embrace. The Northern River Chariot is the Emperor’s Chariot, so named because it wheels along the Celestial River. Now, when true Lead is born within Water and refined by true Fire, the River Chariot does not dare to pause in its turning but ascends to the summit of Kunlun Peak.\n\nMetal is the mother of Water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of Metal; the child harbors the mother’s womb. Metal generates Water, hence \"Metal is the mother of Water.\" Water is the child of Metal; Water contains Metal, hence \"the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child harbors the mother’s womb.\" If scholars understand the meaning of Metal within Water, they know the source of the medicine’s production.\n\nThe Perfected One is most wondrous—seeming to exist, yet not; faintly resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating. The Perfected One is the Original Spirit. \"Seeming to exist, yet not\" means it is continuous yet not forced, faintly present. \"Faintly resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating\" describes the Perfected One’s comings and goings in the great abyss—vague and indistinct, floating and sinking without fixed form. As the *Jindan Dacheng Ji* of Xiao Zixu says: *\"On Kunlun’s peak, the Yellow Flower’s path—at times leading the Original Spirit away, then returning.\"* The \"great abyss\" is Kunlun.\n\nAdvance and retreat, distribution and arrangement—each guards its own domain. In the elixir method, one advances from *zi* and retreats from *wu*; advance and retreat, distribution and arrangement—each guards its own boundary, not overstepping. As Yang Xubai’s *Jindan Chun Cui Yin* says: *\"Before the *zi-wu* furnace, advance and retreat are divided; within the *qian-kun* crucible, floating and sinking are distinct.\"*\n\nGather the white of *kan* and refine it into the vermilion. \"White\" is the white Metal; \"vermilion\" is the vermilion Mercury. \"Gather the white of *kan*\" means to gather the white Metal from the Northern *kan* Palace as the elixir’s mother—white Metal and vermilion Mercury are of the same root and follow one another. \"Refine it into the vermilion\" means daily applying the Fire to withdraw the Lead’s *qi* and add Mercury in its place. As Chen Momo’s *Chongzheng Pian* says:\n\n*\"Within, guard the River Chariot in the Northern Palace—\nSince ancient times, Heaven’s One, Water, comes first.\nWhen the tally matches, the Fire of the Zhou Heaven is established,\nThe meaning akin to a ferryboat crossing to the other shore.\nDay and night, the turning is ceaseless,\nThe subtle mechanism of the armillary sphere.\nCultivating elixir, the superior scholar—\nOnly by understanding this method can one know true Lead,\nNot needing Lead.\"*\n\nScholars merely know that the medicine is formed by the union of Lead and Mercury, yet do not understand the Fire’s work of withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. Thus, even if the elixir’s head is formed, it cannot avoid dissipation.\n\nRefine it to become the outer defense, the white within steadfastly dwelling. \"Refine it to become the outer defense\" means the true Fire operates in the outer furnace. \"The white within steadfastly dwelling\" means the golden elixir rests in the inner furnace. The inner furnace’s elixir requires the outer furnace’s Fire, refined and nurtured day and night, before it matures. As Hao Guangning’s *Taigu Ji* says: *\"At the crown, the Black Pearl’s radiance appears; in the abdomen, the secret treasure shines resplendent—is this not the Fire operating without while the elixir dwells within?\"*\n\nA square and circle, spanning but an inch, blend and support one another—born before Heaven and Earth, towering in majestic height. Flanking it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isles. Encircled and sealed, the four directions flow unimpeded; vigilant defense ensures steadfast security, barring all wickedness. Winding pavilions connect, ever watchful against the unforeseen.\n\nThe \"square and circle, spanning but an inch\" refers to the Mud-Pill Palace. Today, people merely call the heart \"the square inch,\" unaware that the three fields of the human body are all hollow, each spanning an inch, with qi and vessels interconnected. \"Blend and support one another\" means the head contains nine palaces, with the Mud-Pill at their center. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Mud-Pill’s nine spirits each have their chambers; the square and circle, spanning an inch, reside therein.\"* \"Born before Heaven and Earth\" signifies that the Mud-Pill’s single cavity is the ancestral aperture of the body’s myriad orifices—when this aperture opens, all others follow. \"Towering in majestic height\" means the Mud-Pill Palace sits atop Kunlun’s peak, the abode of the primordial spirit, corresponding above to the Dark Capital, the realm where the ten thousand spirits gather.\n\n\"Flanking it are ramparts and gates\" refers to the seven orifices arrayed around it, with the Cavern Chamber and Yellow Gates positioned before it. \"Resembling Penglai’s isles\" likens it to the three immortal mountains upon the sea, with Penglai at their summit. \"Encircled and sealed\" means withdrawing vision and returning hearing, carefully closing the senses. \"The four directions flow unimpeded\" describes the primordial harmony circulating internally, qi flowing freely as the Vermilion Bird encircles the Jade Terrace in flight. \"Vigilant defense ensures steadfast security\" is like the dragon nurturing its pearl, mind unwavering, or the hen brooding its egg, qi unbroken. \"Barring all wickedness\" means that though demonic realms may encroach, one wields the axe with self-assurance. \"Winding pavilions connect, ever watchful against the unforeseen\" means that if the spirit departs, it must be recalled, with twin youths ever guarding the cavern’s gate.\n\nThus, one may be free from anxious thought but must not succumb to toil and weariness. Tan Changzhen’s *Shuiyun Ji* states: *\"Do not hang threads upon the numinous terrace; within, the spirit embryo coalesces—only when the mind is without action does qi harmonize, and when qi harmonizes, the supreme treasure forms. When the mind acts, qi scatters, and when qi scatters, the essence dissipates.\"* Therefore, one may be free from thought but must not indulge in toil.\n\nWhen spirit and qi fill the chamber, none can retain them—those who guard them prosper; those who lose them perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, they ever accompany one. Through long accumulation and sustained effort, primordial harmony overflows. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, one must ever guard them—guarding them brings prosperity; losing them brings ruin. One must never, even for a moment, depart from vigilance.\n\nAs for those who delve into the esoteric, practicing inner visualization while lost in thought, treading the Dipper and pacing the asterisms, invoking the Six Jia, observing the days and hours, or employing the Yin Path’s suppression of the Nine Ones—all these muddle the primordial womb. Those who consume qi, expelling the old and drawing in the new, cause their intestines and stomachs to groan emptily. Those who sit in stubborn vacuity suffer through sleepless days and nights; those who exert themselves in labor disregard bodily exhaustion. Some shake their heads, roll their eyes, clench their fists, and strain their strength, only to set their hundred vessels seething, giving rise to abscesses and ulcers. Others heap earth to erect altars, worshipping at dawn and sacrificing at dusk, only to fall prey to demonic unions in their dreams, ensnared by malevolent spirits. At first, their hearts rejoice, believing they will surely prolong their years, yet suddenly, midway, they meet untimely death, their forms decaying and exposed. All these actions are perverse and contrary, blatantly violating the Yellow Emperor’s texts, their conduct errant and wholly at odds with the Old Master’s safeguards. Clinging to delusion, they reach this end—who else is to blame for their transgressions?\n\nThus, Wang Liangqi composed the *Breaking Delusion Song*, and Chen Niniwan wrote the *Luofu Lament*, enumerating the errors of the world’s heterodox arts in torrents of two or three thousand words, lamenting that later generations fail to grasp the true path and err in treading deviant ways. If today’s scholars could but peruse the words of these two masters once, they would surely recognize their errors and inwardly reflect.\n\nThe enlightened will examine their defenses and suddenly understand the proper course.\n\nLord Wei composed this *Triplex Unity*, radiant as a torch illuminating a darkened thoroughfare, precise as a needle guiding through a bewildering sea—his intent being that later enlightened ones, through these words, might fortify their resolve and suddenly comprehend the path of cultivation. Lord Wei’s heart may truly be called benevolent. Yet some dismiss his work as mere words on paper, never once fixing their gaze upon it—this is indeed self-abandonment, self-neglect; is it not lamentable?\n\n\"Diligently practice it, ceaselessly day and night.\" Qiu Changchun’s *Mingdao Collection* states: \"It is not through mere sitting or walking at dawn and dusk, twisting and contorting, that one forms the crucible. The great elixir of ninefold transmutation—golden liquid cinnabar—differs entirely from the minor comforts of heterodox methods. One must sever worldly affairs, concentrate the mind, and devote oneself wholly, practicing day and night without respite; only then can success be attained.\" Peng Zhenyi did not say in vain: \"The aspirant must cast aside sensual pleasures, forsake desires, renounce fame and profit, retreat to sacred mountains, sever ordinary ties, and cultivate in seclusion, diligently day and night without slack. Only thus may one harbor hope. Otherwise, all effort is in vain.\" This teaching is abundantly clear. Yet some, blind to this truth, insist on limiting their practice to the two daily periods of firing, and upon hearing the admonition to practice ceaselessly day and night, they recoil in astonishment and ridicule, deeming it unbearably laborious and vexing—how utterly thoughtless!\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Those who cling rigidly to form may not attain the true; dawn practice abandoned by dusk is not sincere. One cannot lightly accept the notion that the two daily periods suffice for firing.\" Formerly, Huangfu Lüdao visited Wang Sanyi, who set out counting rods and an hourglass. Asked their purpose, he replied, \"To mark the two cardinal points of noon and midnight.\" Huangfu said, \"Among the twelve hours, should there be any moment of interruption? Why limit it to noon and midnight?\" In essence, the Dao of the elixir and the Dao of Heaven are one. Does the Dao of Heaven ever pause, even for a single breath? If the Dao of Heaven never ceases for a breath, how can the Dao of the elixir tolerate even a moment’s interruption?\n\nMa Danyang’s *Gradual Awakening Collection* says: \"The master’s grace is profound and difficult to repay; I vow to encircle the walls and refine the true elixir to the death.\" \"Encircling the walls\" means cutting off human contact to focus solely on cultivation. After three years of ingesting the elixir, one may ascend and wander afar, walking through fire unscathed, entering water undampened, able to preserve or relinquish life, ever joyful and carefree. When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one conceals oneself to await the summoning of the Great One, relocating to the Central Land. When merit is complete, one ascends, receives the register, and is granted the chart.\n\nRefining the elixir requires but a moment’s effort—why then speak of three years of ingestion? The *Cui Xu Pian* clarifies: \"A moment’s effort refines and instantly manifests aged completion. One must pass three years, for after the moment of refinement, the elixir must be nurtured and warmed; one cannot abruptly depart afar.\" Zhongli Quanyang’s *Thirty-Nine Pointers to the Mysterious* states: \"The infant, young and unformed, must rely on the mother’s nurturing grace.\" This is correct. But after these three years, one moves like drifting clouds, strides like the wind, can ascend lightly and wander afar. Though the great flood reaches the heavens, one does not drown; though severe drought melts metal and stone, scorches earth and mountains, one remains unharmed. Life and death are at one’s command, and everlasting joy is attained.\n\nYet once the nurturing is complete, one must still conceal oneself among people, accumulate merit, and amass virtue to enlighten and deliver the deluded masses before one may ascend in flight. Thus, [the text is lacunose] Linggen entrusted Huangfu Lüdao to guide later disciples; Jinhua Dongshan admonished Yang Xubai not to seclude himself but to benefit all beings before ascending as an immortal. How could one attend only to one’s own perfection?\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; the *Yi* is expounded to clarify it. Of old, there were six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record*—why so many? Peng Zhenyi’s *Golden Key to the Returned Elixir* states: \"The six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record* are all similar.\" Thus, the so-called six hundred chapters are like the sixty hexagrams: the numbers of firing correspond to the sixty hexagrams, and when extended, they become six hundred chapters. The sixty hexagrams represent the phases of a single month, while the six hundred chapters represent those of ten months. Hence it is said, \"The *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; the *Yi* is expounded to clarify it.\"\n\nThe crescent moon forms the crucible and furnace; the White Tiger is the pivot of refinement; mercury is the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon rises with it, east joins west, and the essences mutually constrain one another. The crescent moon furnace is the lead furnace, its position in Kan, where the White Tiger resides. The flowing pearl palace is the mercury crucible, its position in Li, where the Green Dragon resides. The White Tiger as the pivot of refinement means the White Tiger resides in the cinnabar field, and fire issues from below the navel. The Green Dragon rising with it means driving the Green Dragon down to meet the White Tiger. East and west are Kan and Li; the essences are the sun and moon.\n\nThe origins of dragon and tiger and the sources of lead and mercury are not two separate paths. Wang Yixuan’s *Red Dragon Elixir Formula* states: \"If one discerns the dragon following the tiger and knows mercury resides in lead, then the adept, understanding the secret of driving the dragon to meet the tiger, will grasp the method of merging mercury with lead.\" The *Fuming Pian* says: \"The master points to the Green Dragon mercury, matching it with the White Tiger lead. The two essences are conjoined, water and fire refined for a year.\" And again: \"Once dragon and tiger unite in mutual embrace, Kan and Li couple and form the embryo. A molten handful of the marrow of Heaven and Earth—seek it earnestly and draw it near to sip.\" The method of the elixir is supremely simple and easy: merely unite the essence of the Green Dragon of the east with the spirit of the White Tiger of the west, and east and west are no longer separate. Naturally, dragon and tiger mate, essences merge, and the purple gold is produced.\n\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Jing*, with annotations by Wang Baoyi, explains: \"When the medicine is refined to the point of emergence, water and fire have already merged. Once water and fire unite, the dragon and tiger qi within the crucible harmonize and form the golden liquid.\" This elucidates the matter clearly. When refining the elixir, if one can empty the mind, still the thoughts, concentrate the spirit, and enter the qi cavity, then east and west unite, metal and wood merge, south and north blend, water and fire achieve balance, and the four images and five phases gather in one place, congealing without any need for exertion.\n\nAbove, the trigram Dui governs the number eight; below, the trigram Gen also governs eight. The two eights combine their essence, and the body of Qian and Kun is formed. Two eights correspond to one jin; the Dao of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced, not deviating by a single zhu. Three hundred eighty-four corresponds to the number of hexagrams and lines. When the upper firing period is governed by Dui, the moon is half bright—hence it is said, \"Above, Dui governs the number eight.\" When the lower firing period is governed by Gen, the moon is half dark—hence it is said, \"Below, Gen also governs eight.\" Observing the two firing periods together, the crucible of Qian and Kun is established, and medicine, materials, and firing are all contained within.\n\nThe two eights correspond to one jin, and the Dao of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced, for the moon has an upper and lower firing period. The upper firing period, governed by metal, weighs half a jin, totaling one hundred ninety-two zhu; the lower firing period, governed by water, also weighs half a jin, totaling one hundred ninety-two zhu. Together, they amount to three hundred eighty-four zhu. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams, each with six lines: one hundred ninety-two yang lines and one hundred ninety-two yin lines, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines. Master Wei borrows this to expound the subtlety of the elixir Way, intending nothing more than the perfect balance and correspondence of yin and yang—there is no actual three hundred eighty-four zhu, nor are there three hundred eighty-four lines.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states, \"Two eights correspond, naturally uniting in intimacy.\" The *Chensu Yangzhi Daopian* says, \"In my crucible’s silence, I harmonize the two eights.\" For \"two eights\" means two sets of eight *liang*, equal in weight, neither inclined nor biased. If one were to rigidly adhere to zhu and lines, counting breaths while fingering prayer beads, this would be self-inflicted toil—how could it be the Way of utmost simplicity and ease?\n\nMoreover, the *Fuming Pian* says, \"When square and round gather, things divide in pairs; both ascend, sharing one jin.\" The *Jindan Dacheng Ji* states, \"In the gate of two eights, those who comprehend are rare; the firing periods before and after are precisely timed.\" This refers to the *xun* gate within the body, not the upper eight *liang* and lower eight *liang* of the firing periods.\n\nWhen gold enters fierce fire, its color remains unaltered, its essence luminous. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness; gold has never lost its weight. The moon’s form endures as ever, for gold is born of the sun. At dawn, it receives the sun’s tally; at dusk, it returns to its mother, the moon, embracing and concealing its frame, sinking into the cavernous void. Gold regains its original nature, and the crucible’s radiance blazes.\n\nAll things in the world perish in fire, yet true gold does not. Among the five phases, generation culminates in metal, which is most precious. When smelted, it yields to water; when struck, it yields to fire. Its softness resembles wood, its color resembles earth—water, fire, wood, and earth, all four natures are complete within it. Thus, true gold grows ever firmer through repeated refinement, never losing the weight of its original body. Since the opening of heaven and earth, countless millennia have passed, yet the forms of the sun and moon remain unchanged, their brightness never diminished. For the essence of yin and yang each dwells in its proper abode, and thus the sun and moon endure eternally. Among celestial phenomena, none are more luminous than the sun and moon; in the art of the elixir, none are more luminous than gold and fire.\n\nGold is the moon; fire is the sun. People know only that gold is the moon’s light, yet they do not know that the moon’s light is born of the sun. The moon, being Greater Yin, has substance but no light; its waxing and waning depend on the amount of sunlight it receives. At the new moon, it first conjoins the sun; after three days, its light begins to grow; by the eighth day, the upper firing period, its light is half; by the fifteenth day, it is full. After the full moon, it gradually wanes; by the twenty-third day, the lower firing period, it is half dark; by the thirtieth day, it is completely dark.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, as it separates from the sun, it receives the sun’s light and begins to brighten, its body gradually whitening. At dusk, it embraces the sun, its essence lingering while its light vanishes, its body turning entirely black.\n\nIn the elixir Way, this is explained as follows: gold, born of the sun, receives the sun’s tally at dawn—True Yin gold arises in the Kun Palace, transformed by the True Yang fire. Its initial reception of qi is like the moon receiving the sun’s light, beginning at the new moon. When gold returns to its mother, embracing the moon at dusk, it is like gold in the Kun Palace guarding the fire, akin to the moon at dusk embracing the sun. When the crucible’s frame sinks into the cavernous void, spirit and qi deeply enter their root, gradually descending to the sea bottom, like the moon’s essence disappearing from sight. When gold regains its original nature and the crucible’s radiance blazes, the moon’s body, originally black, becomes white upon receiving the sun’s light. Now, embracing the sun and concealing its frame, it returns to its original blackness. By guarding its blackness and not seeking its whiteness, after long perseverance, spirit and illumination naturally arrive. In an instant, light and flame penetrate the crucible; the fire’s power blazes intensely. Then, on the third day, *geng* is born, the Dui gate opens, and black silver melts, yielding white silver.\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three; the numbers of *wu* and *si* total five. When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals are properly ordered. *Zi* water is one, *wu* fire is two; the numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three, the number of earth. Thus, the central *wu* and *si* are called five. Three and five together make eight—hence the term \"eight minerals.\" When three and five harmonize, water, fire, and earth unite as one. Though earth overcomes water and water overcomes fire, how can they harmonize? Now, earth acts as the mediator between water and fire, reconciling and uniting them, so that water and fire become husband and wife—thus they harmonize. When the eight minerals are properly ordered, water, fire, and earth unite as one, and the guiding principles are set right, all things fall into place.\n\nBreathing contains and nurtures; pausing, they become husband and wife. The ascent of yang and descent of yin—this is the breathing of heaven and earth.\n\nWithin it, heaven and earth breathe—thus they endure. If one can emulate heaven and earth’s breathing within, one may likewise share in their endurance.\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* states: \"Exhaling connects the heart and lungs; inhaling connects the kidneys and liver. Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds arise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs. Through this breathing, wind and clouds congeal into golden liquid—this is the natural respiration of the single *qi*, not the breathing of mouth and nose.\"\n\nThe *Hunyuan Baozhang* of Li Changyuan says: \"At the place of the True Man’s breathing, let the maiden come and go in flight. Empty the heart, concentrate the spirit, turn the light inward, and observe at the True Man’s breathing—follow its ascent and descent, comply with its spontaneity, and abide in it for a moment. When breathing contains and nurtures, stillness arises of itself, then all coalesces into one, husband and wife unite.\"\n\nWhat is the place of the True Man’s breathing? Liao Chanhui’s *Sancheng Neipian* says: \"Facing the navel wheel, behind the kidneys, at the center lies the True Golden Tripod—this is the place of the True Man’s breathing.\"\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: \"Behind is the secret gate, before is the gate of life. Sun emerges, moon enters—breathe and abide in the person.\" Yet most do not reach this, so their breathing does not reside here.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *Nanhua Zhenjing* says: \"The True Man breathes from the heels; the multitude breathe from the throat.\" Breathing from the throat is shallow and short; breathing from the heels is long and continuous. In cultivation, when the breath becomes profoundly deep, one’s life rests in oneself, no longer molded by the great forge.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* says: \"Below the heart, above the kidneys, west of the liver, left of the lungs—neither intestines nor stomach, a single *qi* flows freely through it.\" This is clearly and directly pointed out—what doubt remains? What doubt remains?\n\nYellow earth is the father of metal, flowing pearl the mother of water. Water takes earth as its dam; earth fills water so it does not rise. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding the balance to adjust victory and defeat. If water surges, fire is extinguished—both perish and return to the thick earth. When the three natures unite, they guard their original nature and share a common ancestor.\n\nEarth dwells at the center, hence it is called yellow earth. Earth generates metal, so it is the father of metal. Flowing pearl is mercury—wandering and restless, it is called flowing pearl. When flowing pearl enters water, it congeals into true gold. Gold generates water, so flowing pearl is the mother of water. Now, when earth enters water, water is restrained by earth and cannot bear metal upward, so it is said: \"Water takes earth as its dam; earth fills water so it does not rise.\" If the Vermilion Bird’s fire from the south is used to fiercely boil and intensely forge, fire flourishes and water boils, causing the metal to ascend with the water.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of southern fire, governing summer. Now, when Kan water is restrained by earth’s dam, fire can boil it, making it rise. Thus it is said: \"The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding the balance to adjust victory and defeat.\" When boiling water ascends into the southern Li palace, Li fire is in turn overcome by Kan water. If fire is extinguished by water, water must not overflow. Thus, earth overcomes water, and water, restrained by earth, stops. It is said: \"If water surges, fire is extinguished—both perish and return to the thick earth.\" When water and fire encounter earth, this is called the three natures. Once the three natures guard and unite, they merge into one and all return to the Kun palace. Thus it is said: \"When the three natures unite, they guard their original nature and share a common ancestor.\"\n\n*Giant sesame* still extends life; *returned elixir* may be ingested. Metal’s nature does not decay, so it is the treasure of the myriad things. When alchemists consume it, their lifespan is prolonged.\n\nGiant sesame is sesame—consuming it still extends life. The nine-times-cycled great returned elixir is the flourishing essence of metal, secretly drawing the upright *qi* of heaven and earth to form the sacred embryo. How could it not grant long life? Moreover, metal’s nature is firm and unyielding, enduring ten thousand years without decay, so it is the supreme treasure among the myriad things. Rightly do immortals value it. Thus, it is not called the elixir of water, fire, wood, or earth, but uniquely named the *golden elixir*.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.\n\nEarth has no fixed position but circulates among Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. In Chen, it is late spring; in Wei, late summer; in Xu, late autumn; in Chou, late winter. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all places where earth travels, so it is said: \"Earth travels through the four seasons.\" Earth can exhaust water and conceal fire. Guarding water, water does not flow; guarding fire, fire does not flame. Now, using it to guard Kun while gathering medicine, and to guard Qian while circulating fire—thus it is said: \"Guarding boundaries and setting rules.\"\n\nWhen golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain.\n\nWhen golden sand ascends the tripod, it pierces the two kidneys, guides the spine, passes through the heart meridian, enters the sea of marrow, rushes through the lung’s transport point, traverses the liver, passes the spleen, and returns to the cinnabar field. As it ascends, it billows like clouds and mist filling the four directions; suddenly, it arrives like a violent wind and rain. Vaguely, it is like awakening from a daydream; clearly, it is like a grave illness leaving the body. Spirit and energy unite like husband and wife in embrace; bones and flesh melt and harmonize like rising from a bath. These are all true scenes, not metaphors.\n\nThe *Fuming Pian* says: \"Not knowing, one might think *qi* arrives afterward—only through direct experience can it be known.\"\n\nFumigating and steaming reach the four limbs; complexion becomes radiant and lustrous. White hair all turns black; fallen teeth regrow in their original places. Old men return to youth; aged women become maidens. Their form changes, freeing them from worldly calamities—they are called True Men.\n\nAfter obtaining the elixir, nurture it day and night without interruption. Then true *qi* fumigates and steams the four limbs, naturally refreshing spirit and energy, brightening the complexion. White hair returns to black; fallen teeth regrow. Old men become youths; aged women become maidens. From this, they transform their form, transcend the world, leap from the cage, and are called True Men.\n\nMoreover, it has been said: if humans stand alongside heaven and earth as the three powers, they may share their beginning and end. Now then...\n\nHeaven and earth are without end, yet human lifespan does not reach a hundred years—why is this? It is because humans, within heaven and earth, are but one thing among many. Though more numinous than other creatures and thus called \"human,\" how can they truly stand alongside heaven and earth? Yet if one seizes the mechanism of heaven and earth to refine the Golden Elixir of Liquid Gold, then one may share their beginning and end—this is called a True Man. Having become a True Man, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood, no longer bound to their former form. Roaming beyond the world of things, they forever escape the calamities of the dusty realm.\n\nLead powder cast into fire loses its color and reverts to lead; ice and snow, when warmed by hot water, melt and become primordial water. Cinnabar serves as the foundation, harmonizing with mercury—transformation arises from their true nature, and beginning and end follow one another. To concoct an elixir for immortality, one must use substances of the same kind: just as planting grain requires millet, and hatching chicks requires eggs, so too must things of the same nature be employed to achieve natural transformation. Smelting fish eyes cannot produce pearls; artemisia cannot become sandalwood. Only like begets like—disparate things cannot form treasures. Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes, foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses, water does not blaze upward, and fire does not moisten downward.\n\nLead powder is originally black lead; when refined by fire, it becomes white. Yet if cast back into fire, it reverts to lead. Ice and snow are congealed yin *qi*; when scalded with warm water, they dissolve into water. Why is this? It is the principle of returning to the root and reverting to the source—this cannot be otherwise. The method of refining gold takes cinnabar as its foundation, blending it with mercury, for mercury is born from cinnabar and shares its nature. Thus, beginning and end follow one another, and transformation arises from their truth.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"When bamboo splits, use bamboo to mend it; to hatch a chick, use an egg.\" All things that are not of the same kind are but vain labor, striving in vain to match the true mechanism. For when true mercury meets true lead, the *qi* of one yin and one yang resonate as one—this is the meaning of \"same kind.\" It is like planting grain, which requires millet, or hatching chicks, which requires eggs. When like follows like, the Way proceeds naturally, effortlessly achieving transformation. But if one abandons the like and seeks elsewhere, it is like trying to make fish eyes into pearls or artemisia into sandalwood—since they are not of the same kind, how can transformation occur? Just as swallows give birth to swallows and sparrows to sparrows, they cannot give birth to phoenixes. Foxes nurse foxes, rabbits nurse rabbits—they cannot nurse horses. Fire’s nature is to blaze upward; can it be made to moisten downward?\n\nShall water’s nature, which moistens downward, be made to blaze upward? Thus, those who wish to refine elixirs for transcendence must employ what is of the same kind—only the like follows the like; if affairs are contrary, no treasure is formed.\n\nYet within our own bodies there is naturally a heaven and an earth, naturally a yin and a yang. The *Huanyuan Pian* speaks of \"seizing the marrow of another heaven and earth\" and \"copulating for a fleeting moment,\" claiming one must steal the *qi* of heaven and earth, the *qi* of the sacred father sun and numinous mother moon, to transform the *qi* of our own bodies—the *qi* of flesh and blood from our mundane parents—into the *qi* of true parents, transmuting the mundane body into a body of pure yang, a true immortal, thereby attaining the same lifespan as heaven and earth.\n\nYet some, benighted in their search for the like, fail to recognize the like within themselves and the Qian and Kun of their own bodies, instead seeking it outside. Falsely designating virgin maidens as true lead, they invoke the affairs of the *Huangdi Neijing* to adorn their heterodox doctrines, catering to the desires of scholar-officials. Thus, wealthy families and noble houses practice their arts, often meeting with death—this was not limited to the Tang Chancellor Xiahou Zi alone.\n\nTherefore, Ge Hong in the *Baopuzi* likened it to holding ice in a cup to boil soup or wrapping fire in feathers, while Tao Hongjing in the *Zhen’gao* compared it to embracing jade and leaping into fire or a golden coffin descending into a dog’s den. Fang Xuanling called them \"dogs and swine in human form,\" and Li Shangyin branded them \"seeds of hell.\" Ancient and modern alchemical texts unanimously condemn this practice in the harshest terms, for it harms others and ultimately destroys the practitioner as well.\n\nThe *Nanhua Zhenjing* states: \"Do not labor your form, do not shake your essence—only then can you attain longevity.\" Never has there been mention of so-called \"mastery of women\" as a method. Who has sown this pernicious seed, which to this day remains an obstacle, defaming the ancient perfected ones and misleading later students? Among the myriad heterodox arts, is this not the most harmful to the Dao?\n\nMany scholars in the world, though learned and talented, meet with no opportunity. They exhaust their fires and squander their wealth, following texts and fabricating interpretations, their beginnings without cause, their measures without control. They pound and refine arsenolite, mica, arsenopyrite, magnetite, and sulfur, burn camphorwood, mix mercury, fly and smelt the Five Minerals and copper, using them as auxiliary agents. Yet their natures are disparate—how can they willingly unite as one? A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to refine becomes folly.\n\nFortune never favors them, and even the wise grow old with white hair, midway beset by doubts. They turn from the Dao and cling to delusion, stepping from the correct path into deviant byways. Their vision is narrow, their understanding limited—they cannot fathom what lies ahead.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true master, do not force conjecture.\nFor the alchemical classics lack oral transmission—\nWhere shall you form the numinous embryo?\"*\n\nIndeed, the world abounds with talented and diligent scholars, yet few encounter a true teacher and receive the correct transmission.\n\nThose who burn and refine the Three Yellows and Four Spirits, deludedly believing the Dao lies therein, fail to recognize that the Five Metals and Eight Stones are mundane, tangible substances. Their kinds differ, their natures and properties vary—how can they willingly unite as one?\n\nThus, all who practice such arts meet with a thousand failures for every ten thousand attempts; what they seek to refine becomes folly. Why? Because their beginnings lack cause, their measures lack control.\n\nThe *Zhiyuan* chapter thirty-nine states:\n*\"Seeking teachers and friends, they learn to refine cinnabar,\nMaking the Great Return, thinking external elixirs transform inner medicine.\nYet metals and stones share no connection—\nThe Golden Elixir and Great Return Elixir arise from nothing,\nWhile cinnabar and mercury are but metaphors.\nAlas! People fail to recognize true lead and mercury,\nTaking mundane cinnabar and mercury as real.\nThey exhaust their fires and waste their wealth,\nAchieving nothing, their hair turning white in vain,\nOnly to sigh at the emptiness of it all.\"*\n\nAh! The true Dao is simple, not complex; its words are plain, without embellishment. Who believes it? Who practices it? Even those who receive the correct transmission may midway grow doubtful, thus stepping from the correct path into deviant byways.\n\nThe *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states:\n*\"Those who rely on cleverness to force right and wrong,\nEven if they hear the essential teachings, contradict themselves.\"*\n\nTurning from the great Dao to cling to delusion, peering at the heavens through a tube—how can their narrow vision suffice to discuss the boundless mysteries of what lies ahead?\n\nAs for the utmost sages: none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth; King Wen of Zhou, who followed the trigrams and composed the line statements; and Confucius, the paragon of all sages, who added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, raised by heaven, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, their merits and virtues shared the same principle, their creations building upon one another with meticulous care.\n\nFuxi modeled heaven and earth to create the *Yijing*, first drawing the Eight Trigrams. In the Primordial Unity Diagram, Qian-heaven is above, Kun-earth below; Li-sun and Kan-moon are arrayed in the east and west, while Zhen-thunder, Xun-wind, Gen-mountain, and Dui-marsh occupy the four corners. Was this without precedent?\n\nKing Wen followed the structure of the trigrams to compose the *Yijing*, writing the line statements. In the Later Heaven Diagram, Zhen and Xun, the two woods, generate Li-fire; then Kun-earth stores them. Dui and Qian, the two metals, generate Kan-water; then Gen-earth halts them. Was this without precedent?\n\nConfucius followed Fuxi and King Wen to expound the *Yijing*, composing the Ten Wings. Though he held no imperial throne in his time, he became the teacher of emperors for ten thousand generations—truly the paragon of all sages.\n\nThese three lords were the great sages of antiquity. Fuxi lived in high antiquity, King Wen at the end of the Shang, and Confucius in the late Zhou. They arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, in terms of merit and virtue, the former and later sages shared the same principle.\n\nMoreover, in the drawing of the Eight Trigrams, the composition of the line statements, and the writing of the Ten Wings, there are no superfluous words, no superfluous characters. Their deliberations on weight and measure are exceedingly precise, for their creations all had precedents.\n\nNow, Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, borrowing the symbolic trigrams of the *Yijing* to elucidate its principles—truly, he had precedent.\n\nTangible things can be measured, signs can be contemplated; affairs can be planned to serve as models for the world. This book, though lacking prior knowledge, relies on the master’s enlightenment—like drawing back a curtain or ascending a high terrace. Tangible things with signs can be measured and contemplated, but the Golden Elixir and Great Cinnabar are matters without form or sign—they cannot be measured or contemplated.\n\nShould it not be expounded in words, how then could later generations take it as their model? This is why the *Cantong Qi* was composed. Yet in composing the *Cantong Qi*, did Wei Boyang merely express his own views? No—he but recorded the principles transmitted by his master. As the *Xisheng Jing* states: \"Without the guidance of an enlightened teacher, how can one resolve doubts and difficulties?\" Even in worldly arts and techniques, one must bow in reverence to seek a master before attaining their safeguards—how much more so for the Golden Elixir and Great Cinnabar, the Dao of longevity and transcendence? Should the scholar not humble their heart and inquire widely, hoping for an encounter?\n\nGe Zichuan’s *Divine Immortals’ Records* tells of Liu Zheng, who sought the arts of nurturing life, diligently pursuing rare teachings and traveling a thousand *li* without hesitation. If he found one superior to himself, though they be a servant or guest, he would take them as his teacher. If people today could emulate Liu’s refusal to feel shame in asking those beneath him, true immortals would come to their door, shattering the cinnabar caves. Once they receive the oral instructions, all doubts dissolve—bright as drawing back a curtain or removing its cover, vast as ascending a high terrace to gaze upon the boundless distance. The heart and eyes would open in clarity—would this not be a great joy?\n\nThe *Six Hundred Chapters on Fire* and its aims differ not in essence. The *Awakening to Reality* states: \"The *Canon*, *Treatises*, *Songs*—all expound the utmost truth, yet never commit the fire-phase to writing.\" Know that to fathom the subtle oral instructions, one must discuss them in detail with an immortal. Later learners, failing to grasp the true trap, see only the so-called *Six Hundred Chapters on Fire* and are left bewildered, believing the fire-phase to be so intricate and difficult. Little do they realize that the six hundred chapters are but like the sixty hexagrams: the sixty hexagrams mark the phases of a single month, while the six hundred chapters span ten months. For in one month, sixty hexagrams, each alike; in ten months, six hundred chapters, each similar. Thus it is said, \"their aims differ not in essence.\"\n\nThe written word is solemn—yet people do not ponder deeply to trace its source and flow, though the hidden and manifest originally dwell together. I dare speak only to the worthy, not presuming to write lightly. To remain silent would sever the Dao and incur blame; to commit thoughts to bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally. Thus I hesitate, sighing, looking up and down, ever deliberating. There is a method to refinement, yet I dare not reveal it all. I shall but outline its framework, its branches appearing sparse.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, alchemical texts fill storehouses like oxen laden with books, their thousand names and myriad words offering endless analogies—could this not be called solemn? Yet tracing their source and flow, one finds nothing but the interplay of yin and yang. These two emerge from the same origin though named differently. The ancient immortals poured out their livers and gallbladders to instruct the world, yet people, their karmic blessings shallow, have no leisure for deep reflection.\n\nNow, Master Wei composed this book, pointing out the origins of the crucible and vessel, the sources of the medicines, the methods of the fire-phase, and the secret teachings on existence and nonexistence, host and guest, priority and sequence. His words reach the root, each character grounded in truth—composed for the worthy of the world, not lightly written to fish for empty fame. Know that books are transmitted to the enlightened, affairs valued by the discerning. A farmer given a vermilion bow would use it to scare birds; a southerner given a dragon robe would use it to carry firewood. The great Dao of the golden elixir is cherished only by the worthy—how could I speak much to those who do not understand?\n\nThe *Supreme Mysterious Regulations* states: \"To meet a person and not transmit is to lose the celestial Dao; to transmit recklessly to the unworthy is to leak the celestial treasure. To transmit to the right person brings merit to the body; to transmit recklessly brings dark punishment to the seven ancestors.\" Thus, Master Wei, about to seal his lips and remain silent, would sever the lineage of the Dao and incur blame. Yet to commit his thoughts to bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally and inviting retribution. Thus he hesitated, sighing, looking up and down, ever deliberating. Though he wished to speak plainly and directly to instruct later learners, he dared not lightly reveal the true mechanism. Instead, he briefly described the medicines and fire-phase in broad strokes, so that later generations might grasp the intent behind the words—thus, perhaps, this Dao would not be lost in transmission.\n\nHaving neither the courage to speak plainly nor the heart to keep silent, he could only present its grand framework and distill its essential mechanism, scattering the methods of refinement across three chapters, like branches sparsely arrayed.\n\nTo use gold as a dike, water enters and flows freely. Gold is reckoned at fifteen, and the water’s number is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts water in excess. These two form the true gold, heavy as its original state, while earth does not enter. The two move together, and the three substances mutually embrace, their transformations wondrous as a spirit.\n\nTo use gold as a dike, water enters and flows freely: above, half a *jin* of gold serves as the outer furnace’s southeastern semicircular dike. Then below, half a *jin* of water descends from the west into the northern inner furnace, its force unhurried, flowing naturally. \"Gold is reckoned at fifteen\" refers to the first fifteen days, meaning the upper half-*jin* of gold. \"The water’s number is the same\" refers to the sixteenth to thirtieth days, meaning the lower half-*jin* of water.\n\nThe elixir method first ascends with civil fire, then descends with martial fire. Without this, it cannot deeply reach the nine springs below. Thus it is said, \"When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts water in excess.\" Gold and water, each half, together form the weight of sixteen *liang*—one opening and one closing, endlessly circulating—these are the true yin and yang of our bodies. Yet water must exceed half a *jin*, while gold must not fall short of its half-*jin* weight. Thus it is said, \"These two form the true gold, heavy as its original state.\"\n\n\"Its earth does not enter\": around the crucible and vessel, there is only the upper half-*jin* of gold and the lower half-*jin* of water—earth has no fixed place. The phrase \"does not enter\" does not mean it does not enter at all. Earth has no fixed position; there is nowhere it does not enter. Consider the twenty-four positions of heaven and earth—though there is no *wu-ji*, is there truly no *wu-ji*? From *ren-zi* to *gan-hai*, it moves without constancy, above and below without permanence—all are the realms where *wu-ji* roams. \"The two move together with it\": throughout the crucible and vessel, earth is everywhere, and the two—gold and water—accompany it. When gold, water, and earth move together, the three substances mutually embrace and merge into one. Merged into one, they abide in the green mountains, a myriad acres of clouds, dredging from the azure pool a wheel of moon—such are their transformations, wondrous as a spirit.\n\nThe *Chapter on the Utmost Dao* states: \"Ascending and descending are called the movement of gold and water; when *xun* is true, it is called the wind.\" Ascending is gold, descending is water, and that which enables their ascent and descent is earth. Yet gold, water, and earth are but metaphors and analogies. In truth, the great Dao has always been beyond names and forms; the true immortals originally had no flowers or grasses—what gold and water could there be? What earth could there be?\n\nBeneath lies the latent *qi* of the Great Yang, steaming and seething; in but a moment, it first liquefies and then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot. The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* states: \"In refining the elixir, follow the *zi* hour when the Yang *qi* arises to kindle the fire, for only then is its power complete. If the fire is kindled at any other time, it will not be so.\" For at the *zi* hour, the Great Yang resides in the north, and the *qi* of the human body reaches the *Weilü* Pass. If the fire is kindled at this moment, inner and outer align, allowing one to steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth and complete the elixir.\n\nAt first, the Great Yang lies below, and water and fire unite in intercourse; the two *qi* intertwine, steaming to become liquid. Next, fire arises within the water, and the Yang *qi* gradually blazes; the liquid then congeals within, pressing forth the golden radiance—this is called true lead. When it is set in motion and ascends, it surges upward like a chariot coursing along the Yellow Way, and so it is named the Yellow Chariot.\n\nAs the years and months draw to their end, nature is harmed and lifespan diminished. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, the celestial revolution nears completion: the sun reaches its limit in the lunar mansion, its cycle exhausted in the reckoning. In the Way of the elixir, the human body likewise has its own revolution of Heaven, no different from that of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe bodily form resembles gray ash, like dust upon a bright window. An ancient song says: \"Use the bud, not the lead—you must work within the lead.\" Yet when it comes to using the lead, to use the lead is still mistaken. It further states: \"Lead is the mother of the bud, the bud the child of lead.\" Once the golden radiance is obtained, to discard the lead is to invite deep peril.\n\nPeople merely know that at the hour of *zi*, the *qi* of the kidneys arises; when refined by fire, it congeals into liquid, and they take this to be true lead, seeking to use it to transform the true mercury of *Li* Palace. Yet they do not consider that once it has become liquid, it possesses form and substance—its weight is turbid, how could it reverse its flow and ascend? The work of immortals in making the elixir does not employ its substance at this moment, but only ignites fire below to stir its *qi*. When the fire’s power grows strong, its *qi* surges upward like the rising clouds of mountains and rivers. Only after ascending into the *Niwan* Palace does it transform into sweet rain, descending into the *Chonglou*. Thus, the elixir method speaks of \"taking the clear and discarding the turbid\"—this is precisely what it means. The clear floats above, resembling dust upon a bright window; the turbid sinks below, resembling the body as gray ash.\n\nThose who refine the external elixir take what flies and congeals upon the lid of the crucible, calling it \"bright window dust.\" Master Wei used this to elucidate the internal elixir, wishing practitioners to grasp and extend the principle. \"Pound and blend together, then hasten through the Crimson Gate\": \"Pound and blend together\" means capturing from two places to unite in one furnace, where divine water coalesces into true butter. \"Hasten through the Crimson Gate\" means seizing the essence of the hare and crow, the marrow, and swiftly gathering it into the crucible to refine.\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir is born in *Kun* and planted in *Qian*. *Qian* above serves as the crucible, *Kun* below as the furnace. Without fierce refining and extreme forging, it cannot emerge from the furnace; without reversing its course and revolving counterflow, it cannot ascend to the crucible. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Grasp with both hands and force them to fight, transforming into a lump of purple gold frost.\" It further states: \"The river chariot dare not pause, swiftly transporting it to the peak of Kunlun.\" This describes the post-heavenly work of initial practice, distinct from the pre-heavenly moment of medicine production. Within it, there are also the dual practices of observing the mind and absorbing the spirit, both aiding the power of the fire-timing. Ancient immortals often kept these secret, and who would know them? Some cling to the methods of initial practice, engaging in massage, guiding, and revolving the windlass—vainly exhausting spirit and strength. How could they recognize the wondrous use of moving the spirit-fire to observe the true mind, or stirring the *Xun* wind to absorb the true spirit?\n\nSecure the barriers and fortify the defenses to ensure perfection and firmness. The *Jindan Dacheng Ji* says: \"Know the time, begin the work, gather what comes, and secure the divine hut without careless leakage.\" It further states: \"Carry it to the crown, where the three flowers gather; tightly seal the Jade Pass and golden lock.\" When the golden sand ascends to the crucible, one must secure and seal it meticulously—only then will the sacred embryo be complete and firm.\n\nBlazing fire spreads below, and the sounds of dragon and tiger grow earnest. The thirty-ninth chapter of the *Zhixuan* says: \"Simply slip into the Hua Chi crucible, where true fire blazes heavenward to forge.\" The *Jianwu Jian* states: \"Because the fire of the elixir blazes below, the waters of the Yellow River reverse their flow\"—this is the fire of refinement, which cannot but blaze. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Tiger leaps, dragon soars, the wind and waves coarse; at the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born.\" The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Dragon chants, tiger roars, lead and mercury burn together, revealing yellow buds and white snow.\" When the fire in the elixir field blazes fiercely, clouds steam and mists surge; wind stirs in the *Niwan*, and the sounds of dragon chanting and tiger roaring naturally arise. Peng Helin’s *Yuanshu Ge* says: \"Having received the formula, return to test the refinement—see the dragon and tiger contend in an instant. The nine flowers bloom in the heavens, and those who know this will witness a night of wind and thunder shaking ten thousand mountains.\" Those who have undergone trials will understand this for themselves.\n\nBegin with civil and end with martial; the array is complete. At the outset of gathering the medicine, concentrate the spirit, gather the *qi*, and harmonize the breath—inhale and exhale should follow the hand. When the spirit and *qi* enter their root, close tightly, but not too urgently; release freely, but not too loosely. Only by making it continuous and unbroken will the spirit naturally congeal over time, and the breath naturally settle. After a while, the *Xun* gate thunders, dragon soars and tiger leaps—then drive it back to the tail cavity, where flames surge into the celestial thoroughfare, rushing straight upward. Wang Baoyi said: \"Civil fire is the fire of generation; martial fire is the fire of fruition.\" The beginning is generation, the end fruition—begin with civil and end with martial; they cannot be pursued by a single method.\n\nObserve and inspect with utmost care, carefully adjusting warmth and coolness. \"Observe and inspect with utmost care\" means sealing the *Dui*, lowering the gaze, containing the light, and silently awaiting the arrival of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*. Only then should you stabilize the breath to gather it, concentrate the fire to refine it—you must examine its maturity, not acting carelessly. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"It all depends on the power of cultivation; even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir—how could it be done lightly?\" \"Carefully adjusting warmth and coolness\" means regulating the fire’s power, examining and proceeding cautiously, gradually shifting from gentle to fierce—do not rush or advance hastily. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"The fire-timing must be firmly stable; the blowing and breathing entirely rely on the *Xun* wind—how could it be rushed?\"\n\nRevolve through the twelve nodes, each one more intimate than the last. The twelve nodes are the twelve celestial stems of the Zhou Tian, corresponding in the body to the fire-timing and positions. The twelve nodes of fire-timing ascend from *zi* to *wu*, then descend, circling the exterior of the crucible like the twelve celestial stems of Heaven. When the twelve nodes have all been traversed, the Zhou Tian completes, and the celestial ridge once more points to *zi*—thus it is said: \"Revolve through the twelve nodes, each one more intimate than the last.\" The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"The *Zhen* trigram moves to return to the west, the *Dui* region; the three Yangs and the alchemical maiden play with bright pendants. The *Xun* wind stirs the coral tree, entering *Gen* to return to *Kun*—another Yang shares this same defense.\"\n\nWhen *qi* is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and let the *po* and *hun* souls die. In refining the golden elixir to seek immortality, why does Master Wei speak of *qi* being exhausted, life nearing its end, and resting to let the *po* and *hun* souls die? The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"Hasten to return the hundred vessels to their source; when the pulse halts and *qi* ceases, the elixir begins to form.\" When the golden liquid congeals, the jade pivot and balance wheel stop turning at once, and the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* sink into the northern sea’s depths, hidden away—thus it is said: \"*Qi* is exhausted, life nears its end, rest and let the *po* and *hun* souls die.\" The so-called death is not true death—at this moment, one returns to the root and restores life; the spirit congeals, essence solidifies, the eight vessels all halt, and breath ceases. The *qi* seems exhausted, as if cut off. Yet after this death, one revives anew—this is what the *Shangqing Ji* calls: \"This time, truly dead, only now alive.\" Alas! To know the moment when the great medicine forms, when the six pulses all stop and *qi* does not flow—without having personally experienced such scenes, how could one speak of them with certainty?\n\nWhen the hue shifts further to a radiant purple, the Returned Elixir is thus formed. The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Shedding yellow to don purple—what is the reason? Only because the River Chariot has turned many times.\" For when the ninefold firing sequence is complete, the Returned Elixir blazes forth in luminous splendor, transforming into the color of purple gold.\n\nConsume it as a single pellet—even the tiniest *daogui* is most wondrous. The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"Gather it, refine it—before a moment passes, the *qi* drifts subtly through the Three Passes. The Three Passes come and go, the *qi* endless; a single white channel ascends to the Mud Pill. Atop the Mud Pill stands the Purple Gold Tripod, within which a lump of purple gold coalesces, transmuting into jade nectar that flows into the mouth, fragrant and sweet, refreshing and cool upon the tongue. Swallow it, ingest it—it enters the five viscera, harmonizing the organs, the body at ease and secure. For the Returned Elixir, when taken, is as sweet as licorice, as cool as calamus—this is what is called the *daogui*: merely the tip of a knife’s edge, a corner’s fragment. Yet when its work is complete, it undergoes a thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, its wonders unfathomable—no minor art of side doors can compare. Rightly is it called divine!\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases is concise yet not cumbersome. The *Yi* says: \"Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten\"—these are the generative and completed numbers of the Five Phases.\n\nMaster Zihua said: Of the great numbers of Heaven and Earth, none surpasses five, none centers upon five. For five is the number of Earth, positioned at the center. Combined with the one of northern Water, it becomes six; with the two of southern Fire, it becomes seven; with the three of eastern Wood, it becomes eight; with the four of western Metal, it becomes nine—nine being the utmost of numbers. The numbers of the world end at nine. In terms of the nine numbers, five stands amid one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, and nine, truly the central number.\n\nNumbers originally have no ten. What is called the completed number ten of Earth arises when the one of the north, the two of the south, the three of the east, and the four of the west converge at the center and form ten. Thus, when the five of the center disperses to the four directions, it becomes six, seven, eight, and nine, and Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal all rely on Earth to be completed. If the one, two, three, and four of the four directions return to the center and form ten, then Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal all revert to their root and return to Earth.\n\nAh, how profound! The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Two things are born of the child, producing the mother.\" The *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: \"The four positions are distinct, their use inverted; the Five Phases arise together and return together.\" Both expound this meaning. Though the generative and completed numbers of the Five Phases may be recited even by a child of three feet, how many truly grasp their significance? If one does not know their significance, how can one attain their practical use?\n\nHerein lies the subtlety of the Dao: profound and distant. To the enlightened, it is simple and easy; to the deluded, it grows ever more complex and difficult.\n\nWhen water is cast to quench fire, the flame is suddenly extinguished. When the sun and moon eclipse, it is always at the new and full moons. When Water flourishes, Kan encroaches upon Yang; when Fire declines, Li’s daylight dims. Yin and Yang consume each other, their interaction the natural course of the Dao.\n\nShao Kangjie’s *Huangji Jingshi Shu* says: \"The mutual eclipsing of the sun and moon is the intersection of numbers. When the moon obscures the sun at full moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon covers the sun, the sun is eclipsed—just as Water and Fire overcome each other.\" Now, when water is cast to quench fire, fire is overcome by water, and the flame is suddenly extinguished. When Greater Yin obscures Greater Yang, Yang is vanquished by Yin, and the sunlight darkens in broad daylight. Why? When Yin and Yang interact, they inevitably consume each other—this is the natural course of the Dao.\n\nMaster Wei borrowed the mechanism of solar and lunar eclipses to illuminate the wonders of the Elixir Way, and further employed the mutual overcoming of Water and Fire to expound it. Truly, he was thorough.\n\nYet though solar and lunar eclipses always occur at the new and full moons, those who refine the Golden Elixir steal from Heaven and Earth, seize the workings of Creation—how could they not seek that which lies between the new and full moons?\n\nNames define essence; words arise from nature. When Metal returns to its nature, it is first called the Returned Elixir. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"One thing divides into two. Knowing the two is called naming the two.\" The two are Metal and Wood. Metal and Wood are originally not two bodies, so when Metal is named, Wood is termed; when Wood is nature, Metal is essence. In truth, they are one thing. For the Metal Lord is originally the child of the eastern household, sent to lodge in the western neighbor—its body born, it cannot yet be called the Returned Elixir. Only when it is poured into the eastern Yang’s crucible of Creation, returns home to meet the Blue Maiden, and produces a luminous pearl like the full moon, is it truly called the Returned Elixir.\n\nSome say: \"When stillness is unmoving, essence returns to nature—hence it is called the Returned Elixir.\" This is correct, yet it does not capture the original meaning of Metal’s essence and Wood’s nature in this chapter of Master Wei’s work. I dare not fabricate, nor imitate the ancients.\n\nThe *Ancient Records* speak of Dragon and Tiger; the *Yellow Emperor* praises Golden Flower; *Huainan* refines Autumn Stone; Wang Yang cherishes Yellow Sprout—none but veiled terms to convey their subtle meaning. Now, would Master Wei, in composing this work, recklessly invent empty theories to indulge his whims? No, he too followed the ancients’ subtle intent.\n\nMaster Zhu said of his use of words: \"All are based on ancient texts.\" This is no empty claim.\n\nThe worthy can uphold and practice it; the unworthy must not be allowed to partake. When Guzi followed Zihua Zi on his travels for twelve years, his studies complete, he took his leave. Zihua Zi admonished him, saying: \"Now, what you have cultivated, I find no fault in. Yet your aspirations are too broad and indiscriminate. Alas! You will later be one who selects. There will be those who strip away your outer defenses and build their own palaces; who mount your chariot and ride it to gallop across the four outskirts; who take what you hold as jade, shatter it, and divide it fivefold. The Dao inherently detests imbalance, for imbalance obstructs the Dao. Yet it also detests not finding its proper balance, for improper balance harms the Dao. Now you depart—if you reflect on how to guard your balance, then in this too I find no fault.\"\n\nMaster Wei’s words—*\"The worthy can uphold and practice it; the unworthy must not be allowed to partake\"*—reveal his profound concern. For the unworthy are surely frivolous and shallow; being frivolous and shallow, they are surely devoid of righteousness. Few among them would not draw the bow of Yi. The *Fu Ming* chapter states: *\"This Dao is most divine and sagely—do not let it leak or be lightly disclosed. It relies entirely on virtue and conduct, both in harmony. Speech must be guarded, and taboos observed. Know that the great Dao of the Golden Elixir may only be balanced with the worthy. If one is not such a person, not only should it not be spoken of, but they should even be kept at a distance.\"*\n\nAlas! From ancient times to the present, those who emerge into the world and transmit the Dao have all been heroes of the highest order, riding cranes and commanding mists and clouds—certainly not the foolish or clumsy. How could the unworthy ever comprehend it? From ancient times to the present, the Dao has been passed down through a single conversation, a single exchange of words. *\"He who attains the One accomplishes all things. How great is the One! It is the source of a thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses, the ancestor of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes.\"* Truly, there is no second Dao in the world, no second heart in the sage. And the myriad volumes of immortal scriptures all converge in their language: the Golden Elixir is this very root and origin.\n\nScholars, exert yourselves, hold these words in mind, and ponder deeply. These are the most essential teachings, laid bare and luminous, never deceiving us. Master Wei says: *\"If scholars repeatedly savor and contemplate this book, one day their minds will grasp and their spirits guard it. Then they will know that my most essential words are indeed laid bare and luminous, without a trace of deception or concealment.\"* Ah! Master Wei’s intent to guide later learners is most earnest. Should scholars not trust and receive his teachings, recite and uphold this book, and hold its words in mind with deep reflection?\n\n---\n\n**Upper Scroll of the *Elucidation of the Union of the Three in Accordance with the Book of Changes***\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite and embrace one another. How great is the breath of man! Zhang Hengqu’s *Zheng Meng* states: *\"Man’s possession of breath is the image of firmness and softness rubbing together, of Qian and Kun opening and closing.\"* What is breath? One exhalation, one inhalation. With each exhalation, the pulse moves twice, and qi travels three inches; with each inhalation, the pulse also moves twice, and qi travels three inches. In one complete cycle of breath, qi travels six inches. In the hundred divisions of a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, and qi travels eight hundred ten zhang, circulating up and down like an endless ring, its limits unfathomable.\n\nBefore a person is born, dwelling in the mother’s womb, they breathe as the mother breathes—without sight, without hearing, only a single breath remaining. At birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and the primal qi of true origin gathers below the navel. Day by day, the spirit departs and qi shifts, and one no longer guards the single breath of the womb. Now, the method of cultivation practiced by divine immortals is to turn the light inward, harmonizing breath with the Great Harmony. This is to return to the origin and revert to the source, restoring the state at the moment of receiving qi at birth.\n\nXu Jingyang’s *Drunken Thoughts on Becoming an Immortal* says: *\"Internally harmonize the true qi, preserve breath, and naturally transform to restore youthful countenance.\"* The *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* states: *\"A thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses expound on the subtle mysteries, but the root of life originally lies in the true breath.\"* All else is heterodox practice and reckless action, not the true and essential natural Dao.\n\nNow, Master Wei speaks of *\"the firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun uniting and embracing one another\"*—this refers to the moment of elixir-making, when the yang of Qian descends to unite with the yin of Kun, causing breath to intermingle, firmness and softness to correspond, and husband and wife to be paired as one. Then spirit and qi return to the root, nature and life unite, and the medicine gestates within. It is also called *\"the mating of Dragon and Tiger,\"* *\"the union of Metal and Wood,\"* *\"the coiling of the serpent and the dragon,\"* *\"the blending of red and black,\"* *\"the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\"* *\"the intermingling of the Mysterious Yellow,\"* *\"the fusion of Metal and Earth,\"* *\"the sharing of the crucible by Metal and Mercury,\"* *\"the sharing of the furnace by Metal and Fire,\"* *\"the union of red and white,\"* *\"the dwelling of the sun and moon in the same palace,\"* *\"the sharing of the den by crow and hare,\"* *\"the joyful union of husband and wife,\"* *\"the meeting of the Oxherd and Weaver Girl,\"* *\"the following of female and male,\"* *\"the merging of hun and po.\"* In the end, it is nothing more than the interdependence of heart and breath, the internal resonance of yin and yang, and the union of spirit and qi.\n\n*\"Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on one another.\"* *\"Yang bestows, yin receives\"* is like jade flowers blooming and dewdrops congealing, the blossoms gradually opening as the bud’s dew deepens. *\"Male and female depend on one another\"* is like the Jia Dragon and Geng Tiger guarding each other, lead and mercury sharing the same crucible—only then can it be achieved. The so-called *\"bestowing and receiving,\"* the so-called *\"depending on one another,\"* are but explanations of the mating.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate beings through the mating of yin and yang; the method of the elixir generates medicine through the mating of yin and yang. Truly, there has never been a creation of transformation that did not arise from mating. The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* states: *\"If the Mysterious Yellow does not mate, how can yang fly up from below Kan?\"* This is the great principle of elixir-making, the foremost doctrine of immortal cultivation.\n\nYuan Yangzi’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: *\"The vastness of the Mysterious Heaven pairs with the Yellow Earth; the two natures harmonize and enter the bridal chamber.\"* This is its meaning. The *Returning Gold* chapter states: *\"The former sages clearly revealed the cinnabar terrace, where the numinous crow perched on the cassia branch several times.\"* This is its meaning. The *Returning to the Origin* chapter states: *\"The Metal Mother of the West is most firm and strong, entering the watery abode of Ren.\"* This is its meaning. The *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet east and west; the Four Images unite in the center of Wu and Ji.\"* This is its meaning. Wang Liangqi’s *Awakened Understanding* chapter says: *\"Skillfully guide the hun to join the po, transforming yin entirely into pure yang.\"* This is its meaning. The *Fu Ming* chapter states: *\"To know the great Dao’s principle of the Inaudible and Invisible, the Great Yang shifts to illuminate within the moon.\"* This is its meaning.\n\nThe *Upholding the Orthodox* chapter states: *\"The two numinous substances naturally unite; this bit of divine mechanism is sought here.\"* This is its meaning. The *Upper Clarity Collection* says: *\"There is no other method—only that the divine water enters the Flower Pool.\"* This is its meaning.\n\nKnowing this, one may then produce the medicine and form the embryo. Further obtaining the fire-phase secret, refining it causes the celestial drum to rumble, shaking the earth as jade dust scatters like reed-ash, ascending into the Mud Pill. If one merely knows this but fails to grasp the fire-phase secret, it only warms the lower origin—this is not the Returning Elixir.\n\nAn ancient song says:\n*\"From red to black is true refinement;\nblack to red, the Celestial Immortal is complete.\"*\n\nThe elixir method differs in the Prenatal and Postnatal, the effortless and the effortful. In the Prenatal, spirit congeals and enters the Kun navel to produce the medicine; in the Postnatal, spirit shifts and enters the Qian crown to complete the elixir. The Prenatal is effortless, the Postnatal effortful—they cannot be treated as one.\n\nWhen the essence and qi of creation unfold,\nThe *Emerald Void* chapter states: *\"At every moment when heaven and earth unite, seize the mechanism of yin-yang transformation.\"* This mechanism is the moment when heaven and humanity jointly activate. The transformations within the human body correspond to those of heaven and earth. Now, to speak of *\"uniting with creation\"* is to discuss its utmost subtlety, which lies entirely in the celestial mechanism and the human mechanism being set forth together. If one can empty the heart and congeal the spirit, aligning with the mechanism of heaven and earth, then creation rests within one’s grasp.\n\nThe *Master Hidden by Heaven* says: *\"If within three hundred and sixty days one circulates one’s own qi to harmonize with the true qi of heaven and earth two or three times, one will naturally feel the body’s clarity and harmony, different from ordinary times. How much more so if practiced long and accumulated in profound accord—the Dao of immortals is not difficult to attain!\"*\n\nSome say: *\"Simply sit when one must sit—why distinguish rivers and sources, recognize times and days?\"* This is merely ignorance of creation; such a one is not worth debating.\n\nThe *Kan and Li* crown the head, their radiance spreading forth.\n*Kan and Li* are the sun and moon.\n\nThe alchemical method encompasses both inner and outer sun and moon. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *\"The sun emerges, the moon enters—breathing and visualization pertain to the inner sun and moon.\"* It further says: *\"The three luminaries shine brilliantly, entering your chamber,\"* which refers to the outer sun and moon. These two are mutually dependent and cannot exist without each other. The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Pointer to the Mystery* states: *\"When the outer [sun and moon] conjoin, the inner [sun and moon] also conjoin; the three passes become unobstructed without laborious effort.\"* At the moment of the elixir’s formation, the inner sun and moon unite, refining essence within, while the outer sun and moon merge their radiance without. When inner and outer converge and remain undispersed for long, then—dimly, faintly—something takes form within. Profoundly, obscurely, essence fills the void, and white snow scatters in disarray.\n\nThe sun and moon illuminate heaven and earth: the spiral shell and clam absorb them to generate pearls, and stubborn stones store them to transform into jade. How much more so for the human body, which possesses its own sun and moon—can it not reflect its own light to crystallize its true pearl and produce its true jade? The *Shangqing Collection* states: *\"The operations of heaven and earth largely revolve around Kan and Li. Why does the stone hold jade? Why is the pearl concealed in the clam’s belly? Through this, the celestial mechanism is revealed—truly, the Dao lies before one’s eyes.\"* Yet though the Dao lies before their eyes, scholars often fail to awaken, for the celestial mechanism is too near, and the blind repeatedly overlook it even when facing it directly.\n\nThe mysterious and unfathomable cannot be depicted in diagrams. The sages measured and arranged the primordial foundation. The *Red Dragon Great Elixir Formula* says: *\"There is a thing called the mysterious and unfathomable; the golden elixir arises from this.\"* Silent and vast, subtle and immeasurable—how could it be captured in diagrams? Since it cannot be depicted, it can only be known in the heart and grasped in the mind. Yet what lies within oneself may be known in the heart and grasped in the mind, but when teaching others, how can one not employ images and texts to silently convey its mechanism? Thus, the sages delved into the profound and sought the hidden to elucidate the ultimate mystery of the primordial. They employed broad analogies and layered metaphors to arrange the primordial foundation of the golden elixir—hence the proliferation of alchemical classics and the composition of the *Cantong Qi* in accord with the *Book of Changes*. The \"primordial foundation\" is the root.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\"* For subduing lead and restraining mercury depend entirely on the Mysterious Female; thus, the Mysterious Female is the root of the returned elixir. When a man establishes the Mysterious Female, his essence and qi are secured; when a woman establishes the Mysterious Female, her monthly courses cease. In cultivation, if one does not know this, from where will the medicinal materials arise? From where will the returned elixir coalesce? From where will the fire phases be applied? The four—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—merge directly into the formless.\n\nWhen merged into one, it is called \"primordial chaos.\" The *Mysterious Writ* states: *\"Sprouting, spreading, ceaselessly—principles of south and north, east and west naturally converge.\"* This is how Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li merge into one. Once merged into one, spirit and qi return to the root and directly enter the formless—profound, subtle, beyond comprehension.\n\nThe *Song of the Numinous Source and the Great Dao* says: *\"Mixed into one, then forgetting one—thus may one merge with the transformations of merit, emerging and vanishing together.\"* Yet what the alchemical tradition calls \"formless\" does not mean the absence of mind or thought, the stillness of withered wood or dead ashes. The *Wenzi’s* *Comprehending the Mysterious and Perfected Classic* states: *\"Seeing in the dark, hearing in silence—within the darkness, alone there is clarity; within stillness, alone there is illumination.\"* This is the ineffable subtlety.\n\nSome, failing to grasp this, mistake it for the Chan school’s quiescence—this is a grave error. If the golden elixir were identical to Chan study, one could simply engage in Chan meditation. Why undertake the manifold processes of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li? Why must one thoroughly understand yin-yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation before attaining mastery?\n\nThe sixty hexagrams are spread and arrayed as a chariot; the dragon-horse is harnessed, and the enlightened ruler drives—when times are harmonious, one follows the level path without deviation. Should the path turn crooked, danger and peril will topple the state.\n\nIn the alchemical method, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, while Kan and Li become the medicinal substances. The remaining sixty hexagrams, from *Zhun* and *Meng* through *Jiji* and *Weiji*, are arranged in cyclical sequence around the crucible to regulate the firing times of the celestial revolution. Thus it is said: *\"The sixty hexagrams are spread and arrayed as a chariot.\"* Once this chariot is spread and arrayed, all sixty hexagrams become instruments for our use, and the dragon-horse returns to our harness and guidance.\n\nThe *Shangqing Jade Perfection Embryonic Breathing Formula* states: *\"I take spirit as my chariot and qi as my horse, driving them all day without weariness.\"* Without weariness means *\"subtly continuous, as if present\"*—using them without strain. *\"Without strain\"* does not mean forgetting, nor does it mean rigidly holding on; it is a state of *\"as if present, as if absent,\"* never descending into forced labor or urgency.\n\nHow excellent were the words of Guangchengzi to the Yellow Emperor: *\"I preserve the One and abide in harmony; thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.\"* The body is like the state; the mind is like the ruler.\n\nWhen the mind settles, spirit congeals and qi harmonizes; the Three Palaces naturally ascend and descend, and the hundred meridians flow unimpeded. Those who diligently practice this will without exception attain transcendence. As Master Gushen states in his *Lucid Treatise*: *\"The Dao of cultivating the body takes utmost spirit as its root, utmost essence as its medicine, harmonious balance as its function, and non-action as its governance. Through non-action, spirit congeals; when spirit congeals, harmonious qi gathers; when harmonious qi gathers, roots deepen and foundations solidify; with deep roots and solid foundations, the Dao of long life and enduring vision is accomplished.\"* To depart from this is not the method of the Golden Elixir and Great Return.\n\nGenerally, the dwelling of qi and blood within the human body values undisturbed cultivation. The practice is most simple and easy: merely embrace the origin, guard the One, concentrate qi, and attain suppleness like an infant. Thus, in the moment of elixir formation, there is no other technique—only emptying the mind, stilling the self, and congealing spirit into the qi cavity, following its ebb and flow with unbroken continuity. Over time, spirit naturally congeals, breath naturally settles; when breath settles, qi gathers; when qi gathers, the elixir forms. There is no need for the labor of massage, daoyin, exhalation and inhalation, or visualization.\n\nThe *Internal Pointers to the Mysterious and Secret* states: *\"When the sun departs, depart with it; when the moon arrives, arrive with it—following its ingress and egress without leaving the Elixir Terrace.\"* From this perspective, the Great Elixir’s Dao relies solely on the singular flavor of primordial harmonious qi to accomplish its transformations; there is no other path.\n\nThe noble one dwells in his chamber, and when his words are good, they resonate a thousand *li* away—just as the lord of ten thousand chariots, secluded in his nine-fold chamber, issues commands that align with the rhythms of yin and yang. The ruler, enthroned in majesty and secluded in profound depths, speaks well, and his words echo a thousand *li* away. Likewise, the cultivator, embracing stillness and silence, turns inward to reflect; when emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its utmost, the qi of Heaven and Earth naturally comes to him. Why? Because this follows the natural principle that when one thing is stimulated, another responds.\n\nWhen issuing commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang, the sage kings of antiquity, in the first month of spring, would order their ministers to spread virtue and harmonize decrees; in the first month of autumn, they would command generals to train soldiers and sharpen weapons—all in accordance with the seasons and the rhythms of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. If this is how governance is conducted, how much more should the Dao of the Elixir be so?\n\n*\"Store the vessel and await the time; do not transgress the hexagram’s day.\"* The *Returning Gold Chapter* states: *\"Do not let the moment slip; remain always within the single yang.\"* In the method of elixir refinement, one must first know the time, and even more, await it. If the time has not yet come, one should only embrace stillness, silence, and emptiness to await it—never forcing it prematurely. As the *Three Medicines Song of Master Zhengyang* says: *\"Preserve the mind, cut off thoughts, and await the crystallization.\"* The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Mysterious* states: *\"Seal the senses, lower the gaze, and silently observe.\"* This is what is meant by *\"storing the vessel and awaiting the time.\"*\n\nAlas! When the hour arrives, without laboring the mind, the internal energies naturally intermingle, naturally coalesce, and congeal. Entering the chamber, one must await the moment when the yellow path of the sunwheel ascends of itself—how could one force it ahead?\n\nThe hexagram *Tun* employs *zi* and *shen*, while *Sui* employs *yin* and *xu*. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own day; here, I merely present two images without exhaustive detail. In *Tun*, below is *Zhen* and above is *Kan*. *Tun* employs *zi* and *shen*: the initial nine of *Zhen* is the *gengzi* line, and the six in the fourth place of *Kan* is the *wushen* line.\n\nBelow is *Kan* and above is *Gen*. *Sui* employs *yin* and *xu*: the initial six of *Kan* is the *wuyin* line, and the six in the fourth place of *Gen* is the *bingxu* line. Now, *zi* and *shen*, *yin* and *xu* are none other than *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire—the Serpent, the Dragon, and the Tiger. All are allegories.\n\nViewing the sixty hexagrams as a whole, they begin with *Tun* and end with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Between them, yin and yang lines intermingle and intertwine. Though each differs from the next, with their inverted and corresponding forms each finding its own resonance, in truth, hexagram after hexagram follows the same pattern. When Master Wei remarked, *\"I merely present two images without exhaustive detail,\"* he intended for the learner to contemplate the images of *Tun* and *Sui*, and from this initial insight extend it further, thereby intuitively grasping the meaning of the remaining hexagrams.\n\nEach hexagram has six lines; two hexagrams together comprise twelve lines, corresponding to the twelve hours of a day. The sixty hexagrams together comprise three hundred sixty lines, corresponding to the three hundred sixty hours of a month. Master Wei’s original intent was merely to use this framework to discuss the divisions, arrivals, openings, and closings of the fire-phase within our own bodies. For example, if applied to *Xu* and *Song*, one would say: *\"Xu* employs *zi* and *shen*, *Song* employs *yin* and *wu*.\" If applied to *Shi* and *Bi*, one would say: *\"Shi* employs *yin* and *chou*, *Bi* employs *wei* and *shen*.\" The other hexagrams follow this same pattern. Thus he said, *\"I merely present two images without exhaustive detail.\"*\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"The Southern and Northern Schools reverse the hexagrams’ images,\nMorning and evening fire-phases align with the Celestial Pivot.\"*\nThis, too, serves only to elucidate this same principle. If one clings rigidly to the text, mired in the images, and insists on calculating the numerical configurations of the hexagrams’ structures to match the yin and yang of their lines, I fear one will toil endlessly without ever achieving success—wearily laboring, yet never knowing where one is bound. How lamentable!\n\nIn principle, *\"establishing punishments where there is righteousness, bestowing virtue where there is benevolence.\"* The West represents righteousness, the East represents benevolence. Punishment governs killing and subjugation; virtue governs generation and ascent. Now, *\"establishing punishments where there is righteousness\"* refers to forging the lead of the West, while *\"bestowing virtue where there is benevolence\"* refers to refining the mercury of the East. Lead belongs to Metal; its nature is utterly unyielding. Concealed within *Kan*, it cannot ascend unless subjected to fierce firing and extreme forging. Thus, one employs martial fire to compel it, and must not apply civil fire. Mercury belongs to Wood; its nature is utterly yielding. Hidden within *Li*, upon encountering true lead, it naturally ceases movement. Thus, one employs civil fire to refine it, and must not apply martial fire.\n\nThe *Chongzheng Pian* states:\n*\"Defending the city requires the application of civil virtue,\nWhile waging war in the field demands the deployment of martial prowess.\nThese two modes of action must be clearly distinguished;\nProceeding in accord brings good fortune, while going against invites misfortune.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nAccording to the almanac, one must be utterly sincere, focused, and meticulous. The *Gaohongmeng Mengxian Yao* states:\n*\"Gathering has its time, harvesting has its day.\nGather, harvest—be ever vigilant and discreet.\"*\nThus, one must consult the almanac to know the oral instructions for the proper moment. Only with utter sincerity, absolute focus, and no trace of extraneous thought can the divine mushroom be plucked. Likewise, if one remains secluded for a year, from dawn to dusk inwardly circulating the numinous banner, one must maintain utter sincerity and absolute focus, undivided in purpose—only then can the elixir be completed and the body attain immortality. If one treats the Great Dao as child’s play, lightly and carelessly tampering with the celestial mechanism, practicing in the morning only to abandon it by evening, this is not true sincerity.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"Accumulating merit and refining the elixir do not occur naturally;\nThey arise from precision and sincerity, and from unwavering focus.\"*\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who have cultivated the elixir have never succeeded without sincerity, nor have they ever achieved their aim without wholehearted dedication.\n\nIn ancient times, Yi Qiu instructed two men in the game of *yi*. One devoted himself wholeheartedly, listening only to Yi Qiu’s teachings. The other, though he appeared to listen, was in fact preoccupied with the thought of a swan goose approaching, imagining himself readying his bow and arrow to shoot it. Though he studied alongside the first, he did not match his skill. Now, *yi* is but a minor art—without wholehearted dedication, one cannot master it. How much more so with the Dao?\n\nThe *Zuowang Lun* of Sima Ziwei states: \"Only in idleness and tranquility can one cultivate the Dao. For the study of the Dao must attain pure stillness and non-action, and not allow the slightest external matter to burden the mind. If one is inwardly entangled by family affairs or outwardly occupied by official duties, this too is a lack of wholehearted dedication to the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Dadao Ge* of Zhang Xujing declares:\n*\"The spirit guides qi, qi sustains the form—*\n*No need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.*\n*The art is easy, yet the Dao is hard to encounter;*\n*Even when encountered, without single-minded practice,*\n*Of a thousand or ten thousand who study, barely one or two succeed—*\n*This saying is indeed true.\"*\n\nScholars of today do not understand that immortality is achieved through accumulation. They merely wish to attain it through fleeting moments of playful effort, never considering that even a brief interval is part of the work of coalescing the elixir, while the year-long firing and nurturing—whether walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating—must remain unwavering, lest the fire cool and the elixir’s power wane. How could there be the slightest interruption?\n\nOne must carefully observe the celestial cycles and examine the waxing and waning of qi. The *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Heaven and earth wax and wane in their own time;*\n*Only by scrutinizing these changes can one grasp the mechanism.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The moon’s waxing and waning corresponds to the rise and fall of spirit;*\n*The sun’s rising and setting aligns with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.\"*\n\nFor within a month, there is the waxing and waning of a month; within a day, there is the waxing and waning of a day. The dark and new moons, the crescent and full moons—these are the waxing and waning of a month. Day and night, dawn and dusk—these are the waxing and waning of a day. The human body models itself on heaven and earth, and the waxing and waning of its qi and blood follow the same path as the transformations of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Suwen* says: \"At dawn, human qi begins to flourish; at noon, yang qi reaches its peak; by dusk, yang qi is depleted, and the qi gates close.\" It also says: \"When the moon first appears, blood and qi begin to refine, and defensive qi begins to circulate. When the moon is full, blood and qi are abundant, and the muscles are firm. When the moon is empty, the muscles diminish, the meridians are depleted, defensive qi departs, and only the form remains.\"\n\nThus, just as heaven and earth have day and night, dawn and dusk, so too does the human body. Just as heaven and earth have dark and new moons, crescents and full moons, so too does the human body. The shifting of cold and heat, the alternation of yin and yang—all correspond to heaven and earth. Therefore, in the elixir method, heaven serves as the crucible, earth as the furnace, and the moon as the agent of the medicine. The gathering of the medicine must follow the moon’s waxing and waning, while the firing process must align with the sun’s rising and setting. From beginning to end, there is not a single moment that does not harmonize with heaven and earth.\n\nAs the *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: *Yin* marks the opening of things, like the *Jingzhe* solar term when the yearly count begins; *Xu* marks the closing of things, like the *Lidong* solar term when the yearly count ends—are these not the firing times of the elixir method? The three hours of *Hai*, *Zi*, and *Chou* are when the sun sinks below the earth and disappears, when the count halts and does not proceed. Within this interval lies the moment when the first yang stirs, when the myriad things have yet to arise—this is how the sage perceives the heart of heaven and earth, and how one models oneself on heaven and earth to complete the myriad things, with creation at one’s command. Is this not the time for gathering the medicine in the elixir method?\n\nIn all matters—drawing and adding, circulating and bathing, joining and binding—one follows the transformations of heaven and earth. This is why it is called the supreme Dao. If one does not rely on the transformations of heaven and earth but seeks other methods, these are but side doors and minor arts, mere conjectures of the mind, not the supreme Dao.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* says: \"The clam’s pearl waxes and wanes with the moon,\" and \"When the moon is empty, the fish’s brain diminishes; when the moon dies, the snail’s flesh withers.\" Even such insignificant creatures correspond to the transformations of heaven and earth—how much more so for humans?\n\nFrom this, we see that when cultivating the elixir at the full moon, qi and blood are full, and the medicine’s power is complete. After the full moon, qi and blood diminish, and the medicine’s power wanes. Thus, the *Cuixu Pian* says: \"On the night of the full moon, one can gather the celestial hun and earthly po to congeal the numinous elixir,\" and also: \"The union of the two eights is the mother of the elixir; seeking the tiger and dragon beyond the full moon is but vain labor.\"\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* further states:\n*\"On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, when the toad’s radiance shines,*\n*It is precisely when metal essence is at its peak.*\n*When the first yang arises at *Fu*, then one may advance the fire—*\n*Do not delay!\"*\n\nThe *Chongzheng Pian* says:\n*\"The metal of *Dui* holds myriad treasures, completing in the west;*\n*At the osmanthus moon’s mid-autumn, its brightness doubles.*\n*This is the time to refine the head and apply the work of gathering—*\n*Wait not for the yang to arise!\"*\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* declares:\n*\"Just at this moment, wondrous and rare,*\n*When the moon in the sky is full at mid-autumn,*\n*Swiftly gather the yang—do not let it linger!*\n*Advance the fire with care, lest danger arise.\"*\n\nThe reference to the eighth month’s fifteenth day, when metal essence is at its peak, does not mean that only on this day can one gather the medicine. Rather, works like *Baizi Qing* and *Liao Chanhui* all specify entering the chamber at the *Zi* hour on the night of the eighth month’s fifteenth. For at this time, yin and yang are in perfect balance, the autumn air is crisp, metal essence is at its height, neither cold nor warm—most suitable for cultivation. The ancient immortals formed the embryo at this time, stealing the metal essence of heaven and earth and drawing in the pure qi of heaven and earth.\n\nSome, failing to receive the true transmission, know not the essence of the matter. They merely absorb the moonlight on the night of the eighth month’s fifteenth—this is like dangling a net to catch the wind or grasping a rope to bind a shadow. How can such a thing be spoken of as the supreme Dao?\n\nMoreover, there is another account. Master Wen Yuan of Chao recorded that during the Tang dynasty, the recluse of Mount Zhongyue, Qizhenzi Shi Jianwu, composed the *Lingxiang Ci*. In its preface, he writes: \"Upon casually perusing the *Three Classics of Stillness*, I read that those who cultivate the Dao must enter the Three Stillnesses to refine spirit and qi, thereby extending life. The Great Stillness lasts three hundred days, the Middle Stillness two hundred, and the Lesser Stillness one hundred.\" Moved by utmost sincerity, he resolved to attempt the Lesser Stillness. Thus, in the third year of the Kaicheng reign (the *wuwu* year), beginning on the first day of the first month (*gengshen*), he shut his door, severed all worldly ties, and adhered strictly to the hundred-day term. Upon emerging from his chamber before the month had passed, his spirit-light shone before his eyes, a hundred spirits gathered at his ears, and his essence and vitality were unclouded—all three responses confirmed that the immortal classics and secret scriptures were not empty teachings.\n\nNow, in the cultivation of the Great Elixir, one must proceed likewise. For only with prolonged stillness do spirit become clear and qi harmonized, the inner vessel perfected—only then can refinement begin. To remain mired in worldly entanglements, exhausting sinew and bone, taxing heart and mind, yet expect to succeed in a single attempt on the fifteenth of the eighth month is most arduous indeed.\n\nIf the slightest mote is amiss, regret and misfortune become thieves. The solstices shift their degrees, the equinoxes deviate east and west, midwinter transforms into scorching summer, midsummer reverses into hail and snow. Lead and mercury scatter, myriad anomalies erupt—all because the fire and timing are awry. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Though one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire’s timing, it is as idle as a vast city. Cultivation depends entirely on this power; even a hair’s divergence fails to produce the Elixir.\"\n\nThe so-called *fire* is not the imagined flame between heart and kidney, but the body’s innate true fire. The so-called *timing* is not the measured moments of the clock, but the body’s natural qi rhythms. Fire’s nature flares with wind and hides with earth; its use must neither exceed nor fall short. One must gently fan it with *xun*-wind, fiercely conceal it with *kun*-earth, ensuring moderation without excess or deficiency. Then, great and small remain unharmed, both realms preserved, and in an instant, the Elixir’s head appears. This is what is meant by \"adjusting and applying.\"\n\nIf even a hair’s breadth errs, the solstices shift, the equinoxes stray, midwinter becomes scorching summer, midsummer turns to hail, lead and mercury flee, and anomalies proliferate.\n\nThe filial adept’s intent moves the August Ultimate. As the *Fuming Pian* says: \"One man and one woman draw upon heaven and earth; three daughters and three sons unite beginning and end.\" For Qian begets three sons, Kun bears three daughters—together called the Six Children. Now, Qian as father and Kun as mother occupy above and below, while the Six Children move between them, ascending and descending, ever following their parents—hence the name \"filial child.\" The August Ultimate is the central, correct position, the convergence of the eight directions. When the filial adept’s intent moves it, tigers roar, dragons emerge from their caves, phoenixes dance, and the Elixir enters the golden city.\n\nBut if one’s actions are rebellious and discordant with the Ultimate, the dark pearl scatters, the numinous mercury flees, and the Six Children become not filial heirs but rebels against the Elixir Way.\n\nThus may one invite misfortune or summon blessing, bring about peace or incite war—these four outcomes arise from the heart’s resolve. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Fire is born of wood, yet its edge is hidden; without skillful drilling, do not force it. Disaster springs from this—harming oneself. One must master and subdue it, seeking the Metal Elder. With the medicine present and the fire’s timing applied, metal is pressed by fire, surging to the Li Palace, transforming into water, which in turn restrains fire—thus fire avoids the peril of flaring upward. Without the medicine, the fire’s timing drives empty yang to attack, precisely what burns the body. Herein lies the division between inviting misfortune and summoning blessing.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"Sun and moon meet once every thirty days; timing is easily changed. The method lies in divine skill—guarding the city, waging wild battles, knowing defense, and increasing fortune. When the numinous cinnabar fills the vessel, crimson, true lead arises from the Kan Palace, turbid and unmoving. To capture and restrain the true mercury of the Li Palace, one must use martial fire, fiercely refining and forging until it soars upward. Upon reaching the Li Palace and uniting with true mercury, one must then guard the city and bathe—no further fire may be added. Herein lies the vast difference between peace and war.\"\n\nWhether one invites misfortune or summons blessing, brings peace or incites war—how could this arise from anything other than the heart’s reflection? It is simply a matter of turning inward.\n\nThe movement and stillness follow constant principles, adhering to their guiding line. When utterly still, one returns to the root and recovers tranquility—this is the time of Kun. I then wait in stillness; when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and yang qi subtly germinates in the Yellow Bell Palace—this is the time of Fu. I then move in response. Thus it is said: \"Movement and stillness follow constant principles, adhering to their guiding line.\" If, when one should move, stillness is mixed in, or when one should be still, movement is interposed; if one forces growth prematurely or neglects it afterward—this is not adhering to the guiding line.\n\nThe perfected ones of antiquity moved in accord with the heavens and were still as the abyss. When it was time to move, they moved; when it was time to be still, they were still—there was always a constant method. Today’s scholars, unaware that the alchemical method’s movement and stillness follow constant principles, either cling solely to movement or solely to stillness. What they call \"movement\" is merely the movement of circulating qi; what they call \"stillness\" is merely the stillness of dhyāna-samādhi—both miss the mark entirely.\n\nDoes not Chapter 39 of the *Zhixuan* state: \"Every person’s qi and blood naturally flow, nourishing and defending, with yin and yang cycling through the hundred moments—how could this depend on shutting the door to practice circulating qi? It is like placing another head atop one’s own.\" When has circulating qi ever been considered true movement? Does not the *Cui Xu Pian* state: \"Only this Qian and Kun truly operate—there is no need to sit rigidly, speechless, thoughtless, and mindless, for the spirit will only grow dull. How could one then congeal it into an immortal embryo?\" How could dhyāna-samādhi ever be considered true stillness?\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* says: \"Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness.\" The *Cui Xu* states: \"Within movement, seek stillness; within stillness, there is action.\" Movement and stillness have their proper roles—how could those who merely parrot transmitted teachings presume to lightly discuss them?\n\n**Harmonizing with the seasons and aligning with qi**\nThe four seasons are the spring, summer, autumn, and winter within the body. When practicing inner work, one must skillfully regulate and harmonize with their proper times, so that warmth, coolness, cold, and heat each find their place. Lü Chunyang’s poem says: \"When water and fire are balanced, the medicine is formed; if yin and yang are mismatched, the elixir fails.\" All success lies in this regulation.\n\n**Firmness and softness are distinct, not intermingling**\nFirmness is yang; softness is yin. \"Firmness and softness are distinct, not intermingling\" means that when yang’s firmness is at work, the intent is wholly directed downward—it must not encroach upon the upper. When yin’s softness is at work, the intent is wholly directed upward—it must not encroach upon the lower. As Zhang Ziyang’s *Shiqiao Ge* says: \"Water generates fire, fire generates water—water and fire must be ordered in sequence.\" This is what is meant.\n\n**The Five Phases guard their boundaries, not recklessly expanding or contracting**\nThe *Wang Liangqi Tiantong Jing Song* states: \"Metal, wood, earth, water, and fire—all five guard the single cinnabar field. Who says one may succeed without such guarding?\" For when these five are dispersed, they become qi circulating throughout the body; when gathered, they form the treasure in the cinnabar field. Now, if they are steadfastly and single-mindedly guarded in the cinnabar field without reckless expansion or contraction, they will blend and fuse, transforming into a single qi that congeals into golden liquid.\n\n\"Expansion\" refers to excess; \"contraction\" refers to insufficiency. The *Cui Xu Pian* says: \"The numinous mercury, connected to the true, undergoes many transformations—it is only fitting to preserve and guard it, not to overdo it. For excess harms the thing, while insufficiency fails to generate it. One should only maintain it ceaselessly, as if present, guarding it with intent.\" With prolonged guarding, when the time arrives and qi transforms, the vessel will be full and must overflow—then the numinous spirits will naturally come.\n\n**The Yi flows ceaselessly, bending and extending, turning and returning**\nThe *Yi* is the sun and moon.\n\nThe sun and moon traverse the ecliptic, circulating ceaselessly day and night. In the first half of the month, yang expands while yin contracts, the *hun* grows and the *po* wanes; in the latter half, yin expands while yang contracts, the *hun* wanes and the *po* grows. This cycle repeats endlessly, without cessation.\n\nThe human body, with the head as *qian* and the abdomen as *kun*, resembles heaven and earth. Its two qi ascend and descend just as in heaven and earth. The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"The sun and moon constantly traverse the ecliptic and the celestial equator. All immortals who cultivate this method to refine the returning elixir do so in a way no different from heaven and earth.\" Yet the key to emulating the sun and moon’s movements and achieving the same efficacy as heaven and earth lies in the *Ren* and *Du* meridians.\n\nThe *Ren* and *Du* meridians are the seas of yin and yang for the entire body, the pivot for the five qi and true origin. The *Ren* meridian begins below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic region, follows the inner abdomen up to *Guanyuan*, reaches the throat, and is the sea of yin meridians. The *Du* meridian begins at the *Xiaji* point, runs alongside the spine up to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, ascends to the crown, follows the forehead to the bridge of the nose, and is the sea of yang meridians.\n\nThe *Ren* meridian is so named because women rely on it for conception and nourishment. The *Du* meridian is so called because it oversees and governs the sea of meridians. Deer live long, reaching five hundred years as white deer and a thousand as blue deer, for they can unblock their *Du* meridian. Creatures like cranes, toads, and toads all live a thousand years, for they can unblock their *Ren* meridian.\n\nThe *Nanhua Zhenjing* states: \"Follow the *Du* as your guiding principle, and you can preserve the body and safeguard life.\" If one can unblock these two meridians, all meridians will flow freely, naturally circulating throughout the body without stagnation or blockage—this is the way to attain longevity. The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* says: \"If the water of the method can ascend to the mysterious pass, one may wander freely day and night, ceaselessly revolving the wheel within. Stagnation gives rise to all illnesses; unblocked flow preserves youth—is this not the meaning?\"\n\nAs the poem by Langranzi says:\n*\"Ascend the current straight to the Mud Pill Palace,\nUnblocked joints and passages preserve youth.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Constantly let qi surge through the joints,\nNaturally essence fills and the Valley Spirit abides—\nAre these mere empty words?\"*\n\nChen Tuan regarded it as transforming the foul and turbid qi, while Han Xiaoyao saw it as turning the wheel without pause, achieving harmony with the mysterious within a month. If there is action, it is yet no action; if there is stillness, it is yet not stillness. From the secret transmissions of the Supreme Primordial Lord down through the generations to the present, apart from this Way, there is no other. Some call it \"the center of the circle,\" others \"the celestial revolution\"—this is the true path of the body’s ascent and descent, yin and yang’s circulation.\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: *\"The Valley Spirit does not die; it is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Ceaselessly it seems to endure; in its use, it is inexhaustible.\"*\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says: *\"Three returns in a day and night yield ten thousandfold.\"*\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: *\"All lies within the heart, revolving the celestial scripture; day and night preserve it, and you will naturally attain long life.\"*\nThe *Duren Jing* says: *\"Revolve the Dipper, traverse the Winnowing Basket, measure the Five Constants.\"*\nThe *Tiantong Jing* says: *\"The Three Palaces ascend and descend, circulating endlessly.\"*\nThe *Shangqing Yuzhen Taixi Jue* says: *\"From the Mud Pill Palace above to the Gate of Life below, the Two Radiant Ones follow each other, reviving the aged and infirm.\"*\nLiu Xugu’s *Yi Zhuan* says: *\"Dwell the spirit in the upper mystery, gather qi in the lower female; revolve and circulate without end.\"*\nBai Ziqing’s *Donglou Fayu* says: *\"From the Celestial Valley above to the yin extremity below, the Two Radiant Ones meet and merge into one.\"*\nCui Gong’s *Ruyao Jing* says: *\"Return to the root’s aperture, the Gate of Life’s pass; thread the tailbone, penetrate the Mud Pill Palace.\"*\nXu Jingyang’s *Sanyao Ge* says: *\"The Three Fields revolve within, flowing ceaselessly; when black hair and dark eyes return, it is the time.\"*\nWu Zongxuan’s *Xuexian Ge* says: *\"Kan and Li reverse, overturning heaven and earth; sun and moon both revolve.\"*\nThe *Zhixuan Pian* says: *\"A single horse follows heaven’s transformations; six dragons drive the sun’s endless cycle.\"*\nLü Chunyang’s poem says:\n*\"If one wishes to learn long life,\nFirst let the pivot revolve day and night.\"*\nHis *Jingzhong Yin* says:\n*\"Ride the axle to ascend the celestial pole,\nDay and night like a turning wheel.\"*\nThe *Huánjīn Piān* says: *\"Silently revolve qian and kun into one great harmony; let sun and moon flow on either side.\"*\nThe *Yuzhi Shu* says: *\"Eastward turn, westward flow—none can fathom it; earth ascends, heaven descends—who can know?\"*\nThe *Lingyuan Dadao Ge* says: *\"Harmonizing within, one becomes true; exhaling and inhaling without—this is never complete.\"*\nZhang Hongmeng’s *Huanyuan Pian* says: *\"In the twelve hours, let midnight lead; ceaselessly revolve and refine without pause.\"*\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says: *\"The wondrous workings of the Five Agents rely on qian and kun; qian and kun revolve, and the Five Agents divide.\"*\nThe *Fuming Pian* says: *\"Patrol the twelve positions, the barefoot fierce general.\"*\nLiu Gaoshang’s *Fayu* says: *\"Spirit preserves the generative qi; qi, not from mouth or nose, descends as yin, ascends as yang, flowing in harmony with heaven and earth.\"*\nLiu Xugu’s *Huandan Pian* says: *\"Descend and ascend, revolve the hub; left turn, right cover, align the pivot.\"*\nThe *Chongzheng Pian* says: *\"Revolving with skill, day and night unbroken; the subtle turning of the celestial sphere.\"*\nThe *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: *\"Self-strengthening without cease, in harmony with qian’s movement; within a six-foot body, embrace the nine heavens.\"*\nThe *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"By day, revolve the numinous banner; by night, draw forth the fiery mushroom. In refinement and augmentation, be ever vigilant.\"*\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* says: *\"Who can grasp the great meaning of this work? It lies with the Yellow Dame.\"*\nThe *Shangqing Ji* says: *\"Day and night, the river chariot never pauses; silently harmonizing with the great creation, it revolves in unison.\"*\nThe *Quanzhen Ji* says: *\"Qi and blood circulate without leakage.\"*\nThe *Jianwu Ji* says: *\"Revolve the sun and moon’s wheel.\"*\nThe *Shuiyun Ji* says: *\"Constantly till the field of clarity; in the three stages of fixed guarding, dwell in non-action’s abode.\"*\nLiu Changsheng’s *Xianyao Ji* says: *\"In stillness, movement, sitting, and lying, revolve Kan to welcome Li.\"*\nThe *Mingdao Ji* says: *\"At ease and self-content, the Way of long life—day and night, silently turn the Dharma wheel.\"*\nWang Yuyang’s *Guang Ji* says: *\"Revolve the inner elixir with fire timing; carry the sun and moon, driving the jade wheel.\"*\nThe *Taigu Ji* says: *\"Know the celestial revolution’s degrees, and the joints’ steaming and fuming will flow everywhere.\"*\n\nAll these refer to this same Way. Some call it \"somersaulting,\" others \"turning the mind-wheel.\" One says: \"Model heaven’s pivot, and immortality spans ten thousand eons.\" Another says: \"Harmonizing within preserves long life.\" A thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses, without exception, concur—citing the ancient to verify the present, their agreement is as precise as tallying tokens.\n\nThis is neither mere qi circulation, nor visualization, nor the \"flying golden essence behind the elbow,\" nor the \"revolving of the mind through the spine.\" It is simply the Way of preserving the great harmony through breath, guarding the natural and true essentials.\n\nAlas, how is it that scholars of this world ever delight in difficulty yet disdain simplicity, seek the distant yet neglect the near? Though there be those who possess the Way and wish to reveal it, who would believe them? The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"The world takes no joy in the true Dharma, preferring instead to discourse on what lies east or west.\" Unless one thoroughly comprehends the workings of yin and yang and sees through the transformations of creation, none will trust this.\n\nWithin the span of a single dark-and-dawn—*that is, the thirty and a half days before midnight*—in the alchemical arts, when time replaces days, the juncture of *hai* and *zi* each day is precisely this dark-and-dawn. At this moment, heaven and earth first opened; at this moment, sun and moon conjoin; at this moment, grasses and trees germinate; at this moment, the yin and yang of the human body unite. When immortals undertake the elixir at this time, inner truth and outer resonance align as perfectly as tallying tokens—neither too soon nor too late, but precisely at the center. Among the four virtues of the *Book of Changes*, this is the interval between *zhen* and *yuan*; among the twelve hexagrams, it is the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*—the most wondrous point for heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nChaos and the primordial vastness—this is the time before the division of the one qi. The union of female and male—this is when yin and yang mingle within it, not yet parted. When they have not yet parted, spirit congeals and qi gathers, blending into oneness. Within, one is unaware of one’s own body; without, one knows not the cosmos. With the Dao, one merges in darkness; ten thousand thoughts all vanish. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—perforce called the Great One containing true qi, or the primordial unity of precelestial qi. The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"The great medicine must rely on spirit, qi, and essence, gathering them in one place to form the cinnabar head. It is simply the precelestial qi refined into yellow sprouts, blooming as jade flowers.\" For the immortals’ cultivation, there is no other method but to gather the precelestial unity of qi as the mother of the golden elixir. Practice diligently, and in days you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"Gather the qi of the undivided Two Modes, seize the essence of the first mating of dragon and tiger. Flash into the yellow chamber and forge it into the supreme treasure.\" And again: \"Gathering requires utmost sincerity; discern the ugly and the fair. It is most difficult to grasp the subtle thread, easy to lose. The cold spring fears only that scholars cling to effortful doing, failing to comprehend the precelestial of the great Dao, mired in gathering yet unable to find its pulse.\" The *Chongzheng Pian* says: \"In the ten-thousand-fathom icy abyss, beneath the sleeping dragon’s chin, the pearl glows red. Guard it closely, disturb it not, and only then may you gather it. Follow the hours and days, rely on spiritual work.\" For gathering is gathering without gathering; taking is taking without taking. In the midst of stillness and stability, there is nothing to be done through action.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor lost his mysterious pearl and sent Knowledge to seek it; sent Li Zhu to seek it; sent Chi Gou to seek it—none found it. Only Xiangwang obtained it. Xiangwang means \"formless and traceless.\" Only when form is absent and traces vanish can the precelestial unity of qi be attained. The *Jirang Ji*’s *Xiantian Yin* says: \"A piece of the precelestial is called the Great Void. When nothing is done, the true richness appears.\" And again: \"If you ask about the precelestial, there is not a single word. Only after the postcelestial must one apply effort.\" This is indeed so. Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, before yin and yang parted—this is the precelestial of heaven and earth. In terms of the elixir arts, it is the time of utter stillness, returning to the root and reverting to tranquility. The *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: \"Utterly still, unmoving, yet responsive when stirred—one glimpses the workings of yin and yang. Truly, when utterly still and unmoving, the heart communes with heaven, and the transformations of creation may be seized.\" The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Seek not the transformations of creation within the kidneys; rather, seek the precelestial within the heart.\" This is most profoundly and clearly expressed. The *Jirang Ji*’s *Silü Yin* says: \"Before thoughts arise, the spirit of the mysterious female is unknown.\" The *Huánjīn Pian* says: \"Where the spirit of the mysterious female is unseen, dragon and tiger quietly seek each other.\" The great Way of the precelestial must be attained through utmost emptiness and profound stillness—no trace of thought may intrude.\n\nAt the moment of utter stillness and unmoving, when ten thousand thoughts are extinguished, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their mists, sun and moon pause their radiance, the jade pivot ceases turning, the eight vessels return to the source, and breath itself vanishes. One sinks deeply into the profound and obscure, utterly unaware of heaven as canopy or earth as chariot, nor of the world’s people or one’s own body. After a little while, the three palaces fill with qi, the mechanism stirs, and the mysterious female sings. With a single sword, one cleaves open chaos; with two hands, one rips apart the primordial vastness—this is called \"nothing giving birth to being.\" The poem of Master Ningxuan says: \"Not in the dust of toil, not in the mountains—one must seek precisely the profound and obscure.\" Is this not true?\n\nNowadays, people know not the ancestor of the great Dao. Some point to true lead as the precelestial; some to the \"heavenly one generating water\" as the precelestial; some to the single gleam between the two kidneys as the precelestial; some to the navel as the precelestial; some to the ancestral breath of the nose as the precelestial; some to the movement of qi as the precelestial. These are all fragmentary views, plucking branches and leaves—they are not the precelestial of the great Dao. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Precelestial, yet heaven does not oppose it; postcelestial, yet one follows heaven’s timing.\" \"Precelestial, yet heaven does not oppose it\"—this is the pure spontaneity of heavenly principle, which even heaven cannot contravene. \"Postcelestial, yet one follows heaven’s timing\"—when the time of heaven arrives, one should comply with it. Who but the most profoundly penetrating could partake of this?\n\nMoistening fluids and nourishing essences flow and circulate, transforming and communicating. The *Huandan Pian* says: \"For ten thousand miles, yin settles as spring’s qi conjoins; through nine skies, clarity pervades as dew’s essence congeals.\" Ah! This is the true scene of yin and yang’s mutual arousal—precisely at this time. Spirit and essence extend in all four directions, flowing without limit. Above, they reach heaven; below, they coil upon the earth. Dimly, like mountain mist; hazily, like water’s vapor; gently, like winter snow gradually congealing; deeply, like fermented liquid slowly clearing—this is the intertwining of heaven and earth within the body, the union of male and female within the body. When the time arrives and qi transforms, stirred into communication, suddenly the fire-wheel scorches the earth’s veins, startlingly the divine spring gushes from the mountain’s peak. Between heaven and earth, all is moistened and greatly enriched.\n\nThe *Jirang Ji*’s *Huanghu Yin* says: \"In the indistinct, yin and yang first transform; in the intertwining, heaven and earth first revolve. Within, a little good scenery—how can effort enter words?\" Unless one personally attains true realization, who would believe in such a real scene?\n\nThe spirits of heaven and earth are beyond measure; when yin and yang intersect, the divine and demonic conceal themselves—this is the moment of heaven and earth’s spiritual power. When dragon and tiger intertwine, the *gui*-spirits remain unaware—this is the moment of our body’s spiritual power. Uniting the body’s spiritual power with that of heaven and earth, the inner truth externally responds: within stillness, the *xun*-gate suddenly opens, and both sides ascend in unison, merging as one.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* states: \"Only in the formless and imageless realm lies the root of eternal life without death.\" Truly, only by forgetting form and image can one witness it. If it could be attained through deliberate contemplation, calculation, or measurement, it would no longer be called spiritual power.\n\n**Utilizing and Concealing the Body, Hiding the Form**\nAt the new moon, sun and moon conjoin in the north, their radiance hidden from sight. In the elixir method, the time is shifted to midnight, at the cusp of *kun* and *fu*. Cross-legged and seated like an unmoving mountain, mouth sealed and breath stilled like a hibernating winter serpent—this is \"utilizing and concealing the body, hiding the form.\" At this moment, containing light in silence, one inwardly reflects. With each exhalation and inhalation, long and unbroken, the qi meanders back to the life-root. Over time, one feels profound and guarded, as if standing at the edge of an unfathomable abyss. This is the time when spirit and qi return to their root, body and mind revert to their mandate, and golden liquid coagulates.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* says: \"When qi enters the cinnabar field to nourish the white crow, only then is it called the sprouting of the yellow sprout.\" If the mind-monkey is restless and the intent-horse gallops outward, spirit and qi scatter externally—how could one hope to congeal the returning elixir?\n\n**The Fire Phases and Lunar Cycles**\nIt begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then turns rightward. The wheel of fire disgorges its bud, and the hidden pool reveals its image; radiant essence scatters above *Mao* and *Bi*. *Zhen* emerges as the first yang, the inception of yang qi. In the *Qian* hexagram, the *ninth-one* is the \"hidden dragon,\" for yang is established by three and yin by eight, thus communication occurs. On the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. The *ninth-two* is the \"visible dragon,\" harmonious and luminous; the virtues of three and five are complete, and the *Qian* body is formed. The *ninth-three* is \"vigilant at dusk,\" its divine tally waxing and waning, gradually returning to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly governing and sustaining. The *ninth-four* is \"perhaps leaping,\" its path perilous; *Gen* controls advance and retreat, not overstepping its time. On the twenty-third day, it guards the *xiaxu* period. The *ninth-five* is the \"flying dragon in the heavens,\" exalted and joyous; the *sixth-five* of *Kun* receives and binds, completing the cycle, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. The *ninth-six* is the \"exhausted dragon,\" its virtue contending in the wilds.\n\nThe northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, is where the fire phase begins. Above *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the first yang—*Zhen* is also the trigram where the fire phase commences. The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"There is a path where mother and child part ways; its wonder lies in *Wei*, *Ji*, *Niu*, *Dou*, and *Nü*.\" This is what it refers to.\n\nThis chapter cites the six precelestial trigrams and the six lines of *Qian* to symbolize the waxing and waning of the moon, interspersed with the twenty-eight lunar lodges where the moon resides—all are metaphors. If scholars lack the oral transmission and rashly read this, few will avoid bewilderment of both mind and eye.\n\nThe fire phases of elixir refinement are no different from the moon’s waxing and waning. On the third day, the moon begins to brighten, starting in the northeast at *Ji* and *Dou*, then turning rightward until evening, when the wheel disgorges its bud above *Mao* and *Bi* in the southwest. Its image resembles *Zhen*; in terms of the *Qian* hexagram, it corresponds to the *ninth-one*—this metaphorically describes the initial stirring of yang fire in the body. On the eighth day, the moon ascends to *shangxu*, its light half-bright; its image resembles *Dui*, corresponding to the *ninth-two* of *Qian*—this metaphorically describes the halfway point of yang fire’s work in the body. On the fifteenth day, the moon is full, its spirit abundant and light complete; its image resembles *Qian*, corresponding to the *ninth-three*—this metaphorically describes the time of yang fire’s fulfillment in the body. On the sixteenth day, the full moon wanes, and the lunar essence begins; its image resembles *Xun*, corresponding to the *ninth-four*—this metaphorically describes the beginning of yin tally’s succession in the body. On the twenty-third day, the moon descends to *xiaxu*, its light half-diminished; its image resembles *Gen*, corresponding to the *ninth-five*—this metaphorically describes the halfway point of yin tally’s work in the body. On the twenty-fifth to thirtieth days, the moon’s light vanishes; its image resembles *Kun*, corresponding to the *ninth-six*—this metaphorically describes the time of yin tally’s completion in the body.\n\nWhy does Master Wei use the six trigrams to illustrate the fire phases and pair them with the six lines of *Qian*? Because the elixir is the treasure of pure yang, and *Qian* is the hexagram of pure yang. Yet among the six trigrams, *Qian* is called the *ninth-three*, \"vigilant at dusk, its divine tally waning,\" and *Kun* is called the *ninth-six*, \"the exhausted dragon contending in the wilds\"—why is this? Because guarding the city with *Qian* employs civility, while battling in the wilds with *Kun* employs martiality; both require vigilance against danger and caution against peril.\n\n**The Use of Nine**\n\"Using nine, gracefully it becomes the Dao’s compass and square.\" When the yang numbers are exhausted, they begin anew, cycling in accord with nature and aligning with inherent virtue. Revolving and abiding by the celestial pivot, ascending and descending, flowing through the six lines—difficult to perceive, thus it has no fixed position, becoming the ancestral origin of the *Yi*.\n\nNine is the yang number. The *Yi* states: \"Three for heaven, two for earth, relying on these numbers.\" It draws from the generative numbers of the five phases: heaven-one, heaven-three, heaven-five—three heavens rely on one another to form nine; earth-two, earth-four—two earths rely on one another to form six. This is why *Kun* uses six and *Qian* uses nine.\n\nIn the elixir method, \"using nine\" refers to the nine revolutions of the fire phase within a single period, modeled after *Qian*. \"Using nine, gracefully it becomes the Dao’s compass and square; when the yang numbers are exhausted, they begin anew\"—each line passes, and another arrives, without the slightest deviation. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"Within the numbers, nothing is lost; the fire phases must not lag.\" This is what it refers to.\n\n**Emotion and Nature**\nEmotion is metal; nature is wood.\n\nWithin one thing, division creates two—separated as east and west. Yet if one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle and sets it in motion, then wood-nature loves metal, and metal-emotion yearns for wood, no longer divided. Thus it is said: \"Push emotion to unite with nature, revolving together in accord with the turning jade pivot—ascending and descending, rising and falling.\"\n\nThe ceaseless flow through the six lines is difficult to observe, hence \"without fixed position\" becomes the ancestral principle of the *Yi*. This flow permeates the body: heaven hides within it, and earth hides within it—like the six lines’ ceaseless transformation. The \"six lines\" refer to the six lines of the *Qian* hexagram. Extend this principle, and it expands into six hexagrams, sixty hexagrams—its meaning remains one.\n\nThe *Huánjīn Piān* says: \"At nine revolutions, the mysterious mechanism reaches its apex; open the furnace, release the fire, and the lid flies off.\" This refers to the nine revolutions of the fire phase, beginning at *yín* and ending at *xū*—the secret of the fire timing within the furnace. Within it lie the wonders of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, the subtleties of bathing and conjoining. Thus it is called the ultimate mystery.\n\nIf one does not know this, even with true medicine in hand, how can the elixir be formed? This is why Master Wei dared not lightly disclose it, merely borrowing the *Qian* hexagram’s \"using nine\" to hint at its mechanism. From this perspective, the immortals’ returning elixir is the *Yi* within the body; the nine revolutions of the fire phase are the *Qian* within the body. Yet the *Qian* within the body has no visible lines, no observable images or numbers—welcomed, its beginning is unseen; followed, its end is unseen. How then could it have a form to observe?\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fù* arrives: yang qi begins to flow, entering and exiting without haste. Erect a marker—subtle and firm. When the Yellow Bell aligns with *zǐ*, signs emerge, spreading warmth and gentle steam, attaining constancy. *Fù* is the hexagram of one yang. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Yellow Bell; in a day, it is midnight (*zǐ*); in a month, the first to the third day’s half; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *zǐ*. At this time, yang qi first flows, like the initial stirring of yang fire within the body. The fire qi is most subtle—neither indulgent nor restrained, neither hasty nor sluggish—allowing gentle warmth to spread within the crucible.\n\nThe *Chóngzhèng Piān* says: \"The Yellow Bell is *zǐ*, the first arising of yang, the initial reception of qi. The number has not yet increased; the fire should be warm, not scorching. One fears the dragon’s weakness and the tiger’s overbearing might.\" In the first line’s movement, yang first flows—one can only raise it lightly, silently, not yet applying force. Thus it is said: \"Entering and exiting without haste.\" Yet it must not be too soft; one must stir the crown gate’s mechanism, gently lifting it. Thus it is said: \"Erect a marker—subtle and firm.\" Soon, the fire’s power blazes, driving out true lead to the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper. Then the river chariot dares not linger, halting its movement to ascend Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe *Jīndān Dàchéng Jí* says:\n*The Fù hexagram rises with the hidden dragon; at wù-sì, adjust slightly, do not attack.\nAt nine-two, the dragon appears in the Lín hexagram, mastering spiritual penetration.\nFrom here, the furnace’s order reddens step by step.\nWhen the Fáng hexagram arrives, fierce fire burns dry, borrowing the xùn wind.\nRefining the yellow sprout and white snow, the marvelous work returns to the Kūn Dao—\nHere the fire phase’s secrets are exhausted.*\n\nWhen tending the furnace, apply the firing sequence to open the path—light gradually brightens, growing day by day. *Chǒu*’s Great Frame forms, its rhythm rising and falling. *Lín* is the hexagram of two yangs. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Great Frame; in a day, it is cockcrow (*chǒu*); in a month, the third day’s half to the fifth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *chǒu*. At this time, yang qi gradually advances, like the body’s yang fire gradually flowing smoothly, the yellow path gradually brightening. Thus it is said: \"Light brightens, gradually advancing, growing day by day.\"\n\n*Tài* is the hexagram of three yangs, where firm and yielding flourish together, yin and yang conjoin—small departs, great arrives, converging at *yín*’s movement to follow the season. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Great Cluster; in a day, it is dawn (*yín*); in a month, the sixth to the eighth day’s half; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *yín*. At this time, yang qi emerges from the earth, like the body’s three yangs ascending—gradually rising, gradually lifting. One must swiftly drive the river chariot back into the crucible. Thus it is said: \"Moving to follow the season.\" At this stage of the fire phase’s movement, one must not pause.\n\nYet there is *yín* of a day, and *yín* of a moment. As the *Zǐ* poem says:\n*\"Diligently swallow saliva a thousand times,\nLong remember to guard the spirit at the fifth watch.\"*\nThis speaks of *yín* of a day.\n\nThe *Jīndān Dàchéng Jí* says:\n*\"When the three yangs meet the Tài hexagram,\nOne may advance the fire’s method and spiritual work.\"*\nThis speaks of *yín* of a moment.\n\nThe *yín* of a day naturally follows the celestial stems and branches as its measure—many in the world know this. But the *yín* of a moment is the body’s fire phase secret. Ancient and modern alchemical texts dare not speak of it plainly—truly, among thousands or tens of thousands, only one or two know it. Profound! Profound!\n\nGradually progressing through *Dàzhuàng*, the yang energy aligns with the *mǎo* gate, where elm pods fall and return to their root—*xíng* and *dé* counterbalance as day and night first divide.\n\n*Dàzhuàng* is the hexagram of four yang lines, corresponding to the *Jiázhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks dawn at *mǎo*; in a month, the eighth to the tenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *mǎo*. At this time, yin assists yang, qi gathers, and beings emerge. This illustrates the body’s yang fire at its midpoint, where the qi phase is evenly balanced—hence the saying, “*xíng* and *dé* counterbalance as day and night first divide.” Yet while all things flourish in spring, why do elm pods fall now? Because within yang, yin resides.\n\n*Guài* is the hexagram where yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and shaking off the dust of old perches. *Guài* is the hexagram of five yang lines, corresponding to the *Gūxǐ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *chén* hour of the morning meal; in a month, the eleventh to the thirteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *chén*. Now yang qi is abundant, pressing near the celestial heights—illustrating the body’s yang fire rising. Thus it speaks of “yang ascending forward,” and also of “washing and shaking off the dust of old perches,” for when the great roc prepares to migrate to the celestial pond, it strikes the water to ascend, its momentum surging forth.\n\n*Qián* is the hexagram of vigorous strength, its brilliance spreading to the four neighbors—yang culminates at *sì* and interacts. *Qián* is the hexagram of six yang lines, corresponding to the *Zhōnglǚ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *sì* hour of midday; in a month, the thirteenth to the fifteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *sì*. Now yang qi is at its peak, pervading all under heaven—illustrating the body’s yang fire reaching fullness, where the elixir’s radiance appears. The mountain spirit’s effluence divides into four streams, flowing down to nourish the land, its influence encompassing all—hence the saying, “spreading to the four neighbors.” It also speaks of “yang culminating at *sì* and interacting,” for when the yang fire’s number ends, the yin tally begins.\n\n*Gòu* marks the inception of yin’s thread, treading frost first at the well’s cold spring. *Wǔ* is *Ruíbīn*, where the guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host. *Gòu* is the hexagram of one yin line, corresponding to the *Ruíbīn* pitch. In a day, it marks noon at *wǔ*; in a month, the sixteenth to the eighteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *wǔ*. Now yin qi begins to arise—illustrating the body’s yin tally taking root. Once the numinous elixir enters the mouth, it returns to the cold spring. One must gently guide it back to the cinnabar field, without haste or urgency—hence the saying, “treading frost first at the well’s cold spring,” and also “the guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host,” for when one yin governs, the many yangs become guests. “Guest” means reverence, caution against peril and vigilance against danger.\n\n*Dùn* is the hexagram of withdrawing from the world, gathering one’s essence, cherishing virtue, and awaiting the time in obscurity. *Dùn* is the hexagram of two yin lines, corresponding to the *Línzhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks the *wèi* hour of the afternoon; in a month, the eighteenth to the twentieth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *wèi*. Now yin qi gradually lengthens—illustrating the body’s yin tally departing the *wǔ* position, withdrawing and descending, like a worthy retreating to seclusion in mountain valleys—hence the saying, “cherishing virtue, awaiting the time in obscurity.”\n\n*Pǐ* is the hexagram of blockage, where nothing sprouts, yin advances and yang recedes, names and reputations are marred. *Pǐ* is the hexagram of three yin lines, corresponding to the *Yízé* pitch. In a day, it marks the *shēn* hour of dusk; in a month, the twenty-first to the twenty-third day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *shēn*. Now yang qi gradually wanes—illustrating the body’s yin tally descending further, like the three yins’ austere season when grasses and trees wither—hence the saying, “yin advances and yang recedes, names and reputations are marred.”\n\n*Guān* is the hexagram of observing the scales, discerning the autumnal mood, where the young and tender are stored, the old and withered revive—shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, sprouting forth under cover. *Guān* is the hexagram of four yin lines, corresponding to the *Nánlǚ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *yǒu* hour of sunset; in a month, the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *yǒu*. Now yin assists yang’s work, and all things contract to fruition—illustrating the body’s yin tally passing its midpoint, descending into the cinnabar field, like trees withdrawing blossoms to bear fruit—hence the saying, “storing the young and tender.” Yet while all things wither in autumn, why do shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout now? Because within yin, yang resides.\n\n*Bō* is the hexagram of decay, where limbs rot and forms dissolve, qi transforms and exhausts, the utmost spirit is lost. *Bō* is the hexagram of five yin lines, corresponding to the *Wúshè* pitch. In a day, it marks the *xū* hour of twilight; in a month, the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *xū*. Now yang qi declines and perishes, fruits on branches rot and fall to the earth—illustrating the body’s yin tally nearing its end, where spiritual work has no place to act—hence the saying, “qi transforms and exhausts, the utmost spirit is lost.” Fire is born at *yín*, flourishes at *wǔ*, and is buried at *xū*—*xū* is the time of enclosure. The fire phase of a moment concludes here, as the *Fùmìng* chapter says: “East and west, movement and stillness, unite at dawn and dusk.” The fire phase of a day also rests here, as Lü Chunyang’s poem says: “Day after day, following him out and sinking again.” Trivial side gates and minor arts know only one aspect but not the other—how could they ever fully comprehend this?\n\nWhen the Way is exhausted, it returns to *Kūn*’s origin, ever compliant with earth’s patterns, bearing heaven’s mandate to spread the profound and distant, bridging the subtle and obscure. It nurtures the seeds of yin and yang’s source, vast and indistinct, without discernible beginning. Those who lose the track first wander astray; later, they become the lord and ruler.\n\n*Kūn* is the hexagram of six yin lines, corresponding to the *Yìngzhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks the *hài* hour of the night’s quiet; in a month, the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *hài*. Now pure yin governs, and all things return to their root to renew their mandate—illustrating the body’s yin tally reaching its limit, then becoming utterly still, returning to the root and restoring tranquility—hence the saying, “When the Way is exhausted, it returns to *Kūn*’s origin.” “Ever compliant with earth’s patterns, bearing heaven’s mandate to spread” echoes the earlier passage: “The metal elixir arises from the sun, receiving the solar tally at dawn”—for heaven, earth, sun, and moon are one.\n\nThe moon receives the sun’s light, yet the sun is not diminished thereby—thus the moon’s light is the sun’s light. Heaven’s *qi* descends to earth, and all living things within the earth are born of heaven’s *qi*. The human body models heaven above and mirrors earth below; the interplay of yin and yang within it differs not from that of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Returning to the Origin* chapter states: “With spirit returning to *qi*, the inner elixir’s Dao naturally forms.” If one can turn inward, gather spirit, and merge it into the *qi*-cavern, then spirit abides, life-*qi* congeals into liquid. When the celestial mechanism stirs, the red lotus holds its bud, dewdrops gather in jade hues, and as they descend into the Flower Pool, drop by drop, the cinnabar field coalesces—forming the elixir’s pivot.\n\n“Vast and distant, faintly linked” refers to the juncture between *hài* and *zǐ*, the threshold where yin and yang exchange. At the moment when six yin lines reach their limit and the first yang has yet to arise, all is still and silent, as in the primordial chaos before heaven and earth divided. It is at this hour that the immortal forges the elixir: sealing the senses, lowering the eyelids, and directing the spirit’s light downward into the *kǎn* palace. At first, all is dim and obscure, like moonlight steeped in a frigid pool. Then spirit and *qi* unite, faintly communicating across barriers—akin to a lodestone drawing iron.\n\n“Corresponding to pitch, nurturing the seed of yin and yang’s origin” describes the elixir-making process as mirroring the time when pure *Kūn* governs in the *hài* month. Then all things return to their root, sealing themselves in winter’s hibernation. Though winter rules concealment, the year’s generative power is in truth conceived within it—merely hidden, its traces unseen by men. Thus the ancients named this pure yin month the “yang month,” for at the *xiǎoxuě* solar term, yang *qi* already stirs beneath the six yin lines. Accumulating until the winter solstice, it fills one yang stroke, transforming into the *Fù* hexagram.\n\nThe elixir’s Dao follows the same pattern: when night’s *qi* is not yet spent, one gathers spirit, collects *qi*, and sits upright for a brief while. Soon spirit and *qi* return to their root, and from nothing, something arises—gradually congealing, accumulating into a single droplet of golden essence.\n\nThe *Emerald Canopy* chapter states: “Golden essence is the medicine of the *Kūn* palace.” *Kūn* lies in the southwest, the river’s source; the toad’s glow shines all day upon the western river—this is the medicine’s root. For the first yang does not arise in *Fù* but in *Kūn*. Though *Kūn* is utmost yin, within yin yang is born—thus it is the river-source that produces the medicine.\n\n“Vast and indistinct, its beginning unknown” describes the moment when body and mind return to their mandate, spirit enters the vastness, and one becomes one with the Great Void. After long stillness, when the heart’s flower blooms, the three palaces fill with *qi*—all feels hazy and indistinct, its cause unfathomable.\n\nFor within the hazy and indistinct, there is substance; within the deep and obscure, there is essence—this is the crux of cultivation. The *Book of Jade Fungus* states: “These four lines have been recited by countless millions through the ages, yet how many truly grasp their meaning? Without direct experience, none can know.”\n\nThus, to depict its depth is like gazing into an abyss; to speak of its indistinctness is like waking from a daydream—this is the true scene, not mere analogy. Scholars who have not undergone this experience fail to recognize that the deep and indistinct, the hazy and vague, are the true landscapes of their own bodies. Too often, they dismiss them as empty rhetoric—what a pity!\n\nKnow this: the deep and obscure is the stillness before movement, the time before heaven and earth divided within one’s body. The hazy and indistinct is the moment of resonance and communication, the time when heaven and earth are about to separate within one’s body. The marvel of elixir-making lies precisely here—how can this be dismissed as empty rhetoric?\n\nThe *Red Dragon Great Elixir Formula* states: “None understand the indistinct; only I know the dim. Truly, few grasp this.” “First losing the track, later becoming lord and ruler” describes the initial state of profound obscurity, deeply entering into...\n\nWithin the profound obscurity, in but a fleeting moment, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; stillness reaches its limit and the mechanism stirs. Then the gate of the face bursts open, the void shatters, and a radiance of wind and light breaks through the desolation—transforming power returns to one’s grasp.\n\nMaster Wei’s chapter clearly expounds the source of elixir-production and exhaustively discusses the secrets of existence and non-existence, host and guest, before and after—so thorough that nothing more can be added. The *Returning Gold Treatise* states: “Vast and distant, one but scoops the moon from water; distinct and clear, one only gathers the flower in the mirror.” Truly, none but those deeply versed in the Dao can recognize this.\n\n“No level ground but slopes”—such is the natural transformation of the Way. Flourishing and decline, waxing and waning, all follow one another. From *kun* it ends, from *fu* it begins, like tracing an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings ride this current and endure for a thousand autumns.\n\n“No level ground but slopes, no going but return”—this is the natural course of the Dao. In elixir-methods, stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises; movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns. One movement, one stillness, each the root of the other—this too arises from nature. Like the sun and moon in their course, one cold, one hot: when summer departs, winter comes; when winter departs, summer comes—all is natural.\n\nThe golden elixir is the *Yi* within the body. When the *Yi* is exhausted, it transforms; when it transforms, it flows. Flourishing and decline succeed one another; waxing and waning follow in turn. There has never been exhaustion that did not transform, transformation that did not flow. Yang begins at *fu* and yin ends at *kun*; end and beginning join, head and tail link—thus it is said, “From *kun* it ends, from *fu* it begins, like tracing an unbroken ring.” Master Wei discusses the firing times through the twelve *pi* hexagrams and employs the names of pitch-pipes and celestial stems in his exposition—all are metaphors.\n\nFor instance, “spokes converging” corresponds to *Taicu*, “flanking ranks” to *Jiazhong*, “washing” to *Guxi*, “center” to *Zhonglü*, “perching” to *Linzhong*, “bearing” to *Nanlü*, “wounding” to *Yize*, “perishing” to *wangshe*, “responding” to *Yingzhong*, “shaking” to *chen*, “dusk” to *wei*, “stretching” to *shen*, “storing” to *you*, “extinguishing” to *xu*, and “blocking” to *hai*—all are borrowed terms. One must not cling to the words or force interpretations that spawn unnecessary complications.\n\n“Emperors and kings ride this current and endure for a thousand autumns” refers to the noble one who, throughout the day, remains *gan gan*, advancing with the times—truly, such a one can traverse a thousand autumns and endure.\n\nIf one wishes to nurture one’s nature and prolong one’s life, one must first carefully consider the end and then reflect on the beginning. One should ponder the original constitution of the body one received at birth—a single undifferentiated primordial essence, flowing and spreading, borne by qi from the outset.\n\nWhether foolish or wise, all share this same nature, this same life. The noble one, knowing that nature must not be harmed, preserves and nurtures it; knowing that life must not be cut short, safeguards and extends it. Even without relying on cultivation, none fail to live in peace and meet a timely end. How much more so when one obtains the method of cultivation, steals from heaven and earth, seizes the workings of creation, refines the hun and po into one, and unites nature and life in dual cultivation—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nTo seek longevity, one must seek the state before one’s birth—how this body came to be—only then can one discuss the way of nurturing nature and prolonging life. Thus it is said: “Carefully consider the end, then reflect on the beginning.” For when a person is born, it is through the union of the parents’ qi that form is completed. Form is the foundation that receives qi; qi is the root that gives rise to form. If qi does not obtain form, there is no basis for existence; if form does not obtain qi, there is no means for completion. Hence it is said: “The body one receives at birth is originally a single undifferentiated primordial essence, flowing and spreading, borne by qi from the outset.”\n\nNow, when immortals cultivate the elixir, they inwardly stimulate yin and yang, causing spirit and qi to unite, giving birth to being from non-being—this is fundamentally the same principle as the conception of a child in the womb. The ten months of gentle nurturing, the ceaseless true breathing day and night, are no different from the state before an infant is born. The *Song of the Great Dao’s Mystic Source* states:\n\n*Just observe the infant in the womb—*\n*How could it scheme with calculating mind?*\n*It refines qi to utmost softness, spirit lingers long;*\n*Incoming and outgoing, true breathing rests of itself.*\n\nFor when the infant is in the mother’s womb, when the mother exhales, it exhales; when the mother inhales, it inhales. Mouth and nose are closed, and all is conducted through the navel. Thus the navel is the root of life, the stem of qi.\n\nLü Chunyang’s *Song of the Mystic Female* says:\n\n*Exhaustively seek the moment of receiving qi at birth—*\n*No wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.*\n*If one can exhaustively seek the thought that gave rise to one’s birth,*\n*Return to the source, turn the light inward, and illuminate within,*\n*Gather the medicine in the southwest, at the root and stem of the kun abdomen,*\n*Then one resembles the moment of receiving qi at birth—*\n*What need is there for further seeking?*\n\nAlas, scholars often cling to words and rigidly adhere to images, each insisting their own view is correct. Those who favor lofty ideas mistake the golden elixir for Chan Buddhism, taking the cultivation of nature as the mystic female and the stirring of thoughts as the birth of the first yang. They dismiss the practice of prolonging life as the “light beneath the skull.” Those of baser inclinations mistake the golden elixir for the art of bedroom cultivation, taking women as the crucible, the birth gate as the place of origin, and the absorption of essences as the medicinal powder. They mock the nurturing of nature as “dry sitting on a meditation cushion.” One group sinks into emptiness and stillness; the other falls into depravity and perversion—both cling to their errors for a lifetime without awakening. How deeply lamentable!\n\nIt is like a chicken’s egg: yin and yang, black and white, support each other, spanning but an inch at the beginning. Over time, the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape. After ten months, it hatches from the womb—bones weak enough to bend, flesh smooth as malt sugar. The black and white are the two qi of yin and yang.\n\nWhen a person is conceived, it begins with the father’s essence and mother’s blood—the two qi of yin and yang temporarily unite to form a state of primordial chaos, like a chicken’s egg. After a hundred days, the male and female forms differentiate, and the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape. When the time comes, the child is born, emerging from the womb—bones weak, sinews soft, flesh tender and smooth—called an infant.\n\nThose who refine the golden elixir cultivate the infant within their own body, and it too must undergo ten months of nurturing. The *Cui Xu Treatise* states:\n\n*In the past, when I practiced for a year,*\n*The six pulses stilled, qi returned to the root,*\n*And an infant dwelled in the cinnabar field—*\n*Its form and appearance were just like mine.*\n\nTruly, in the cultivation of the sacred embryo, there has never been one who achieved swift success without ten months of effort.\n\nYin and yang serve as the measure where the hun and po reside. Heaven has the ecliptic as its measure—three hundred and sixty-five degrees. In its revolution, it completes one cycle each day. The sun and moon travel within it, moving up and down, alternating in their exits and entrances—this is how day and night are divided and cold and heat determined. Yet the celestial path’s subtle rotation has no fixed measure; it is through the sun and moon’s passage through the celestial stems that their course is measured. The sun and moon’s movements have no fixed abode; it is through their places of morning and evening exits and entrances that their residence is determined.\n\nUnderstanding this, one then grasps what Master Wei meant by “yin and yang serve as the measure where the hun and po reside.” The ecliptic within the human body is the path where the yin tally and yang fire proceed—it is the direction where the sun’s hun and moon’s po reside. One who can observe heaven’s way, grasp heaven’s movement, recognize the course of yin and yang, and know the dwelling of the hun and po—such a one circulates the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial cycle within the span of a single breath, and the sun and moon exit and enter within the subtlety of inhalation and exhalation. Exhalation is yang, inhalation is yin—this shares the same wondrous function as the celestial path. There is no need to seek it elsewhere.\n\nThe yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit is the moon’s po—hun and po serve as each other’s dwelling. An ancient song says: *\"If one recognizes the sun’s hun and moon’s po, that one is a true immortal.\"* What is called the sun’s hun and moon’s po here is not the manifest, visible sun’s hun and moon’s po of heaven and earth, but rather the concealed, formless sun’s hun and moon’s po within our own bodies. Without the instruction of a true master, how could one recognize them?\n\nNow, the sun is the Great Yang, its light unfolding by day, hence called *hun*; the moon is the Great Yin, its radiance contained by night, hence called *po*. The sun’s hun belongs to yang and is rightly termed the *yang spirit*, while the moon’s po belongs to yin and may properly be called *yin essence*—how could it be spoken of as *spirit*? Yet both are now called *spirit* because they are ceaselessly transforming, never abiding, circulating through the six directions, coming and going without fixed place or constant position.\n\nThe hun is the wood of the eastern direction; the po is the metal of the western direction. Metal and wood are originally of one body—when the eastern neighbor moves, it is immediately the western household. They alternate between east and west, each serving as the other’s dwelling, hence it is said they *mutually serve as chambers*.\n\nNature presides within, establishing the inner citadel; emotion governs without, ever fortifying the outer walls. When the walls are complete, all beings find peace. At this time, emotion harmonizes with heaven and earth.\n\n*Nature* (性) means stillness; *presiding within* refers to sitting upright, emptying the heart, and turning the gaze inward. *Establishing the inner citadel* means seizing the golden essence to lay the foundation of life. *Emotion* (情) means movement; *governing without* refers first to the pivot of the mechanism, which moves day and night. *Ever fortifying the outer walls* means the dragon’s fire encircling all eight directions. When the walls are complete and all beings find peace, the qi surges through the joints, penetrating naturally, essence fills the valley, and the spirit of the valley abides. At this time, *emotion harmonizes with heaven and earth* means the river chariot never pauses, day or night, silently aligning with the great creation in its movement.\n\nQian is active and straight, its qi spreading, essence flowing; Kun is still and receptive, converging to form the Dao’s sanctuary. Qian is heaven, governing movement, unfolding all things to reach throughout the universe—hence it is said to be *straight*. Because it is active and straight, its essence and qi flow and spread, filling the three palaces without exception. Kun is earth, governing stillness, gathering all things to be stored within the soil—hence it is said to be *receptive*. Because it is still and receptive, its essence and qi return to the original sea, forming the Dao’s sanctuary. Generally, abiding in Qian means activity, and activity means qi spreads and essence flows; abiding in Kun means stillness, and stillness means qi gathers and essence congeals.\n\nThe firm descends and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. When Qian’s yang descends to aid Kun, Kun’s yielding receptivity embraces it, giving birth to the medicine. Once the fire of refinement is applied, the firm descends and retreats, while the yielding yin ascends, transforming into sweet springs that moisten the nine realms.\n\nNine returns, seven reverses, eight reverts, six abides. The six, seven, eight, and nine correspond to water, fire, wood, and metal. In terms of trigrams, they are Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui; in terms of directions, east, west, south, and north; in terms of lunar lodges, Xu, Fang, Xing, and Mao; in terms of symbols, the tortoise-snake, dragon, and tiger; in terms of seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in terms of earthly branches, zi, wu, mao, and you—all are the same entities.\n\nNow, nine is called *return*, seven *reverse*, eight *revert*, yet six alone is called *abide*—this is because the north, the position of Kan, is the native home of true lead. When true lead abides here, the upright qi of the nine metals, eight woods, and seven fires, like spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea, all gather here.\n\nWang Baoyi’s commentary on the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* states: *\"The sun has three illuminations, the moon three shifts. When the sun and moon emerge in the east and shine upon the west, the upright qi of the west’s White Tiger, the metal virtue, enters the mysterious barrier and transforms into the six wu. When the sun and moon set in the west and shine upon the east, the upright qi of the east’s Green Dragon, the wood virtue, enters the mysterious barrier and transforms into the six si. When the sun and moon reside in the south and shine upon the north, the upright qi of the south’s Vermilion Bird, the fire virtue, enters the mysterious barrier, takes earthly form, and transforms into black lead, ever abiding in the profound barrier as the root of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things.\"* Wang’s explanation and Master Wei’s words may be said to be of different eras yet in perfect accord.\n\nMale white, female red—metal and fire restrain each other, and thus water is stabilized. Water is the first of the five phases.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* says: *\"A strange matter that makes people laugh many times—now even men...\"*\n\nWithin the body’s chamber, conception arises—one’s own essence and blood naturally unite, forming the wondrous union of husband and wife. The sacred embryo of the Golden Elixir is born of the inner resonance of yin and yang, the conjoining of spirit and qi. \"Male and female,\" \"white and red\"—these are but alternate names for the husband and wife within. When yin and yang inwardly resonate, spirit and qi unite like metal and fire restraining each other. As metal and fire restrain each other and settle in the north, within the Water of Kan, spirit congeals and qi gathers, and the water naturally stabilizes. Once water is stabilized, the medicinal substances coalesce.\n\nThe *Huán Jīn Piān* says: *\"When water clarifies and congeals, it is like amber.\"* Water is the root-source of the Great Elixir. Heaven engenders water first; its position is in the north, its hexagram is Kan, and it stands at the head of the five phases. It is the homeland where the medicinal substances of our body are produced. If one can inwardly turn the light to reflect here—exhaling ever so slightly, inhaling ever so softly, without interruption—then spirit and qi return to the root, gradually entering, gradually softening, gradually harmonizing, and gradually stabilizing. When this stabilization endures, breath ceases, and the medicinal substances will naturally coalesce.\n\nThe highest good is like water, clear and flawless. The highest good is like water, flowing where it will without contention. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is non-action, likewise flowing where it will without contention. The *Yǔlù* of Master Ma Danyang says: *\"The cultivator of the Dao, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, must not for a moment let the heart stray from the Dao. When walking, place the feet on level ground; when standing, concentrate the spirit in the Great Void; when sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of the nose; when lying down, embrace the pearl below the navel. With long and unbroken practice, one becomes as if dull-witted—this alone is the true work, not the contrived effort of forced discipline.\"* Is this not \"flowing where it will without contention\"?\n\nThe *Wù Zhēn Piān* says: *\"Do not merely guard the furnace and watch the fire; simply settle the spirit and rest in naturalness.\"* The *Shàng Qīng Jí* says: *\"The immortal’s art is not complex—it is merely a single taste of dullness in the human realm.\"* This, too, is \"flowing where it will without contention.\"\n\nWater’s nature is stillness and stability; when settled, it clarifies, but when disturbed, it muddies. The marvel of the Golden Elixir arises entirely from stillness and stability. The *Huán Yuán Piān* says: *\"Know the medicine and the fire, and in stability, witness the Elixir’s formation.\"* For there has never been one who attained it without stability.\n\nThe Dao has no form or image; the True One is difficult to depict. It transforms and scatters, each part dwelling alone. *\"There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name, so I style it the Dao.\"* It has no form to seek, no image to behold—how could it be captured in a diagram?\n\nLong ago, Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor: *\"The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dark and silent.\"* In that profound obscurity and dark silence, not a single thought arises, and the ten thousand concerns vanish. All is merged and boundless, like the undivided Great Ultimate; vast and formless, like the unmanifested Two Modes. Only this one thing remains, serene and solitary, like the moon reflected in a clear abyss, motionless as still water without ripples. One knows not what is lead or what is mercury—this is called the True One. When the time arrives and qi transforms and scatters, the light and pure ascend, while the heavy and turbid settle below. Thus, in the Kan Palace there is lead, and in the Li Palace there is mercury. What was once merged and boundless, vast and formless, now divides into two, each dwelling alone.\n\nThe *Fù Mìng Piān* says: *\"One thing divides into two—knowing these two is to name the furnace and cauldron. The dripping of the water clock has reached the third watch.\"* This is what it refers to.\n\nThe great medicine of the Golden Elixir is conceived in the prior heaven and born in the posterior heaven. Its marvel lies in the moment when the Great Ultimate is about to divide yet remains undivided—when stillness has reached its extreme but has not yet given way to movement, when yang is about to return but has not yet departed from yin. Here, the mechanism of heaven and earth converges, and the place where the Elixir coalesces is known. Recognizing the secret of where to begin, one finds something within the indistinct, draws true essence from the profound, and realizes that the Great Dao arises from non-being into being. Truly, the marvel of the True One cannot be captured in a diagram.\n\nYet, in the end, is there no way to reveal the marvel of the True One? The yang-sui mirror does not produce fire without the sun; the fang-zhu vessel cannot yield water without the moon and stars. Though the two qi are suspended far apart, their resonance and transformation still communicate—how much more so when they are intimately present within the heart and breast, where yin and yang pair like the sun and moon, and water and fire respond as evidence?\n\nThe *Zhou Li*, in the *Autumn Offices*, states that the *Si Xuan Shi* is charged with using the fu-sui to draw bright fire from the sun and the mirror to draw bright water from the moon. The *Huainanzi* says: *\"When the fang-zhu faces the moon, it exudes water.\"* Gao You’s commentary notes: *\"The fang-zhu is the yin-sui, a large clam.\"* Though the earth is separated from heaven by countless thousands of miles, and the sun and moon hang in the void at an equal distance from the earth, the yang-sui, when facing the sun, obtains fire, and the fang-zhu, when facing the moon, obtains water. How swiftly their resonance and transformation communicate!\n\nHow much more so when they are intimately present within the heart and breast? Within the body, there is water and fire; within the heart, there are medicinal materials. Should one not inwardly turn the light to reflect and seek the marvel of this resonance? Moreover, on the bright night of the fifteenth of the eighth month, the *xiao* in the deep mountains forms its embryo, and the oyster in the blue sea forms its pearl. What causes their resonance and transformation to be so marvelously swift?\n\nBorn between heaven and earth as the most intelligent of the ten thousand things, humans cannot steal from heaven and earth or seize the workings of creation—they are not even the equal of the hare or the oyster. Have those who study immortality ever paid heed to this?\n\nGenerally, when yin and yang attain harmony, their resonance is natural. Master Wei used the yang-sui to draw fire and the fang-zhu to draw water as proof, urging cultivators to inwardly observe and realize being within non-being. Their resonance and transformation are just like this.\n\nThe *Huán Dān Piān* says: *\"When the two qi meet, sweet rain descends; when the two spirits unite, jade nectar flows.\"* This is indeed so.\n\nThe mirror and the pearl are both luminous and pure, transparent inside and out, without the slightest blemish. Thus, they can gather the light of the sun and moon into a single grain of brightness. Though vast and distant, they respond immediately. Yet when settled, they gather, and gathering, they exist; when moved, they scatter, and scattering, they vanish. If one can empty the heart, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly stabilize without the slightest stray thought, then the light of one’s own sun and moon will gather without scattering. When qi stabilizes over time, wondrous effects will naturally arise.\n\nThe supreme Dao is not far off—it is ever before one’s eyes. It is like the magnet that draws iron, though obstructed, its resonance is intimate and near. Yet the world’s people are deluded and turn away, unable to seek it within.\n\nNing Xuanzi’s poem says:\n*\"Diligently, I discuss with master and disciple—\nNot elsewhere, but right before one’s eyes.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"That one phrase received from the master’s side,\nSecretly bestowed, carefully observed—\nHow very near it is!\"*\n\nThe ear, eye, and mouth—three treasures—must be firmly sealed and not discharged. The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"The nine orifices’ deviance lies in the three essentials.\" What are these three essentials? The ear, eye, and mouth. Here, Master Wei designates them as the \"three treasures\" and says they must be \"firmly sealed and not discharged,\" urging those who cultivate and refine to restrain the ear’s and eye’s acuity, seal the throat’s and tongue’s true qi, and gather all inward without letting it leak outward—like treasuring and concealing a precious jewel.\n\nHave you not seen the pot and steamer cooking rice? The lid is sealed tightly above, firewood burns below, and no crack—even the thinnest—exists on the outside, while within, steam swirls and gathers. In an instant, the rice is steamed and done. Now, when one enters the chamber to cultivate and refine, one must withdraw sight and return hearing, close the mouth and hold the saliva, allowing not the slightest leakage of true qi. Only then will the supreme medicine arise and the great elixir ripen. If the ear is drawn by sound, the eye pulled by form, and the \"towering pavilion\" (breath) flows out ceaselessly—if all three are discharged without restraint—how can the returned elixir ever be sought?\n\nThe true person abides in the deep abyss, floating and wandering, guarding the center of the compass. This true person is the primordial spirit.\n\nThe \"deep abyss\" is the Great Abyss—its alternate names are many. Let us now enumerate them: Mud-Pill Palace, Flowing Pearl Palace, Jade Purity Palace, Purple Purity Palace, Emerald Microcosm Palace, Grand Microcosm Palace, Supreme Unity Palace, Supreme Mystery Pass, Mystery Gate, Mystery Palace, Mystery Chamber, Mystery Valley, Mystery Field, Cinnabar Field, First Pass, Capital Pass, Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Gate, Heavenly Valley, Heavenly Field, Heavenly Heart, Heavenly Wheel, Heavenly Axis, Heavenly Source, Heavenly Pool, Heavenly Root, Heavenly Hall, Heavenly Palace, Qian Palace, Qian Household, Intermingling Palace, Li Palace, Spirit Palace, Spirit Chamber, Spirit Pass, Spirit Capital, Spirit Metropolis, Mystery Metropolis, Former Metropolis, Former Homeland, Former Mound, Former Grove, Former Palace, Purple Court, Purple Court, Purple Gold City, Purple Gold Crucible, Cinnabar Crucible, Mercury Crucible, Jade Crucible, Jade Chamber, Jade Capital, Jade Universe, Jasper Peak, First Peak, Supreme Peak, Zhurong Peak, Kunlun Summit, Kongtong Mountain, Penglai Upper Isle, Upper Capital, Upper Palace, Upper Mystery, Upper Prime, Upper Valley, Upper Earth, Cauldron, Upper Cinnabar Field. Though these names are many, their essence is one.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Heaven has seven stars, earth seven treasures, and man seven orifices—all authority returns to the brain.\" The *Tai Gu Ji* says: \"When the golden elixir circulates to the Mud-Pill Cavity, the name and surname are first inscribed in the Jade Capital.\" The Dao of the Former Emperor’s return flows upstream through the hundred meridians to replenish the Mud-Pill, and when the brain is full, the spirit is whole; when the spirit is whole, the form is whole.\n\nNow, when Master Wei speaks of \"the true person abiding in the deep abyss, floating and wandering, guarding the center of the compass,\" he refers to following the true breath’s ebb and flow, allowing the true qi to rise and descend. From dawn to dusk, the primordial spirit constantly dwells in the Mud-Pill. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.\" In quietude, one chants: \"I cultivate Kunlun and obtain the true formula.\" The *Fuming Pian* states: \"Return to my home and cultivate a mu of Heavenly Field.\" The *Huanyuan Pian* says: \"Awakening to the Dao is luminously clear; in spacious leisure, sit upright and move the Heavenly Pass.\" This is the simplest and easiest of ways: merely stir the pass at the crown of the head, and in even, silent stillness, lift the Three Palaces. Naturally, ascent and descent occur, and the hundred bones and myriad orifices become unobstructed—like a ten-thousand-hulled boat set in motion by a single span of wood, or a thousand-jun crossbow triggered by a single inch of mechanism. Yet it expends not the slightest effort; only the deluded fail to believe it. Some visualize Lord Lao in the Mud-Pill Palace and silently pay homage—this is truly superfluous.\n\nTurning and curving to survey, opening and closing all conform to the axis of the self; movement and stillness are inexhaustible. The *Qiong Huangji Jingshi Shu* says: \"The spirit of heaven dwells in the sun; the spirit of man emerges from the eyes.\" How great indeed!\n\nThe human spirit emerges from the eyes—when the body is born, this essence precedes heaven and earth; when the body perishes, this essence outlasts heaven and earth. The Five Phases of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth converge here; the five viscera of liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys gather their numinous power here; the seven substances of saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and marrow crystallize their brilliance here. In its vastness, it can contain heaven and earth; in its subtlety, not even a mote of dust can enter. Is this not the great treasure within this single body?\n\nThe *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"Containing the light is the elixir of long life.\" The *Shangpin Xian* says: \"Gather the twin pupils before the eyes and refine them—this alone can guard against the golden immortals.\" Such direct instructions are given, yet scholars may still fail to awaken. How deeply benighted they are!\n\nFor the Three Palaces rise and descend, ascending and descending without end—like a wheel in ceaseless motion. Their operation lies in the heart, as the wheel’s hub; their pivot rests in the eyes, as the axle’s linchpin. The *Jinhua Shi* says: \"The immortal lad guards only the cavern’s gate, while the true person of the Three Isles eternally comes and goes.\" This is indeed the case.\n\nWhen *li* qi flourishes within, defense is perfected; when *kan* ceases to rely on hearing, *dui* unites without speech, and words grow rare to follow the primordial chaos. These three, once secured, the body relaxes in an empty chamber.\n\n*Li* qi flourishes within defense when the eyes are drawn inward and the light is not revealed. *Kan* ceases to rely on hearing when the ears are turned inward to listen, and hearing is not leaked. *Dui* unites without speech, words grow rare, and primordial chaos is followed when the heart’s chamber is as cold as ash, utterly silent—guarding the sacred embryo. Once these three are thus secured, the body should relax in an empty chamber.\n\nTo relax the body is to move slowly, with ease and without straining the form. To dwell in an empty chamber is to enter a quiet room—within it, nothing else should be placed, save a single incense burner, a lamp, a small table, and a couch. The seating should be neither too bright (lest it harm the *hun*) nor too dark (lest it harm the *po*). For the *hun* favors brightness, the *po* favors darkness; brightness belongs to yang, darkness to yin. Thus the *Cuixu Pian* advises: \"The chamber should face wood, toward the morning sun, with *dui*’s brightness facing the evening light,\" and also: \"Do not rest with a bright lamp or a hundred harmonies.\"\n\nEntering a quiet chamber to cultivate is a matter of the greatest karmic affinity—how could it be a trivial undertaking? Have you not seen the *Wu Zhen Pian*? It says: \"This Way is most divine and sacred; I fear your allotment is too meager to bear it.\" How could one without virtue and conduct dare covet it?\n\nYet the quiet chamber need not be confined to mountain forests—it may be within a city wall or a village of the Dao. Wherever one finds refuge, there is no place it cannot be. Some doubt the *Wu Zhen Pian*’s mention of relying on the powerful in bustling cities, but this refers to the time before the great elixir is formed, when one cannot endure the cold and heat of the four seasons in a single year, or the hunger and thirst of the three daily meals before true qi is complete. Thus Wu Daling found Zhang and Cheng as friends; Zhang Ziyang found Ma and Lu as patrons; Wang Chongxi relied on the wealthy Han; Li Changyuan depended on his kinsmen of Junyang. All achieved success through the fire-times of the celestial revolution, requiring unbroken effort. One must have like-minded, capable companions to provide protection, supplies, and service, shielding one from the theft of qi by hunger, cold, and hardship—only then can one focus wholeheartedly on cultivation.\n\nThe *Yin Zhenjun Jinye Huandan Ge* says: \"Without the proper place, do not act recklessly.\" The *Wu Zhen Pian* says: \"The treasure of life should not be lightly toyed with.\" Those who attain the true transmission of this Way will know this for themselves.\n\nEntrust your will to emptiness and nothingness, making this your constant practice. To entrust your will to emptiness and nothingness is to keep the heart free of杂念 and the mind from wandering outward, dwelling all day in true emptiness. To make this your constant practice is to let thoughts follow one another without interruption, aligning the breath with the celestial Dao.\n\nSome suspect this method resembles Chan practice, but they do not realize that the golden elixir arises from nothing to become something, nurturing the infant immortal—this is not the same as sitting like a block of wood or dead ash. The *Bai Ziqing Yulu* says: \"The first oral instruction for refining the elixir is to gather qi and congeal spirit. Constantly maintain firmness—this is gathering qi. Thought after thought, guard silence—this is congealing spirit.\" If scholars only know emptiness of heart and thought but do not gather qi and congeal spirit, they fall into dead emptiness—how then can the immortal embryo be formed?\n\nProof shifts with the progress of the heart’s focus. With three parts effort, there is three parts proof; with ten parts effort, ten parts proof. If one practices diligently, day and night without rest, after a hundred days of effort, the numinous power manifests: the two kidneys become as if scalded, the bladder as if afire, the eyes radiate spirit-light, and the ears...\n\nThe ears hear subtle sounds, the nose detects rare fragrances, and the mouth fills with sweet fluids—this body becomes supple and flowing, its proofs shifting day by day. What is prized in maintaining a focused heart without distraction is the very fear that, should one’s grasp of principle remain incomplete, one might be ensnared by demonic realms during the liminal state between stillness and dream. The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Pointer to the Mystery* states: \"Do not cling to external phenomena; single-mindedly guard the coiled tiger and dragon.\" This is indeed the teaching. Ding Lingyang’s *Heart and Nature Secrets* says: \"If, in deep stillness, one suddenly sees immortals, Buddhas, demons, spirits, towers, or radiant lights—any phenomena appearing before the eyes—one must not generate attachment or aversion.\" The master says: \"Within the vast emptiness of one’s own nature, let the myriad transformations unfold. If the heart remains unmoved, all delusions will naturally retreat. When the heart-fire does not arise, spirit and qi converge, mother and child unite, and naturally water and fire achieve harmony. As water encounters fire, it transforms into qi, rising to permeate every orifice, naturally regulating the hundred vessels and harmonizing the four great elements. Guard this diligently, and the Dao will spontaneously align.\"\n\nWang Xi’s *Panshan Record* states: \"In stillness, the practitioner may encounter manifold illusions, all conjured by the discriminating mind, arising in quietude to lure the sovereign heart. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *All phenomena are illusory*? If the mind seeks to dispel the discriminating consciousness while it yet lingers, it will manifest forms—demonic faces and spirit-heads—to disturb the sovereign heart. If the sovereign remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, the body merges with emptiness, leaving no trace to grasp, and the illusions will naturally dissolve.\" Guan Yinzi says: \"When a person’s eyes suddenly perceive extraordinary things in ordinary times, it is because essence has congealed to produce them. When a sick person’s eyes suddenly perceive extraordinary things, it is because the heart harbors deficiency. If one knows that the heart can manifest being from non-being, one also knows it can manifest non-being from being. Simply do not believe in them, and they will naturally lose their numinosity.\" Someone asked: \"When consciousness is dimmed, who can avoid belief?\" I replied: \"Like the snake-catcher whose heart fears not the serpent, though he dreams of snakes, he feels no terror.\" The Yellow Emperor said: \"The Dao has no demons or spirits; it moves alone, comes alone.\" Observing these teachings, we understand why Master Wei’s admonition—\"focus the heart without distraction\"—is indeed the essential principle for cultivation.\n\nIn sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, one attends to the moments of presence and absence. Essence arises at its appointed time, and spirit knows the hundred divisions of the day. Beware of dullness and confusion; one must maintain unbroken awareness in movement and stillness, as if brooding over an egg, keeping the warmth unceasing—only then can it be called cultivation. With sincere accumulation and prolonged effort, skill becomes pure, and day and night merge into one, with no distinction between dream and waking. Even in sleep, spirit remains lucid, and when essence arises, spirit communes with heaven. Though uncalled, it awakens of itself. Xia Yunfeng said: \"The natural timing is even in dreams.\" This is the teaching.\n\nNow Master Wei speaks of \"in sleep, spirit embracing spirit; upon waking, attending to presence and absence,\" urging cultivators to remain ever vigilant. The great elixir of golden cinnabar is formed through the union of spirit and qi, transforming the insubstantial into substance to gestate the sacred embryo. One must guard it with diligence for ten months, like a young woman’s first pregnancy or a small dragon newly nurturing its pearl. As spirit and qi first congeal, they are easily scattered. In sleep, one must embrace spirit closely, never sinking into dreamy confusion. Upon waking, one must fear the cooling of the fire and the weakening of the elixir’s power, thus attending to its presence and absence. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, without distinction between day and night, one must remain ever mindful. Only then will the effort become pure, the medicinal materials not dissipate, and the firing times not falter. How can one ever depart from this for even a moment?\n\nThe complexion gradually moistens, the bones and joints grow stronger.\n\nThe complexion gradually moistens and the bones and joints grow ever stronger—this is because the supreme treasure is stored within, and naturally its essence radiates outward. It is like jade in the mountains that moistens the trees, or a pearl in the deep that keeps the cliffs from withering. Only after dispelling all yin and evil can true yang be established. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: “When the host of yin is stripped away and the elixir ripens, one leaps free from the cage to live ten thousand years.”\n\nThe human body, from top to bottom, is nothing but yin’s dross and turbid impurities. The method of immortal cultivation is to generate being from non-being, seizing the one measure of true yang from Heaven and Earth to congeal the elixir’s beginning. Then, day and night, one circulates the fire to refine away yin qi. After ten months of refinement, the embryo is complete; after three years, the work is done. Only then does the body transform into pure yang, the form alchemically transmuted into an immortal.\n\nIf one refines without ceasing, the qi will become like clouds and rain, flowing abundantly as spring moisture, trickling like melting ice from head to foot, then rising again in endless circulation. As the *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* says: “Work the great elixir day and night without rest, and the essence will pierce the crown as the hundred spirits gather above.” After a year of seclusion, practicing night and day without pause, the effects will naturally manifest. Harmonious qi will suffuse the entire body, billowing like mountain clouds ascending into the great void, suffusing like fine rain across the plains, brimming like spring waters filling the four marshes, flowing like river ice on the verge of melting. It circulates up and down, surging through the hundred vessels, filling the valleys within, coursing through the four limbs. The heart is full, brimming with spring’s warmth, and one’s state resembles mild intoxication.\n\nThe *Ruyao Jing* says: “Whether it be precelestial or postcelestial qi, those who attain it are ever as if drunk.” The *Lingguang Ji* says: “Inverted circulation feels like drunkenness, neither sorrowful nor joyful, inwardly preserving true reality—all are the wondrous effects of elixir work.” Ding Lingyang’s *Huiguang Ji* says: “If a single thought is unborn, then naturally within the dantian and sea of qi, the essence of great yin crosses the Weilu acupoint, passes the Jiaji double gates, ascends through Fengfu to Niwan, then descends through the Hall of Light and the bridge of the nose into the Flower Pool, where it transforms into sweet nectar. Swallowed, it irrigates the five viscera and six bowels, reaching the dantian. It flows up and down, filling the four great [elements], circulating endlessly without fail.”\n\nIf one practices only in the morning and abandons it by evening, or if one’s will is not single-minded, how can one progress in this? Reversion is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Reversion means returning repeatedly. The *Daode Jing* says: “Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The ten thousand things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.” The effects of elixir refinement emerge from the utmost emptiness and firm stillness, merging with Heaven and Earth. Only then does primordial qi return with the coming of the one yang. If emptiness is not utmost and stillness not firm, it will be like the mountain with nine measures of earth—one basket short of completion. How can one expect any effect?\n\nWeakness means softness. The *Daode Jing* says: “Concentrate qi to attain softness—can you be like a newborn babe?” The root and handle of elixir refinement lie in holding fast to one’s will without violently expending one’s qi. Only by being as soft and weak as an infant can one succeed. If one’s will is not guarded and qi not nurtured, what little is gained will be lost in an avalanche—what then can serve as the root and handle?\n\nWeed out long-accumulated impurities, and even the finest details will become harmonious and smooth. When all concerns are stilled, the hundred bones are all ordered; when defensive qi dissipates, the Dao’s qi remains. It is like a farmer who must remove weeds: cutting and clearing them to the roots, preventing regrowth, so that the good may flourish. Now, in the immortal’s refinement of the elixir, one weeds out long-accumulated impurities, drives away the demonic corpse, quiets the six senses, and empties the five aggregates within right mindfulness—clear, luminous, empty, and radiant. Only then are the five viscera cool and serene, the six bowels harmonious and at peace, the three hundred sixty joints free of obstruction, and the eighty-four thousand pores all unblocked.\n\nThe path from turbidity to clarity: when dullness lingers, brightness will come. The *Cuixu Pian* says: “When spirit and qi merge in darkness, qi returns—bones and flesh fuse, all unawares.” At this time, the three fields are full of qi, and one feels as if in a drunken dream. Can this not be called dull and turbid? Yet when scholars reach this state, they must not collapse. Know that prolonged dullness will surely give way to clarity, and prolonged turbidity to purity. When the time comes and qi transforms, the nine heavens’ message will scatter the embryo’s membrane. Then the divine water will be deep and clear, the Flower Pool still, white snow will swirl and fly across the four mountains, and the twelve-storied tower of the seven-jeweled pavilion will be visible. All will be bright and distinct, seen within the realm of the indistinct—how could it remain merely dull and turbid?\n\nYet worldly people favor minor arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the correct path for deviant shortcuts, seeking speed but finding no passage—like the blind refusing a staff, or the deaf trying to hear music. They fish for pheasants and hares in water, or seek fish and dragons on mountaintops. They plant wheat hoping for millet, or use a compass to draw a square, exhausting their spirit and strength year after year without result.\n\nThe great Dao of the golden elixir is accomplished through accumulating essence and amassing qi—it cannot be attained in a single leap. A moment forms the embryo, a hundred days establishes the foundation, a year enters seclusion, and three years of refinement and nurturing follow a natural sequence. There is no principle by which one meets a master today and ascends as an immortal tomorrow. Yet how often do worldly scholars, deluded by hearsay, fail to discern the depth of the Dao or distinguish between true and false teachers? They seek quick results, favoring minor arts, knowing one thing but not another, grasping the form but not the function. Confined by partial views, they consider themselves sufficient, even promoting deviant teachings while slandering the true Dao. They distort authentic scriptures to gain the trust of the ignorant, recklessly teaching the deluded and misleading the misguided—such cases are many.\n\nSome clever individuals refuse to humble themselves to seek instruction, instead poring over old texts in hopes of enlightenment—how is this different from the blind refusing a staff? The foolish and ignorant, not understanding the highest principles, force their conjectures to fit the alchemical texts—how is this different from the deaf trying to hear music? Some take the navel as the mysterious pass—this is like fishing for pheasants and hares in water. Others take the two eyes as the Flower Pool—this is like seeking fish and dragons on mountaintops. Still others practice sexual arts hoping for immortality, or sit in stubborn emptiness aspiring to longevity—are these not like planting wheat to harvest millet? Or using a compass to draw a square? All are deluded and unenlightened, wasting their efforts in vain, until their hair turns white in confusion, achieving nothing. What a pity!\n\nTo know the method of ingesting the elixir: it is most concise and unburdensome. The *Thirty-Nine Pointers to the Mysterious* states, \"That which is inwardly luminous comes as the utmost truth; what enters from without is not intimate.\" This means the elixir resides within the body—there is no need to seek it externally. Yet Master Wei speaks of \"ingesting the elixir\"—does this not imply the elixir comes from without and is swallowed through the mouth? The answer is no. The elixir is born within the Kan trigram, forced out by fire, traverses the Three Palaces, descends, and enters the mouth—hence it is called \"ingestion.\" \"Most concise and unburdensome\" refers to the oral instructions, which are supremely simple and easy.\n\nIf it is indeed so simple and easy, then the *Cantong Qi* need not have been written. Why then does it stretch on endlessly, filling scroll after scroll? I have also seen the *Wuzhen Pian*, which says, \"The Great Elixir’s method is supremely simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant may practice it and instantly transcend to the realm of sages.\" Yet it also states, \"Those who refine the golden elixir must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation.\" Why this contradiction? Ah, there is an explanation.\n\nThe dull and ignorant, free from overthinking, readily believe. Once they encounter the method, they follow it directly without hesitation. Though they lack deep understanding, they may still succeed. The wise and learned, however, are broad in knowledge and often beset by doubts. If one point remains unclear, they will seek to exhaust its depths before proceeding. Should they fail to fully grasp the origins of yin, yang, and creation, they may grow skeptical midway. If swayed by heterodox teachings that seem plausible, they may abandon the path, casting aside the shuttle and loom, and declare the true Way false. Thus, the method cannot but be explained in full.\n\nTherefore, though Master Wei may have wished to keep his words unadorned, how could he have done so? The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man, but once it obtains the Golden Flower, it turns and clings, transforming into a white liquid that congeals into utmost hardness. The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is the numinous mercury. The *Song of the Numinous Source of the Great Dao* says, \"This substance has no fixed position; it changes with the times, following the heart’s intent. In the body, when stirred by sensation, it becomes sweat; when the nose meets wind, it becomes mucus; when the kidneys unite, it becomes essence; when the eyes grieve, it becomes tears.\" Thus, it ever seeks to depart from man. The Golden Flower is true lead. When mercury obtains true lead, it turns and clings, naturally neither flying nor fleeing, lingering within and transforming into golden liquid, congealing into utmost hardness.\n\nThe Golden Flower first arises, and in a moment, dissolves into water. The horse’s teeth stand in rows; yang then goes forth to harmonize with nature and temperament. True lead is born in the Kan position, first liquid, then congealing into the Yellow Sprout—hence the metaphor of the horse’s teeth standing in rows. The *Cui Xu Pian* says, \"The elixir’s head is nothing but the primordial qi refined into the Yellow Sprout, giving rise to the Jade Flower.\" Lead is the sovereign; mercury, the minister. Lead moves first, and mercury responds—like a ruler initiating and a minister harmonizing. Lead belongs to metal; mercury, to wood. Wood’s nature loves metal; metal’s essence clings to wood. Yin and yang unite naturally.\n\nWhen the time is pressing, yin is constrained and the gate is sealed. \"When the time is pressing, yin\" refers to the proper moment, when one must swiftly gather the medicine. \"Constraining and sealing the gate\" means returning with the gathered medicine to the furnace for refinement. The *Huanyuan Pian* says, \"One need only align with the celestial mechanism—who knows where the elixir is formed?\" What is aligning with the celestial mechanism? It is pressing the time of yin. What is the place where the elixir is formed? It is constraining and sealing the gate. One must draw near the moment when yin reaches its extreme, welcoming the first stirrings of yang to advance the fire. It must not be overdone, nor should it be insufficient—this is what is meant by \"pressing the time of yin.\" When advancing the fire, urge the hundred vessels to return to the source, penetrate the nine passes to the very end. The sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire are all gathered in the Yellow Palace and refined into the supreme treasure—this is what is meant by \"constraining, storing, and sealing the gate.\" The *Ruyao Jing* says, \"Heaven and earth are stingy with their numinous transformations. Without pressing the time of yin and constraining and sealing the gate, how could one steal their mechanism?\"\n\nThe compassionate mother nurtures; the filial son repays her kindness. They interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another. The stern father issues commands, instructing his descendants. When true lead is born, it is conceived in the womb of the Kun mother—like a compassionate mother’s nurturing. When it flies up to the Qian Palace, captures and restrains true mercury, and unites with it to form the elixir, it then returns to the Kun mother’s womb—this is like the filial son repaying his mother’s kindness, the kind crow returning to feed its parent. Yet without the fierce fire of scorching refinement, true lead cannot take flight—this is why the stern father issues commands to spur it on. The *Yuzhi Shu* says, \"Lead does not fly without fire; mercury does not congeal without lead.\" There are subtle precautions here—how could this be spoken of lightly?\n\nThe five phases intermingle, each in its sovereign position, relying on one another to generate. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal subdues wood, which flourishes. Metal generates water, and wood generates fire—this is the ordinary sequence of the five phases. But in the elixir’s method, wood and fire are companions, and fire in turn generates wood. Metal and water unite, and water in turn generates metal—hence it is said, \"The five phases intermingle, each in its sovereign position, relying on one another to generate.\" \"Fire’s nature melts metal\" means employing the fire of the Li Palace in the south to refine the metal within the water of the Kan Palace in the north. \"Metal subdues wood, which flourishes\" means employing the metal within the water of the Kan Palace in the north to restrain the wood within the fire of the Li Palace in the south.\n\nThe Three and the Five unite as one—the utmost essence of heaven and earth. This can be transmitted orally but is difficult to convey in writing. The Three refers to water (one) and fire (two), combining to form three. The Five is earth. \"The Three and the Five unite as one\" means water, fire, and earth intermingle and fuse into a single qi. At this time, the mysterious yellow is intermingled, and the clear and turbid are not yet separated—like the primordial chaos of heaven and earth. Soon, the time arrives, and qi transforms from nothing into something. In the profound darkness, something indistinct arises; in the indistinctness, something hazy forms. It coalesces into a mass, and within it, the utmost essence of heaven and earth is conceived. Qutu Shenhe said, \"If you understand the Three and the Five as one, you may become an earth-treading immortal.\" Its wonders must be transmitted orally, heart to heart—difficult to fully express in writing.\n\nThe child turns to the right; noon then revolves to the east. Mao and You divide the boundaries, giving rise to the names of host and guest. \"The child turns to the right\" means moving from the west to the Zi position, where the tiger is born within water.\n\nThe noon then revolves to the east—this means moving from the east to the noon position, where the dragon emerges from within fire. Zi and Wu are south and north; south and north are water and fire. Mao and You are east and west; east and west are metal and wood. Turning right and revolving left, one conceals and one arises, so that water and fire interact while metal and wood remain unobstructed.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* states:\n*\"The jade rabbit’s wheel and golden rooster’s path—*\n*the Way resides within the human body,*\n*yet people themselves are deluded.*\n*All know how to regulate water and fire,*\n*but how many recognize east and west?\"*\n\nFor east and west, along with Mao and You, are but alternate names for metal and wood—they are neither celestial directions nor the left and right of the human body. Yet one must not seek them outside oneself.\n\nAlas! In recent times, many in the world don robes and feign Dao, yet when asked what metal and wood are, they fall silent as if struck dumb. Unless they encounter a true master’s direct instruction, they merely speculate in vain and never truly comprehend.\n\nThe dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence—both devour each other, each coveting the other. The dragon is the Li dragon of the south; the tiger is the Kan tiger of the north. When refining\n\nJust as the autumn cicada drinks the wind, the rhinoceros gazes at the stars, the aged clam holds the moon in its mouth, the unyielding stone harbors jade within, the butterfly’s wings open and close, the firefly’s flame brightens and dims, the cat’s pupils expand and contract, the deer’s tail moves in reverse, the *qi* breathes in and out, the turtle shoots its shadow, the windbag puffs the breeze, the water droplet draws in moisture, the lodestone attracts the needle, amber gathers the mustard seed, the well-sweep and windlass draw water, sweet flag and rice blossoms condense dew, the snake enters hibernation, the fish dwells in water, the dung beetle rolls its ball, the wasp enchants its young, the hen broods over her eggs, the rabbit carries her embryo, the ox bears its yellow, the dragon possesses its pearl, the plum pit grows its kernel, the lotus fruit sheds its stem—along with the spring wind’s mechanism in the plantain, the autumn rain’s secret in the paulownia, the night moon’s reflection in the emerald pool, and the evening clouds over the blue mountains—all are but emblems of the Golden Elixir’s method.\n\nZhang Ziyang said: *\"One who refines the Golden Elixir must thoroughly understand yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation—how could this not be true?\"*\n\nThe Five Phases overcome one another, becoming father and mother in turn. The mother contains the nourishing fluids; the father governs the bestowal of essence. In the essential method of the Elixir, nothing surpasses this.\n\nThe marvel of the Five Phases lies nowhere more profoundly than in Kan and Li. Kan is Water, where Metal and Water unite, and within Water resides Metal. Li is Fire, where Water and Fire become companions, and within Fire resides Wood. These form the Four Symbols. When Kan receives Wu Earth and Li receives Ji Earth, they complete the Five Phases. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"The Zhen Dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li region; the Dui Tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction. These two substances are both produced by the child giving birth to the mother.\"* It further says: *\"If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the Four Symbols, they cannot form the Elixir. Only because each holds true Earth within does the Golden Elixir achieve its return and restoration.\"* This makes the principle clear.\n\nIn the Elixir’s method, Fire refines Metal, and Metal subdues Wood. When Fire flourishes, Water tempers it; when Water surges, Earth restrains it—this is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases. Metal generates Water, and Water is Metal’s child, yet within Water, Metal is born. Wood generates Fire, and Fire is Wood’s child, yet within Water, Wood is born—this is their alternating roles as father and mother. The father is like Heaven; the mother is like Earth. Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth receives it, accomplishing the work of generation and nurturance. Thus it is said: *\"The mother contains the nourishing fluids; the father governs the bestowal of essence.\"* The *Chilong Dadan Jue* states: *\"The marvel lies in Heaven’s intercourse with Earth, enabling return and restoration.\"* The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"Father’s essence and mother’s blood coalesce to form the embryo, resembling another’s form yet akin to my own. Only by recognizing the true father and mother within can one grasp the essence of the Five Phases.\"*\n\nCultivators who refine the Elixir must unite their own Heaven with their own Earth, gathering their own Five Phases within. There, they mutually consume, defend, and yet remain intimate, suddenly realizing that within the void, conception occurs, and the Sacred Embryo is formed. When essence congeals and form flows, even metal and stone do not decay. The essence of the Five Phases solidifies between Heaven and Earth, becoming metal or stone, enduring for millennia without corruption. If one turns inward to seek it, condensing the essence of one’s own Five Phases into a treasure, it will endure as long as Heaven and Earth—how could mere metal or stone compare?\n\n**Scrutinize focus, avoid leakage, and attain the true Dao.**\n\"Focus\" means severing worldly affairs and dedicating oneself wholly to refinement, with single-minded devotion. \"Avoid leakage\" means maintaining silence like a hen brooding her eggs, keeping the spirit within the body’s cavity at all times. By doing so, the work remains pure, the medicine does not dissipate, the fire’s power is uninterrupted, and the Dao is achieved. Those deluded by inferior arts believe that pressing the perineum to restrain lustful impulses and engaging in sensory union constitutes \"avoiding leakage.\" They do not realize that though the essence may not leak, the spirit and qi have already departed, leaving only stagnant, turbid residue to accumulate in the waist, breeding strange ailments. How utterly benighted! As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *\"Those who do not sever lust and practice dhyāna are like one who steams sand, hoping to make rice. Even after a hundred thousand kalpas, it remains only hot sand.\"* How much more so for the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, which unites both nature and life—what then should be done? The *Cuixu Pian* warns: *\"If you wish to prolong life and rescue old age, sever lust and abandon heterodox paths. Only by refining the Spirit-Elixir can you preserve form and dwell forever in the world.\"* Let scholars ponder this carefully.\n\n**Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into the valley and hear its echo—how can this not be wondrous? These are the supreme images of Heaven and Earth.**\nErect a pole, and its shadow appears; call into the valley, and its echo responds—there has never been a stimulus without a response. Thus, the sun and moon hang in the sky: when one seeks fire, fire is born; when one seeks water, water arrives. The resonance is swift—how can this not be supremely wondrous? Yet though all under Heaven see it, none truly understand. The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"The sun’s crow and moon’s hare, two perfect wheels—rooted in the Prior Heaven. To gather them is difficult; gaze at the moonlit night and seize the moment.\"* If scholars can steal Heaven and Earth’s mechanism on the night when the sun and moon face each other, uniting their own sun and moon at the center, then the inner truth will resonate with the outer, and the Elixir will naturally harmonize. Eventually, the sun and moon will be refined.\n\nIf one ingests a mere inch of *Gelsemium* or a single *Croton* seed, one will collapse instantly, unable to bend or rise. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, none could revive the fallen or restore their movement. *Gelsemium* and *Croton* are the most toxic of herbs. Ingesting an inch of *Gelsemium* or a single *Croton* seed causes immediate collapse, and even if King Wen, Confucius, Bian Que, or Wu Xian were present to cast stalks, interpret omens, wield needles, or beat drums, they could not restore life. Yet today, people believe that poisonous herbs can swiftly kill but do not believe that the Spirit-Elixir can grant longevity. How can their lack of reflection be so extreme?\n\nThe River Maiden is numinous and most divine; at the sight of fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust or shadow. The hidden dragon conceals itself, its whereabouts unknown. To subdue her, the Yellow Sprout must serve as the root. True mercury is born in Li. Li is the feminine, residing in Wu; by the division of celestial stems, Wu corresponds to the Three Rivers, hence she is called the River Maiden. Tracing her origin, she arises from emptying the heart and congealing the spirit—truly emerging from within the heart. Thus, she is called numinous mercury or divine mercury. Her nature is fierce and violent; at the sight of fire, she flees without a trace, like a hidden dragon vanishing without a clue. Without the Yellow Sprout as her root, how could she be restrained? The Yellow Sprout is true lead. When mercury obtains true lead, they capture, restrain, and unite, preventing her flight—this is why it serves as the root of the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and defy their origin.**\nA hen lays eggs and hatches chicks, yet not all are complete—why? Because the union was not consummated, the Three and Five did not merge, and hardness and softness remained apart. The Dao is called the union of one yin and one yang; an excess of yin or yang is called illness. For example, a hen that lays eggs without a rooster will surely produce none—why? Because solitary yang does not generate, and solitary yin does not complete. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Do not mistake solitary yin for yang; refining a single substance only weakens the body. Stretching and guiding are not the Dao; refining qi and consuming mist are madness. The world vainly seeks to subdue mercury and lead—when will they see the tiger and dragon descend? I urge you to thoroughly seek the place of your birth, return to the root, and restore the source—this is the King of Medicines.\"* If one can turn the light inward and reflect, uniting one’s own yin and yang within, then hardness and softness will pair, the Three and Five will merge as one—why seek elsewhere? The *Huanyuan Pian* says: *\"Harmonize yin and yang within yourself.\"* The *Yuzhi Shu* states: *\"Yin and yang are not to be sought in other things.\"* The *Huandan Pian* declares: *\"Yin and yang must be gathered from one’s own truth.\"* How could one seek them outside the body?\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* states: *\"Better to seek a master’s peaceful method than to accumulate and consume essence and blood.\"* As the ancients say: *\"All under heaven returns—one must study the art of non-action and purity.\"* For the Golden Elixir is none other than the Dao of purity and non-action.\n\nSome, deluded by perverse teachings, believe the Golden Elixir must involve women—how gravely mistaken they are! The way of transformation in heaven and earth is natural: fire moves upward in flames, water flows downward to moisten—no master guides them to do so. The origin of all things, the governance of the cosmos, cannot be altered. The transformations of heaven and earth, the flaming of fire and moistening of water—are these the work of human effort? They arise spontaneously, of themselves.\n\nWithin our own bodies, heaven and earth exist; water and fire reside there as well. Their transformations, their flaming and moistening—are these the work of human effort? They, too, arise spontaneously, of themselves. The *Zhixuan Pian* says: *\"One must know the meeting of east and west; the path lies in the central harmony of the upper and lower fields.\"* The human body models heaven and earth: the head is heaven, the abdomen is earth. Simply guard the spirit within, neither forgetting nor forcing; regulate the breath through the nose, neither indulging nor restraining. Naturally, there will be opening and closing, receiving and bestowing—no different from the transformative way of heaven and earth.\n\nWhen the time arrives and qi stirs, the mechanism moves, the phoenix cries—then fire arises from below the navel, water is born within the crown. Its wonder unfolds without anticipation, of itself. It is not attained through laboring the spirit or exerting force. This Dao is heaven’s creation, earth’s design—fixed and unalterable.\n\nLord Wei feared that learners might not grasp the yin and yang within the body, the upper and lower realms—thus he drew analogies to heaven and earth’s transformative processes, to the blazing and moistening of water and fire. His explanation was indeed thorough and lucid.\n\nObserve the moment of union between male and female: hard and soft intertwine, inseparable, attaining their rhythmic harmony—not through artifice or control. The *Quanzhen Collection* states: *\"Qi harmonized, spirit settled, the breath conjoins.\"* The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"Like husband and wife in union, a single guard of essence and blood forms the infant.\"* This so-called union in the golden elixir is an inner resonance of yin and yang, a merging of spirit and qi—termed \"male and female\" or \"husband and wife\" as metaphors.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* states: *\"When spirit and qi return to the root, body and mind revert to life’s mandate.\"* Such true apertures are known by few. When spirit enters qi and qi unites with spirit, attaining their rhythmic harmony, there arises the state of hard and soft intertwined, inseparable—yet no artifice or control is employed. One merely witnesses its thusness, yet knows not how it comes to be thus. Wondrous! Wondrous indeed!\n\nWhen a male is born, he lies prone; when a female is born, she lies supine—this posture is received at the very inception of qi in the womb, not merely observed at birth. Even in death, they revert to the same. This is not taught by parents; it is predetermined at the moment of union.\n\nChu Huagu’s *Qu Yi Shuo* states: *\"Opening qi makes a male; closing qi makes a female. One opening, one closing—thus male and female are distinguished.\"* Li Yuxi’s commentary on the *Xinyin Jing* says: *\"Male and female receive the same endowment; only the sequence of their union determines yin and yang.\"* Yang qi gathers at the front, so a man’s face is heavier—at birth, he must lie prone. Yin qi gathers at the back, so a woman’s back is heavier—at birth, she must lie supine. This is not only true at birth but also at death. Thus, a man who drowns lies prone; a woman who drowns lies supine. Even beasts that drown do the same. This is not taught by parents; it is fixed from the moment of receiving qi—one opening, one closing, one preceding, one following.\n\nNow, why does Lord Wei expound the Dao of clarity and stillness and yet speak of the prone and supine postures of men and women? There is no other reason: he wishes learners to thoroughly understand the yin and yang, the upper and lower within their own bodies, and to comprehend the natural principles of creation.\n\nThe *Kan* male is the moon; the *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue—this is the husband’s Dao. The moon unfurls its light—this is the wife’s Dao. Yet if the moon is *Kan* male, then the wife becomes the husband; if the sun is *Li* female, then the husband becomes the wife. This is the inversion.\n\nYet how does the sun transform and the moon change without harm to their bodies? It is through the mutual support of yin and yang. The eclipses of the sun and moon occur at their conjunctions. At the full moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed. Thus, eclipses occur at new and full moons—yet not every conjunction brings an eclipse. When they intersect, there is an eclipse; when they do not, there is none.\n\nNow, Lord Wei cites the sun and moon as metaphors for the elixir path, earnestly emphasizing the waxing and waning, the encroachments and obscurations. His intent is profound. Should learners not turn their light inward, seek the sun and moon within their own bodies, and inquire into the waxing and waning within themselves?\n\nThe *Shangqing Collection* states: *\"Watching the Dipper’s handle revolve through the heavens, one suddenly awakens to the wondrous secret of immortality. In an instant, true yang is born in the *Kan* position, guarding the deficiency in the *Li* palace. Since ancient times, *Qian* and *Kun* have never ceased their interplay of *Li* and *Kan*, day after day. On this year’s winter solstice, plum blossoms still congeal like snow. The ancient sages closed their gates on this day, allowing no comings or goings—all for the sake of living beings. Every creature embodies the intent of generation and nurturance. At the cusp of *zi* and *hai*, creation moves silently; fire arises in water—its wonder lies in the *Xu-Wei* cavity. Now that you’ve seen through this, the golden crow flies into the toad’s cave.\"* Such direct revelation of heaven’s mechanism, such clear exposition of the Dao’s essentials, amply confirms Lord Wei’s words—luminous and unerring!\n\nMale and female depend on each other, exhaling and inhaling to nourish; yin and yang intermingle, seeking one another.\n\nWithin the body, male and female, yin and yang are but two aspects of the self. When these two qi intermingle and harmonize, they naturally exhale and inhale, intertwining to form the embryo. The *Shangqing Ji* states: \"Within one’s own body lies a husband and wife.\" To speak thus to the uninitiated would surely invite ridicule—such is the Way. The seeker must pursue it through clarity, stillness, and non-action, not through perverse interpretations.\n\nMetal transforms into water, and the nature of water flows boundlessly. Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot course freely. Metal is born in the *Kan* palace, its qi alone. For metal transforms into water, and when the true fire of the great yang lies concealed and steams beneath, it melts and becomes water. The nature of water flows abundantly—who can resist it? Yet when the fire’s power reaches its zenith, it transforms again into earth. Fire becomes earth, and earth restrains water; when water encounters earth, it halts—thus it cannot flow.\n\nTherefore, the male moves and emits outward, while the female remains still and conceals within. If the overflow exceeds measure, the female constrains it, the *po* restraining the *hun*, preventing excess. The *Ruyao Jing* states: \"Water can flow, fire can flame\"—within the body, this can be verified. Thus, in harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir, one must not exceed measure. Now, *Kan* as male moves and emits outward, while *Li* as female remains still and conceals within. Should the emission exceed measure, *Li* as female will constrain and restrain it, so that *hun* and *po* mutually check each other and do not fall into excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony, and both exhale in mutual confirmation.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work—neither too swift nor too slow, but seeking only balance and union. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"When firm and yielding meet, qi evens out—its wonder lies in avoiding harm.\" The *Dui* and *Zhen* trigrams hold harmony as their essence.\n\nCinnabar is the essence of wood, and only when united with metal do they merge. Yuan Yangzi’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: \"To know cinnabar as the essence of wood, move it to the west to join with metal.\" For mercury’s nature is to fly and flee, most difficult to subdue; only when cast into the lead crucible and united with lead does it cease to fly or flee.\n\nWhere metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions. These four, in primordial chaos, array as dragon and tiger. The dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. Heaven-one generates water, its position in the north, its symbol the Dark Warrior. Earth-two generates fire, its position in the south, its symbol the Vermilion Bird. Heaven-three generates wood, its position in the east, its symbol the Azure Dragon. Earth-four generates metal, its position in the west, its symbol the White Tiger. These four each dwell in their quadrant, each forming a symbol, originally unrelated.\n\nYet now it is said: \"Where metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions.\" The yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace, while the yin tiger returns from the *Kan* position. Since each forms a symbol, they should be collectively called the Four Symbols. Yet here, only dragon and tiger are mentioned, omitting the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior—why? North and south form the warp, east and west the weft.\n\nThe phrase \"where metal and water unite\" refers to the metal of the west-four White Tiger descending into water. \"Wood and fire become companions\" refers to the wood of the east-three Azure Dragon ascending into fire. Thus, metal is not in the west but unites with water in the north, and wood is not in the east but becomes fire’s companion in the south. The White Tiger transforms into the Black Tiger, the Azure Dragon into the Red Dragon.\n\nWhen metal, water, wood, and fire—these four—converge as one, they are a primal chaos like the undivided Great Ultimate. When arrayed as two, *Zhen*’s dragon-mercury emerges from *Li*’s homeland, and *Dui*’s tiger-lead is born in *Kan*’s domain. Zhang Ziyang deeply grasped this secret and thus encapsulated it in a single phrase: \"The Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies.\" Later scholars, unaware of what the Four Symbols truly are, mistakenly identify them as the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue, or as the liver and lungs as dragon and tiger. With such misguided recognition, their understanding diverges further—how could they grasp the wonder that the Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies?\n\nThe liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother. The heart, red, is the daughter; the spleen, yellow, the ancestor. The kidneys, black, are the child—the child is the beginning of the Five Phases. The qi of the day arises at *zi*, born in the kidneys, then transmits to the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs. Yet though the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are five, they are called the Three Substances—why? When metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions, and together with the central *wu-ji* earth, they form three. For the Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth; without *wu-ji*, the elixir cannot form. This is why the Three Substances, one family, all return to *wu-ji*.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder—all are empty houses, old fences. Saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—these can only assist as stepping stones.\" It speaks of the golden elixir as the wondrous Dao of something born from nothing, not a thing of form or substance. Yet now Lord Wei speaks of the Five Viscera—why? It is not that the Five Viscera are used, but that they are borrowed to illustrate the Five Phases. The liver, green, and lungs, white, represent metal and wood; the heart, red, and kidneys, black, represent water and fire. Metal generates water, wood generates fire, so the liver and lungs are likened to father and mother, the heart and kidneys to child and daughter. Yet metal and wood both arise from earth, so the spleen is likened to the ancestor.\n\nIf the kidneys are the child, why are they called the beginning of the Five Phases? The kidneys belong to water, and water’s number is one. The qi of the day arises at *zi*, born in the kidneys, then transmits to the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs.\n\nFirm and yielding alternate in ascent, traversing the divisions in turn. Dragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*. Punishment and virtue converge, meeting in joy. Punishment governs killing and subjugation; virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm dies as the *Kui* star descends upon *mao*. In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star occupies *you*. *Zi* to the south, *wu* to the north—these mutually form the warp and weft.\n\n\"Firm and yielding alternate in ascent\" refers to the two qi mutually aiding and revolving. \"Traversing the divisions in turn\" means circulating through the celestial stems. \"Dragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*, punishment and virtue converging, meeting in joy\" describes the weft in motion, *mao* and *you* joining, metal and wood uninterrupted. \"Punishment governs killing and subjugation\" is like the autumn qi, stern and killing, gathering all things inward. \"Virtue governs generation and ascent\" is like the spring qi, flourishing and generating, bringing all things forth.\n\n\"In the second month, the elm dies as the *Kui* star descends upon *mao*\"—in the second month, *mao* is established, and the monthly general is *He Kui*. *He Kui* belongs to *xu*, and within *xu* lies *xin*; the elm dies in this month because the killing qi of *xin* metal descends upon *mao*. \"In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star occupies *you*\"—in the eighth month, *you* is established, and the monthly general is *Tian Gang*. *Tian Gang* belongs to *chen*, and within *chen* lies *yi*; wheat sprouts in this month because the generating qi of *yi* wood occupies *you*.\n\nThe \"north-south axis\" and \"east-west weft\" mutually serve as their guiding principles: when the sun traverses the Western Continent, it is called spring, and in the second month at *mao*, the Western Continent lies in the northeast while the Southern Continent lies in the south; when the sun traverses the Eastern Continent, it is called autumn, and in the eighth month at *you*, the Eastern Continent lies in the southwest while the Northern Continent lies in the north.\n\nNow, the north and south form the warp of Heaven and Earth, while the east and west form their weft. When the *ding*-cauldron’s *kui* and *gang* rotate once, the dragon flees west and the tiger flees east; *zi* lies in the south and *wu* in the north—this transformation in the second and eighth months at *mao* and *you* is no different. Thus, the *Wuzhen Pian* speaks of \"the months of the hare and rooster,\" for when their time arrives, punishment and virtue descend upon the gate—this is the image of the elixir.\n\n\"Image\" means \"to resemble this.\" Master Wei set forth this image to instruct others, and its principle is entirely self-evident. Yet why do those who cling to the text and adhere rigidly to the image often confine their search to the page, never turning inward to seek within themselves? Thus, they lead one another astray without end, unaware that what Master Wei called \"the dragon in the west, the tiger in the east, *zi* in the south, and *wu* in the north\" is nothing other than the Heaven and Earth within our own bodies, reversed.\n\nIf one can awaken to the marvel of Heaven and Earth reversed within the self, then the reason the east and west establish the weft, and the north and south mutually serve as the guiding warp, can all be silently comprehended in their workings. What need is there to seek outwardly in vain?\n\nThe number one through nine completes and begins anew. This \"one through nine\" is the same as the arrangement of \"nine above, one below.\" Its completion and renewal mean moving from one to nine, then from nine back to one, circulating endlessly between above and below. \"Containing the Origin in *Xu* and *Wei*, sowing essence at *Zi*\": *Xu* and *Wei* refer to the sun’s arrival at these lunar mansions, where night after night the primordial *qi* takes form. \"Sowing essence at *Zi*\" means that at the *Zi* hour, *qi* reaches the *Weilu* Pass, and true essence is born here.\n\nThe marvel of the Golden Elixir lies in containing the Origin in the precelestial and sowing essence in the postcelestial. What is the precelestial? It is the state of profound stillness, the time before the Supreme Ultimate divides—subtle and indistinct. What is the postcelestial? It is the state of responsive movement, the time after the Supreme Ultimate divides—vague and elusive. The precelestial is but a single *qi*; only in the postcelestial does it transform into true essence.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Half a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead, produced before the Supreme Ultimate in emptiness and nonbeing. One must hasten to the *Zi* hour to gather them, refine them into golden liquid, and return them to the Elixir Field.\" This is indeed correct. For *Xu* and *Wei* lie between *Hai* and *Zi*, the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir. The *Zi* hour is where the first yang moves. Beyond this point, the path of mother and child divides in the womb. The mystery lies in the *Wei*, *Ji*, *Niu*, *Dou*, and *Nü* lunar mansions. Without profound understanding of the yin and yang within one’s body and deep penetration of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations, who could grasp this?\n\n*\"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the islet in the river. The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady: for our prince a good mate.\"* The male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude. The dark warrior and the coiled serpent support each other, illustrating how the female and male must mutually depend. If two women share a chamber, their beauty may be exquisite, and even if Su Qin were to mediate or Zhang Yi to propose, deploying eloquent words and persuasive arguments to urge harmony, they could never become husband and wife. Their hair would rot and their teeth decay before they ever knew union. Just as medicinal substances must be of the same kind and their proportions precise, if the ingredients are not of the proper species or their measurements disordered, even if the Yellow Emperor were to tend the furnace, Tai Yi to hold the fire, the Eight Lords to pound and refine, or Huainan to blend and harmonize—even if they built a towering altar with jade steps, offered unicorn flesh and phoenix jerky, held registers and knelt in prayer, or entreated the spirits with solemn vows after fasting and ablutions—any hopes would be in vain. It would be like using glue to mend a broken cauldron or sal ammoniac to treat a festering sore, like adding ice to dispel cold or boiling water to remove scalds, like making a flying *kui* dance or a writhing snake perform—only to see things grow more perverse.\n\nThe Great Way of the Golden Elixir is simply the interplay of one yin and one yang. This principle applies to human affairs and the patterns of all things. Now, Master Wei draws on the *Guan Ju* ode’s imagery of the virtuous maiden matched with the prince to illustrate the union of male and female within the body, and on the dark warrior and coiled serpent to illustrate the mutual dependence of female and male within. This may be called a broad analogy with meticulous comparisons, leaving nothing unaddressed.\n\nMoreover, when the *Dui* maiden and *Gen* youth respond to each other above and below, it is called *Xian*. When the *Li* and *Dui* maidens dwell together but their aspirations differ, it is called *Kui*. This clarifies that yin and yang must complement each other and cannot be one-sided.\n\nAs for the work of the furnace and fire, yin and yang must also be balanced. If the medicinal substances are not of the proper kind or their proportions disordered, even if the Yellow Emperor were to tend the furnace, Tai Yi to hold the fire, the Eight Lords to pound and refine, or Huainan to blend and harmonize—even if they built an altar of gold and jade, offered unicorn and phoenix, fasted and bathed, held registers and knelt in prayer, or presented blue petitions and red memorials to the spirits above and below—all would be a waste of time and effort, laboring in vain. It would be like using glue to mend a broken cauldron, sal ammoniac to treat a festering sore, ice to dispel cold, or boiling water to remove scalds, like making a flying *kui* dance or a writhing snake perform—only to see things grow more perverse.\n\nSome may misinterpret the saying \"the male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude\" to mean that one must use a woman in elixir refinement, thus falling into the error of \"solitary yang.\" They then cite this passage to justify their perverse theories, while mocking the true Way as impractical and pedantic. Such people clearly overestimate their own understanding.\n\n*Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Middle\n*Section: Masters, Daoist Works, Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*\n\nFrom the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* by Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty, Scroll Lower:\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True. \"Seeing nothing, hearing nothing, embracing the spirit in stillness\"—this was the embrace of the Mysterious and True by Guangchengzi. \"Concentrating qi to attain suppleness, able to be like an infant\"—this was the embrace of the Mysterious and True by Laozi. Then there were Nüwa, who smelted the five-colored stones to mend the heavens; Ranshi, who attained the center of the ring and followed its completion; and the cinnabar methods of Lie Yukou, the clerk of Qiyuan. Let no scholar say that only those with innate immortal bones may seek the Way. With resolve, none is beyond attainment. What were the sages but men? What am I but a man? Those who act may do likewise.\n\nThe aspirant of the Dao, if truly able to rouse a courageous heart, exert diligent effort, and practice unceasingly day and night, will find that when the time comes, qi transforms of itself, and as water flows, channels form of themselves. What then is there to fear in the failure of stubborn stones to soften or iron pestles to become needles?\n\nYet one may study without encounter, encounter without attainment, or even attain the true formula yet fail to preserve it. To work at dawn and desire results by dusk, to sit in practice and expect effects by standing—this is to seek the profit of a ladle before the strength of a bushel is firm, or to incur the cost of a thousand stones while the foundation remains shallow, only to suffer the alternating assaults of frost and ice. In such cases, even if Guangchengzi or Laozi were one’s teacher, and Liezi or Zhuangzi one’s companions, what could they do?\n\nAlas! The *Gold and Jade Collection* of Ma Danyang states: \"Refining qi is one’s livelihood, nurturing spirit one’s daily practice. Keep dragon and tiger harmonized, lest horse and monkey play.\" It also says: \"Observe the great Dao of heaven’s movements, silently attain the union of Qian and Kun. The oral transmission of the original master holds the greatest merit in non-action.\" For the ancients who refined the elixir, not a single thought arose, and all dharmas were forgotten. In utter clarity and stillness, they followed only the Dao. Within quiescent concentration, they embraced the qi of harmonious emptiness. Their exhalations were faint, their inhalations continuous, rising to the Mud Pill and descending to the Gate of Life, circulating without cease. Spirit and qi never parted for even a moment. When the inner elixir neared completion, primordial qi naturally abided in the cinnabar field, governing as one with heaven and earth.\n\nFormerly, the Yellow Emperor retired to the Hall of Great Courtyard for three months, practicing inner contemplation—this was the very Dao. This Dao is most simple and most easy. Within the twelve hours of a day, if the heart constantly guides qi, qi unites with spirit, and form endures forever, revolving with the sun and moon, turning with the River of Heaven. Endless turning, boundless longevity.\n\nThe *Mysterious Chapter* states: \"If only each breath attends to the other, the jade liquid will flow, transforming the entire bodily frame.\" Such is its meaning. If one exhales without the spirit’s governance, a single breath is incomplete; if one inhales without the spirit’s governance, a single breath is likewise incomplete. The key lies in heart and breath constantly depending on each other, spirit and qi constantly guarding each other, thoughts continuously linked, forged into one. Only then are form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* says: \"Spirit is nature, qi is life. When spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles.\" The *Anthology of Immortal Joys* states: \"When qi and spirit meet, nature abides and life is stabilized.\" Truly, they must not be separated even for an instant.\n\nOrdinary people are not so. Though qi breathes within, the spirit is ever ensnared by external affairs. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, not a single breath rests within the body. Thus, spirit and qi each follow their own course without mutual guardianship. Eventually, the dwelling becomes empty, walls crumble, and the master cannot sustain himself. Is this the doing of heaven and earth’s destruction, or the harm of demonic spirits? No—it is the loss of the Dao and self-departure.\n\nThe *Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao* by Shi Qizhen states: \"What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within. What is inhaled is heaven and earth’s true qi, entering from without. If one’s root is firm and primordial qi undiminished, then even in breathing, one may seize heaven and earth’s true qi. But if the root is unsteady, essence exhausted, and qi weakened—above, primordial qi leaks away; below, the original palace is unfortified. The true qi of heaven and earth, inhaled, follows the exhalation outward, and the body’s primordial qi ceases to belong to oneself, instead being seized by heaven and earth.\" Thus, immortals often say: \"Refinement must be timely. Once the crucible is ruined, there is no remedy.\"\n\nSu Ziyou, in his later years, inquired of the immortal nun Zheng about the art of nourishing life. She replied: \"Your vessel is ruined. The Dao is difficult to attain.\" For the medicinal ingredients, early cultivation is precious. If one practices only in old age, essence will be depleted, qi exhausted, lead withered, and mercury scarce. Even with effort, one may only prolong life in peace—nothing more.\n\nThe *Emerald Writ* states: \"It is all clear in a few words: the paths of youth and age differ in ease and difficulty.\" This is its meaning.\n\nSome may ask: Lü Chunyang began to hear the Dao at fifty; Ma Ziran and Liu Langran both attained the Dao after sixty-four. Why is this? The answer: \"A ruined house is easy to repair; withered medicine is not hard to revive. Only know the method of return. Gold and treasure may pile like mountains—yet what of one’s daily cultivation?\"\n\nRefining the Nine Cauldrons, one’s traces vanish into seclusion. The Nine Cauldrons refer to the nine revolutions of the fire phase. When the fire phase’s number is complete, transformations occur, and traces disappear. One roams freely between heaven and earth, riding the void. As Lü Chunyang’s *Song of the Kiln’s Ruin* says: \"Nine years of fire phase have passed. Suddenly, the Heavenly Gate atop the head breaks open. The true person appears, and great spiritual powers manifest. From this, heavenly immortals come to offer congratulations.\" Such is its meaning.\n\nContaining essence and nurturing spirit, one communicates with the virtue of the Three Origins. The Three Origins are the three fields: upper, middle, and lower. With long containment and deep effort, spirit and essence are stored within, harmonious qi fills the entire body, and the hundred bones and myriad orifices are all pervaded. Naturally, it is like the turning of the River of Heaven. The *Precious Chapter of Primordial Unity* states: \"With years of practice, no effort is needed. The fire wheel and water axle turn of themselves.\" Such is it.\n\nWhat is meant by \"containing essence and nurturing spirit\"? Externally, one does not toil the bodily frame; internally, one does not labor the heart and will. For if spirit is overused, it tires; if essence is overused, it depletes. Day after day, it is whittled away until one rots with the grasses and trees—is this not deeply lamentable?\n\nThus, those who refine the elixir empty the heart, forget the form, guard the One, and embrace the numinous. Only then can they secure essence, preserve qi, and perfect spirit. When the three fields are full of essence and the five viscera brim with qi, only then is the elixir complete.\n\nThe *Transformation Book* of Tan Jingsheng states: \"Sorrow brings tears like rain; bitterness brings mucus like rain. Rage forms goiters; anger forms abscesses. Where the heart desires, qi follows—nothing is not nurtured. If one errs here, one must err there.\" Therefore, the great person restrains sorrow and bitterness, cautions against rage and anger, attains the gate of vast qi, and gathers the root. Knowing the bag of original spirit, one veils its light. Like the clam’s inner guarding, like the stone’s inner concealment—this is the chamber of pearls and jade. Truly, it is the ultimate discourse.\n\nWhen essence overflows the interstices of skin and sinews, bones become firm. The interstices lie between skin and flesh. Through cultivation, when essence overflows the interstices, blood transforms entirely into marrow-fat. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Now the whole body is white blood, and one feels no cold through the four seasons.\" Truly, no practice surpasses filling the brain, for the brain is the sea of marrow. When the brain’s marrow is full, pure yang flows and overflows, filling all marrow. Only then are bones solid and sinews firm, forever free from the worries of cold and heat.\n\nAll perverse influences are dispelled, and upright qi abides. That by which humans cultivate and attain longevity is their ability to steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth. That by which humans steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth is their breath. Exhalation reaches the root; inhalation reaches the stem—thus they steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth and return it to the cinnabar field. Human breath is like the breath of Heaven and Earth. The *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: \"After the winter solstice is exhalation; after the summer solstice is inhalation.\" This is the yearly breath of Heaven and Earth. Zhang Guanwu’s commentary says: \"After the winter solstice, yang grows and yin wanes, unfolding the myriad things—hence exhalation. After the summer solstice, yin grows and yang wanes, gathering the myriad things—hence inhalation.\" If speaking of a single day, then after midnight is exhalation, and after noon is inhalation. One year of Heaven is but a single breath of humankind. Thus, the number of one cosmic cycle—129,600 years—is but a single year in the great transformation. Now, in speaking of the Dao of the elixir: in one day, there are 13,500 exhalations and 13,500 inhalations. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. In the space of one breath, one subtly seizes the workings of 13,500 years of celestial motion. In one year of 360 days, there are 4,860,000 breaths, subtly seizing 4,860,000 years of celestial motion. Thereby, the foul and turbid body is entirely exchanged, transformed into a body of pure yang. First, the qi is changed; next, the blood; next, the vessels; next, the flesh; next, the marrow; next, the sinews; next, the bones; next, the hair; next, the form. After nine years and nine transformations, yin is exhausted and yang is pure, and one’s years equal those of Heaven and Earth—this is the Dao of longevity and transcendence.\n\nNow, when Master Wei says, \"All perverse influences are dispelled, and upright qi abides,\" he means that by circulating the fire day and night, one refines away all yin qi, transforming it into pure yang, so that upright qi abides and one attains longevity. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"The body permeated with golden light, the marrow fragrant; golden sinews and jade bones—all pure yang. Refine until the red blood flows white, yin qi dissolved, and the body is naturally sound.\" For pure yang is the immortal, pure yin the demon, and half yin and half yang the human. If one can refine yang to dissolve yin, one may become an immortal of pure yang. If even a trace of yin qi remains unrefined, one cannot be called pure yang.\n\nThrough long and gradual accumulation, the form is transformed, and one becomes an immortal. Great indeed!\n\nAlas! The method of the Dao of the Elixir is modeled on Heaven. How arduous! The ceaseless practice of elixir-work. Why say so? The *Yin Fu Jing* states: \"Observe the Way of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven—this is all.\" That by which Heaven is long and enduring is its ceaseless movement day and night. If one can observe the Way of Heaven and turn inward to seek it within oneself, emulating Heaven’s ceaseless movement day and night, then the Way of long life and enduring vision truly lies herein. Apart from this, there is no other Way.\n\nNow, the ceaseless movement day and night is the Way of Heaven. That a person, with their humble six-foot frame, can emulate the Way of Heaven and harmonize their movement with that of Heaven—how great is this Way! The *Yi Jing* says: \"Heaven’s movement is strong; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens themselves.\" The Master’s intent in composing the hexagrams was to make those who know the Way emulate the strength of Heaven’s movement. That by which Heaven constantly moves without ceasing is its strength. If one is strong, one can move without end. If the noble person wishes their movement to be unceasing, they should emulate this strength and fortify their resolve—only then can it be so.\n\nYet ceaselessness is what people find difficult. Heaven’s movement continues day and night without rest; if a person emulates Heaven’s ceaseless movement, how difficult is this! Nevertheless, great affairs in the world must begin with the small, and difficult tasks must begin with the easy. A tree of great girth grows from a tiny sprout; a nine-story terrace rises from heaped earth; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Thus, the sage plans for difficulty while it is still easy and achieves greatness while it is still small—all lies in the accumulation of long and gradual effort.\n\nThe *Huang Ting Jing* states: \"Immortal and Daoist are not divine; through accumulating essence and amassing qi, they attain perfection.\" Thus, from the moment of forming the embryo in a brief instant, after a hundred days the work becomes numinous; after ten months the embryo is complete; after one year there is small attainment; after three years, great attainment. Only after nine years, when the work is complete and all human affairs are exhausted, can one leave the world behind, stand alone, grow feathers, and ascend as an immortal. There has never been one who attained this without long and gradual accumulation. If one claims that without such accumulation one can suddenly ascend as an immortal, it is like digging a well nine *ren* deep with a single shovel or climbing a city wall a hundred million *zhang* high in a single step—how could this be possible?\n\nThe *Tong Xuan Zhen Jing* says: \"Though the lame turtle rests not a step, it travels a thousand miles; though earth is heaped without cease, a mountain is formed. By the river, one who desires fish would do better to return and weave a net.\" Thus, in learning the Dao, one need not fear failure—only lack of diligence. One need not fear lack of diligence—only lack of enduring resolve. For enduring resolve is the most difficult.\n\nWu Zongxuan’s *Xuan Gang Lun* states: \"Among a thousand who know the Dao, one resolves to follow it; among a thousand who resolve to follow it, one is single-minded; among a thousand who are single-minded, one is diligent and enduring. Thus, though many study, few succeed.\" If those who know can resolve, those who resolve can sever worldly ties, those who sever worldly ties can be single-minded, and those who are single-minded can be diligent and enduring, there is none who studies and does not attain. Yet as the world declines and customs deteriorate, and the distance from the sages grows ever greater, students often approach the path of stillness with restless hearts, seeking quick results and immediate responses, desiring near outcomes from distant efforts. None can persist to the end.\n\nHaving resolved, their resolve is not firm; believing in the Dao, their faith is not steadfast. They change course from morning to evening, begin with diligence but falter midway, delighting in the moment and wearying of perseverance. Yet they wish to match the years of Heaven and Earth—is this not foolish?\n\nThe *Nei Guan Jing* says: \"Knowing the Dao is easy; believing in it is difficult. Believing in the Dao is easy; practicing it is difficult. Practicing the Dao is easy; attaining it is difficult. Attaining the Dao is easy; preserving it is difficult.\" If it were not difficult, the streets would be filled with immortals—what would be extraordinary about that?\n\nLü Chunyang’s poem says:\n*\"Three acres of cinnabar field, unsown—\nTo sow them, one must borrow the Red Dragon’s plow.\nI once taught others to sow this seed,\nBut none understood its cultivation—how could the Dao grow?\"*\n\nIs the Dao distant from people? No—people distance themselves from the Dao.\n\nPeople merely see the *Wu Zhen Pian*’s line: \"The radiant red elixir forms in a day,\" and take the ancient immortals’ words as true and worthy of hearing. Yet when it speaks of nine years or three years, they dismiss it as mere procrastination, mocking the idea of long and gradual accumulation. They fail to understand that Master Ziyang’s poem borrows the words of Han Xiaoyao to enlighten those in the world who, unaware of the marvel of seeing effects in a single day, merely toil for three or nine years. It does not mean one can ascend as an immortal in a day without long and gradual effort.\n\nLet us examine this further. The *Shang Qing Ji* says:\n*\"Teach me to practice for a brief moment—\nBones grow cold, the heart’s flower forms into a single red grain.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"In the mid-autumn night of the Kai Xi era, I burned incense, knelt, and received the oral transmission.\nIn just two or three days of practice, Heaven and Earth, sun and moon became soft as silk.\"*\n\nYet it also says:\n*\"Even if one’s work reveals mercury and lead,\nWithout knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the fire of the Zhou Tian—\nOnly after ten months is the sacred embryo complete.\nThough the head of the elixir forms, it will dissipate in the end.\nOne must know the firing times to solidify it.\"*\n\nThus, while the minor effects of the golden elixir may be seen in a brief moment, its great work certainly does not end in a single day.\n\nMoreover, let us consider the sayings of the ancients. Wang Yixuan says:\n*\"Nine transformations in one year—\nLifespan may equal Heaven and Earth.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After the fire has circulated for a thousand days,\nThe furnace opens to reveal the eight jades.\"*\n\nHan Xiaoyao says:\n*\"After ten months, it is complete, resplendent between the Two Modes.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Three years emulate Heaven’s movement—\nForever free, the golden body is perfected.\"*\n\nWang and Han were both true immortals of the Tang who attained the Dao—would they speak falsely?\n\nLü Chunyang says:\n*\"A thousand days of work, never idle—\nThe river chariot carries its load up Kun Mountain.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Only when the celestial tally descends to the Jade Capital\nDo three thousand days of accumulated work begin.\"*\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n*\"The furnace seals the eight passes, completing the nine and five—\nThe medicine connects the seven returns—this takes three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After nine transformations, the work is complete in a thousand days—\nAlready, names are listed among the immortals.\"*\n\nDongbin and Haichan are among the most eminent of the immortals—would they speak falsely?\n\nNot only this. Chen Chaoyuan says:\n*\"Nurturing the embryo requires ten months;\nRefining the elixir takes three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After nine years of return without error,\nRefine pure yang to become the perfect truth.\"*\n\nWang Liangqi says:\n*\"The great general follows Heaven’s law, refining for a thousand days—\nThen the false is removed, and only the true remains.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The magic mushroom fills the three cinnabar fields—\nA thousand days of work extends ten thousand years.\"*\n\nXue Zixian says:\n*\"The four images are contained, returning to Wu and Si—\nDiligently for ten months, the infant is born.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Ascension must wait until three years—\nTenderly nurtured, with much affection.\"*\n\nLiu Xugu says:\n*\"The countenance may be fixed by three dwellings;\nThe embryo’s breath succeeds in one cycle.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The great work nears completion in three thousand days—\nThe wondrous use is flawless through the twelve hours.\"*\n\nChen Momo says:\n*\"The firing times gather and form in a hundred days;\nThe work is refined—this takes three years.\"*\n\nLi Changyuan says:\n*\"Do not say the elixir is complete in a day—\nIn the end, one must devote several years of work.\"*\n\nChen Cuixu says:\n*\"A moment’s work refines and reveals maturity—\nYet one must pass three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"A thousand mornings of firing times, knowing the seasons—\nThe sprout is certain, and mercury dries of itself.\"*\n\nWould all these masters have spoken falsely to deceive later generations?\n\nQiu Changchun’s *Pan Xi Ji* says:\n*\"Though blessings are light and demonic obstacles heavy,\nPress on—when the work is complete, it will surely be whole.\nLet our fellowship strive!\"*\n\nAlas for later generations—those who love the Dao, following in the wake of others’ elegance, tracing the brushstrokes of ancient texts, compiling them into illustrated volumes to instruct posterity. They expose the branches while concealing the root, adopting cryptic names like \"various stones\" to obscure the truth. Scholars who obtain these works treasure them in caskets all their lives; sons inherit their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons follow their ancestors’ paths, passing them down through generations—yet remain deluded, never awakening to the truth. Thus, officials abandon their posts, farmers neglect their plows, merchants forsake their goods, and men of aspiration fall into poverty. I grieve deeply for them.\n\nHere, I record these words—concise in language, simple in thought, sparing in detail. Each clause is laid out clearly, its substance verifiable, its measures and weights precise. Following their sequence, one may discern the pattern; the text’s gates and apertures lie open. Let the wise ponder and reflect, testing its meaning with their own insight.\n\nThe *Zhi Xuan*’s thirty-ninth chapter says:\n*\"Seeking immortality without recognizing true lead and mercury,\nOne idly reads ten thousand scrolls of alchemical texts—\nFor the lead and mercury spoken of in alchemical texts are but metaphors.\nThe learner must extend and expand upon them,\nLest one cling to the letter, mire in the image,\nAnd abandon one’s own body to seek it without.\"*\n\nIndeed, the sages of old pitied later generations—those who loved the Dao yet failed to grasp its teachings. Thus, they followed the elegance of others, traced the brushstrokes of ancient texts, and compiled them into illustrated volumes to guide them, truly intending to provide seekers with a path to trace the stream back to its source.\n\nYet in their writings, they often concealed the root, refusing to speak plainly, instead adopting names like \"the five metals and eight stones\" to expose only the branches. Those who later obtained these books, failing to fathom their essence, merely treasured them in caskets all their lives. Generation after generation, they remained deluded, exhausting cinnabar and mercury to no avail. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers left their fields untended, merchants lost their livelihoods, and men of aspiration had no means to sustain themselves. How lamentable!\n\nMaster Wei, grieving over this, thus composed and transmitted the *Cantong Qi* to the world. Within it, measures and weights are precise, not a single word is idly spoken. Following its sequence, not a single character is superfluous; with one glance at the branches, the substance is revealed. Truly, its words are concise and easy to ponder, its matters simple and uncluttered.\n\nSome may see its three chapters and suspect redundancy, unaware that the three chapters are but one chapter—one chapter but a single sentence.\n\nWithin its single-sentence oral formula, the teachings are dispersed across three chapters—thus the words are deliberately disordered, the gates and apertures concealed, lest the whole be carelessly revealed in one piece. Those of wisdom, if they examine and ponder it, cross-referencing with their own insight, will surely awaken to its truth.\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth, whose dark ravine spans tens of thousands of *li*. The greatness of the Dao cannot be captured in form or description; if one must describe it, then only Heaven and Earth suffice. Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all images, and within them lies the dark ravine—a celestial gulf stretching from the Tail and Winnowing Basket stars to the boundary of the Willow Star, cleaving the celestial vault in a span of countless *li*. Those who refine the elixir, if they truly model themselves upon Heaven and emulate Earth, turning inward to seek within their own bodies, will discover that within themselves lies a flask of Heaven. Only then will they understand that what Master Wei called the dark ravine is also present within them, and there is no need to seek it in the sky. What is this dark ravine? It is the Celestial River.\n\nWhen the River Drum nears the Star Marker, all the people are struck with terror. The River Drum is a star beside the Celestial River, positioned between the Dipper and Ox stars. The Star Marker is the *chou* position of the celestial vault. When the River Drum aligns with the Star Marker, it drives back the Tail Cavity, linking the empty flames and herding them into the Celestial Thoroughfare, surging straight upward. At the very moment of breaking through the pass and finding the path, how could the people within the body not tremble in alarm? The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Above the Winding River, the Golden Crow flies; the Moon Maiden rejoices with the Dipper and Ox\"—this refers precisely to the River Drum nearing the Star Marker. It also says: \"Mountains and rivers, the great earth, erupt in fierce fire; within, the ten thousand images stir with wind and thunder\"—this speaks of all the people being struck with terror.\n\nIf the sundial’s shadow recklessly advances or retreats, nine years of misfortune will follow. The sundial’s shadow refers to the firing times; advancing and retreating refer to progression and withdrawal. Nine years refers to the nine revolutions. If we compress nine years into a smaller scale, one month per cycle constitutes one revolution—the *Cui Xu Pian* speaks of \"nine revolutions of effort, nine months in use.\" If we compress it further, within a single moment there are minor nine revolutions—the *Jin Dan Da Cheng Ji* states: \"The nine revolutions of effort occur in an instant.\" If the sundial’s shadow recklessly advances or retreats, nine years of misfortune will follow: only if the firing times’ progression and withdrawal are not off by even a hair’s breadth can one steadily ride the Yellow Mare through the nine revolutions and remain free of calamity. Otherwise, during the nine revolutions, the Purple River Chariot will overturn, and misfortune will swiftly arrive. The *Wu Zhen Pian* states: \"It all depends on the power of cultivation; if off by even a hair’s breadth, the elixir will not form.\" One cannot be careless.\n\nWhen the August One gazes upon it, the King retreats to the rear. The *Tai Shang Su Ling Jing* states: \"The human body contains the Three Ones: the Upper One is the Heavenly Emperor of the body; the Middle One is the Cinnabar Emperor of the Crimson Palace; the Lower One is the Primordial King of the Yellow Court.\" Now, the Upper Heavenly Emperor is the Mud Pill Monarch of the Niwan; the Middle Cinnabar Emperor is the Heavenly Son of the Crimson Palace; the Lower Primordial King is the Primordial Yang Monarch of the Cinnabar Field. When Master Wei speaks of the August One gazing upon it, he refers to directing the spirit-fire to illuminate and enter the Kan trigram, driving out the true yang within Kan. When the King retreats to the rear, this means the true yang, pressed by the fire, emerges from its position in Kan. At this point, if one mobilizes the River Chariot, the true yang will ascend and soar, transforming the true yin of the Li Palace.\n\nThe gate-bolt has its rises and falls; the celestial revolution thus proceeds. The shape of Heaven is like a pellet, revolving day and night without cease. Its north and south poles—one high, one low—form the gate-bolt. The human body is the same: the Celestial Pass is above, the Earthly Axis below. If one can turn the Celestial Pass and rotate the Earthly Axis, aligning above and below, then with each breath, a full celestial revolution is completed.\n\nThe rivers and streams never run dry; their waters flow into the sea. The sea is where all rivers converge. The waters of the rivers and streams flow into the sea without ever running dry because the great mountains and rivers are interconnected through cavities, circulating endlessly. The human body is the same: when the qi flows unimpeded, the waters of the eight meridians all reverse their course and rush into the Primordial Sea.\n\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth linger between *zi* and *wu*. *Wu* is the center of Heaven; *zi* is the center of Earth. *Zi* and *wu* are the places where yin and yang intersect, where water and fire meet. When the sun and moon reach this point, they must linger. Today, when the sun is at its zenith, it is called \"pausing at *wu*,\" which is the meaning of lingering. In the Dao of the elixir, ascent and descent, rising and falling, also linger between *zi* and *wu*—this follows the same path as Heaven and Earth, with no difference.\n\n*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang, the gate of all things’ exit and entry. When the Dipper points to *yin*, spring arrives under Heaven, and the yang qi begins to flourish, bringing forth the ten thousand things. When the Dipper points to *shen*, autumn arrives under Heaven, and the yin qi begins to restrain, gathering in the ten thousand things. Thus, *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang, the gate of all things’ exit and entry. In the Dao of the elixir, exiting at *yin* and entering at *shen*, cycling endlessly, is this not the same as Heaven and Earth?\n\nFollowing the Dipper to summon the *Yao* star, grasping the balance to determine the primordial cycle. The *Shu Ji* of the *Tian Guan Shu* states: \"The handle of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars drags the Dragon’s Horn; the balance of the Southern Dipper’s scoop rests on the head of Orion. At dusk, the handle establishes the cycle; at midnight, the balance establishes it; at dawn, the scoop establishes it.\" It also states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, distinguishing yin and yang, establishing the four seasons, balancing the five phases, shifting the solar terms, and determining all cycles—all depend on the Dipper.\" The *Dou Suo Yin* states: \"The *Chun Qiu Yun Dou Ji* says: the Dipper’s first star is the Celestial Pivot, the second is the Jade Swivel, the third is the Jade Armillary, the fourth is the Balance, the fifth is the Crossbar, the sixth is the Open Yang, and the seventh is the Twinkling Brilliance. The first through fourth form the scoop; the fifth through seventh form the handle.\" When Master Wei speaks of following the Dipper to summon the *Yao* star and grasping the balance to determine the primordial cycle, he refers to the celestial pivot of one’s own body pointing from *zi* and cycling through the twelve branches.\n\nThe Dipper resides at the center of Heaven just as the heart resides at the center of the human body. Thus, Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism, and humans use the heart as theirs. In the elixir method, the heart directs the firing times just as Heaven uses the Dipper to govern the twelve branches. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Seizing the Heavenly mechanism’s wonder, at midnight observe the Dipper’s handle—a few drops of pearly dew, who moves them to the rice flower’s head?\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nAscending and steaming upon the Steamer Mountain, flames blazing below; the White Tiger sings in the lead, the Azure Dragon harmonizes behind. The Steamer Mountain is Kunlun Mountain. When the medicine ascends, the golden furnace blazes, the jade crucible boils, the tiger roars first, and the dragon sings after—like a husband leading and his wife following. The *Jin Dan Da Cheng Ji* states: \"When the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep of night, swiftly drive the River Chariot without pause. In an instant, carry it to the Niwan’s peak, advance the fire, and refine it in the jade furnace until it resembles snow.\" This clarifies the meaning.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its five-colored plumage dazzling—yet it encounters the spread net, pressed down and unable to rise. Its cries are mournful and bitter, like an infant longing for its mother. Overturned into the seething cauldron, its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is fire. When overturned and driven within the crucible, it chases and urges the Five Agents, forming the five colors and soaring above. If enveloped by the net, wind and clouds fill the crucible, and the cries resemble those of an infant. Once caught in the net and pressed down, unable to take flight, it gathers its body and folds its wings, crouching within the crucible. The *Chilong Dadan Jue* states: \"The Vermilion Bird loves to fly high, yet the Toad seizes it. Though it cries as the Alchemical Maiden, its weeping is no more than an infant’s. Its radiant power flourishes, but its hidden strength gradually wanes.\" This is precisely the meaning. The *Yuanyangzi Dadao Ge* says: \"The Azure Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger follows the Dragon. The Red Bird mates, their voices harmonious. Regulating qi and managing fire, cinnabar enters the abdomen from the Li Palace, and the body naturally ascends.\" This, too, clarifies the meaning.\n\nBefore half the clepsydra has passed, the dragon’s scales and mane rise, and the five colors gleam and shimmer, transforming without constancy. The crucible boils turbulently, surging violently without cease. Layer upon layer, interlocking like canine teeth, its form resembles midwinter ice. The railing drips with stalactites, towering and jumbled, heaped and propped against one another.\n\n\"Before half the clepsydra has passed, the dragon’s scales and mane rise\" refers to the moment of refinement: in less than a moment, qi subtly traverses the Three Passes, yellow clouds form ranks, white sheep gather in herds, and golden coins, golden flowers, and golden scales arrive in profusion. \"The five colors gleam and shimmer, transforming without constancy\" describes how the wind sways the jeweled tree, its light filling the eyes, and rain strikes the jade flowers, snow covering one’s robes—crimson clouds and purple mists manifest in endless variation. \"The crucible boils turbulently, surging violently without cease\" means that when the fire in the Cinnabar Field blazes and the wind in the Mud Pill Palace arises, the Three Palaces fill with qi, like the moment when steamed rice in a rice steamer is fully cooked, and boiling water surges within the pot. \"Layer upon layer, interlocking like canine teeth, its form resembles midwinter ice; the railing drips with stalactites, towering and jumbled, heaped and propped against one another\" describes how, with each inhalation and exhalation, the elixir gradually congeals and coalesces, pouring forth the Yellow Sprout from the earth, naturally forming buds and sprouting blossoms. The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Though the toil lasts but ten months, gradually gathering and congealing, if the scholar can inwardly refine with devotion, day and night without weariness, the elixir’s form will change with each passing hour, and the fire’s work will not err from night to night. As in the scenes above, each will be personally witnessed.\"\n\nWhen yin and yang attain their union, they dwell in tranquil harmony.\nThe *Wu Zhen Pian* says: \"When yin and yang unite in harmony, the two eights naturally pair. If the true breath flows continuously without interruption, yin and yang will attain their union. By emptying the mind and concentrating the spirit in pure unity, yin and yang will naturally dwell in harmony.\"\n\nThe Azure Dragon resides in House Six, the spring blossoms of the Zhen Palace in the east at Mao. The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, the autumn awns of the Dui Palace in the west at You. The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two, the true yang of the Li Palace in the south at Wu. When all three come to pay court, their household becomes kin. Originally but two things, in the end they become three, five, and three-five—all gathering at Danger One, converging in the place of governance. The days of refinement follow the method above.\n\nThe twenty-eight lunar lodges of the celestial circuit: the seven lodges of the east are called the Azure Dragon; the seven lodges of the west are called the White Tiger. Among the twelve celestial divisions, the middle one of the three eastern divisions is called *Great Fire*; the middle one of the three western divisions is called *Great Beam*. *Great Fire* lies at the center of the three eastern divisions, in the celestial position of Chen, corresponding to Mao, belonging to the trigram Zhen, to spring, and to wood. House Five Degrees resides within *Great Fire*, hence it is said: \"The Azure Dragon resides in House Six, the spring blossoms of the Zhen Palace in the east at Mao.\" *Great Beam* lies at the center of the three western divisions, in the celestial position of Xu, corresponding to You, belonging to the trigram Dui, to autumn, and to metal. Pleiades Seven Degrees resides within *Great Beam*, hence it is said: \"The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, the autumn awns of the Dui Palace in the west at You.\" \"The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two, the true yang of the Li Palace in the south at Wu\" refers to Spread, a lodge of the southern quadrant, whose symbol is the Vermilion Bird. Though Spread spans eighteen degrees, only two are mentioned here, for the celestial circle of 365 degrees is bisected between the northern lodges Void and Danger, and Danger’s first degree aligns precisely with Spread Two in the south. \"When all three come to pay court, their household becomes kin\" means that the true qi of the three directions—Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—all converge at the Dark Warrior’s position. House Six and Pleiades Seven correspond to the completion numbers of water and fire, while Spread Two and Danger One correspond to the generative numbers of water and fire, like kinfolk drawing near. \"Originally but two things, in the end they become three, five, and three-five—all gathering at Danger One\" means that at their root, they are merely water and fire. When these two are moved within the crucible, they arrange into three and five, that is, House Six, Pleiades Seven, and Spread Two. When the three families meet and converge at Danger One, the infant is formed. \"The days of refinement follow the method above\" means that in cultivating the Great Elixir, one must proceed according to the method above, awaiting the moment when the solitary yang arises to advance the fire, for the marvelous work begins at Void and Danger.\n\nFirst white, then yellow, with red permeating both inside and out—this is called the First Crucible, its form like a grain of millet.\n\n\"First white, then yellow\" describes how it initially resembles jade liquid flying through the void, then gradually appears as flowing gold filling the hut. \"Red permeating both inside and out\" describes how the numinous light and divine flame burn through heaven and earth, with wind, thunder, clouds, and mist filling the mountains and rivers. \"Called the First Crucible\" refers to the first of the nine cycles of firing. \"Its form like a grain of millet\" means that when the elixir head has just formed, it is no larger than a millet grain.\n\nIt is the work of spontaneity, not of deviance or falsehood.\n\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir has often been regarded by ancient immortals as spontaneous. If it is truly spontaneous, what need is there for methods or oral instructions? One need only entrust it to spontaneity—why rely on a teacher’s transmission? Yet this is not so. The method of the elixir is most simple and most easy; its divine mechanism and marvelous workings require no contrivance, no thought. Thus it is called spontaneous. However, one must withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, concentrating the spirit within. With each breath, long and unbroken, neither hurried nor slow, without interruption, the spirit returns to the qi, and the qi unites with the spirit, intertwining to form the embryo. It is not merely a matter of entrusting everything to spontaneity.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Golden and Azure Dragon-Tiger* states: \"The essential point of spontaneity lies in first preserving and then forgetting. First preserving and then forgetting means first preserving the spirit within the qi-cavern, and afterward forgetting it together with the qi. Practicing thus, the spirit naturally congeals, the qi naturally gathers, and the breath naturally stabilizes—this is not the same as settling the mind into quiescence like withered wood or dead ashes. For while settling the mind into quiescence like withered wood or dead ashes may serve as a means to enter the Dao, it is not sufficient for cultivating truth.\"\n\nThe *Zhi Xuan Pian* says: \"The merit of spontaneity is partial; spontaneity arises from what is not spontaneous.\" This is precisely what is meant. Yet when the time arrives and the qi transforms, when the mechanism stirs and the elixir resonates, within spontaneity there lies the secret of refining and advancing the fire.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: \"At first, one engages in effort, which people readily notice; by the time one reaches non-doing, the multitude knows it. They see non-doing as the essential marvel, but how could they know that effort is the foundation? If a scholar, unaware that the elixir method involves effort, immediately seeks non-doing and spontaneity, how is this different from one who neither plows nor weeds yet sits waiting for a bountiful harvest?\"\n\nWhen the qi of mountains and marshes steams upward, it forms clouds and becomes rain. All know that timely rain descends from heaven, and clouds emerge from mountains and rivers, yet they do not realize that the rain in the sky is the transformed qi of mountains and marshes. For the qi of mountains and marshes steams upward into the heavens, where it transforms into clouds; thus, yin and yang harmonize and produce rain. Once formed, the rain returns to the earth. The workings of the golden elixir within our bodies differ not the slightest from this. Master Wei’s use of this analogy to instruct later learners is truly ingenious in its comparisons.\n\n\"Mud dries and turns to dust; fire extinguishes and becomes earth.\" Mud is earth near water, heavy and sluggish by nature, residing below. When exposed to the sun and dried, its earthly nature is exhausted, and it cracks, transforming into dust. Fire is an insubstantial and luminous element; when it clings to wood, it produces smoke and flame. When the smoke dissipates and the flame cools, the nature of fire is extinguished, and the embers turn to ash and earth. Only by understanding this can one discuss the Dao of yin and yang’s reversal and return.\n\n\"When coptis is dyed, it becomes yellow; when indigo is used, it turns green. Boiling hides and leather makes glue; fermenting yeast transforms into wine. Though the materials differ, the application of effort is the same—without the proper seed, skill is in vain.\"\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: \"A thousand efforts are in vain if not for the proper material; only true lead aligns with the sagely mechanism.\" When true mercury obtains true lead, qi and material mutually resonate, wondrously uniting and congealing—like a husband and wife finding their match, hence called \"shared material.\" When materials are the same, as with coptis dyeing yellow, indigo dyeing green, hides becoming glue, or yeast becoming wine, no effort is wasted, and truth naturally manifests. If one abandons this and seeks elsewhere, it is not the proper seed—labor is spent in vain.\n\nThis wondrous art is precise and not deceptive; its teachings have been transmitted for a hundred million generations, luminous and verifiable, shining like the stars across the Han sky, resplendent as the source of rivers and seas. Among the myriad secondary methods and minor arts in the world—numbering no less than three thousand six hundred—only this is the celestial treasure, the Great Elixir of the Ninefold Reverted Flow, the wondrous art of non-doing and purity. Its method is most simple and most easy; even the foolish man or woman, upon obtaining and practicing it, may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. Thus, the celestial precepts are most solemn, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Those who study it in this world, without karmic affinity and resonance, will not easily encounter it.\n\nNow, Master Wei did not conceal this celestial treasure but composed these three texts. Every word is detailed and precise, every character true and exact, shining like the stars across the Han sky, resplendent as the source of rivers and seas—truly the bright mirror for learners of immortality across a hundred million generations.\n\nThe *Zhi Xuan Pian* states: \"How many scriptures there are, each line true, transmitted only to those of lofty attainment.\" The *Wu Jie Pian* says: \"It is not that the great Dao and immortals are stingy, but that the common crowd lacks sincerity. Some believe the blind teachings of false masters and mistakenly claim that immortals deceive. Would immortals deceive? The ancient immortals left elixir texts in the world to guide later learners. Their discussions are luminous and verifiable; those who have not yet encountered them may explore them here, and those who have awakened may use them for confirmation. All who attained the Dao in antiquity did so in this manner.\"\n\nLiu Haichan said: \"Roaming freely through grottoes and palaces, I sought out all the immortal scriptures. Fortunately, I did not violate my vow and ultimately fulfilled this wish.\" Yang Xubai said: \"I traversed famous mountains and wondrous realms, visiting every constellation without fail. I delved into secret formulas and divine methods, profound and abstruse, and have long delighted in them.\" Chen Momo said: \"I perused countless texts, consulted lofty masters, and wandered like clouds and water. Reflecting on what I gained, it all aligned with the sagely teachings. There has never been one who clung to personal views without seeking the counsel of fellow Daoists, or who adhered solely to a master’s teachings without reading elixir texts.\"\n\nHow excellent is the saying of Shi Qizhen: \"The superior person of antiquity first broadly studied elixir texts, then extensively consulted fellow Daoists. When discussing the Dao, their consultations yielded no contradictions; when contemplating the Dao, their teachers were never reckless. How can later learners claim that oral instructions are not found in texts and thus neglect their study?\"\n\nIf one says, \"I possess my master’s secret transmission, whose discourse on medicinal substances and fire phases is absent from ancient and modern elixir texts and unmentioned in the *Cantong Qi*,\" then such a person is deluded.\n\nEnough! Reflect deeply, ensuring thoroughness; repeatedly examine the text, a thousand cycles above and below. After ten thousand readings, the radiance will be splendid, and the divine illumination may reveal itself. When instructing others, the heart’s spirit may suddenly awaken. Seek the thread, trace its origins, and you will surely find the gate and doorway.\n\n\"Reading a book a hundred times, its meaning becomes clear.\" If even a hundred readings suffice, how much more so a thousand or ten thousand? Thus, reciting it ten thousand times, the wondrous principle will naturally clarify. Even without receiving a master’s oral instructions, over time one will surely awaken to it. Such awakenings often occur in the deep of night or during quiet sitting. For when one concentrates the mind, savors the text deeply, and repeatedly recites it, accumulating over time, it may suddenly burst forth, and one will naturally comprehend—this is what is meant by \"the heart’s spirit suddenly awakening when instructing others.\"\n\nMaster Guanzi said: \"Think and think again, ponder deeply. If thinking does not lead to understanding, the spirit will make it clear—not by the spirit’s power, but by the extremity of sincerity.\" This saying is apt.\n\nIn recent times, Zhang Ziyang transmitted the *Awakening to Reality* to Minister Ma Chuhou of Fufeng, urging him: \"I hope you will disseminate this text, for there will be those who, upon reading it, will awaken to its intent.\" Thus, in his preface, he wrote: \"The *Awakening to Reality* exhaustively expounds the subtle principles of the great elixir’s medicinal substances and fire phases. If those of good fortune, possessing the bones of immortality, encounter it, their wisdom and discernment will naturally clarify, allowing them to seek understanding through the text.\" His earnest exhortations to later learners share the same intent as Master Wei’s—this is what is meant by \"the spirit instructs, and the heart awakens.\" After all, such a principle truly exists.\n\nHad this not been the case, why would these two masters have troubled themselves to compose such empty words, thereby grossly deceiving later generations? The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it is invariably transmitted to the worthy.\n\nTan Jingsheng entrusted his *Book of Transformations* to Song Qiqiu, who murdered Jingsheng and usurped the text, renaming it as his own. Soon after, he met an ignoble end—this was a transmission to the unworthy, bringing calamity to both. In contrast, Wu Shiyun transmitted the Dao to Xu Jingsun, who then received the supreme Dao from the Divine Mother Chen, and later passed it on to Wu. All of them attained the Dao and achieved perfection—this was a transmission to the worthy, bringing fortune to both. For the Dao of Heaven is impartial, ever bestowed upon the good. If the recipient is unworthy, the Dao does not flow in vain. How, then, could there be no distinction of fortune or misfortune in the transmission between the worthy and the unworthy?\n\nAlas! The ways of the world have long since declined, growing ever more degenerate. The good are no longer seen in my time; if I could but meet one of steadfast virtue, it would suffice.\n\n**Song of the Cauldron**\n\nIts circumference is three *cun* and five *fen*, its diameter one *cun*—\nThis is the great treasure-cauldron of my body.\nThe Three Powers reside within it,\nThe Five Phases revolve within it.\nLead and mercury, with earth at their center—\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says, \"Here lies the vessel from which all phenomena arise.\"\nThis is the very thing.\nAll the wondrous subtleties of the golden elixir emerge from this alone.\nTo claim it lies outside one’s body in another is not the Way of purity.\n\nThe mouth spans four and eight *cun*—\nFour *cun* and eight *fen*: the Four Images and Eight Trigrams are all contained within.\nThe two *cun* of the lips mark the boundary between the two primal forces, above and below.\n\nThe cauldron is one *chi* and two *cun* in length,\nCorresponding to the twelve months of the year and the fire phases of the celestial cycle.\nIts body and belly must be evenly proportioned, neither too thick nor too thin, lest it tilt to one side.\n\nWhen seated, align the abdomen upright, let warmth descend—\nSit with the eyes facing the nose, the nose facing the navel.\nThe body must be level and straight, not leaning or slanting.\nThe eyes should be half-veiled, not fully closed—\nFully closed, and one falls into the black mountain’s demon cave.\nThe *qi* flows through the nose, connecting the orifices;\nDo not breathe coarsely, for coarse breath stokes the fire,\nAnd when the fire blazes, the medicine scatters.\n\nYin above, yang below—\nWater and fire in mutual balance.\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* says:\n\"Fire in the Sāgara Sea,\nWaves on Kunlun Mountain—\nWho can grasp the great intent of their operation?\nOnly the Yellow Dame, in her subtlety.\"\nThe Yellow Dame’s work ensures that water moistens below and fire flames above—\nHow else could they achieve balance?\n\nThe beginning and end are martial, the middle is civil—\nThe beginning and end are the dark and new moons,\nWhen yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir—hence the martial fire.\nThe middle is the full moon,\nWhen yang reaches its peak and yin begins to stir—hence the civil fire.\nYet these terms—dark moon, new moon, full moon—are but metaphors;\nOne must not seek their meaning solely on paper.\n\nIt begins with seventy, ends with thirty, and two hundred and six—all must be harmonized.\n\"Thirty\" refers to the three decades.\nSeventy and thirty sum to one hundred, which, with two hundred and six, makes three hundred and six—\nCorresponding to the three hundred and sixty days of the annual celestial cycle.\nWhen cultivation reaches one hundred days, the sacred embryo first quickens.\nOnce quickened, for the next two hundred and sixty days,\nOne must skillfully harmonize the *qi* and fire phases,\nEnsuring the warmth never ceases—\nThen the elixir’s work naturally completes.\nThe *Cuixu Pian* says:\n\"In nurturing, be ever steadfast;\nLet the gentle wind blow constantly toward the *Kan* trigram.\nWhether walking, sitting, lying, or eating, remain thus—\nFear only that the fire grows cold and the elixir’s power lags.\nThere is no other hardship.\"\n\nYin fire is white, the yellow sprout is lead—\nFrom *zi* to *si* is the phase of yang fire;\nFrom *wu* to *hai* is the phase of yin fire.\n*You* resides in the west, and the west corresponds to metal—hence \"yin fire is white.\"\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"The toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River.\"\nLead is born from earth, silver from lead;\nWhen silver is refined from lead, it forms the yellow sprout—\nThis is true lead.\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Jing* says: \"Refine lead to seek the yellow color.\"\n\nThe two sevens gather to assist the human—\nThe two sevens are the seven lunar lodges of the Eastern Green Dragon\nAnd the seven lunar lodges of the Western White Tiger.\nThe human is the central position.\nWhen the two sevens gather to assist the human,\nIt is the coiling of the dragon and the mating of the tiger, converging at the center.\nThen, as if the suddenness of the Southern Sea met the fleetingness of the Northern Sea\nIn the land of primordial chaos—\nThis is how the elixir is refined.\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"The three families meet to form the infant,\"\nAnd again:\n\"The Five Phases must all enter the center.\"\nIs this not what it means?\n\nNourish the brain, stabilize it, and ascend to the mysterious—\nThe brain is the upper field, the palace where the original spirit resides.\nIf one can grasp the original spirit and lodge it in its proper abode,\nTrue *qi* naturally ascends, and true breath naturally stabilizes.\nThis is what is meant by:\n\"When one orifice opens, a hundred orifices all open;\nWhen the great pass is unblocked, a hundred passes all unblock.\"\nWhen forging the elixir, the embryo enters the mouth;\nAfter the work is complete, the embryo emerges from the shell—\nNeither departs from this.\nThe *Jingzhong Yin* says:\n\"I cultivate Kunlun and obtain the true formula;\nDaily I practice without cease.\nOne day, when the work is complete, no one will know—\nOn all sides, night-shining gates will appear.\"\nThis is the result of long cultivation, when the work is ample—\nNot the achievement of a single morning or evening.\n\nThe child abides in the center and is peacefully preserved—\nWhen the infant dwells within the womb, nurtured by the devoted care of the Earth Mother,\nIt is peacefully preserved.\n\nThe comings and goings do not leave the gate—\nThis gate is the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nThe comings and goings are the ebb and flow of breath.\nWhen the ebb and flow do not depart from the Mysterious Female’s gate,\nyin and yang qi are naturally full and the spirit naturally flows.\nGradually, the great nature becomes pure:\nIn movement and stillness, sitting and lying down,\nit is continuous as if preserved—\nDay by day, it gradually congeals and gathers.\nOnce the fetal qi has congealed, the infant appears in form,\nand the nature becomes ever more refined.\n\nReturning to the One, restoring the original source—\nThe Great Elixir’s Way is simply embracing the origin and guarding the One.\nAt the beginning, it lies in yin and yang and the Five Phases;\nat the end, it arrives at primordial chaos and the Infinite.\nThis is called returning to the One and restoring the source.\n\nLove and reverence like lord and minister—\nLiving in seclusion for a year, rising early and retiring late without slack,\nloving and revering it as a minister serves his lord.\nAfter one full cycle, the toil is great.\nThe *Huánjīn Piān* says:\n*\"Joyful for a hundred thousand kalpas,\nyet toiling for one or two years—\nSince ancient times, none has entered seclusion for a year\nand ascended to immortality in an instant.\"*\nThe *Língyuán Dàdào Gē* says:\n*\"In later years, when the work is complete, one roams freely;\nAt first, cultivation must be diligent—\nAmid diligence, one must not be idle,\nidly preserving the original spirit.\"*\nHow profound its words! How profound!\n\nGuard closely, lest you fall into confusion—\nThe *Cuìxū Piān* says:\n*\"By day, wield the numinous banner;\nBy night, pluck the mushroom of fire.\nIn practice, be ever vigilant against danger—\nWithout a fellow cultivator to correct you,\nhow can you know if the furnace’s fire-timing is amiss?\"*\nFor the Way is an inch higher, and the demon an inch taller.\nIn every moment of the hundred divisions of the day,\nbeware of confusion—\nThe cultivator must ever remain alert.\n\nThe path is distant, profoundly mysterious—\nMoving within the Mysterious Female,\nin a single day one travels eighty-four thousand miles—\nIs this not a distant path?\nVast beyond measure, minute beyond limit,\nwelcoming it, one sees not its head;\nfollowing it, one sees not its tail—\nIs this not profoundly mysterious?\nOne who attains this can command creation,\ninvert yin and yang,\nand unite the Qian and Kun of one’s own body.\n\nThe *dāoguī* touches, the po-soul is guarded—\nThe *dāoguī* is the elixir’s head;\nthe po-soul, the dragon and tiger.\nWhen transported to the peak of Kunlun,\nit transforms into jade nectar flowing into the mouth—\nThen the wind is calm, the waves still,\nthe tiger subdued, the dragon tamed.\n\nAttaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village—\nAfter the elixir is complete,\none is free and unbound,\nsoaring in the high Dao,\nindifferent to mountains or markets—\nall may serve as a place of retreat.\nYet Master Wei does not speak of dwelling in the city or court,\nbut of the immortal village—\nfor in the end, the mountains are the quiet affinity.\n\nThose who delight in the Way seek its root—\nThe root is the root of Heaven and Earth,\nthe foundation of the Golden Elixir.\nThe *Cuìxū Piān* says:\n*\"Once you recognize the elixir’s foundation,\nwhether releasing or gathering, it is always this—\nWithout a perfected one to point the way,\nwho could know it?\"*\nIf one who delights in the Way can seek and find this,\nhow fortunate!\n\nExamine the Five Phases, determine the precise measures—\nWhen the Five Phases flow in sequence, they give life to humans;\nwhen reversed, they serve the elixir.\nThe method must be carefully examined.\nIf the fire count is excessive, it scorches;\nif the water measure is too great, it overflows—\nThe balance of weight must be precisely determined.\n\nContemplate deeply—no need for discussion;\nConceal it deeply, guard it, do not transmit it—\nThe *Wùzhēn Piān* says:\n*\"Lately, the golden light shines through the body,\nyet I do not speak of this to ordinary people.\"*\nQuietly reflect on this principle:\nThe Way is the secret of a thousand sages.\nThose who attain it keep it in their breast,\nself-sufficient in its use—\nWhy then lightly reveal it,\ncarelessly leaking it,\neagerly speaking of it to others?\nThough for one’s own sake this may suffice,\nwhat of the world and later generations?\nThis is why the *Cāntóngqì* was composed.\n\nRiding a white crane, driving a dragon-scale chariot,\nRoaming the Great Void, visiting the Immortal Lord,\nReceiving the talismanic register, styled a Perfected One—\nAfter the embryo is complete and the work accomplished,\none must regulate the spirit and emerge from the shell.\nNow one may ride a white crane or mount a fiery dragon,\ntranscending the three realms’ difficult paths,\nascending to the Primordial Heaven of the Highest Origin—\nFrom this, one attains carefree joy,\nequal in years to Heaven,\nstyled a Perfected One.\nYet all phenomena are empty and illusory—\nWhat white crane or dragon-scale is there?\nIf you say he is a Buddha, you yourself become a demon—\nWhat Immortal Lord is there?\n\nKnow that the white crane and dragon-scale\nare transformations of one’s own numinous power,\nand the Immortal Lord is one’s own Three Pure Ones—\nWhy gaze upward in vain?\nThose who do not grasp this principle\nspend their days in delusion, awaiting a heavenly decree.\nSome are seized by black tigers,\nswallowed by giant pythons—\nIs this not lamentable?\n\nThe Song people dug a well and gained a man’s strength,\nand it was passed down that a man emerged from the earth.\nXu Jingyang’s entire household attained the Dao,\nand later generations believed they lifted roof tiles into the clouds—\nHow excessive is the world’s love of strange tales!\nYet this may be spoken to the wise—\nit is difficult to discuss with the vulgar.\nTo the wise, one speaks of conduct that accords with virtue;\nto the foolish, one reverses the teaching, saying, *\"I presume.\"*\nWhere can I find one of perfect discernment\nto discuss these matters to their fullest?\n\nAlas!\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* presents its outlines in broad strokes, yet it cannot maintain purity and unity. Its explanations overflow and scatter, leaving subtle details incomplete and its scope too broad, its meaning only vaguely discernible. Now, I have once more compiled and recorded this text to fill its omissions, refine its obscurities, and draw together its scattered threads so that its intent may be unified and its purpose unobstructed. Thus, I compose this again, designating the Three in Mutual Accordance. In this, the essence and nature of the *Great Change* are fully expressed: *can* refers to the Three, *tong* to their mutual accord, and *qi* to their accordance. This book borrows from the *Great Change* to expound the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and it further accords with the workings of the furnace and fire. The transformations of yin and yang in these three are nearly indistinguishable.\n\nMaster Wei pitied later students for their lack of understanding, and so he composed this single work to set forth the outlines of the Great Dao. Yet, fearing the leakage of profound secrets, he dared not fully reveal it in one continuous exposition. Instead, he resorted to indirect allusions and circuitous metaphors, allowing his explanations to overflow and scatter. Concerned that its scope was too broad and its meaning too vague to fully convey the subtleties, he appended the *Song of the Cauldron* at the end. Whatever omissions existed in the text of the main chapters, he filled in this song; whatever obscurities lay in its principles, he refined in this song. Thus, the three chapters’ words are drawn together, their intent unified, so that later readers may find a direct path without straying from its purpose.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states:\n*The essential Dao is nurtured in the midst of nothingness,\nWithin it, a true and certain core is formed.\nSimplicity and wonder hold the celestial mechanism,\nYet scattered across alchemical texts, it refuses to be revealed.*\n\nIf this is so, then why did Master Wei tirelessly expound his teachings, revisiting them again and again? His intent was no different. Otherwise, the essentials of the Great Elixir could be conveyed in a single phrase or half a sentence—why labor over such exhaustive detail?\n\nThe *Great Change* embodies the nature and essence of things, each in its proper measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi delve into their mysteries and can be applied. The workings of the furnace and fire have a true basis. These three Ways emerge from a single source, sharing the same path. The Dao is present everywhere, and every head is aligned with it. The Three Sages each followed their proper measure: the *Yi* was composed through observation, the mysteries of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi were explored to create the elixir, and the furnace and fire stole their mechanism to forge the art of refinement. Whether expressed in words, cultivated in the body, or embedded in objects, all arise from observing the heavens and examining the earth, from understanding the laws of yin and yang’s union, and from drawing upon distant principles and applying them near at hand to grasp the transformations and permutations of creation. Thus, these Three Ways exist. Though their paths differ, they converge in the same place—this is why they are called the Three in Mutual Accordance.\n\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves—all fruits hang and spread forth, yet their origin lies in the root. They do not lose their fundamental nature. What I have spoken here is sincere and without error. The Dao is the root of the ten thousand things, just as the root is to a tree. When it sprouts into branches and stems, the *Yi* of the Three Sages emerges. When it scatters into flowers and leaves, the techniques of the furnace and fire arise. When it ripens into fruit and returns to the root, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi do not lose their fundamental nature, refining the golden liquid and inner elixir to nurture the sacred embryo. Master Wei spoke of these three as mutually accordant, establishing them side by side—not out of a fondness for excessive solemnity, but to enable students to thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation. His words arose from sincerity, and thus they are precise and without error.\n\nI, a rustic from the state of Kuai, a withered scholar dwelling in a secluded valley, cling to simplicity and plainness, finding no joy in power or glory. I dwell in obscurity, indifferent to profit or fame, holding fast to tranquility and contentment, seeking peace in quietude. Thus, I have composed this text.\n\nMaster Wei was born in the Eastern Han, named Boyang, styled Yun Ya Zi. He hailed from Shangyu in Guiji. Now, referring to him as from the state of Kuai is a veiled expression. He was the son of a noble family, inheriting its legacy of cap and sash, yet he alone did not serve in office. Instead, he cultivated the true, lived in quiet obscurity, nurtured his will in emptiness and nothingness, and was broadly learned in literature and the apocrypha. Serene and unadorned, he held fast to the fundamental, following only the Dao. To him, official robes and carriages were but chaff and husks.\n\nThough none can trace the lineage of his master’s transmission, he obtained the oral instructions of the Great Elixir. Thereupon, he distilled the *Zhouyi* to compose this *Cantong qi* in three chapters. Fearing his words might yet fall short, he further composed the *Song of the Tripod* to supplement omissions, refine obscurities, and deepen the subtleties of the three chapters. He secretly imparted it to Xu Jingxiu of Qingzhou, who, concealing his name, wrote a commentary. By the reign of Emperor Huan, it was transmitted to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery, whence it spread through the world.\n\nAlas! This book elucidates the essentials of the Dao and reveals the workings of heaven—its grasp of truth is so precise, its exposition so comprehensive. Such mastery cannot arise from mere knowledge but must spring from lived realization. Yet Master Wei still humbled himself as a rustic, a withered tree—such was the depth of his modesty.\n\nThe *Song* expounds the *Yijing*, preserving the legacy of the Three Sages. Its intent is singular, its principles unified, ever striving to align with nature, radiate spirit, and foster transformation, that harmony may flow through the four seas and peace endure as a model for ten thousand generations. It offers a sequence to govern, a path to nurture life: the golden light of inner cultivation arises naturally, virtue thickens, roots return to origin, and the Way draws near to the heart, never leaving the self. Embracing the One without abandonment ensures enduring existence. Paired with dietary arts—yin and yang in harmonious union—lead and mercury are subdued. The dual yellows are first swept away, and the remaining stones, though once prized, may all be discarded. Through careful application and refinement, they become either yellow or white, forming substances cherished by the world. The alchemical furnace is truly wondrous.\n\nFu Xi drew the eight trigrams and doubled them; King Wen arranged the hexagrams and observed their images, appending judgments; Confucius further praised them with the Ten Wings. Thus, they sought to align the principles of life and destiny, weaving the Dao of heaven and earth into a whole. Hence, as a calendar, it offers a clear path to follow, a law for all ages; as a guide to governance, its application is effortless, a model for a hundred kings. The Dao of the *Yijing* is vast indeed.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor observed the Way of heaven and mastered its workings; Laozi, thick in virtue, was likened to an unblemished child. The *Yinfu jing* in over three hundred characters and the *Daode jing* in over five thousand words—though their discussions unfold and return—all reveal the marvels of creation’s spontaneity. Thus, those who cultivate the Elixir must take the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as their foundation. Their teachings are supreme.\n\nAs for the arts of dietary ingestion, when the marvel of yin-yang harmony is achieved to subdue lead and mercury, the dual yellows are first swept away, and the remaining stones, though once prized, may all be discarded. Through careful application and refinement, they become either yellow or white, forming substances cherished by the world. The alchemical furnace is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe *Yijing*, the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—each in its own way.\n\nThe alchemical furnace, too—three branches arrayed, stems interconnected, emerging from different names yet all through a single gate. This is called the Three Phases. Not merely an accumulation of parallel phrases or harmonious couplets, this text verily contains its truth. Were I to fabricate falsehoods, I would incur the fault of superfluity. The *Cantong qi* offers but a glimpse of its essence, its words few yet its meaning vast. Later generations ought to follow Wei Boyang, composing the *Dingqi Ge* to append to the three chapters. Its characters, bright and resplendent, gleam with clarity—how could this be mere embellishment of yellow and white, or the pairing of rhymes for aesthetic delight? Rather, it holds the most profound truth within.\n\nTo claim these are deceptive words meant to delude posterity would be something even those with slight understanding of the Dao would refuse to do. How could Wei Boyang have done so? Moreover, heaven’s judgment is luminous and clear; blessings and misfortunes are never far. Why risk deceiving later generations and the world with falsehoods, thereby incurring the sin of deceiving heaven? The *Dingqi Ge* was composed precisely to fill the omissions and illuminate the abstruse depths of the three chapters. Though its verses are but three characters long, appearing brief, their meaning is vast and all-encompassing, lacking nothing. Truly, it is plain and lucid, ready to be put into practice. If later scholars do not place their trust in this, where else shall they turn?\n\n*\"Entrust the seasons, avoid harm,\nRely on the mountains’ steadfastness,\nWander the boundless expanse,\nNeighbor to the spirits.\nTransform the form into immortality,\nSink into silence without sound.\nOnce in a hundred generations,\nRoam the human realm,\nSpreading feathered wings—\nEast and west, south and north,\nScorched by drought, beset by floods,\nWater and famine divide the land,\nBranches and leaves wither, yellow,\nLosing their splendor.\nEach bears the other’s burden—\nSecure, long life.\"*\n\nThis is Wei Boyang’s three-character hidden message:\n*\"Entrust\" (委) and \"spirits\" () bear each other—Wei (魏).\n\"Once in a hundred\" (百) is \"white\" (白), and \"white\" (白) with \"person\" (人) bear each other—Bo (伯).\n\"Scorched by drought\" (汤遭旱) leaves no water, an ordeal of \"yang\" (阳); \"beset\" (阨) is \"阝,\" and \"阝\" with \"yang\" (阳) bear each other—Yang (阳).*\nWei Boyang’s intent is most subtle indeed.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Lü Jifu, prefect of Shanzhou, encountered Lü Dongbin at Tianqing Abbey, who took up a brush and inscribed two poems. One read:\n*\"This rustic was once a guest of Tiantai,\nDwelling south of Stone Bridge.\nFather and son, just the two of us,\nLoving song but not clapping.\"*\nLü Jifu’s son-in-law, Yu Zhong, interpreted it thus: *\"Tiantai guest\" is \"guest\" (宾); \"Stone Bridge\" is \"cave\" (洞); \"two mouths\" is Lü (吕); \"loving song but not clapping\" means reciting poetry. The one reciting this poem—could it not be Lü Dongbin?*\nThus do ancient immortals speak to the world: their sole aim is to elucidate the Dao and guide later generations, never seeking to glorify their own names.\n\n**Eulogy and Preface**\nThe *Cantong qi* is crude in diction yet vast in Dao, subtle in speech yet profound in meaning. It arrays the Five Emperors to establish governance, pairing them with the Three Sovereigns to institute order. Though ruler and minister differ in rank, above and below lack fixed standards. Its precepts on governance do not attain great peace; its methods of dietary ingestion cannot confer longevity; learning to nurture nature does not extend lifespan. Yet when it dissects yin and yang, harmonizing their weights; when it aligns the waxing and waning of the sun and moon; when the Eight Trigrams form images; when male and female enact transformation; when hardness and softness, movement and stillness are distinguished like rice and salt—using the *Yijing* as its witness, its intent is most resolute.\n\nThus, annotations were established to transmit it to later worthies—only those who comprehend the great image may attain longevity, strengthen the self, and benefit the body. For this Dao, one must devote particular attention.\n\nThis piece is titled \"Eulogy and Preface,\" being later eulogistic and prefatory words on Master Wei’s book. It is also said: \"Annotations were established to transmit it to later worthies,\" which is clearly not part of Master Wei’s original text. Zhu Xi remarked: \"Some call it a postscript, others a eulogy by Master Wei.\" Examining its content and intent, it appears to be a postscript to the annotations. Peng’s preface states: \"Master Wei secretly showed it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, instructing him to annotate it. Xu concealed his name and composed the annotations. By the time of Emperor Huan, it was again transmitted to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery, whence it circulated in the world.\" This may well be Xu’s own words, though the annotations themselves no longer survive.\n\nPeng Zhenyi said: \"According to various Daoist texts, the three chapters of the *True Contract* were each composed by Master Wei, Xu the Attendant, and Chunyu Shutong.\" This claim is gravely mistaken. Moreover, Master Wei himself states in this text: \"Now I have again compiled and supplemented omissions.\" Thus, it is evident that the work was composed by Master Wei alone. Furthermore, Liu Zhigu, the Tang dynasty Perfected One of Shu, in his *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon*, presented to the Mysterious Lineage, also thoroughly addressed this. The accounts of Xu’s annotations and Chunyu’s transmission thus raise no further doubts.\n\nI have repeatedly pondered this matter, sighing that the ages are too distant to verify what is true or false—all remains unknowable. One evening, in a state of quiescent concentration, it was as if someone whispered in my ear: \"Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong qi*, while Xu the Attendant annotated it. The bamboo slips were disordered, hence the mixture of four-character and five-character lines, as well as prose.\" Startled awake, I reflected on this explanation. The upper chapter contains \"Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Zhun, Meng\"; the middle chapter repeats \"Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Zhun, Meng.\" The upper chapter has \"seven, eight, nine, six\"; the middle chapter repeats \"seven, eight, nine, six.\" The upper chapter states, \"The solar terms set the measure\"; the middle chapter says, \"Carefully observe the solar terms.\" The upper chapter reads, \"Zhen receives geng in the west\"; the middle chapter reads, \"Above Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as zheng.\" Between them, \"wu-ji\" and \"hun-tun\" appear thrice, \"three-five\" and \"dark-moon, new-moon\" appear four times. With such repetition in meaning, the claim that three individuals each composed one chapter may not be entirely baseless. Yet with text and annotations intermingled, it remains unclear which is the original and which the commentary.\n\nI wished to separate the four-character lines, five-character lines, and prose into three distinct sections, so that text and annotations would not be confused, thereby aiding later scholars in their study. However, once the book was completed, it could not be altered. Thus, I record here what I have heard, appending it to the end of the scroll, awaiting the discernment of future sages.\n\n*Elucidations on the Zhouyi Cantong qi*, Scroll Three\n<*Zi* Section, Daoist Category, *Elucidations on the Zhouyi Cantong qi*>\n*Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Resolving Doubts on the Zhouyi Cantong qi Elucidations*\nBy Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty, Upper Chapter\n\nA certain edition reads *kuang* (匡) as *yuan* (垣), while Chen Baoyi’s annotated edition alters it to *weiguo* (围郭) to avoid taboo. \"Turning the hub and aligning the axle\" means that in cultivating the elixir, one must rectify the heart, just as turning the hub requires aligning the axle. The axle lies within the hub to penetrate its spokes, yet it also extends beyond the hub to converge with it. One edition mistakenly renders *zhou* (轴, axle) as *fu* (辐, spoke).\n\nThe \"four trigrams of the female and male\" recapitulate the preceding line—\"Qian and Kun as gateways, Kan and Li as the enclosing frame\"—summarizing these four trigrams. They represent the cauldron, the vessel, and the medicinal substances; the subsequent \"sixty trigrams\" denote the firing times. As the middle chapter states, \"These four are the primordial chaos,\" echoing the earlier line, \"Qian’s firmness and Kun’s yielding, Kan and Li at the forefront.\" Later, it says, \"The sixty trigrams are deployed as a chariot,\" completing the sixty-four trigrams—all of which serve the Dao of our elixir. This is why it is called the *Zhouyi Cantong qi*. One edition incorrectly identifies the \"four trigrams of the female and male\" as Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen.\n\n\"As bellows and pipes, congealing the spirit\": Chen Huizhen’s annotated edition renders this as *hu* (互, mutual). \"Like a charioteer holding the reins and bit, with standards and guiding cords, aligning with the tracks and staying centered to govern externally\" means that, just as a charioteer seated within the carriage controls the horse’s advance and retreat to conform to the guiding cords, so too does this parallel the middle chapter’s \"the dragon and horse are harnessed, the enlightened ruler governs the times.\" An older edition reads, \"Like a craftsman holding the reins and bit with standards,\" but this is incorrect. Earlier scholars, following the error, annotated it as \"like a craftsman adhering to the inked cord and compass, or a charioteer following the bit and tracks,\" which is mistaken.\n\n\"Combined to make sixty\" means that two trigrams are used daily, and in a month of thirty days, they combine to form sixty trigrams. One edition incorrectly reads \"combined to make sixty-four.\" \"Employ them in sequence\": one edition mistakenly renders *yi* (依, follow) as *ru* (如, like).\n\nHaving not yet reached *mei-shuang* refers to the passage below concerning \"from the last day of the lunar month to the dawn of the new moon.\" One edition mistakenly renders *mei* (昧) as *hui* (晦). The reason is that *ji-wei* (既未) denotes the last day of the lunar month, while *mei-shuang* (昧爽) denotes the first day of the new moon. If interpreted as \"from *ji-wei* to *hui-shuang*,\" it would mean \"from the last day of the month to the last dawn of the month,\" which is a gross error in textual meaning.\n\nIn spring and summer, one relies on the inner body, proceeding from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; in autumn and winter, one accords with external application, from *wu* through *xu* and *hai*. This is because when speaking of two trigrams together, the first pertains to spring and summer, from *zi* to *si*, where yang ascends from below; the latter pertains to autumn and winter, from *wu* to *hai*, where yin descends from above. If speaking of only one trigram, a single trigram has but six lines, and when matched with the twelve hours, it falls short by half. Thus, in daily practice, two trigrams must be spoken of together.\n\n\"Attaining its sequence\": one edition mistakenly renders *xu* (序, sequence) as *li* (理, principle).\n\n\"Transformations within\": Zhu Xi’s annotated edition renders *bianhua* (变化) as *shengjiang* (升降, ascent and descent). Another edition reads, \"ascent and descent, transformations within.\"\n\n\"Enveloping\": This adopts the language of the *Wenzi* and *Tongxuan Zhenjing*. An older edition incorrectly reads *baonang* (包囊, wrapping).\n\n\"Using the formless to regulate the formed\" refers to the *zhi* (制) of creation, not the *zhi* of control. The method of the Great Elixir creates existence from non-existence, hence \"using the formless to regulate the formed.\" Some explain it as the *zhi* of control, elucidating that the formless is spirit, mercury, or *li*, while the formed is qi, lead, or *kan*—this is but one interpretation, yet it does not align with Master Wei’s original intent. I have repeatedly examined this and found that, owing to the *Longhu Jing*’s statement of \"mutual regulation of being and non-being, the Vermilion Bird blazing in the void,\" later scholars, without scrutinizing the context, invariably interpret *zhi* as the *zhi* of creation rather than control.\n\nAgain, in the middle chapter, it states, \"The firm and yielding are decided,\" meaning the firm and yielding do not encroach upon one another. Thus, it continues, \"The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting,\" which differs from the later chapter’s meaning of \"the firm and yielding parting ways.\" Some, clinging to the *Longhu Jing*’s statement of \"the firm and yielding contending in balance without encroachment, the blame does not lie with fire but with the censure of earth,\" mistakenly apply the meaning of \"the firm and yielding parting ways\" here. Today, it is commonly held that Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* based on the *Longhu Jing*, and thus could not but follow its doctrines. Yet they do not realize that the *Longhu Jing* merely paraphrases the *Cantong Qi* and was actually written after Master Wei’s work. Zhu Xi remarked, \"Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission included a *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text, generally modeling it on the *Cantong Qi*, though with some misinterpretations.\" I once, not having grasped this, dared not readily accept Zhu Xi’s view. Later, upon repeated reflection and comparative study of the *Cantong Qi*, I came to see the inconsistencies in the *Longhu Jing* and realized it truly was a paraphrase of the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nMaster Wei’s composition of the *Cantong Qi* borrows the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to elucidate the secrets of elixir-making, not to expound upon the *Longhu Jing*. Had he indeed expanded upon the *Longhu Jing*, it should have been called the *Longhu Cantong Qi*, not the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nNevertheless, the *Longhu Jing* is also a fine text. Cai Jitong deeply admired its words, such as, \"The Primordial Sovereign first refines mercury; the spirit chamber embraces emptiness,\" and, \"The essentials of spontaneity: first preserve, then let go\"—truly profound insights. Yet it is not a work predating Master Wei.\n\n\"Implements and vessels\": Li Baosu’s annotated edition reads *zhe* (者, those) as *jie* (皆, all). \"As evidence\": one edition mistakenly renders *zheng* (征) as *zheng* (证).\n\nThe phrase \"相当一本\" should read \"当作合,\" not the reverse. \"始终\" in one edition is mistakenly rendered as \"终始.\" \"皆禀中宫\" in one version reads \"禀作在,\" while another has \"中宫所禀,\" both incorrect. \"之时\" in one edition is altered to \"之际.\" \"统黄化\" in one version reads \"化黄包.\"\n\nIn Zhu Xi’s *Kaoyi*, \"鄞鄂\" is written as \"根鄂,\" where \"鄂\" means \"calyx.\" As the *Book of Songs* states, \"鄂不韡韡,\" this is the correct form of \"鄂.\" Some versions render it as \"垠堮,\" \"圻堮,\" or \"釿锷,\" all incorrect. \"称元皇\" in one edition reads \"称作当.\" \"元年\" in one version is mistakenly written as \"元.\" \"乃芽滋\" appears as \"芽乃生\" in one edition and \"乃牙滋\" in another.\n\nRegarding the line \"复卦建始初,\" some suspected redundancy with \"关睢建始初\" and changed \"初\" to \"萌.\" Zhu Xi noted this as a reckless alteration by those ignorant of ancient rhymes. Similarly, \"九六亦相当\" was suspected of repeating \"刚柔相当\" and thus \"当\" was changed to \"应,\" both incorrect.\n\n\"日月无双明\" means that when the sun rises, the moon sets, and when the moon rises, the sun sets—day and night alternate in their illumination. One edition mistakenly renders \"无\" as \",\" but in ancient texts, \"无\" was used where modern texts use \"無,\" as in the *Yijing*’s \"无妄无咎.\" Another version reads \"焕炳而成双.\"\n\n\"兔者吐生光\" appears as \"兔魄吐精光\" in one edition and \"兔魄吐生光\" in another. \"东方丧其明\" was miswritten as \"东北丧其明\" in an old edition, likely due to the *Yijing*’s phrase \"东北丧朋,\" perpetuating the error through unexamined habit.\n\nExamining the *Yijing*’s *Kun* hexagram: \"西南得朋, 东北丧朋\" refers to the southwest, where *Dui* (west) and *Li* (south) are yin hexagrams, and *Xun* is also yin—thus \"得朋\" (gaining companions). The northeast, however, contains *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Qian*, all yang hexagrams—hence \"丧朋\" (losing companions). Yet Master Wei’s statement, \"坤乙三十日东方丧其明,\" refers to the thirtieth day’s dawn, when the moon sets in the east at the *yi* position, not to the *Kun* hexagram’s \"东北丧朋.\" How is this clarified?\n\nThe western regions *geng* and *xin*, the southern *bing* and *ding*, and the eastern *jia* and *yi* are the six nodes within a month where the moon appears at dusk and sets at dawn—what Wang Baoyi called the \"three shifts of the moon.\" On the third day, the moon appears at dusk in the west at *geng*; by the sixteenth, it sets at dawn in the west at *xin*. On the eighth day, it appears at dusk in the south at *ding*; by the twenty-third, it sets at dawn in the south at *bing*. On the fifteenth day, it appears at dusk in the east at *jia*; by the thirtieth, it sets at dawn in the east at *yi*. The principle is thus evident—how could *yi* be in the northeast?\n\nSince ancient times, *jia* and *yi* have both been placed in the east, not the northeast. If *yi* were in the northeast, why not also call the fifteenth day, when the celestial stems are full, \"盛满甲东北\"? *Jia* is closer to the northeast yet is not called so—how much less *yi*, which precedes *jia* and leans toward the southeast? Clearly, it is not in the northeast.\n\n\"九六亦相当\" was explained above under \"复卦建始初.\" \"易象索灭藏\" refers to the thirtieth night, when the symbols of the sun and moon both sink into the north. One edition mistakenly renders \"易象\" as \"阳.\"\n\n\"象彼仲冬节至以晓后生\" was misplaced in the postscript of an old edition. Chen Baoyi moved it before \"子当右转,\" both incorrect. This passage rhymes with two \"伤\" sounds and, when connected to the earlier \"易象索灭藏,\" also rhymes with two \"藏\" sounds. Ancient writers often used repeated rhymes, but later readers, not understanding this, recklessly altered the text, disrupting its coherence. Examples include \"关睢建始初\" with \"复卦建始初\" and \"刚柔相当\" with \"九六亦相当\"—all repeated rhymes. How could such repetitions be hastily dismissed as errors?\n\n\"商旅\" in one edition reads \"贾作商.\" \"浩广\" in one version is written as \"广作旷.\"\n\n\"眇难睹\" in one edition reads \"睹作觌.\" \"符征\" in one edition reads \"征作证.\" \"节令\" in one edition reads \"节作时.\" \"中稽于人心\" in one edition reads \"心作情.\" \"依卦变\" in one edition reads \"循卦节.\" \"循彖辞\" in one edition reads \"循作因彖作象,\" which is incorrect.\n\n\"乾坤用施行天地然后治\" in one edition reads \"治作理,\" while another reads \"天下然后治.\" These two lines appear to quote the *Qian* hexagram’s \"Qian yuan yong jiu, tianxia zhi\" (When Qian’s primal power is activated through the Nine, all under heaven is well-ordered). However, considering the preceding \"Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun,\" this suggests Kan and Li serve as the functions of Qian and Kun—not the \"yong jiu\" (Nine) or \"yong liu\" (Six). As in the earlier passage \"In the east, its brightness is lost,\" this does not refer to the Kun hexagram’s \"In the northeast, one loses one’s companions.\" Master Wei’s composition of this work largely employs figurative language, and one need not cling rigidly to literal interpretations. \"可不慎乎\" in one edition reads \"可得不慎乎,\" which is incorrect.\n\n\"魁杓\" in one edition reads \"杓作柄.\" \"誃离即别离也\" in one edition reads \"移离,\" while another reads \"坎离.\" \"仰俯\" in other editions reads \"俯仰\"; Zhu Xi noted that \"仰俯\" is the correct reading to preserve the rhyme, and this version follows his emendation. \"统录\" in one edition reads \"统作总.\" \"日含五行精\" in one edition reads \"含作合,\" which is incorrect. \"诘过贻主\" in one edition reads \"结过移主.\" \"辰极处正\" in one edition reads \"处作受,\" while another reads \"正作政.\" \"布政\" in one edition reads \"政德,\" which is incorrect. \"终修\" in one edition reads \"修作循,\" while another reads \"中美.\" \"以掩蔽\" in one edition reads \"以作已.\"\n\nThe presence and absence likewise depend on each other, referring to the mutual reliance of the water and fire *qi* to complete the workings of creation. In some editions, \"有无\" appears as \"金炁\" or \"吟,\" both of which are incorrect. \"进退分布\" in one edition reads \"进退作退而,\" which is incorrect. \"采之白\" in one edition reads \"采作望,\" while another reads \"揺.\" \"白里\" in one edition reads \"包裹.\" \"相扶\" in one edition reads \"扶作拘.\" \"相连\" in one edition reads \"连作通.\"\n\n\"This is not the method of visualizing the Five Viscera\" means that this Dao is not the practice of meditating upon and storing thoughts within the five viscera. If one takes the two characters \"是非\" to mean \"right and wrong,\" one has misunderstood. \"次日辰\" in one edition reads \"次作以,\" which is incorrect. \"累土\" in one edition reads \"周.\" \"而意悦\" in one edition reads \"意悦喜.\"\n\n\"To tread through fire without scorching, to enter water without getting wet\" describes the state after the Dao is accomplished and the Dharma-body is realized. If one were to cast the flesh-and-blood body into water or fire, how could it merely be a matter of scorching or wetting? \"移居\" in one edition reads \"居作名,\" which is incorrect. \"功满\" in one edition reads \"满作成,\" which is incorrect.\n\n\"偃月\" — given that the following text reads \"汞日则偃,\" it is likely that \"铅\" was mistakenly transmitted as \"鼎.\" \"作鼎炉\" in older editions reads \"作法,\" which is incorrect. \"亘亦八\" in one edition reads \"亦如之.\" \"亏明\" in one edition reads \"明作伤.\" \"金本从日生\" — at the new moon, the moon receives the light of the sun, for the moon’s radiance is born from the sun. At the beginning of each month, at dawn, the moon conjoins with the sun. Here, \"金火\" refers to the sun and moon. In older editions, \"日\" appears as \"月,\" which is incorrect. If one were to say that \"金本从月生,\" it would be as if saying \"月本从月生,\" which makes no sense.\n\n\"数称五\" in one edition reads \"数作号.\" \"含育\" in one edition reads \"贪欲.\" \"伫息\" refers to the unification of concentrated stillness and the breath, merging the two into one, like the union of husband and wife. In one edition, \"息\" appears as \"思,\" while in another, it appears as \"恩,\" both of which are incorrect. \"执平\" in one edition reads \"执作气.\"\n\n\"Soil travels through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and adhering to its rules\" — in all editions except Zheng Xu’s, this line appears after \"寿命得长久,\" but in Zheng Xu’s edition, it is placed after \"本性共宗祖.\" \"Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury\" is a direct allusion to the transformation of ordinary cinnabar and mercury, serving as a metaphor for the alchemical process. It does not rely on external objects for comparison or juxtapose internal elements with one another.\n\n\"以黍\" in one edition reads \"黍作粟,\" which is incorrect. \"其卵\" in one edition reads \"卵作子,\" which is incorrect. \"泥汞\" in one edition reads \"汞作澒.\" \"炼飞\" in one edition reads \"飞作治,\" while another reads \"持.\" \"鼓铸\" in one edition reads \"铸作下,\" which is incorrect. \"杂性不同\" in one edition reads \"作种.\"\n\n\"Fortunate chance ultimately fails to meet the sage who alone knows it\" — the Zhu Xi edition lacks these ten characters. \"Engendering doubt\" in one edition reads \"sitting in doubt.\" \"First sketched the Eight Trigrams, emulating Heaven and Earth\" — one edition reads \"first sketched the Eight Trigrams, imaging and emulating Heaven and Earth,\" while another reads \"sketched the Eight Trigrams to emulate Heaven’s diagram\"; both are incorrect. \"Following this\" in one edition reads \"structuring the body.\" \"All sages\" refers to sages without rank; Confucius is one such. One edition reads \"sages and\" instead, which is incorrect. \"Three lords\" in one edition reads \"three sages.\" \"Making it a model\" in one edition reads \"making it sincere.\" \"Establishing this book for the world\" — this refers to the *Cantong Qi*, as the great Dao of the Golden Elixir is formless and traceless, leaving nothing for later generations to emulate. Thus, this book was established for the world, just as the middle chapter’s \"establishing this record\" shares the same meaning. Older editions read \"establishing the *Book of Poetry* for the world,\" which is incorrect. \"Privately considering\" in one edition reads \"awaiting.\" \"Presumptuously pondering\" in one edition reads \"composing this foolishness,\" which is incorrect.\n\nGold accounts for fifteen, and the water number is likewise — this refers to the earlier chapter’s \"upper *kan* trigram’s *dui* number is eight, and the lower *kan* trigram’s *gen* is also eight.\" For the upper *kan* is half a *jin* of metal, and the lower *kan* is half a *jin* of water; when the two *kan* are observed together, they form the number of thirty days in a month, though this differs from the meaning of \"metal within water.\" One edition reads \"gold accounts for fifteen\" as \"the gold number is fifteen.\" Its earth does not enter the two but unites with them; the three substances mutually contain and receive one another, transforming as if by spirit. These three substances are the three elements: metal, water, and earth. Metal and water unite with earth to become one, hence \"three substances mutually containing and receiving.\" If fire were added, it would become five substances. Some interpret the three substances as metal, fire, and wood, and the two as water and fire — such redundancy is far from the ultimate discourse. One edition reads \"its earth\" as \"its three,\" \"the two\" as \"fire two,\" and \"again as water two,\" all of which are incorrect. \"Pounding and refining\" in one edition reads \"casting and smelting.\" \"Achieving perfection and hardness\" in one edition reads \"arriving at\" instead of \"achieving.\"\n\nBeneath, the blazing fire spreads forth, while the roars of dragon and tiger grow ever more urgent—this mirrors the later passage’s \"ascending and roasting in the steamer-mountain, where the blazing fire is set below.\" The White Tiger leads the way, and the Azure Dragon follows in harmony, both conveying the same meaning. Older editions render \"dragon and tiger\" as \"day and night,\" which is incorrect.\n\nAt the outset, the text must be cultivable—one edition reads \"at the very beginning, the text must be cultivable.\" \"Personally witness\" is rendered in one edition as \"mutually intimate,\" and in another as \"must be intimate.\" \"To ingest it\" appears in one edition as \"to grind and lift,\" in another as \"to grind and knead,\" and in yet another as \"to lift and grind\"—all incorrect. \"One pellet\" is written in one edition as \"one origin,\" and in another as \"one grain\"—both incorrect. The *daogui* refers merely to the tip of a knife’s corner, signifying its small quantity. If one interprets the knife as metal and the *gui* as the two earths, the craft may be clever, yet it strays from Master Wei’s original intent.\n\n\"Comparatively concise\" appears in one edition as \"simplified.\" \"Radiant\" is rendered in one edition as \"flourishing\"—incorrect. \"Gradual erosion\" is written in one edition as \"violent erosion.\" \"Manifesting dragon and tiger\" appears in one edition as \"inscribing dragon and tiger.\" \"Auspicious Yellow Sprout\" is written in one edition as \"added Yellow Sprout.\"\n\n**Middle Section**\nIn concert with the workings of creation—one edition reads \"must\" instead of \"in concert,\" and another reads \"at the beginning.\" \"Primal foundation\" appears in one edition as \"mysterious foundation,\" and in another as \"primal mold.\" The sixty hexagrams are employed, spreading forth as a chariot—one edition reads \"encircling\" instead of \"employed,\" which is incorrect. \"Without deviation\" appears in one edition as \"without embankment.\" \"Toppling the precarious state\" is written in one edition as \"toppling the state’s precariousness.\" \"Hexagram days\" appears in one edition as \"hexagram months.\" \"Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own days\" is written in one edition as \"the remaining sixty hexagrams\"—incorrect in meaning. \"Establishing punishments\" is written in an older edition as \"standing punishments.\" \"Celestial stems and earthly branches\" appears in one edition as \"celestial stems and nights.\" \"With focused intent\" is written in one edition as \"treacherous rebels,\" and in another as \"scattering in all directions.\" \"One’s own mouth\" appears in one edition as \"the cauldron.\" \"Its arrival\" is written in one edition as \"the center.\" \"Hard and soft are decisively severed, never intermingling\"—the earlier section speaks of the insubstantial controlling the substantial, which has already been explained below.\n\nBetween the dark of the moon and the new moon, the tally aligns and moves through the center to begin in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. For the dark of the moon and the new moon occur between *hai* and *zi*, when the sun and moon conceal themselves; the region of *Ji* and *Dou* lies between *gen* and *yin*, where the sun and moon begin their revolution. This is used to illustrate the subtlety of the elixir method, which follows the same path as heaven and earth, sun and moon. Some, however, directly take the period between *gen* and *yin* as the time between the dark and new moon, when the first yang arises and the medicine is gathered—yet this is far from the mark.\n\nTurning to the right and revolving, the wheel of fire vomits forth its sprouts: when the yang fire revolves from the waist through *Dou* and *Ji* upward to the *Xuan* Pass, its radiance shines beyond the curtains. One edition reads \"turning to the left\" instead of \"turning to the right.\" Above *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the omen—this refers to the moon’s first appearance in the west, its form like *Zhen*, used to illustrate the fire phases within the body. If one were to discuss the moon’s rising position according to the directions of the *Xiantian* Eight Trigrams, then *Zhen* of the *Xiantian* is not in the west, nor is the fire-phase *Zhen* in the west. Failing to recognize its true locus, one merely sees the contradictions in the explanations.\n\n\"Harmonious peace\" appears in one edition as \"initial peace.\" \"Its unity\" appears in one edition as \"yin unity.\"\n\nSix Five of *Kun* denotes the thirty-day period—this is not referring to the sixth line of the *Kun* hexagram. When the yang numbers have reached their term, they then recommence. Following the emotions to align with nature, they turn and unite. All editions place this under \"the compass and square of the Dao,\" except for Master Zhu’s edition, which places it under \"the mother of the world\"—this is incorrect.\n\n\"Circulating through the six lines\"—one edition reads *liu* as *zhang*—incorrect.\n\"Difficult to\"—one edition reads *yi* as *ke*.\n\"Flourishing\"—one edition reads *zhang* as *heng*.\n\"Generating radiance\"—one edition reads *sheng* as *zheng*—incorrect.\n\"Gradually advancing\"—one edition reads *jian* as *jin*.\n\"Completing *Tai*\"—one edition reads *cheng* as *cheng* (to bear).\n\"Moving\"—one edition reads *er* as *yi*.\n\"Elm pods\"—one edition reads *jia* as *ye*—incorrect.\n\"Vibrating and seeking\"—one edition reads *suo* as *jing*.\n\nYang ends in the center of *Si*, interacting—this refers to the fourth month, which belongs to *Ji*, corresponding to the *zhonglü* pitch. Master Xiashan, Zhan Gu, in his annotated edition, writes *zhong* as *zhonglü*—one edition writes *zhong* as *wu*—incorrect. *Wu* serves as the guest; one edition reads it as the host.\n\n\"Withdrawing from the world and relinquishing position\"—one edition reads *qu wei* as *qu shi wei*—incorrect.\n\"Its essence\"—one edition reads *qi* as *zhen*.\nYin expands while yang contracts, damaging name and reputation—this refers to the seventh month, which belongs to *Shen*, corresponding to the *yize* pitch. *Shen* is expansion, *yi* is injury. An old edition writes \"damaging\" as \"submerging yang\"; one edition writes \"submerging\" as \"extolling\"—both incorrect.\n\"Dissipating and vanishing\"—one edition reads *mie* as *xi*—incorrect.\n\"Utmost spirit\"—one edition reads *zhi* as *qi*; one edition reads *shen* as *kun*.\n\n\"Decline and flourishing\"—one edition reads *shuai* as *geng*—incorrect.\n\"Serving and attending\"—one edition reads *cheng* as *yong*.\n\"For a thousand autumns\"—one edition reads *qiu* as *zai*.\n\"Utterly none\"—one edition reads *wu* as *yuan*—incorrect.\n\"Flowing and spreading\"—one edition reads *liu* as *yun*.\n\"Like a chicken’s egg, to the flesh smooth as maltose\"—an old edition misplaces this phrase, likely having mistakenly transposed it for the sake of rhyme; it has now been corrected. \"Like\"—one edition reads *xiang* as *zhuang*. \"Supporting\"—one edition reads *fu* as *fu* (talisman). \"Complete\"—one edition reads *ju* as *ju* (both). \"As maltose\"—an old edition reads *yi* as *qian*; Master Zhu’s edition corrects it to *yi*.\n*Jin* and *e* were explained in the preceding section.\n\"Constantly\"—one edition reads as *zhu gu*; one edition reads as *zhu wan*; one edition reads as *zhu yuan*.\n\"At this time, emotions harmonize with Heaven and Earth\"—one edition reads *yuan chu zhi shi you hu qian kun*.\n\"Constrained, then water settles\"—one edition reads *ze shui ding huo wu xing zhi chu*. \"The Dao has no form or image\"—an old edition reads *wu* as *zhi*, for in antiquity the character *wu* (無) was written similarly to *zhi* (之), and in cursive script they resemble each other, leading to the error. One edition reads *xiang* as *zhuang*.\n\"The True One is difficult to depict\"—one edition reads *yi* as *qi*.\n\"Utmost suspension\"—one edition reads as *xuan qie*—incorrect.\n\nThe ear, eye, and mouth are the Three Treasures—one edition reads \"the treasures of the ear, eye, and self,\" which is incorrect. \"Exalting\"—one edition reads *tong* for *yang*. \"Seeing and observing\"—one edition reads *ting* for *lan*. \"Accord with the primordial chaos\"—one edition reads \"accord *with* the primordial.\" \"Thought after thought\"—an old edition reads \"no thought.\" \"Verification shifts of itself\"—an old edition reads \"verification is difficult to shift,\" which is incorrect. \"*Jin* with\"—one edition reads \"with *jin*.\" \"Penetrating the boundless\"—one edition reads *run* for *dong*, which is incorrect. \"Within the valley\"—one edition reads \"Central Palace\"; one edition reads \"within the vessel,\" both of which are incorrect. \"Relying on the staff\"—one edition reads \"leaning on the staff.\" \"Submerged in water\"—one edition reads *tou* for *mo*. \"Obtaining millet\"—one edition reads the second *huo* for the first. \"No merit seen\"—one edition reads \"not\" as \"none.\" \"Utmost simplicity\"—one edition reads *shi* for *zhi*, which is incorrect, for in cursive script *zhi* (至) and *shi* (事) resemble each other.\n\n\"Then they interlock, swallow, chew, and devour one another\"—the old edition, Peng Zhenyi’s annotation, and the Southern Song Liu Yongnian edition all place these lines under \"the loving mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness.\" Master Zhu states: \"Now, upon examination, these two lines naturally belong to the following passage, 'all mutually covet and merge,' where the four lines form a continuous sequence of meaning and should not be here.\" This humble commentator observes: this chapter uses the affection between mother and child as a metaphor, for the phrase \"then they interlock and swallow\" signifies the young crow repaying its mother, and thus it properly belongs here. Now, following the old edition, it is moved to its correct position.\n\n\"Three and five become one\"—this refers to the preceding section’s *zi-wu* numbers combining: three *wu* and five *ji* numbers. It differs from the *Three-Five Unity* in the *Wuzhen Pian*. One edition reads *yu* for *wei*, which is incorrect.\n\n\"The child should turn right\"—this means the tiger is born within water. \"Noon revolves eastward\"—this means the dragon emerges from within fire. *Zi* and *wu* are water and fire. \"The child should turn right\" refers to the conjunction of metal and water, turning right to reach *zi*. \"Noon revolves eastward\" refers to wood and fire as companions, revolving eastward to reach *wu*. The Dao of returning cinnabar follows the same pattern as the celestial Dao of left-revolving and right-turning. If one says *zi* turns right to reach *you* and *wu* revolves eastward to reach *mao*, this would be right-revolving and left-turning, opposing the celestial Dao. \"Eastward revolving\"—one edition reads *zuo* for *dong*. \"Host and guest\"—one edition reads *ding* for *ke*. \"Coveting and merging\"—one edition reads *bian* for *bing*; one edition reads *rong*, both of which are incorrect.\n\nEach attains its nature—one edition reads *you* for *de* and *gong* for *xing*. \"Ascertaining\"—one edition reads *you* for *shen*. \"Attains the correct Dao\"—one edition reads *wei* for *cheng*. \"The father bestows and grants\"—one edition reads *sheng* for *zhu*, which is incorrect. \"The hen\"—one edition reads *fei* for *pin*. \"The Dao of transformation\"—one edition reads *gong* for *dao*, and another reads *jing*, both of which are incorrect. \"At the inception of receiving qi\"—one edition reads *yuan* for *zhi*. \"Daily transformation, monthly change\"—this borrows from Zhuangzi’s phrasing; one edition reads *ri shou yue hua*, which is incorrect. Another suspects *ri shou yue hua* contradicts principle and thus alters it to *yue shou ri hua*, which is also incorrect. \"The nature of water is all-encompassing\"—one edition reads *he rong* for *zhou zhang*. \"Wood and fire as companions\"—this means the dragon emerges from within fire, with three in the east and two in the south together forming five. \"The conjunction of metal and water\"—this means the tiger is born toward water, with one in the north and four in the west completing it. Zhang Ziyang’s statement that the four images do not depart from the two bodies precisely refers to this. Some later interpretations, placing *li* of the Earlier Heaven sequence after *zhen* and *dui* of the Later Heaven to elucidate this, not only miss Master Wei’s original intent but also contradict the great process of inner transformation. One edition reads *jin mu* for *jin shui* and *shui huo* for *mu huo*, which is gravely mistaken. \"Arranged\"—one edition reads *he* for *lie*, and another reads *yin*. \"The heart is red, thus female\"—one edition omits these four characters.\n\n\"At *zi*, the Five Phases begin\"—one edition omits these four characters; another reads *ju* for *zi*. \"Establishing the weft\"—one edition reads *wei* as *position*. \"*Xu* and *Wei*\"—one edition reads *embracing the true*. \"Grasping fire\"—one edition reads *descending to sit*. \"Harmonizing\"—one edition reads *grasping fire*. \"Indulging vain hopes\"—one edition reads *hoping for expectations*.\n\n**Lower Section**\nOnly the sages and worthies of old embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true, deeply pitying later generations who loved the Dao. Following the currents of influence, they inscribed ancient texts and composed diagrams and scriptures to enlighten posterity, revealing branches while concealing roots. This means that the sages of antiquity, having attained the Dao and embraced the mysterious while holding fast to the true, pitied those of later generations who loved the Dao yet could not grasp its teachings. Thus, they followed the currents of influence, citing antiquity to validate the present, composing diagrams and scriptures to instruct them. Yet they dared not expound it too directly, so they employed the designations of the Five Metals and Eight Stones to elucidate it. The so-called composition of diagrams and scriptures under the guise of various stones refers to the sages of old acting thus—not to those of later generations who loved the Dao. In this chapter, Peng Zhen and Chen Baoyi both misunderstood this; only Master Zhu’s commentary correctly grasped its meaning.\n\n\"Three Origins\"—one edition reads *light* for *origin*, which is incorrect. \"Essence overflows\"—one edition reads *fluids*, which is incorrect.\n\n\"Transforming form\"—one edition reads *transform* as *change*, which is incorrect. \"Overturning and distorting numerous texts\" means to repeatedly confuse and disorder their words rather than daring to leak them directly. One edition reads *distort* as *conceal*, which is incorrect. \"Transmitted through the ages\"—one edition reads *transmit* as *raise*. \"Not serving\"—one edition reads *serving* as *thus*. \"Thus producing disordered words\"—one edition reads *producing* as *not*, which is incorrect. \"Mysterious channel\"—one edition reads *channel* as *distant*. \"Retreating from behind\"—an old edition reads *behind* as *reform*, which is incorrect.\n\n\"Bolts and bars rise and fall\"—*the heavens in their circuit* then rush forth. In old editions, both characters for *the heavens in their circuit* were written as *zhou-hai*; Master Zhu suspected *zhou-hai* lacked coherent meaning and thus emended it to *harm qi*, which is also incorrect. The character *harm* resembles *zhou*, while *hai* is quite close to *heaven*.\n\n\"The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers never run dry\"—*water flows into the sea*. An old edition reads *not* for *into*, which is incorrect. The error of *not* for *into* was explained in detail under \"the Dao has no form\" in the middle section. One edition reads *Yellow River* as *Huai River*. \"Ending and returning to the beginning\"—one edition reads *returning to the beginning and ending*; another reads *returning to renew the beginning*. \"Spread forth\"—one edition reads *forth* as *establish*. \"White Tiger\"—one edition reads *Tiger* as *alum*, which is incorrect. \"Azure Dragon\"—one edition reads *Dragon* as *fluid*, which is incorrect. \"Pressing and halting\"—one edition reads *halting* as *into*. \"Dragon’s scales, armor, and mane\"—one edition reads *Dragon* as *fish* and *armor* as *frivolous*, which is incorrect. \"Joining and linking\"—one edition reads *linking* as *jumbled*. \"Guarding one another\"—one edition reads *one another* as *and thus.\"\n\nThe Chamber-Six—one edition reads *Six* as *Seven*, which is incorrect. *Upright Yang*—one edition reads *Yang* as *Yin*, which is incorrect. \"The Three and Five converge with Danger as one, all gathering in one place\"—this refers to the qi of Chamber-Six, Strung-Seven, Extended-Two, and Three Directions merging with the North’s Danger-One, all assembling and returning to a single locus. At its core lies the workings of creation: the Southern Extended and Northern Danger correspond to the moon, while the Eastern Chamber and Western Pleiades correspond to the sun. Danger-One combined with Chamber-Six forms the generative and completive numbers of Water; Extended-Two combined with Strung-Seven forms the generative and completive numbers of Fire. Chamber-Six in the East and Extended-Two in the South—Wood and Fire as companions—combine Six and Two to make Eight. Pleiades-Seven in the West and Danger-One in the North—Metal and Water in union—combine Seven and One to make Eight, corresponding to the weight of two eights as one jin. This is what is meant by \"rooted in but two things.\" One edition reads *converge with Danger as one* as *converge to become one*; another reads *as one* as *with one*—both are incorrect. Another edition reads *one place* as *two places*, which is also incorrect. One must recognize that in Master Wei’s composition of this work, not a single phrase fails to accord with the workings of creation. If one were to suppose that \"the Three and Five with the One all gather in two places,\" where then would the workings of creation reside? Moreover, the notion of \"two places\" is especially egregious. Even if one were to insist on calling it \"two places,\" one should speak of *division* rather than *gathering*; if speaking of *gathering*, one should speak of *one place* rather than *two places*.\n\n*Qu-fu*—Jiaxia Mountain’s commentary reads *Fu-qu*. \"Crimson hue penetrating inner and outer\"—one edition reads *crimson-black penetrating inner and outer*. *Millet grain*—one edition reads *millet* as *rice*, which is incorrect. \"If the qi of mountains and marshes steams forth\"—one edition reads *the qi of mountains and marshes mutually steams forth*, which is incorrect. *For a hundred million generations*—one edition reads *generations* as *eras*. *And may be examined*—one edition reads *and* as *of itself*. *Heart-spirit*—one edition reads *heart* as *defense*. *Suddenly self-awakens*—one edition reads *suddenly* as *abruptly*. *Receiving the celestial charts*—one edition reads *charts* as *records of celestial charts*, which is incorrect.\n\n*Tripod Vessel Song*: \"Diameter of one fen\"—an old edition reads *diameter* as *ten*. \"Length of one chi two\"—one edition reads *one chi two* as *two chi*, which is incorrect.\n\nThe abdomen’s *qi*-alignment—Zhu Xi notes that *qi* (齐) is the ancient form of *navel* (脐); one edition reads *five qi-alignments* (五齐), which is incorrect. \"Head and tail are *wu*, the center is *wen*\"—this refers to the new and full moons as head and tail, and the full moon as the center. Head and tail are thus one realm, and the center is likewise one realm. If one claims that *si* (巳) is yang and *zi* (子) is the tail, *wu* (午) is yin and *hai* (亥) is the head, with *si* and *wu* facing each other as the center, then there would be two heads and tails and two centers. Another interpretation holds that when advancing yang fire, *zi* (子), *chou* (丑), and *yin* (寅) form the head, while *chen* (辰) and *si* (巳) form the tail; when retreating yin符, *wu* (午), *wei* (未), and *shen* (申) form the head, while *xu* (戌) and *hai* (亥) form the tail, with the central palace as the center—thus two heads, two tails, and one center. Neither interpretation is sound.\n\n*Two sevens gather*—one edition reads *gather* as *orifice* (窍), which is incorrect.\n*Examining the brain’s principles*—one edition reads *examining* (赡) as *gazing* (瞻), another as *gallbladder* (胆), both incorrect.\n\n**Preface**\nThe *Three Correlations* (三相䚸) refer to the mutual resemblance in yin-yang transformation among the *Great Change* (易), the *Yellow and Lao* (黄老), and furnace fire. Since Peng Zhenyi depicted the five phases with wood as three, fire as two, earth as five, metal as four, and water as one—forming a diagram of *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony*—later generations all followed Peng’s interpretation, mistakenly attributing it to Wei Boyang’s original text and conflating it with the *correlation of the five phases* (五行之相䚸). This error has persisted to this day without correction. Yet none have considered what Wei Boyang truly meant by *correlation*. Moreover, the *Change*’s *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony* refers to the harmonization of the five phases’ generating and completing numbers. Peng’s system uses only the generating numbers—how can this be called *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony*? Some argue that wood as three and fire as two form one five, metal as four and water as one form another five, with central earth as five completing three fives—this might still be called *three fives correlated* (三五相䚸). But to speak of the *correlation of the five phases* (五行之相䚸) is untenable, for water is one, fire is two, and the numbers of metal, wood, and earth each differ—how can they be correlated? One edition reads *mutually correlated* (互相䚸), which is somewhat plausible, though far less clear than the *Three Correlations*.\n\nExamining the subsequent text, it states: *\"The Three Ways emerge from the One, sharing the same path\"* and *\"Arrayed as three branches, stems interconnected, differing in name yet issuing from one gate\"*—the meaning of *Three Correlations* is thus unmistakably evident.\n\n*Guo of Kuai*—Wei Boyang’s self-reference. Wei was from Shangyu in Guiji; by calling it *Guo of Kuai* instead of Guiji, he avoided revealing his native place. To read it directly as Guiji would be a later emendation, not Wei’s original wording.\n\n*Embracing simplicity*—one edition reads *embracing simplicity and holding purity* (怀朴抱素).\n*Unfond of power and glory*—meaning he refused to delight in power and glory. *Delight* (乐) should be read in the departing tone; one edition reads *power* (权) as *joy* (欢), which is incorrect.\n*Profit and fame*—one edition reads *profit* (利) as *command* (令).\n*Leisurely dwelling in seclusion*—one edition reads *distant traveler in leisure* (远客燕闲).\n*Observing his inclinations*—one edition reads *inclinations* (所) as *purport* (旨).\n*Shared principles*—one edition reads *principles* (伦) as *discourse* (论).\n*Disseminating transformation*—one edition reads *disseminating* (施) as *spiritual* (神).\n*Returning to the root*—one edition reads *root* (根) as *foolish* (愚), which is incorrect.\n*My heart*—one edition reads *heart* (心) as *form* (形).\n*Eight minerals*—one edition reads *eight* (八) as *five* (五).\n*Perfecting things*—one edition reads *things* (物) as *achievement* (功).\n\nThe text \"Committing to the times, departing from harm, relying on hills and mountains, roaming the vast expanse, neighboring with spirits\" through \"securely attaining long life\"—these sixteen phrases encapsulate the three characters of Wei Boyang. \"Each mutually bearing\" refers to: *committing to spirits* mutually bearing forms *Wei*; *people* and *white* mutually bearing forms *Bo*; *阝* and *sun* mutually bearing forms *Yang*. One edition reads *spirits* (鬼) as *immortals* (仙), *narrow pass* (阨) as *calamity* (厄). \"Each mutually bearing, securely attaining long life\" is rendered as \"Auspicious people mutually bearing, peacefully attaining long life.\" Another edition reads: \"Auspicious people mutually bearing, securely attaining long life.\" Both are incorrect. Yet another edition reads *east, west, south, and slanting* (东西南倾) as *east, west, south, and north* (东西南北), and *drought and flood* (水旱) as *drought, flood, and warfare* (水旱兵革).\n\n**Eulogy and Preface**\n*Establishing governance*—one edition reads *governing the realm* (御极).\n*Rice and salt*—this adopts the language of the *Tianguan Shu* in the *Records of the Grand Historian*. \"Rice and salt\" signifies clear division, like black and white.

Yan’s *Collected Explanations of the Zhou Changes* has already been recorded. This work expounds the Dao of cinnabar elixirs through the water and fire, yin and yang of the human body. Though it does not match the specialized Daoist scholarship of the three commentaries by Peng Xiao, Chen Xianwei, and Chen Zhixu, its sources are exceedingly broad. Its three chapters of *Resolving Doubts* examine discrepancies and similarities, surpassing even Zhu Xi’s edition in thoroughness and clarity.\n\nThe *Catalogue of the Daoist Canon* by Yunji Daolu states that the two works together comprise fourteen *juan*, while Jiao Hong’s *Bibliographic Treatise of the History of the Realm* records twelve *juan*. Mao Jin’s *Treasured Writings from the Ford of Jin* combines Yan’s commentary with the three commentaries of Xiao and the others into a single compilation, deviating from the original. Moreover, it omits *Resolving Doubts*, which has since been lost. This edition includes illustrations in every *juan* and was printed in the third year of the Zhida era (1310) by Zhang Yufeng, the succeeding Celestial Master. It consists solely of three *juan* of *Elucidations*, with one *juan* of *Resolving Doubts* appended.\n\nAn examination of Yan’s preface to *Other Writings on the Changes* also describes the oral instructions of the cinnabar Dao as meticulously preserved in the three chapters of *Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*. The record in Yunji Daolu may have conflated this work with others, while Jiao Hong’s account appears to have been copied and distorted from other sources, rendering it increasingly unreliable.\n\nRespectfully submitted in the sixth month of the forty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign (1780).\n**Chief Compilers:**\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Feixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi",

      "translated_text": "**Chief Collators:**\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Preface to the Reprinted *Elucidations on the Uniting of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes***\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Changes*, it began with Fuxi, who received the *Hetu* and drew the trigrams. King Wen expanded them and appended the hexagram statements; the Duke of Zhou extended the six positions to determine fortune and misfortune and appended the line statements. Confucius, following the *Great* and *Lesser Images*, composed the *Ten Wings*. Its fundamental principle lies in the *taiji*: when it moves, it generates yang; when it rests, it generates yin. Once the Two Modes are divided, the Four Images are established. Movement and stillness mutually serve as their root, giving rise to the Five Phases. Through the interplay of yin and yang, odd and even, the Eight Trigrams are formed. The Yellow Emperor commanded Da Rao to create the *jiazi* cycle: its ten stems and twelve branches merely explore the nature of the Five Phases, yet they too do not depart from the directional positions of the Eight Trigrams. When trigrams are doubled, they become sixty-four hexagrams; when divided, they yield three hundred eighty-four lines. Thus, there is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Earth, and the Dao of Man. With the Dao of the Three Powers complete, all things filling Heaven and Earth possess principle, qi, image, and number. Their waxing and waning, advance and retreat, preservation and destruction—none fall outside the sage’s compass, for he discerns and comprehends their underlying causes. Therefore, the *Book of Changes* is vast and all-encompassing. By means of it, teachings are established, and the methods of calendrical calculation and divination are founded upon the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams, sufficient to disclose things and accomplish tasks, thereby guiding the people. Indeed, the *Changes* is for the counsel of the noble person—how can one not employ it?\n\nYet the world does not embody the ceaseless movement of Heaven and Earth, does not explore the mutual generation and restraint of the Five Phases, nor follow the ebb and flow of hexagrams and lines. Acting recklessly, they fail to return to themselves, unaware of what cultivation and refinement entail. Few are those who preserve their seven-foot bodies and return them whole. How much less can they hope for longevity and enduring vision amidst Heaven and Earth?\n\nThose of the immortal lineage who attain longevity and enduring vision do so through the Dao of the returned elixir. However, the immortals of antiquity necessarily possessed esoteric transmission and oral instruction; their secret formulas were seldom lightly disclosed. Thus, few accounts of them exist in the world. Some, not following the great Dao but relying on private cleverness, claim that crooked shortcuts are easily traversed or that heterodox byways lead to attainment. The worst of them consume desiccating medicines, drink noxious drafts, and ingest poisonous pellets, mistaking them for divine elixirs—only to lose their lives and forfeit their years. How can they preserve longevity?\n\nBy the Later Han, Wei Boyang recognized that the Dao of the returned elixir must not be led astray by perverse doctrines but must be rooted in the Dao of the *Changes*. For the Dao of the *Changes* encompasses the mechanism of yin and yang, movement and stillness, and embraces the marvel of hexagram and line transformation—ceaselessly generating, endlessly transforming. Now, when we turn inward to observe our bodies, are they not also a Heaven and Earth? The primordial qi we receive is none other than the qi of Heaven and Earth. If Heaven and Earth endure, why can we not emulate them?\n\nThis is why the *Cantong qi* was composed. *Can* means to consult the *Changes* and find no error; *tong* means to align with the *Changes* and find no discrepancy; *qi* means to silently comprehend and naturally preserve the *Changes*. Formerly, I heard that the immortals of old possessed the method of refining the elixir. Once the elixir was completed, one could ascend in flight, achieving longevity. Thus, the famous mountains and scenic places of the world all bear the strange traces of furnaces and crucibles. Alas! The odd stones in the mountains that occasionally resemble furnaces and crucibles are but coincidences. Upon reading this book, I realized that the notion of refining the elixir in furnaces and crucibles is delusion. The teachings of the immortals on guiding and refining cultivation operate within; they do not rely on external means. What is taken lies within oneself; it does not depend on...",

      "translated_text": "What is sought lies within oneself, not in external things. Gold, for instance, is prized for its purity—unmixed, unadulterated. Without refining it with lead and mercury through fire, how could one attain its true essence, its unyielding hardness, to form the elixir and emulate the immortality of Heaven and Earth? Now, the *Cantong qi* borrows this principle: it takes the Qian and Kun of one’s body as the crucible, the Kan and Li—the sun and moon—as the medicinal ingredients. By concentrating the spirit and gathering the *qi*, causing the Dragon and Tiger to unite in essence and interact, advancing the fire phases to await their transformations, the Dao of the elixir may be accomplished.\n\nYet this book, though examined and annotated by Master Zhu Ziyang, still leaves many doubts unresolved. Though it provides a thread of understanding, the very materials and apertures remain obscure—how much more so for those beneath Master Zhu’s level of insight? In the Zhiyuan era, Master Yuyu, Quanyangzi, first delved deeply into this text. Initially, he failed to grasp its subtleties, finding it exceedingly difficult. Only through long accumulation of effort and unwavering faith did enlightenment come as if by divine revelation. Thereafter, he gathered the secret formulas of various perfected ones and compared them with this book, finding no discrepancy with the teachings of the *Changes*. Thus, he expounded upon this work, adding annotations that illuminated the Dao of the elixir as clearly as pointing to one’s palm.\n\nYet while the method of the returned elixir is said to be supremely simple and easy—accessible to all—it is also spoken of as requiring three years and nine cycles, appearing easy but proving difficult in truth. It demands prolonged dedication. Therefore, those who study the Dao in hopes of becoming immortals must not measure it hastily or glimpse it superficially. They must seek its doors and windows, examine its gates and pivots, wield the bellows and key, advance the fire phases, and guard the Dragon and Tiger until their union. Then the Yellow Sprout will grow of itself, the Jade Flower will manifest, and the Dao of the returned elixir will be within reach.\n\nWith this, one may ascend in flight, achieve eternal existence, ride the long clouds between the eight poles, and brave the fierce winds of the nine heavens—utterly severed from the world, dwelling in the divine isles, forever ascending the immortal’s throne. Once in a hundred generations, one descends to wander among mortals, bestowing long life and salvation, while none can fathom their whereabouts. Looking down upon the ephemeral world, where mayflies flicker in the morning and gnats rise and fall, it is truly not worth even a laugh.\n\n*Preface to the* Elucidation of the *Cantong qi*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Elucidation of the* Cantong qi*, Volume One*\n*Upper Chapter*\n*By Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty*",

      "translated_text": "The Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Closing the door is called Kun; opening the door is called Qian. One closing and one opening is called *change*; endless coming and going is called *communication*—this is why Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*. Qian gives birth to three sons; Kun gives birth to three daughters. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born—this is why Qian and Kun are the father and mother of all hexagrams.\n\nThe human body models Heaven and emulates Earth, sharing the same yin and yang as Heaven and Earth. If one understands that this body shares the same yin and yang with Heaven and Earth, then one may discuss the Dao of the returned elixir.\n\nKan and Li form the encompassing frame, turning the wheel with the axle as its center. Kan is the moon; Li is the sun. The sun and moon travel along the ecliptic, circulating endlessly day and night, like the revolving frame of a wheel. The hub is like the body; the axle is like the heart. If one wishes the hub to turn, one must align the axle. For those who cultivate the returned elixir, circulating the sun and moon within their body to follow the same path as Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations—how could they not rectify their heart?\n\nThe four hexagrams of the female and male serve as the bellows and pipe, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang, just as a charioteer holds the reins and bit with precision, adhering to the guiding line, following the tracks, maintaining the center to regulate the exterior. The numbers are recorded in the calendar’s monthly nodes: five or six weave the warp and weft, serving the sun to combine into sixty. Hard and soft have their inner and outer aspects. At dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs; at dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, used in sequence. Before reaching the dim light of dawn, the cycle ends and begins anew.\n\nQian is the pure yang, male hexagram; Kun is the pure yin, female hexagram. Kan contains yang within yin; Li contains yin within yang—these are the hexagrams of female and male union. The elixir method positions Qian and Kun above and below, arranges Kan and Li to the east and west, so that the opening and closing of Qian and Kun, the coming and going of Kan and Li, resemble the form of bellows and pipe. Thus it is said: \"The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipe.\" The bellows and pipe are empty vessels—the bellows is the leather sack, the pipe its tube. The *Daodejing* of Laozi states: \"Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows?\" Empty yet inexhaustible, moving yet ever-producing. The great void’s vastness resembles the body of the bellows; the opening and closing, coming and going of qi resemble its function. Knowing this, one has grasped more than half of the Dao of the returned elixir.\n\nYet this Dao exists when grasped and perishes when released. Therefore, one must guard one’s inner realm and restrain one’s outer conduct, as in the *Liezi: Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing*, which speaks of the charioteering of the Taidou clan. Only then may one engage in this practice. For the charioteering of the Taidou clan is to harmonize the reins and bit with utmost precision, adjusting swiftly or slowly as needed.",

Between palm and grasp, the center is inwardly attained, and outwardly, the horse’s will is met. Thus can one advance and retreat as if treading a taut line, or turn and curve as if compass and square. The method of refining the elixir is likewise.\n\nThe numbers in the *lü* and calendric reckonings circulate through twelve positions: twelve pitches of the *lü* correspond to twelve months, and twelve years to a cycle. The monthly nodes of five and six arise from dividing a thirty-day month into six nodes. The warp is the fixed positions of Qian and Kun, north and south; the weft is the subtle workings of Kan and Li, east and west. The \"servant of the sun\" follows the sun’s command, its timing moving in perfect accord with the heavens, rising and setting without the slightest deviation.\n\nThe combination yields sixty: the *Book of Changes* has sixty-four hexagrams, but excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, exactly sixty remain. Each day has twelve hours, with two hexagrams governing affairs, each line corresponding to one hour—two hexagrams totaling twelve lines, matching the numbers of the *lü* and calendric reckonings. Combined with a thirty-day month, this yields sixty hexagrams. Arranging sixty hexagrams within a thirty-day month, at dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* governs the morning and *Meng* the evening; day and night’s twelve hours precisely correspond to two hexagrams and twelve lines. From there, morning *Xu* and evening *Song*, morning *Shi* and evening *Bi*, follow in sequence until the month’s end, when *Jiji* and *Weiji* are used. From dark moon to new moon, the cycle repeats endlessly. Within these hexagrams, the inner and outer, hard and soft bodies may reverse or oppose one another—none of this need be rigidly adhered to.\n\nAs Zhang Ziyang’s *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Herein grasp the meaning, seek not the image;\nTo exhaust the lines is but to labor in vain.\"*\nFor the sixty hexagrams are not rigidly assigned within a thirty-day month.\n\nSome, failing to comprehend this principle, cling to the doctrine of hexagram images, asserting that two hours of the day serve as the firing times, meticulously measuring the weight of lines to gauge the qi’s timing. Day and night, they anxiously watch the sundial and water clock—how grievously mistaken!\n\nThe sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness vary in earliness and lateness. Chen Niju’s *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"The heavens clearly divide twelve forms; all take them as the program for elixir refinement.\"* This refers to the sun and stars as the measure. The sun is fire; the stars are the timing. If one can reverse the heavens’ sun and stars to seek them within the body, then the position of the sun’s arrival becomes the hour. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"To refine the medicine, know dawn and dusk\"*—this refers to movement and stillness varying in earliness and lateness. Movement is rising at sunrise to work; stillness is resting at sunset. Within our own bodies, there is naturally a sunrise and sunset, early and late. The firing times and movements of stillness and activity all secretly align with the celestial measures, none but using the pivot of the heavens and the tides of time as the moments for inner work.\n\nIn spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; in autumn and winter, employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Hexagrams have six lines: the lower three are inner, the upper three outer. Take, for example, the morning use of *Zhun* and evening use of *Meng*. Morning *Zhun* is the time of yang fire’s ascent, and *Zhun*’s *chujiu* line corresponds to *zi* within the body, moving from inner to outer—hence *\"in spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen* and *si*.\"* Evening *Meng* is the time of yin tally’s descent, and *Meng*’s *shangjiu* line corresponds to *wu* within the body, moving from outer to inner—hence *\"in autumn and winter, employ the outer, from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*.\"*\n\nYet the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter; *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *hai*; and the doctrines of inner body and outer use are all metaphors. If one rigidly adheres to images and texts, practicing hexagram qi, one merely grasps Qian and Kun as the crucible, kneads the crow and hare as medicine, and cooks them—how could this refer to the Qian and Kun outside the body, the crow and hare outside the body? The seeker must seek them within the body.\n\nNow, the celestial positions...",

Therefore, one must guard one’s inner realm and restrain one’s outer conduct, as in the *Liezi: Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing*, which speaks of the charioteering of the Taidou clan.

      "translated_text": "Above lies the position of earth, below the two qi circulate—ascending and descending in endless alternation, like a bellows. Man, born of harmonious qi between heaven and earth, shares the same original body with them. If one awakens to the bellows’ marvel of heaven and earth, this heart becomes empty, still, and serene, and qi naturally flows throughout above and below. When it opens, qi issues forth; when it closes, qi enters in. Qi issuing forth resembles earth qi ascending; qi entering resembles heaven qi descending. Thus may one equal heaven and earth in longevity.\n\nMaster Zihua said: \"The ancients who understood the Dao built ramparts to guard against the perverse and dammed the source to nurture the true. Dwelling in seclusion, undisturbed by things, they regulated their breath to unite with spirit and qi. Guarding the po, observing precepts, they sealed their senses, focused without distraction—thus true qi was preserved. Above and below, it irrigated; qi flowed unimpeded, like water’s current, like the sun and moon’s ceaseless motion. Yin nourished the viscera; yang fortified the bowels. The source flowed abundantly, full yet not overflowing, balanced yet not brimming—this is called long life.\"\n\nTo abandon this and claim, \"I possess a swift method to ascend the clouds,\" is but a devious byway of misguided learning, not the great elixir’s Way.\n\nHeaven and earth are the images of Qian and Kun. The established positions are the arrayed stations of yin and yang’s pairing. The *Yi* speaks of Kan and Li: Kan and Li are Qian and Kun’s two functions. Without fixed lines or positions, they circulate through the six voids, their coming and going unfixed, their above and below without constancy.\n\nQian is heaven; Kun is earth—our body’s crucible. Li is the sun; Kan is the moon—our body’s medicine. The precelestial eight trigrams place Qian in the south and Kun in the north, Li in the east and Kan in the west. South and north array the positions of heaven and earth’s pairing; east and west divide the gates of sun and moon’s ingress and egress. Reversing the search to seek within our body, the principle is one.\n\nQian and Kun are the substance; Kan and Li are the function. These two, Kan and Li, circulate, ascending and descending through the six voids, coming and going above and below—indeed, without fixed lines or positions. Within our body’s crucible, Kan and Li move: heaven hides in the latent, earth hides in the latent—how could there be fixed lines or positions?\n\nConcealed and submerged, they transform within. \"Concealed and submerged\" means spirit enters qi, qi enters the navel, and sinks to return to the sea’s depths. \"Transforming within\" means when the time arrives, qi naturally transmutes; when stillness reaches its extreme, the mechanism spontaneously activates, and the sun’s orb is embraced and brought forth. As Chen Xiyi’s *Zhi Pian* says: \"Vast, without trace, returning to the mysterious; latent, with mechanisms, the sacred embryo is knit\"—this is the meaning.\n\nEnveloping the ten thousand things as the Dao’s guiding principle, the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"The Dao arises from emptiness and nonbeing; from the one qi, yin and yang are produced. Yin and yang unite to generate the three bodies; the three bodies engender the ten thousand things.\" The mother of the golden elixir is none other than the precelestial one qi. Split, it becomes two; divided, it becomes three; dispersed, it becomes the ten thousand things—all emerge from this one qi. Thus it is said: \"Enveloping the ten thousand things as the Dao’s guiding principle.\"\n\nTo use the insubstantial to govern the substantial, the vessel’s function is emptiness. The *Daode Jing* says: \"Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the center’s emptiness that makes the cart useful. Clay is shaped into vessels; it is the hollowness within that makes the vessel useful. Doors and windows are cut to make a room; it is the empty space that makes the room useful. Thus, what is present provides the advantage; what is absent provides the function.\"\n\nLin Yanzhai’s commentary states: \"The hub is the part of the wheel that holds the axle; the spokes are the wheel’s limbs. The hub is empty in the center, hence it can move the cart. Clay is the potter’s material; hollow and round, it can become a vessel. Doors and windows are the room’s passages for light—these three are all metaphors for the function of emptiness. Thus it is said: 'What is present provides the advantage; what is absent provides the function.' Carts, vessels, and rooms are all real advantages, yet their usefulness as cart, vessel, or room lies in the function of emptiness.\"\n\nNow, Master Wei’s statement—\"to use the insubstantial to govern the substantial, the vessel’s function is emptiness\"—truly employs Laozi’s meaning. In the elixir method, the great emptiness serves as crucible and furnace, and within the great emptiness, there naturally exists a wondrous function. Marvelous! Marvelous!\n\nGuan Yinzi says: \"Clothing sways in the void to obtain wind; exhaling upon things obtains water.\" Chen Baoyi’s commentary states: \"Knowing that swaying in the void obtains wind, then striking our bellows can generate qi. Knowing that exhaling upon things obtains water, then nurturing our qi can transform essence.\" If one is ignorant of this and seeks elsewhere, the so-called crucible and furnace are not the Way of emptiness and nonbeing.\n\nThus, advancing and retreating, Kan and Li vanish and reappear. \"Advancing\" is the time for kindling the fire, when Kun’s three lines transform into Qian. \"Retreating\" is the time for withdrawing the tally, when Qian’s three lines transform into Kun. Now, from the new moon when the Zhen trigram governs, passing through Dui to Qian, and from the full moon when the Xun trigram governs, passing through Gen to Kun, Kan and Li’s line positions are unseen—is this not the vanishing of Kan and Li?\n\nYet Kan and Li do not vanish; they move through the six voids, their coming and going unfixed.\n\nWords are not carelessly crafted; theories are not idly born. Drawing evidence, verifying effects, measuring with spirit and numen, tracing the origins of characters to confirm principles: Kan is the essence of the wu month; Li is the light of the si day. Sun and moon are the *Yi*’s correlates of firm and yielding. Earth rules the four seasons, weaving the warp of beginning and end. Green, red, white, and black each occupy a quarter, all receiving the power of the central palace’s wu and si.\n\nKan is yin without and yang within—the image of the moon. Li is yang without and yin within—the image of the sun. Kan receives wu, the yang earth; Li receives ji, the yin earth. When the two earths unite, yin and yang harmonize, firm and yielding correspond—like the two characters for sun and moon combining to form the character *yi*. Green, red, white, and black are wood, fire, metal, and water. Wood, fire, metal, and water each occupy a quarter; only earth resides in the center, dividing its flourishing seasons among chen, xu, chou, and wei to weave the warp of the year’s beginning and end. Thus, wood receives its flourishing, fire its rest, metal its birth, and water its cessation—all receive its power.\n\nYet this earth pervades everywhere...",

      "translated_text": "Within the universe, there is no fixed position for earth—when in Kan, it is wu earth; when in Li, it is ji earth; when in the central palace, it is wu-ji earth; when in the four seasons, it is chen-xu-chou-wei earth. Yet it is the same substance. How profound! The *Wuzhen Pian* poem states: \"The Four Symbols and Five Phases all rely on earth,\" and again: \"Only because each holds true earth within does the golden elixir achieve return and restoration.\" For without true earth to harmonize them, yin and yang remain blocked, firm and yielding sundered—no elixir can form.\n\nAlas! When Master Wei composed this book to reveal the secrets of this Dao, he drew only from verified evidence and personal attainment. Yet fearing this might still fail to convince later generations, he further calibrated the numinous workings of sun and moon as a method and traced the principles of the *Yi* hexagrams as proof—truly profound and luminous. How could he have idly fabricated groundless words or spun useless theories to deceive those who come after?\n\nThe *Yi* is imagery. No image is more luminous than that of sun and moon. To fathom the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; they converge like spokes in a turning wheel, alternating in ebb and flow. The *Yi* is imagery—precisely what the earlier passage meant by \"sun and moon forming *yi*.\"\n\nMaster Wei’s purpose in this work was to point out the yin and yang within the body. Yet the body’s yin and yang are formless and ungraspable—ordinary people use them daily without awareness. If not for borrowing images and objects, how could one illuminate them so that others might fathom the numinous and know transformation? Thus, he looked up and down between heaven and earth, where only the images of sun and moon stand out in luminous clarity. By presenting what is manifestly clear, he enabled others to perceive the yin and yang of heaven and earth and silently grasp the wonders of transformation. Then the daily workings of one’s own body, though unspoken, become self-evident.\n\nFor sun and moon traverse the ecliptic: one emerges, one retreats; they alternate above and below, intertwining in expansion and contraction, cycling through day and night like a wheel turning endlessly. If one reflects inwardly and extends this insight, one finds that within one’s own body, sun and moon exist no differently than in heaven and earth.\n\nHan Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states:\n*\"The Dharma-wheel must turn—always turn—*\n*Yet it lies within the body, unseen.*\n*When set in motion, it resembles the sun-wheel—*\n*The sun-wheel turns toward me, within my body.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Let the Dharma-wheel turn without cease;*\n*Thought by thought, cling not—*\n*The wheel turns of itself;*\n*What need is there for external seeking?\"*\n\nThe *Yi* contains three hundred eighty-four lines. \"Extracting the tally\" refers to the sixty-four hexagrams—a complete *Yi* totals three hundred eighty-four lines, while one *jin* of the great medicine totals three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. This is the resonance between the Dao of the elixir and the Dao of the *Yi*, and thus the *Cantong Qi* was composed.\n\nThe lines are the strokes of the hexagrams; the tally is the union of hexagrams. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams. In the elixir method, Qian and Kun serve as the cauldron and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, and the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire phases. Now, observing Qian and Kun: they begin with *Zhun* and end with *Jiji* and *Weiji*, with every inversion and correspondence in between perfectly aligned. Herein lies the Dao: \"One yin, one yang.\" The ancient immortals, by extracting the tally from the lines, metaphorically compared cauldron, medicinal substances, and fire phases—truly ingenious and comprehensive.\n\nFrom the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth conjoin their essence, and sun and moon mutually sustain each other. \"From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon\" refers to the interval between the last and first days of the lunar month.",

      "translated_text": "When *Zhen* arrives to receive the tally, it is Qian interpenetrating Kun to form *Zhen*, wherein the single yang is born within the body. At this moment, spirit and qi intermingle, qi and spirit unite—akin to heaven and earth conjoining their essence, sun and moon merging as one. Thus it is said: \"At this moment, heaven and earth conjoin their essence, sun and moon mutually sustain each other.\" Heaven and earth are the Qian and Kun within our bodies; sun and moon are the Kan and Li within us. As heaven and earth and sun and moon unite in due season, they refine the myriad things to accomplish the year’s work. As Qian and Kun and Kan and Li unite in due season, they seize the transformations of creation to form the sacred embryo.\n\nMaster Wei sighed: scholars, failing to comprehend the yin-yang transformations within their own bodies, borrow the moment of sun-moon conjunction as a metaphor. Yet it is not that only the interval between the dark and dawn of the new moon may be employed for inner work. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Sun and moon meet once every thirty days; the method of exchanging days for seasons lies in spiritual work.\" If practitioners grasp the subtlety of exchanging days for seasons, they may seize heaven and earth’s mechanism to complete the Great Elixir.\n\n\"Yang, the male, scatters the mysterious; yin, the female, gathers the yellow transformation.\" \"Yang, the male, scatters the mysterious\" refers to heavenly qi descending to earth; \"yin, the female, gathers the yellow transformation\" refers to earth receiving heavenly qi to generate beings. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Sweet dew descends when heaven and earth unite; the yellow sprout arises when Kan and Li intermingle.\" The generation of medicinal substances in elixir arts resembles the generation of beings in heaven and earth—both proceed from the intermingling of yin and yang, one scattering, one transforming, to produce the mysterious yellow.\n\nWhen primordial chaos intermingles, the root and foundation are established. As yin and yang qi ascend and descend to intermingle and merge as one, it is called \"primordial chaos.\" Primordial chaos is the outer enclosure of heaven and earth, the womb of the myriad things. In elixir arts, taking this as the starting point to establish the root and foundation means that heaven, earth, and the myriad things all reside within one’s body, with no need to seek them externally.\n\nCultivating and nurturing within the *yinen*, spirit congeals to form the body. *Yinen* is the root and stem. When elixir arts are cultivated here and the inner light is turned inward, spirit clings to qi and congeals, qi clings to spirit and abides—naturally interweaving to form the embryo. If the spirit’s light leaks outward and the qi-steed gallops abroad, then sun and moon lose their way, gold and mercury part crucibles. How then may one hope to complete the elixir? The *Baizi Qingzhu Yuye Dansui Ge* says: \"In former days, I met my teacher and received the oral transmission: simply focus spirit to enter the qi-cavern.\" This is why it is called \"spirit-elixir\" and named \"spirit-immortal.\"\n\nAll beings tread this path to emerge, even the wriggling and crawling. The way of yin-yang intermingling is the source of all generation and transformation. Not only do humans and beasts emerge thereby; even the flying, wriggling, crawling, and breathing—down to the most minute creatures—all proceed from this. Thus it is said: \"All beings tread this path to emerge; the wriggling and crawling none are without it.\" Applied to others, it generates people; preserved within oneself, it generates the medicinal substance. The only distinction lies in whether one is sagely or common, moving with or against the current.\n\nThus Confucius praised the *Hong Meng*, saying: \"The virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the empty.\" Ancient texts esteemed the *Yuan Huang*; the *Guanju* established the beginning. The *Book of Rites* took capping and marriage as weighty; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* made the first year paramount. From this we know that the sages’ composition of classics all had a foundational reference. If one practices elixir arts without investigating their origins, how may one thoroughly comprehend yin-yang and deeply penetrate the transformations of creation?\n\nThe sage is not born in vain; above, he observes the celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension, in accord with the seasons. The tally is the union: the moon travels through the heavens, once each month uniting with the sun, hence called the celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, contraction and extension in accord with the seasons: from the first day of the month onward, its light gradually advances, the *hun* lengthens, the *po* wanes, yang extends, yin contracts—like the progression from midnight to noon. From the sixteenth day onward, its light gradually retreats, the *po* lengthens, the *hun* wanes, yin extends, yang contracts—like the progression from noon to midnight. The perfected of old observed heaven’s way and grasped heaven’s movements, then borrowed the celestial tally’s advance and retreat, yin-yang’s contraction and extension, to establish the method of fire phases as a model for others. For heaven and earth are like a single crucible, sun and moon the medicinal substances. The sun and moon’s movements through heaven and earth—coming and going, rising and setting—are the fire phases. If one can turn inward to seek this within oneself, one may silently grasp the subtlety of the fire phases’ advance and retreat.\n\nThus the *Yi* unites the heart of heaven; the *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning. The *Yi* is called \"one yin, one yang.\"",

      "translated_text": "The heart of heaven lies at the center of the northern *zi* hour. The *Fu* hexagram corresponds to the eleventh month. As a hexagram, *Fu* precisely aligns with the central *qi* of the northern *zi* position, responding to the winter solstice. As Shao Kangjie’s *Jirang Ji* states in its *Winter Solstice Chant*: \"At the winter solstice, the midpoint of *zi*, the heart of heaven remains unchanged.\" Zhu Xi praised this poem as most excellent. For the *lidong* solar term falls in the first half of the tenth month, *xiaoxue* in the middle of the tenth, *daxue* in the first half of the eleventh, the winter solstice in the middle of the eleventh, *xiaohan* in the first half of the twelfth, and *dahan* in the middle of the twelfth. Thus, the midpoint of *zi* in the winter solstice is the midpoint of the eleventh month. Some say the midnight *zi* hour is the winter solstice, but this is incorrect, for the first half of the *zi* hour belongs to the preceding period. Most who calculate the Five Phases are unaware of this, yet the reckoning invariably begins here without the slightest deviation—this is why it is called the heart of heaven. Now, when Master Wei established the *Yi* as uniting the heart of heaven and the *Fu* hexagram as marking the beginning, he referred to the yang *qi* lying dormant in the first month of winter, the month of pure yin, beginning beneath the *Kun* hexagram. There, it accumulates into a single yang line, transforming into the *Fu* hexagram. While it is commonly known that the tenth month is *Kun* and the eleventh month sees the emergence of a single yang line beneath five yin lines, forming *Fu*, few realize that the eleventh month’s winter solstice does not spontaneously generate a single yang line to become *Fu*. Rather, in the tenth month’s *xiaoxue*, a yang line has already begun to stir within the lowest line of *Kun*. Yet within a single day or month, it grows by only one-thirtieth. Only after accumulating for a full month, by the eleventh month’s winter solstice, does it complete a single line, forming *Fu*. This, too, is a metaphor. The year takes the winter solstice as *Fu*, the month takes the new moon’s dawn as *Fu*, and the day takes the *zi* hour as *Fu*—all serve to elucidate the transformations within the body, and one need not rigidly adhere to years, months, days, or hours.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* states: \"A month has three decades, a day shares the same cultivation. The alchemical method emulates heaven’s work.\" For the year corresponds to the month, the month to the day, and the day to the hour. Compressing a year into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour—within a single hour, there lies the mechanism of a single yang’s return. This mechanism does not reside in the winter solstice, nor in the new moon’s dawn, nor in the *zi* hour. Without profound insight into heaven and earth’s yin and yang, none may know this mysterious mechanism, so secret is it.\n\nThe eldest son inherits the father’s body and establishes the foundation through the mother. The *Qian* father’s lowest line intermingles with the *Kun* mother’s first line, forming *Zhen*, which is the eldest son. Thus it is said: \"The eldest son inherits the father’s body.\" *Zhen* arises from *Kun*’s body, just as an infant is born from its mother’s womb. Hence it is said: \"Establishes the foundation through the mother.\" The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"The Golden Duke was originally the Eastern House’s son, sent to the Western Neighbor to inherit the body.\" This is the same principle. Understanding this, one knows that in refining the elixir, there is no need to seek the winter solstice—within the body, a single yang naturally arises, and one need not cling to the constraints of years, months, days, or hours.\n\nThe waxing and waning respond to the *zhong* pitch; ascent and descent follow the Dipper’s pivot. From *zi* to *si* is waxing; from *wu* to *hai* is waning. The waxing and waning respond to the *zhong* pitch: within a year’s twelve months, the pitch pipes change each month, cycling through all twelve. The waxing and waning of the body’s fire phases are the same. From below to above is ascent; from above to below is descent. Ascent and descent follow the Dipper’s pivot: within a day’s twelve hours, the Dipper’s handle shifts each hour, traversing all twelve earthly branches. The body’s fire phases’ ascent and descent are likewise. The *Zhixuan Pian* states: \"Vast, the ninefold earth shifts the pitch pipes; dim, the boundless heavens turn the Dipper’s handle.\" This is but a metaphorical comparison—it does not mean using the length of pitch pipes or the Dipper’s direction as a measure.\n\nOn the third day, brightness emerges; *Zhen* receives *geng* in the west. On the third day of the lunar month, the crescent moon appears at dusk in the west, at the *geng* position, resembling *Zhen*. This corresponds to *Zhen*’s reception of *geng*. In terms of the body’s fire phases, this is the moment when the river chariot must not pause even briefly.\n\nOn the eighth day, *Dui* receives *ding* at the upper *cui*, level as a stretched cord. By the eighth day, the moon reaches the upper *cui*, appearing at dusk in the south at the *ding* position, resembling *Dui*. This corresponds to *Dui*’s reception of *ding*, symbolizing the halfway ascent of the body’s yang fire.\n\nOn the fifteenth, *Qian*’s body is full and complete, *jia* in the east. By the fifteenth, the moon opposes the sun, appearing at dusk in the east at the *jia* position, resembling *Qian*. This corresponds to *Qian*’s reception of *jia*, symbolizing the body’s yang fire at its fullest.\n\nThe toad and the hare’s essence—sun and moon shine without dual brightness. The toad is the moon’s essence; the hare’s spirit is the sun’s light. \"Sun and moon shine without dual brightness\" means the sun illuminates the day, the moon the night. When the sun rises, the moon sets; when the moon rises, the sun sets. Day and night alternate in illumination, their appearances and withdrawals reciprocally unfolding. How is human breath different? As the *Huangting Jing* states: \"Exhale the sun, inhale the moon—breath is preserved.\" For breath is none other than the sun and moon.\n\nThe toad observes the hexagram’s node; the hare spits forth radiance. In the alchemical method, the first half of the month is yang, belonging to *Zhen*, *Dui*, and *Qian*; the latter half is yin, belonging to *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. Thus it is said: \"The toad observes the hexagram’s node.\" The moon is supreme yin; the sun is supreme yang. Yang governs emission; yin governs absorption. The moon itself has no light but receives the sun’s light to become bright. Hence it is said: \"The hare spits forth radiance.\"\n\nAt seven and eight, the Dao is complete, bending and descending low. Seven and eight refer to the fifteenth. The yang fire ascends from *Zhen* to the fifteenth, where pure *Qian* reaches its fullness—this is the culmination of the first half of the month. Its momentum is exhausted, its path perilous. Thus, it must inevitably bend, turn, and descend. As Chen Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi Shu* states: \"Within the ninefold city, the dragon chariot departs; before the twelvefold tower, the tiger carriage returns.\" This is the same principle.\n\nAt sixteen, it turns to receive the mandate; *Xun*’s *xin* appears at dawn’s clarity. By the sixteenth day, the moon begins to wane, appearing at dawn in the west at the *xin* position, its brightness just diminished. This resembles *Xun*, corresponding to *Xun*’s reception of *xin*. In terms of the body’s fire phases, this is the moment when yin receives yang’s succession, the peak turning back.\n\n*Gen* aligns with *bing* at the southern lower *cui* on the twenty-third. By the twenty-third day, the moon reaches the lower *cui*, appearing at dawn in the south at the *bing* position, half its brightness diminished. This resembles *Gen*, corresponding to *Gen*’s reception of *bing*, symbolizing the halfway descent of the body’s yin tally.\n\n*Kun*’s *yi* on the thirtieth day in the east guards its brightness. By the thirtieth day, the moon’s brightness is concealed, appearing at dawn in the east at the *yi* position, guarding its light. This resembles *Kun*, corresponding to *Kun*’s reception of *yi*.",

      "translated_text": "By the thirtieth day, the moon becomes *hui* (dark), appearing at dawn in the east at the *yi* position, its light entirely concealed. This resembles *Kun*, corresponding to *Kun*’s reception of *yi*, symbolizing the moment when the body’s yin tally reaches its utmost.\n\nWhen one phase ends, succession passes to the next, and the corporeal form revives like the dragon. Master Wei divides the thirty days of a month into six phases: from the first day of the new moon to the fifth day is the first phase, belonging to *Zhen*; the sixth to the tenth day is the second phase, belonging to *Dui*; the eleventh to the fifteenth day is the third phase, belonging to *Qian*; the sixteenth to the twentieth day is the fourth phase, belonging to *Xun*; the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth day is the fifth phase, belonging to *Gen*; and the twenty-sixth to the thirtieth day is the sixth phase, belonging to *Kun*. When the six phases conclude, the sun and moon conjoin at the new moon, and yang once more receives yin’s succession, transforming again into *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the dragon—a single yang stirring beneath two yins. Beneath the depths of the abyss, is there not a moving creature? Is this not the dragon?\n\n*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. *Qian* receives *jia* and *ren*, while *Kun* receives *yi* and *gui*. Thus it is said: *Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*. The ten celestial stems begin with *jia* and *yi* and conclude with *ren* and *gui*. Thus it is said: *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. The *na jia* method is but a metaphor drawn from the fire phases. The waxing and waning of the fire phases differ not from the moon’s waxing and waning. Now, arranging the six hexagrams across a month: *Zhen* corresponds to the third day, when the moon emerges at *geng*; *Dui* to the upper *cui*, when the moon appears at *ding*; *Qian* to the full moon, when the moon is full at *jia*; *Xun* to the sixteenth day, when the moon wanes at *xin*; *Gen* to the lower *cui*, when the moon diminishes at *bing*; and *Kun* to the dark moon, when the moon vanishes at *yi*. This is merely a borrowing to discuss the advance and retreat of the six hexagrams’ fire phases within the body—it is not truly the thirty days of a month.\n\nHow can this be clarified? When measured against the calendar, day and night vary in length. If the day is short and the sun sets at *shen*, the moon conjoins at *shen* and reaches fullness at *yin*. If the day is long and the sun sets at *xu*, the moon conjoins at *xu* and reaches fullness at *chen*. Over twelve months, the three-day-old moon does not always appear at *geng*, nor does the fifteen-day-old moon always appear at *jia*. With the new moon’s conjunction varying in timing, the upper and lower *cui* do not invariably fall on the eighth and twenty-third days, nor do the full and dark moons invariably fall on the fifteenth and thirtieth days. When Master Wei speaks of the three-day moon emerging as *shuang*, *Zhen* receiving *geng* in the west, or the sixteenth day’s turning receiving *Xun*’s succession with *xin* appearing at dawn, he refers to the equinoxes when day and night are balanced, using them merely as metaphors—not truly advancing the fire when the moon emerges at *geng* or retreating the tally when the moon wanes at *xin*.\n\nScholars need only observe the moon’s waxing and waning and reflect upon their own bodies. The arising of one yang within the body is the *Zhen* image of the three-day moon’s birth. The growth of two yangs is the *Dui* image of the eight-day moon’s *cui*. The fullness of three yangs is the *Qian* image of the fifteen-day full moon. The arising of one yin is the *Xun* image of the sixteen-day waning moon. The growth of two yins is the *Gen* image of the twenty-third-day moon’s *cui*. The fulfillment of three yins is the *Kun* image of the thirty-day moon’s concealment. How can one rigidly adhere to the moon’s directions of emergence and setting, regulate them by the hexagrams’ line structures and numbers, or constrain them by the calendar’s methods of expansion and contraction?\n\nSeven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. Together, the four sum to thirty, matching the thirty days of a month—this is the *Yi*’s image of concealment and disappearance. Seven is the fire number, eight the wood number; combined, they make fifteen. Nine is the metal number, six the water number; combined, they also make fifteen. Together, the four sum to thirty, corresponding to the thirty days of a month. When the thirty-day count concludes, the sun and moon unite as one, and the *Yi*’s image vanishes without trace. The *Fuming* chapter states: “One month, one return, makes one revolution; one year, nine revolutions, nine returns.” It relies solely on the two hexagrams to reckon punishment and virtue, with five and six revolving back to *wu* and *si*. Five and six together make thirty.\n\nThis resembles the midwinter node, when grasses and trees wither and decay, aiding yang’s interrogation of *shang*. The traveler and the lord deeply conceal themselves, following the season’s rhythm, closing their mouths and refraining from discoursing on the Dao of Heaven—so vast, so profound, formless and boundless, empty and unseen. To rectify errors and dispel delusions, one must first dissolve the outer frame.\n\nIn the alchemical method, the winter solstice and the moments between dark and new moons are all metaphors for the time when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. Speaking of a month, it is like the dark moon’s night, when the moon’s light vanishes without trace. Speaking of a year, it is like the midwinter node, when grasses and trees wither and decay. Their meaning is one and the same. The *Yi* states: “Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*. The former kings, on reaching this day, closed the passes, and merchants and travelers did not journey; the lord did not inspect the regions.” This is to cultivate stillness in preparation for movement, aligning with the Dao of Heaven.\n\nYet the Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless; the true mechanism lies within a single moment. The profound and formless finds its wonder in the hidden and obscure. Thus, at the moment of the winter solstice, one must first seal the *Dui*, calm the heart, and guard silence, causing metal and mercury to return together to the crucible, like the sun and moon uniting as one. Conceal the outer frame, sinking it into the abyssal void, so that spirit congeals, qi gathers, and the golden liquid coagulates. If one forgets this sealing of silence and recklessly lets the heavy tower’s vastness pour forth, one invites only injury and defeat.\n\nThis separate arrangement of the four images is to enlighten later generations who are blind. The four images are seven, eight, nine, and six—the same as the “seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond” mentioned above. Combined, seven, eight, nine, and six make thirty, corresponding to the thirty days of a month—all are metaphorical images. Master Wei, seeing that scholars failed to grasp his meaning and blindly led one another to mistakenly take the waxing and waning of the thirty days as the fire phases of a month, thus separately arranged these four images of seven, eight, nine, and six to enlighten the unenlightened, hoping to reveal that the thirty days of a month are all metaphors—not truly advancing the fire on the third day of the moon or retreating the tally on the sixteenth day. This is like the branches *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*; the earthly branches *zi*, *shen*, *yin*, and *xu*; the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the solar terms of solstices, equinoxes, beginnings, and closings; day and night; dawn and dusk; and the return to one’s dwelling—all share this meaning. If scholars understand that seven, eight, nine, and six correspond to the thirty days of a month, they can silently comprehend all other broad metaphors. Why cling to the text and rigidly adhere to the images?\n\nThe eight hexagrams are arrayed, and the luminaries move without losing the center.",

      "translated_text": "The center is the Yellow Way. The eight directions are arrayed with the eight trigrams, and the twenty-eight lunar lodges encircle them—this is the path along which the sun and moon travel. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Once you drive the two substances back to the Yellow Way, how could the numinous elixir fail to form?\" When refining the elixir, if the \"monkey of the mind\" gallops wildly outward, you must gather your vision, return your hearing, and concentrate your spirit for a moment, so that the two substances return to the Yellow Way without losing the center. Then, in harmonious union, they condense into a single drop of dew, which descends into the Cinnabar Field.\n\nThe primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive; its effects must be inferred and verified. The primordial essence arises from the profound and obscure, invisible to the eye. The *Daodejing* says: \"Profound! Obscure! Within it lies essence. Its essence is most real, and within it lies sincerity.\" The Way of the Great Elixir accords with the transformations of nature. When the celestial sign arrives, the jade bell tolls once, and the grotto of the immortals opens wide—this is its verification. An ancient song says: \"Beneath the first green, the moon and sun rise together on either side, merging into one.\" Without penetrating the yin and yang of heaven and earth or deeply grasping the transformations of one’s own body, how could one hastily proceed?\n\nWhen dwelling in stillness, observe its images and model its forms. When refining the elixir, externally set up a gnomon and water clock to measure the celestial movements of the sun’s shadow, while internally cultivate the True One to verify the body’s own timekeeping. Only then will you not lose the mechanism of heaven and earth. When spirit is settled and qi harmonized, inner and outer align; when spirit is dull and qi restless, the moments diverge—this cannot be left unregulated.\n\nSet up the gnomon as a standard and observe the signs to determine auspiciousness. The fire times of the Great Elixir do not rely on fixed hours—why set up a gnomon and observe the signs? It is to avoid missing the moment when heaven and humanity jointly activate the mechanism. If one does not guard this mysterious moment but instead busies oneself from dawn to dusk with the sundial and water clock, taking them as the fire times, one errs gravely.\n\nIssue commands in accord with the seasons, and do not miss the time when the lines move. When *Dizhen* (Earth Thunder) stirs and the *Xun* gate opens, the dragon leaps toward the eastern pool—this is the moment when the single yang line stirs within the body. At this time, warm qi surges and merges, and the heart feels a fleeting trance; one must swiftly advance the fire without delay. The *Zhuyu Jihuanyuan* says: \"When the wind first rises in the myriad hollows and the moon first rounds the thousand peaks, hasten to issue commands and circulate the Celestial Cycle.\" This is what it means. The *Zhixuan Pian* says: \"Guard the child in the radiant light, and employ the general amid the drumbeats\"—this, too, refers to the same.\n\nAbove, examine the patterns of the *Hetu*; below, sequence the flows of earth’s forms; in the center, investigate the human heart. Cross-reference and verify the Three Powers. The *Xiqizhen Sanzhu Mingxu* says: \"Revolving with the sun and moon, wheeling with the Milky Way, the turning is endless, and life knows no bounds.\" This means the Way of the Great Elixir aligns with the Way of Heaven. The *Shizhong Yin* in *Xiqizhen* says: \"Its wondrous workings flow like rivers, endless in their circling; it nurtures the mysterious valley and irrigates the Jade Pond.\" This means the Way of the Great Elixir aligns with the Way of Earth.\n\nWhy does the Way of the Great Elixir align with heaven and earth? It all lies in the silent operation of this heart. The ancients who refined the elixir looked up to observe the celestial patterns, looked down to examine earth’s principles, and centered their inquiry on the human heart. Thus, they emptied their hearts, moved their spirits, turned the Celestial Pivot, and rotated the Earth’s Axis. Above, they responded to the revolving brilliance of the Milky Way; below, they matched the rising and falling of the ocean tides. Though heaven and earth are vast and their transformations wondrous, the luminous movements of the sun, moon, and stars, the cyclic array of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams—all were gathered into their own bodies. Some became their crucibles, some their medicinal substances, some their fire times. Turning inward to observe, the Three Powers were complete within them, for they never sought outside their own bodies.\n\nThe *Jirang Ji Guanyin* says:\n*\"One thing comes with one body,\nOne body still holds one Qian and Kun.\nIf you know the myriad things are complete within you,\nWhy set the Three Powers apart as separate roots?\nHeaven’s pivot lies within the center,\nCreation arises from the heart.\nHow could heaven and humanity have two different principles?\nThe Way does not act in vain—it lies deep within the human.\"*\nHow could there be any doubt?\n\nWhen active, follow the changes of the hexagrams; when still, adhere to the judgments of the *Tuan* texts. The *Daodejing* says: \"Attain the utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. Things flourish in abundance, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny.\" How perfect! This is why the myriad things return to their destiny.",
      "overlap_context": " the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter; the solar terms of solstices, equinoxes, beginnings, and closings; day and night; dawn and dusk; and the return to one’s dwelling—all share this meaning. If scholars understand that seven, eight, nine, and six correspond to the thirty days of a month, they can silently comprehend all other broad metaphors. Why cling to the text and rigidly adhere to the images?\n\nThe eight hexagrams are arrayed, and the luminaries move without losing the center.",

      "translated_text": "Within this body lies the great elixir of golden cinnabar—is its embryo nurtured in the midst of utmost stillness and born at the moment when yin reaches its extreme?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Supreme indeed is the primal power of Kun! All things owe their birth to it, for it follows Heaven in due sequence.\" Kun’s profound capacity to bear all things is a virtue boundless in scope. As Kun is the hexagram of pure yin, the earth, it receives and enfolds Heaven’s qi, and thus the hundred creatures all emerge from the soil. The alchemical method, at the moment of containing light and returning illumination, conceals the spirit within—this is no different from the pure yin of the moon, the closure of winter’s depths. The \"Returning to Destiny\" chapter says: \"Having received the true immortal’s formula, one refines the utmost yang within yin.\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nYet when stillness reaches its extreme, movement must follow. In an instant, one yang stirs beneath the six yins, transforming first into *Fu* (Return), then into *Lin* (Approach), *Tai* (Peace), *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), *Guai* (Breakthrough), until at the sixth change it becomes pure *Qian*—the yang qi then pervades the six voids, and a single wheel of the sun emerges from the deep pool.\n\nWhen Qian and Kun circulate in their workings, Heaven and Earth are then well-ordered. The functions of Qian and Kun are Kan and Li. When Heaven and Earth obtain Kan and Li to operate between them, yin and yang harmonize in great peace, and auspicious qi arises. If for a single day Heaven and Earth were without Kan and Li, the workings of creation would nearly cease. Is the wondrous use of the great elixir any different from the workings of Qian and Kun?\n\nHow could one not be cautious? The first stirring of the yang is the beginning of elixir-making—just as it is the beginning of a ruler’s governance. When issuing decrees and commands, how could one not be cautious?",

      "translated_text": "The subtle mechanisms must be tightly sealed, then expansively deployed to distribute the treasure. \"Tightly sealed\" means the eyes contain their light, the ears concentrate their resonance, the nose regulates its breath, the tongue seals its qi, the feet are crossed in proper sitting, and the spirit is inwardly guarded—without a single thought diverted outward. For when the eyes do not see, essence naturally returns to the liver; when the ears do not hear, essence naturally returns to the kidneys; when the tongue does not speak, spirit naturally returns to the heart; when the nose does not smell, the po soul naturally returns to the lungs; when the four limbs do not move, intent naturally returns to the spleen. Thus, essence resides in the liver yet does not leak through the eyes; the po soul resides in the lungs yet does not leak through the nose; spirit resides in the heart yet does not leak through the mouth; essence resides in the kidneys yet does not leak through the ears; intent resides in the spleen yet does not leak through the four limbs or the nine apertures. When all five are without leakage, spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent blend and fuse, transforming into a single qi that gathers in the *dantian*. When the breath shifts through the nose and the heart suddenly awakens, the Dragon and Tiger surge through the pass, the great path opens, and a single channel flows into the nectar of jade.\n\nThe crucial pivot of the Dao is the Dipper’s handle, unifying the warp and woof of transformation. The essence of the elixir Way lies entirely in the Dipper. The Dipper governs the turning of yin and yang throughout the body and commands the myriad transformations within—just as a net has its warp or a garment its fastening. For the three *dantian* are divided in three places; if the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle is activated, true qi circulates up and down like the flow of the Celestial River. This is called the crucial pivot. As the *Fuming Pian* states: \"Drive back the Northern Dipper, turn the Celestial Stem; grasp the Southern Asterism and enter the Grotto Chamber\"—this is the crux within the crux.\n\nWhen the lines and images stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"At the moment of receiving qi, it is easy to obtain; in the work of withdrawal and addition, beware of danger.\" The first yang arises within the body—this is the moment of receiving qi. Though easily attained, if one acts at this time, fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement. Not the slightest deviation is permissible.\n\nThe five planets move in disarray, responding to the seasons; the four and seven fall into discord, separating and uniting, rising and bowing. The five phases must be gathered, the metal and fire must share the same crucible—all depends on a single thought to return to the root and revert to the source. Otherwise, the constellations within the tripod will all be misaligned, and Heaven and Earth will be as distant as if suspended apart.\n\nThe Literary Star governs and records, interrogating the Terrace and Assistants; the hundred officials and functionaries each oversee their respective domains. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The six stars of the Dipper’s bowl are called the Palace of Literary Florescence.\" Here, \"governing and recording\" refers to the Crimson Palace’s sovereign, who unites Kun and Qian. Within the human body, where is there a so-called Literary Star? It is nothing but a metaphor. Heaven has its Three Terraces and Four Assistants; the elixir has its Three Dragons and Four Tigers. To interrogate the Terraces and Assistants means that *jia* and *yi* must not lose *geng* and *xin*, nor should there be the slightest error. Heaven has its multitude of stars and their corresponding regions; the elixir has its multitude of hexagrams and fire signs. The hundred officials and functionaries each oversee their domains—this refers to arranging the twenty-four qi of the year, aligning the twenty-eight lunar lodges of the celestial circuit, and meticulously calculating the fire times of the tripod and furnace. From this, it is clear that the myriad images of Heaven all reside within this single body.\n\nThe sun contains the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the rhythm of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. The sun has fifteen *du* of hardness and fifteen *du* of softness; the moon has twelve pipes, six of yin and six of yang. In the elixir Way, the sun is fire, and \"containing the essence of the five phases\" means one thing contains five colors. The moon is the medicine, and \"receiving the rhythm of the six pitch-pipes\" means refining white metal with the six hexagrams. \"Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew\" means the Great Yang moves one degree each day; when it has moved thirty degrees, it once again conjoins with the Great Yin, cycling endlessly without pause.\n\nThe beginning and end, the threads of existence and extinction—\"beginning\" is the new moon; \"end\" is the dark moon. The \"threads of existence and extinction\" lie between the dark and new moons, when yin is nearly exhausted yet not entirely so, and yang is about to arise yet has not yet done so. However, this \"dark and new moon\" is a metaphor—it does not truly refer to the end of the thirtieth day or the beginning of the first day.\n\nIf the ruler is arrogant, excessive, and overflowing, violating the Dao; or if the ministers are devious and obsequious, acting contrary to the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the lunar phases will fall into discord, leading to misfortune and calamity. The law enforcers will admonish, criticize, and interrogate, leaving fault with the ruler. The ruler is spirit; the ministers are qi. When making the elixir, lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible; the body and mind must be still and unmoving. For if the body moves, qi scatters; if the mind moves, spirit scatters. Only by concentrating spirit and gathering qi, with heart and breath mutually dependent, can the numinous embryo be formed. Otherwise, the waxing and waning within the body will fall into discord, leading to misfortune and calamity. Tracing the cause, it is because the heart-ruler has become unrestrained and violated the Dao, so the qi-ministers also act deviously and contrary to the proper path. Thus, it is said: \"The law enforcers admonish, criticize, and interrogate, leaving fault with the ruler.\"\n\nWhen the Celestial Pole is properly aligned, one may roam freely and entrust matters to subordinates. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"Beneath the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterism, at the brows and eyelashes, with a mind like ashes, practice water and fire, stabilize the breath, and gather true lead.\" It also says: \"Essence and qi are the original foundation; spirit and numinosity share one household. If you can capture the five thieves, you may naturally unite the Three Flowers.\" When containing light in silence, one must be continuous yet seemingly present, allowing things to proceed naturally—do not labor the spirit.\n\nThe Bright Hall enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm from the Dao. The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"The Eastern Palace’s Azure Dragon, the Chamber and Heart—the Heart is the Bright Hall.\" In the human body, this is the Grotto Chamber, the Purple Ultimate, the Numinous Gate and Portal. The *Huangting Jing* says: \"Between the Bright Hall and Golden Cabinet, the Purple Chamber, the Perfected of Highest Clarity stand before me; the Yellow Skirt Child’s cinnabar qi frequently troubles me. I ask: where is it? Between the two brows, from which light hangs down and shines.\" Thus, the ruler sits in the Bright Hall to enact governance, communicating the Dao to the nine barbarian tribes and the eight wild regions. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"The Grotto Gate is ever tranquil, illuminating Penglai, guarding eternal spring\"—this is the same principle.\n\nInwardly, one nurtures the self through tranquility and emptiness. Wang Chongyang’s *Complete Reality Collection* says: \"The wondrous use of the Mysterious Pass is not difficult to fathom—it lies only in wordless silence.\" For when the heart is at peace and empty, the Dao naturally comes to reside; when emptiness is extreme and stillness profound, the original yang true qi naturally returns.\n\nReturn to the root and illuminate within to transform the body. The *Complete Reality Collection* says: \"To penetrate, one must search for the origin; to see, one must look within.\" Returning to the root and reverting to the source, turning the light inward—this is the great principle of cultivation. The former Confucians said: \"The Daoist method of nurturing life is to withdraw the gaze and return the vision, like metal and water concealing their light within.\" How true are these words!\n\nSeal the mouth and fortify the numinous root. The mouth is *dui*; the numinous root is the Kan Palace. Seal the mouth so that the upper does not leak; fortify the numinous root so that the lower does not escape. The *Taiqing Jing* of Master Yin says: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss to beautify the numinous root.\" For when spirit does not stray outward, harmonious qi fills and beautifies the within.",

When the exterior is upright, the shadow is straight; when the source is deep, the flow is long. Attain the One, and the myriad affairs are complete.\n\nThis One is what veils the world—none know it. The Ancestor of the Great Dao arises from nothing but qi to accomplish transformation: divided, it becomes black and white; separated, it becomes blue and yellow.

All these manifold forms are but the two words *yin* and *yang*—yet in truth, they are a single thing.\n\nThe names \"divine water\" and \"flower pool,\" the designations \"crucible\" and \"earth cauldron\"—all refer to one place. Some say it is the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice; others, the interval between the last and first days of the lunar month. People do not know that the return of the first yang must occur at the *zi* hour of the Winter Solstice, or that the union of sun and moon must take place between the last and first days of the month. Thus, they pore over calendars, count the hours, and err gravely.\n\nYet who knows that within the compression of years into months, months into days, days into hours—even within a single hour—lies the creation of a year, a month?

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Winter and Summer Solstices, the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, the *mao* and *you* hours, the *jia* and *geng* days, the last and first days of the lunar month, the waxing and waning phases, the *zi* and *wu* hours, the *ji* and *hai* days, the *zi* and *shen* hours, the *yin* and *xu* hours—all twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two seasonal markers, the annual conjunctions and monthly revolutions, the moments of *li* and *kan*, the months of the Hare and the Rooster, the cavities of *xun* and *qian*, the gates of the two eights, the *zhun* of dawn and the *pi* of dusk, the *gou* of day and the *fu* of night—all reside within this single center. As the *Chuixu Pian* states:\n\n*\"Later, it returns as before—\nGo ask those wild fox spirits how many they’ve deceived.\nNone know this single place,\nAll mistaking side doors for the true Way.\"*\n\nHow many in this world truly know this One?\n\nThe *Daodejing* says: *\"The highest virtue is non-action, without deliberate seeking; the lesser virtue acts, its function unceasing.\"* Here, \"the highest virtue is non-action, without deliberate seeking\" means the spirit abides in the Mysterious Palace in silent non-doing. \"The lesser virtue acts, its function unceasing\" means *qi* rises in the Gate of the Female, continuous and unbroken. This borrows Laozi’s words to reveal the secret of the interpenetration of *kan* and *li*.\n\nWhen the upper gate is closed, it is called \"having\"; when the lower gate is closed, it is called \"nothing.\" \"Nothing\" serves \"having\"; above, the spirit-virtue dwells within these two apertures, following the mutual necessity of having and nothing. \"When the upper gate is closed, it is called 'having'\"—the *li* Palace has form, concealing true Water. \"When the lower gate is closed, it is called 'nothing'\"—the *kan* Gate is formless, the Crimson Dragon hidden. \"Nothing\" serves \"having\"; above, the spirit-virtue dwells—when the Original Spirit rests in its palace, *qi* follows and ascends. Thus, the wonder lies in the eight gates being firmly sealed. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\n*\"The eldest son sips wine from the West,\nThe youngest daughter first opens the Northern flowers.\nIf the green moths meet thereafter,\nThe Yellow House’s gates must be locked at once.\"*\n\nThe Yellow House is the palace where the Original Spirit resides. \"These two apertures follow the mutual necessity of having and nothing\"—if the lower is not closed, fire does not gather; if the upper is not closed, the medicine does not rise. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n\n*\"Send it back to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly,\nThen let the flowing pearl unite in proper match.\"*\n\nWhat are the \"flowing pearl\" and \"earthen crucible\"? They are alternate names for the two cavities of *kan* and *li*.\n\n*\"Know the white, guard the black—\nThe numinous will come of itself.\"*\n\n\"White\" is the essence of Metal; \"black\" is the foundation of Water. \"White\" is Metal; \"black\" is Water. In the elixir method, Water is the foundation, and the essence of Metal is born within Water. Thus, to \"know the white\" is only to guard the black; when the black is guarded, the white appears of itself. How to guard it? Like a cat watching its hole, waiting for the mouse—its body unmoving, its eyes unblinking, its mind fixed solely on the mouse, without any other thought. The \"numinous\" is the heavenly mechanism. To steal this mechanism, one must first empty the heart. When the heart is empty, the spirit congeals; when the spirit congeals, the breath settles; when the breath settles, both sides ascend as one, and the numinous clarity comes of itself. As the *Li Sao Yuan You* says:\n\n*\"Without disturbance to guard it,\nIt will naturally be one.\nThe spirit’s aperture is open—\nIn the midnight hour, preserve emptiness to await it,\nNon-action comes first.\"*\n\nThis aligns with the commentary of Master Zhu of Ziyang: *\"Master Guangcheng’s instruction to the Yellow Emperor was nothing more than this—truly the essential secret of immortals.\"*\n\nWater is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One, the beginning of *yin* and *yang*. It contains the Yellow Sprout, master of the Five Metals, the Northern River Chariot. Thus, the crucible is black without but holds golden radiance within—*wearing coarse cloth while hiding jade*. The outer appears mad, yet Water is the pivot of the Dao, the beginning of *yin* and *yang*. Why? Heaven’s One generates Water, which stands first among the Five Phases. Water’s One, when added to Earth’s Five, becomes Water’s completion number—is this not the image of the Mysterious containing the Yellow Sprout? The \"Mysterious containing the Yellow Sprout\" is Lead born within Water. Lead is the master of the Five Metals, produced within the Northern Mysterious Barrier when Earth is added. The Yellow Sprout is the golden radiance, the essence of the crucible. Thus, the crucible’s body is black without, while golden radiance is concealed within—like a priceless treasure hidden in a coarse-clad man’s embrace. The Northern River Chariot is the Emperor’s Chariot, so named because it wheels along the Celestial River. Now, when true Lead is born within Water and refined by true Fire, the River Chariot does not dare to pause in its turning but ascends to the summit of Kunlun Peak.\n\nMetal is the mother of Water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of Metal; the child harbors the mother’s womb. Metal generates Water, hence \"Metal is the mother of Water.\" Water is the child of Metal; Water contains Metal, hence \"the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child harbors the mother’s womb.\" If scholars understand the meaning of Metal within Water, they know the source of the medicine’s production.\n\nThe Perfected One is most wondrous—seeming to exist, yet not; faintly resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating. The Perfected One is the Original Spirit. \"Seeming to exist, yet not\" means it is continuous yet not forced, faintly present. \"Faintly resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating\" describes the Perfected One’s comings and goings in the great abyss—vague and indistinct, floating and sinking without fixed form. As the *Jindan Dacheng Ji* of Xiao Zixu says: *\"On Kunlun’s peak, the Yellow Flower’s path—at times leading the Original Spirit away, then returning.\"* The \"great abyss\" is Kunlun.\n\nAdvance and retreat, distribution and arrangement—each guards its own domain. In the elixir method, one advances from *zi* and retreats from *wu*; advance and retreat, distribution and arrangement—each guards its own boundary, not overstepping. As Yang Xubai’s *Jindan Chun Cui Yin* says: *\"Before the *zi-wu* furnace, advance and retreat are divided; within the *qian-kun* crucible, floating and sinking are distinct.\"*\n\nGather the white of *kan* and refine it into the vermilion. \"White\" is the white Metal; \"vermilion\" is the vermilion Mercury. \"Gather the white of *kan*\" means to gather the white Metal from the Northern *kan* Palace as the elixir’s mother—white Metal and vermilion Mercury are of the same root and follow one another. \"Refine it into the vermilion\" means daily applying the Fire to withdraw the Lead’s *qi* and add Mercury in its place. As Chen Momo’s *Chongzheng Pian* says:\n\n*\"Within, guard the River Chariot in the Northern Palace—\nSince ancient times, Heaven’s One, Water, comes first.\nWhen the tally matches, the Fire of the Zhou Heaven is established,\nThe meaning akin to a ferryboat crossing to the other shore.\nDay and night, the turning is ceaseless,\nThe subtle mechanism of the armillary sphere.\nCultivating elixir, the superior scholar—\nOnly by understanding this method can one know true Lead,\nNot needing Lead.\"*\n\nScholars merely know that the medicine is formed by the union of Lead and Mercury, yet do not understand the Fire’s work of withdrawing Lead and adding Mercury. Thus, even if the elixir’s head is formed, it cannot avoid dissipation.\n\nRefine it to become the outer defense, the white within steadfastly dwelling. \"Refine it to become the outer defense\" means the true Fire operates in the outer furnace. \"The white within steadfastly dwelling\" means the golden elixir rests in the inner furnace. The inner furnace’s elixir requires the outer furnace’s Fire, refined and nurtured day and night, before it matures. As Hao Guangning’s *Taigu Ji* says: *\"At the crown, the Black Pearl’s radiance appears; in the abdomen, the secret treasure shines resplendent—is this not the Fire operating without while the elixir dwells within?\"*",

      "translated_text": "A square and circle, spanning but an inch, blend and support one another—born before Heaven and Earth, towering in majestic height. Flanking it are ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isles. Encircled and sealed, the four directions flow unimpeded; vigilant defense ensures steadfast security, barring all wickedness. Winding pavilions connect, ever watchful against the unforeseen.\n\nThe \"square and circle, spanning but an inch\" refers to the Mud-Pill Palace. Today, people merely call the heart \"the square inch,\" unaware that the three fields of the human body are all hollow, each spanning an inch, with qi and vessels interconnected. \"Blend and support one another\" means the head contains nine palaces, with the Mud-Pill at their center. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Mud-Pill’s nine spirits each have their chambers; the square and circle, spanning an inch, reside therein.\"* \"Born before Heaven and Earth\" signifies that the Mud-Pill’s single cavity is the ancestral aperture of the body’s myriad orifices—when this aperture opens, all others follow. \"Towering in majestic height\" means the Mud-Pill Palace sits atop Kunlun’s peak, the abode of the primordial spirit, corresponding above to the Dark Capital, the realm where the ten thousand spirits gather.\n\n\"Flanking it are ramparts and gates\" refers to the seven orifices arrayed around it, with the Cavern Chamber and Yellow Gates positioned before it. \"Resembling Penglai’s isles\" likens it to the three immortal mountains upon the sea, with Penglai at their summit. \"Encircled and sealed\" means withdrawing vision and returning hearing, carefully closing the senses. \"The four directions flow unimpeded\" describes the primordial harmony circulating internally, qi flowing freely as the Vermilion Bird encircles the Jade Terrace in flight. \"Vigilant defense ensures steadfast security\" is like the dragon nurturing its pearl, mind unwavering, or the hen brooding its egg, qi unbroken. \"Barring all wickedness\" means that though demonic realms may encroach, one wields the axe with self-assurance. \"Winding pavilions connect, ever watchful against the unforeseen\" means that if the spirit departs, it must be recalled, with twin youths ever guarding the cavern’s gate.\n\nThus, one may be free from anxious thought but must not succumb to toil and weariness. Tan Changzhen’s *Shuiyun Ji* states: *\"Do not hang threads upon the numinous terrace; within, the spirit embryo coalesces—only when the mind is without action does qi harmonize, and when qi harmonizes, the supreme treasure forms. When the mind acts, qi scatters, and when qi scatters, the essence dissipates.\"* Therefore, one may be free from thought but must not indulge in toil.\n\nWhen spirit and qi fill the chamber, none can retain them—those who guard them prosper; those who lose them perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, they ever accompany one. Through long accumulation and sustained effort, primordial harmony overflows. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, one must ever guard them—guarding them brings prosperity; losing them brings ruin. One must never, even for a moment, depart from vigilance.\n\nAs for those who delve into the esoteric, practicing inner visualization while lost in thought, treading the Dipper and pacing the asterisms, invoking the Six Jia, observing the days and hours, or employing the Yin Path’s suppression of the Nine Ones—all these muddle the primordial womb. Those who consume qi, expelling the old and drawing in the new, cause their intestines and stomachs to groan emptily. Those who sit in stubborn vacuity suffer through sleepless days and nights; those who exert themselves in labor disregard bodily exhaustion. Some shake their heads, roll their eyes, clench their fists, and strain their strength, only to set their hundred vessels seething, giving rise to abscesses and ulcers. Others heap earth to erect altars, worshipping at dawn and sacrificing at dusk, only to fall prey to demonic unions in their dreams, ensnared by malevolent spirits. At first, their hearts rejoice, believing they will surely prolong their years, yet suddenly, midway, they meet untimely death, their forms decaying and exposed. All these actions are perverse and contrary, blatantly violating the Yellow Emperor’s texts, their conduct errant and wholly at odds with the Old Master’s safeguards. Clinging to delusion, they reach this end—who else is to blame for their transgressions?\n\nThus, Wang Liangqi composed the *Breaking Delusion Song*, and Chen Niniwan wrote the *Luofu Lament*, enumerating the errors of the world’s heterodox arts in torrents of two or three thousand words, lamenting that later generations fail to grasp the true path and err in treading deviant ways. If today’s scholars could but peruse the words of these two masters once, they would surely recognize their errors and inwardly reflect.\n\nThe enlightened will examine their defenses and suddenly understand the proper course.",

      "translated_text": "Lord Wei composed this *Triplex Unity*, radiant as a torch illuminating a darkened thoroughfare, precise as a needle guiding through a bewildering sea—his intent being that later enlightened ones, through these words, might fortify their resolve and suddenly comprehend the path of cultivation. Lord Wei’s heart may truly be called benevolent. Yet some dismiss his work as mere words on paper, never once fixing their gaze upon it—this is indeed self-abandonment, self-neglect; is it not lamentable?\n\n\"Diligently practice it, ceaselessly day and night.\" Qiu Changchun’s *Mingdao Collection* states: \"It is not through mere sitting or walking at dawn and dusk, twisting and contorting, that one forms the crucible. The great elixir of ninefold transmutation—golden liquid cinnabar—differs entirely from the minor comforts of heterodox methods. One must sever worldly affairs, concentrate the mind, and devote oneself wholly, practicing day and night without respite; only then can success be attained.\" Peng Zhenyi did not say in vain: \"The aspirant must cast aside sensual pleasures, forsake desires, renounce fame and profit, retreat to sacred mountains, sever ordinary ties, and cultivate in seclusion, diligently day and night without slack. Only thus may one harbor hope. Otherwise, all effort is in vain.\" This teaching is abundantly clear. Yet some, blind to this truth, insist on limiting their practice to the two daily periods of firing, and upon hearing the admonition to practice ceaselessly day and night, they recoil in astonishment and ridicule, deeming it unbearably laborious and vexing—how utterly thoughtless!\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Those who cling rigidly to form may not attain the true; dawn practice abandoned by dusk is not sincere. One cannot lightly accept the notion that the two daily periods suffice for firing.\" Formerly, Huangfu Lüdao visited Wang Sanyi, who set out counting rods and an hourglass. Asked their purpose, he replied, \"To mark the two cardinal points of noon and midnight.\" Huangfu said, \"Among the twelve hours, should there be any moment of interruption? Why limit it to noon and midnight?\" In essence, the Dao of the elixir and the Dao of Heaven are one. Does the Dao of Heaven ever pause, even for a single breath? If the Dao of Heaven never ceases for a breath, how can the Dao of the elixir tolerate even a moment’s interruption?\n\nMa Danyang’s *Gradual Awakening Collection* says: \"The master’s grace is profound and difficult to repay; I vow to encircle the walls and refine the true elixir to the death.\" \"Encircling the walls\" means cutting off human contact to focus solely on cultivation. After three years of ingesting the elixir, one may ascend and wander afar, walking through fire unscathed, entering water undampened, able to preserve or relinquish life, ever joyful and carefree. When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one conceals oneself to await the summoning of the Great One, relocating to the Central Land. When merit is complete, one ascends, receives the register, and is granted the chart.\n\nRefining the elixir requires but a moment’s effort—why then speak of three years of ingestion? The *Cui Xu Pian* clarifies: \"A moment’s effort refines and instantly manifests aged completion. One must pass three years, for after the moment of refinement, the elixir must be nurtured and warmed; one cannot abruptly depart afar.\" Zhongli Quanyang’s *Thirty-Nine Pointers to the Mysterious* states: \"The infant, young and unformed, must rely on the mother’s nurturing grace.\" This is correct. But after these three years, one moves like drifting clouds, strides like the wind, can ascend lightly and wander afar. Though the great flood reaches the heavens, one does not drown; though severe drought melts metal and stone, scorches earth and mountains, one remains unharmed. Life and death are at one’s command, and everlasting joy is attained.\n\nYet once the nurturing is complete, one must still conceal oneself among people, accumulate merit, and amass virtue to enlighten and deliver the deluded masses before one may ascend in flight. Thus, [the text is lacunose] Linggen entrusted Huangfu Lüdao to guide later disciples; Jinhua Dongshan admonished Yang Xubai not to seclude himself but to benefit all beings before ascending as an immortal. How could one attend only to one’s own perfection?\n\nThe *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; the *Yi* is expounded to clarify it. Of old, there were six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record*—why so many? Peng Zhenyi’s *Golden Key to the Returned Elixir* states: \"The six hundred chapters of the *Fire Record* are all similar.\" Thus, the so-called six hundred chapters are like the sixty hexagrams: the numbers of firing correspond to the sixty hexagrams, and when extended, they become six hundred chapters. The sixty hexagrams represent the phases of a single month, while the six hundred chapters represent those of ten months. Hence it is said, \"The *Fire Record* is not falsely composed; the *Yi* is expounded to clarify it.\"\n\nThe crescent moon forms the crucible and furnace; the White Tiger is the pivot of refinement; mercury is the flowing pearl. The Green Dragon rises with it, east joins west, and the essences mutually constrain one another. The crescent moon furnace is the lead furnace, its position in Kan, where the White Tiger resides. The flowing pearl palace is the mercury crucible, its position in Li, where the Green Dragon resides. The White Tiger as the pivot of refinement means the White Tiger resides in the cinnabar field, and fire issues from below the navel. The Green Dragon rising with it means driving the Green Dragon down to meet the White Tiger. East and west are Kan and Li; the essences are the sun and moon.\n\nThe origins of dragon and tiger and the sources of lead and mercury are not two separate paths. Wang Yixuan’s *Red Dragon Elixir Formula* states: \"If one discerns the dragon following the tiger and knows mercury resides in lead, then the adept, understanding the secret of driving the dragon to meet the tiger, will grasp the method of merging mercury with lead.\" The *Fuming Pian* says: \"The master points to the Green Dragon mercury, matching it with the White Tiger lead. The two essences are conjoined, water and fire refined for a year.\" And again: \"Once dragon and tiger unite in mutual embrace, Kan and Li couple and form the embryo. A molten handful of the marrow of Heaven and Earth—seek it earnestly and draw it near to sip.\" The method of the elixir is supremely simple and easy: merely unite the essence of the Green Dragon of the east with the spirit of the White Tiger of the west, and east and west are no longer separate. Naturally, dragon and tiger mate, essences merge, and the purple gold is produced.\n\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Jing*, with annotations by Wang Baoyi, explains: \"When the medicine is refined to the point of emergence, water and fire have already merged. Once water and fire unite, the dragon and tiger qi within the crucible harmonize and form the golden liquid.\" This elucidates the matter clearly. When refining the elixir, if one can empty the mind, still the thoughts, concentrate the spirit, and enter the qi cavity, then east and west unite, metal and wood merge, south and north blend, water and fire achieve balance, and the four images and five phases gather in one place, congealing without any need for exertion.\n\nAbove, the trigram Dui governs the number eight; below, the trigram Gen also governs eight. The two eights combine their essence, and the body of Qian and Kun is formed. Two eights correspond to one jin; the Dao of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced, not deviating by a single zhu. Three hundred eighty-four corresponds to the number of hexagrams and lines. When the upper firing period is governed by Dui, the moon is half bright—hence it is said, \"Above, Dui governs the number eight.\" When the lower firing period is governed by Gen, the moon is half dark—hence it is said, \"Below, Gen also governs eight.\" Observing the two firing periods together, the crucible of Qian and Kun is established, and medicine, materials, and firing are all contained within.",
      "overlap_context": "i composed the *Breaking Delusion Song*, and Chen Niniwan wrote the *Luofu Lament*, enumerating the errors of the world’s heterodox arts in torrents of two or three thousand words, lamenting that later generations fail to grasp the true path and err in treading deviant ways. If today’s scholars could but peruse the words of these two masters once, they would surely recognize their errors and inwardly reflect.\n\nThe enlightened will examine their defenses and suddenly understand the proper course.",

      "translated_text": "The two eights correspond to one jin, and the Dao of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced, for the moon has an upper and lower firing period. The upper firing period, governed by metal, weighs half a jin, totaling one hundred ninety-two zhu; the lower firing period, governed by water, also weighs half a jin, totaling one hundred ninety-two zhu. Together, they amount to three hundred eighty-four zhu. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams, each with six lines: one hundred ninety-two yang lines and one hundred ninety-two yin lines, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines. Master Wei borrows this to expound the subtlety of the elixir Way, intending nothing more than the perfect balance and correspondence of yin and yang—there is no actual three hundred eighty-four zhu, nor are there three hundred eighty-four lines.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states, \"Two eights correspond, naturally uniting in intimacy.\" The *Chensu Yangzhi Daopian* says, \"In my crucible’s silence, I harmonize the two eights.\" For \"two eights\" means two sets of eight *liang*, equal in weight, neither inclined nor biased. If one were to rigidly adhere to zhu and lines, counting breaths while fingering prayer beads, this would be self-inflicted toil—how could it be the Way of utmost simplicity and ease?\n\nMoreover, the *Fuming Pian* says, \"When square and round gather, things divide in pairs; both ascend, sharing one jin.\" The *Jindan Dacheng Ji* states, \"In the gate of two eights, those who comprehend are rare; the firing periods before and after are precisely timed.\" This refers to the *xun* gate within the body, not the upper eight *liang* and lower eight *liang* of the firing periods.\n\nWhen gold enters fierce fire, its color remains unaltered, its essence luminous. Since the opening of heaven and earth, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness; gold has never lost its weight. The moon’s form endures as ever, for gold is born of the sun. At dawn, it receives the sun’s tally; at dusk, it returns to its mother, the moon, embracing and concealing its frame, sinking into the cavernous void. Gold regains its original nature, and the crucible’s radiance blazes.\n\nAll things in the world perish in fire, yet true gold does not. Among the five phases, generation culminates in metal, which is most precious. When smelted, it yields to water; when struck, it yields to fire. Its softness resembles wood, its color resembles earth—water, fire, wood, and earth, all four natures are complete within it. Thus, true gold grows ever firmer through repeated refinement, never losing the weight of its original body. Since the opening of heaven and earth, countless millennia have passed, yet the forms of the sun and moon remain unchanged, their brightness never diminished. For the essence of yin and yang each dwells in its proper abode, and thus the sun and moon endure eternally. Among celestial phenomena, none are more luminous than the sun and moon; in the art of the elixir, none are more luminous than gold and fire.\n\nGold is the moon; fire is the sun. People know only that gold is the moon’s light, yet they do not know that the moon’s light is born of the sun. The moon, being Greater Yin, has substance but no light; its waxing and waning depend on the amount of sunlight it receives. At the new moon, it first conjoins the sun; after three days, its light begins to grow; by the eighth day, the upper firing period, its light is half; by the fifteenth day, it is full. After the full moon, it gradually wanes; by the twenty-third day, the lower firing period, it is half dark; by the thirtieth day, it is completely dark.\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, as it separates from the sun, it receives the sun’s light and begins to brighten, its body gradually whitening. At dusk, it embraces the sun, its essence lingering while its light vanishes, its body turning entirely black.\n\nIn the elixir Way, this is explained as follows: gold, born of the sun, receives the sun’s tally at dawn—True Yin gold arises in the Kun Palace, transformed by the True Yang fire. Its initial reception of qi is like the moon receiving the sun’s light, beginning at the new moon. When gold returns to its mother, embracing the moon at dusk, it is like gold in the Kun Palace guarding the fire, akin to the moon at dusk embracing the sun. When the crucible’s frame sinks into the cavernous void, spirit and qi deeply enter their root, gradually descending to the sea bottom, like the moon’s essence disappearing from sight. When gold regains its original nature and the crucible’s radiance blazes, the moon’s body, originally black, becomes white upon receiving the sun’s light. Now, embracing the sun and concealing its frame, it returns to its original blackness. By guarding its blackness and not seeking its whiteness, after long perseverance, spirit and illumination naturally arrive. In an instant, light and flame penetrate the crucible; the fire’s power blazes intensely. Then, on the third day, *geng* is born, the Dui gate opens, and black silver melts, yielding white silver.\n\nThe numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to make three; the numbers of *wu* and *si* total five. When three and five harmonize, the eight minerals are properly ordered. *Zi* water is one, *wu* fire is two; the numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three, the number of earth. Thus, the central *wu* and *si* are called five. Three and five together make eight—hence the term \"eight minerals.\" When three and five harmonize, water, fire, and earth unite as one. Though earth overcomes water and water overcomes fire, how can they harmonize? Now, earth acts as the mediator between water and fire, reconciling and uniting them, so that water and fire become husband and wife—thus they harmonize. When the eight minerals are properly ordered, water, fire, and earth unite as one, and the guiding principles are set right, all things fall into place.\n\nBreathing contains and nurtures; pausing, they become husband and wife. The ascent of yang and descent of yin—this is the breathing of heaven and earth.",

      "translated_text": "Within it, heaven and earth breathe—thus they endure. If one can emulate heaven and earth’s breathing within, one may likewise share in their endurance.\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* states: \"Exhaling connects the heart and lungs; inhaling connects the kidneys and liver. Exhale, and the dragon chants as clouds arise; inhale, and the tiger roars as wind stirs. Through this breathing, wind and clouds congeal into golden liquid—this is the natural respiration of the single *qi*, not the breathing of mouth and nose.\"\n\nThe *Hunyuan Baozhang* of Li Changyuan says: \"At the place of the True Man’s breathing, let the maiden come and go in flight. Empty the heart, concentrate the spirit, turn the light inward, and observe at the True Man’s breathing—follow its ascent and descent, comply with its spontaneity, and abide in it for a moment. When breathing contains and nurtures, stillness arises of itself, then all coalesces into one, husband and wife unite.\"\n\nWhat is the place of the True Man’s breathing? Liao Chanhui’s *Sancheng Neipian* says: \"Facing the navel wheel, behind the kidneys, at the center lies the True Golden Tripod—this is the place of the True Man’s breathing.\"\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: \"Behind is the secret gate, before is the gate of life. Sun emerges, moon enters—breathe and abide in the person.\" Yet most do not reach this, so their breathing does not reside here.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi*’s *Nanhua Zhenjing* says: \"The True Man breathes from the heels; the multitude breathe from the throat.\" Breathing from the throat is shallow and short; breathing from the heels is long and continuous. In cultivation, when the breath becomes profoundly deep, one’s life rests in oneself, no longer molded by the great forge.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* says: \"Below the heart, above the kidneys, west of the liver, left of the lungs—neither intestines nor stomach, a single *qi* flows freely through it.\" This is clearly and directly pointed out—what doubt remains? What doubt remains?\n\nYellow earth is the father of metal, flowing pearl the mother of water. Water takes earth as its dam; earth fills water so it does not rise. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding the balance to adjust victory and defeat. If water surges, fire is extinguished—both perish and return to the thick earth. When the three natures unite, they guard their original nature and share a common ancestor.\n\nEarth dwells at the center, hence it is called yellow earth. Earth generates metal, so it is the father of metal. Flowing pearl is mercury—wandering and restless, it is called flowing pearl. When flowing pearl enters water, it congeals into true gold. Gold generates water, so flowing pearl is the mother of water. Now, when earth enters water, water is restrained by earth and cannot bear metal upward, so it is said: \"Water takes earth as its dam; earth fills water so it does not rise.\" If the Vermilion Bird’s fire from the south is used to fiercely boil and intensely forge, fire flourishes and water boils, causing the metal to ascend with the water.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is the essence of southern fire, governing summer. Now, when Kan water is restrained by earth’s dam, fire can boil it, making it rise. Thus it is said: \"The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding the balance to adjust victory and defeat.\" When boiling water ascends into the southern Li palace, Li fire is in turn overcome by Kan water. If fire is extinguished by water, water must not overflow. Thus, earth overcomes water, and water, restrained by earth, stops. It is said: \"If water surges, fire is extinguished—both perish and return to the thick earth.\" When water and fire encounter earth, this is called the three natures. Once the three natures guard and unite, they merge into one and all return to the Kun palace. Thus it is said: \"When the three natures unite, they guard their original nature and share a common ancestor.\"\n\n*Giant sesame* still extends life; *returned elixir* may be ingested. Metal’s nature does not decay, so it is the treasure of the myriad things. When alchemists consume it, their lifespan is prolonged.\n\nGiant sesame is sesame—consuming it still extends life. The nine-times-cycled great returned elixir is the flourishing essence of metal, secretly drawing the upright *qi* of heaven and earth to form the sacred embryo. How could it not grant long life? Moreover, metal’s nature is firm and unyielding, enduring ten thousand years without decay, so it is the supreme treasure among the myriad things. Rightly do immortals value it. Thus, it is not called the elixir of water, fire, wood, or earth, but uniquely named the *golden elixir*.\n\nEarth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and setting rules.\n\nEarth has no fixed position but circulates among Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. In Chen, it is late spring; in Wei, late summer; in Xu, late autumn; in Chou, late winter. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all places where earth travels, so it is said: \"Earth travels through the four seasons.\" Earth can exhaust water and conceal fire. Guarding water, water does not flow; guarding fire, fire does not flame. Now, using it to guard Kun while gathering medicine, and to guard Qian while circulating fire—thus it is said: \"Guarding boundaries and setting rules.\"\n\nWhen golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain.\n\nWhen golden sand ascends the tripod, it pierces the two kidneys, guides the spine, passes through the heart meridian, enters the sea of marrow, rushes through the lung’s transport point, traverses the liver, passes the spleen, and returns to the cinnabar field. As it ascends, it billows like clouds and mist filling the four directions; suddenly, it arrives like a violent wind and rain. Vaguely, it is like awakening from a daydream; clearly, it is like a grave illness leaving the body. Spirit and energy unite like husband and wife in embrace; bones and flesh melt and harmonize like rising from a bath. These are all true scenes, not metaphors.\n\nThe *Fuming Pian* says: \"Not knowing, one might think *qi* arrives afterward—only through direct experience can it be known.\"\n\nFumigating and steaming reach the four limbs; complexion becomes radiant and lustrous. White hair all turns black; fallen teeth regrow in their original places. Old men return to youth; aged women become maidens. Their form changes, freeing them from worldly calamities—they are called True Men.\n\nAfter obtaining the elixir, nurture it day and night without interruption. Then true *qi* fumigates and steams the four limbs, naturally refreshing spirit and energy, brightening the complexion. White hair returns to black; fallen teeth regrow. Old men become youths; aged women become maidens. From this, they transform their form, transcend the world, leap from the cage, and are called True Men.\n\nMoreover, it has been said: if humans stand alongside heaven and earth as the three powers, they may share their beginning and end.

      "translated_text": "Heaven and earth are without end, yet human lifespan does not reach a hundred years—why is this? It is because humans, within heaven and earth, are but one thing among many. Though more numinous than other creatures and thus called \"human,\" how can they truly stand alongside heaven and earth? Yet if one seizes the mechanism of heaven and earth to refine the Golden Elixir of Liquid Gold, then one may share their beginning and end—this is called a True Man. Having become a True Man, one transcends the mundane and enters sagehood, no longer bound to their former form. Roaming beyond the world of things, they forever escape the calamities of the dusty realm.\n\nLead powder cast into fire loses its color and reverts to lead; ice and snow, when warmed by hot water, melt and become primordial water. Cinnabar serves as the foundation, harmonizing with mercury—transformation arises from their true nature, and beginning and end follow one another. To concoct an elixir for immortality, one must use substances of the same kind: just as planting grain requires millet, and hatching chicks requires eggs, so too must things of the same nature be employed to achieve natural transformation. Smelting fish eyes cannot produce pearls; artemisia cannot become sandalwood. Only like begets like—disparate things cannot form treasures. Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes, foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses, water does not blaze upward, and fire does not moisten downward.\n\nLead powder is originally black lead; when refined by fire, it becomes white. Yet if cast back into fire, it reverts to lead. Ice and snow are congealed yin *qi*; when scalded with warm water, they dissolve into water. Why is this? It is the principle of returning to the root and reverting to the source—this cannot be otherwise. The method of refining gold takes cinnabar as its foundation, blending it with mercury, for mercury is born from cinnabar and shares its nature. Thus, beginning and end follow one another, and transformation arises from their truth.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"When bamboo splits, use bamboo to mend it; to hatch a chick, use an egg.\" All things that are not of the same kind are but vain labor, striving in vain to match the true mechanism. For when true mercury meets true lead, the *qi* of one yin and one yang resonate as one—this is the meaning of \"same kind.\" It is like planting grain, which requires millet, or hatching chicks, which requires eggs. When like follows like, the Way proceeds naturally, effortlessly achieving transformation. But if one abandons the like and seeks elsewhere, it is like trying to make fish eyes into pearls or artemisia into sandalwood—since they are not of the same kind, how can transformation occur? Just as swallows give birth to swallows and sparrows to sparrows, they cannot give birth to phoenixes. Foxes nurse foxes, rabbits nurse rabbits—they cannot nurse horses.

      "translated_text": "Shall water’s nature, which moistens downward, be made to blaze upward? Thus, those who wish to refine elixirs for transcendence must employ what is of the same kind—only the like follows the like; if affairs are contrary, no treasure is formed.\n\nYet within our own bodies there is naturally a heaven and an earth, naturally a yin and a yang. The *Huanyuan Pian* speaks of \"seizing the marrow of another heaven and earth\" and \"copulating for a fleeting moment,\" claiming one must steal the *qi* of heaven and earth, the *qi* of the sacred father sun and numinous mother moon, to transform the *qi* of our own bodies—the *qi* of flesh and blood from our mundane parents—into the *qi* of true parents, transmuting the mundane body into a body of pure yang, a true immortal, thereby attaining the same lifespan as heaven and earth.\n\nYet some, benighted in their search for the like, fail to recognize the like within themselves and the Qian and Kun of their own bodies, instead seeking it outside. Falsely designating virgin maidens as true lead, they invoke the affairs of the *Huangdi Neijing* to adorn their heterodox doctrines, catering to the desires of scholar-officials. Thus, wealthy families and noble houses practice their arts, often meeting with death—this was not limited to the Tang Chancellor Xiahou Zi alone.\n\nTherefore, Ge Hong in the *Baopuzi* likened it to holding ice in a cup to boil soup or wrapping fire in feathers, while Tao Hongjing in the *Zhen’gao* compared it to embracing jade and leaping into fire or a golden coffin descending into a dog’s den. Fang Xuanling called them \"dogs and swine in human form,\" and Li Shangyin branded them \"seeds of hell.\" Ancient and modern alchemical texts unanimously condemn this practice in the harshest terms, for it harms others and ultimately destroys the practitioner as well.\n\nThe *Nanhua Zhenjing* states: \"Do not labor your form, do not shake your essence—only then can you attain longevity.\" Never has there been mention of so-called \"mastery of women\" as a method. Who has sown this pernicious seed, which to this day remains an obstacle, defaming the ancient perfected ones and misleading later students? Among the myriad heterodox arts, is this not the most harmful to the Dao?\n\nMany scholars in the world, though learned and talented, meet with no opportunity. They exhaust their fires and squander their wealth, following texts and fabricating interpretations, their beginnings without cause, their measures without control. They pound and refine arsenolite, mica, arsenopyrite, magnetite, and sulfur, burn camphorwood, mix mercury, fly and smelt the Five Minerals and copper, using them as auxiliary agents. Yet their natures are disparate—how can they willingly unite as one? A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; what they seek to refine becomes folly.\n\nFortune never favors them, and even the wise grow old with white hair, midway beset by doubts. They turn from the Dao and cling to delusion, stepping from the correct path into deviant byways. Their vision is narrow, their understanding limited—they cannot fathom what lies ahead.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nWithout a true master, do not force conjecture.\nFor the alchemical classics lack oral transmission—\nWhere shall you form the numinous embryo?\"*\n\nIndeed, the world abounds with talented and diligent scholars, yet few encounter a true teacher and receive the correct transmission.\n\nThose who burn and refine the Three Yellows and Four Spirits, deludedly believing the Dao lies therein, fail to recognize that the Five Metals and Eight Stones are mundane, tangible substances. Their kinds differ, their natures and properties vary—how can they willingly unite as one?\n\nThus, all who practice such arts meet with a thousand failures for every ten thousand attempts; what they seek to refine becomes folly. Why? Because their beginnings lack cause, their measures lack control.\n\nThe *Zhiyuan* chapter thirty-nine states:\n*\"Seeking teachers and friends, they learn to refine cinnabar,\nMaking the Great Return, thinking external elixirs transform inner medicine.\nYet metals and stones share no connection—\nThe Golden Elixir and Great Return Elixir arise from nothing,\nWhile cinnabar and mercury are but metaphors.\nAlas! People fail to recognize true lead and mercury,\nTaking mundane cinnabar and mercury as real.\nThey exhaust their fires and waste their wealth,\nAchieving nothing, their hair turning white in vain,\nOnly to sigh at the emptiness of it all.\"*\n\nAh! The true Dao is simple, not complex; its words are plain, without embellishment. Who believes it? Who practices it? Even those who receive the correct transmission may midway grow doubtful, thus stepping from the correct path into deviant byways.\n\nThe *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states:\n*\"Those who rely on cleverness to force right and wrong,\nEven if they hear the essential teachings, contradict themselves.\"*\n\nTurning from the great Dao to cling to delusion, peering at the heavens through a tube—how can their narrow vision suffice to discuss the boundless mysteries of what lies ahead?\n\nAs for the utmost sages: none surpass Fuxi, who first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling them on heaven and earth; King Wen of Zhou, who followed the trigrams and composed the line statements; and Confucius, the paragon of all sages, who added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three lords, raised by heaven, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, their merits and virtues shared the same principle, their creations building upon one another with meticulous care.\n\nFuxi modeled heaven and earth to create the *Yijing*, first drawing the Eight Trigrams. In the Primordial Unity Diagram, Qian-heaven is above, Kun-earth below; Li-sun and Kan-moon are arrayed in the east and west, while Zhen-thunder, Xun-wind, Gen-mountain, and Dui-marsh occupy the four corners. Was this without precedent?\n\nKing Wen followed the structure of the trigrams to compose the *Yijing*, writing the line statements. In the Later Heaven Diagram, Zhen and Xun, the two woods, generate Li-fire; then Kun-earth stores them. Dui and Qian, the two metals, generate Kan-water; then Gen-earth halts them. Was this without precedent?\n\nConfucius followed Fuxi and King Wen to expound the *Yijing*, composing the Ten Wings. Though he held no imperial throne in his time, he became the teacher of emperors for ten thousand generations—truly the paragon of all sages.\n\nThese three lords were the great sages of antiquity. Fuxi lived in high antiquity, King Wen at the end of the Shang, and Confucius in the late Zhou. They arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, in terms of merit and virtue, the former and later sages shared the same principle.\n\nMoreover, in the drawing of the Eight Trigrams, the composition of the line statements, and the writing of the Ten Wings, there are no superfluous words, no superfluous characters. Their deliberations on weight and measure are exceedingly precise, for their creations all had precedents.\n\nNow, Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, borrowing the symbolic trigrams of the *Yijing* to elucidate its principles—truly, he had precedent.\n\nTangible things can be measured, signs can be contemplated; affairs can be planned to serve as models for the world. This book, though lacking prior knowledge, relies on the master’s enlightenment—like drawing back a curtain or ascending a high terrace. Tangible things with signs can be measured and contemplated, but the Golden Elixir and Great Cinnabar are matters without form or sign—they cannot be measured or contemplated.",

Should the scholar not humble their heart and inquire widely, hoping for an encounter?\n\nGe Zichuan’s *Divine Immortals’ Records* tells of Liu Zheng, who sought the arts of nurturing life, diligently pursuing rare teachings and traveling a thousand *li* without hesitation. If he found one superior to himself, though they be a servant or guest, he would take them as his teacher.

Later learners, failing to grasp the true trap, see only the so-called *Six Hundred Chapters on Fire* and are left bewildered, believing the fire-phase to be so intricate and difficult. Little do they realize that the six hundred chapters are but like the sixty hexagrams: the sixty hexagrams mark the phases of a single month, while the six hundred chapters span ten months. For in one month, sixty hexagrams, each alike; in ten months, six hundred chapters, each similar. Thus it is said, \"their aims differ not in essence.\"\n\nThe written word is solemn—yet people do not ponder deeply to trace its source and flow, though the hidden and manifest originally dwell together. I dare speak only to the worthy, not presuming to write lightly. To remain silent would sever the Dao and incur blame; to commit thoughts to bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally. Thus I hesitate, sighing, looking up and down, ever deliberating. There is a method to refinement, yet I dare not reveal it all. I shall but outline its framework, its branches appearing sparse.\n\nFrom ancient times to now, alchemical texts fill storehouses like oxen laden with books, their thousand names and myriad words offering endless analogies—could this not be called solemn? Yet tracing their source and flow, one finds nothing but the interplay of yin and yang. These two emerge from the same origin though named differently. The ancient immortals poured out their livers and gallbladders to instruct the world, yet people, their karmic blessings shallow, have no leisure for deep reflection.\n\nNow, Master Wei composed this book, pointing out the origins of the crucible and vessel, the sources of the medicines, the methods of the fire-phase, and the secret teachings on existence and nonexistence, host and guest, priority and sequence. His words reach the root, each character grounded in truth—composed for the worthy of the world, not lightly written to fish for empty fame. Know that books are transmitted to the enlightened, affairs valued by the discerning. A farmer given a vermilion bow would use it to scare birds; a southerner given a dragon robe would use it to carry firewood. The great Dao of the golden elixir is cherished only by the worthy—how could I speak much to those who do not understand?\n\nThe *Supreme Mysterious Regulations* states: \"To meet a person and not transmit is to lose the celestial Dao; to transmit recklessly to the unworthy is to leak the celestial treasure. To transmit to the right person brings merit to the body; to transmit recklessly brings dark punishment to the seven ancestors.\" Thus, Master Wei, about to seal his lips and remain silent, would sever the lineage of the Dao and incur blame. Yet to commit his thoughts to bamboo and silk would risk leaking the celestial tally and inviting retribution. Thus he hesitated, sighing, looking up and down, ever deliberating. Though he wished to speak plainly and directly to instruct later learners, he dared not lightly reveal the true mechanism. Instead, he briefly described the medicines and fire-phase in broad strokes, so that later generations might grasp the intent behind the words—thus, perhaps, this Dao would not be lost in transmission.\n\nHaving neither the courage to speak plainly nor the heart to keep silent, he could only present its grand framework and distill its essential mechanism, scattering the methods of refinement across three chapters, like branches sparsely arrayed.\n\nTo use gold as a dike, water enters and flows freely. Gold is reckoned at fifteen, and the water’s number is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts water in excess. These two form the true gold, heavy as its original state, while earth does not enter. The two move together, and the three substances mutually embrace, their transformations wondrous as a spirit.\n\nTo use gold as a dike, water enters and flows freely: above, half a *jin* of gold serves as the outer furnace’s southeastern semicircular dike. Then below, half a *jin* of water descends from the west into the northern inner furnace, its force unhurried, flowing naturally. \"Gold is reckoned at fifteen\" refers to the first fifteen days, meaning the upper half-*jin* of gold. \"The water’s number is the same\" refers to the sixteenth to thirtieth days, meaning the lower half-*jin* of water.\n\nThe elixir method first ascends with civil fire, then descends with martial fire. Without this, it cannot deeply reach the nine springs below. Thus it is said, \"When tending the furnace, fix the weights: five parts water in excess.\" Gold and water, each half, together form the weight of sixteen *liang*—one opening and one closing, endlessly circulating—these are the true yin and yang of our bodies. Yet water must exceed half a *jin*, while gold must not fall short of its half-*jin* weight. Thus it is said, \"These two form the true gold, heavy as its original state.\"\n\n\"Its earth does not enter\": around the crucible and vessel, there is only the upper half-*jin* of gold and the lower half-*jin* of water—earth has no fixed place. The phrase \"does not enter\" does not mean it does not enter at all. Earth has no fixed position; there is nowhere it does not enter. Consider the twenty-four positions of heaven and earth—though there is no *wu-ji*, is there truly no *wu-ji*? From *ren-zi* to *gan-hai*, it moves without constancy, above and below without permanence—all are the realms where *wu-ji* roams. \"The two move together with it\": throughout the crucible and vessel, earth is everywhere, and the two—gold and water—accompany it. When gold, water, and earth move together, the three substances mutually embrace and merge into one. Merged into one, they abide in the green mountains, a myriad acres of clouds, dredging from the azure pool a wheel of moon—such are their transformations, wondrous as a spirit.\n\nThe *Chapter on the Utmost Dao* states: \"Ascending and descending are called the movement of gold and water; when *xun* is true, it is called the wind.\" Ascending is gold, descending is water, and that which enables their ascent and descent is earth. Yet gold, water, and earth are but metaphors and analogies. In truth, the great Dao has always been beyond names and forms; the true immortals originally had no flowers or grasses—what gold and water could there be? What earth could there be?",

The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* states: \"In refining the elixir, follow the *zi* hour when the Yang *qi* arises to kindle the fire, for only then is its power complete. If the fire is kindled at any other time, it will not be so.\" For at the *zi* hour, the Great Yang resides in the north, and the *qi* of the human body reaches the *Weilü* Pass. If the fire is kindled at this moment, inner and outer align, allowing one to steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth and complete the elixir.\n\nAt first, the Great Yang lies below, and water and fire unite in intercourse; the two *qi* intertwine, steaming to become liquid. Next, fire arises within the water, and the Yang *qi* gradually blazes; the liquid then congeals within, pressing forth the golden radiance—this is called true lead. When it is set in motion and ascends, it surges upward like a chariot coursing along the Yellow Way, and so it is named the Yellow Chariot.\n\nAs the years and months draw to their end, nature is harmed and lifespan diminished.

      "translated_text": "The bodily form resembles gray ash, like dust upon a bright window. An ancient song says: \"Use the bud, not the lead—you must work within the lead.\" Yet when it comes to using the lead, to use the lead is still mistaken. It further states: \"Lead is the mother of the bud, the bud the child of lead.\" Once the golden radiance is obtained, to discard the lead is to invite deep peril.\n\nPeople merely know that at the hour of *zi*, the *qi* of the kidneys arises; when refined by fire, it congeals into liquid, and they take this to be true lead, seeking to use it to transform the true mercury of *Li* Palace. Yet they do not consider that once it has become liquid, it possesses form and substance—its weight is turbid, how could it reverse its flow and ascend? The work of immortals in making the elixir does not employ its substance at this moment, but only ignites fire below to stir its *qi*. When the fire’s power grows strong, its *qi* surges upward like the rising clouds of mountains and rivers. Only after ascending into the *Niwan* Palace does it transform into sweet rain, descending into the *Chonglou*. Thus, the elixir method speaks of \"taking the clear and discarding the turbid\"—this is precisely what it means. The clear floats above, resembling dust upon a bright window; the turbid sinks below, resembling the body as gray ash.\n\nThose who refine the external elixir take what flies and congeals upon the lid of the crucible, calling it \"bright window dust.\" Master Wei used this to elucidate the internal elixir, wishing practitioners to grasp and extend the principle. \"Pound and blend together, then hasten through the Crimson Gate\": \"Pound and blend together\" means capturing from two places to unite in one furnace, where divine water coalesces into true butter. \"Hasten through the Crimson Gate\" means seizing the essence of the hare and crow, the marrow, and swiftly gathering it into the crucible to refine.\n\nThe great medicine of the golden elixir is born in *Kun* and planted in *Qian*. *Qian* above serves as the crucible, *Kun* below as the furnace. Without fierce refining and extreme forging, it cannot emerge from the furnace; without reversing its course and revolving counterflow, it cannot ascend to the crucible. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Grasp with both hands and force them to fight, transforming into a lump of purple gold frost.\" It further states: \"The river chariot dare not pause, swiftly transporting it to the peak of Kunlun.\" This describes the post-heavenly work of initial practice, distinct from the pre-heavenly moment of medicine production. Within it, there are also the dual practices of observing the mind and absorbing the spirit, both aiding the power of the fire-timing. Ancient immortals often kept these secret, and who would know them? Some cling to the methods of initial practice, engaging in massage, guiding, and revolving the windlass—vainly exhausting spirit and strength. How could they recognize the wondrous use of moving the spirit-fire to observe the true mind, or stirring the *Xun* wind to absorb the true spirit?\n\nSecure the barriers and fortify the defenses to ensure perfection and firmness. The *Jindan Dacheng Ji* says: \"Know the time, begin the work, gather what comes, and secure the divine hut without careless leakage.\" It further states: \"Carry it to the crown, where the three flowers gather; tightly seal the Jade Pass and golden lock.\" When the golden sand ascends to the crucible, one must secure and seal it meticulously—only then will the sacred embryo be complete and firm.\n\nBlazing fire spreads below, and the sounds of dragon and tiger grow earnest. The thirty-ninth chapter of the *Zhixuan* says: \"Simply slip into the Hua Chi crucible, where true fire blazes heavenward to forge.\" The *Jianwu Jian* states: \"Because the fire of the elixir blazes below, the waters of the Yellow River reverse their flow\"—this is the fire of refinement, which cannot but blaze. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Tiger leaps, dragon soars, the wind and waves coarse; at the central true position, the mysterious pearl is born.\" The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Dragon chants, tiger roars, lead and mercury burn together, revealing yellow buds and white snow.\" When the fire in the elixir field blazes fiercely, clouds steam and mists surge; wind stirs in the *Niwan*, and the sounds of dragon chanting and tiger roaring naturally arise. Peng Helin’s *Yuanshu Ge* says: \"Having received the formula, return to test the refinement—see the dragon and tiger contend in an instant. The nine flowers bloom in the heavens, and those who know this will witness a night of wind and thunder shaking ten thousand mountains.\" Those who have undergone trials will understand this for themselves.\n\nBegin with civil and end with martial; the array is complete. At the outset of gathering the medicine, concentrate the spirit, gather the *qi*, and harmonize the breath—inhale and exhale should follow the hand. When the spirit and *qi* enter their root, close tightly, but not too urgently; release freely, but not too loosely. Only by making it continuous and unbroken will the spirit naturally congeal over time, and the breath naturally settle. After a while, the *Xun* gate thunders, dragon soars and tiger leaps—then drive it back to the tail cavity, where flames surge into the celestial thoroughfare, rushing straight upward. Wang Baoyi said: \"Civil fire is the fire of generation; martial fire is the fire of fruition.\" The beginning is generation, the end fruition—begin with civil and end with martial; they cannot be pursued by a single method.\n\nObserve and inspect with utmost care, carefully adjusting warmth and coolness. \"Observe and inspect with utmost care\" means sealing the *Dui*, lowering the gaze, containing the light, and silently awaiting the arrival of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*. Only then should you stabilize the breath to gather it, concentrate the fire to refine it—you must examine its maturity, not acting carelessly. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"It all depends on the power of cultivation; even a hair’s difference will fail to produce the elixir—how could it be done lightly?\" \"Carefully adjusting warmth and coolness\" means regulating the fire’s power, examining and proceeding cautiously, gradually shifting from gentle to fierce—do not rush or advance hastily. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"The fire-timing must be firmly stable; the blowing and breathing entirely rely on the *Xun* wind—how could it be rushed?\"\n\nRevolve through the twelve nodes, each one more intimate than the last. The twelve nodes are the twelve celestial stems of the Zhou Tian, corresponding in the body to the fire-timing and positions. The twelve nodes of fire-timing ascend from *zi* to *wu*, then descend, circling the exterior of the crucible like the twelve celestial stems of Heaven. When the twelve nodes have all been traversed, the Zhou Tian completes, and the celestial ridge once more points to *zi*—thus it is said: \"Revolve through the twelve nodes, each one more intimate than the last.\" The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"The *Zhen* trigram moves to return to the west, the *Dui* region; the three Yangs and the alchemical maiden play with bright pendants. The *Xun* wind stirs the coral tree, entering *Gen* to return to *Kun*—another Yang shares this same defense.\"\n\nWhen *qi* is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and let the *po* and *hun* souls die. In refining the golden elixir to seek immortality, why does Master Wei speak of *qi* being exhausted, life nearing its end, and resting to let the *po* and *hun* souls die? The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"Hasten to return the hundred vessels to their source; when the pulse halts and *qi* ceases, the elixir begins to form.\" When the golden liquid congeals, the jade pivot and balance wheel stop turning at once, and the sun’s *hun* and moon’s *po* sink into the northern sea’s depths, hidden away—thus it is said: \"*Qi* is exhausted, life nears its end, rest and let the *po* and *hun* souls die.\" The so-called death is not true death—at this moment, one returns to the root and restores life; the spirit congeals, essence solidifies, the eight vessels all halt, and breath ceases. The *qi* seems exhausted, as if cut off. Yet after this death, one revives anew—this is what the *Shangqing Ji* calls: \"This time, truly dead, only now alive.\" Alas! To know the moment when the great medicine forms, when the six pulses all stop and *qi* does not flow—without having personally experienced such scenes, how could one speak of them with certainty?",

Atop the Mud Pill stands the Purple Gold Tripod, within which a lump of purple gold coalesces, transmuting into jade nectar that flows into the mouth, fragrant and sweet, refreshing and cool upon the tongue. Swallow it, ingest it—it enters the five viscera, harmonizing the organs, the body at ease and secure. For the Returned Elixir, when taken, is as sweet as licorice, as cool as calamus—this is what is called the *daogui*: merely the tip of a knife’s edge, a corner’s fragment.

      "translated_text": "Master Zihua said: Of the great numbers of Heaven and Earth, none surpasses five, none centers upon five. For five is the number of Earth, positioned at the center. Combined with the one of northern Water, it becomes six; with the two of southern Fire, it becomes seven; with the three of eastern Wood, it becomes eight; with the four of western Metal, it becomes nine—nine being the utmost of numbers. The numbers of the world end at nine. In terms of the nine numbers, five stands amid one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, and nine, truly the central number.\n\nNumbers originally have no ten. What is called the completed number ten of Earth arises when the one of the north, the two of the south, the three of the east, and the four of the west converge at the center and form ten. Thus, when the five of the center disperses to the four directions, it becomes six, seven, eight, and nine, and Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal all rely on Earth to be completed. If the one, two, three, and four of the four directions return to the center and form ten, then Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal all revert to their root and return to Earth.\n\nAh, how profound! The *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"Two things are born of the child, producing the mother.\" The *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: \"The four positions are distinct, their use inverted; the Five Phases arise together and return together.\" Both expound this meaning. Though the generative and completed numbers of the Five Phases may be recited even by a child of three feet, how many truly grasp their significance? If one does not know their significance, how can one attain their practical use?\n\nHerein lies the subtlety of the Dao: profound and distant. To the enlightened, it is simple and easy; to the deluded, it grows ever more complex and difficult.\n\nWhen water is cast to quench fire, the flame is suddenly extinguished. When the sun and moon eclipse, it is always at the new and full moons. When Water flourishes, Kan encroaches upon Yang; when Fire declines, Li’s daylight dims. Yin and Yang consume each other, their interaction the natural course of the Dao.\n\nShao Kangjie’s *Huangji Jingshi Shu* says: \"The mutual eclipsing of the sun and moon is the intersection of numbers. When the moon obscures the sun at full moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon covers the sun, the sun is eclipsed—just as Water and Fire overcome each other.\" Now, when water is cast to quench fire, fire is overcome by water, and the flame is suddenly extinguished. When Greater Yin obscures Greater Yang, Yang is vanquished by Yin, and the sunlight darkens in broad daylight. Why? When Yin and Yang interact, they inevitably consume each other—this is the natural course of the Dao.\n\nMaster Wei borrowed the mechanism of solar and lunar eclipses to illuminate the wonders of the Elixir Way, and further employed the mutual overcoming of Water and Fire to expound it. Truly, he was thorough.\n\nYet though solar and lunar eclipses always occur at the new and full moons, those who refine the Golden Elixir steal from Heaven and Earth, seize the workings of Creation—how could they not seek that which lies between the new and full moons?\n\nNames define essence; words arise from nature. When Metal returns to its nature, it is first called the Returned Elixir. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"One thing divides into two. Knowing the two is called naming the two.\" The two are Metal and Wood. Metal and Wood are originally not two bodies, so when Metal is named, Wood is termed; when Wood is nature, Metal is essence. In truth, they are one thing. For the Metal Lord is originally the child of the eastern household, sent to lodge in the western neighbor—its body born, it cannot yet be called the Returned Elixir. Only when it is poured into the eastern Yang’s crucible of Creation, returns home to meet the Blue Maiden, and produces a luminous pearl like the full moon, is it truly called the Returned Elixir.\n\nSome say: \"When stillness is unmoving, essence returns to nature—hence it is called the Returned Elixir.\" This is correct, yet it does not capture the original meaning of Metal’s essence and Wood’s nature in this chapter of Master Wei’s work. I dare not fabricate, nor imitate the ancients.\n\nThe *Ancient Records* speak of Dragon and Tiger; the *Yellow Emperor* praises Golden Flower; *Huainan* refines Autumn Stone; Wang Yang cherishes Yellow Sprout—none but veiled terms to convey their subtle meaning. Now, would Master Wei, in composing this work, recklessly invent empty theories to indulge his whims? No, he too followed the ancients’ subtle intent.\n\nMaster Zhu said of his use of words: \"All are based on ancient texts.\" This is no empty claim.",

Yet when its work is complete, it undergoes a thousand transformations, ten thousand changes, its wonders unfathomable—no minor art of side doors can compare. Rightly is it called divine!\n\nExpounding the numbers of the Five Phases is concise yet not cumbersome. The *Yi* says: \"Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten\"—these are the generative and completed numbers of the Five Phases.",

      "translated_text": "The worthy can uphold and practice it; the unworthy must not be allowed to partake. When Guzi followed Zihua Zi on his travels for twelve years, his studies complete, he took his leave. Zihua Zi admonished him, saying: \"Now, what you have cultivated, I find no fault in. Yet your aspirations are too broad and indiscriminate. Alas! You will later be one who selects. There will be those who strip away your outer defenses and build their own palaces; who mount your chariot and ride it to gallop across the four outskirts; who take what you hold as jade, shatter it, and divide it fivefold. The Dao inherently detests imbalance, for imbalance obstructs the Dao. Yet it also detests not finding its proper balance, for improper balance harms the Dao. Now you depart—if you reflect on how to guard your balance, then in this too I find no fault.\"\n\nMaster Wei’s words—*\"The worthy can uphold and practice it; the unworthy must not be allowed to partake\"*—reveal his profound concern. For the unworthy are surely frivolous and shallow; being frivolous and shallow, they are surely devoid of righteousness. Few among them would not draw the bow of Yi. The *Fu Ming* chapter states: *\"This Dao is most divine and sagely—do not let it leak or be lightly disclosed. It relies entirely on virtue and conduct, both in harmony. Speech must be guarded, and taboos observed. Know that the great Dao of the Golden Elixir may only be balanced with the worthy. If one is not such a person, not only should it not be spoken of, but they should even be kept at a distance.\"*\n\nAlas! From ancient times to the present, those who emerge into the world and transmit the Dao have all been heroes of the highest order, riding cranes and commanding mists and clouds—certainly not the foolish or clumsy. How could the unworthy ever comprehend it? From ancient times to the present, the Dao has been passed down through a single conversation, a single exchange of words. *\"He who attains the One accomplishes all things. How great is the One! It is the source of a thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses, the ancestor of a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes.\"* Truly, there is no second Dao in the world, no second heart in the sage. And the myriad volumes of immortal scriptures all converge in their language: the Golden Elixir is this very root and origin.\n\nScholars, exert yourselves, hold these words in mind, and ponder deeply. These are the most essential teachings, laid bare and luminous, never deceiving us. Master Wei says: *\"If scholars repeatedly savor and contemplate this book, one day their minds will grasp and their spirits guard it. Then they will know that my most essential words are indeed laid bare and luminous, without a trace of deception or concealment.\"* Ah! Master Wei’s intent to guide later learners is most earnest. Should scholars not trust and receive his teachings, recite and uphold this book, and hold its words in mind with deep reflection?\n\n---\n\n**Upper Scroll of the *Elucidation of the Union of the Three in Accordance with the Book of Changes***\n\nThe firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun unite and embrace one another. How great is the breath of man! Zhang Hengqu’s *Zheng Meng* states: *\"Man’s possession of breath is the image of firmness and softness rubbing together, of Qian and Kun opening and closing.\"* What is breath? One exhalation, one inhalation. With each exhalation, the pulse moves twice, and qi travels three inches; with each inhalation, the pulse also moves twice, and qi travels three inches. In one complete cycle of breath, qi travels six inches. In the hundred divisions of a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, and qi travels eight hundred ten zhang, circulating up and down like an endless ring, its limits unfathomable.\n\nBefore a person is born, dwelling in the mother’s womb, they breathe as the mother breathes—without sight, without hearing, only a single breath remaining. At birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and the primal qi of true origin gathers below the navel. Day by day, the spirit departs and qi shifts, and one no longer guards the single breath of the womb. Now, the method of cultivation practiced by divine immortals is to turn the light inward, harmonizing breath with the Great Harmony. This is to return to the origin and revert to the source, restoring the state at the moment of receiving qi at birth.\n\nXu Jingyang’s *Drunken Thoughts on Becoming an Immortal* says: *\"Internally harmonize the true qi, preserve breath, and naturally transform to restore youthful countenance.\"* The *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* states: *\"A thousand scriptures and ten thousand discourses expound on the subtle mysteries, but the root of life originally lies in the true breath.\"* All else is heterodox practice and reckless action, not the true and essential natural Dao.\n\nNow, Master Wei speaks of *\"the firmness of Qian and the softness of Kun uniting and embracing one another\"*—this refers to the moment of elixir-making, when the yang of Qian descends to unite with the yin of Kun, causing breath to intermingle, firmness and softness to correspond, and husband and wife to be paired as one. Then spirit and qi return to the root, nature and life unite, and the medicine gestates within. It is also called *\"the mating of Dragon and Tiger,\"* *\"the union of Metal and Wood,\"* *\"the coiling of the serpent and the dragon,\"* *\"the blending of red and black,\"* *\"the harmony of Heaven and Earth,\"* *\"the intermingling of the Mysterious Yellow,\"* *\"the fusion of Metal and Earth,\"* *\"the sharing of the crucible by Metal and Mercury,\"* *\"the sharing of the furnace by Metal and Fire,\"* *\"the union of red and white,\"* *\"the dwelling of the sun and moon in the same palace,\"* *\"the sharing of the den by crow and hare,\"* *\"the joyful union of husband and wife,\"* *\"the meeting of the Oxherd and Weaver Girl,\"* *\"the following of female and male,\"* *\"the merging of hun and po.\"* In the end, it is nothing more than the interdependence of heart and breath, the internal resonance of yin and yang, and the union of spirit and qi.\n\n*\"Yang bestows, yin receives; male and female depend on one another.\"* *\"Yang bestows, yin receives\"* is like jade flowers blooming and dewdrops congealing, the blossoms gradually opening as the bud’s dew deepens. *\"Male and female depend on one another\"* is like the Jia Dragon and Geng Tiger guarding each other, lead and mercury sharing the same crucible—only then can it be achieved. The so-called *\"bestowing and receiving,\"* the so-called *\"depending on one another,\"* are but explanations of the mating.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate beings through the mating of yin and yang; the method of the elixir generates medicine through the mating of yin and yang. Truly, there has never been a creation of transformation that did not arise from mating. The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* states: *\"If the Mysterious Yellow does not mate, how can yang fly up from below Kan?\"* This is the great principle of elixir-making, the foremost doctrine of immortal cultivation.\n\nYuan Yangzi’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: *\"The vastness of the Mysterious Heaven pairs with the Yellow Earth; the two natures harmonize and enter the bridal chamber.\"* This is its meaning. The *Returning Gold* chapter states: *\"The former sages clearly revealed the cinnabar terrace, where the numinous crow perched on the cassia branch several times.\"* This is its meaning. The *Returning to the Origin* chapter states: *\"The Metal Mother of the West is most firm and strong, entering the watery abode of Ren.\"* This is its meaning. The *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet east and west; the Four Images unite in the center of Wu and Ji.\"* This is its meaning. Wang Liangqi’s *Awakened Understanding* chapter says: *\"Skillfully guide the hun to join the po, transforming yin entirely into pure yang.\"* This is its meaning. The *Fu Ming* chapter states: *\"To know the great Dao’s principle of the Inaudible and Invisible, the Great Yang shifts to illuminate within the moon.\"* This is its meaning.",

      "translated_text": "The alchemical method encompasses both inner and outer sun and moon. The *Yellow Court Scripture* states: *\"The sun emerges, the moon enters—breathing and visualization pertain to the inner sun and moon.\"* It further says: *\"The three luminaries shine brilliantly, entering your chamber,\"* which refers to the outer sun and moon. These two are mutually dependent and cannot exist without each other. The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Pointer to the Mystery* states: *\"When the outer [sun and moon] conjoin, the inner [sun and moon] also conjoin; the three passes become unobstructed without laborious effort.\"* At the moment of the elixir’s formation, the inner sun and moon unite, refining essence within, while the outer sun and moon merge their radiance without. When inner and outer converge and remain undispersed for long, then—dimly, faintly—something takes form within. Profoundly, obscurely, essence fills the void, and white snow scatters in disarray.\n\nThe sun and moon illuminate heaven and earth: the spiral shell and clam absorb them to generate pearls, and stubborn stones store them to transform into jade. How much more so for the human body, which possesses its own sun and moon—can it not reflect its own light to crystallize its true pearl and produce its true jade? The *Shangqing Collection* states: *\"The operations of heaven and earth largely revolve around Kan and Li. Why does the stone hold jade? Why is the pearl concealed in the clam’s belly? Through this, the celestial mechanism is revealed—truly, the Dao lies before one’s eyes.\"* Yet though the Dao lies before their eyes, scholars often fail to awaken, for the celestial mechanism is too near, and the blind repeatedly overlook it even when facing it directly.\n\nThe mysterious and unfathomable cannot be depicted in diagrams. The sages measured and arranged the primordial foundation. The *Red Dragon Great Elixir Formula* says: *\"There is a thing called the mysterious and unfathomable; the golden elixir arises from this.\"* Silent and vast, subtle and immeasurable—how could it be captured in diagrams? Since it cannot be depicted, it can only be known in the heart and grasped in the mind. Yet what lies within oneself may be known in the heart and grasped in the mind, but when teaching others, how can one not employ images and texts to silently convey its mechanism? Thus, the sages delved into the profound and sought the hidden to elucidate the ultimate mystery of the primordial. They employed broad analogies and layered metaphors to arrange the primordial foundation of the golden elixir—hence the proliferation of alchemical classics and the composition of the *Cantong Qi* in accord with the *Book of Changes*. The \"primordial foundation\" is the root.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.\"* For subduing lead and restraining mercury depend entirely on the Mysterious Female; thus, the Mysterious Female is the root of the returned elixir. When a man establishes the Mysterious Female, his essence and qi are secured; when a woman establishes the Mysterious Female, her monthly courses cease. In cultivation, if one does not know this, from where will the medicinal materials arise? From where will the returned elixir coalesce? From where will the fire phases be applied? The four—Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li—merge directly into the formless.",

      "translated_text": "When the mind settles, spirit congeals and qi harmonizes; the Three Palaces naturally ascend and descend, and the hundred meridians flow unimpeded. Those who diligently practice this will without exception attain transcendence. As Master Gushen states in his *Lucid Treatise*: *\"The Dao of cultivating the body takes utmost spirit as its root, utmost essence as its medicine, harmonious balance as its function, and non-action as its governance. Through non-action, spirit congeals; when spirit congeals, harmonious qi gathers; when harmonious qi gathers, roots deepen and foundations solidify; with deep roots and solid foundations, the Dao of long life and enduring vision is accomplished.\"* To depart from this is not the method of the Golden Elixir and Great Return.\n\nGenerally, the dwelling of qi and blood within the human body values undisturbed cultivation. The practice is most simple and easy: merely embrace the origin, guard the One, concentrate qi, and attain suppleness like an infant. Thus, in the moment of elixir formation, there is no other technique—only emptying the mind, stilling the self, and congealing spirit into the qi cavity, following its ebb and flow with unbroken continuity. Over time, spirit naturally congeals, breath naturally settles; when breath settles, qi gathers; when qi gathers, the elixir forms. There is no need for the labor of massage, daoyin, exhalation and inhalation, or visualization.\n\nThe *Internal Pointers to the Mysterious and Secret* states: *\"When the sun departs, depart with it; when the moon arrives, arrive with it—following its ingress and egress without leaving the Elixir Terrace.\"* From this perspective, the Great Elixir’s Dao relies solely on the singular flavor of primordial harmonious qi to accomplish its transformations; there is no other path.\n\nThe noble one dwells in his chamber, and when his words are good, they resonate a thousand *li* away—just as the lord of ten thousand chariots, secluded in his nine-fold chamber, issues commands that align with the rhythms of yin and yang. The ruler, enthroned in majesty and secluded in profound depths, speaks well, and his words echo a thousand *li* away. Likewise, the cultivator, embracing stillness and silence, turns inward to reflect; when emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its utmost, the qi of Heaven and Earth naturally comes to him. Why? Because this follows the natural principle that when one thing is stimulated, another responds.\n\nWhen issuing commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang, the sage kings of antiquity, in the first month of spring, would order their ministers to spread virtue and harmonize decrees; in the first month of autumn, they would command generals to train soldiers and sharpen weapons—all in accordance with the seasons and the rhythms of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. If this is how governance is conducted, how much more should the Dao of the Elixir be so?\n\n*\"Store the vessel and await the time; do not transgress the hexagram’s day.\"* The *Returning Gold Chapter* states: *\"Do not let the moment slip; remain always within the single yang.\"* In the method of elixir refinement, one must first know the time, and even more, await it. If the time has not yet come, one should only embrace stillness, silence, and emptiness to await it—never forcing it prematurely. As the *Three Medicines Song of Master Zhengyang* says: *\"Preserve the mind, cut off thoughts, and await the crystallization.\"* The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Mysterious* states: *\"Seal the senses, lower the gaze, and silently observe.\"* This is what is meant by *\"storing the vessel and awaiting the time.\"*\n\nAlas! When the hour arrives, without laboring the mind, the internal energies naturally intermingle, naturally coalesce, and congeal. Entering the chamber, one must await the moment when the yellow path of the sunwheel ascends of itself—how could one force it ahead?\n\nThe hexagram *Tun* employs *zi* and *shen*, while *Sui* employs *yin* and *xu*. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its own day; here, I merely present two images without exhaustive detail. In *Tun*, below is *Zhen* and above is *Kan*. *Tun* employs *zi* and *shen*: the initial nine of *Zhen* is the *gengzi* line, and the six in the fourth place of *Kan* is the *wushen* line.",

      "translated_text": "Below is *Kan* and above is *Gen*. *Sui* employs *yin* and *xu*: the initial six of *Kan* is the *wuyin* line, and the six in the fourth place of *Gen* is the *bingxu* line. Now, *zi* and *shen*, *yin* and *xu* are none other than *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire—the Serpent, the Dragon, and the Tiger. All are allegories.\n\nViewing the sixty hexagrams as a whole, they begin with *Tun* and end with *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Between them, yin and yang lines intermingle and intertwine. Though each differs from the next, with their inverted and corresponding forms each finding its own resonance, in truth, hexagram after hexagram follows the same pattern. When Master Wei remarked, *\"I merely present two images without exhaustive detail,\"* he intended for the learner to contemplate the images of *Tun* and *Sui*, and from this initial insight extend it further, thereby intuitively grasping the meaning of the remaining hexagrams.\n\nEach hexagram has six lines; two hexagrams together comprise twelve lines, corresponding to the twelve hours of a day. The sixty hexagrams together comprise three hundred sixty lines, corresponding to the three hundred sixty hours of a month. Master Wei’s original intent was merely to use this framework to discuss the divisions, arrivals, openings, and closings of the fire-phase within our own bodies. For example, if applied to *Xu* and *Song*, one would say: *\"Xu* employs *zi* and *shen*, *Song* employs *yin* and *wu*.\" If applied to *Shi* and *Bi*, one would say: *\"Shi* employs *yin* and *chou*, *Bi* employs *wei* and *shen*.\" The other hexagrams follow this same pattern. Thus he said, *\"I merely present two images without exhaustive detail.\"*\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"The Southern and Northern Schools reverse the hexagrams’ images,\nMorning and evening fire-phases align with the Celestial Pivot.\"*\nThis, too, serves only to elucidate this same principle. If one clings rigidly to the text, mired in the images, and insists on calculating the numerical configurations of the hexagrams’ structures to match the yin and yang of their lines, I fear one will toil endlessly without ever achieving success—wearily laboring, yet never knowing where one is bound. How lamentable!\n\nIn principle, *\"establishing punishments where there is righteousness, bestowing virtue where there is benevolence.\"* The West represents righteousness, the East represents benevolence. Punishment governs killing and subjugation; virtue governs generation and ascent. Now, *\"establishing punishments where there is righteousness\"* refers to forging the lead of the West, while *\"bestowing virtue where there is benevolence\"* refers to refining the mercury of the East. Lead belongs to Metal; its nature is utterly unyielding. Concealed within *Kan*, it cannot ascend unless subjected to fierce firing and extreme forging. Thus, one employs martial fire to compel it, and must not apply civil fire. Mercury belongs to Wood; its nature is utterly yielding. Hidden within *Li*, upon encountering true lead, it naturally ceases movement. Thus, one employs civil fire to refine it, and must not apply martial fire.\n\nThe *Chongzheng Pian* states:\n*\"Defending the city requires the application of civil virtue,\nWhile waging war in the field demands the deployment of martial prowess.\nThese two modes of action must be clearly distinguished;\nProceeding in accord brings good fortune, while going against invites misfortune.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nAccording to the almanac, one must be utterly sincere, focused, and meticulous. The *Gaohongmeng Mengxian Yao* states:\n*\"Gathering has its time, harvesting has its day.\nGather, harvest—be ever vigilant and discreet.\"*\nThus, one must consult the almanac to know the oral instructions for the proper moment. Only with utter sincerity, absolute focus, and no trace of extraneous thought can the divine mushroom be plucked. Likewise, if one remains secluded for a year, from dawn to dusk inwardly circulating the numinous banner, one must maintain utter sincerity and absolute focus, undivided in purpose—only then can the elixir be completed and the body attain immortality. If one treats the Great Dao as child’s play, lightly and carelessly tampering with the celestial mechanism, practicing in the morning only to abandon it by evening, this is not true sincerity.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* states:\n*\"Accumulating merit and refining the elixir do not occur naturally;\nThey arise from precision and sincerity, and from unwavering focus.\"*\nFrom ancient times to the present, those who have cultivated the elixir have never succeeded without sincerity, nor have they ever achieved their aim without wholehearted dedication.\n\nIn ancient times, Yi Qiu instructed two men in the game of *yi*. One devoted himself wholeheartedly, listening only to Yi Qiu’s teachings. The other, though he appeared to listen, was in fact preoccupied with the thought of a swan goose approaching, imagining himself readying his bow and arrow to shoot it. Though he studied alongside the first, he did not match his skill. Now, *yi* is but a minor art—without wholehearted dedication, one cannot master it. How much more so with the Dao?",

      "translated_text": "The *Zuowang Lun* of Sima Ziwei states: \"Only in idleness and tranquility can one cultivate the Dao. For the study of the Dao must attain pure stillness and non-action, and not allow the slightest external matter to burden the mind. If one is inwardly entangled by family affairs or outwardly occupied by official duties, this too is a lack of wholehearted dedication to the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Dadao Ge* of Zhang Xujing declares:\n*\"The spirit guides qi, qi sustains the form—*\n*No need for miscellaneous arts to attain long life.*\n*The art is easy, yet the Dao is hard to encounter;*\n*Even when encountered, without single-minded practice,*\n*Of a thousand or ten thousand who study, barely one or two succeed—*\n*This saying is indeed true.\"*\n\nScholars of today do not understand that immortality is achieved through accumulation. They merely wish to attain it through fleeting moments of playful effort, never considering that even a brief interval is part of the work of coalescing the elixir, while the year-long firing and nurturing—whether walking, sitting, sleeping, or eating—must remain unwavering, lest the fire cool and the elixir’s power wane. How could there be the slightest interruption?\n\nOne must carefully observe the celestial cycles and examine the waxing and waning of qi. The *Wuzhen Pian* states:\n*\"Heaven and earth wax and wane in their own time;*\n*Only by scrutinizing these changes can one grasp the mechanism.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The moon’s waxing and waning corresponds to the rise and fall of spirit;*\n*The sun’s rising and setting aligns with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.\"*\n\nFor within a month, there is the waxing and waning of a month; within a day, there is the waxing and waning of a day. The dark and new moons, the crescent and full moons—these are the waxing and waning of a month. Day and night, dawn and dusk—these are the waxing and waning of a day. The human body models itself on heaven and earth, and the waxing and waning of its qi and blood follow the same path as the transformations of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Suwen* says: \"At dawn, human qi begins to flourish; at noon, yang qi reaches its peak; by dusk, yang qi is depleted, and the qi gates close.\" It also says: \"When the moon first appears, blood and qi begin to refine, and defensive qi begins to circulate. When the moon is full, blood and qi are abundant, and the muscles are firm. When the moon is empty, the muscles diminish, the meridians are depleted, defensive qi departs, and only the form remains.\"\n\nThus, just as heaven and earth have day and night, dawn and dusk, so too does the human body. Just as heaven and earth have dark and new moons, crescents and full moons, so too does the human body. The shifting of cold and heat, the alternation of yin and yang—all correspond to heaven and earth. Therefore, in the elixir method, heaven serves as the crucible, earth as the furnace, and the moon as the agent of the medicine. The gathering of the medicine must follow the moon’s waxing and waning, while the firing process must align with the sun’s rising and setting. From beginning to end, there is not a single moment that does not harmonize with heaven and earth.\n\nAs the *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: *Yin* marks the opening of things, like the *Jingzhe* solar term when the yearly count begins; *Xu* marks the closing of things, like the *Lidong* solar term when the yearly count ends—are these not the firing times of the elixir method? The three hours of *Hai*, *Zi*, and *Chou* are when the sun sinks below the earth and disappears, when the count halts and does not proceed. Within this interval lies the moment when the first yang stirs, when the myriad things have yet to arise—this is how the sage perceives the heart of heaven and earth, and how one models oneself on heaven and earth to complete the myriad things, with creation at one’s command. Is this not the time for gathering the medicine in the elixir method?\n\nIn all matters—drawing and adding, circulating and bathing, joining and binding—one follows the transformations of heaven and earth. This is why it is called the supreme Dao. If one does not rely on the transformations of heaven and earth but seeks other methods, these are but side doors and minor arts, mere conjectures of the mind, not the supreme Dao.\n\nThe *Huainanzi* says: \"The clam’s pearl waxes and wanes with the moon,\" and \"When the moon is empty, the fish’s brain diminishes; when the moon dies, the snail’s flesh withers.\" Even such insignificant creatures correspond to the transformations of heaven and earth—how much more so for humans?\n\nFrom this, we see that when cultivating the elixir at the full moon, qi and blood are full, and the medicine’s power is complete. After the full moon, qi and blood diminish, and the medicine’s power wanes. Thus, the *Cuixu Pian* says: \"On the night of the full moon, one can gather the celestial hun and earthly po to congeal the numinous elixir,\" and also: \"The union of the two eights is the mother of the elixir; seeking the tiger and dragon beyond the full moon is but vain labor.\"\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* further states:\n*\"On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, when the toad’s radiance shines,*\n*It is precisely when metal essence is at its peak.*\n*When the first yang arises at *Fu*, then one may advance the fire—*\n*Do not delay!\"*\n\nThe *Chongzheng Pian* says:\n*\"The metal of *Dui* holds myriad treasures, completing in the west;*\n*At the osmanthus moon’s mid-autumn, its brightness doubles.*\n*This is the time to refine the head and apply the work of gathering—*\n*Wait not for the yang to arise!\"*\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* declares:\n*\"Just at this moment, wondrous and rare,*\n*When the moon in the sky is full at mid-autumn,*\n*Swiftly gather the yang—do not let it linger!*\n*Advance the fire with care, lest danger arise.\"*\n\nThe reference to the eighth month’s fifteenth day, when metal essence is at its peak, does not mean that only on this day can one gather the medicine. Rather, works like *Baizi Qing* and *Liao Chanhui* all specify entering the chamber at the *Zi* hour on the night of the eighth month’s fifteenth. For at this time, yin and yang are in perfect balance, the autumn air is crisp, metal essence is at its height, neither cold nor warm—most suitable for cultivation. The ancient immortals formed the embryo at this time, stealing the metal essence of heaven and earth and drawing in the pure qi of heaven and earth.\n\nSome, failing to receive the true transmission, know not the essence of the matter. They merely absorb the moonlight on the night of the eighth month’s fifteenth—this is like dangling a net to catch the wind or grasping a rope to bind a shadow. How can such a thing be spoken of as the supreme Dao?",
      "overlap_context": "dication.\n\nIn ancient times, Yi Qiu instructed two men in the game of *yi*. One devoted himself wholeheartedly, listening only to Yi Qiu’s teachings. The other, though he appeared to listen, was in fact preoccupied with the thought of a swan goose approaching, imagining himself readying his bow and arrow to shoot it. Though he studied alongside the first, he did not match his skill. Now, *yi* is but a minor art—without wholehearted dedication, one cannot master it. How much more so with the Dao?",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, there is another account. Master Wen Yuan of Chao recorded that during the Tang dynasty, the recluse of Mount Zhongyue, Qizhenzi Shi Jianwu, composed the *Lingxiang Ci*. In its preface, he writes: \"Upon casually perusing the *Three Classics of Stillness*, I read that those who cultivate the Dao must enter the Three Stillnesses to refine spirit and qi, thereby extending life. The Great Stillness lasts three hundred days, the Middle Stillness two hundred, and the Lesser Stillness one hundred.\" Moved by utmost sincerity, he resolved to attempt the Lesser Stillness. Thus, in the third year of the Kaicheng reign (the *wuwu* year), beginning on the first day of the first month (*gengshen*), he shut his door, severed all worldly ties, and adhered strictly to the hundred-day term. Upon emerging from his chamber before the month had passed, his spirit-light shone before his eyes, a hundred spirits gathered at his ears, and his essence and vitality were unclouded—all three responses confirmed that the immortal classics and secret scriptures were not empty teachings.\n\nNow, in the cultivation of the Great Elixir, one must proceed likewise. For only with prolonged stillness do spirit become clear and qi harmonized, the inner vessel perfected—only then can refinement begin. To remain mired in worldly entanglements, exhausting sinew and bone, taxing heart and mind, yet expect to succeed in a single attempt on the fifteenth of the eighth month is most arduous indeed.\n\nIf the slightest mote is amiss, regret and misfortune become thieves. The solstices shift their degrees, the equinoxes deviate east and west, midwinter transforms into scorching summer, midsummer reverses into hail and snow. Lead and mercury scatter, myriad anomalies erupt—all because the fire and timing are awry. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Though one may recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire’s timing, it is as idle as a vast city. Cultivation depends entirely on this power; even a hair’s divergence fails to produce the Elixir.\"\n\nThe so-called *fire* is not the imagined flame between heart and kidney, but the body’s innate true fire. The so-called *timing* is not the measured moments of the clock, but the body’s natural qi rhythms. Fire’s nature flares with wind and hides with earth; its use must neither exceed nor fall short. One must gently fan it with *xun*-wind, fiercely conceal it with *kun*-earth, ensuring moderation without excess or deficiency. Then, great and small remain unharmed, both realms preserved, and in an instant, the Elixir’s head appears. This is what is meant by \"adjusting and applying.\"\n\nIf even a hair’s breadth errs, the solstices shift, the equinoxes stray, midwinter becomes scorching summer, midsummer turns to hail, lead and mercury flee, and anomalies proliferate.\n\nThe filial adept’s intent moves the August Ultimate. As the *Fuming Pian* says: \"One man and one woman draw upon heaven and earth; three daughters and three sons unite beginning and end.\" For Qian begets three sons, Kun bears three daughters—together called the Six Children. Now, Qian as father and Kun as mother occupy above and below, while the Six Children move between them, ascending and descending, ever following their parents—hence the name \"filial child.\" The August Ultimate is the central, correct position, the convergence of the eight directions. When the filial adept’s intent moves it, tigers roar, dragons emerge from their caves, phoenixes dance, and the Elixir enters the golden city.\n\nBut if one’s actions are rebellious and discordant with the Ultimate, the dark pearl scatters, the numinous mercury flees, and the Six Children become not filial heirs but rebels against the Elixir Way.\n\nThus may one invite misfortune or summon blessing, bring about peace or incite war—these four outcomes arise from the heart’s resolve. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: \"Fire is born of wood, yet its edge is hidden; without skillful drilling, do not force it. Disaster springs from this—harming oneself. One must master and subdue it, seeking the Metal Elder. With the medicine present and the fire’s timing applied, metal is pressed by fire, surging to the Li Palace, transforming into water, which in turn restrains fire—thus fire avoids the peril of flaring upward. Without the medicine, the fire’s timing drives empty yang to attack, precisely what burns the body. Herein lies the division between inviting misfortune and summoning blessing.\"\n\nAgain, it says: \"Sun and moon meet once every thirty days; timing is easily changed. The method lies in divine skill—guarding the city, waging wild battles, knowing defense, and increasing fortune. When the numinous cinnabar fills the vessel, crimson, true lead arises from the Kan Palace, turbid and unmoving. To capture and restrain the true mercury of the Li Palace, one must use martial fire, fiercely refining and forging until it soars upward. Upon reaching the Li Palace and uniting with true mercury, one must then guard the city and bathe—no further fire may be added. Herein lies the vast difference between peace and war.\"\n\nWhether one invites misfortune or summons blessing, brings peace or incites war—how could this arise from anything other than the heart’s reflection? It is simply a matter of turning inward.",

      "translated_text": "The movement and stillness follow constant principles, adhering to their guiding line. When utterly still, one returns to the root and recovers tranquility—this is the time of Kun. I then wait in stillness; when stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and yang qi subtly germinates in the Yellow Bell Palace—this is the time of Fu. I then move in response. Thus it is said: \"Movement and stillness follow constant principles, adhering to their guiding line.\" If, when one should move, stillness is mixed in, or when one should be still, movement is interposed; if one forces growth prematurely or neglects it afterward—this is not adhering to the guiding line.\n\nThe perfected ones of antiquity moved in accord with the heavens and were still as the abyss. When it was time to move, they moved; when it was time to be still, they were still—there was always a constant method. Today’s scholars, unaware that the alchemical method’s movement and stillness follow constant principles, either cling solely to movement or solely to stillness. What they call \"movement\" is merely the movement of circulating qi; what they call \"stillness\" is merely the stillness of dhyāna-samādhi—both miss the mark entirely.\n\nDoes not Chapter 39 of the *Zhixuan* state: \"Every person’s qi and blood naturally flow, nourishing and defending, with yin and yang cycling through the hundred moments—how could this depend on shutting the door to practice circulating qi? It is like placing another head atop one’s own.\" When has circulating qi ever been considered true movement? Does not the *Cui Xu Pian* state: \"Only this Qian and Kun truly operate—there is no need to sit rigidly, speechless, thoughtless, and mindless, for the spirit will only grow dull. How could one then congeal it into an immortal embryo?\" How could dhyāna-samādhi ever be considered true stillness?\n\nThe *Jindan Dacheng Ji* says: \"Yang governs movement; yin governs stillness.\" The *Cui Xu* states: \"Within movement, seek stillness; within stillness, there is action.\" Movement and stillness have their proper roles—how could those who merely parrot transmitted teachings presume to lightly discuss them?\n\n**Harmonizing with the seasons and aligning with qi**\nThe four seasons are the spring, summer, autumn, and winter within the body. When practicing inner work, one must skillfully regulate and harmonize with their proper times, so that warmth, coolness, cold, and heat each find their place. Lü Chunyang’s poem says: \"When water and fire are balanced, the medicine is formed; if yin and yang are mismatched, the elixir fails.\" All success lies in this regulation.\n\n**Firmness and softness are distinct, not intermingling**\nFirmness is yang; softness is yin. \"Firmness and softness are distinct, not intermingling\" means that when yang’s firmness is at work, the intent is wholly directed downward—it must not encroach upon the upper. When yin’s softness is at work, the intent is wholly directed upward—it must not encroach upon the lower. As Zhang Ziyang’s *Shiqiao Ge* says: \"Water generates fire, fire generates water—water and fire must be ordered in sequence.\" This is what is meant.\n\n**The Five Phases guard their boundaries, not recklessly expanding or contracting**\nThe *Wang Liangqi Tiantong Jing Song* states: \"Metal, wood, earth, water, and fire—all five guard the single cinnabar field. Who says one may succeed without such guarding?\" For when these five are dispersed, they become qi circulating throughout the body; when gathered, they form the treasure in the cinnabar field. Now, if they are steadfastly and single-mindedly guarded in the cinnabar field without reckless expansion or contraction, they will blend and fuse, transforming into a single qi that congeals into golden liquid.\n\n\"Expansion\" refers to excess; \"contraction\" refers to insufficiency. The *Cui Xu Pian* says: \"The numinous mercury, connected to the true, undergoes many transformations—it is only fitting to preserve and guard it, not to overdo it. For excess harms the thing, while insufficiency fails to generate it. One should only maintain it ceaselessly, as if present, guarding it with intent.\" With prolonged guarding, when the time arrives and qi transforms, the vessel will be full and must overflow—then the numinous spirits will naturally come.\n\n**The Yi flows ceaselessly, bending and extending, turning and returning**\nThe *Yi* is the sun and moon.",

      "translated_text": "The sun and moon traverse the ecliptic, circulating ceaselessly day and night. In the first half of the month, yang expands while yin contracts, the *hun* grows and the *po* wanes; in the latter half, yin expands while yang contracts, the *hun* wanes and the *po* grows. This cycle repeats endlessly, without cessation.\n\nThe human body, with the head as *qian* and the abdomen as *kun*, resembles heaven and earth. Its two qi ascend and descend just as in heaven and earth. The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"The sun and moon constantly traverse the ecliptic and the celestial equator. All immortals who cultivate this method to refine the returning elixir do so in a way no different from heaven and earth.\" Yet the key to emulating the sun and moon’s movements and achieving the same efficacy as heaven and earth lies in the *Ren* and *Du* meridians.\n\nThe *Ren* and *Du* meridians are the seas of yin and yang for the entire body, the pivot for the five qi and true origin. The *Ren* meridian begins below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic region, follows the inner abdomen up to *Guanyuan*, reaches the throat, and is the sea of yin meridians. The *Du* meridian begins at the *Xiaji* point, runs alongside the spine up to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, ascends to the crown, follows the forehead to the bridge of the nose, and is the sea of yang meridians.\n\nThe *Ren* meridian is so named because women rely on it for conception and nourishment. The *Du* meridian is so called because it oversees and governs the sea of meridians. Deer live long, reaching five hundred years as white deer and a thousand as blue deer, for they can unblock their *Du* meridian. Creatures like cranes, toads, and toads all live a thousand years, for they can unblock their *Ren* meridian.\n\nThe *Nanhua Zhenjing* states: \"Follow the *Du* as your guiding principle, and you can preserve the body and safeguard life.\" If one can unblock these two meridians, all meridians will flow freely, naturally circulating throughout the body without stagnation or blockage—this is the way to attain longevity. The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* says: \"If the water of the method can ascend to the mysterious pass, one may wander freely day and night, ceaselessly revolving the wheel within. Stagnation gives rise to all illnesses; unblocked flow preserves youth—is this not the meaning?\"\n\nAs the poem by Langranzi says:\n*\"Ascend the current straight to the Mud Pill Palace,\nUnblocked joints and passages preserve youth.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Constantly let qi surge through the joints,\nNaturally essence fills and the Valley Spirit abides—\nAre these mere empty words?\"*\n\nChen Tuan regarded it as transforming the foul and turbid qi, while Han Xiaoyao saw it as turning the wheel without pause, achieving harmony with the mysterious within a month. If there is action, it is yet no action; if there is stillness, it is yet not stillness. From the secret transmissions of the Supreme Primordial Lord down through the generations to the present, apart from this Way, there is no other.

      "translated_text": "Alas, how is it that scholars of this world ever delight in difficulty yet disdain simplicity, seek the distant yet neglect the near? Though there be those who possess the Way and wish to reveal it, who would believe them? The *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"The world takes no joy in the true Dharma, preferring instead to discourse on what lies east or west.\" Unless one thoroughly comprehends the workings of yin and yang and sees through the transformations of creation, none will trust this.\n\nWithin the span of a single dark-and-dawn—*that is, the thirty and a half days before midnight*—in the alchemical arts, when time replaces days, the juncture of *hai* and *zi* each day is precisely this dark-and-dawn. At this moment, heaven and earth first opened; at this moment, sun and moon conjoin; at this moment, grasses and trees germinate; at this moment, the yin and yang of the human body unite. When immortals undertake the elixir at this time, inner truth and outer resonance align as perfectly as tallying tokens—neither too soon nor too late, but precisely at the center. Among the four virtues of the *Book of Changes*, this is the interval between *zhen* and *yuan*; among the twelve hexagrams, it is the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*—the most wondrous point for heaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nChaos and the primordial vastness—this is the time before the division of the one qi. The union of female and male—this is when yin and yang mingle within it, not yet parted. When they have not yet parted, spirit congeals and qi gathers, blending into oneness. Within, one is unaware of one’s own body; without, one knows not the cosmos. With the Dao, one merges in darkness; ten thousand thoughts all vanish. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—perforce called the Great One containing true qi, or the primordial unity of precelestial qi. The *Cuixu Pian* says: \"The great medicine must rely on spirit, qi, and essence, gathering them in one place to form the cinnabar head. It is simply the precelestial qi refined into yellow sprouts, blooming as jade flowers.\" For the immortals’ cultivation, there is no other method but to gather the precelestial unity of qi as the mother of the golden elixir. Practice diligently, and in days you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"Gather the qi of the undivided Two Modes, seize the essence of the first mating of dragon and tiger. Flash into the yellow chamber and forge it into the supreme treasure.\" And again: \"Gathering requires utmost sincerity; discern the ugly and the fair. It is most difficult to grasp the subtle thread, easy to lose. The cold spring fears only that scholars cling to effortful doing, failing to comprehend the precelestial of the great Dao, mired in gathering yet unable to find its pulse.\" The *Chongzheng Pian* says: \"In the ten-thousand-fathom icy abyss, beneath the sleeping dragon’s chin, the pearl glows red. Guard it closely, disturb it not, and only then may you gather it. Follow the hours and days, rely on spiritual work.\" For gathering is gathering without gathering; taking is taking without taking. In the midst of stillness and stability, there is nothing to be done through action.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor lost his mysterious pearl and sent Knowledge to seek it; sent Li Zhu to seek it; sent Chi Gou to seek it—none found it. Only Xiangwang obtained it. Xiangwang means \"formless and traceless.\" Only when form is absent and traces vanish can the precelestial unity of qi be attained. The *Jirang Ji*’s *Xiantian Yin* says: \"A piece of the precelestial is called the Great Void. When nothing is done, the true richness appears.\" And again: \"If you ask about the precelestial, there is not a single word. Only after the postcelestial must one apply effort.\" This is indeed so. Before the Supreme Ultimate divided, before yin and yang parted—this is the precelestial of heaven and earth. In terms of the elixir arts, it is the time of utter stillness, returning to the root and reverting to tranquility. The *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: \"Utterly still, unmoving, yet responsive when stirred—one glimpses the workings of yin and yang. Truly, when utterly still and unmoving, the heart communes with heaven, and the transformations of creation may be seized.\" The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Seek not the transformations of creation within the kidneys; rather, seek the precelestial within the heart.\" This is most profoundly and clearly expressed. The *Jirang Ji*’s *Silü Yin* says: \"Before thoughts arise, the spirit of the mysterious female is unknown.\" The *Huánjīn Pian* says: \"Where the spirit of the mysterious female is unseen, dragon and tiger quietly seek each other.\" The great Way of the precelestial must be attained through utmost emptiness and profound stillness—no trace of thought may intrude.\n\nAt the moment of utter stillness and unmoving, when ten thousand thoughts are extinguished, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks conceal their mists, sun and moon pause their radiance, the jade pivot ceases turning, the eight vessels return to the source, and breath itself vanishes. One sinks deeply into the profound and obscure, utterly unaware of heaven as canopy or earth as chariot, nor of the world’s people or one’s own body. After a little while, the three palaces fill with qi, the mechanism stirs, and the mysterious female sings. With a single sword, one cleaves open chaos; with two hands, one rips apart the primordial vastness—this is called \"nothing giving birth to being.\" The poem of Master Ningxuan says: \"Not in the dust of toil, not in the mountains—one must seek precisely the profound and obscure.\" Is this not true?\n\nNowadays, people know not the ancestor of the great Dao. Some point to true lead as the precelestial; some to the \"heavenly one generating water\" as the precelestial; some to the single gleam between the two kidneys as the precelestial; some to the navel as the precelestial; some to the ancestral breath of the nose as the precelestial; some to the movement of qi as the precelestial. These are all fragmentary views, plucking branches and leaves—they are not the precelestial of the great Dao. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Precelestial, yet heaven does not oppose it; postcelestial, yet one follows heaven’s timing.\" \"Precelestial, yet heaven does not oppose it\"—this is the pure spontaneity of heavenly principle, which even heaven cannot contravene. \"Postcelestial, yet one follows heaven’s timing\"—when the time of heaven arrives, one should comply with it. Who but the most profoundly penetrating could partake of this?\n\nMoistening fluids and nourishing essences flow and circulate, transforming and communicating. The *Huandan Pian* says: \"For ten thousand miles, yin settles as spring’s qi conjoins; through nine skies, clarity pervades as dew’s essence congeals.\" Ah! This is the true scene of yin and yang’s mutual arousal—precisely at this time. Spirit and essence extend in all four directions, flowing without limit. Above, they reach heaven; below, they coil upon the earth. Dimly, like mountain mist; hazily, like water’s vapor; gently, like winter snow gradually congealing; deeply, like fermented liquid slowly clearing—this is the intertwining of heaven and earth within the body, the union of male and female within the body. When the time arrives and qi transforms, stirred into communication, suddenly the fire-wheel scorches the earth’s veins, startlingly the divine spring gushes from the mountain’s peak. Between heaven and earth, all is moistened and greatly enriched.\n\nThe *Jirang Ji*’s *Huanghu Yin* says: \"In the indistinct, yin and yang first transform; in the intertwining, heaven and earth first revolve. Within, a little good scenery—how can effort enter words?\" Unless one personally attains true realization, who would believe in such a real scene?",

      "translated_text": "The spirits of heaven and earth are beyond measure; when yin and yang intersect, the divine and demonic conceal themselves—this is the moment of heaven and earth’s spiritual power. When dragon and tiger intertwine, the *gui*-spirits remain unaware—this is the moment of our body’s spiritual power. Uniting the body’s spiritual power with that of heaven and earth, the inner truth externally responds: within stillness, the *xun*-gate suddenly opens, and both sides ascend in unison, merging as one.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* states: \"Only in the formless and imageless realm lies the root of eternal life without death.\" Truly, only by forgetting form and image can one witness it. If it could be attained through deliberate contemplation, calculation, or measurement, it would no longer be called spiritual power.\n\n**Utilizing and Concealing the Body, Hiding the Form**\nAt the new moon, sun and moon conjoin in the north, their radiance hidden from sight. In the elixir method, the time is shifted to midnight, at the cusp of *kun* and *fu*. Cross-legged and seated like an unmoving mountain, mouth sealed and breath stilled like a hibernating winter serpent—this is \"utilizing and concealing the body, hiding the form.\" At this moment, containing light in silence, one inwardly reflects. With each exhalation and inhalation, long and unbroken, the qi meanders back to the life-root. Over time, one feels profound and guarded, as if standing at the edge of an unfathomable abyss. This is the time when spirit and qi return to their root, body and mind revert to their mandate, and golden liquid coagulates.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* says: \"When qi enters the cinnabar field to nourish the white crow, only then is it called the sprouting of the yellow sprout.\" If the mind-monkey is restless and the intent-horse gallops outward, spirit and qi scatter externally—how could one hope to congeal the returning elixir?\n\n**The Fire Phases and Lunar Cycles**\nIt begins in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then turns rightward. The wheel of fire disgorges its bud, and the hidden pool reveals its image; radiant essence scatters above *Mao* and *Bi*. *Zhen* emerges as the first yang, the inception of yang qi. In the *Qian* hexagram, the *ninth-one* is the \"hidden dragon,\" for yang is established by three and yin by eight, thus communication occurs. On the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth day, *Dui* moves. The *ninth-two* is the \"visible dragon,\" harmonious and luminous; the virtues of three and five are complete, and the *Qian* body is formed. The *ninth-three* is \"vigilant at dusk,\" its divine tally waxing and waning, gradually returning to its origin. *Xun* continues its lineage, firmly governing and sustaining. The *ninth-four* is \"perhaps leaping,\" its path perilous; *Gen* controls advance and retreat, not overstepping its time. On the twenty-third day, it guards the *xiaxu* period. The *ninth-five* is the \"flying dragon in the heavens,\" exalted and joyous; the *sixth-five* of *Kun* receives and binds, completing the cycle, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. The *ninth-six* is the \"exhausted dragon,\" its virtue contending in the wilds.\n\nThe northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, is where the fire phase begins. Above *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* emerges as the first yang—*Zhen* is also the trigram where the fire phase commences. The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"There is a path where mother and child part ways; its wonder lies in *Wei*, *Ji*, *Niu*, *Dou*, and *Nü*.\" This is what it refers to.\n\nThis chapter cites the six precelestial trigrams and the six lines of *Qian* to symbolize the waxing and waning of the moon, interspersed with the twenty-eight lunar lodges where the moon resides—all are metaphors. If scholars lack the oral transmission and rashly read this, few will avoid bewilderment of both mind and eye.\n\nThe fire phases of elixir refinement are no different from the moon’s waxing and waning. On the third day, the moon begins to brighten, starting in the northeast at *Ji* and *Dou*, then turning rightward until evening, when the wheel disgorges its bud above *Mao* and *Bi* in the southwest. Its image resembles *Zhen*; in terms of the *Qian* hexagram, it corresponds to the *ninth-one*—this metaphorically describes the initial stirring of yang fire in the body. On the eighth day, the moon ascends to *shangxu*, its light half-bright; its image resembles *Dui*, corresponding to the *ninth-two* of *Qian*—this metaphorically describes the halfway point of yang fire’s work in the body. On the fifteenth day, the moon is full, its spirit abundant and light complete; its image resembles *Qian*, corresponding to the *ninth-three*—this metaphorically describes the time of yang fire’s fulfillment in the body. On the sixteenth day, the full moon wanes, and the lunar essence begins; its image resembles *Xun*, corresponding to the *ninth-four*—this metaphorically describes the beginning of yin tally’s succession in the body. On the twenty-third day, the moon descends to *xiaxu*, its light half-diminished; its image resembles *Gen*, corresponding to the *ninth-five*—this metaphorically describes the halfway point of yin tally’s work in the body. On the twenty-fifth to thirtieth days, the moon’s light vanishes; its image resembles *Kun*, corresponding to the *ninth-six*—this metaphorically describes the time of yin tally’s completion in the body.\n\nWhy does Master Wei use the six trigrams to illustrate the fire phases and pair them with the six lines of *Qian*? Because the elixir is the treasure of pure yang, and *Qian* is the hexagram of pure yang. Yet among the six trigrams, *Qian* is called the *ninth-three*, \"vigilant at dusk, its divine tally waning,\" and *Kun* is called the *ninth-six*, \"the exhausted dragon contending in the wilds\"—why is this? Because guarding the city with *Qian* employs civility, while battling in the wilds with *Kun* employs martiality; both require vigilance against danger and caution against peril.\n\n**The Use of Nine**\n\"Using nine, gracefully it becomes the Dao’s compass and square.\" When the yang numbers are exhausted, they begin anew, cycling in accord with nature and aligning with inherent virtue. Revolving and abiding by the celestial pivot, ascending and descending, flowing through the six lines—difficult to perceive, thus it has no fixed position, becoming the ancestral origin of the *Yi*.\n\nNine is the yang number. The *Yi* states: \"Three for heaven, two for earth, relying on these numbers.\" It draws from the generative numbers of the five phases: heaven-one, heaven-three, heaven-five—three heavens rely on one another to form nine; earth-two, earth-four—two earths rely on one another to form six. This is why *Kun* uses six and *Qian* uses nine.\n\nIn the elixir method, \"using nine\" refers to the nine revolutions of the fire phase within a single period, modeled after *Qian*. \"Using nine, gracefully it becomes the Dao’s compass and square; when the yang numbers are exhausted, they begin anew\"—each line passes, and another arrives, without the slightest deviation. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"Within the numbers, nothing is lost; the fire phases must not lag.\" This is what it refers to.\n\n**Emotion and Nature**\nEmotion is metal; nature is wood.",

      "translated_text": "Within one thing, division creates two—separated as east and west. Yet if one grasps the mechanism of the Dipper’s handle and sets it in motion, then wood-nature loves metal, and metal-emotion yearns for wood, no longer divided. Thus it is said: \"Push emotion to unite with nature, revolving together in accord with the turning jade pivot—ascending and descending, rising and falling.\"\n\nThe ceaseless flow through the six lines is difficult to observe, hence \"without fixed position\" becomes the ancestral principle of the *Yi*. This flow permeates the body: heaven hides within it, and earth hides within it—like the six lines’ ceaseless transformation. The \"six lines\" refer to the six lines of the *Qian* hexagram. Extend this principle, and it expands into six hexagrams, sixty hexagrams—its meaning remains one.\n\nThe *Huánjīn Piān* says: \"At nine revolutions, the mysterious mechanism reaches its apex; open the furnace, release the fire, and the lid flies off.\" This refers to the nine revolutions of the fire phase, beginning at *yín* and ending at *xū*—the secret of the fire timing within the furnace. Within it lie the wonders of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, the subtleties of bathing and conjoining. Thus it is called the ultimate mystery.\n\nIf one does not know this, even with true medicine in hand, how can the elixir be formed? This is why Master Wei dared not lightly disclose it, merely borrowing the *Qian* hexagram’s \"using nine\" to hint at its mechanism. From this perspective, the immortals’ returning elixir is the *Yi* within the body; the nine revolutions of the fire phase are the *Qian* within the body. Yet the *Qian* within the body has no visible lines, no observable images or numbers—welcomed, its beginning is unseen; followed, its end is unseen. How then could it have a form to observe?\n\nAt the new moon’s dawn, *Fù* arrives: yang qi begins to flow, entering and exiting without haste. Erect a marker—subtle and firm. When the Yellow Bell aligns with *zǐ*, signs emerge, spreading warmth and gentle steam, attaining constancy. *Fù* is the hexagram of one yang. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Yellow Bell; in a day, it is midnight (*zǐ*); in a month, the first to the third day’s half; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *zǐ*. At this time, yang qi first flows, like the initial stirring of yang fire within the body. The fire qi is most subtle—neither indulgent nor restrained, neither hasty nor sluggish—allowing gentle warmth to spread within the crucible.\n\nThe *Chóngzhèng Piān* says: \"The Yellow Bell is *zǐ*, the first arising of yang, the initial reception of qi. The number has not yet increased; the fire should be warm, not scorching. One fears the dragon’s weakness and the tiger’s overbearing might.\" In the first line’s movement, yang first flows—one can only raise it lightly, silently, not yet applying force. Thus it is said: \"Entering and exiting without haste.\" Yet it must not be too soft; one must stir the crown gate’s mechanism, gently lifting it. Thus it is said: \"Erect a marker—subtle and firm.\" Soon, the fire’s power blazes, driving out true lead to the region of the Winnowing Basket and Dipper. Then the river chariot dares not linger, halting its movement to ascend Kunlun’s peak.\n\nThe *Jīndān Dàchéng Jí* says:\n*The Fù hexagram rises with the hidden dragon; at wù-sì, adjust slightly, do not attack.\nAt nine-two, the dragon appears in the Lín hexagram, mastering spiritual penetration.\nFrom here, the furnace’s order reddens step by step.\nWhen the Fáng hexagram arrives, fierce fire burns dry, borrowing the xùn wind.\nRefining the yellow sprout and white snow, the marvelous work returns to the Kūn Dao—\nHere the fire phase’s secrets are exhausted.*\n\nWhen tending the furnace, apply the firing sequence to open the path—light gradually brightens, growing day by day. *Chǒu*’s Great Frame forms, its rhythm rising and falling. *Lín* is the hexagram of two yangs. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Great Frame; in a day, it is cockcrow (*chǒu*); in a month, the third day’s half to the fifth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *chǒu*. At this time, yang qi gradually advances, like the body’s yang fire gradually flowing smoothly, the yellow path gradually brightening. Thus it is said: \"Light brightens, gradually advancing, growing day by day.\"\n\n*Tài* is the hexagram of three yangs, where firm and yielding flourish together, yin and yang conjoin—small departs, great arrives, converging at *yín*’s movement to follow the season. In terms of pitch, it corresponds to the Great Cluster; in a day, it is dawn (*yín*); in a month, the sixth to the eighth day’s half; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *yín*. At this time, yang qi emerges from the earth, like the body’s three yangs ascending—gradually rising, gradually lifting. One must swiftly drive the river chariot back into the crucible. Thus it is said: \"Moving to follow the season.\" At this stage of the fire phase’s movement, one must not pause.\n\nYet there is *yín* of a day, and *yín* of a moment. As the *Zǐ* poem says:\n*\"Diligently swallow saliva a thousand times,\nLong remember to guard the spirit at the fifth watch.\"*\nThis speaks of *yín* of a day.\n\nThe *Jīndān Dàchéng Jí* says:\n*\"When the three yangs meet the Tài hexagram,\nOne may advance the fire’s method and spiritual work.\"*\nThis speaks of *yín* of a moment.\n\nThe *yín* of a day naturally follows the celestial stems and branches as its measure—many in the world know this. But the *yín* of a moment is the body’s fire phase secret. Ancient and modern alchemical texts dare not speak of it plainly—truly, among thousands or tens of thousands, only one or two know it. Profound! Profound!",
      "overlap_context": "\n\nIn the elixir method, \"using nine\" refers to the nine revolutions of the fire phase within a single period, modeled after *Qian*. \"Using nine, gracefully it becomes the Dao’s compass and square; when the yang numbers are exhausted, they begin anew\"—each line passes, and another arrives, without the slightest deviation. The *Fuming Pian* says: \"Within the numbers, nothing is lost; the fire phases must not lag.\" This is what it refers to.\n\n**Emotion and Nature**\nEmotion is metal; nature is wood.",

      "translated_text": "Gradually progressing through *Dàzhuàng*, the yang energy aligns with the *mǎo* gate, where elm pods fall and return to their root—*xíng* and *dé* counterbalance as day and night first divide.\n\n*Dàzhuàng* is the hexagram of four yang lines, corresponding to the *Jiázhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks dawn at *mǎo*; in a month, the eighth to the tenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *mǎo*. At this time, yin assists yang, qi gathers, and beings emerge. This illustrates the body’s yang fire at its midpoint, where the qi phase is evenly balanced—hence the saying, “*xíng* and *dé* counterbalance as day and night first divide.” Yet while all things flourish in spring, why do elm pods fall now? Because within yang, yin resides.\n\n*Guài* is the hexagram where yin retreats as yang ascends, washing and shaking off the dust of old perches. *Guài* is the hexagram of five yang lines, corresponding to the *Gūxǐ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *chén* hour of the morning meal; in a month, the eleventh to the thirteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *chén*. Now yang qi is abundant, pressing near the celestial heights—illustrating the body’s yang fire rising. Thus it speaks of “yang ascending forward,” and also of “washing and shaking off the dust of old perches,” for when the great roc prepares to migrate to the celestial pond, it strikes the water to ascend, its momentum surging forth.\n\n*Qián* is the hexagram of vigorous strength, its brilliance spreading to the four neighbors—yang culminates at *sì* and interacts. *Qián* is the hexagram of six yang lines, corresponding to the *Zhōnglǚ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *sì* hour of midday; in a month, the thirteenth to the fifteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *sì*. Now yang qi is at its peak, pervading all under heaven—illustrating the body’s yang fire reaching fullness, where the elixir’s radiance appears. The mountain spirit’s effluence divides into four streams, flowing down to nourish the land, its influence encompassing all—hence the saying, “spreading to the four neighbors.” It also speaks of “yang culminating at *sì* and interacting,” for when the yang fire’s number ends, the yin tally begins.\n\n*Gòu* marks the inception of yin’s thread, treading frost first at the well’s cold spring. *Wǔ* is *Ruíbīn*, where the guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host. *Gòu* is the hexagram of one yin line, corresponding to the *Ruíbīn* pitch. In a day, it marks noon at *wǔ*; in a month, the sixteenth to the eighteenth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *wǔ*. Now yin qi begins to arise—illustrating the body’s yin tally taking root. Once the numinous elixir enters the mouth, it returns to the cold spring. One must gently guide it back to the cinnabar field, without haste or urgency—hence the saying, “treading frost first at the well’s cold spring,” and also “the guest submits to yin, and yin becomes the host,” for when one yin governs, the many yangs become guests. “Guest” means reverence, caution against peril and vigilance against danger.\n\n*Dùn* is the hexagram of withdrawing from the world, gathering one’s essence, cherishing virtue, and awaiting the time in obscurity. *Dùn* is the hexagram of two yin lines, corresponding to the *Línzhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks the *wèi* hour of the afternoon; in a month, the eighteenth to the twentieth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *wèi*. Now yin qi gradually lengthens—illustrating the body’s yin tally departing the *wǔ* position, withdrawing and descending, like a worthy retreating to seclusion in mountain valleys—hence the saying, “cherishing virtue, awaiting the time in obscurity.”\n\n*Pǐ* is the hexagram of blockage, where nothing sprouts, yin advances and yang recedes, names and reputations are marred. *Pǐ* is the hexagram of three yin lines, corresponding to the *Yízé* pitch. In a day, it marks the *shēn* hour of dusk; in a month, the twenty-first to the twenty-third day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *shēn*. Now yang qi gradually wanes—illustrating the body’s yin tally descending further, like the three yins’ austere season when grasses and trees wither—hence the saying, “yin advances and yang recedes, names and reputations are marred.”\n\n*Guān* is the hexagram of observing the scales, discerning the autumnal mood, where the young and tender are stored, the old and withered revive—shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, sprouting forth under cover. *Guān* is the hexagram of four yin lines, corresponding to the *Nánlǚ* pitch. In a day, it marks the *yǒu* hour of sunset; in a month, the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *yǒu*. Now yin assists yang’s work, and all things contract to fruition—illustrating the body’s yin tally passing its midpoint, descending into the cinnabar field, like trees withdrawing blossoms to bear fruit—hence the saying, “storing the young and tender.” Yet while all things wither in autumn, why do shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout now? Because within yin, yang resides.\n\n*Bō* is the hexagram of decay, where limbs rot and forms dissolve, qi transforms and exhausts, the utmost spirit is lost. *Bō* is the hexagram of five yin lines, corresponding to the *Wúshè* pitch. In a day, it marks the *xū* hour of twilight; in a month, the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *xū*. Now yang qi declines and perishes, fruits on branches rot and fall to the earth—illustrating the body’s yin tally nearing its end, where spiritual work has no place to act—hence the saying, “qi transforms and exhausts, the utmost spirit is lost.” Fire is born at *yín*, flourishes at *wǔ*, and is buried at *xū*—*xū* is the time of enclosure. The fire phase of a moment concludes here, as the *Fùmìng* chapter says: “East and west, movement and stillness, unite at dawn and dusk.” The fire phase of a day also rests here, as Lü Chunyang’s poem says: “Day after day, following him out and sinking again.” Trivial side gates and minor arts know only one aspect but not the other—how could they ever fully comprehend this?\n\nWhen the Way is exhausted, it returns to *Kūn*’s origin, ever compliant with earth’s patterns, bearing heaven’s mandate to spread the profound and distant, bridging the subtle and obscure. It nurtures the seeds of yin and yang’s source, vast and indistinct, without discernible beginning. Those who lose the track first wander astray; later, they become the lord and ruler.\n\n*Kūn* is the hexagram of six yin lines, corresponding to the *Yìngzhōng* pitch. In a day, it marks the *hài* hour of the night’s quiet; in a month, the twenty-eighth to the thirtieth day; in a year, the month when the Dipper’s handle points to *hài*. Now pure yin governs, and all things return to their root to renew their mandate—illustrating the body’s yin tally reaching its limit, then becoming utterly still, returning to the root and restoring tranquility—hence the saying, “When the Way is exhausted, it returns to *Kūn*’s origin.” “Ever compliant with earth’s patterns, bearing heaven’s mandate to spread” echoes the earlier passage: “The metal elixir arises from the sun, receiving the solar tally at dawn”—for heaven, earth, sun, and moon are one.",

      "translated_text": "The moon receives the sun’s light, yet the sun is not diminished thereby—thus the moon’s light is the sun’s light. Heaven’s *qi* descends to earth, and all living things within the earth are born of heaven’s *qi*. The human body models heaven above and mirrors earth below; the interplay of yin and yang within it differs not from that of heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Returning to the Origin* chapter states: “With spirit returning to *qi*, the inner elixir’s Dao naturally forms.” If one can turn inward, gather spirit, and merge it into the *qi*-cavern, then spirit abides, life-*qi* congeals into liquid. When the celestial mechanism stirs, the red lotus holds its bud, dewdrops gather in jade hues, and as they descend into the Flower Pool, drop by drop, the cinnabar field coalesces—forming the elixir’s pivot.\n\n“Vast and distant, faintly linked” refers to the juncture between *hài* and *zǐ*, the threshold where yin and yang exchange. At the moment when six yin lines reach their limit and the first yang has yet to arise, all is still and silent, as in the primordial chaos before heaven and earth divided. It is at this hour that the immortal forges the elixir: sealing the senses, lowering the eyelids, and directing the spirit’s light downward into the *kǎn* palace. At first, all is dim and obscure, like moonlight steeped in a frigid pool. Then spirit and *qi* unite, faintly communicating across barriers—akin to a lodestone drawing iron.\n\n“Corresponding to pitch, nurturing the seed of yin and yang’s origin” describes the elixir-making process as mirroring the time when pure *Kūn* governs in the *hài* month. Then all things return to their root, sealing themselves in winter’s hibernation. Though winter rules concealment, the year’s generative power is in truth conceived within it—merely hidden, its traces unseen by men. Thus the ancients named this pure yin month the “yang month,” for at the *xiǎoxuě* solar term, yang *qi* already stirs beneath the six yin lines. Accumulating until the winter solstice, it fills one yang stroke, transforming into the *Fù* hexagram.\n\nThe elixir’s Dao follows the same pattern: when night’s *qi* is not yet spent, one gathers spirit, collects *qi*, and sits upright for a brief while. Soon spirit and *qi* return to their root, and from nothing, something arises—gradually congealing, accumulating into a single droplet of golden essence.\n\nThe *Emerald Canopy* chapter states: “Golden essence is the medicine of the *Kūn* palace.” *Kūn* lies in the southwest, the river’s source; the toad’s glow shines all day upon the western river—this is the medicine’s root. For the first yang does not arise in *Fù* but in *Kūn*. Though *Kūn* is utmost yin, within yin yang is born—thus it is the river-source that produces the medicine.\n\n“Vast and indistinct, its beginning unknown” describes the moment when body and mind return to their mandate, spirit enters the vastness, and one becomes one with the Great Void. After long stillness, when the heart’s flower blooms, the three palaces fill with *qi*—all feels hazy and indistinct, its cause unfathomable.\n\nFor within the hazy and indistinct, there is substance; within the deep and obscure, there is essence—this is the crux of cultivation. The *Book of Jade Fungus* states: “These four lines have been recited by countless millions through the ages, yet how many truly grasp their meaning? Without direct experience, none can know.”\n\nThus, to depict its depth is like gazing into an abyss; to speak of its indistinctness is like waking from a daydream—this is the true scene, not mere analogy. Scholars who have not undergone this experience fail to recognize that the deep and indistinct, the hazy and vague, are the true landscapes of their own bodies.

      "translated_text": "Within the profound obscurity, in but a fleeting moment, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; stillness reaches its limit and the mechanism stirs. Then the gate of the face bursts open, the void shatters, and a radiance of wind and light breaks through the desolation—transforming power returns to one’s grasp.\n\nMaster Wei’s chapter clearly expounds the source of elixir-production and exhaustively discusses the secrets of existence and non-existence, host and guest, before and after—so thorough that nothing more can be added. The *Returning Gold Treatise* states: “Vast and distant, one but scoops the moon from water; distinct and clear, one only gathers the flower in the mirror.” Truly, none but those deeply versed in the Dao can recognize this.\n\n“No level ground but slopes”—such is the natural transformation of the Way. Flourishing and decline, waxing and waning, all follow one another. From *kun* it ends, from *fu* it begins, like tracing an unbroken ring. Emperors and kings ride this current and endure for a thousand autumns.\n\n“No level ground but slopes, no going but return”—this is the natural course of the Dao. In elixir-methods, stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises; movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns. One movement, one stillness, each the root of the other—this too arises from nature. Like the sun and moon in their course, one cold, one hot: when summer departs, winter comes; when winter departs, summer comes—all is natural.\n\nThe golden elixir is the *Yi* within the body. When the *Yi* is exhausted, it transforms; when it transforms, it flows. Flourishing and decline succeed one another; waxing and waning follow in turn. There has never been exhaustion that did not transform, transformation that did not flow. Yang begins at *fu* and yin ends at *kun*; end and beginning join, head and tail link—thus it is said, “From *kun* it ends, from *fu* it begins, like tracing an unbroken ring.” Master Wei discusses the firing times through the twelve *pi* hexagrams and employs the names of pitch-pipes and celestial stems in his exposition—all are metaphors.\n\nFor instance, “spokes converging” corresponds to *Taicu*, “flanking ranks” to *Jiazhong*, “washing” to *Guxi*, “center” to *Zhonglü*, “perching” to *Linzhong*, “bearing” to *Nanlü*, “wounding” to *Yize*, “perishing” to *wangshe*, “responding” to *Yingzhong*, “shaking” to *chen*, “dusk” to *wei*, “stretching” to *shen*, “storing” to *you*, “extinguishing” to *xu*, and “blocking” to *hai*—all are borrowed terms. One must not cling to the words or force interpretations that spawn unnecessary complications.\n\n“Emperors and kings ride this current and endure for a thousand autumns” refers to the noble one who, throughout the day, remains *gan gan*, advancing with the times—truly, such a one can traverse a thousand autumns and endure.\n\nIf one wishes to nurture one’s nature and prolong one’s life, one must first carefully consider the end and then reflect on the beginning. One should ponder the original constitution of the body one received at birth—a single undifferentiated primordial essence, flowing and spreading, borne by qi from the outset.\n\nWhether foolish or wise, all share this same nature, this same life. The noble one, knowing that nature must not be harmed, preserves and nurtures it; knowing that life must not be cut short, safeguards and extends it. Even without relying on cultivation, none fail to live in peace and meet a timely end. How much more so when one obtains the method of cultivation, steals from heaven and earth, seizes the workings of creation, refines the hun and po into one, and unites nature and life in dual cultivation—how could one not attain longevity?\n\nTo seek longevity, one must seek the state before one’s birth—how this body came to be—only then can one discuss the way of nurturing nature and prolonging life. Thus it is said: “Carefully consider the end, then reflect on the beginning.” For when a person is born, it is through the union of the parents’ qi that form is completed. Form is the foundation that receives qi; qi is the root that gives rise to form. If qi does not obtain form, there is no basis for existence; if form does not obtain qi, there is no means for completion. Hence it is said: “The body one receives at birth is originally a single undifferentiated primordial essence, flowing and spreading, borne by qi from the outset.”\n\nNow, when immortals cultivate the elixir, they inwardly stimulate yin and yang, causing spirit and qi to unite, giving birth to being from non-being—this is fundamentally the same principle as the conception of a child in the womb. The ten months of gentle nurturing, the ceaseless true breathing day and night, are no different from the state before an infant is born. The *Song of the Great Dao’s Mystic Source* states:\n\n*Just observe the infant in the womb—*\n*How could it scheme with calculating mind?*\n*It refines qi to utmost softness, spirit lingers long;*\n*Incoming and outgoing, true breathing rests of itself.*\n\nFor when the infant is in the mother’s womb, when the mother exhales, it exhales; when the mother inhales, it inhales. Mouth and nose are closed, and all is conducted through the navel. Thus the navel is the root of life, the stem of qi.\n\nLü Chunyang’s *Song of the Mystic Female* says:\n\n*Exhaustively seek the moment of receiving qi at birth—*\n*No wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.*\n*If one can exhaustively seek the thought that gave rise to one’s birth,*\n*Return to the source, turn the light inward, and illuminate within,*\n*Gather the medicine in the southwest, at the root and stem of the kun abdomen,*\n*Then one resembles the moment of receiving qi at birth—*\n*What need is there for further seeking?*\n\nAlas, scholars often cling to words and rigidly adhere to images, each insisting their own view is correct. Those who favor lofty ideas mistake the golden elixir for Chan Buddhism, taking the cultivation of nature as the mystic female and the stirring of thoughts as the birth of the first yang. They dismiss the practice of prolonging life as the “light beneath the skull.” Those of baser inclinations mistake the golden elixir for the art of bedroom cultivation, taking women as the crucible, the birth gate as the place of origin, and the absorption of essences as the medicinal powder. They mock the nurturing of nature as “dry sitting on a meditation cushion.” One group sinks into emptiness and stillness; the other falls into depravity and perversion—both cling to their errors for a lifetime without awakening. How deeply lamentable!\n\nIt is like a chicken’s egg: yin and yang, black and white, support each other, spanning but an inch at the beginning. Over time, the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape. After ten months, it hatches from the womb—bones weak enough to bend, flesh smooth as malt sugar. The black and white are the two qi of yin and yang.\n\nWhen a person is conceived, it begins with the father’s essence and mother’s blood—the two qi of yin and yang temporarily unite to form a state of primordial chaos, like a chicken’s egg. After a hundred days, the male and female forms differentiate, and the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape. When the time comes, the child is born, emerging from the womb—bones weak, sinews soft, flesh tender and smooth—called an infant.\n\nThose who refine the golden elixir cultivate the infant within their own body, and it too must undergo ten months of nurturing. The *Cui Xu Treatise* states:\n\n*In the past, when I practiced for a year,*\n*The six pulses stilled, qi returned to the root,*\n*And an infant dwelled in the cinnabar field—*\n*Its form and appearance were just like mine.*\n\nTruly, in the cultivation of the sacred embryo, there has never been one who achieved swift success without ten months of effort.\n\nYin and yang serve as the measure where the hun and po reside. Heaven has the ecliptic as its measure—three hundred and sixty-five degrees. In its revolution, it completes one cycle each day. The sun and moon travel within it, moving up and down, alternating in their exits and entrances—this is how day and night are divided and cold and heat determined. Yet the celestial path’s subtle rotation has no fixed measure; it is through the sun and moon’s passage through the celestial stems that their course is measured. The sun and moon’s movements have no fixed abode; it is through their places of morning and evening exits and entrances that their residence is determined.\n\nUnderstanding this, one then grasps what Master Wei meant by “yin and yang serve as the measure where the hun and po reside.” The ecliptic within the human body is the path where the yin tally and yang fire proceed—it is the direction where the sun’s hun and moon’s po reside. One who can observe heaven’s way, grasp heaven’s movement, recognize the course of yin and yang, and know the dwelling of the hun and po—such a one circulates the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial cycle within the span of a single breath, and the sun and moon exit and enter within the subtlety of inhalation and exhalation. Exhalation is yang, inhalation is yin—this shares the same wondrous function as the celestial path. There is no need to seek it elsewhere.",

      "translated_text": "The yang spirit is the sun’s hun, the yin spirit is the moon’s po—hun and po serve as each other’s dwelling. An ancient song says: *\"If one recognizes the sun’s hun and moon’s po, that one is a true immortal.\"* What is called the sun’s hun and moon’s po here is not the manifest, visible sun’s hun and moon’s po of heaven and earth, but rather the concealed, formless sun’s hun and moon’s po within our own bodies. Without the instruction of a true master, how could one recognize them?\n\nNow, the sun is the Great Yang, its light unfolding by day, hence called *hun*; the moon is the Great Yin, its radiance contained by night, hence called *po*. The sun’s hun belongs to yang and is rightly termed the *yang spirit*, while the moon’s po belongs to yin and may properly be called *yin essence*—how could it be spoken of as *spirit*? Yet both are now called *spirit* because they are ceaselessly transforming, never abiding, circulating through the six directions, coming and going without fixed place or constant position.\n\nThe hun is the wood of the eastern direction; the po is the metal of the western direction. Metal and wood are originally of one body—when the eastern neighbor moves, it is immediately the western household. They alternate between east and west, each serving as the other’s dwelling, hence it is said they *mutually serve as chambers*.\n\nNature presides within, establishing the inner citadel; emotion governs without, ever fortifying the outer walls. When the walls are complete, all beings find peace. At this time, emotion harmonizes with heaven and earth.\n\n*Nature* (性) means stillness; *presiding within* refers to sitting upright, emptying the heart, and turning the gaze inward. *Establishing the inner citadel* means seizing the golden essence to lay the foundation of life. *Emotion* (情) means movement; *governing without* refers first to the pivot of the mechanism, which moves day and night. *Ever fortifying the outer walls* means the dragon’s fire encircling all eight directions. When the walls are complete and all beings find peace, the qi surges through the joints, penetrating naturally, essence fills the valley, and the spirit of the valley abides. At this time, *emotion harmonizes with heaven and earth* means the river chariot never pauses, day or night, silently aligning with the great creation in its movement.\n\nQian is active and straight, its qi spreading, essence flowing; Kun is still and receptive, converging to form the Dao’s sanctuary. Qian is heaven, governing movement, unfolding all things to reach throughout the universe—hence it is said to be *straight*. Because it is active and straight, its essence and qi flow and spread, filling the three palaces without exception. Kun is earth, governing stillness, gathering all things to be stored within the soil—hence it is said to be *receptive*. Because it is still and receptive, its essence and qi return to the original sea, forming the Dao’s sanctuary. Generally, abiding in Qian means activity, and activity means qi spreads and essence flows; abiding in Kun means stillness, and stillness means qi gathers and essence congeals.\n\nThe firm descends and retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. When Qian’s yang descends to aid Kun, Kun’s yielding receptivity embraces it, giving birth to the medicine. Once the fire of refinement is applied, the firm descends and retreats, while the yielding yin ascends, transforming into sweet springs that moisten the nine realms.\n\nNine returns, seven reverses, eight reverts, six abides. The six, seven, eight, and nine correspond to water, fire, wood, and metal. In terms of trigrams, they are Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui; in terms of directions, east, west, south, and north; in terms of lunar lodges, Xu, Fang, Xing, and Mao; in terms of symbols, the tortoise-snake, dragon, and tiger; in terms of seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in terms of earthly branches, zi, wu, mao, and you—all are the same entities.\n\nNow, nine is called *return*, seven *reverse*, eight *revert*, yet six alone is called *abide*—this is because the north, the position of Kan, is the native home of true lead. When true lead abides here, the upright qi of the nine metals, eight woods, and seven fires, like spokes converging at the hub, like rivers flowing to the sea, all gather here.\n\nWang Baoyi’s commentary on the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* states: *\"The sun has three illuminations, the moon three shifts. When the sun and moon emerge in the east and shine upon the west, the upright qi of the west’s White Tiger, the metal virtue, enters the mysterious barrier and transforms into the six wu. When the sun and moon set in the west and shine upon the east, the upright qi of the east’s Green Dragon, the wood virtue, enters the mysterious barrier and transforms into the six si. When the sun and moon reside in the south and shine upon the north, the upright qi of the south’s Vermilion Bird, the fire virtue, enters the mysterious barrier, takes earthly form, and transforms into black lead, ever abiding in the profound barrier as the root of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things.\"* Wang’s explanation and Master Wei’s words may be said to be of different eras yet in perfect accord.\n\nMale white, female red—metal and fire restrain each other, and thus water is stabilized. Water is the first of the five phases.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* says: *\"A strange matter that makes people laugh many times—now even men...\"*",

Heaven engenders water first; its position is in the north, its hexagram is Kan, and it stands at the head of the five phases. It is the homeland where the medicinal substances of our body are produced. If one can inwardly turn the light to reflect here—exhaling ever so slightly, inhaling ever so softly, without interruption—then spirit and qi return to the root, gradually entering, gradually softening, gradually harmonizing, and gradually stabilizing. When this stabilization endures, breath ceases, and the medicinal substances will naturally coalesce.\n\nThe highest good is like water, clear and flawless. The highest good is like water, flowing where it will without contention. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is non-action, likewise flowing where it will without contention. The *Yǔlù* of Master Ma Danyang says: *\"The cultivator of the Dao, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, must not for a moment let the heart stray from the Dao. When walking, place the feet on level ground; when standing, concentrate the spirit in the Great Void; when sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of the nose; when lying down, embrace the pearl below the navel. With long and unbroken practice, one becomes as if dull-witted—this alone is the true work, not the contrived effort of forced discipline.\"* Is this not \"flowing where it will without contention\"?\n\nThe *Wù Zhēn Piān* says: *\"Do not merely guard the furnace and watch the fire; simply settle the spirit and rest in naturalness.\"* The *Shàng Qīng Jí* says: *\"The immortal’s art is not complex—it is merely a single taste of dullness in the human realm.\"* This, too, is \"flowing where it will without contention.\"\n\nWater’s nature is stillness and stability; when settled, it clarifies, but when disturbed, it muddies. The marvel of the Golden Elixir arises entirely from stillness and stability. The *Huán Yuán Piān* says: *\"Know the medicine and the fire, and in stability, witness the Elixir’s formation.\"* For there has never been one who attained it without stability.\n\nThe Dao has no form or image; the True One is difficult to depict. It transforms and scatters, each part dwelling alone. *\"There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name, so I style it the Dao.\"* It has no form to seek, no image to behold—how could it be captured in a diagram?\n\nLong ago, Guangchengzi told the Yellow Emperor: *\"The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dark and silent.\"* In that profound obscurity and dark silence, not a single thought arises, and the ten thousand concerns vanish. All is merged and boundless, like the undivided Great Ultimate; vast and formless, like the unmanifested Two Modes. Only this one thing remains, serene and solitary, like the moon reflected in a clear abyss, motionless as still water without ripples. One knows not what is lead or what is mercury—this is called the True One. When the time arrives and qi transforms and scatters, the light and pure ascend, while the heavy and turbid settle below. Thus, in the Kan Palace there is lead, and in the Li Palace there is mercury. What was once merged and boundless, vast and formless, now divides into two, each dwelling alone.\n\nThe *Fù Mìng Piān* says: *\"One thing divides into two—knowing these two is to name the furnace and cauldron. The dripping of the water clock has reached the third watch.\"* This is what it refers to.\n\nThe great medicine of the Golden Elixir is conceived in the prior heaven and born in the posterior heaven. Its marvel lies in the moment when the Great Ultimate is about to divide yet remains undivided—when stillness has reached its extreme but has not yet given way to movement, when yang is about to return but has not yet departed from yin. Here, the mechanism of heaven and earth converges, and the place where the Elixir coalesces is known. Recognizing the secret of where to begin, one finds something within the indistinct, draws true essence from the profound, and realizes that the Great Dao arises from non-being into being. Truly, the marvel of the True One cannot be captured in a diagram.\n\nYet, in the end, is there no way to reveal the marvel of the True One? The yang-sui mirror does not produce fire without the sun; the fang-zhu vessel cannot yield water without the moon and stars. Though the two qi are suspended far apart, their resonance and transformation still communicate—how much more so when they are intimately present within the heart and breast, where yin and yang pair like the sun and moon, and water and fire respond as evidence?\n\nThe *Zhou Li*, in the *Autumn Offices*, states that the *Si Xuan Shi* is charged with using the fu-sui to draw bright fire from the sun and the mirror to draw bright water from the moon. The *Huainanzi* says: *\"When the fang-zhu faces the moon, it exudes water.\"* Gao You’s commentary notes: *\"The fang-zhu is the yin-sui, a large clam.\"* Though the earth is separated from heaven by countless thousands of miles, and the sun and moon hang in the void at an equal distance from the earth, the yang-sui, when facing the sun, obtains fire, and the fang-zhu, when facing the moon, obtains water. How swiftly their resonance and transformation communicate!\n\nHow much more so when they are intimately present within the heart and breast? Within the body, there is water and fire; within the heart, there are medicinal materials. Should one not inwardly turn the light to reflect and seek the marvel of this resonance? Moreover, on the bright night of the fifteenth of the eighth month, the *xiao* in the deep mountains forms its embryo, and the oyster in the blue sea forms its pearl. What causes their resonance and transformation to be so marvelously swift?\n\nBorn between heaven and earth as the most intelligent of the ten thousand things, humans cannot steal from heaven and earth or seize the workings of creation—they are not even the equal of the hare or the oyster. Have those who study immortality ever paid heed to this?\n\nGenerally, when yin and yang attain harmony, their resonance is natural. Master Wei used the yang-sui to draw fire and the fang-zhu to draw water as proof, urging cultivators to inwardly observe and realize being within non-being. Their resonance and transformation are just like this.\n\nThe *Huán Dān Piān* says: *\"When the two qi meet, sweet rain descends; when the two spirits unite, jade nectar flows.\"* This is indeed so.\n\nThe mirror and the pearl are both luminous and pure, transparent inside and out, without the slightest blemish. Thus, they can gather the light of the sun and moon into a single grain of brightness. Though vast and distant, they respond immediately. Yet when settled, they gather, and gathering, they exist; when moved, they scatter, and scattering, they vanish. If one can empty the heart, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly stabilize without the slightest stray thought, then the light of one’s own sun and moon will gather without scattering. When qi stabilizes over time, wondrous effects will naturally arise.\n\nThe supreme Dao is not far off—it is ever before one’s eyes. It is like the magnet that draws iron, though obstructed, its resonance is intimate and near. Yet the world’s people are deluded and turn away, unable to seek it within.\n\nNing Xuanzi’s poem says:\n*\"Diligently, I discuss with master and disciple—\nNot elsewhere, but right before one’s eyes.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"That one phrase received from the master’s side,\nSecretly bestowed, carefully observed—\nHow very near it is!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "the mysterious barrier, takes earthly form, and transforms into black lead, ever abiding in the profound barrier as the root of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things.\"* Wang’s explanation and Master Wei’s words may be said to be of different eras yet in perfect accord.\n\nMale white, female red—metal and fire restrain each other, and thus water is stabilized. Water is the first of the five phases.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* says: *\"A strange matter that makes people laugh many times—now even men...\"*",

Naturally, ascent and descent occur, and the hundred bones and myriad orifices become unobstructed—like a ten-thousand-hulled boat set in motion by a single span of wood, or a thousand-jun crossbow triggered by a single inch of mechanism. Yet it expends not the slightest effort; only the deluded fail to believe it.

      "translated_text": "The human spirit emerges from the eyes—when the body is born, this essence precedes heaven and earth; when the body perishes, this essence outlasts heaven and earth. The Five Phases of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth converge here; the five viscera of liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys gather their numinous power here; the seven substances of saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and marrow crystallize their brilliance here. In its vastness, it can contain heaven and earth; in its subtlety, not even a mote of dust can enter. Is this not the great treasure within this single body?\n\nThe *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* states: \"Containing the light is the elixir of long life.\" The *Shangpin Xian* says: \"Gather the twin pupils before the eyes and refine them—this alone can guard against the golden immortals.\" Such direct instructions are given, yet scholars may still fail to awaken. How deeply benighted they are!\n\nFor the Three Palaces rise and descend, ascending and descending without end—like a wheel in ceaseless motion. Their operation lies in the heart, as the wheel’s hub; their pivot rests in the eyes, as the axle’s linchpin. The *Jinhua Shi* says: \"The immortal lad guards only the cavern’s gate, while the true person of the Three Isles eternally comes and goes.\" This is indeed the case.\n\nWhen *li* qi flourishes within, defense is perfected; when *kan* ceases to rely on hearing, *dui* unites without speech, and words grow rare to follow the primordial chaos. These three, once secured, the body relaxes in an empty chamber.\n\n*Li* qi flourishes within defense when the eyes are drawn inward and the light is not revealed. *Kan* ceases to rely on hearing when the ears are turned inward to listen, and hearing is not leaked. *Dui* unites without speech, words grow rare, and primordial chaos is followed when the heart’s chamber is as cold as ash, utterly silent—guarding the sacred embryo. Once these three are thus secured, the body should relax in an empty chamber.\n\nTo relax the body is to move slowly, with ease and without straining the form. To dwell in an empty chamber is to enter a quiet room—within it, nothing else should be placed, save a single incense burner, a lamp, a small table, and a couch. The seating should be neither too bright (lest it harm the *hun*) nor too dark (lest it harm the *po*). For the *hun* favors brightness, the *po* favors darkness; brightness belongs to yang, darkness to yin. Thus the *Cuixu Pian* advises: \"The chamber should face wood, toward the morning sun, with *dui*’s brightness facing the evening light,\" and also: \"Do not rest with a bright lamp or a hundred harmonies.\"\n\nEntering a quiet chamber to cultivate is a matter of the greatest karmic affinity—how could it be a trivial undertaking? Have you not seen the *Wu Zhen Pian*? It says: \"This Way is most divine and sacred; I fear your allotment is too meager to bear it.\" How could one without virtue and conduct dare covet it?\n\nYet the quiet chamber need not be confined to mountain forests—it may be within a city wall or a village of the Dao. Wherever one finds refuge, there is no place it cannot be. Some doubt the *Wu Zhen Pian*’s mention of relying on the powerful in bustling cities, but this refers to the time before the great elixir is formed, when one cannot endure the cold and heat of the four seasons in a single year, or the hunger and thirst of the three daily meals before true qi is complete. Thus Wu Daling found Zhang and Cheng as friends; Zhang Ziyang found Ma and Lu as patrons; Wang Chongxi relied on the wealthy Han; Li Changyuan depended on his kinsmen of Junyang. All achieved success through the fire-times of the celestial revolution, requiring unbroken effort. One must have like-minded, capable companions to provide protection, supplies, and service, shielding one from the theft of qi by hunger, cold, and hardship—only then can one focus wholeheartedly on cultivation.\n\nThe *Yin Zhenjun Jinye Huandan Ge* says: \"Without the proper place, do not act recklessly.\" The *Wu Zhen Pian* says: \"The treasure of life should not be lightly toyed with.\" Those who attain the true transmission of this Way will know this for themselves.\n\nEntrust your will to emptiness and nothingness, making this your constant practice. To entrust your will to emptiness and nothingness is to keep the heart free of杂念 and the mind from wandering outward, dwelling all day in true emptiness. To make this your constant practice is to let thoughts follow one another without interruption, aligning the breath with the celestial Dao.\n\nSome suspect this method resembles Chan practice, but they do not realize that the golden elixir arises from nothing to become something, nurturing the infant immortal—this is not the same as sitting like a block of wood or dead ash. The *Bai Ziqing Yulu* says: \"The first oral instruction for refining the elixir is to gather qi and congeal spirit. Constantly maintain firmness—this is gathering qi. Thought after thought, guard silence—this is congealing spirit.\" If scholars only know emptiness of heart and thought but do not gather qi and congeal spirit, they fall into dead emptiness—how then can the immortal embryo be formed?\n\nProof shifts with the progress of the heart’s focus. With three parts effort, there is three parts proof; with ten parts effort, ten parts proof. If one practices diligently, day and night without rest, after a hundred days of effort, the numinous power manifests: the two kidneys become as if scalded, the bladder as if afire, the eyes radiate spirit-light, and the ears...",

      "translated_text": "The ears hear subtle sounds, the nose detects rare fragrances, and the mouth fills with sweet fluids—this body becomes supple and flowing, its proofs shifting day by day. What is prized in maintaining a focused heart without distraction is the very fear that, should one’s grasp of principle remain incomplete, one might be ensnared by demonic realms during the liminal state between stillness and dream. The *Thirty-Ninth Chapter of the Pointer to the Mystery* states: \"Do not cling to external phenomena; single-mindedly guard the coiled tiger and dragon.\" This is indeed the teaching. Ding Lingyang’s *Heart and Nature Secrets* says: \"If, in deep stillness, one suddenly sees immortals, Buddhas, demons, spirits, towers, or radiant lights—any phenomena appearing before the eyes—one must not generate attachment or aversion.\" The master says: \"Within the vast emptiness of one’s own nature, let the myriad transformations unfold. If the heart remains unmoved, all delusions will naturally retreat. When the heart-fire does not arise, spirit and qi converge, mother and child unite, and naturally water and fire achieve harmony. As water encounters fire, it transforms into qi, rising to permeate every orifice, naturally regulating the hundred vessels and harmonizing the four great elements. Guard this diligently, and the Dao will spontaneously align.\"\n\nWang Xi’s *Panshan Record* states: \"In stillness, the practitioner may encounter manifold illusions, all conjured by the discriminating mind, arising in quietude to lure the sovereign heart. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *All phenomena are illusory*? If the mind seeks to dispel the discriminating consciousness while it yet lingers, it will manifest forms—demonic faces and spirit-heads—to disturb the sovereign heart. If the sovereign remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, the body merges with emptiness, leaving no trace to grasp, and the illusions will naturally dissolve.\" Guan Yinzi says: \"When a person’s eyes suddenly perceive extraordinary things in ordinary times, it is because essence has congealed to produce them. When a sick person’s eyes suddenly perceive extraordinary things, it is because the heart harbors deficiency. If one knows that the heart can manifest being from non-being, one also knows it can manifest non-being from being. Simply do not believe in them, and they will naturally lose their numinosity.\" Someone asked: \"When consciousness is dimmed, who can avoid belief?\" I replied: \"Like the snake-catcher whose heart fears not the serpent, though he dreams of snakes, he feels no terror.\" The Yellow Emperor said: \"The Dao has no demons or spirits; it moves alone, comes alone.\" Observing these teachings, we understand why Master Wei’s admonition—\"focus the heart without distraction\"—is indeed the essential principle for cultivation.\n\nIn sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, one attends to the moments of presence and absence. Essence arises at its appointed time, and spirit knows the hundred divisions of the day. Beware of dullness and confusion; one must maintain unbroken awareness in movement and stillness, as if brooding over an egg, keeping the warmth unceasing—only then can it be called cultivation. With sincere accumulation and prolonged effort, skill becomes pure, and day and night merge into one, with no distinction between dream and waking. Even in sleep, spirit remains lucid, and when essence arises, spirit communes with heaven. Though uncalled, it awakens of itself. Xia Yunfeng said: \"The natural timing is even in dreams.\" This is the teaching.\n\nNow Master Wei speaks of \"in sleep, spirit embracing spirit; upon waking, attending to presence and absence,\" urging cultivators to remain ever vigilant. The great elixir of golden cinnabar is formed through the union of spirit and qi, transforming the insubstantial into substance to gestate the sacred embryo. One must guard it with diligence for ten months, like a young woman’s first pregnancy or a small dragon newly nurturing its pearl. As spirit and qi first congeal, they are easily scattered. In sleep, one must embrace spirit closely, never sinking into dreamy confusion. Upon waking, one must fear the cooling of the fire and the weakening of the elixir’s power, thus attending to its presence and absence. Throughout the twelve hours of the day, without distinction between day and night, one must remain ever mindful. Only then will the effort become pure, the medicinal materials not dissipate, and the firing times not falter. How can one ever depart from this for even a moment?\n\nThe complexion gradually moistens, the bones and joints grow stronger.",
      "overlap_context": "d thought but do not gather qi and congeal spirit, they fall into dead emptiness—how then can the immortal embryo be formed?\n\nProof shifts with the progress of the heart’s focus. With three parts effort, there is three parts proof; with ten parts effort, ten parts proof. If one practices diligently, day and night without rest, after a hundred days of effort, the numinous power manifests: the two kidneys become as if scalded, the bladder as if afire, the eyes radiate spirit-light, and the ears...",

      "translated_text": "The complexion gradually moistens and the bones and joints grow ever stronger—this is because the supreme treasure is stored within, and naturally its essence radiates outward. It is like jade in the mountains that moistens the trees, or a pearl in the deep that keeps the cliffs from withering. Only after dispelling all yin and evil can true yang be established. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: “When the host of yin is stripped away and the elixir ripens, one leaps free from the cage to live ten thousand years.”\n\nThe human body, from top to bottom, is nothing but yin’s dross and turbid impurities. The method of immortal cultivation is to generate being from non-being, seizing the one measure of true yang from Heaven and Earth to congeal the elixir’s beginning. Then, day and night, one circulates the fire to refine away yin qi. After ten months of refinement, the embryo is complete; after three years, the work is done. Only then does the body transform into pure yang, the form alchemically transmuted into an immortal.\n\nIf one refines without ceasing, the qi will become like clouds and rain, flowing abundantly as spring moisture, trickling like melting ice from head to foot, then rising again in endless circulation. As the *Neizhi Tongxuan Mijue* says: “Work the great elixir day and night without rest, and the essence will pierce the crown as the hundred spirits gather above.” After a year of seclusion, practicing night and day without pause, the effects will naturally manifest. Harmonious qi will suffuse the entire body, billowing like mountain clouds ascending into the great void, suffusing like fine rain across the plains, brimming like spring waters filling the four marshes, flowing like river ice on the verge of melting. It circulates up and down, surging through the hundred vessels, filling the valleys within, coursing through the four limbs. The heart is full, brimming with spring’s warmth, and one’s state resembles mild intoxication.\n\nThe *Ruyao Jing* says: “Whether it be precelestial or postcelestial qi, those who attain it are ever as if drunk.” The *Lingguang Ji* says: “Inverted circulation feels like drunkenness, neither sorrowful nor joyful, inwardly preserving true reality—all are the wondrous effects of elixir work.” Ding Lingyang’s *Huiguang Ji* says: “If a single thought is unborn, then naturally within the dantian and sea of qi, the essence of great yin crosses the Weilu acupoint, passes the Jiaji double gates, ascends through Fengfu to Niwan, then descends through the Hall of Light and the bridge of the nose into the Flower Pool, where it transforms into sweet nectar. Swallowed, it irrigates the five viscera and six bowels, reaching the dantian. It flows up and down, filling the four great [elements], circulating endlessly without fail.”\n\nIf one practices only in the morning and abandons it by evening, or if one’s will is not single-minded, how can one progress in this? Reversion is the proof of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue. Reversion means returning repeatedly. The *Daode Jing* says: “Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly. The ten thousand things arise together, and I thereby observe their return.” The effects of elixir refinement emerge from the utmost emptiness and firm stillness, merging with Heaven and Earth. Only then does primordial qi return with the coming of the one yang. If emptiness is not utmost and stillness not firm, it will be like the mountain with nine measures of earth—one basket short of completion. How can one expect any effect?\n\nWeakness means softness. The *Daode Jing* says: “Concentrate qi to attain softness—can you be like a newborn babe?” The root and handle of elixir refinement lie in holding fast to one’s will without violently expending one’s qi. Only by being as soft and weak as an infant can one succeed. If one’s will is not guarded and qi not nurtured, what little is gained will be lost in an avalanche—what then can serve as the root and handle?\n\nWeed out long-accumulated impurities, and even the finest details will become harmonious and smooth. When all concerns are stilled, the hundred bones are all ordered; when defensive qi dissipates, the Dao’s qi remains. It is like a farmer who must remove weeds: cutting and clearing them to the roots, preventing regrowth, so that the good may flourish. Now, in the immortal’s refinement of the elixir, one weeds out long-accumulated impurities, drives away the demonic corpse, quiets the six senses, and empties the five aggregates within right mindfulness—clear, luminous, empty, and radiant. Only then are the five viscera cool and serene, the six bowels harmonious and at peace, the three hundred sixty joints free of obstruction, and the eighty-four thousand pores all unblocked.\n\nThe path from turbidity to clarity: when dullness lingers, brightness will come. The *Cuixu Pian* says: “When spirit and qi merge in darkness, qi returns—bones and flesh fuse, all unawares.” At this time, the three fields are full of qi, and one feels as if in a drunken dream. Can this not be called dull and turbid? Yet when scholars reach this state, they must not collapse. Know that prolonged dullness will surely give way to clarity, and prolonged turbidity to purity. When the time comes and qi transforms, the nine heavens’ message will scatter the embryo’s membrane. Then the divine water will be deep and clear, the Flower Pool still, white snow will swirl and fly across the four mountains, and the twelve-storied tower of the seven-jeweled pavilion will be visible. All will be bright and distinct, seen within the realm of the indistinct—how could it remain merely dull and turbid?\n\nYet worldly people favor minor arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao. They abandon the correct path for deviant shortcuts, seeking speed but finding no passage—like the blind refusing a staff, or the deaf trying to hear music. They fish for pheasants and hares in water, or seek fish and dragons on mountaintops. They plant wheat hoping for millet, or use a compass to draw a square, exhausting their spirit and strength year after year without result.\n\nThe great Dao of the golden elixir is accomplished through accumulating essence and amassing qi—it cannot be attained in a single leap. A moment forms the embryo, a hundred days establishes the foundation, a year enters seclusion, and three years of refinement and nurturing follow a natural sequence. There is no principle by which one meets a master today and ascends as an immortal tomorrow. Yet how often do worldly scholars, deluded by hearsay, fail to discern the depth of the Dao or distinguish between true and false teachers? They seek quick results, favoring minor arts, knowing one thing but not another, grasping the form but not the function. Confined by partial views, they consider themselves sufficient, even promoting deviant teachings while slandering the true Dao. They distort authentic scriptures to gain the trust of the ignorant, recklessly teaching the deluded and misleading the misguided—such cases are many.\n\nSome clever individuals refuse to humble themselves to seek instruction, instead poring over old texts in hopes of enlightenment—how is this different from the blind refusing a staff? The foolish and ignorant, not understanding the highest principles, force their conjectures to fit the alchemical texts—how is this different from the deaf trying to hear music? Some take the navel as the mysterious pass—this is like fishing for pheasants and hares in water. Others take the two eyes as the Flower Pool—this is like seeking fish and dragons on mountaintops. Still others practice sexual arts hoping for immortality, or sit in stubborn emptiness aspiring to longevity—are these not like planting wheat to harvest millet? Or using a compass to draw a square? All are deluded and unenlightened, wasting their efforts in vain, until their hair turns white in confusion, achieving nothing. What a pity!",

      "translated_text": "To know the method of ingesting the elixir: it is most concise and unburdensome. The *Thirty-Nine Pointers to the Mysterious* states, \"That which is inwardly luminous comes as the utmost truth; what enters from without is not intimate.\" This means the elixir resides within the body—there is no need to seek it externally. Yet Master Wei speaks of \"ingesting the elixir\"—does this not imply the elixir comes from without and is swallowed through the mouth? The answer is no. The elixir is born within the Kan trigram, forced out by fire, traverses the Three Palaces, descends, and enters the mouth—hence it is called \"ingestion.\" \"Most concise and unburdensome\" refers to the oral instructions, which are supremely simple and easy.\n\nIf it is indeed so simple and easy, then the *Cantong Qi* need not have been written. Why then does it stretch on endlessly, filling scroll after scroll? I have also seen the *Wuzhen Pian*, which says, \"The Great Elixir’s method is supremely simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant may practice it and instantly transcend to the realm of sages.\" Yet it also states, \"Those who refine the golden elixir must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation.\" Why this contradiction? Ah, there is an explanation.\n\nThe dull and ignorant, free from overthinking, readily believe. Once they encounter the method, they follow it directly without hesitation. Though they lack deep understanding, they may still succeed. The wise and learned, however, are broad in knowledge and often beset by doubts. If one point remains unclear, they will seek to exhaust its depths before proceeding. Should they fail to fully grasp the origins of yin, yang, and creation, they may grow skeptical midway. If swayed by heterodox teachings that seem plausible, they may abandon the path, casting aside the shuttle and loom, and declare the true Way false. Thus, the method cannot but be explained in full.\n\nTherefore, though Master Wei may have wished to keep his words unadorned, how could he have done so? The flowing pearl of the Great Yang ever seeks to depart from man, but once it obtains the Golden Flower, it turns and clings, transforming into a white liquid that congeals into utmost hardness. The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is the numinous mercury. The *Song of the Numinous Source of the Great Dao* says, \"This substance has no fixed position; it changes with the times, following the heart’s intent. In the body, when stirred by sensation, it becomes sweat; when the nose meets wind, it becomes mucus; when the kidneys unite, it becomes essence; when the eyes grieve, it becomes tears.\" Thus, it ever seeks to depart from man. The Golden Flower is true lead. When mercury obtains true lead, it turns and clings, naturally neither flying nor fleeing, lingering within and transforming into golden liquid, congealing into utmost hardness.\n\nThe Golden Flower first arises, and in a moment, dissolves into water. The horse’s teeth stand in rows; yang then goes forth to harmonize with nature and temperament. True lead is born in the Kan position, first liquid, then congealing into the Yellow Sprout—hence the metaphor of the horse’s teeth standing in rows. The *Cui Xu Pian* says, \"The elixir’s head is nothing but the primordial qi refined into the Yellow Sprout, giving rise to the Jade Flower.\" Lead is the sovereign; mercury, the minister. Lead moves first, and mercury responds—like a ruler initiating and a minister harmonizing. Lead belongs to metal; mercury, to wood. Wood’s nature loves metal; metal’s essence clings to wood. Yin and yang unite naturally.\n\nWhen the time is pressing, yin is constrained and the gate is sealed. \"When the time is pressing, yin\" refers to the proper moment, when one must swiftly gather the medicine. \"Constraining and sealing the gate\" means returning with the gathered medicine to the furnace for refinement. The *Huanyuan Pian* says, \"One need only align with the celestial mechanism—who knows where the elixir is formed?\" What is aligning with the celestial mechanism? It is pressing the time of yin. What is the place where the elixir is formed? It is constraining and sealing the gate. One must draw near the moment when yin reaches its extreme, welcoming the first stirrings of yang to advance the fire. It must not be overdone, nor should it be insufficient—this is what is meant by \"pressing the time of yin.\" When advancing the fire, urge the hundred vessels to return to the source, penetrate the nine passes to the very end. The sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire are all gathered in the Yellow Palace and refined into the supreme treasure—this is what is meant by \"constraining, storing, and sealing the gate.\" The *Ruyao Jing* says, \"Heaven and earth are stingy with their numinous transformations. Without pressing the time of yin and constraining and sealing the gate, how could one steal their mechanism?\"\n\nThe compassionate mother nurtures; the filial son repays her kindness. They interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another. The stern father issues commands, instructing his descendants. When true lead is born, it is conceived in the womb of the Kun mother—like a compassionate mother’s nurturing. When it flies up to the Qian Palace, captures and restrains true mercury, and unites with it to form the elixir, it then returns to the Kun mother’s womb—this is like the filial son repaying his mother’s kindness, the kind crow returning to feed its parent. Yet without the fierce fire of scorching refinement, true lead cannot take flight—this is why the stern father issues commands to spur it on. The *Yuzhi Shu* says, \"Lead does not fly without fire; mercury does not congeal without lead.\" There are subtle precautions here—how could this be spoken of lightly?\n\nThe five phases intermingle, each in its sovereign position, relying on one another to generate. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal subdues wood, which flourishes. Metal generates water, and wood generates fire—this is the ordinary sequence of the five phases. But in the elixir’s method, wood and fire are companions, and fire in turn generates wood. Metal and water unite, and water in turn generates metal—hence it is said, \"The five phases intermingle, each in its sovereign position, relying on one another to generate.\" \"Fire’s nature melts metal\" means employing the fire of the Li Palace in the south to refine the metal within the water of the Kan Palace in the north. \"Metal subdues wood, which flourishes\" means employing the metal within the water of the Kan Palace in the north to restrain the wood within the fire of the Li Palace in the south.\n\nThe Three and the Five unite as one—the utmost essence of heaven and earth. This can be transmitted orally but is difficult to convey in writing. The Three refers to water (one) and fire (two), combining to form three. The Five is earth. \"The Three and the Five unite as one\" means water, fire, and earth intermingle and fuse into a single qi. At this time, the mysterious yellow is intermingled, and the clear and turbid are not yet separated—like the primordial chaos of heaven and earth. Soon, the time arrives, and qi transforms from nothing into something. In the profound darkness, something indistinct arises; in the indistinctness, something hazy forms. It coalesces into a mass, and within it, the utmost essence of heaven and earth is conceived. Qutu Shenhe said, \"If you understand the Three and the Five as one, you may become an earth-treading immortal.\" Its wonders must be transmitted orally, heart to heart—difficult to fully express in writing.\n\nThe child turns to the right; noon then revolves to the east. Mao and You divide the boundaries, giving rise to the names of host and guest. \"The child turns to the right\" means moving from the west to the Zi position, where the tiger is born within water.",

      "translated_text": "The marvel of the Five Phases lies nowhere more profoundly than in Kan and Li. Kan is Water, where Metal and Water unite, and within Water resides Metal. Li is Fire, where Water and Fire become companions, and within Fire resides Wood. These form the Four Symbols. When Kan receives Wu Earth and Li receives Ji Earth, they complete the Five Phases. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"The Zhen Dragon’s mercury emerges from the Li region; the Dui Tiger’s lead is born in the Kan direction. These two substances are both produced by the child giving birth to the mother.\"* It further says: *\"If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the Four Symbols, they cannot form the Elixir. Only because each holds true Earth within does the Golden Elixir achieve its return and restoration.\"* This makes the principle clear.\n\nIn the Elixir’s method, Fire refines Metal, and Metal subdues Wood. When Fire flourishes, Water tempers it; when Water surges, Earth restrains it—this is the mutual overcoming of the Five Phases. Metal generates Water, and Water is Metal’s child, yet within Water, Metal is born. Wood generates Fire, and Fire is Wood’s child, yet within Water, Wood is born—this is their alternating roles as father and mother. The father is like Heaven; the mother is like Earth. Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth receives it, accomplishing the work of generation and nurturance. Thus it is said: *\"The mother contains the nourishing fluids; the father governs the bestowal of essence.\"* The *Chilong Dadan Jue* states: *\"The marvel lies in Heaven’s intercourse with Earth, enabling return and restoration.\"* The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"Father’s essence and mother’s blood coalesce to form the embryo, resembling another’s form yet akin to my own. Only by recognizing the true father and mother within can one grasp the essence of the Five Phases.\"*\n\nCultivators who refine the Elixir must unite their own Heaven with their own Earth, gathering their own Five Phases within. There, they mutually consume, defend, and yet remain intimate, suddenly realizing that within the void, conception occurs, and the Sacred Embryo is formed. When essence congeals and form flows, even metal and stone do not decay. The essence of the Five Phases solidifies between Heaven and Earth, becoming metal or stone, enduring for millennia without corruption. If one turns inward to seek it, condensing the essence of one’s own Five Phases into a treasure, it will endure as long as Heaven and Earth—how could mere metal or stone compare?\n\n**Scrutinize focus, avoid leakage, and attain the true Dao.**\n\"Focus\" means severing worldly affairs and dedicating oneself wholly to refinement, with single-minded devotion. \"Avoid leakage\" means maintaining silence like a hen brooding her eggs, keeping the spirit within the body’s cavity at all times. By doing so, the work remains pure, the medicine does not dissipate, the fire’s power is uninterrupted, and the Dao is achieved. Those deluded by inferior arts believe that pressing the perineum to restrain lustful impulses and engaging in sensory union constitutes \"avoiding leakage.\" They do not realize that though the essence may not leak, the spirit and qi have already departed, leaving only stagnant, turbid residue to accumulate in the waist, breeding strange ailments. How utterly benighted! As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *\"Those who do not sever lust and practice dhyāna are like one who steams sand, hoping to make rice. Even after a hundred thousand kalpas, it remains only hot sand.\"* How much more so for the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, which unites both nature and life—what then should be done? The *Cuixu Pian* warns: *\"If you wish to prolong life and rescue old age, sever lust and abandon heterodox paths. Only by refining the Spirit-Elixir can you preserve form and dwell forever in the world.\"* Let scholars ponder this carefully.\n\n**Erect a pole and see its shadow; call into the valley and hear its echo—how can this not be wondrous? These are the supreme images of Heaven and Earth.**\nErect a pole, and its shadow appears; call into the valley, and its echo responds—there has never been a stimulus without a response. Thus, the sun and moon hang in the sky: when one seeks fire, fire is born; when one seeks water, water arrives. The resonance is swift—how can this not be supremely wondrous? Yet though all under Heaven see it, none truly understand. The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"The sun’s crow and moon’s hare, two perfect wheels—rooted in the Prior Heaven. To gather them is difficult; gaze at the moonlit night and seize the moment.\"* If scholars can steal Heaven and Earth’s mechanism on the night when the sun and moon face each other, uniting their own sun and moon at the center, then the inner truth will resonate with the outer, and the Elixir will naturally harmonize. Eventually, the sun and moon will be refined.\n\nIf one ingests a mere inch of *Gelsemium* or a single *Croton* seed, one will collapse instantly, unable to bend or rise. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, none could revive the fallen or restore their movement. *Gelsemium* and *Croton* are the most toxic of herbs. Ingesting an inch of *Gelsemium* or a single *Croton* seed causes immediate collapse, and even if King Wen, Confucius, Bian Que, or Wu Xian were present to cast stalks, interpret omens, wield needles, or beat drums, they could not restore life. Yet today, people believe that poisonous herbs can swiftly kill but do not believe that the Spirit-Elixir can grant longevity. How can their lack of reflection be so extreme?\n\nThe River Maiden is numinous and most divine; at the sight of fire, she takes flight, leaving no trace of dust or shadow. The hidden dragon conceals itself, its whereabouts unknown. To subdue her, the Yellow Sprout must serve as the root. True mercury is born in Li. Li is the feminine, residing in Wu; by the division of celestial stems, Wu corresponds to the Three Rivers, hence she is called the River Maiden. Tracing her origin, she arises from emptying the heart and congealing the spirit—truly emerging from within the heart. Thus, she is called numinous mercury or divine mercury. Her nature is fierce and violent; at the sight of fire, she flees without a trace, like a hidden dragon vanishing without a clue. Without the Yellow Sprout as her root, how could she be restrained? The Yellow Sprout is true lead. When mercury obtains true lead, they capture, restrain, and unite, preventing her flight—this is why it serves as the root of the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and defy their origin.**\nA hen lays eggs and hatches chicks, yet not all are complete—why? Because the union was not consummated, the Three and Five did not merge, and hardness and softness remained apart. The Dao is called the union of one yin and one yang; an excess of yin or yang is called illness. For example, a hen that lays eggs without a rooster will surely produce none—why? Because solitary yang does not generate, and solitary yin does not complete. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *\"Do not mistake solitary yin for yang; refining a single substance only weakens the body. Stretching and guiding are not the Dao; refining qi and consuming mist are madness. The world vainly seeks to subdue mercury and lead—when will they see the tiger and dragon descend? I urge you to thoroughly seek the place of your birth, return to the root, and restore the source—this is the King of Medicines.\"* If one can turn the light inward and reflect, uniting one’s own yin and yang within, then hardness and softness will pair, the Three and Five will merge as one—why seek elsewhere? The *Huanyuan Pian* says: *\"Harmonize yin and yang within yourself.\"* The *Yuzhi Shu* states: *\"Yin and yang are not to be sought in other things.\"* The *Huandan Pian* declares: *\"Yin and yang must be gathered from one’s own truth.\"* How could one seek them outside the body?",

The way of transformation in heaven and earth is natural: fire moves upward in flames, water flows downward to moisten—no master guides them to do so. The origin of all things, the governance of the cosmos, cannot be altered. The transformations of heaven and earth, the flaming of fire and moistening of water—are these the work of human effort? They arise spontaneously, of themselves.\n\nWithin our own bodies, heaven and earth exist; water and fire reside there as well. Their transformations, their flaming and moistening—are these the work of human effort? They, too, arise spontaneously, of themselves. The *Zhixuan Pian* says: *\"One must know the meeting of east and west; the path lies in the central harmony of the upper and lower fields.\"* The human body models heaven and earth: the head is heaven, the abdomen is earth. Simply guard the spirit within, neither forgetting nor forcing; regulate the breath through the nose, neither indulging nor restraining. Naturally, there will be opening and closing, receiving and bestowing—no different from the transformative way of heaven and earth.\n\nWhen the time arrives and qi stirs, the mechanism moves, the phoenix cries—then fire arises from below the navel, water is born within the crown. Its wonder unfolds without anticipation, of itself. It is not attained through laboring the spirit or exerting force. This Dao is heaven’s creation, earth’s design—fixed and unalterable.",

      "translated_text": "Lord Wei feared that learners might not grasp the yin and yang within the body, the upper and lower realms—thus he drew analogies to heaven and earth’s transformative processes, to the blazing and moistening of water and fire. His explanation was indeed thorough and lucid.\n\nObserve the moment of union between male and female: hard and soft intertwine, inseparable, attaining their rhythmic harmony—not through artifice or control. The *Quanzhen Collection* states: *\"Qi harmonized, spirit settled, the breath conjoins.\"* The *Cuixu Pian* says: *\"Like husband and wife in union, a single guard of essence and blood forms the infant.\"* This so-called union in the golden elixir is an inner resonance of yin and yang, a merging of spirit and qi—termed \"male and female\" or \"husband and wife\" as metaphors.\n\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* states: *\"When spirit and qi return to the root, body and mind revert to life’s mandate.\"* Such true apertures are known by few. When spirit enters qi and qi unites with spirit, attaining their rhythmic harmony, there arises the state of hard and soft intertwined, inseparable—yet no artifice or control is employed. One merely witnesses its thusness, yet knows not how it comes to be thus. Wondrous! Wondrous indeed!\n\nWhen a male is born, he lies prone; when a female is born, she lies supine—this posture is received at the very inception of qi in the womb, not merely observed at birth. Even in death, they revert to the same. This is not taught by parents; it is predetermined at the moment of union.\n\nChu Huagu’s *Qu Yi Shuo* states: *\"Opening qi makes a male; closing qi makes a female. One opening, one closing—thus male and female are distinguished.\"* Li Yuxi’s commentary on the *Xinyin Jing* says: *\"Male and female receive the same endowment; only the sequence of their union determines yin and yang.\"* Yang qi gathers at the front, so a man’s face is heavier—at birth, he must lie prone. Yin qi gathers at the back, so a woman’s back is heavier—at birth, she must lie supine. This is not only true at birth but also at death. Thus, a man who drowns lies prone; a woman who drowns lies supine. Even beasts that drown do the same. This is not taught by parents; it is fixed from the moment of receiving qi—one opening, one closing, one preceding, one following.\n\nNow, why does Lord Wei expound the Dao of clarity and stillness and yet speak of the prone and supine postures of men and women? There is no other reason: he wishes learners to thoroughly understand the yin and yang, the upper and lower within their own bodies, and to comprehend the natural principles of creation.\n\nThe *Kan* male is the moon; the *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue—this is the husband’s Dao. The moon unfurls its light—this is the wife’s Dao. Yet if the moon is *Kan* male, then the wife becomes the husband; if the sun is *Li* female, then the husband becomes the wife. This is the inversion.\n\nYet how does the sun transform and the moon change without harm to their bodies? It is through the mutual support of yin and yang. The eclipses of the sun and moon occur at their conjunctions. At the full moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed. Thus, eclipses occur at new and full moons—yet not every conjunction brings an eclipse. When they intersect, there is an eclipse; when they do not, there is none.\n\nNow, Lord Wei cites the sun and moon as metaphors for the elixir path, earnestly emphasizing the waxing and waning, the encroachments and obscurations. His intent is profound. Should learners not turn their light inward, seek the sun and moon within their own bodies, and inquire into the waxing and waning within themselves?\n\nThe *Shangqing Collection* states: *\"Watching the Dipper’s handle revolve through the heavens, one suddenly awakens to the wondrous secret of immortality. In an instant, true yang is born in the *Kan* position, guarding the deficiency in the *Li* palace. Since ancient times, *Qian* and *Kun* have never ceased their interplay of *Li* and *Kan*, day after day. On this year’s winter solstice, plum blossoms still congeal like snow. The ancient sages closed their gates on this day, allowing no comings or goings—all for the sake of living beings. Every creature embodies the intent of generation and nurturance. At the cusp of *zi* and *hai*, creation moves silently; fire arises in water—its wonder lies in the *Xu-Wei* cavity. Now that you’ve seen through this, the golden crow flies into the toad’s cave.\"* Such direct revelation of heaven’s mechanism, such clear exposition of the Dao’s essentials, amply confirms Lord Wei’s words—luminous and unerring!\n\nMale and female depend on each other, exhaling and inhaling to nourish; yin and yang intermingle, seeking one another.",
      "overlap_context": "neither indulging nor restraining. Naturally, there will be opening and closing, receiving and bestowing—no different from the transformative way of heaven and earth.\n\nWhen the time arrives and qi stirs, the mechanism moves, the phoenix cries—then fire arises from below the navel, water is born within the crown. Its wonder unfolds without anticipation, of itself. It is not attained through laboring the spirit or exerting force. This Dao is heaven’s creation, earth’s design—fixed and unalterable.",

      "translated_text": "Within the body, male and female, yin and yang are but two aspects of the self. When these two qi intermingle and harmonize, they naturally exhale and inhale, intertwining to form the embryo. The *Shangqing Ji* states: \"Within one’s own body lies a husband and wife.\" To speak thus to the uninitiated would surely invite ridicule—such is the Way. The seeker must pursue it through clarity, stillness, and non-action, not through perverse interpretations.\n\nMetal transforms into water, and the nature of water flows boundlessly. Fire transforms into earth, and water cannot course freely. Metal is born in the *Kan* palace, its qi alone. For metal transforms into water, and when the true fire of the great yang lies concealed and steams beneath, it melts and becomes water. The nature of water flows abundantly—who can resist it? Yet when the fire’s power reaches its zenith, it transforms again into earth. Fire becomes earth, and earth restrains water; when water encounters earth, it halts—thus it cannot flow.\n\nTherefore, the male moves and emits outward, while the female remains still and conceals within. If the overflow exceeds measure, the female constrains it, the *po* restraining the *hun*, preventing excess. The *Ruyao Jing* states: \"Water can flow, fire can flame\"—within the body, this can be verified. Thus, in harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir, one must not exceed measure. Now, *Kan* as male moves and emits outward, while *Li* as female remains still and conceals within. Should the emission exceed measure, *Li* as female will constrain and restrain it, so that *hun* and *po* mutually check each other and do not fall into excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in timely fashion, each attains harmony, and both exhale in mutual confirmation.\n\nWhen gathering the medicine, regulate the fire’s work—neither too swift nor too slow, but seeking only balance and union. The *Fuming Pian* states: \"When firm and yielding meet, qi evens out—its wonder lies in avoiding harm.\" The *Dui* and *Zhen* trigrams hold harmony as their essence.\n\nCinnabar is the essence of wood, and only when united with metal do they merge. Yuan Yangzi’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: \"To know cinnabar as the essence of wood, move it to the west to join with metal.\" For mercury’s nature is to fly and flee, most difficult to subdue; only when cast into the lead crucible and united with lead does it cease to fly or flee.\n\nWhere metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions. These four, in primordial chaos, array as dragon and tiger. The dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. Heaven-one generates water, its position in the north, its symbol the Dark Warrior. Earth-two generates fire, its position in the south, its symbol the Vermilion Bird. Heaven-three generates wood, its position in the east, its symbol the Azure Dragon. Earth-four generates metal, its position in the west, its symbol the White Tiger. These four each dwell in their quadrant, each forming a symbol, originally unrelated.\n\nYet now it is said: \"Where metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions.\" The yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace, while the yin tiger returns from the *Kan* position. Since each forms a symbol, they should be collectively called the Four Symbols. Yet here, only dragon and tiger are mentioned, omitting the Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior—why? North and south form the warp, east and west the weft.\n\nThe phrase \"where metal and water unite\" refers to the metal of the west-four White Tiger descending into water. \"Wood and fire become companions\" refers to the wood of the east-three Azure Dragon ascending into fire. Thus, metal is not in the west but unites with water in the north, and wood is not in the east but becomes fire’s companion in the south. The White Tiger transforms into the Black Tiger, the Azure Dragon into the Red Dragon.\n\nWhen metal, water, wood, and fire—these four—converge as one, they are a primal chaos like the undivided Great Ultimate. When arrayed as two, *Zhen*’s dragon-mercury emerges from *Li*’s homeland, and *Dui*’s tiger-lead is born in *Kan*’s domain. Zhang Ziyang deeply grasped this secret and thus encapsulated it in a single phrase: \"The Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies.\" Later scholars, unaware of what the Four Symbols truly are, mistakenly identify them as the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue, or as the liver and lungs as dragon and tiger. With such misguided recognition, their understanding diverges further—how could they grasp the wonder that the Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies?\n\nThe liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother. The heart, red, is the daughter; the spleen, yellow, the ancestor. The kidneys, black, are the child—the child is the beginning of the Five Phases. The qi of the day arises at *zi*, born in the kidneys, then transmits to the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs. Yet though the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys are five, they are called the Three Substances—why? When metal and water unite, wood and fire become companions, and together with the central *wu-ji* earth, they form three. For the Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth; without *wu-ji*, the elixir cannot form. This is why the Three Substances, one family, all return to *wu-ji*.\n\nThe *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, intestines, gallbladder—all are empty houses, old fences. Saliva, mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood—these can only assist as stepping stones.\" It speaks of the golden elixir as the wondrous Dao of something born from nothing, not a thing of form or substance. Yet now Lord Wei speaks of the Five Viscera—why? It is not that the Five Viscera are used, but that they are borrowed to illustrate the Five Phases. The liver, green, and lungs, white, represent metal and wood; the heart, red, and kidneys, black, represent water and fire. Metal generates water, wood generates fire, so the liver and lungs are likened to father and mother, the heart and kidneys to child and daughter. Yet metal and wood both arise from earth, so the spleen is likened to the ancestor.\n\nIf the kidneys are the child, why are they called the beginning of the Five Phases? The kidneys belong to water, and water’s number is one. The qi of the day arises at *zi*, born in the kidneys, then transmits to the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs.\n\nFirm and yielding alternate in ascent, traversing the divisions in turn. Dragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*. Punishment and virtue converge, meeting in joy. Punishment governs killing and subjugation; virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm dies as the *Kui* star descends upon *mao*. In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star occupies *you*. *Zi* to the south, *wu* to the north—these mutually form the warp and weft.\n\n\"Firm and yielding alternate in ascent\" refers to the two qi mutually aiding and revolving. \"Traversing the divisions in turn\" means circulating through the celestial stems. \"Dragon to the west, tiger to the east, establishing the weft at *mao* and *you*, punishment and virtue converging, meeting in joy\" describes the weft in motion, *mao* and *you* joining, metal and wood uninterrupted. \"Punishment governs killing and subjugation\" is like the autumn qi, stern and killing, gathering all things inward. \"Virtue governs generation and ascent\" is like the spring qi, flourishing and generating, bringing all things forth.\n\n\"In the second month, the elm dies as the *Kui* star descends upon *mao*\"—in the second month, *mao* is established, and the monthly general is *He Kui*. *He Kui* belongs to *xu*, and within *xu* lies *xin*; the elm dies in this month because the killing qi of *xin* metal descends upon *mao*. \"In the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star occupies *you*\"—in the eighth month, *you* is established, and the monthly general is *Tian Gang*. *Tian Gang* belongs to *chen*, and within *chen* lies *yi*; wheat sprouts in this month because the generating qi of *yi* wood occupies *you*.",

      "translated_text": "The number one through nine completes and begins anew. This \"one through nine\" is the same as the arrangement of \"nine above, one below.\" Its completion and renewal mean moving from one to nine, then from nine back to one, circulating endlessly between above and below. \"Containing the Origin in *Xu* and *Wei*, sowing essence at *Zi*\": *Xu* and *Wei* refer to the sun’s arrival at these lunar mansions, where night after night the primordial *qi* takes form. \"Sowing essence at *Zi*\" means that at the *Zi* hour, *qi* reaches the *Weilu* Pass, and true essence is born here.\n\nThe marvel of the Golden Elixir lies in containing the Origin in the precelestial and sowing essence in the postcelestial. What is the precelestial? It is the state of profound stillness, the time before the Supreme Ultimate divides—subtle and indistinct. What is the postcelestial? It is the state of responsive movement, the time after the Supreme Ultimate divides—vague and elusive. The precelestial is but a single *qi*; only in the postcelestial does it transform into true essence.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Half a catty of true mercury, half a catty of lead, produced before the Supreme Ultimate in emptiness and nonbeing. One must hasten to the *Zi* hour to gather them, refine them into golden liquid, and return them to the Elixir Field.\" This is indeed correct. For *Xu* and *Wei* lie between *Hai* and *Zi*, the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir. The *Zi* hour is where the first yang moves. Beyond this point, the path of mother and child divides in the womb. The mystery lies in the *Wei*, *Ji*, *Niu*, *Dou*, and *Nü* lunar mansions. Without profound understanding of the yin and yang within one’s body and deep penetration of Heaven and Earth’s creative transformations, who could grasp this?\n\n*\"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the islet in the river. The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady: for our prince a good mate.\"* The male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude. The dark warrior and the coiled serpent support each other, illustrating how the female and male must mutually depend. If two women share a chamber, their beauty may be exquisite, and even if Su Qin were to mediate or Zhang Yi to propose, deploying eloquent words and persuasive arguments to urge harmony, they could never become husband and wife. Their hair would rot and their teeth decay before they ever knew union. Just as medicinal substances must be of the same kind and their proportions precise, if the ingredients are not of the proper species or their measurements disordered, even if the Yellow Emperor were to tend the furnace, Tai Yi to hold the fire, the Eight Lords to pound and refine, or Huainan to blend and harmonize—even if they built a towering altar with jade steps, offered unicorn flesh and phoenix jerky, held registers and knelt in prayer, or entreated the spirits with solemn vows after fasting and ablutions—any hopes would be in vain. It would be like using glue to mend a broken cauldron or sal ammoniac to treat a festering sore, like adding ice to dispel cold or boiling water to remove scalds, like making a flying *kui* dance or a writhing snake perform—only to see things grow more perverse.\n\nThe Great Way of the Golden Elixir is simply the interplay of one yin and one yang. This principle applies to human affairs and the patterns of all things. Now, Master Wei draws on the *Guan Ju* ode’s imagery of the virtuous maiden matched with the prince to illustrate the union of male and female within the body, and on the dark warrior and coiled serpent to illustrate the mutual dependence of female and male within. This may be called a broad analogy with meticulous comparisons, leaving nothing unaddressed.\n\nMoreover, when the *Dui* maiden and *Gen* youth respond to each other above and below, it is called *Xian*. When the *Li* and *Dui* maidens dwell together but their aspirations differ, it is called *Kui*. This clarifies that yin and yang must complement each other and cannot be one-sided.\n\nAs for the work of the furnace and fire, yin and yang must also be balanced. If the medicinal substances are not of the proper kind or their proportions disordered, even if the Yellow Emperor were to tend the furnace, Tai Yi to hold the fire, the Eight Lords to pound and refine, or Huainan to blend and harmonize—even if they built an altar of gold and jade, offered unicorn and phoenix, fasted and bathed, held registers and knelt in prayer, or presented blue petitions and red memorials to the spirits above and below—all would be a waste of time and effort, laboring in vain. It would be like using glue to mend a broken cauldron, sal ammoniac to treat a festering sore, ice to dispel cold, or boiling water to remove scalds, like making a flying *kui* dance or a writhing snake perform—only to see things grow more perverse.\n\nSome may misinterpret the saying \"the male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude\" to mean that one must use a woman in elixir refinement, thus falling into the error of \"solitary yang.\" They then cite this passage to justify their perverse theories, while mocking the true Way as impractical and pedantic. Such people clearly overestimate their own understanding.\n\n*Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Middle\n*Section: Masters, Daoist Works, Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*",

      "translated_text": "From the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*, *Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* by Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty, Scroll Lower:\n\nThe ancient sages and worthies embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True. \"Seeing nothing, hearing nothing, embracing the spirit in stillness\"—this was the embrace of the Mysterious and True by Guangchengzi. \"Concentrating qi to attain suppleness, able to be like an infant\"—this was the embrace of the Mysterious and True by Laozi. Then there were Nüwa, who smelted the five-colored stones to mend the heavens; Ranshi, who attained the center of the ring and followed its completion; and the cinnabar methods of Lie Yukou, the clerk of Qiyuan. Let no scholar say that only those with innate immortal bones may seek the Way. With resolve, none is beyond attainment. What were the sages but men? What am I but a man? Those who act may do likewise.\n\nThe aspirant of the Dao, if truly able to rouse a courageous heart, exert diligent effort, and practice unceasingly day and night, will find that when the time comes, qi transforms of itself, and as water flows, channels form of themselves. What then is there to fear in the failure of stubborn stones to soften or iron pestles to become needles?\n\nYet one may study without encounter, encounter without attainment, or even attain the true formula yet fail to preserve it. To work at dawn and desire results by dusk, to sit in practice and expect effects by standing—this is to seek the profit of a ladle before the strength of a bushel is firm, or to incur the cost of a thousand stones while the foundation remains shallow, only to suffer the alternating assaults of frost and ice. In such cases, even if Guangchengzi or Laozi were one’s teacher, and Liezi or Zhuangzi one’s companions, what could they do?\n\nAlas! The *Gold and Jade Collection* of Ma Danyang states: \"Refining qi is one’s livelihood, nurturing spirit one’s daily practice. Keep dragon and tiger harmonized, lest horse and monkey play.\" It also says: \"Observe the great Dao of heaven’s movements, silently attain the union of Qian and Kun. The oral transmission of the original master holds the greatest merit in non-action.\" For the ancients who refined the elixir, not a single thought arose, and all dharmas were forgotten. In utter clarity and stillness, they followed only the Dao. Within quiescent concentration, they embraced the qi of harmonious emptiness. Their exhalations were faint, their inhalations continuous, rising to the Mud Pill and descending to the Gate of Life, circulating without cease. Spirit and qi never parted for even a moment. When the inner elixir neared completion, primordial qi naturally abided in the cinnabar field, governing as one with heaven and earth.\n\nFormerly, the Yellow Emperor retired to the Hall of Great Courtyard for three months, practicing inner contemplation—this was the very Dao. This Dao is most simple and most easy. Within the twelve hours of a day, if the heart constantly guides qi, qi unites with spirit, and form endures forever, revolving with the sun and moon, turning with the River of Heaven. Endless turning, boundless longevity.\n\nThe *Mysterious Chapter* states: \"If only each breath attends to the other, the jade liquid will flow, transforming the entire bodily frame.\" Such is its meaning. If one exhales without the spirit’s governance, a single breath is incomplete; if one inhales without the spirit’s governance, a single breath is likewise incomplete. The key lies in heart and breath constantly depending on each other, spirit and qi constantly guarding each other, thoughts continuously linked, forged into one. Only then are form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\n\nThe *Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source* says: \"Spirit is nature, qi is life. When spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles.\" The *Anthology of Immortal Joys* states: \"When qi and spirit meet, nature abides and life is stabilized.\" Truly, they must not be separated even for an instant.\n\nOrdinary people are not so. Though qi breathes within, the spirit is ever ensnared by external affairs. From youth to maturity, from maturity to old age, not a single breath rests within the body. Thus, spirit and qi each follow their own course without mutual guardianship. Eventually, the dwelling becomes empty, walls crumble, and the master cannot sustain himself. Is this the doing of heaven and earth’s destruction, or the harm of demonic spirits? No—it is the loss of the Dao and self-departure.\n\nThe *Zhong-Lü Transmission of the Dao* by Shi Qizhen states: \"What is exhaled is one’s own primordial qi, issuing from within. What is inhaled is heaven and earth’s true qi, entering from without. If one’s root is firm and primordial qi undiminished, then even in breathing, one may seize heaven and earth’s true qi. But if the root is unsteady, essence exhausted, and qi weakened—above, primordial qi leaks away; below, the original palace is unfortified. The true qi of heaven and earth, inhaled, follows the exhalation outward, and the body’s primordial qi ceases to belong to oneself, instead being seized by heaven and earth.\" Thus, immortals often say: \"Refinement must be timely. Once the crucible is ruined, there is no remedy.\"\n\nSu Ziyou, in his later years, inquired of the immortal nun Zheng about the art of nourishing life. She replied: \"Your vessel is ruined. The Dao is difficult to attain.\" For the medicinal ingredients, early cultivation is precious. If one practices only in old age, essence will be depleted, qi exhausted, lead withered, and mercury scarce. Even with effort, one may only prolong life in peace—nothing more.\n\nThe *Emerald Writ* states: \"It is all clear in a few words: the paths of youth and age differ in ease and difficulty.\" This is its meaning.\n\nSome may ask: Lü Chunyang began to hear the Dao at fifty; Ma Ziran and Liu Langran both attained the Dao after sixty-four. Why is this? The answer: \"A ruined house is easy to repair; withered medicine is not hard to revive. Only know the method of return. Gold and treasure may pile like mountains—yet what of one’s daily cultivation?\"\n\nRefining the Nine Cauldrons, one’s traces vanish into seclusion. The Nine Cauldrons refer to the nine revolutions of the fire phase. When the fire phase’s number is complete, transformations occur, and traces disappear. One roams freely between heaven and earth, riding the void. As Lü Chunyang’s *Song of the Kiln’s Ruin* says: \"Nine years of fire phase have passed. Suddenly, the Heavenly Gate atop the head breaks open. The true person appears, and great spiritual powers manifest. From this, heavenly immortals come to offer congratulations.\" Such is its meaning.\n\nContaining essence and nurturing spirit, one communicates with the virtue of the Three Origins. The Three Origins are the three fields: upper, middle, and lower. With long containment and deep effort, spirit and essence are stored within, harmonious qi fills the entire body, and the hundred bones and myriad orifices are all pervaded. Naturally, it is like the turning of the River of Heaven. The *Precious Chapter of Primordial Unity* states: \"With years of practice, no effort is needed. The fire wheel and water axle turn of themselves.\" Such is it.\n\nWhat is meant by \"containing essence and nurturing spirit\"? Externally, one does not toil the bodily frame; internally, one does not labor the heart and will. For if spirit is overused, it tires; if essence is overused, it depletes. Day after day, it is whittled away until one rots with the grasses and trees—is this not deeply lamentable?\n\nThus, those who refine the elixir empty the heart, forget the form, guard the One, and embrace the numinous. Only then can they secure essence, preserve qi, and perfect spirit. When the three fields are full of essence and the five viscera brim with qi, only then is the elixir complete.\n\nThe *Transformation Book* of Tan Jingsheng states: \"Sorrow brings tears like rain; bitterness brings mucus like rain. Rage forms goiters; anger forms abscesses. Where the heart desires, qi follows—nothing is not nurtured. If one errs here, one must err there.\" Therefore, the great person restrains sorrow and bitterness, cautions against rage and anger, attains the gate of vast qi, and gathers the root. Knowing the bag of original spirit, one veils its light. Like the clam’s inner guarding, like the stone’s inner concealment—this is the chamber of pearls and jade. Truly, it is the ultimate discourse.",
      "overlap_context": "Some may misinterpret the saying \"the male does not dwell alone, nor the female in solitude\" to mean that one must use a woman in elixir refinement, thus falling into the error of \"solitary yang.\" They then cite this passage to justify their perverse theories, while mocking the true Way as impractical and pedantic. Such people clearly overestimate their own understanding.\n\n*Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, Scroll Middle\n*Section: Masters, Daoist Works, Explication of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*",

      "translated_text": "When essence overflows the interstices of skin and sinews, bones become firm. The interstices lie between skin and flesh. Through cultivation, when essence overflows the interstices, blood transforms entirely into marrow-fat. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Now the whole body is white blood, and one feels no cold through the four seasons.\" Truly, no practice surpasses filling the brain, for the brain is the sea of marrow. When the brain’s marrow is full, pure yang flows and overflows, filling all marrow. Only then are bones solid and sinews firm, forever free from the worries of cold and heat.\n\nAll perverse influences are dispelled, and upright qi abides. That by which humans cultivate and attain longevity is their ability to steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth. That by which humans steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth is their breath. Exhalation reaches the root; inhalation reaches the stem—thus they steal the upright qi of Heaven and Earth and return it to the cinnabar field. Human breath is like the breath of Heaven and Earth. The *Huangji Jingshi Shu* states: \"After the winter solstice is exhalation; after the summer solstice is inhalation.\" This is the yearly breath of Heaven and Earth. Zhang Guanwu’s commentary says: \"After the winter solstice, yang grows and yin wanes, unfolding the myriad things—hence exhalation. After the summer solstice, yin grows and yang wanes, gathering the myriad things—hence inhalation.\" If speaking of a single day, then after midnight is exhalation, and after noon is inhalation. One year of Heaven is but a single breath of humankind. Thus, the number of one cosmic cycle—129,600 years—is but a single year in the great transformation. Now, in speaking of the Dao of the elixir: in one day, there are 13,500 exhalations and 13,500 inhalations. One exhalation and one inhalation make a single breath. In the space of one breath, one subtly seizes the workings of 13,500 years of celestial motion. In one year of 360 days, there are 4,860,000 breaths, subtly seizing 4,860,000 years of celestial motion. Thereby, the foul and turbid body is entirely exchanged, transformed into a body of pure yang. First, the qi is changed; next, the blood; next, the vessels; next, the flesh; next, the marrow; next, the sinews; next, the bones; next, the hair; next, the form. After nine years and nine transformations, yin is exhausted and yang is pure, and one’s years equal those of Heaven and Earth—this is the Dao of longevity and transcendence.\n\nNow, when Master Wei says, \"All perverse influences are dispelled, and upright qi abides,\" he means that by circulating the fire day and night, one refines away all yin qi, transforming it into pure yang, so that upright qi abides and one attains longevity. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"The body permeated with golden light, the marrow fragrant; golden sinews and jade bones—all pure yang. Refine until the red blood flows white, yin qi dissolved, and the body is naturally sound.\" For pure yang is the immortal, pure yin the demon, and half yin and half yang the human. If one can refine yang to dissolve yin, one may become an immortal of pure yang. If even a trace of yin qi remains unrefined, one cannot be called pure yang.\n\nThrough long and gradual accumulation, the form is transformed, and one becomes an immortal. Great indeed!",

      "translated_text": "Alas! The method of the Dao of the Elixir is modeled on Heaven. How arduous! The ceaseless practice of elixir-work. Why say so? The *Yin Fu Jing* states: \"Observe the Way of Heaven, grasp the movement of Heaven—this is all.\" That by which Heaven is long and enduring is its ceaseless movement day and night. If one can observe the Way of Heaven and turn inward to seek it within oneself, emulating Heaven’s ceaseless movement day and night, then the Way of long life and enduring vision truly lies herein. Apart from this, there is no other Way.\n\nNow, the ceaseless movement day and night is the Way of Heaven. That a person, with their humble six-foot frame, can emulate the Way of Heaven and harmonize their movement with that of Heaven—how great is this Way! The *Yi Jing* says: \"Heaven’s movement is strong; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens themselves.\" The Master’s intent in composing the hexagrams was to make those who know the Way emulate the strength of Heaven’s movement. That by which Heaven constantly moves without ceasing is its strength. If one is strong, one can move without end. If the noble person wishes their movement to be unceasing, they should emulate this strength and fortify their resolve—only then can it be so.\n\nYet ceaselessness is what people find difficult. Heaven’s movement continues day and night without rest; if a person emulates Heaven’s ceaseless movement, how difficult is this! Nevertheless, great affairs in the world must begin with the small, and difficult tasks must begin with the easy. A tree of great girth grows from a tiny sprout; a nine-story terrace rises from heaped earth; a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Thus, the sage plans for difficulty while it is still easy and achieves greatness while it is still small—all lies in the accumulation of long and gradual effort.\n\nThe *Huang Ting Jing* states: \"Immortal and Daoist are not divine; through accumulating essence and amassing qi, they attain perfection.\" Thus, from the moment of forming the embryo in a brief instant, after a hundred days the work becomes numinous; after ten months the embryo is complete; after one year there is small attainment; after three years, great attainment. Only after nine years, when the work is complete and all human affairs are exhausted, can one leave the world behind, stand alone, grow feathers, and ascend as an immortal. There has never been one who attained this without long and gradual accumulation. If one claims that without such accumulation one can suddenly ascend as an immortal, it is like digging a well nine *ren* deep with a single shovel or climbing a city wall a hundred million *zhang* high in a single step—how could this be possible?\n\nThe *Tong Xuan Zhen Jing* says: \"Though the lame turtle rests not a step, it travels a thousand miles; though earth is heaped without cease, a mountain is formed. By the river, one who desires fish would do better to return and weave a net.\" Thus, in learning the Dao, one need not fear failure—only lack of diligence. One need not fear lack of diligence—only lack of enduring resolve. For enduring resolve is the most difficult.\n\nWu Zongxuan’s *Xuan Gang Lun* states: \"Among a thousand who know the Dao, one resolves to follow it; among a thousand who resolve to follow it, one is single-minded; among a thousand who are single-minded, one is diligent and enduring. Thus, though many study, few succeed.\" If those who know can resolve, those who resolve can sever worldly ties, those who sever worldly ties can be single-minded, and those who are single-minded can be diligent and enduring, there is none who studies and does not attain. Yet as the world declines and customs deteriorate, and the distance from the sages grows ever greater, students often approach the path of stillness with restless hearts, seeking quick results and immediate responses, desiring near outcomes from distant efforts. None can persist to the end.\n\nHaving resolved, their resolve is not firm; believing in the Dao, their faith is not steadfast. They change course from morning to evening, begin with diligence but falter midway, delighting in the moment and wearying of perseverance. Yet they wish to match the years of Heaven and Earth—is this not foolish?\n\nThe *Nei Guan Jing* says: \"Knowing the Dao is easy; believing in it is difficult. Believing in the Dao is easy; practicing it is difficult. Practicing the Dao is easy; attaining it is difficult. Attaining the Dao is easy; preserving it is difficult.\" If it were not difficult, the streets would be filled with immortals—what would be extraordinary about that?\n\nLü Chunyang’s poem says:\n*\"Three acres of cinnabar field, unsown—\nTo sow them, one must borrow the Red Dragon’s plow.\nI once taught others to sow this seed,\nBut none understood its cultivation—how could the Dao grow?\"*\n\nIs the Dao distant from people? No—people distance themselves from the Dao.\n\nPeople merely see the *Wu Zhen Pian*’s line: \"The radiant red elixir forms in a day,\" and take the ancient immortals’ words as true and worthy of hearing. Yet when it speaks of nine years or three years, they dismiss it as mere procrastination, mocking the idea of long and gradual accumulation. They fail to understand that Master Ziyang’s poem borrows the words of Han Xiaoyao to enlighten those in the world who, unaware of the marvel of seeing effects in a single day, merely toil for three or nine years. It does not mean one can ascend as an immortal in a day without long and gradual effort.\n\nLet us examine this further. The *Shang Qing Ji* says:\n*\"Teach me to practice for a brief moment—\nBones grow cold, the heart’s flower forms into a single red grain.\"*\nIt also says:\n*\"In the mid-autumn night of the Kai Xi era, I burned incense, knelt, and received the oral transmission.\nIn just two or three days of practice, Heaven and Earth, sun and moon became soft as silk.\"*\n\nYet it also says:\n*\"Even if one’s work reveals mercury and lead,\nWithout knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.\nIt all depends on the fire of the Zhou Tian—\nOnly after ten months is the sacred embryo complete.\nThough the head of the elixir forms, it will dissipate in the end.\nOne must know the firing times to solidify it.\"*\n\nThus, while the minor effects of the golden elixir may be seen in a brief moment, its great work certainly does not end in a single day.\n\nMoreover, let us consider the sayings of the ancients. Wang Yixuan says:\n*\"Nine transformations in one year—\nLifespan may equal Heaven and Earth.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After the fire has circulated for a thousand days,\nThe furnace opens to reveal the eight jades.\"*\n\nHan Xiaoyao says:\n*\"After ten months, it is complete, resplendent between the Two Modes.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Three years emulate Heaven’s movement—\nForever free, the golden body is perfected.\"*\n\nWang and Han were both true immortals of the Tang who attained the Dao—would they speak falsely?\n\nLü Chunyang says:\n*\"A thousand days of work, never idle—\nThe river chariot carries its load up Kun Mountain.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Only when the celestial tally descends to the Jade Capital\nDo three thousand days of accumulated work begin.\"*\n\nLiu Haichan says:\n*\"The furnace seals the eight passes, completing the nine and five—\nThe medicine connects the seven returns—this takes three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After nine transformations, the work is complete in a thousand days—\nAlready, names are listed among the immortals.\"*\n\nDongbin and Haichan are among the most eminent of the immortals—would they speak falsely?\n\nNot only this. Chen Chaoyuan says:\n*\"Nurturing the embryo requires ten months;\nRefining the elixir takes three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"After nine years of return without error,\nRefine pure yang to become the perfect truth.\"*\n\nWang Liangqi says:\n*\"The great general follows Heaven’s law, refining for a thousand days—\nThen the false is removed, and only the true remains.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The magic mushroom fills the three cinnabar fields—\nA thousand days of work extends ten thousand years.\"*\n\nXue Zixian says:\n*\"The four images are contained, returning to Wu and Si—\nDiligently for ten months, the infant is born.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"Ascension must wait until three years—\nTenderly nurtured, with much affection.\"*\n\nLiu Xugu says:\n*\"The countenance may be fixed by three dwellings;\nThe embryo’s breath succeeds in one cycle.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"The great work nears completion in three thousand days—\nThe wondrous use is flawless through the twelve hours.\"*\n\nChen Momo says:\n*\"The firing times gather and form in a hundred days;\nThe work is refined—this takes three years.\"*\n\nLi Changyuan says:\n*\"Do not say the elixir is complete in a day—\nIn the end, one must devote several years of work.\"*\n\nChen Cuixu says:\n*\"A moment’s work refines and reveals maturity—\nYet one must pass three years.\"*\nAnd:\n*\"A thousand mornings of firing times, knowing the seasons—\nThe sprout is certain, and mercury dries of itself.\"*\n\nWould all these masters have spoken falsely to deceive later generations?\n\nQiu Changchun’s *Pan Xi Ji* says:\n*\"Though blessings are light and demonic obstacles heavy,\nPress on—when the work is complete, it will surely be whole.\nLet our fellowship strive!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "fragrant; golden sinews and jade bones—all pure yang. Refine until the red blood flows white, yin qi dissolved, and the body is naturally sound.\" For pure yang is the immortal, pure yin the demon, and half yin and half yang the human. If one can refine yang to dissolve yin, one may become an immortal of pure yang. If even a trace of yin qi remains unrefined, one cannot be called pure yang.\n\nThrough long and gradual accumulation, the form is transformed, and one becomes an immortal. Great indeed!",

      "translated_text": "Alas for later generations—those who love the Dao, following in the wake of others’ elegance, tracing the brushstrokes of ancient texts, compiling them into illustrated volumes to instruct posterity. They expose the branches while concealing the root, adopting cryptic names like \"various stones\" to obscure the truth. Scholars who obtain these works treasure them in caskets all their lives; sons inherit their fathers’ pursuits, grandsons follow their ancestors’ paths, passing them down through generations—yet remain deluded, never awakening to the truth. Thus, officials abandon their posts, farmers neglect their plows, merchants forsake their goods, and men of aspiration fall into poverty. I grieve deeply for them.\n\nHere, I record these words—concise in language, simple in thought, sparing in detail. Each clause is laid out clearly, its substance verifiable, its measures and weights precise. Following their sequence, one may discern the pattern; the text’s gates and apertures lie open.

Thus, they followed the elegance of others, traced the brushstrokes of ancient texts, and compiled them into illustrated volumes to guide them, truly intending to provide seekers with a path to trace the stream back to its source.\n\nYet in their writings, they often concealed the root, refusing to speak plainly, instead adopting names like \"the five metals and eight stones\" to expose only the branches. Those who later obtained these books, failing to fathom their essence, merely treasured them in caskets all their lives. Generation after generation, they remained deluded, exhausting cinnabar and mercury to no avail. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers left their fields untended, merchants lost their livelihoods, and men of aspiration had no means to sustain themselves. How lamentable!\n\nMaster Wei, grieving over this, thus composed and transmitted the *Cantong Qi* to the world. Within it, measures and weights are precise, not a single word is idly spoken.

      "translated_text": "Within its single-sentence oral formula, the teachings are dispersed across three chapters—thus the words are deliberately disordered, the gates and apertures concealed, lest the whole be carelessly revealed in one piece. Those of wisdom, if they examine and ponder it, cross-referencing with their own insight, will surely awaken to its truth.\n\nNo image is greater than Heaven and Earth, whose dark ravine spans tens of thousands of *li*. The greatness of the Dao cannot be captured in form or description; if one must describe it, then only Heaven and Earth suffice. Heaven and Earth are the greatest of all images, and within them lies the dark ravine—a celestial gulf stretching from the Tail and Winnowing Basket stars to the boundary of the Willow Star, cleaving the celestial vault in a span of countless *li*. Those who refine the elixir, if they truly model themselves upon Heaven and emulate Earth, turning inward to seek within their own bodies, will discover that within themselves lies a flask of Heaven. Only then will they understand that what Master Wei called the dark ravine is also present within them, and there is no need to seek it in the sky. What is this dark ravine? It is the Celestial River.\n\nWhen the River Drum nears the Star Marker, all the people are struck with terror. The River Drum is a star beside the Celestial River, positioned between the Dipper and Ox stars. The Star Marker is the *chou* position of the celestial vault. When the River Drum aligns with the Star Marker, it drives back the Tail Cavity, linking the empty flames and herding them into the Celestial Thoroughfare, surging straight upward. At the very moment of breaking through the pass and finding the path, how could the people within the body not tremble in alarm? The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Above the Winding River, the Golden Crow flies; the Moon Maiden rejoices with the Dipper and Ox\"—this refers precisely to the River Drum nearing the Star Marker. It also says: \"Mountains and rivers, the great earth, erupt in fierce fire; within, the ten thousand images stir with wind and thunder\"—this speaks of all the people being struck with terror.\n\nIf the sundial’s shadow recklessly advances or retreats, nine years of misfortune will follow. The sundial’s shadow refers to the firing times; advancing and retreating refer to progression and withdrawal. Nine years refers to the nine revolutions. If we compress nine years into a smaller scale, one month per cycle constitutes one revolution—the *Cui Xu Pian* speaks of \"nine revolutions of effort, nine months in use.\" If we compress it further, within a single moment there are minor nine revolutions—the *Jin Dan Da Cheng Ji* states: \"The nine revolutions of effort occur in an instant.\" If the sundial’s shadow recklessly advances or retreats, nine years of misfortune will follow: only if the firing times’ progression and withdrawal are not off by even a hair’s breadth can one steadily ride the Yellow Mare through the nine revolutions and remain free of calamity. Otherwise, during the nine revolutions, the Purple River Chariot will overturn, and misfortune will swiftly arrive. The *Wu Zhen Pian* states: \"It all depends on the power of cultivation; if off by even a hair’s breadth, the elixir will not form.\" One cannot be careless.\n\nWhen the August One gazes upon it, the King retreats to the rear. The *Tai Shang Su Ling Jing* states: \"The human body contains the Three Ones: the Upper One is the Heavenly Emperor of the body; the Middle One is the Cinnabar Emperor of the Crimson Palace; the Lower One is the Primordial King of the Yellow Court.\" Now, the Upper Heavenly Emperor is the Mud Pill Monarch of the Niwan; the Middle Cinnabar Emperor is the Heavenly Son of the Crimson Palace; the Lower Primordial King is the Primordial Yang Monarch of the Cinnabar Field. When Master Wei speaks of the August One gazing upon it, he refers to directing the spirit-fire to illuminate and enter the Kan trigram, driving out the true yang within Kan. When the King retreats to the rear, this means the true yang, pressed by the fire, emerges from its position in Kan. At this point, if one mobilizes the River Chariot, the true yang will ascend and soar, transforming the true yin of the Li Palace.\n\nThe gate-bolt has its rises and falls; the celestial revolution thus proceeds. The shape of Heaven is like a pellet, revolving day and night without cease. Its north and south poles—one high, one low—form the gate-bolt. The human body is the same: the Celestial Pass is above, the Earthly Axis below. If one can turn the Celestial Pass and rotate the Earthly Axis, aligning above and below, then with each breath, a full celestial revolution is completed.\n\nThe rivers and streams never run dry; their waters flow into the sea. The sea is where all rivers converge. The waters of the rivers and streams flow into the sea without ever running dry because the great mountains and rivers are interconnected through cavities, circulating endlessly. The human body is the same: when the qi flows unimpeded, the waters of the eight meridians all reverse their course and rush into the Primordial Sea.\n\nThe female and male of Heaven and Earth linger between *zi* and *wu*. *Wu* is the center of Heaven; *zi* is the center of Earth. *Zi* and *wu* are the places where yin and yang intersect, where water and fire meet. When the sun and moon reach this point, they must linger. Today, when the sun is at its zenith, it is called \"pausing at *wu*,\" which is the meaning of lingering. In the Dao of the elixir, ascent and descent, rising and falling, also linger between *zi* and *wu*—this follows the same path as Heaven and Earth, with no difference.\n\n*Yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang, the gate of all things’ exit and entry. When the Dipper points to *yin*, spring arrives under Heaven, and the yang qi begins to flourish, bringing forth the ten thousand things. When the Dipper points to *shen*, autumn arrives under Heaven, and the yin qi begins to restrain, gathering in the ten thousand things. Thus, *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors of yin and yang, the gate of all things’ exit and entry. In the Dao of the elixir, exiting at *yin* and entering at *shen*, cycling endlessly, is this not the same as Heaven and Earth?\n\nFollowing the Dipper to summon the *Yao* star, grasping the balance to determine the primordial cycle. The *Shu Ji* of the *Tian Guan Shu* states: \"The handle of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars drags the Dragon’s Horn; the balance of the Southern Dipper’s scoop rests on the head of Orion. At dusk, the handle establishes the cycle; at midnight, the balance establishes it; at dawn, the scoop establishes it.\" It also states: \"The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, distinguishing yin and yang, establishing the four seasons, balancing the five phases, shifting the solar terms, and determining all cycles—all depend on the Dipper.\" The *Dou Suo Yin* states: \"The *Chun Qiu Yun Dou Ji* says: the Dipper’s first star is the Celestial Pivot, the second is the Jade Swivel, the third is the Jade Armillary, the fourth is the Balance, the fifth is the Crossbar, the sixth is the Open Yang, and the seventh is the Twinkling Brilliance. The first through fourth form the scoop; the fifth through seventh form the handle.\" When Master Wei speaks of following the Dipper to summon the *Yao* star and grasping the balance to determine the primordial cycle, he refers to the celestial pivot of one’s own body pointing from *zi* and cycling through the twelve branches.\n\nThe Dipper resides at the center of Heaven just as the heart resides at the center of the human body. Thus, Heaven uses the Dipper as its mechanism, and humans use the heart as theirs. In the elixir method, the heart directs the firing times just as Heaven uses the Dipper to govern the twelve branches. The *Cui Xu Pian* states: \"Seizing the Heavenly mechanism’s wonder, at midnight observe the Dipper’s handle—a few drops of pearly dew, who moves them to the rice flower’s head?\" This is precisely what it means.\n\nAscending and steaming upon the Steamer Mountain, flames blazing below; the White Tiger sings in the lead, the Azure Dragon harmonizes behind. The Steamer Mountain is Kunlun Mountain. When the medicine ascends, the golden furnace blazes, the jade crucible boils, the tiger roars first, and the dragon sings after—like a husband leading and his wife following. The *Jin Dan Da Cheng Ji* states: \"When the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep of night, swiftly drive the River Chariot without pause. In an instant, carry it to the Niwan’s peak, advance the fire, and refine it in the jade furnace until it resembles snow.\" This clarifies the meaning.",

      "translated_text": "The Vermilion Bird soars and plays, its five-colored plumage dazzling—yet it encounters the spread net, pressed down and unable to rise. Its cries are mournful and bitter, like an infant longing for its mother. Overturned into the seething cauldron, its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.\n\nThe Vermilion Bird is fire. When overturned and driven within the crucible, it chases and urges the Five Agents, forming the five colors and soaring above. If enveloped by the net, wind and clouds fill the crucible, and the cries resemble those of an infant. Once caught in the net and pressed down, unable to take flight, it gathers its body and folds its wings, crouching within the crucible. The *Chilong Dadan Jue* states: \"The Vermilion Bird loves to fly high, yet the Toad seizes it. Though it cries as the Alchemical Maiden, its weeping is no more than an infant’s. Its radiant power flourishes, but its hidden strength gradually wanes.\" This is precisely the meaning. The *Yuanyangzi Dadao Ge* says: \"The Azure Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger follows the Dragon. The Red Bird mates, their voices harmonious. Regulating qi and managing fire, cinnabar enters the abdomen from the Li Palace, and the body naturally ascends.\" This, too, clarifies the meaning.\n\nBefore half the clepsydra has passed, the dragon’s scales and mane rise, and the five colors gleam and shimmer, transforming without constancy. The crucible boils turbulently, surging violently without cease. Layer upon layer, interlocking like canine teeth, its form resembles midwinter ice. The railing drips with stalactites, towering and jumbled, heaped and propped against one another.\n\n\"Before half the clepsydra has passed, the dragon’s scales and mane rise\" refers to the moment of refinement: in less than a moment, qi subtly traverses the Three Passes, yellow clouds form ranks, white sheep gather in herds, and golden coins, golden flowers, and golden scales arrive in profusion. \"The five colors gleam and shimmer, transforming without constancy\" describes how the wind sways the jeweled tree, its light filling the eyes, and rain strikes the jade flowers, snow covering one’s robes—crimson clouds and purple mists manifest in endless variation. \"The crucible boils turbulently, surging violently without cease\" means that when the fire in the Cinnabar Field blazes and the wind in the Mud Pill Palace arises, the Three Palaces fill with qi, like the moment when steamed rice in a rice steamer is fully cooked, and boiling water surges within the pot. \"Layer upon layer, interlocking like canine teeth, its form resembles midwinter ice; the railing drips with stalactites, towering and jumbled, heaped and propped against one another\" describes how, with each inhalation and exhalation, the elixir gradually congeals and coalesces, pouring forth the Yellow Sprout from the earth, naturally forming buds and sprouting blossoms. The *Cuixu Pian* states: \"Though the toil lasts but ten months, gradually gathering and congealing, if the scholar can inwardly refine with devotion, day and night without weariness, the elixir’s form will change with each passing hour, and the fire’s work will not err from night to night. As in the scenes above, each will be personally witnessed.\"\n\nWhen yin and yang attain their union, they dwell in tranquil harmony.\nThe *Wu Zhen Pian* says: \"When yin and yang unite in harmony, the two eights naturally pair. If the true breath flows continuously without interruption, yin and yang will attain their union. By emptying the mind and concentrating the spirit in pure unity, yin and yang will naturally dwell in harmony.\"\n\nThe Azure Dragon resides in House Six, the spring blossoms of the Zhen Palace in the east at Mao. The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, the autumn awns of the Dui Palace in the west at You. The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two, the true yang of the Li Palace in the south at Wu. When all three come to pay court, their household becomes kin. Originally but two things, in the end they become three, five, and three-five—all gathering at Danger One, converging in the place of governance. The days of refinement follow the method above.\n\nThe twenty-eight lunar lodges of the celestial circuit: the seven lodges of the east are called the Azure Dragon; the seven lodges of the west are called the White Tiger. Among the twelve celestial divisions, the middle one of the three eastern divisions is called *Great Fire*; the middle one of the three western divisions is called *Great Beam*. *Great Fire* lies at the center of the three eastern divisions, in the celestial position of Chen, corresponding to Mao, belonging to the trigram Zhen, to spring, and to wood. House Five Degrees resides within *Great Fire*, hence it is said: \"The Azure Dragon resides in House Six, the spring blossoms of the Zhen Palace in the east at Mao.\" *Great Beam* lies at the center of the three western divisions, in the celestial position of Xu, corresponding to You, belonging to the trigram Dui, to autumn, and to metal. Pleiades Seven Degrees resides within *Great Beam*, hence it is said: \"The White Tiger dwells in Pleiades Seven, the autumn awns of the Dui Palace in the west at You.\" \"The Vermilion Bird is in Spread Two, the true yang of the Li Palace in the south at Wu\" refers to Spread, a lodge of the southern quadrant, whose symbol is the Vermilion Bird. Though Spread spans eighteen degrees, only two are mentioned here, for the celestial circle of 365 degrees is bisected between the northern lodges Void and Danger, and Danger’s first degree aligns precisely with Spread Two in the south. \"When all three come to pay court, their household becomes kin\" means that the true qi of the three directions—Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird—all converge at the Dark Warrior’s position. House Six and Pleiades Seven correspond to the completion numbers of water and fire, while Spread Two and Danger One correspond to the generative numbers of water and fire, like kinfolk drawing near. \"Originally but two things, in the end they become three, five, and three-five—all gathering at Danger One\" means that at their root, they are merely water and fire. When these two are moved within the crucible, they arrange into three and five, that is, House Six, Pleiades Seven, and Spread Two. When the three families meet and converge at Danger One, the infant is formed. \"The days of refinement follow the method above\" means that in cultivating the Great Elixir, one must proceed according to the method above, awaiting the moment when the solitary yang arises to advance the fire, for the marvelous work begins at Void and Danger.\n\nFirst white, then yellow, with red permeating both inside and out—this is called the First Crucible, its form like a grain of millet.\n\n\"First white, then yellow\" describes how it initially resembles jade liquid flying through the void, then gradually appears as flowing gold filling the hut. \"Red permeating both inside and out\" describes how the numinous light and divine flame burn through heaven and earth, with wind, thunder, clouds, and mist filling the mountains and rivers. \"Called the First Crucible\" refers to the first of the nine cycles of firing. \"Its form like a grain of millet\" means that when the elixir head has just formed, it is no larger than a millet grain.\n\nIt is the work of spontaneity, not of deviance or falsehood.\n\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir has often been regarded by ancient immortals as spontaneous. If it is truly spontaneous, what need is there for methods or oral instructions? One need only entrust it to spontaneity—why rely on a teacher’s transmission? Yet this is not so. The method of the elixir is most simple and most easy; its divine mechanism and marvelous workings require no contrivance, no thought. Thus it is called spontaneous. However, one must withdraw the gaze and return the hearing, concentrating the spirit within. With each breath, long and unbroken, neither hurried nor slow, without interruption, the spirit returns to the qi, and the qi unites with the spirit, intertwining to form the embryo. It is not merely a matter of entrusting everything to spontaneity.",
      "overlap_context": "ountain is Kunlun Mountain. When the medicine ascends, the golden furnace blazes, the jade crucible boils, the tiger roars first, and the dragon sings after—like a husband leading and his wife following. The *Jin Dan Da Cheng Ji* states: \"When the dragon sings and the tiger roars in the deep of night, swiftly drive the River Chariot without pause. In an instant, carry it to the Niwan’s peak, advance the fire, and refine it in the jade furnace until it resembles snow.\" This clarifies the meaning.",

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of the Golden and Azure Dragon-Tiger* states: \"The essential point of spontaneity lies in first preserving and then forgetting. First preserving and then forgetting means first preserving the spirit within the qi-cavern, and afterward forgetting it together with the qi. Practicing thus, the spirit naturally congeals, the qi naturally gathers, and the breath naturally stabilizes—this is not the same as settling the mind into quiescence like withered wood or dead ashes. For while settling the mind into quiescence like withered wood or dead ashes may serve as a means to enter the Dao, it is not sufficient for cultivating truth.\"\n\nThe *Zhi Xuan Pian* says: \"The merit of spontaneity is partial; spontaneity arises from what is not spontaneous.\" This is precisely what is meant. Yet when the time arrives and the qi transforms, when the mechanism stirs and the elixir resonates, within spontaneity there lies the secret of refining and advancing the fire.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: \"At first, one engages in effort, which people readily notice; by the time one reaches non-doing, the multitude knows it. They see non-doing as the essential marvel, but how could they know that effort is the foundation? If a scholar, unaware that the elixir method involves effort, immediately seeks non-doing and spontaneity, how is this different from one who neither plows nor weeds yet sits waiting for a bountiful harvest?\"\n\nWhen the qi of mountains and marshes steams upward, it forms clouds and becomes rain. All know that timely rain descends from heaven, and clouds emerge from mountains and rivers, yet they do not realize that the rain in the sky is the transformed qi of mountains and marshes. For the qi of mountains and marshes steams upward into the heavens, where it transforms into clouds; thus, yin and yang harmonize and produce rain. Once formed, the rain returns to the earth. The workings of the golden elixir within our bodies differ not the slightest from this. Master Wei’s use of this analogy to instruct later learners is truly ingenious in its comparisons.\n\n\"Mud dries and turns to dust; fire extinguishes and becomes earth.\" Mud is earth near water, heavy and sluggish by nature, residing below. When exposed to the sun and dried, its earthly nature is exhausted, and it cracks, transforming into dust. Fire is an insubstantial and luminous element; when it clings to wood, it produces smoke and flame. When the smoke dissipates and the flame cools, the nature of fire is extinguished, and the embers turn to ash and earth. Only by understanding this can one discuss the Dao of yin and yang’s reversal and return.\n\n\"When coptis is dyed, it becomes yellow; when indigo is used, it turns green. Boiling hides and leather makes glue; fermenting yeast transforms into wine. Though the materials differ, the application of effort is the same—without the proper seed, skill is in vain.\"\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* states: \"A thousand efforts are in vain if not for the proper material; only true lead aligns with the sagely mechanism.\" When true mercury obtains true lead, qi and material mutually resonate, wondrously uniting and congealing—like a husband and wife finding their match, hence called \"shared material.\" When materials are the same, as with coptis dyeing yellow, indigo dyeing green, hides becoming glue, or yeast becoming wine, no effort is wasted, and truth naturally manifests. If one abandons this and seeks elsewhere, it is not the proper seed—labor is spent in vain.\n\nThis wondrous art is precise and not deceptive; its teachings have been transmitted for a hundred million generations, luminous and verifiable, shining like the stars across the Han sky, resplendent as the source of rivers and seas. Among the myriad secondary methods and minor arts in the world—numbering no less than three thousand six hundred—only this is the celestial treasure, the Great Elixir of the Ninefold Reverted Flow, the wondrous art of non-doing and purity. Its method is most simple and most easy; even the foolish man or woman, upon obtaining and practicing it, may transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. Thus, the celestial precepts are most solemn, forbidding its reckless transmission to the unworthy. Those who study it in this world, without karmic affinity and resonance, will not easily encounter it.\n\nNow, Master Wei did not conceal this celestial treasure but composed these three texts. Every word is detailed and precise, every character true and exact, shining like the stars across the Han sky, resplendent as the source of rivers and seas—truly the bright mirror for learners of immortality across a hundred million generations.\n\nThe *Zhi Xuan Pian* states: \"How many scriptures there are, each line true, transmitted only to those of lofty attainment.\" The *Wu Jie Pian* says: \"It is not that the great Dao and immortals are stingy, but that the common crowd lacks sincerity. Some believe the blind teachings of false masters and mistakenly claim that immortals deceive. Would immortals deceive? The ancient immortals left elixir texts in the world to guide later learners. Their discussions are luminous and verifiable; those who have not yet encountered them may explore them here, and those who have awakened may use them for confirmation. All who attained the Dao in antiquity did so in this manner.\"\n\nLiu Haichan said: \"Roaming freely through grottoes and palaces, I sought out all the immortal scriptures. Fortunately, I did not violate my vow and ultimately fulfilled this wish.\" Yang Xubai said: \"I traversed famous mountains and wondrous realms, visiting every constellation without fail. I delved into secret formulas and divine methods, profound and abstruse, and have long delighted in them.\" Chen Momo said: \"I perused countless texts, consulted lofty masters, and wandered like clouds and water. Reflecting on what I gained, it all aligned with the sagely teachings. There has never been one who clung to personal views without seeking the counsel of fellow Daoists, or who adhered solely to a master’s teachings without reading elixir texts.\"\n\nHow excellent is the saying of Shi Qizhen: \"The superior person of antiquity first broadly studied elixir texts, then extensively consulted fellow Daoists. When discussing the Dao, their consultations yielded no contradictions; when contemplating the Dao, their teachers were never reckless. How can later learners claim that oral instructions are not found in texts and thus neglect their study?\"\n\nIf one says, \"I possess my master’s secret transmission, whose discourse on medicinal substances and fire phases is absent from ancient and modern elixir texts and unmentioned in the *Cantong Qi*,\" then such a person is deluded.\n\nEnough! Reflect deeply, ensuring thoroughness; repeatedly examine the text, a thousand cycles above and below. After ten thousand readings, the radiance will be splendid, and the divine illumination may reveal itself. When instructing others, the heart’s spirit may suddenly awaken. Seek the thread, trace its origins, and you will surely find the gate and doorway.\n\n\"Reading a book a hundred times, its meaning becomes clear.\" If even a hundred readings suffice, how much more so a thousand or ten thousand? Thus, reciting it ten thousand times, the wondrous principle will naturally clarify. Even without receiving a master’s oral instructions, over time one will surely awaken to it. Such awakenings often occur in the deep of night or during quiet sitting. For when one concentrates the mind, savors the text deeply, and repeatedly recites it, accumulating over time, it may suddenly burst forth, and one will naturally comprehend—this is what is meant by \"the heart’s spirit suddenly awakening when instructing others.\"\n\nMaster Guanzi said: \"Think and think again, ponder deeply. If thinking does not lead to understanding, the spirit will make it clear—not by the spirit’s power, but by the extremity of sincerity.\" This saying is apt.\n\nIn recent times, Zhang Ziyang transmitted the *Awakening to Reality* to Minister Ma Chuhou of Fufeng, urging him: \"I hope you will disseminate this text, for there will be those who, upon reading it, will awaken to its intent.\" Thus, in his preface, he wrote: \"The *Awakening to Reality* exhaustively expounds the subtle principles of the great elixir’s medicinal substances and fire phases. If those of good fortune, possessing the bones of immortality, encounter it, their wisdom and discernment will naturally clarify, allowing them to seek understanding through the text.\" His earnest exhortations to later learners share the same intent as Master Wei’s—this is what is meant by \"the spirit instructs, and the heart awakens.\" After all, such a principle truly exists.",

      "translated_text": "Had this not been the case, why would these two masters have troubled themselves to compose such empty words, thereby grossly deceiving later generations? The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it is invariably transmitted to the worthy.\n\nTan Jingsheng entrusted his *Book of Transformations* to Song Qiqiu, who murdered Jingsheng and usurped the text, renaming it as his own. Soon after, he met an ignoble end—this was a transmission to the unworthy, bringing calamity to both. In contrast, Wu Shiyun transmitted the Dao to Xu Jingsun, who then received the supreme Dao from the Divine Mother Chen, and later passed it on to Wu. All of them attained the Dao and achieved perfection—this was a transmission to the worthy, bringing fortune to both. For the Dao of Heaven is impartial, ever bestowed upon the good. If the recipient is unworthy, the Dao does not flow in vain. How, then, could there be no distinction of fortune or misfortune in the transmission between the worthy and the unworthy?\n\nAlas! The ways of the world have long since declined, growing ever more degenerate. The good are no longer seen in my time; if I could but meet one of steadfast virtue, it would suffice.\n\n**Song of the Cauldron**\n\nIts circumference is three *cun* and five *fen*, its diameter one *cun*—\nThis is the great treasure-cauldron of my body.\nThe Three Powers reside within it,\nThe Five Phases revolve within it.\nLead and mercury, with earth at their center—\nThe *Yinfu Jing* says, \"Here lies the vessel from which all phenomena arise.\"\nThis is the very thing.\nAll the wondrous subtleties of the golden elixir emerge from this alone.\nTo claim it lies outside one’s body in another is not the Way of purity.\n\nThe mouth spans four and eight *cun*—\nFour *cun* and eight *fen*: the Four Images and Eight Trigrams are all contained within.\nThe two *cun* of the lips mark the boundary between the two primal forces, above and below.\n\nThe cauldron is one *chi* and two *cun* in length,\nCorresponding to the twelve months of the year and the fire phases of the celestial cycle.\nIts body and belly must be evenly proportioned, neither too thick nor too thin, lest it tilt to one side.\n\nWhen seated, align the abdomen upright, let warmth descend—\nSit with the eyes facing the nose, the nose facing the navel.\nThe body must be level and straight, not leaning or slanting.\nThe eyes should be half-veiled, not fully closed—\nFully closed, and one falls into the black mountain’s demon cave.\nThe *qi* flows through the nose, connecting the orifices;\nDo not breathe coarsely, for coarse breath stokes the fire,\nAnd when the fire blazes, the medicine scatters.\n\nYin above, yang below—\nWater and fire in mutual balance.\nThe *Huanyuan Pian* says:\n\"Fire in the Sāgara Sea,\nWaves on Kunlun Mountain—\nWho can grasp the great intent of their operation?\nOnly the Yellow Dame, in her subtlety.\"\nThe Yellow Dame’s work ensures that water moistens below and fire flames above—\nHow else could they achieve balance?\n\nThe beginning and end are martial, the middle is civil—\nThe beginning and end are the dark and new moons,\nWhen yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir—hence the martial fire.\nThe middle is the full moon,\nWhen yang reaches its peak and yin begins to stir—hence the civil fire.\nYet these terms—dark moon, new moon, full moon—are but metaphors;\nOne must not seek their meaning solely on paper.\n\nIt begins with seventy, ends with thirty, and two hundred and six—all must be harmonized.\n\"Thirty\" refers to the three decades.\nSeventy and thirty sum to one hundred, which, with two hundred and six, makes three hundred and six—\nCorresponding to the three hundred and sixty days of the annual celestial cycle.\nWhen cultivation reaches one hundred days, the sacred embryo first quickens.\nOnce quickened, for the next two hundred and sixty days,\nOne must skillfully harmonize the *qi* and fire phases,\nEnsuring the warmth never ceases—\nThen the elixir’s work naturally completes.\nThe *Cuixu Pian* says:\n\"In nurturing, be ever steadfast;\nLet the gentle wind blow constantly toward the *Kan* trigram.\nWhether walking, sitting, lying, or eating, remain thus—\nFear only that the fire grows cold and the elixir’s power lags.\nThere is no other hardship.\"\n\nYin fire is white, the yellow sprout is lead—\nFrom *zi* to *si* is the phase of yang fire;\nFrom *wu* to *hai* is the phase of yin fire.\n*You* resides in the west, and the west corresponds to metal—hence \"yin fire is white.\"\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"The toad’s light shines all day upon the Western River.\"\nLead is born from earth, silver from lead;\nWhen silver is refined from lead, it forms the yellow sprout—\nThis is true lead.\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Jing* says: \"Refine lead to seek the yellow color.\"\n\nThe two sevens gather to assist the human—\nThe two sevens are the seven lunar lodges of the Eastern Green Dragon\nAnd the seven lunar lodges of the Western White Tiger.\nThe human is the central position.\nWhen the two sevens gather to assist the human,\nIt is the coiling of the dragon and the mating of the tiger, converging at the center.\nThen, as if the suddenness of the Southern Sea met the fleetingness of the Northern Sea\nIn the land of primordial chaos—\nThis is how the elixir is refined.\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"The three families meet to form the infant,\"\nAnd again:\n\"The Five Phases must all enter the center.\"\nIs this not what it means?\n\nNourish the brain, stabilize it, and ascend to the mysterious—\nThe brain is the upper field, the palace where the original spirit resides.\nIf one can grasp the original spirit and lodge it in its proper abode,\nTrue *qi* naturally ascends, and true breath naturally stabilizes.\nThis is what is meant by:\n\"When one orifice opens, a hundred orifices all open;\nWhen the great pass is unblocked, a hundred passes all unblock.\"\nWhen forging the elixir, the embryo enters the mouth;\nAfter the work is complete, the embryo emerges from the shell—\nNeither departs from this.\nThe *Jingzhong Yin* says:\n\"I cultivate Kunlun and obtain the true formula;\nDaily I practice without cease.\nOne day, when the work is complete, no one will know—\nOn all sides, night-shining gates will appear.\"\nThis is the result of long cultivation, when the work is ample—\nNot the achievement of a single morning or evening.\n\nThe child abides in the center and is peacefully preserved—\nWhen the infant dwells within the womb, nurtured by the devoted care of the Earth Mother,\nIt is peacefully preserved.",

      "translated_text": "The *Cantong Qi* presents its outlines in broad strokes, yet it cannot maintain purity and unity. Its explanations overflow and scatter, leaving subtle details incomplete and its scope too broad, its meaning only vaguely discernible. Now, I have once more compiled and recorded this text to fill its omissions, refine its obscurities, and draw together its scattered threads so that its intent may be unified and its purpose unobstructed. Thus, I compose this again, designating the Three in Mutual Accordance. In this, the essence and nature of the *Great Change* are fully expressed: *can* refers to the Three, *tong* to their mutual accord, and *qi* to their accordance. This book borrows from the *Great Change* to expound the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and it further accords with the workings of the furnace and fire. The transformations of yin and yang in these three are nearly indistinguishable.\n\nMaster Wei pitied later students for their lack of understanding, and so he composed this single work to set forth the outlines of the Great Dao. Yet, fearing the leakage of profound secrets, he dared not fully reveal it in one continuous exposition. Instead, he resorted to indirect allusions and circuitous metaphors, allowing his explanations to overflow and scatter. Concerned that its scope was too broad and its meaning too vague to fully convey the subtleties, he appended the *Song of the Cauldron* at the end. Whatever omissions existed in the text of the main chapters, he filled in this song; whatever obscurities lay in its principles, he refined in this song. Thus, the three chapters’ words are drawn together, their intent unified, so that later readers may find a direct path without straying from its purpose.\n\nThe *Cui Xu Pian* states:\n*The essential Dao is nurtured in the midst of nothingness,\nWithin it, a true and certain core is formed.\nSimplicity and wonder hold the celestial mechanism,\nYet scattered across alchemical texts, it refuses to be revealed.*\n\nIf this is so, then why did Master Wei tirelessly expound his teachings, revisiting them again and again? His intent was no different. Otherwise, the essentials of the Great Elixir could be conveyed in a single phrase or half a sentence—why labor over such exhaustive detail?\n\nThe *Great Change* embodies the nature and essence of things, each in its proper measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi delve into their mysteries and can be applied. The workings of the furnace and fire have a true basis. These three Ways emerge from a single source, sharing the same path. The Dao is present everywhere, and every head is aligned with it. The Three Sages each followed their proper measure: the *Yi* was composed through observation, the mysteries of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi were explored to create the elixir, and the furnace and fire stole their mechanism to forge the art of refinement. Whether expressed in words, cultivated in the body, or embedded in objects, all arise from observing the heavens and examining the earth, from understanding the laws of yin and yang’s union, and from drawing upon distant principles and applying them near at hand to grasp the transformations and permutations of creation. Thus, these Three Ways exist. Though their paths differ, they converge in the same place—this is why they are called the Three in Mutual Accordance.\n\nBranches, stems, flowers, and leaves—all fruits hang and spread forth, yet their origin lies in the root. They do not lose their fundamental nature. What I have spoken here is sincere and without error. The Dao is the root of the ten thousand things, just as the root is to a tree. When it sprouts into branches and stems, the *Yi* of the Three Sages emerges. When it scatters into flowers and leaves, the techniques of the furnace and fire arise. When it ripens into fruit and returns to the root, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi do not lose their fundamental nature, refining the golden liquid and inner elixir to nurture the sacred embryo. Master Wei spoke of these three as mutually accordant, establishing them side by side—not out of a fondness for excessive solemnity, but to enable students to thoroughly comprehend yin and yang and deeply penetrate the workings of creation. His words arose from sincerity, and thus they are precise and without error.\n\nI, a rustic from the state of Kuai, a withered scholar dwelling in a secluded valley, cling to simplicity and plainness, finding no joy in power or glory. I dwell in obscurity, indifferent to profit or fame, holding fast to tranquility and contentment, seeking peace in quietude. Thus, I have composed this text.\n\nMaster Wei was born in the Eastern Han, named Boyang, styled Yun Ya Zi. He hailed from Shangyu in Guiji. Now, referring to him as from the state of Kuai is a veiled expression. He was the son of a noble family, inheriting its legacy of cap and sash, yet he alone did not serve in office. Instead, he cultivated the true, lived in quiet obscurity, nurtured his will in emptiness and nothingness, and was broadly learned in literature and the apocrypha. Serene and unadorned, he held fast to the fundamental, following only the Dao. To him, official robes and carriages were but chaff and husks.",

      "translated_text": "Though none can trace the lineage of his master’s transmission, he obtained the oral instructions of the Great Elixir. Thereupon, he distilled the *Zhouyi* to compose this *Cantong qi* in three chapters. Fearing his words might yet fall short, he further composed the *Song of the Tripod* to supplement omissions, refine obscurities, and deepen the subtleties of the three chapters. He secretly imparted it to Xu Jingxiu of Qingzhou, who, concealing his name, wrote a commentary. By the reign of Emperor Huan, it was transmitted to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery, whence it spread through the world.\n\nAlas! This book elucidates the essentials of the Dao and reveals the workings of heaven—its grasp of truth is so precise, its exposition so comprehensive. Such mastery cannot arise from mere knowledge but must spring from lived realization. Yet Master Wei still humbled himself as a rustic, a withered tree—such was the depth of his modesty.\n\nThe *Song* expounds the *Yijing*, preserving the legacy of the Three Sages. Its intent is singular, its principles unified, ever striving to align with nature, radiate spirit, and foster transformation, that harmony may flow through the four seas and peace endure as a model for ten thousand generations. It offers a sequence to govern, a path to nurture life: the golden light of inner cultivation arises naturally, virtue thickens, roots return to origin, and the Way draws near to the heart, never leaving the self. Embracing the One without abandonment ensures enduring existence. Paired with dietary arts—yin and yang in harmonious union—lead and mercury are subdued. The dual yellows are first swept away, and the remaining stones, though once prized, may all be discarded. Through careful application and refinement, they become either yellow or white, forming substances cherished by the world. The alchemical furnace is truly wondrous.\n\nFu Xi drew the eight trigrams and doubled them; King Wen arranged the hexagrams and observed their images, appending judgments; Confucius further praised them with the Ten Wings. Thus, they sought to align the principles of life and destiny, weaving the Dao of heaven and earth into a whole. Hence, as a calendar, it offers a clear path to follow, a law for all ages; as a guide to governance, its application is effortless, a model for a hundred kings. The Dao of the *Yijing* is vast indeed.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor observed the Way of heaven and mastered its workings; Laozi, thick in virtue, was likened to an unblemished child. The *Yinfu jing* in over three hundred characters and the *Daode jing* in over five thousand words—though their discussions unfold and return—all reveal the marvels of creation’s spontaneity. Thus, those who cultivate the Elixir must take the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as their foundation. Their teachings are supreme.\n\nAs for the arts of dietary ingestion, when the marvel of yin-yang harmony is achieved to subdue lead and mercury, the dual yellows are first swept away, and the remaining stones, though once prized, may all be discarded. Through careful application and refinement, they become either yellow or white, forming substances cherished by the world. The alchemical furnace is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe *Yijing*, the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—each in its own way.",

      "translated_text": "The alchemical furnace, too—three branches arrayed, stems interconnected, emerging from different names yet all through a single gate. This is called the Three Phases. Not merely an accumulation of parallel phrases or harmonious couplets, this text verily contains its truth. Were I to fabricate falsehoods, I would incur the fault of superfluity. The *Cantong qi* offers but a glimpse of its essence, its words few yet its meaning vast. Later generations ought to follow Wei Boyang, composing the *Dingqi Ge* to append to the three chapters. Its characters, bright and resplendent, gleam with clarity—how could this be mere embellishment of yellow and white, or the pairing of rhymes for aesthetic delight? Rather, it holds the most profound truth within.\n\nTo claim these are deceptive words meant to delude posterity would be something even those with slight understanding of the Dao would refuse to do. How could Wei Boyang have done so? Moreover, heaven’s judgment is luminous and clear; blessings and misfortunes are never far. Why risk deceiving later generations and the world with falsehoods, thereby incurring the sin of deceiving heaven? The *Dingqi Ge* was composed precisely to fill the omissions and illuminate the abstruse depths of the three chapters. Though its verses are but three characters long, appearing brief, their meaning is vast and all-encompassing, lacking nothing. Truly, it is plain and lucid, ready to be put into practice. If later scholars do not place their trust in this, where else shall they turn?\n\n*\"Entrust the seasons, avoid harm,\nRely on the mountains’ steadfastness,\nWander the boundless expanse,\nNeighbor to the spirits.\nTransform the form into immortality,\nSink into silence without sound.\nOnce in a hundred generations,\nRoam the human realm,\nSpreading feathered wings—\nEast and west, south and north,\nScorched by drought, beset by floods,\nWater and famine divide the land,\nBranches and leaves wither, yellow,\nLosing their splendor.\nEach bears the other’s burden—\nSecure, long life.\"*\n\nThis is Wei Boyang’s three-character hidden message:\n*\"Entrust\" (委) and \"spirits\" () bear each other—Wei (魏).\n\"Once in a hundred\" (百) is \"white\" (白), and \"white\" (白) with \"person\" (人) bear each other—Bo (伯).\n\"Scorched by drought\" (汤遭旱) leaves no water, an ordeal of \"yang\" (阳); \"beset\" (阨) is \"阝,\" and \"阝\" with \"yang\" (阳) bear each other—Yang (阳).*\nWei Boyang’s intent is most subtle indeed.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Lü Jifu, prefect of Shanzhou, encountered Lü Dongbin at Tianqing Abbey, who took up a brush and inscribed two poems. One read:\n*\"This rustic was once a guest of Tiantai,\nDwelling south of Stone Bridge.\nFather and son, just the two of us,\nLoving song but not clapping.\"*\nLü Jifu’s son-in-law, Yu Zhong, interpreted it thus: *\"Tiantai guest\" is \"guest\" (宾); \"Stone Bridge\" is \"cave\" (洞); \"two mouths\" is Lü (吕); \"loving song but not clapping\" means reciting poetry. The one reciting this poem—could it not be Lü Dongbin?*\nThus do ancient immortals speak to the world: their sole aim is to elucidate the Dao and guide later generations, never seeking to glorify their own names.\n\n**Eulogy and Preface**\nThe *Cantong qi* is crude in diction yet vast in Dao, subtle in speech yet profound in meaning. It arrays the Five Emperors to establish governance, pairing them with the Three Sovereigns to institute order. Though ruler and minister differ in rank, above and below lack fixed standards. Its precepts on governance do not attain great peace; its methods of dietary ingestion cannot confer longevity; learning to nurture nature does not extend lifespan. Yet when it dissects yin and yang, harmonizing their weights; when it aligns the waxing and waning of the sun and moon; when the Eight Trigrams form images; when male and female enact transformation; when hardness and softness, movement and stillness are distinguished like rice and salt—using the *Yijing* as its witness, its intent is most resolute.",

The alchemical furnace is truly extraordinary.\n\nThe *Yijing*, the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi—each in its own way.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, annotations were established to transmit it to later worthies—only those who comprehend the great image may attain longevity, strengthen the self, and benefit the body. For this Dao, one must devote particular attention.\n\nThis piece is titled \"Eulogy and Preface,\" being later eulogistic and prefatory words on Master Wei’s book. It is also said: \"Annotations were established to transmit it to later worthies,\" which is clearly not part of Master Wei’s original text. Zhu Xi remarked: \"Some call it a postscript, others a eulogy by Master Wei.\" Examining its content and intent, it appears to be a postscript to the annotations. Peng’s preface states: \"Master Wei secretly showed it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, instructing him to annotate it. Xu concealed his name and composed the annotations. By the time of Emperor Huan, it was again transmitted to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery, whence it circulated in the world.\" This may well be Xu’s own words, though the annotations themselves no longer survive.\n\nPeng Zhenyi said: \"According to various Daoist texts, the three chapters of the *True Contract* were each composed by Master Wei, Xu the Attendant, and Chunyu Shutong.\" This claim is gravely mistaken. Moreover, Master Wei himself states in this text: \"Now I have again compiled and supplemented omissions.\" Thus, it is evident that the work was composed by Master Wei alone. Furthermore, Liu Zhigu, the Tang dynasty Perfected One of Shu, in his *Discourse on the Mysterious Pivot of Sun and Moon*, presented to the Mysterious Lineage, also thoroughly addressed this. The accounts of Xu’s annotations and Chunyu’s transmission thus raise no further doubts.\n\nI have repeatedly pondered this matter, sighing that the ages are too distant to verify what is true or false—all remains unknowable. One evening, in a state of quiescent concentration, it was as if someone whispered in my ear: \"Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong qi*, while Xu the Attendant annotated it. The bamboo slips were disordered, hence the mixture of four-character and five-character lines, as well as prose.\" Startled awake, I reflected on this explanation. The upper chapter contains \"Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Zhun, Meng\"; the middle chapter repeats \"Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Zhun, Meng.\" The upper chapter has \"seven, eight, nine, six\"; the middle chapter repeats \"seven, eight, nine, six.\" The upper chapter states, \"The solar terms set the measure\"; the middle chapter says, \"Carefully observe the solar terms.\" The upper chapter reads, \"Zhen receives geng in the west\"; the middle chapter reads, \"Above Mao and Bi, Zhen emerges as zheng.\" Between them, \"wu-ji\" and \"hun-tun\" appear thrice, \"three-five\" and \"dark-moon, new-moon\" appear four times. With such repetition in meaning, the claim that three individuals each composed one chapter may not be entirely baseless. Yet with text and annotations intermingled, it remains unclear which is the original and which the commentary.\n\nI wished to separate the four-character lines, five-character lines, and prose into three distinct sections, so that text and annotations would not be confused, thereby aiding later scholars in their study. However, once the book was completed, it could not be altered. Thus, I record here what I have heard, appending it to the end of the scroll, awaiting the discernment of future sages.\n\n*Elucidations on the Zhouyi Cantong qi*, Scroll Three\n<*Zi* Section, Daoist Category, *Elucidations on the Zhouyi Cantong qi*>\n*Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Resolving Doubts on the Zhouyi Cantong qi Elucidations*\nBy Yu Yan of the Song Dynasty, Upper Chapter",

The axle lies within the hub to penetrate its spokes, yet it also extends beyond the hub to converge with it. One edition mistakenly renders *zhou* (轴, axle) as *fu* (辐, spoke).\n\nThe \"four trigrams of the female and male\" recapitulate the preceding line—\"Qian and Kun as gateways, Kan and Li as the enclosing frame\"—summarizing these four trigrams. They represent the cauldron, the vessel, and the medicinal substances; the subsequent \"sixty trigrams\" denote the firing times. As the middle chapter states, \"These four are the primordial chaos,\" echoing the earlier line, \"Qian’s firmness and Kun’s yielding, Kan and Li at the forefront.\" Later, it says, \"The sixty trigrams are deployed as a chariot,\" completing the sixty-four trigrams—all of which serve the Dao of our elixir.

Earlier scholars, following the error, annotated it as \"like a craftsman adhering to the inked cord and compass, or a charioteer following the bit and tracks,\" which is mistaken.\n\n\"Combined to make sixty\" means that two trigrams are used daily, and in a month of thirty days, they combine to form sixty trigrams.

      "translated_text": "Having not yet reached *mei-shuang* refers to the passage below concerning \"from the last day of the lunar month to the dawn of the new moon.\" One edition mistakenly renders *mei* (昧) as *hui* (晦). The reason is that *ji-wei* (既未) denotes the last day of the lunar month, while *mei-shuang* (昧爽) denotes the first day of the new moon. If interpreted as \"from *ji-wei* to *hui-shuang*,\" it would mean \"from the last day of the month to the last dawn of the month,\" which is a gross error in textual meaning.\n\nIn spring and summer, one relies on the inner body, proceeding from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; in autumn and winter, one accords with external application, from *wu* through *xu* and *hai*. This is because when speaking of two trigrams together, the first pertains to spring and summer, from *zi* to *si*, where yang ascends from below; the latter pertains to autumn and winter, from *wu* to *hai*, where yin descends from above. If speaking of only one trigram, a single trigram has but six lines, and when matched with the twelve hours, it falls short by half. Thus, in daily practice, two trigrams must be spoken of together.\n\n\"Attaining its sequence\": one edition mistakenly renders *xu* (序, sequence) as *li* (理, principle).\n\n\"Transformations within\": Zhu Xi’s annotated edition renders *bianhua* (变化) as *shengjiang* (升降, ascent and descent). Another edition reads, \"ascent and descent, transformations within.\"\n\n\"Enveloping\": This adopts the language of the *Wenzi* and *Tongxuan Zhenjing*. An older edition incorrectly reads *baonang* (包囊, wrapping).\n\n\"Using the formless to regulate the formed\" refers to the *zhi* (制) of creation, not the *zhi* of control. The method of the Great Elixir creates existence from non-existence, hence \"using the formless to regulate the formed.\" Some explain it as the *zhi* of control, elucidating that the formless is spirit, mercury, or *li*, while the formed is qi, lead, or *kan*—this is but one interpretation, yet it does not align with Master Wei’s original intent. I have repeatedly examined this and found that, owing to the *Longhu Jing*’s statement of \"mutual regulation of being and non-being, the Vermilion Bird blazing in the void,\" later scholars, without scrutinizing the context, invariably interpret *zhi* as the *zhi* of creation rather than control.\n\nAgain, in the middle chapter, it states, \"The firm and yielding are decided,\" meaning the firm and yielding do not encroach upon one another. Thus, it continues, \"The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting,\" which differs from the later chapter’s meaning of \"the firm and yielding parting ways.\" Some, clinging to the *Longhu Jing*’s statement of \"the firm and yielding contending in balance without encroachment, the blame does not lie with fire but with the censure of earth,\" mistakenly apply the meaning of \"the firm and yielding parting ways\" here. Today, it is commonly held that Wei Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi* based on the *Longhu Jing*, and thus could not but follow its doctrines. Yet they do not realize that the *Longhu Jing* merely paraphrases the *Cantong Qi* and was actually written after Master Wei’s work. Zhu Xi remarked, \"Later scholars, seeing that Wei Boyang’s transmission included a *Longhu Shangjing*, fabricated this text, generally modeling it on the *Cantong Qi*, though with some misinterpretations.\" I once, not having grasped this, dared not readily accept Zhu Xi’s view. Later, upon repeated reflection and comparative study of the *Cantong Qi*, I came to see the inconsistencies in the *Longhu Jing* and realized it truly was a paraphrase of the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nMaster Wei’s composition of the *Cantong Qi* borrows the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to elucidate the secrets of elixir-making, not to expound upon the *Longhu Jing*. Had he indeed expanded upon the *Longhu Jing*, it should have been called the *Longhu Cantong Qi*, not the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nNevertheless, the *Longhu Jing* is also a fine text. Cai Jitong deeply admired its words, such as, \"The Primordial Sovereign first refines mercury; the spirit chamber embraces emptiness,\" and, \"The essentials of spontaneity: first preserve, then let go\"—truly profound insights. Yet it is not a work predating Master Wei.\n\n\"Implements and vessels\": Li Baosu’s annotated edition reads *zhe* (者, those) as *jie* (皆, all). \"As evidence\": one edition mistakenly renders *zheng* (征) as *zheng* (证).",
      "overlap_context": "andards,\" but this is incorrect.

Similarly, \"九六亦相当\" was suspected of repeating \"刚柔相当\" and thus \"当\" was changed to \"应,\" both incorrect.\n\n\"日月无双明\" means that when the sun rises, the moon sets, and when the moon rises, the sun sets—day and night alternate in their illumination. One edition mistakenly renders \"无\" as \",\" but in ancient texts, \"无\" was used where modern texts use \"無,\" as in the *Yijing*’s \"无妄无咎.\" Another version reads \"焕炳而成双.\"\n\n\"兔者吐生光\" appears as \"兔魄吐精光\" in one edition and \"兔魄吐生光\" in another. \"东方丧其明\" was miswritten as \"东北丧其明\" in an old edition, likely due to the *Yijing*’s phrase \"东北丧朋,\" perpetuating the error through unexamined habit.\n\nExamining the *Yijing*’s *Kun* hexagram: \"西南得朋, 东北丧朋\" refers to the southwest, where *Dui* (west) and *Li* (south) are yin hexagrams, and *Xun* is also yin—thus \"得朋\" (gaining companions). The northeast, however, contains *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Qian*, all yang hexagrams—hence \"丧朋\" (losing companions). Yet Master Wei’s statement, \"坤乙三十日东方丧其明,\" refers to the thirtieth day’s dawn, when the moon sets in the east at the *yi* position, not to the *Kun* hexagram’s \"东北丧朋.\" How is this clarified?\n\nThe western regions *geng* and *xin*, the southern *bing* and *ding*, and the eastern *jia* and *yi* are the six nodes within a month where the moon appears at dusk and sets at dawn—what Wang Baoyi called the \"three shifts of the moon.\" On the third day, the moon appears at dusk in the west at *geng*; by the sixteenth, it sets at dawn in the west at *xin*. On the eighth day, it appears at dusk in the south at *ding*; by the twenty-third, it sets at dawn in the south at *bing*. On the fifteenth day, it appears at dusk in the east at *jia*; by the thirtieth, it sets at dawn in the east at *yi*. The principle is thus evident—how could *yi* be in the northeast?\n\nSince ancient times, *jia* and *yi* have both been placed in the east, not the northeast. If *yi* were in the northeast, why not also call the fifteenth day, when the celestial stems are full, \"盛满甲东北\"? *Jia* is closer to the northeast yet is not called so—how much less *yi*, which precedes *jia* and leans toward the southeast? Clearly, it is not in the northeast.\n\n\"九六亦相当\" was explained above under \"复卦建始初.\" \"易象索灭藏\" refers to the thirtieth night, when the symbols of the sun and moon both sink into the north. One edition mistakenly renders \"易象\" as \"阳.\"\n\n\"象彼仲冬节至以晓后生\" was misplaced in the postscript of an old edition. Chen Baoyi moved it before \"子当右转,\" both incorrect. This passage rhymes with two \"伤\" sounds and, when connected to the earlier \"易象索灭藏,\" also rhymes with two \"藏\" sounds. Ancient writers often used repeated rhymes, but later readers, not understanding this, recklessly altered the text, disrupting its coherence. Examples include \"关睢建始初\" with \"复卦建始初\" and \"刚柔相当\" with \"九六亦相当\"—all repeated rhymes.

Another interpretation holds that when advancing yang fire, *zi* (子), *chou* (丑), and *yin* (寅) form the head, while *chen* (辰) and *si* (巳) form the tail; when retreating yin符, *wu* (午), *wei* (未), and *shen* (申) form the head, while *xu* (戌) and *hai* (亥) form the tail, with the central palace as the center—thus two heads, two tails, and one center. Neither interpretation is sound.\n\n*Two sevens gather*—one edition reads *gather* as *orifice* (窍), which is incorrect.\n*Examining the brain’s principles*—one edition reads *examining* (赡) as *gazing* (瞻), another as *gallbladder* (胆), both incorrect.\n\n**Preface**\nThe *Three Correlations* (三相䚸) refer to the mutual resemblance in yin-yang transformation among the *Great Change* (易), the *Yellow and Lao* (黄老), and furnace fire. Since Peng Zhenyi depicted the five phases with wood as three, fire as two, earth as five, metal as four, and water as one—forming a diagram of *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony*—later generations all followed Peng’s interpretation, mistakenly attributing it to Wei Boyang’s original text and conflating it with the *correlation of the five phases* (五行之相䚸). This error has persisted to this day without correction. Yet none have considered what Wei Boyang truly meant by *correlation*. Moreover, the *Change*’s *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony* refers to the harmonization of the five phases’ generating and completing numbers. Peng’s system uses only the generating numbers—how can this be called *five positions mutually attuned, each with its harmony*? Some argue that wood as three and fire as two form one five, metal as four and water as one form another five, with central earth as five completing three fives—this might still be called *three fives correlated* (三五相䚸). But to speak of the *correlation of the five phases* (五行之相䚸) is untenable, for water is one, fire is two, and the numbers of metal, wood, and earth each differ—how can they be correlated? One edition reads *mutually correlated* (互相䚸), which is somewhat plausible, though far less clear than the *Three Correlations*.\n\nExamining the subsequent text, it states: *\"The Three Ways emerge from the One, sharing the same path\"* and *\"Arrayed as three branches, stems interconnected, differing in name yet issuing from one gate\"*—the meaning of *Three Correlations* is thus unmistakably evident.\n\n*Guo of Kuai*—Wei Boyang’s self-reference. Wei was from Shangyu in Guiji; by calling it *Guo of Kuai* instead of Guiji, he avoided revealing his native place. To read it directly as Guiji would be a later emendation, not Wei’s original wording.\n\n*Embracing simplicity*—one edition reads *embracing simplicity and holding purity* (怀朴抱素).\n*Unfond of power and glory*—meaning he refused to delight in power and glory. *Delight* (乐) should be read in the departing tone; one edition reads *power* (权) as *joy* (欢), which is incorrect.\n*Profit and fame*—one edition reads *profit* (利) as *command* (令).\n*Leisurely dwelling in seclusion*—one edition reads *distant traveler in leisure* (远客燕闲).\n*Observing his inclinations*—one edition reads *inclinations* (所) as *purport* (旨).\n*Shared principles*—one edition reads *principles* (伦) as *discourse* (论).\n*Disseminating transformation*—one edition reads *disseminating* (施) as *spiritual* (神).\n*Returning to the root*—one edition reads *root* (根) as *foolish* (愚), which is incorrect.\n*My heart*—one edition reads *heart* (心) as *form* (形).\n*Eight minerals*—one edition reads *eight* (八) as *five* (五).\n*Perfecting things*—one edition reads *things* (物) as *achievement* (功).",

      "translated_text": "The text \"Committing to the times, departing from harm, relying on hills and mountains, roaming the vast expanse, neighboring with spirits\" through \"securely attaining long life\"—these sixteen phrases encapsulate the three characters of Wei Boyang. \"Each mutually bearing\" refers to: *committing to spirits* mutually bearing forms *Wei*; *people* and *white* mutually bearing forms *Bo*; *阝* and *sun* mutually bearing forms *Yang*. One edition reads *spirits* (鬼) as *immortals* (仙), *narrow pass* (阨) as *calamity* (厄). \"Each mutually bearing, securely attaining long life\" is rendered as \"Auspicious people mutually bearing, peacefully attaining long life.\" Another edition reads: \"Auspicious people mutually bearing, securely attaining long life.\" Both are incorrect.
