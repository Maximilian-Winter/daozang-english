  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Past Karmic Origins of Fundamental Conduct**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Past Karmic Origins of Fundamental Conduct*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient* **Numinous Treasure Scriptures** *(Lingbao Jing)*. Collected in the *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, **Great Peace Section**.\n\n---\n\nThe Immortal Duke inquired of the Supreme Pole Perfected One, the Lofty Dharma Master, saying: \"By cultivating what fundamental conduct may one, in this present life, receive blessings, ensure the uprightness of their household, the prosperity of their descendants, and favorable karmic connections unbroken across generations? After death, may they ascend to the heavenly halls or descend to be reborn in the families of marquises and kings among humankind, endowed with wisdom, erudition, benevolence, and reverence for scriptural teachings? May they delight in mountains and forests, constantly reciting subtle words, and ultimately attain the Dao of immortality?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"Excellent is your question! All beings are born with their own fundamental conduct, past karmic roots, and destinies. Various causes interweave, wishes follow one another, like attracts like, and cycles of rebirth unfold, with fortune and misfortune drawing each other forth. Thus, across generations, their inclinations differ, their aspirations vary—all according to their prior vows.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao and forge karmic bonds with the worthy and sagely, one must uphold the great precepts, broadly establish fields of merit, and magnanimously bestow virtue and power. Thereby, one may attain:\n- Flight as an immortal;\n- Ascension as a celestial immortal;\n- Abiding as an earthbound immortal;\n- Transcending life to ascend to the heavenly halls;\n- Becoming a spirit or deity;\n- Serving as an official under the Six Heavenly Great Demon Kings;\n- Transcending life to be reborn directly into the families of marquises and kings, the most honored among humankind;\n- Becoming one upon whom all rely, possessing wealth across the world;\n- Gaining talent and wisdom, keen intelligence;\n- Acquiring a dignified appearance, radiant countenance, and pure, fragrant *qi*;\n- Cultivating benevolence, filial piety, loyalty, chastity, and simplicity;\n- Excelling in literary arts, their conduct serving as a model in motion and stillness;\n- Commanding awe and reverence, admired by all;\n- Devotedly honoring the Three Treasures, their offerings ever diligent;\n- Delighting in mountains and rivers, practicing purity, reciting scriptures, burning incense, and observing fasts;\n- Reverently worshiping the Mysterious Tradition;\n- Transforming from female to male, with a radiant and refined appearance;\n- Ensuring the solemn purity of their household, their karmic connections across generations aligning with their original vows, their descendants virtuous and talented, endlessly secure and noble;\n- Receiving blessings in this present life, their rewards manifesting at life’s end;\n- Or inheriting blessings in future lives, reaping the merits of their past deeds.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is responding without contrivance. The four classes of beings who cultivate merit and virtue must have their original vows. The retribution of blessings arises from the vows one establishes in due time. Once meritorious deeds are performed and aspirations are set, their rewards shall be vast—like awaiting dawn after dusk.\n\nYet the people of the world are deceitful and shallow, disbelieving the Dharma’s words. Each claims cunning, following their own whims, dismissing past karma as fabrication. They ridicule the supreme scriptures as false and absurd, while glutting themselves on desires, sitting idly to await immediate retribution, expecting swift and leisurely responses. Thus, the Mysterious Teachings grow dim, the world’s Dao declines, and heaven and humanity suffer—all due to their own conduct. This is why the Supreme One grieves deeply.\"\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: \"I have heard of past karmic causes, the retributions of life and death. What, then, should be the fundamental conduct and supreme precepts?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"The *Supreme Wisdom Precepts of the Supreme One* and the *One Hundred and Eighty Precepts* are all supreme preceptual laws. By upholding the *Ten Precepts of the Supreme One*, one may also attain these blessings. Now, shall I expound them for you? Would you not wish to uphold them?\"\n\nThe Immortal Duke withdrew from his seat, bowed deeply, and said: \"Indeed, indeed! May the Heavenly Worthy deign to transmit them, and I shall uphold them accordingly.\"\n\nThe Dharma Master said: \"The Ten Precepts are as follows:\n1. Do not envy those superior to yourself or suppress the worthy and wise.\n2. Do not consume alcohol or meat, defiling the Three Palaces.\n3. Do not commit adultery with others’ wives or daughters, indulging in lewdness and deceit.\n4. Do not abandon or despise the elderly, sick, impoverished, or lowly.\n5. Do not slander the virtuous or attack fellow disciples.\n6. Do not greedily accumulate wealth and treasures, refusing to bestow or disperse them.\n7. Do not kill living beings or sacrifice to the ghosts and gods of the Six Heavens.\n8. Do not arbitrarily discuss scriptures, dismissing them as false and absurd.\n9. Do not betray the kindness of your teacher or deceive new disciples.\n10. Maintain equanimity and wholeheartedness, practicing benevolence and filial piety toward all.\n\nBy upholding these Ten Precepts and clearly establishing your vows, there is nothing that will not be repaid.\n\nIf one sees another commit evil in this life yet go unpunished, it is because their residual blessings from past lives have not yet been exhausted; once exhausted, misfortune will arrive. If one sees another perform good deeds yet go unrewarded, it is because their residual calamities from past lives have not yet been exhausted; once exhausted, blessings will arrive. Or they may receive retribution in future lives, not necessarily in this one.\n\nIf one greatly establishes good deeds in this life, their merits and transgressions may offset each other, thereby avoiding the calamities of past lives. To bestow kindness in expectation of repayment is not to be repaid—this is the inevitable principle of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nFor those who wish to enter the Dao of immortality, their merits must be as numerous as the grains of dust and sand—only then may they be deemed fitting.\n\nThe Ten Evils must not be violated:\n1. Indulging in alcohol, lust, and insatiable desires.\n2. Secretly harming the world and slandering Daoists.\n3. Disrespecting teachers, neglecting the Dharma, and arrogantly disregarding the Three Treasures.\n4. Stealing scriptures, recklessly propagating the essentials of the Dao.\n5. Borrowing and not returning, deceiving the common people.\n6. Killing living beings for taste, speaking falsely while harboring deceit.\n7. Betraying kindness and violating righteousness, transgressing all prohibitions and precepts.\n8. Reciting scriptures carelessly, mumbling and grumbling, self-righteous.\n9. Demanding others meet your expectations, harboring anger toward the four classes.\n10. Arbitrarily interpreting scriptural meanings, altering or diminishing sacred texts, disbelieving in past karma, indulging in selfish desires, defiling the Four Great Elements, and neglecting the path of life.\n\nThese are the Ten Evil Precepts. Those who violate them may be wrongfully killed by spirits, examined and punished by officials of the *yang* realm, or find safety turning to danger, good fortune meeting misfortune—no endeavor shall succeed.\"\n\nOr they may die and enter hell, confined in dark, heavy cages, never beholding the Three Lights. Day and night, they endure torment—embracing bronze pillars, treading blade mountains, climbing sword trees, plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid, swallowing flames and smoke, facing freezing ice, experiencing the full measure of the Five Sufferings. Once their hellish sentence is complete, they are conscripted as laborers for the Three Offices, exiled to mountains and seas, whipped and beaten without end. After this, they descend into the world as lowly beings, often reduced to servitude, possessing human form but lacking human sentiment. Some are born among barbarian tribes in distant lands, others afflicted with chronic illness. Evil begets evil, good begets good—such karmic retribution defies full description. The recompense of sin and merit is as certain as the sun and moon casting their light, as the rivers flowing to the great sea. The appointed hour arrives without fail.\n\nThe extinction of sin and merit is like a shadow following form, their cyclic opposition like the turning of a wheel. Thereupon, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate composed a hymn of admonition, saying:\n\nThe Dao takes non-action as its essence,\nAll things become fields of merit.\nEstablishing merit has no fixed master,\nEach vow arises from the person.\nEmpty the self to respond to all beings,\nFocus the mind without partiality.\nThe Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,\nAs rain nourishes the heavens.\nHigh peaks are universally embraced,\nWhile the humble form deep abysses.\nThe sea is king of a hundred rivers,\nFor it can forsake even dragon scales.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, its restraint endures,\nNot merely for a single lifetime.\nUphold the precepts without pause,\nLifetimes of good karma will follow.\nWith concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,\nAnd you shall embody the true Dao.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate then composed a hymn of transgression, saying:\n\nHuman roots stem from past vows,\nVows determine the overcoming of great afflictions.\nWith pure intent, uphold the Ten Precepts,\nAnd thus transcend the Eight Difficulties.\nIf in past lives one violated the mysterious teaching,\nHow can one find peace in this life?\nThe foolish and blind neglect their nature and destiny,\nOnly sighing when punishment arrives.\nRetribution comes as swiftly as echo follows sound,\nGazing upon it chills the heart.\nBorn into lowly stations,\nGrieving without respite.\nThe Immortal Duke dared to ask: \"The depth of fasting, the height of merit—how do the cycles of the Ten Evils and Ten Goods revolve without cease? When virtue deepens and merit is perfected, one enters quiescent emptiness. By what stages does this come about?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"All things, in their myriad forms, must ultimately be emptied. Being and non-being intermingle. Cultivate virtue, nourish the spirit, accumulate merit, and condense the true. Then the true body becomes empty, moving between existence and non-existence, concealed in the most wondrous quiescence. Preserve the subtle and imperceptible, deliver all beings, and become a bridge for the multitude of dharmas. In the turning wheel of Daoist practice, nothing precedes fasting. Among fasts, none surpasses the *Lingbao*. Its method is lofty and wondrous, not to be proclaimed to the common worldly folk. It is always transmitted to those who possess merit from past lives. Without prior karmic affinity, one is not permitted to behold it—even if encountered, it will not be favored. All arises from past vows, and thus it cannot be forcibly taught. For ten thousand kalpas, the oral instructions of immortals and sages have been transmitted in secret, never committed to writing. By the command of the Most High, I have bestowed this upon the son of the Immortal Duke. Record it well. This method benefits all who seek the Dao. Though kalpas turn and cycles revolve, this scripture remains unchanged. When the Dao flourishes in the world, virtue rises with transformation. Sages are rare to encounter, the Dao is rare to behold, scriptures are rare to hear, sagely ages are rare to witness, and worthy persons are rare to meet. Thus, only those with good merit may partake in this assembly.\n\nThe Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, when first learning the Dao, received the *Lingbao* fast. After attaining the Dao, he declared this fast to be most venerable and composed the *Five Invocations of the Lingbao*, from which the fasting method was extracted to form the *Scripture of Essential Teachings*. Though it differs in minor details, it follows the same fundamental fasting method as this scripture. The fasting method of the Great Unity is the most profound within this great fast, serving as the initial step for beginners of the Lesser Vehicle.\n\nThose who follow the mysterious scriptures of the Three Caverns are called adepts of the Great Vehicle. They first deliver others before delivering themselves. Whether sitting, rising, lying down, or at rest, they constantly maintain a compassionate heart toward all, tirelessly engaging in spiritual practice. Their virtue equals that of the Most High, their Dao transcends the August Emperor of the Void. Their kindness fills the ten directions, harmonizing with the mysterious and true. They guide the myriad heavens, their vows reaching the origin of the Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao must always keep their clothing pure, set apart a quiet space for burning incense, place high-quality incense, and arrange the scriptures with reverence. They bow in devotion, concentrate their thoughts, visualize the true, practice breath control and nurturing exercises, repent for the sins of seven generations of parents, as well as for heavy karmic transgressions from past and present lives. They give alms, establish merit, maintain long fasts in seclusion, and stabilize their original vows. Only when the mind is empty and the intent profound can the true Dao be attained.\n\nPrepare properly the hempen robe, single-layered skirt, and scripture-covering cloth according to the regulations. Do not casually lend them to others or wear them in unclean places. These are called *Dharma robes*, and three divine youths always attend them. Once, a worthy man invited a Daoist, who could not go immediately and thus wore his hempen robe to the appointment. Upon arriving at the man’s home, the host reverently burned incense and paid homage as if the Daoist himself had come. The divine youths appeared in visible form, saying: \"The Daoist sent us.\" The host at that time did not know they were divine youths. The sick in the household were immediately cured, and the family remained free from misfortune. The divine youths said to the host: \"The sick have recovered. The Daoist need not trouble himself to come again. You may return the Dharma robe to him.\" The host did as instructed and sent it back. The Daoist questioned him, and the host replied: \"For a day, we suffered illness and invited you to perform a fast. You were occupied with many matters and only sent immortals—you did not come yourself. Now the sick have recovered, so I return the Dharma robe.\" The Daoist was astonished and listened in awe. After the host finished speaking, the Daoist replied: \"This humble one was occupied with ritual preparations all day and intended to go. The host permitted the worthy man to leave and did not send for me again. Thus, I did not go—not out of betrayal, nor was there anyone to send. Moreover, I did not know the illness in your household had been cured. This must have been achieved by the host’s utmost sincerity.\"\n\nThe Daoist asked, \"What did the person who came look like?\" The host replied, \"He appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years old, with a refined and upright bearing, like a scholar.\" The Daoist pondered, \"None of my disciples resemble this. It must have been a divine being who descended.\" He continued, \"Thus, the Dharma robe must be kept pure and clean, crafted according to proper methods. If not, ghosts may harm people, for its majesty and prohibitions are as strict as the luminous statutes. If it becomes worn and tattered, you must wear it yourself and may not use it for other purposes.\"\n\nThe Immortal Lord said, \"I have now witnessed the divine power of the Dharma robe. May I ask about the Ten Precepts—can I receive and uphold them?\" The Perfected One replied, \"I once received them from the Most High Lord of the Great Dao. I have observed them faithfully, forming good affinities with the virtuous life after life, dwelling in blessings and attaining the Dao of immortality. Now I transmit them to you, mindful of our lineage. In the past, an ordinary person who upheld these precepts and maintained unwavering devotion to the Dao extended their lifespan, increased their years, and brought prosperity to their family. May you, in your future lives, study deeply, grow in wisdom and understanding of the scriptures, and ultimately enter the Dao of immortality. On the day of your liberation, you will ascend directly to the Hall of Blessings, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and joy and contentment abound. In your next descent into the world, you will study the great Daoist scriptures, gaining profound insight and becoming a master of the age, with nothing left unenlightened.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed great meritorious deeds, held fasts, observed precepts, lit lamps, and made offerings to the Three Treasures with unwavering diligence. They wished to be born into the household of a marquis or king, becoming a person of nobility with a dignified and imposing appearance. When their life ended, flying immortals welcomed them, and they ascended directly to the Heavenly Hall, where clothing and sustenance arose naturally, and joy was boundless. In their next life, they were born into the family of a marquis or king, becoming the child of a noble, endowed with wisdom, intelligence, a refined appearance, and a fragrant, radiant qi.\n\nThere was also a noble who governed with the Dao, performed good deeds, held fasts with sincerity, practiced generosity, lit lamps, repented of sins, and resolved the karmic entanglements of seven generations of parents, making offerings to the Three Treasures. They wished that in their next life, they would again be born as a noble, perpetuating their blessed affinities, with a radiant and joyful appearance, keen insight, and the constant company of the wise and enlightened, continuing to make offerings to the Three Treasures. When their life ended, flying immortals welcomed them, and they ascended directly to the Hall of Blessings, where indescribable joy prevailed. In their next life, they were born into the household of a king, their wealth and nobility surpassing their former existence, their wisdom and bearing refined and transcendent, bringing abundance to the people and peace to their household.\n\nThere was also a noble who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing that in their next life, they would ultimately enter the Dao of immortality. In their subsequent life, they indeed developed a love for the Dao, studied the scriptures, and, having mastered all texts, ascended as an immortal, soaring through the sky in broad daylight.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing that in their next life, they would always encounter the great scriptures of the Three Caverns. In their next life, they indeed beheld the great scriptures, received and recited them, and were revered throughout the Three Realms.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to become a learned Daoist priest well-versed in the scriptures. In their next life, they indeed became a Daoist priest, deeply studying the scriptures and becoming a master for the multitude.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to enter the mountains to study the Dao. In their next life, they dwelled by cliffs in the mountains, cultivating their thoughts and devoting themselves to the Dao.\n\nThere was also a woman who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to be reborn as a man. In her next life, she was indeed born as a male.\n\nThere was also a worthy person who performed such meritorious deeds, assisting the Dharma master in compiling scriptures, wishing that in their next life, they would encounter the Dao of the scriptures, just as they had hoped.\n\nThere was also a worthy person who performed such meritorious deeds, reciting scriptures, holding fasts, making offerings to the Three Treasures, and devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao. They wished to repay the karmic kindness of seven generations of parents, ascend to the Heavenly Hall, and be reborn into the household of a marquis or king in the human realm. They themselves would ascend as immortals, abiding in eternal tranquility.\n\nI have observed that those who practice generosity and cultivate the Dao never fail to attain what they seek, provided their aspirations are sincere. Once a wish is firmly established, it will surely be fulfilled. The fulfillment is like the echo responding to sound or the seasons following their course. However, sins and blessings are not repaid simultaneously; their outcomes differ in sequence, with merits and transgressions shifting. Some rewards or retributions manifest in future lives, others in the present. Sins and blessings arise from one’s own conduct and habits, not from the idle speculations of the Dao and virtue. Yet people all desire immediate verification of karmic retribution, and when it is deferred to future lives, they dismiss it as ineffectual. Foolish individuals, emboldened by this, indulge their desires to the extreme, disregarding the celestial net, and thus encounter the eight difficulties and tread upon the ten sufferings. At such times, they do not understand the cause. Is this not lamentable? Is this not lamentable?\n\nThe human body is a temporary assemblage, arising from qi. When qi disperses, the person dies, the spirit and the true depart, and the body dissolves, becoming worms and dust, transforming into all manner of ghosts who endure bitter torments, far removed from their former existence. Is this not sorrowful? Is this not sorrowful? Only by attaining the Dao and embodying the true can one’s real form remain eternally secure. The path to attaining the Dao lies in accumulating virtue, performing good deeds, refining the body, and cultivating the spirit, thereby achieving the true form.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who, seeing Daoist priests in silent fasts, lighting lamps, burning incense, and performing reverent circumambulations, was moved to develop a heart for the Dao and wished to make offerings to the Three Treasures. Though their household was poor and they had no fine delicacies, they offered a few stalks of vegetables to support the midday meal. At that moment, they thought, \"May I in my next life be wealthy and able to make grand offerings to the Three Treasures, widely sowing the fields of blessings.\" Later, they lived in peace and security, fulfilling their heavenly allotted lifespan. When the day of their death arrived and they were to enter hell to face judgment, the Most High issued a decree: though this person had minor transgressions, their diligent and earnest efforts had compensated for their faults. Thus, they were allowed to ascend to the Hall of Blessings. In their next life, they were born into a noble household, becoming a young master of generation after generation, with natural blessings and prosperity, delighting in the Dao and virtue, making offerings to the Three Treasures, and possessing profound wisdom and insight.\n\nThere was also a person who, seeing a Perfected One or Daoist priest in silent fast, reciting scriptures, laughed and said, \"They chant empty scriptures in vain—what do they hope to gain? Fasting with an empty stomach, eating but once a day—such people are sinners!\" The Daoist priest, with a compassionate heart, sought to enlighten them, but their stubbornness remained unshaken. After this person died, they descended directly into hell, where they endured the full measure of the five sufferings, and the hell wardens reproached them, listing their offenses: \"In life, you mocked Daoist priests and slandered the Three Treasures. Now you face this retribution.\" In their next life, they were born as a lowly, impoverished, and wretched commoner.\n\nAgain there was a person of upright bearing and refined appearance, versed in worldly classics, who, upon encountering Daoist scriptures and their profound and distant teachings, remarked, \"These seem but the empty and delusional words of ancients. What do I seek in understanding Daoist priests and the wise and noble? To indulge in such things all day—what could one possibly hope to gain?\" This person was soon killed by malevolent spirits in the world, their heavenly mandate cut short in violent death. After dying, they descended into hell, enduring every torment, and in their next life were born dull-witted, outside the bounds of human relations.\n\nThere were also Daoist priests who treated the Dharma lightly, recklessly divulging and profaning sacred scriptures. In life, they were slain by the spirits of the dead, sinking into the depths of hell, and in their next life suffered from karmic illnesses—agonies beyond description.\n\nThus, scriptures must not be carelessly disclosed, lest those who cannot treasure and employ them bring guilt upon both themselves and others. To be a teacher is no easy task; if one instructs disciples improperly, the sin extends to all involved. Human hearts are inscrutable, none free from stinginess and greed. Therefore, the sages bequeathed the Dharma, validating it through its own efficacy. Sage transmitted to sage without need for words of trust; fool transmitted to fool, and without trust, the transmission was incomplete. How could you not be cautious?\n\nIn learning the Dao, one must first cultivate loyalty and filial piety, uphold precepts with virtuous conduct, extend compassion to all, serve one’s teacher with reverence and solemnity, practice breath cultivation to nourish the spirit, honor and receive the great scriptures, venerate Dharma masters as one would a sage, recite scriptures in purity and stillness, relieve those in distress, and exhort others toward goodness. Only then may one ingest elixirs to gain benefit, harmonize the spirit through breathwork, perceive responses from fasting and precepts, and invoke the true descent of scriptures. Demonic hordes will submit and serve, daring not to test or harm—thus one is certain to attain the Dao.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Virtue*, both upper and lower, along with the *Dongzhen* and *Dongxuan* scriptures, the *Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Writ*, and the various odes of the *Shangqing* corpus—all were composed by the Most High, the Void Emperor, the Perfected of the Myriad Realms, the natural true immortals of the ten directions, the hidden ranks of the Thearch Lords, and the great sages of the celestial palaces, towers, cities, and terraces across the heavens. They describe the pools and mountains of the seas, the numinous observatories of the Most High, the jeweled gates of the natural realms, the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens, the inscriptions upon city walls and gates, or the secret names and hidden characters within the domains of the great demon kings, the locations of their palaces—all were arranged into texts by the Most High. Thus, they must not be slandered or recklessly divulged.\n\nIf, during purificatory rites, one focuses the mind upon the mysterious and true, reciting even a few lines of scripture, then one’s words will resonate like blossoms answering in echo. At that moment, the Most High, the Jade Capital, the Mysterious Metropolis, the sages and Perfected of the eight directions and the three thousand great thousandfold worlds, all come forth. From the Eastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Great Hall of Goodness of the Jade Capital Mountain, the Perfected of the world of accumulating virtue; from the Southeastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Great Thousandfold World of the Primordial Field of Blessing, the Perfected of the world of employing the worthy; from the Southern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the city precincts of Wanli, the Perfected of the Great Vehicle’s world of forsaking the worthy; from the Southwestern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Land of Extending Blessing, the Perfected of the world of benevolent stillness; from the Western Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the State of the Blessing Hall, the Perfected of the world of tranquil conduct; from the Northwestern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Wilds of Blessing and Virtue, the Perfected of the world of extending the worthy; from the Northern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Wilds of Yudan, the Perfected of the world of purity and stillness; from the Northeastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Capital of Gathered Blessing, the Perfected of the world of everlasting peace—all the Perfected and great sages of the worlds of the eight directions of the Jade Capital Mountain’s Void and Mysterious Metropolis, the boundless heavens, are encompassed within.\n\nThe language of the scriptures may superficially resemble worldly texts, but these are no ordinary words of common speech. They expound the mysterious and true, unfolding the natural and tranquil, dispersing the radiance of the Most High’s Weloquent Heavenly Honored One, elucidating the profound and subtle, cleansing stagnation to purify the spirit, prolonging life to reverse kalpas, ultimately ascending as immortals, abiding eternally in the boundless, and causing the seven ancestors to be reborn in the heavenly halls. The scriptures are lofty and wondrous—thus they are called \"the mysterious within the mysterious.\" Strive earnestly!\n\nThe Dao is profoundly deep; its essence is emptiness and nothingness, yet its vastness depends upon human effort. The Three Treasures are the Treasure of the Dao—the Most High; the Treasure of the Scriptures; and the Treasure of the Teacher. These are the Three Treasures. The Three Honored Ones are the Honored One of the Dao—the Most High; the Honored One of the Scriptures; and the Honored One of the Teacher. These are the Three Honored Ones. Within the human body, there are also Three Honored Ones, corresponding to the three palaces within. The Supreme Unity Thearch Lord, the Duke’s Son, and Non-Flourishing—these are the Three Ones, the Three Honored Ones.\n\nThe scriptures speak of the seven generations of ancestors ascending to the heavenly halls, their knots untied and stagnations dispersed, or returning to be reborn in the human realm as lords and kings. As one’s own body ascends as an immortal, perpetually preserving the root of blessing—this is the karmic retribution of the seven generations of parents. When one’s own body severs love and cuts the umbilical bond of the primordial womb, this is the vow of ritual devotion. The seven generations of ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls or descend to be reborn among humans as lords and kings—this is the great filial way, the essence of the profound scriptures.\n\nThe perfected one’s refinement of form surpasses even the Grand Yin, yet it takes but ten months. In an instant, one may conceal and still the womb. To dwell within the womb is not base. While in the womb, one recalls the events of past lives, but upon birth, these memories are suddenly forgotten. Only those who attain the Dao and penetrate the true naturally know them. Thus, the purpose of speaking to worldly people is to urge them to cultivate goodness and prepare a bridge for future lives.\n\nThe term \"immortal\" (*xian*) means \"to ascend\"—the gradual progression from the mundane to the sagely. \"Perfected\" (*zhen*) means \"firm\"—no longer subject to decay. Through cultivation as an immortal, one becomes a Perfected One. Thus, immortals have ranks, and Perfected Ones have gradations.\n\nThe Six Heavens constitute the Three Realms, and the Great Demon King governs the affairs of the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens. The Demon King serves the Most High, the Perfected, and the Heavenly Honored Ones. When a Daoist’s merit is complete, the Demon King will sponsor their advancement. At the moment of completion, the Demon delights in testing whether their spirit is upright or not.\n\nThe Daoist ascends to the office of Demon King through the veneration of the Most High scriptures, and thus the Demon King’s authority over ghosts and spirits arises from the accumulated blessings of former lives—so too with all the sages. Those who study the Dao should know their former masters. My master is the Most High Jade Clarity Great Dao, the Empty Sovereign, the supreme honor of the Dao. I am the sixth disciple of my master, and all the Great Sages are likewise his disciples. The number of disciples is boundless.\n\nMy master’s name is Boyue Zong, and his style is Weinuohe. I now reveal this to you—guard it well. The names and styles of Perfected Ones are indeed difficult to fathom, for many are concealed in hidden language. My name is Xulai Le, and my style is Hong Yuanfu.\n\nThose who study the Dao without revering their master will find their fasts and recitations unresponsive. If one recklessly reveals these teachings to the faithless, they will incur the punishment of the Three Officials. The Three Officials govern the earth prisons beneath the Six Heavens of the Three Realms, under the Northern Emperor and the Great Demon King. Their domain lies in the Great Northern Sea, north of heaven and earth, on Mount Luofeng, which rises two thousand six hundred *li* and encircles thirty thousand *li*. Within and without, its palaces and chambers are adorned with the seven treasures, a grand metropolis where all the ghosts and spirits of the world pay homage.\n\nNow I reveal the names of these heavenly palaces to you: those who recite them will find evil ghosts dare not approach, malevolent spirits submit and vanish, calamities and harm cannot encroach, the soul’s essence becomes pure and upright, the spirit’s essence becomes clear and upright, and one’s *qi* remains ever-present.\n\nMy master taught: \"I studied the Dao, performed fasts, recited scriptures, established merit, aided beings, and served my master with reverence and diligence across countless kalpas and years. At times born into royal households, at times into noble families, at times as a commoner, at times in the heavens, at times as a Demon King, or even cast back into hell to serve as an official of the Three Offices—enduring the ten sufferings and eight hardships, yet unwavering in resolve, I turned the wheel in pursuit of the Dao. Though mocked by worldly people, I never engaged with them, silently exhorting myself, steadfast in my conduct, renewing my practice daily, and adhering to the scriptures in all matters. Never did I dare doubt, and by encountering the sacred texts, I attained ascension as an immortal, my body like adamantine, my true form entering the subtle and wondrous, my essence pervading the imperceptible, to enjoy boundless life. This came from my devotion, gentleness, benevolence, and tireless study of the scriptures—not from attaining the Dao by chance.\"\n\nFor those who study the Dao at home, they should establish a pure and tranquil retreat, set up a high seat, and reverently place the scriptures for recitation. The meditation couch should be five *chi* square and equally high. Incense should be burned constantly, and lamps kept lit without cease. Only fellow practitioners should be allowed entry. Ritual robes must not be lent carelessly to others. Scriptures should always be transmitted by a master, their texts collated and verified, their affairs conducted with reverence, ever joyful as if in the presence of the Most High. One must not engage in arrogance, mockery, or discussions of worldly glory and profit. Those who violate this will be reported by the scripture-attending immortal youths to the Three Heavens’ Enforcers. The Enforcers will then report to the Most High. After three such reports, you will surely lose the scriptures. Ghosts and spirits will disrupt and torment you, and you may not even die a natural death—how then could you attain immortality?\n\nScriptures not received from a master lack spiritual *qi*, and their cultivation will be ineffective. The scripture-attending immortal youths constantly monitor and punish such offenders, bringing misfortune upon their seven generations of ancestors. Those who receive the Dao without reverence for their master will be recorded by the Three Officials, and ghosts will harm them wantonly. Those who receive scriptures with impurity or disrespect, failing to maintain purity, will incur the sin of slander and, after death, enter hell, only to be reborn among the six domestic animals. If scriptures are damaged and not cleansed with fragrant water, the hun and po souls will scatter and be seized by other ghosts.\n\nThose who transmit scriptures before the proper time, or recklessly divulge them, will find their seven ancestors imprisoned in hell, their own bodies subjected to the torments of the three evil destinies. Even if transmission is due, bestowing them upon the unworthy incurs the same punishment.\n\nDaoists who wish to dwell in secluded mountains should first receive the scriptures, serve their master with reverence, and cultivate all manner of good deeds to subdue the mountain spirits. No mountain, great or small, is without its spirit. A great mountain has a great spirit; a small mountain, a small spirit. If a mountain spirit harms a person, it will not endure. Without mastering the supreme methods and understanding how to cultivate goodness and establish merit, how can one dwell long in the mountains?\n\nWaters, too, have spirits. The Eight Seas are governed by divine kings, while rivers, lakes, the Yellow River, and the Ji River each have their own spirits. Dragon kings and ghostly spirits preside over their clear abysses. The River Earls and Water Officials each have palaces and courts, adorned with the seven treasures and bronze inlays, much like those in Fengdu, all serving as lower palaces for the various immortals. These are determined by one’s conduct in life—depth of practice, magnitude of merit—and the corresponding rewards are meted out without fail. In future lives, one will be reborn as a human, and retribution will follow one’s deeds with absolute precision.\n\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water record the merits, transgressions, virtues, and vices of all people—nothing is left unaccounted. Once there was a nobleman who sincerely believed in the Daoist teachings, made offerings to the Three Treasures, commissioned the copying of scriptures, and built retreats. As his work neared completion, the nobleman fell gravely ill. His disciples and family summoned physicians and prepared bitter medicines to treat him. The nobleman said: \"From my youth, I have revered and followed the precepts and commandments, never daring to forget them. I have also given alms to the poor, made offerings to the Three Treasures, and built retreats—surely the Most High is aware of this. Death is an inevitable part of life, and I do not shrink from it. My only regret is that I have not yet personally upheld the fasts and precepts, recited the scriptures, lit lamps, performed the Daoist walk, or made amends for the transgressions of my seven generations. I have only sought to build a bridge for my next life. My illness has reached its limit, and my life is at its end. Medicine can cure madness and plague, but what can it do for my fate?\"\n\nAt that moment, the Most High, observing the good and evil of all beings across the ten directions, commanded the Controller of Destinies to extend the nobleman’s lifespan by thirty years. Suddenly, he recovered completely, his body as healthy as if he had never been ill.\n\nOnce he had recovered, his resolve grew ever stronger, his dedication renewing itself day by day. He observed fasts, upheld precepts, performed all manner of good deeds, and made offerings to the Three Treasures—thus securing wealth and nobility for generation after generation, drawing virtuous people to be reborn into his family, and ultimately attaining the Wheel-Turning Dao. This man is now the Celestial King of Eastern Florescence under the Most High.\n\nThe teaching of accumulating virtue among the people—how could it not be so? How could it not be so?\n\nHere ends *The Most High’s Scripture of Primordial Karmic Conditions in the Numinous Treasure Tradition of the Cavernous Mystery*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Past Karmic Origins of Fundamental Conduct**\n\n**Sutra Title:** *The Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Sutra of Past Karmic Origins of Fundamental Conduct*\n*Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient* **Numinous Treasure Scriptures** *(Lingbao Jing)*. Collected in the *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, **Great Peace Section**.\n\n---\n\nThe Immortal Duke inquired of the Supreme Pole Perfected One, the Lofty Dharma Master, saying: \"By cultivating what fundamental conduct may one, in this present life, receive blessings, ensure the uprightness of their household, the prosperity of their descendants, and favorable karmic connections unbroken across generations? After death, may they ascend to the heavenly halls or descend to be reborn in the families of marquises and kings among humankind, endowed with wisdom, erudition, benevolence, and reverence for scriptural teachings? May they delight in mountains and forests, constantly reciting subtle words, and ultimately attain the Dao of immortality?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"Excellent is your question! All beings are born with their own fundamental conduct, past karmic roots, and destinies. Various causes interweave, wishes follow one another, like attracts like, and cycles of rebirth unfold, with fortune and misfortune drawing each other forth. Thus, across generations, their inclinations differ, their aspirations vary—all according to their prior vows.\n\nTo cultivate the Dao and forge karmic bonds with the worthy and sagely, one must uphold the great precepts, broadly establish fields of merit, and magnanimously bestow virtue and power. Thereby, one may attain:\n- Flight as an immortal;\n- Ascension as a celestial immortal;\n- Abiding as an earthbound immortal;\n- Transcending life to ascend to the heavenly halls;\n- Becoming a spirit or deity;\n- Serving as an official under the Six Heavenly Great Demon Kings;\n- Transcending life to be reborn directly into the families of marquises and kings, the most honored among humankind;\n- Becoming one upon whom all rely, possessing wealth across the world;\n- Gaining talent and wisdom, keen intelligence;\n- Acquiring a dignified appearance, radiant countenance, and pure, fragrant *qi*;\n- Cultivating benevolence, filial piety, loyalty, chastity, and simplicity;\n- Excelling in literary arts, their conduct serving as a model in motion and stillness;\n- Commanding awe and reverence, admired by all;\n- Devotedly honoring the Three Treasures, their offerings ever diligent;\n- Delighting in mountains and rivers, practicing purity, reciting scriptures, burning incense, and observing fasts;\n- Reverently worshiping the Mysterious Tradition;\n- Transforming from female to male, with a radiant and refined appearance;\n- Ensuring the solemn purity of their household, their karmic connections across generations aligning with their original vows, their descendants virtuous and talented, endlessly secure and noble;\n- Receiving blessings in this present life, their rewards manifesting at life’s end;\n- Or inheriting blessings in future lives, reaping the merits of their past deeds.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? It is responding without contrivance. The four classes of beings who cultivate merit and virtue must have their original vows. The retribution of blessings arises from the vows one establishes in due time. Once meritorious deeds are performed and aspirations are set, their rewards shall be vast—like awaiting dawn after dusk.\n\nYet the people of the world are deceitful and shallow, disbelieving the Dharma’s words. Each claims cunning, following their own whims, dismissing past karma as fabrication. They ridicule the supreme scriptures as false and absurd, while glutting themselves on desires, sitting idly to await immediate retribution, expecting swift and leisurely responses. Thus, the Mysterious Teachings grow dim, the world’s Dao declines, and heaven and humanity suffer—all due to their own conduct. This is why the Supreme One grieves deeply.\"\n\nThe Immortal Duke said: \"I have heard of past karmic causes, the retributions of life and death. What, then, should be the fundamental conduct and supreme precepts?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"The *Supreme Wisdom Precepts of the Supreme One* and the *One Hundred and Eighty Precepts* are all supreme preceptual laws. By upholding the *Ten Precepts of the Supreme One*, one may also attain these blessings. Now, shall I expound them for you? Would you not wish to uphold them?\"\n\nThe Immortal Duke withdrew from his seat, bowed deeply, and said: \"Indeed, indeed! May the Heavenly Worthy deign to transmit them, and I shall uphold them accordingly.\"\n\nThe Dharma Master said: \"The Ten Precepts are as follows:\n1. Do not envy those superior to yourself or suppress the worthy and wise.\n2. Do not consume alcohol or meat, defiling the Three Palaces.\n3. Do not commit adultery with others’ wives or daughters, indulging in lewdness and deceit.\n4. Do not abandon or despise the elderly, sick, impoverished, or lowly.\n5. Do not slander the virtuous or attack fellow disciples.\n6. Do not greedily accumulate wealth and treasures, refusing to bestow or disperse them.\n7. Do not kill living beings or sacrifice to the ghosts and gods of the Six Heavens.\n8. Do not arbitrarily discuss scriptures, dismissing them as false and absurd.\n9. Do not betray the kindness of your teacher or deceive new disciples.\n10. Maintain equanimity and wholeheartedness, practicing benevolence and filial piety toward all.\n\nBy upholding these Ten Precepts and clearly establishing your vows, there is nothing that will not be repaid.\n\nIf one sees another commit evil in this life yet go unpunished, it is because their residual blessings from past lives have not yet been exhausted; once exhausted, misfortune will arrive. If one sees another perform good deeds yet go unrewarded, it is because their residual calamities from past lives have not yet been exhausted; once exhausted, blessings will arrive. Or they may receive retribution in future lives, not necessarily in this one.\n\nIf one greatly establishes good deeds in this life, their merits and transgressions may offset each other, thereby avoiding the calamities of past lives. To bestow kindness in expectation of repayment is not to be repaid—this is the inevitable principle of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nFor those who wish to enter the Dao of immortality, their merits must be as numerous as the grains of dust and sand—only then may they be deemed fitting.\n\nThe Ten Evils must not be violated:\n1. Indulging in alcohol, lust, and insatiable desires.\n2. Secretly harming the world and slandering Daoists.\n3. Disrespecting teachers, neglecting the Dharma, and arrogantly disregarding the Three Treasures.\n4. Stealing scriptures, recklessly propagating the essentials of the Dao.\n5. Borrowing and not returning, deceiving the common people.\n6. Killing living beings for taste, speaking falsely while harboring deceit.\n7. Betraying kindness and violating righteousness, transgressing all prohibitions and precepts.\n8. Reciting scriptures carelessly, mumbling and grumbling, self-righteous.\n9. Demanding others meet your expectations, harboring anger toward the four classes.\n10. Arbitrarily interpreting scriptural meanings, altering or diminishing sacred texts, disbelieving in past karma, indulging in selfish desires, defiling the Four Great Elements, and neglecting the path of life.\n\nThese are the Ten Evil Precepts. Those who violate them may be wrongfully killed by spirits, examined and punished by officials of the *yang* realm, or find safety turning to danger, good fortune meeting misfortune—no endeavor shall succeed.\"",

      "translated_text": "Or they may die and enter hell, confined in dark, heavy cages, never beholding the Three Lights. Day and night, they endure torment—embracing bronze pillars, treading blade mountains, climbing sword trees, plunged into cauldrons of boiling liquid, swallowing flames and smoke, facing freezing ice, experiencing the full measure of the Five Sufferings. Once their hellish sentence is complete, they are conscripted as laborers for the Three Offices, exiled to mountains and seas, whipped and beaten without end. After this, they descend into the world as lowly beings, often reduced to servitude, possessing human form but lacking human sentiment. Some are born among barbarian tribes in distant lands, others afflicted with chronic illness. Evil begets evil, good begets good—such karmic retribution defies full description. The recompense of sin and merit is as certain as the sun and moon casting their light, as the rivers flowing to the great sea. The appointed hour arrives without fail.\n\nThe extinction of sin and merit is like a shadow following form, their cyclic opposition like the turning of a wheel. Thereupon, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate composed a hymn of admonition, saying:\n\nThe Dao takes non-action as its essence,\nAll things become fields of merit.\nEstablishing merit has no fixed master,\nEach vow arises from the person.\nEmpty the self to respond to all beings,\nFocus the mind without partiality.\nThe Great Sage expounds the supreme teaching,\nAs rain nourishes the heavens.\nHigh peaks are universally embraced,\nWhile the humble form deep abysses.\nThe sea is king of a hundred rivers,\nFor it can forsake even dragon scales.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, its restraint endures,\nNot merely for a single lifetime.\nUphold the precepts without pause,\nLifetimes of good karma will follow.\nWith concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,\nAnd you shall embody the true Dao.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate then composed a hymn of transgression, saying:\n\nHuman roots stem from past vows,\nVows determine the overcoming of great afflictions.\nWith pure intent, uphold the Ten Precepts,\nAnd thus transcend the Eight Difficulties.\nIf in past lives one violated the mysterious teaching,\nHow can one find peace in this life?\nThe foolish and blind neglect their nature and destiny,\nOnly sighing when punishment arrives.\nRetribution comes as swiftly as echo follows sound,\nGazing upon it chills the heart.\nBorn into lowly stations,\nGrieving without respite.\nThe Immortal Duke dared to ask: \"The depth of fasting, the height of merit—how do the cycles of the Ten Evils and Ten Goods revolve without cease? When virtue deepens and merit is perfected, one enters quiescent emptiness. By what stages does this come about?\"\n\nThe Dharma Master replied: \"All things, in their myriad forms, must ultimately be emptied. Being and non-being intermingle. Cultivate virtue, nourish the spirit, accumulate merit, and condense the true. Then the true body becomes empty, moving between existence and non-existence, concealed in the most wondrous quiescence. Preserve the subtle and imperceptible, deliver all beings, and become a bridge for the multitude of dharmas. In the turning wheel of Daoist practice, nothing precedes fasting. Among fasts, none surpasses the *Lingbao*. Its method is lofty and wondrous, not to be proclaimed to the common worldly folk. It is always transmitted to those who possess merit from past lives. Without prior karmic affinity, one is not permitted to behold it—even if encountered, it will not be favored. All arises from past vows, and thus it cannot be forcibly taught. For ten thousand kalpas, the oral instructions of immortals and sages have been transmitted in secret, never committed to writing. By the command of the Most High, I have bestowed this upon the son of the Immortal Duke. Record it well. This method benefits all who seek the Dao. Though kalpas turn and cycles revolve, this scripture remains unchanged. When the Dao flourishes in the world, virtue rises with transformation. Sages are rare to encounter, the Dao is rare to behold, scriptures are rare to hear, sagely ages are rare to witness, and worthy persons are rare to meet. Thus, only those with good merit may partake in this assembly.\n\nThe Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, when first learning the Dao, received the *Lingbao* fast. After attaining the Dao, he declared this fast to be most venerable and composed the *Five Invocations of the Lingbao*, from which the fasting method was extracted to form the *Scripture of Essential Teachings*. Though it differs in minor details, it follows the same fundamental fasting method as this scripture. The fasting method of the Great Unity is the most profound within this great fast, serving as the initial step for beginners of the Lesser Vehicle.\n\nThose who follow the mysterious scriptures of the Three Caverns are called adepts of the Great Vehicle. They first deliver others before delivering themselves. Whether sitting, rising, lying down, or at rest, they constantly maintain a compassionate heart toward all, tirelessly engaging in spiritual practice. Their virtue equals that of the Most High, their Dao transcends the August Emperor of the Void. Their kindness fills the ten directions, harmonizing with the mysterious and true. They guide the myriad heavens, their vows reaching the origin of the Dao.\n\nThose who study the Dao must always keep their clothing pure, set apart a quiet space for burning incense, place high-quality incense, and arrange the scriptures with reverence. They bow in devotion, concentrate their thoughts, visualize the true, practice breath control and nurturing exercises, repent for the sins of seven generations of parents, as well as for heavy karmic transgressions from past and present lives. They give alms, establish merit, maintain long fasts in seclusion, and stabilize their original vows. Only when the mind is empty and the intent profound can the true Dao be attained.\n\nPrepare properly the hempen robe, single-layered skirt, and scripture-covering cloth according to the regulations. Do not casually lend them to others or wear them in unclean places. These are called *Dharma robes*, and three divine youths always attend them. Once, a worthy man invited a Daoist, who could not go immediately and thus wore his hempen robe to the appointment. Upon arriving at the man’s home, the host reverently burned incense and paid homage as if the Daoist himself had come. The divine youths appeared in visible form, saying: \"The Daoist sent us.\" The host at that time did not know they were divine youths. The sick in the household were immediately cured, and the family remained free from misfortune. The divine youths said to the host: \"The sick have recovered. The Daoist need not trouble himself to come again. You may return the Dharma robe to him.\" The host did as instructed and sent it back. The Daoist questioned him, and the host replied: \"For a day, we suffered illness and invited you to perform a fast. You were occupied with many matters and only sent immortals—you did not come yourself. Now the sick have recovered, so I return the Dharma robe.\" The Daoist was astonished and listened in awe. After the host finished speaking, the Daoist replied: \"This humble one was occupied with ritual preparations all day and intended to go. The host permitted the worthy man to leave and did not send for me again. Thus, I did not go—not out of betrayal, nor was there anyone to send. Moreover, I did not know the illness in your household had been cured. This must have been achieved by the host’s utmost sincerity.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Daoist asked, \"What did the person who came look like?\" The host replied, \"He appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years old, with a refined and upright bearing, like a scholar.\" The Daoist pondered, \"None of my disciples resemble this. It must have been a divine being who descended.\" He continued, \"Thus, the Dharma robe must be kept pure and clean, crafted according to proper methods. If not, ghosts may harm people, for its majesty and prohibitions are as strict as the luminous statutes. If it becomes worn and tattered, you must wear it yourself and may not use it for other purposes.\"\n\nThe Immortal Lord said, \"I have now witnessed the divine power of the Dharma robe. May I ask about the Ten Precepts—can I receive and uphold them?\" The Perfected One replied, \"I once received them from the Most High Lord of the Great Dao. I have observed them faithfully, forming good affinities with the virtuous life after life, dwelling in blessings and attaining the Dao of immortality. Now I transmit them to you, mindful of our lineage. In the past, an ordinary person who upheld these precepts and maintained unwavering devotion to the Dao extended their lifespan, increased their years, and brought prosperity to their family. May you, in your future lives, study deeply, grow in wisdom and understanding of the scriptures, and ultimately enter the Dao of immortality. On the day of your liberation, you will ascend directly to the Hall of Blessings, where clothing and sustenance arise naturally, and joy and contentment abound. In your next descent into the world, you will study the great Daoist scriptures, gaining profound insight and becoming a master of the age, with nothing left unenlightened.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed great meritorious deeds, held fasts, observed precepts, lit lamps, and made offerings to the Three Treasures with unwavering diligence. They wished to be born into the household of a marquis or king, becoming a person of nobility with a dignified and imposing appearance. When their life ended, flying immortals welcomed them, and they ascended directly to the Heavenly Hall, where clothing and sustenance arose naturally, and joy was boundless. In their next life, they were born into the family of a marquis or king, becoming the child of a noble, endowed with wisdom, intelligence, a refined appearance, and a fragrant, radiant qi.\n\nThere was also a noble who governed with the Dao, performed good deeds, held fasts with sincerity, practiced generosity, lit lamps, repented of sins, and resolved the karmic entanglements of seven generations of parents, making offerings to the Three Treasures. They wished that in their next life, they would again be born as a noble, perpetuating their blessed affinities, with a radiant and joyful appearance, keen insight, and the constant company of the wise and enlightened, continuing to make offerings to the Three Treasures. When their life ended, flying immortals welcomed them, and they ascended directly to the Hall of Blessings, where indescribable joy prevailed. In their next life, they were born into the household of a king, their wealth and nobility surpassing their former existence, their wisdom and bearing refined and transcendent, bringing abundance to the people and peace to their household.\n\nThere was also a noble who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing that in their next life, they would ultimately enter the Dao of immortality. In their subsequent life, they indeed developed a love for the Dao, studied the scriptures, and, having mastered all texts, ascended as an immortal, soaring through the sky in broad daylight.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing that in their next life, they would always encounter the great scriptures of the Three Caverns. In their next life, they indeed beheld the great scriptures, received and recited them, and were revered throughout the Three Realms.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to become a learned Daoist priest well-versed in the scriptures. In their next life, they indeed became a Daoist priest, deeply studying the scriptures and becoming a master for the multitude.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to enter the mountains to study the Dao. In their next life, they dwelled by cliffs in the mountains, cultivating their thoughts and devoting themselves to the Dao.\n\nThere was also a woman who performed such meritorious deeds, wishing to be reborn as a man. In her next life, she was indeed born as a male.\n\nThere was also a worthy person who performed such meritorious deeds, assisting the Dharma master in compiling scriptures, wishing that in their next life, they would encounter the Dao of the scriptures, just as they had hoped.\n\nThere was also a worthy person who performed such meritorious deeds, reciting scriptures, holding fasts, making offerings to the Three Treasures, and devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the Dao. They wished to repay the karmic kindness of seven generations of parents, ascend to the Heavenly Hall, and be reborn into the household of a marquis or king in the human realm. They themselves would ascend as immortals, abiding in eternal tranquility.\n\nI have observed that those who practice generosity and cultivate the Dao never fail to attain what they seek, provided their aspirations are sincere. Once a wish is firmly established, it will surely be fulfilled. The fulfillment is like the echo responding to sound or the seasons following their course. However, sins and blessings are not repaid simultaneously; their outcomes differ in sequence, with merits and transgressions shifting. Some rewards or retributions manifest in future lives, others in the present. Sins and blessings arise from one’s own conduct and habits, not from the idle speculations of the Dao and virtue. Yet people all desire immediate verification of karmic retribution, and when it is deferred to future lives, they dismiss it as ineffectual. Foolish individuals, emboldened by this, indulge their desires to the extreme, disregarding the celestial net, and thus encounter the eight difficulties and tread upon the ten sufferings. At such times, they do not understand the cause. Is this not lamentable? Is this not lamentable?\n\nThe human body is a temporary assemblage, arising from qi. When qi disperses, the person dies, the spirit and the true depart, and the body dissolves, becoming worms and dust, transforming into all manner of ghosts who endure bitter torments, far removed from their former existence. Is this not sorrowful? Is this not sorrowful? Only by attaining the Dao and embodying the true can one’s real form remain eternally secure. The path to attaining the Dao lies in accumulating virtue, performing good deeds, refining the body, and cultivating the spirit, thereby achieving the true form.\n\nThere was also an ordinary person who, seeing Daoist priests in silent fasts, lighting lamps, burning incense, and performing reverent circumambulations, was moved to develop a heart for the Dao and wished to make offerings to the Three Treasures. Though their household was poor and they had no fine delicacies, they offered a few stalks of vegetables to support the midday meal. At that moment, they thought, \"May I in my next life be wealthy and able to make grand offerings to the Three Treasures, widely sowing the fields of blessings.\" Later, they lived in peace and security, fulfilling their heavenly allotted lifespan. When the day of their death arrived and they were to enter hell to face judgment, the Most High issued a decree: though this person had minor transgressions, their diligent and earnest efforts had compensated for their faults. Thus, they were allowed to ascend to the Hall of Blessings. In their next life, they were born into a noble household, becoming a young master of generation after generation, with natural blessings and prosperity, delighting in the Dao and virtue, making offerings to the Three Treasures, and possessing profound wisdom and insight.\n\nThere was also a person who, seeing a Perfected One or Daoist priest in silent fast, reciting scriptures, laughed and said, \"They chant empty scriptures in vain—what do they hope to gain? Fasting with an empty stomach, eating but once a day—such people are sinners!\" The Daoist priest, with a compassionate heart, sought to enlighten them, but their stubbornness remained unshaken. After this person died, they descended directly into hell, where they endured the full measure of the five sufferings, and the hell wardens reproached them, listing their offenses: \"In life, you mocked Daoist priests and slandered the Three Treasures. Now you face this retribution.\" In their next life, they were born as a lowly, impoverished, and wretched commoner.",
      "overlap_context": "ecovered, so I return the Dharma robe.\" The Daoist was astonished and listened in awe. After the host finished speaking, the Daoist replied: \"This humble one was occupied with ritual preparations all day and intended to go. The host permitted the worthy man to leave and did not send for me again. Thus, I did not go—not out of betrayal, nor was there anyone to send. Moreover, I did not know the illness in your household had been cured. This must have been achieved by the host’s utmost sincerity.\"",

      "translated_text": "Again there was a person of upright bearing and refined appearance, versed in worldly classics, who, upon encountering Daoist scriptures and their profound and distant teachings, remarked, \"These seem but the empty and delusional words of ancients. What do I seek in understanding Daoist priests and the wise and noble? To indulge in such things all day—what could one possibly hope to gain?\" This person was soon killed by malevolent spirits in the world, their heavenly mandate cut short in violent death. After dying, they descended into hell, enduring every torment, and in their next life were born dull-witted, outside the bounds of human relations.\n\nThere were also Daoist priests who treated the Dharma lightly, recklessly divulging and profaning sacred scriptures. In life, they were slain by the spirits of the dead, sinking into the depths of hell, and in their next life suffered from karmic illnesses—agonies beyond description.\n\nThus, scriptures must not be carelessly disclosed, lest those who cannot treasure and employ them bring guilt upon both themselves and others. To be a teacher is no easy task; if one instructs disciples improperly, the sin extends to all involved. Human hearts are inscrutable, none free from stinginess and greed. Therefore, the sages bequeathed the Dharma, validating it through its own efficacy. Sage transmitted to sage without need for words of trust; fool transmitted to fool, and without trust, the transmission was incomplete. How could you not be cautious?\n\nIn learning the Dao, one must first cultivate loyalty and filial piety, uphold precepts with virtuous conduct, extend compassion to all, serve one’s teacher with reverence and solemnity, practice breath cultivation to nourish the spirit, honor and receive the great scriptures, venerate Dharma masters as one would a sage, recite scriptures in purity and stillness, relieve those in distress, and exhort others toward goodness. Only then may one ingest elixirs to gain benefit, harmonize the spirit through breathwork, perceive responses from fasting and precepts, and invoke the true descent of scriptures. Demonic hordes will submit and serve, daring not to test or harm—thus one is certain to attain the Dao.\n\nThe *Scriptures of the Dao and Its Virtue*, both upper and lower, along with the *Dongzhen* and *Dongxuan* scriptures, the *Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Writ*, and the various odes of the *Shangqing* corpus—all were composed by the Most High, the Void Emperor, the Perfected of the Myriad Realms, the natural true immortals of the ten directions, the hidden ranks of the Thearch Lords, and the great sages of the celestial palaces, towers, cities, and terraces across the heavens. They describe the pools and mountains of the seas, the numinous observatories of the Most High, the jeweled gates of the natural realms, the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens, the inscriptions upon city walls and gates, or the secret names and hidden characters within the domains of the great demon kings, the locations of their palaces—all were arranged into texts by the Most High. Thus, they must not be slandered or recklessly divulged.\n\nIf, during purificatory rites, one focuses the mind upon the mysterious and true, reciting even a few lines of scripture, then one’s words will resonate like blossoms answering in echo. At that moment, the Most High, the Jade Capital, the Mysterious Metropolis, the sages and Perfected of the eight directions and the three thousand great thousandfold worlds, all come forth. From the Eastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Great Hall of Goodness of the Jade Capital Mountain, the Perfected of the world of accumulating virtue; from the Southeastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Great Thousandfold World of the Primordial Field of Blessing, the Perfected of the world of employing the worthy; from the Southern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the city precincts of Wanli, the Perfected of the Great Vehicle’s world of forsaking the worthy; from the Southwestern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Land of Extending Blessing, the Perfected of the world of benevolent stillness; from the Western Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the State of the Blessing Hall, the Perfected of the world of tranquil conduct; from the Northwestern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Wilds of Blessing and Virtue, the Perfected of the world of extending the worthy; from the Northern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Wilds of Yudan, the Perfected of the world of purity and stillness; from the Northeastern Realm of the Boundless Heavens in the Capital of Gathered Blessing, the Perfected of the world of everlasting peace—all the Perfected and great sages of the worlds of the eight directions of the Jade Capital Mountain’s Void and Mysterious Metropolis, the boundless heavens, are encompassed within.\n\nThe language of the scriptures may superficially resemble worldly texts, but these are no ordinary words of common speech. They expound the mysterious and true, unfolding the natural and tranquil, dispersing the radiance of the Most High’s Weloquent Heavenly Honored One, elucidating the profound and subtle, cleansing stagnation to purify the spirit, prolonging life to reverse kalpas, ultimately ascending as immortals, abiding eternally in the boundless, and causing the seven ancestors to be reborn in the heavenly halls. The scriptures are lofty and wondrous—thus they are called \"the mysterious within the mysterious.\" Strive earnestly!\n\nThe Dao is profoundly deep; its essence is emptiness and nothingness, yet its vastness depends upon human effort. The Three Treasures are the Treasure of the Dao—the Most High; the Treasure of the Scriptures; and the Treasure of the Teacher. These are the Three Treasures. The Three Honored Ones are the Honored One of the Dao—the Most High; the Honored One of the Scriptures; and the Honored One of the Teacher. These are the Three Honored Ones. Within the human body, there are also Three Honored Ones, corresponding to the three palaces within. The Supreme Unity Thearch Lord, the Duke’s Son, and Non-Flourishing—these are the Three Ones, the Three Honored Ones.\n\nThe scriptures speak of the seven generations of ancestors ascending to the heavenly halls, their knots untied and stagnations dispersed, or returning to be reborn in the human realm as lords and kings. As one’s own body ascends as an immortal, perpetually preserving the root of blessing—this is the karmic retribution of the seven generations of parents. When one’s own body severs love and cuts the umbilical bond of the primordial womb, this is the vow of ritual devotion. The seven generations of ancestors ascend to the heavenly halls or descend to be reborn among humans as lords and kings—this is the great filial way, the essence of the profound scriptures.\n\nThe perfected one’s refinement of form surpasses even the Grand Yin, yet it takes but ten months. In an instant, one may conceal and still the womb. To dwell within the womb is not base. While in the womb, one recalls the events of past lives, but upon birth, these memories are suddenly forgotten. Only those who attain the Dao and penetrate the true naturally know them. Thus, the purpose of speaking to worldly people is to urge them to cultivate goodness and prepare a bridge for future lives.\n\nThe term \"immortal\" (*xian*) means \"to ascend\"—the gradual progression from the mundane to the sagely. \"Perfected\" (*zhen*) means \"firm\"—no longer subject to decay. Through cultivation as an immortal, one becomes a Perfected One. Thus, immortals have ranks, and Perfected Ones have gradations.\n\nThe Six Heavens constitute the Three Realms, and the Great Demon King governs the affairs of the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens. The Demon King serves the Most High, the Perfected, and the Heavenly Honored Ones. When a Daoist’s merit is complete, the Demon King will sponsor their advancement. At the moment of completion, the Demon delights in testing whether their spirit is upright or not.",

I am the sixth disciple of my master, and all the Great Sages are likewise his disciples. The number of disciples is boundless.\n\nMy master’s name is Boyue Zong, and his style is Weinuohe. I now reveal this to you—guard it well. The names and styles of Perfected Ones are indeed difficult to fathom, for many are concealed in hidden language.

Within and without, its palaces and chambers are adorned with the seven treasures, a grand metropolis where all the ghosts and spirits of the world pay homage.\n\nNow I reveal the names of these heavenly palaces to you: those who recite them will find evil ghosts dare not approach, malevolent spirits submit and vanish, calamities and harm cannot encroach, the soul’s essence becomes pure and upright, the spirit’s essence becomes clear and upright, and one’s *qi* remains ever-present.\n\nMy master taught: \"I studied the Dao, performed fasts, recited scriptures, established merit, aided beings, and served my master with reverence and diligence across countless kalpas and years. At times born into royal households, at times into noble families, at times as a commoner, at times in the heavens, at times as a Demon King, or even cast back into hell to serve as an official of the Three Offices—enduring the ten sufferings and eight hardships, yet unwavering in resolve, I turned the wheel in pursuit of the Dao. Though mocked by worldly people, I never engaged with them, silently exhorting myself, steadfast in my conduct, renewing my practice daily, and adhering to the scriptures in all matters. Never did I dare doubt, and by encountering the sacred texts, I attained ascension as an immortal, my body like adamantine, my true form entering the subtle and wondrous, my essence pervading the imperceptible, to enjoy boundless life. This came from my devotion, gentleness, benevolence, and tireless study of the scriptures—not from attaining the Dao by chance.\"\n\nFor those who study the Dao at home, they should establish a pure and tranquil retreat, set up a high seat, and reverently place the scriptures for recitation. The meditation couch should be five *chi* square and equally high. Incense should be burned constantly, and lamps kept lit without cease. Only fellow practitioners should be allowed entry. Ritual robes must not be lent carelessly to others. Scriptures should always be transmitted by a master, their texts collated and verified, their affairs conducted with reverence, ever joyful as if in the presence of the Most High. One must not engage in arrogance, mockery, or discussions of worldly glory and profit. Those who violate this will be reported by the scripture-attending immortal youths to the Three Heavens’ Enforcers. The Enforcers will then report to the Most High. After three such reports, you will surely lose the scriptures. Ghosts and spirits will disrupt and torment you, and you may not even die a natural death—how then could you attain immortality?\n\nScriptures not received from a master lack spiritual *qi*, and their cultivation will be ineffective. The scripture-attending immortal youths constantly monitor and punish such offenders, bringing misfortune upon their seven generations of ancestors. Those who receive the Dao without reverence for their master will be recorded by the Three Officials, and ghosts will harm them wantonly. Those who receive scriptures with impurity or disrespect, failing to maintain purity, will incur the sin of slander and, after death, enter hell, only to be reborn among the six domestic animals. If scriptures are damaged and not cleansed with fragrant water, the hun and po souls will scatter and be seized by other ghosts.\n\nThose who transmit scriptures before the proper time, or recklessly divulge them, will find their seven ancestors imprisoned in hell, their own bodies subjected to the torments of the three evil destinies. Even if transmission is due, bestowing them upon the unworthy incurs the same punishment.\n\nDaoists who wish to dwell in secluded mountains should first receive the scriptures, serve their master with reverence, and cultivate all manner of good deeds to subdue the mountain spirits. No mountain, great or small, is without its spirit. A great mountain has a great spirit; a small mountain, a small spirit. If a mountain spirit harms a person, it will not endure. Without mastering the supreme methods and understanding how to cultivate goodness and establish merit, how can one dwell long in the mountains?\n\nWaters, too, have spirits. The Eight Seas are governed by divine kings, while rivers, lakes, the Yellow River, and the Ji River each have their own spirits. Dragon kings and ghostly spirits preside over their clear abysses. The River Earls and Water Officials each have palaces and courts, adorned with the seven treasures and bronze inlays, much like those in Fengdu, all serving as lower palaces for the various immortals. These are determined by one’s conduct in life—depth of practice, magnitude of merit—and the corresponding rewards are meted out without fail. In future lives, one will be reborn as a human, and retribution will follow one’s deeds with absolute precision.\n\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water record the merits, transgressions, virtues, and vices of all people—nothing is left unaccounted. Once there was a nobleman who sincerely believed in the Daoist teachings, made offerings to the Three Treasures, commissioned the copying of scriptures, and built retreats. As his work neared completion, the nobleman fell gravely ill. His disciples and family summoned physicians and prepared bitter medicines to treat him. The nobleman said: \"From my youth, I have revered and followed the precepts and commandments, never daring to forget them. I have also given alms to the poor, made offerings to the Three Treasures, and built retreats—surely the Most High is aware of this. Death is an inevitable part of life, and I do not shrink from it. My only regret is that I have not yet personally upheld the fasts and precepts, recited the scriptures, lit lamps, performed the Daoist walk, or made amends for the transgressions of my seven generations. I have only sought to build a bridge for my next life. My illness has reached its limit, and my life is at its end. Medicine can cure madness and plague, but what can it do for my fate?\"\n\nAt that moment, the Most High, observing the good and evil of all beings across the ten directions, commanded the Controller of Destinies to extend the nobleman’s lifespan by thirty years. Suddenly, he recovered completely, his body as healthy as if he had never been ill.",

At the moment of completion, the Demon delights in testing whether their spirit is upright or not.",
