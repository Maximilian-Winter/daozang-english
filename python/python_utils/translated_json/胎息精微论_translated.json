When Dao and virtue intertwine, the body does not decay. Internally nourished by Grand Harmony, primordial qi takes precedence. Refine yourself through purity and tranquility, forgetting the body and releasing the form. With a mind free of thoughts and anxieties, stabilize the viscera. Penetrate to the utmost of Grand Harmony, and attain longevity and enduring vision. When all qi is still and the mind flows like water, practicing without cease, one truly attains the Dao.\n\nWhenever entering a quiet chamber, guard the Mysterious Primordial qi. The Mysterious Primordial is the One Qi. Within the Mysterious lies the yet more mysterious—this is my life; within life lies life—this is my form; within form lies form—this is my essence; within essence lies essence—this is my qi; within qi lies qi—this is my spirit; within spirit lies spirit—this is my spontaneity.\n\nVirtue employs form as its chariot; the Dao employs qi as its steed. The hun-soul takes essence as its root; the po-soul takes the eyes as its gate. When form labors, virtue scatters; when qi strays, the Dao rebels. When essence wanes, the hun-soul is diminished; when the eyes move, the po-soul weakens. Thus, guard stillness and cherish qi, preserve essence and treasure spirit. When Dao and virtue congeal in secrecy, the hun and po are firmly guarded—this is what is meant by \"embracing the Dao without speech.\"\n\nWhen one attains the true qi, the skin becomes lustrous and moist; when one grasps the root of the Dao, the hands and feet perspire. When essence overflows, one neither hungers nor thirsts. Like the tortoise and dragon, embryonic breathing endures ceaselessly, inexhaustible in use. Drinking from the Mysterious Spring, ascending to the Great Clarity, reverting to youth and returning to infancy—such is the spontaneity of the Dao.\n\nThe supreme Dao is not distant; it lies near within one’s own body. With a mind refined and subtle, life is eternally preserved. Those who cultivate the Dao today may ingest the qi of the five grains, the eight directions, the four seasons, the sun, moon, and stars—all in vain. They merely imagine it entering from the crown and nose, though ancient scriptures record such practices, few succeed, nor are they feasible for those who consume grains. Thus, many who cultivate qi fail to grasp its secrets, exhausting their essence in vain. Once the gateway is found and the secret comprehended, the key lies in diligent practice without slackening.\n\nGenerally, the embryo forms within qi, and qi arises from embryonic breathing; the embryo completes itself within qi. When qi is pure, it congeals and coalesces; when qi is turbid, it scatters and departs. Once the embryo is formed, all illnesses naturally dissipate. The numinous dwells within, the Three Ones guard the center, and corpse-worms perish—gradually, one communicates with the immortals.\n\nYet today’s scholars may transmit ancient methods or receive false teachings, all involving closing the mouth and constricting the nose, prizing prolonged breath while ignorant of the blockage in the five viscera, which harms the upright qi—this is far from natural breathing. Such practices labor the body and spirit to no benefit. The Dao does not entail forcibly obstructing the nose and mouth to imitate embryonic breathing, for such a method lacks this principle. If the qi of the nose and mouth is obstructed, the lung viscus is harmed—what benefit is there?\n\nThose who ingest internal qi, though their effort is minimal, swiftly witness success. The key lies in calming the spirit and quieting thoughts, avoiding disturbance. Then the qi-pathways flow smoothly, the joints open, and primordial harmony is contained within, never dissipating throughout the day. The skin becomes lustrous, the hands and feet perspire—here lies the secret of the Dao of longevity.\n\nWhen internal qi is full, hunger and thirst vanish. Initially, practice may be slightly difficult, but over time, it becomes wondrous. When qi is inexhaustible and the spirit remains undisturbed, the Dao arrives like qi. Cultivate sincerely, and you will commune with the numinous. The teeth become firm, the pupils bright and clear. The sinews and bones are whole and solid, the embryonic spirit robust and brave. The complexion glows, steps are light in movement. The heart is free of desire, the spirit does not crave glory. The Mysterious Father and the Red Child are firmly bound, never to falter. The hun and po guard the primordial, the Three Ones are naturally true. Eternally treasure the Dao, still and pacify the spirit. The spirit naturally communes with the numinous, and the Dao is daily preserved.\n\nWhen embryonic breathing and primordial qi are perfected, one becomes a true person. The subtleties of embryonic breathing are exhausted herein.\n\n**Secret of the Wondrous Application of Internal Truth**\n\nThe secret states: To attain longevity, cultivate that which gives you life. The root of what gives life begins with essence and qi. Essence and qi coalesce to form the body. The body is the root of receiving qi; qi is the root of receiving form. Without form, qi has no place to abide; without qi, form cannot be completed. Thus, when primordial qi is first sensed, it lies concealed below the mother’s navel. For three months in chaos, the Mysterious Female is complete.\n\nThe Mysterious Female is the mouth and nose. Once the Mysterious Female is established, it is like a melon with its stem—yin infuses the mother’s qi, beginning here. When the mother exhales, so do you; when the mother inhales, so do you. Continuously for ten months, qi and spirit are fully prepared, and one emerges from the womb at birth. Though the mother may delight in her child, she does not know that her form is depleted, her body withered, her spirit divided, and her qi exhausted for the child’s sake.\n\nAfter seven days, emotions manifest externally, transforming from infant to child, able to smile when pointing at the cheeks. The ancient perfected ones said: \"After losing the Dao, then comes virtue.\" The root of lost simplicity ends here. How much more so when, at fifteen, one becomes a youth, and at twenty, a young adult—dazzled by the five colors, ears attuned to the five sounds, employing wit and expending spirit without respite. Thus, the root of pure simplicity is utterly lost.\n\nTherefore, the sage, knowing the futility of external pursuits, returns to the origin and reverts to the root, grasping the mechanism of embryonic breathing to attain longevity and immortality—this principle is clear.\n\n*The Scripture of the Central Embryo* states: \"Within the form, mother and child—why not guard them?\" Moreover, within the form, qi is the mother, and spirit is the child. Form and qi are established first, then spirit arises. Spirit is born from qi, hence it is the child. Thus, the sage does not contemplate external matters, does not gaze upon external colors, does not heed external sounds, constantly ensuring that spirit and qi unite. United, they circulate in cycles between the viscera.\n\nGuiding breath upward and downward, with prolonged practice, spirit naturally becomes luminous, and qi naturally harmonizes. When spirit is luminous, it can illumine the five viscera; when qi is harmonized, it flows unimpeded to the four limbs. Thus, the Yellow Emperor, for three months, turned his gaze inward and fixed his mind—once spirit is unified, its radiance transforms and arises, entwining the five viscera. This principle may be inferred and understood.\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Immortal and Daoist are not possessed of spirit; it is the accumulation of essence that brings harmony and perfect benevolence.\" All pertains to this matter.\n\nIn the present age, people’s spirit and qi each follow their own course; mother and child do not guard one another. Though qi breathes within, spirit constantly operates without. Thus, qi is ever made to pursue impurities, while spirit remains unrefined and dull. When spirit is not luminous and empty, primordial radiance gradually scatters. To illustrate this: spirit is the master, the body the dwelling; if the master does not attend within but daily expends himself without, the dwelling naturally becomes empty and gradually falls into ruin.\n\nThose who are not followers of the Dao labor their spirit and exhaust their qi, yet within the body, not a single breath abides—how can they still hope for longevity? How distant is such a goal!\n\nThe Master said: If one knows the governance of spirit and qi, the movement of mother and child, then the Way of cultivating life becomes clearly apparent. If qi has no master and breath is left to its natural course, it merely serves to circulate and harmonize the viscera, digesting grain and food—yet it can never return yin to yang or replenish blood and brain. Thus, one knows that the breathing of ordinary people differs entirely from that of the sage!\n\nTherefore, *The Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: \"The breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat; the breath of the perfected reaches the heels.\" The heel is like the root. It also says: \"Their breath is deeply rooted; deep roots firmly establish the stem.\" All speak to this meaning.\n\nThe Master said: Ordinary people follow the breath as it naturally comes; though near, they exhaust it, and its benefit extends only to digesting food. The perfected, however, govern with spirit: exhaling, they guide it downward; inhaling, they draw it upward. It ascends to the Mud Pill, descends to the stem’s end—when these two luminaries communicate, one may reverse aging and restore the decrepit.\n\nYet if exhalation is not governed by spirit, a single breath is incomplete; if inhalation is not governed by spirit, illness arises within that same breath. When spirit and qi are not whole, if one can ensure that with every breath, spirit and qi remain united, then the embryo forms within the qi one imbibes, and qi breathes within the embryo that has taken shape. Once the inner embryo breath is established, one may seek death in vain.\n\nMaster Yin said: If spirit can govern qi, then the nose does not lose its breath—these words are most profound!\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Sun and moon array themselves, setting forth yin and yang; when the two spirits meet, they transform into jade blossoms.\" This refers to the moment when yin and yang qi unite. After the two luminaries observe one another, passions and desires stir. Essence and qi all descend into the stem; if one does not know the Dao, essence and qi are entirely drawn forth by desire, beyond control, leading to the sorrow of drainage and the affliction of the tail’s end.\n\nBut for the Daoist, spirit and qi move in unison, ascending and descending with each breath, never allowing stagnation in the lower palace. This is spirit conjoining while essence does not scatter. Though spirit may unite, it ever savors the primordial flavor.\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Child Cinnabar advances, hungry for the pure yellow repast; bland, the primordial flavor is the food of heaven and humankind.\" It also says: \"Within the mind’s movement and stillness, qi follows the Dao; naturally, my spirit’s radiance shines.\" Proceeding thus, though passions may stir essence and qi, with the Dao as self-mastery, they remain unmoved.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao* says: \"When transformation and desire arise, I shall suppress them with the nameless uncarved block.\" The nameless uncarved block is the wondrous function of embryonic breathing. With long practice of embryonic breathing, spirit and qi naturally align and harmonize, becoming gentle and manageable.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao* asks: \"Can you concentrate qi and attain suppleness, becoming like an infant?\" If embryonic breathing is not yet perfected, true spirit does not govern essence and qi—essence and qi, having no master, naturally move with desire. Once passions stir, essence and qi scatter. Though one may strive to restrain them, it is ultimately of no avail.\n\nWhen the Way of embryonic breathing is accomplished, essence and qi have a master. Thus, in men, no essence gathers in the stem; in women, no embryo forms in the navel. Though passions may arise, they can never contend with spirit. This is the truth of embryonic breathing, the return of essence to spirit. The text is complete.\n\n---\n\n**The Sevenfold Return of Embryonic Breath and Spirit Union: Inner Elixir Formula**\n*(Also called: Retaining Essence and Returning Qi to Replenish the Brain)*\n\nTo weary the spirit all day in empty talk\nIs not as good as returning it to the body’s midst.\nUnbroken, ceaseless—the Dao flows of itself,\nLike mist rising, clouds descending, how vast and obscure!\n\nFrom this practice arise the Seven Primes and Three Ancients;\nMy true self neither west nor east abides.\nEver after, the body within becomes light as wind,\nAnd partaking of it, one must ascend into the void.\n\nThe world sees one but knows not the one;\nEach act of visualization sends a spirit forth.\nThey know only to fix the mind on all things,\nUnknowing that with each day, they diminish.\n\nI urge you: to seek the true, first know the true—\nThe world’s Daoist scriptures mislead many.\nOpening diagrams, perusing records, they only confuse the spirit;\nSuch methods cannot preserve this body.\n\nAlas! They possess but do not cherish,\nBright and dim, sinking into the mire of dust.\n\nFor those who cultivate truth and study the Dao,\nIt is essential to preserve spirit and secure qi,\nTo nurture essence and safeguard the body,\nStrengthening bones and filling the marrow.\n\nSpirit and essence are the root of life, the source of the Dao.\nPrimordial qi is the root of spirit.\nThe body is the dwelling of qi.\nThe heart is the abode of spirit.\n\nEssence, overused, is exhausted;\nQi, overused, is cut off;\nSpirit, overused, declines.\n\nThus, what sustains a person is spirit.\nWhat sustains spirit is qi and essence.\nWhen qi wanes, spirit weakens;\nWhen qi flourishes, spirit strengthens.\n\nIf spirit weakens and qi declines,\nHow can the dwelling remain whole?\nIn cultivating qi and nurturing spirit,\nOne must firmly guard them—\nEven when the hun-soul flees and the po-soul scatters,\nWhat use is regret then?\n\nTo establish is to invite harm; to summon is to court ruin. This may be likened to a lamp: the lamp depends on oil as its mother—once the oil is exhausted, how can the lamp endure?\n\nThe *Inner Elixir* of the Yellow Emperor is the gate of the Seven Returns. The Inner Elixir consists of saliva, fluids, blood, essence, brain, and qi. To nurture spirit, one must first nurture qi. To nurture qi, one must first nurture the brain. To nurture the brain, one must first nurture essence. To nurture essence, one must first nurture blood. To nurture blood, one must first nurture saliva. To nurture saliva, one must first nurture fluids.\n\nFluids are the vital juices of the Five Flowers. The essence of primordial qi resides in the mouth beside the teeth, where it is called *water*. As the *Yellow Court Classic* states:\n*\"Irrigate the Five Flowers to plant the numinous root,\nThe Seven Fluids flow freely, surging through the chamber.\nThe body radiates light, its qi fragrant as orchids,\nDispelling a hundred evils, refining the jade countenance.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous effect of swallowing saliva. When fluids remain in the mouth, they are called *water*; once swallowed and reaching the lungs, they become *saliva*. Saliva is white, thus corresponding to metal, for the saliva in the lungs belongs to metal, yet it is constantly refined by the heart’s pulse. When saliva flows into the heart, it transforms into blood. Blood is red, corresponding to fire, for the heart belongs to fire, yet it is constantly restrained by the kidneys. When blood flows into the kidneys, it transforms into essence. Essence is lustrous, thus corresponding to water, for the essence in the kidneys belongs to water, yet it is constantly restrained by the brain’s pulse. The spleen’s qi responds to the brain as the Mud Pill Palace. The Mud Pill Palace is earth, with two channels descending to the kidneys’ essence. When essence resides in the kidneys, it is called *essence*; when it flows into the Mud Pill Palace, it becomes the brain. The brain is yellow, thus corresponding to earth.\n\nThe brain has two channels descending along the spine to three inches below the navel, called the *Sea of Qi*. When the brain is full, the Sea of Qi flourishes; when it flourishes, primordial qi abounds; when it abounds, it becomes pure; when pure, spirit is born. Thus, water can nourish all things, and when water dries up, all things wither.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* says:\n*\"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root—\nHeed this cultivation, and the body endures forever.\"*\n\nThis briefly discusses the Dao of nurturing life. Alas! Worldly people, lost in indulgence and desire, recklessly expend their essence. The *Yellow Court Classic* warns:\n*\"When primordial qi is ruined and spirit scattered,\nWithin the great span of life, one shortens one’s own days.\"*\nAnd further:\n*\"If you drain the sea and pour out its hundred streams,\nThe leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue.\nQi perishes, fluids leak—this is no longer your true form.\nFor long life, be most cautious in the chamber’s affairs.\"*\n\nWhy court death and make the spirits weep? Among the hundred arts of the bedchamber, the subtlety lies in returning essence to replenish the brain. Beginners in Dao cultivation, whose primordial qi has yet to flow freely, will find it difficult to grasp these profound principles. Here ends the *Discourse on the Subtleties of Embryonic Breathing*.",

      "translated_text": "Guiding breath upward and downward, with prolonged practice, spirit naturally becomes luminous, and qi naturally harmonizes. When spirit is luminous, it can illumine the five viscera; when qi is harmonized, it flows unimpeded to the four limbs. Thus, the Yellow Emperor, for three months, turned his gaze inward and fixed his mind—once spirit is unified, its radiance transforms and arises, entwining the five viscera. This principle may be inferred and understood.\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Immortal and Daoist are not possessed of spirit; it is the accumulation of essence that brings harmony and perfect benevolence.\" All pertains to this matter.\n\nIn the present age, people’s spirit and qi each follow their own course; mother and child do not guard one another. Though qi breathes within, spirit constantly operates without. Thus, qi is ever made to pursue impurities, while spirit remains unrefined and dull. When spirit is not luminous and empty, primordial radiance gradually scatters. To illustrate this: spirit is the master, the body the dwelling; if the master does not attend within but daily expends himself without, the dwelling naturally becomes empty and gradually falls into ruin.\n\nThose who are not followers of the Dao labor their spirit and exhaust their qi, yet within the body, not a single breath abides—how can they still hope for longevity? How distant is such a goal!\n\nThe Master said: If one knows the governance of spirit and qi, the movement of mother and child, then the Way of cultivating life becomes clearly apparent. If qi has no master and breath is left to its natural course, it merely serves to circulate and harmonize the viscera, digesting grain and food—yet it can never return yin to yang or replenish blood and brain. Thus, one knows that the breathing of ordinary people differs entirely from that of the sage!\n\nTherefore, *The Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: \"The breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat; the breath of the perfected reaches the heels.\" The heel is like the root. It also says: \"Their breath is deeply rooted; deep roots firmly establish the stem.\" All speak to this meaning.\n\nThe Master said: Ordinary people follow the breath as it naturally comes; though near, they exhaust it, and its benefit extends only to digesting food. The perfected, however, govern with spirit: exhaling, they guide it downward; inhaling, they draw it upward. It ascends to the Mud Pill, descends to the stem’s end—when these two luminaries communicate, one may reverse aging and restore the decrepit.\n\nYet if exhalation is not governed by spirit, a single breath is incomplete; if inhalation is not governed by spirit, illness arises within that same breath. When spirit and qi are not whole, if one can ensure that with every breath, spirit and qi remain united, then the embryo forms within the qi one imbibes, and qi breathes within the embryo that has taken shape. Once the inner embryo breath is established, one may seek death in vain.\n\nMaster Yin said: If spirit can govern qi, then the nose does not lose its breath—these words are most profound!\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Sun and moon array themselves, setting forth yin and yang; when the two spirits meet, they transform into jade blossoms.\" This refers to the moment when yin and yang qi unite. After the two luminaries observe one another, passions and desires stir. Essence and qi all descend into the stem; if one does not know the Dao, essence and qi are entirely drawn forth by desire, beyond control, leading to the sorrow of drainage and the affliction of the tail’s end.\n\nBut for the Daoist, spirit and qi move in unison, ascending and descending with each breath, never allowing stagnation in the lower palace. This is spirit conjoining while essence does not scatter. Though spirit may unite, it ever savors the primordial flavor.\n\n*The Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Child Cinnabar advances, hungry for the pure yellow repast; bland, the primordial flavor is the food of heaven and humankind.\" It also says: \"Within the mind’s movement and stillness, qi follows the Dao; naturally, my spirit’s radiance shines.\" Proceeding thus, though passions may stir essence and qi, with the Dao as self-mastery, they remain unmoved.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao* says: \"When transformation and desire arise, I shall suppress them with the nameless uncarved block.\" The nameless uncarved block is the wondrous function of embryonic breathing. With long practice of embryonic breathing, spirit and qi naturally align and harmonize, becoming gentle and manageable.\n\n*The Scripture of the Dao* asks: \"Can you concentrate qi and attain suppleness, becoming like an infant?\" If embryonic breathing is not yet perfected, true spirit does not govern essence and qi—essence and qi, having no master, naturally move with desire. Once passions stir, essence and qi scatter. Though one may strive to restrain them, it is ultimately of no avail.\n\nWhen the Way of embryonic breathing is accomplished, essence and qi have a master. Thus, in men, no essence gathers in the stem; in women, no embryo forms in the navel. Though passions may arise, they can never contend with spirit. This is the truth of embryonic breathing, the return of essence to spirit. The text is complete.\n\n---\n\n**The Sevenfold Return of Embryonic Breath and Spirit Union: Inner Elixir Formula**\n*(Also called: Retaining Essence and Returning Qi to Replenish the Brain)*\n\nTo weary the spirit all day in empty talk\nIs not as good as returning it to the body’s midst.\nUnbroken, ceaseless—the Dao flows of itself,\nLike mist rising, clouds descending, how vast and obscure!\n\nFrom this practice arise the Seven Primes and Three Ancients;\nMy true self neither west nor east abides.\nEver after, the body within becomes light as wind,\nAnd partaking of it, one must ascend into the void.\n\nThe world sees one but knows not the one;\nEach act of visualization sends a spirit forth.\nThey know only to fix the mind on all things,\nUnknowing that with each day, they diminish.\n\nI urge you: to seek the true, first know the true—\nThe world’s Daoist scriptures mislead many.\nOpening diagrams, perusing records, they only confuse the spirit;\nSuch methods cannot preserve this body.\n\nAlas! They possess but do not cherish,\nBright and dim, sinking into the mire of dust.\n\nFor those who cultivate truth and study the Dao,\nIt is essential to preserve spirit and secure qi,\nTo nurture essence and safeguard the body,\nStrengthening bones and filling the marrow.\n\nSpirit and essence are the root of life, the source of the Dao.\nPrimordial qi is the root of spirit.\nThe body is the dwelling of qi.\nThe heart is the abode of spirit.\n\nEssence, overused, is exhausted;\nQi, overused, is cut off;\nSpirit, overused, declines.\n\nThus, what sustains a person is spirit.\nWhat sustains spirit is qi and essence.\nWhen qi wanes, spirit weakens;\nWhen qi flourishes, spirit strengthens.\n\nIf spirit weakens and qi declines,\nHow can the dwelling remain whole?\nIn cultivating qi and nurturing spirit,\nOne must firmly guard them—\nEven when the hun-soul flees and the po-soul scatters,\nWhat use is regret then?",
      "overlap_context": "ear.\n\n*The Scripture of the Central Embryo* states: \"Within the form, mother and child—why not guard them?\" Moreover, within the form, qi is the mother, and spirit is the child. Form and qi are established first, then spirit arises. Spirit is born from qi, hence it is the child. Thus, the sage does not contemplate external matters, does not gaze upon external colors, does not heed external sounds, constantly ensuring that spirit and qi unite. United, they circulate in cycles between the viscera.",

      "translated_text": "To establish is to invite harm; to summon is to court ruin. This may be likened to a lamp: the lamp depends on oil as its mother—once the oil is exhausted, how can the lamp endure?\n\nThe *Inner Elixir* of the Yellow Emperor is the gate of the Seven Returns. The Inner Elixir consists of saliva, fluids, blood, essence, brain, and qi. To nurture spirit, one must first nurture qi. To nurture qi, one must first nurture the brain. To nurture the brain, one must first nurture essence. To nurture essence, one must first nurture blood. To nurture blood, one must first nurture saliva. To nurture saliva, one must first nurture fluids.\n\nFluids are the vital juices of the Five Flowers. The essence of primordial qi resides in the mouth beside the teeth, where it is called *water*. As the *Yellow Court Classic* states:\n*\"Irrigate the Five Flowers to plant the numinous root,\nThe Seven Fluids flow freely, surging through the chamber.\nThe body radiates light, its qi fragrant as orchids,\nDispelling a hundred evils, refining the jade countenance.\"*\n\nSuch is the wondrous effect of swallowing saliva. When fluids remain in the mouth, they are called *water*; once swallowed and reaching the lungs, they become *saliva*. Saliva is white, thus corresponding to metal, for the saliva in the lungs belongs to metal, yet it is constantly refined by the heart’s pulse. When saliva flows into the heart, it transforms into blood. Blood is red, corresponding to fire, for the heart belongs to fire, yet it is constantly restrained by the kidneys. When blood flows into the kidneys, it transforms into essence. Essence is lustrous, thus corresponding to water, for the essence in the kidneys belongs to water, yet it is constantly restrained by the brain’s pulse. The spleen’s qi responds to the brain as the Mud Pill Palace. The Mud Pill Palace is earth, with two channels descending to the kidneys’ essence. When essence resides in the kidneys, it is called *essence*; when it flows into the Mud Pill Palace, it becomes the brain. The brain is yellow, thus corresponding to earth.\n\nThe brain has two channels descending along the spine to three inches below the navel, called the *Sea of Qi*. When the brain is full, the Sea of Qi flourishes; when it flourishes, primordial qi abounds; when it abounds, it becomes pure; when pure, spirit is born. Thus, water can nourish all things, and when water dries up, all things wither.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Classic* says:\n*\"The Jade Pool’s clear water irrigates the numinous root—\nHeed this cultivation, and the body endures forever.\"*\n\nThis briefly discusses the Dao of nurturing life. Alas! Worldly people, lost in indulgence and desire, recklessly expend their essence. The *Yellow Court Classic* warns:\n*\"When primordial qi is ruined and spirit scattered,\nWithin the great span of life, one shortens one’s own days.\"*\nAnd further:\n*\"If you drain the sea and pour out its hundred streams,\nThe leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant hue.\nQi perishes, fluids leak—this is no longer your true form.\nFor long life, be most cautious in the chamber’s affairs.\"*\n\nWhy court death and make the spirits weep? Among the hundred arts of the bedchamber, the subtlety lies in returning essence to replenish the brain. Beginners in Dao cultivation, whose primordial qi has yet to flow freely, will find it difficult to grasp these profound principles. Here ends the *Discourse on the Subtleties of Embryonic Breathing*.",
