Author unknown, approximately composed between the Tang and Song dynasties. Invokes the Heavenly Worthy for protection, life extension, and preservation of destiny.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Category of Original Texts*.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Life Extension resided within the Golden Light Mountain of the Southern Culmen Heaven, beneath the Jeweled Forest Tree. Abiding in serene contemplation of the Dao, he expounded the *Sutra of Wondrous Extension of Life* to an assembly of ten thousand disciples, discoursing upon the Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-Being.\n\nHis entire form radiated luminous brilliance, pervading and illuminating the heavens, earth, the Three Realms, and the ten directions. A thunderous resonance arose, and all the celestial sages, every ghostly king, and the ten divisions of heavenly dragons followed the light to arrive before the Heavenly Worthy. Yearning to transcend birth and death, they prostrated themselves, touching their heads to the ground in reverence, then rose to stand in their proper ranks.\n\nAt that moment, the Perfected of Extended Life, the Perfected of Vast Fortune, the Perfected of Golden Splendor, the Perfected of Wondrous Joy, the Perfected of Purple Canopy, the Youth of the Yellow Register, the Youth of Azure Empyrean, the Youth of Verdant Radiance, the Youth of White Wisdom, and all the holy multitudes presented jeweled flowers and fragrant herbs of a hundred flavors. Holding aloft the numinous banners of sun and moon, the divine staffs of purple light, the ten mystic pennants of absolution, and the life-extending jeweled canopies, they circumambulated in ritual procession, burning incense and scattering flowers. In unison, they chanted the name of the Heavenly Worthy of Life Extension, and all attained deliverance into the immortal realms.\n\nThen the divine Worthy, smiling majestically, emitted from the crown of his head ten beams of sacred light, universally illuminating the bodies and minds of the assembly—yet none awakened to its meaning.\n\nThereupon, a youth named Excellent Attainment stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Among those seated here are all manner of transformed immortals. How is it that none have awakened? I humbly beseech Your August Countenance to expound the truth for your disciple.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy replied: \"Though these immortals possess numinous powers, they lack the true Dao.\"\n\nThe youth asked: \"May I inquire what is called the true Dao?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"That which is neither born nor extinguished is called the true Dao. That which neither departs nor arrives is also called the true Dao. Yet even in neither birth nor extinction, neither departure nor arrival, one may still remain ignorant of the true Dao. All dharmic appearances are but empty delusions.\n\nIf the men and women of the world wish to extend their lives, prolong their years, dispel calamities, and accumulate blessings, they need only devote themselves to burning incense and practicing the Dao, making offerings and releasing living beings, establishing meritorious deeds, reciting sutras, and making reverent offerings. They may also invite Daoist masters and ritualists to lecture on this sacred sutra and perform life-extension rites and jiao offerings. Then the Divine Kings of Life Registration, Name Recording, Death’s Removal, and Ascendant Birth will protect those who recite the sutra, record their merits, and memorialize the heavens. Gold and silk will abound, and they shall forever dwell in peace and security.\"\n\nThereupon, all the great celestial sages and every ghostly king bowed their heads in homage and took refuge, rejoicing greatly. \"Through kalpas of cultivating the Dao,\" they declared, \"we have never heard this sutra. These are the golden words of the Heavenly Worthy’s own mouth!\" Thus, the spirits and gods made vast vows, pledging that in life after life, they would behold true immortals with their eyes, hear the true Dharma with their ears, pay homage to the Ten Fasts, and perpetually practice the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy then left this verse:\n\n*Those unfilial in life—what grace awaits them in death?*\n*Wailing in hell, who will heed the words of good counsel?*\n*Cultivate goodness, and goodness shall be your return;*\n*Do evil, and evil shall be your source.*\n*With utmost sincerity, make constant offerings,*\n*And in life’s extension, you shall meet the immortals.*\n*Copy sutras and fashion images—*\n*Fortune and longevity shall naturally be yours.*\n\nAt that time, all the perfected immortals in the assembly, having heard the sutra, exclaimed its inconceivable profundity, bowed twice, and withdrew.\n\n**Here ends *The Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy’s Sutra of Wondrous Extension of Life*.**",
