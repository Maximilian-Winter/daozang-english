Pseudepigraphically attributed to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, expounding to the Golden Flower Perfected and others the methods of revering and prostrating to the Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks for disaster elimination, sin expiation, salvation, and deliverance from death. One fascicle. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*. Also found in the *Daoist Canon Compendium*, Shi collection.)\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided within the Golden Gates of the Great Brahma Heaven, in the Jade Purity Sacred Realm’s Heavenly Palace. Ascending the Nine Radiance Treasure Throne, wielding the Five Brilliance Ruyi, he convened the myriad Heavenly Sovereigns, the sun, moon, and stellar hosts, and the boundless perfected immortals and sacred assemblies, all arrayed before the Dao.\n\nThen, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy emitted a great and vast sound, expounding the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma. Heavenly blossoms scattered in profusion, and jade-like incense wafted in coils.\n\nAmong the assembly were four great perfected ones: the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Golden Flower Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Jade Purity Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Wondrous Conduct Perfected, and the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Savior from Suffering Perfected. Each stepped forth from their ranks, knelt in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:\n\n“We observe that within the world below, in the Nine Dark Hells, there are men and women of all ages who, though they have perished in the mortal realm, suffer from poverty, hardship, and distress; lingering illnesses; demonic and spectral afflictions; karmic transgressions and curses; misfortunes, disasters, and legal entanglements; years of poisonous harm; and untimely, violent deaths.\n\nWe further see that within the hells, the hungry ghosts and forsaken souls endure ceaseless torment day and night—blades on wheels, trees of swords, scorching flames, and freezing ice—without respite. Again, in the Blood Pool Hell, countless women endure myriad sufferings, unceasing day and night. Why do these two paths of beings suffer such differing karmic causes? We beseech the Heavenly Compassion to open wide the gate of expedient means and broadly reveal the path of cultivation.”\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy replied: “Return to your positions and listen carefully to the wondrous sound. I shall expound it all for you.\n\nThe beings of the world do not believe in the karmic retribution of good and evil. Some disrespect Heaven and Earth, are disloyal to their sovereigns, unfilial to their parents, and irreverent toward their teachers and elders. They defy divine principles, rebel against their brothers, relatives, neighbors, and friends, act duplicitously, and harbor deceit in their hearts. For all such transgressions, the divine officials and sacred assemblies of the Peak Prefecture have already recorded and examined their sins day and night, verifying their truth.\n\nThus, in their lifetimes, they suffer poverty, hardship, and distress; malignant diseases, sores, and poisons; epidemics and ailments; disasters and misfortunes; legal entanglements and imprisonment; demonic and spectral harm; years of unrelenting calamity; and an inability to find peace. Their households are plagued by misfortune, and they frequently encounter funerals and disasters. They may suffer from wars, fires, floods, locusts, famines, and banditry, rarely witnessing peace.\n\nAfter death, they forever descend into hell, sinking into the realm of hungry ghosts, where their bodies are dismembered, boiled in cauldrons, and subjected to freezing ice. Only after countless kalpas do they escape the cycle of rebirth, only to be reborn as animals and endure slaughter. Such karmic retribution knows no end.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the four great perfected ones were filled with sorrow and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We implore your compassion to equally save and deliver them.”\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the perfected ones, saying:\n\n“Before the division of primordial chaos, prior to the Supreme Ultimate, there was the Primordial Dao Mother who transmitted to the Most High Mi Luo, the Radiant Heavenly Mysterious Origin, the Ancestral Qi of the Golden Wheel and the Lesser Sea’s Foundational Source. Born in a dream of sunlight on the twenty-eighth day of the moon’s cycle, he was the younger brother of the Purple Palace’s Eastern Florescence Sage. He established merit on Mount Changbai, received his title from the Fuxi Emperor, and was first known as the Perfected of Mount Taihua. During the Han, he became the Marshal of Mount Tai, and through successive dynasties, he was enfeoffed as the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak.\n\nHis qi responds to the Green Yang, his position reveres the Thunder trigram, and he alone resides in the central realm, governing the myriad spirits. He holds authority over the good and evil of the human world and oversees the judgments of right and wrong in the netherworld. He presides over seventy-two administrative bureaus, metes out punishments across thirty-six peaks, punishes the wicked, records deaths, and registers births. Transforming into the Four Peaks and the Four Heavenly Sacred Emperors, he nurtures the myriad beings of the Six Directions.\n\nIf there are good men and good women in the world who, upon encountering the Three Origins, Five La Festivals, the four seasons, eight solar terms, the Jiazi and Gengshen days, the third and seventh days of each month, the descent of the Dipper on their natal day, or the auspicious dawns of the new and full moons, are able to offer wealth and establish altars, abundantly present offerings, burn incense, light lamps, and sincerely pray, prostrating to the Eastern Florescence Supreme Minister, the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor, the Majestic and Free Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Peak, then the nation will know peace, the people will rejoice, wars will cease, and harvests will be abundant. The palace will be serene, and the imperial domain will be secure.\n\nExtending to the common people—men and women—their sins will be eradicated, disasters will be washed away, blessings will accrue, and their years will be prolonged. Their households will flourish, and their descendants will be numerous. In all their comings and goings, they will encounter only auspiciousness.\n\nThe deceased of the past will bypass hell, their sins and grievances dissolved, their enmities reconciled, and their sufferings healed. The Nine Dark Hells will cease their trials, the Five Sufferings will halt their punishments, and they will ascend to Heaven, enjoying boundless freedom and joy, uniting with the Dao. All sentient beings will attain the supreme.”\n\nThen he spoke the incantation:\n\n**First is the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak of Mount Tai.**\n**Azure Heaven of the Eastern Peak, wielding authority in Yanzhou.**\n**Above corresponding to the Chamber Mansion, below governing the Thunder trigram.**\n**Engendering the myriad beings, coeval with Heaven.**\n\nThe Mystic Numinous Abode, inscribed in the Azure Register.\nDelivering the living and ferrying the dead, bestowing blessings upon the state for eternal continuity.\n\n**Second is the Southern Peak Hengshan, Celestial Governor of Great Transformations, Radiant and Holy Emperor.**\n**Cinnabar Heaven of the Southern Peak, wielding authority in Hengzhou.**\n**Above corresponding to the Star Mansion, below illuminating the Fire trigram.**\n**Forging and molding the myriad forms, ensuring flourishing longevity.**\n\nThe Vermilion Palace, inscribed in the Scarlet Register.\nBurning away malevolence and evil, forever extinguishing the winds and mists.\n\n**Third is the Central Peak Songshan, Celestial Arbiter of Great Tranquility, Venerable and Holy Emperor.**\n**Yellow Heaven of the Central Peak, governing the mechanisms of Daizhou.**\n**Revolving the Four Mansions, singularly controlling Mount Feng.**\n**Encompassing the myriad existences, enduring through countless kalpas.**\n\nThe Mystic Capital Jade Palace, inscribed in the Jade Register.\nThe Five Numinous Spirits pacify and settle, slaying ten thousand demons.\n\n**Fourth is the Western Peak Huashan, Golden Heaven of Great Benefit, Favored and Holy Emperor.**\n**Luminous Heaven of the Western Peak, wielding authority in Huazhou.**\n**Above corresponding to the Pleiades, below stabilizing the Lake trigram.**\n**Nurturing and completing the myriad things, preserving life and prolonging years.**\n\nThe Golden Gate and Mystic Window, inscribed in the White Register.\nEstablishing the state and founding enterprises, defending the three frontiers.\n\n**Fifth is the Northern Peak Hengshan, Celestial Upholder of Great Primal Integrity, Holy Emperor.**\n**Mystic Heaven of the Northern Peak, wielding authority in Hengzhou.**\n**Above corresponding to the Void Mansion, below penetrating the Water trigram.**\n**Nourishing and flourishing the myriad harvests, enhancing life and increasing years.**\n\nThe Dark and Remote Primordial Terrace, inscribed in the Black Register.\nDelivering the corrupt to rebirth above, guiding beings to immortality.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nO Ancestor of the August Mystic and Dark Heaven, Founder of the Golden Wheel and Lesser Sea, Mother Mi of the Immortals who dreamed of sunlight, giving birth to the Purple Mansion’s Sage, Eastern Flower’s disciple—once establishing merit on Changbai, first enfeoffed by Fuxi, initially titled the Perfected of Taihua, Marshal of Mount Tai in the Han, August Emperor of Revered Grace in the Tang, in this sagely dynasty bestowed the title of Supreme Lord, presiding over Kun, whose merits parallel Qian, creating benevolence through virtue. With a benevolent hand, you turn the sun in your palm; with a sagely heart ever more sagely, you adorn the sun and moon in the heavens. The Five Peaks praise you in the East, the Three Realms revere you as supreme in the Middle Realm. Above, you carry out the Great Mandate; below, you inspect the Nether Bureau. You hold authority over human good and evil, inscribe the handle of life and death for the world. Punishing the wicked, you divide the thirty-six hells; overseeing fortune and misfortune, you adjudicate the seventy-two courts. Those who do good are recorded for rebirth in Heaven; the deluded are sought out by voice and saved. Manifesting the compassionate visage of the Venerable One, you open the gate of transformation for all beings. Your blessings equal Heaven, your merit immeasurable. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Benevolence, Supreme in the Middle Realm, Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak, whose radiant mercy saves the suffering, whose awe-inspiring power is sovereign and free—Celestial Worthy of Self-Mastery.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nHeaven’s Primal aligns with position, Earth’s virtue unites with form.\nPure qi shines brightly, the gentle spring harmonizes the Three Realms; virtuous kindness nurtures abundantly, the limpid autumn illumines the ten thousand directions.\nSharing brightness with the Sage, revered by all under Heaven—O Great Benevolence, Great Kindness, Great Purity, Great Luminosity, Right Consort of the Eastern Peak, August Empress of Pure Brightness and Earthly Virtue.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nCharged with assisting the Heavenly Fast, pillar of benevolent sagacity.\nProclaiming the edicts of the Azure Yang, wielding the scales of Mount Tai.\nAdorning the literary and martial, ranked as chief minister in the Peaks’ court; propagating the Emperor’s virtue, governing the people of the mortal world.\nExamining the loyal, upright, and sincere hearts; discerning the good, evil, treacherous, and perverse.\nO Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Wisdom, Great Sagacity, True Lord of Life’s Mandate, National Guardian of the Eastern Peak.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nSpirit divided into Three Qi, essence entrusted to the Nine Yangs. Wood and fire engender one another, thus transforming and completing the primordial origin; Heaven and Earth align in position, nurturing the refined qi of the numinous root. In nature blazing, descending blessings, auspiciousness, and fortune; in heart steadfast, broadening culture, martiality, and benevolence. Upholding the father’s awe-inspiring authority, embodying Heaven and enacting the Dao—O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Filial Piety, Great Benevolence, Supreme in the Eastern Peak’s Upper Hall, Crown Prince, Most Sagely, Illustrious Numen, Benevolent and Kind King.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nAtop Mount Tai’s summit, within the Eastern Peak’s Inner Palace—once manifesting as a Jade Maiden, her root essence the true form of the Emperor. Responding to the Nine Qi, she extends compassion and reveals her visage; crowned with the Hundred Spirits, her wisdom and kindness perfectly fused. Her deeds fill the ten directions, her grace spans countless kalpas. Her title is Rightful Heavenly Immortal; her investiture, Radiant Azure. Commanding the Peak’s divine soldiers, overseeing human good and evil, she answers cries and responds to pleas, protecting the state and pacifying the people. O Great Sage, Great Benevolence, Utmost Benevolence, Utmost Filial Piety, Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, Vast Numinous Kindness, Reverent, Compliant, Universally Ferrying, Life-Preserving Perfected—Great Protector of the State, Shelter of the People, Vast Virtue, Azure Radiance, Primordial Lady.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nThese two divine Perfected, united in one lineage—those who worthily receive their blessings are bestowed the Golden Pearl Register, the *Fu* Chapter of Blessings; those whose loyalty is inscribed with auspiciousness receive increased emoluments, the *Zengfu* Characters of Fortune. The Scarlet Register records good deeds; the Jade Treasury promotes merit. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Benevolence, Deities of the Peak’s Court who oversee the augmentation and bestowal of blessings.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\nDescendants of the Eastern Peak.\n\nBy decree of the Nine Heavens’ Bureau of Life-Monitoring, they bind the essence to form the embryo and, receiving the creative transformations of the Two Modes, deliver life and safeguard childbirth. These two sagely Perfected uphold the warp and woof, harmonizing yin and yang, dispersing pox and rashes. The Nine Heavens rejoice; they regard all with impartial grace. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Benevolence—Universally Ferrying, Universally Crossing, Nine Heavens’ Life-Monitoring Luminous Simplicity Perfected Lord; O Prolific in Sons and Daughters, Nine Heavens’ Chamber-Guarding Sagely Mother Primordial Lady.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\n\nBorn in Min lands, establishing merit in the South, studying the Dao and inquiring of the Way, receiving direct transmission from the Fifth Patriarch; seeking immortality and attaining it, employing straw figures in the Three Plowings. Guarding the sagely carriage upon the heart of Yangzi River, manifesting divine power upon the imperial barge of the Enlightened Sovereign. Renown resounds; sagely virtue is boundless. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Loyalty, Great Diligence—Divine Protector of Jiangdong, Venerable and Benevolent.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\n\nFierce generals of the prison courts, marshals and vice-commanders of the hosts. Crimson-haired, azure-faced, crowned with the iron hat of Three Mountains; clad in black robes, girded with sashes, wielding nine-jointed steel whips. Seizing souls and pursuing spirits, capturing life and consigning to death. Overseeing the reward of good and punishment of evil, scrutinizing faults and correcting wrongs. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Manifestation, Great Numinosity—Peak Court’s Manifestly Responsive Grand Guardian, Soul-Seizing Crimson General, Marshal and Vice-Commander of the Hosts.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we pay homage and bow:\n\nThe Seventy-Five Bureaus.\n\nBy decree, the deities of the eastern corridors and western wings, the Ten Great Guardians, attend at the hall’s fore; the Dragon and Tiger Divine Lords stand guard to left and right. Swiftly they report and respond, distinguishing good and evil along two paths. In the courts of yang and yin, they adjudicate the Three Teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, recording the merits of officials, generals, and ministers; determining the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death; distinguishing humans, ghosts, spirits, and demons; and the myriad beings born of womb, egg, moisture, and transformation. Every matter is referred to the clerks; each case belongs to the underworld officials. Their judgments never cease; their assessments never rest. O Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Forbearance, Great Benevolence—Peak Court’s Provincial and Departmental Clerks, Mount Tai’s Bureaucratic Officials.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning proclaimed this incantation and the Ten Titles. All the hosts of heaven and perfected beings universally extolled and revered them, exclaiming, “Excellent indeed!”\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy addressed the Four Perfected Ones, saying: “Whenever kings, emperors, empresses, palace attendants, prefectural and county magistrates, officials, and common people encounter the outbreak of warfare, the rise of bandits, locusts, droughts, floods, red rats swarming the cities, or rampant epidemics—if they recite this scripture, they shall attain peace throughout the realm, winds and rains in harmony, abundant harvests of the five grains, and a contented populace.\n\nIf one is imprisoned in shackles and fetters, long confined in dungeons—if they recite this scripture, they shall immediately receive pardon and be freed from their bonds.\n\nIf one is afflicted by baleful stars or chronic illness—if they recite this scripture, auspicious stars shall shine forth, and disasters and sufferings shall vanish.\n\nIf one seeks official rank or promotion, desiring to display merit and fame—if they recite this scripture, they shall attain advancement in emolument and position, ascending to high office.\n\nIf one is impoverished and suffering, praying for wealth and abundance—if they recite this scripture, they shall obtain ample riches, and clothing and food shall come naturally.\n\nIf one is childless, widowed, orphaned, or solitary—if they recite this scripture, the Nine Heavens shall rejoice, sending infants to be embraced, conceived, and born. They shall bear intelligent and elegant sons, ensuring descendants for generations without end.\n\nIf one’s household is in decline, assailed by malevolent spirits—if they recite this scripture, their gates shall flourish, and evil spirits shall vanish.\n\nIf one undertakes construction or divination, failing to meet an auspicious time and offending the earth deities or yearly spirits, causing chickens and dogs to behave strangely and calamities to arise—if they recite this scripture, the earth taboos shall return to their abodes, and the household shall enjoy peace.\n\nMoreover, if one suffers from grievances, curses, or malevolent hexes—if they recite this scripture, these shall be dissolved and dispelled.\n\nIf one travels, engages in commerce, or manages affairs—if they recite this scripture, their movements shall be harmonious, their journeys safe on water and land, their official paths unimpeded, and their endeavors successful.\n\nIf one recites this scripture for deceased parents, ancestors, relatives, or wandering souls, the departed shall attain rebirth in the Pure Lands and forever enjoy bliss.\n\nThose who recite this scripture must fast, bathe, don fresh clean garments, and sit upright to recite clearly. Then the benevolent deities of the Five Peaks shall advocate for them, and the hosts of the Ten Heavens shall protect them.\n\nFurthermore, if devout men and women earnestly pray and invite Orthodox Unity Daoist priests to recite this scripture—whether in temples, monasteries, or at home, lighting lamps and offering fruit, reciting ten times or even dozens or hundreds of times—their prayers shall be fulfilled as desired.\n\nIf one can relinquish wealth without reluctance, printing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of copies of this scripture according to their means, distributing them widely, and circulating them for recitation so all may know and hear—then the Sagely Emperors of the Five Peaks shall command the seventy-two civil and military officials, the sagely families of the Peak Court’s palaces, to protect and support those who print and distribute the scripture, bestowing blessings, prolonging life, dispelling misfortunes, and resolving past and present transgressions. The nation’s foundation shall endure, harvests shall be abundant, the living shall be at peace, and the departed shall transcend suffering.\n\nThis scripture’s merit and virtue are boundless. Its profound model expands; do not lightly disclose it. Be cautious.\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy again proclaimed the sagely lineage of the Peak, causing you to awaken, and spoke this verse:\n\nThe Formless, Nameless, Boundless Ancestor,\nAbstruse and dim, the numinous of Great Void.\nThe Perfectly Real, non-dual, naturally revered,\nSilently operates the Mysterious Origin, dwelling in the highest rank.\nGoverning the ten directions within a millet grain,\nPervading the eight extremities, embracing all beings.\nThe Jade Emperor of the Numinous Dao of the Void Sovereign,\nExpounding and transmitting the scripture, unfolding the profound model.\nThe Turning Dipper and Winnowing Basket traverse sun and moon,\nRadiance universally illuminating, boundlessly vast.\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign of Chaos descends to the mortal realm,\nThe Boundless Savior, Master of the Three Teachings.\nIn the West, Golden Immortals transform the Flowing Sands,\nIn the East, the Sage Confucius instructs through the ages.\nThirty-two hundred kalpas of cultivation,\nThe Pure and Serene Awakened King, the Tathāgata Buddha.\nThe Supreme Lord of Infinite Kalpas, the Maitreya Ancestor,\nThe Boundless and Immeasurable Great Heavenly Worthy.\nThe Supreme Mystery, the Non-Ultimate, and True Emptiness,\nPast, future, and present are as one.\nThe thirty-six heavens’ Heavenly Emperor Lords,\nAnd the countless realms’ true immortals, like the sands of the Ganges.\nSome dwell in the heavens, some among mortals,\nSome seclude themselves in the mountains among the immortals.\nDelivering the dead and saving the living without hindrance,\nResponding to conditions with unfathomable subtlety.\nIn other realms and this world, ever heeding the call,\nAcross the nine lands and three paths, ever rescuing from suffering.\nConcealed or revealed, transformations beyond measure,\nUnknown to immortals, mortals, buddhas, or sages.\nWith compassion manifesting forms as models,\nCountless sentient beings are all delivered.\nLifting from decay to rebirth through boundless kalpas,\nDispelling disasters and averting misfortunes beyond comprehension.\nRadiant light pervades the Dharma assembly,\nThe six destinies and nine netherworlds all attain liberation.\nAuspicious qi swirls, borne upon a jeweled chariot,\nPropitious light shines brilliantly, descending upon the jade altar.\nNow I bow in reverence and pay homage to the Peak Deity,\nWhose blessings extend through the three realms and ten directions.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy having spoken this verse, all present bowed their heads in devotion, prostrating and paying homage to:\n\nThe Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Primordial Sage Emperor of the Eastern Peak,\nThe Four Peaks’ Four Heavenly Sage Emperors and the Civil and Martial Lords of Mount Tai,\nThe Virtuous and Illustrious Empress of Earthly Virtue of the Eastern Peak’s Main Palace,\nThe Life-Commanding and State-Protecting True Lord, Minister of the Eastern Peak,\nThe Radiant and Benevolent Prince of the Eastern Peak’s Upper Palace,\nThe Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden of Azure Clouds of Mount Tai,\nThe Deities in Charge of Bestowing and Measuring Blessings of the Eastern Peak,\nThe Holy Mother of the Eastern Peak, Guardian of Offspring, Childbirth, and the Womb,\nThe Loyal and Protective, Revered and Benevolent Deity of Jiangdong,\nThe Marshal and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Peak’s Court,\nThe seventy-five officials of the Underworld Court and the attending officials.\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the Heavenly Emperors and Perfected Ones, saying: “Since all beings have earnestly taken refuge and repented their transgressions with utmost sincerity, all sentient beings shall equally partake in these blessings.” Thereupon, the Four Perfected Ones, having received this revelation, offered this hymn of praise:\n\nThe Azure Emperor, Lord of the Five Peaks,\nNurtures and fosters all living beings.\nGoverning seventy-two domains,\nAll things rely on him for life and growth.\nAs Lord of the Middle Realm,\nHe commands the host of immortals and perfected ones.\nAble to dissolve all sins,\nBoth the living and the dead share in his grace.\n\nAfter this hymn was presented, only misty Dharma clouds were seen, ascending back to the cinnabar heavens. All the heavenly immortals, filled with joy and exultation, bowed their heads in reverence and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.\n\nHere ends the *Mysterious Model Scripture of the Eastern Peak’s Transformations: Delivering the Living, Saving the Dead, Removing Sins, Resolving Grievances, and Protecting Life*.",

Also found in the *Daoist Canon Compendium*, Shi collection.)\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy resided within the Golden Gates of the Great Brahma Heaven, in the Jade Purity Sacred Realm’s Heavenly Palace. Ascending the Nine Radiance Treasure Throne, wielding the Five Brilliance Ruyi, he convened the myriad Heavenly Sovereigns, the sun, moon, and stellar hosts, and the boundless perfected immortals and sacred assemblies, all arrayed before the Dao.\n\nThen, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy emitted a great and vast sound, expounding the supreme, most true, and wondrous Dharma. Heavenly blossoms scattered in profusion, and jade-like incense wafted in coils.\n\nAmong the assembly were four great perfected ones: the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Golden Flower Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Jade Purity Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Wondrous Conduct Perfected, and the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Savior from Suffering Perfected. Each stepped forth from their ranks, knelt in reverence, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying:\n\n“We observe that within the world below, in the Nine Dark Hells, there are men and women of all ages who, though they have perished in the mortal realm, suffer from poverty, hardship, and distress; lingering illnesses; demonic and spectral afflictions; karmic transgressions and curses; misfortunes, disasters, and legal entanglements; years of poisonous harm; and untimely, violent deaths.\n\nWe further see that within the hells, the hungry ghosts and forsaken souls endure ceaseless torment day and night—blades on wheels, trees of swords, scorching flames, and freezing ice—without respite. Again, in the Blood Pool Hell, countless women endure myriad sufferings, unceasing day and night. Why do these two paths of beings suffer such differing karmic causes? We beseech the Heavenly Compassion to open wide the gate of expedient means and broadly reveal the path of cultivation.”\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy replied: “Return to your positions and listen carefully to the wondrous sound. I shall expound it all for you.\n\nThe beings of the world do not believe in the karmic retribution of good and evil. Some disrespect Heaven and Earth, are disloyal to their sovereigns, unfilial to their parents, and irreverent toward their teachers and elders. They defy divine principles, rebel against their brothers, relatives, neighbors, and friends, act duplicitously, and harbor deceit in their hearts. For all such transgressions, the divine officials and sacred assemblies of the Peak Prefecture have already recorded and examined their sins day and night, verifying their truth.\n\nThus, in their lifetimes, they suffer poverty, hardship, and distress; malignant diseases, sores, and poisons; epidemics and ailments; disasters and misfortunes; legal entanglements and imprisonment; demonic and spectral harm; years of unrelenting calamity; and an inability to find peace. Their households are plagued by misfortune, and they frequently encounter funerals and disasters. They may suffer from wars, fires, floods, locusts, famines, and banditry, rarely witnessing peace.\n\nAfter death, they forever descend into hell, sinking into the realm of hungry ghosts, where their bodies are dismembered, boiled in cauldrons, and subjected to freezing ice. Only after countless kalpas do they escape the cycle of rebirth, only to be reborn as animals and endure slaughter. Such karmic retribution knows no end.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the four great perfected ones were filled with sorrow and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: “We implore your compassion to equally save and deliver them.”\n\nThen the Primordial Heavenly Worthy again addressed the perfected ones, saying:\n\n“Before the division of primordial chaos, prior to the Supreme Ultimate, there was the Primordial Dao Mother who transmitted to the Most High Mi Luo, the Radiant Heavenly Mysterious Origin, the Ancestral Qi of the Golden Wheel and the Lesser Sea’s Foundational Source. Born in a dream of sunlight on the twenty-eighth day of the moon’s cycle, he was the younger brother of the Purple Palace’s Eastern Florescence Sage. He established merit on Mount Changbai, received his title from the Fuxi Emperor, and was first known as the Perfected of Mount Taihua. During the Han, he became the Marshal of Mount Tai, and through successive dynasties, he was enfeoffed as the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak.\n\nHis qi responds to the Green Yang, his position reveres the Thunder trigram, and he alone resides in the central realm, governing the myriad spirits. He holds authority over the good and evil of the human world and oversees the judgments of right and wrong in the netherworld. He presides over seventy-two administrative bureaus, metes out punishments across thirty-six peaks, punishes the wicked, records deaths, and registers births. Transforming into the Four Peaks and the Four Heavenly Sacred Emperors, he nurtures the myriad beings of the Six Directions.\n\nIf there are good men and good women in the world who, upon encountering the Three Origins, Five La Festivals, the four seasons, eight solar terms, the Jiazi and Gengshen days, the third and seventh days of each month, the descent of the Dipper on their natal day, or the auspicious dawns of the new and full moons, are able to offer wealth and establish altars, abundantly present offerings, burn incense, light lamps, and sincerely pray, prostrating to the Eastern Florescence Supreme Minister, the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor, the Majestic and Free Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Peak, then the nation will know peace, the people will rejoice, wars will cease, and harvests will be abundant. The palace will be serene, and the imperial domain will be secure.\n\nExtending to the common people—men and women—their sins will be eradicated, disasters will be washed away, blessings will accrue, and their years will be prolonged. Their households will flourish, and their descendants will be numerous. In all their comings and goings, they will encounter only auspiciousness.\n\nThe deceased of the past will bypass hell, their sins and grievances dissolved, their enmities reconciled, and their sufferings healed. The Nine Dark Hells will cease their trials, the Five Sufferings will halt their punishments, and they will ascend to Heaven, enjoying boundless freedom and joy, uniting with the Dao. All sentient beings will attain the supreme.”\n\nThen he spoke the incantation:\n\n**First is the Great Life Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak of Mount Tai.**\n**Azure Heaven of the Eastern Peak, wielding authority in Yanzhou.**\n**Above corresponding to the Chamber Mansion, below governing the Thunder trigram.**\n**Engendering the myriad beings, coeval with Heaven.**",
