  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Central Yellow Perfected Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Central Yellow Perfected Scripture*. Also known as *The Central Yellow Scripture*, *The Embryonic Treasury Treatise*, and *The Embryonic Treasury Central Yellow Scripture*. Attributed to the Nine Immortals Lord, annotated by the Central Yellow Perfected One. Two fascicles.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (洞神部, Methods Category).\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. *Daoist Canon Compendium* edition, included in the final collection, first fascicle (hereafter *Compendium Edition*).\n2. *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* edition, included in fascicle thirteen.\n\n---\n\n### **Exegesis on the *Central Yellow Scripture***\n\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* is also called *The Embryonic Treasury Treatise*. This treatise was compiled by the Nine Immortals Lord, the Yellow Perfected One. The Perfected One often observed the primordial blackness, which coalesced into form through vast and serene concentration. It was nurtured by the five viscera, corresponding to the five phases; illumined by the seven apertures, mirroring the seven luminaries to reveal clarity. Its consciousness lay latent in germination, its spirit spread in motion. It pacified the hun and embraced the po, and when the spirit was sufficient, life arose. Form and spirit entrusted one another; spirit and form perfected each other.\n\nYet the mouth receives external flavors and forgets awareness; the body endures internal labors and loses essence. When spirit departs from form, it scatters and decays; when form parts from spirit, life departs. Little do they know that skin and flesh respond to one another, and only then do sinews and bones take shape. The liver connects to sinews and manifests in the nails; the heart connects to vessels and manifests in complexion; the spleen connects to flesh and manifests in the lips; the lungs connect to skin and manifest in the hair; the kidneys connect to bones and manifest in the hair. All injure the sinews; bitterness injures the bones; sweetness injures the flesh; acridity injures qi; sourness injures the blood.\n\nThus, the sage says: First eliminate desires to nourish essence; later abstain from grain to preserve life. It is known that consuming embryonic blackness and drinking numinous primordiality is the Dao of immortality, the way to revert to youth and restore years. This is what the sage holds in highest regard.\n\nMoreover, when one scholar is single-minded, he studies the lower to reach the higher; when one man is intent, he perceives that the Dao of Heaven is not distant. To learn without attainment is called foolishness; to not learn and remain ignorant is called benightedness. Yet when the three worms have not departed, one treads the thorny fields of suffering; when the three worms have perished, one naturally arrives in the land of Huaxu. The cloud paths are revealed, and the embryonic immortals are fully expounded. Knowing the root of the sagely practice, discerning the honored ranks of the immortals—such as the rosy clouds’ feathered robes, the jade pavilions and celestial kitchens—is but a manifestation for the aspiring scholar, a slight disclosure of Heaven’s precepts. It is no reckless revelation; calamity will be your clear proof.\n\nThis sagely gate is secret; only by it may one ascend the cloud paths. Take care not to transmit it to the shallow of learning, and swear never to display this text lightly! Arrogance severs the spirit; frivolous speech shortens life. If one is not a scholar of resolve, let them not speak of it openly.\n\nIn total, eighteen chapters are arranged into one fascicle, titled *The Embryonic Treasury Central Yellow Scripture*. Each chapter links to the next by theme, and each sentence follows in succession. Its meaning is refined in the perfection of the Dao; its words exhaust the art of nurturing life. Its conduct is manifest and intent direct; its affairs are complete and its text precise. The principles of consuming blackness are fully expounded; the path of returning to Heaven is entirely achieved. Taking up the brush to record these chapters, the text is set forth below.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Clarity Central Yellow Perfected Scripture, Fascicle One**\n**By the Nine Immortals Lord, Annotated by the Central Yellow Perfected One**\n\n#### **Chapter One: Nurturing Form and Spirit Internally**\n\n\"Nurturing form and spirit internally eliminates cravings.\" To nurture form and spirit internally and eliminate cravings is to realize the true form of no-form.\n\nThe Supreme Lord said: The true Dao nurtures the spirit; the false dao nurtures the form. Guide the numinous valley’s primordial spirit into the Celestial Valley, securely seal the root, and nurture it thus.\n\nAs stated in the *Great Cavern Scripture*: Humans possess thirty-nine passes, and this Celestial Valley cavity is the first pass. The Supreme Lord said: If you guard the self within the Pass of Death and Decay, the withered bones of your seven ancestors will all attain a realm of life. Thus, it is said: nurture form and spirit internally and eliminate cravings.\n\nThe *Cavern Primordial Scripture* states: The Dao of cultivation begins by eliminating cravings and internally harmonizing with the five spirits. Next, one should abstain from grain, the heart unmoved, the six viscera like a candle. Constantly practicing this Dao, form and spirit naturally stabilize. Focus on stillness and quiescence, and the body will become like jade. When spirit interacts with things, the heart resembles the Great Void. Securely anchoring the root, stillness and quiescence arise naturally.\n\nThe human heart stirs myriad thoughts, moved by external things. Always dwell in stillness, desiring not to mingle with the crowd. Internally sever thoughts; externally sever desires. Constantly abide by this Dao, and primordial breath will be self-sufficient.\n\nOnly by consuming primordial blackness and eliminating the five grains—\nPeople commonly regard the five grains as nourishment for the flesh, unaware that the five grains excessively harm the body. Choose the third month of spring, arrange a cool chamber, set up a desk and chair, and lay thick, warm mats. Continuously burn fine incense on the desk. At the first emergence of blackness after midnight, calm the heart and spirit, then click the teeth thirty-six times. Clench both hands firmly, tilt the head back, and close the eyes. When the regular breath is exhaled, close the mouth, fill it with air, and swallow according to the method. Upon entering the abdomen, one should feel a sound; cease when satiated, and swallow again if hungry. Simply consume it calmly, without fear.\n\nAfter the blackness enters, if the mouth feels dry, drink two or three sips of sesame soup, as this substance nourishes breath and moistens the abdomen. The method for the soup: Take three large sheng of the finest black sesame, remove the husks, steam and sun-dry it nine times. Also take three liang of the finest poria. Grind them finely into powder. First add the sesame powder and boil it three or four times, then add the poria powder and boil it several more times, adding a small amount of ghee and honey. When thirsty, drink one or two cups; this not only quenches thirst but also curbs the desire for food. Alternatively, consume seasonal wolfberry soup, drinking one or two cups at a time, which also benefits the throat and breath, naturally facilitating smoothness.\n\nOnce the abdomen feels harmonious, the throat and breath will flow smoothly. Then, all soups and waters will naturally become unnecessary, and one will gradually comprehend the wondrous principle. Simply by consuming breath to attack the obstructions in the abdomen, the intestinal waste will be entirely expelled, as if entering water that flows directly below the navel.\n\nWhen first consuming qi, if one notices the urine turning yellow or dark, do not be alarmed. If the chest and heart feel restless, there is no need for fear. Simply remain steadfast and unwavering in the heart, and the wondrous principle will naturally be attained. If one does not abstain from soups and waters, even if the waste in the abdomen and intestines is entirely expelled, one will never fully comprehend right and wrong. To cease consuming grains and water depends solely on one’s own resolve and perseverance; there is no fixed time limit—some may achieve this in a month, others in fifty days, or even a hundred. For those who abstain from soups and waters, the Three Elixir Fields will naturally fill in succession. After thirty days, the Lower Elixir Field is full. After sixty days, the Middle Elixir Field is full. After ninety days, the Upper Elixir Field is full.\n\nWhen the Lower Elixir Field is full, black qi suffices, and the organs no longer feel hunger. When the Middle Elixir Field is full, qi fills the body, leaving no weakness or emaciation. When the Upper Elixir Field is full, it congeals, bestowing a radiant complexion, plump skin, and harmony in the Triple Burner. All thoughts vanish, the spirit congeals, the body becomes clear, and one finally discerns right and wrong. When the Lower Elixir Field is full, the spirit and qi do not leak. When the Middle Elixir Field is full, one’s steps become light and swift. When the Upper Elixir Field is full, the complexion becomes exceptionally beautiful. Once all three regions are replete, the body naturally attains peace and the Dao flourishes, allowing one to dwell in the sacred realm and embrace the breath of the embryonic immortal. This is the wondrous gateway of dedicated qi consumption and the supreme path to immortality. If one alternates between eating and abstaining, the will falters. Craving various flavors makes it difficult to expel grain qi. This is what dedicated qi consumption detests and the great obstacle to attaining immortality.\n\nThe scriptures say: *Salty, sweet, pungent, and sour flavors sicken the five organs; savory tastes dull the heart’s mirror. They cause the six bowels’ spirit and qi to decline, leaving the hundred bones and nine orifices bereft of numinous power.* If one can steadfastly guard against and abstain from all flavors and desires, after ninety days, the Three Elixir Fields will congeal and solidify. After a hundred days, the five organs can be observed internally. After three hundred days, ghosts and demons cannot conceal their forms, and yin spirits dare not deceive. After a thousand days, one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register, and one’s form enters the Great Subtlety. One will surely attain the True Record of the Liao Heaven and ascend through refinement, becoming an immortal official of the Lower Heaven. If one cultivates the Dao of the Three Ones by contemplating the formless black spirit, one becomes an immortal official of the Upper Heaven. If a true adept masters embryonic breathing, one attains the True Record of the Liao Heaven, where a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders welcome the adept, who then assumes the rank of a True Lord of the Middle Heaven.\n\nFor a hundred days, one must single-mindedly consume qi to sufficiency—this means the Three Elixir Fields are not yet full. Some consume qi and swallow mist, claiming it brings rest and ease, but this is no overnight achievement. First, one must protect the body with virtue and conduct, then eliminate the yin thieves and true wrath. This is the resolve of one who studies the Dao. If the yin thieves are not expelled and the Three Worms not eradicated, or if one engages in improper teachings, success will never be attained.\n\nThus, *The Mysterious Chapter of the Great Subtlety* states: *Abandon desires, relinquish arrogance, harmonize the five organs, and the spirit will be sufficient.* **Chapter Two: The Profound Subtlety of Consuming Qi**\n\nThe profound subtlety of consuming qi encompasses five matters. The term \"profound subtlety\" refers to the wondrous principle of non-action. The five matters concern the transformation of the hun and po and the stirring of the Three Corpses when one learns to abstain from grains. Yet the great essentials remain unknown. If one’s inner conduct is not yet perfected, one will not recognize the various demonic obstructions, dismissing the Dao and its methods as ineffective—this is merely a failure to grasp the true principle. If one first cultivates inner benevolence and virtue, merely consuming fluids will bring peace and harmony; how much more so when consuming qi!\n\nFirst, when one initially consumes qi, its power is still weak. At the outset, consuming qi may cause stagnation. After seven or fourteen days, impurities are expelled, and one gradually feels the body’s emptiness and weakness, with all joints lacking strength—do not be surprised. This is because the primordial qi has not yet reached the stomach and abdomen, hence the sense of frailty. Simply swallow qi, allowing it to flow smoothly, growing stronger day by day. One must remain resolute and steadfast, awaiting the Lower Elixir Field’s sufficiency, at which point hunger and thirst vanish entirely. If one has not yet attained this, the skin and complexion may appear sallow and emaciated—do not fear, for later one will become robust and vigorous. If one lacks single-minded devotion and continues to eat, exerting oneself in movement, there will be no effect, and repeated failures will ensue. This is the fate of those who lack inner conduct. If attachments and distractions linger in the heart, one brings about one’s own downfall. One must constantly remain resolute and steadfast, awaiting the moment when qi resides in the Lower Elixir Field, gradually filling it to sufficiency.\n\nOnce the Lower Elixir Field is full of qi, hunger and thirst vanish forever. If one fears weakness, emaciation, or sallowness, one cannot cultivate. If one abstains from grains and water, over time, vigor and robustness will naturally arise. One must guide the heart to govern this process.\n\n*The Great Mystery Scripture* states: *There are many paths to rest and ease, but in studying the Dao, even nine years is too brief for success.* Only by consuming qi, steadfastly enduring a hundred days, and abstaining from all soups and waters—without wavering in the heart—will the Three Corpses be eradicated, and failure avoided. It is only because students’ minds are unsettled, lingering in doubt, that their spirits waver, the Three Corpses arise, and a hundred thoughts emerge, making it difficult to return to the heart’s path. Even if one consumes qi, it is easy to regress, and one remains as unenlightened as a wooden bell.\n\nSecond, what distinguishes grain from qi? Grain qi is difficult to retain and easily leaks. If one wishes to swiftly guide qi to the five organs, one must abstain from soups, waters, and medicinal substances for forty-nine days, expelling all waste from the small intestine. Grain qi will naturally cease, and swallowed qi will flow smoothly. Some fail because their minds waver, alternating between eating and abstaining, thus bringing about their own downfall. Consuming even small amounts of flavors makes it difficult to expel grain qi. To employ qi and clearly perceive the internal organs, one must consume this primordial qi. After fifty days of abstaining from all foods, close the eyes and inwardly visualize qi arising from the heart within the spleen organ, dispersing to the four limbs. Recite the external incantation: *\"Central Wu and Ji, the inner organs hold primordial emptiness.\"*\n\nThe yellow qi is strong and firm; when circulated, it can be regulated. Do not reject the cinnabar yang; let the vermilion clouds deliberate together. When it reaches the four limbs, great yellow clouds arise. Each day at the fifth watch, when the hawk first cries, regularly await this moment without fail. After twenty-seven days of such practice, inwardly perceive the spleen organ where dark qi gathers densely like yellow clouds penetrating the four limbs. Thereafter, this qi can extinguish candles and blow out fires from a hundred paces away, as if a great wind arises. It can summon yellow clouds to conceal one’s form, rendering one invisible to others. If one does not adhere to the fifth watch’s beginning or fails to persist steadfastly—even missing a single day—there will be no effect. This is the method of sealing the central yellow and closing the black.\n\nIf the body is weak and the heart timid, or if the organs are depleted and strength deficient, the qi may fail to reach the four limbs, resulting in signs of weakness. Yet one must remain resolute and not succumb to fear. Thus, the *Great Cavern Scripture* states: *\"Hold fast as at the beginning, and the Dao’s attainment will be more than sufficient.\"*\n\nThe third is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain palace. The *Mysterious Formulae of the Cavern Spirit* states: *\"The upper worm resides in the upper cinnabar field, which is the brain and heart.\"* Its color is white with a tinge of blue, and it is called Pengju. It causes one to crave flavors, indulge in desires, and become dull and stagnant. Those who cultivate the Dao should restrain it. Even if one has not yet ceased consuming the five grains, by maintaining this mind and sustaining the practice for over a year, the upper corpse will naturally perish, and success may still be achieved. Those who do not grasp the profound mystery and merely abstain from the five grains—yet fail to eliminate the mind of craving and desire—how can they extinguish the three corpse-worms? Myriad distractions arise in unison to shake the heart. Constantly longing for endless flavors of food and drink, thoughts stir and the countenance of illness grows. Those who study the Dao, if they do not attain inner conduct to support body and mind, will instead be deluded and disturbed by the three corpse-worms.\n\nThe fourth is the middle worm, dwelling in the heart palace. The *Mysterious Formulae of the Cavern Spirit* states: *\"The middle worm is named Pengzhi. Its color is white with a tinge of yellow, and it resides in the middle cinnabar field. It causes one to covet wealth, indulge in joy and anger, and pollute the true emptiness, allowing the three corpses to transform and the seven po to drift astray.\"* Thus, the *Cavern Mystery Scripture* states: *\"Without joy, without anger, the three worms greatly fear; without food, without desire, harmonious qi is ever sufficient. Sit and behold the primordial yang, and the ten thousand spirits will gather.\"* It sends forth dreams to scatter the spirit and soul, wandering without fixed direction—now fragrant, now beautiful, now advancing, now retreating—making constancy difficult to maintain. The spirit becomes confused and erratic, as if mad, causing one’s practice to fail and thoughts to take root in delusion. If you know this, the Dao will naturally flourish. Remain serene and unchanging, and the Dao will naturally endure.\n\nThe fifth is the lower worm, dwelling in the abdomen and stomach. The lower corpse is white and black in color, named Peng Jiao, residing in the lower cinnabar field. It causes one to love fine clothing and indulge in wine and sensual pleasures. Those who study the Dao must inwardly recognize and firmly restrain it—then the corpse-ghosts will be powerless to act, and failure will be averted. Let your mind abide in blandness, ever without flavor. By constantly guarding blandness, the three corpses will naturally perish. Once the three corpses are gone, thoughts and worries will vanish forever.\n\nWhen still, the heart grows solitary and prone to melancholy; when disturbed, the heart becomes vexed and anger arises frequently. When one first ingests the elixir before its flow is unobstructed, the three corpse-worms stir and disrupt, sometimes causing excessive joy or anger, sometimes deep sorrow or longing, or indulgence in desires and rich flavors. This leads one astray, losing the essence of principle. If you can guard against this, the three worms will depart.\n\nThe *Scripture of Supreme Mystery on Ascending the Dao* states: *\"If you ingest the elixir, fast resolutely, and maintain a steadfast heart for one month, one worm will depart on its own, and the second will have no place to dwell.\"* If one can ingest only the elixir, remain firm in resolve, and guard it for thirty days, the upper worm will die; for sixty days, the middle worm will die; for ninety days, the lower worm will die. After a hundred days, if the heart does not waver, the body will naturally be robust and healthy, the spirit clear—forever without decline. But if one alternates between eating and fasting, the will weakens, and all effort is in vain. One must hold fast.\n\nThen you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine Perfected Elixir. The Five Sprouts are the true qi of the Five Phases, born within the five viscera. The Nine Perfected are the Dao of the Nine Heavens. When these Five Qi are complete, they correspond to the Nine Heavens—thus the qi of the five viscera is named after the Nine Heavens. When the primordial qi is complete, one naturally gains clarity of the Five Phases’ qi, and there is no obstruction in its flow.\n\n**The Third Chapter: The Five Sprouts Abhor Impurities**\nThe Five Sprouts abhor pungent, bitter, and sour flavors. If the five flavors are not cut off, the numinous qi of the five viscera will not arise, and thoughts of desire will never cease. One may suppress thoughts of desire and abstain from grains and external flavors—then what worry is there that the Five Qi will not arise? Once the Five Qi arise, the five emotions flow smoothly; when the five viscera are full, the primordial qi naturally congeals. When the primordial qi congeals, the Five Spirits manifest; when the Five Spirits manifest, one fully comprehends the good and evil of the human world—what worldly concerns could then entangle you?\n\nYet the three worms still lie in wait within you, the corpse-ghosts sit awaiting your death. How can you remain at ease without fear? The three corpse-ghosts always desire a person’s early demise, seeking faults within the body. Every Gengshen day, they ascend to report to the Controller of Destinies. Without vigilance or early cultivation of body and spirit, without cutting off the five flavors, one’s years will decline, qi will wane, body and spirit wither—possessing only the resolve of pine and bamboo, yet never achieving fruition. When life ends one day, what regret will be too late?\n\nI urge you to set aside worldly affairs and focus your heart on ingesting the elixir. The essential method requires stillness, holding fast to heart and spirit, ceasing all distractions—then the three corpses will perish on their own, the elixir will circulate, and all will naturally become clear. The Five Spirits will be at peace—this is the wondrous principle.\n\n**Attaining Transcendence with Cloud-and-Mist Resolve**\nBy purifying and cooling the spirit and elixir, the will naturally becomes bright and luminous, transcending all with profound insight, as if the scenery of mist and clouds lies before your eyes.\n\n**The Fourth Chapter: Cloud-and-Mist Refines the Will**\nCloud-and-mist now refines the will, penetrating the mysteries of the spirit. If the elixir of grains is eliminated, all channels will naturally become clear, the numinous light of the five viscera will transform and arise, and one will roam freely in boundless profundity. This numinous light is the spirit-elixir. It allows you to sit and know the path of life and death. If you can cut off all flavors, after a hundred days, you will understand all things. You will naturally perceive the hidden workings of the many spirits, fully witness the paths of life and death, and survey the ways of the netherworld beyond the heavens—this is true knowledge.\n\nSteaming the sinews and exposing the bones, the elixir penetrates all gates; grasping firmly, it silently flows through the hundred apertures. As the *Perfect Principle of Embryonic Breathing Scripture* states: *\"For those who ingest the elixir, even if grains are not yet fully cut off, whenever the sunlight is clear and the time bright, at noon, enter a quiet chamber, spread a soft mat, loosen the hair, lower the pillow, grasp firmly beside the ribs, click the teeth seven times, calm the heart, and close the eyes. When you feel a slight stirring, you must exert force to close the gates, grasp firmly, and gradually allow the sinews and vessels to relax and open, letting the numinous elixir silently flow between bone and flesh, moistening the skin from within. By repeatedly practicing this, you will naturally attain a radiant complexion, doubled elixir strength, hair as if washed with lacquer, and whiskers like black silk. If you do not understand how to close the elixir and refine the body, circulating the primordial without flow or moisture upon the skin, you will never attain freedom. If the elixir flows through the hair, the temples will naturally leap and dance. Without this method, even if you abstain from grains and attain long life, you will be like tiles, stones, grass, or wood—lacking spiritual radiance.\"*\n\n**The Fifth Chapter: The Hundred Apertures and Interconnected Gates**\nThe hundred apertures are all connected to spirits. The hundred apertures connect to the hundred cavities, and the hundred cavities connect to the hundred vessels. Above the eyes are two cavities, linked to the liver vessels. The liver vessels connect to the heart—thus when the heart grieves, tears flow. Above the cheeks are two cavities, linked to the nasal vessels, which connect to the heart vessels—thus when the heart grieves, the nose turns sour. The nasal vessels further connect to the brain vessels—thus when the brain is hot, the nose dries.\n\nThe *Scripture of Mysterious Luminosity and Hidden Treasures* states: *\"The hundred vessels flow together, the hundred apertures mutually arise, the hundred gates interlock, and the hundred joints connect.\"* Thus, if one aperture is blocked, a hundred illnesses arise; if one vessel is obstructed, a hundred channels fall into chaos. Therefore, ingesting the elixir ensures no illness, and all vessels flow freely. The Daoist does not die—this is because nothing lingers in the stomach and abdomen.\n\nDiscerning fortune and misfortune, the hundred spirits gather within the body; cold and heat do not approach, as the primordial elixir is harmonized within. No poisons assail, for the numinous spirits of the five viscera firmly guard.\n\nThe fierce beasts do not strike, the land naturally defends itself, and one moves freely between concealment and revelation—bone and flesh unite with the Mysterious Female. Coming and going without obstruction, nothing fails to flow through, and one naturally attains the true Dao. Why fear failing to align with sagely wisdom? Through this, expel all and return it to my body.\n\nThe hundred joints and nine apertures each house their spirits. When the viscera and bowels are free of evil *qi*, the harmonious *qi* flourishes, and the ten thousand spirits gather. The evil elixir is none other than the *qi* of grain. If the true *qi* circulates freely, all sores, scars, blemishes, and malevolent *qi* naturally vanish. Serenely attaining self-illuminating truth, one gains penetrating insight, clearly discerning the categories of evil and upright. The self-illuminating true Dao endures forever.\n\nGovern form and spirit at the gate of deathlessness, and ascend your body above the nine heavens.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Dao of Enduring Existence**\nThe Dao of enduring existence arises from focused resolve. With concentrated essence and intent, one may penetrate sagely principles. The three *hun* souls return, knowing no death. After *qi* flows freely, one should naturally bear the body—this is the path of the luminous spirits’ immortality.\n\nWhat is the grievance of the seventy-seven measures? After the elixir dregs are exhausted and grain is forsaken, the greatest effort lies in the forty-nine days. Gradually, the hundred vessels become thoroughly open, reflection shines like a candle, worldly thoughts are suddenly cast aside, and the five viscera grow tranquil. If one does not persevere, all prior efforts are abandoned—how can they be regained? In the end, one will not achieve the Dao!\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Perils of Salty, Sweet, Spicy, and Sour**\n\nFirmly and cautiously guard against the flavors of sour and salty. Those who partake of such tastes find it difficult to dispel grain-*qi*. The salty, sweet, spicy, and sour—these five flavors sicken the five viscera. When savory tastes enter the teeth, they cloud the mind’s realm. For whenever the five flavors pass through the teeth, they all flow into the cavities of the two eyes, scattering and permeating the hundred vessels, causing grain-*qi* to harden and solidify, lingering in the organs and bowels. Those who seek swift attainment must resolutely sever them. This leads to the decline of the six bowels’ spirit-*qi*, leaving the hundred bones and nine orifices dull and unrefined. For when spirit-*qi* fails to congeal within the cinnabar field and luminous radiance does not illuminate the organs and bowels—\n\nIf you can guard this vigilantly for a hundred days, all vessels will become as clear as a polished mirror. When your efforts span a full hundred days, spirit-*qi* will naturally solidify, and luminous radiance will blaze like a torch, leaving nothing obstructed. The bright spirits of the six bowels will no longer hide, speaking to you and revealing the mind’s realm. The spirits of the five viscera will manifest of their own accord.\n\nYet if the path of your spiritual work is hindered, the greatest obstacle lies in grain-solidity. If grain-*qi* is not eliminated, you will never perceive the profound and mysterious principle. But if you can sever both grain and water, you will naturally reach the mysterious realm.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Essence of Grain-Solidity**\n\nThe essence of grain-solidity stands apart from the numinous, entangling the six bowels and clouding the vessels. The refined essence of grain transforms into viscous membranes, coiling around the five viscera, six bowels, joints, and sinews—thus obscuring true knowledge. Even those who ingest the elixir, after fifty or sixty days, may see the dregs in their intestines and stomachs exhausted and assume nothing else remains. Yet they do not realize that the essence of grain-*qi* has yet to depart. This gives rise to cravings, scattered thoughts, and shifting emotions, with the heart suspended in unbearable longing—this is the calamity stirred by corpse-demons.\n\nThereafter, substances may emerge resembling pus or blood, or like decayed intestinal fat, or like the droppings of hawks or ducks—these are the signs of grain-*qi* preparing to exit. After another twenty or thirty days, strange matter may appear, like saliva or membranes—this is the form of grain-solidity’s essence. If one had previously combined grain consumption with elixir ingestion, sometimes abstaining, sometimes severing, or practicing intermittently for over a year before suddenly ceasing, the effects may manifest differently, and the absence of such signs should not be deemed unusual. For without grain-*qi*, *qi* flows freely through the hundred vessels, and reflection shines as brightly as a candle.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Those who first ingest the elixir may feel the dregs and filth in their intestines purged, seeing only the broths and water they consume swirling in the stomach and abdomen, with no other matter present—unaware that grain-*qi* is still departing. Once grain-*qi* is fully severed, there will be no further thoughts or yearnings, the body and spirit will grow tranquil, the organs and bowels will rest in peace, and there will be no afflictions of longing, solitude, or emaciation. Should you encounter solitude or frailty, do not fear and retreat, nor harbor doubts about progress. Reflect carefully and do not withdraw.\n\nIf, after abruptly severing broths and water for thirty days, even the slightest doubt or hesitation arises, and your resolve wavers, you will never succeed. It is like digging a well through mud, seeing water yet failing to draw it—how bitter! How grievous! How utterly agonizing!\n\nAlas, how grievous! Where can the primordial *qi* return if it does not revert? How can one fathom what the heart has not grasped? If grain-*qi* is not expelled from the organs and bowels, primordial *qi* will not descend into the *dantian*. Thus, the Daoist remains benighted, unaware that the divine work lies near—take heed!\n\nHow lamentable! The twelve towers of the Mysterious Palace—who knows they may revert to the dwelling of the Three Worms? If one does not cultivate and refine body and spirit, the chambers within the body all become lairs for the Three Worms.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Three Worms’ Dwelling**\nThe Three Worms dwell within the three parts,\nEver abiding in the Three *Dantian*.\nIf you can master their workings, what fear of death?\nBut follow the sages’ words, apply the mind in cultivation—what worry of calamity or misfortune befalling you!\n\nDense and stagnant, they ever reside here,\nYet if primordial *qi* is not drawn inward, once it circulates through the body,\nUpper and lower harmonize, and it returns again to the Three *Dantian*.\nThen one discerns the Primordial Harmony and the Nine Immortal *Qi*.\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Nine Immortal True *Qi***\nThe Nine Immortal True *Qi* ever abides in numinous clarity,\nOnce the Three Worms die, peace is restored.\nAs *The Great Cavern Scripture* states: “When the Three Corpses perish, the spirit naturally flourishes. Within a hundred days, one may command spirits and illuminate the five viscera, making them as divine as the sages.”\n\nShould one dwell in the world as a hidden wanderer, the method is fully expounded in the *Embryonic Breathing* chapter.\nThrough your movement and breath, life is born—\nWhen spirit-*qi* is abundant, breath and movement summon clouds and mist, naturally achieving concealment without hindrance.\n\nResiding within the *dantian*, it glows faintly,\nFor those who refine *qi* to completion, the *dantian*’s *qi* becomes steady and full, ascending and descending through the Three *Dantian*, congealing like a fledgling hawk, radiant as candlelight, illuminating miles without fail—such is the wonder of the *dantian*’s spirit-*qi*.\n\nSinews and bones grow robust, the body harmonious.\nAs *The Three Luminaries Scripture* states: “Refine the marrow like frost, transmute the bones like steel. After a thousand days of refinement, strength doubles, enabling one to travel a thousand miles in a day, outpacing galloping horses—such is the state of divinity.”\n\nThe numinous awareness remains serene, emotions flow freely,\nThoughts are at ease, the spirit soars, the heart’s radiance shines.\nFor those whose *qi* is fully replete, the heart-spirit is ever joyful, emotions lofty, thoughts free—detached from the vulgar world.\n\nThe five flavors reek of foulness,\nOne sees the dregs and filth in flavors, smells the stench in fragrances, seeks roots from sprouts—such is the sign of Daoist attainment.\nThis arises naturally, for celestial *qi* permeates the body—all who reach this stage perceive it thus.\n\nThe skin grows firm and fair, sinews and bones pure.\nThe *Embryonic Breathing* chapter contains the method for refining bones in full.\n\nThe underworld erases one’s register, heaven records one’s name,\nSeated, one surveys the netherworld, commanding spirits—\nWhen embryonic breathing is achieved, the Dao is naturally perfected.\nFor those who refine *qi* to completion, the underworld’s spirits will serve them.\nIf one enters embryonic breathing and reaches a hundred breaths, the body enters a wondrous realm, the earthly register is erased;\nAt a thousand breaths, the Three Heavens record one’s rank, the soul roams the upper realms.\n\n*Upper Scroll of the* **True Scripture of the Central Yellow of Grand Clarity** *concludes*\n*Lower Scroll of the* **True Scripture of the Central Yellow of Grand Clarity**\n\nThe Nine Immortals Lord composed, Central Yellow Perfected One annotated\n**Chapter Eleven: The Embryonic Breathing of the True Immortals**\n\nThe true immortals of embryonic breathing ingest blackness and attain it; closing off true *qi*, they perfect embryonic breathing.\nThe *Scripture on Ingesting Qi* states: \"After a hundred days, the five viscera are spiritually refined—only then may one enter embryonic breathing.\"\nThe *Divine Scripture of the Nine Heavens* states: \"First, one must be in a sealed chamber without wind, with thick, soft felt mats. The pillow should be four fingers high, level with the body. Engage a like-minded companion of the Dao, relinquish mundane thoughts, clench the fists, lie supine, free the mind of attachments, and detach from external distractions. Gradually close off the numinous *qi*, and the heart’s awareness will become serene. Initially, close for ten breaths, then fifteen, twenty, up to a hundred breaths—only then will the body feel as though it remains in one place, as if within a chamber, so long as the heart does not waver.\n\nIn a single day and night, the twelve hours total thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Thus, the *Scripture of the Ascension to the Mysterious* states: 'Black severance is death; black closure is immortality.' The *po* remains to guard the body, while the *hun* roams the heavens above. If closure does not reach a hundred breaths, the *hun*-spirit will perceive the *po*—for it is a yin spirit. The *hun* is a yang spirit, yet the yin spirit constantly desires man’s death, not his life. This spirit appears as seven figures clad in black robes, wearing black crowns, and bearing black tablets.\" The *Scripture of the Cavernous Divine* states: \"It is called the Mysterious Mother.\" This spirit governs the yin corpse. Should you see this spirit, you must concentrate your mind and recite the incantation:\n\n*Mysterious Mother, Mysterious Mother,*\n*Guardian of my corpse,*\n*Nourish my bones and tendons,*\n*Do not depart from my body—*\n*Ascend with my Hun-Father to the heavens.*\n\nNext, you will see the Hun-Father: three figures, each one foot and five inches tall, clad in vermilion robes, wearing vermilion crowns, and bearing vermilion tablets. They will lead you to the Upper Prime Palace to meet the myriad brain spirits—over a hundred will emerge from your body. You will then see the primordial *qi* in the Three Elixir Fields, resembling white clouds, its radiance illuminating all. You must then call the names of the three *hun*:\n\nFirst, *Scintillating Spirit*;\nSecond, *Embryonic Light*;\nThird, *Hidden Essence*.\n\nOnce these three *hun* of yang spirit lead the brain palace’s countless spirits, your primordial spirit will roam the upper heavens. As you depart, you will feel your body emerge from the chamber of *qi*. You may witness various forms of ghosts and spirits—some towering several *zhang*, others as small as swallows; some with disheveled hair like tangled brambles, others with eyes wide as lightning flashes. These are the pathways of the upper realms, all mere specters along the way. You must remain composed and steadfast, free of fear or wonder, and reach a state of tranquility as if seeing nothing at all—this is the highest attainment. If black and white are distinct, it is an auspicious sign.\n\nThus, it is essential to have a worthy companion to assist you, for the primordial blackness ascends and harmonizes with the *hun*-spirit. Beware: if during the stabilization of breath you perceive anything unusual, your heart will be unsettled, and the primordial *qi* will escape through the mouth or nose, preventing your body from departing. If, in a single night, an attendant or you yourself count the breaths to a thousand, you will ascend with the Three Primordial Spirits to the upper realms—the Dao will then be accomplished.\n\nOnce the Dao is achieved, you must not, under any circumstances, reveal it. The principles of the spirit are most wondrous and sublime.\n**Great Taboo! Great Taboo! Exercise utmost caution! Utmost caution!**\nDo not disclose it to others. If you remain indifferent to external things and free of wayward thoughts, ghosts, spirits, and demons will naturally submit to your virtue.\n\n*Where does one obtain the feathered raiment of rosy clouds?*\n*From the five viscera, wings of mist arise.*\nRefining the form to ascend, one naturally transforms into a five-colored feathered robe.\nThe *Feathered Scripture of the Central Heaven* states:\n*\"Light as cicada wings, resplendent beyond measure—*\n*For the cicada drinks dew and ingests qi, thus growing wings;*\n*When man ingests primordial blackness, celestial raiment coalesces upon the body—*\n*Thus it is known.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The True Blackness of the Five Viscera**\n\nThe true blackness of the five viscera—mushroom sprouts and blossoms...\n\nThe *Scripture of Reception and Recognition from Mount Taihua* states:\nPrimordial qi transforms and deploys, forming the six roots;\nFortune and misfortune follow their use, responding to actions in kind.\nInternal qi becomes perception; womb qi becomes spirit.\nIf one masters womb-breathing, one returns to infancy and restores the hun-soul.\nThe inception of the five viscera first unfolds within water,\nwith the six bowels externally corresponding to the six roots.\n\nThe liver governs the East, its color azure.\nThe *Scripture of the Five Planets of Great Clarity* states:\nThe liver governs Wood, born of Water, restrained by Earth.\nIt comes from the East, its color azure-green,\nreceived from yang. Concealing and refining this qi,\nafter a thousand breaths, light is generated.\nIf one constantly employs qi but has not yet attained womb-breathing,\none should visualize azure qi emerging from the left flank.\nMeditate on this without ceasing for six periods of the day,\nfocusing every other hour from the hour of *zi* onward.\nAfter fifty days, one should perceive this blackness like azure clouds.\nThis qi can heal all manner of afflictions in others—\nfevers, seasonal epidemics, paralysis, swellings, scabies, and emaciation.\nSimply observe the patient’s symptoms and gauge their severity,\nthen direct this qi to attack the ailment; none will fail to recover.\nIf the patient’s complexion appears withered and sallow,\nindicating a disorder of the liver meridian, it is somewhat difficult to heal and may be incurable.\nMerely seal the meridian for a thousand breaths,\nand the azure color will circulate naturally.\nThe *Scripture of Womb-Breathing* states:\n*A thousand breaths, the azure color internally coalesces.*\n\nThe heart governs the South, its color red.\nAfter a thousand breaths, the red color emerges.\nThe *Scripture of the Five Planets of Great Clarity* states:\nThe heart governs Fire, born of Wood, restrained by Metal.\nIt comes from the South, its color red,\nreceived from the Vermilion Yang, corresponding to summer.\nConcealing and refining for a thousand breaths,\nqi should emerge from the heart’s chamber.\nFor those who constantly employ qi but have not yet attained womb-breathing,\nat every *wu* hour, visualize a crimson-blackness within the heart,\nstoring it like a sparrow’s egg, gradually circulating the red qi upward from the crown.\nAs it emerges, let it disperse naturally while maintaining visualization.\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Southern Fire, Bing and Ding,\nthe Red Dragon abides in stillness.\nYin spirits retreat; yang officials descend to welcome.\nMeditate, and it arrives; employ it, and it is efficacious.\"*\nRecite this incantation thrice, and persist in this qi practice,\ncultivating sincerity and visualization.\nAfter fifty uninterrupted days, a fiery red light should manifest.\nThis qi can heal all manner of cold ailments in others;\ndirect the qi to attack, and recovery will follow.\nIf the patient’s complexion bears a greenish hue,\nit signifies yin-blackness and is incurable.\nThose who practice visualization, incantation, and spirit-qi methods\nmust guard against others learning of them.\n\nThe lungs govern the West, their color white.\nAfter a thousand breaths, the color reaches its peak.\nThe *Scripture of the Five Planets of Great Clarity* states:\nThe lungs govern Metal, born of Earth, restrained by Wood.\nThey come from the West, their color white,\nserene, cool, and subtly radiant.\nConcealing and refining for a thousand breaths,\na brilliant, overflowing light emerges.\nFor constant practice, at every *chou* hour,\nvisualize within the lungs a qi resembling a white pearl,\nits light gradually expanding and ascending to the space between the brows.\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Western Metal, Geng and Xin,\nthe Mysterious Perfected of Great Tenuity.\nInternally corresponding to the six bowels,\ntransformed into the lung-spirit,\nit roams the cinnabar field, firmly guarding my life.\nEmploy it, and become an immortal—\nswiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\nAfter forty-nine days of visualization,\na blackness like white clouds will emerge from the lungs.\nThis blackness can illuminate all treasures beneath the earth\nand discern the good and evil of others,\nrevealing their true nature as if unveiled.\nWithout this visualization practice,\nrefining qi for three years will only then reveal the inner workings of the five viscera.\nThis method is not fully expounded in the *Scripture of the Nine Qi*,\nfor its vastness remains a guarded secret—how much more so among ordinary people.\n\nThe spleen governs the Center, its color yellow.\nAfter a thousand breaths, its color flourishes.\nThe *Scripture of the Five Planets of Great Clarity* states:\nThe spleen governs Earth, born of Fire, restrained by Water.\nIt comes from the Center, its color yellow.\nSeal and refine for a thousand breaths,\nvisualizing once daily without fixed hours or incantations.\nAfter forty-nine days of storing this within the spleen,\nthe manifestation will occur.\nThis blackness emerges from the spleen,\nthereafter allowing one to pass through walls and barriers unimpeded.\n\nThe kidneys govern the North, their color black.\nAfter a thousand breaths, the color is attained.\nThe *Scripture of the Five Planets of Great Clarity* states:\nThe kidneys govern Water, born of Metal, restrained by Fire.\nThey come from the North, their color black,\nconcealed in the lower origin, presiding over the chamber of life.\nWithin resides true whiteness, guarded without fail.\nFor the spirits of the five viscera, at the first light of dawn,\nvisualize the qi of each color converging at the crown—\nno need for separate visualization.\nIncantations are also unnecessary,\nthough the process may be slightly delayed.\nAfter a hundred days, the colors will fully form,\nand their efficacy can be immediately verified.\n\nTo command the myriad spirits follows its own principles.\nRefining qi, cultivating will, and upholding inner conduct,\nwith internal and external mutual support,\nprimordial qi fills the five viscera and the cinnabar field.\nAfter a full year, all worldly ghosts, specters, demons,\nand local earth spirits will not dare conceal themselves.\nWherever one resides, the spirits of the land will come to pay homage,\nconstantly accompanying and protecting the Dao practitioner.\nThe records of good and evil in the Six Registers of the Underworld will be known in detail,\nyet one must not rashly employ them for command,\nlest one lack the *True Record of the Three Heavens* and risk harm.\nIf one attains womb-breathing and the method of ascending the body,\ndesiring to wander the world, one should follow the *Corpse-Liberation* method of this scripture,\nnaturally traversing the world without obstruction.\nOtherwise, the Dao cannot be forgotten.\nIf one does not pursue this path,\nbut instead focuses on transforming others,\nboth self and others will benefit.\n\nRiding the radiant clouds to return to the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe *Scripture on Womb-Breathing and Subduing Yin* states: \"The inner breath has no name; inner cultivation perfects itself. Without upholding the precepts and entering womb-breathing, how can one unite with the spirit?\"\n\nIf one has not yet entered womb-breathing but wishes to wander the world, one may practice the *Corpse-Liberation* method. The *Book of the Mysterious Hidden in the Great Subtlety* says: \"Whether one has entered womb-breathing or not, if one wishes to wander the world, one may practice the *Corpse-Liberation* technique, transforming according to the object at hand. Thus, some entrust their forms to clothing or gold. On a *geng* or *xin* day, at the *geng* hour, in a cold chamber, arrange a low table outside the head of the couch. Burn a censer of fine incense, and place beneath it a dragon staff, shoes, and other items, all beside the head. Do not remove one’s garments, but cover oneself with a quilt. Lie with the head to the west, imagining oneself as a corpse. Silently recite this incantation seven times:\n\n*‘Great One of the Mysterious Dark,\nReceive life from the numinous.\nSeven thoughts, seven summons—\nThe three souls follow and attend.\nReplace my body, conceal my form.\nForm follows transformation,\nAnswering change to completion.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!’*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, maintain the visualization for the duration of a meal, then sleep as usual. On the day of practice, upon rising, one must not speak to outsiders—this is forbidden. If one speaks to others, the method will not succeed. Practicing thus for forty-nine days, the method will gradually take effect. Once mastered, whenever one wishes to employ it—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—silently recite the incantation seven times, grasp an object, and one’s body will depart. Others will see only the object in one’s hand transform into one’s own form, while one’s true body appears dead. Later, when the object returns to its original shape, this method can be used to evade calamity in the lower realms and protect oneself. It must not be used for unrighteous purposes. One must guard this method with great care and maintain strict secrecy. Externally, one should merely cover the body with a quilt. When concealing transformation, recite the incantation once, then depart. Others will see only the quilt or gold as the corpse, not the remaining garments. Mastery of this method strictly forbids attachment to wealth or sensuality, lest the spirit be harmed by divine retribution.\"\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Palace of the Great Ultimate**\n\nThe Palace of the Great Ultimate abides in the azure void,\nIts crimson gates and lofty terraces stacked myriad-fold.\nJade towers stand in ranks like perilous peaks,\nThe palaces of the upper realms born from the profound,\nAll woven from the radiance of the Five Colors.\nThe lands of the lower realms are held firm by congealed water and vapor,\nThus they lack freedom, durability, and evenness.\n\nThe upper realms use the Eight Treasures as sustenance,\nAnd the Seven Jewels as utensils.\nAs for their palaces, they are formed from the Seven Treasures,\nPossessing a natural, unlabored power,\nWithout need for human effort.\nThe upper realms fashion sun and moon from the essence of the Seven Treasures,\nWhile the lower realms use pure yin and yang.\nThe lower realms speak of a year as three hundred and sixty days,\nWhich is but a single day and night in the upper realms.\n\nThe *Mysterious Scripture of the Great Subtlety* states:\n*\"Not consuming the essence of earthly lands,\nOne dwells in the City of the Great One.\"*\nThis is when both form and spirit depart together.\n\nJade halls glow with emerald brilliance,\nRed clouds and purple mists ever harmonious.\nJade walls and golden pillars gleam within,\nAs the *Scripture of the Jade Hall of the Mysterious Palace* says:\n*\"White jade for walls, yellow gold for pillars,\nGreen coral for beams, red jade for rafters,\nAll woven from the Seven Treasures’ radiant hues,\nDazzling and luminous, unobstructed within and without.\nA thousand pavilions and ten thousand towers mirror one another,\nYet even the Great Immortals and Perfected Ones dwell beyond these.\"*\n\nPhoenixes dance and simurghs sing in joyous verse,\nAs the upper realms have the *Dance of the Celestial Phoenix*\nAnd the *Song of the Simurgh’s Dawn*—both names of melodies.\nJade cups and golden nectar flow at will,\nAs the *Scripture of the Nine Banquets of the Mysterious Kitchen* states:\n*\"Ten times a day, nine celestial feasts,\nSeven offerings of the Eight Nectars,\nTen times a day, seven libations of wine.\"*\n\nThe Nine Qi True Immortals stand in ranks sublime.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Nine Qi True Immortals**\n\nThe Nine Qi True Immortals don brocade robes,\nTheir cloud-garments of fasting silk, cicada-wing sashes trailing.\nThe Perfected Lords wear robes of jade-patterned brocade,\nWoven like cicada wings.\n\nTheir celestial crowns sway, chiming in harmonious tones,\nThe jade pendants at their waists naturally sounding the Five Notes.\nNine-patterned flowered shoes, starry brocade wondrous,\nTheir floral designs scattered like stars piercing jade.\n\nThey don rainbow skirts to attend the Grand Ceremony.\nThe *Rainbow Skirt* is the court attire of the immortals.\nThose newly attained to immortality all pay homage to the Grand Ceremony Perfected Lord,\nThe sovereign of the Nine Heavens.\n\nMaidens of the Ten Directions bear banners and standards,\nA hundred spirits escort their chariots, jade lads following.\nBefore them, dragon banners; behind, tiger flags.\nThe Vermilion Bird ahead, the Dark Warrior behind,\nThe Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right—\nAll are among the ranks of the hundred spirits.\n\nFeathered robes flutter in the winds of the Eight Limits,\nThe *Eight Limits* being the cardinal and intercardinal directions.\nThey first clear the path.\nThen ascend to the Liao Heaven and enter the Great Subtlety.\n\nThe bureaus and offices of this realm number four hundred thousand,\nA vast multitude indeed.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Palace of the Great Subtlety**\n\nStraight above the Liao Heaven lies the realm of the Great Subtlety,\nWhere stillness and motion blend in the music of pipes and flutes.\nThe winds of the upper realms all resound like the harmony of sheng and huang,\nFor this is the land of ultimate bliss, naturally so.\n\nHow profound and towering are its halls and pavilions,\n*Yaopao* meaning vast and boundless.\nThe layered palaces are countless, grand and resplendent.\n\nLongevity eternal, garments light, bodies vast.\nEach of the Nine Heavens surpasses the last.\n\nThe Nine Heavens’ feathered robes and regalia each follow in succession, ever more resplendent.\nThe feathered garments grow lighter, the bodies vaster,\nTheir radiant hues ever more vivid, their splendor ever more fresh.\nSun and moon advance ever onward, their course ever more distant.\nThis is called attaining freedom through the heart’s intent.\nBy moving the body through the heart’s intent, one escapes the Three Realms.\n\nIn stillness, cultivating truth, one becomes a sage.\nThe Nine Practices of the Empty Gate are recorded among the perfected.\nNow, the Nine Practices are the dwelling place of Daoists.\nIn movement and rest, abiding and sustaining, one never departs from them.\nFirst, take compassion as one’s garment.\nSecond, take cessation and moderation as one’s sustenance.\nThird, take rectifying the heart as one’s vehicle.\nFourth, take single-minded devotion as one’s wealth.\nFifth, take humility as one’s bearing.\nSixth, take following righteousness as one’s vessel.\nSeventh, take cherishing wisdom as one’s refuge.\nEighth, take cultivating emptiness as one’s dwelling.\nNinth, take hidden giving as one’s vocation.\nIf a disciple of the Dao does not uphold these Nine Practices, they drift ever farther from the Way.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Nine Practices of the Empty Gate**\n\nThe Nine Practices of the Empty Gate are the path to perfection.\nThe Great Dao does not contend with human anger.\nIn movement and rest, one sustains without ceasing,\nAnd the yin spirit turns inward, the spirit ever aiding.\nSustaining the heart without pause, the Dao is easily accomplished.\nAll practices without heart are the true heart.\nThrough the heart’s intent, one returns to heaven.\nThe heart without heart moves through the heart.\nThough the Dao is without heart, it still arises from the heart’s presence.\nTo remove defilement without heart is called the true.\nDaily affairs are defilement; absence of affairs is removal.\nCessation of the heart’s thoughts unifies the myriad practices.\nFollowing the fetal breath, one enters the Gate of Heaven.\nFetal breathing takes virtuous conduct as its essential mechanism,\nAnd absence of thought as its ultimate path.\nThe profound and correct principle lies hidden within the body,\nWithout crookedness, the concealed form unites with the true.\nAs the *Scripture of Cavernous Mystery* states: “With a heart free of crookedness, the myriad spirits are fulfilled.”\nWhen the Three Fields are pure and empty, the primordial qi is firmly established,\nThe Six Palaces transform into a million spirits.\nWhen the Three Origins are still, the Six Palaces harmonize,\nAnd when the true light returns, the myriad spirits respond.\nAs the two principles merge, the spirits of the five viscera and six palaces,\nNumbering over a million, naturally manifest and harmonize in resonance.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Million Spirits of the Six Palaces**\n\nThe million spirits of the Six Palaces abide in constancy.\nThe five viscera, six palaces, hundred joints, and nine nodes\nHost a million spirits. If one cultivates them with daily clarity and coolness, they will naturally appear.\nWithin the great intestine lies the hall of the lungs.\nThe palace is the chief, the ruler of the Triple Burners.\nWhen the primordial harmony contends and governs, the grains are fully digested.\nWith only the primordial qi attacking and circulating, what worry is there that the grain’s essence will not depart?\nWithin it, numinous spirits naturally conceal themselves.\nWhen the palaces and viscera are cool, the myriad spirits conceal themselves.\n\nThus the *Tai Ming Jing* states: The large intestine governs the lungs. The central pillar of the nose corresponds to the intestine, weighing twelve taels, measuring one zhang and two chi in length, eight cun in width, located to the left of the navel, coiled in twelve loops. It holds one dou and two sheng of water and grain, governing the twelve hours. Within it, spirits—twelve in number, each clad in their own colored robes and caps—reside. When the turbid water and grain are fully expelled, the primordial *xi* becomes abundant, and these spirits manifest, each in their appointed hour, to alternately guard and protect the disciple of the Dao.\n\nThe kidney palace corresponds to the inner palace of women, externally reflected in the ear as its gate. The *Nei Shen Jing* states: Essence governs the kidneys. The kidneys serve as the rear palace, where the inner palace of women presides. The kidneys are the officials of the ears, receiving *qi* through them. The left kidney is *ren*, the right *gui*, circulating between the two ear gates, where five hundred spirits dwell. Within, the primordial spirit guards them, collectively governing will and wisdom. If one indulges in excessive anger, the kidneys are harmed; when the kidneys are harmed, will is lost, and the foundation of the Dao is forfeited. The primordial spirit scatters, and for the cultivator, anger is a grave taboo. When the Dao is attained, the inner spirits constantly appear to the practitioner, serving as guardians of the Way.\n\nThe bladder unites the two palaces at the gate of fluids, with the sea of *qi* circulating as its vital path. The bladder is the two palaces, the gate of fluids. The kidneys connect to the bladder, the repository of fluids, which corresponds above to the root of the tongue. The fluids come and go, perpetually moistening the body; the tongue’s shores reflect the two bladders—when *qi* is deficient, moisture fails. Those who ingest *xi* should speak sparingly to preserve fluids, for excessive speech dries the rivers. When dry, *xi* cannot be employed. Within, three hundred and sixty spirits reside, corresponding to the days of the year. When *qi* is cultivated and they manifest, they embrace the practice of non-attachment. Thus, the adept does not act contrary to the principles of spirit and Dao.\n\nThe *Da Dong Sheng Xuan Jing* states: When conduct aligns with the spirit, the Dao is attained, and one ascends to heaven. These spirit-people practice fetal breathing, ever emerging to protect those who draw near to the Dao. You shall behold the inner spirits made manifest, and throughout your life, they will assist you without fail. From beginning to end, do not leak their presence, and the celestial spirits will aid you.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Do Not Leak the Celestial Mechanism**\n\nDo not leak the celestial mechanism; preserve your resolve.\nAll celestial chapters must not be lightly revealed.\nWhenever you encounter celestial scriptures, do not casually disclose them; guard them with vigilance.\nThe thirty-three scrolls of the world are beyond common knowledge—\nDeath returns to the Yellow Center, secret within secret.\nThe *Dao You Tai Guang Jing*, thirty-three scrolls in all, is strictly forbidden from reckless transmission. How much more so this Yellow Center’s sacred verses, its secrecy of utmost weight? Be cautious, be cautious indeed!\n\nFirst, pay homage to the Three Perfected and the Jade Immortal Envoys,\nThen, with focused mind, behold the text.\nThe *Jiao Ling Ke* states: To reveal the scriptures of the Three Perfected and the like, one must first choose an *jiazi* day, purify the chamber, burn incense, and with heart fixed upon the True Person of Southern Florescence, invoke the Nine Celestial Perfected Sages and the Three Heavenly True Lords as witnesses. Begin with four bows in homage, then proceed to reveal the text. Thereafter, declare: “For the sake of seeking the Dao, I hereby open the true writ of the Nine Celestial Great Sages and transmit it once. Thus, the hundred spirits shall unite in assistance, my body shall return to the Great Void, my name shall enter the celestial register. It must not be shown to three persons—take heed!”\n\nTo leak it lightly, or to reveal it without following the scriptural teachings, is to invite calamity as if gazing upon ordinary text. The retribution shall be grave, the transgression no light matter. Those who violate the teachings shall suffer unforeseen misfortune; descendants shall bear the disaster. Beware! Beware indeed!\n\nThe Lower Scroll of the *True Scripture of the Central Yellow of Great Clarity* concludes.\n\n#1 Composed by the Nine Immortal Lords; annotated by the Central Yellow Perfected.

Also known as *The Central Yellow Scripture*, *The Embryonic Treasury Treatise*, and *The Embryonic Treasury Central Yellow Scripture*. Attributed to the Nine Immortals Lord, annotated by the Central Yellow Perfected One. Two fascicles.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity* (洞神部, Methods Category).\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. *Daoist Canon Compendium* edition, included in the final collection, first fascicle (hereafter *Compendium Edition*).\n2. *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* edition, included in fascicle thirteen.\n\n---\n\n### **Exegesis on the *Central Yellow Scripture***\n\nThe *Central Yellow Scripture* is also called *The Embryonic Treasury Treatise*. This treatise was compiled by the Nine Immortals Lord, the Yellow Perfected One. The Perfected One often observed the primordial blackness, which coalesced into form through vast and serene concentration. It was nurtured by the five viscera, corresponding to the five phases; illumined by the seven apertures, mirroring the seven luminaries to reveal clarity. Its consciousness lay latent in germination, its spirit spread in motion. It pacified the hun and embraced the po, and when the spirit was sufficient, life arose. Form and spirit entrusted one another; spirit and form perfected each other.\n\nYet the mouth receives external flavors and forgets awareness; the body endures internal labors and loses essence. When spirit departs from form, it scatters and decays; when form parts from spirit, life departs. Little do they know that skin and flesh respond to one another, and only then do sinews and bones take shape. The liver connects to sinews and manifests in the nails; the heart connects to vessels and manifests in complexion; the spleen connects to flesh and manifests in the lips; the lungs connect to skin and manifest in the hair; the kidneys connect to bones and manifest in the hair. All injure the sinews; bitterness injures the bones; sweetness injures the flesh; acridity injures qi; sourness injures the blood.\n\nThus, the sage says: First eliminate desires to nourish essence; later abstain from grain to preserve life. It is known that consuming embryonic blackness and drinking numinous primordiality is the Dao of immortality, the way to revert to youth and restore years. This is what the sage holds in highest regard.\n\nMoreover, when one scholar is single-minded, he studies the lower to reach the higher; when one man is intent, he perceives that the Dao of Heaven is not distant. To learn without attainment is called foolishness; to not learn and remain ignorant is called benightedness. Yet when the three worms have not departed, one treads the thorny fields of suffering; when the three worms have perished, one naturally arrives in the land of Huaxu. The cloud paths are revealed, and the embryonic immortals are fully expounded. Knowing the root of the sagely practice, discerning the honored ranks of the immortals—such as the rosy clouds’ feathered robes, the jade pavilions and celestial kitchens—is but a manifestation for the aspiring scholar, a slight disclosure of Heaven’s precepts. It is no reckless revelation; calamity will be your clear proof.\n\nThis sagely gate is secret; only by it may one ascend the cloud paths. Take care not to transmit it to the shallow of learning, and swear never to display this text lightly! Arrogance severs the spirit; frivolous speech shortens life. If one is not a scholar of resolve, let them not speak of it openly.\n\nIn total, eighteen chapters are arranged into one fascicle, titled *The Embryonic Treasury Central Yellow Scripture*. Each chapter links to the next by theme, and each sentence follows in succession. Its meaning is refined in the perfection of the Dao; its words exhaust the art of nurturing life. Its conduct is manifest and intent direct; its affairs are complete and its text precise. The principles of consuming blackness are fully expounded; the path of returning to Heaven is entirely achieved. Taking up the brush to record these chapters, the text is set forth below.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Clarity Central Yellow Perfected Scripture, Fascicle One**\n**By the Nine Immortals Lord, Annotated by the Central Yellow Perfected One**\n\n#### **Chapter One: Nurturing Form and Spirit Internally**\n\n\"Nurturing form and spirit internally eliminates cravings.\" To nurture form and spirit internally and eliminate cravings is to realize the true form of no-form.\n\nThe Supreme Lord said: The true Dao nurtures the spirit; the false dao nurtures the form. Guide the numinous valley’s primordial spirit into the Celestial Valley, securely seal the root, and nurture it thus.\n\nAs stated in the *Great Cavern Scripture*: Humans possess thirty-nine passes, and this Celestial Valley cavity is the first pass. The Supreme Lord said: If you guard the self within the Pass of Death and Decay, the withered bones of your seven ancestors will all attain a realm of life. Thus, it is said: nurture form and spirit internally and eliminate cravings.\n\nThe *Cavern Primordial Scripture* states: The Dao of cultivation begins by eliminating cravings and internally harmonizing with the five spirits. Next, one should abstain from grain, the heart unmoved, the six viscera like a candle. Constantly practicing this Dao, form and spirit naturally stabilize. Focus on stillness and quiescence, and the body will become like jade. When spirit interacts with things, the heart resembles the Great Void. Securely anchoring the root, stillness and quiescence arise naturally.\n\nThe human heart stirs myriad thoughts, moved by external things. Always dwell in stillness, desiring not to mingle with the crowd. Internally sever thoughts; externally sever desires. Constantly abide by this Dao, and primordial breath will be self-sufficient.\n\nOnly by consuming primordial blackness and eliminating the five grains—\nPeople commonly regard the five grains as nourishment for the flesh, unaware that the five grains excessively harm the body. Choose the third month of spring, arrange a cool chamber, set up a desk and chair, and lay thick, warm mats. Continuously burn fine incense on the desk. At the first emergence of blackness after midnight, calm the heart and spirit, then click the teeth thirty-six times. Clench both hands firmly, tilt the head back, and close the eyes. When the regular breath is exhaled, close the mouth, fill it with air, and swallow according to the method. Upon entering the abdomen, one should feel a sound; cease when satiated, and swallow again if hungry. Simply consume it calmly, without fear.\n\nAfter the blackness enters, if the mouth feels dry, drink two or three sips of sesame soup, as this substance nourishes breath and moistens the abdomen. The method for the soup: Take three large sheng of the finest black sesame, remove the husks, steam and sun-dry it nine times. Also take three liang of the finest poria. Grind them finely into powder. First add the sesame powder and boil it three or four times, then add the poria powder and boil it several more times, adding a small amount of ghee and honey. When thirsty, drink one or two cups; this not only quenches thirst but also curbs the desire for food. Alternatively, consume seasonal wolfberry soup, drinking one or two cups at a time, which also benefits the throat and breath, naturally facilitating smoothness.\n\nOnce the abdomen feels harmonious, the throat and breath will flow smoothly. Then, all soups and waters will naturally become unnecessary, and one will gradually comprehend the wondrous principle. Simply by consuming breath to attack the obstructions in the abdomen, the intestinal waste will be entirely expelled, as if entering water that flows directly below the navel.",

      "translated_text": "When first consuming qi, if one notices the urine turning yellow or dark, do not be alarmed. If the chest and heart feel restless, there is no need for fear. Simply remain steadfast and unwavering in the heart, and the wondrous principle will naturally be attained. If one does not abstain from soups and waters, even if the waste in the abdomen and intestines is entirely expelled, one will never fully comprehend right and wrong. To cease consuming grains and water depends solely on one’s own resolve and perseverance; there is no fixed time limit—some may achieve this in a month, others in fifty days, or even a hundred. For those who abstain from soups and waters, the Three Elixir Fields will naturally fill in succession. After thirty days, the Lower Elixir Field is full. After sixty days, the Middle Elixir Field is full. After ninety days, the Upper Elixir Field is full.\n\nWhen the Lower Elixir Field is full, black qi suffices, and the organs no longer feel hunger. When the Middle Elixir Field is full, qi fills the body, leaving no weakness or emaciation. When the Upper Elixir Field is full, it congeals, bestowing a radiant complexion, plump skin, and harmony in the Triple Burner. All thoughts vanish, the spirit congeals, the body becomes clear, and one finally discerns right and wrong. When the Lower Elixir Field is full, the spirit and qi do not leak. When the Middle Elixir Field is full, one’s steps become light and swift. When the Upper Elixir Field is full, the complexion becomes exceptionally beautiful. Once all three regions are replete, the body naturally attains peace and the Dao flourishes, allowing one to dwell in the sacred realm and embrace the breath of the embryonic immortal. This is the wondrous gateway of dedicated qi consumption and the supreme path to immortality. If one alternates between eating and abstaining, the will falters. Craving various flavors makes it difficult to expel grain qi. This is what dedicated qi consumption detests and the great obstacle to attaining immortality.\n\nThe scriptures say: *Salty, sweet, pungent, and sour flavors sicken the five organs; savory tastes dull the heart’s mirror. They cause the six bowels’ spirit and qi to decline, leaving the hundred bones and nine orifices bereft of numinous power.* If one can steadfastly guard against and abstain from all flavors and desires, after ninety days, the Three Elixir Fields will congeal and solidify. After a hundred days, the five organs can be observed internally. After three hundred days, ghosts and demons cannot conceal their forms, and yin spirits dare not deceive. After a thousand days, one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register, and one’s form enters the Great Subtlety. One will surely attain the True Record of the Liao Heaven and ascend through refinement, becoming an immortal official of the Lower Heaven. If one cultivates the Dao of the Three Ones by contemplating the formless black spirit, one becomes an immortal official of the Upper Heaven. If a true adept masters embryonic breathing, one attains the True Record of the Liao Heaven, where a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders welcome the adept, who then assumes the rank of a True Lord of the Middle Heaven.\n\nFor a hundred days, one must single-mindedly consume qi to sufficiency—this means the Three Elixir Fields are not yet full. Some consume qi and swallow mist, claiming it brings rest and ease, but this is no overnight achievement. First, one must protect the body with virtue and conduct, then eliminate the yin thieves and true wrath. This is the resolve of one who studies the Dao. If the yin thieves are not expelled and the Three Worms not eradicated, or if one engages in improper teachings, success will never be attained.\n\nThus, *The Mysterious Chapter of the Great Subtlety* states: *Abandon desires, relinquish arrogance, harmonize the five organs, and the spirit will be sufficient.* **Chapter Two: The Profound Subtlety of Consuming Qi**\n\nThe profound subtlety of consuming qi encompasses five matters. The term \"profound subtlety\" refers to the wondrous principle of non-action. The five matters concern the transformation of the hun and po and the stirring of the Three Corpses when one learns to abstain from grains. Yet the great essentials remain unknown. If one’s inner conduct is not yet perfected, one will not recognize the various demonic obstructions, dismissing the Dao and its methods as ineffective—this is merely a failure to grasp the true principle. If one first cultivates inner benevolence and virtue, merely consuming fluids will bring peace and harmony; how much more so when consuming qi!\n\nFirst, when one initially consumes qi, its power is still weak. At the outset, consuming qi may cause stagnation. After seven or fourteen days, impurities are expelled, and one gradually feels the body’s emptiness and weakness, with all joints lacking strength—do not be surprised. This is because the primordial qi has not yet reached the stomach and abdomen, hence the sense of frailty. Simply swallow qi, allowing it to flow smoothly, growing stronger day by day. One must remain resolute and steadfast, awaiting the Lower Elixir Field’s sufficiency, at which point hunger and thirst vanish entirely. If one has not yet attained this, the skin and complexion may appear sallow and emaciated—do not fear, for later one will become robust and vigorous. If one lacks single-minded devotion and continues to eat, exerting oneself in movement, there will be no effect, and repeated failures will ensue. This is the fate of those who lack inner conduct. If attachments and distractions linger in the heart, one brings about one’s own downfall. One must constantly remain resolute and steadfast, awaiting the moment when qi resides in the Lower Elixir Field, gradually filling it to sufficiency.\n\nOnce the Lower Elixir Field is full of qi, hunger and thirst vanish forever. If one fears weakness, emaciation, or sallowness, one cannot cultivate. If one abstains from grains and water, over time, vigor and robustness will naturally arise. One must guide the heart to govern this process.\n\n*The Great Mystery Scripture* states: *There are many paths to rest and ease, but in studying the Dao, even nine years is too brief for success.* Only by consuming qi, steadfastly enduring a hundred days, and abstaining from all soups and waters—without wavering in the heart—will the Three Corpses be eradicated, and failure avoided. It is only because students’ minds are unsettled, lingering in doubt, that their spirits waver, the Three Corpses arise, and a hundred thoughts emerge, making it difficult to return to the heart’s path. Even if one consumes qi, it is easy to regress, and one remains as unenlightened as a wooden bell.\n\nSecond, what distinguishes grain from qi? Grain qi is difficult to retain and easily leaks. If one wishes to swiftly guide qi to the five organs, one must abstain from soups, waters, and medicinal substances for forty-nine days, expelling all waste from the small intestine. Grain qi will naturally cease, and swallowed qi will flow smoothly. Some fail because their minds waver, alternating between eating and abstaining, thus bringing about their own downfall. Consuming even small amounts of flavors makes it difficult to expel grain qi. To employ qi and clearly perceive the internal organs, one must consume this primordial qi. After fifty days of abstaining from all foods, close the eyes and inwardly visualize qi arising from the heart within the spleen organ, dispersing to the four limbs. Recite the external incantation: *\"Central Wu and Ji, the inner organs hold primordial emptiness.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The yellow qi is strong and firm; when circulated, it can be regulated. Do not reject the cinnabar yang; let the vermilion clouds deliberate together. When it reaches the four limbs, great yellow clouds arise. Each day at the fifth watch, when the hawk first cries, regularly await this moment without fail. After twenty-seven days of such practice, inwardly perceive the spleen organ where dark qi gathers densely like yellow clouds penetrating the four limbs. Thereafter, this qi can extinguish candles and blow out fires from a hundred paces away, as if a great wind arises. It can summon yellow clouds to conceal one’s form, rendering one invisible to others. If one does not adhere to the fifth watch’s beginning or fails to persist steadfastly—even missing a single day—there will be no effect. This is the method of sealing the central yellow and closing the black.\n\nIf the body is weak and the heart timid, or if the organs are depleted and strength deficient, the qi may fail to reach the four limbs, resulting in signs of weakness. Yet one must remain resolute and not succumb to fear. Thus, the *Great Cavern Scripture* states: *\"Hold fast as at the beginning, and the Dao’s attainment will be more than sufficient.\"*\n\nThe third is the upper worm, dwelling in the brain palace. The *Mysterious Formulae of the Cavern Spirit* states: *\"The upper worm resides in the upper cinnabar field, which is the brain and heart.\"* Its color is white with a tinge of blue, and it is called Pengju. It causes one to crave flavors, indulge in desires, and become dull and stagnant. Those who cultivate the Dao should restrain it. Even if one has not yet ceased consuming the five grains, by maintaining this mind and sustaining the practice for over a year, the upper corpse will naturally perish, and success may still be achieved. Those who do not grasp the profound mystery and merely abstain from the five grains—yet fail to eliminate the mind of craving and desire—how can they extinguish the three corpse-worms? Myriad distractions arise in unison to shake the heart. Constantly longing for endless flavors of food and drink, thoughts stir and the countenance of illness grows. Those who study the Dao, if they do not attain inner conduct to support body and mind, will instead be deluded and disturbed by the three corpse-worms.\n\nThe fourth is the middle worm, dwelling in the heart palace. The *Mysterious Formulae of the Cavern Spirit* states: *\"The middle worm is named Pengzhi. Its color is white with a tinge of yellow, and it resides in the middle cinnabar field. It causes one to covet wealth, indulge in joy and anger, and pollute the true emptiness, allowing the three corpses to transform and the seven po to drift astray.\"* Thus, the *Cavern Mystery Scripture* states: *\"Without joy, without anger, the three worms greatly fear; without food, without desire, harmonious qi is ever sufficient. Sit and behold the primordial yang, and the ten thousand spirits will gather.\"* It sends forth dreams to scatter the spirit and soul, wandering without fixed direction—now fragrant, now beautiful, now advancing, now retreating—making constancy difficult to maintain. The spirit becomes confused and erratic, as if mad, causing one’s practice to fail and thoughts to take root in delusion. If you know this, the Dao will naturally flourish. Remain serene and unchanging, and the Dao will naturally endure.",

      "translated_text": "The fifth is the lower worm, dwelling in the abdomen and stomach. The lower corpse is white and black in color, named Peng Jiao, residing in the lower cinnabar field. It causes one to love fine clothing and indulge in wine and sensual pleasures. Those who study the Dao must inwardly recognize and firmly restrain it—then the corpse-ghosts will be powerless to act, and failure will be averted. Let your mind abide in blandness, ever without flavor. By constantly guarding blandness, the three corpses will naturally perish. Once the three corpses are gone, thoughts and worries will vanish forever.\n\nWhen still, the heart grows solitary and prone to melancholy; when disturbed, the heart becomes vexed and anger arises frequently. When one first ingests the elixir before its flow is unobstructed, the three corpse-worms stir and disrupt, sometimes causing excessive joy or anger, sometimes deep sorrow or longing, or indulgence in desires and rich flavors. This leads one astray, losing the essence of principle. If you can guard against this, the three worms will depart.\n\nThe *Scripture of Supreme Mystery on Ascending the Dao* states: *\"If you ingest the elixir, fast resolutely, and maintain a steadfast heart for one month, one worm will depart on its own, and the second will have no place to dwell.\"* If one can ingest only the elixir, remain firm in resolve, and guard it for thirty days, the upper worm will die; for sixty days, the middle worm will die; for ninety days, the lower worm will die. After a hundred days, if the heart does not waver, the body will naturally be robust and healthy, the spirit clear—forever without decline. But if one alternates between eating and fasting, the will weakens, and all effort is in vain. One must hold fast.\n\nThen you will behold the Five Sprouts and the Nine Perfected Elixir. The Five Sprouts are the true qi of the Five Phases, born within the five viscera. The Nine Perfected are the Dao of the Nine Heavens. When these Five Qi are complete, they correspond to the Nine Heavens—thus the qi of the five viscera is named after the Nine Heavens. When the primordial qi is complete, one naturally gains clarity of the Five Phases’ qi, and there is no obstruction in its flow.\n\n**The Third Chapter: The Five Sprouts Abhor Impurities**\nThe Five Sprouts abhor pungent, bitter, and sour flavors. If the five flavors are not cut off, the numinous qi of the five viscera will not arise, and thoughts of desire will never cease. One may suppress thoughts of desire and abstain from grains and external flavors—then what worry is there that the Five Qi will not arise? Once the Five Qi arise, the five emotions flow smoothly; when the five viscera are full, the primordial qi naturally congeals. When the primordial qi congeals, the Five Spirits manifest; when the Five Spirits manifest, one fully comprehends the good and evil of the human world—what worldly concerns could then entangle you?\n\nYet the three worms still lie in wait within you, the corpse-ghosts sit awaiting your death. How can you remain at ease without fear? The three corpse-ghosts always desire a person’s early demise, seeking faults within the body. Every Gengshen day, they ascend to report to the Controller of Destinies. Without vigilance or early cultivation of body and spirit, without cutting off the five flavors, one’s years will decline, qi will wane, body and spirit wither—possessing only the resolve of pine and bamboo, yet never achieving fruition. When life ends one day, what regret will be too late?\n\nI urge you to set aside worldly affairs and focus your heart on ingesting the elixir. The essential method requires stillness, holding fast to heart and spirit, ceasing all distractions—then the three corpses will perish on their own, the elixir will circulate, and all will naturally become clear. The Five Spirits will be at peace—this is the wondrous principle.\n\n**Attaining Transcendence with Cloud-and-Mist Resolve**\nBy purifying and cooling the spirit and elixir, the will naturally becomes bright and luminous, transcending all with profound insight, as if the scenery of mist and clouds lies before your eyes.\n\n**The Fourth Chapter: Cloud-and-Mist Refines the Will**\nCloud-and-mist now refines the will, penetrating the mysteries of the spirit. If the elixir of grains is eliminated, all channels will naturally become clear, the numinous light of the five viscera will transform and arise, and one will roam freely in boundless profundity. This numinous light is the spirit-elixir. It allows you to sit and know the path of life and death. If you can cut off all flavors, after a hundred days, you will understand all things. You will naturally perceive the hidden workings of the many spirits, fully witness the paths of life and death, and survey the ways of the netherworld beyond the heavens—this is true knowledge.\n\nSteaming the sinews and exposing the bones, the elixir penetrates all gates; grasping firmly, it silently flows through the hundred apertures. As the *Perfect Principle of Embryonic Breathing Scripture* states: *\"For those who ingest the elixir, even if grains are not yet fully cut off, whenever the sunlight is clear and the time bright, at noon, enter a quiet chamber, spread a soft mat, loosen the hair, lower the pillow, grasp firmly beside the ribs, click the teeth seven times, calm the heart, and close the eyes. When you feel a slight stirring, you must exert force to close the gates, grasp firmly, and gradually allow the sinews and vessels to relax and open, letting the numinous elixir silently flow between bone and flesh, moistening the skin from within. By repeatedly practicing this, you will naturally attain a radiant complexion, doubled elixir strength, hair as if washed with lacquer, and whiskers like black silk. If you do not understand how to close the elixir and refine the body, circulating the primordial without flow or moisture upon the skin, you will never attain freedom. If the elixir flows through the hair, the temples will naturally leap and dance. Without this method, even if you abstain from grains and attain long life, you will be like tiles, stones, grass, or wood—lacking spiritual radiance.\"*\n\n**The Fifth Chapter: The Hundred Apertures and Interconnected Gates**\nThe hundred apertures are all connected to spirits. The hundred apertures connect to the hundred cavities, and the hundred cavities connect to the hundred vessels. Above the eyes are two cavities, linked to the liver vessels. The liver vessels connect to the heart—thus when the heart grieves, tears flow. Above the cheeks are two cavities, linked to the nasal vessels, which connect to the heart vessels—thus when the heart grieves, the nose turns sour. The nasal vessels further connect to the brain vessels—thus when the brain is hot, the nose dries.\n\nThe *Scripture of Mysterious Luminosity and Hidden Treasures* states: *\"The hundred vessels flow together, the hundred apertures mutually arise, the hundred gates interlock, and the hundred joints connect.\"* Thus, if one aperture is blocked, a hundred illnesses arise; if one vessel is obstructed, a hundred channels fall into chaos. Therefore, ingesting the elixir ensures no illness, and all vessels flow freely. The Daoist does not die—this is because nothing lingers in the stomach and abdomen.\n\nDiscerning fortune and misfortune, the hundred spirits gather within the body; cold and heat do not approach, as the primordial elixir is harmonized within. No poisons assail, for the numinous spirits of the five viscera firmly guard.",
      "overlap_context": "and behold the primordial yang, and the ten thousand spirits will gather.\"* It sends forth dreams to scatter the spirit and soul, wandering without fixed direction—now fragrant, now beautiful, now advancing, now retreating—making constancy difficult to maintain. The spirit becomes confused and erratic, as if mad, causing one’s practice to fail and thoughts to take root in delusion. If you know this, the Dao will naturally flourish. Remain serene and unchanging, and the Dao will naturally endure.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Seven: The Perils of Salty, Sweet, Spicy, and Sour**\n\nFirmly and cautiously guard against the flavors of sour and salty. Those who partake of such tastes find it difficult to dispel grain-*qi*. The salty, sweet, spicy, and sour—these five flavors sicken the five viscera. When savory tastes enter the teeth, they cloud the mind’s realm. For whenever the five flavors pass through the teeth, they all flow into the cavities of the two eyes, scattering and permeating the hundred vessels, causing grain-*qi* to harden and solidify, lingering in the organs and bowels. Those who seek swift attainment must resolutely sever them. This leads to the decline of the six bowels’ spirit-*qi*, leaving the hundred bones and nine orifices dull and unrefined. For when spirit-*qi* fails to congeal within the cinnabar field and luminous radiance does not illuminate the organs and bowels—\n\nIf you can guard this vigilantly for a hundred days, all vessels will become as clear as a polished mirror. When your efforts span a full hundred days, spirit-*qi* will naturally solidify, and luminous radiance will blaze like a torch, leaving nothing obstructed. The bright spirits of the six bowels will no longer hide, speaking to you and revealing the mind’s realm. The spirits of the five viscera will manifest of their own accord.\n\nYet if the path of your spiritual work is hindered, the greatest obstacle lies in grain-solidity. If grain-*qi* is not eliminated, you will never perceive the profound and mysterious principle. But if you can sever both grain and water, you will naturally reach the mysterious realm.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Essence of Grain-Solidity**\n\nThe essence of grain-solidity stands apart from the numinous, entangling the six bowels and clouding the vessels. The refined essence of grain transforms into viscous membranes, coiling around the five viscera, six bowels, joints, and sinews—thus obscuring true knowledge. Even those who ingest the elixir, after fifty or sixty days, may see the dregs in their intestines and stomachs exhausted and assume nothing else remains. Yet they do not realize that the essence of grain-*qi* has yet to depart. This gives rise to cravings, scattered thoughts, and shifting emotions, with the heart suspended in unbearable longing—this is the calamity stirred by corpse-demons.\n\nThereafter, substances may emerge resembling pus or blood, or like decayed intestinal fat, or like the droppings of hawks or ducks—these are the signs of grain-*qi* preparing to exit. After another twenty or thirty days, strange matter may appear, like saliva or membranes—this is the form of grain-solidity’s essence. If one had previously combined grain consumption with elixir ingestion, sometimes abstaining, sometimes severing, or practicing intermittently for over a year before suddenly ceasing, the effects may manifest differently, and the absence of such signs should not be deemed unusual. For without grain-*qi*, *qi* flows freely through the hundred vessels, and reflection shines as brightly as a candle.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Cavern* states: Those who first ingest the elixir may feel the dregs and filth in their intestines purged, seeing only the broths and water they consume swirling in the stomach and abdomen, with no other matter present—unaware that grain-*qi* is still departing. Once grain-*qi* is fully severed, there will be no further thoughts or yearnings, the body and spirit will grow tranquil, the organs and bowels will rest in peace, and there will be no afflictions of longing, solitude, or emaciation. Should you encounter solitude or frailty, do not fear and retreat, nor harbor doubts about progress. Reflect carefully and do not withdraw.\n\nIf, after abruptly severing broths and water for thirty days, even the slightest doubt or hesitation arises, and your resolve wavers, you will never succeed. It is like digging a well through mud, seeing water yet failing to draw it—how bitter! How grievous! How utterly agonizing!",

      "translated_text": "The Nine Immortals Lord composed, Central Yellow Perfected One annotated\n**Chapter Eleven: The Embryonic Breathing of the True Immortals**\n\nThe true immortals of embryonic breathing ingest blackness and attain it; closing off true *qi*, they perfect embryonic breathing.\nThe *Scripture on Ingesting Qi* states: \"After a hundred days, the five viscera are spiritually refined—only then may one enter embryonic breathing.\"\nThe *Divine Scripture of the Nine Heavens* states: \"First, one must be in a sealed chamber without wind, with thick, soft felt mats. The pillow should be four fingers high, level with the body. Engage a like-minded companion of the Dao, relinquish mundane thoughts, clench the fists, lie supine, free the mind of attachments, and detach from external distractions. Gradually close off the numinous *qi*, and the heart’s awareness will become serene. Initially, close for ten breaths, then fifteen, twenty, up to a hundred breaths—only then will the body feel as though it remains in one place, as if within a chamber, so long as the heart does not waver.\n\nIn a single day and night, the twelve hours total thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Thus, the *Scripture of the Ascension to the Mysterious* states: 'Black severance is death; black closure is immortality.' The *po* remains to guard the body, while the *hun* roams the heavens above. If closure does not reach a hundred breaths, the *hun*-spirit will perceive the *po*—for it is a yin spirit. The *hun* is a yang spirit, yet the yin spirit constantly desires man’s death, not his life. This spirit appears as seven figures clad in black robes, wearing black crowns, and bearing black tablets.\" The *Scripture of the Cavernous Divine* states: \"It is called the Mysterious Mother.\" This spirit governs the yin corpse. Should you see this spirit, you must concentrate your mind and recite the incantation:\n\n*Mysterious Mother, Mysterious Mother,*\n*Guardian of my corpse,*\n*Nourish my bones and tendons,*\n*Do not depart from my body—*\n*Ascend with my Hun-Father to the heavens.*\n\nNext, you will see the Hun-Father: three figures, each one foot and five inches tall, clad in vermilion robes, wearing vermilion crowns, and bearing vermilion tablets. They will lead you to the Upper Prime Palace to meet the myriad brain spirits—over a hundred will emerge from your body. You will then see the primordial *qi* in the Three Elixir Fields, resembling white clouds, its radiance illuminating all. You must then call the names of the three *hun*:\n\nFirst, *Scintillating Spirit*;\nSecond, *Embryonic Light*;\nThird, *Hidden Essence*.\n\nOnce these three *hun* of yang spirit lead the brain palace’s countless spirits, your primordial spirit will roam the upper heavens. As you depart, you will feel your body emerge from the chamber of *qi*. You may witness various forms of ghosts and spirits—some towering several *zhang*, others as small as swallows; some with disheveled hair like tangled brambles, others with eyes wide as lightning flashes. These are the pathways of the upper realms, all mere specters along the way. You must remain composed and steadfast, free of fear or wonder, and reach a state of tranquility as if seeing nothing at all—this is the highest attainment. If black and white are distinct, it is an auspicious sign.\n\nThus, it is essential to have a worthy companion to assist you, for the primordial blackness ascends and harmonizes with the *hun*-spirit. Beware: if during the stabilization of breath you perceive anything unusual, your heart will be unsettled, and the primordial *qi* will escape through the mouth or nose, preventing your body from departing. If, in a single night, an attendant or you yourself count the breaths to a thousand, you will ascend with the Three Primordial Spirits to the upper realms—the Dao will then be accomplished.\n\nOnce the Dao is achieved, you must not, under any circumstances, reveal it. The principles of the spirit are most wondrous and sublime.\n**Great Taboo! Great Taboo! Exercise utmost caution! Utmost caution!**\nDo not disclose it to others. If you remain indifferent to external things and free of wayward thoughts, ghosts, spirits, and demons will naturally submit to your virtue.\n\n*Where does one obtain the feathered raiment of rosy clouds?*\n*From the five viscera, wings of mist arise.*\nRefining the form to ascend, one naturally transforms into a five-colored feathered robe.\nThe *Feathered Scripture of the Central Heaven* states:\n*\"Light as cicada wings, resplendent beyond measure—*\n*For the cicada drinks dew and ingests qi, thus growing wings;*\n*When man ingests primordial blackness, celestial raiment coalesces upon the body—*\n*Thus it is known.\"*\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The True Blackness of the Five Viscera**\n\nThe true blackness of the five viscera—mushroom sprouts and blossoms...",

The *Book of the Mysterious Hidden in the Great Subtlety* says: \"Whether one has entered womb-breathing or not, if one wishes to wander the world, one may practice the *Corpse-Liberation* technique, transforming according to the object at hand. Thus, some entrust their forms to clothing or gold. On a *geng* or *xin* day, at the *geng* hour, in a cold chamber, arrange a low table outside the head of the couch. Burn a censer of fine incense, and place beneath it a dragon staff, shoes, and other items, all beside the head. Do not remove one’s garments, but cover oneself with a quilt.

On the day of practice, upon rising, one must not speak to outsiders—this is forbidden. If one speaks to others, the method will not succeed. Practicing thus for forty-nine days, the method will gradually take effect. Once mastered, whenever one wishes to employ it—whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—silently recite the incantation seven times, grasp an object, and one’s body will depart. Others will see only the object in one’s hand transform into one’s own form, while one’s true body appears dead. Later, when the object returns to its original shape, this method can be used to evade calamity in the lower realms and protect oneself. It must not be used for unrighteous purposes. One must guard this method with great care and maintain strict secrecy. Externally, one should merely cover the body with a quilt.

      "translated_text": "Thus the *Tai Ming Jing* states: The large intestine governs the lungs. The central pillar of the nose corresponds to the intestine, weighing twelve taels, measuring one zhang and two chi in length, eight cun in width, located to the left of the navel, coiled in twelve loops. It holds one dou and two sheng of water and grain, governing the twelve hours. Within it, spirits—twelve in number, each clad in their own colored robes and caps—reside. When the turbid water and grain are fully expelled, the primordial *xi* becomes abundant, and these spirits manifest, each in their appointed hour, to alternately guard and protect the disciple of the Dao.\n\nThe kidney palace corresponds to the inner palace of women, externally reflected in the ear as its gate. The *Nei Shen Jing* states: Essence governs the kidneys. The kidneys serve as the rear palace, where the inner palace of women presides. The kidneys are the officials of the ears, receiving *qi* through them. The left kidney is *ren*, the right *gui*, circulating between the two ear gates, where five hundred spirits dwell. Within, the primordial spirit guards them, collectively governing will and wisdom. If one indulges in excessive anger, the kidneys are harmed; when the kidneys are harmed, will is lost, and the foundation of the Dao is forfeited. The primordial spirit scatters, and for the cultivator, anger is a grave taboo. When the Dao is attained, the inner spirits constantly appear to the practitioner, serving as guardians of the Way.\n\nThe bladder unites the two palaces at the gate of fluids, with the sea of *qi* circulating as its vital path. The bladder is the two palaces, the gate of fluids. The kidneys connect to the bladder, the repository of fluids, which corresponds above to the root of the tongue. The fluids come and go, perpetually moistening the body; the tongue’s shores reflect the two bladders—when *qi* is deficient, moisture fails. Those who ingest *xi* should speak sparingly to preserve fluids, for excessive speech dries the rivers. When dry, *xi* cannot be employed. Within, three hundred and sixty spirits reside, corresponding to the days of the year. When *qi* is cultivated and they manifest, they embrace the practice of non-attachment. Thus, the adept does not act contrary to the principles of spirit and Dao.\n\nThe *Da Dong Sheng Xuan Jing* states: When conduct aligns with the spirit, the Dao is attained, and one ascends to heaven. These spirit-people practice fetal breathing, ever emerging to protect those who draw near to the Dao. You shall behold the inner spirits made manifest, and throughout your life, they will assist you without fail. From beginning to end, do not leak their presence, and the celestial spirits will aid you.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Do Not Leak the Celestial Mechanism**\n\nDo not leak the celestial mechanism; preserve your resolve.\nAll celestial chapters must not be lightly revealed.\nWhenever you encounter celestial scriptures, do not casually disclose them; guard them with vigilance.\nThe thirty-three scrolls of the world are beyond common knowledge—\nDeath returns to the Yellow Center, secret within secret.\nThe *Dao You Tai Guang Jing*, thirty-three scrolls in all, is strictly forbidden from reckless transmission. How much more so this Yellow Center’s sacred verses, its secrecy of utmost weight? Be cautious, be cautious indeed!\n\nFirst, pay homage to the Three Perfected and the Jade Immortal Envoys,\nThen, with focused mind, behold the text.\nThe *Jiao Ling Ke* states: To reveal the scriptures of the Three Perfected and the like, one must first choose an *jiazi* day, purify the chamber, burn incense, and with heart fixed upon the True Person of Southern Florescence, invoke the Nine Celestial Perfected Sages and the Three Heavenly True Lords as witnesses. Begin with four bows in homage, then proceed to reveal the text. Thereafter, declare: “For the sake of seeking the Dao, I hereby open the true writ of the Nine Celestial Great Sages and transmit it once. Thus, the hundred spirits shall unite in assistance, my body shall return to the Great Void, my name shall enter the celestial register. It must not be shown to three persons—take heed!”\n\nTo leak it lightly, or to reveal it without following the scriptural teachings, is to invite calamity as if gazing upon ordinary text. The retribution shall be grave, the transgression no light matter. Those who violate the teachings shall suffer unforeseen misfortune; descendants shall bear the disaster. Beware! Beware indeed!",
