  "full_translation": "**On Primordial Qi (with Preface):**\n\nBefore the chaos, there was the Great Void;\nAt the dawn of chaos, the Great Harmony resided.\nSilent and vast, without preference or aversion—\nThe Three-in-One merged as the primordial origin,\nThe Six-in-One coalesced as qi,\nAll without form or image,\nProfound and obscure—\nThis was the Great Simplicity,\nWhen primordial qi had yet to take shape.\n\nNext came the Great Beginning,\nWhen primordial qi first sprouted;\nThen the Great Commencement,\nWhen form and qi first emerged;\nThen the Great Purity,\nWhen form and qi acquired substance;\nThen the Great Ultimate,\nWhen substance transformed and qi arose.\nBefore qi divided into forms,\nIt congealed like an embryo or egg,\nRound and complete in its qi—\nThis was called the Great Oneness.\n\nPrimordial qi, first pure, ascended to become Heaven;\nPrimordial qi, later turbid, descended to become Earth.\nThus, the Dao of the Great Void and emptiness was born.\nThe Dao, being unborn, is the root of spontaneity—\nIndescribable in name,\nYet we know spontaneity is the parent of the Dao,\nThe root of qi.\n\nSpontaneity is fundamentally One,\nThe Great Dao is fundamentally One,\nPrimordial qi is fundamentally One.\nThis One is the true, perfect, and primordial,\nPure yang qi,\nUnited in body with the Great Void,\nOf one heart with the Great Dao,\nOf one nature with spontaneity—\nThus it is without beginning or end,\nWithout form or image,\nPure and turbid as one,\nThe unformed chaos.\nTherefore, its depths cannot be fathomed.\n\nWhen primordial qi first stirred,\nSprouting forth in its infancy,\nHeaven and Earth divided,\nQian and Kun were established.\nYin and yang interacted,\nPrimordial qi spread forth,\nAnd from their harmony, humanity was conceived.\n\nFirst came Pangu,\nWho at death transformed his body:\nHis breath became wind and clouds,\nHis voice thunder,\nHis left eye the sun,\nHis right eye the moon,\nHis four limbs and five extremities the four poles and five peaks,\nHis blood rivers,\nHis sinews the earth’s veins,\nHis flesh fields and soil,\nHis hair and beard the stars,\nHis skin and hair the grasses and trees,\nHis teeth and bones metals and stones,\nHis essence and marrow pearls and jade,\nHis sweat rain and moisture.\nThe myriad creatures upon his body,\nStirred by the wind,\nTransformed into the black-haired people.\n\nBy Heaven’s decree, they were called \"the blue-born\";\nBy their black heads, \"the black-headed\";\nAlso \"the black-haired.\"\nThe basest among them were called \"blue heads.\"\nToday, people self-mockingly call themselves \"black-headed worms,\"\nOr \"naked worms\"—\nFor after Pangu and before the Three Sovereigns,\nAll were naked in form.\n\nIn the age of the Three Kings,\nThey began to cut hides and weave grass,\nBuild nests and dig caves,\nEating the fruits of grasses and trees,\nDevouring the flesh of birds and beasts,\nDrinking blood and chewing fur,\nCrude yet untroubled.\nLater, they roasted millet and split pigs,\nDrank from earthen cups,\nBeat clay drums,\nHarnessed the benefits of fire,\nThe advantages of silk and hemp,\nCast metal and molded clay,\nConstructed grand palaces,\nSet up watchtowers and barred gates,\nBuilt doors, windows, kitchens,\nRoasting, boiling, stewing, grilling—\nNurturing life and sending off the dead,\nHonoring ghosts and spirits.\n\nFrom the Great Void and primordial antiquity\nTo this age,\nThe record cannot be complete.\nFrom Fuxi to the present day,\nOver four thousand years have passed,\nWith births, deaths, and transformations,\nThe establishment of human relations,\nAs rulers and ministers,\nFathers and sons,\nRises and falls, gains and losses,\nAdvances and retreats, successes and failures—\nEarlier scholars recorded them,\nLater scholars inherited them,\nEndlessly entangled,\nImpossible to exhaust in a single discourse.\n\nMoreover, after Heaven and Earth emerged from the primordial mist,\nHumans arose from Pangu’s remains,\nScattered into the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth,\nThe patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth,\nThe Five Nets and Two Luminaries,\nThe intersecting paths of the Yellow and Red,\nThe Five Peaks and Hundred Rivers,\nDay and night,\nGiving birth to the myriad things,\nNurturing all beings—\nOf feathers, scales, and shells,\nEach numbering three hundred and sixty,\nTotaling one thousand eight hundred kinds.\nHumans, the foremost of creatures,\nAre counted among them.\n\nHumans and all living things\nAre endowed with the qi of the primordial One,\nAnd thus are born and formed.\nOf all that is born, grows, and matures,\nNone is more noble or precious\nThan the qi of humanity.\n\nHaving presumptuously partaken in this one kind,\nAnd shamefully usurped the role of the Three Powers,\nI have fished among the hundred schools,\nSifted through the ages,\nThoroughly discussed primordial qi,\nExhaustively traced its roots,\nCommitted myself to spontaneity,\nTurned my heart to the Great Dao,\nSought its profound truths,\nCompiled these arcane discourses,\nRecorded them in the true scriptures,\nTo be passed down to future sages.\nThose of understanding who encounter this,\nBeware of taking life lightly—\nDay by day, hour by hour,\nDiligently refine and practice,\nThat your crane-like spirit may dwell among white hair,\nAnd you not come to regret too late.\nThose of like mind who receive this,\nShould treasure it always.\n\n**Discourse:**\nPrimordial qi has no name,\nYet its transformations give rise to names;\nPrimordial qi envelops all alike,\nYet its transformations produce different kinds.\nIts enveloping is formless,\nThus it is called \"primordial\" as one qi;\nIts dwelling has form,\nThus it establishes myriad names and appearances.\nTherefore, \"the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\"\nConstantly desireless, observe its mystery;\nConstantly desiring, observe its manifestations.\nManifestations are the surface,\nMystery is the core.\nThe core is the foundation,\nThe surface is the beginning.\nThe beginning may be called the father,\nThe mystery the mother—\nThis is the Dao.\nThat which can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe two emerge together but differ in name.\nTogether they are called the Dao,\nApart they are called the profound.\nProfound upon profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nIt is also said:\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nSilent and vast.\nStanding alone, unchanging,\nCircling without cease,\nIt may be called the mother of all under Heaven.\nI know not its name,\nSo I style it the Dao.\nIt is born of spontaneity.\n\nOnce the Great Dao exists,\nThe Dao gives birth to yin and yang,\nYin and yang give birth to Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth give birth to father and mother,\nFather and mother give birth to this body.\nEmotions, nature, form, and fate\nAre all endowed by primordial qi.\nNature is universally enveloped,\nFate differs by kind.\nNature cannot be separated from primordial qi,\nFate follows kind in its transformations.\nThus, the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual—\nThese five cannot be momentarily separated.\nThat which can be separated is not the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, or ritual.\n\nThe Dao is trust,\nThus it is honored in the central palace,\nCalled the Dao of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nVirtue is wisdom,\nThus it is honored in the north,\nCalled the Black Emperor’s virtue;\nBenevolence is humanity,\nThus it is honored in the east,\nCalled the Azure Emperor’s benevolence;\nRighteousness is timeliness,\nThus it is honored in the west,\nCalled the White Emperor’s righteousness;\nRitual is law,\nThus it is honored in the south,\nCalled the Vermilion Emperor’s ritual.\n\nThus, the Three Sovereigns are styled the Great Dao,\nThe Five Emperors are styled the Constant Dao—\nThese two emerge from the same source yet bear different names.\n\nPrimordial qi is fundamentally one,\nYet its transformations give rise to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things must obtain the One\nTo achieve generation and completion.\nIf the ten thousand things lose the One,\nThey immediately return to the realm of death—\nThus the One must not be lost.\n\nThe One is called the Great One.\nThe Great One divides to form Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth are called the Two Modes.\nThe Two Modes divide to establish the Three Powers,\nThe Three Powers refer to humanity—\nThus it is said: \"When the powers are complete, humanity is perfected.\"\nHumanity divides into the four seasons,\nThe four seasons divide into the five phases,\nThe five phases divide into the six pitch-pipes,\nThe six pitch-pipes divide into the seven governances,\nThe seven governances divide into the eight winds,\nThe eight winds divide into the nine qi.\nFrom one to nine is the number of yang;\nFrom two to eight is the number of yin.\nNine nines are eighty-one, the supreme limit of yang’s ninefold completion;\nEight eights are sixty-four, the supreme limit of yin’s sixfold completion.\n\nThe One contains the five qi—this is called universal enveloping;\nThe One transforms into the ten thousand things—this is called differentiation by kind.\nThough divided into three and into the ten thousand,\nThey cannot be momentarily separated from the one qi.\n\nThe five qi follow fate to form nature,\nPursue things as intentions shift,\nAnd are stained by customs and habits—\nThus their transformations are boundless,\nNot merely ten thousand in number,\nHence it is said: \"The wandering soul brings about change.\"\nFor instance:\nThe old man of Wudu transformed into a woman,\nThe ancestress of the Jiang clan transformed into a soft-shelled turtle,\nThe Black Womb Clan’s pig changed into a human,\nThe man of Kuaiwu in An transformed into a tiger—\nThese are verifications of the wandering soul.\n\nThe One contains the five qi:\nThe soft qi becomes water—water’s number is one;\nThe warm qi becomes fire—fire’s number is two;\nThe gentle qi becomes wood—wood’s number is three;\nThe hard qi becomes metal—metal’s number is four;\nThe wind qi becomes earth—earth’s number is five.\n\nBefore the five qi took form,\nBefore the Three Powers were divided,\nBefore the Two Modes were established,\nThere was chaos—\nAlso called the Primal Chaos,\nAlso called the primal mass like an egg.\nThe five qi were blended as one;\nOnce the One divided from the primal,\nIt arrayed itself as the five qi.\nWhen qi emerged, it bore images—\nThus it is called \"qi-images.\"\n\nZhang Heng’s *Ling Xian* and *Hun Tian Yi* state:\n\"The root of covering and supporting\nIs none other than primordial qi;\nThe origin of numinous luminaries\nIs the division of qi into primal images.\"\nIn ancient times, the former kings trod the celestial path,\nUsing it to establish numinous patterns.\nTracing back to the primal origin,\nThey first aligned it with the celestial sphere—\nThis was called the Correct Instrument,\nThis was called the Established Measure.\nOnly then could the August Ultimate be erected,\nAnd the revolutions of the heavens be examined—\nThis was the root of \"warping Heaven and wefting Earth.\"\n\nThe sage fundamentally has no mind,\nYet through this, a mind arises.\nThe mind is born of things,\nAnd dies in things.\nThe mechanism lies in the heart and eyes—\nThe ten thousand mechanisms of Heaven and Earth,\nSuccess and failure, rise and fall,\nGain and loss, departure and abiding—\nAll arise from the heart and eyes.\n\nDeath belongs to yin,\nLife belongs to yang.\nWithin yin and yang lies the art of the Way of life,\nYet those who do not know the path of cultivation\nConstantly wander the byways of life and death—\nThus Mo Di grieved over silk,\nAnd Yang Zhu wept at the fork in the road—\nThis is the reason.\n\nBefore the Great Simplicity,\nThere was profound clarity and mysterious stillness,\nSilent and dark, beyond all images.\nWithin, there was only emptiness;\nWithout, there was only nothingness.\nThis state endured eternally—\nIt is called the Primordial Abyss,\nThe root of the Dao.\n\nOnce directions were established,\nThe Great Simplicity began to sprout.\nThough sprouting, it had not yet manifested—\nOne qi, uniform in color,\nChaos undivided—\nThus it is said: \"There was a thing chaotically formed.\"\nYet though its qi was formed,\nIt could not yet take shape.\nIts measures of slowness and swiftness\nCould not yet undergo transformation.\nThis state endured eternally—\nIt is called the Vast Swan,\nThe trunk of the Dao.\n\nThen primordial qi split apart,\nHard and soft first divided,\nYin and yang conjoined their essences,\nClear and turbid took their separate places.\nHeaven was completed on the outside,\nEarth was settled within.\nHeaven embodies yang,\nResembling the trunk of the Dao—\nWith things, it forms a body;\nWith the compass, it covers and nurtures;\nThrough movement, it begins to generate.\nEarth embodies yin,\nResembling the root of the Dao—\nWith namelessness, it forms its substance;\nWith the square, it bears and gives birth;\nThrough stillness, it ends in death—\nThis is what is meant by \"Heaven is completed, Earth is leveled.\"\n\nOnce in motion, it acts and bestows;\nIn stillness, it contains and transforms.\nPent-up qi conjoins its essences,\nTimely nurturing the myriad kinds—\nThis is called the Celestial Origin,\nThe substance of the Dao.\n\nIn Heaven, images are formed;\nOn Earth, shapes are formed.\nHeaven has nine positions,\nEarth has nine regions.\nHeaven has the three luminaries,\nEarth has mountains and rivers.\nThere are images to be emulated,\nShapes to be measured.\nNatures and dispositions are infinitely varied,\nInterconnected and mutually responsive—\nNaturally giving rise to one another,\nBeyond all reckoning.\n\nThe warp and weft of the cosmic order—\nHere I briefly expound them.\nThe four directions and eight extremities\nAre the boundaries of Earth.\nIts diameter is 232,517 *li*;\nNorth to south is 1,000 *li* shorter,\nEast to west is 1,000 *li* broader.\nFrom Earth to Heaven is half the distance to the human pole;\nThe depth of the Earth’s center is likewise half this distance—\nThe diameter and circumference are half those of Heaven.\nCalculating the distance between Heaven and Earth:\n110,258.5 *li*—\nMultiplying this by four yields the great number of the Primal Chaos.\n\nThe Way of Heaven moves leftward,\nOpposing the movement of things—\nThus Heaven’s qi fills the left and contracts the right.\nHeaven revolves through yang,\nEarth halts its wheel through yin.\nThus Heaven achieves its movement,\nBestowing qi and unfolding light;\nEarth achieves its stillness,\nEternally awaiting the signs of brightness.\nHeaven moves in compliance,\nNot losing its light—\nThus the four seasons follow their order,\nCold and heat do not err.\nEarth is still in compliance,\nNot losing its body—\nThus the ten thousand things flourish,\nAnd life and death follow their rites.\n\nThus the myriad beings take form—\nHeaven and Earth employ their compliance.\n\nOf all that is vast, none surpasses Heaven;\nOf all that is thick, none surpasses Earth;\nOf all that is abundant, none surpasses water;\nOf all that is hollow, none surpasses soil;\nOf all that is radiant, none surpasses wood;\nOf all that is solid, none surpasses metal;\nOf all that is insubstantial, none surpasses fire;\nOf all that is luminous, none surpasses the sun and moon;\nOf all that is dim, none surpasses the dark void—\nWhen the sun and moon, though bright, encounter the dark void,\nthey are eclipsed and obscured, their light dimmed.\nHow much more so for man?\n\nEarth possesses mountains and peaks, rivers and valleys,\nwells and springs, great rivers and streams,\ncaverns and lakes, ponds and marshes,\ndikes and swamps, ravines and gullies—\nall to exhale and disgorge its qi.\nHeaven possesses the constellations and stars,\nthree hundred and forty-eight in all,\nformed from the essence and qi of Heaven,\ncongealed and luminous as stars.\n\nStars—\ntheir bodies arise from Earth,\ntheir essence is perfected in Heaven,\narrayed in ordered ranks, each with its proper place.\nThese are called the \"suspended images,\"\nor the \"mysterious images\"—both names may stand.\n\nThe sun and moon measure seven hundred *li* in circumference,\nwith one thirty-sixth part;\ntheir central land spans two hundred *li*,\nwith one thirty-second part.\n\nThe sun is the sovereign of yang essence,\naccumulating essence to form its image,\nits image taking the shape of birds—\nthe golden rooster, the firebird,\nall said to have three feet,\nsymbolizing the yang kind, their number odd.\nThe moon is the sovereign of yin essence,\naccumulating essence to form its image,\nits image taking the shape of beasts—\nthe jade hare, the toad,\nall with four feet,\nsymbolizing the yin kind, their number even.\n\nThus the numbers of odd and even,\nthe qi of yin and yang,\ndo not lose their luminosity—\ntruly born of the Primal Qi.\n\nMan receives the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth,\nbeginning with the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,\nyin and yang conjoined, above and below in harmonious compliance.\nSpirit divides, qi diminishes,\nbody forgotten, self abandoned—\nthen my nature descends,\nmy life is recorded at birth.\nFor ten months within the womb—\nall men dwell in the embryonic sac for ten months,\nas explained in the final scroll—\nyet in truth, conception spans thirty-eight *la*.\nOne *la* is one seven-day period.\nEach day brings one transformation,\nthirty-eight transformations in all,\nthen the fetus seeks birth.\n\nAt the time of seeking birth,\nwithin four days,\nthose of keen wisdom and brightness—\nas if in a royal chamber,\nreceiving every joy—\nemerge with ease,\nas if descending from Heaven.\nMother and child are well,\nfree from all suffering;\nkinsfolk rejoice,\nneighbors celebrate.\nThose of wickedness and perversity—\nas if in a prison cell,\nenduring every torment—\nthe two lives contend,\nsuffering unbearable pain.\nKinfolk are anxious,\nneighbors are alarmed.\n\nFor all in the world who receive conception,\nthe count of days is fixed—\nyet good and evil diverge.\nHow can a child of man defy the Five Inversions?\n\nWhen a child reaches thirty days,\ncelebration is held,\ncalled the \"full month\"—\na custom long established.\nQi is complete, form is whole,\nall spirits are present.\nLike the Two Modes dividing the Three Powers,\nthe body follows Earth, models Heaven,\nembracing yin, holding yang—\nlike a melon ripe, its stem loosened,\npecking and hatching in unison.\nThus is the newborn brought forth,\nthe red child.\n\nThe perfected man harbors the Dao and virtue,\nhis nature serene, his emotions tranquil,\nembracing the One, guarding emptiness,\ncalm and untroubled.\nHis body merges with the Void,\nhis mind rests in embryonic breathing.\nThus it is said:\n\"One whose virtue is profound\nis compared to the red child.\"\n\nThe heart of the red child\nis one with the heart of the perfected man.\nWithin, it is preserved by the Dao and virtue;\nwithout, it is protected by spirit and luminosity—\nlike a loving mother with her red child.\n\nThe red child’s heart is whole harmony;\nthe sage’s heart is whole virtue.\nExternally, there is no mind of discrimination;\ninternally, there is no heart to harm.\nThe red child, in whole harmony,\ncan clench its fists and grasp firmly—\nso it is said:\n\"Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.\nUnknowing the union of male and female, the *xiao* stirs—\nthe perfection of essence.\"\nCrying all day without hoarseness—\nthe perfection of harmony.\n\nThe firm grasp arises from the fullness of Primal Qi,\nweak bones and soft sinews.\nUnknowing the union of yin and yang,\nyet the source of contained qi stirs—\nthis is the work of pure and unadulterated essence and qi.\nYin is the female, yang the male;\n*xiao* refers to the source of qi and life.\nThe source of qi and life\nis the root of Primal Qi.\n\nThe red child’s heart is free of desire,\nits mind without discrimination.\nThough the *xiao* stirs,\nit is not drawn by external cravings,\nnever fearing the breach of the tailbone’s gate.\nIts qi is true, its essence pure,\nflowing and returning naturally,\nfree and unconstrained,\nfollowing its nature, abiding in truth.\nThus it is called \"the perfection of essence.\"\nCrying all day without hoarseness—\nthis is the perfection of pure harmony.\nHoarseness is the breaking of the voice.\nThe red child, with Primal Qi filling within,\ntrue essence secure,\nperfect harmony unbroken,\ndoes not scatter.\n\nThe *Shangqing Dongzhen Jing* states:\n\"Man’s birth—\nhe receives the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth,\nbecoming spirit and form;\nhe receives the Qi of the Primal One,\nbecoming fluids and essence.\nWhen Heaven’s qi is depleted, spirit scatters;\nwhen Earth’s qi is depleted, form sickens;\nwhen Primal Qi is depleted, life is exhausted.\nThus the Way of the Sovereign One’s Returning Wind\nflows back through the hundred vessels,\nupward to replenish the Muddy Pellet,\ndownward to strengthen Primal Qi.\nWhen the brain is full, spirit is whole;\nwhen spirit is whole, qi is whole;\nwhen qi is whole, form is whole.\nForm whole, the hundred passages are harmonized within,\nthe Eight Evils vanish without.\nWhen Primal Qi is full,\nmarrow congeals into bone,\nintestines transform into sinews—\nall through pure and unadulterated essence,\noriginal spirit, original qi,\nnever leaving the body.\nThus can one attain long life.\"\n\nMaster Qin Shaoqi’s *Discourse on the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Difficulties* states:\n\"Men are born in *yin* (*wood*, yang);\nwomen are born in *shen* (*metal*, yin).\nPrimal Qi arises in *zi*—\nhere lies the origin of man’s life.\"\n\nThe man proceeds thirty steps leftward from *zi*, the woman twenty steps rightward from *zi*, both arriving at *si*—here husband and wife conceive, receiving the qi of gestation. The man proceeds ten steps leftward from *si* to *yin*, the woman ten steps rightward from *si* to *shen*—both undergo ten months of receiving qi, until qi is full and form is complete; *yin* and *shen* are thus where man and woman are born.\n\nProceeding thirty steps leftward from *yin* to *wei*, *wei* is called \"Lesser Auspice,\" the culmination of a man’s life cycle. Proceeding twenty steps rightward from *shen* to *chou*, *chou* is called \"Greater Auspice,\" the culmination of a woman’s life cycle. Only then may a man marry and a woman be betrothed. If this order endures without cease, Primal Qi will never be exhausted, essence and qi will never scatter—thus can one attain long life.\n\nNow, the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth arises from the position of *zi*, which belongs to *Water*. The trigram of *Water* is *Kan*, governing the eternal North, corresponding to the *Yue* and *Jizhou* regions. Human Primal Qi is the same as that of Heaven and Earth, residing in the kidneys within the body.\n\nHuman Primal Qi possesses the marvel of natural stillness, embracing the pure, empty, and mysterious body. Mysterious beyond mystery, marvelous beyond marvel—this is called the \"Gate of Myriad Marvels,\" the wondrous path of Primal Qi. Thus, the mysterious is called *spirit*; the numinous of spirit is called the *Dao*; the Dao gives birth to the body of spontaneity—hence can one attain long life. The root of life is none other than Primal Qi.\n\nThe kidneys are the chamber of spirit; if spirit has no chamber, it cannot rest; if the chamber has no spirit, how can one be healthy? When the chamber is firm, spirit dwells in peace. Then one transforms from the mundane to the sagely, and spirit attains numinous communion. If spirit loves life but the chamber cannot be secured, spirit cannot rest, the chamber becomes desolate, and one is cast into the realm of death.\n\nIf one cultivates movement with subtlety, diligently refines progress, maintains inner purity and outer stillness, and severs all defilements, then the grandly fortified chamber will allow spirit and soul to dwell in peace. Spirit and its divine counterpart constantly serve as guardians; body and spirit mutually cherish and protect. Thus, when the body attains the Dao, spirit also attains the Dao; when the body attains immortality, spirit also attains immortality. Body and spirit depend on each other, reaching into the boundless.\n\nPrimal Qi is the source of life, namely the moving qi between the kidneys. It is the root of the five viscera and six bowels, the origin of the twelve meridians, the gate of breath, the source of the Triple Burner—also called the \"Spirit that Guards Against Evil.\" The sage likens it to a tree for illustration. This qi is the root of human life; if the root is severed, the viscera, bowels, sinews, and meridians become like branches and leaves—when the root rots, the branches wither, as is evident.\n\n**Question:** What is the moving qi between the kidneys?\n**Answer:** The right kidney is called the *Gate of Life*. The qi of the *Gate of Life* moves and emerges from between them, for the space is central, and movement arises from life. It is the tether of Primal Qi, the abode of spirit and essence. The *Gate of Life* holds the spirit of true essence, which excels at securing and guarding. When defense is perfect, evil qi cannot recklessly enter—hence it is called the \"Spirit that Guards Against Evil.\" If it fails to guard against evil, evil will enter, and upon entry, one dies.\n\nThat by which one preserves life is this: Primal Qi belongs to *yang*, and *yang* is *ying* (nutritive qi); blood and vessels belong to *yin*, and *yin* is *wei* (defensive qi). When *ying* and *wei* flow constantly, life endures. They are also called *ying* and *wei*: *ying* and *wei* are the flourishing qi and vessels, like the blossoming of trees. *Ying* and *wei* nourish the viscera and bowels, cherish spirit and qi, enabling their circulation and safeguarding the path of life.\n\nIt is also said: the clear is *ying*, the turbid is *wei*. *Ying* flows within the vessels, *wei* flows outside the vessels. By day, they circulate through the body; by night, they circulate through the viscera. In one hundred *ke*, they complete fifty cycles, converging at dawn. At the *cun*, *guan*, and *chi* positions of both hands, *yin* and *yang* interpenetrate and flow ceaselessly, like following a ring without end. If they cease, one dies; if they flow, one lives. Thus, one must regulate and nurture them, cherishing and preserving them so that *ying* and *wei* circulate without end, spirit and qi never deplete—then one may share the longevity of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAfter the separation of primordial chaos, the Three Primal Qi of Heaven, Earth, and Water gave rise to humanity and nurtured the myriad things. Humans emulate this, designating the Three Burners and Three Elixir Fields to nourish the body and generate spirit and qi.\n\nThere are three positions but no distinct organ; they reside within the body, governing three functions. The Upper Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Heaven and is called the Upper Elixir Field. Its domain extends from above the stomach orifice, below the heart and above the diaphragm, up to the Muddy Pellet. The Upper Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Heaven’s Primal, governing the *Danzhong* point in the chest. The *Danzhong* point regulates warmth between the skin and muscles, like the irrigation of mist and dew.\n\nThe Middle Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Earth and is called the Middle Elixir Field. Its domain extends from below the heart and diaphragm to the navel. The Middle Elixir Field receives the yin qi of Earth’s Primal, governing the stomach duct. The stomach duct point lies below the heart, governing the decomposition of grains and ripening of fluids, transforming the flavors of water and grain in the stomach to produce blood and nourish the viscera, bowels, and body—like the steaming of Earth’s qi.\n\nThe Lower Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Water and is called the Lower Elixir Field. Its domain extends from the navel down to the bladder and *Louquan* point. The Lower Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Water’s Primal, governing the *Qihai* point one *cun* below the navel, residing in the *Qijie* (Street of Qi), which is the pathway of qi.\n\nThe Triple Burner is the master of qi circulation, hence it resides in the *Qijie*, a thoroughfare connecting all directions. The Lower Burner governs the movement of qi and blood, the circulation of meridians, the gathering of spirit and essence, and the interplay of *yin* and *yang*—like water flowing toward moisture, moisture being the source. Moisture refers to water flowing downward, irrigating in due time. Cloud qi ascends, then descends as rain.\n\nThe *Immortal Classic* states: \"My life is in my hands. Preserve essence and receive qi—longevity knows no limit.\"\n\nIt further states: \"Do not exhaust your form, do not dissipate your essence. Return the heart to stillness and silence—thus may one attain long life. The root of life and destiny lies decisively in this Way. Though one may practice breathwork and daoyin, cultivate blessings and merit, study myriad methods, or ingest great elixirs, without knowing the Way of primal qi, it is like a tree with lush branches and leaves but no roots—how can it live long?\n\nIf one indulges in the pleasures of the long night—sensual delights and carnal joys—these may seem abundant, yet one will ultimately encounter the sorrow of early death and the eternal pain of burial in the yellow springs. Such shallowness is indeed extreme. But if one spends years in diligent cultivation, following methods to extend life, adhering to the Jade Canon’s teachings, observing dietary prohibitions, and grasping the essence of primal qi—restraining the hun-soul, controlling the po-soul, preserving the embryo, and halting essence—this shallowness is not present. One will ultimately attain enduring longevity and dwell forever in the celestial realms. Such profundity is indeed extreme.\n\nThus, the limits of life and destiny are truly finite, while the passions of desire are boundlessly insatiable. To pursue endless desires with a finite life is to hasten one’s own destruction. Earth may muddy a river, but it cannot muddy the sea; wind may uproot a tree, but it cannot uproot a mountain. Desire may disturb the petty person, but it cannot move the noble one—why is this so? The noble one is a hermit, while the petty person is a wanderer.\n\nOne must recognize that one’s nature has limits, and life’s tenure is precarious. If the pivotal mechanism is not shown, the essential Way not transmitted, the heart’s compliance not proclaimed, and the essence of refinement not imparted, then even a single phrase may remain unknown for ages, and a lifetime of study may not yield the hearing of the Dao.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? The Dao is primal qi. Primal qi is the end of life. The end of life lies solely in the art of the center. Taking the preservation of the Dao as the method and the transformation of essence as the subtlety, one causes qi to flow unimpeded. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot.\n\nIf one knows the mystery within the mystery, and man and woman cultivate together, husband and wife both become immortals—this is called the wondrous Way. The *Immortal Classic* states: \"One yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of the Three Primes and Two Harmonies is called the elixir. Tracing the flow to replenish the brain is called returning; essence transforming into qi is called transmutation. With each transmutation, one change, one augmentation—each transformation extends life by one cycle, and nine transformations extend it by one hundred and eight years.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: \"Inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, preserve and guard the natural. First honor the qi, for qi is the source of life.\" The Way of augmentation and transformation—augmentation refers to augmenting essence, and transformation refers to transforming form. Those who can augment and transform are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals; those who cannot augment nor transform do not escape the calamity of death.\n\nThose who practice this Way are said to constantly contemplate the Numinous Treasure. The numinous is spirit, and the treasure is essence. Simply cherish qi and treasure essence, grasp firmly and close the mouth, swallow qi and swallow fluids. Fluids transform into essence, essence into qi, qi into spirit, spirit back into fluids, fluids back into essence, essence back into qi, qi back into spirit. Thus, seven returns and seven reversions, nine transformations and nine changes—once essence is augmented, form is transformed. This transformation is not death but the living transformation of form: changing old age into youth, youth into childhood, childhood into infancy, and infancy into the newborn. This is the true person.\n\nWhen this Way is accomplished, it is called embryonic breathing. With unwavering cultivation, spirit and essence overflow, primal qi grows robust, the brain congeals, and the bones are renewed. As the *Immortal Classic* says: \"In the Way of yin and yang, essence and fluids are the treasure. Guard them carefully, and one may grow old only after the celestial mandate.\" It further states: \"If you desire long life, you must enter through the gate of your origin. Dwell and move with moderation, advance and retreat in proper measure, act and rest according to method, depart and remain by rule—thus may you extend life and cure illness.\"\n\nIt also says: \"Refining gold with gold is called true gold; refining a person with a person is called a true person. People often lose the Dao—it is not the Dao that loses people. People often depart from life—it is not life that departs from people. Always nourish the spirit and do not lose the Way of life. Let the Dao and life preserve each other, and spirit and life guard each other—then form and spirit shall both endure.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"A person refining qi is like a dragon refining water. Qi returns to the natural, spirit returns to emptiness, and essence returns to the Mud Pill Palace. Water flows from high sources: upward into the Celestial River, downward into the Yellow Springs, and horizontally into the hundred rivers—ultimately returning to the four seas. Qi and water circulate through heaven and earth, flow through the human body, revolving endlessly and operating without limit. If one can govern them, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, and one’s brightness matches the sun and moon.\"\n\nThe *Ancient Records of Prohibitions* state: \"A person’s primal qi is the feast of the spirit and soul, hence it is said: 'The cinnabar of the child advances the feast of the correct yellow.'\" Thus, the spirit consumes primal qi, while the form consumes the five flavors. When qi is clear, the spirit is bright; when qi is turbid, the spirit is sick. Therefore, one must constantly cultivate and refine qi, keeping it clear—this is called refining the spirit and refining the soul, repelling ghosts and controlling the po-soul, so that form and spirit are both at peace.\n\nThe hun descends from heaven and is called spirit; the po originates from earth and is called ghost. Ghosts belong to yin, and spirits belong to yang. Thus, refining the hun and spirit, and consuming primal qi, one may live for ten thousand years without dying and ascend to heaven in body. Consuming the five flavors and invoking lascivious ghosts, one dies ten thousand deaths, and the form perishes in the earth.\n\nWhen the hun flies to heaven and the po sinks into the springs, water and fire separate, each returning to its origin. In life, they share the same body; in death, they diverge. Flight and sinking differ—this is the natural endowment. Why is this so? Consider a single piece of wood: when burned by fire, the smoke rises, and the ash sinks—this, too, is naturally so.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Nine August Ones* states: Beneath the Primordial Azure, the moon and sun—two halves—rise together and merge into one. Emerging from that Jade Pool, they enter the Golden Chamber, large as a pellet and yellow as a tangerine. Within lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey; if you attain it, guard it well and do not lose it.\n\nA note explains: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube grow within the human body, their size like a pellet, their hue like a tangerine, their taste exceedingly sweet, sweet as honey. Neither far nor near, they reside in the Chamber of the Heart. The Chamber of the Heart is the abode of spirit, the dwelling of qi, the master of essence, the union of hun and po. The Jade Pool is the fluid produced upon the tongue within the mouth; when this fluid merges with spirit and qi, it is called the two halves becoming one.\n\nThe *Great Clarity Declaration* records: In a letter from Xu Yuanyou to Wang Xizhi, it is said: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube are the medicine of ascent. If you, my lord, can cut away the brambles, forsake self and other, and dissolve right and wrong, then these two trees will grow within your heart. Their leaves will flourish, their branches spread, they will bloom and bear fruit. If you partake of even one branch, you may traverse ten thousand miles in a single glance—this is the inner elixir.\n\nSimply nurture the spirit, harmonize the primal qi, and swallow the fluids. When the fluids and essence are inwardly secure, flourishing vitality arises, like a tree whose roots are strong and leaves luxuriant, blooming and bearing fruit, nurturing wondrous flavors surpassing the common. What grows within the heart is none other than the form and spirit. Yin and yang are like the sun and moon, rain and dew, gentle winds and harmonious mists—moistening, nourishing, and irrigating. When qi circulates and breath is regulated, the branches and leaves flourish. When the nature is pure and the heart joyful, the flowers bloom. When essence is preserved and the embryo retained, the fruit forms. When fluids flow smoothly, the flavor is sweet.\n\nThe oaths of the ancient immortals were solemn, transmitted mouth to mouth. Now, through brush and ink, they are bestowed—fitting to entrust to an extraordinary person. The *Forest of the Dao* states: This method is also called the *Rite of Jade Elixir and Golden Nectar*. Jade elixir and golden nectar refer to the refinement and consumption of the fluids within the mouth. They are: first, essence; second, tears; third, saliva; fourth, mucus; fifth, sweat; sixth, urine. Within the human body, these six fluids share a single primal qi, distributed among the five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and four limbs.\n\nThose who know the art can refrain from emission by year’s end—engaging in union without loss, becoming a solitary immortal who sleeps alone. If one can go all day without spitting, constantly holding and swallowing the saliva, the essence and qi will remain, the fluids will abide, and the face and eyes will radiate light. The *Laozi’s Sectional Exegesis* states: Saliva, when abundant, gathers as the Pool of Sweet Wine; when flowing, it becomes the Palace of the Flowery Pond; when dispersed, it is the fluids; when descending, it is sweet dew. Rinsing and swallowing it irrigates the viscera, moistens the body, unblocks the hundred vessels, nourishes the ten thousand spirits, strengthens the joints and hair, and ensures enduring vitality. This is the so-called inner golden nectar, which can nurture the spirit and replenish the primal qi.\n\nAs for refining jade into elixir and smelting gold into nectar, transforming their original substance to be supple yet unyielding, their color gleaming like ice and snow, their fragrance surpassing all scents—drinking a single cup, one’s lifespan will equal heaven’s. This is the so-called outer golden nectar, which can fortify the body and strengthen the viscera. Furthermore, one should not recklessly sweat, for sweat is the messenger of the spirit. When qi is harmonized and movement induces a slight sweat, it is fitting—only avoid rushing into cold winds. If extreme exertion robs the body of essence through sweat, the pulses will drip without cease, greatly exhausting spirit and form. One should move slowly, labor without excess, and in sitting or lying, avoid fatigue. In walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, always act with ease, practicing guiding and pulling, massage and regulation, so that upon rising, one feels light and agile, the mind unobstructed and at ease.\n\nAlso, attend to the two matters of excretion, neither forcibly restraining nor allowing excess. Whether obstructed, cold, slippery, or profuse, all harm qi and life, bringing swift calamity. This is what is meant by knowing advance and retreat, preservation and loss—the Dao of the sage. What both sage and commoner treasure is life; what both wise and foolish cherish is the body. Thus, the sage employs the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, humility, compassion, reverence, frugality, celestial patterns, and human affairs to foretell auspicious omens for the noble. Ritual, music, punitive expeditions, laws, punishments, ghosts, spirits, divination, dreams, and waking portents are shown to the petty.\n\nThe essentials of nurturing life begin by cautioning the external and then guarding the internal. When inner and outer are tranquil, this is called skillfully entering non-action. To seek non-action, one must first avoid harm. What does this mean? Keep distant from suspicion, petty people, ill-gotten gains, and reckless actions; be cautious in speech and diet, in the sharpness of the tongue, in bustling places, and in physical conflict. Constantly reflect on one’s faults and reform to follow goodness. Moreover, one should comprehend celestial patterns, earthly principles, human affairs, ghosts and spirits, timing, and arts and calculations. Thus, one’s merits will equal the sage’s, and one’s virtue will match heaven’s.\n\nAmong arts and calculations, none surpass refining the spirit and purifying the true qi to extend years and cure illness. Externally, one wards off evil and malign influences, purifies heart and body, so that misfortune does not encroach. The *Discourse on the Dao and Virtue* states: Among the images of the Great Center, none is loftier than the Dao and virtue; next, none is greater than spirit and illumination; next, none is more expansive than Great Harmony; next, none is more revered than heaven and earth; next, none is more evident than yin and yang; next, none is clearer than the sage’s works.\n\nThe Dao and virtue can be spoken of but not traced to their origin; spirit and illumination can be born but not extended; Great Harmony can be embodied but not transformed; heaven can be traversed but not proclaimed; yin and yang can be employed but not obtained; the sage’s works can be observed but not articulated. Know that what can be spoken of is not the natural Dao; what can be illuminated is not the pristine truth. For those who cultivate non-action to enter the true Dao, one must first preserve the Dao’s qi within the body and rest the primal qi within the viscera. Then, aided by medicinal substances and supported by a hundred practices, one can internally cure the ten thousand illnesses, externally pacify the ten thousand spirits, return the inner qi to its origin, and naturally repel external evil.\n\nRepelling calamities externally while nurturing spirit and virtue internally—when inner and outer mutually sustain one another, preserving body and life, is this not excellence?\n\nAs *Laozi* states: \"When merit is accomplished and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Dao of Heaven.\" It also says: \"When merit is accomplished and affairs completed, the people all say, ‘We are naturally so.’\" And further: \"Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.\" Observing the self through the self, observing the world through the world—how do I know the world’s nature? By this.\n\nThus, when instructing the Son of Heaven, one models affairs upon Heaven; when instructing feudal lords, one governs the state with proper administration; when instructing in military affairs, one dares not act as the host; when instructing in powerful implements, one must not display them to others; when instructing in worldly conduct, one harmonizes light and blends with the dust; when instructing in leaving the household, the Dao opposes the secular; when instructing in nurturing nature, the Valley Spirit does not die; when instructing in preserving life, good fortune and longevity do not perish; when instructing in cultivating the body, spirit is preserved and qi is complete; when instructing in cultivating the mind, the mind is emptied to guard the Dao; when instructing in foresight, one constantly excels at saving beings; when instructing in karmic retribution, spirits do not harm people. This is what is meant by \"few affairs, profound principles\"—all depends on the person’s preparation and transmission.\n\nThose who attain it possess bones and joints firm and strong, complexions joyful and lustrous; though old, they return to youth, neither declining nor decaying, abiding long in the world, attaining longevity and enduring vision. Cold, heat, wind, and dampness cannot harm them; ghosts, spirits, and spectral beings dare not approach; the five weapons and hundred insects dare not injure; sorrow, grief, joy, and anger do not burden them. Constantly using the Six Classics to instruct the common folk and employing masters of methods to transmit techniques—this is truly grasping the essentials of the Dao.\n\nThe Perfected One says: The sage knows that the primordial qi arises at *zi*, is born in the kidneys, is enveloped at *si*, gestates at *wu*, thus abides in the heart, rests in fire, is nurtured in *wei* earth, is born in *shen* metal, bathed in *you*, girded at *xu* earth, attains office and glory in *hai*, reigns as sovereign in *zi* water, declines in *chou* earth, ails in *yin* wood, dies in *mao* thunder, and is interred in *chen* wind. Interment means concealment, return, and ending.\n\nThe primordial qi originates in water and ultimately returns to wind, concealing wind within earth—this is called returning the hun-soul. *Xun* is wind, *chen* is earth; water flows and returns to *chen*, hence it is said that the earth is deficient in the southeast, and water flows into the *xun* gate. As *Liezi* states: \"Beyond the seas there is a great abyss called the Tail End, where all great waters drain.\" The primordial qi of humans likewise has a Tail End abyss, thus resembling water.\n\nKnow that earth conceals wind, wind conceals earth, earth conceals water, water conceals earth, earth conceals fire, fire conceals earth—thus fire is interred in *xu* earth, and water is interred in *chen* earth. Earth conceals wood, wood conceals earth, earth conceals metal, metal conceals earth—thus wood is interred in *wei* earth, and metal is interred in *chou* earth. Earth can conceal wood, metal, water, and fire, and earth itself also returns to earth—thus it is interred in *chen* earth. This is the Dao of returning to the origin, reverting to the root, and restoring life.\n\n*Laozi* says: \"The myriad beings flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring life; restoring life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity.\" This is to know the principle of the constant Dao and comprehend the affairs of the speakable Dao—then one knows the path of clarity and reaches the level expanse of the shore.\n\nThus it says: \"Know the white, guard the black—this is the model for the world. Knowing constancy, one is accommodating; being accommodating, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one accords with Heaven; according with Heaven, one accords with the Dao; according with the Dao, one endures.\" This is called the impartial Dao. \"Stealing\" the impartial Dao, \"stealing\" Heaven and Earth—all things are universally accommodated.\n\n*The Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* states: \"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.\" Thus it says: \"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are ordered; move the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace.\"\n\nThe Perfected One says: Those who know this Dao recognize true water and true fire, true lead and true mercury, true dragon and true tiger, true teeth and true chariot, true gold and true stone, true wood and true earth, true cinnabar and true medicine, true spirit and true qi, true beings and true essence, true guest and true host. Once all are recognized as true, then follow the teacher to employ the teacher, follow the Dao to employ the Dao, follow the technique to employ the technique, follow the method to employ the method. Refine and temper, wash and sift, grind and purify, harmonize and practice—this is why immortals call the eight-character wondrous gate and the one-origin true method: \"Empty the heart, fill the abdomen; hunger for qi, thirst for fluid.\"\n\nThe oral instruction says: \"Constantly maintain an empty and tranquil mind—even goodness is not stored, let alone a speck of filth or evil!\" This is what is meant by \"still the mind and guard the One, eliminate desires and cease disorder.\" When all impurities are removed, all affairs are complete. Always keep the abdomen full and replete—what is meant by \"the abdomen free of dregs and filth, containing only true essence and primordial qi.\" Refining and tempering without cease, naturally the flower blooms and the fruit forms.\n\nWhen hungry, swallow qi; when thirsty, swallow fluid. When neither hungry nor thirsty, harmonize and practice, ensuring circulation and flow, unobstructed and unimpeded, joyfully content, blissfully at ease—unaware of the size of Heaven and Earth, unaware of the revolutions of the sun and moon. One may take eight hundred and ten years as a single great cycle.\n\nAs for the methods of refinement: they speak of harmonizing and uniting spirit and qi, ensuring they circulate without exhaustion in the kidneys. The kidneys are the Gate of Life—hence this is called the art of life. When spirit and qi are inexhaustible, the bodily form attains long life. Refining the bones and transforming the form, one roams the imperial court, attains the rank of Perfected One, and nurtures the primordial qi—both men and women preserve it.\n\nThe *Scriptural Hymn* says: \"The Dao treasures essence; this treasure should be kept secret. Bestow it upon others, and they live; retain it for oneself, and one lives. Living for oneself, one eternally transcends the world, and one’s name is recorded in the register of immortals. If one is born into the world, the self is ensnared; when the self withdraws, merit is accomplished and fame attained.\"\n\nTo bind the infant is not yet possible—how much less to abandon it idly? Cast aside and unnoticed, it multiplies; with decline and age, life falls away.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess yin and yang; primordial qi is what humans treasure. To treasure it is to unite with the Dao—only then should one guard it with care. One who nurtures the primordial preserves it ceaselessly, ingesting its qi, returning its essence in cycles, refining its purest essence into harmony.\n\nOne who ingests primordial qi cannot be spoken of in the same breath as those who consume a single leaf or flower, a blade of grass or twig, the essence of lingzhi or minerals, the dregs of cinnabar or grit—how could they share the same year or age?\n\n*Laozi* says: Essence is the river-source of blood and vessels, the numinous spirit that guards the bones—thus it is treasured as a jewel. Qi is the cloud-vapor of flesh and muscle, the true substance that secures the form—thus it is treasured as life.\n\nThe human body mirrors a kingdom: spirit is the ruler, essence the minister, qi the people. When the people possess virtue, they may be revered; when the ruler follows the Dao, the realm endures forever. Thus, one who cultivates qi with merit may transform it into essence; one who nurtures essence with virtue may transform it into spirit; one who cultivates spirit with the Dao may transform it into the whole body, preserving life eternally.\n\nThe *Three-One Formula* says: In refining primordial qi and the true spirit, those who preserve the Three-One see essence transform into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant into the Perfected One, the Perfected One into the Red Child. The Red Child is the True One; the One is the Imperial Lord, who governs the body and commands the thirty-six thousand spirits. When the Imperial Lord dwells within, the thirty-six thousand spirits are all present—thus one may ascend in body to roam the imperial court.\n\nThe *Celestial Elder’s Ten Stems Classic* says: The Dao of ingesting qi holds qi as the supreme treasure. In one year, it fills and flourishes the skin; in two years, it harmonizes the joints; in three years, it strengthens the bones; in four years, it fills the marrow and brain to fullness. Heaven has four seasons, and qi responds in four years. Ingesting qi and guarding the One, with four years of accomplishment, spirit and form commune. When form communes with spirit, it shines like the sun—seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, arriving without movement, knowing without perception. This is called \"one form, a thousand spirits,\" and one is deemed an immortal; \"one form, ten thousand spirits,\" and one is called an infant; \"one form, eighteen thousand spirits,\" and one is called a Perfected One; \"one form, thirty-six thousand spirits,\" and one is called the Red Child, the True One and Imperial Lord. With the sun and moon, one attains long life; with Heaven and Earth, one shares their age—thus the Dao is perfected.\n\nPrimordial qi is one, yet in use it becomes two: employing yang qi, one may fly freely, ascend to the Great Clarity, and wander the Five Peaks; employing yin qi, one may abide in the world with long life, traverse the Great Yang, and roam cave grottoes. This is called the one nature of primordial qi with yin and yang as its two aspects. The One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things. Without primordial qi to distinguish the functions of yin and yang, the myriad things would have no means to be born, transform, and grow. Thus, without primordial qi, spirit is not numinous; without primordial qi, the Dao does not arise; without yin and yang, primordial qi has no form. Form requires qi, qi requires yin and yang, yin and yang require essence, essence requires spirit, spirit requires the Dao, the Dao requires technique, technique requires method, method requires the heart, the heart requires the One, the One requires the true, the true requires the ultimate—ultimate emptiness, ultimate purity, ultimate clarity, ultimate subtlety, ultimate brightness. The ultimate continues without end, transmitted only to those most intimate; it must be bestowed upon the right person—do not give it to those without the Dao.\n\nOne who studies the Dao engages in true study; one who studies external matters engages in excessive learning, which is also called the heterodox path. Studying the Dao is called inner study, which concerns the affairs of the inner heart—known as the Three Elixir Fields and the Three Primordial Qi. One elixir holds three spirits; one qi divides into six qi. Yang concludes at nine, yin at six; nine times six is fifty-four, the limit of Heaven and Earth, and also the human limit. Reaching this is called returning to the origin and reverting to the root.\n\nWhat is called the limit? It is when primordial qi is stored within, with no breath of entry or exit. Even where there are orifices for breath, there is no breath of entry or exit—this is called attaining the Dao, the ultimate void.\n\nThe *True Classic* says: In refining primordial qi to the point of no entry or exit of breath, one becomes a fugitive from the registers, no longer governed by the Great Yin, unrecorded by the Three Officials, and secretly guarded by the myriad spirits.\n\nWhat is called the Primal Chaos? It is qi. All things under the celestial cycle are named Primal Chaos. The qi of Primal Chaos originally arises from wind. Wind’s power is greatest—it sustains Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases. Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases cannot surpass the wind. Wind and qi share the same body, yet they can make flowers bloom and willows split, bear fruit and ripen—all through the four qi and eight winds.\n\nCultivating the heart is the root of the Three-One; refining qi is the tree of the flourishing Dao. With heart and qi, it is like preserving the tree and its root. The root is the heart—preserving the heart preserves qi; preserving qi preserves the One. The One is the Dao; preserving the Dao preserves the thirty-six thousand spirits in their entirety, stilling the myriad affairs. Stilling the myriad affairs, there is nothing not done; in doing nothing, the supreme elixir appears. One who ingests the supreme elixir shares the age of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat is the supreme elixir? It is the true spirit of the Elixir Field, the True One and Imperial Lord who dwells within as master, with all spirits preserving the body, primordial qi undispersed, thoughts severed from lust, qi obeying its spirit, restraining old qi, and attaining breath without entry or exit—one who masters fetal breathing will never see life overturned. This is called the form retaining qi and the spirit moving naturally.\n\nMaster Luo Gongyuan’s *Three Peaks Song* says: \"When a tree withers, earth is added to its roots; when yang declines, qi is replenished. Nurture primordial qi—take care not to lose measure.\"\n\nThe annotation states: \"Nothing is more devoid of passion than trees. When a tree reaches the point of withering decay, even if dust and soil are heaped upon its roots, it may yet flourish anew. Moreover, when tender branches are grafted onto an old tree, it too may attain long life, reverting to fresh vitality. Extending this principle, when yang declines, qi must be replenished—this is only fitting. If declining yang is supplemented with primordial qi without loss, drawing its essence and fluids back into the body, the countenance will return to youth. How much more so for one whose pure, original qi remains undispersed, whose primordial harmony is whole and unified! Should such a one encounter cultivation, the merit will be a hundredfold! Thus, those who study the Dao must take utmost care to prevent their own primordial qi from scattering and fleeing.\"\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"In cultivation, one must always remove the hairs from the nostrils, purge the filth and turbidity from the five viscera and six bowels, rinse the mouth and teeth, and bathe the body. Guard against excessive wine, shun inappropriate lust, and avoid improper conduct. When taking food or drink, first offer it before the Hall of Light, with the heart mindful of making sacrifice to the Three Elixir Fields, the Ninefold Unity and Imperial Perfected, and the thirty-six thousand spirit-lords. Maintain singular focus, harmonizing and regulating spirit and qi. From beginning to end, ensure the breath remains even. By steadfastly upholding this, essence and qi will be secured, and one may then practice breath-regulation.\n\nWhen regulating the breath, first close the mouth and silently observe the outer breath entering through the nose. With intention, anticipate the incoming breath by three parts and retain one part, allowing it to remain. Once the breath has fully entered, anticipate the outgoing breath by three parts and retain one part. In both inhalation and exhalation, regulate one part—this must not be interrupted. The subtlety of breath-regulation lies in harmonizing one’s intention with the nose, thereby naturally arresting the breath. If one does not regulate it, the breath will move autonomously in and out. But if one masters regulation, the breath will no longer dare to move freely—this is called regulation by the person, not by the breath.\n\nQi and spirit are governed by the Dao, and the Dao is governed by the heart; the heart is governed by intention. Thus, intention is the master of the Dao, and intention may also be called spirit. In general, spirit commands qi, and the subtlety lies in intention. If the nose loses control and the breath escapes through the mouth, one must labor to close it. Press the tongue against the teeth, and if slight discomfort arises, release it slightly, retaining one part in three before closing again. As described above, when regulating the breath, let the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, and the heart think nothing. Practice this cyclically and persistently.\n\nIf the qi is not yet harmonized, allow a small portion to escape. Once the intention senses the qi has harmonized, regulate it according to the method. If one’s intention can regulate the breath for a full day as if it were ordinary respiration, the qi will become permanently stabilized. No further release or regulation will be needed; through diligent practice, the qi will naturally remain at rest, no longer entering or exiting through the mouth and nose. Instead, it will flow and disperse effortlessly through the pores of the skin, like wind and clouds in the mountains, marshes, and heavens—free and unconstrained.\n\nAs the *Scripture of the Immortals* states: \"When primordial qi is harmonized and subdued, one may constantly ingest it without cessation or exhaustion, and it will no longer exit through the mouth and nose.\" After a hundred days of cultivation, the ears and eyes will naturally cease to perceive.\n\nThose who cultivate must not eat indiscriminately. Any flavor will cause primordial qi to surge and disrupt, preventing the heart from attaining purity. Those who disregard the teachings, indulging only in greed for wealth and sex, envy, gluttony for pungent and foul foods, harboring malice and resentment, disrespecting the methods of immortality, engaging in theft, betrayal, and rebellion—such wicked ones will have their transgressions recorded by the Three Officials. The Northern Yin will summon their souls, and before death, their spirits will scatter and vanish. They will forget past and future, becoming like the drunk and deluded, stumbling in confusion, suffering calamities, and extending misfortune to their nine generations. Their forms will perish in the Nine Springs—this is the consequence of losing the Dao and betraying the divine.\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"The Dao is without obligation and without favor. Have you not seen the *Scripture of the Unseen Correspondence*, which states: 'Heaven is without favor, yet great favor arises; heaven’s utmost selfishness is employed with utmost impartiality'? The regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death, and death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm, and harm arises from favor.\"\n\nThus, Heaven and the Dao show no partiality toward humans but extend favor to the myriad things. Humans and the myriad things naturally feel reverence and gratitude toward Heaven and the Dao, not presuming upon their merit. Utterly impartial, utterly selfless, they do not distinguish between right and wrong, great and small, noble and base. They abandon attachment and aversion, relinquishing all deliberation. Therefore, those who follow the celestial seasons will live, while those who defy the celestial will perish. Killing is not done out of selfishness, nor is life granted out of impartiality—it is simply that the rise and fall of beings follow their compliance or defiance, naturally resulting in life or death. Thus, the Dao is said to be without obligation and without favor.\n\nAs for the Dao’s accessibility: even enemies may be transformed by it, while those beyond its reach—even parents—will remain forever unenlightened. This is because predestined affinity or its absence is recorded in the celestial registers, not achieved in a single morning or evening. That which is transformed by life is called death, and that which is transformed by death is called life. The roots of life and death alternate in constant recurrence.\n\nThose who are adept at life do not engage in conduct that leads to death, while those unskilled in life do. Those who engage in conduct leading to death will die, while those who engage in conduct leading to life will live. Thus, all who attain life do so through qi. Qi can transform into life or death—into life when it transforms toward life, and into death when it transforms toward death. Hence it is said: \"The regulation of creatures lies in qi.\" It operates through qi’s resonance, not through force. Qi’s resonance arises from emptiness and nothingness, yet it governs the ten thousand existents. Even the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, clouds and thunder—all rely on qi’s circulation to prevent collapse and fall.\n\nVast and boundless, without beginning or end, it rests in its movement and delights in its stillness—this is the naturalness of Dao-qi. As for the regulation of creatures within the body, it truly depends on the heart. Whether one can regulate or not also depends on the heart.\n\nIn the dusty world of mortals, where only profit and fame prevail, one who neither flatters nor deceives, neither harms nor injures, who never disrupts the harmony of qi in things and always nurtures a heart of care—such a person approaches benevolence. One who neither covets nor contends, neither affirms nor denies—such a person approaches the Dao.\n\nNeither internal nor external, this treasure is held fast, and the numinous records of yin will inscribe its blessings. Disasters and calamities will recede, misfortunes and mishaps will be unable to intrude. Heaven above and earth below will take heed, lengthening one’s years and extending one’s lifespan. This is the origin of the great Dao’s primordial power.\n\nTo bestow kindness upon others is called *en* (grace); to harm or destroy others is called *hai* (injury). Practicing grace brings forth fortune; practicing injury brings forth misfortune. Do not, like one gazing into a mirror seeking an image, let suspicion arise from resonance. Among the deluded and the mad, demonic spirits will disturb the six inches of primordial qi, unsettling the hundred spirits. In an instant, one’s foundation may be lost—this is a profound warning.\n\nThe primordial qi spans six inches: three within and three without. If one can preserve one inch, thirty years of life are added. If one can secure all six inches, the myriad spirits will gather in the body, and one will naturally attain eternal longevity. Losing one inch reduces one’s lifespan by thirty years.\n\nThe *Formula of Primordial Qi* states: \"Heaven and earth may collapse, but my life remains natural.\" When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dark Pearl, he sent Li Lou, who failed to obtain it, while Wang Xiang succeeded. The Dark Pearl is qi; Li Lou is the eye, and Wang Xiang is the heart. The primordial void is the body of the Dao—empty, natural, and non-doing. Non-doing means the heart does not move. When the heart does not stir, external phenomena do not enter; inner and outer are at peace. When the spirit is settled and qi harmonized, primordial qi arrives of itself. When primordial qi arrives, the five viscera are nourished and unobstructed. When the five viscera are unobstructed, the hundred vessels flow freely. When the hundred vessels flow freely, fluids ascend in response, and one no longer craves the five flavors or suffers hunger or thirst. The three fields are forever sealed. When the Dao is accomplished, the body is full and the storehouses replete, and one’s complexion remains youthful and ever-spring.\n\nIn cultivating primordial qi, qi transforms into blood, blood into marrow. In one year, qi is renewed; in two years, blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form. From then on, one may extend life for ten thousand years—this is called an *immortal*. Nine years refine qi into form—this is called a *perfected one*. Further refining form into qi, and qi into spirit—this is called a *supreme one*.\n\nThe *Scripture of Immortals* states: \"The spirit always loves humanity, but humanity does not love the spirit.\" The spirit’s love lies in using the body to nurture the numinous. If one commits evil and brings misfortune, the body is ruined. Once the body is destroyed, the spirit departs, and death follows—how can one not be alarmed? This is what is meant by \"not knowing the constant and recklessly acting with malice.\"\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from the Sovereign One, the Sovereign asked what he had attained. The Emperor listed one thousand two hundred matters, to which the Sovereign replied: \"What you have attained are but minor affairs.\" He added: \"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be illuminated.\" The Three Ones are the first chapter of the *Yellow Register of the Supreme Sovereign*. Those who understand them will be untouched by the ten thousand misfortunes.\n\nFor the art of long life, nothing surpasses ingesting primordial qi, securing the inner through embryonic breathing, and refining the numinous fluid and golden elixir—these are the supreme medicines. Thus, hibernating creatures preserve themselves without eating, for they rely on their primordial qi. When the regulation of qi is accomplished, one may learn to swallow qi. Simply close the mouth, focus the intention, and gently swallow as if eating. Whether swallowing saliva or qi, do so as if swallowing food. Visualize it entering the kidneys and the Gate of Life, ascending along the spine into the palace of the brain, then irrigating the navel and the Five Stars. The five viscera meet, inner and outer resonate, each connected by primordial qi’s channels and bonds. In the circulation of primordial qi, there is no place it does not reach. For any illness within the body, inwardly visualize the five colors—gold, wood, water, fire, earth—mutually generating and overcoming. Direct intention to the afflicted area, and it will be instantly healed.\n\nThere is also a wondrous method: though the six breaths—*he*, *xi*, *hu*, *chui*, *xu*, and *si*—are known, they do not compare to the two breaths, cold and warm, in curing the hundred diseases. When regulating qi with ease over time, hold the breath until it warms before swallowing—this is *warm qi*, which cures deficiency and cold. If one swallows immediately upon filling with qi, it is *cold qi*, which cures deficiency and heat. In practice, one must gauge the situation with intention.\n\nFor certain illnesses, simply exhale *hehe* ten to thirty times, and one will know its efficacy. Wine poison and food poison are both expelled through the *he* breath. If one can single-mindedly ingest primordial qi and focus on one thing, visualizing and invoking it, one may shine as brightly as the sun and moon.\n\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear. Heaven is the mud-pill palace, containing the Double Field Palace and the Purple Palace—also called the Brain Palace. There are three palaces within: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the upper Three Ones, whose names are Red Child, Imperial Minister, and Primordial First. Constantly visualizing them sharpens the ears, brightens the eyes, and fills the brain.\n\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil. Earth is the qi sea within the navel, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the lower Three Ones, whose names are Infant, Primordial Yang, and Valley Dark. Visualizing them over time ensures the mouth never lacks fluids, the belly is full, the heart is still, and one is neither confused nor deluded—naturally communing with the numinous.\n\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes numinous. The heart governs the spirit; the heart is the sovereign, master of spirit and qi’s transformations. Responses follow the heart, neither existing nor non-existing, neither empty nor form. From coarse to subtle, from mortal to sage—the heart is the Crimson Palace, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the Three Ones, whose names are Perfected One, Vermilion Child, and Radiant Firmness. If one visualizes them without cease, the Imperial One will never leave the body and heart. Body and heart at peace, even if a blade threatens, one need only invoke the One to save another—and surely escape calamity. The Dao does not speak falsely.\n\nThe three Cinnabar Fields each house nine spirits, all three inches in height, clad in vermilion robes, vermilion caps, and vermilion shoes, seated upon golden beds and jade couches, with golden censers before them. Constantly visualize their forms and invoke the One—if male, the spirit is nine fen in height; if female, six fen. Both should be visualized and focused upon.\n\nThat which is called the primordial destiny is the primordial qi. The destiny of the embodied being cannot arise without qi. Secure the primordial with the Dao, secure destiny with techniques, and body, form, spirit, and qi will endure forever.\n\nThe spirit of my destiny is the Three Ones of the three Cinnabar Fields. Their forms, shadows, essence, radiance, qi, and complexion comprise thirty-six thousand spirits, all subjects of the Imperial One. One divides into two: yang qi transforms into the Primordial Dragon, yin qi transforms into the Jade Maiden.\n\nThe formula states: Where qi resides, spirit follows and arises; when spirit abides in qi, it returns; when spirit departs, qi disperses. If one can visualize and hold to the spirit to guard the primordial qi, qi will also become spirit, and spirit will also become qi. Cultivating to this point, when qi converges, it forms essence, radiance, qi, and complexion; when qi scatters, it becomes clouds, mist, wind, and rain. Emerging, it becomes disorder; entering, it becomes truth. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it serves as my body; in motion, it serves as my spirit. The resonance of form and spirit lies in their activation; the transformations of spirit and qi lie in visualization.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Origins* states: The spirit of the Upper Origin is named Primordial; the spirit of the Middle Origin is named Returning Cinnabar; the spirit of the Lower Origin is named Child Peace. These must also be visualized with the same focus as the Three Ones and the nine spirits. In all actions—coming and going, moving and resting, sitting and rising—encounter them thus. With concentrated intent and single-minded visualization, it is the profound within the profound, the utmost secret of the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "**On Primordial Qi (with Preface):**\n\nBefore the chaos, there was the Great Void;\nAt the dawn of chaos, the Great Harmony resided.\nSilent and vast, without preference or aversion—\nThe Three-in-One merged as the primordial origin,\nThe Six-in-One coalesced as qi,\nAll without form or image,\nProfound and obscure—\nThis was the Great Simplicity,\nWhen primordial qi had yet to take shape.\n\nNext came the Great Beginning,\nWhen primordial qi first sprouted;\nThen the Great Commencement,\nWhen form and qi first emerged;\nThen the Great Purity,\nWhen form and qi acquired substance;\nThen the Great Ultimate,\nWhen substance transformed and qi arose.\nBefore qi divided into forms,\nIt congealed like an embryo or egg,\nRound and complete in its qi—\nThis was called the Great Oneness.\n\nPrimordial qi, first pure, ascended to become Heaven;\nPrimordial qi, later turbid, descended to become Earth.\nThus, the Dao of the Great Void and emptiness was born.\nThe Dao, being unborn, is the root of spontaneity—\nIndescribable in name,\nYet we know spontaneity is the parent of the Dao,\nThe root of qi.\n\nSpontaneity is fundamentally One,\nThe Great Dao is fundamentally One,\nPrimordial qi is fundamentally One.\nThis One is the true, perfect, and primordial,\nPure yang qi,\nUnited in body with the Great Void,\nOf one heart with the Great Dao,\nOf one nature with spontaneity—\nThus it is without beginning or end,\nWithout form or image,\nPure and turbid as one,\nThe unformed chaos.\nTherefore, its depths cannot be fathomed.\n\nWhen primordial qi first stirred,\nSprouting forth in its infancy,\nHeaven and Earth divided,\nQian and Kun were established.\nYin and yang interacted,\nPrimordial qi spread forth,\nAnd from their harmony, humanity was conceived.\n\nFirst came Pangu,\nWho at death transformed his body:\nHis breath became wind and clouds,\nHis voice thunder,\nHis left eye the sun,\nHis right eye the moon,\nHis four limbs and five extremities the four poles and five peaks,\nHis blood rivers,\nHis sinews the earth’s veins,\nHis flesh fields and soil,\nHis hair and beard the stars,\nHis skin and hair the grasses and trees,\nHis teeth and bones metals and stones,\nHis essence and marrow pearls and jade,\nHis sweat rain and moisture.\nThe myriad creatures upon his body,\nStirred by the wind,\nTransformed into the black-haired people.\n\nBy Heaven’s decree, they were called \"the blue-born\";\nBy their black heads, \"the black-headed\";\nAlso \"the black-haired.\"\nThe basest among them were called \"blue heads.\"\nToday, people self-mockingly call themselves \"black-headed worms,\"\nOr \"naked worms\"—\nFor after Pangu and before the Three Sovereigns,\nAll were naked in form.\n\nIn the age of the Three Kings,\nThey began to cut hides and weave grass,\nBuild nests and dig caves,\nEating the fruits of grasses and trees,\nDevouring the flesh of birds and beasts,\nDrinking blood and chewing fur,\nCrude yet untroubled.\nLater, they roasted millet and split pigs,\nDrank from earthen cups,\nBeat clay drums,\nHarnessed the benefits of fire,\nThe advantages of silk and hemp,\nCast metal and molded clay,\nConstructed grand palaces,\nSet up watchtowers and barred gates,\nBuilt doors, windows, kitchens,\nRoasting, boiling, stewing, grilling—\nNurturing life and sending off the dead,\nHonoring ghosts and spirits.\n\nFrom the Great Void and primordial antiquity\nTo this age,\nThe record cannot be complete.\nFrom Fuxi to the present day,\nOver four thousand years have passed,\nWith births, deaths, and transformations,\nThe establishment of human relations,\nAs rulers and ministers,\nFathers and sons,\nRises and falls, gains and losses,\nAdvances and retreats, successes and failures—\nEarlier scholars recorded them,\nLater scholars inherited them,\nEndlessly entangled,\nImpossible to exhaust in a single discourse.\n\nMoreover, after Heaven and Earth emerged from the primordial mist,\nHumans arose from Pangu’s remains,\nScattered into the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth,\nThe patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth,\nThe Five Nets and Two Luminaries,\nThe intersecting paths of the Yellow and Red,\nThe Five Peaks and Hundred Rivers,\nDay and night,\nGiving birth to the myriad things,\nNurturing all beings—\nOf feathers, scales, and shells,\nEach numbering three hundred and sixty,\nTotaling one thousand eight hundred kinds.\nHumans, the foremost of creatures,\nAre counted among them.\n\nHumans and all living things\nAre endowed with the qi of the primordial One,\nAnd thus are born and formed.\nOf all that is born, grows, and matures,\nNone is more noble or precious\nThan the qi of humanity.\n\nHaving presumptuously partaken in this one kind,\nAnd shamefully usurped the role of the Three Powers,\nI have fished among the hundred schools,\nSifted through the ages,\nThoroughly discussed primordial qi,\nExhaustively traced its roots,\nCommitted myself to spontaneity,\nTurned my heart to the Great Dao,\nSought its profound truths,\nCompiled these arcane discourses,\nRecorded them in the true scriptures,\nTo be passed down to future sages.\nThose of understanding who encounter this,\nBeware of taking life lightly—\nDay by day, hour by hour,\nDiligently refine and practice,\nThat your crane-like spirit may dwell among white hair,\nAnd you not come to regret too late.\nThose of like mind who receive this,\nShould treasure it always.\n\n**Discourse:**\nPrimordial qi has no name,\nYet its transformations give rise to names;\nPrimordial qi envelops all alike,\nYet its transformations produce different kinds.\nIts enveloping is formless,\nThus it is called \"primordial\" as one qi;\nIts dwelling has form,\nThus it establishes myriad names and appearances.\nTherefore, \"the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\"\nConstantly desireless, observe its mystery;\nConstantly desiring, observe its manifestations.\nManifestations are the surface,\nMystery is the core.\nThe core is the foundation,\nThe surface is the beginning.\nThe beginning may be called the father,\nThe mystery the mother—\nThis is the Dao.\nThat which can be named is not the eternal name.\nThe two emerge together but differ in name.\nTogether they are called the Dao,\nApart they are called the profound.\nProfound upon profound—\nThe gateway to all mysteries.\n\nIt is also said:\nThere is a thing, formless yet complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nSilent and vast.\nStanding alone, unchanging,\nCircling without cease,\nIt may be called the mother of all under Heaven.\nI know not its name,\nSo I style it the Dao.\nIt is born of spontaneity.\n\nOnce the Great Dao exists,\nThe Dao gives birth to yin and yang,\nYin and yang give birth to Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth give birth to father and mother,\nFather and mother give birth to this body.\nEmotions, nature, form, and fate\nAre all endowed by primordial qi.\nNature is universally enveloped,\nFate differs by kind.\nNature cannot be separated from primordial qi,\nFate follows kind in its transformations.\nThus, the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual—\nThese five cannot be momentarily separated.\nThat which can be separated is not the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, or ritual.\n\nThe Dao is trust,\nThus it is honored in the central palace,\nCalled the Dao of the Yellow Emperor.",

fundamentally one,\nYet its transformations give rise to the ten thousand things.\nThe ten thousand things must obtain the One\nTo achieve generation and completion.\nIf the ten thousand things lose the One,\nThey immediately return to the realm of death—\nThus the One must not be lost.\n\nThe One is called the Great One.\nThe Great One divides to form Heaven and Earth,\nHeaven and Earth are called the Two Modes.\nThe Two Modes divide to establish the Three Powers,\nThe Three Powers refer to humanity—\nThus it is said: \"When the powers are complete, humanity is perfected.\"\nHumanity divides into the four seasons,\nThe four seasons divide into the five phases,\nThe five phases divide into the six pitch-pipes,\nThe six pitch-pipes divide into the seven governances,\nThe seven governances divide into the eight winds,\nThe eight winds divide into the nine qi.\nFrom one to nine is the number of yang;\nFrom two to eight is the number of yin.\nNine nines are eighty-one, the supreme limit of yang’s ninefold completion;\nEight eights are sixty-four, the supreme limit of yin’s sixfold completion.\n\nThe One contains the five qi—this is called universal enveloping;\nThe One

qi follow fate to form nature,\nPursue things as intentions shift,\nAnd are stained by customs and habits—\nThus their transformations are boundless,\nNot merely ten thousand in number,\nHence it is said: \"The wandering soul brings about change.\"\nFor instance:\nThe old man of Wudu transformed into a woman,\nThe ancestress of the Jiang clan transformed into a soft-shelled turtle,\nThe Black Womb Clan’s pig changed into a human,\nThe man of Kuaiwu in An transformed into a tiger—\nThese are verifications of the wandering soul.\n\nThe One contains the five qi:\nThe soft qi becomes water—water’s number is one;\nThe warm qi becomes fire—fire’s number is two;\nThe gentle qi becomes wood—wood’s number is three;\nThe hard qi becomes metal—metal’s number is four;\nThe wind qi becomes earth—earth’s number is five.\n\nBefore the five qi took form,\nBefore the Three Powers were divided,\nBefore the Two Modes were established,\nThere was chaos—\nAlso called the Primal Chaos,\nAlso called the primal mass like an egg.\nThe five qi were blended as one;\nOnce the One divided from the primal,\nIt arrayed itself as the five qi.\nWhen qi emerged, it bore images—\nThus it is called \"qi-images.\"\n\nZhang Heng’s *Ling Xian* and *Hun Tian Yi* state:\n\"The root of covering and supporting\nIs none other than primordial qi;\nThe origin of numinous luminaries\nIs the division of qi into primal images.\"\nIn ancient times, the former kings trod the celestial path,\nUsing it to establish numinous patterns.\nTracing back to the primal origin,\nThey first aligned it with the celestial sphere—\nThis was called the Correct Instrument,\nThis was called the Established Measure.\nOnly then could the August Ultimate be erected,\nAnd the revolutions of the heavens be examined—\nThis was the root of \"warping Heaven and wefting Earth.\"\n\nThe sage fundamentally has no mind,\nYet through this, a mind arises.\nThe mind is born of things,\nAnd dies in things.\nThe mechanism lies in the heart and eyes—\nThe ten thousand mechanisms of Heaven and Earth,\nSuccess and failure, rise and fall,\nGain and loss, departure and abiding—\nAll arise from the heart and eyes.\n\nDeath belongs to yin,\nLife belongs to yang.\nWithin yin and yang lies the art of the Way of life,\nYet those who do not know the path of cultivation\nConstantly wander the byways of life and death—\nThus Mo Di grieved over silk,\nAnd Yang Zhu wept at the fork in the road—\nThis is the reason.\n\nBefore the Great Simplicity,\nThere was profound clarity and mysterious stillness,\nSilent and dark, beyond all images.\nWithin, there was only emptiness;\nWithout, there was only nothingness.\nThis state endured eternally—\nIt is called the Primordial Abyss,\nThe root of the Dao.\n\nOnce directions were established,\nThe Great Simplicity began to sprout.\nThough sprouting, it had not yet manifested—\nOne qi, uniform in color,\nChaos undivided—\nThus it is said: \"There was a thing chaotically formed.\"\nYet though its qi was formed,\nIt could not yet take shape.\nIts measures of slowness and swiftness\nCould not yet undergo transformation.\nThis state endured eternally—\nIt is called the Vast Swan,\nThe trunk of the Dao.\n\nThen primordial qi split apart,\nHard and soft first divided,\nYin and yang conjoined their essences,\nClear and turbid took their separate places.\nHeaven was completed on the outside,\nEarth was settled within.\nHeaven embodies yang,\nResembling the trunk of the Dao—\nWith things, it forms a body;\nWith the compass, it covers and nurtures;\nThrough movement, it begins to generate.\nEarth embodies yin,\nResembling the root of the Dao—\nWith namelessness, it forms its substance;\nWith the square, it bears and gives birth;\nThrough stillness, it ends in death—\nThis is what is meant by \"Heaven is completed, Earth is leveled.\"\n\nOnce in motion, it acts and bestows;\nIn stillness, it contains and transforms.\nPent-up qi conjoins its essences,\nTimely nurturing the myriad kinds—\nThis is called the Celestial Origin,\nThe substance of the Dao.\n\nIn Heaven, images are formed;\nOn Earth, shapes are formed.\nHeaven has nine positions,\nEarth has nine regions.\nHeaven has the three luminaries,\nEarth has mountains and rivers.\nThere are images to be emulated,\nShapes to be measured.\nNatures and dispositions are infinitely varied,\nInterconnected and mutually responsive—\nNaturally giving rise to one another,\nBeyond all reckoning.\n\nThe warp and weft of the cosmic order—\nHere I briefly expound them.\nThe four directions and eight extremities\nAre the boundaries of Earth.\nIts diameter is 232,517 *li*;\nNorth to south is 1,000 *li* shorter,\nEast to west is 1,000 *li* broader.\nFrom Earth to Heaven is half the distance to the human pole;\nThe depth of the Earth’s center is likewise half this distance—\nThe diameter and circumference are half those of Heaven.\nCalculating the distance between Heaven and Earth:\n110,258.5 *li*—\nMultiplying this by four yields the great number of the Primal Chaos.\n\nThe Way of Heaven moves leftward,\nOpposing the movement of things—\nThus

      "translated_text": "The man proceeds thirty steps leftward from *zi*, the woman twenty steps rightward from *zi*, both arriving at *si*—here husband and wife conceive, receiving the qi of gestation. The man proceeds ten steps leftward from *si* to *yin*, the woman ten steps rightward from *si* to *shen*—both undergo ten months of receiving qi, until qi is full and form is complete; *yin* and *shen* are thus where man and woman are born.\n\nProceeding thirty steps leftward from *yin* to *wei*, *wei* is called \"Lesser Auspice,\" the culmination of a man’s life cycle. Proceeding twenty steps rightward from *shen* to *chou*, *chou* is called \"Greater Auspice,\" the culmination of a woman’s life cycle. Only then may a man marry and a woman be betrothed. If this order endures without cease, Primal Qi will never be exhausted, essence and qi will never scatter—thus can one attain long life.\n\nNow, the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth arises from the position of *zi*, which belongs to *Water*. The trigram of *Water* is *Kan*, governing the eternal North, corresponding to the *Yue* and *Jizhou* regions. Human Primal Qi is the same as that of Heaven and Earth, residing in the kidneys within the body.\n\nHuman Primal Qi possesses the marvel of natural stillness, embracing the pure, empty, and mysterious body. Mysterious beyond mystery, marvelous beyond marvel—this is called the \"Gate of Myriad Marvels,\" the wondrous path of Primal Qi. Thus, the mysterious is called *spirit*; the numinous of spirit is called the *Dao*; the Dao gives birth to the body of spontaneity—hence can one attain long life. The root of life is none other than Primal Qi.\n\nThe kidneys are the chamber of spirit; if spirit has no chamber, it cannot rest; if the chamber has no spirit, how can one be healthy? When the chamber is firm, spirit dwells in peace. Then one transforms from the mundane to the sagely, and spirit attains numinous communion. If spirit loves life but the chamber cannot be secured, spirit cannot rest, the chamber becomes desolate, and one is cast into the realm of death.\n\nIf one cultivates movement with subtlety, diligently refines progress, maintains inner purity and outer stillness, and severs all defilements, then the grandly fortified chamber will allow spirit and soul to dwell in peace. Spirit and its divine counterpart constantly serve as guardians; body and spirit mutually cherish and protect. Thus, when the body attains the Dao, spirit also attains the Dao; when the body attains immortality, spirit also attains immortality. Body and spirit depend on each other, reaching into the boundless.\n\nPrimal Qi is the source of life, namely the moving qi between the kidneys. It is the root of the five viscera and six bowels, the origin of the twelve meridians, the gate of breath, the source of the Triple Burner—also called the \"Spirit that Guards Against Evil.\" The sage likens it to a tree for illustration. This qi is the root of human life; if the root is severed, the viscera, bowels, sinews, and meridians become like branches and leaves—when the root rots, the branches wither, as is evident.\n\n**Question:** What is the moving qi between the kidneys?\n**Answer:** The right kidney is called the *Gate of Life*. The qi of the *Gate of Life* moves and emerges from between them, for the space is central, and movement arises from life. It is the tether of Primal Qi, the abode of spirit and essence. The *Gate of Life* holds the spirit of true essence, which excels at securing and guarding. When defense is perfect, evil qi cannot recklessly enter—hence it is called the \"Spirit that Guards Against Evil.\" If it fails to guard against evil, evil will enter, and upon entry, one dies.\n\nThat by which one preserves life is this: Primal Qi belongs to *yang*, and *yang* is *ying* (nutritive qi); blood and vessels belong to *yin*, and *yin* is *wei* (defensive qi). When *ying* and *wei* flow constantly, life endures. They are also called *ying* and *wei*: *ying* and *wei* are the flourishing qi and vessels, like the blossoming of trees. *Ying* and *wei* nourish the viscera and bowels, cherish spirit and qi, enabling their circulation and safeguarding the path of life.\n\nIt is also said: the clear is *ying*, the turbid is *wei*. *Ying* flows within the vessels, *wei* flows outside the vessels. By day, they circulate through the body; by night, they circulate through the viscera. In one hundred *ke*, they complete fifty cycles, converging at dawn. At the *cun*, *guan*, and *chi* positions of both hands, *yin* and *yang* interpenetrate and flow ceaselessly, like following a ring without end. If they cease, one dies; if they flow, one lives. Thus, one must regulate and nurture them, cherishing and preserving them so that *ying* and *wei* circulate without end, spirit and qi never deplete—then one may share the longevity of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAfter the separation of primordial chaos, the Three Primal Qi of Heaven, Earth, and Water gave rise to humanity and nurtured the myriad things. Humans emulate this, designating the Three Burners and Three Elixir Fields to nourish the body and generate spirit and qi.\n\nThere are three positions but no distinct organ; they reside within the body, governing three functions. The Upper Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Heaven and is called the Upper Elixir Field. Its domain extends from above the stomach orifice, below the heart and above the diaphragm, up to the Muddy Pellet. The Upper Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Heaven’s Primal, governing the *Danzhong* point in the chest. The *Danzhong* point regulates warmth between the skin and muscles, like the irrigation of mist and dew.\n\nThe Middle Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Earth and is called the Middle Elixir Field. Its domain extends from below the heart and diaphragm to the navel. The Middle Elixir Field receives the yin qi of Earth’s Primal, governing the stomach duct. The stomach duct point lies below the heart, governing the decomposition of grains and ripening of fluids, transforming the flavors of water and grain in the stomach to produce blood and nourish the viscera, bowels, and body—like the steaming of Earth’s qi.\n\nThe Lower Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Water and is called the Lower Elixir Field. Its domain extends from the navel down to the bladder and *Louquan* point. The Lower Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Water’s Primal, governing the *Qihai* point one *cun* below the navel, residing in the *Qijie* (Street of Qi), which is the pathway of qi.\n\nThe Triple Burner is the master of qi circulation, hence it resides in the *Qijie*, a thoroughfare connecting all directions. The Lower Burner governs the movement of qi and blood, the circulation of meridians, the gathering of spirit and essence, and the interplay of *yin* and *yang*—like water flowing toward moisture, moisture being the source. Moisture refers to water flowing downward, irrigating in due time. Cloud qi ascends, then descends as rain.\n\nThe *Immortal Classic* states: \"My life is in my hands. Preserve essence and receive qi—longevity knows no limit.\"",

      "translated_text": "It further states: \"Do not exhaust your form, do not dissipate your essence. Return the heart to stillness and silence—thus may one attain long life. The root of life and destiny lies decisively in this Way. Though one may practice breathwork and daoyin, cultivate blessings and merit, study myriad methods, or ingest great elixirs, without knowing the Way of primal qi, it is like a tree with lush branches and leaves but no roots—how can it live long?\n\nIf one indulges in the pleasures of the long night—sensual delights and carnal joys—these may seem abundant, yet one will ultimately encounter the sorrow of early death and the eternal pain of burial in the yellow springs. Such shallowness is indeed extreme. But if one spends years in diligent cultivation, following methods to extend life, adhering to the Jade Canon’s teachings, observing dietary prohibitions, and grasping the essence of primal qi—restraining the hun-soul, controlling the po-soul, preserving the embryo, and halting essence—this shallowness is not present. One will ultimately attain enduring longevity and dwell forever in the celestial realms. Such profundity is indeed extreme.\n\nThus, the limits of life and destiny are truly finite, while the passions of desire are boundlessly insatiable. To pursue endless desires with a finite life is to hasten one’s own destruction. Earth may muddy a river, but it cannot muddy the sea; wind may uproot a tree, but it cannot uproot a mountain. Desire may disturb the petty person, but it cannot move the noble one—why is this so? The noble one is a hermit, while the petty person is a wanderer.\n\nOne must recognize that one’s nature has limits, and life’s tenure is precarious. If the pivotal mechanism is not shown, the essential Way not transmitted, the heart’s compliance not proclaimed, and the essence of refinement not imparted, then even a single phrase may remain unknown for ages, and a lifetime of study may not yield the hearing of the Dao.\n\nWhat, then, is the Dao? The Dao is primal qi. Primal qi is the end of life. The end of life lies solely in the art of the center. Taking the preservation of the Dao as the method and the transformation of essence as the subtlety, one causes qi to flow unimpeded. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot.\n\nIf one knows the mystery within the mystery, and man and woman cultivate together, husband and wife both become immortals—this is called the wondrous Way. The *Immortal Classic* states: \"One yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of the Three Primes and Two Harmonies is called the elixir. Tracing the flow to replenish the brain is called returning; essence transforming into qi is called transmutation. With each transmutation, one change, one augmentation—each transformation extends life by one cycle, and nine transformations extend it by one hundred and eight years.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: \"Inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, preserve and guard the natural. First honor the qi, for qi is the source of life.\" The Way of augmentation and transformation—augmentation refers to augmenting essence, and transformation refers to transforming form. Those who can augment and transform are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals; those who cannot augment nor transform do not escape the calamity of death.\n\nThose who practice this Way are said to constantly contemplate the Numinous Treasure. The numinous is spirit, and the treasure is essence. Simply cherish qi and treasure essence, grasp firmly and close the mouth, swallow qi and swallow fluids. Fluids transform into essence, essence into qi, qi into spirit, spirit back into fluids, fluids back into essence, essence back into qi, qi back into spirit. Thus, seven returns and seven reversions, nine transformations and nine changes—once essence is augmented, form is transformed. This transformation is not death but the living transformation of form: changing old age into youth, youth into childhood, childhood into infancy, and infancy into the newborn. This is the true person.\n\nWhen this Way is accomplished, it is called embryonic breathing. With unwavering cultivation, spirit and essence overflow, primal qi grows robust, the brain congeals, and the bones are renewed. As the *Immortal Classic* says: \"In the Way of yin and yang, essence and fluids are the treasure. Guard them carefully, and one may grow old only after the celestial mandate.\" It further states: \"If you desire long life, you must enter through the gate of your origin. Dwell and move with moderation, advance and retreat in proper measure, act and rest according to method, depart and remain by rule—thus may you extend life and cure illness.\"\n\nIt also says: \"Refining gold with gold is called true gold; refining a person with a person is called a true person. People often lose the Dao—it is not the Dao that loses people. People often depart from life—it is not life that departs from people. Always nourish the spirit and do not lose the Way of life. Let the Dao and life preserve each other, and spirit and life guard each other—then form and spirit shall both endure.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"A person refining qi is like a dragon refining water. Qi returns to the natural, spirit returns to emptiness, and essence returns to the Mud Pill Palace. Water flows from high sources: upward into the Celestial River, downward into the Yellow Springs, and horizontally into the hundred rivers—ultimately returning to the four seas. Qi and water circulate through heaven and earth, flow through the human body, revolving endlessly and operating without limit. If one can govern them, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, and one’s brightness matches the sun and moon.\"\n\nThe *Ancient Records of Prohibitions* state: \"A person’s primal qi is the feast of the spirit and soul, hence it is said: 'The cinnabar of the child advances the feast of the correct yellow.'\" Thus, the spirit consumes primal qi, while the form consumes the five flavors. When qi is clear, the spirit is bright; when qi is turbid, the spirit is sick. Therefore, one must constantly cultivate and refine qi, keeping it clear—this is called refining the spirit and refining the soul, repelling ghosts and controlling the po-soul, so that form and spirit are both at peace.\n\nThe hun descends from heaven and is called spirit; the po originates from earth and is called ghost. Ghosts belong to yin, and spirits belong to yang. Thus, refining the hun and spirit, and consuming primal qi, one may live for ten thousand years without dying and ascend to heaven in body. Consuming the five flavors and invoking lascivious ghosts, one dies ten thousand deaths, and the form perishes in the earth.\n\nWhen the hun flies to heaven and the po sinks into the springs, water and fire separate, each returning to its origin. In life, they share the same body; in death, they diverge. Flight and sinking differ—this is the natural endowment. Why is this so? Consider a single piece of wood: when burned by fire, the smoke rises, and the ash sinks—this, too, is naturally so.\"",

The Lower Burner governs the movement of qi and blood, the circulation of meridians, the gathering of spirit and essence, and the interplay of *yin* and *yang*—like water flowing toward moisture, moisture being the source. Moisture refers to water flowing downward, irrigating in due time. Cloud qi ascends, then descends as rain.\n\nThe *Immortal Classic* states: \"My life is in my hands. Preserve essence and receive qi—longevity knows no limit.\"",

      "translated_text": "The *Scripture of the Nine August Ones* states: Beneath the Primordial Azure, the moon and sun—two halves—rise together and merge into one. Emerging from that Jade Pool, they enter the Golden Chamber, large as a pellet and yellow as a tangerine. Within lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey; if you attain it, guard it well and do not lose it.\n\nA note explains: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube grow within the human body, their size like a pellet, their hue like a tangerine, their taste exceedingly sweet, sweet as honey. Neither far nor near, they reside in the Chamber of the Heart. The Chamber of the Heart is the abode of spirit, the dwelling of qi, the master of essence, the union of hun and po. The Jade Pool is the fluid produced upon the tongue within the mouth; when this fluid merges with spirit and qi, it is called the two halves becoming one.\n\nThe *Great Clarity Declaration* records: In a letter from Xu Yuanyou to Wang Xizhi, it is said: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube are the medicine of ascent. If you, my lord, can cut away the brambles, forsake self and other, and dissolve right and wrong, then these two trees will grow within your heart. Their leaves will flourish, their branches spread, they will bloom and bear fruit. If you partake of even one branch, you may traverse ten thousand miles in a single glance—this is the inner elixir.\n\nSimply nurture the spirit, harmonize the primal qi, and swallow the fluids. When the fluids and essence are inwardly secure, flourishing vitality arises, like a tree whose roots are strong and leaves luxuriant, blooming and bearing fruit, nurturing wondrous flavors surpassing the common. What grows within the heart is none other than the form and spirit. Yin and yang are like the sun and moon, rain and dew, gentle winds and harmonious mists—moistening, nourishing, and irrigating. When qi circulates and breath is regulated, the branches and leaves flourish. When the nature is pure and the heart joyful, the flowers bloom. When essence is preserved and the embryo retained, the fruit forms. When fluids flow smoothly, the flavor is sweet.\n\nThe oaths of the ancient immortals were solemn, transmitted mouth to mouth. Now, through brush and ink, they are bestowed—fitting to entrust to an extraordinary person. The *Forest of the Dao* states: This method is also called the *Rite of Jade Elixir and Golden Nectar*. Jade elixir and golden nectar refer to the refinement and consumption of the fluids within the mouth. They are: first, essence; second, tears; third, saliva; fourth, mucus; fifth, sweat; sixth, urine. Within the human body, these six fluids share a single primal qi, distributed among the five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and four limbs.\n\nThose who know the art can refrain from emission by year’s end—engaging in union without loss, becoming a solitary immortal who sleeps alone. If one can go all day without spitting, constantly holding and swallowing the saliva, the essence and qi will remain, the fluids will abide, and the face and eyes will radiate light. The *Laozi’s Sectional Exegesis* states: Saliva, when abundant, gathers as the Pool of Sweet Wine; when flowing, it becomes the Palace of the Flowery Pond; when dispersed, it is the fluids; when descending, it is sweet dew. Rinsing and swallowing it irrigates the viscera, moistens the body, unblocks the hundred vessels, nourishes the ten thousand spirits, strengthens the joints and hair, and ensures enduring vitality. This is the so-called inner golden nectar, which can nurture the spirit and replenish the primal qi.\n\nAs for refining jade into elixir and smelting gold into nectar, transforming their original substance to be supple yet unyielding, their color gleaming like ice and snow, their fragrance surpassing all scents—drinking a single cup, one’s lifespan will equal heaven’s. This is the so-called outer golden nectar, which can fortify the body and strengthen the viscera. Furthermore, one should not recklessly sweat, for sweat is the messenger of the spirit. When qi is harmonized and movement induces a slight sweat, it is fitting—only avoid rushing into cold winds. If extreme exertion robs the body of essence through sweat, the pulses will drip without cease, greatly exhausting spirit and form. One should move slowly, labor without excess, and in sitting or lying, avoid fatigue. In walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, always act with ease, practicing guiding and pulling, massage and regulation, so that upon rising, one feels light and agile, the mind unobstructed and at ease.\n\nAlso, attend to the two matters of excretion, neither forcibly restraining nor allowing excess. Whether obstructed, cold, slippery, or profuse, all harm qi and life, bringing swift calamity. This is what is meant by knowing advance and retreat, preservation and loss—the Dao of the sage. What both sage and commoner treasure is life; what both wise and foolish cherish is the body. Thus, the sage employs the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, humility, compassion, reverence, frugality, celestial patterns, and human affairs to foretell auspicious omens for the noble. Ritual, music, punitive expeditions, laws, punishments, ghosts, spirits, divination, dreams, and waking portents are shown to the petty.\n\nThe essentials of nurturing life begin by cautioning the external and then guarding the internal. When inner and outer are tranquil, this is called skillfully entering non-action. To seek non-action, one must first avoid harm. What does this mean? Keep distant from suspicion, petty people, ill-gotten gains, and reckless actions; be cautious in speech and diet, in the sharpness of the tongue, in bustling places, and in physical conflict. Constantly reflect on one’s faults and reform to follow goodness. Moreover, one should comprehend celestial patterns, earthly principles, human affairs, ghosts and spirits, timing, and arts and calculations. Thus, one’s merits will equal the sage’s, and one’s virtue will match heaven’s.\n\nAmong arts and calculations, none surpass refining the spirit and purifying the true qi to extend years and cure illness. Externally, one wards off evil and malign influences, purifies heart and body, so that misfortune does not encroach. The *Discourse on the Dao and Virtue* states: Among the images of the Great Center, none is loftier than the Dao and virtue; next, none is greater than spirit and illumination; next, none is more expansive than Great Harmony; next, none is more revered than heaven and earth; next, none is more evident than yin and yang; next, none is clearer than the sage’s works.\n\nThe Dao and virtue can be spoken of but not traced to their origin; spirit and illumination can be born but not extended; Great Harmony can be embodied but not transformed; heaven can be traversed but not proclaimed; yin and yang can be employed but not obtained; the sage’s works can be observed but not articulated. Know that what can be spoken of is not the natural Dao; what can be illuminated is not the pristine truth. For those who cultivate non-action to enter the true Dao, one must first preserve the Dao’s qi within the body and rest the primal qi within the viscera. Then, aided by medicinal substances and supported by a hundred practices, one can internally cure the ten thousand illnesses, externally pacify the ten thousand spirits, return the inner qi to its origin, and naturally repel external evil.",

Interment means concealment, return, and ending.\n\nThe primordial qi originates in water and ultimately returns to wind, concealing wind within earth—this is called returning the hun-soul. *Xun* is wind, *chen* is earth; water flows and returns to *chen*, hence it is said that the earth is deficient in the southeast, and water flows into the *xun* gate. As *Liezi* states: \"Beyond the seas there is a great abyss called the Tail End, where all great waters drain.\" The primordial qi of humans likewise has a Tail End abyss, thus resembling water.\n\nKnow that earth conceals wind, wind conceals earth, earth conceals water, water conceals earth, earth conceals fire, fire conceals earth—thus fire is interred in *xu* earth, and water is interred in *chen* earth. Earth conceals wood, wood conceals earth, earth conceals metal, metal conceals earth—thus wood is interred in *wei* earth, and metal is interred in *chou* earth. Earth can conceal wood, metal, water, and fire, and earth itself also returns to earth—thus it is interred in *chen* earth. This is the Dao of returning to the origin, reverting to the root, and restoring life.\n\n*Laozi* says: \"The myriad beings flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring life; restoring life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity.\" This is to know the principle of the constant Dao and comprehend the affairs of the speakable Dao—then one knows the path of clarity and reaches the level expanse of the shore.\n\nThus it says: \"Know the white, guard the black—this is the model for the world. Knowing constancy, one is accommodating; being accommodating, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one accords with Heaven; according with Heaven, one accords with the Dao; according with the Dao, one endures.\" This is called the impartial Dao. \"Stealing\" the impartial Dao, \"stealing\" Heaven and Earth—all things are universally accommodated.\n\n*The Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* states: \"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace.\" Thus it says: \"Eat in season, and the hundred bones are ordered; move the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace.\"\n\nThe Perfected One says: Those who know this Dao recognize true water and true fire, true lead and true mercury, true dragon and true tiger, true teeth and true chariot, true gold and true stone, true wood and true earth, true cinnabar and true medicine, true spirit and true qi, true beings and true essence, true guest and true host. Once all are recognized as true, then follow the teacher to employ the teacher, follow the Dao to employ the Dao, follow the technique to employ the technique, follow the method to employ the method. Refine and temper, wash and sift, grind and purify, harmonize and practice—this is why immortals call the eight-character wondrous gate and the one-origin true method: \"Empty the heart, fill the abdomen; hunger for qi, thirst for fluid.\"\n\nThe oral instruction says: \"Constantly maintain an empty and tranquil mind—even goodness is not stored, let alone a speck of filth or evil!\" This is what is meant by \"still the mind and guard the One, eliminate desires and cease disorder.\" When all impurities are removed, all affairs are complete. Always keep the abdomen full and replete—what is meant by \"the abdomen free of dregs and filth, containing only true essence and primordial qi.\" Refining and tempering without cease, naturally the flower blooms and the fruit forms.\n\nWhen hungry, swallow qi; when thirsty, swallow fluid. When neither hungry nor thirsty, harmonize and practice, ensuring circulation and flow, unobstructed and unimpeded, joyfully content, blissfully at ease—unaware of the size of Heaven and Earth, unaware of the revolutions of the sun and moon. One may take eight hundred and ten years as a single great cycle.\n\nAs for the methods of refinement: they speak of harmonizing and uniting spirit and qi, ensuring they circulate without exhaustion in the kidneys. The kidneys are the Gate of Life—hence this is called the art of life. When spirit and qi are inexhaustible, the bodily form attains long life. Refining the bones and transforming the form, one roams the imperial court, attains the rank of Perfected One, and nurtures the primordial qi—both men and women preserve it.\n\nThe *Scriptural Hymn* says: \"The Dao treasures essence; this treasure should be kept secret. Bestow it upon others, and they live; retain it for oneself, and one lives. Living for oneself, one eternally transcends the world, and one’s name is recorded in the register of immortals. If one is born into the world, the self is ensnared; when the self withdraws, merit is accomplished and fame attained.\"",

      "translated_text": "To bind the infant is not yet possible—how much less to abandon it idly? Cast aside and unnoticed, it multiplies; with decline and age, life falls away.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess yin and yang; primordial qi is what humans treasure. To treasure it is to unite with the Dao—only then should one guard it with care. One who nurtures the primordial preserves it ceaselessly, ingesting its qi, returning its essence in cycles, refining its purest essence into harmony.\n\nOne who ingests primordial qi cannot be spoken of in the same breath as those who consume a single leaf or flower, a blade of grass or twig, the essence of lingzhi or minerals, the dregs of cinnabar or grit—how could they share the same year or age?\n\n*Laozi* says: Essence is the river-source of blood and vessels, the numinous spirit that guards the bones—thus it is treasured as a jewel. Qi is the cloud-vapor of flesh and muscle, the true substance that secures the form—thus it is treasured as life.\n\nThe human body mirrors a kingdom: spirit is the ruler, essence the minister, qi the people. When the people possess virtue, they may be revered; when the ruler follows the Dao, the realm endures forever. Thus, one who cultivates qi with merit may transform it into essence; one who nurtures essence with virtue may transform it into spirit; one who cultivates spirit with the Dao may transform it into the whole body, preserving life eternally.\n\nThe *Three-One Formula* says: In refining primordial qi and the true spirit, those who preserve the Three-One see essence transform into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant into the Perfected One, the Perfected One into the Red Child. The Red Child is the True One; the One is the Imperial Lord, who governs the body and commands the thirty-six thousand spirits. When the Imperial Lord dwells within, the thirty-six thousand spirits are all present—thus one may ascend in body to roam the imperial court.\n\nThe *Celestial Elder’s Ten Stems Classic* says: The Dao of ingesting qi holds qi as the supreme treasure. In one year, it fills and flourishes the skin; in two years, it harmonizes the joints; in three years, it strengthens the bones; in four years, it fills the marrow and brain to fullness. Heaven has four seasons, and qi responds in four years. Ingesting qi and guarding the One, with four years of accomplishment, spirit and form commune. When form communes with spirit, it shines like the sun—seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, arriving without movement, knowing without perception. This is called \"one form, a thousand spirits,\" and one is deemed an immortal; \"one form, ten thousand spirits,\" and one is called an infant; \"one form, eighteen thousand spirits,\" and one is called a Perfected One; \"one form, thirty-six thousand spirits,\" and one is called the Red Child, the True One and Imperial Lord. With the sun and moon, one attains long life; with Heaven and Earth, one shares their age—thus the Dao is perfected.\n\nPrimordial qi is one, yet in use it becomes two: employing yang qi, one may fly freely, ascend to the Great Clarity, and wander the Five Peaks; employing yin qi, one may abide in the world with long life, traverse the Great Yang, and roam cave grottoes. This is called the one nature of primordial qi with yin and yang as its two aspects. The One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things. Without primordial qi to distinguish the functions of yin and yang, the myriad things would have no means to be born, transform, and grow. Thus, without primordial qi, spirit is not numinous; without primordial qi, the Dao does not arise; without yin and yang, primordial qi has no form. Form requires qi, qi requires yin and yang, yin and yang require essence, essence requires spirit, spirit requires the Dao, the Dao requires technique, technique requires method, method requires the heart, the heart requires the One, the One requires the true, the true requires the ultimate—ultimate emptiness, ultimate purity, ultimate clarity, ultimate subtlety, ultimate brightness. The ultimate continues without end, transmitted only to those most intimate; it must be bestowed upon the right person—do not give it to those without the Dao.\n\nOne who studies the Dao engages in true study; one who studies external matters engages in excessive learning, which is also called the heterodox path. Studying the Dao is called inner study, which concerns the affairs of the inner heart—known as the Three Elixir Fields and the Three Primordial Qi. One elixir holds three spirits; one qi divides into six qi. Yang concludes at nine, yin at six; nine times six is fifty-four, the limit of Heaven and Earth, and also the human limit. Reaching this is called returning to the origin and reverting to the root.\n\nWhat is called the limit? It is when primordial qi is stored within, with no breath of entry or exit. Even where there are orifices for breath, there is no breath of entry or exit—this is called attaining the Dao, the ultimate void.\n\nThe *True Classic* says: In refining primordial qi to the point of no entry or exit of breath, one becomes a fugitive from the registers, no longer governed by the Great Yin, unrecorded by the Three Officials, and secretly guarded by the myriad spirits.\n\nWhat is called the Primal Chaos? It is qi. All things under the celestial cycle are named Primal Chaos. The qi of Primal Chaos originally arises from wind. Wind’s power is greatest—it sustains Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases. Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases cannot surpass the wind. Wind and qi share the same body, yet they can make flowers bloom and willows split, bear fruit and ripen—all through the four qi and eight winds.\n\nCultivating the heart is the root of the Three-One; refining qi is the tree of the flourishing Dao. With heart and qi, it is like preserving the tree and its root. The root is the heart—preserving the heart preserves qi; preserving qi preserves the One. The One is the Dao; preserving the Dao preserves the thirty-six thousand spirits in their entirety, stilling the myriad affairs. Stilling the myriad affairs, there is nothing not done; in doing nothing, the supreme elixir appears. One who ingests the supreme elixir shares the age of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhat is the supreme elixir? It is the true spirit of the Elixir Field, the True One and Imperial Lord who dwells within as master, with all spirits preserving the body, primordial qi undispersed, thoughts severed from lust, qi obeying its spirit, restraining old qi, and attaining breath without entry or exit—one who masters fetal breathing will never see life overturned. This is called the form retaining qi and the spirit moving naturally.\n\nMaster Luo Gongyuan’s *Three Peaks Song* says: \"When a tree withers, earth is added to its roots; when yang declines, qi is replenished. Nurture primordial qi—take care not to lose measure.\"",

      "translated_text": "The annotation states: \"Nothing is more devoid of passion than trees. When a tree reaches the point of withering decay, even if dust and soil are heaped upon its roots, it may yet flourish anew. Moreover, when tender branches are grafted onto an old tree, it too may attain long life, reverting to fresh vitality. Extending this principle, when yang declines, qi must be replenished—this is only fitting. If declining yang is supplemented with primordial qi without loss, drawing its essence and fluids back into the body, the countenance will return to youth. How much more so for one whose pure, original qi remains undispersed, whose primordial harmony is whole and unified! Should such a one encounter cultivation, the merit will be a hundredfold! Thus, those who study the Dao must take utmost care to prevent their own primordial qi from scattering and fleeing.\"\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"In cultivation, one must always remove the hairs from the nostrils, purge the filth and turbidity from the five viscera and six bowels, rinse the mouth and teeth, and bathe the body. Guard against excessive wine, shun inappropriate lust, and avoid improper conduct. When taking food or drink, first offer it before the Hall of Light, with the heart mindful of making sacrifice to the Three Elixir Fields, the Ninefold Unity and Imperial Perfected, and the thirty-six thousand spirit-lords. Maintain singular focus, harmonizing and regulating spirit and qi. From beginning to end, ensure the breath remains even. By steadfastly upholding this, essence and qi will be secured, and one may then practice breath-regulation.\n\nWhen regulating the breath, first close the mouth and silently observe the outer breath entering through the nose. With intention, anticipate the incoming breath by three parts and retain one part, allowing it to remain. Once the breath has fully entered, anticipate the outgoing breath by three parts and retain one part. In both inhalation and exhalation, regulate one part—this must not be interrupted. The subtlety of breath-regulation lies in harmonizing one’s intention with the nose, thereby naturally arresting the breath. If one does not regulate it, the breath will move autonomously in and out. But if one masters regulation, the breath will no longer dare to move freely—this is called regulation by the person, not by the breath.\n\nQi and spirit are governed by the Dao, and the Dao is governed by the heart; the heart is governed by intention. Thus, intention is the master of the Dao, and intention may also be called spirit. In general, spirit commands qi, and the subtlety lies in intention. If the nose loses control and the breath escapes through the mouth, one must labor to close it. Press the tongue against the teeth, and if slight discomfort arises, release it slightly, retaining one part in three before closing again. As described above, when regulating the breath, let the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, and the heart think nothing. Practice this cyclically and persistently.\n\nIf the qi is not yet harmonized, allow a small portion to escape. Once the intention senses the qi has harmonized, regulate it according to the method. If one’s intention can regulate the breath for a full day as if it were ordinary respiration, the qi will become permanently stabilized. No further release or regulation will be needed; through diligent practice, the qi will naturally remain at rest, no longer entering or exiting through the mouth and nose. Instead, it will flow and disperse effortlessly through the pores of the skin, like wind and clouds in the mountains, marshes, and heavens—free and unconstrained.\n\nAs the *Scripture of the Immortals* states: \"When primordial qi is harmonized and subdued, one may constantly ingest it without cessation or exhaustion, and it will no longer exit through the mouth and nose.\" After a hundred days of cultivation, the ears and eyes will naturally cease to perceive.\n\nThose who cultivate must not eat indiscriminately. Any flavor will cause primordial qi to surge and disrupt, preventing the heart from attaining purity. Those who disregard the teachings, indulging only in greed for wealth and sex, envy, gluttony for pungent and foul foods, harboring malice and resentment, disrespecting the methods of immortality, engaging in theft, betrayal, and rebellion—such wicked ones will have their transgressions recorded by the Three Officials. The Northern Yin will summon their souls, and before death, their spirits will scatter and vanish. They will forget past and future, becoming like the drunk and deluded, stumbling in confusion, suffering calamities, and extending misfortune to their nine generations. Their forms will perish in the Nine Springs—this is the consequence of losing the Dao and betraying the divine.\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"The Dao is without obligation and without favor. Have you not seen the *Scripture of the Unseen Correspondence*, which states: 'Heaven is without favor, yet great favor arises; heaven’s utmost selfishness is employed with utmost impartiality'? The regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death, and death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm, and harm arises from favor.\"\n\nThus, Heaven and the Dao show no partiality toward humans but extend favor to the myriad things. Humans and the myriad things naturally feel reverence and gratitude toward Heaven and the Dao, not presuming upon their merit. Utterly impartial, utterly selfless, they do not distinguish between right and wrong, great and small, noble and base. They abandon attachment and aversion, relinquishing all deliberation. Therefore, those who follow the celestial seasons will live, while those who defy the celestial will perish. Killing is not done out of selfishness, nor is life granted out of impartiality—it is simply that the rise and fall of beings follow their compliance or defiance, naturally resulting in life or death. Thus, the Dao is said to be without obligation and without favor.\n\nAs for the Dao’s accessibility: even enemies may be transformed by it, while those beyond its reach—even parents—will remain forever unenlightened. This is because predestined affinity or its absence is recorded in the celestial registers, not achieved in a single morning or evening. That which is transformed by life is called death, and that which is transformed by death is called life. The roots of life and death alternate in constant recurrence.\n\nThose who are adept at life do not engage in conduct that leads to death, while those unskilled in life do. Those who engage in conduct leading to death will die, while those who engage in conduct leading to life will live. Thus, all who attain life do so through qi. Qi can transform into life or death—into life when it transforms toward life, and into death when it transforms toward death. Hence it is said: \"The regulation of creatures lies in qi.\" It operates through qi’s resonance, not through force. Qi’s resonance arises from emptiness and nothingness, yet it governs the ten thousand existents. Even the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, clouds and thunder—all rely on qi’s circulation to prevent collapse and fall.\n\nVast and boundless, without beginning or end, it rests in its movement and delights in its stillness—this is the naturalness of Dao-qi. As for the regulation of creatures within the body, it truly depends on the heart. Whether one can regulate or not also depends on the heart.",

      "translated_text": "In the dusty world of mortals, where only profit and fame prevail, one who neither flatters nor deceives, neither harms nor injures, who never disrupts the harmony of qi in things and always nurtures a heart of care—such a person approaches benevolence. One who neither covets nor contends, neither affirms nor denies—such a person approaches the Dao.\n\nNeither internal nor external, this treasure is held fast, and the numinous records of yin will inscribe its blessings. Disasters and calamities will recede, misfortunes and mishaps will be unable to intrude. Heaven above and earth below will take heed, lengthening one’s years and extending one’s lifespan. This is the origin of the great Dao’s primordial power.\n\nTo bestow kindness upon others is called *en* (grace); to harm or destroy others is called *hai* (injury). Practicing grace brings forth fortune; practicing injury brings forth misfortune. Do not, like one gazing into a mirror seeking an image, let suspicion arise from resonance. Among the deluded and the mad, demonic spirits will disturb the six inches of primordial qi, unsettling the hundred spirits. In an instant, one’s foundation may be lost—this is a profound warning.\n\nThe primordial qi spans six inches: three within and three without. If one can preserve one inch, thirty years of life are added. If one can secure all six inches, the myriad spirits will gather in the body, and one will naturally attain eternal longevity. Losing one inch reduces one’s lifespan by thirty years.\n\nThe *Formula of Primordial Qi* states: \"Heaven and earth may collapse, but my life remains natural.\" When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dark Pearl, he sent Li Lou, who failed to obtain it, while Wang Xiang succeeded. The Dark Pearl is qi; Li Lou is the eye, and Wang Xiang is the heart. The primordial void is the body of the Dao—empty, natural, and non-doing. Non-doing means the heart does not move. When the heart does not stir, external phenomena do not enter; inner and outer are at peace. When the spirit is settled and qi harmonized, primordial qi arrives of itself. When primordial qi arrives, the five viscera are nourished and unobstructed. When the five viscera are unobstructed, the hundred vessels flow freely. When the hundred vessels flow freely, fluids ascend in response, and one no longer craves the five flavors or suffers hunger or thirst. The three fields are forever sealed. When the Dao is accomplished, the body is full and the storehouses replete, and one’s complexion remains youthful and ever-spring.\n\nIn cultivating primordial qi, qi transforms into blood, blood into marrow. In one year, qi is renewed; in two years, blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form. From then on, one may extend life for ten thousand years—this is called an *immortal*. Nine years refine qi into form—this is called a *perfected one*. Further refining form into qi, and qi into spirit—this is called a *supreme one*.\n\nThe *Scripture of Immortals* states: \"The spirit always loves humanity, but humanity does not love the spirit.\" The spirit’s love lies in using the body to nurture the numinous. If one commits evil and brings misfortune, the body is ruined. Once the body is destroyed, the spirit departs, and death follows—how can one not be alarmed? This is what is meant by \"not knowing the constant and recklessly acting with malice.\"\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from the Sovereign One, the Sovereign asked what he had attained. The Emperor listed one thousand two hundred matters, to which the Sovereign replied: \"What you have attained are but minor affairs.\" He added: \"If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be illuminated.\" The Three Ones are the first chapter of the *Yellow Register of the Supreme Sovereign*. Those who understand them will be untouched by the ten thousand misfortunes.\n\nFor the art of long life, nothing surpasses ingesting primordial qi, securing the inner through embryonic breathing, and refining the numinous fluid and golden elixir—these are the supreme medicines. Thus, hibernating creatures preserve themselves without eating, for they rely on their primordial qi. When the regulation of qi is accomplished, one may learn to swallow qi. Simply close the mouth, focus the intention, and gently swallow as if eating. Whether swallowing saliva or qi, do so as if swallowing food. Visualize it entering the kidneys and the Gate of Life, ascending along the spine into the palace of the brain, then irrigating the navel and the Five Stars. The five viscera meet, inner and outer resonate, each connected by primordial qi’s channels and bonds. In the circulation of primordial qi, there is no place it does not reach. For any illness within the body, inwardly visualize the five colors—gold, wood, water, fire, earth—mutually generating and overcoming. Direct intention to the afflicted area, and it will be instantly healed.\n\nThere is also a wondrous method: though the six breaths—*he*, *xi*, *hu*, *chui*, *xu*, and *si*—are known, they do not compare to the two breaths, cold and warm, in curing the hundred diseases. When regulating qi with ease over time, hold the breath until it warms before swallowing—this is *warm qi*, which cures deficiency and cold. If one swallows immediately upon filling with qi, it is *cold qi*, which cures deficiency and heat. In practice, one must gauge the situation with intention.\n\nFor certain illnesses, simply exhale *hehe* ten to thirty times, and one will know its efficacy. Wine poison and food poison are both expelled through the *he* breath. If one can single-mindedly ingest primordial qi and focus on one thing, visualizing and invoking it, one may shine as brightly as the sun and moon.\n\nHeaven attains the One and becomes clear. Heaven is the mud-pill palace, containing the Double Field Palace and the Purple Palace—also called the Brain Palace. There are three palaces within: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the upper Three Ones, whose names are Red Child, Imperial Minister, and Primordial First. Constantly visualizing them sharpens the ears, brightens the eyes, and fills the brain.\n\nEarth attains the One and becomes tranquil. Earth is the qi sea within the navel, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the lower Three Ones, whose names are Infant, Primordial Yang, and Valley Dark. Visualizing them over time ensures the mouth never lacks fluids, the belly is full, the heart is still, and one is neither confused nor deluded—naturally communing with the numinous.\n\nThe spirit attains the One and becomes numinous. The heart governs the spirit; the heart is the sovereign, master of spirit and qi’s transformations. Responses follow the heart, neither existing nor non-existing, neither empty nor form. From coarse to subtle, from mortal to sage—the heart is the Crimson Palace, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the Three Ones, whose names are Perfected One, Vermilion Child, and Radiant Firmness. If one visualizes them without cease, the Imperial One will never leave the body and heart. Body and heart at peace, even if a blade threatens, one need only invoke the One to save another—and surely escape calamity. The Dao does not speak falsely.",
      "overlap_context": "ptiness and nothingness, yet it governs the ten thousand existents. Even the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, clouds and thunder—all rely on qi’s circulation to prevent collapse and fall.\n\nVast and boundless, without beginning or end, it rests in its movement and delights in its stillness—this is the naturalness of Dao-qi. As for the regulation of creatures within the body, it truly depends on the heart. Whether one can regulate or not also depends on the heart.",

      "translated_text": "The three Cinnabar Fields each house nine spirits, all three inches in height, clad in vermilion robes, vermilion caps, and vermilion shoes, seated upon golden beds and jade couches, with golden censers before them. Constantly visualize their forms and invoke the One—if male, the spirit is nine fen in height; if female, six fen. Both should be visualized and focused upon.\n\nThat which is called the primordial destiny is the primordial qi. The destiny of the embodied being cannot arise without qi. Secure the primordial with the Dao, secure destiny with techniques, and body, form, spirit, and qi will endure forever.\n\nThe spirit of my destiny is the Three Ones of the three Cinnabar Fields. Their forms, shadows, essence, radiance, qi, and complexion comprise thirty-six thousand spirits, all subjects of the Imperial One. One divides into two: yang qi transforms into the Primordial Dragon, yin qi transforms into the Jade Maiden.\n\nThe formula states: Where qi resides, spirit follows and arises; when spirit abides in qi, it returns; when spirit departs, qi disperses. If one can visualize and hold to the spirit to guard the primordial qi, qi will also become spirit, and spirit will also become qi. Cultivating to this point, when qi converges, it forms essence, radiance, qi, and complexion; when qi scatters, it becomes clouds, mist, wind, and rain. Emerging, it becomes disorder; entering, it becomes truth. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it serves as my body; in motion, it serves as my spirit. The resonance of form and spirit lies in their activation; the transformations of spirit and qi lie in visualization.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Three Origins* states: The spirit of the Upper Origin is named Primordial; the spirit of the Middle Origin is named Returning Cinnabar; the spirit of the Lower Origin is named Child Peace. These must also be visualized with the same focus as the Three Ones and the nine spirits. In all actions—coming and going, moving and resting, sitting and rising—encounter them thus. With concentrated intent and single-minded visualization, it is the profound within the profound, the utmost secret of the Dao.",
