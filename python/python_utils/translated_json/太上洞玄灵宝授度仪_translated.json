This work expounds the rituals for transmitting the ancient *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Mystery Section, *Weiyi* (威仪) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial on the *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***\n\nYour servant Xiujing, abiding in the utmost Dao and reverently awaiting the numinous scriptures, has never forgotten them even in haste. By fortunate coincidence, one of humble grass and thatch has been permitted to peruse the dragon-and-phoenix chapters. The profound and august majesty is beyond what I can bear; my heart is filled with both joy and fear, like ice and fire.\n\nSince presumptuously receiving these teachings seventeen years ago, I have devoted all sincerity and thought to upholding and studying them, immersing myself in the divine texts and savoring their mysterious essence. With mind fixed and eyes intent, I have striven for mastery, holding fast to my resolve and exerting myself day and night without respite. Through careful examination of what I have received, I have roughly attained a comprehensive understanding. I feel my spirit awakened and my mind enlightened, gradually grasping the principles and their return to the source. The subtle meanings and wondrous subtleties are inherently beyond my reach, yet the coarse traces and proximate purport may be faintly glimpsed.\n\nI humbly observe that the great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure descends to deliver humanity. The ancient catalog of its arcane regulations comprises thirty-six fascicles. Its talismans and diagrams arise naturally from emptiness, and its eulogies and explanations are inscribed by the highest perfected ones. It is the path by which immortals and sages ascend, the guiding norm across kalpas. Its language is wondrously elegant and august; its matters are truly essential and profoundly subtle. Its words are pure, empty, mysterious, and refined; its principles are deep, abstruse, and boundless. It clarifies the distinctions between sin and blessing, adapts its methods to circumstances, and provides precepts, regulations, and rituals to guide all directions. Its numinous sounds resonate in eight directions, opening the ears of the deaf and the eyes of the blind. Its Dharma gates extend in four directions, accommodating both the great and the small. Its vast transformation is immeasurable, like an infinite bridge of Dharma.\n\nYet when the true teaching first arose, the celestial scriptures were treasured and revered. The profound store of the Great Existence was not fully revealed. However, among the scriptures now extant—those transmitted from the Primordial Beginning and those received by the Perfected Lords—thirty-five fascicles that I have verified are complete, with roots and branches, exterior and interior, mutually supporting one another. The body of the Great Vehicle is amply provided for.\n\nYet for the ordination rites, only two memorials exist. There are no established forms for petitions, memorials, or invocations. When the sages transmit the Dharma, the celestial perfected ones are arrayed in full, and there is no need for the cumbersome invocation of names. But in this defiled and turbid world below, divine officials must be moved to respond. Without complete regulations, the foolish are left without guidance.\n\nSince the Numinous Treasure began guiding the world, those who have transmitted it have sometimes conferred the Three Caverns together, sharing the same altar and covenant. The refined and the coarse are intermingled, the great and the small are confounded. At times, one receives only the Cavern Mystery, yet employs the rites of the higher Dharma. Proclamations and summonses are misapplied, with no proper authority to oversee them. Some borrow from the lower paths of the Yellow and Red Officials, descending to the base and vulgar, forcing what is inappropriate, causing inversion and chaos. They fail to adhere to proper forms, deviate from the hidden classics, and mislead later disciples.\n\nI sigh over this morning and night, my heart aching as if weeping blood. Yet the true teachers are distant and unattainable, and I cannot hope to seek them out. The worldly teachings lack these texts, and the urgent need for them demands fulfillment. Thus, I dare, in my ignorance, to consult the *Golden and Yellow Registers*, the *Luminous Perfected Jade Instructions*, and the *Instructions on the Scripture of the True One’s Spontaneity*. Following the models of the myriad perfected sages who conferred ordination, I have compiled rites for the assembly of the divine officials of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences at the altar for the covenant oath, establishing a complete set of ritual procedures.\n\nYet these matters are profoundly abstruse and utterly transcendent, beyond the measure of mortal eyes. The affairs of the divine are subtle—how could a corpse-like fool comprehend them? My hand trembles as I write, my body and soul both unraveling. I fear that errors may incur guilt, and that my creation may invite punishment. Hesitant and apprehensive, I tread as if upon blades and poison.\n\nThough the compilation is complete, I dare not presume to use it. I have purified myself and observed a fast before the Three Treasures, reciting it once through. I humbly beseech the Supreme Ones, the myriad venerables, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center to deign to inspect and examine my submission. If there is even the slightest merit in it, I beg that it be permitted for use. If it is not acceptable, I shall promptly destroy it. Whether it is fitting or not must be determined by numinous signs. I earnestly pray for a response, awaiting a manifestation. With reverence, I submit this.\n\nYour servant Xiujing, with utmost trepidation and awe, bows twice and respectfully reports.\n\nYour servant Lu Xiujing respectfully presents this.\n\n---\n\n**The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***\n\nThe *Yellow Register’s Brief Text on the Ranks of Transcendent Immortals* states: When receiving the scriptures and Dharma, one should initiate nineteen disciples for the Three Masters, establishing merit and virtue so that their names are recorded in the heavens. Only then may they ascend the altar to swear the covenant, receive the *True Writ of the Five Elders in Red Script and Jade Chapters*, the *Twenty-Four Perfected of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences*, and the offices of the celestial transcendent riders and highest perfected ones. Those who receive the great Dharma without having established merit and fame will be seized by the Three Officials, facing bitter retribution in life and death, and will be examined by the Court of Illuminating Dharma.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: The covenant requires 24,000 gold coins as a pledge to the twenty-four qi-generating officials. If this solemn pledge is lacking, the gods of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life. If gold is unavailable, copper may be used as a substitute. If entirely lacking, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the General Divine Court.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Five taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Five Marchmounts as a pledge for the precious scriptures. The *Jade Instructions* state: Nine taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Nine Heavens. If lacking, one incurs the penalty for disrespecting the scriptures. The numinous mountains of the Five Marchmounts will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of learning, and the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Yin Officials.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Forty feet of figured silk from each of the five directions are used to invoke the Five Emperors as a pledge for the oath. If lacking, the Five Emperors will not accept the disciple’s name, and the demon kings of the Five Emperors will harm them, causing their aspirations and thoughts to waver. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the Water Officials and the Court of the Springs and Bends.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Three gold dragons and three gold buttons are cast into mountains, waters, and earth as a pledge for learning transcendence. If these are not offered, the Three Officials will seize the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life, and their prayers will not be answered. Violations fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of the Nine Capitals.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: Five feet of crimson-patterned silk from Nanhe—crimson-figured silk—is torn to serve as a cloth upon the altar table, upon which the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writ* and the Five Talismans are invoked.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: Five feet of azure silk from Bilin—blue-figured silk—is cut to serve as a cloth to cover the True Writ and talismans.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: The True Writ and Five Talismans are placed between the crimson and azure silks, forming the covenant of tonsure and blood-oath. The azure silk substitutes for hair, the crimson for the blood-oath pledge; thus the perfected ones avoid harming their spirit and diminishing their virtue, and so these are used in their stead.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: Five blended incenses—though the scripture does not specify the quantity—are customarily measured as two *dou* and five *sheng*. Additionally, one *dou* of five-colored mixed flowers is required, to be scattered in the ten directions during the perfected one’s transmission of the precepts. Five large mats, a seven-patterned altar table, five incense burners with lidded boxes, and a length of life-bestowing silk corresponding to the disciple’s age in *chi* are also needed.\n\nThe eight items listed above are used as pledges for the altar rites and oaths.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: In spring, the rites are performed on *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, on *dingsi* and *bingwu* days; during the four seasons, on *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou* days; in autumn, on *gengshen* and *xinyou* days; and in winter, on *guihai* and *renzi* days. The rites are conducted on the days of the establishing *wang* phase.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: A high altar is constructed upon the sacred peaks, enclosed with railings on four sides. Five gates are opened to the east, west, south, and north, each marked with a placard bearing the following inscriptions:\n\n**Azure Heaven of the Nine Qi**\n*Anbao Hualin Qingling Shilao Jun, Cangdi Jun, Jiuqi Qingya Tianjun, Taishang Zhenyu Qingyao Yunü, Dongxiang Zhulingguan.*\n**Gate of Primordial Azure Radiance.**\nInscribed in azure on a crimson ground, placed above the eastern gate.\n\n**Cinnabar Heaven of the Three Qi**\n*Fanbao Changyang Danling Zhenlao Jun, Chidi Jun, Zhudan Sanqi Tianjun, Yuanqi Zhangren, Zhugong Taidan Yunü, Nanxiang Zhulingguan.*\n**Gate of Grand Yang and Great Light.**\nInscribed in crimson on a yellow ground, placed above the southern gate.\n\n**Primordial Cavern of the Great Emperor**\n*Tianyu Baoyuan Lingyuan Laojun, Taidi Zhenren, Zidan Huangting Wuji Tian Cang Yunü, Zhonghuang Dadi Guan Jun.*\n**Gate of Primordial Yellow and Lofty Dawn.**\nInscribed in yellow on a white ground, placed above the central gate.\n\n**Golden Gate of the Seven Qi of White Heaven**\n*Qibao Jinmen Haoling Huanglao Jun, Baidi Jun, Mingshi Qiqi Dafu, Taishang Baisu Yunü, Xixiang Zhulingguan.*\n**Gate of Penetrating Yin and the Golden Portal.**\nInscribed in white on a black ground, placed above the western gate.\n\n**Mystic Heaven of the Five Qi**\n*Dongyin Shuojue Wuling Xuanlao Jun, Heidi Jun, Xuanzhi Wuqi Tianjun, Taishang Lingjun, Yeguang Yunü, Beixiang Zhulingguan.*\n**Gate of Yin’s Birth and Vast Spirit.**\nInscribed in black on an azure ground, placed above the northern gate.\n\n**Primordial Yellow and Lofty Dawn Gate**\nAll spirits of the Nine Heavens, perfected ones of the Five Peaks and sacred mountains, the Three Officials of the Four Seas and Nine Bureaus, all earthbound immortals, jade maidens, flying immortals of the Five Peaks, and all divine immortals and lords.\nInscribed in purple on a yellow ground, placed to the left of the central gate.\n\nTo the right, six plaques are affixed above the five gates—one plaque each for the eastern, western, southern, and northern gates, positioned according to their directions. Above the central gate, the symbols for *wu* and *ji* are displayed, while the two plaques of the Nine Heavens are placed to the left and right of the gate. Five incense burners are arranged within the altar. Beneath the five tables, five-colored silken banners corresponding to the five directions are laid out. An additional table is set in the center of the altar to receive the *True Writings of the Five Talismans* and scriptures. Another table is prepared for submitting memorials and conducting rituals, making a total of seven tables. Gold and coin offerings are arrayed before the ritual table.\n\nThe *Yellow Register Simplified Writings* states: Those who receive the teachings must adhere to the luminous statutes, present their credentials to the master, and observe a seven-day fast. They shall submit a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the heavens for the sacred texts. The altar is exposed to the open air for one night; if no wind stirs and the writings remain unshaken, the candidate’s bone-name aligns with the Dao, and the transmission may proceed after the oath. If the wind disturbs the writings, the candidate must retreat and fast for three more days, then repeat the ritual as before. Should the wind disrupt the proceedings three times, and the candidate lacks a predestined name or virtuous merit, the Three Realms will not acknowledge them, the Five Emperors will not protect them, their bone-*qi* will not harmonize, and the teachings must not be lightly transmitted. This is examined and verified by the Bureau of Rectification.\n\nFor the great oath of the *Numinous Treasure* and the overnight exposure of the true writings, the order of submitting memorials and exiting the official precincts is as follows:\n\nOnce the altar is established in the sacred mountain site, the master and disciple enter together through the earthly gate, circling left. The master enters the inner altar’s royal gate, facing north to offer incense three times. First, the two registers of true writings received by the disciple are placed upon the table. The disciple proceeds to the outer altar, faces south, turns north, and bows three times, prostrating to present the memorial. The master sounds the celestial drum thirty-six times. Next, the incense burner is kindled according to ritual, followed by the exit from the official precinct.\n\nWith reverence, the five bodily *zhen* officials and *gongcao* officers within your servant’s person emerge; the three caverns’ flying immortals within your servant’s person emerge—ascending to the Three Heavens, the enforcers of the Dao and transformers of yin and yang, the *gongcao* officers who deliver the Dao and dispel calamities, disperse misfortunes, and resolve adversities—each in groups of eleven. The high perfected officials and governing officers within your servant’s person, the *Jianjie Jian’gong* Great General of the established banner, the *Xiaogong* officers of the vanguard and *Xiaosha* officers of the rearguard, the *Yiting* Commandant and *Yiting* Aide, the four divisions’ *Jiangong* inspectors and *Yezhe* heralds, the immortal and numinous *Zhishi* envoys within your servant’s person, the *Zhengyi Gongcao*, the *Zhibing Gongcao*, the left and right *Guanshizhe*, the yin-yang divine adjudicators, the *Keche Chifu* officers, the *Gangfeng Qizhi* couriers bearing memorials—each in pairs—emerge. Those who emerge don their solemn regalia, robes, and pendent tassels, arraying their majestic presence.\n\nThe *Zhishi Gongcao* wears the *Tongtian* crown and a black single-layered robe; the *Zhengyi Gongcao* dons the *Zhuyang* turban and a crimson single-layered robe; the envoys wear the *Jiude* crown and five-colored longevity robes, girded with tiger tallies, bearing on the left a *Liujin* fire bell and on the right the *Huoluo Qiyuan*, each holding a jade tablet. The *Zhishi Gongcao* stands at the center; the *Zhibing Gongcao* guards your servant’s person; the left *Guanshizhe* holds the banner in front; the right *Guanshizhe* raises the standard behind; the yang divine adjudicator stands to the left; the yin divine adjudicator stands to the right; the upper division *Gongcao* gazes afar toward the heavens; the middle division *Gongcao* surveys the eight directions; the *Cuqi Gongcao* urges the ten directions; the *Du Guan Shizhe* encircles your servant’s person.\n\nThe *Lang* officers and tiger warriors, the *Chajian Qiji* inspectors of the capital bureau, the celestial armored soldiers, the *Tianding* warriors, the *Shouqi Shiqi* officers, the *Shoushen Shishen* officers, the *Shougui Shigui* officers, the *Shoujing Shijing* officers, the *Shoudu Shidu* officers, the *Shouxie Shixie* officers, the *Zhufu Pomiao* officers, the *Keche Chifu* officers, the *Gangfeng Qizhi* couriers bearing memorials, the *Feilong* cavalry officers, and the garrisoned officers stand before and behind your servants.\n\nOnce the left and right *Gongcao* envoys have completed their solemn preparations, they array the ceremonial regalia, summoning the officials of the *Numinous Treasure* bureau, the *Jianzhai* immortal kings, the *Dianjing* attendants, the *Weiling* marshals, the various lords, officers, and generals of the Three Caverns, the twenty-four *zhi* established by the Celestial Master, the thirty-six *jing* hermitages, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains including Kunlun, and the over thirty-six thousand celestial officials of the upper realms—along with the sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng*; the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth; the officials, lords, generals, and officers of the Three Realms; the *Erxuan Sanyuan Sishi* of the Dao; the *Fengqi Zhuqi Jiazi* officials of the four directions and orientations; the summoned *Lao* Lords of the Eastern Nine Yi Hu, the Southern Eight Man Yue, the Western Six Rong Shi, the Northern Five Di Qiang, and the Central Three Qin Cang; the lords of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, hills, and marshes; the *Mengzhang* of the myriad temples in high mountains and low valleys, the Twelve Stream Women, and the original land deities of root and origin; and the officers of the altars and soil—all at once don their solemn regalia and, together with the *Gongcao* envoys and *Feilong* cavalry officers within your servant’s person, ascend to address the *Taishang Xuanyuan Taishang Da Daojun*, the *Taishang Laojun*, the *Taishang Zhangren*, the *Wushang Xuanlao*, the *Tianzun* of the Ten Directions and Boundless Dao, the myriad sagely and virtuous hosts, the *Zhizhen* Great Emperors, the Celestial Thearchs, the Celestial Masters, the Female Masters, the Three Master Lords, and the Ladies of their courts.\n\nThe twelve scribal attendants handling documents proceed in order, following the memorial’s protocol. Your servant, having reverently received the *Lingbao* Great Dharma, the numinous true writings, the two registers of the *Bajing Neiyin*, and the yellow silk memorial, now places them upon the jade table for perusal.\n\nThe exit from the official precinct is complete. Next, the memorial is read aloud.\n\nNext, the solemn charge is reiterated.\n\nThe true officials of your servant’s five bodily constituents, one minor attendant, and the twelve scribal aides are again commanded to array themselves in full regalia, donning caps and pendent tassels, and to promptly bear your servant’s memorial of true scriptural compositions upward to the *Taishang* court, presenting it in due order. Should any character be miswritten, let it be corrected; should any be omitted, let it be supplied. If words are transposed or disordered, they must be sought out and rectified, ensuring all accords with the highest standard, that no superior office may reject or reprimand. Let the demonic hosts of the Six Heavens and the stagnant *qi* of subordinate offices be severed and intercepted, the memorial distinguished and transmitted, and the report conveyed upward in timely fashion. Await the response in reverence.\n\nNext, rise and face north, striking the teeth nine times, and invoke:\n\nO Exalted Primordial Origin, Numinous Honored One of the Nine Heavens,\nSupreme Perfected of the Mysterious Beyond, Jade Pavilion of the Dao’s Depths,\nAs the Three and Five revolve their courses, the Seven Luminaries alter their dawn,\nThe Void Thearch reins in the reins, the Five Emperors ordain transcendence.\nThe Azure Palace gathers the verdant, the talismanic mandate issues from the Numinous Mountain.\nOn this day of primal felicity, the myriad perfected open their ranks.\nThe advanced disciples of the cyclical signs *jia* and *yi*,\nBound by karmic affinity from former lives,\nHave encountered the divine scriptures, the precious chapters of the August Sovereign.\nReverently, upon the Mystic Peak, they pledge alliance to the Nine Heavens,\nProclaiming below to the Five Emperors and the Twelve River Sources.\nBeseeching registration and receipt, they memorialize the exalted court,\nUniversally notifying the ten thousand numina.\nArrayed in ranks upon the imperial altar,\nThey marshal and guard the majestic rites, adhering to the standards of the Supreme Perfected.\nAwait the transmission of the dawn’s initiation.\n\nNext, the officials are dismissed. The *gongcao* messengers within your servant’s person, the generals and soldiers of the register, and the officials of the memorial’s presentation, having fulfilled their duties, return into your servant’s body. Those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right, securely abiding within the Nine Palaces and Six Treasuries, the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber, and the Twelve Passes and Mechanisms. They coil about the body and entwine the bones, traversing and safeguarding the hundred vessels. Should any overseer be charged with protecting your servant’s person, let the *gongcao* dispatch them in proper sequence, ensuring no error or confusion, until your servant summons them forth again, whereupon they shall act in accordance with precedent.\n\nSound the ritual drum three times, and swallow the *qi* thrice.\n\nNext, rise and bow twice, then replenish the incense burner as prescribed.\n\nWhen complete, the master and disciples exit through the Earth Gate. The next day, ascend the altar to perform the great alliance rites in proper sequence.\n\nAt dawn, declare the completion of the merit. If the disciples are numerous, alter the altar as before. Use six placards, placing them upon the five gates: one each at the eastern, southern, western, and northern gates according to their positions, and two placards—*wuji* and *jiutian*—at the central gate, affixed to its left and right.\n\nThe formula states: The Central Gate lies below the main gate at the *ji* position, as in spring at *chou*; the Gate of the Multitudinous Perfected lies above the main gate at the *meng* position, as in spring at *si*. The rest follow accordingly.\n\nIf the disciples are few, use the fasting altar, adhering to the standard *Huanglu* fast rites. Further adorn and purify the arrangements, ensuring all is meticulously prepared. All requisite items for ascending the altar are assembled. Sound the bell, and the Dharma Master with the disciples approach the altar.\n\nThe Three Masters and Five Guarantors, arrayed in ritual vestments, and the disciples, all in dark caps and yellow-brown robes, holding tablets, stand in solemn order. The offerings of incense and flowers, the chants and processions, all proceed according to ritual.\n\nFirst, lead the disciples in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the southeastern corner, facing west, and chanting without cease. Next, lead the master in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the northwestern corner.\n\nThe master withdraws thirty paces from the altar—or seven paces—and strikes the teeth thirty-two times, visualizing purple clouds veiling his crown. Envision the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors of a single altar or mountain, one hundred thousand each, come to welcome your servant’s person, vivid and distinct. Then invoke:\n\nAs the divine perfected set forth on their journey,\nThe myriad emperors are struck with awe.\nThe Jade Void’s mysterious guard, the celestial lodges overturn,\nThe officials of the Five Marchmounts all lend their numinous aid.\nSummoned by command, the armies of the ten directions are driven forth,\nLeading the hosts of heaven downward, all assemble at the imperial court.\nGrant that I may ascend as transcendent, penetrating the essence of the Dao,\nDiscerning the inauspicious, plumbing the depths of the obscure and hidden.\nAll that is directed or declared shall accord with the Jade Purity.\n\nWhen complete, proceed slowly to ascend the altar, entering through the northwestern Celestial Gate. Invoke as prescribed.\n\nAscend the central altar, circling left to face northwest, and bow nine times toward the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Having completed the obeisance, strike the teeth nine times and invoke:\n\nYour servant *jia* now transmits to disciple *mou jia* the precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens, up to the supreme jade taboo names. Having purified the fast and memorialized in advance, with *qi* and destiny conjoined in perfection, beseech the descent of the supervising perfected jade transcendent, the Attendant Gentleman of the Register, and the Marshal of Numinous Guardians to oversee the alliance text and all that is presented and entrusted, that it may be fully reported above.\n\nCircumambulate the altar to the left, returning to face southeast, and bow twice. Then invoke again:\n\nThe Most High Primordial Heavenly King, on this day of supreme vows at the Eighth Assembly, with the day auspicious and the hour pure, reverently at the Dark Altar—or called the Sacred Peak—we transmit the Dark Scripture of Alliance and Ascent, beseeching the descent of the Five Sacred Mountains of the Five Emperors to oversee this servant’s covenant oath, that swiftly the divine immortality be granted, to ride the flying chariot and ascend to the Imperial Dawn.\n\nHaving completed this, the Dharma Master leans forward, then commands the disciple to enter the Central Altar from the southeastern Earth Gate, facing northwest to bow nine times. When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the Earth Gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the Heavenly Gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice more, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south. The Master turns to face north, strikes the teeth thirty-six times, and recites the *\"Golden Perfection, Great Void Chapter\"* to subdue the myriad demons. Its words say:\n\nHeavenly demons surge through the void,\nMyriad spirits startle the divine court.\nAssuming forms in songs and chants,\nThey shift and enter the nameless.\nHow clamorous the chaotic *qi*,\nDefiling the Way as it arises on the path.\nWithin clouds they dwell in crimson palaces,\nThe Northern Emperor deploys his divine troops.\nThe drum resounds—he knows by nature,\nThe dark fate comes to summon them.\nThe Supreme Radiance reins the flying bridle,\nSwiftly driving to inspect the cloud encampments.\nUrging the Northern Emperor’s records,\nSeizing the names of the demon hordes.\nThe *huoluo* unfurls the celestial net,\nUnleashing might to cast the ringing bells.\nGolden Perfection aids the empty vastness,\nJade light illumines the eight darknesses.\nGolden Mystery guards the Upper Palace,\nDivine Tigers slay the celestial essences.\nSevering the *qi* of ten thousand evils,\nCountless billions all made level.\nUpholding the Nine Heavens’ trust,\nA single whistle commands all to yield.\nSummoning the Perfected to fathom the Three Caverns,\nWisdom’s recitation shines with clarity.\nThe Eight Paths gaze upon the Dark Text,\nSeven revolutions weave the Heavenly Scripture.\nMerging with the Imperial Unity’s truth,\nDelivering the seven generations of ancestors.\nEradicating the roots of the Five Sufferings,\nReturning souls to receive renewed glory.\nGolden light blazes in the silent chamber,\nDivine candles kindle of themselves.\nFragrant blossoms scatter through the Jade Universe,\nMisty *qi* pierces the Jade Capital.\nThe Emperor dispatches the lingering chariot,\nThe Three Origins descend in emerald carriages.\nSwiftly ascending through the Nine Mysteries,\nThey come to attend my Jade Emperor’s court.\n\nWhen finished, they circumambulate left, the disciple following the Master through the Heavenly Gate into the Inner Altar—or called entering through the Heavenly Gate. They circumambulate left. Three times they offer incense to the Five Directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, illuminating and covering his form as one. His body becomes golden, emerging from behind the lungs, his neck crowned with a halo like the sun’s image, shining brightly in the ten directions. Within his body, all is clearly seen, inside and out.\n\nThen he recites the invocation to the Guardian Spirits of Numinous Protection, saying:\n\nNine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star Great Spirit,\nShining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the Nine Gates,\nTurning like a candle’s yang-light, sweeping away filth and dispelling miasma.\nLuminous Youths, guard my chamber,\nSeizing demons and binding evil,\nAscending to face the Imperial Lord,\nUpholding the true Dao, the vermilion script and jade texts,\nThe talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens,\nSummoning dragons to relay the decrees,\nPacifying and securing all under heaven—\nThus may I attain flight as an immortal.\n\nSouthern Vermilion Heavens, Three Qi flowing with light,\nThe Flaming Star turning like a candle, illuminating the Great Yang,\nAbove dwell the Crimson Essences,\nLuminous Youths of numinous clarity,\nCommanding the hosts of fire,\nGuarding the Three Palaces,\nSlaying deviance and binding evil,\nSevering the demon kings.\nUpheld by the Northern Emperor,\nThe Eight Thrusts of Wind and Fire,\nInterlocking bells resplendent—\nShould any dare disobey,\nThe true Dao flows forth.\nI partake of supreme merit,\nPreserving heaven’s enduring existence,\nFor kalpas without end.\n\nSeven Qi of Heaven, the Great White streaming with essence,\nRadiance shining upon the Golden Gate, illuminating the Great Darkness.\nWithin dwells the White Sovereign,\nTitled the Imperial Spirit,\nPreserving and pacifying the divine,\nGuarding my bodily form,\nSevering the roots of deviance,\nThe kingly Dao resplendent in rectitude.\nPalaces and dwellings ordered,\nThe Three Luminaries aligned as one.\nThe Dao harmonizes with spontaneity—\nAscending to the Purple Court,\nThe talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure,\nUniversally benefiting the ten thousand beings.\nMerit extended to all,\nHeaven and earth at peace.\n\nNorthern Mysterious Heavens, Five Qi circling,\nThe Morning Star resplendent, shining upon the Supreme Subtlety.\nBlack Numinous Honored Spirits,\nFlying in dark feathered robes,\nGuarding the Five Gates,\nInspecting essences and seizing transgressions.\nShould any dare test me,\nThey shall be shattered by the Vast and Falling.\nAs the jade talismans proclaim,\nThe Eight Might of the Divine Perfected,\nThe gates of deviance sealed,\nThe true Dao brightly opened,\nIlluminating my body—\nThe Three Luminaries shine as one.\nSpurring the void, riding the floating,\nMy form ascends in immortal flight.\n\nYellow Center governing qi, unifying the Mysterious and True,\nThe Star of Stability emitting radiance, streaming and shining upon the Nine Heavens.\nTwelve Luminous Youths,\nPrimordial qi and yang essence,\nFlames ascending as vermilion smoke,\nTogether illuminating one chamber,\nAnd thus illuminating my body.\nA hundred evils cast down,\nTen thousand ghosts slain.\nThe divine incantation of Mount Zhong,\nUniversally enacted under heaven.\nThe Five Numinous Ones pacified and secured—\nMy body flies as an immortal on high.\n\nNext, strike the teeth twenty-four times.\n\nNext, recite the incense-burning invocation, saying:\nMost High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,\nSummon forth from my body the Three and Five Merit Officers,\nThe left and right attending messengers,\nThe left and right incense-bearing dragon-riding couriers,\nThe Jade Lads attending incense,\nThe Jade Maidens scattering flowers,\nThe Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers and Direct Day Incense Officers,\nEach thirty-six in number,\nTo emerge and report to the true officials and divine spirits of this land and domain.\n\nI now, at this moment, burn incense and transmit the teachings,\nMay the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend and infuse my body,\nThat my supplications swiftly reach the presence of the Utmost True and Boundless Dao.\n\nNext, the Master leads the disciple in circumambulating left, holding the petition tablet, facing west toward the east, and intoning the Heavenly Worthy of the East. Each direction is honored with three bows.\nAlternatively, one bow may suffice, or the tablet may be omitted, directly intoning the directions as they face.\n\nNext, the south; then the west; then the

ordered ranks.\nSpontaneous five-colored plain clouds illuminate and canopy their forms, streaming essence and dispersing qi, filling the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, encamping and guarding the minister’s body.\nOnce all solemn preparations are complete, the Orthodox Unity Ascending Mystery Merit Clerk, the Communicating Perfected Delivering Destiny Transmitting Affairs Flying Celestial Messenger, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman Direct Attendants, bearing the Mystery-Void’s tablet, stand before the minister, receiving the words from his mouth, distinguishing and transmitting them to the heavenly officials and earthly spirits of the upper and lower, central and four quarters, eight directions, the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, Nine Rivers and Eight Poles, famous mountains and great marshes, the Five Thearchs’ Perfected Officials, the Four Offices’ Inspectors, the Nine Divisions’ Examiners and Summoners, the Primordial Yuan Beginning Qi Jiazi Officials, the boundless, limitless, immeasurably high, deep, profound, and manifest, innumerable hosts of Perfected Officials infusing qi into the Celestial August One, the Nine Palaces’ Eight Trigrams’ Six Jia Perfected Persons, the Root Origin Primordial Earth Lords, the Altars and Granaries’ Generals and Clerks—all at once solemnly prepared, together with the minister’s body’s Merit Clerk Messengers, Flying Dragon and Post Dragon Riders, Direct Talismans and Direct Attendants—jointly ascend to address the August Presence of the Supreme Unsurpassed Yuan Beginning Most High Great Dao, the Five Venerables, the Perfected Great Sage Honored Divine Lords, and the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and Virtue’s Multitudes of Sage Heavenly Worthies, Supreme Thearchs, Heavenly Thearchs, and Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center.\n\nBy fortunate karmic affinity from past lives, through nine heavens’ kalpas extending to this present body, I have encountered the luminous destiny of this age, when the Great Dharma flows and spreads, allowing this defiled being to partake in the sacred texts of the Upper Clarity Golden Writ and Three Caverns’ Treasure Scriptures. Since presumptuously receiving them, I have revered and aspired to the supreme Dharma, my heart yearning for immortality, yet my sincerity remains shallow and weak, failing to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions, I dread sinking into the Nine Springs. Heaven’s compassion is vast, and my life has been preserved; I ought to guard my shortcomings and dare not speak further.\n\nNow, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the Dao, and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior deliverance and ascension have left celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy ones from the middle realm to fill the heavens. On the day I received the Dharma, I was to deliver others first; those whose names were predestined in the Golden Registers and Jade Records, the perfected ones, have traversed the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one whose destiny is predestined: the Perfected Person of Such-and-Such Marchmount, So-and-So, aged such-and-such years, whose embodied conduct is pure and true, whose bones and destiny align with perfection, and who has already received the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the supreme Dharma. Though his participation has been humble and narrow, he has not yet beheld the source of the Dao; his faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing. Now, bearing golden silks and Dharma tokens, he seeks to receive the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters of the True Text, the Golden Writ Purple Characters’ Jade Text Vermilion Seal Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Divisions’ Eight Effulgences’ Charts of Immortals’ Mounted Escorts, the Inner Sounds of the Heavens’ Spontaneous Jade Mighty Command Records of Eight Characters, and other sacred implements—divine staves, covenant texts, treasure scriptures—pledging his sincerity, making supplication, with his nine ancestors as witnesses, swearing to treasure them as his own body, vowing never to transgress.\n\nThe prohibitions of the Dharma I have received are weighty, and I dare not lightly proclaim them. After thorough verification, his words and sincerity grow ever firmer; examining his cinnabar heart, I deem him capable of accomplishment. Since the Dharma allows for deliverance, I dare not obstruct it. Accordingly, following the *Yellow Register’s Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortals’ Ordinances and Ranks*, I have fasted with him for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky, with heaven clear and earth still, the four qi tranquil, no wind stirring, no dust rising—meeting the Dharma and aligning with perfection. Now, reverently adhering to the ancient canons of my former masters, I transmit to So-and-So the essentials of the Illuminating Perfected Great Dharma and Jade Instructions, ascending the August Altar together.\n\nWith golden silks to secure the numinous, I first bow and present a scroll of yellow silk with a vermilion memorial, ascending to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection. Next, I read the memorial text aloud, then strike my teeth three times to dispatch it. I solemnly dispatch the Five Body Immortal Officials and their mounted escorts within my body, the repeatedly commanded Merit Clerk Messengers, the Memorializing Direct Talisman Transmitting Words and Writing Assistants, all solemnly attired in manifest vestments, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry the minister’s delivered Dao yellow silk vermilion memorial, ascending to the presence of the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Perfected Great Sage Honored Divine Lords.\n\nShould my words be inverted or erroneous, the texts mistaken or deviating from the ancient Dharma, I pray they be corrected and rectified according to the matter, ensuring they align above, without causing the overseeing celestial officials to reject or reprimand. If any demonic spirits, ghosts, or malevolent forces obstruct or intercept the public documents, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense. May what I have presented be conveyed above, and may my wishes surely reach fulfillment. Humbly awaiting your gracious consideration and response, I prostrate myself in anticipation of your decree.\n\nThen the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. The drum is sounded thirty-six times.\n\nThe Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Master, so-and-so the Master, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendant Immortals, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptures, the Supervisor of Ordination Sima, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—all bearing purple-feathered tablets and tenfold sacred banners, accompanied by ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers, descending together through the void.\n\nHeavenly ranks arrayed, they oversee the covenant of ordination. Your servant, relying on the assembled perfected immortals and flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Lord, the Supreme Pole Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Supreme Mystery Unity, and the host of honored ones in the Jade Tower below:\n\nYour servant, a fool of base flesh, has by past merit and destined meeting encountered the true scriptures and received the great Dharma of the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles profound—far beyond my capacity. Day and night I tremble in fear, body and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, kowtows again and again, acknowledging my mortal transgressions.\n\nPresumptuously overstepping my station, I dare to present these words. I reflect that the honored scriptures are sacred and weighty, their origins deep and fathomless—truly not something a humble servant may expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and regulations decree that transmission may only occur after fifty-eight hearings. My grasp of the Dharma is still shallow; I am unworthy to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end and the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate swiftly. The Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated, that they enter the Dharma gate.\n\nThough the hearts of people today are shallow and deceitful, truth and falsehood hard to discern, yet those who yearn with utmost sincerity—even faintly—may be recognized. Through earnest seeking and sincere devotion, none should be shut out. Having previously submitted a memorial for your celestial attention, I now respectfully report that the Perfected of such-and-such an Emperor, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unblemished. His aspirations are lofty, unconcerned with glory or splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the real, longing for immortality. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle of the Supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit. Diligent in alchemical toil, tireless in his devotion, he has drilled and striven for years, his resolve fixed on the source of the Dao.\n\nNow he presents gold, silk, and precious tokens—requisites for receiving the true teachings—and swears before the assembled spirits, with his nine generations of ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Red Writ of the True Text and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the Jade Scripts of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as I have observed.\n\nSo-and-so’s innate nature and conduct are fitting for accomplishment. Respectfully following the ancient statutes of the Illustrious Perfected, I have established an altar, formed a covenant, and sworn before the Nine Heavens. In accordance with the regulations, I now confer these upon him. Let them be treasured as his own body, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or carelessly profaned. To violate this would be to sever his roots and destroy his lineage, to harm the parents who gave him life, and to bring upon himself the trials of the wind-blade and the knife, with no reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nMay the Most High and the host of honored ones, the Ten Directions’ Sacred Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Emperors witness this covenant. Respectfully submitted for your celestial consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, bows twice with head reverently lowered.\n\nThen the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master. Three times they offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east, kneeling lengthily each time they approach a quarter. When the circuit is complete, they circumambulate three times and scatter flowers in the ten directions. At this time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns are chanted in turn. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected:**\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao\nRevealed the Numinous Treasure scriptures.\nSublime and wondrous, beyond compare—\nLike the mystery within the mystery.\nThe spontaneous, non-actional Dao,\nStudied, leads to lofty immortality.\nVast is the Cavernous Void scripture,\nSeated in peace, one may ascend the heavens.\nAbove, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace;\nBelow, it conceals itself in famous mountains.\nResplendent with dragon and phoenix script,\nIts radiance gleams in the spaceless.\nWondrous is the Most High’s Dao,\nNon-actional, ever spontaneous.\nKings, lords, and common folk—\nAll esteem only the loyal and worthy.\nThose with past-life blessings,\nOutstanding from former causes,\nReceive the Dharma Master’s transmission,\nThe precious trust for kalpas uncounted.\nBroadly mindful of delivering all,\nGreat fortune returns to your person.\nIn offering, one attains the Dao;\nIn practice, one becomes a perfected one.\nThe Great Dao has no self or other—\nTransmission must find the right person.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity First Perfected:**\nFrom the Cavern of All Wonders,\nResplendent, it illumines the Great Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies eternally enduring.\nCarefree, they sport in the mysterious void,\nPalaces arrayed in formlessness.\nLush are the seven-jeweled groves,\nRadiant as sun and moon’s essence.\nDragon scales intertwine in flight,\nPhoenixes soar with mournful cries.\nThe Most High governs the Purple Terrace,\nThe host of perfected chant the Cavern scriptures.\nBurning incense, they bow in reverence,\nCircumambulating the palace city.\nThree circuits return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nWhen the ruler embraces the supreme Dao,\nThe world enjoys universal peace.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Second Perfected:**\nEmptiness and constancy are spontaneous,\nForcibly named the Great Dao.\nBoundless and remote, without limit,\nAll wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.\nClosing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected;\nWith concentrated thought, the Ten Elders descend.\nAscending as immortals, forever non-actional,\nTheir numinous countenances ever wondrous.\nThirst quenched with jade pool nectar,\nHunger sated with golden radiance herbs.\nThrough stillness and wisdom, the eight perils are crossed,\nThe world’s myriad sufferings relieved.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Third Perfected:**\nWondrous are the Numinous Treasure scriptures,\nThe Most High’s spontaneous texts.\nThose who uphold them attain immortality,\nCalled the true Heavenly Honored Ones.\nCharged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,\nTruly they transcend the mundane.\nTheir work complete, they ascend as immortals,\nTheir palaces govern the Mystery Terrace.\nAt times they descend Mount Kunlun,\nCarefree, they rest on Penglai.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Rectified Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:**\nThe Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—\nThe king of the perfected Dao’s scriptures.\n\nShould there be the Five Thousand Characters,\nLofty and wondrous, peerless in the world.\nThose who uphold them ascend as flying immortals,\nTheir mysterious abodes governing the void.\nThey attend the Terrace of the Most High,\nCarefree, they dwell in the Purple Tenuity Palace.\nTen thousand kalpas pass like a flash of lightning,\nYet they endure eternally without end.\nThe Dao-eye now fully complete,\nTheir luminous clarity pierces the hidden depths.\nDark and obscure, nothing remains unknown—\nSeated in stillness, they observe the ten directions.\n\nWhen the recitation concludes, the Dharma Master and disciples return to their positions, facing south and north, unfolding the True Writ upon the altar. The Master recites the Preface to the True Writ, after which the disciples bow again. Then, following the Jade Instructions, they pronounce each character with correct intonation, explaining and transmitting them orally for reception.\n\nThe disciples receive the oral instructions and install the Eastern Treasure Floriate Grove’s Azure Numinous First Elder and the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Vermilion Writ.\n\n**Vermilion Writ of the Eastern Jade Chapter**\nThe Eastern Nine Qi,

Kalpa after kalpa, salvation and deliverance know no end, like the dust and sands of measureless eons without cease. The numinous writ, profound and recondite, is secreted within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the host of perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, it was bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure thus emerged to deliver humankind.\nI, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered this numinous writ. My former master, in manifest adornment, transmitted the supreme Dharma, which I vowed to treasure as my own body—how dare I presume to divulge it? Yet as kalpas turn and fortunes shift, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who harmonize with the real, I transmit it in accordance with the statutes.\nToday, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow it upon So-and-So. After receiving the scriptures, you must follow the luminous statutes: purify yourself, discipline your body, devote yourself with diligence and sincerity, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform reverent rites, study the wondrous and abstruse, inquire of those accomplished in the Dao, practice guiding and refining, observe purification fasts and wear ritual vestments, and seek to ascend in flight. Honor the Dao and revere your master, esteeming the root above all. You must not be insincere, all face and no heart, nor assail your own foundation, nor fabricate groundless faults. Do not slight the scriptural treasures, nor indulge in superficial admiration, nor wallow in lust and greed, nor harbor jealousy, anger, or resentment. Do not be deceitful in heart, nor nurse malice within. Should you violate these precepts even once, your body will fill the Three Springs.\nYou, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together sink into the earthly prisons, without reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.\nToday, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the precious writ of the Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures. All heavens and the Five Peaks stand witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, uphold the Dharma with care, and hold it fast in your heart. Flight as an immortal may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the perfection of the Dao. Discipline yourself earnestly, as prescribed in the statutes of the Four Poles.\"*\n\nNext, the disciple’s own covenant text:\n*\"Disciple So-and-So of the Cavern Mystery, from Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Hamlet, prostrates and bows twice, reverently addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Dao Lord, the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions, and the Perfected of the Four Quarters who have already attained the Dao.\nThe precious talismans of the Thirty-Six Sections of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s venerable scriptures, and the Great Cavern Master So-and-So, by karmic affinity and accumulated merit, through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, have revolved unceasingly. Blessed by fortune’s reach and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma gate. By former vows, I aspired to the loftiest lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit exultant, fearing only the decay of this fleshly frame.\nNow, as heavenly fortunes shift and the imperial Dao’s destiny unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted and enlightened by Master So-and-So, who has opened my ignorant mind and bestowed upon me the numinous writ, allowing me to serve before the sagely lord. My mortal body trembles with awe, having washed away defilement and filth, and now attending the numinous altar. I bow in gratitude for this elevation, a glory beyond my due.\nI vow to discipline myself and purify my body, to make offerings and revere the honored rites, to cast off worldly entanglements and retire to secluded heights, to forever forsake the paths of the world and dwell only among hills and crags. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble capacities, hoping to rely on the sagely writ to deliver this decaying frame. With utmost sincerity and single-minded devotion, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor be all face and no heart, nor fail to preserve the kalpas.\nI, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my voice, dare to speak thus, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this oath, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant.\nI delight in the immortal’s path and dare not be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons of the Five Paths, and may I never be pardoned.\nAbove, I proclaim to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Before the master’s treasure and my own body, I establish this covenant oath. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance.\nYour servant So-and-So, with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice.\"*\n\nNext, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true writ in his left hand.\nThe disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times and visualizes the colors of the five viscera, fully arrayed to form a canopy of precious clouds, covering the scriptures and the master.\nHe then recites:\n*\"The celestial writ’s simplicity is not burdensome,\nThe Dao and virtue are complete of themselves.\nCultivate them, and you shall surely become an immortal—\nWhat more could you desire?\nThe text shines in the Grand Interstice,\nResplendent and radiant.\nTransmit and receive it strictly by the Dharma;\nTo divulge or slight it is to fall into hell.\"*\n\nNext, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, and receives the true writ. Girding the sash and grasping the staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit.\nHe visualizes the Most High’s true form, like the Heavenly Worthy’s image.\nComplete, the master rises and paces in procession, chanting the *Step of Emptiness*:\n*\"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,\nBurning incense, I return to emptiness.\nLuminous radiance follows my turning,\nThe Dharma wheel likewise circles thrice.\"*\n\nThe mystic vow arises in the four directions,\nAuspicious blessings reach kings and lords.\nSeven

Garden,\nResplendent, the Seven Treasures’ Grove.\nThree hundred named celestial beasts,\nLions vast as ten thousand fathoms.\nFlying dragons pace and chant,\nDivine phoenixes sing in rhythm.\nA numinous wind fans wondrous blossoms,\nPure fragrance scatters upon my lapels.\nWithout transcendent talent, how could one indulge this heart?\nI adorn my nine-dragon chariot,\nMounting the void to roam carefree.\nThe eight heavens are like a hall at fingertip’s reach,\nThe six directions—how could they be distant?\nAll immortals recite the Cavernous Mystery,\nThe Most High sings a pure melody.\nFragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,\nJade tones form in the purple clouds.\nThe Five Sufferings all at once disperse,\nThe Eight Difficulties follow the scriptures’ emptiness.\nWondrous

the jasper bells.\nThe Ten Blossoms’ immortals assemble,\nPurple mists congeal into a palace.\nJeweled canopies array before the Most High,\nPerfected persons grasp lotuses.\nScattering blossoms, I declare my vow,\nGrasping the tally, I subdue demon kings.\nDharma drums summon the assembled immortals,\nNuminous chants resound in unison.\nNothing to be done, nothing not to be done,\nThoughts commune with the subtle and minute.\n\nThen, facing north, he recites three hymns of reverence. Their words say:\n\n*\"Delighting in the Dharma as my wife,\nCherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.\nUpholding precepts to restrain the six passions,\nMindful of the Dao, I dispel desires.\nSerene, the upright qi abides,\nThe numinous spirit, still and silent.\nHeavenly demons all revere and protect,\nLifetimes receive great blessings.\nFlourishing, the household and kingdom prosper,\nThriving, the scriptures and Dao arise.\nMay heaven and humankind fulfill their vows,\nEthereally entering the Great Vehicle.\nEstablishing a field of merit through intention,\nThe Dharma wheel ascends, vast and boundless.\nSeven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,\nMy body ascends at daylight.\nThe Great Dao pervades the cavernous void,\nWith mindfulness, nothing fails to align.\nRefining form to enter immortal truth,\nThus becoming a vajra body.\nTranscending the three realms’ difficulties,\nDissolving the Five Sufferings of hell.\nAll return to the Most High’s scriptures,\nIn stillness, I bow my head in homage.\"*\n\nAfter each recitation of a *Step of Emptiness* hymn, the disciple chants \"Excellent!\" and scatters blossoms, bows once, and completes the rite by chanting the Three Reverences:\n\n*\"With utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the Most High, Boundless Great Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the thirty-six revered scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow my head in homage to the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center.\"*\n\nThen, sitting evenly, the disciple prostrates before the master. The master recites the *Primordial Beginning’s Prohibitions and Precepts*, and the disciple responds with assent to each phrase, declaring his name: \"Disciple So-and-so.\" The master instructs, and the disciple responds three times with assent.\n\nThe *Primordial Beginning’s Red Writ of the Five Tablets* is the scripture of the Highest Clarity’s spontaneity, the numinous, cavernous chapters of the Nine Heavens’ inception, establishing heaven and earth, unfolding the myriad perfected, pacifying spirits and settling numina, engendering and completing the multitudes, rectifying and governing the cosmic rhythm, preserving heaven’s eternal endurance. Above, it regulates celestial mechanisms; at the center, it inspects the five numina; below, it reins the earthly deities. Whistling, it commands the river’s source, directs and employs yin and yang, summons spirits and dispatches immortals. This most perfected writ, wondrously responsive to spontaneity, causes heaven’s heights to clear, the earth to stand firm, the Five Peaks to secure their guardianship, and the ten thousand kinds to endure. The Primordial Beginning inscribed it in the Numinous Capital’s palace. Through countless kalpas, its text remains steadfast at heaven’s root, never decaying or sinking. With the cosmic rhythm, it shifts yet remains unstained; defiled, it grows ever purer; destroyed, it does not perish; extinguished, it shines most brightly. This writ of the Great Existence is revered by the heavenly perfected. Unless one’s name is recorded in the imperial register and inscribed on the tablets of future lives, this text remains hidden and secret, beyond the reach of prying eyes. Those who obtain it abide with the Three Qi eternally. Diligently practicing its methods, they attain immortality.\n\nOnly through wholehearted devotion and personal reverence shall household and state know peace, life be preserved, calamities averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away. When the Son of Heaven and feudal lords uphold it, the realm attains great tranquility, hostile invaders submit of themselves, borderlands cease their strife, the myriad people raise their voices in song, and all under heaven flourishes. As the cycles of destiny turn and the true Dao prevails, those who obtain it summon forth the natural, the heavenly perfected in their wondrous majesty—what the Nine Heavens guard in secrecy. It must not be lightly disclosed, lest judgment befall your person.\n\nShould a disciple be deemed worthy of transmission, though their years have not yet reached five times eight, let all ritual tokens be fully prepared. Following the Yellow Register, they shall take three masters and initiate nineteen disciples, their merit complete before the precious instructions may be passed. No transmission shall occur outside the proper lineage, nor shall it be privately taught.\n\nShould one violate these statutes, recklessly divulging without covenant, both master and recipient shall face the trials of the Four Poles, their seven generations consigned to the earthly prisons, never to be redeemed for ten thousand kalpas. Can you not be cautious? Can you not be cautious? Let this be your faith.\n\nHereupon, the disciple rises and bows three times, then prostrates again.\n\nNext, the Six Vows are conferred, saying:\nFirst vow: not to lightly disclose.\nSecond vow: not to treat with irreverence.\nThird vow: not to transmit recklessly.\nFourth vow: not to speak of it idly.\nFifth vow: not to violate the scriptural prohibitions.\nSixth vow: not to accept wealth in exchange for the Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s Six Vows bind the human heart; when the human heart is steadfast, the heart of the Dao is true. One must not break these vows or transgress the covenant, lest they endure the Wind Blade’s eternal torment.\n\nAs the vows are recited, the disciple first holds incense, one hand pointing to heaven—left for men, right for women.\n\nHereupon, the disciple bows six times. The master stands and intones:\nThe true Dao is lofty and wondrous, revealed only in response to sincere devotion. With a heart of red earnestness, moved by compassion for the Supreme Mystery, the Purple Text refines the essence, divine gold subdues demons. Radiant and majestic, its power grants immortality. Now I bestow it upon you—swear not to speak of it recklessly. Treasure and guard this descent of the true; to divulge it is to invite disaster. The heavenly statutes are stern—let this be your observance.\n\nHereupon, the disciple bows six times again.\n\nNext, the master formally confers the disciple’s rank, saying: *Tai Shang Lingbao Wushang Dongxuan Disciple, Master of Such-and-Such Peak, So-and-So.*\n\nThe disciple kneels to receive, then retreats, holding the tablet upright before them. They address their root master, bowing nine times, rising and prostrating thrice, advancing on elbows and knees.\n\nWhen finished, they move left to face east, bowing twice toward the west. Then they turn north, then east, then south, bowing twice in each direction, in homage to the Four Poles.\n\nReturning to their position, they bow three times to each of the Three Masters of Transmission. Then they again read the petitions to the Ten Directions and the Five Masters, facing each direction as before, save that the Five Masters are honored facing west.\n\nHereupon, they kneel in profound gratitude, the disciple kowtowing and striking their cheeks without count. Their words are:\n\nThe Disciples of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavern Mystery—this mountain’s master, your subjects [Name] and others—now burn incense and kowtow, entrusting body, spirit, and life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, to the Perfected Lords of the Ten Realms who have attained the Dao, to the Venerable Ones, to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Realm, to the Three Perfected of the Supreme Unity, to the High Mystery Dharma Masters of the Great Ultimate, to the Orthodox Unity Perfected of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, and to all divine spirits within and beyond the Three Realms.\n\nYour subjects, in transmitting the precepts to the disciple [Name] and conducting the altar’s oath-pledge, humbly beseech the grace of deliverance from the assembled Worthies above. We pray for absolution of all transgressions—from the time we first received form from our parents, through all karmic ties and kin, to the present—for the myriad sins and errors of your subjects and the disciple now receiving transmission. Since the establishment of this retreat until this day, we have violated precepts, broken laws, erred in conduct, failed in decorum, mispronounced sacred names, confused ranks and order, and deviated in the transmission of empowerment. We implore your great compassion to pardon and not hold us guilty.\n\nMay your mercy flow forth at once, your majesty manifest this day. Today, from the mouth of the Precious Pearl, countless beings ascend to its summit, joining the assembly of the exalted. Together they cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, surmount the Dragon Mountain and reach in unison, attaining the four fruits of realization. Thus may the five vows previously made be fulfilled in this moment.\n\nThe Pearl’s mouth knows no overflow, water and fire cannot burn or sink it. Today, men and women gaze in awe at the Phoenix Chariot, awaiting the Dragon Carriage from afar. All these wise companions, each the father of their father’s father, share in the One of the Mystic Unity. May the five eyes reward diligence, the three luminances bestow virtue. May merit race like joyous steeds, and blessings of ease and delight abound. May the tally of death be erased, the record of life flourish. May the hymns of the Primal Beginning endure forever, and the unending celebration of the Never-Ending resound.\n\nMay each be granted extended destiny and discerning form, protection for high and low, life for young and old. May men be steadfast in faith, women guarded by the Dharma. May women bear purple tablets, men inscribe jade registers. May their immortality rival the Red Lord’s, their attainment of the Dao vie with the Mountain Chart’s liberation. May the paths of misfortune vanish together, and the steps of blessing rise through compassion. May emperors reign long, loving their people and governing the realm. May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings widely received. May prisons and calamities be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May disasters and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.\n\nFor all other wishes, may each be fulfilled as sought: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Real attain the Real. May all aspirations be harmonized, all desires fulfilled. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit aid living beings. May it extend to all—the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens; the mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams; the Dragon Kings, Bird Kings, Beast Kings, and Insect Kings; the myriad spirit-kings of all things; all Heavenly Kings; the gods of heaven and earth in every place; the numinous spirits of mountains and waters; the officials and elders of villages and domains; and all guardian soldiers and officers. May they all turn in unison this instant, ascending together to the wondrous and sublime.\n\nMay the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of error. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers yield their dragon charts. May the five sacred herbs and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.\n\nMay boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor, and all who rejoice in this act—along with the men and women who observe and listen. May all with karmic affinity partake in supreme blessings, their dark debts repaid across the six paths, their joy bestowed upon the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed. May they don celestial robes and sashes, delight in freedom, and form good affinities forever. May they become companions in the Dharma, never regressing, with the attainment of the Dao as their destined goal.\n\nAs for the altar master who pledged himself, [Name], may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence. May divine perfected ones guard his life, heavenly texts inspire auspicious signs. May the eight assemblies align with the charts, the six perfections be constantly upheld, the four practices remain unbroken. May the five penetrations elevate him to immortality, the ten transformations enable his flight. May his body be adamantine and pure, his attainment of the sagely fruit resplendent. Bowing to the Ten Directions, may he abide eternally in the Three Treasures.\n\nNext, the master recites the verses on the three destinies and five sufferings:\n\nThe Three Powers and the myriad things,\nDependent and latent, each has its span.\nEnd and beginning await the kalpa’s reckoning,\nWhen blessings are exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.\n\nBack and forth through the five paths,\nHow bitter to die and be reborn again!\nTurning within the three destinies,\nComing and going with calamity.\n\nGreat worthies, heed this warning,\nRestrain your nature, sever your passions.\nFoolish ones do not believe the Dharma,\nTheir sins and pains ever cling to them.\n\nI grieve that the world knows no end,\nSo I now proclaim this clearly:\nIf you wish to escape these afflictions,\nTake refuge in the Supreme Scriptures.\n\nSin and blessing do not come from another—\nTruly, they arise from your own voice.\nGreat worthies, therefore, seal your lips,\nTo sever all evil ties.\n\nExtinguish thoughts, attain perfect stillness,\nDependent and latent, await their final dissolution.\nSpreading the Dao to pacify the world,\nYou will ultimately behold the True.\n\nLust and jealousy are the roots of misfortune,\nThe greatest perils to body and life.\nNurturing such harms,\nHow can the Dao find peace?\n\nKnowing evil yet not reforming,\nYou will surely meet an early end.\nHarboring poison while feigning purity,\nYou make me sigh deeply.\n\nKarma from past lives is real,\nYet the weak call it nonexistent.\nAll desire to see it before their eyes,\nDismissing what passes as false.\n\nGreat worthies, enlightened by the Dao’s teachings,\nGrieve for the stubborn.\nTenderly I think of your suffering,\nDiligently I cause you concern.\n\nLife is consumed like fire in oil,\nThe four great elements but a temporary abode,\nThe five aggregates a provisional loan.\nIn your prime, study earnestly,\nSeek to preserve what is yours.\n\nWhen blessings are exhausted, body and spirit scatter,\nIn the dark depths of hell below.\nThe sages above fear this,\nSo they seek the Dao to escape this calamity.\n\nTo learn immortality is urgent,\nUphold the precepts, restrain the heart.\nLet emptiness and purity dwell in the upright qi,\nAnd immortals and sages will naturally come.\n\nIf you do not believe these words,\nWhy dwell in the mountains?\nGreat worthies, delight in the scriptures and precepts,\nReceive them as treasures for your body.\n\nTo study is always bitterly late,\nTo cultivate the body, regrettably not sooner.\n\nWhen I now unravel these profound mysteries,\nIn a flash, years have aged me.\nClutching the scroll, I exhaust your essence—\nSoon death will bring only grief and torment.\n\nThus in my youth I forsook the world to study the Dao.\nNext, the Dharma Master turned eastward,\nSpoke of merits, and resumed his office.\n\nTai Xuan Du Zheng Yi Ping Qi, Celestial Master of Yangping District, Left Minister of Ping Qi, your subject [Name], bows twice and respectfully declares:\n\nAccording to the documents, your subject is but a mortal of flesh and blood, yet by fortune’s grace was born into the Dharma gate. By the boundless favor of the Great Sage, I have been graciously granted the inner and outer essentials of the wondrous Dharma—the Dao of immortality and deliverance from death. I humbly ascend the *Three Caverns’* treasure scriptures of *Shangqing*, guarded by the radiance of clouds, blessed by profound and unmatched grace.\n\nThe weight of the Dao is heavy; mortals are light. Such burden is not for this humble frame to bear. To fail the celestial offices would be to forfeit my very head.\n\nToday, upon this mountain ridge, I transmit the precious scriptures of ordination to my disciple [Name]. From the midst of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the celestial steeds of immortals emerge—Divine Envoys of Flying Heaven, messengers who convey petitions and memorials. I invoke the registering officials of the Five Emperors, the local deities of the Five Peaks, the true lords of sacred mountains and domains, to oversee the bestowal of qi, to witness and protect this rite.\n\nAll is by the merit of the assembled officials’ protection. Overwhelmed by such grace, I reverently offer this memorial of merit and petition for all to hear.\n\nMay the exalted officials deign to take pity and review this plea, absolving all my past and present transgressions, countless as they are. Grant that my body be delivered from the thousand calamities and ten thousand perils, that I may serve as an attendant jade youth or maiden of the scriptures, as an inner or outer inspector of summons, as a lord of the Four Quarters and Nine Wilds, as a true official of the sacred mountains and domains, as a minister of the Five Emperors and Five Peaks. May my body’s Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the Flying Celestial Envoys, the celestial steeds of the heavenly offices, the guardians of the ten directions, and all officials—past and present, encountered along the way—who have aided in transmission, proclamation, and transformation, see their heartfelt vows fulfilled. May their merits be reported to the heavenly courts, their ranks advanced, their offices elevated, their merits recognized and promotions granted.\n\nFor great merit: three thousand grades.\nFor middling merit: two thousand grades.\nFor lesser merit: one thousand grades.\nFor scribes and minor clerks, soldiers and attendants: five hundred grades each.\nMay all return to the Central Palace.\nMay the exalted officials distribute rewards in due time, ensuring fairness and leaving none aggrieved or resentful.\n\nOnce the merit is recorded, may each return to their post, safeguarding my body, warding off the thousand poisons, public and private slander, the schemes of evil men, and all that lurks hidden in the Great Yin.\n\nUnworthy of such boundless grace, I offer this in token of my devotion.\n\nHumbly beseeching the Most High to distinguish and pity this foolish subject, I respectfully dispatch, through the true envoys of the inner and outer assemblies, the *Zheng Yi* Merit Envoys, the left and right official messengers, the yin-yang divine decree clerks, the chariot officers of the red talismans, the couriers of the fierce winds, the mounted memorial officers, and the flying dragon cavalry—twelve each—to present this memorial of merit and petition, one copy, to the Three Heavenly Courts, awaiting their decree.\n\nYour subject [Name], trembling with awe, bows twice and respectfully submits this.\n\nYour subject’s surname belongs to [Prefecture], [County], [Abbey].\n*Taiqing* holds the rank.\nIn the year of the *Tai Sui*.\n\nYour subject, having completed the covenant rites, now invokes the celestial and terrestrial deities. As they return to the Nine Heavens, may they ascend in due order. The *Yu Xu* True Qi Merit Envoys within this subject’s body, along with the divine transcendents’ mounts, shall proceed in their customary ranks, entering through the wondrous gate and golden portal of the Purple Mansion’s Jade Pavilion. They shall encircle the body, entwining the hundred meridians and bone joints, inwardly filling them with immortal *qi*, outwardly sealing off all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that this subject may soon attain flight and transcendence. The transcendents’ feathered mounts shall ascend directly to the Imperial Throne.\n\nSwallow the twenty-four *qi* and pause.\n\nNext, the Dharma Master returns to the incense burner and prays:\n\n\"Fragrant Official Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, azure mushrooms, and jade blossoms. May the hundred numinous transcendents gather here before this incense altar, that this subject may attain the Dao and swiftly achieve transcendence. May disciples [Names] and their households, both within and without, receive blessings. May the ten directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens, guarding the fragrant smoke, convey this subject’s supplications directly to the Jade Emperor’s throne.\"\n\nNext, recite the *Precepts Hymn*:\n\nThe Dao is the heartless source,\nAll acts become fields of merit.\nOne cessation—no fixed measure,\nEach vow arises from the self.\nEmpty the self to respond to beings,\nFocus the mind without partiality.\nGreat sages exalt the true teaching,\nAs rain descends from heaven.\nLofty and boundless in reach,\nYet humble, thus forming the abyss.\nThe sea is king of all rivers,\nFor it can forsake even dragon scales.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures—\nNot merely for one’s years.\nUphold the precepts without lapse,\nLifetimes of good karma bound.\nWith concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,\nAnd you shall embody the Dao’s truth.\n\nRecite the *Returning Precepts Hymn*:\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,\nExpounds the precepts to deliver beings.\nMajestic virtue pervades the hidden and manifest,\nKarmic retribution moves the true numina.\nAll heavens bow in reverence,\nAll demons restrain their forms.\nThe past transcends the eight difficulties,\nThe present preserves a thousand years.\nWhen the merit of the fast is complete,\nTogether we send forth our devotion.\nThe drifting *brahmā* chant soars on clouds,\nIncense and fragrant smoke intermingle.\nJade phoenixes ride cinnabar carriages,\nGolden dragons draw emerald chariots.\nIn life and death, all find joy,\nFamilies and nations all know peace.\n\nWhen finished, master and disciples circumambulate the altar, chanting *brahmā* hymns, and conclude the rites.\n\nAlternatively, the master may return to the incense burner and perform the *Ascending Heaven and Treading Earth* rites upon the august altar. Then, master and disciples chant *brahmā* hymns as they exit through the northwest gate of the Nine Heavens—without looking back.\n\nThe *Treading Earth* talisman for dissolving form is inscribed in blue on white silk. The *Ascending Heaven* talisman for concealment is inscribed in yellow on green silk.\n\nSome masters say: Before declaring merit, perform the rites in full. Then lead the disciples to face north and bow four times toward the Supreme Jade Throne of the Most High. Next, face east and bow twice to the Great Emperor Lord. Then face south and bow twice to the Highest Perfected. Next, face west and bow twice to Heavenly Master Zhang. After three days, the disciples may declare their merit, hold a fast to give thanks, and follow the separate scroll for the rites.\n\nNext, the disciples perform the *Tally Tablet* rite in the direction of their natal destiny at the altar. Facing east, they knock their teeth three times, offer incense, and pray:\n\n\"Most High Lord Lao, Primordial Three Qi of the Three Heavens, summon forth from this subject’s body the Three and Five Merit Envoys, Left and Right Official Messengers, Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens Attending the Incense, Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and Direct-Day Fragrant Officials—thirty-six each. Open and notify the local earth deities and the true officials and divine spirits of the four directions. As this subject now burns incense and makes this notification, may the true *qi* of the Ten Directions’ Perfected enter this body, that this petition may ascend directly to the throne of the Most High, Perfect, and Greatly Sagely Divine Lord and Jade Emperor.\"\n\nWhen finished, turn to face the king and knock the teeth twelve times. After reading the tally, pray:\n\n\"Heaven unfolds, earth extends,\nNine *qi* divide the numinous.\nThree Origins share the tally,\nTen Directions’ Mystic Purity.\nFive Elder Thearchs,\nOpen the true and lead the living.\nCinnabar script and vermilion writ,\nPrimordial essence of the Highest Origin—\nUniversally proclaim to the Supreme,\nNine Lands’ August Spirits.\nToday is supremely auspicious,\nMyriad transcendents fix their destiny.\nI vow my transcendence,\nPlead to inscribe my jade name.\nEarth Mansion’s Great August,\nErase my sinful form.\nPresent the tally to the Upper Palace,\nInscribe it in the Azure Register.\nSwiftly attain flight and ascension,\nHeaven and earth share the numinous.\nNine generations of kin,\nRotten bones renewed in glory.\nSouls ascend to the Southern Palace,\nTransformed in the Transcendents’ Court.\nToday I declare my mandate,\nAll spirits heed my words.\nWith golden seals I affirm\nMy utmost sincerity.\nAs I have declared, so let it be—\nGolden dragons speed the courier’s way.\"\n\nWhen finished, offer incense and return to the incense burner, following the above method.\n\nThe *Primordial Numinous Treasure* addresses the Nine Earths’ Earth Augusts, erasing sins and inscribing names to seek transcendence.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure* and *Red Thearch* Master, female Daoist [Name], aged [X] years, born in the [X] month, destiny linked to the Southern Dipper’s register under the Nine Heavens.\n\nExplanation: This text refers to the *Red Thearch* as one born in the *bing-wu* year, and \"destiny linked to the Nine Heavens\" as one born in the first or second month. The *Southern Dipper* governs the direction of one’s natal destiny; the rest follows this pattern.\n\nVowing to become a transcendent, to attain long life and deliverance from the world, to soar to the Upper Clarity, the Nine Lands’ Central August, the *wu-ji* Yellow Spirits, and the Five Thearchs of the Earth Mansion—beg to erase the record of sins, inscribe it in the Great Mystery, and present the tally to the Central Palace. The golden seal serves as proof, and golden dragons speed the transmission.\n\nIn the year of the *Tai Sui* [X], the [X] month, the [X] day, this document is declared in [Prefecture], [Subprefecture], [County], [Village].\n\nInscribe in vermilion on a silver tally, wrap it in blue paper, and bind it with nine blue silk knots and one golden dragon. Bury it in the central palace of the dwelling.\n\nNext, present the spirit tablet, inscribe the tablet, and bury it in the corresponding direction of the altar. Alternatively, cast it into mountain caves, deep springs, or abysses—let no one retrieve it.\n\nEach tally is one foot two inches long, two inches four *fen* wide, and three *fen* thick.\n\nThe ritual offerings for ascending the altar are as follows:\n\nTwenty-four thousand cash (or equivalent in bronze coins or treasures).\nNine taels of gold.\nOne bolt each of five-colored silk.\n\nFive large mats.\nFive sets of compounded incense, each set comprising two *dou* and five *sheng*.\nFive incense burners.\nA seven-chaptered table.\nOne crimson-patterned cloth.\nOne five-*chi* double-layered azure-patterned cloth.\nOne five-*chi* double-layered cloth with five-colored scattered floral patterns, one *dou* in quantity.\nLife-destiny silk, its length matching the recipient’s age in *chi*.\n\nFor those born in the first or second month: their register belongs to the Azure Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Nine-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the fourth or fifth month: their register belongs to the Cinnabar Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Three-*Qi* Lords.\nFor those born in the seventh or eighth month: their register belongs to the White Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Seven-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the tenth or eleventh month: their register belongs to the Black Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Five-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month: their register belongs to the Yellow Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the One-*Qi* Heavenly Lord.\n\nAccording to the month of the ordination rite:\nIn the first or second month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the fourth or fifth month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the seventh or eighth month, state: “Now in the Seven-*Qi*.”\nIn the tenth or eleventh month, state: “Now in the Five-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month, state: “Now in the One-*Qi* Heaven.”\n\nThe *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Rite of Ordination* concludes.\n\nThe *Taishang Dongxuan Lingbao Rite of Ordination* states in the *Huanglu Jianwen Lingxian Section*:\nThose who receive scriptures and methods must ordain nineteen disciples for the Three Masters, establishing merit and virtue so their names are recorded in the heavens. Only then may they ascend the altar to pledge alliance and receive the Five Elders’ Red Writ of the True Script in Jade Chapters, the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, and the celestial steeds and offices of the Upper Perfected.\nThose who fail to establish merit yet recklessly receive the Great Law will be seized by the Three Offices, facing bitter retribution in life and death, and examined by the Court of Illuminating the Law.\n\nThe *Mingzhen Code* states:\nThe pledge requires twenty-four thousand cash to secure the twenty-four *qi* life-officials.\nIf this solemn pledge is lacking, the gods of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries will not register the person’s destiny.\nIf gold cash is unavailable, bronze may be used as substitute.\nIf entirely lacking, the case is referred to the General Divine Bureau.\n\nThe *Mingzhen Code* states:\nFive taels of refined gold are used to pledge the Five Marchmounts as a token of the precious scriptures.\nThe *Jade Decisions* states:\nNine taels of refined gold are offered to swear an oath to the Nine Heavens; deficiency incurs the penalty of disrespecting the scriptures.\nThe Five Marchmounts and sacred mountains will not register the learner’s name, and the case is referred to the Dark Bureau.\n\nThe *Mingzhen Code* states:\nForty *chi* of five-directional patterned silk are used to invoke the Five Thearchs as a token of the pledge.\nIf lacking, the Five Thearchs will not accept the person’s name, and the Five Thearch Demon-Kings will disrupt them, causing their resolve and thoughts to falter. The case is referred to the Water Bureau’s Springs and Bends Court.\n\nThe *Mingzhen Code* states:\nThree gold dragons and three gold knots are cast into mountains, waters, or earth as a token of immortal study.\nIf not cast, the Three Offices will seize the person’s destiny register, and their prayers will not reach the heavens.\nViolations are referred to the Nine Capitals Bureau.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nTear five *chi* of Southern Harmony Elixir silk—crimson-patterned silk—to make a cloth for the altar table, upon which the *Five Chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Writ* and the Five Talismans are invoked.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nCut five *chi* of Azure Grove silk—blue-patterned silk—to make a cloth to cover the True Writ and talismans.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nPlace the True Writ and Five Talismans between the blue and crimson silks, forming a covenant of tonsure and blood-oath. The blue silk substitutes for hair, the crimson for the blood-oath; thus the perfected ones avoid harming their spirit and depleting their virtue.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nFive blended incenses—though the scripture does not specify the quantity, two *dou* and five *sheng* are customarily sufficient. Additionally, prepare one *dou* of five-colored mixed flowers, to be scattered in the ten directions during the perfected one’s ordination. Five large mats, a seven-patterned altar table, five incense burners with lidded boxes, and a lifespan silk matching the initiate’s age in *chi*.\n\nThe eight items above are used for the altar rites as tokens of the pledge.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nIn spring, use *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, *dingsi* and *bingwu*; during the four seasons, *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou*; in autumn, *gengshen* and *xinyou*; in winter, *guihai* and *renzi*. Ascend the altar on the day of the establishing sovereign.\n\nThe *Jade Key* states:\nConstruct a high altar on a sacred peak, with railings on four sides. Open five gates at the east, west, south, north, and center, each marked with a placard bearing the following inscriptions:\n\n**Nine Qi Azure Heaven, Peaceful Treasure Florescence Grove, Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Lord; Azure Thearch Lord; Nine Qi Azure Molar Heavenly Lord; Supreme Perfected Jade Azure Waist Jade Maiden; Eastern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**\n*Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate.*\nInscribed in blue on red ground, placed above the eastern gate.\n\n**Three Qi Cinnabar Heaven, Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang, Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder Lord; Vermilion Thearch Lord; Vermilion Three Qi Heavenly Lord; Primordial Qi Elder; Vermilion Palace Supreme Cinnabar Jade Maiden; Southern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**\n*Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance Gate.*\nInscribed in red on yellow ground, placed above the southern gate.\n\n**Primordial Cavern Supreme Thearch, Heavenly Jade Treasure Primordial Numinous Elder Lord; Supreme Thearch Perfected One; Purple Cinnabar Yellow Court *Wu-Ji* Heaven Azure Jade Maiden; Central Yellow Great Thearch Official Lord.**\n*Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*\nInscribed in yellow on white ground, placed above the central gate.\n\n**Seven Qi White Heaven, Seven Treasures Golden Gate, Luminous Numinous August Elder Lord; White Thearch Lord; Bright Stone Seven Qi Grand Master; Supreme White Plain Jade Maiden; Western Quarter Spirits and Officials.**\n*Passage Yin Golden Watchtower Gate.*\nInscribed in white on black ground, placed above the western gate.\n\n**Five Qi Mysterious Heaven, Cavern Yin Northern Solitude, Profound Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Lord; Black Thearch Lord; Mysterious Nourishment Five Qi Heavenly Lord; Supreme Numinous Lord; Night Radiance Jade Maiden; Northern Quarter Spirits and Officials.**\n*Yin Birth Vast Numinous Gate.*\nInscribed in black on blue ground, placed above the northern gate.\n\n**Nine Heavens’ Multitudes of Spirits, Perfected Ones of the Five Marchmounts and Sacred Mountains, Spirits and Officials of the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus of the Rivers and Four Seas, Earth Immortals, Jade Maidens, Flying Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, and all Divine Immortal Lords.**\n*Primordial Yellow Lofty Dawn Gate.*\nInscribed in purple on yellow ground, placed to the left of the central gate.\n\nTo the right, six placards are affixed above the five gates, with one placard each positioned at the eastern, western, southern, and northern gates according to their respective directions. Above the central gate, the symbols for *wu* and *ji* are displayed, while the two placards of the Nine Heavens are placed to the left and right of the gate. Five incense burners are arranged within the altar. Beneath the five tables, five-colored silken banners corresponding to the five directions are laid out. Additionally, a separate table is set at the center of the altar to receive the *True Writs* and the *Five Talismans Scripture*. Another table is prepared for submitting memorials and conducting rituals, making a total of seven tables. Gold and coin offerings are arrayed before the ritual table.\n\nThe *Yellow Register Simplified Writs* states: Those who receive the teachings must adhere to the luminous statutes, present their credentials to the master, and observe a seven-day fast. They shall submit a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the heavens for the sacred texts. The altar is exposed to the open air for one night; if no wind stirs the *qi* and the writs remain unshaken, the candidate’s bone name is deemed fitting, and the transmission proceeds after the oath. If the wind disturbs the writs, the candidate must retreat and fast for three more days, then repeat the procedure as before. Should the wind disrupt the ritual three times, and the candidate lacks a celestial name or meritorious deeds, the Three Realms will not record them, the Five Thearchs will not protect them, their bone and *qi* will be deemed unfit, and the teachings shall not be lightly transmitted. This is examined and verified by the Bureau of Rectification.\n\nThe great oath of the *Numinous Treasure* requires the sacred writs to be exposed overnight. The sequence for presenting the memorial and invoking the officials is as follows:\n\nOnce the altar is established at the sacred mountain site, the master and disciple enter through the earthly portal, circling left. The master enters the inner altar’s royal gate, facing north to offer three pinches of incense. First, the two registers of the disciple’s received *True Writs* are placed upon the table. The disciple proceeds to the outer altar, faces south, turns north, and bows three times, prostrating to present the memorial. The master sounds the celestial drum thirty-six times. Next, the incense burner is kindled according to ritual, and the officials are invoked.\n\nWith reverence, the five visceral true officials and functionaries within this servant’s body are summoned forth; the flying immortals of the Three Caverns within this servant emerge—eleven each of the *Yin-Yang* Functionaries of the Upper Three Heavens, Enforcers of the Dao, Transformers of Civilization, Dispensers of the Way, Dissolvers of Disasters, Dispersers of Calamities, and Resolvers of Adversities. The high perfected officials governing this servant’s body, the *Great General of Established Authority and Surveillance of Merit* under the charge of so-and-so, the *Vanguard Effectors of Merit* and *Rearguard Effectors of Execution*, the *Commandant* and *Vice-Commandant of the Courier Court*, the *Fourfold Inspectors of Merit and Envoys*, the *Immortals and Numinous Direct Envoys* within this servant’s body, the *Orthodox Unity Functionaries*, the *Healing Functionaries*, the *Left and Right Palace Envoys*, the *Yin-Yang Spirit-Decision Officers*, the *Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers*, the *Sturdy Wind Courier Post Riders*, and the *Memorial-Presenting Officers*—two each—emerge.\n\nThose who emerge don their solemn regalia and ceremonial robes, caps and pendants, arraying their majestic presence. The *Direct Envoy Functionaries* wear the *Crown of Penetrating Heaven*, clad in black, holding unlined garments. The *Orthodox Unity Functionaries* don the *Crimson Yang Turbans* and vermilion unlined robes. The *Envoys* wear the *Nine-Virtue Caps* and five-colored *Longevity Unlined Robes*, girded with tiger-seal belts, left side bearing *Flowing Gold Fire Bells*, right side bearing the *Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse*, all grasping jade tablets.\n\nThe *Direct Envoy Functionaries* stand at the center; the *Healing Functionaries* guard and protect this servant’s body. The *Left Palace Envoys* hold banners at the fore; the *Right Palace Envoys* raise standards at the rear. The *Yang Spirit-Decision Officers* stand to the left; the *Yin Spirit-Decision Officers* stand to the right. The *Upper Functionaries* gaze afar toward the heavens; the *Middle Functionaries* survey the eight directions; the *Qi-Urging Functionaries* hasten the ten quarters; the *General Palace Envoys* encircle this servant’s body.\n\nThe *Tiger-Rushing Officials*, the *Inspectors of Treachery and Hook-Riding Generals*, the *Commanders of the Palace Servants*, the *Celestial Armored Soldiers*, the *Celestial Ding Warriors*, the *Qi-Gathering and Qi-Consuming Officers*, the *Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Consuming Officers*, the *Ghost-Gathering and Ghost-Consuming Officers*, the *Essence-Gathering and Essence-Consuming Officers*, the *Toxin-Gathering and Toxin-Consuming Officers*, the *Evil-Gathering and Evil-Consuming Officers*, the *Talisman-Executing and Shrine-Destroying Officers*, the *Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers*, the *Sturdy Wind Courier Post Riders*, the *Memorial-Presenting Officers*, and the *Flying Dragon Riders* take their stations before and behind this servant and retinue.\n\nOnce the *Left and Right Functionary Envoys* have completed their solemn preparations, they array the regalia and insignia, summoning the officials of the *Numinous Treasure*, the *Perfected Kings Overseeing the Retreat*, the *Attendants of the Canonical Scriptures*, the *Marshal Guardians of the Numinous*, the various lords, officials, generals, and functionaries of the Three Caverns, the twenty-four *Zhi* established by the Heavenly Master below, the thirty-six *Jing* hermitages, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains including Kunlun, and the over thirty-six thousand upper officials of the heavens. The sun, moon, and stellar lodges; the *Xuanji* and *Yuheng* constellations; the Five Thearchs of Heaven and Earth; the officials, lords, generals, and functionaries of the Three Realms; the *Two Mysteries*, *Three Origins*, *Four Beginnings*, and the *Qi*-infusing officials of the four directions, orientations, winds, and cyclical signs; the summoned *Nine Yi Hu Elders of the East*, the *Eight Man Yue Elders of the South*, the *Six Rong Shi Elders of the West*, the *Five Di Qiang Elders of the North*, the *Three Qin Cang Elders of the Center*; the lords of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, hills, and marshes; the lords of all shrines, the *Meng* elders of high mountains and low valleys, forests and groves; the *Twelve Stream Women*; the original landlords of roots and sources; the generals and functionaries of the altars of soil and grain—all at once don their solemn regalia, joining the functionary envoys and *Flying Dragon Riders* within this servant’s body to ascend and address the *Supreme Venerable of the Mysterious Origin*, the *Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*, the *Supreme Elder*, the *Unsurpassed Mysterious Elder*, the *Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions and Boundless Great Dao*, the *Virtuous and Perfect Great Thearchs*, the *Heavenly Thearchs*, the *Heavenly Masters*, the *Female Masters*, the *Three Masters*, the *Lords and Ladies*, their attendants handling the twelve documents, those who process memorials and manage affairs—this servant humbly entrusts to them the *Numinous Treasure Great Rites*, the *Numinous True Writs*, the *Two Registers of the Eight Effulgences’ Inner Sounds*, and the *Yellow Plain Memorial*—one set placed upon the jade table, respectfully submitted for perusal.\n\nThe summoning of the officials is complete. Next, the memorial is read aloud.\n\nNext, the solemn reaffirmation of the charge.\n\nThe true officials of the five constituents within this servant’s body, each with their minor clerks and the twelve document handlers, shall don their ceremonial attire—crowns, sashes, and pendent tassels—and promptly present this servant’s memorial of the revealed and true scriptural texts, ascending to the Supreme Lord’s court to submit and respond according to the matter at hand. Should any character be miswritten, let it be corrected; should any be omitted, let it be supplied. If words are inverted or disordered, pursue and rectify them, ensuring all conforms to the highest standard, so that no superior office may reprove or reject it. Let the host of demons of the Six Heavens and the residual qi of subordinate offices sever and intercept the official documents no longer; let them distinguish and transmit the memorials in due course, that they may ascend and be reported in time. Then, rise and face north, strike the teeth nine times, and invoke:\n\nO Most High Primordial Origin, Spiritually Venerable of the Nine Heavens,\nSupreme Perfected of the Mysterious Beyond, whose Dao abides in the jade pavilion,\nAs the Three and Five revolve and the Seven Luminaries alter the dawn,\nThe Void Sovereign reins in the chariot, the Five Thearchs ordain transcendence.\nThe Azure Palace gathers the verdant, the talismanic mandate issues from the numinous mountain.\nOn this day of primal auspiciousness, the myriad perfected open the array.\nThe initiates of ranks Jia and Yi, bound by karmic conditions of former lives,\nHave encountered the divine scriptures, the precious chapters of the Supreme Thearch.\nReverently, upon the Mysterious Peak, they pledge alliance with the Nine Heavens,\nProclaiming below to the Five Thearchs and the twelve river sources,\nBeseeching registration and receipt, to memorialize the exalted court above,\nUniversally announcing to the ten thousand spirits, arraying the ranks upon the imperial altar.\nLet the guard and defense of the majestic ritual proceed as ordained by the Supreme Perfected.\nThe transmission shall await the dawn’s report.\n\nNext, the officials are dismissed.\nThe *Merit Clerk Messengers* within this servant’s body, the *Register’s Generals and Clerks*, and the *Officials for Memorializing Above*—having fulfilled their duties—shall return into this servant’s body, those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right, securely abiding within the nine palaces and six repositories, the golden hall and jade chamber, the twelve mechanisms of the passes, coiling about the body and winding through the bones, safeguarding the hundred meridians. Should any overseer be charged with protecting this servant’s body, let the *Merit Clerks* sequentially inspect and verify, allowing no errors or omissions, until this servant summons them forth again, whereupon they shall act as before.\n\nSound the ritual drum three times, swallow the qi three times.\nThen rise, bow twice, and replenish the incense burner according to the proper method.\nWhen complete, the master and disciples exit through the earthly portal.\n\nThe next day, ascend the altar to proclaim the great alliance in due order.\nAt dawn, declare the completion of the merit. If the disciples are numerous, rearrange the altar as before.\nUse six placards, placing them upon the five gates: one each at the eastern, southern, western, and northern gates according to their positions; at the royal gate, affix the *Wu-Ji* and *Nine Heavens* placards to the left and right of the gate.\nThe formula states: The central gate lies below the main gate at the *Ji* position—like *Chou* in spring; the gate of the assembled perfected lies above the main gate at the *Meng* position—like *Si* in spring. The rest follow accordingly.\nIf the disciples are few, use the fasting altar, adhering to the standard method of the *Yellow Register* fast.\nFurther adorn and purify the arrangement, ensuring all is meticulously prepared.\nAll requisite items for ascending the altar shall be fully assembled. Sound the bell, and the Dharma Master with the disciples approach the altar.\nThe *Three Masters* and *Five Guarantors*, clad in solemn ritual vestments, and the disciples, all in dark caps and yellow-brown robes, holding tablets and maintaining reverent order, with incense, flowers, and invocations, shall proceed entirely according to the proper method.\n\nFirst, lead the disciples in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the southeastern corner, facing west, and chanting the invocations without cease.\nNext, lead the master in circumambulating the altar three times, halting at the northwestern corner.\nThe master withdraws thirty paces from the altar—or seven paces—then strikes the teeth thirty-two times, visualizing purple clouds veiling the crown.\nFor one altar or one mountain, the divine soldiers of the Five Thearchs, each one hundred thousand strong, come to receive this servant’s body, vivid and distinct.\nThen invoke:\n\nAs the divine perfected set forth on their journey,\nThe myriad thearchs are startled,\nThe jade void’s mysterious guard,\nThe celestial lodges overturn.\nThe officials of the Five Peaks, none fail to lend their numinous aid.\nCommanding the ten directions, driving the celestial soldiers,\nLeading them from heaven below, all assemble at the imperial court,\nThat I may ascend to transcendence, penetrating the essence of the Dao.\nDiscerning what is inauspicious, plumbing the obscure and profound,\nAll that is directed and declared shall wholly accord with the Jade Purity.\n\nWhen finished, ascend the altar slowly, entering through the northwestern celestial gate. Invoke according to the proper method.\nAscend to the central altar, circling left to face northwest, and bow nine times toward the Lord of the Nine Heavens. Having completed the obeisance, strike the teeth nine times and invoke:\n\nThis servant [Name] now transmits to disciple [Name] the precious scriptures of the Nine Heavens, the supreme jade taboo names. Having purified the fast and submitted the nocturnal memorial, with qi and destiny harmonized with the true, beseech the *Jade Perfected of the Lower Realm*, the *Attendant Gentleman of Records*, and the *Marshal of Numinous Guardians* to descend and oversee the alliance documents, as well as all that has been initiated and entrusted, that it may all ascend and be heard above.\n\nCircumambulate the altar to the left, returning to face southeast, and bow twice.\nThen proclaim:\n\nThe Most High Primordial Heavenly King, on this day we present the eightfold vows at the auspicious hour, reverently at the Dark Altar—or Mount of the Sacred Peak. We transmit the *Alliance Scripture of the Dark Mystery*, beseeching the Five Divine Mountains of the Emperors to descend and oversee this servant’s oath, that we may swiftly be granted immortality, ascend on flying chariots, and rise to the Imperial Dawn.\n\nHaving completed this, the Dharma Master leans forward, then commands the disciple to enter the central altar through the southeastern earthly gate, facing northwest to bow nine times. When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the earthly gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the heavenly gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south. The Master turns to face north, strikes the teeth thirty-six times, and recites the *Golden Perfected Vast Emptiness Chapter* to subdue the myriad demons. Its words are:\n\nHeavenly demons surge through the void,\nMyriad spirits startle the divine court.\nAssuming forms in songs and chants,\nThey shift and enter the nameless.\nHow clamorous their chaotic qi,\nDefiling the Way as they arise along the path.\nWithin the clouds they dwell in crimson palaces,\nWhile the Northern Emperor deploys his divine troops.\nThe drum’s resonance knows its own course,\nThe Dark Mandate comes to summon them.\nThe Upper Radiance reins the flying steeds,\nSwift chariots inspect the cloud encampments.\nHastening the Northern Emperor’s records,\nThey seize and bind the names of the demon hordes.\nThe *Huoluo* unfurls the celestial nets,\nUnleashing might and casting the ringing bells.\nThe Golden Perfected aids the hollow vastness,\nJade light illumines the eight darknesses.\nThe Golden Mystery guards the Upper Palace,\nDivine tigers slay the celestial essences.\nSevering the qi of the ten thousand perils,\nAll countless billions are pacified as one.\nUpholding the Nine Heavens’ trust,\nTheir whistled commands leave none unbowed.\nSummoning the Perfected to fathom the Three Caverns,\nWisdom’s recitation shines with clarity.\nThe Eight Paths gaze upon the Dark Text,\nSeven revolutions weave the Heavenly Scripture.\nMerging with the Imperial Unity of the One True,\nDelivering the seven generations of ancestors.\nEradicating the roots of the five sufferings,\nReturning souls to receive renewed glory.\nGolden light blazes in the chamber of stillness,\nDivine candles kindle of themselves.\nFragrant blossoms scatter through the Jade Universe,\nMisty qi penetrates the Jade Capital.\nThe Emperor dispatches his lingering chariot,\nThe Three Origins descend in green carriages.\nSwift steeds soar through the Nine Mysteries,\nAttending our court in the Jade Emperor’s palace.\n\nWhen finished, they circumambulate left, the disciple following the Master through the heavenly gate into the inner altar—or entering through the heavenly gate. They circumambulate left, then offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, their radiance covering him as one. His body becomes golden, emerging from behind the lungs, his neck crowned with a halo like the sun, illuminating the ten directions. Within his body, all is clearly seen, both inside and out.\n\nThen he recites the invocation to the Guardian Spirit of Numinous Might:\n\nNine Qi of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star Great Spirit,\nShining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the nine gates,\nTurning like a candle’s yang-light, sweeping away filth and banishing miasma.\nLuminous Youth, guard my chariot,\nSeizing demons and binding evil, ascending to face the Imperial Lord,\nUpholding the true Dao, the vermilion script and jade texts,\nThe talismanic commands of the Nine Heavens, borne by dragon couriers,\nPacifying and securing all under heaven—\nThus I attain flight as an immortal.\n\nSouth: Cinnabar Heaven of Three Qi, streaming with light,\nThe gleaming star turns like a candle, illuminating the Great Yang.\nAbove dwells the Crimson Essence, Luminous Youth of Spirit,\nCommanding the hosts of fire, guarding the Three Palaces,\nSevering evil and binding demons, shearing away demon kings.\nEmpowered by the Northern Emperor, the Eight Thrusts of Wind and Fire,\nInterlocking bells blaze in radiance.\nShould any dare disobey, the true Dao flows forth—\nI partake of supreme merit, preserving heaven’s enduring existence,\nFor kalpas unending.\n\nHeaven of Seven Qi, where Venus streams with essence,\nIts light illumines the Golden Gate, brightening the Great Darkness.\nWithin dwells the White Sovereign, named Imperial Spirit,\nPreserving and pacifying the numinous, guarding my form,\nCutting off the roots of evil, the kingly Dao shines forth in rectitude.\nPalaces and dwellings stand ordered, the Three Luminaries aligned as one.\nThe Dao harmonizes with spontaneity—\nI ascend in flight to the Purple Court,\nBy the talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure, universally benefiting all beings.\nMerit extends to all, heaven and earth attain tranquility.\n\nNorth: Mysterious Heaven of Five Qi, circling in procession,\nThe Morning Star blazes resplendent, its light illumining the Supreme Subtlety.\nBlack Numinous Honored Spirit, clad in flying dark feathers,\nGuards the five gates, inspecting essences and seizing transgressors.\nShould any dare challenge, the Vast and Falling Blade severs and shatters.\nBy the jade talisman’s decree, the Eight Might of the Divine,\nThe gates of evil are sealed, the true Dao shines forth in clarity,\nIlluminating my body, the Three Lights gleam as one.\nI spur the void and ride the floating clouds, my form ascending in immortal flight.\n\nYellow Center governs qi, unifying the mysterious and true,\nSaturn emits its radiance, streaming and blazing through the Nine Heavens.\nTwelve Luminous Youths, primordial qi and yang essence,\nFlames rise in crimson smoke, together illuminating this chamber and my body.\nA hundred evils are shattered, ten thousand ghosts slain.\nThe divine incantation of Mount Zhong spreads universally—\nThe Five Numinous Ones pacify and secure, my body ascends as an immortal.\n\nNext, strike the teeth twenty-four times.\n\nNext, kindle the incense burner and recite the invocation:\nMost High Three Heavens, Primordial Origin, Three Qi, Supreme Venerable Lord Lao,\nSummon forth from my body the Three and Five Merit Officials, the left and right attendants,\nThe left and right incense-bearing dragon couriers, the Jade Lads who tend incense,\nThe Jade Maidens who scatter flowers, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman and Direct Day Incense Officials—\nEach thirty-six in number—\nTo emerge and report to the local earth deities and territorial spirits of this place.\nI now, in this moment, burn incense and transmit the teachings,\nPraying that the life-breath of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend and infuse my body,\nThat my supplications swiftly ascend, directly presented before the True and Boundless Dao.\n\nNext, the Master leads the disciple in circumambulating left, holding the petition tablet, facing west toward the east, and intoning the Heavenly Worthy of the East—each direction receiving three bows.\nAlternatively, one bow may suffice, or the tablet may be omitted, simply intoning the directions in sequence.\n\nNext, the South; then the West; then the North; then the Northeast; then the Southeast; then the Southwest; then the Northwest; then the Upper Realm; then the Lower Realm—each performed in the same manner.\n\nWe, with utmost sincerity, submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the East,\nThe Azure Emperor, Lord of the Nine Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the eastern quarter.\n[Disciple’s name and lineage] reverently presents this petition.\nThe same for all ten directions.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the South,\nThe Flaming Emperor, Lord of the Three Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the southern quarter.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the West,\nThe White Emperor, Lord of the Seven Qi of Heaven, and all

Northeast,\nThe Lord of the Primordial Azure Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the northeastern quarter.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast,\nThe Lord of the Primordial Cinnabar Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the southeastern quarter.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest,\nThe Lord of the Primordial White Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the southwestern quarter.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest,\nThe Lord of the Primordial Mysterious Qi of Heaven, and all the spirit officials of the northwestern quarter.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm at the Heavenly Gate,\nThe Celestial Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis, the Golden Watchtower of the Seven Treasures, the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Supreme Palace of the Thirty-Two Heavens,\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Flying Brahma and Great Brahma Heavens, the Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens, and all the spirit officials of the upper realm.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we submit ourselves to the Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm at the Earthly Gate,\nThe August Sovereign of the Nine Lands, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Yin-Yang Water Bureau and Twelve Immortal Officials,\nThe Heavenly Worthies of the Thirty-Six Earthly Primes of the Cavernous Abyss, Cavernous Void, and Cavernous Origin,\nAnd all the spirit officials of the earthly realm.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I, your servant, now follow the covenants of the Supreme Perfected and the precepts of the fast,\nAscending the altar, preparing the implements.\nAt the appointed hour yesterday, I presented the memorial to the numinous worthies,\nAwaiting with sincere devotion in the jasper pavilion, the assembled spirits taking their places.\nThus the rains have ceased on this auspicious day, the winds stilled in this clear hour,\nExtending through the Ten Heavens, the Three Qi streaming with light,\nMajestic forms spreading like clouds, the supreme rites unfolding.\nI, [disciple’s name], am profoundly fortunate, having aroused the causes most difficult to fulfill,\nPresumptuously hoping for fruits most difficult to attain.\nDiligently following the Dharma, I transmit the talismans from beginning to end,\nPraying to avoid wind and rain, that after receiving them, I may proceed without hindrance.\n\nEach kowtows and strikes the cheeks.\n\nNext, with utmost sincerity, the Dharma Master takes his position, facing east, while the disciple returns to face east, prostrating westward on the ground.\nThe Dharma Master kneels lengthily and again strikes the teeth twenty-four times.\n\nSummoning the officials:\nWith utmost sincerity, I summon forth the true officials of the five organs within my body,\nAnd the twenty-four Flying Heavenly Immortal Officials of the Three Caverns, Eight Effulgences, and Eight Palaces of the Numinous Treasure and Cavernous Mystery—\nEach twenty-four in number—to emerge.\n\nFrom the Three Caverns and Eight Effulgences of the Cavernous Heavens emerge the Flying

officials, troops, and cavalry assemble and station themselves before, behind, to the left, and to the right of your servant, arrayed in orderly ranks. Naturally arising five-colored plain clouds illuminate and shroud their forms, streaming essence and dispersing *qi* to fill the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, encamping and guarding your servant’s body.\n\nOnce all preparations are complete, the Orthodox Unity Ascending Mystery Merit Officers, the Communicating Perfected and Conveying Destiny Flying Celestial Messengers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Officers, bearing the Tablet of Mysterious Emptiness, stand before your servant. They receive the words from your servant’s mouth, distinguishing and transmitting them to the heavenly officials and earthly spirits of the upper and lower realms, the central and four directions, the eight quarters, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, the Nine Rivers, the Eight Poles, the famous mountains and great marshes, the true officials of the Five Thearchs, the Four Departments of Surveillance, the Nine Bureaus of Examination and Summoning, the various officials of the Primordial *Qi* of the Mysterious Origin and the *Jiǎzǐ* Calendar, the boundless, infinite, immeasurable, unfathomable, hidden, and manifest hosts of true officials who infuse *qi* into the Celestial Sovereign of *Qián*, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams and Six *Jiǎ* Deities, the lords of the root origin and fundamental beginning of the land, and the generals and officers of the altars and boundaries—all of whom now prepare in solemn array. Together with your servant’s merit officers and messengers, the Flying Dragon and Posting Dragon Cavalry, and the direct talismans and direct officers, they ascend to report before the August Jade Presence of the Supreme Primordial Origin, the Most High Great Dao, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao, the Hosts of Sages and Heavenly Worthies, the Celestial Thearchs, the Great Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearchs, and the various officials of the Great Masters of the Mysterious Center.\n\nBy good fortune, through karmic conditions of past lives and the kalpas of the Nine Heavens extending to this present incarnation, your servant has encountered the luminous destiny of this era, when the great Dharma flows freely, and has been permitted, despite this defiled form, to partake in the sacred texts of the Upper Clarity Golden Writ and the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. Since presumptuously receiving these teachings, your servant has revered the supreme Dharma, yearning in heart for the immortals, yet with shallow sincerity and feeble devotion, unable to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions and the descent into the Nine Springs, yet through the vast compassion of heaven, your servant’s life has been preserved. It is only fitting to guard these humble capacities and dare not speak further.\n\nNow, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the cosmic wheel and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior ranks of those who have been delivered and ascended leave celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy candidates from the middle realm to fill the heavens. From the day your servant received the Dharma, it was ordained to deliver others. Those with predestined names inscribed in the golden registers and jade records, who are destined to attain perfection, traverse the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one with a predestined mandate, the Perfected of a certain Marchmount, so-and-so, of such-and-such age, whose conduct is pure and whose bones and destiny align with perfection, having already received the sacred texts of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ. Though their understanding remains shallow and narrow, never having glimpsed the source of the Dao, their faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing.\n\nToday, they present offerings of golden silks and Dharma tokens, seeking to receive the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ of the Jade Chapters, the Golden Writ and Purple Characters of the Jade Texts and Vermilion Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Caverns and Eight Effulgences’ Charts of the Divine Immortals’ Mounts, the Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens’ Natural Jade Whip Records of Eight Characters, the divine staffs, and all other matters, the covenant-bound precious scriptures. They pledge their sincerity, making their supplication with the Nine Ancestors as witnesses, vowing to treasure these teachings as their own body and soul, binding themselves to no transgressions or violations.\n\nYour servant, bound by the weight of the Dharma’s prohibitions, dare not lightly disclose these teachings. After thorough verification, their words prove ever more steadfast, and upon examining their sincere heart, it is deemed they may achieve success. Since the Dharma provides for deliverance, your servant dare not obstruct or sever this path. Accordingly, following the *Huanglu Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortal Regulations and Ranks*, your servant has fasted with them for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky. Heaven is clear, earth is still, the four *qi* are tranquil, with no wind or dust—all in accord with the Dharma and attuned to perfection.\n\nNow, respectfully adhering to the ancient canons of former masters, the essentials of the Illuminating Perfection Great Dharma and Jade Instructions are transmitted to so-and-so’s person, ascending together to the imperial altar. With golden silks to secure the numinous, your servant first reverently presents a scroll of yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection and consideration. Next, the memorial is read aloud, and after three rounds of tooth-clicking, it is dispatched.\n\nYour servant now dispatches the five bodily perfected immortals and their mounts, the repeatedly commanded merit officers and messengers, the reporting direct talismans and transmitting scribes, all in solemn attire, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry your servant’s Dharma-conveying yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the presence of the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs and the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords. Should any words be inverted or erroneous, or the texts deviate from the ancient Dharma, may they be corrected in accordance with the matter at hand, ensuring perfect alignment above, so that the officials and scribes of the upper realms suffer no reprimand. Should any demonic spirits, malevolent ghosts, or thieves intercept or obstruct the memorial, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense.\n\nMay your servant’s memorial reach its destination above, and may all wishes be fulfilled. Humbly awaiting the gracious response, your servant prostrates in anticipation of the report.\n\nThen the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. Thirty-six strikes of the drum are sounded. The Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Dharma Master, so-and-so, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendants of the Supreme Ultimate, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptural Bureau, the Inspector-Marshal of Ordination, the Four Directors and Five Thearchs, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, who grasp purple-feathered tablets and tenfold numinous banners, leading ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before them and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers as they descend together through the void. Heavenly ranks arrayed, they witness the ordination and the sworn covenant.\n\nYour servant, relying upon the perfected immortals and transcendent officials, the flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneously Arisen Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Thearch, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity, and the host of venerable ones beneath the Jade Towers of the Clear Mystery: your servant, base and foolish, a walking corpse of foul flesh, by accumulated fortune and karmic convergence, has encountered the true scriptures and been granted the honor of receiving the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles subtle—far beyond what I can bear. Day and night I tremble in fear, my form and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, kowtows again and again, prostrate with mortal transgression, prostrate with mortal transgression.\n\nYour servant, unworthy and presumptuous, dares to offer these words. Reverently examining the august scriptures, so profound and weighty, their traces deep and their sources abstruse, they are truly not something a humble servant may presume to expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and canonical regulations decree that transmission may only occur after five or eight hearings. Your servant has but newly received the Dharma and is unfit to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end, the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate, and the Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated into the Dharma gate. Though the hearts of people today are shallow and false, truth and deceit difficult to discern, still those who sincerely aspire—though their merit be slight—may be recognized. If they diligently seek and their sincerity reaches, they must not be shut out.\n\nYour servant, having previously presented a memorial above, now respectfully reports that the Perfected of such-and-such an Imperial Realm, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unsullied, his aspirations lofty, disdaining glory and splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the true, yearning for immortality and revering the divine. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle’s supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit, devoutly enduring hardship, tirelessly striving, drilling and toiling for years on end, his resolve fixed upon the source of the Dao. Now he presents golden silks and precious tokens, the requisites for receiving the true, swearing before the assembled ministers with his nine ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Origin Five Venerable Thearchs’ Vermilion Script of True Writs and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as your servant has witnessed.\n\nSo-and-so’s bone nature and resolve are fitting for accomplishment. Reverently following the ancient canons of the Luminous Perfected, a ritual arena is established, covenants are sworn before the Nine Heavens, and the transmission is conferred in accordance with the statutes. Let it be treasured as his personal jewel, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or treated with negligence, lest he sever his roots and destroy his lineage, his parents in life and death, and his own person, suffering the trials of the wind-blade and enduring ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. May the Most High Host of Venerables, the Ten Directions’ Sage Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Thearchs clearly witness this sworn covenant. Respectfully submitted for your august consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, bows twice with head reverently lowered.\n\nThen the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master, offering incense thrice to the Five Directions, beginning in the east. At each direction, he kneels lengthily to present the incense. When the circuit is complete, he paces three times around the altar and scatters flowers in the ten directions. At that time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns of praise are chanted in full. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.\n\nThe Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One:\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao\nRevealed the Numinous Treasure Scriptures.\nSublime and wondrous, beyond compare,\nLike the mystery within mystery.\nThe spontaneous, non-actional Dao—\nThose who study it ascend as high immortals.\nVast is the Cavernous Void Scripture,\nSeated in peace, they attend the heavens.\nAbove, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace,\nBelow, it conceals the famed mountains.\nResplendent with dragon and phoenix patterns,\nIts radiance gleams in the spaceless.\nWondrous is the Most High Dao,\nNon-action, ever spontaneous.\nKings, lords, and common folk—\nAll esteem only the loyal and worthy.\nThose with karmic fortune from past lives,\nOutstanding from former causes,\nMasters transmit it in succession,\nPrecious tokens through kalpas of years.\nBroadly mindful of delivering all,\nGreat fortune repays your person.\nThose who make offerings will attain the Dao,\nThose who uphold it become perfected immortals.\nThe Great Dao has no self or other—\nTransmission must find its proper recipient.\n\nThe Hymn of the First Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nFrom the Cavern Perfected emerge all wonders,\nResplendent, illuminating the Great Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies eternally enduring.\nCarefree, they sport in the mysterious void,\nPalaces arrayed beyond form.\nLush and radiant, the Seven Treasures Grove,\nLuminous as the sun and moon’s essence.\nDragon scales intertwine in flight,\nPhoenixes soar with mournful cries.\nThe Most High governs the Purple Terrace,\nThe host of perfected chant the Cavern Scripture.\nBurning incense, they bow in reverence,\nCircling the palace city.\nThree circuits return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nShould the lord of men magnify the supreme Dao,\nThe world will be universally at peace.\n\nThe Hymn of the Second Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nEmptiness and constancy, ever spontaneous,\nForcibly named the Great Dao.\nVast and boundless, without limit,\nAll wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.\nClosing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected,\nWith concentrated thought, the Ten Venerables descend.\nAscending as immortals, forever non-active,\nTheir numinous countenances eternally wondrous.\nThirst quenched with jade pool nectar,\nHunger sated with golden radiance herbs.\nSerene wisdom transcends the eight difficulties,\nDelivering the world from all suffering and affliction.\n\nThe Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nWondrous are the Numinous Treasure Scriptures,\nThe Most High’s spontaneous texts.\nThose who uphold them attain immortality,\nCalled the true Heavenly Honored Ones.\nCharged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,\nTruly they surpass worldly talent.\nTheir tasks complete, they ascend as divine immortals,\nTheir palaces govern the Mysterious Terrace.\nAt times they descend Mount Kunlun,\nCarefree, they rest on Penglai.\n\nThe Hymn of the Most High Orthodox Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:\nThe Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—\nThe supreme king of the true Dao scriptures.\n\nShould one possess the five thousand characters,\nLofty and wondrous, peerless in the world,\nTheir practice establishes ascent to immortality,\nDwelling in mystery, they govern the void.\nThey attend and guard the Terrace of the Most High,\nCarefree, they wander the Purple Tenuity Palace.\nTen thousand kalpas pass like a flash of lightning,\nYet they endure, ever without end.\nThe Dao-eye now fully complete,\nVast and unobstructed, they commune with the unseen.\nThe obscure and dim hold no secrets,\nSeated in stillness, they observe the ten directions.\n\nWhen the recitation concludes, the Dharma Master’s disciples each return to their positions, facing north and south, and unfold the true script upon the altar. The Master recites the preface to the true script, after which the disciples bow again. Then, following the jade instructions, they articulate the correct pronunciation, explaining each character and transmitting the oral transmission for recitation.\n\nThe disciples receive the oral instructions:\nIn the East, establish the Treasure Florescence Grove of the Azure Numinous Beginning Elder and the Nine Qi Azure Heaven’s Red Script.\n\n**Red Script Jade Chapter of the East**\nThe

Next, after inserting the talisman, he seals both hollow ends of the staff with red wax, impressing the upper end with the seal of the Primordial Beginning and the lower with the seals of the Five Elders. Done, the disciple strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the five *Direct Talisman Officials of the Emperors*, each clad in robes matching their directional hue, their five-colored radiance streaming and blazing upon the staff; and the five *Jade Maidens of the Emperors*, one for each, together guarding the staff on left and right. The disciple then holds the staff horizontally as before. The master invokes:\n\n\"Mountain of the Great Yang,\nPrimordial Essence on high,\nopening heaven and unfurling earth,\nsweet bamboo channeling the numinous.\nDirect Talisman Guardians,\nmarshaling divine soldiers,\nfive hues streaming and blazing,\ncrimson fire and golden bells,\nassisting the perfected on high,\nemerging from darkness and entering shadow.\nSummoning the heavens, the heavens bow,\ncommanding the earth, the earth welcomes.\nPointing at ghosts, ghosts perish,\ndemons of heresy bound in form.\nNuminous talisman, divine staff,\ncommanding all spirits with awe,\ngoverning all directions,\nliving with me as one.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas,\nreplacing my form,\nits splendor the Five Liberations,\nspirit ascending to the Upper Clarity.\nReceiving the talisman and proclaiming the decree,\nnone dare disobey.\"\n\nDone, he draws the *qi* of the five directions and swallows it twenty-five times, then ceases.\n\nNext, the master proclaims the *Cinnabar Water Text*:\n\n\"Great Cavern Master of Such-and-Such Peak, your servant So-and-So, addresses his disciples So-and-So and others: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the vast and boundless, unfolded and expounded the true scriptures, weaving them into wondrous sutras. Kalpa after kalpa, salvation knows no end, like grains of sand or countless billions without cease. The numinous scriptures, profound and recondite, were hidden within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the assembled perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, they were bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and thus the *Numinous Treasure Wondrous Sutra* emerged to deliver humanity.\n\nI, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered these numinous scriptures. My late master, in manifesting their splendor, transmitted this supreme Dharma, which I vow to treasure as my own body—how dare I divulge it recklessly? Yet as kalpas turn and destiny shifts, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who align with the true, I transmit it according to the rites.\n\nToday, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow these scriptures upon So-and-So. After receiving them, you must adhere to the luminous precepts: purify yourself, discipline your body, cultivate sincerity and diligence, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform rites, study the profound mysteries, seek guidance from the enlightened, practice *daoyin* and refine your essence. Observe fasts, regulate your attire, and yearn for transcendence. Honor the Dao and revere your master, upholding the root with devotion. Do not feign reverence with hollow words, nor attack the very foundation of your being with reckless deeds. Do not slight the sacred scriptures, nor indulge in superficial piety, lust, greed, jealousy, or hatred. Do not harbor deceit in your heart or conceal malice within. Should you violate these vows even once, your body will sink into the Three Springs.\n\nYou, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together descend into the earthly prisons, lost for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Today, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the *Ten Sections of Treasured Scriptures* and the wondrous sutras. All heavens and the Five Peaks bear witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, guard the Dharma, and hold it within your heart. Ascension to immortality may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the true Dao. Strive with solemnity, as prescribed in the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*.\"\n\nNext, the disciple proclaims his own covenant:\n\n\"Disciple So-and-So of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Peak, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Venerable Deities of the Ten Directions, and the perfected who have attained the true Dao in all quarters.\n\nThe thirty-six sacred scriptures and talismans of the *Most High Numinous Treasure*, the supreme Dharma of the Great Master of the Lofty Mystery So-and-So, by karmic fortune and past blessings, have endured through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, unceasing and undying. Blessed by destiny and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma’s gate. From an early age, I vowed to admire the supreme lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit leaping with joy, dreading only the decay of this mortal frame.\n\nNow, as heavenly destiny shifts and the imperial Dao’s number unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted by Master So-and-So, who enlightened my ignorance and bestowed upon me the numinous scriptures, allowing me to stand before the sagely lord. My flesh trembles with awe; I have cleansed my filth and impurities to attend the numinous altar, humbly receiving this exalted favor, a glory beyond my due.\n\nI vow to discipline myself, purify my body, make offerings and pay reverence, cast aside worldly burdens, and entrust my aspirations to the hidden peaks. Forever forsaking the paths of the world, I dedicate myself solely to the mountains and cliffs. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble devotion, hoping that through the sacred scriptures, my decaying frame may be delivered. With utmost sincerity and single-mindedness, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor feign devotion with hollow words, nor fail to uphold the kalpas’ trust.\n\nI, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my shame, now dare to speak, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this vow, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant. I delight in the immortal’s path and shall never be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons and the Five Paths, without hope of reprieve.\n\nAbove, I appeal to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Facing the master’s treasure, I establish this covenant. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance.\"\n\nThe disciple, prostrate, bows twice with reverence.\n\nNext, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true scriptures in his left hand. The disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the five viscera, complete and perfectly forming a canopy of cloudlike brocade, covering the scriptures and himself. He then invokes:\n\n\"Celestial writ, unburdened and free,\nthe Dao and its power self-sufficient.\nCultivate it, and immortality is certain—\nwhat more could one desire?\nIts radiance shines in the Great Void,\nbrilliant and resplendent.\nTransmit and receive all according to the Dharma;\nleak or slight it, and fall into hell.\"\n\nNext, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, then receives the true scriptures. Girding his sash and grasping his staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit. He visualizes the Most High’s true form, resembling the Heavenly Worthy’s image.\n\nDone, the master rises and paces in a circuit, chanting the *Step of the Void*:\n\n\"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,\nburning incense to return to the Void.\nLuminous radiance follows me in turn,\nthe Dharma’s wheel likewise circles thrice.\"\n\nThe profound vow stirs the Four Great Ones,\nblessings reach

Their words are:\n\nDelighting in the Dharma as one’s wife,\ncherishing the scriptures like pearls and jade.\nUpholding precepts to restrain the six passions,\nmindful of the Dao, I dispel desires.\nSerene and pure, the upright qi abides,\nthe numinous spirit stills in silence.\nHeavenly demons all revere and protect,\nlifetimes receive great blessings.\nLush and flourishing, the household and kingdom prosper,\nsolemn and majestic, the scriptures and Dao thrive.\nMay the wishes of heaven and humankind be fulfilled,\nfloating and distant, entering the Great Vehicle.\nEstablishing the field of blessings through the heart,\nthe Dharma wheel ascends in boundless ascent.\nSeven generations ascend to heaven’s halls,\nmy body ascends in broad daylight.\nThe Great Dao pervades the Cavernous Void,\nwith thought, nothing fails to accord.\nRefining the form to enter immortal truth,\nthus becoming a Vajra body.\nSurpassing the Three Realms’ difficulties,\nthe Five Sufferings of hell are dissolved.\nAll return to the Most High’s scriptures,\nin stillness, I bow my head in reverence.\n\nAfter each recitation of the *Step of the Void*,\nthe disciple chants \"Excellent!\" and scatters blossoms,\ncompleting one bow, then chants the Three Reverences:\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow to the Most High, the Boundless Great Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow to the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow to the Great Dharma Master of the Dark Mystery.\n\nThen, sitting upright, the disciple prostrates before the master.\nThe master recites the *Yuan Shi* prohibitions and precepts,\nthe disciple responding \"Yes\" to each phrase.\nThe disciple, so-and-so, states his name,\nthe master instructs: the disciple chants \"Yes\" three times.\n\nThe *Primordial Beginning’s Red Writ of Five Chapters*,\nthe Upper Clarity’s natural scripture,\nthe Nine Heavens’ primal-born numinous Cavernous Chapters,\nforming heaven and establishing earth,\nunfolding the myriad Perfected,\npacifying spirits and anchoring numina,\ngiving life to and nurturing the multitudes,\ngoverning and guiding the cosmic movements,\npreserving heaven’s eternal endurance.\nAbove, it regulates the celestial mechanisms;\nin the middle, it inspects the Five Numinous;\nbelow, it governs the earthly deities,\nwhistling commands to the River’s source,\ndirecting and employing yin and yang,\nsummoning spirits and dispatching immortals.\nThis is the scripture of the Utmost Perfected,\nwondrously responding to the natural,\ncausing heaven’s heights to clear,\nmaking earth firm and secure,\npreserving and guarding the Five Peaks,\nwherein the ten thousand beings abide.\nThe Primordial Beginning inscribed it in the Divine Capital’s hall,\nthrough countless kalpas and cosmic movements,\nits text remains steadfast at heaven’s root,\nnever destroyed or lost,\nmoving with the cosmic shifts,\nmingling yet unstained,\ndefiled yet ever purer,\ndestroyed yet not extinguished,\nextinguished yet supremely luminous.\nThe Great Possession’s scripture,\nrevered by the Heavenly Perfected,\nunless one’s name is inscribed in the Imperial Register,\ncarved on the bamboo slips of future lives,\nthis scripture remains hidden and secret,\nnone may glimpse or hear of it.\nThose who obtain it\nabide with the Three Qi eternally;\ndiligently practicing its methods,\nthey attain the divine immortals’ rank.\n\nOnly through wholehearted devotion and personal reverence may household and state know peace, life be preserved, calamities averted, and all inauspicious omens swept away. When the Son of Heaven and feudal lords uphold it, the realm attains great tranquility, hostile invaders submit of themselves, borderlands cease their strife, the myriad people sing in praise, and all under heaven flourishes. As the cycles of fate revolve, the true Dao prevails; those who obtain it summon forth spontaneity, their celestial perfection held in wondrous esteem, concealed by the Nine Heavens. It must not be lightly disclosed, lest judgment befall your person.\n\nShould a disciple be deemed worthy of transmission, though the prescribed years of fifty-eight have not yet been fulfilled, let all ritual requisites be fully prepared. Following the Yellow Register, take the Three Masters, and initiate nineteen disciples. Only when merit is complete may the precious instructions be conveyed. No unauthorized master may privately instruct others. Should one violate these statutes, recklessly divulging without covenant, both master and recipient shall face the Four Extremities’ trial, while seven generations of ancestors sink into the earthly mounds, bound for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious? Let this be heeded.\n\nThereupon, the disciple rises and bows thrice, then prostrates again.\n\nNext, the Six Vows are conferred, saying:\nFirst vow: not to lightly disclose.\nSecond vow: not to treat with irreverence.\nThird vow: not to transmit recklessly.\nFourth vow: not to speak of it idly.\nFifth vow: not to transgress the scripture’s prohibitions.\nSixth vow: not to accept wealth in exchange for the Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy’s Six Vows bind the human heart; when the human heart is steadfast, the heart of the Dao is true. One must not violate these vows or breach the covenant, lest the Wind Blade befall them eternally.\n\nAs the vows are recited, first hold incense, and the disciple points one hand to heaven—left for men, right for women.\n\nThereupon, the disciple bows six times. The master stands and intones:\nThe true Dao is lofty and wondrous, revealed when resonance is felt. With sincere devotion, the Supreme Mystery is moved to compassion. The Purple Text refines the essence, divine gold subdues demons. Radiant and majestic, its power renders one a divine immortal. Now it is transmitted and entrusted—swear not to speak of it recklessly. Treasure and conceal the true descent; to divulge it is to invite disaster. The celestial statutes are stern—let this be upheld.\n\nThereupon, the disciple bows six times again.\n\nNext, the master formally confers the disciple’s rank, saying: *Supreme Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavern-Mystery Disciple, Master of Such-and-Such Peak, So-and-So.*\n\nThe disciple kneels to receive, then retreats, joining the tablets at the ends. Bowing to the original master, they perform nine prostrations, rising and kneeling thrice, advancing on elbows and knees.\n\nCompleted, they turn left, face east toward the west, and bow twice. Then they turn north, then east, then south, bowing twice to each, in the daily audience of the Four Extremities.\n\nReturning to their position, they bow thrice to the Three Masters overseeing the transmission.\n\nNext, they again read the petitions to the Ten Directions and the tablets of the Five Masters, facing the respective directions as before, save that the Five Masters face west.\n\nConcluding, they kneel in profound gratitude. The disciple kowtows, striking their cheeks without count.\n\nTheir words are:\n\nThe Supreme Perfected, Most High Numinous Treasure, Peerless Cavernous Mystery Disciples, the so-and-so Peak Masters, your subjects so-and-so and others, now reverently burn incense and kowtow, entrusting body and spirit, pledging life to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthies, the Perfected Lords of the Ten Realms who have attained the Dao, the Venerable Ones, the Thirty-Six Divisions of Revered Scriptures, the Great Dharma Masters of the Cavernous Mystery, the Three Perfected of the Supreme Unity, the High Mystery Dharma Masters of the Great Ultimate, the Orthodox Unity Perfected of the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, and all the deities within and beyond the Three Realms.\n\nYour subjects, in transmitting the precepts to disciple so-and-so, who ascends the altar to swear the covenant, humbly beseech the grace of the Most High and all the Worthies to deliver and save us. We pray for the forgiveness of your subjects, this master and disciples, from the time our parents gave us form, along with all our karmic dependents, and for the myriad sins and transgressions of so-and-so, that all may be permitted this transmission.\n\nFrom the establishment of the retreat until this day, we have violated precepts and laws, erred in conduct and decorum, mispronounced names contrary to nature, transgressed the order of seniority, and deviated in the conferral of ranks. We implore your great compassion to absolve and pardon us, that we may not incur punishment.\n\nWe humbly pray that your grace flow forth at this very moment, your majesty manifest today. May the mouths of the precious pearl today, though countless in number, ascend upon the precious pearl, attain fellowship with the exalted, together cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, together traverse Dragon Mountain and reach its summit, and realize the four fruits of attainment. May the fruits of past vows be fulfilled in fivefold, their fulfillment coinciding with this very hour.\n\nAs the pearl’s mouth knows no overflow, as water and fire cannot burn or sink it, so today do men and women gaze in admiration at the phoenix wheel, awaiting afar the dragon chariot. All these wise companions, each the father of their father’s father, united in the One of the Mysterious Unity, we pray that the five eyes reward diligence, the three luminances bestow virtue, that merit and joy, toil and ease, all flow in harmonious delight. May the tally of death be dissolved, the record of life blessed. May the hymns of the Primordial Beginning endure forever, the unending celebration of the never-ending resound.\n\nMay each be granted extended lifespan and discerning form, protected and sheltered in their station, whether high or low, young or old. May the faithful sons of heaven’s protection and the guarded daughters of the Dharma attain their ends. May the women’s fruits be inscribed on purple tablets, the men’s names harmonize with the jade registers. May they vie in immortality with the Red Earl, attain the Dao and compete in liberation with the Mountain Charts. May the paths of misfortune be extinguished together, the steps of fortune arise through compassion.\n\nMay the Emperor’s reign be prolonged, the people cherished, the state governed. May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings universally come. May imprisonment and distress be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May calamities and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.\n\nFor all other wishes, may each be carved as desired: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Perfected attain the Perfected. May all aspirations be fulfilled, all desires realized. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit deliver living beings. May it extend to all the celestial bodies of the heavens—sun, moon, and stars—the mountains and rivers, the dragon kings, bird kings, beast kings, insect kings, spirit kings of the myriad things, and all heavenly kings. In every place, whether heavenly spirits or earthly deities, mountain and water numina, local officials and guardians, all the soldiers and functionaries of the various defenses, may they all turn at once and together ascend to wondrous victory.\n\nWe pray that the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of transgression. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers bring forth dragon charts. May the five magic mushrooms and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.\n\nMay boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor and rejoice in the work, and all men and women who observe and listen. May all those of karmic affinity together enjoy supreme blessings, their dark resources reaching the six paths, their blessings extending to the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed, crowned with heavenly robes, attaining joy and ease, forever forming good affinities, eternally companions of the Dharma, never again retreating, with the attainment of the Dao as their appointed time.\n\nAs for the altar master who pledges himself, so-and-so: may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence, divine perfected guard his life, heavenly writings inspire auspicious signs. May the eight assemblies correspond to the charts, the six perfections be constantly upheld, the four practices remain unbroken, the five penetrations elevate him to immortality, the ten transformations enable him to soar. May his body be as adamantine and pure, perfectly attaining the sagely fruit. We bow our heads to the Ten Directions, ever abiding in the Three Treasures.\n\nNext, the master recites the verses on the three destinies and five sufferings:\n\nThe Three Powers and the myriad things,\nEach dependent, each with its span.\nEnd and beginning await the kalpas’ reckoning,\nWhen fortune is exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.\n\nBack and forth through the five paths,\nAh, the suffering of repeated death and birth!\nTurning in the three destinies,\nComing and going with calamity.\n\nGreat worthies, heed this warning,\nRestrain your nature, sever your passions.\nFoolish men do not believe the Dharma,\nTheir sins and pains ever cling to them.\n\nI grieve that the world knows no end,\nThus I now proclaim it anew.\nIf you wish to cross this suffering,\nTake refuge in the Most High Scriptures.\n\nSin and fortune do not come from another,\nTruly, they arise from your own voice.\nGreat worthies, therefore, seal your mouths,\nSeeking to sever all evil affinities.\n\nExtinguish thoughts, attain complete cessation,\nDependent arising awaits final dissolution.\nExpound the Dao to pacify the world,\nIn the end, you shall see the True Perfected.\n\nLust and jealousy are the roots of misfortune,\nThe greatest perils to body and life.\nNurturing such harms,\nHow can the Dao find peace?\n\nKnowing evil yet not reforming,\nI fear it must lead to early death.\nHarboring poison while fasting,\nIt makes me sigh deeply.\n\nKarma from past lives is indeed so,\nYet the weak and lost call it nonexistent.\nAll wish to see it before their eyes,\nDismissing what passes beyond their gaze.\n\nGreat worthies, illuminate the Dharma’s teachings,\nMourn the stubborn and dull.\nTenderly I grieve for your suffering,\nDiligently I cause myself sorrow.\n\nLife is consumed and exhausted,\nLike a flame in the oil.\nThe Four Great are but temporary lodging,\nThe Five Aggregates a provisional loan.\n\nIn your prime, study diligently,\nHasten to preserve your self.\nWhen fortune is spent, body and spirit scatter,\nIn the dark hells below.\n\nThe sagely fear this,\nThus they seek the Dao to cross this calamity.\nTo learn immortality is urgent,\nUphold the precepts, restrain the heart.\n\nLet emptiness and equanimity house the true qi,\nThe immortals and sages will naturally seek you.\nIf you do not believe the Dharma’s words,\nWhy dwell in the mountains?\n\nGreat worthies, delight in the scriptures and precepts,\nReceive them as treasures for your body.\nTo begin study is ever too late,\nTo cultivate the self, one ever regrets not starting sooner.\n\nWhen I now delve into the profound and obscure,\nIn a flash, the years have aged me.\nClutching the scroll, I reach the limit of my breath,\nSoon to face death’s agony and sorrow.\n\nThus in my youthful prime,\nI abandoned the world to study the Dao.\nNext, the Dharma Master turned eastward,\nHis mouth declaring merit, then resuming office.\n\nTai Xuan Du Zhengyi, the Celestial Master of Yangping’s Left Rectifying Qi, Minister So-and-so,\nBows twice and respectfully submits:\nAccording to the documents, I, a mere mortal of flesh and blood,\nFortunate in destiny, was born into the Dharma gate.\nBy the great sagely grace, I was graciously and profoundly favored,\nPermitted to partake of the wondrous essentials of the inner and outer true teachings—\nThe Dao of immortality, transcendence, and deathlessness.\nI humbly ascend the *Shangqing* and *Sandong* treasured scriptures’ ascending-aurora guard,\nWhose boundless, profound favor is unmatched.\n\nThe Dao is weighty, man is light—\nHow could my foul bones bear such a burden?\nTo fail the celestial offices would leave me headless.\n\nToday, I ascend this mountain ridge\nTo confer the precious scriptures of initiation upon my disciple So-and-so,\nSummoning from within his body the Three Divisions and Eight Radiant Spirits,\nThe celestial immortals’ steeds, the flying\n\nHaving concluded the covenant rites, the celestial and terrestrial spirits invoked are now respectfully dismissed to return to the Nine Heavens, proceeding in due order. From the Purple Mansion’s Jade Pavilion, through the wondrous gate and golden portal, the Jade Void True Qi’s Merit Officers and the divine steeds of the immortals enter my body, encircling and suffusing every vessel, bone, and joint. Within, they fill me with immortal qi; without, they sever all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that I may soon attain flight and ascension. The feathered steeds of the immortals ascend directly to the Imperial Throne. Swallow the Twenty-Four Qi and halt.\n\nNext, the Dharma Master returns to the incense burner and intones:\n\"Incense Officers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense altar, that I may attain the Dao and swiftly achieve transcendence. May disciples So-and-so and all within their households, both inner and outer, receive blessings. May the ten directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, conveying my supplications directly to the Jade Emperor’s celestial throne.\"\n\nNext, recite the *Precepts Hymn*:\nThe Dao is the heartless origin,\nAll acts are fields of merit.\nOne cessation—no fixed measure of merit,\nEach vow springs from the self.\nEmpty the self to respond to all beings,\nFocus the mind without partiality.\nThe Great Sage exalts the true teaching,\nAs rain descends from heaven.\nLofty and boundless, none untouched,\nYet humility forms the abyss.\nThe sea is king of a hundred rivers,\nFor it can forsake even the dragon’s scales.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures—\nNot merely for this lifetime.\nUphold the precepts without lapse,\nAnd life after life, good karma binds.\nWith concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,\nAnd you shall embody the Dao’s truth.\n\nRecite the *Returning Precepts Hymn*:\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,\nExpounds the precepts to deliver all beings.\nVirtue and power pervade the hidden and manifest,\nKarmic retribution summons the true spirits.\nThe devas bow in reverence,\nWhile demonic hordes restrain their forms.\nThe past transcends the Eight Difficulties,\nThe present secures a thousand years.\nWhen the merit of the fast is complete,\nTogether we send forth our devotion.\nThe flowing Sanskrit and soaring clouds chant,\nFragrant smoke mingles with incense’s perfume.\nJade phoenixes ride crimson chariots,\nGolden dragons draw emerald carriages.\nIn life and death, all find joy,\nFamilies and nations attain peace.\n\nUpon completion, master and disciples circumambulate the altar, chanting Sanskrit hymns, and conclude the rites. Alternatively, they may return to the incense burner and perform the *Ascending Heaven and Treading Earth* rites upon the august altar. Then, master and disciples chant Sanskrit hymns as they exit through the northwest gate of the Nine Heavens—without looking back.\n\nThe *Treading Earth* and *Dissolving Form* talismans are inscribed in blue on white silk; the *Ascending Heaven* and *Concealment* talismans are written in yellow on green silk. Some masters say: before declaring merit, perform these rites to completion, then lead the disciple to face north and bow four times to the Jade Throne of the Supreme Lord. Next, face east and bow twice to the Great Emperor Lord. Then, face south and bow twice to the Most High Perfected. Afterward, face west and bow twice to Master Zhang, the Heavenly Master. On the third day, the disciple declares merit, holds a fast to give thanks, and the rites are recorded in a separate scroll.\n\nNext, the disciple performs the *Lance-Tablet Casting* rite in the direction of their life’s origin at the altar. Facing east, they knock their teeth together three times, offer incense, and pray:\n\"Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Attendant Officers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens who attend the incense, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each—to emerge. I now burn incense and invoke the local earth deities and the true officials of the four directions. May the Supreme Lord’s ten-directional true qi enter my body, that my supplications ascend directly to the throne of the Most High, Perfect, and Great Sage, the Celestial Worthy and Jade Emperor.\"\n\nUpon finishing, they turn to face the king and knock their teeth together twelve times. After reading the tablet, they pray:\n\"Heaven unfolds, earth extends,\nThe Nine Qi divide their numinous power.\nThe Three Origins share a single talisman,\nThe ten directions are mystically pure.\nThe Five Elder Thearchs,\nOpen the true and guide the living.\nCinnabar script and vermilion texts,\nPrimordial essence of the Highest Origin—\nUniversally proclaimed to the supreme,\nThe august spirits of the Nine Lands.\nToday is most auspicious,\nAll immortals confirm life.\nI vow for my immortal self,\nTo cast my jade name.\nThe Earth Mansion’s Great August One,\nErase my sinful form.\nSubmit the tablet to the Upper Palace,\nInscribe it in the Azure Register.\nSwiftly attain flight and ascension,\nHeaven and earth share their numinous power.\nNine generations of kin,\nRotten bones renewed in glory.\nSouls ascend to the Southern Palace,\nTransformed in the immortal courts.\nToday I declare my mandate—\nMay all spirits heed!\nWith golden clasps I affirm\nMy utmost sincerity.\nAs I have petitioned, so let it be—\nBy golden dragon courier.\"\n\nUpon completion, they offer incense and return to the incense burner, following the above method.\n\nThe *Highest Origin Numinous Treasure* addresses the Nine Earths’ Earth August Ones, the *Extinguishing Sins and Inscribing Names to Seek Immortality* method:\nThe *Numinous Treasure* and *Vermilion Thearch* female Daoist adept, So-and-so, aged such-and-such, born in such-and-such month, life registered under the Southern Dipper of the Nine Heavens.\nExplanation: This text refers to the Vermilion Thearch as one whose life origin is in the *bing-wu* (fire-horse) year, and whose life is registered under the Nine Heavens if born in the first or second month. The Southern Dipper governs the direction of one’s life origin; the rest follows this pattern.\nVowing to become a spirit, vowing to become an immortal,\nTo attain long life and transcend the world,\nTo soar to the Upper Clarity,\nThe Central August of the Nine Lands.\nThe Yellow Spirits of *wu-ji*,\nThe Five Thearchs of the Earth Mansion—\nI beseech you to erase my sin records,\nInscribe them in the Great Mystery.\nPetition the Central Palace,\nCast the tablet to record my name.\nGolden clasps affirm my faith,\nGolden dragons courier the transmission.\nIn the year of such-and-such, such-and-such month, such-and-such day, at such-and-such prefecture, commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the petition is declared.\n\nThe right side is inscribed on a silver tablet in vermilion, wrapped in blue paper, bound with nine blue silk clasps, and sealed with one golden dragon. It is buried at the central palace of one’s residence. Next, present the spirit tablet, inscribe the tablet, and bury it in the corresponding direction of the altar. Alternatively, it may be cast into mountain ravines, deep springs, or abysses—let no one retrieve it.\n\nEach tablet is one foot and two inches long, two inches and four fen wide, and three fen thick.\n\nThe *Altar Ascent Offerings* are as follows:\nTwenty-four thousand gold coins (copper coins or treasures of equivalent value may be substituted).\nNine taels of gold.\nOne bolt each of five-colored silk.\n\nFive large mats.\nFive *he* boxes of blended incense, each holding two *dou* and five *sheng*.\nFive incense burners.\nOne seven-star table.\nOne crimson-patterned cloth.\nOne five-*chi* double-layered turquoise-patterned cloth.\nOne five-*chi* double-layered cloth with five-colored scattered floral patterns, one *dou* in quantity.\nBirth-year silk, its length measured by the year of one’s age.\n\nFor those born in the first or second month: their register belongs to the Azure Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Nine-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the fourth or fifth month: their register belongs to the Vermilion Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Three-*Qi* Lords.\nFor those born in the seventh or eighth month: their register belongs to the White Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Seven-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the tenth or eleventh month: their register belongs to the Mysterious Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the Five-*Qi* Heavenly Lords.\nFor those born in the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month: their register belongs to the Yellow Heaven, and their *qi* is linked to the One-*Qi* Heavenly Lord.\n\nAccording to the month of the ordination rite:\nIn the first or second month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the fourth or fifth month, state: “Now in the Three-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the seventh or eighth month, state: “Now in the Seven-*Qi*.”\nIn the tenth or eleventh month, state: “Now in the Five-*Qi* Heaven.”\nIn the third, sixth, ninth, or twelfth month, state: “Now in the One-*Qi* Heaven.”\n\nThe *Highest Dongxuan Lingbao Ordination Rites* are here concluded.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites*\nCompiled by the Daoist Lu Xiujing of the Liu-Song dynasty. This work expounds the rituals for transmitting the ancient *Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*. One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity*, Cavern Mystery Section, *Weiyi* (威仪) Category.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial on the *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***\n\nYour servant Xiujing, abiding in the utmost Dao and reverently awaiting the numinous scriptures, has never forgotten them even in haste. By fortunate coincidence, one of humble grass and thatch has been permitted to peruse the dragon-and-phoenix chapters. The profound and august majesty is beyond what I can bear; my heart is filled with both joy and fear, like ice and fire.\n\nSince presumptuously receiving these teachings seventeen years ago, I have devoted all sincerity and thought to upholding and studying them, immersing myself in the divine texts and savoring their mysterious essence. With mind fixed and eyes intent, I have striven for mastery, holding fast to my resolve and exerting myself day and night without respite. Through careful examination of what I have received, I have roughly attained a comprehensive understanding. I feel my spirit awakened and my mind enlightened, gradually grasping the principles and their return to the source. The subtle meanings and wondrous subtleties are inherently beyond my reach, yet the coarse traces and proximate purport may be faintly glimpsed.\n\nI humbly observe that the great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure descends to deliver humanity. The ancient catalog of its arcane regulations comprises thirty-six fascicles. Its talismans and diagrams arise naturally from emptiness, and its eulogies and explanations are inscribed by the highest perfected ones. It is the path by which immortals and sages ascend, the guiding norm across kalpas. Its language is wondrously elegant and august; its matters are truly essential and profoundly subtle. Its words are pure, empty, mysterious, and refined; its principles are deep, abstruse, and boundless. It clarifies the distinctions between sin and blessing, adapts its methods to circumstances, and provides precepts, regulations, and rituals to guide all directions. Its numinous sounds resonate in eight directions, opening the ears of the deaf and the eyes of the blind. Its Dharma gates extend in four directions, accommodating both the great and the small. Its vast transformation is immeasurable, like an infinite bridge of Dharma.\n\nYet when the true teaching first arose, the celestial scriptures were treasured and revered. The profound store of the Great Existence was not fully revealed. However, among the scriptures now extant—those transmitted from the Primordial Beginning and those received by the Perfected Lords—thirty-five fascicles that I have verified are complete, with roots and branches, exterior and interior, mutually supporting one another. The body of the Great Vehicle is amply provided for.\n\nYet for the ordination rites, only two memorials exist. There are no established forms for petitions, memorials, or invocations. When the sages transmit the Dharma, the celestial perfected ones are arrayed in full, and there is no need for the cumbersome invocation of names. But in this defiled and turbid world below, divine officials must be moved to respond. Without complete regulations, the foolish are left without guidance.\n\nSince the Numinous Treasure began guiding the world, those who have transmitted it have sometimes conferred the Three Caverns together, sharing the same altar and covenant. The refined and the coarse are intermingled, the great and the small are confounded. At times, one receives only the Cavern Mystery, yet employs the rites of the higher Dharma. Proclamations and summonses are misapplied, with no proper authority to oversee them. Some borrow from the lower paths of the Yellow and Red Officials, descending to the base and vulgar, forcing what is inappropriate, causing inversion and chaos. They fail to adhere to proper forms, deviate from the hidden classics, and mislead later disciples.\n\nI sigh over this morning and night, my heart aching as if weeping blood. Yet the true teachers are distant and unattainable, and I cannot hope to seek them out. The worldly teachings lack these texts, and the urgent need for them demands fulfillment. Thus, I dare, in my ignorance, to consult the *Golden and Yellow Registers*, the *Luminous Perfected Jade Instructions*, and the *Instructions on the Scripture of the True One’s Spontaneity*. Following the models of the myriad perfected sages who conferred ordination, I have compiled rites for the assembly of the divine officials of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences at the altar for the covenant oath, establishing a complete set of ritual procedures.\n\nYet these matters are profoundly abstruse and utterly transcendent, beyond the measure of mortal eyes. The affairs of the divine are subtle—how could a corpse-like fool comprehend them? My hand trembles as I write, my body and soul both unraveling. I fear that errors may incur guilt, and that my creation may invite punishment. Hesitant and apprehensive, I tread as if upon blades and poison.\n\nThough the compilation is complete, I dare not presume to use it. I have purified myself and observed a fast before the Three Treasures, reciting it once through. I humbly beseech the Supreme Ones, the myriad venerables, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center to deign to inspect and examine my submission. If there is even the slightest merit in it, I beg that it be permitted for use. If it is not acceptable, I shall promptly destroy it. Whether it is fitting or not must be determined by numinous signs. I earnestly pray for a response, awaiting a manifestation. With reverence, I submit this.\n\nYour servant Xiujing, with utmost trepidation and awe, bows twice and respectfully reports.\n\nYour servant Lu Xiujing respectfully presents this.\n\n---\n\n**The *Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Ordination Rites***\n\nThe *Yellow Register’s Brief Text on the Ranks of Transcendent Immortals* states: When receiving the scriptures and Dharma, one should initiate nineteen disciples for the Three Masters, establishing merit and virtue so that their names are recorded in the heavens. Only then may they ascend the altar to swear the covenant, receive the *True Writ of the Five Elders in Red Script and Jade Chapters*, the *Twenty-Four Perfected of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences*, and the offices of the celestial transcendent riders and highest perfected ones. Those who receive the great Dharma without having established merit and fame will be seized by the Three Officials, facing bitter retribution in life and death, and will be examined by the Court of Illuminating Dharma.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: The covenant requires 24,000 gold coins as a pledge to the twenty-four qi-generating officials. If this solemn pledge is lacking, the gods of the Three Divisions and Eight Effulgences will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life. If gold is unavailable, copper may be used as a substitute. If entirely lacking, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the General Divine Court.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Five taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Five Marchmounts as a pledge for the precious scriptures. The *Jade Instructions* state: Nine taels of highest-grade gold are used to swear an oath with the Nine Heavens. If lacking, one incurs the penalty for disrespecting the scriptures. The numinous mountains of the Five Marchmounts will not register the disciple’s name in the ledgers of learning, and the case falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Yin Officials.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Forty feet of figured silk from each of the five directions are used to invoke the Five Emperors as a pledge for the oath. If lacking, the Five Emperors will not accept the disciple’s name, and the demon kings of the Five Emperors will harm them, causing their aspirations and thoughts to waver. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the Water Officials and the Court of the Springs and Bends.\n\nThe *Illuminating Perfected Regulations* state: Three gold dragons and three gold buttons are cast into mountains, waters, and earth as a pledge for learning transcendence. If these are not offered, the Three Officials will seize the disciple’s name in the ledgers of life, and their prayers will not be answered. Violations fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of the Nine Capitals.",

Additionally, one *dou* of five-colored mixed flowers is required, to be scattered in the ten directions during the perfected one’s transmission of the precepts. Five large mats, a seven-patterned altar table, five incense burners with lidded boxes, and a length of life-bestowing silk corresponding to the disciple’s age in *chi* are also needed.\n\nThe eight items listed above are used as pledges for the altar rites and oaths.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: In spring, the rites are performed on *jiayin* and *yimao* days; in summer, on *dingsi* and *bingwu* days; during the four seasons, on *wuchen*, *wuxu*, *jiwei*, and *jichou* days; in autumn, on *gengshen* and *xinyou* days; and in winter, on *guihai* and *renzi* days. The rites are conducted on the days of the establishing *wang* phase.\n\n*The Jade Instructions* state: A high altar is constructed upon the sacred peaks, enclosed with railings on four sides.

They shall submit a memorial on yellow silk, petitioning the heavens for the sacred texts. The altar is exposed to the open air for one night; if no wind stirs and the writings remain unshaken, the candidate’s bone-name aligns with the Dao, and the transmission may proceed after the oath. If the wind disturbs the writings, the candidate must retreat and fast for three more days, then repeat the ritual as before. Should the wind disrupt the proceedings three times, and the candidate lacks a predestined name or virtuous merit, the Three Realms will not acknowledge them, the Five Emperors will not protect them, their bone-*qi* will not harmonize, and the teachings must not be lightly transmitted. This is examined and verified by the Bureau of Rectification.\n\nFor the great oath of the *Numinous Treasure* and the overnight exposure of the true writings, the order of submitting memorials and exiting the official precincts is as follows:\n\nOnce the altar is established in the sacred mountain site, the master and disciple enter together through the earthly gate, circling left. The master enters the inner altar’s royal gate, facing north to offer incense three times. First, the two registers of true writings received by the disciple are placed upon the table.

When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the Earth Gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the Heavenly Gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice more, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south.

They circumambulate left. Three times they offer incense to the Five Directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, illuminating and covering his form as one.

Since presumptuously receiving them, I have revered and aspired to the supreme Dharma, my heart yearning for immortality, yet my sincerity remains shallow and weak, failing to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions, I dread sinking into the Nine Springs. Heaven’s compassion is vast, and my life has been preserved; I ought to guard my shortcomings and dare not speak further.\n\nNow, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the Dao, and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior deliverance and ascension have left celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy ones from the middle realm to fill the heavens. On the day I received the Dharma, I was to deliver others first; those whose names were predestined in the Golden Registers and Jade Records, the perfected ones, have traversed the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one whose destiny is predestined: the Perfected Person of Such-and-Such Marchmount, So-and-So, aged such-and-such years, whose embodied conduct is pure and true, whose bones and destiny align with perfection, and who has already received the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ of the supreme Dharma. Though his participation has been humble and narrow, he has not yet beheld the source of the Dao; his faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing. Now, bearing golden silks and Dharma tokens, he seeks to receive the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ Jade Chapters of the True Text, the Golden Writ Purple Characters’ Jade Text Vermilion Seal Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Divisions’ Eight Effulgences’ Charts of Immortals’ Mounted Escorts, the Inner Sounds of the Heavens’ Spontaneous Jade Mighty Command Records of Eight Characters, and other sacred implements—divine staves, covenant texts, treasure scriptures—pledging his sincerity, making supplication, with his nine ancestors as witnesses, swearing to treasure them as his own body, vowing never to transgress.\n\nThe prohibitions of the Dharma I have received are weighty, and I dare not lightly proclaim them. After thorough verification, his words and sincerity grow ever firmer; examining his cinnabar heart, I deem him capable of accomplishment. Since the Dharma allows for deliverance, I dare not obstruct it. Accordingly, following the *Yellow Register’s Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortals’ Ordinances and Ranks*, I have fasted with him for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky, with heaven clear and earth still, the four qi tranquil, no wind stirring, no dust rising—meeting the Dharma and aligning with perfection. Now, reverently adhering to the ancient canons of my former masters, I transmit to So-and-So the essentials of the Illuminating Perfected Great Dharma and Jade Instructions, ascending the August Altar together.\n\nWith golden silks to secure the numinous, I first bow and present a scroll of yellow silk with a vermilion memorial, ascending to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection. Next, I read the memorial text aloud, then strike my teeth three times to dispatch it. I solemnly dispatch the Five Body Immortal Officials and their mounted escorts within my body, the repeatedly commanded Merit Clerk Messengers, the Memorializing Direct Talisman Transmitting Words and Writing Assistants, all solemnly attired in manifest vestments, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry the minister’s delivered Dao yellow silk vermilion memorial, ascending to the presence of the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Perfected Great Sage Honored Divine Lords.\n\nShould my words be inverted or erroneous, the texts mistaken or deviating from the ancient Dharma, I pray they be corrected and rectified according to the matter, ensuring they align above, without causing the overseeing celestial officials to reject or reprimand. If any demonic spirits, ghosts, or malevolent forces obstruct or intercept the public documents, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense. May what I have presented be conveyed above, and may my wishes surely reach fulfillment. Humbly awaiting your gracious consideration and response, I prostrate myself in anticipation of your decree.",

      "translated_text": "Then the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. The drum is sounded thirty-six times.\n\nThe Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Master, so-and-so the Master, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendant Immortals, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptures, the Supervisor of Ordination Sima, the Four Directors and Five Emperors, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens—all bearing purple-feathered tablets and tenfold sacred banners, accompanied by ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers, descending together through the void.\n\nHeavenly ranks arrayed, they oversee the covenant of ordination. Your servant, relying on the assembled perfected immortals and flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Beginning Five Venerables, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneous Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Lord, the Supreme Pole Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Supreme Mystery Unity, and the host of honored ones in the Jade Tower below:\n\nYour servant, a fool of base flesh, has by past merit and destined meeting encountered the true scriptures and received the great Dharma of the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles profound—far beyond my capacity. Day and night I tremble in fear, body and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, kowtows again and again, acknowledging my mortal transgressions.\n\nPresumptuously overstepping my station, I dare to present these words. I reflect that the honored scriptures are sacred and weighty, their origins deep and fathomless—truly not something a humble servant may expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and regulations decree that transmission may only occur after fifty-eight hearings. My grasp of the Dharma is still shallow; I am unworthy to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end and the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate swiftly. The Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated, that they enter the Dharma gate.\n\nThough the hearts of people today are shallow and deceitful, truth and falsehood hard to discern, yet those who yearn with utmost sincerity—even faintly—may be recognized. Through earnest seeking and sincere devotion, none should be shut out. Having previously submitted a memorial for your celestial attention, I now respectfully report that the Perfected of such-and-such an Emperor, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unblemished. His aspirations are lofty, unconcerned with glory or splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the real, longing for immortality. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle of the Supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit. Diligent in alchemical toil, tireless in his devotion, he has drilled and striven for years, his resolve fixed on the source of the Dao.\n\nNow he presents gold, silk, and precious tokens—requisites for receiving the true teachings—and swears before the assembled spirits, with his nine generations of ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Beginning Five Venerables’ Red Writ of the True Text and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Luminaries, the Jade Scripts of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as I have observed.\n\nSo-and-so’s innate nature and conduct are fitting for accomplishment. Respectfully following the ancient statutes of the Illustrious Perfected, I have established an altar, formed a covenant, and sworn before the Nine Heavens. In accordance with the regulations, I now confer these upon him. Let them be treasured as his own body, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or carelessly profaned. To violate this would be to sever his roots and destroy his lineage, to harm the parents who gave him life, and to bring upon himself the trials of the wind-blade and the knife, with no reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nMay the Most High and the host of honored ones, the Ten Directions’ Sacred Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Emperors witness this covenant. Respectfully submitted for your celestial consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost reverence and dread, bows twice with head reverently lowered.\n\nThen the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master. Three times they offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east, kneeling lengthily each time they approach a quarter. When the circuit is complete, they circumambulate three times and scatter flowers in the ten directions. At this time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns are chanted in turn. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Pole Perfected:**\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao\nRevealed the Numinous Treasure scriptures.\nSublime and wondrous, beyond compare—\nLike the mystery within the mystery.\nThe spontaneous, non-actional Dao,\nStudied, leads to lofty immortality.\nVast is the Cavernous Void scripture,\nSeated in peace, one may ascend the heavens.\nAbove, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace;\nBelow, it conceals itself in famous mountains.\nResplendent with dragon and phoenix script,\nIts radiance gleams in the spaceless.\nWondrous is the Most High’s Dao,\nNon-actional, ever spontaneous.\nKings, lords, and common folk—\nAll esteem only the loyal and worthy.\nThose with past-life blessings,\nOutstanding from former causes,\nReceive the Dharma Master’s transmission,\nThe precious trust for kalpas uncounted.\nBroadly mindful of delivering all,\nGreat fortune returns to your person.\nIn offering, one attains the Dao;\nIn practice, one becomes a perfected one.\nThe Great Dao has no self or other—\nTransmission must find the right person.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity First Perfected:**\nFrom the Cavern of All Wonders,\nResplendent, it illumines the Great Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies eternally enduring.\nCarefree, they sport in the mysterious void,\nPalaces arrayed in formlessness.\nLush are the seven-jeweled groves,\nRadiant as sun and moon’s essence.\nDragon scales intertwine in flight,\nPhoenixes soar with mournful cries.\nThe Most High governs the Purple Terrace,\nThe host of perfected chant the Cavern scriptures.\nBurning incense, they bow in reverence,\nCircumambulating the palace city.\nThree circuits return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nWhen the ruler embraces the supreme Dao,\nThe world enjoys universal peace.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Second Perfected:**\nEmptiness and constancy are spontaneous,\nForcibly named the Great Dao.\nBoundless and remote, without limit,\nAll wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.\nClosing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected;\nWith concentrated thought, the Ten Elders descend.\nAscending as immortals, forever non-actional,\nTheir numinous countenances ever wondrous.\nThirst quenched with jade pool nectar,\nHunger sated with golden radiance herbs.\nThrough stillness and wisdom, the eight perils are crossed,\nThe world’s myriad sufferings relieved.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Mystery Unity Third Perfected:**\nWondrous are the Numinous Treasure scriptures,\nThe Most High’s spontaneous texts.\nThose who uphold them attain immortality,\nCalled the true Heavenly Honored Ones.\nCharged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,\nTruly they transcend the mundane.\nTheir work complete, they ascend as immortals,\nTheir palaces govern the Mystery Terrace.\nAt times they descend Mount Kunlun,\nCarefree, they rest on Penglai.\n\n**Hymn of the Supreme Rectified Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:**\nThe Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—\nThe king of the perfected Dao’s scriptures.",

Above, impress it with the seal of the Primordial Beginning; below, impress it with the seal of the Five Elders.\nComplete, the disciple strikes the teeth thirty-six times and visualizes the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman Officers, each clad in robes of their directional color, their five-hued radiance flowing and blazing upon the staff. The Five Emperors’ Jade Maidens, one each, together guard the staff on left and right.\nThe disciple, as before, holds the staff horizontally across the chest.\nThe master recites:\n*\"Mountain of Grand Yang,\nPrimordial essence of the Highest Beginning,\nOpening heaven and unfurling earth,\nSweet bamboo channels the numinous.\nDirect Talisman Officers, guarding clerks,\nCommanding divine soldiers,\nFive colors flowing and blazing,\nCrimson fire and golden bells,\nAssisting and winging the Highest Perfected,\nExiting darkness and entering shadow,\nSummoning Heaven-Heaven’s reverence,\nSeizing Earth-Earth’s welcome,\nPointing at ghosts—ghosts die,\nDemonic rebels bound in form.\nNuminous talisman, divine staff,\nMightily subduing the hundred spirits,\nRising to seize all directions,\nBorn with me in life,\nAfter ten thousand kalpas,\nTo replace my form.\nRadiance becomes the Five Liberations,\nSpirit ascends to Highest Clarity.\nReceiving the talisman and proclaiming the mandate,\nNone dare disrespect or fail to heed.\"*\n\nComplete, draw the qi of the five directions and swallow it twenty-five times to conclude.\nNext, the master proclaims the Cinnabar Water Text:\n*\"Great Cavern Master of Such-and-Such Peak, your servant So-and-So, proclaims to disciples So-and-So and others:\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the boundless vastness, unfolded and expounded the true writ, weaving it into wondrous scriptures. Kalpa after kalpa, salvation and deliverance know no end, like the dust and sands of measureless eons without cease. The numinous writ, profound and recondite, is secreted within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the host of perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, it was bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and the wondrous scriptures of the Numinous Treasure thus emerged to deliver humankind.\nI, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered this numinous writ. My former master, in manifest adornment, transmitted the supreme Dharma, which I vowed to treasure as my own body—how dare I presume to divulge it? Yet as kalpas turn and fortunes shift, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who harmonize with the real, I transmit it in accordance with the statutes.\nToday, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow it upon So-and-So. After receiving the scriptures, you must follow the luminous statutes: purify yourself, discipline your body, devote yourself with diligence and sincerity, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform reverent rites, study the wondrous and abstruse, inquire of those accomplished in the Dao, practice guiding and refining, observe purification fasts and wear ritual vestments, and seek to ascend in flight. Honor the Dao and revere your master, esteeming the root above all. You must not be insincere, all face and no heart, nor assail your own foundation, nor fabricate groundless faults. Do not slight the scriptural treasures, nor indulge in superficial admiration, nor wallow in lust and greed, nor harbor jealousy, anger, or resentment. Do not be deceitful in heart, nor nurse malice within. Should you violate these precepts even once, your body will fill the Three Springs.\nYou, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together sink into the earthly prisons, without reprieve for ten thousand kalpas.\nToday, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the precious writ of the Ten Sections of Wondrous Scriptures. All heavens and the Five Peaks stand witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, uphold the Dharma with care, and hold it fast in your heart. Flight as an immortal may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the perfection of the Dao. Discipline yourself earnestly, as prescribed in the statutes of the Four Poles.\"*\n\nNext, the disciple’s own covenant text:\n*\"Disciple So-and-So of the Cavern Mystery, from Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Hamlet, prostrates and bows twice, reverently addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Dao Lord, the Venerable Divinities of the Ten Directions, and the Perfected of the Four Quarters who have already attained the Dao.\nThe precious talismans of the Thirty-Six Sections of the Most High Numinous Treasure’s venerable scriptures, and the Great Cavern Master So-and-So, by karmic affinity and accumulated merit, through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, have revolved unceasingly. Blessed by fortune’s reach and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma gate. By former vows, I aspired to the loftiest lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit exultant, fearing only the decay of this fleshly frame.\nNow, as heavenly fortunes shift and the imperial Dao’s destiny unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted and enlightened by Master So-and-So, who has opened my ignorant mind and bestowed upon me the numinous writ, allowing me to serve before the sagely lord. My mortal body trembles with awe, having washed away defilement and filth, and now attending the numinous altar. I bow in gratitude for this elevation, a glory beyond my due.\nI vow to discipline myself and purify my body, to make offerings and revere the honored rites, to cast off worldly entanglements and retire to secluded heights, to forever forsake the paths of the world and dwell only among hills and crags. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble capacities, hoping to rely on the sagely writ to deliver this decaying frame. With utmost sincerity and single-minded devotion, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor be all face and no heart, nor fail to preserve the kalpas.\nI, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my voice, dare to speak thus, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this oath, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant.\nI delight in the immortal’s path and dare not be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons of the Five Paths, and may I never be pardoned.\nAbove, I proclaim to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Before the master’s treasure and my own body, I establish this covenant oath. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance.\nYour servant So-and-So, with reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice.\"*\n\nNext, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true writ in his left hand.\nThe disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times and visualizes the colors of the five viscera, fully arrayed to form a canopy of precious clouds, covering the scriptures and the master.\nHe then recites:\n*\"The celestial writ’s simplicity is not burdensome,\nThe Dao and virtue are complete of themselves.\nCultivate them, and you shall surely become an immortal—\nWhat more could you desire?\nThe text shines in the Grand Interstice,\nResplendent and radiant.\nTransmit and receive it strictly by the Dharma;\nTo divulge or slight it is to fall into hell.\"*\n\nNext, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, and receives the true writ. Girding the sash and grasping the staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit.\nHe visualizes the Most High’s true form, like the Heavenly Worthy’s image.\nComplete, the master rises and paces in procession, chanting the *Step of Emptiness*:\n*\"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,\nBurning incense, I return to emptiness.\nLuminous radiance follows my turning,\nThe Dharma wheel likewise circles thrice.\"*",

The master recites the *Primordial Beginning’s Prohibitions and Precepts*, and the disciple responds with assent to each phrase, declaring his name: \"Disciple So-and-so.\" The master instructs, and the disciple responds three times with assent.\n\nThe *Primordial Beginning’s Red Writ of the Five Tablets* is the scripture of the Highest Clarity’s spontaneity, the numinous, cavernous chapters of the Nine Heavens’ inception, establishing heaven and earth, unfolding the myriad perfected, pacifying spirits and settling numina, engendering and completing the multitudes, rectifying and governing the cosmic rhythm, preserving heaven’s eternal endurance. Above, it regulates celestial mechanisms; at the center, it inspects the five numina; below, it reins the earthly deities. Whistling, it commands the river’s source, directs and employs yin and yang, summons spirits and dispatches immortals. This most perfected writ, wondrously responsive to spontaneity, causes heaven’s heights to clear, the earth to stand firm, the Five Peaks to secure their guardianship, and the ten thousand kinds to endure. The Primordial Beginning inscribed it in the Numinous Capital’s palace. Through countless kalpas, its text remains steadfast at heaven’s root, never decaying or sinking. With the cosmic rhythm, it shifts yet remains unstained; defiled, it grows ever purer; destroyed, it does not perish; extinguished, it shines most brightly. This writ of the Great Existence is revered by the heavenly perfected. Unless one’s name is recorded in the imperial register and inscribed on the tablets of future lives, this text remains hidden and secret, beyond the reach of prying eyes. Those who obtain it abide with the Three Qi eternally. Diligently practicing its methods, they attain immortality.",

We pray for absolution of all transgressions—from the time we first received form from our parents, through all karmic ties and kin, to the present—for the myriad sins and errors of your subjects and the disciple now receiving transmission. Since the establishment of this retreat until this day, we have violated precepts, broken laws, erred in conduct, failed in decorum, mispronounced sacred names, confused ranks and order, and deviated in the transmission of empowerment. We implore your great compassion to pardon and not hold us guilty.\n\nMay your mercy flow forth at once, your majesty manifest this day. Today, from the mouth of the Precious Pearl, countless beings ascend to its summit, joining the assembly of the exalted. Together they cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, surmount the Dragon Mountain and reach in unison, attaining the four fruits of realization. Thus may the five vows previously made be fulfilled in this moment.\n\nThe Pearl’s mouth knows no overflow, water and fire cannot burn or sink it. Today, men and women gaze in awe at the Phoenix Chariot, awaiting the Dragon Carriage from afar. All these wise companions, each the father of their father’s father, share in the One of the Mystic Unity. May the five eyes reward diligence, the three luminances bestow virtue. May merit race like joyous steeds, and blessings of ease and delight abound. May the tally of death be erased, the record of life flourish. May the hymns of the Primal Beginning endure forever, and the unending celebration of the Never-Ending resound.\n\nMay each be granted extended destiny and discerning form, protection for high and low, life for young and old. May men be steadfast in faith, women guarded by the Dharma. May women bear purple tablets, men inscribe jade registers. May their immortality rival the Red Lord’s, their attainment of the Dao vie with the Mountain Chart’s liberation. May the paths of misfortune vanish together, and the steps of blessing rise through compassion. May emperors reign long, loving their people and governing the realm. May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings widely received. May prisons and calamities be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May disasters and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.\n\nFor all other wishes, may each be fulfilled as sought: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Real attain the Real. May all aspirations be harmonized, all desires fulfilled. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit aid living beings. May it extend to all—the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens; the mountains, rivers, peaks, and streams; the Dragon Kings, Bird Kings, Beast Kings, and Insect Kings; the myriad spirit-kings of all things; all Heavenly Kings; the gods of heaven and earth in every place; the numinous spirits of mountains and waters; the officials and elders of villages and domains; and all guardian soldiers and officers. May they all turn in unison this instant, ascending together to the wondrous and sublime.\n\nMay the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of error. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers yield their dragon charts. May the five sacred herbs and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.\n\nMay boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor, and all who rejoice in this act—along with the men and women who observe and listen. May all with karmic affinity partake in supreme blessings, their dark debts repaid across the six paths, their joy bestowed upon the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed. May they don celestial robes and sashes, delight in freedom, and form good affinities forever. May they become companions in the Dharma, never regressing, with the attainment of the Dao as their destined goal.\n\nAs for the altar master who pledged himself, [Name], may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence. May divine perfected ones guard his life, heavenly texts inspire auspicious signs.

They shall encircle the body, entwining the hundred meridians and bone joints, inwardly filling them with immortal *qi*, outwardly sealing off all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that this subject may soon attain flight and transcendence.

The *Ascending Heaven* talisman for concealment is inscribed in yellow on green silk.\n\nSome masters say: Before declaring merit, perform the rites in full.

      "translated_text": "The Most High Primordial Heavenly King, on this day we present the eightfold vows at the auspicious hour, reverently at the Dark Altar—or Mount of the Sacred Peak. We transmit the *Alliance Scripture of the Dark Mystery*, beseeching the Five Divine Mountains of the Emperors to descend and oversee this servant’s oath, that we may swiftly be granted immortality, ascend on flying chariots, and rise to the Imperial Dawn.\n\nHaving completed this, the Dharma Master leans forward, then commands the disciple to enter the central altar through the southeastern earthly gate, facing northwest to bow nine times. When finished, the Master circumambulates left to stand at the earthly gate, while the disciple circumambulates left to stand at the heavenly gate, turning to face southeast. They bow twice, then prostrate facing north with heads to the south.

They circumambulate left, then offer incense to the five directions, beginning in the east and circling back to the west, facing east. The Dharma Master closes his eyes, inwardly visualizing and perceiving the five viscera, five sacred peaks, five stars, and five emperors, all guarding within his body, their radiance covering him as one.

Naturally arising five-colored plain clouds illuminate and shroud their forms, streaming essence and dispersing *qi* to fill the ten directions, encircling heaven and covering earth, encamping and guarding your servant’s body.\n\nOnce all preparations are complete, the Orthodox Unity Ascending Mystery Merit Officers, the Communicating Perfected and Conveying Destiny Flying Celestial Messengers, and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans and Direct Officers, bearing the Tablet of Mysterious Emptiness, stand before your servant. They receive the words from your servant’s mouth, distinguishing and transmitting them to the heavenly officials and earthly spirits of the upper and lower realms, the central and four directions, the eight quarters, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Waterways, the Nine Rivers, the Eight Poles, the famous mountains and great marshes, the true officials of the Five Thearchs, the Four Departments of Surveillance, the Nine Bureaus of Examination and Summoning, the various officials of the Primordial *Qi* of the Mysterious Origin and the *Jiǎzǐ* Calendar, the boundless, infinite, immeasurable, unfathomable, hidden, and manifest hosts of true officials who infuse *qi* into the Celestial Sovereign of *Qián*, the Perfected of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams and Six *Jiǎ* Deities, the lords of the root origin and fundamental beginning of the land, and the generals and officers of the altars and boundaries—all of whom now prepare in solemn array. Together with your servant’s merit officers and messengers, the Flying Dragon and Posting Dragon Cavalry, and the direct talismans and direct officers, they ascend to report before the August Jade Presence of the Supreme Primordial Origin, the Most High Great Dao, the Five Venerable Thearchs, the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao, the Hosts of Sages and Heavenly Worthies, the Celestial Thearchs, the Great Thearchs, the Heavenly Thearchs, and the various officials of the Great Masters of the Mysterious Center.\n\nBy good fortune, through karmic conditions of past lives and the kalpas of the Nine Heavens extending to this present incarnation, your servant has encountered the luminous destiny of this era, when the great Dharma flows freely, and has been permitted, despite this defiled form, to partake in the sacred texts of the Upper Clarity Golden Writ and the Three Caverns’ precious scriptures. Since presumptuously receiving these teachings, your servant has revered the supreme Dharma, yearning in heart for the immortals, yet with shallow sincerity and feeble devotion, unable to move the numinous. Constantly fearing the advent of transgressions and the descent into the Nine Springs, yet through the vast compassion of heaven, your servant’s life has been preserved. It is only fitting to guard these humble capacities and dare not speak further.\n\nNow, as the Three Caverns govern the turning of the cosmic wheel and the Numinous Treasure bestows its teachings below, the prior ranks of those who have been delivered and ascended leave celestial offices vacant, requiring worthy candidates from the middle realm to fill the heavens. From the day your servant received the Dharma, it was ordained to deliver others. Those with predestined names inscribed in the golden registers and jade records, who are destined to attain perfection, traverse the Eight Poles and come from the midst of emptiness and non-being. Now, there is one with a predestined mandate, the Perfected of a certain Marchmount, so-and-so, of such-and-such age, whose conduct is pure and whose bones and destiny align with perfection, having already received the sacred texts of the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Writ. Though their understanding remains shallow and narrow, never having glimpsed the source of the Dao, their faith and devotion have been earnest and long-standing.\n\nToday, they present offerings of golden silks and Dharma tokens, seeking to receive the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerables’ Vermilion Writ of the Jade Chapters, the Golden Writ and Purple Characters of the Jade Texts and Vermilion Scriptures, the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones’ Three Caverns and Eight Effulgences’ Charts of the Divine Immortals’ Mounts, the Inner Sounds of the Various Heavens’ Natural Jade Whip Records of Eight Characters, the divine staffs, and all other matters, the covenant-bound precious scriptures. They pledge their sincerity, making their supplication with the Nine Ancestors as witnesses, vowing to treasure these teachings as their own body and soul, binding themselves to no transgressions or violations.\n\nYour servant, bound by the weight of the Dharma’s prohibitions, dare not lightly disclose these teachings. After thorough verification, their words prove ever more steadfast, and upon examining their sincere heart, it is deemed they may achieve success. Since the Dharma provides for deliverance, your servant dare not obstruct or sever this path. Accordingly, following the *Huanglu Simplified Writs and Numinous Immortal Regulations and Ranks*, your servant has fasted with them for three days, revealing the true texts under the open sky. Heaven is clear, earth is still, the four *qi* are tranquil, with no wind or dust—all in accord with the Dharma and attuned to perfection.\n\nNow, respectfully adhering to the ancient canons of former masters, the essentials of the Illuminating Perfection Great Dharma and Jade Instructions are transmitted to so-and-so’s person, ascending together to the imperial altar. With golden silks to secure the numinous, your servant first reverently presents a scroll of yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the Nine Heavens, placing it upon the jade tablet for inspection and consideration. Next, the memorial is read aloud, and after three rounds of tooth-clicking, it is dispatched.\n\nYour servant now dispatches the five bodily perfected immortals and their mounts, the repeatedly commanded merit officers and messengers, the reporting direct talismans and transmitting scribes, all in solemn attire, crowned and sashed with hanging tassels. They promptly carry your servant’s Dharma-conveying yellow silk and vermilion memorial to the presence of the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs and the Perfected and Greatly Sage Honored Divine Lords. Should any words be inverted or erroneous, or the texts deviate from the ancient Dharma, may they be corrected in accordance with the matter at hand, ensuring perfect alignment above, so that the officials and scribes of the upper realms suffer no reprimand. Should any demonic spirits, malevolent ghosts, or thieves intercept or obstruct the memorial, may they be seized and delivered to the local prisons, punished according to the offense.\n\nMay your servant’s memorial reach its destination above, and may all wishes be fulfilled. Humbly awaiting the gracious response, your servant prostrates in anticipation of the report.",

      "translated_text": "Then the disciple turns left, faces south, while the master turns left to face north, and kneels lengthily. Thirty-six strikes of the drum are sounded. The Most High Numinous Treasure Supreme Cavern Mystery Dharma Master, so-and-so, your servant Yue so-and-so bows twice with head reverently lowered, and respectfully invokes the Celestial Canon Attendants of the Supreme Ultimate, the Jade Scribes of the Scriptural Bureau, the Inspector-Marshal of Ordination, the Four Directors and Five Thearchs, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, who grasp purple-feathered tablets and tenfold numinous banners, leading ten thousand spirits and a thousand perfected ones, with phoenix flutes sounding before them and celestial harmonies played behind, burning incense and scattering flowers as they descend together through the void. Heavenly ranks arrayed, they witness the ordination and the sworn covenant.\n\nYour servant, relying upon the perfected immortals and transcendent officials, the flying dragon couriers, humbly addresses the Most High Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Primordial Origin’s Five Venerable Thearchs, the Numinous Treasure Primordial Honored One, the Ten Directions’ Spontaneously Arisen Perfected, the Four Quarters’ Great Sages, the Golden Watchtower Thearch, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected, the Three Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity, and the host of venerable ones beneath the Jade Towers of the Clear Mystery: your servant, base and foolish, a walking corpse of foul flesh, by accumulated fortune and karmic convergence, has encountered the true scriptures and been granted the honor of receiving the Three Caverns’ precious texts. The Dao is lofty, its principles subtle—far beyond what I can bear. Day and night I tremble in fear, my form and soul never at rest. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, kowtows again and again, prostrate with mortal transgression, prostrate with mortal transgression.\n\nYour servant, unworthy and presumptuous, dares to offer these words. Reverently examining the august scriptures, so profound and weighty, their traces deep and their sources abstruse, they are truly not something a humble servant may presume to expound. Moreover, the luminous statutes and canonical regulations decree that transmission may only occur after five or eight hearings. Your servant has but newly received the Dharma and is unfit to proclaim it openly. Yet as the great kalpa nears its end, the world’s span shortens, fortune and misfortune alternate, and the Dao requires that the loyal and worthy be broadly initiated into the Dharma gate. Though the hearts of people today are shallow and false, truth and deceit difficult to discern, still those who sincerely aspire—though their merit be slight—may be recognized. If they diligently seek and their sincerity reaches, they must not be shut out.\n\nYour servant, having previously presented a memorial above, now respectfully reports that the Perfected of such-and-such an Imperial Realm, so-and-so, is by nature compassionate and kind, his character pure and unsullied, his aspirations lofty, disdaining glory and splendor. He delights in emptiness and savors the true, yearning for immortality and revering the divine. He has followed the teachings of the Great Vehicle’s supreme Dharma, exhorting and guiding others, establishing virtue and merit, devoutly enduring hardship, tirelessly striving, drilling and toiling for years on end, his resolve fixed upon the source of the Dao. Now he presents golden silks and precious tokens, the requisites for receiving the true, swearing before the assembled ministers with his nine ancestors as witnesses, seeking to bear the Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Origin Five Venerable Thearchs’ Vermilion Script of True Writs and Precious Talismans, the twenty-four Perfected Divine Officials and Soldiers of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries, the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, the Eight Might Command Texts, the divine staff, and all other matters as your servant has witnessed.\n\nSo-and-so’s bone nature and resolve are fitting for accomplishment. Reverently following the ancient canons of the Luminous Perfected, a ritual arena is established, covenants are sworn before the Nine Heavens, and the transmission is conferred in accordance with the statutes. Let it be treasured as his personal jewel, never to be betrayed, lightly divulged, or treated with negligence, lest he sever his roots and destroy his lineage, his parents in life and death, and his own person, suffering the trials of the wind-blade and enduring ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. May the Most High Host of Venerables, the Ten Directions’ Sage Perfected, and the Four Directors and Five Thearchs clearly witness this sworn covenant. Respectfully submitted for your august consideration and enactment. Your servant, in utmost trepidation, bows twice with head reverently lowered.\n\nThen the Dharma Master concludes the invocation. Thereupon he rises, and the disciple follows behind the master, offering incense thrice to the Five Directions, beginning in the east. At each direction, he kneels lengthily to present the incense. When the circuit is complete, he paces three times around the altar and scatters flowers in the ten directions. At that time, the Five Perfected Ones’ hymns of praise are chanted in full. The disciple bows twice and intones the benediction.\n\nThe Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One:\nThe Most High Lord of the Great Dao\nRevealed the Numinous Treasure Scriptures.\nSublime and wondrous, beyond compare,\nLike the mystery within mystery.\nThe spontaneous, non-actional Dao—\nThose who study it ascend as high immortals.\nVast is the Cavernous Void Scripture,\nSeated in peace, they attend the heavens.\nAbove, it treasures the Purple Tenuity Terrace,\nBelow, it conceals the famed mountains.\nResplendent with dragon and phoenix patterns,\nIts radiance gleams in the spaceless.\nWondrous is the Most High Dao,\nNon-action, ever spontaneous.\nKings, lords, and common folk—\nAll esteem only the loyal and worthy.\nThose with karmic fortune from past lives,\nOutstanding from former causes,\nMasters transmit it in succession,\nPrecious tokens through kalpas of years.\nBroadly mindful of delivering all,\nGreat fortune repays your person.\nThose who make offerings will attain the Dao,\nThose who uphold it become perfected immortals.\nThe Great Dao has no self or other—\nTransmission must find its proper recipient.\n\nThe Hymn of the First Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nFrom the Cavern Perfected emerge all wonders,\nResplendent, illuminating the Great Clarity.\nThose who uphold it are called immortals,\nTheir bodies eternally enduring.\nCarefree, they sport in the mysterious void,\nPalaces arrayed beyond form.\nLush and radiant, the Seven Treasures Grove,\nLuminous as the sun and moon’s essence.\nDragon scales intertwine in flight,\nPhoenixes soar with mournful cries.\nThe Most High governs the Purple Terrace,\nThe host of perfected chant the Cavern Scripture.\nBurning incense, they bow in reverence,\nCircling the palace city.\nThree circuits return to the high seat,\nThe Dao King responds in kind.\nShould the lord of men magnify the supreme Dao,\nThe world will be universally at peace.\n\nThe Hymn of the Second Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nEmptiness and constancy, ever spontaneous,\nForcibly named the Great Dao.\nVast and boundless, without limit,\nAll wonders return to the Numinous Treasure.\nClosing the eyes, one contemplates the Perfected,\nWith concentrated thought, the Ten Venerables descend.\nAscending as immortals, forever non-active,\nTheir numinous countenances eternally wondrous.\nThirst quenched with jade pool nectar,\nHunger sated with golden radiance herbs.\nSerene wisdom transcends the eight difficulties,\nDelivering the world from all suffering and affliction.\n\nThe Hymn of the Third Perfected of the Most High Mysterious Unity:\nWondrous are the Numinous Treasure Scriptures,\nThe Most High’s spontaneous texts.\nThose who uphold them attain immortality,\nCalled the true Heavenly Honored Ones.\nCharged with proclaiming the Dao’s teachings,\nTruly they surpass worldly talent.\nTheir tasks complete, they ascend as divine immortals,\nTheir palaces govern the Mysterious Terrace.\nAt times they descend Mount Kunlun,\nCarefree, they rest on Penglai.\n\nThe Hymn of the Most High Orthodox Unity Perfected, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Celestial Master:\nThe Numinous Treasure and the Great Cavern—\nThe supreme king of the true Dao scriptures.",

      "translated_text": "Having completed this, the disciple draws *qi* and swallows it five times, then ceases. Next, after inserting the talisman, he seals both hollow ends of the staff with red wax, impressing the upper end with the seal of the Primordial Beginning and the lower with the seals of the Five Elders. Done, the disciple strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the five *Direct Talisman Officials of the Emperors*, each clad in robes matching their directional hue, their five-colored radiance streaming and blazing upon the staff; and the five *Jade Maidens of the Emperors*, one for each, together guarding the staff on left and right. The disciple then holds the staff horizontally as before. The master invokes:\n\n\"Mountain of the Great Yang,\nPrimordial Essence on high,\nopening heaven and unfurling earth,\nsweet bamboo channeling the numinous.\nDirect Talisman Guardians,\nmarshaling divine soldiers,\nfive hues streaming and blazing,\ncrimson fire and golden bells,\nassisting the perfected on high,\nemerging from darkness and entering shadow.\nSummoning the heavens, the heavens bow,\ncommanding the earth, the earth welcomes.\nPointing at ghosts, ghosts perish,\ndemons of heresy bound in form.\nNuminous talisman, divine staff,\ncommanding all spirits with awe,\ngoverning all directions,\nliving with me as one.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas,\nreplacing my form,\nits splendor the Five Liberations,\nspirit ascending to the Upper Clarity.\nReceiving the talisman and proclaiming the decree,\nnone dare disobey.\"\n\nDone, he draws the *qi* of the five directions and swallows it twenty-five times, then ceases.\n\nNext, the master proclaims the *Cinnabar Water Text*:\n\n\"Great Cavern Master of Such-and-Such Peak, your servant So-and-So, addresses his disciples So-and-So and others: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the vast and boundless, unfolded and expounded the true scriptures, weaving them into wondrous sutras. Kalpa after kalpa, salvation knows no end, like grains of sand or countless billions without cease. The numinous scriptures, profound and recondite, were hidden within the Golden Pavilion, revered by the assembled perfected, looked up to by all heavens. In the era of the Red Bird, they were bestowed upon the Immortal Duke, and thus the *Numinous Treasure Wondrous Sutra* emerged to deliver humanity.\n\nI, by humble karmic affinity, have encountered these numinous scriptures. My late master, in manifesting their splendor, transmitted this supreme Dharma, which I vow to treasure as my own body—how dare I divulge it recklessly? Yet as kalpas turn and destiny shifts, the Dharma’s time has come to spread. To those who align with the true, I transmit it according to the rites.\n\nToday, I swear before the Nine Heavens to bestow these scriptures upon So-and-So. After receiving them, you must adhere to the luminous precepts: purify yourself, discipline your body, cultivate sincerity and diligence, sever worldly ties, and aspire solely to the Great Vehicle. Make offerings, perform rites, study the profound mysteries, seek guidance from the enlightened, practice *daoyin* and refine your essence. Observe fasts, regulate your attire, and yearn for transcendence. Honor the Dao and revere your master, upholding the root with devotion. Do not feign reverence with hollow words, nor attack the very foundation of your being with reckless deeds. Do not slight the sacred scriptures, nor indulge in superficial piety, lust, greed, jealousy, or hatred. Do not harbor deceit in your heart or conceal malice within. Should you violate these vows even once, your body will sink into the Three Springs.\n\nYou, So-and-So, along with your three progenitors and five ancestors, shall together descend into the earthly prisons, lost for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. Today, I establish the Yellow Altar, ally with the Five Emperors, and transmit the *Ten Sections of Treasured Scriptures* and the wondrous sutras. All heavens and the Five Peaks bear witness to this covenant. Examine your conduct, guard the Dharma, and hold it within your heart. Ascension to immortality may then be expected, and you shall ultimately attain the true Dao. Strive with solemnity, as prescribed in the *Bright Statutes of the Four Poles*.\"\n\nNext, the disciple proclaims his own covenant:\n\n\"Disciple So-and-So of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, Village, and Peak, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Most High Lord of the Dao, the Venerable Deities of the Ten Directions, and the perfected who have attained the true Dao in all quarters.\n\nThe thirty-six sacred scriptures and talismans of the *Most High Numinous Treasure*, the supreme Dharma of the Great Master of the Lofty Mystery So-and-So, by karmic fortune and past blessings, have endured through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, unceasing and undying. Blessed by destiny and transformed by the wheel of rebirth, I was born into the Dharma’s gate. From an early age, I vowed to admire the supreme lineage, the great vehicle of the Dharma’s board, my spirit leaping with joy, dreading only the decay of this mortal frame.\n\nNow, as heavenly destiny shifts and the imperial Dao’s number unfolds, I have been graciously uplifted by Master So-and-So, who enlightened my ignorance and bestowed upon me the numinous scriptures, allowing me to stand before the sagely lord. My flesh trembles with awe; I have cleansed my filth and impurities to attend the numinous altar, humbly receiving this exalted favor, a glory beyond my due.\n\nI vow to discipline myself, purify my body, make offerings and pay reverence, cast aside worldly burdens, and entrust my aspirations to the hidden peaks. Forever forsaking the paths of the world, I dedicate myself solely to the mountains and cliffs. Day and night, I shall prostrate in worship, striving to exhaust my humble devotion, hoping that through the sacred scriptures, my decaying frame may be delivered. With utmost sincerity and single-mindedness, I shall harbor no second thoughts. I dare not violate this covenant or betray my oath, nor deceive my master or slight the Dao, nor feign devotion with hollow words, nor fail to uphold the kalpas’ trust.\n\nI, having gathered my transgressions and swallowed my shame, now dare to speak, invoking my seven generations of parents and ninefold ancestors as witnesses to this vow, and all living kin of my nine clans as guarantors of this covenant. I delight in the immortal’s path and shall never be constrained by time. Should I violate this even for a day, may my life and death alike sink into the earthly prisons and the Five Paths, without hope of reprieve.\n\nAbove, I appeal to the Primordial Beginning; below, I swear before the Five Emperors. Facing the master’s treasure, I establish this covenant. With cinnabar sincerity and utmost devotion, I humbly beg for your compassionate acceptance.\"\n\nThe disciple, prostrate, bows twice with reverence.\n\nNext, the master rises and faces north, holding the two copies of the true scriptures in his left hand. The disciple kneels, holding the token of faith in his right hand. The master strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the five viscera, complete and perfectly forming a canopy of cloudlike brocade, covering the scriptures and himself. He then invokes:\n\n\"Celestial writ, unburdened and free,\nthe Dao and its power self-sufficient.\nCultivate it, and immortality is certain—\nwhat more could one desire?\nIts radiance shines in the Great Void,\nbrilliant and resplendent.\nTransmit and receive all according to the Dharma;\nleak or slight it, and fall into hell.\"\n\nNext, the disciple kneels, performs nine bows, rising and prostrating three times, then receives the true scriptures. Girding his sash and grasping his staff, he bows once to each of the ten directions, beginning in the north and circling eastward to complete the circuit. He visualizes the Most High’s true form, resembling the Heavenly Worthy’s image.\n\nDone, the master rises and paces in a circuit, chanting the *Step of the Void*:\n\n\"Prostrating, I bow to the Most High,\nburning incense to return to the Void.\nLuminous radiance follows me in turn,\nthe Dharma’s wheel likewise circles thrice.\"",

May the mouths of the precious pearl today, though countless in number, ascend upon the precious pearl, attain fellowship with the exalted, together cross the Tiger Gorge and arrive as one, together traverse Dragon Mountain and reach its summit, and realize the four fruits of attainment.

May the faithful sons of heaven’s protection and the guarded daughters of the Dharma attain their ends. May the women’s fruits be inscribed on purple tablets, the men’s names harmonize with the jade registers. May they vie in immortality with the Red Earl, attain the Dao and compete in liberation with the Mountain Charts.

May the Three Refuges be universally embraced, the Four Teachings universally come. May imprisonment and distress be forever averted, karmic bonds eternally severed. May calamities and afflictions not arise, decline and suffering not be born.\n\nFor all other wishes, may each be carved as desired: those who seek office attain office, those who seek nobility attain nobility, those who seek the Dao attain the Dao, those who seek the Perfected attain the Perfected. May all aspirations be fulfilled, all desires realized. May the Dao be perfected in heaven and earth, merit deliver living beings. May it extend to all the celestial bodies of the heavens—sun, moon, and stars—the mountains and rivers, the dragon kings, bird kings, beast kings, insect kings, spirit kings of the myriad things, and all heavenly kings. In every place, whether heavenly spirits or earthly deities, mountain and water numina, local officials and guardians, all the soldiers and functionaries of the various defenses, may they all turn at once and together ascend to wondrous victory.\n\nWe pray that the Seven Origins be peacefully traversed, the Four Symbols free of transgression. May heaven display auspicious omens, earth reveal numinous portents. May mountains open their treasure tablets, rivers bring forth dragon charts. May the five magic mushrooms and green grasses spread across the countryside. May the four directions be purified, the world know great peace.\n\nMay boundless merit extend to the overseeing officials, those who labor and rejoice in the work, and all men and women who observe and listen. May all those of karmic affinity together enjoy supreme blessings, their dark resources reaching the six paths, their blessings extending to the four kinds of birth. May the five sufferings and three evils, all sentient beings with consciousness, be cleansed and bathed, crowned with heavenly robes, attaining joy and ease, forever forming good affinities, eternally companions of the Dharma, never again retreating, with the attainment of the Dao as their appointed time.\n\nAs for the altar master who pledges himself, so-and-so: may the five scriptures enter his body, the jade talismans nurture his essence, divine perfected guard his life, heavenly writings inspire auspicious signs.

      "translated_text": "Having concluded the covenant rites, the celestial and terrestrial spirits invoked are now respectfully dismissed to return to the Nine Heavens, proceeding in due order. From the Purple Mansion’s Jade Pavilion, through the wondrous gate and golden portal, the Jade Void True Qi’s Merit Officers and the divine steeds of the immortals enter my body, encircling and suffusing every vessel, bone, and joint. Within, they fill me with immortal qi; without, they sever all sources of evil, refining the soul and preserving essence, that I may soon attain flight and ascension. The feathered steeds of the immortals ascend directly to the Imperial Throne. Swallow the Twenty-Four Qi and halt.\n\nNext, the Dharma Master returns to the incense burner and intones:\n\"Incense Officers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense altar, that I may attain the Dao and swiftly achieve transcendence. May disciples So-and-so and all within their households, both inner and outer, receive blessings. May the ten directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, conveying my supplications directly to the Jade Emperor’s celestial throne.\"\n\nNext, recite the *Precepts Hymn*:\nThe Dao is the heartless origin,\nAll acts are fields of merit.\nOne cessation—no fixed measure of merit,\nEach vow springs from the self.\nEmpty the self to respond to all beings,\nFocus the mind without partiality.\nThe Great Sage exalts the true teaching,\nAs rain descends from heaven.\nLofty and boundless, none untouched,\nYet humility forms the abyss.\nThe sea is king of a hundred rivers,\nFor it can forsake even the dragon’s scales.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, wisdom endures—\nNot merely for this lifetime.\nUphold the precepts without lapse,\nAnd life after life, good karma binds.\nWith concentrated thought, contemplate the Great Vehicle,\nAnd you shall embody the Dao’s truth.\n\nRecite the *Returning Precepts Hymn*:\nThe Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion,\nExpounds the precepts to deliver all beings.\nVirtue and power pervade the hidden and manifest,\nKarmic retribution summons the true spirits.\nThe devas bow in reverence,\nWhile demonic hordes restrain their forms.\nThe past transcends the Eight Difficulties,\nThe present secures a thousand years.\nWhen the merit of the fast is complete,\nTogether we send forth our devotion.\nThe flowing Sanskrit and soaring clouds chant,\nFragrant smoke mingles with incense’s perfume.\nJade phoenixes ride crimson chariots,\nGolden dragons draw emerald carriages.\nIn life and death, all find joy,\nFamilies and nations attain peace.\n\nUpon completion, master and disciples circumambulate the altar, chanting Sanskrit hymns, and conclude the rites. Alternatively, they may return to the incense burner and perform the *Ascending Heaven and Treading Earth* rites upon the august altar. Then, master and disciples chant Sanskrit hymns as they exit through the northwest gate of the Nine Heavens—without looking back.\n\nThe *Treading Earth* and *Dissolving Form* talismans are inscribed in blue on white silk; the *Ascending Heaven* and *Concealment* talismans are written in yellow on green silk. Some masters say: before declaring merit, perform these rites to completion, then lead the disciple to face north and bow four times to the Jade Throne of the Supreme Lord. Next, face east and bow twice to the Great Emperor Lord. Then, face south and bow twice to the Most High Perfected. Afterward, face west and bow twice to Master Zhang, the Heavenly Master. On the third day, the disciple declares merit, holds a fast to give thanks, and the rites are recorded in a separate scroll.\n\nNext, the disciple performs the *Lance-Tablet Casting* rite in the direction of their life’s origin at the altar. Facing east, they knock their teeth together three times, offer incense, and pray:\n\"Most High Three Heavens, Primordial Three Qi, Supreme Lord Lao: summon forth the Three and Five Merit Officers within my body, the Left and Right Attendant Officers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Dragon Couriers, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens who attend the incense, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Daily Incense Officers—thirty-six of each—to emerge. I now burn incense and invoke the local earth deities and the true officials of the four directions. May the Supreme Lord’s ten-directional true qi enter my body, that my supplications ascend directly to the throne of the Most High, Perfect, and Great Sage, the Celestial Worthy and Jade Emperor.\"\n\nUpon finishing, they turn to face the king and knock their teeth together twelve times. After reading the tablet, they pray:\n\"Heaven unfolds, earth extends,\nThe Nine Qi divide their numinous power.\nThe Three Origins share a single talisman,\nThe ten directions are mystically pure.\nThe Five Elder Thearchs,\nOpen the true and guide the living.\nCinnabar script and vermilion texts,\nPrimordial essence of the Highest Origin—\nUniversally proclaimed to the supreme,\nThe august spirits of the Nine Lands.\nToday is most auspicious,\nAll immortals confirm life.\nI vow for my immortal self,\nTo cast my jade name.\nThe Earth Mansion’s Great August One,\nErase my sinful form.\nSubmit the tablet to the Upper Palace,\nInscribe it in the Azure Register.\nSwiftly attain flight and ascension,\nHeaven and earth share their numinous power.\nNine generations of kin,\nRotten bones renewed in glory.\nSouls ascend to the Southern Palace,\nTransformed in the immortal courts.\nToday I declare my mandate—\nMay all spirits heed!\nWith golden clasps I affirm\nMy utmost sincerity.\nAs I have petitioned, so let it be—\nBy golden dragon courier.\"\n\nUpon completion, they offer incense and return to the incense burner, following the above method.\n\nThe *Highest Origin Numinous Treasure* addresses the Nine Earths’ Earth August Ones, the *Extinguishing Sins and Inscribing Names to Seek Immortality* method:\nThe *Numinous Treasure* and *Vermilion Thearch* female Daoist adept, So-and-so, aged such-and-such, born in such-and-such month, life registered under the Southern Dipper of the Nine Heavens.\nExplanation: This text refers to the Vermilion Thearch as one whose life origin is in the *bing-wu* (fire-horse) year, and whose life is registered under the Nine Heavens if born in the first or second month.
