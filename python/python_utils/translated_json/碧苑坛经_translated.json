  "full_translation": "**The Blue Park Altar Sutra**\n*Expounded by Wang Changyue, Kunyangzi, the Seventh Generation Successor of the Dragon Gate Lineage in the Complete Perfection Tradition of the Great Qing Recluse*\n*Compiled by Shi Shouping, Disciple of the Precepts of the Eighth Generation*\n*Revised by Min Yide, Eleventh Generation Descendant*\n\n**Volume One**\n\n**I. The True Words of the Mind-Dharma**\n\nIn the second year of the Kangxi reign, the cyclical year *guimao*, on an auspicious day in the tenth month, Kunyangzi expounded the precepts at the Blue Park in Jinling. Addressing Ningzhenzi Shao Shoushan and Fuyaozi Zhan Shouchun, he said:\n\n\"From my youth, I aspired to the Dao, seeing through the illusory nature of fleeting life and the impermanence of phantom realms. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the supreme Way. Yet though Mount Kongtong lies near, Guangchengzi does not deign to meet; though Penglai is not distant, how can a mortal body ever reach it? One must resolutely distance oneself from defilement, sweep away all dust, purify the heart’s chamber, and cleanse the mind’s intent. Grind away ingrained habits until worldly thoughts turn to ash; sift the desiring self until delusive roots are severed.\n\nAll conditions suddenly cease, each step taken within the discipline of precepts and stillness. Myriad thoughts return to emptiness, each layer perceived through wisdom’s gaze. What is grasped can be stabilized; what is seen through can be endured. Thus, one raises the brows, wielding the blade that severs emotion; one strides forth, boarding the boat that ferries across the world. Turn the body, and liberation from rebirth is attained; shift the thought, and transcendence from the net is achieved.\n\nCompassion does not fade—so the ancients said, ‘Liberate yourself to liberate others.’ Benevolent vows endure—I resolve to liberate myself to liberate others.\"\n\n\"I recall my early years seeking truth and visiting the Dao, once journeying to Wangwu Mountain, where I encountered an enlightened master. Above, I received the boundless grace of the Three Treasures and heard the Dharma’s sacred teachings; below, I relied on my own strength, enduring austerities to cultivate the body. I took refuge in the supreme Dharma King, practicing the wondrous Mahayana Way. Now, in this flourishing age of peace and tranquility—a rarity across ten thousand kalpas, a sight unseen in a thousand lifetimes—how dare I not propagate the Three Treasures and repay the Four Graces? Though my offering is but a drop in the ocean, I humbly present the clarity of my heart.\"\n\n“Thus, undeterred by my own presumption and transgressions, I open the altar to expound the precepts; undaunted by scorn and slander, I expound the teachings and discourse on the scriptures. This is not for the sake of seeking fame through good deeds, but solely to dispel delusion and resolve confusion. Heaven’s law brooks no ornate speech; the supreme Dao resides only in forthright words. With reverence, I convey the seventh-generation tradition of the Dragon Gate lineage to this assembly. Humbly recording the unvarnished words from the Emerald Garden, I seek to universally benefit beings of heaven and earth. I dare not indulge in empty rhetoric—why not speak plainly? Today, I transmit this to you, precisely to guide the benighted and illumined and to elucidate the true Dharma.”\n\n“As for those of superior capacity—perspicacious and noble individuals—this poor Daoist, standing in humble admiration, earnestly invites your compassionate instruction to verify what I have heard. This is my deepest aspiration.”\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, the disciple bowed and withdrew, standing in orderly ranks to the east and west. Then, the disciple Shi Shouping of Guangling prostrated himself and intoned:\n\n“The Dharma is originally no-Dharma, for the mind gives rise to it;\nThe mind is fundamentally no-mind, for the Dharma is empty.\nThe mind manifests the Dharma King, the mind manifests forms;\nThe Dharma returns to the mind’s lord, the Dharma returns to emptiness.\nTo clarify that the fixed Dharma is not the perfect sign,\nOne must awaken to the truth that the ordinary mind is the sagely mind.\nMind-Dharma, Dharma-mind, mind-Dharma-Dharma,\nThe mind-Dharma’s liberation—this is the true understanding.”\n\nII. Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures\n\nThe Three Treasures are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. The Dao is fundamentally empty, formless and nameless; without the scriptures, it cannot be made manifest. The Dao resides within the scriptures, profound and subtle; without a master, its principles cannot be grasped. Those who fail to take refuge in the Three Treasures will inevitably sink into heterodox paths, lost in confusion and delusion. All who cultivate the truth and study the Dao, and who wholeheartedly take refuge, must regard this as a rare and precious encounter.\n\nFirst, take refuge in the supreme Dao-Treasure, vowing that all beings may eternally attend the Heavenly Worthy and forever escape the cycle of rebirth.\nSecond, take refuge in the supreme Scripture-Treasure, vowing that all beings may, life after life, hear the true Dharma.\nThird, take refuge in the supreme Master-Treasure, vowing that all beings may study the supreme vehicle and avoid falling into heterodox views.\n\nThese Three Refuges are the first step on the ascending path by which the sages and worthies of old guided people into the Dao, the first gateway to entering virtue. All who attain immortality, the Dao, sagehood, or worthiness begin here, with the Three Refuges. Why is this so? For the matters of nature and destiny, life and death, are of grave karmic significance—subtle, secret, and seldom witnessed. Without a true master’s compassionate guidance to awaken the spiritual faculty, how could one suddenly awaken to the Mahayana’s true essence, gradually enter the wondrous Dao of emptiness, and avoid falling into heterodox views or straying into side doors?\n\nThus, those who have yet to understand the Dao first take refuge in the scriptures. Those who have yet to understand the scriptures first take refuge in the master. If one can take refuge in the Master-Treasure, then the Scripture-Treasure may be heard amid what was once unheard. If one can hear the Scripture-Treasure, then the Dao-Treasure may be seen amid what was once unseen. What was once invisible and inaudible suddenly becomes thoroughly clear—all through the power of taking refuge in the Master-Treasure. Naturally, one comprehends the true texts, gains insight into the correct Dharma, transcends life and death, and avoids the cycle of rebirth.\n\nHowever, the Three Refuges of which I speak must be the true Three Treasures. Why is this so? Great assembly!”\n\nNowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere routine—morning and evening, one bows before sacred images and recites the words, yet never truly penetrates the essence of refuge, nor understands its purpose. Thus, one remains mired in deluded teachings and cannot escape the cycle of rebirth. How then can one comprehend the Great Dao and transcend life and death?\n\n*(Xie’s note: The above two passages concern principle and practice.)*\n\nWhen we speak of taking refuge in the Three Treasures:\nTo take refuge in *intent* is to render thoughts free from arising and ceasing—thus may the Dao-Treasure be understood.\nTo take refuge in the *mind* is to render its mechanism free from obstruction—thus may the Scripture-Treasure be awakened to.\nTo take refuge in the *body* is to render the eyes without sight, the ears without hearing, the nose without scent, the tongue without taste, the hands without reckless movement, the feet without reckless wandering; to avoid defilement by lust and craft, to practice austerities in person, to toil with sinew and bone, to starve the flesh, to weary the limbs, to abandon the form—thus may the Master-Treasure be moved to respond.\n\n*(Xie’s note: This taking refuge in the Three Treasures of intent, mind, and body constitutes the actual method of practice. In the initial stages of internal alchemy, refuge in intent gives rise to the true essence; refuge in the mind manifests the true fire; refuge in the body stills the form and solidifies the essence, generating true water. The first step in internal alchemy hinges on the clarity of the water’s source, and its clarity depends on two key factors: first, the body’s stillness ensures water’s purity, while its restlessness renders it turbid; second, the clarity of fire determines the clarity of water—when fire is impure, water is likewise muddied. Thus, refuge in the body and mind naturally facilitates the foundation-laying process, and when all Three Treasures are embraced in refuge, the practice advances layer by layer.)*\n\nOnly when one moves the compassion of the master to transmit the scriptures and impart the Dao must one first take refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intent as the true Three Treasures. If my own ears and eyes cannot forget their perceptions—if I am not deluded by form, then I am attached to emptiness—then the senses and their objects still persist, and the body is not true. How can the untrue move the master to respond?\n\nShould one maintain the body’s uprightness, cultivate the root through practice, and align the intent with the true and constant, then thought after thought dissolves into emptiness, and profound tranquility ensues—this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures. *(Xie’s note: Taking refuge in the Three Treasures is none other than the supreme celestial immortal’s practice, namely, “uprighting the body, emptying the heart, and making thoughts real.” From beginning to end, it is no more than this—how direct and unobstructed! Though the practice has no discrete stages, it naturally advances layer by layer. Master Kunyang, in his compassion for later learners, has revealed the immortal’s mechanism in this scripture. Yet how可惜 that people today pass over it in haste, failing to perceive the meaning beyond the words, and instead treat this book as a mere manual of precepts and repentance.)*\n\nWhen the body refrains from deviant desire, the master’s treasure may be moved to respond;\nwhen the heart does not obscure its numinosity, the scripture’s treasure may be awakened to;\nwhen the intent is undivided, the Dao’s treasure may be illuminated. *(Xie’s note: “Undivided intent” means utmost sincerity without cease. See *The Heart Transmission of Celestial Immortals* and *Annotations on the Rain and Fragrance Heavenly Scripture and Mantras.*)*\n\nWhen the body is firm, essence is preserved and the form is robust;\nwhen the heart is numinous, qi is clear and wisdom flows;\nwhen the intent is sincere, spirit congeals and nature manifests.\nOnce essence and qi are abundant, spirit and wisdom transform—profound and unfathomable mysteries all arise from taking refuge in one’s own body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures. Thus do the Dao, the scriptures, and the master emerge from them.\n\nNow, let us speak of the method for taking refuge in the body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures.\nDisciples! Each of you must listen with focused mind, for I shall now explain the method of taking refuge in the body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures, that you may shatter darkness and dispel doubt.\n\nDisciples! This body is formed from the father’s essence and mother’s blood, coalescing into shape within the womb—temperament, nature, countenance, and limbs all grown therein. A mass of filth, a sack of the four elements, eyes seeing, ears hearing, feet moving, hands swaying, mouth speaking, tongue tasting—none of this is enduring or inherently good. Those who use it well become immortals, buddhas, sages, or worthies; those who misuse it become demons, monsters, ghosts, or beasts. A single upward turn, and heaven may be ascended; a single downward turn, and hell may be reached. Those who receive blessings treat it as an external thing; those who receive misfortune take it as their foundation.\n\nHow much more so for you, disciples, who have left the household life to transcend birth and death? You must take refuge in this body—only then is it secure. Otherwise, the six senses turn outward, the three poisons arise within, and the ten thousand calamities, thousand disasters, nine demons, and ten hardships all stem from the body. How then can one cultivate and enter the Dao?\n\nIf you wish to take refuge, there is but one method to subdue this body: you must uphold the precepts and restrain the unruly frame. Let the four great deportments—walking, standing, sitting, lying—be your foundation, governing all with dignity and composure. Let the ears not hear sounds, the eyes not see forms; adorn yourself with a majestic and wondrous appearance, upright and compassionate, so that others rejoice at the sight and feel reverence. When the precepts harness the wild body, transforming it into a dharma-body, then refuge in the master’s treasure is achieved.\n\nDisciples! This first method having been made clear, you must next take refuge in the heart.\nDisciples! This heart differs from this body.\n\nPerils and strange transformations defy all measure—like wind stirring the sea, its waters deep and boundless, the gale’s force surging fierce, waves and tides churning in tumult, rising and falling beyond prediction, shifting and turning without reliance. Through kalpas uncounted, there has been no day of emergence, for the sea of suffering knows no shore.\n\nIf you now seek refuge in this heart, you must first recognize it as a mass of blood and flesh, no enduring or inherently good thing. It feasts on sounds and delights in forms, heedless of transgressing laws or incurring punishment; it craves sweet tastes, reckless of forfeiting life. It sinks into the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts without fear, submits to knife mountains and charcoal fires without dread; it drifts through pestilence and plague without refusal, conjures stars to fall and mountains to crumble without avoidance. All manner of calamitous causes arise from this heart’s beckoning. The six thieves lead the vanguard, the seven emotions command the host.\n\nIf you seek cultivation yet do not first take refuge in this heart, how can you subdue demons and tame apparitions, dispel the seven hindrances and expel evil, penetrate the primordial mechanism, attain the true Dharma, delve deeply into the宗旨, and ascend directly to the supreme vehicle? Yet to restrain this heart, you must abide by the precepts, enter samādhi with a tranquil mind, rein in the steed and wield the whip, turn back the wind and extinguish the flames. When the fire of ignorance blazes in this heart, quell it with the water of forbearance. Transform raging flames into the wind of wisdom, transmute ignorance into great insight. Shift evil causes into good fruits, dissolve sorrow and resentment into joy. Sweep sounds and forms away as floating dust, turn indolence into reverence. Let no delusion arise, no right and wrong be distinguished, no conflict between departure and stay, no oscillation between high and low, no shifting of gain and loss, no whirling or agitation. Naturally, qi settles and the heart is at peace; the heart at peace, qi settles—then refuge in the sutra-treasure is achieved.\n\nDisciples! Having subdued the wild heart of blood and flesh with the power of samādhi, the waves grow still, the wind calms, the moon rises over a tranquil sea, the pearl radiates its light, wisdom penetrates the sutra’s depths, and insight grasps its meaning. You must next take refuge in this intent.\n\nThis intent is even harder to restrain than the heart. The heart seeks rectitude, while intent lies in sincerity. Sincerity means meticulous care. In samādhi, within stillness, all is vividly clear, not a single hair’s breadth concealed, undivided and unceasing, movement and stillness as one, light shining universally. Thus, until you take refuge in intent, you must guard against the heart’s quietude. It may stealthily seize control, its mechanisms shifting and deceitful; its illusions branching and divergent, now appearing, now vanishing. It devises myriad paths, flickering between existence and nonexistence; its waves craft countless guises, like dragon or tiger. It cannot be grasped, now shadow, now wind; though you may clutch at it, no form is visible. A trigger’s release unleashes a thousand jun, yet no sound is heard; a single drop steers a ten-thousand-hu vessel, scheming ten thousand calculations. Its spiritual powers defy measure—stealing the sun and swapping the sky—its stratagems boundless.\n\nOnce you take refuge in intent, it dissolves like water, crumbles like tiles, and all things return to spring. You may enter sagehood and attain the real, ascend as an immortal and realize the Dao. In the world, you transform and guide; the nation is governed, the people at peace, the times harmonious, the years abundant. Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness; modesty, purity, chastity, and clarity—all arise from sincere intent. The three bonds and five constants emerge from it; the nine schools and three teachings are born of it. Between sincerity and insincerity lie fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing, good and ill, prosperity and adversity—all hinge on this intent. It is the cause of life and destiny, the retribution of saṃsāra.\n\nDisciples! Without refuge in this intent, this heart will never find peace. If you seek peace, take refuge in this intent. The light of wisdom will naturally shine brightly, and enlightenment will clarify all things. Before this thought stirs, it is serene and limpid. The moment it arises, it becomes either perverse or upright. Do not obscure the radiant light; the mechanism turns on its pivot, stars follow the Dipper’s course. When intent is sincere, you may wield the power of life and death. When intent is insincere, who holds the handle of saṃsāra?\n\nDisciples! Within your own heart lies the treasure of intent. A single thought of true purity can reach the heavens above and move the netherworld below. Ghosts and spirits pale before it; sun and moon dim by its power. Creation loses its authority, yin and yang their constancy. Demons and monsters flee its presence; beings and things vanish by its decree. Within the three realms, intent reigns supreme. Release it, and it exists; withdraw it, and it vanishes. Free and unobstructed, all is intent. Above, it ascends to the primordial as the ancestral qi; at the center, it returns to the numinous treasure as the brahma-qi; below, it abides in the Most High as the true qi. Extending broadly, it becomes the vast qi; coalescing gently, it forms the original qi. Compassionate and benevolent, it is the yang qi; sorrowful and wrathful, it is the yin qi. Greed, anger, and restlessness are the qi of blood; lust, killing, theft, and delusion are the qi of evil. Attachment and obstruction are the qi of demons; cruelty and darkness are the qi of monsters. Oppression and resentment are the qi of grievance—all these arise from you, disciples.\n\nIf the body does not take refuge in the master’s treasure, it leans toward violence and strength. If the heart does not take refuge in the sutra-treasure, it is often deluded and benighted. If intent does not take refuge in the Dao-treasure, it is entangled in chaos and confusion. Deviation from sincerity is to lose the center; losing the center, the light of wisdom does not arise, samādhi is not firm, the precepts are not strict, spirit does not congeal, qi does not gather, essence does not transform. Thus, the body cannot be cultivated, the heart cannot be stilled, and intent cannot be sincere.\n\nDisciples! I now reveal the great Dao, pointing directly to the human heart. If you do not swiftly subdue body, heart, and intent, transforming them into the true body of the Three Treasures, and liberate yourself from saṃsāra, then—one by one—take refuge in the world’s awakened teachers, those who first realized the sutras and the Dao. Do not squander this fine karmic opportunity of leaving the household life.\n\nIf there are those who, relying on the three great Dharma gates of precepts, samādhi, and wisdom, practice with unwavering faith, never wavering or retreating, know that such a person will surely attain the Dao.\n\nIf even the slightest deviation occurs, and one cannot adhere steadfastly, becoming lax in one’s own practice, know that such a person bears deep transgressions and meager blessings, unable to perceive the Dao. Heavenly spirits will not tolerate them—how then could they hear the supreme, most true, and pure liberating Dao? Should you encounter such individuals, take care not to reproach them in anger. Instead, cultivate compassion, employ gentle persuasion, and skillfully guide them onto the Way—this is what it means to take refuge in the Three Treasures.\n\nThereupon, the precept-disciples bowed their heads in reverence, took refuge, and recited a gatha:\n\nThe great Dao is clear and void, beyond all naming,\nIts subtle wonders revealed through scripture’s text.\nWere it not for the master’s exposition of the primal truth,\nHow could the muddled and deluded ever awaken?\n\nClearly, continuously—this is called Perfection of Truth,\nAttaining the true origin, transcending life and death.\nThe first to know, the first to awaken, with earnest compassion,\nEndless worthies guide others through the gate.\n\n### The Threefold Repentance of Transgressions\n\nDisciples! Having taken refuge in the Three Treasures, you must diligently cultivate wondrous practices. The Most High has said: *\"Misfortune and blessing have no fixed gate; they are summoned only by oneself. The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow.\"* Thus, heaven and earth possess spirits that oversee transgressions, diminishing a person’s allotted years in accordance with the severity of their offenses. Even minor faults number in the hundreds—those who seek long life must first avoid them.\n\nTransgressions refer to faults and errors. Nowadays, those who cultivate the Way deceive their own innate knowing, betray their original nature, seeing only the faults of others while remaining blind to their own. This very blindness to one’s own faults means that transgressions run deep and karmic obstructions grow heavy. How can one who deceives heart and self ever enter the Dao? Therefore, repentance is essential.\n\nRepentance means reverently facing the sacred and true, daring not conceal past wrongs, solemnly vowing never to repeat former misdeeds—only then can one advance. I shall now, without fear of giving offense, clearly expose the ways of deceiving heart and self in this world. Disciples, listen closely, and you will understand.\n\nWhat, then, are the deeds of deceiving heart and self?\n\nOutwardly, one speaks in lofty, expansive terms, while inwardly coveting wealth and goods;\nExternally, one maintains appearances, while internally scheming with cunning;\nReceiving precepts yet failing to uphold them, urging others while fearing no blame;\nOutwardly a Daoist, secretly consorting with the unprincipled;\nWords spoken in the same hall go unheeded, yet in public affairs, one constantly justifies wrongdoing;\nHearing the Dao yet not practicing it, knowing the Dharma yet willfully violating it;\nUsing cleverness to deceive the foolish, seizing advantages as a foothold;\nHabitually stirring ignorance, often acting stubbornly;\nTaking non-being for being, being for non-being;\nTreating the false as true, the true as false;\nCalling a deer a horse, selling dogs as sheep;\nCommitting wrongs in secret, playing tricks in broad daylight;\nPlotting in the heart, hiding daggers behind smiles.\n\nSuch perverse conduct, each act turning away from the Dao—yet none of it is unknown to oneself. Those who remain unaware are fools, the deluded, the confused, the reckless. But those who knowingly commit such acts are what the ancients called the treacherous, the wicked, the perverse, the base. Is this not deceiving heart and self? Their transgressions far exceed those of the foolish and deluded.\n\nWhy? The foolish, lacking wisdom, act in ignorance and error, harming only themselves. If they harm others, they will ultimately be harmed in return. But the treacherous and wicked, cunning and deceitful, not only harm others for personal gain but also deceive themselves to conceal their true hearts. They strive to ensure that heaven and earth remain unaware of their schemes, that ghosts and spirits remain ignorant of their evil. They weave intricate deceptions, ever concealing their actions; they plot in secret, ever patching over their misdeeds. They set snares for others, yet none perceive where the trap was laid; they push others into pits, yet none discern who dug them. Such people exist in abundance in the world—yet they are utterly unfit for cultivation.\n\nBefore taking refuge in the Three Jewels, if one harbored such a heart, now that one has received the precepts, one must transform and reform, swiftly seeking repentance. In recent times, the primordial wind has waned, the precepts have grown lax, the Dao’s transformation has declined, and the yellow-crowned have lost their teachings. Repeatedly receiving instruction from the feathered and flowing, many violate the rules and breach the precepts. I now spare no earnest words to admonish and exhort, offering counsel to all.\n\nNot only should one repent for the karmic offenses of eons adrift, for the karmic burdens of parents across many lives, and for the transgressions of one’s present parents, nine ancestors, and seven generations. Even the karmic offenses of one’s own past must be swiftly swept clean in the depths of the heart. All unrighteous deluded thoughts, every trace of wayward念, must be repented for their former wrongs, and past errors must be regretted—only then can one attain the fruits of the Dao. Otherwise, it is like covering one’s ears to steal a bell; how can one achieve liberation? The Great Dao remains distant!\n\nI now compose a repentance text for all to recite morning and evening.\n\n**Repentance and Vow Text**\n\nWe, the assembly of disciples, since receiving the precepts until now, have merely indulged in the empty name of precepts, failing to uphold them in truth. Our robes and crowns are falsely worn, and the rules and alms-bowl are but hollow traditions. We have neither advanced in the initial truth nor avoided falling into the depths of transgression. Lacking wisdom in our hearts, we have not earnestly sought guidance from enlightened masters; our nature, stirred by ignorance, has struggled to endure humiliation among our peers. Our minds are narrow, unable to embrace others with compassion; our perceptions are biased and crooked, leading us to commit many offenses. Unaware of true awakening, we mistake illusion for reality; failing to examine causes, we take thieves for sons. We regard the virtuous as outcasts, confusing right and wrong; we mistake noble ones for petty men, unable to discern truth from falsehood. Some have misled donors in matters of cause and effect, pocketing offerings for private gain; others have chanted scriptures with mispronounced words, their minds entirely heedless. Some, upon seeing beauty, stir lustful roots in their hearts; others, upon hearing sacred words, harbor doubts within. Such manifold misdeeds have forever bound us to the mundane.\n\nIf we do not renew ourselves from this day forth, as dusk approaches and the path narrows, we shall inevitably sink like stones to the ocean’s depths. Should we persist in recklessness, only when the bell tolls and the water clock runs dry will we realize the horrors of sword trees and knife mountains.\n\nTherefore, with this offering of the incense of the heart, the lamp of the heart, and the water of the heart, we exhaust the sincerity of taking refuge in body, mind, and life. Moment by moment, we gaze toward the crimson heavens, beseeching deliverance; morning and night, we look up to the golden palace, offering our devotion. With the utmost reverence of fasting and purification, we spare no toil in our efforts. Turning ourselves around, we bow again and again to the compassion of our teachers. We set forth offerings and implore the heavens for forgiveness!\n\nHenceforth, we shall utterly eradicate all evils and forever become persons of goodness. From this day forward, we shall rouse ourselves to serve the True and strictly uphold the primal precepts. Should we transgress these laws again, in life we shall suffer heavenly retribution, and in death we shall fall into Fengdu. If we violate the statutes of former days, in this world we shall endure the harshest punishments, and in the next we shall be buried in the Avīci hell.\n\nYet we pray that after this repentance, our sins may be extinguished and blessings arise, calamities dissolve and misfortunes be released. May the ice melt upon the ground of awakening, and the moon of enlightenment shine forth in radiance. May the darkened chamber regain its light, and the sun of wisdom illuminate the blackest night. May the sprouts of goodness grow, and sweet dew drip upon withered branches. May the primordial cord be restored through benevolence, and the rain of Dharma abundantly revive all that is parched.\n\nThus may our transgressions be erased from the black ledger, and our names inscribed upon the azure tablets. Through diligent cultivation of great samādhi, may our true bodies be firmly preserved. May the eight consciousnesses be purified, and the hundred obstacles and thousand demons disperse like clouds. May the three lives be fully illuminated, and the nine clouds bear our seven generations of ancestors to the rosy dawn. May the divine wind spread afar, and the myriad qi flow across the ford.\n\nMay the ancestral teachings be perpetuated without end, and the lineage’s streams flow back to the seat of the patriarchs. In action and repose, may fortune attend us, and the storms of the outer world be stilled. In seclusion or prominence, may peace prevail, and the sun and moon within the pot of stillness shine serenely.\n\nWe further pray that masters and disciples, fellow students, family and kin, all beings upon the earth, and every devotee under heaven—may each one’s mind-ground be opened and their nature-sky brightly illumined. May the times be harmonious and the winds gentle, the nation prosperous and the people at peace. May weapons be laid down and warfare cease, water and fire be balanced and harmonious. May the imperial domain stand firm, and the emperor’s reign flourish afar. May the sage-king enjoy boundless longevity, and his ministers be wise and virtuous. May all the people unite in sincerity, and every land delight in the Way.\n\nTogether with all sentient beings, may we return to purity and stillness.\n\nWe humbly beseech the sacred compassion to graciously extend its deliverance!\n\nThe above text of repentance and vows should be recited with reverence morning and evening. One must align one’s own dharmakāya with the Heavenly Emperor, offering sincere devotion with every thought and harboring shame in every heart. Each sentence should be recited with clarity, each word uttered with remorse and hesitation, advancing with courage and diligence. Whether in life or death, hardship or hunger, all must be relinquished. Only by upholding the precepts and cultivating samādhi can one secure a future path.\n\n*Jade Garden Altar Sutra, Volume One: Four Obstacles to Remove*\n\nFor the practitioner, if obstacles are not severed, one remains obstructed and deluded; if hindrances are not eliminated, one remains foolish and benighted. The essence of the mind is originally as bright as the sun and sky, yet delusive thoughts are but floating clouds. When mist veils the azure heavens, how can the sun shine brightly? When emotions obscure the spiritual apertures, how can the true mechanism attain perfect clarity? Is this not the greatest affliction of the practitioner?\n\nI now point out the root of this affliction: Daoist teachings speak of two kinds of obstacles—one called *obstacles of principle* (理障), the other *obstacles of phenomena* (事障). Without clarity in phenomena, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished; without clarity in principle, right and wrong cannot be discerned. If one clings to principle while discussing phenomena, rigid and pedantic, this becomes an obstacle of principle to the mind. If one acts in ways that violate principle, perverse and wayward, this becomes a thief to one’s nature, an obstacle of phenomena. Whether in principle or phenomena, any attachment whatsoever constitutes an obstacle.\n\nNow, let us examine these two obstacles in detail.\n\nDisciples, the myriad scriptures and classics are all teachings left by those of prior awakening, guiding later generations to perform good deeds, cultivate virtue, awaken to the Dao, and refine the true. Yet sentient beings, instead of doing good, commit evil; instead of learning virtue, they learn wickedness; instead of refining the true, they engage in falsehood; instead of awakening to the Dao, they corrupt the teachings. This is called the *obstacle of phenomena* to the original mind.\n\nThere are also those who have left the household life, performing good deeds yet clinging to goodness, learning virtue yet clinging to virtue, refining the true yet taking it as real, awakening to the Dao yet becoming attached to forms and traces. All this stems from an inability to relinquish attachment to what is good—this is called the *obstacle of principle* to the original mind.\n\nYet even those with these two obstacles—of principle and phenomena—are still among the advanced practitioners. There is another class of practitioners whose minds remain unenlightened, whose celestial mechanisms have not turned. Everywhere they go, they generate obstacles. When they see advanced practitioners expounding scriptures and explaining precepts, they outwardly praise them but inwardly stir ignorance, harboring obstructive thoughts and igniting delusive impulses.\n\nDisciples, if this obstructive mind is not eradicated, how can one escape the sea of suffering? Though the boat and raft, sail and oar are clearly available to cross the sea, one cannot, dares not, cross—what is the reason? Know this: this obstructive mind is like a sudden surge of dark clouds, spreading and billowing, foretelling wind and rain, inevitably bringing perilous waves and treacherous tides. Thus, one dares not, cannot, cross.\n\nDisciples, the sea of suffering is boundless; turning back is the shore. The obstacles of the practitioner are like darkness rising on all sides, shrouding the sky in deception. Only when they are severed does the sea grow calm and the wind still, allowing one to cross in peace and ease, safely escaping the sea of suffering.\n\nHave you not heard what is said in the *Highest Emperor’s Original Deeds Collection Sutra*? “It is only because sentient beings’ obstacles are heavy that they cannot behold the compassionate countenance of the Celestial Emperor.” It further states: “All such obstacles—each of you must sever them.” Thus, the *Emperor’s Sutra* begins by expounding the severing of obstacles.\n\nThe method to sever obstacles is to generate great wisdom: do not give rise to doubt, greed, anger, lust, jealousy, killing, mundane thoughts, ordinary reflections, dullness, defilement, sound and form, right and wrong, love and hatred, discrimination, arrogance, or attachment. Concentrate the spirit and settle the mind; regulate the myriad spirits. Let the heart be as vast as the great void, inwardly and outwardly pure. Embrace all without rejection, contain all without exclusion. Do not allow external deviance to disturb the supreme Dao, leading one astray from the true source, corrupting the spiritual root, and stealing the supreme treasure. Otherwise, one will forever sink into the mundane stream, entangled in worldly nets, assailed by ten thousand demons. For hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one will not hear the wondrous Dharma, and spirits will seize and punish, leading one from life to death.\n\nTherefore, each of you should resolve with sincerity to guard the true source and not allow it to be lost. As previously stated, sever all obstacles—these are the clauses of obstruction. If they are not severed, the six senses will be defiled, the three karmas entangled, and purity will not be attained. Without purity, how can one behold the compassionate countenance of the Celestial Emperor? How can the seventeen great lights and thirty kinds of virtue be attained? It is through the light and virtue of the Celestial Emperor that all buddhas, sagely masters, and lords of the ten thousand heavens are manifested. The wondrous scriptures of the three volumes and five ranks all arise from the severing of obstacles.\n\nDisciples, the obstacles in the world are manifold. The *Emperor’s Sutra* merely points out the main events and practices to give you a general understanding and clarify the gateway to heavenly principle. You must understand that the subtle obstacles in the world are as numerous as ten thousand threads and a thousand strands—every thought and movement is too many to enumerate.\n\nFor example, when reading scriptures and reciting classics, the profound and subtle meanings within may surpass one’s limited wisdom, making them difficult to comprehend. This reveals that one’s spiritual apertures are not yet awakened and the light of wisdom is dim. If one is unwilling to humble oneself and inquire of the wise, this is dullness and defilement. Even after receiving clarification, doubt may arise, fearing the other’s words are not true. One may ask another, only to receive conflicting answers, leading to vexation. With countless paths and myriad scriptures, is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, when studying scriptures with companions, if another is more familiar while one is still learning, and impatience arises—is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, if one is more familiar while a companion is still learning, and joy arises—is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, if one possesses talent while another is dull-witted, and deceit arises—is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, upon seeing another’s goodness—whether in almsgiving or meritorious deeds—if they are wealthy while one is poor, envy arises; if one is wealthy while they are lacking, arrogance takes root. Is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, when reading scriptures, should sudden comprehension dawn and the subtleties of principle become faintly clear, and one clings to this as truth, expounding it to others—yet if another is more enlightened and one’s heart refuses to yield, is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, when hearing profound principles, should one fixate upon them in the mind, knowing only one aspect and failing to adapt, is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, in the practice of seated meditation, should a moment of subtlety arise and one boast of it, is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, when fellow Dao-seekers gather to receive the master’s teachings, should the master praise another’s clarity while one’s own remains dim, and instead of self-reproach, one envies the other’s precedence, is this not an obstacle?\n\nAs for hoarding wealth and possessions, clinging to even a single coin at death’s door—all attachments, whether to love, habits, or indulgences, left unsevered and unremoved—such as fondness for the lute, books, chess, or paintings, and all manner of fixations, are obstacles.\n\nOr, there are those who regard talismanic arts as wondrous spiritual powers; others dismiss them as inferior, contrived practices. If they delight while one disdains, or one favors while they despise—all such divisions are obstacles.\n\nDisciples, since you seek liberation from the world and wish to escape the cycle of rebirth, you must cultivate the work of transcendence and embrace the Dao of liberation. These obstacles are but veils that clog the gates of spirit, demonic mists that obscure the nature of awakening—how then can you transcend the world?\n\nIf you are willing to sever each of these tangled obstructions, cutting away their roots entirely, dispelling distracting thoughts, and allowing the breast to become as vast and boundless as the great void, then the heart will flow freely, turning with perfect clarity, and wisdom will arise of itself. The celestial nature will shine resplendent, and within it, the myriad wondrous functions—all the mechanisms of life and death, coming and going, the unity of heaven and humanity—will unfold naturally, beyond the reach of mere knowledge to grasp!\n\nAh!\n\nObstacles, obstacles! It all lies in whether the assembly can sever them or not. Thereupon, the preceptor of the Vinaya expounded the Dharma, saying:\n\n\"From the very beginning of the descent of the celestial mandate, the luminous decree has never been empty. It shines upon the terrace of the spirit, where not even the finest wisp can be concealed. Once the breast is suddenly swept clean and vast, the eye’s vision instantly becomes clear.\"\n\nFor those who have renounced the five houses and severed the bonds of affection—O assembly!—you have already understood the harm of obstacles. Yet the harm of affectionate bonds is even more dire than that of obstacles. How so? The mind of obstruction arises only when encountering circumstances; once the circumstance passes, it vanishes—its harm comes and goes in an instant. But as for the two words *affectionate bonds*, they are the karmic roots planted from beginningless kalpas down to this present life. Thus, sages, immortals, and buddhas have all exhorted sentient beings: do not cling to appearances, do not become entangled, do not indulge in attachment. The scriptures of the Three Teachings all urge later generations of the world: do not be ensnared by affectionate bonds. These bonds are the progenitor of all demons, the root of all harm. Repeated kalpas of delusion, countless lifetimes of downfall—all stem from affectionate bonds. The failure to attain the Way of liberation, the failure to comprehend the principle of true emptiness—all stem from affectionate bonds. In life, one violates the laws of the state; in death, one sinks into hell—all stem from affectionate bonds. Drowning in floods, perishing in fires, slaughter by bandits, death by the sword—all stem from affectionate bonds. The ruin of clans and the extinction of heirs, the breaking of precepts and the violation of rules—all stem from affectionate bonds. Nine generations suffering calamity, the decline of ancestral sacrifices—all stem from affectionate bonds. Birth, aging, sickness, death; the perversity of nature and mind; the frailty of the body; the stagnation of the Dao and its methods—all stem from affectionate bonds. The six senses defiled, the six thieves rampant, the six consciousnesses discriminating, the six paths of rebirth—all stem from affectionate bonds. Within heaven and earth, amid the five phases, the birth and withering of the myriad things, the arising and ceasing of the ten thousand kinds—all stem from affectionate bonds.\n\nIf you wish to leave the world, to transcend birth and death, yet do not seek to sever these bonds, to renounce affection and abandon attachment, and still hope to attain perfect clarity, immaculate purity, liberation, and freedom—such a thing has never existed. Let me first speak of the affectionate bonds of the laity in this world: those between ruler and minister, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, friends. The ancient sages have already spoken of the five *haves*, the five *stops*, and the five *perversions*, as well as the gradations of *emotions all attuned to moderation*, *cherishing kin and honoring the worthy*. All these are but the natural endowments within this spark of numinous awareness, by which they are ordered, regulated, and cultivated, each fulfilling its nature and destiny. Thus, the cosmos is preserved in perfect harmony. Within this undifferentiated primordial qi, there is no need to further renounce affectionate bonds—it is the pure, spontaneous, tranquil, and liberated Way, which we shall discuss at length another time.\n\nNow, I speak only of those who have left the household life—today’s assembly of benefactors here in this garden—who should also pare away all extraneous affectionate bonds. For all that is properly within your sphere and yet lovable, you must refrain from loving it. As if these bonds were already exhausted, examine each one clearly and restrain them in the past. O assembly! You remain utterly deluded by affectionate bonds. How so? That which the human mind swiftly and gladly seizes upon is called *affectionate bonds*: all things, great and small, refined and coarse; all people, kin and strangers, near and far...\n\nAll matters of internal and external, right and wrong, true and false; all teachings of the Three Teachings—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism—of sages and worthies; all principles within scriptures, texts, documents, and literary works; all marvels of heaven and earth, yin and yang, creation and transformation; all arts of the wondrous and the illusory; all paths of the Pure and Subtle, Numinous Treasure, and Perfect Realization. Even sacred mountains and grotto-heavens, celestial palaces and divine realms; even the Seven Treasures and Eight Rarities, the River Chart and tortoise omens. And one’s own body and mind, the five viscera and six bowels, teeth and tongue, essence and qi; mountains and rivers, the great earth, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, insects and worms—whatever the thought grasps with desire, whatever the mind dwells upon, whatever the heart imagines, whatever the spirit and qi fix upon, whatever the emotions cling to, whatever the nature delights in, whatever the mouth craves, whatever the body enjoys, whatever the dreams wander toward—all are bonds of affection. If even a single thought lingers, one is ensnared and cannot attain the pure, tranquil, and liberated Way, forever remaining a deluded and suffering being.\n\nO assembly! When deluded, affectionate bonds arise; when awakened, affectionate bonds vanish. You must be ever vigilant, moment by moment bearing witness. If even the slightest attachment to any beloved thing arises in the heart, you must sever it at once, allowing no further conditions to take root. If you love sleep, sit instead; if you love sitting, walk instead. If you love dwelling in stillness, let the spirit and mind become lively; if you love emptiness, let the numinous nature become void. With not a thread of attachment, no bonds arise. The awakened one’s heart radiates light, unshaken by circumstances, unmoved by things, undisturbed by affairs. Over time, the wondrous and boundless opens, and the primordial aperture is unsealed.\n\nIf today you do not eliminate them, if tomorrow you do not sever them, if you relinquish them yet fail to cut them off, you remain entangled as before. Then your monastic robe and alms bowl, your meditation cushion, become nets; your straw sandals and bamboo staff, become ropes; sacred mountains and divine realms, become prisons; fellow disciples and companions, become enemies. Even sacred incantations and true words turn into arsenic and poison; the Dao-heart and original nature transform into karmic rewards and asura realms. How can one not be cautious? How can one not grieve? How can one not bear to sever and cut them off?\n\nOnce there was a Daoist who, after long meditation, experienced a vision. He saw a radiance emanating from the crown of his head, resplendent with five colors, like clouds or brocade. Within that light, mountains and rivers, the great earth, and all things were visible. The Daoist rejoiced in his heart, believing he had attained the Great Unobstructed Light of the Supreme Emperor. Day and night, he sat upright, contemplating the light, but it never reappeared. Failing to recognize the vision as an illusion, he fixated on it, forgetting all other thoughts, thinking only of the light. As he persisted in this contemplation, he grew dull and witless, his body like earth or wood. Others believed he had entered the supreme Way.\n\nAfter six years of such sitting and concentration, his spirit congealed and his form altered, yet he remained unaware. One day, his breath grew coarse and labored. His companions kept watch, awaiting his emergence from stillness to seek the Way. Among them, only one practitioner recognized his possession by delusion. At midnight, the meditator suddenly flung his hands outward as if taking flight. The others lit lamps and candles, offering incense and flowers in reverence. Then his breath ceased, and from his mouth flew a moth, drawn to the flame, where it perished. The practitioner retrieved it and addressed the assembly: “This is the body of the Daoist who fixated on the light. His bond of affection for the light made him no different from this moth. When conditions ripened, his form transformed and entered another realm. If affectionate bonds are not severed, all meet the same fate. How lamentable! How imperative to cut them off!”\n\nO assembly! Where the heart harbors attachment, there is bondage. Bonds arise from affection, and affection follows bonds; bonds and affection entwine endlessly. Fathers become sons, ancestors become descendants, men become women; faces change, forms shift, names alter, yet deluded beings mistake these for reality. How terrifying! How pitiable!\n\nO assembly, take heed. The Six Precepts must be observed with utmost rigor.\n\nThe practitioner who seeks the Way, having already severed affection and cast off karmic bonds, sincerely pursues liberation from the world to end the cycle of birth and death. Yet if the bonds of affection are not extinguished and desires arise anew, this heart remains entangled, once more ensnared in the net of delusion and the pitfall of suffering—thus never attaining liberation. One must devise a strategy of vigilance *before* the first signs appear. Otherwise, all prior efforts will be in vain, and future demonic obstacles will be inescapable. Therefore, follow the example of the ancient sages and worthies: gather the heart within the precepts.\n\nThis word *precepts* is the vajra that subdues demons, capable of suppressing evil and malevolence; it is the talisman that protects life, capable of increasing blessings and prolonging longevity; it is the ladder to ascension, capable of paying homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood; it is the lamp that illuminates the path, capable of dissolving the Six Desires and dispelling darkness and ignorance; it is the immortal’s boat and precious raft, capable of ferrying sentient beings across the sea of suffering; it is the compassionate bridge and ford, capable of delivering sentient beings from the river of affection. Truly, it is the safeguard of the cultivator and the guiding principle for advancing on the Dao.\n\nThere is no separate gate for immortals and sages—all enter through the precepts. The path of sages and worthies begins with precept-observance. It is indeed the broad thoroughfare of the immortals and perfected, the central gate and proper path of the wise and virtuous.\n\nO assembly! Having planted the karmic causes in past lives, you now hear the Dharma of the precepts in this life—this is the greatest of fortunes. Yet if you do not uphold the precepts with discipline, rigor, and diligent effort, this greatest of fortunes will transform into the greatest of transgressions.\n\nThese precepts are the celestial prohibitions of the Yuandu Heaven, the rules and regulations established by the Most High Lord of the Numinous Treasure of Primordial Beginning. The Heavenly Court of Lady Green supervises them constantly, divine soldiers guard them, and heavenly generals patrol them. Those who honor and uphold them receive merit inscribed in the cinnabar ledgers; those who violate or defy them have their transgressions recorded in the black books.\n\nA single thread does not escape, a hair’s breadth does not err.\n\nNow, those who receive the precepts are, in truth, the ignorant. What is meant by ignorance? Simply that they have not understood the principle. If one understood this principle, one would naturally uphold the precepts with rigor and never transgress. To violate the precepts—is this not ignorance?\n\nTherefore, all in this assembly who have already received the precepts must earnestly investigate this word “precept.” What is a precept? A precept is a prohibition—what does it prohibit? And why did you receive it in the first place? If you came for the Dharma of the precepts, you should uphold them day by day. If you do not uphold them day by day, why receive them at all? Such a mindset shows you did not come for the precepts, but rather for the empty reputation of being a Daoist monk, seeking only the robe and alms-bowl. Otherwise, why would you not observe the pure regulations?\n\nI must remind you: since the Seven Perfected Ones propagated the teachings, the Dao has declined. The precepts and their dignified observances have not been manifest in the world for four hundred years. This is because no one within the teaching has arisen to bear the responsibility. Thus, the celestial lamp that illuminates the Way has not been trimmed, leaving those who cultivate in darkness and difficulty. The staff that supports the body has been cast aside, and its handle lost. No wonder heterodox teachings and deviant sects have spread throughout the world, while the pure, liberated, upright, and luminous Dao has fallen silent and unheard.\n\nNow, by good fortune, the Dao’s destiny is in motion, and we meet this flourishing age. Above, the Emperor’s blessings bring peace to the realm; below, many officials and ministers are faithful patrons who protect the teaching.\n\nMoreover, there are benefactors who offer alms—robes, crowns, and alms bowls—all prepared and ready. Such opportunities are rare in a thousand lifetimes, seldom encountered across ages. This is the karmic affinity you have met in this life. Having received the precepts, you must now carefully seek to understand the meaning of *jie* (precepts). What is meant by *jie*?\n\nAlas, those who receive the precepts vary in wisdom. The foolish may begin with good intentions, but after ordination, they obscure their initial resolve, unable to uphold the precepts. How lamentable—this original aspiration is abandoned, and the precept robe and crown are cast into the vast ocean. Some pawn or sell them, others refashion them into ordinary clothes or patch them into sleeves. They profane the celestial spirits and defile the sacred precincts. The pure alms bowl is repurposed as an incense burner, a vessel for money or rice. They break fasts, violate precepts, drink wine, consume meat—nothing is beyond them. Their wisdom is extinguished, and their immortal root severed.\n\nThere are living examples, clear and undeniable. Once, a precept-disciple violated his vows, defiled the precept scriptures, sold his robe, and discarded his bowl. He suddenly died and was seized by ghostly constables, bound in chains. Arriving at the underworld, he saw a majestic tribunal, its gates flanked by rows of ghostly soldiers, shackling many—all former companions who had broken precepts in life. Startled, he asked, *\"Why are you here?\"* They replied, *\"We do not know why, but one by one, we all ended up here.\"*\n\nAbove the gate hung a plaque inscribed with three characters: *Kao Dui Si* (Bureau of Examination and Verification). He asked a ghostly guard, *\"What is the Bureau of Examination and Verification?\"* The guard replied, *\"This is a newly established celestial ordinance. There are two judicial bureaus, specially tasked with overseeing the precepts of monks and Daoists. When someone in the world resolves to receive precepts, the local earth deity records their name. The date of ordination, days of merit, days of transgression, violations of precepts, betrayal of the Dao or teachers, defilement of scriptures, sale of robes, desecration of bowls, slander of precept masters, exploitation of benefactors, greed, lust—all are meticulously documented and reported monthly for examination. You must first pass through this bureau before proceeding to other tribunals. Those who receive precepts but cultivate virtue with unwavering devotion may avoid the underworld. But for those like you—who take precepts in name only—you will inevitably be summoned here for examination before your allotted lifespan ends. Without passing this bureau, no other tribunal will issue a warrant for your death.\"*\n\nThis precept-disciple revived after half a day and night, recounting this case. Listen well: when you criticize others’ faults, you are sharp and discerning, yet when it comes to your own, you remain blind. Day by day, month by month, you indulge yourself, accumulating boundless transgressions while concealing them—this is called deceiving the heart.\n\nThose who have received precepts must examine their daily actions and words, reflecting day and night. Do good, correct evil, and never justify or excuse yourself. If you err and fail to recognize it, immediately repent before the sacred immortals, weeping in remorse. Study the precept scriptures diligently, seek enlightened teachers, and pursue profound learning. Honor your teachers as parents, your fellow disciples as elder brothers, delight in the Dao as a wife, and cherish the scriptures as jade.\n\nHold the precepts in your heart as you would an object in your hand—once released, it is lost; once the precepts are abandoned, they are broken. The laws of the world punish transgressors with imprisonment; the celestial ordinances of the Dao, the statutes of Nüqing, mete out karmic retribution. Do not assume the underworld is unseen—life and death reside in your heart. Do not think the precept spirits are hidden—your every thought is known.\n\nThe four characters *jie xing jing yan* (precept conduct, pure and strict) mean: subduing the heart to align with the Dao is *jie*; patience and perseverance in practice is *xing*; untainted by even a thread is *jing*; unviolated by even a hair’s breadth is *yan*. Unchanging from beginning to end is *upholding precepts*; unwavering through hardship is *guarding precepts*.\n\nYet among you who have received precepts, how many remember even the Ten Precepts? This is precept-holding in name only—why bother? But if there is even one word of the Dharma, let it give all of you the resolve to practice sincerely.\n\nThe celestial sovereign above governs all with a heart that cherishes life, vast in compassion and mercy, delivering and liberating sentient beings. Should any precept-holder transgress, yet from that moment repent and reform, revealing a sincere heart, once more upholding the regulations with utmost strictness and purity, never daring to violate them again—if such earnest remorse and confession are offered, the heart of Heaven will naturally take pity, pardoning and restoring them to their original state.\n\nNow I shall relate to you all another tale of karmic cause and effect: one who transgresses the precepts yet later upholds them. A certain precept-holder once said that after receiving the precepts, he suddenly encountered demonic tribulations, breaking his fast and violating the precepts, committing every manner of misdeed. One night, he dreamed he arrived at the underworld court to witness the proceedings. There, he saw many ghostly clerks lighting gauze lanterns and setting up incense tables. After a short while, King Yama emerged from the main gate with the same majestic bearing as an earthly emperor. He heard an official report: “The celestial envoy has arrived. Quickly prepare the incense table to receive the decree,” no different from how earthly officials receive imperial edicts. The envoy was a celestial officer, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-colored cloud crane cloak, and holding a yellow scroll, which he presented before entering—none of the ghosts were permitted to follow. The dreaming Daoist also wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted: “What wandering spirit are you, daring to approach this solemn hall?” Another ghost said: “He seems dressed like a Daoist.” The first ghost replied: “The recent decree ordered that those who cultivate and uphold the precepts, upon the end of their lives, may enter in full attire. Those with radiant light enter through the main gate; those with lesser light, the east gate; those without light have their Daoist names stricken, bound in shackles at the western side gate, and await trial by roster. You, Daoist, have no radiance—only a mass of black qi, no different from us. Impersonating a Daoist, be off at once!” With that, he brandished an iron rod. The precept-holder awoke in alarm, remembering it all vividly.\n\nThe precept-holder immediately rose from his bed, hastily washed his face, took up pure fire to burn incense, and was filled with dread. Grieving and repentant, he vowed to reform his past transgressions and strictly uphold the precepts.\n\nOne day, he dreamed again of wandering through the underworld, returning to the same place as before. The ghostly guards wielding iron rods and shackles ran toward him, asking: “Where does the immortal master wish to go?” The precept-holder replied: “I was merely passing through and dared not disturb the King. I shall depart at once.” The ghost said: “The King has a rule: all immortal masters of radiant virtue who pass by must first enter the tea hall, take a seat, and have their names recorded for verification.” The precept-holder answered: “I have no official business; I shall not trouble you.” As he turned to leave, he suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he recounted the dream to the assembly.\n\nIn his first journey, he was beaten and scolded by ghosts; in the second, they knelt to receive him and inquired after his name. The difference in treatment arose from the state of his own heart—had he not repented of his past faults, he would have remained as before. Behold the Dao of the spirits: the principles of the unseen and the visible are one. How can one not stand in awe?\n\nBrethren, time passes swiftly; let your nature be luminous. Do not wait until impermanence arrives, forcing you to wander in the dark underworld, where ox-headed guards offer no kindness and horse-faced demons show no mercy. If you have faults, correct them swiftly; all depends on the purity of your precepts. Among the myriad methods and thousand gates of cultivation, refining the mind is the supreme vehicle. In the boundless sea without shore, follow the precepts and let wisdom’s light guide you.\n\n**Seven: Enduring Humiliation to Subdue the Mind**\nThe foremost affliction of cultivators, the most difficult to remove and rectify, is the character for *wrath*. Whether clinging to the illusion of self or the illusion of others, the moment wrath arises, it is called the *fire of ignorance*—the foremost of the three poisons.\n\nIf wrath is not dissolved, it burns oneself within; if wrathful words are spoken, they burn others without. A single spark of this fire scorches the numinous gateway, reducing the Dharma-body to ashes. The six viscera cannot remain pure, the five organs cannot stay at peace. When the ear hears another’s insult, wrathful fire arises from the liver, and like wild flames meeting a gale, the ear’s faculty of hearing suddenly becomes as if sealed shut. When the eye sees another’s disrespect, wrathful fire arises from the kidneys, and like wild flames meeting a gale, the eye’s faculty of sight becomes as if veiled and obstructed. Before one realizes it, wrathful words spill from the mouth, while in the heart, the fire of resentment surges forth, and from the gallbladder, schemes of malice arise.\n\nAbove, one fears neither the gods of heaven and earth; in the middle, one fears neither life nor death; in the unseen, one fears neither cauldrons of boiling oil nor forests of swords; in the worldly, one fears neither beheading, hanging, nor exile. Yet with a single tongue, one forges a thousand kinds of karmic transgressions. Why do the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the tongue suffer such torment? It is because this heart of flesh cannot be subdued, relying on a mere breath of qi to wield power and authority. Yet when the moment of reflection comes, it turns as cold and insipid as ice.\n\nBrethren, all beings in the world are formed of blood and qi, and this root of wrath has been planted since beginningless kalpas. Thus, when matters align with the heart, joy arises; when they do not, that joy turns to enmity. When circumstances oppose the heart, wrath is born—this is the root of endless rebirth.\n\nYou have left the household life to escape the web of birth and death, yet if the root of wrath remains unsevered, the poisonous dragon will assail the celestial root. You seek liberation from the world because the burden of life and destiny is heavy; if wrath is not extinguished, qi will fill the lunar cavern. The nature is fundamentally good, but wrath transforms it into a poisonous dragon. Habitual wrathful fire burns the body; life is inherently eternal, but wrath turns it into a ferocious tiger. Constantly generating toxic qi, one loses one’s true essence in haste. Ignorance of birth and death stems from failing to treasure one’s nature and life; the failure to establish nature and life stems from the strength of fire. As a result, the six senses cannot be gathered, the four limbs tremble in vain, the five senses cannot function, and the pores scatter the fiery nature of qi, bringing harm in a hundred ways and shortening one’s heavenly allotted lifespan.\n\nBrethren, to eradicate wrath, first subdue evil thoughts. What are evil thoughts? The inability to endure humiliation. The great sage Confucius said: *“Teach with gentleness and forbearance; do not retaliate against the unprincipled.”* If the mind cannot endure for a single day, one remains an evil person for that day. How can an evil person enter the Dao?\n\nBrethren, those who cannot endure humiliation have hearts that cannot be subdued, like poisonous dragons and ferocious tigers—only knowing how to humiliate others, never tolerating humiliation themselves. They seek dominance and victory, seizing joy before others, wielding power and authority, speaking harshly and sternly; they play the hero, act the gallant; they seize profit and fame, boast of merit and power, bully the weak with force, and scorn the aged. Though they may sometimes act with warm hearts for the sake of others, they do not realize that while they may save lives, they may also take them.\n\nBeings are deluded and do not awaken; when have they ever considered the long term or pondered deeply? Heaven’s Dao is distant, and grudges remain unresolved—all because the root of wrath is not severed. Wrath inevitably seeks to humiliate others, unwilling to endure humiliation oneself. Yet there is a vast difference between being humiliated by others and humiliating others.\n\nBrethren, the concept of *humiliation* encompasses much. For instance, if one seduces another’s wife or concubine, one disregards the humiliation of her husband, children, grandchildren, ancestors, and clan. Yet if another seduces one’s own wife or concubine, wrath arises, and great evil follows. One thinks: *If this person seduces my wife or concubine, where is my dignity? If others hear of it, not only am I shamed, but the merits of my parents and ancestors, the reputation of my descendants, and the prestige of my clan will all be defiled and ruined. How can I let this pass?*\n\nThen one grasps a knife or brandishes a staff, kindling wrath and suddenly harboring murderous intent, never reflecting: *He humiliates me, so I act thus—yet I have never humiliated him; why does he do this?*\n\nIf one’s wife or daughter is violated in this life, there must be a wicked cause from a former existence. In a past life, one violated another’s wife or daughter—thus in this life, one’s own wife or daughter is violated. This is the inevitable cause and effect among men.\n\nAll of you, having heard these words, must never arouse the mind of lust. I speak plainly to the assembly: the lives of all these people arise from lust. If the mind of lust is not eradicated, the root of birth and death remains unsevered. Through lust, the physical form comes into being; to transcend the physical form, one must wash away desire. When desire is extinguished, within this perishable body, the Dharma-body is born, and only then can one escape the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThese are our true words—do not treat them as idle talk and let them pass. Recently, there was a lay disciple, a man of profound devotion in his daily practice, who one day went forth to solicit alms and provisions. Passing by a rice shop, he held out his alms bowl.\n\nThe shopkeeper, moved by devotion, welcomed the precept-observer with joy, inviting him into the central hall to sit. He bowed, offered alms, and placed a coin of broken silver into the alms bowl. As the precept-observer was leaving the hall, he suddenly encountered the shopkeeper’s wife passing beneath the veranda. She could not avoid him in time, and after exchanging glances, he expressed his gratitude for the alms and departed.\n\nThat night, as he sat in meditation, his thoughts drifted to the woman, picturing her face. He rose at once, knelt before the incense, repented, and then lay down. Suddenly, he became aware of his own death, his soul entering a womb. He grew to adulthood, took a wife—her beauty striking, their marriage harmonious. One day, while walking along the road, he saw a Daoist monk begging for alms. His heart filled with joy. He invited the monk home, offered alms, and performed good deeds. Calling his wife to meet the monk, he knelt and bowed. Then, turning to the monk, he beckoned his wife with his hand. Instantly, fury surged within him. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a vegetable knife, and charged to slay the monk. But he stumbled, fell, and awoke—his heart seething with rage. It had all been a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the monk’s face, he recognized it as the shopkeeper who had offered alms; his wife in the dream was the woman he had passed beneath the veranda.\n\nDisciples, this precept-observer, though firm in his discipline, was still a beginner in his practice. His meditative concentration was not yet steadfast. Thus, his daytime sight and nighttime thoughts gave rise to delusion. The depth of his false念 plunged him into a dream, shaping its realm.\n\nAnother practitioner, unwavering in his precepts, had never spoken an idle word nor allowed his mind to wander. Though humiliated, he harbored no resentment; though struck, he did not retaliate; though cursed, he made no reply. He reflected only on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, while carrying a load on the road, he encountered a donkey rushing toward him. He stepped aside to let it pass, but the donkey suddenly butted him, knocking him to the ground. The beast then bit his clothes, tearing them, before running off.\n\nThat night, as the practitioner sat in meditation, entering a state of hazy absorption, a figure in white appeared and bowed in gratitude, saying, *\"I am the donkey that collided with you on the road. In a past life, we were bound by enmity, but now the grievance is resolved, and we are both freed. I have escaped suffering and will be reborn among humans. I have come to tell you: on a certain day next month, seek me at a certain place to aid in my deliverance.\"* With that, the figure vanished.\n\nThe practitioner saw and heard all clearly—it was neither dream nor waking. He rose and resumed his meditation as usual. When the appointed day arrived, he went to the designated place, where a family seemed overjoyed, as if celebrating a joyous occasion. Asking neighbors, he learned that a child had been born in that house the previous night. Hearing this, he was deeply alarmed. He memorized the name, vowing first to liberate himself, then others.\n\nDisciples, you may have entangled karmic roots from past lives, now coming to fruition. Precept-observers, you must rouse your own resolve: endure humiliation, release resentment, bear suffering, embrace hardship, forget shame, accept loss, reconcile grievances, and submit to adversity. Subdue this mind, enduring all. Wield the blade of precepts to extinguish the fire of ignorance at every moment; clothe yourself always in the robe of forbearance.\n\nWhen others strike or curse you, endure their scorn and slander, their mockery and insults—none of it can shatter your precept-mind. Even if falsely implicated, subjected to royal law and official punishment, struck by lightning from a clear sky, burned by fire or thunder, drowned in floods, robbed by bandits, seized by wolves or tigers, poisoned by snakes, afflicted by illness, oppressed by demons, haunted by ghosts, or tormented by spirits—even if the world’s desires twist words to ruin your reputation, or enemies hurl curses to harm your kin—even if there is no escape, your limbs severed, your body broken, with no means to evade—all these are the fixed karmic consequences of past causes, the inescapable fate you must face. You can only accept them with equanimity, aligning with the will of Heaven, repaying old debts, and resolving past karma.\n\nNever harbor resentment or defiance, lest you violate the precepts. Instead, reflect: if I am wronged by another, it is because I once wronged them. If I am oppressed, it is because I once oppressed others. All misfortunes, calamities, demonic obstacles, and disasters are the fruits of past deeds—self-created, self-endured. From the moment you receive the precepts, all evil karma dissolves with the mind. Naturally, the six desires fade, the three poisons vanish, body and mind grow light and healthy, the temperament becomes peaceful, suffering is healed, and enmities are resolved.\n\nDisciples, from beginningless time until now, accumulated grievances must awaken your innate goodness. For all debts and transgressions, willingly accept and repay them one by one. Sacrifice yourself to benefit others—only then is liberation attained. From this point, you will forever return to purity, to the original integrity of the great void, to the primordial source. Preserve the spirit, guard silence, and nurture the perfect reward-body.\n\nOtherwise, if past-life debts remain unpaid and present humiliations are not endured, the retribution of future lives will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this mind become empty? How can this Dao be cultivated? If you cannot even endure these few words now, how will you ever reach the end of birth and death, attaining pure liberation?\n\nDisciples, forbearance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, naturally cooling the five viscera. Forbearance generates the waters of the Flower Pool, naturally harmonizing the six bowels. Forbearance satisfies the desires of others, naturally dissolving enmity and fostering peace. Forbearance expands your capacity, naturally broadening your heart and mind. When others humiliate you, if you do not take it as humiliation, the shame returns to them.\n\nWhen I humiliate others, they receive my humiliation and will surely return it to me. If I can endure, my heart and qi will be at peace, preventing the liver’s fire from blazing and transforming it into the Southern Dipper’s disaster-dispelling light. If I can endure, the lungs and armpits will generate fluids, universally moistening the stomach and transforming into the Jade Pool’s sweet dew. If I can endure, the kidney’s essence will not be depleted, resolving upper and lower distress and transforming into the Martial Numinous Spring. If I can endure, the spleen’s earth will not parch, lightening the body and bringing ease, transforming into white snow and yellow sprouts. If I can endure, the Dharma-body will be without leakage, attaining the Dao’s qi to commune with spirits and transforming into a majestic, wondrous form.\n\nThose who can endure in the realm of state will surely benefit the court. Those who can endure in the household will surely benefit their kin. Those who can endure in the body will surely benefit their spirit. Those who can endure in the heart will surely benefit their nature and life. Those who can endure in teaching will surely benefit their Dharma kin. Such are the benefits of endurance.\n\nIf one cannot endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, the heart will not be empty, the spirit will not be numinous, the qi will not be robust, the capacity will not be vast, the chest will not be open, the aspirations will not be great, the merits will not be complete, the conduct will not be fulfilled, the vision will not be penetrating, the thoughts will not be profound, wisdom will be small, blessings and virtue will be shallow, and the root foundation will be weak. The Dao will not be clearly heard, its practice will be obstructed, one will be despised by others, incite jealousy, invite disgust, provoke vexation, be treated with contempt, suffer frequent ghostly reproach, experience nightmares and terror, endure divine rebukes in waking life, and suffer from scabies, leprosy, rashes, and madness. The roots of karmic grievances from many kalpas will not fade, and the retribution of future lives will grow deeper. The sea of suffering will not cease its waves—how then can one stir up storms from nothing?\n\nDisciples, have you not heard that virtue is the root? Only with forbearance does virtue become great. Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. Among you, the worthy and the foolish are not equal. Some lose virtue for wealth, some for beauty, some for pride. Though the external circumstances differ—whether humiliated for wealth, beauty, or pride—the humiliation is the same.\n\nThe sages said: *\"A moment’s anger makes one forget oneself and one’s kin.\"* They also said: *\"When angry, think of the consequences.\"* Master Zeng said: *\"When the heart harbors anger and rebellion, it cannot attain its proper state.\"* Is not the precept of forbearance weighty? Is not the harm of wrath and anger poisonous?\n\nThus, the true patriarchs took the restraint of anger as the gateway, forgetting anger to enter the Dao. They took forbearance as the slaying of the heart and the forgetting of humiliation as the fulfillment of vows. The *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* by the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity says: *\"The fiery haze becomes clear autumn skies, the sword trees bloom as fragrant groves. Surpassing the three realms is difficult, yet one ascends to the Heaven of Original Beginning.\"*\n\nDisciples, awaken swiftly and heed my verse:\n\n\"Swiftly dissolve the marks of self and others,\nHasten to realize the cause of birth and death.\nForbearance subdues the fire of wrath,\nAnd in emptiness the Dharma-body appears.\nThe seven emotions perish with each thought,\nThe hundred forbearances praised by ancients.\nWillingly bear the weight of karmic sins—\nOnly then is one beyond the kalpas.\n\nMyriad karmic obstacles are past causes,\nDebts owed and repaid are all the same.\nFoolishness and ignorance breed grievance, wrath erupts,\nA mass of karmic entanglement, dark and boundless.\nIn cultivation, never seek advantage—\nIf I gain, others will not comply.\nThrough kalpas adrift, grievances unresolved,\nThe Hall of Purity teems with strife.\n\nStrife finds no foothold where heaven is vast,\nImmortals and asuras differ thus.\nThe Cool and Blessed Land thrives on much forbearance,\nRepaying humiliations, the Dao’s work is complete.\nThis mortal frame ascends the Dao’s path—\nWhy refuse to bear another’s wrong?\nRaging fury sets the skin ablaze,\nThe homeless true person suffers hungry ghost’s fate.\"\n\n**The Eightfold Purity of Body and Mind**\n\nDisciples, having taken the precepts and sought refuge, you must now single-mindedly seek liberation from the world, transcending birth and death. Yet those who transcend birth and death possess the supreme, deathless, and birthless vehicle of the highest Dao—this Dao is the turning of worldly dharmas, fundamentally devoid of any fixed method.\n\nWorldly dharma and transcendent dharma differ only in the mind; their application may be inverse or compliant, yet in truth they are one dharma. This dharma is not merely the inverse use of compliance. To employ the inverse within compliance is to return the myriad dharmas to the non-doing Dao, a mechanism even spirits cannot fathom. To follow compliance within the inverse is to disperse one dharma into myriad dharmas, where yin and yang do not escape its calculation.\n\nThis is not a matter of deliberate action or mental deliberation, but rather the luminous wisdom of inherent nature, which is originally thus—not some separate transcendent dharma. Yet who transcends the world? Ultimately, one must send this person beyond the world to the world’s outer realm—yet this, too, is not it.\n\nNow, I urge you to transcend this body from the world. But in the vastness of heaven and earth, the breadth of the cosmos, where is this \"outer realm\"? Disciples, listen closely: the \"outer realm\" lies beyond worldly dharmas. Seeing through worldly dharmas as unreal, illusory passions as false, all conditioned actions and merits as dreams—where every phenomenon is insubstantial, every event unreal—only then can this mind attain the outer realm.\n\nDisciples, how can this mind transcend the world? Consider:\nHeaven’s cycles of cloud and clear cannot transcend;\nEarth’s collapses and landslides cannot transcend;\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon cannot transcend;\nThe falling of distant stars cannot transcend;\nWind, clouds, thunder, rain, frost, snow, mist, and dew—each bound by its measure—cannot transcend;\nMountains crumbling, stones splitting, waters drying, springs depleting, grasses withering, trees rotting, metals smelting, jade shattering—cannot transcend;\nHumans’ birth and death cannot transcend;\nThings’ growth and decay cannot transcend;\nAffection’s depth and shallowness cannot transcend;\nQi’s inhalation and exhalation cannot transcend;\nThe mind’s movement and stillness cannot transcend;\nEssence’s leakage cannot transcend;\nSpirit’s dullness and dissipation cannot transcend;\nPower’s rise and fall cannot transcend;\nProfit’s gain and loss cannot transcend;\nAll conditioned things are bound to formation, abiding, decay, and dissolution—birth, aging, sickness, and death—how can they transcend?\n\nDisciples, you must awaken to transcendent dharma within worldly dharma. This transcendent dharma does not lie in verbose speech but in the return of this mind. Once you know that heaven, earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly affairs are not the dharma of transcendence, you realize they are all confined within the snare of the world. If you can awaken within the mind to this truth—seeing that heaven, earth, and the myriad things are impermanent, that worldly dharmas and human emotions are illusions—what then is the true spirit?\n\nThis true spirit is formless and imageless, odorless and soundless. Speak of it as within, yet it is not confined to within; speak of it as without, yet it does not come from without. It is possessed by all, inherent in all things—this is the Dharma-king of transcendence. Disciples, this Dharma-king of true spirit pervades the cosmos, ancient and present, existing in all things at all times—it is no trifling matter.\n\nIn Buddhism, it is called the wondrous luminous true mind; in Confucianism, the luminous virtue of utmost goodness; in Daoism, the perfectly luminous Dao-mother or the primordial qi. Its many names are beyond enumeration.\n\nWhere does this knower of heaven, earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly dharmas reside? It is found in the *Great Learning*: \"Illumine the luminous virtue and rest in utmost goodness.\" This luminous virtue of utmost goodness dwells within formation, abiding, decay, and dissolution—within birth, aging, sickness, and death—as the deathless and sickness-free true spirit. It has endured from ancient times to the present, ever-present and undimmed. It penetrates heaven and earth, emerges from darkness and enters the unseen. It is unborn and unchanging, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither lacking nor surplus, neither coming nor going.\n\nIt governs yin and yang yet is not obstructed by them; it commands spirits and gods yet is not hindered by them. It employs the myriad things yet is not misled by them; it transforms human emotions yet is not moved by them. It responds to worldly dharmas yet is not drowned by them. It transcends the world yet abides within it. It roams the three realms freely, unbound; it governs the myriad spirits, its transformations profound and unfathomable. Above heaven and below earth, it alone is supreme, without equal.\n\nYet this true spirit, though possessed by all, is rarely understood. The myriad dharmas, the thousand gates, the three vehicles, and the entire canon all arise from it.\n\nThese subtle apertures, these profound mechanisms—realize them, and they lie before your eyes; miss them, and they sink to the ocean’s depths.\n\nDisciples, know that to leave the world and cultivate the Way, you need not go beyond the two words: *body* and *mind*. The body is provisional, the mind is true; the mind is provisional, the nature is true. You must awaken to the truth of refining the real by means of the provisional. Outer forms are provisional, inner reality is true; outer phenomena are form, inner reality is emptiness. Without relying on the provisional, conditioned form-body, you cannot cultivate the inner, unconditioned Dharma-body. Without the outer body of birth, aging, sickness, and death, you cannot realize the inner mind of serene perfection. Without the mind of luminous responsiveness, you cannot transcend and verify the boundless, limitless nature.\n\nYet this nature comes from the Mandate of Heaven. From the moment of birth, it is utterly unstained, one in substance with the Great Void, equal in measure to the Great Void. Empty and vast, it possesses nothing; whole and undivided, it lacks nothing.\n\nDisciples, if you now seek to leave the world, first purify body and mind. What is the practice of purifying body and mind? The body is formed of blood and qi, and blood and qi are not indestructible—they are the root of birth and death, the source of calamity and suffering. They entangle the mind and ravage the nature. Lust and desire arise from this body’s pursuit of pleasure; strife for fame and profit arises from this body’s pursuit of comfort. Violations of the law, punishments, disasters, and illnesses all originate from this body.\n\nThe Most High said: “People suffer because they have a body; if I had no body, what suffering would there be?” The ancients said: “If one is not burdened by form, before one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Immortal.” Clearly, this body is no small source of trouble. You must see through this skin-bag as a provisional thing, composed of earth, water, and wind. If cultivation is not pursued to the utmost, and one merely exhorts others to filial piety—saying that body, skin, and hair are received from one’s parents and must not be harmed—then know this: father’s essence and mother’s blood, the five agents in harmony, receive the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, the divine workings of yin and yang. The head is round like Heaven, the feet are square like Earth; standing between Heaven and Earth, humanity ranks among the Three Powers. Among the myriad things, humans are foremost. Above, they may match Heaven and Earth; in the hidden, they may assist spirits and gods. Through learning, they may approach sagehood; through cultivation, they may become immortals or Buddhas. How can one regard this most noble and richly endowed body as a stinking, filthy clod of earth? The intent is only to warn disciples against complacency and worldly delusion, to prevent them from seeking comfort for the body of form and instead return the true nature to its original constancy. Aspire to govern yin and yang with your will; adorn the Dharma-realm with your form and spirit. If the Dharma-body remains leaky, form and spirit cannot both attain perfection and merge with the Dao in truth.\n\nDisciples, I now explain the practice of purity to you. To purify this body, first cast aside worldly things, sever worldly attachments, and distance yourself from all worldly dharmas. Embrace simplicity and delight in tranquility; forsake rich flavors and shun clamor. Take refuge in the Three Jewels, and steadfastly uphold the One Truth. Cultivate a peaceful disposition; keep your hands and feet dignified and composed. Let your eyes and ears not stray into deviance; let your thoughts not scatter in distraction. Do not indulge in mental fabrications; do not raise your voice in loud speech. Gather the spirit-light of your two eyes to inwardly illuminate the unwavering mind-terrace; return the essence-apertures of your two ears to inwardly listen to the constant sound of Heaven’s harmony. Speak sparingly, and when silent, rest in natural stillness. Strive to be free of regret and resentment; let your thoughts not drift idly. Let your spirit be free of agitation, your celestial mechanism clear and smooth, the profound principle perfectly realized. Abstain from meat and fish to silently dissolve the karmic retribution of many lifetimes’ killing. Uphold the precepts with your body, and secretly practice the dignified conduct of the Four Great Elements. Let your feet not wander aimlessly, lest your mind grow restless; let your hands not move recklessly, lest your mind grow impatient. When sitting, be upright and centered, not leaning or slouching; when lying down, remain alert, avoiding excessive drowsiness. Eat plainly and reduce flavors, that the five viscera may be calm and harmonious; speak with care and composure, that your voice may be gentle and smooth. This is called the coarse practice of bodily purity.\n\nAs for the subtle work, you must delve into the meaning of “purity.” Do not fear that you cannot penetrate the heart and put it into practice; fear only that you will not investigate with sincerity and fail to realize the Dao.\n\nDisciples, a mind without dual thoughts is called *pure*; thoughts without杂乱 are called *still*. A mind unattached to forms is called *pure*; thoughts without stagnation are called *still*. Thought after thought perfectly luminous is called *pure*; luminosity without obstruction is called *still*. Unstained by a single speck of dust is called *pure*; all worries emptied is called *still*. No form escapes its perception—this is called *pure*; no spirit or god can fathom its mechanism—this is called *still*. A mind like flowing water is called *pure*; a nature like the bright moon is called *still*. The sins of beginningless time extinguished—this is called *pure*; the causes of countless kalpas thoroughly exhausted—this is called *still*. Inwardly observing the mind, the mind is no-mind—this is called *pure*; outwardly observing things, things are no-things—this is called *still*. Realizing the Three Truths—this is called *pure*; seeing only emptiness—this is called *still*. Observing emptiness, emptiness is also empty—this is called *pure*; emptiness is empty of emptiness—this is called *still*. When what is emptied is gone, and even emptiness of emptiness is gone—this is called *pure*; serene and ever still, stillness without stillness—this is called *still*. Truly constant in responding to things—this is called *pure*; constantly responding, constantly still—this is called *still*. Luminous and unobscured—this is called *pure*; entering the gate of all wonders—this is called *still*. Transcending the Three Realms—this is called *pure*; liberated from the Five Agents—this is called *still*. Shattering empty space—this is called *pure*; pulverizing empty space—this is called *still*. Light embracing all heavens—this is called *pure*; universally ferrying all beings—this is called *still*.\n\nDisciples, I have briefly outlined the essentials in my instruction. The sages of the Three Teachings, the great canon of scriptures, the myriad dharmas and thousand gates, the wondrous forms of all heavens—\n\nThe thirty-six thousand kinds of Dao, the eighty-four thousand dharma gates; the bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, the innumerable golden immortals—none can transcend the wondrous dharma of purity, stillness, concentration, and wisdom in non-action.\n\nDisciples, the supreme, unsurpassed, great vehicle’s highest and most authentic wondrous Dao—by which heavens, earth, humans, and all beings are born—all arise from purity and stillness. The Most High has said: *\"If one can remain constantly pure and still, heaven and earth will all return to them.\"* And again: *\"In purity and stillness, the world is rectified.\"* Thus, swiftly seek awakening through the purity and stillness of body and mind.\n\nDisciples, from this day forward, you must cast aside all the metaphors you once clung to—lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, yin and yang, the various fires of refinement. Instead, enter the gate of purity and stillness: extinguish deluded thoughts, quiet wayward intentions, and proceed steadily along the great middle path. Have no fear; this is called *\"delaying is better than erring\"*—when there is a road, do not board a boat. If I have deceived you with false words, may I fall into hell.\n\nAt that moment, the Vinaya Master recited a gatha:\n*\"Thoughts scattered, the mind is not still;\nDust thick, the body is not pure.\nImpure, how can the nature be seen?\nUnstill, how can feeling be absent?\nInwardly illumine—the body is illusion;\nTurn the light—even the mind is empty.\nWithin emptiness, the spirit sees itself;\nConcentration and wisdom are the true teaching.\nSun and moon must be observed,\nThe ordinary must be embodied.\nAgainst the current, grasp the Dipper’s handle—\nPurity and stillness align with heaven’s heart.\"*\n\nThe Ninth Seeker then asked the Master about the Dao.\n\nSince ancient times, sages, immortals, and buddhas—all who realized fruition and attained truth—did so only through a teacher. Thus, the transmission passes from master to master, mouth to mouth, heart to heart. In this, the principle is consistent and all-pervading. Like milk and water blending, or glue and lacquer uniting, like attracts like, sound responds to sound, water and sky merge as one, and lamp and flame shine together—only then is the way of master and disciple fully realized.\n\nDisciples, I observe that many in the world seek teachers and inquire after the Dao, yet most err slightly. They bear the name of master-disciple transmission but lack its true essence. Therefore, today I spare neither words nor fear of slander to explain the principle of seeking a teacher and inquiring after the Dao. You must bear this in mind, for in the future, when you first serve as another’s disciple, if you uphold this propriety, then later, when you become a teacher, your own disciples will follow the ancient model and emulate it. To honor the teacher is to revere the Dao.\n\nDisciples, the world is full of blind and deluded fools who do not recognize their own minds and are swept along by external things. Though they harbor thoughts of the Dao, they do not know the gate of right and wrong; though they possess the heart of the Dao, they do not understand the method of cultivation. They hear the saying, *\"Nature is realized through self-awakening; destiny is transmitted through a teacher,\"* and take it as their guide. Then, they may encounter some wandering Daoist—clad in tattered robes, straw sandals on his feet, a palm-leaf fan in hand, a rush mat slung over his shoulder—passing through towns, sitting by the roadside with a begging bowl, or strolling leisurely along the way. He finds lodging in temples and monasteries, speaking of secret formulas, his tongue like a reed organ’s pipes. He expounds on the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of Tailbone, the Sea of Qi, the Mud Pill Palace above, the Bubbling Spring point below. He teaches how to guard the center and draw qi, to establish the cauldron and set the furnace, to prolong life and ward off illness, to practice massage and guiding exercises. He recites the Six-Syllable Formula, the Eight Brocades, the *Awakening to Reality*, the *Triple Concordance*, along with metaphors from alchemical classics—lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, silver and cinnabar, husband and wife, the hexagrams of sun and moon, the nurturing of tortoise and snake, the bathing and conception of the embryo, the sealing of the chamber and sitting in meditation, the emergence of the yin spirit and the yang spirit. Endless are the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, the eighty-four thousand demonic arts—who could count them all?\n\nGood people, these foolish and blind followers lack wisdom in their hearts—how could they discern truth from falsehood, or recognize orthodoxy from heterodoxy? Yet they readily listen to such Daoists.\n\nEven more detestable is another breed: those wicked men who prattle of cauldrons and vessels, the swindlers who refine \"straw silver.\" They lure others with lust and tempt them with wealth. Not only are their methods entirely false—even if such arts were real, how could ordinary mortals transmute gold, or lechers prolong life?\n\nThus, those who speak of cauldrons and vessels, upon seeing beauty, stir desire; facing temptation, their thoughts waver. Their souls scatter, their spirits wander, true mercury flows downward, primordial qi collapses, and their most precious essence is lost. Many contract consumptive illnesses, failing to extend their lives—instead, their very lifespans are severed. How hateful, how lamentable!\n\nAs for the swindlers who refine \"straw silver,\" they prattle of cinnabar and ores, spinning one lie after another—nurturing, opening, and transmuting—endless schemes of deception and fraud. The greedy and foolish often ruin their families. Compared to the Daoists mentioned earlier, their karmic offenses are multiplied manyfold.\n\nI dare not speak further, lest I invite slander.\n\nBut those who have received the precepts must now heed my words on the proper way to seek a master and inquire into the Dao.\n\nOh, assembly! This august and celestial Dao of the Supreme Heaven—dim and indistinct, profound and obscure—is most vast, most great, most high, most revered; most mysterious, most hidden, most secluded, most subtle. It is so great that nothing lies beyond it, so small that nothing lies within. It can weave the heavens and warp the earth, emerge from darkness and enter the unseen. Now present, now absent, it enters water yet is not drenched, enters fire yet is not burned. Without past or present, it gives birth to heaven and earth, sets the sun and moon in motion, and nurtures the ten thousand things. It gives rise to sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas. Even the wriggling and the sentient—from insects to grasses and trees—all possess it, and nowhere does it not abide. In daily use and common practice, it is nothing but the wondrous Dao. Yet because the common folk employ it daily yet remain unaware, and lesser men’s hearts are deluded and fail to awaken, the One True is lost in an instant, and across ten thousand kalpas, clarity remains elusive. Before father and mother were born, the true spirit knows not its beginning; after essence and spirit depart, this body knows not its end. Thus, trapped in the cycle of inversion, they suffer the torments of birth and death.\n\nTherefore, I point to the root and source, urging all to seek a true master with haste and hear the supreme Dao without delay. Yet true masters are hard to meet, and worthy disciples hard to encounter. Know this: if a disciple lacks the true resolve to transcend the world, obstacles will cloud their wisdom-nature. Even if they chance upon a true master, spirits will prevent them from seeing, veiling their wisdom-nature, so that even if they do see, they cannot recognize the master’s authenticity. If a master lacks the resolve to deliver the world, even if they meet a worthy disciple, spirits will likewise obscure their Dharma-eye, deeming them without karmic affinity, and many such opportunities will slip away before their very eyes.\n\nOh, assembly! When a master seeks a disciple, it is like tossing a mustard seed to find a needle; when a disciple seeks a master, it is like grasping at the moon in water. True masters are rare, worthy disciples hard to find—not in the exchange of wealth and treasure, but only in the sincerity of a single thought. Have you ever seen a master of the Dao recklessly transmit to the unworthy? Have you ever seen a seeker of the highest Way carelessly bow to any master?\n\nOh, assembly! Since masters do not recklessly transmit to just anyone, such a master harbors the supreme Dao and seeks a worthy disciple. Since disciples do not carelessly bow to any master, such a person possesses keen insight and remains vigilant. Suppose there are those who refuse to lightly seek masters or recklessly bow to the Dao: their minds are free of obstacles, their aspirations lie beyond the dusty world, their vision is broad, and their hearts expansive. When they encounter a master of the Dao, they naturally perceive clearly beyond the surface, able to speak of it and discern it thoroughly. A single word or half a phrase—like a mustard seed finding a needle—aligns perfectly with the needle’s eye.\n\nSuppose there are masters who do not recklessly accept disciples or lightly transmit and teach: when they meet such discerning disciples, how could they not joyfully engage in profound discourse, exchanging wondrous secrets, true principles, subtle celestial mechanisms, and the most esoteric mysteries of the profound and arcane? Through the heart, they transmit the supreme Dao; through the mouth, they bestow celestial teachings.\n\nOh, assembly! True masters are not few, and disciples are many. Let me tell you why true masters are not few. Oh, assembly! Within the six senses you possess, all may become true masters. For instance, if your ear hears virtuous words and you wholeheartedly embrace and follow them, then the ear-root becomes your introductory master, and those virtuous words become your transmitting master. The same applies to the other five senses.\n\nOh, assembly! In learning, there is no fixed master—only the Dao is the master. Whenever you hear good and virtuous words, you must listen with focused spirit, as if sweet dew were dripping into your heart or ambrosia were pouring upon your crown. Silently, you should reflect on how this person has opened your delusion with compassion and skillful means, and wish that this proclaimer of virtuous words may swiftly realize the mysterious workings and attain the supreme Dao. Is this not a master-disciple relationship?\n\nFor example, if your eyes behold scriptures, texts of the Three Teachings, true words, or secret formulas, and your heart awakens in understanding, you should bow in reverence and praise. Such texts become the ones you recognize as true and believe in utterly, and naturally, master and disciple meet. Yet the master’s compassionate vessel and Dharma-bridge are not of a single method. Mencius said: “Teaching has many methods—some cultivate virtue, some develop talent, some answer questions, some privately instruct distant disciples. All are but forms of teaching.”\n\nThus, some delight in each other at first meeting, bonding instantly; some begin as strangers, neither acknowledging the other; some bow deeply and kneel to transmit; some exchange vows and offerings before transmission. Reverence is the prelude to ritual, yet reverence without substance is no reverence at all. What matters is observing the disciple’s sincerity, steadfast conduct, and respect for master and Dao.\n\nTherefore, some masters test repeatedly before transmission, as Yunfang tested Dongbin ten times. Some humble themselves before meeting, as Liu Xuande thrice visited the thatched cottage. Some follow their master for many years without wavering in resolve. Some, though knowing another’s sincerity, deliberately impose trials. Is the transmission of the Dao and reception of teachings a trivial or easily obtained matter? Thus, there are those who speak not a word in the presence of three, nor transmit where six ears may hear.\n\nFor the supreme teachings of the Dao cannot be imparted to those of middling or lesser capacity, just as middling or lesser teachings cannot be given to those of superior wisdom. Teaching must be tailored to the person. As in Confucius’ gate, when Ran You asked whether one should act upon hearing something, the Master said, “Act upon it.” When Zilu asked the same, the Master said, “With father and elder brother still living, how could you act upon hearing it?” For Qiu was retiring, so he urged him forward; You was overbearing, so he held him back. These teachings could not be shared indiscriminately. Thus, when Gongxi Hua heard both, he became confused.\n\nThe Master’s disciples asked many times about benevolence, yet the Master’s answers differed each time—rightly so. One may have unwavering faith, another may listen by chance; the faithful may be taught, the casual listener may not. Thus it is said: *\"Do not take what is hard-won and treat it as common.\"*\n\nAmong a multitude of a thousand or ten thousand, when the Dao is transmitted, the wise grasp it with ease, while the dull struggle to practice it. If one loudly recites the teachings, revealing the profound mechanism, those with intent may receive and remember—but those with intent yet no karmic affinity will hear it as the wind passing by, taking it as nothing.\n\nDisciples, when Śākyamuni Buddha held up a flower before the assembly and said, *\"I possess the wondrous luminous true nature, the sublime mind of nirvana, the treasury of the true Dharma-eye—can any of you perceive it?\"* Only Mahākāśyapa broke into a subtle smile.\n\nDisciples, Mahākāśyapa and Śākyamuni—openly they built plank roads, secretly they crossed the hidden pass. Before the great assembly, they transmitted the secret Dao mind-to-mind, mouth-to-mouth. Yet none among those disciples knew what was being passed or received.\n\nLikewise, when the great sage Confucius spoke before his many disciples, he turned to Zengzi and said, *\"Shen, my Way is bound together by one thread.\"* Zengzi replied, *\"Yes.\"* Though many disciples were present, did not the sage transmit the Dao before them all, while Zengzi alone grasped it among them? The others, not recognizing their own minds, met yet did not meet—what was transmitted, what was received, they knew not. But Zengzi, deeply attuned to his own nature, naturally aligned with the sage’s mind.\n\nLong ago, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Kongtong to seek the Dao from Guangchengzi. Thrice he entreated, yet Guangchengzi did not respond. The Emperor withdrew and purified himself, dwelling in seclusion for three months. He returned, humbly taking the lower position, advancing on his knees, and with reverent deference asked for the essentials of the supreme Dao. Only then did Guangchengzi reply:\n\n*\"The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure;\nits ultimate state is dim and silent.\nSee nothing, hear nothing—embrace the spirit in stillness,\nand the body will right itself.\nBe still, be pure; do not weary your form,\ndo not let your thoughts and cares run wild—\nthen you may attain long life.\nGuard your externals, close your internals;\ntoo much cleverness leads to ruin.\nI preserve the One and abide in harmony—\nthus have I lived twelve hundred years without aging.\"*\n\nThese few straightforward words he spoke directly to the Yellow Emperor—then fell silent. Whether you follow them or not is your choice.\n\nThis is called each fulfilling their own Dao.\n\nDisciples, within my Daoist gate lie the *Nanhua*’s many subtle meanings, the *Chongxu* and *Wenshi*’s countless true words, along with the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the thirty-six marvels—how many scriptures there are! Who can sweep clean their ears to reverently hear the wondrous teachings of the sacred texts, or open wide their eyes to transcend and awaken to the great Dao beyond words? Without awakening, the heart remains unillumined; even if you encounter a sagely teacher, you will not recognize them.\n\nDisciples, before seeking a teacher, first seek yourself. Before inquiring of the Dao, first inquire of your own heart. If you do not follow the precepts in practice, it will be most difficult to find a teacher who confirms your Dao. The key to this lies in your humility and self-effacement: first carve away all pride and arrogance, soften and yield in compliance. Cut away every thought of slander and jealousy. When meeting others, never boast of your own abilities—fear only that someone may equal you. If you happen upon a clear-eyed master or a lofty-minded adept, and their single phrase or half-sentence severs you at the waist, how will you break free? Naturally, like snow melting to reveal the corpse beneath, you cannot escape the discerning eye.\n\nNow I earnestly advise you all: seeking a teacher and inquiring of the Dao is no trifling matter. It is not enough to kneel and kowtow a few times before a teacher, or to hear them call you \"disciple\" a few times. Today, those who take the precepts lightly and disrespect the Dao are everywhere. Disciples, you must swiftly turn inward and reflect, repenting before the successive patriarchs of old for your past arrogance and contempt, transforming your old habits, and revering the Dharma-treasures. If your heart is truly sincere and earnest, and you keep your eyes open in your search for a teacher, then Heaven will not fail you—the immortals and perfected ones will come unbidden, without regard to distance or delay.\n\nHear my gatha:\nTo seek a teacher, master yourself;\nto inquire of the Dao, let your heart be sincere.\nOnly with sincerity can you awaken to the Dao;\nwith earnest devotion, you will meet good causes.\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, such encounters are rare;\nacross a thousand lives, you have reached this day.\nIf you can understand my words,\nyou will suddenly awaken to the root before birth.\n\n*Jade Garden Altar Sutra, Scroll the Middle*\n\nHold fast to the tenfold balance of concentration and wisdom, O assembly. Those who have received the First Real Precepts must advance to the Middle Ultimate, first fulfilling the subtle and wondrous practices of the First Real Ten Precepts in secret and meticulous observance before proceeding to receive the Middle Ultimate’s Three Hundred Great Precepts.\n\nO assembly, what distinguishes the Middle Ultimate Precepts from the First Real Precepts? One precept restrains all; one truth encompasses all truth.\n\nWhy, after the First Real, comes the Middle Ultimate, and after the Middle Ultimate, the Heavenly Immortal Precepts—why this sequence of progression? O assembly, this principle is clear and plain to see. Let me draw it from the empty sky to tell you.\n\nGreat assembly, the First Real Ten Precepts you have received are meant to restrain your physical form, to ride the wind and break the waves, forbidding reckless action and erratic behavior. The Middle Ultimate’s Three Hundred Great Precepts are meant to subdue your stubborn mind, forbidding wild thoughts and scattered intentions. The Heavenly Immortal Wondrous Precepts are meant to liberate your true intent, forbidding attachment and entanglement.\n\nO assembly, the First Real Ten Precepts are coarse; the Middle Ultimate Three Hundred are refined. The First Real Precepts govern the outer six senses; the Middle Ultimate Precepts sweep clean the inner six dusts; the Heavenly Immortal Wondrous Precepts dissolve the three bodies, extinguish the eight consciousnesses, and render the nine demons and ten trials powerless to invade.\n\nO assembly, the First Real Precepts arise because you have awakened to past wrongs, deeply repented former transgressions, and reflected that life in this world is fleeting, impermanent in birth and death. Having left the household life to become a Daoist, you are called a Perfected in Wholeness. Consider carefully: from the day you left home until now, when have you ever truly perfected anything? Year after year, you have idly passed the days, aging no differently than the common folk. From dawn to dusk, you wade through rivers and climb mountains, rushing south and north. Though you may have paid homage to several famous peaks, seeing more stones and trees than the common folk, in the end, you suffer the same hardships as merchants and travelers, buying and selling. Eating wind and lodging in water—what purpose does it serve? When have you ever encountered immortals? Those who transmit oral instructions are but common folk, worldly in eye and mortal in nature, reciting alchemical classics by rote, clinging stubbornly to trivial details—swallowing stones that cannot be digested, tasting nothing of their essence. Thus, you differ not at all from the common folk; how can you transcend the world and rise above the mundane?\n\nToday, having received the First Real Precepts, this heart that knows its faults still retains its original face. Why not transform your habitual false heart into a true heart, your habitual false intentions into true intentions, your habitual false visage into a true visage? Reveal your true heart and extend your repentance. From this day of receiving the precepts, you are called a disciple of the First Real. These First Real Precepts govern the four great dignified postures, adorn the physical form, yet remain unrelated to the Dharma-body and untouched by concentration and wisdom. Knowing your restlessness, I have imposed the Ten Precepts to restrain your body. If you can uphold these precepts in practice, your body will settle into stillness and concentration, allowing you to advance to the Middle Ultimate Precepts.\n\nO assembly, the Middle Ultimate Precepts pertain to concentration, differing from the First Real Precepts. The First Real is governed by the word *precept*; the Middle Ultimate by the word *concentration*; the Heavenly Immortal Precepts by the word *wisdom*. When the Heavenly Worthy took pity on sentient beings, he established these precepts of concentration and wisdom to subdue the workings of body, mind, and intent—this is the very art of transcending the world and rising above the mundane, the wondrous treasure of the Golden Elixir. Beyond these precepts of concentration and wisdom, there is no other method. Though there are eighty-four thousand external dharmas, none can escape these two words: *concentration* and *wisdom*. Whether you consume divine elixirs, refine the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, lift your dwelling to soar aloft, perform miraculous transformations, dissolve your corpse in emptiness, die standing or sitting, or seize another’s body—no matter how many immortal arts you master, the radiance of concentration and wisdom remains steadfast and unmoved. It illuminates all these divine powers and arts as a bright mirror in the courtyard reveals every coming and going, each form reflected within it. Thus, they remain within concentration and wisdom, never beyond their bounds.\n\nO assembly, the *Middle* in Middle Ultimate is the Celestial Pivot of the Dipper Mother, the unshakable center; the *Ultimate* is the Southern Ultimate governing birth and the Northern Ultimate governing death—the great mechanism of life and death, wholly dependent on the Dipper’s handle silently turning the numinous pivot. The Middle Ultimate wields the authority of heaven and earth, grasps the handle of life and death. This *Middle* is neither inside nor outside, neither left nor right, neither before nor behind, neither biased nor partial, neither excessive nor deficient—the *Middle* of \"holding fast to the center to attain harmony,\" the *Middle* of \"when words multiply and numbers fail, it is better to abide in the center,\" the *Middle* of \"the noble person walks the central path,\" the *Middle* of \"standing in the center without leaning.\" The Mystic Pearl, the Mustard Seed, the Pearl of the Buddha, the Great Ultimate of the Golden Elixir—many are its borrowed names and alternate titles, yet in truth, it does not transcend this wondrous, luminous, and unobscured true nature.\n\nO assembly, what is the equal holding of concentration and wisdom? O assembly, this single spark of numinous awareness has been entangled since beginningless time by the three karmic actions you have performed, stained by the six dusts, deluded by the seven emotions, assailed by the six desires, scorched by the three poisons, and overpowered by the ten demons. It has stolen your numinous awareness, leaving you neither daring to die nor daring to live. You cannot observe the Dao of heaven nor grasp the conduct of heaven.\n\nO assembly, this spark of numinous awareness is a Dharma-treasure; it should be turned against the current, not allowed to flow with it.\n\nFlowing with the current, one drifts with external things, stirred by circumstances, summoning demons and gathering monstrosities, inviting harm and courting calamity, entering and exiting the cycle of rebirth, traversing the four modes of birth and six paths of existence, adrift and submerged in suffering. Those who have received the Middle Ultimate Precepts must instead flow against the current. Flowing against it, one does not turn with any thing nor with any circumstance; demons, monsters, disasters, and calamities dare not encroach; the cycle of rebirth may be escaped, and the drifting may be transcended.\n\nNow, I ask you: what is called flowing with the current? In the ways of the world, it is bearing sons and raising daughters, taking wives and purchasing concubines, fathering children and begetting grandchildren, pursuing fame and fortune, expanding households and amassing property, buying fields and acquiring land, donning fine silks and wearing embroidered brocades, indulging in lust and desire, killing living beings and harming lives, filling one’s mouth with delicacies and one’s belly with feasts—all of this merely gratifies the physical form. Yet this physical form is but earth, water, fire, and wind, a temporary vessel of skin and flesh, formed when father’s essence and mother’s blood unite in lustful congress, when essence and qi interact, blood congeals into a mass, and consciousness invests it with spirit, settling the fetus and establishing life. All arises from the illusory transformation of the two qi, and in the end, it is impermanent, ultimately returning to dust. Only these two matters—merit and transgression—do not concern the physical form; rather, it is the Dharma-body that suffers.\n\nAlas! O assembly, those among you who do not believe this claim that the Dharma-body originally resides within the physical form, and that when the physical form dies, the Dharma-body is already empty. When a person dies, their numinous qi disperses and returns to emptiness—where then is there talk of heaven and hell, hungry ghosts and beasts, or the Dharma-body receiving retribution?\n\nNow, I ask you this: when a person dies and their qi disperses into emptiness, why do their descendants set out offerings during the four seasons and eight festivals? If you say that after death, this stream of numinous qi is not taken by the courts of the underworld for judgment, and that the good and evil, kindness and malice, debts owed, schemes hatched, killings, thefts, and all manner of karmic entanglements of one’s former life are not accounted for—then this stream of numinous qi would not come to partake of the sacrifices offered by descendants in the world. If it does not come to partake of worldly sacrifices, then the ancient *Rites of Zhou* and other such texts should not have falsely expounded so many sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies. The great sage Confucius should not have said, *\"Serve the dead as if they were living; serve the departed as if they were present,\"* nor *\"Sacrifice as if they are present; sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits are present.\"* Nor should he have spoken of *\"solemnly purifying oneself and donning fine robes to receive the sacrifices, as if the spirits were above, as if they were at one’s side,\"* or the *Book of Songs*’ lines: *\"The spirits’ arrival is unfathomable, immeasurable—King Wen is above, radiant in the heavens.\"* O assembly, since these sayings of *\"as if they were above\"* and *\"King Wen is above\"* have been passed down, then our hearts have already stored the sincerity of ghosts and spirits drawing near. If our hearts have already stored the sincerity of ghosts and spirits drawing near, then the great sages of old—Zhou Gong and Confucius—must have deeply understood the conditions of ghosts and spirits before establishing these sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies to instruct countless generations for all time. How could the sages have spoken deceptive words or fabricated strange tales?\n\nMoreover, consider those scholar-officials who are posthumously granted titles and ranks: if the stream of numinous qi after death scatters and becomes insensate, then the honors of posthumous enfeoffment would be excessive. Who would enjoy the golden seals and purple patents, or the favor of ascending to heaven? If receiving blessings implies the existence of ghosts and spirits, but suffering punishment implies their absence, then it is the human heart that lacks clarity, and the numinous awareness that remains unenlightened.\n\nThere are those cunning, murderous fools who know only to indulge in wine and lust, bewildered by wealth and qi, never having examined the karmic roots of what comes after death, recognizing only the blood and qi of the present moment. They stubbornly recite a few lines of poetry: *\"Do not ponder the endless matters after death; just drain this cup of wine in life.\"* They never recite those other two lines: *\"When the body perishes, nothing of the myriad things will go with it; in the dark realm, only karma follows the self.\"*\n\nO assembly, karma has three kinds.\n\nThe first is unwholesome karma—all entangling branches and leaves, unbroken and unending, unresolved and unexhausted, with causes and effects, effects and retributions. Those who do not believe in ghosts and spirits, do not revere heaven and earth, do not fear the king’s law, are disloyal to the sovereign, unfilial to parents, corrupt the Three Bonds, ruin the Five Constants, slander sages and worthies, kill, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, act cruelly and viciously, behave recklessly and falsely—after such a life ends, they fall into hell, transmigrating through its prisons, enduring boundless suffering. Later, reborn in the world of the living, they take the form of beasts. After the beastly retribution is complete, they return as humans, but with incomplete faculties, dull-witted and benighted, unaware of human affairs, despised and loathed by all, their bodies degraded and forced into servitude. They become beggars, their bodies covered in festering sores, infested with lice and filth, their clothes unable to cover them, their food unable to fill their mouths, suffering hunger and cold without recourse, enduring a thousand pains. They die in the wilderness, devoured by ants and dragged away by dogs. Their solitary souls, adrift and forlorn, sink once more into hell.\n\nThe second is wholesome karma—those who are intelligent and upright, incorruptible and impartial, bringing joy to the six relations and peace to their villages, revering parents, honoring the divine, respecting heaven and earth, esteeming the sovereign, venerating teachers and elders, cherishing friends, cultivating themselves and transforming desires, not being greedy with wealth, not lusting after beauty, not disrupting the Five Constants, and conducting all affairs with care. Even those who dwell in mountains as bhikṣus or in caves as old Daoists, content with frugality, enduring humiliation, their concentration yet unsteady and their Dao-practice incomplete—after their lives end, they are reborn as humans, becoming high officials or esteemed teachers, or enjoying ready-made wealth and honor, or attaining both fortune and longevity, living in ease and splendor, their lives filled with joy.\n\nThe third karma is the pure karma, with aspirations set upon the sage and the worthy, yearnings reaching toward immortals and buddhas. The mind abides in good thoughts, the mouth speaks good words, and the body performs good deeds. One associates with good people, treads upon good earth, and holds good things in hand. Solemn and dignified, the body does not move recklessly, the mind does not wander idly. One strives for clarity of mind, strives for stillness of mind. With long and deep cultivation, the original spirit settles in tranquility, ever dwelling within the Crimson Chamber, within the Yellow Court, in the Golden Portal and Jade Hall. All entanglements suddenly cease, all thoughts become empty. Only the true spirit is seen—form forgotten, things forgotten, realms forgotten, mechanisms forgotten. This is called *ding* (meditative absorption), and it is no small matter. It is the luminous and undimmed realm of the Three Purities, transcending the thirty-six heavens above and penetrating the seventy-two earths below, roaming beyond the Three Realms, revolving within the Five Phases.\n\nWithin this state of *ding*, all is dim and obscure, silent and still. Heaven and earth revolve and return to primordial chaos, merging into a single *qi*. Above, it is not heaven; below, it is not earth; in the center, it is not human. It cannot be spoken, cannot be described, cannot be conceived. Suddenly, a divine radiance bursts forth, and a wheel of wisdom-nature wells up. The clear is divided into heaven, the turbid into earth, and the harmonious *qi* within the principle becomes the Dharma-body. Wisdom pervades the Three Realms, illuminating the Great Mystery. No thing can escape its traces, no affair is unknown in its coming and going. There is not the slightest hindrance, not the thinnest obstruction, not a speck of dust or filth.\n\nAll heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, demons, and monsters submit in reverence. Yama, upon seeing it, dare not raise his voice; Ox-Head and Night-Rakshasa bow in submission with clenched fists. The ledger of life holds no name, the register of death bears no surname. One may attain longevity in the world. Expounding the Dharma to liberate beings, one may ascend in spirit and attain transformation. Ultimately, one enters the realm of pure emptiness, ascends to pay homage to the Beginningless, and forever escapes the cycle of rebirth.\n\nAll of you, the pivotal celestial mechanism for crossing over lies solely in the movement and stillness of the true mind. Profound stillness is called the power of *ding*; true *ding* is named the radiance of wisdom. If the deluded mind is not first put to death, how can one settle the spirit and stabilize the *qi*? If one cannot abide in constant purity and stillness, how can one enter *ding*? If one cannot enter *ding*, how can one attain wisdom?\n\nAll of you, when the mind is empty, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, radiance is born. If there is *ding* without wisdom, it is called the yin-spirit overcoming the yang-spirit. One must give rise to wisdom within *ding*. Wisdom is the Dharma-body; *ding* is the Buddha-nature.\n\nAll of you, *ding* is the home, precepts are the path, wisdom is the life-giving force. The myriad things, myriad realms, and myriad affairs of the world are all guests. If *ding* and wisdom mutually give rise to one another, entering the gate of manifold subtleties, then the spiritual power and wisdom of the true master are fully nurtured, and radiant light manifests. One can respond to the myriad things and myriad affairs without being bound by them; one can transform the myriad realms of the world without being deluded by them; one can transcend the cycles of yin and yang, life and death.\n\nAll of you, first you must understand the two paths of sin and blessing, the law of cause and effect, and retribution. Follow the precepts and practice them one by one, not daring to deviate in the slightest. After long and deep contemplation, clarity and understanding will naturally arise. Only then should one enter stillness and engage in meditative observation. Within *ding*, the original nature becomes perfectly luminous, the radiance of wisdom shines brightly, and the spirit and *qi* suddenly awaken. Then, mountains, rivers, and the great earth do not extend beyond one’s body; the life and death of the myriad things do not extend beyond a single thought. From the numinous clarity of the true master, one holds the handle that prevents entry into the cycle of rebirth.\n\nThis work of the \"center\" cannot be substituted by father or son, nor can it be known by gods or ghosts. Each of you must personally attend to it and practice it.\n\nAll of you, I have erected the ladder to heaven—who among you will ascend it? I have pushed off the raft of the Dao—who will board it?\n\nHear this poor Daoist’s gatha:\n\"The River of Desire stretches boundless—none may cross,\nThe Sea of Suffering spreads vast—few are the Dharma bridges.\nHasten, all of you, to uphold the Three Hundred Precepts,\nAnd in idle ease, *ding* and wisdom will rise above the waves.\"\n\n**The Eleven Esoteric Practices for Cultivating the True**\n\nAll of you, since you have vowed to cultivate the true, aspiring to become perfect Daoists, you must first clearly discern the two words *true* and *false*, penetrating their meaning thoroughly before applying effort. Only by striving to transform the false into the true do you fulfill the duty of a cultivator.\n\nAll of you, listen as I speak of the false, that you may cultivate the true.\n\nAll of you, this body of yours is entirely false—it is but an impermanent phantom form. The six roots will ultimately decay, the six consciousnesses will ultimately dissolve into emptiness. Though the breath at the throat serves a thousand uses, in a single moment of impermanence, all things come to rest.\n\nAll of you, have you not seen how mortals are born—\nnine feet tall, their waists ten spans in girth;\nfaces round as the full moon, lips red as cinnabar;\n\nEyes black as lacquer, skin soft as fine lard;\nDignified in bearing, awe-inspiring in presence;\nEloquent of speech, rich in wisdom and cunning;\nA thousand stratagems, ten thousand schemes at hand;\nKeen of intellect, learned in letters,\nStrong of limb, skilled in martial arts;\nHigh officials and mighty generals,\nArtisans and men of talent;\nTrading and trafficking, seizing profit and fame;\nPursuing glory to rise in rank, amassing wealth to build a house.\nIn painted halls, twelve golden hairpins dance and sing;\nOn jade steps, three thousand bejeweled slippers come and go in flattery.\nGold and silver surpass the Northern Dipper, treasures rival Mount Tai’s height.\nFeasting on delicacies, clad in brocade,\nWith every bite, a hundred flavors of rare dishes;\nConsorting with the bold and gallant,\nWherever they go, elaborate courtesies abound.\nWhen a wife reaches middle age, she is cast aside for the new;\nConcubines crowd the chambers, yet they forget the withering of spirit and exhaustion of essence.\nHousehold wealth abounds, ten thousand acres of fertile land lay the foundation;\nChildren grow wise beyond their years, yet a first-rank official post still feels too small.\nDay and night without rest, infatuated with flowers and enamored of beauty;\nGreed knows no end, body weary and mind spent.\n\nAmidst summer damp and winter chill, the six pulses of yin and yang fall into discord; through ceaseless pursuit and relentless chase, the three souls scatter and drift away. A hundred ailments assail, bringing the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and pain; a thousand calamities cling fast, from toil and weariness to transgressions and faults. Though ginseng and poria are consumed, no cure is found; though heaven and earth are invoked, no response comes. A thousand pains and sorrows cannot be fully told—until, in a single breath, the qi severs, and one descends to the courts of the dead.\n\nOnce so dignified in appearance, no sooner has the breath ceased than others cover their noses; once so imposing in presence, the moment the eyes close, the face turns upward. The four limbs are gathered into the coffin’s wood, the likeness preserved only on paper. Children do not take one’s place in death, nor do wives and concubines follow. Before the corpse has grown cold, the living have already turned their thoughts elsewhere. Brothers squabble over wealth and property, while wives and concubines hide treasures and fine garments. Those with sons begin scheming for the days ahead; those without devise plans to remarry. At the gate, the carriages of guests grow sparse—so the saying goes, *\"When a man lives, his favors live with him.\"* Within the household, servants begin to steal, for as the proverb warns, *\"When power wanes, even slaves will deceive.\"* Who tends to the crumbling walls and gates? Who notices the family’s decline? Wives turn to wantonness, children prove unfilial—each looks only to their own future.\n\nWhen has the dead ever returned to life? Who has departed and then come back? Born with empty fists, one departs with bare hands. The physical form returns to earth, the name dissolves into emptiness. Along two paths—good and evil—retribution is meted out with perfect clarity.\n\nPeople, behold these illusory forms of the physical world—are they not false? Yet if they are false, then this single spark of true spirit, which seeks to build a household, pursue high rank, acquire wives and concubines, cherish children and grandchildren, and enjoy wealth and honor, is most certainly not false. Observe, then: where does this true spirit go? Clearly, it departs to the netherworld. And once there, can it still cling to wives, concubines, beloved children, wealth, honor, and glory?\n\nPeople, the two causes of good and evil, the two retributions of sin and blessing, the two fruits of suffering and joy—these follow as surely as a shadow clings to form. Can the physical body escape even the slightest bit of suffering or punishment? Therefore, you must regard the physical form as light and the Dharma-body as weighty, using the false to cultivate the true, preserving the true and discarding the false, so as to escape the sea of suffering. Yet without this physical form, there would be no means of cultivation, and the solitary spirit of the Dharma-body, unable to govern itself, would be cast into the six paths of rebirth—then the effort would be in vain.\n\nSince we have attained human form and entered the gate of the Dao, we must seek liberation from the cycle of rebirth while the light in our eyes has not yet faded. How, then, is this cultivation to be pursued? People, you must sweep clean the six sense gates and their dust, harmonize the five viscera and their qi, and keep the master ever abiding in the luminous terrace, so that demonic thieves cannot invade. Perform many good deeds, and eradicate the roots of sin.\n\nYet within this method of cultivating the true, there are two paths—each with its true and false, its active and passive. The *Diamond Sutra* says, *\"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and like lightning.\"* The *Classic of Purity* states, *\"Living beings fail to attain the true Dao because of their deluded minds.\"* From these scriptures, we know that within the cultivation of the true, the path of conditioned dharmas is not the right one.\n\nAlas, there is a school that manipulates essence and moves qi, seeks to extend life and replenish vitality, reverse aging and restore youth, achieve immortality and escape death—all while clinging to form in their practice. Others ascend lead and descend mercury, forge cauldrons and burn thatch, ingest elixirs, swallow talismans, and consume qi. These are all attempts to use the false to cultivate the true, mere conditioned methods—how can they lead to seeing the nature, establishing the mandate, and escaping the cycle of rebirth? To transcend birth and death, one cannot emerge in such a way.\n\nPeople, in using the false to cultivate the true, you must thoroughly investigate the great matter of life and death and truly comprehend the authentic path of the Dao. Where does this path lie? It lies solely in the turning of your own mind—whether it follows or resists. If it follows, it is at the mercy of others; if it resists, it is governed by the self.\n\nThis physical form—whether cultivated or not—will still die. Even if one lives a thousand years, in the end, it returns to earth. Why, then, does it come? People, where there is form, there is decay; where there is beginning, there is end; where there is creation, there is transformation; where there is gathering, there is scattering; where there is coming, there is going; where there is success, there is failure; where there is youth, there is old age. Since this body is born, it must inevitably die.\n\nThe method of transcending birth and death that I speak of does not concern itself with this body. It merely borrows it as a dwelling place to cultivate the heavenly mandate of the Dharma-body. Those of external paths, failing to grasp this principle, take it as real, cling to form, and seek to make this flesh-and-blood body imperishable and deathless—is this not laughable?\n\nThe method of transcending birth and death that I speak of lies solely within the true mind of this body, in the thoughts that arise and the deeds that are done. When deluded thoughts do not stir, the Dharma-body is born; when the Dharma-body is still, the heavenly mechanism moves; when the heavenly mechanism moves, the true light appears. It is only because this true light is not yet complete that we borrow this physical form to perform good deeds. Yet even good deeds have their true and false: clinging to form makes them false, while non-attachment makes them true.\n\nBehold the Tathāgata: He gives without attachment to giving, accumulates merit without attachment to merit, expounds the Dharma without attachment to expounding, cultivates the Dao without attachment to cultivation, and emerges into the world without attachment to emergence. Because He is unattached, He can emerge into the world; because He can emerge into the world, He can transcend birth and death.\n\nThe *Classic of Purity* says, *\"The highest virtue does not act as virtue.\"* This is non-attachment—is this not liberation? How, then, can one escape birth and death?\n\nMerely living a few more years only earns some karmic rewards. When those rewards are exhausted, one still cannot transcend the cycle of rebirth. Disciples, I urge you to follow the words of the Most High—there is no error in them: *\"Set the body aside, and the body endures; place the self last, and the self leads.\"* Only then can one die yet not perish.\n\nDisciples, set your bodies aside and do not cling to the cultivation of essence and qi, coveting the ascent and descent of vital energy, the unblocking of orifices, the circulation of blood and meridians, the prolongation of life, or the prevention of illness. Attached to such practices, you instead fixate on the solidity of the physical form, seeking fleeting pleasure and carefree ease, while neglecting your true nature year after year, day after day. Yet one day, when the lesser spirits catch you unawares, they will suddenly seize you. Where then will your Dharma-body drift with the waves? Your physical form will be consigned to the muddy pit, and in the end, all will be emptiness.\n\nI implore you, disciples, to diligently practice the work of humbling the mind and enduring with patience, so that you may early awaken to your true nature. How then could you worry that your life will not be established? Disciples, I remind you: the physical body is but a house, and the Dharma-body is its master. If the master possesses treasure, how could the house not be well-ordered? But if the master falls ill, or invites misfortune, or incurs calamity, or is taken away, who then will dwell in that well-ordered house?\n\nLet me raise the matter one level higher to awaken you: the physical body is a rented house, not one you own. When the master departs, it returns to dust, and the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—are each restored to their source. If you can silently cultivate an unattached true Dharma-body, how could the physical form not find a good place to rest?\n\nDisciples, I have a few clumsy verses—listen as I recite:\n\nThe physical form is but the Dharma-body’s house;\nWhen the inner is bright, the outer naturally shines.\nIf only the master cultivates blessings and wisdom,\nHow could the house fail to radiate splendor?\n\nTo preserve the true, first dispel the false;\nThe true Dharma must discard the false and illusory.\nDo not boast, do not cling to form—\nDual cultivation of nature and life transcends impermanence.\n\nOnly by quieting the mind and seeking liberation\nCan the illusory body be set down, revealing the true self.\nClinging to life and fearing death, you will still die;\nAttached to form in cultivation, how can you attain the real?\n\nThe Tathāgata severed body and limbs,\nThe Jade Emperor once endured humiliation.\nForgetting the body, he perished through three thousand kalpas;\nAbandoning the kingdom, he retreated to the mountains for eight hundred years.\n\nYet the Daoist, clinging to this skin-bag of falsity,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, never escapes the dust.\nCease your striving, spare your spirit—\nAll that has form must ultimately return to yin.\n\nIf you lose the true Suchness of your nature,\nIn the boundless sea of suffering, where will you seek it?\nAlas! Pity those who,\nWithin the false, cling to layer upon layer of falsity,\nStudying the Complete Truth in vain—how can they attain the real?\n\nThe sorrows of birth, aging, sickness, and the fear of death—\nIn death, how are you different from ordinary people?\nWearing the yellow cap and feathered robes in vain,\nNever having grasped the mechanism of life and death,\nYou wander the ends of the earth in search of clothing and food,\nOnly for karmic retribution to overtake you, turning you to mud.\n\nIf you do not understand that sin and blessing are fundamentally empty,\nThe cycle of birth and death will never cease.\nIf you have not awakened to the fact that the false and true reside within you,\nWho will reveal the light of wisdom?\n\nDisciples, each of you must reflect: impermanence comes swiftly. The esoteric practices I speak of number three hundred, comprising the Three Hundred Subtle Precepts of the Supreme Ultimate. Through them, cultivating the body refines its posture; cultivating the mind dissolves deluded thoughts. Applied inwardly, they make one a sage; applied outwardly, they make one a sovereign. They enable transcendence of the worldly and ascension to the fruit of pure emptiness, allowing one to deliver others from suffering and end the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe most crucial element is secrecy. Without secrecy, one cannot preserve the true; without preserving the true, the mind remains unclear; and if the mind is unclear, the true nature cannot be seen. Disciples, what does \"secrecy\" mean? The sages used it to purify the mind and retreat into concealment. Secrecy is the utmost vigilance. Utmost precision is hidden in obscurity—this is the pinnacle of secrecy.\n\nDisciples, all who wish to receive the Supreme Ultimate Precepts must first take the first to the hundredth precept as the great divine mantra for purifying the body. By observing this mantra with care, you must entirely dispel the body’s restlessness, transforming it into stillness. All frivolity must depart, replaced by steadiness. In the four great deportments—walking, sitting, standing, and lying—you must walk the middle path, sit without leaning to one side, stand upright without leaning on walls or pillars, or propping yourself on tables. When lying down, curl the body to the side; do not sleep flat on your back with loud snoring. Even the slightest sound from the breath must be regulated, cultivating an appearance of reverence and propriety—this is called \"external adornment.\"\n\nThe hundredth to the two hundredth precept form the great divine mantra for purifying the mind. By contemplating this mantra in accord with the Dao, you must delve deeply and awaken secretly, ensuring every thought returns to the true, every action aligns with the Dao, and not a single word is neglected. Investigate again and again, awaken again and again. Observe things from afar, then examine them closely within yourself, eradicating all wayward and perverse thoughts. Only when the true mind is firmly settled can you proceed.\n\nThe two hundredth to the three hundredth precept form the great divine mantra for purifying the intent. Not a single thread must be leaked. Within them lie the subtle mechanisms of ebb and flow, the principles of interaction, hidden in the mysterious capital’s treasury—subtle, wondrous, beyond thought and description, beyond form and image. They can be spiritually realized but not spoken of, encompassing the supreme, most honored, non-actional, wondrous Dao.\n\nDisciples, this is the esoteric practice of cultivating the true. Hear now one final word and remember it well: the supreme Dao abhors disclosure. Disciples, is the cultivation of the true and the liberation from birth and death a trivial matter?\n\nIf the celestial mechanisms are not kept secret, they will be leaked to the unworthy. Thus, when Master Zhang Ziyang of the Purple Sun transmitted the teachings to the unfit, he thrice incurred heavenly punishment—hence, they must not be disclosed. How much more so for those who seek to transcend the wheel of rebirth, leap beyond the world, and become true beings unharmed through ten thousand kalpas? Would this not incur the envy of heaven and earth, the wrath of ghosts and spirits, the resentment of yin and yang, and the fury of creation? Moreover, this reversal of the natural course, this inversion of worldly ways, sets you at odds with the mundane like fire and ice. You must proceed with utmost caution and secrecy, lest your six relations turn against you, your nine clans become enemies, your wife and children grow cold, and your friends lose faith—all because you failed to rouse a mighty resolve, thus fostering a heart that retreats from the Way.\n\n**The Twelve Acts of Repaying Kindness and Dispelling Calamities**\n\nDisciples, since you have left the household life to seek liberation from the world, you must repent and eradicate the karmic debts of a thousand past lives and the deep-seated grievances of countless generations, ensuring they vanish from this moment onward and never arise again. Only then can you clear the suffering of karmic retribution. Yet this remains the work of the lesser vehicle, the deeds of those who flee from karmic debts, cowards who cling to life and fear death—petty-minded, incompetent, inferior beings. Such persons have not illuminated their hearts, nor awakened their innate nature. They live only for the present, heedless of future lives. Now, let me recount an example of such externalists for all to hear and understand.\n\nThere was once a Daoist who left the household life midway through his journey. He wandered in search of truth and encountered several companions, with whom he made a vow to build a hermitage on Laoshan in Shandong and cultivate there. Later, due to war, they descended the mountain together and settled in the foothills of Wangwushan in Henan, living alone in meditation. Though six of them dwelt in the same place, their aspirations and practices differed. After a year, three departed, leaving only three who renewed their vows to seek liberation from the world.\n\nLater, one of the three entered *samadhi* and passed away. The remaining two grew even more resolute. Then another entered *samadhi* and departed, leaving only one to cultivate in solitude. During meditation, his spirit wandered to Tiantaishan, where he unexpectedly encountered the companion who had passed later. Overjoyed, the latter said, \"I have met you by karmic affinity and must tell you this: you should revise the vow you made years ago. When I first vowed to cultivate, I sought to repent of karmic grievances to attain liberation. Yet when my allotted time in the world ended, I arrived at the outer gates of the Three Heavens, where the Bureau of Karmic Review proclaimed loudly: *'This one’s karmic roots remain; their fate is inescapable. Their name is not on the celestial register, nor do they have a place on the Cinnabar Terrace. They may not proceed further and must instead go to Yuntaishan to receive an appointment at the Three Primordials’ Assembly Hall.'* Immediately, a mighty wind and vast *qi* obscured the heavenly gates, and I found myself at the Three Primordials’ Hall.\n\nThere, the Three Officials examined the ledger and said: *'You, with your lesser aspirations and heterodox practices, deludedly sought liberation. Out of compassion for your ignorance, we appoint you provisionally as the mountain spirit of Tongbo Palace on Tiantai, to await a vacancy in the underworld before confirming your post.'* I pleaded for further instruction to cultivate in secret, and the Three Officials, their faces kind, replied: *'When you sat in meditation, your thoughts were not pure, your mind not empty. You failed to see through the emptiness of the physical form and the reality of the innate nature, nor did you awaken to the non-emptiness within emptiness. You merely sought to repent of the grievances of a thousand lives and erase the enmities of countless generations, believing that after leaving the household life, karmic debts and sins would no longer arise. Yet you never deeply investigated or fully awakened to how grievances are eradicated and enmities repented within the innate nature. How could the karmic grievances accumulated over eons and the enmities forged across lifetimes be swept away by mere words or thoughts? You must enter the gate with resolve, study the supreme vehicle, and cultivate the great root and great capacity with a heart of universal salvation.\n\nThe great capacity of the supreme vehicle instantly extinguishes the mundane mind, rendering heaven and earth empty and illusory forms like ashes. Yet even then, deep-seated karmic grievances may remain unresolved. How can debts of wealth and life be taken lightly? Thus, the ancient Buddha King Ariya severed his own limbs to repay past debts, leaving no trace behind, and only then attained the realization of Sakyamuni. The Sixth Patriarch washed away deep-seated grievances, bearing even the slightest karmic burden, and only then attained the great mirror of the Western Heaven.\n\nNow, your aspirations are small, your roots inferior. You refuse to repay karmic debts, seeking only to escape suffering. You cling too tightly to the physical form, fearing the arrival of karmic adversaries, dreading punishment, beatings, death, and pain, desiring only the fleeting comfort of the body. This fear of repayment is the mark of an inferior root, placing you in the lesser vehicle. If the roots of grievance are not emptied, they will resurface in future kalpas. With karmic causes still present, you will encounter them again in future lives. Though you call this 'leaving the household life,' it is merely fleeing from suffering. Unable to escape it, you remain entangled across kalpas, bound through generations—all because your initial vow was weak and your aspirations narrow. In this life, leaving the household life earns you only the name of 'cultivating blessings,' not 'cultivating the Dao.' You were fated to reenter the wheel of rebirth and be reborn with great fortune. Yet because you once recited the sacred scriptures of the Supreme Emperor a hundred times and chanted the sacred name of Maitreya for three years with sincere devotion, you were appointed to the rank of Orthodox Unity Perfected One. Since you performed rituals for patrons without error and distributed all the wealth you received, you are deemed worthy of promotion—thus, this additional rank.'\"\n\n\"Your register has been selected for appointment as deputy mountain deity of the Grotto-Heaven, to hasten and assume management. Cultivate diligently in the unseen realm, and do not grow remiss.\n\nThen I suddenly awoke to self-realization, regretting my aspirations had not been grand. Only now did I understand: small causes yield small effects, while great vows bring great recompense. Yet remorse comes too late. I was just about to enter your realm of pure divine awakening to speak with you.\n\nOnly because each must guard their appointed duties, I dared not leave the mountain’s bounds to wander. Now that you have arrived at this opportune moment, you may renew your vow. Toward all karmic creditors—whether foe or kin—refuse not requital. With unwavering resolve alone can the fruit be great. If even the slightest trace of hesitation or fear remains, there will be trials of escape, and even if you succeed, your fruition rank will not be great.\"\n\nWith these words, he vanished.\n\nEmerging from meditation, the Daoist then understood he had been but a lesser vehicle practitioner, one who merely perfected himself—an outer path that would leave him no more than a mountain-watching ghost. Thus, he hastily burned his thatched hut, shouldered his rush cushion, gourd, and staff, and began anew to cultivate the ground of the mind.\n\nHe endured every humiliation, bore every suffering, and practiced every deed. He drove out stray thoughts and tempered body and mind. He vowed that toward all with whom enmity was knotted, he would not shrink from blade or axe. He regarded this fleshly form as finite, while the life of the celestial nature he maintained in purity.\"\n\nUnencumbered, unbound, undisturbed, unshaken—\nstripped bare, radiant, perfectly rounded, utterly pure,\ncoming and going with sovereign ease.\nBlessings he would not seek to claim,\nsuffering he would not refuse to bear.\nWith this single resolve, he passed many more years.\n\nThen one day, in the stillness of meditation,\na Daoist appeared before him, approaching to bow in homage.\nHe looked closely—it was the same friend who had first come to instruct him.\nHis form remained unchanged, but his face bore shame,\nand he dared not lift his eyes.\nAsked of his circumstances, he revealed:\nonce a disciple of a heretical master, he had failed to grasp the central principle,\nand instead fixated his spirit and qi upon the elixir field.\nThrough long, deep practice, he had become but a corpse-guarding ghost—\nhis light extending no farther than a foot,\nilluminating only his own bodily shell,\nwhile all beyond remained in darkness, nothing visible.\nNow, because this Daoist had entered deep stillness and expanded his light,\nit had drawn in this long-departed friend, bringing him into that meditative realm.\nAfter a brief moment, he vanished again.\n\nThis encounter deepened the surviving Daoist’s understanding of the principle of inherent nature.\nFor life resides within inherent nature:\nwith each degree of comprehension, light increases;\nwith each increase of light, wisdom grows;\nwith each growth of wisdom, merit and virtue accumulate;\nwith each accumulation of merit and virtue, the fruition rank ascends.\nThus, he emerged from stillness.\n\nThis Daoist, having swept clean his six senses, dissolved his eight consciousnesses, emptied his five aggregates, and severed his seven emotions, was now poised for final refuge in the Ever-Clear, Ever-Tranquil Great Heavenly Worthy. Yet, bound by the qi allotment of his mortal form—bestowed by parents, nurtured by heaven and earth—his destined lifespan had reached its end. The next day, he descended the mountain to bid farewell to his external protectors and fellow disciples: *\"I must now take leave of you all and return to the source.\"* The assembly asked, *\"Why must you depart so hastily?\"* The Daoist replied, *\"I have repaid my three karmic debts, yet four great debts remain unfulfilled. Thus, I must be reborn to settle this one last resolve.\"* With these words, he clasped his hands, turned toward the void, and bowed in reverence—then, in perfect stillness, he departed.\n\nDisciples, heed this: the path may be straight or crooked, the vows great or small. These three individuals, when viewed by the fruit of their return, reveal ranks of vastly differing magnitude. Disciples, those with great aspiration become great beings; those with small aspiration remain small. For without great aspiration, the heart cannot expand; without an expansive heart, the capacity cannot widen. Narrow vows and constricted capacity breed shallow knowledge and cramped vision, and the qi thus cultivated cannot become vast. If qi is not vast, it merely fills the illusory sack of skin—unable to pervade the Great Void, to stand between heaven and earth, to penetrate sun and moon, or to permeate the ten thousand beings. How then can this be called the Great and Ultimate Dao?\n\nDisciples, we are born between heaven and earth, illumined by sun and moon, nurtured by parents, and guided by sovereign and teacher—these are the Four Great Debts, boundless and profound, impossible to fully repay. Yet we still fall back into the suffering of the colored body, the calamities of the five aggregates, still unable to transcend. Even with dual cultivation of merit and wisdom, we struggle to attain lasting permanence.\n\nDisciples, now that you have taken refuge in the Three Treasures, why have you not yet transcended suffering? Merit and wisdom are but the desires of wealth and honor—ancient sages said: *\"The River of Love surges with thousand-foot waves; the Sea of Desire churns with ten-thousand-layer swells.\"* Only when the waters dry and the waves subside, when the source of inherent nature is perfectly clear, can you awaken. You must realize that all beings—past and present—share this same source. Whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all possess awareness. Recognizing the unity of self and others is repayment to heaven—endless, boundless compassion, embracing impurity and enduring humiliation. Who among the flying, swimming, moving, and growing does not share this same vital force, sustained and nurtured by it? This is repayment to earth.\n\nWhen the ground of inherent nature is luminous and the sky of inherent nature is radiant, you meet those lost in darkness and guide them with true words, pointing out the path of awakening. You encounter the drowning and deliver them through the Dharma, clearing away obstacles. This is repayment to sun and moon.\n\nDiligently follow your teacher’s instructions, strictly adhere to the laws of the land, and reverently uphold the sovereign’s decrees. Do not overstep your bounds, violate virtue, or deviate from the natural order. Uphold the pure precepts and observe the scriptures; pray for the sovereign’s longevity and the empire’s stability. Transmit these teachings to future generations and propagate the true Dao. This is repayment to sovereign and teacher.\n\nThe body is a gift from parents—do not defile hair or skin. Dissolve the barrier between self and others, repent and liberate the suffering of the departed. For the toil of past parents, dissolve the karmic knots of many lives. For the hardships of present kin, repay their afflictions and atone for their transgressions. Devote this mortal form to unceasing filial piety. Without delivering your parents, you cannot ascend to truth. Honor all parents as you would your own, and cherish all children as you would your own flesh. Thus, the seven generations above will ascend, and the three generations will rise high. This is repayment to parents.\n\nDisciples, if even a thread of obstruction lingers in your heart, how can you perceive the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Five Elders, or the Seven Perfected? Now, you constantly divide self and others, habitually give rise to ignorance. Your hearts are narrow—unable to endure even a single matter. Your capacities are shallow—unable to accommodate even one person. You fail to examine origins, misjudge right and wrong. You rejoice in honor and rage at humiliation. Your aspirations lack steadfastness; your thoughts lack clarity. Your hearts hold no magnanimity; your bodies are prone to indolence. You dismiss small faults as insignificant, yet cling to minor virtues as if they were great. How then can you repay heaven, earth, sovereign, teacher, or ancestral kin?\n\nDisciples, to repay the debts to heaven and earth, you must understand the Dao of heaven and earth, embody their heart, comprehend their principles, and realize their virtue. Never deceive in darkness—sever all false passions. Let wisdom’s light shine universally, embracing all impurities. In loss, accept loss without a trace of self; in hardship, endure hardship without a single selfish thought. Cultivate with unwavering effort, and your realm will radiate clarity. With virtue profound and Dao lofty, even ghosts and spirits will revere you. With spirit clear and wisdom manifest, beings will transform and return to the Dao. Above, you may move the throne of the gods; below, you may command thunder and lightning. In drought, pray for rain to nourish the people; in flood, pray for clear skies to dispel disaster. Demons and evil spirits will flee; malevolent forces will vanish. Above, pray for the eternal stability of the empire and the boundless longevity of the sovereign; below, pray for the land’s prosperity and the people’s joy. Only then can you be said to propagate the ancestral teachings and advance the transformative power of the Dao.\n\nMoreover, consider the toil of your parents: ten months of pregnancy, three years of nursing, countless hardships—an immeasurable debt. As you grow, they hope for your support in old age, for your success to bring honor to the family. The sovereign labors day and night, with the Six Ministries and Nine Courts governing, eliminating evil, nurturing the good, suppressing wrongdoing, and promoting virtue. The teacher awakens the deaf and enlightens the blind, establishing the laws of earth in accord with heaven. The Three Bonds rely on this clarity; the Five Constants depend on this understanding. Distinguishing good from evil, discerning human from beast—how shallow is such virtue?\n\nNow, while at home you fail to honor and support your parents, and in office you cannot serve the state with wisdom. Your clothing relies on the alms of a thousand households, your food depends on the toil of ten thousand commoners. Yet all you do is drift with the current, muddling through each day in idleness, living as a parasite, muttering empty words—neglecting the Dao and its virtue, ignoring precepts and disciplines. Your actions violate every rule; your spirit is dull, your mind scattered. When you ascend the altar to pray for the nation, the gods and spirits do not descend. When you drive out evil and purify pestilence, plagues do not heal. Talismans lose their power, prayers and exorcisms are in vain.\n\nThe base among you, when met with darkness or flood, curse the wind and rail against the rain, resenting heaven and earth. You wander recklessly, act perversely, defy your kin and offend your clan, break the law, and rage at others. Consider the oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, dogs, and swine—all possess the five senses, six apertures, yin and yang, male and female, awareness and intelligence. The only difference is that you, at present, have a mouth capable of speech.\n\nHark! The Vinaya Master then expounded in verse:\n\nCultivate both concentration and wisdom, refine the precepts,\nHeaven and hell become self-evident.\nUnattached as a single thread, radiant and ever-pure,\nAll burdens dissolve, the heart grows clear.\n\nLife’s mandate comes from heaven, not easily bestowed,\nTo transcend birth and death, sincerity is required.\nDeviant paths and strange arts branch in many directions—\nI urge all to awaken to true integrity.\n\nThe Four Gratitudes remain unrepid, the heart filled with shame,\nThe Three Karmas persist, the Dao remains unfulfilled.\nTo repay the Four Gratitudes, first uphold the precepts,\nTo dissolve the Three Karmas, cultivate the true.\n\nUpholding precepts naturally leads to the right path,\nCultivating truth ultimately awakens to the floating life.\nOnce the floating life is seen through and impermanence understood,\nThe Three Karmas are empty, and the Four Gratitudes repaid.\n\nTo leave the worldly and depart from home, seeking to transcend,\nYet clinging to greed, anger, and delusion—how can truth be realized?\nOnly when worldly passions are exhausted does the heart grow pure,\nOnly when innate nature shines forth can the Dao be embraced.\n\nSee through this bodily form—what is truly real?\nObserve all things—what endures forever?\nNot a single thread clings, the three minds are stilled,\nThe Ten Precepts fully observed, one moves in freedom.\n\n**Thirteen: Resolve and Vows**\n\nAll sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas of old saw through worldly affairs—all conditioned things, all appearances—as empty and illusory. They sought to transcend the mundane, to awaken to the mechanism of life and death, retreating deep into the mountains, forgetting the self and risking life, all to seek the supreme Dao.\n\nYet, all of you know only the names of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not their true essence. You all wish to become sages, worthies, and buddhas, yet have not truly resolved to do so. You all desire the fruits of sages, worthies, and buddhas, yet do not cultivate their causes. You all aspire to their station, yet fail to generate their vow-power. Thus, you speak of what you cannot practice, for your mouths are clear but your hearts are not.\n\nThe Dao remains obscure because one has not encountered a true master of the Dao. The Dao remains unpracticed because one has not found a true practitioner of the Way. Those called *Daoists*—how many truly grasp the subtleties of the Dao? Those called *Quanzhen* (Complete Realization)—who among them embodies its reality? No wonder the way of filial piety declines and the ancestral Dao withers.\n\nToday, having taken refuge in the Three Jewels and received the precepts, you may be said to have encountered a true master of the Dao. But you must heed my true words and practice the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—only then can you be called a practitioner of the Way.\n\nAll sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas were once ordinary beings like you, no more eyes or hands than you possess. Yet they resolved to seek the method of transcending the world and to understand the mechanism of life and death. This resolve elevated them a hundredfold above the ordinary, vast beyond measure. Though their bodies remained those of ordinary beings, their minds already embodied the sacred.\n\nA sage does not merely speak of transcending the world—they truly hold it in their hearts and act accordingly. Thus, they are called possessors of great heroic power, bearers of great compassion. The great person, the teacher of heaven and humanity—all arise from extraordinary resolve. Their deeds are never small. With thunderous might, the sword of wisdom slung over their shoulder, their brows raised like flashing lightning; with awe-inspiring presence, the blade of precepts at their neck, their eyes blazing like thunder. The hearts of heretics grow cold, and they flee far away; the courage of evil winds falters, and all wish to take refuge.\n\nThey ascend the nine-petaled lotus throne, rising straight to the Dharma King’s seat. Their words resound with purity, heard as the sacred Dharma-sound, pouring ambrosia upon the crowns of all gods and humans. Their bodies emanate the wondrous fragrance of pure qi, seen by all as universal liberation, turning countless multitudes into rivers of ghee and butter.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, their great resolve fulfilled, they generate vast vows—no notions of self, others, beings, or lifespan. They do not wish to liberate themselves alone but only to liberate others. With the method of self-liberation, they universally liberate all beings, yet do not impose their own path upon others. They take the hearts of the common people as their own.\n\nThe common people are but another name for sentient beings, and sentient beings are of the same kind as oneself. With the method of one’s kind, they save beings of the same kind. Without liberating sentient beings, they do not wish to attain the Dao. As the *Qingjing Jing* states: *“Though called attaining the Dao, there is nothing attained. For the sake of transforming beings, it is called attaining the Dao. Those who awaken to this may transmit the sacred Dao.”*\n\nSages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas are no different from ordinary people. The distinction lies solely in the two words: *public* and *private*. The sage is only impartial and upright, acting for others, not for self. The ordinary person is only biased, deceptive, and selfish, acting for self, not for others.\n\nThe sage is only clear, luminous, deep, and still; the ordinary person is but turbid, dark, flighty, and restless. The sage only employs firmness inwardly to master the self and gentleness outwardly to win over others; the ordinary person only uses softness inwardly to indulge the self and hardness outwardly to blame others. The sage constantly fears his own faults; the ordinary person only reproaches the errors of others. The more the sage takes on tasks, the more meticulous his care; the more the ordinary person shoulders perilous affairs, the more careless and reckless he becomes. The sage, though death has not yet come, first discerns the mechanism of what follows death; the ordinary person, though death stands before him, still only schemes for survival. The sage seeks the Dharma beyond the world, refining the heart through worldly Dharma—serving as a child, he fulfills filial piety; serving as a minister, he fulfills loyalty. The ordinary person not only knows nothing of the Dharma beyond the world, but even of worldly Dharma he remains ignorant—how then would he know loyalty to his lord or filial piety to his parents? Pitiable are these deluded, unawakened beings, who neither understand worldly Dharma nor the Dharma beyond the world. Day after day, they live in drunken stupor and dreamlike death, idly born and recklessly dying, born at dawn and dead by dusk, clinging to life and fearing death, blindly living and blindly dying. They bury their single spark of true numinous principle within a stinking skin-bag, drifting through ten thousand kalpas, ignorant of their own inversion, turning this way and that, changing faces and altering heads, endlessly revolving in the wheel of rebirth—when will they ever emerge?\n\nDisciples, having already received the precepts, you have emerged. Having emerged, you may escape suffering. Escaping suffering, you may depart from the world. Disciples, to escape suffering, first endure suffering. Without enduring suffering, one cannot escape suffering. You must follow the true words of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not chase their empty names. You must establish the resolve of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not merely speak of their fruits. You must plant the roots of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally their rewards will come. You must accumulate the virtue of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally attain their Dao. You must enact the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally realize their station. If one’s actions do not match one’s words, if one’s words exceed one’s deeds, one remains an unprogressive ordinary person. How could such a spiritless person ever attain the Dao of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas?\n\nDisciples! You must set great resolve and make great vows—only then can you depart from the world.\n\nThus I speak these verses:\n\n*\"Disciples, listen with wholehearted intent to what I say:\nResolve can sever the bonds of birth and death.\nFirst endure suffering to master body and mind;\nWhen suffering ends, sweetness comes, and death revives.\n\nSet resolve in the heart to sweep away dust,\nTurning back worldly passions to depart the world.\nInverting the Dipper’s handle, stand towering,\nUnmoved in true emptiness, on the white jade terrace.\n\nDo not wish for active striving, lest you become an external path;\nDo not wish for inaction, lest you stray into heterodox teachings.\nNeither non-being nor being—wish for harmony,\nNeither existence nor non-existence—cultivate awakened illumination.\n\nSet resolve not to be swayed by circumstances;\nThough circumstances be perilous, the heart remains unshaken.\nAble to turn circumstances with the mind’s Dharma,\nWisdom’s sky opens, light pervades all.\n\nSet resolve not to be moved by worldly things;\nIf moved by them, apply true mechanism.\nOnce authority is lost to demonic hands,\nThe wheel turns at their will—too late for regret.\n\nSet resolve not to be hindered by affairs or principles;\nClinging and attachment bind one to appearances.\nWhen principles are clear and affairs penetrated, hindrances dissolve,\nLiberation in true emptiness dispels illusory delusion.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the ear in hearing sounds;\nInwardly listen with the ear-root to perceive the true source.\nGuard against the ear’s leakage, lest true nature be deluded;\nEndure humiliation first by sealing the ears.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the eye in seeing forms;\nContain the light, inwardly illuminating emptiness and whiteness.\nGuard against the eyes’ leakage, lest primordial spirit be scattered;\nWhen the eyes see nothing, the heart’s lord is unified.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the mouth in uttering words;\nAccord with the Dao, speak sparingly, return to spontaneity.\nSpeaking the Dharma without words completes the teaching;\nWithout speech or words, qi naturally flows.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the tongue in tasting flavors;\nKilling and harming life offend gods and ghosts.\nGolden nectar, jade liquid, sweet spring fragrance,\nDivine water, dripping sweet dew—these nourish.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the nose in smelling scents;\nThe human heart stirs thoughts, corrupting true constancy.\nSince liberating from celestial fragrances,\nEach offers the incense of the heart to the heavens above.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the body in reckless movement;\nAlways maintain dignity, abandoning laziness and carelessness.\nFilial impiety and defilement corrupt the numinous root;\nThe Dao-body is solemn, reverent, and respectful.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the heart in opposing things;\nAnger and wrath arise without cause.\nSubdue the heart, follow principle in action,\nHarmonious qi flows, the spirit rejoices.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the will in changing;\nSincerity and integrity are ever present in thought.\nThe heart without dual thoughts, the will without otherness,\nVigilance in solitude, sincerity preserved, return to the one vow.\n\nSet resolve not to be entangled by love’s bonds;\nLove’s bonds entrap like ropes and chains.\nYou must uproot love’s roots entirely,\nSever every sprout to board the Dharma-boat.\n\nSet resolve not to follow reckless and inferior companions;\nInferior friends and reckless followers lack steadfast hearts.\nThey erode the thought of the Dao, lose true mind,\nHow can one walk the path with those who ruin the teaching?\n\nSet resolve not to be misled by blind teachers;\nThe six roots and six dusts—let the heart not abide.\nNot relying on any dharma, perceive the true mechanism;\nExternal paths and side doors cannot ferry the body across.\n\nSet resolve first to receive the initial true precepts;\nUpholding the ten precepts, the heart remains uncorrupted.\nSubduing the heart, guarding the rules, not losing the true,\nThe four great deportments are diligently maintained.\n\nSet resolve to advance and receive the middle ultimate precepts;\nIn secret action, subtle movement, observe self-mastery.\nThe physical body is liberated, becoming the Dharma-body,\nRealizing the three bodies, transcending kalpas beyond.\n\nSet resolve to repay kindness with earnest heart;\nThe four great debts are profound—you must settle them.\nAble to repay deep kindness with body and life,\nFilial children and loyal ministers delight heaven and earth.\n\nSet resolve to cultivate the true by first discarding the false;\nDo not feign deafness or pretend to be mute.\nTrue heart, sincere intent—no deception or concealment;\nEven a little falsity turns one into a donkey or horse.\n\nSet resolve to sever killing, stealing, and lust,\nWine, sex, wealth, anger, greed, ignorance, and wrath.\"*\n\nThe six desires, seven emotions, and three poisons—\nForever sever them, lest they delude the self-mind.\nSet resolve not to cultivate the lesser or middle vehicles,\nFor apart from blessings, retribution will one day end.\nThe Great Vehicle’s pure and liberated Way,\nThe Supreme Vehicle’s vow shall be fulfilled.\nSet resolve to endure hard cultivation without retreat,\nErasing a thousand transgressions and ten thousand sins.\nNature brightens, wisdom flourishes, boundless blessings,\nGreat virtue towering—heaven and earth’s station.\n\nSet resolve to take refuge in precepts, concentration, and wisdom,\nThe unsurpassed Dharma-gate without obstruction.\nUnobstructed, unobscured, great radiance,\nStainless, undefiled, without fear.\nThe unborn, undying, world-transcending Dharma,\nNeither perishing nor increasing, without counterpart.\nWithout form, without action, beyond rank and measure,\nWithout limit, without lord, supremely noble.\nTranscending the three realms,

the mundane.\n\nAll assembled,\n\nThose who have established苦志 and made great vows—today I entrust each one to you, exhorting you again and again. You, the esteemed disciples who uphold the Dao and transform others, the immortal youths who propagate the宗风, the灵童 who continue the Dao’s lineage, the Daoists who break through the heavenly barrier—across the Ten Continents and Three Isles, all have heard, all have come to know.\n\nEach of you must reflect deeply: set your mind early on a vow of cultivation, for that is the true advantage.\n\nHark!\nIf this body is not liberated in this life,\nIn what life will it be liberated?\n\nTime flies like an arrow, days and months shuttle like a loom. From the day you left the household life until now, you have dallied through the years, frittered away the seasons. Your hair is frosted, your skin wrinkled, your teeth loosening, your sinews stiffening, your flesh sagging.\n\nAlas!\nWhen the bones soften, you cannot walk far;\nWhen the blood is depleted, you cannot bear heavy burdens.\nWhen essence withers and the kidneys fail, your eyes grow dim;\nWhen spirit is weary and the heart is wild, your one灵 is unsettled.\nWhen the魂 fades and the魄 swells, your ears droop to listen;\nWhen the stomach is strong but the spleen weak, your appetite wanes.\n\nAll assembled, know this: this body is originally illusory. No matter how sturdy, the day of death will come—only the timing differs. When your ears grow deaf, your eyes dim, your tongue parched, your teeth loose and shaking; when your waist aches, your back bends, your hair whitens, your beard withers; when your sinews harden, your hands and feet grow numb, your resolve weakens, your heart cools and your thoughts chill—these are the summons sent by King Yama, courteously awaiting your early arrival.\n\nDo not cling to the tender-heartedness of old women, the petty trade of tofu vendors, the short-sightedness of dwarves, the delusion of beasts—fixated on the present, heedless of the next life. If today the ghost comes to claim you, you cannot refuse; you must go. Though you call yourselves Daoists, having left the household life to escape the mundane, can you truly evade this fate? Why not see through it clearly and attain liberation early?\n\nTake one step in vigilance, let go and proceed—only then will you be a true man of courage, an extraordinary man. Stand firm in resolve, display your skill, leave the household to cultivate. Otherwise, with timid spirit and feeble countenance, the four great elements—wind, fire, earth, and water—each rush to their own ends, while the faculties of sight, hearing, and wisdom scatter in all directions. Muttering and murmuring, drifting and floating, aimless and adrift, you sink into hell.\n\nAh!\nAll assembled,\nTo cultivate without resolve\nIs like a puppet show—\nWhen the gongs and drums end,\nWhere will you go?\n\nOnly with resolve can one transcend the world;\nWithout it, success is ten thousand times harder.\nOnly by establishing resolve and cultivating the true Dao\nCan the mighty and divine not be taken lightly.\n\n**Fourteen Marks of Verification**\n\nDisciples, if you wish to cultivate the wondrous Dao of purity, non-action, and self-mastery, you must first have resolve and act with self-mastery. If you can achieve self-mastery, the natural Dao will naturally be within it. But if you cannot act with self-mastery, how can you attain the natural?\n\nIf you cannot even complete worldly affairs, how can you achieve self-mastery?\n\nThe immortal masters say:\n*\"To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the human Dao.\nIf the human Dao is not cultivated, the immortal Dao is far indeed.\"*\n\nThe Confucians say:\n*\"First put your household in order, then you may govern the state.\"*\nOrdering the household is like the human Dao; governing the state is like the immortal Dao.\nIf you cannot govern your household, how can you govern the state?\n\nThe Buddhists say:\n*\"You must exhaust the mundane mind; there is no separate sagely understanding.\"*\nThis mundane mind is the principle of the Three Bonds and Five Constants. If you can act in accordance with it, the human Dao is complete, and cultivating immortality is not difficult. Even if you cannot become a sage, an immortal, or a buddha, it will still be easy.\n\nHow, then, to advance in the cultivation of the immortal Dao?\n\nDisciples, since entering the Mystery Gate, learning to be Daoists, taking a master, and receiving transmissions, you have gone to sit in meditation and quiet the mind, believing you have already exhausted the human Dao of the mundane world and that the immortal Dao is within reach. Yet you have not even fully cultivated the reverence due to your master. The oral transmissions you received are confused and indistinct, yet you rush to act without foundation. As soon as you begin, you seek results. After sitting for two or three days without seeing any signs, you abandon it. Then you seek another master, receive a few words, and sit again. This fleeting desire for the Dao lasts no more than two or three days before you again crave results, your thoughts restless and unceasing. With such a deluded mind and shallow wisdom, your meager cultivation is in vain. Though you think and ponder endlessly, your spirit cannot settle—it is all but a dream. After sitting for twenty or thirty years, you remain an ordinary mortal, unaware even at the hour of death.\n\nAlas! You have wasted time, squandered the years, grasping at the moon in water, plucking flowers in a mirror—easy to imagine, but where is the ready-made immortal?\n\nPitiful are those misled by blind masters, deceived by heterodox teachings. I will say no more of this. I only urge you to reflect deeply on the chapter of strict precepts and the resolve to repay kindness. First correct your thoughts, eliminate afflictions and ignorance. Single-mindedly turn toward the Dao, take refuge in the Three Treasures, recite the true scriptures, and follow the precepts in conduct. Sit in the Ten Directions Hall for a hundred days: maintain dignified appearance, stabilize the physical form, keep all matters orderly, and hold the body upright. Then, with reverent movement and prostration, invoke the true master, vow not to pursue the lesser or middle vehicles, and with sincere devotion, seek to hear the wondrous Dao of the supreme, most true, great vehicle—pure, liberated, and natural. Only when you awaken to life and death and forever escape the cycle of rebirth may you receive the Ten Precepts of the Initial Truth.\n\nGood assembly, how is it that the Dao takes the transformation of one’s qi and disposition as foremost? Only after hearing the Dao may one ascend the meditation cushion, still the mind, and quiet thoughts, cutting off deliberation and forgetting emotions. Apply effort to the ground of the heart, wholly casting aside worldly affairs. Carefully contemplate the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Ultimate received in transmission, penetrating them thoroughly to comprehend that the great matter of karmic conditions lies within the body, not outside the mind. In secret, engage in earnest inquiry, perfecting wondrous practice until it is complete, and verify it against the natural state of emptiness. At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, advance yet further. Do not distort the crooked into the straight, nor force arguments from ignorance.\n\nYet some, having recognized a few places of practice or obtained a single hermitage, taking in one or two disciples, become self-satisfied and arrogant, no longer holding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom in their hearts. They neither emulate the discipline masters of strict deportment nor harmonize with fellow practitioners. Illiterate and half-witted, their own transformation incomplete, they falsely exalt themselves, claiming to others, “We practice the supreme vehicle’s work.” They take up a fan, scribbling a few alchemical phrases, hang a pouch with several alchemical scriptures, and fill gourds with all manner of herbs, deceiving laypeople for silver. They boast of receiving extraordinary transmissions of elixir formulas from immortals, using the silver to buy wine and meat. Their mouths spew reckless words, yet they grasp nothing of pulse diagnosis or yin-yang principles, casually picking up a few formulas and falsely claiming merit. All day they prattle on, discoursing on heaven and earth, running east and west in search of clothing and food.\n\nThey corrupt the methods of the Supreme Dao and sully the reputation of the Perfect Realization. These law-destroying disciples, these precept-breaking practitioners—seeds of sin—will, when their evil fills to the brim, face the judgment of celestial tribunals and fall forever into hell. How lamentable! How grievous!\n\nThere is yet another sort: those newly entered into the Daoist gate, their aspirations small and vows narrow. They seek only seated meditation for ease, unwilling to subdue the heart and master the qi, to sever attachments and cut off passions. Clinging to the mud and water, they remain entangled in form and hold fast to deluded thoughts. All they desire is the verification of their practice, moving qi and shifting essence, fixating on apertures until they fall into confusion, mistaking the thief for their own child, long deluded without awakening. Refusing to humbly seek confirmation, to observe, inquire, and investigate, their illusions grow ingrained until they become irredeemable. Many thus harm themselves and lose their lives, falling into the cycle of rebirth. They take the boundless Great Dao and treat it as a thing of flesh and blood, mistaking the consciousness for the primordial spirit, allowing it to turn them about—how then can they ever transcend life and death?\n\nDisciples, you must heed my words: sweep away at once all these heterodox paths, deviant methods, and divergent branches. Cast them aside with bold resolve. Temper body, heart, and intent within the mandate of heaven and the nature of your being. Do not covet immediate results; seek only the awakening of the heart. With resolve, press forward on this path—even if it be a wall of bronze or iron, you must break through. Naturally, there will come a day of emergence, a moment when the fruit ripens and the stem falls away, when the heart-mind suddenly awakens in luminous clarity, penetrating heaven and earth.\n\nIf your blessings are meager and your karmic conditions shallow, you must accumulate virtue and merit, advancing with courage and vigor. Should you fail to awaken in this life, you will awaken in the next; if not in the next, then in some future life among thousands—yet you will not fail to awaken eventually. Set this vow, and your resolve for enlightenment will never waver, age after age. You will surely become a sage of great compassion and vast vows, ultimately attaining the Dao.\n\nYet worldly fortune is easily cultivated, while spiritual fortune is difficult to nurture. If you are resolved to follow the path of transcendence, it is the true Dao—not that of alchemical refinement seeking immortality, which is but an external path. Such practitioners are but ghosts guarding tombs, lingering for millennia. The boundless, tranquil, and true Dao of the Wuji does not seek quick results or immediate merit. It does not fix upon three or nine years but takes seeing the nature as its essence. Daily, there are signs of efficacy; moment by moment, transformation occurs: the mouth is moistened with sweetness, the limbs grow firm, the head assumes a spherical form, the heavenly gate opens in the brain, fire steams within the abdomen, and the bones of the body resound. Yet these are but the achievements of middle and lower cultivation. Step by step, you must return to the Dao-body.\n\nFor the Dao is fundamentally emptiness, its essence fundamentally nothingness—hence it is called Wuji. If your practice loses its proper return and you take what is presently attained as true attainment, you fall into heterodoxy and external paths. Thus, a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles.\n\nAs for those who cling to names and grasp at forms, vainly guarding their cauldrons, establishing their tripods, ascending lead at the hour of zi and descending mercury at the hour of wu, advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally, practicing according to the hexagrams and seeking verification by the hour—those who do not recognize the return to the Dao-body—all these are but lesser paths of the lower vehicle.\n\nThe wondrous Dao of tranquil non-action, by contrast, is the natural path of return, vastly different from these. Consider, for example, the *Huangjing*: when you first arouse the heart and set your resolve, vowing to transcend the mundane, this initial aspiration is like the Jade Maiden releasing fragrance. As soon as the heart’s incense is released, it revives the six paths of rebirth, and all who hear this fragrance are universally delivered. This release of fragrance is the practice; this hearing of fragrance is the effect.\n\nOr consider the Jade Emperor radiating light: it gathers all heavens and earths, all Wuji worlds, into its illumination, as if infinite mirrors reflecting one another—this is the effect. Cutting through obstacles is the practice; the seventeen lights and thirty kinds of merit are the effect. The *Merit Chapter* and the *Karmic Response Chapter* are the karmic effects of the sutra-chanter.\n\nIf you were once frivolous and restless, your mouth never still, uttering only reckless words; your hands never ceasing, ever in haste—\n\nFeet never still, merely wandering blindly; sitting never still, only slouching askew; sleep never settled, the body tossing and turning; eyes darting all around—now gazing east, now peering west—striding forth like a gust of wind, no semblance of the conduct of one who cultivates the Dao.\n\nLike an ox yet to have its nose pierced, a horse without bridle, not following the central and upright path. Now, having received the precepts and donned the robe and headcloth, carrying the alms bowl and wearing the shoes, the body assumes the appearance of one who is wholly true. Following others in their affairs, listening to their words and observing their ways, you transform your former coarse and hasty demeanor into one of composed and courteous conduct—this is the practice of upholding the precepts. Transmuting your temperament and adopting the countenance of the Dao, so that others, upon seeing you, feel reverence—this is the outward manifestation of upholding the precepts.\n\nIf you can uphold the wondrous conduct, refine your thoughts to align with the Dao, seeking only to clarify the mind and perceive your nature, not chasing after effects, worrying only that your practice is insufficient, not that effects will fail to come—then, when the great timing matures, you will awaken completely. But if your practice is not steadfast, if your mind wavers between two or three intentions, if you falter in doubt, then the heart is not true and the spirit not efficacious; thoughts are not pure and qi does not gather. With spirit adrift and qi floating, the heart’s resolve unsteady—from where could effects arise?\n\nNow that you have great aspirations to escape the wheel of rebirth, first expand your capacity, focus on your practice, and set effects aside—then it will be wondrous. It is like a skilled physician administering medicine, ensuring harmony; an inept physician, seeking quick results, disregards the root, chasing immediate effects. Though near-term effects may appear, the primordial qi is ultimately harmed, the original source momentarily unrecovered, and myriad complications arise. The patient, unaware, regrets it too late.\n\nDisciples, if you truly practice day and night according to the precepts, follow the rituals in cultivation, constantly rouse yourselves, and ceaselessly inquire—how could effects not manifest? Yet even if your chest feels open and your vision clear, you must still subdue your will and humble your heart, drawing near to those of virtue to verify and ascend to higher understanding.\n\nNever become attached to the notion of self, forgetting others; nor attached to others, forgetting the self. With no duality in the heart and the four illusions emptied, the effects of virtue and fortune will naturally follow.\n\nDisciples, the cultivation of the Dao depends entirely on a single heart. If the heart is true and the resolve sincere, the Dao becomes intimate. When thoughts cease and the heart is empty and still—where in practice will efficacy not arise?\n\nThe heart must be cold, thoughts must turn to ash—from cold ash, a mighty sprout bursts forth. True fire and qi illuminate all things, like the sun radiating brilliance in the sky. Steadfastly uphold the precepts in practice, and in samadhi, the effects of wisdom’s light will be known. Within, a millet grain contains heaven and earth; to speak of it to others is folly.\n\nDisciples, heed these teachings: how can one with a coarse heart and floating qi become an immortal? Swiftly follow the precepts to cultivate merit and conduct, with firm resolve and unwavering heart, severing wayward thoughts. Cultivate in seclusion, sitting silently in the mountains, closing the mountain gate—let the heart not be coarse. With the four illusions emptied and the heart stilled, the Dao harmonizes and flows.\n\nNow I reveal this celestial mechanism to you: the manifestation of merit lies solely in the heart’s application. Diligence in practice and austerity yield abundant efficacy; every moment, every instant, be steadfast and deep. Within the heart’s stillness, reflect inwardly—let no one else know even half. Do not cling to the mind’s inner realm, for that is the moment of great awakening.\n\nThe deluded cat guarding its burrow stirs ignorance; vain thoughts conceive and give birth to the sacred infant. When will the Golden Lord ride the azure tiger? Where does the Wooden Mother mount the white dragon? Atop the crown, the Three Flowers radiate brilliantly; within the body, the Five Qi surge powerfully. Pitiable are those who do not recognize the true message, their spirit terrace blocked and nature obstructed.\n\nI tell you: do not slander the precepts as lowly—they are the foundation for entering the Dao without effort. Like a raft poled through the waves to cross the sea, like a ladder raised in the void to ascend to heaven. Do not boast of your own arrogance, nor slander others to debate right and wrong. If you refuse to accept this, that is your choice—why create obstacles to sow doubt in others?\n\nOnly when your lips praise and your heart rejoices are you one who promotes the mystery and protects the teaching. If you generate slander, you will incur heavenly retribution—karmic consequences have always been true and certain.\n\nHark! Why not be a good person? Why not speak good words? Why not cultivate the great Dao? Instead, you scheme and contrive, failing to follow the precepts and samadhi in practice—how can you inherit the robe and bowl of the Most High? Without cultivating both merit and wisdom, how can you attain liberation of body and mind? Without understanding the principles, acting recklessly—how can you unravel the mechanism? Without removing obstacles and ignorance, how can your heart’s capacity expand?\n\nMany transgressions are worse than few; reckless speech is worse than silence. The supreme Dao is not like heterodox paths—how can you lightly chatter and wag your tongue? Everywhere, secret teachings are sold for coin—karmic consequences, high and low, are clear. If you remain deluded and unenlightened, you will face death without life. Reborn as swine or sheep, your karmic retribution will be slaughter at the hands of others. How can you escape the unseen and seen realms of heaven and earth? The Three Primes and Five Offerings will examine you.\n\nKnow that the sun and moon, yin and yang, are not a muddled darkness. Naturally, the delusion of such a person is evident—disciples, be aware and do not slander what is right. With profound compassion, I exhort you repeatedly: take refuge early in the Three Thousand Great Precepts. With no obstacles in the heart, right and wrong are empty—whether sitting, lying, walking, or practicing, all is unobstructed. From this day forth, the flames of karmic fire dissolve into empty illusions, and the radiance of night reports the dawn in the Dharma hall.\n\nWithin precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, liberation is born; uphold the precepts with sincere resolve, and you will traverse and verify the profound. If you doubt that the precepts are deceptive transmissions, heaven will despise you and condemn you to have your tongue torn out. When a learner awakens without doubt or confusion, floating clouds disperse, and the wind clears all.\n\nBeyond the kalpas, you will wander freely and at ease, suddenly severing the entangling vines of distraction.\n\nFollowing the ritual to honor the Heavenly Worthy, the voice does not rise, the head does not tilt. Within and without, the spirit remains unwavering—though still in mortal form, the Dao is already perfected.\n\nPerfection in the Dao is neither easy nor difficult; whether upholding or loosening the precepts lies within the heart. From life to death, from death to life, one emerges through precepts and samadhi. Once having taken refuge, do not neglect the precepts as mere obstinacy.\n\n**Fifteen Methods for Preserving Life and Prolonging Existence**\n\nDisciples, when I previously took the high seat, I repeatedly exhorted you to rouse courage, to vow great vows, and to seek early clarity on life and death. You must not diminish your resolve, nor follow the Two Vehicles’ path of clinging to life and fearing death. Now, I speak again of the mind-method for preserving life and prolonging existence—does this not amount to duplicitous speech, deluding sentient beings?\n\nDisciples, the mind-method for preserving life and prolonging existence that I speak of is not attachment to the physical form, nor mere talk of essence and qi, urging you to preserve post-heavenly lifespan or extend this transient existence. What I now call *preserving life* refers to the mandate of heaven as nature, safeguarding the life bestowed by heaven, abiding in ease while awaiting its fulfillment.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"the mandate of heaven as nature\"—the *wisdom-life* of the Buddhist school, the *original destiny-star* of the Daoist gate. This *life* is the longevity that does not perish in death. As the *Vajracchedikā* states: *\"How does one attain long life? As the indestructible vajra-body.\"* Moreover, the mandate of heaven is non-dual; cultivate body and mind to await its realization. To exhaust principle and fulfill nature so as to reach life is the essential principle of establishing destiny.\n\nWhat I speak of as *prolonging* is not curing illness to extend years or achieving immortality in death. Rather, it is the true nature that remains unbroken through ten thousand kalpas, the Dharma-body that endures through ancient ages, the embodiment that nurtures all beings—no ordinary form. If you point to the skin-bag and cultivate it, you may live a few more years, but death will only come later; this is not the true Dao.\n\nWhat I now call *preserving life through cultivation* is to equalize heaven and earth and harmonize with the ten thousand things. Though heaven and earth undergo change and movement, my original nature knows no change. Though the ten thousand things have ends and limits, my original nature knows no end. Though heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things pass through kalpas, cycles, and epochs, my serene and constant true nature—lucid and unobscured—transcends form, free from destruction, decay, or alteration.\n\nThis is the life preserved, the existence prolonged. It is the true and constant Dao of heavenly principle flowing ceaselessly, the unending cycle of life. This passage reveals words spoken only out of necessity. If one with clear eyes awakens to the profound seat of Dharma-teaching, silent and soundless, they will grasp the message within.\n\nThe boundless Great Dao encompasses heaven and earth, leaving nothing behind, present at all times, inherent in all things, all-encompassing. In daily life, every moment is the Dao: seeing and hearing, walking and standing, sitting and lying, eating and resting, advancing and retreating, dressing and dining, in clear or cloudy skies, in cold or heat—everywhere the Dao.\n\nYet how is it that you remain bound by material obstructions and constrained by qi, unaware in your daily lives? Within emptiness, the luminous responds clearly, yet before echoes and shadows, you stumble blindly. Today, I rely on the patriarchs of the Three Teachings, their compassion for universal salvation, their vow to benefit beings—thus I cannot refrain from speaking at length to you.\n\nTherefore, I universally proclaim to all beings: there is no second method. If there were two, it would not be the path of the Great Vehicle’s perfect awakening. This single spark of your spiritual nature is another name for *wisdom-life*; originally, it is one thing. This *wisdom-life* is but a provisional name for the substance of the Dao, fundamentally of one source. Though they emerge together, they differ; thus, they embrace the Three Teachings while bubbling forth as one.\n\nThis *wisdom-life* manifests moment to moment, yet you do not see its form; it hides instant by instant, yet you do not know its whereabouts. It preaches the Dharma day by day, yet you do not hear its voice.\n\nAre you not like fools searching for fire by the light of a lamp, or riding an ox in quest of the ox itself? My disciples, why must you strive to preserve it? I fear you do not recognize this *wisdom-life* as the sacred treasure it is. I know you well—at every turn, you resist and defy it, not as seasoned practitioners who see their nature, nor as elders who grasp the mind’s intent.\n\nMoreover, even when you encounter it, you do not employ it. And when you do attempt to use it, you cannot wield it fully. The moment this spark of life departs, it is as though the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has left the Dharma throne, the Yellow Emperor has lost the Mystic Pearl, Iron Crutch Li has mislaid his staff, or Zhang Guolao his blue donkey. Mouths remain but cannot speak; hands grope at empty nostrils. Hearts exist yet lack the aperture—bereft of subtlety, they vanish into obscurity.\n\nNow, I do this to fulfill the sacred intent of the Primordial One’s teaching and to honor the great virtue of Qiuzu’s compassion for all life. Thus, I pour the nectar of awakening upon you, urging you to swiftly discern the wondrous principle of preserving life and prolonging existence.\n\nHave you not heard of the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture for Dispelling Disaster and Protecting Life*? If you, my disciples, can truly awaken to this sutra, you will perpetuate your *wisdom-life* endlessly, generation after generation without cease. Yet if you merely recite its name with your lips as an offering, this is not true awakening. Those who make such offerings recite and depart, unable to savor its depths.\n\nDoes the sutra not say: “All you beings, since time without beginning, have allowed the mind to be enslaved by form and thoughts to drift with circumstances. Ever entangled in love and delusion without respite, you drift upon the river of attachment and sink into the sea of desire. Clinging to illusory forms and appearances, you obscure your original face. The Dao is formless, yet you grasp it as form; the Dao is not empty, yet you cling to emptiness. Deluded by the interplay of form and emptiness, confused by existence and non-existence, you cannot attain clarity. How then can you escape the path of birth and death, leap beyond the karma of cyclic existence?\n\nOnly those who know emptiness yet do not abide in emptiness, who know form yet do not cling to form, who are free from the view of emptiness and detached from all doubts and leaks—only such persons can purify the six senses and sever all obstructions. This is the essence of my teaching, the Dharma I expound and entrust to you. The sutra is called *Protecting Life to Attain the Dharma*, for the universal salvation of beings, to propagate the teaching in the world and circulate its recitation. Those who recite and transmit it will be guarded by flying heavenly kings, vajra warriors who shatter evil, Dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverers from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts—countless hosts who shield this sutra, enabling all to depart from defilements.”\n\nO assembly! How can this bodily form know emptiness yet not abide in emptiness, know form yet not cling to form, perceive the Dharma of non-emptiness, penetrate all barriers, and enter the gate of myriad wonders? Therefore, I first elucidate the sutra’s profound truths to safeguard the *wisdom-life* of this great assembly.\n\nThe ancestral masters, in their compassion, fear that you, my disciples, will mistake this fleshly form for your true self. You must abide in non-emptiness within emptiness, in non-form within form, in non-existence within existence, in non-emptiness within emptiness—lest this illusory, blood-and-flesh body enslave you, tossing you endlessly to and fro, deluding you into losing the true teaching and forfeiting the treasure of wisdom.\n\nThus, this sutra urges each of you to protect your spiritual root, to nurture your original essence. When the root is firm, the Dao arises. The noble one delights in Heaven, thus preserving life; untouched by premature death or longevity, this is prolonging existence. The noble one serves Heaven, thus the *wisdom-life* endures. Hence, generation after generation flows unceasingly, nurturing and circulating, attaining the indestructible vajra body and realizing the true, untainted Dharma-body.\n\nO assembly! The Three Caverns and Four Treasuries, the Five Thousand and Three Hundred True Writings—all point to prolonging life and preserving destiny, only then can one transcend kalpas and rise above the dust. Clinging to appearances is not preserving life; true emptiness is prolonging existence. *Wisdom-nature* does not depart from *wisdom-life*; *wisdom-light* is the *wisdom-lamp*. If you wish the *wisdom-light* to shine constantly, the *wisdom-life* must abide in steadfastness. Abiding in unceasing stillness, the lamp’s light naturally remains bright. Awakening to the true suchness, the lamp shines perpetually, illuminating and guiding all beings. The light is not truly light to be seen; the brightness is not truly brightness to be named. It is merely the inherent nature of life, provisionally called light and clarity.\n\nForm and emptiness, birth and death in the world—through emptiness and form, life is preserved and existence prolonged. Prolonging existence is transcending the kalpa; transcending the kalpa, what death is there? What name remains? Beings, only because of deluded wisdom, drift and sink through kalpas without end. The *wisdom-lamp* and *wisdom-light* illuminate universally—awaken swiftly to the causes of discipline!\n\nNow, I offer the wondrous method of preservation and prolongation: in the stillness of emptiness, I point it out to you all.\n\nO disciples, my disciples! The sutra says: “If you cannot see it when using it, life may be preserved; if you see it yet cannot use it, existence may be prolonged. Only by extinguishing the moving mind while not extinguishing the illuminating mind can existence be prolonged; only by extinguishing the abiding mind and concentrating the empty mind can life be preserved. To prolong existence is to ensure the *wisdom-life* remains unbroken, and the great elixir is accomplished; to preserve life is to realize non-birth, and the great cinnabar is achieved.”\n\n“Life does not abide in constancy; if one cultivates the Dao well, one attains it; if not, one loses it. Receiving life from Heaven, one must heed Heaven’s luminous mandate. Though Zhou is an ancient state, its mandate is ever renewed.” These are the true principles of preservation and prolongation, the great Dao of establishing destiny.\n\nDisciples, if you can awaken to this point, you have grasped the wonder. Now, I do not begrudge this supreme treasure—I empty my bag and overturn my sack, revealing the profound mystery. Here are four verses for the assembly to ponder deeply:\n\n*Life’s brevity or length is destined,*\n*Coming and going in birth—no birth at all.*\n*To prolong or preserve, seek no other method;*\n*The Dharma returns to no-Dharma, the city of the Dharma King.*\n\n*Jade Garden Altar Scripture, Lower Scroll: Sixteen Expansions of the Teaching and Propagation of the Dao*\n\nDisciples, what this poor Daoist expounded yesterday from the high seat speaks of the Dao-body as non-action and the Dharma-body as reality itself. Yet you must understand that the Dao-body does not lie beyond the ordinary body, and the Dharma-body resides within the physical form. The physical body is fortified by the adornments of external, active virtue; the Dharma-body is purified by the adornments of internal, inactive virtue. When both inner and outer are cleansed, and the two are awakened to, then the spirit is liberated—attaining the supreme, unsurpassable, indestructible true emptiness, the great luminosity, the great perfection, the invincible. All spirits pay homage, thunder is commanded, the Three Realms are upheld, the Five Emperors receive and escort, and wisdom penetrates all. This is not something cultivated through active virtue.\n\nDisciples, secure essence and nurture qi, and qi will settle while essence congeals. Naturally still the fire and return the wind, and essence transforms into qi, steaming the four great elements and harmonizing the myriad spirits. When true fire burns without smoke, qi is pure; when spirit-water does not leak, the spirit is still. Pure qi transforms into spirit; still spirit merges with emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the original true returns, and the nine refinements and seven reversions restore life to its root. Returning to the root is the establishment of life and the preservation of true nature. When true nature is preserved, the Dao-body manifests. When the Dao-body manifests, the Dharma-body appears.\n\nDisciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within activity as non-action, the Dharma-body cultivated within non-use as use. The physical body has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has a wisdom-life. Lifespan is bestowed by Heaven, not by oneself, so the physical body undergoes the cycles of rebirth and death, the revolutions of kalpas. Wisdom-life is determined by me, not by Heaven, so the Dharma-body wields sovereign power, liberated and unobstructed.\n\nDisciples, the lifespan of the physical body is finite, and fixed karma is inescapable—when Heaven decrees death, one cannot but die. The wisdom-life of the Dharma-body is infinite, its spiritual powers vast, eternally realizing non-birth, thus attaining true longevity. Disciples, even if the physical body endures for ten thousand years, it is merely called a demon, not the Dao. The Dharma-body comes and goes yet remains constant—“Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening” is the true saying of the utmost sage. The Dharma-body does not perish in death, hence it is called long life. The physical body dies and dies again, hence it is impermanent.\n\nDisciples, if you awaken to the Dharma-body, even those of short, impermanent lives may attain longevity. If you cling to the physical body as form, even those of boundless longevity fall into the cycle of rebirth. The essential secret in a single word: see through the physical body, empty all cares, cultivate with true sincerity, unstained by a speck of dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be trapped within the physical body; instead, see through the physical body to liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the great turning of the Dharma-wheel, the flourishing of the Dao’s destiny?\n\nNow, in expounding and propagating the Dao through filial piety, all depends on the constant turning of the Dharma-wheel. To restore the ancestral Dao to radiance, if the Dharma-body of beings is not illuminated, who will come to its protection? As it is said: if the teaching is not propagated, the Dao will not be clear; if the Dao is not clear, the Dharma cannot be practiced; if the Dharma cannot be practiced, the Dao cannot be propagated. The utmost sage has said: “Humans can propagate the Dao; the Dao does not propagate humans.” You must each recognize yourselves as propagators of the Dao, practice the methods of propagating the Dao, and expound the mechanisms of illuminating the Dao. Then how can the Dao’s lineage not flourish, or the ancestral wind decline?\n\nIn my youth, I studied little and did not widely read the books. Unversed in Confucianism and Buddhism, I foolishly sought the learning of the Dao, wandering within the realm for decades, determined to fathom its source. What I sought was the seeking of my own innate knowledge; what I questioned was the questioning of my original wisdom-nature. After long inner seeking, innate knowledge alone revealed itself on the cinnabar terrace; after deep inner questioning, wisdom-nature gave birth to clarity in the empty chamber. With an inner host, why fear receiving guests or responding to visitors? With a true origin within, I desired to propagate the teaching and spread the Dao.\n\nDisciples, I am dull in literary matters and ashamed before the jade cases of the Three Caverns. Having read few alchemical classics, I had no means to transcribe the true immortal’s precious secrets. For my nature is lazy, fond of leisure and stillness. Constantly cultivating the wisdom-life, I delved deeply into the subtle and imperceptible, casting aside all affairs to embrace the true origin alone. Where would I find the time to read Confucian books or study alchemical classics? Thus, even now, I am unskilled in writing, clumsy in speech, and can only roughly and crudely speak these utmost true words and most secret mysteries—unrevealed esoteric teachings—for you to hear.\n\nYet the Dao is fundamentally wordless—why expound it? The scriptures are originally unlearned—why open a hall? The teaching upholds non-action—why trouble oneself with much ado? This Dao is everyone’s share; one cannot be separated from it for even a moment. Whether in the world or in the Dao, one may awaken and inquire—why must one leave the world, seek teachers, or find friends? Only because this matter of life and death remains unresolved in the heart do we hunger and search for food, rush east and west, to the ends of the sea and sky, seeking a method to restore life to its root.\n\nFortunately, the Jade Purity, Highest Purity, and Supreme Purity transmitted the scriptures, expounded the Dharma, established teachings, and opened altars, propagating the lineage to this day. Even the Confucians—Master Zhou, the two Cheng Masters, Master Zhang, and Master Zhu—received the secrets of the sacred scriptures and elucidated the essentials of the mind’s method. Then there are the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, and *Heart Sūtra*—the true principles of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and shedding desire. The Three Teachings share one aim: the single Dao of nature and life, all compassionately delivering beings from distress and saving them from suffering.\n\nNow, I have been humbly listed among the disciples of Master Qiu, following the example to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receive and expound them. That is all.\n\nStudents, I am but an ordinary mortal, devoid of supernatural powers. I know only the work of daily cultivation—teaching others to awaken—not for those in the Daoist gate who merely observe precepts and uphold discipline. Unlike those who peddle secrets, beg for alms, idle their days, eat without labor, and clothe themselves without toil—how could such men ever comprehend the matters of life and death? Thus, I rouse my spirit with resolve, devising a plan for universal deliverance. Above, I revive the teachings; below, I benefit all beings. This is fundamentally for the sake of sentient beings, not for myself.\n\nOur Dragon Gate lineage began with Ancestor Qiu in the Yuan dynasty, flourishing in the mysteries and spreading transformation. Four hundred years have passed, yet men of lofty attainment are rare, and those of steadfast aspiration are hard to encounter. In this declining age of the Dao, I unexpectedly devoted thirty years to upholding precepts, observing the rules, seeking truth through inquiry, and visiting masters. Heaven aligned with my resolve: I met my teacher at Wangwu, received the Dharma at the Nine Palaces, and have practiced for over twenty years. Heaven opened the Dao’s fortune, and I rejoiced to encounter this imperial dynasty, this flourishing era—where gentry and officials embrace goodness, scholars and merchants delight in giving, and those of like mind, bound by karmic affinity, meet the time to return and cultivate. Thus, I established an altar and administered precepts in the capital. For eight cycles of cold and heat, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Those of the feathered and secular realms, bound by affinity, all took refuge in precepts and samādhi, entering directly into the wondrous Dao of pure emptiness.\n\nThis poor Daoist relies solely on this spark of spiritual insight, silently moving with utmost sincerity. Moved by heavenly grace, I have met with true opportunity, presumptuously ascending the Dharma seat and recklessly acting as a precept-master. As for grandly propagating the mysteries of the Daoist gate and universally expanding the Dharma arena—this is the deepest aspiration of this poor Daoist.\n\nStudents, do not heed those who sow doubt and slander, stubbornly clinging to their meditation cushions, sealing their throats and gritting their teeth, feigning the appearance of the Dao—only to mislead themselves in the end. Such people speak of \"constant response, constant stillness.\" Response to what? They cannot even tend to their own lives—how could they tend to the lives of others?\n\nHear these words:\nThe precepts and scriptures emerge from the *Daoist Canon*;\nTransmitting precepts by the liturgy is no falsehood.\nOnly to propagate the teachings and deliver all beings—\nI pray you, deluded disciples, cease your slander.\n\nI urge you, fellow cultivators, to open your hearts and broaden your capacity,\nEndure humiliation and cultivate truth to expand the teachings.\nCultivate both samādhi and wisdom, deepening your merit and virtue,\nUniversally deliver all beings from the ocean of suffering.\n\nThose who receive precepts must first sever obstacles;\nWhen obstacles are removed, radiance shines bright.\nWhy fear your wisdom-nature lacks brilliance?\nOnly fear its light stretching ten thousandfold.\n\nConceal its flame to preserve life, and wisdom will grow;\nAbide not in prolonging life, but depart from illusory forms.\nEmbrace purity, nurture simplicity, and study non-action—\nThe wisdom-life will extend, returning to the vast and boundless.\n\nIf you stubbornly cling to the physical form,\nUnaware that when the body dies, who attains immortality?\nRefusing to deliver others, seeking only self-liberation—\nHow could immortal masters ever deliver us?\n\nReady-made robes, effortless meals—\nWho provides for each mouth and body?\nHow can the kindness of Ancestors Mi and Qiu ever be repaid?\nA single drop of water, a vast wave—\nThe cries of the *Avīci* hell echo in response.\n\nDeceiving others with offerings for ease and comfort,\nWarm clothes, full bellies, never thirsting—\nCrafting sweet words, claiming enlightenment,\nPromising to ascend and carry you away.\n\nPatrons, hearing such words, offer even more diligently,\nFoolishly chasing gold in the water.\nHow many ordinary people can awaken on their own?\nIn what year, what month, will they ascend?\n\nThose of wise awakening harbor no jealousy;\nIn stillness, they practice non-action and first liberate themselves.\nIn activity, they propagate the Dao to liberate others—\nTen thousand words, a thousand sayings, all for a single awakening.\n\nA single awakening, bound to universal deliverance—\nUniversal deliverance requires a sincere and steadfast heart.\nThe Dao flourishes, the teachings expand, the ancestral wind soars,\nLiberation in true emptiness harmonizes the nature of the mind.\n\n---\n\nSeventeen Generations of Deliverance\n\nStudents, the propagation of the teachings and expansion of the Dao that I speak of is not for myself, nor even for the sake of the teachings—it is solely to embody the Dao and emulate Heaven, delivering all beings. If the sages of the Three Teachings had not acted for the sake of sentient beings, why would they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, proclaimed altars, revealed truths, and tirelessly extended compassionate means?\n\nStudents, the Confucian gate honors the Most Sage Former Teacher.\nHis virtue matched the Supreme Ultimate, his Dao perfected the Great Achievement;\nNeither obstinate nor inflexible, neither self nor others;\nHe edited the *Book of Documents*, established music, expounded the *Yi*, and upheld ritual.\nEverywhere, he enacted the transformative power of the *Spring and Autumn*;\nIn every place, he elucidated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness.\nHis Dao was transmitted to Zeng and Meng, bearing the weight of a single shoulder;\nHe became the teacher of ten thousand generations of Confucians, the master of instruction for all people.\nHad Zeng and Meng not received the transmission in the Zhou dynasty, had the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi not elucidated and upheld it in the Song, how could we have what we have today?\n\nThe Buddhist gate traces back to the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha of the Western Regions.\nHe practiced austerities on Snow Mountain, relinquished his kingdom and left his family,\nSubdued body and mind, perfected merit and conduct;\nThe five aggregates were empty, the six senses purified.\nHe manifested wondrous forms, transforming and appearing in the ten directions.\nIn the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, a golden man entered his dream.\nThe White Horse came from the West, transmitting 5,048 scrolls—\nThe *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra*—\nThe teachings flowed into the eastern lands.\nHis name was the Tathāgata, the Dharma was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch.\nVenerating the golden immortals of Brahmanic monasteries,\nThe Mahāyāna’s compassionate and supreme honor.\n\nIf not for our Buddha’s transmission of the scriptures, how could we today universally revere golden bodies and arhats?\n\nThe Daoist gate was established by the Three Pure Ones, vast and indescribable, towering and unfathomable.\nThe scriptures are wondrous and profound, transmitted from sage to sage.\nManifesting bodies to expound the Dharma, polishing the mind through kalpas.\nDelivering beings from the sea of suffering, saving the world through the ages.\nThis is the transmission of the Three Officials, the opening of altars by the Five Poles.\nAncestor Lü of Pure Yang, master of the Three Teachings,\nIssuer of the Five Thunder commands,\nAppearing everywhere, opening the mysteries in every place—\nGreat compassion, great benevolence, great filial piety,\nForsaking fame and merit, leaving behind the incense of practice.\n\nHe transmitted to our Ancestor Qiu, who diligently cultivated the Dao and preserved benevolence,\nBowing to the *Book of the Phoenix* at the imperial palace;\nEstablishing the lineage, transmitting precepts,\nReviving the pure precepts of Dragon Gate.\nThrough a thousand hardships and ten thousand sufferings,\nHe vowed to deliver all beings.\nHonored as the Perfected Lord of Eternal Spring,\nRepeatedly revered as the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Response.\nIlluminating all dharma realms,\nAll equally partake in his vast grace.\n\nCultivating merit and establishing virtue, manifesting all manner of divine powers—\nAll for the deliverance of beings, that all may together attain the great Dao.\nDisciples, those who deliver others must first deliver themselves with utmost sincerity and urgency.\nNow that the teachings are in decline and the profound Dao hidden, it is precisely because this great malady has not been eradicated.\n\nWhy has the great Dao waned and the teachings grown feeble?\nDisciples, it is due to the eight-character root of grave transgression within our Quanzhen tradition:\n*\"Unable to deliver oneself, yet seeking to deliver others.\"*\nThis has corrupted the very foundation of the Quanzhen teaching.\n\nDisciples, if you expound the teachings yet fail to practice them yourselves,\nhow can you expect others to believe and follow?\nHow is it that Quanzhen cannot deliver itself?\nAh, disciples! To deliver beings is to deliver the beings within oneself.\nAnd what are these beings within?\nDisciples, they are the杂念妄想— the chaotic thoughts and delusions dwelling in your original mind.\n\nWithin the Quanzhen adept’s belly reside eighty-four thousand wayward thoughts and distractions—\neighty-four thousand beings.\nIn a single day, through the twelve double-hours,\nthough the body sits upon the meditation cushion, the mind roams the world.\nOne delusive thought vanishes, another arises;\nthe seven emotions surge unceasing, the six desires cling;\nthe three poisons entangle, the eight consciousnesses invert.\nLike floating clouds obscuring the sun, drifting east and west;\nlike wild waves driven by wind, surging west and east.\nDay and night, when is the mind ever stilled for even an hour?\nMonths and years pass, yet not a single thought is settled.\nNot only while seated on the cushion—\neven while walking the road, or in dreams—\nwhen is the delusive mind cast aside and the true thought upheld?\n\nIf the mind does not rest, the body is not delivered;\nif thoughts are not unified, the Dao remains obscured.\nThus, within the Quanzhen gate, one must still the thoughts and quiet the mind,\nonly then can the celestial mind manifest and the light of wisdom dawn.\n\nDisciples, if Quanzhen can achieve this, then it may be called a fellowship of like-minded seekers.\nTherefore, first deliver yourself, then go forth to deliver others—there is no delay.\nAnd how does one deliver oneself?\nThrough *unyielding resolve, fierce courage, diligent progress, relinquishment, generosity, luminous clarity, humility, liberation,* and *spontaneity.*\n\nDisciples, you must focus your will without distraction, concentrate your spirit, and settle your thoughts.\nThose among you with the karmic affinity, listen with wholehearted devotion,\nas I explain one by one these nine essentials of the Dao.\n\nHark! What is *unyielding resolve*?\nThe path of transcendence fundamentally opposes the worldly way—\ntheir directions diverge, their shapes clash.\nTo cultivate the Dharmakāya, one must first see through the illusions of the world—\nthe phantom forms of the body, the attachments to children, spouse, and family—\nsevering the bonds of affection.\nFame, wealth, fine robes, and steeds—\nall entangling vines of desire—\nmust be cast aside with a single leap from the pit of delusion.\nPurify the will, let the spirit soar unburdened—\nthis is *unyielding resolve.*\nIt is the *vajra that subdues demons,* the *platform that beheads illusions.*\n\nWhat is *fierce courage*?\nIndecision and hesitation allow wandering thoughts to linger;\nlosing one’s grip, the light of clarity flickers and dims.\nThe mind does not mirror the autumn moon, ever-bright and clear;\nthe spirit does not ascend the morning clouds, radiant in reflection.\nProcrastination and sloth follow the waves, drifting with the current;\nfrivolity and distraction shift like the sun at dawn and dusk.\nThe chest remains cluttered, the gaze never clears in an instant.\nYet if one applies effort to the mind, casting aside worldly concerns,\nand endures hardship in the Dao, crushing demonic forces—\nthen the swift, impermanent nature of life and death,\nlong obscured in confusion, may be pierced.\nBreak through walls of iron and bronze,\nand awaken to the truth of heaven and hell.\nDisciples, thus after *unyielding resolve,* one must add *fierce courage.*\n\nWhat is *diligent progress*?\n*Unyielding resolve* severs karmic ties and establishes the foundation of mind and destiny.\n*Fierce courage* subdues distraction and wandering thoughts, stabilizing the spirit.\nBut what of *diligent progress*?\nThe seeker investigates birth and death—\nbefore this body existed, where were you?\nAfter this body perishes, where will you go?\nIn this world, heaven and earth, the ten thousand things,\nand the ordinary affairs of daily life—\nnone exist apart from the Dao.\nWhat the eye sees, what the ear hears—\nnot a single thing lies outside the Dao, not one escapes its bounds.\nThings have beginnings and ends—these are the birth and death of things.\nAffairs have starts and finishes—these are the arising and ceasing of affairs.\nIf one applies the mind to inquiry, searches with relentless devotion,\nand penetrates the beginnings and ends of things,\nthen one penetrates the birth and death of the body.\nIf one grasps the starts and finishes of affairs,\nthen one grasps the arising and ceasing of the mind.\n\nFrom the ten thousand things to a single thing,\nfrom the ten thousand affairs to a single affair—\nif one meticulously contemplates and truly comprehends\nthe mechanisms of birth and death, the principles of arising and ceasing,\nthen the work of beginnings and ends, birth and death, arising and ceasing\nbecomes a single, unbroken practice.\nOnly then does one draw near to the Dao.\nThen, with profound absorption, one pursues the great Dao,\ndelving into the subtle and obscure, awakening to the mysterious workings,\nsilently discerning the celestial mind, secretly fathoming the essential teachings.\nOne’s single spark of numinous awareness, undimmed,\npenetrates the source and stream,\nresponding to the ten thousand things without confusion,\nunderstanding the ten thousand affairs without doubt.\n\nIf one refuses to progress diligently, growing lazy and complacent,\nthis is self-abandonment, willingly becoming a lowly ghost, lacking the resolve for true cultivation.\nEven if one sits in meditation for a hundred years or prolongs life for a thousand,\nultimately impermanence prevails, and one still falls into the wheel of rebirth.\n\nWhat is *relinquishment*?\nIt is to cast off past vulgarity, eradicate heterodox paths,\nand from this moment onward, turn with wholehearted sincerity toward the heights.\nThis single spark of numinous awareness, undimmed—\nthis is the primordial treasure, the root of all transformations,\nendlessly changing yet without fixed form.\n\nWhen encountering things and facing affairs, each application differs, and every response varies. At every turn, shadows appear; at every moment, traces are lost. Following the wondrous numinous mechanism, layer by layer one delves deeper into realization—yet still, the summit of mystery remains unattainable. The more one moves, the more emerges; drawn without end, used without exhaustion. Those who awaken grasp it for themselves; those who remain deluded drift far away.\n\nFor I fear that once you have glimpsed one or two parts of this principle, you may cling to it and seek further awakening—but if you abandon it to pursue another, you fall into impermanence. You must turn the unchanging, constant numinous mechanism toward the ever-changing, mutable affairs of the world. Then principle becomes clear, nature is revealed, the old is relinquished, the new is embraced, and step by step, layer by layer, you ascend to the heights. If you do not stand firm and independent, how can you penetrate profound mechanisms, illuminate life and death, transcend the mundane world, and sever the roots of doubt across ten thousand kalpas?\n\nWhat is *giving*? It is to offer yesterday’s awakened mechanism, the wondrous principles realized before—whether bestowing them upon sentient beings or storing them within a grain of millet—without retaining them to cloud the numinous terrace. As it is said: the past mind cannot be grasped, the future mind cannot be grasped, and even the present mind cannot be grasped. Yet within this ungraspable, seek the wondrous self-attainment—then the light of wisdom becomes complete.\n\nGiving wealth is called cultivating merit; giving the Dharma is called cultivating wisdom. Material giving has an end, but my teaching, when given, is inexhaustible. Giving wealth sustains worldly dharmas, nourishes the physical form with clothing and food, and adorns external appearances—yet when wealth is spent, one remains empty-handed. My giving of the Dharma serves both worldly and transcendent paths. Through Dharma-giving, one opens the deluded apertures of others and uplifts their spiritual roots.\n\nYet the wealth given is not worldly wealth. When ordinary beings nurture life, save others, relieve distress, aid the imperiled, ward off disasters, govern calamities, bring peace to nations, ensure well-being for the people, harmonize movement and stillness, water and fire, dispel misfortune and resolve adversity—all these acts of manifesting heaven’s transformation, commanding yin and yang, and penetrating heaven and earth with boundless, wondrous power—this is true wealth, the talent of the youth Sudhana, disciple of the Great Being Avalokiteśvara of the Southern Ocean.\n\nAh! Do you know? To seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world. This worldly wealth is not ordinary wealth—it is the Dharma-wealth of self-liberation and liberating others, called the *divine treasure*, which invokes heavenly treasures. In daily practice, it is the giving of the Dharma. Those who awaken to this become the wise ones of primordial wisdom across ten thousand kalpas.\n\nWhat is *loftiness and clarity*? One who can give the wondrous Dharma to liberate sentient beings must possess true discernment, genuine loftiness, and wisdom that thoroughly penetrates. All things between heaven and earth possess this numinous nature. If I take the Dharma as the Dharma, I am attached to the Dharma. Attachment to the Dharma makes it a dead Dharma, not a living one—this is a lack of lofty discernment.\n\nThus, if I impose my own methods to teach others or apply rigid principles to respond to things, it becomes a dead Dharma and a dull mechanism—like fixing a stake to row or gluing the tuning pegs to play the zither. One must not insist that one’s own Dharma is right and others’ wrong. With uprightness and luminosity, one adapts to the moment, seizes opportunities, and expounds with flexibility. If one measures the round with the square, one cannot turn freely. Teaching the foolish with wisdom does not suit the occasion.\n\nOne must assess the foolish and speak their language, making it clear and comprehensible, gauging what they can practice and gradually guiding them toward awakening. If one addresses the wise with the language of the foolish, it is equally unsuited. One must harmonize self and others, refine and vulgar alike, be fluid and adaptable—so the wise see wisdom, the benevolent see benevolence, blockages dissolve, disturbances settle, doubts resolve, the dull become astute, the deaf hear, and the blind see. Only then is one truly lofty and clear, fit to lead the work of salvation.\n\nWhat is *humility*? When true cultivation reaches this point, one encounters those with clear vision—vast in wisdom, empty in heart. All things external to the body, all worldly affairs, become emptiness, emptiness, emptiness. Above, one shakes the gates of heaven; below, one rocks the axis of earth. Transcending the human world, the spirit enters the void.\n\nWhere then is there still a sentient being before one’s eyes? From ancient times to the present, the Two Vehicles’ bodhisattvas and the lesser immortals of the lower vehicle have all contracted this affliction—so deeply ingrained they remain unaware. Thus are they called the lesser vehicle’s inferior roots, the heterodox teachings, the deviant paths and demonic arts. If this be so, how could one presume to fix the boundless, to grasp the unfathomable? The Dao has no fixed form; its spiritual transformations are beyond measure. How could you delimit it, seize it? A finite thing—how dare it falsely exalt itself?\n\nHave you not heard that the Most High dares not take precedence in the world? He does not claim blessings first, does not boast of his merits, does not display his Way. Advancement takes retreat as its foundation; loftiness takes humility as its base. By placing the self last, one preserves it; by putting the self behind, one leads. While others vie to be first, I alone withdraw. Supreme virtue does not assert virtue; the noble person does not contend. Seeing yet not perceiving the self, one is neither arrogant nor self-exalting nor self-aggrandizing. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one benefits others, the more one gains. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao. Thus, the higher one’s station, the more one practices humility and withdrawal. Gentleness and yielding preserve the Way of profundity. On the one hand, one universally extends kindness and wisdom; on the other, one conserves one’s radiance. A state’s sharpest weapon must not be shown to others. If I do not seek to subdue others, others will naturally submit.\n\nAt this stage, one must comprehend the principle of liberation. What is liberation? Disciples, those who cling fail to understand the Dao and virtue. Unfettered and at ease, untangled by dharmas; bare and unburdened, unencumbered by things. Perfectly round, adapting teachings to circumstances; radiantly luminous, delivering beings across kalpas. Entering the gate of all wonders, becoming the mother of sentient beings. Compassion loves beings, yet does not take loving beings as compassion; goodness aids others, yet does not take aiding others as goodness. The wondrous Dharma delivers sentient beings, yet does not take delivering beings as the wondrous Dharma; the supreme Dao transcends the world, yet does not take transcending the world as the supreme Dao. One can both escape suffering and endure suffering. Above, one may ascend beyond heaven, yet does not regard the celestial palaces as realms of joy; below, one may universally save those in hell, yet does not regard hell as a place of torment. Encountering suffering, one rescues others from it; encountering joy, one shares it with all. In joy, one points out the suffering of beings; in adversity, one reveals their joy. In heaven, one delivers dragons, ghosts, and spirits, enabling them to hear the true awakening and attain transcendental immortal arts; on earth, one delivers sin-laden departed souls, allowing the lost to see the light and be reborn in the human realm. In the world of humans, one delivers all good men and faithful women, universally cultivating the ordinary and everyday—effortless integrity, loyalty, trustworthiness, fairness, and the great Way of virtue. One does not guide scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants into the lesser vehicles’ petty teachings, manipulating spirits and souls, falling into demonic paths, or waging the wars of asuras.\n\nWithin this liberation, one must attain the function of spontaneity—this is the Dao of self-mastery. What is spontaneity? Disciples, this wondrous spontaneity is as the *Heart Sutra* states: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, the Perceiver of the World’s Sounds, perceiving the sounds of the world. Attaining the wondrous spontaneity, one becomes the Self-Mastered Perceiver of Sounds—this bodhisattva in one’s own heart, the Guanyin of the Southern Sea. One perceives the wondrous forms of the other shore’s pure emptiness, the principle of effortless void. One can perceive the wondrous forms of the true sound. Without a true teacher’s guidance, could one awaken to the wondrous forms of true emptiness?\n\nAh, disciples! Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; neither emptiness nor form, the Dao is not true. The true emptiness’ wondrous forms are the everlasting Dao; neither empty nor formed, wondrous and boundless. One with the vast void, the void and that are undivided. Entering metal and stone without obstruction, entering water and fire unharmed.\n\nDisciples, you must carefully contemplate the nine essentials of the Dao, steadfastly uphold the humble meditation cushion, awaken to all wondrous forms, align with spontaneity. The Three Teachings have already borne witness; universally delivering beings, one’s merit is immeasurable, virtue subdues ghosts and spirits, demons and evil spirits are rendered powerless, and malevolent forces lose their vigor. What worry is there that the world will not believe and take refuge?\n\nJust so—universal deliverance, meritorious deeds, and the mind of beneficence. Diligently cultivate the self before delivering others. With sincere resolve toward the true and everlasting Dao, the bodhisattvas will naturally protect your practice. The ninefold wondrous scripture transcends the mundane world; its profound truth is deeply refined. Dispensing subtle words of true wondrous principle, dual cultivation of nature and life without shirking hardship. With discerning wisdom, expound the Dharma abundantly; with gentle humility, do not boast of ability. Abandoning external appearances, forget self and other; the true and thusness of heaven’s heart, the great Dao in motion. Carefree and liberated, expounding the profound; the supreme true emptiness, the mysterious and abstruse Dao. The small fire harms not the union of the three families; with merit perfected and conduct fulfilled, one ascends the clouds.\n\nThe eighteen wisdoms’ radiance—disciples, having received the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Middle Realm, upholding secret conduct and subtle deportment, you are no longer as in the days of the initial true precepts. These precepts are subtle and profound; one must apply effort in the heart’s core. In every arising thought, one must maintain sincerity and reverence, silently examining, reflecting, and scrutinizing—upright in the great mean. Sweep the mind’s thoughts clean and pure, like the azure sky’s bright moon, without a trace of cloud; like crystal and lapis lazuli, without the slightest flaw; like a boundless bright mirror, without a speck of dust; like a luminous pearl, without a thread of darkness. Perfectly stable, radiantly luminous—only then can one discourse on the Dao. The radiance of wisdom, the wondrous forms of true emptiness, originally arise from precepts and concentration.\n\nThrough forbearance, one severs obstructions; through the strictest observance of precepts, through self-mastery and tempering—coupled with the aid of dharma and elixirs—only then can one attain this state. If one merely holds the precepts yet rarely upholds them, practicing cultivation with subtle precision and rigor, deceiving and deluding oneself, one will never achieve cessation. Why is this so? Alas, disciples, laxity in practice is called a \"leaky cause\"—how can it yield the fruit of the unconditioned?\n\nThis phrase, \"the radiance of wisdom,\" belongs to the superior vehicle and keen roots. Thus, those of the inferior vehicle and dull roots, unable to awaken and enter, must instead focus the will without distraction, concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity, nurture the ancestral qi, and cultivate the primordial—attaining utmost emptiness, guarding profound stillness, maintaining absolute singleness, and concealing the spirit in the boundless. When this reaches its extreme, the Supreme Ultimate arises, and the radiance of wisdom naturally emerges; the first yang returns, and one beholds the original face.\n\nTo know the conditions of ghosts and spirits, to penetrate the pivot of creation—this is called *zhi* (wisdom). To assist in heaven and earth’s transformative nurturance, to alternate brilliance with the sun and moon, to harmonize with the four seasons’ cyclical movements—this is called *hui* (insight). To universally manifest the Dharma-body, to encompass the Dharma-realm without straying beyond awakened illumination, to wholly return within luminous clarity—this is called *guang* (radiance). To pervade all things without form, to perceive all affairs before their signs, to traverse empty space without trace, to surpass the sun and moon without shadow—this is called *ming* (luminosity).\n\nIf precepts are not observed with meticulous precision, one cannot attain profound stability. Without profound stability, wisdom does not arise. Without wisdom, radiance does not manifest.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Precious Sutra* in one scroll directly reveals the original nature, pointing straight to the human mind. The nature’s truth is made manifest, and the celestial mechanism is fully unveiled, enabling sentient beings to turn the sutra and awaken to the Dao. Yet, alas, the deluded are many, and the awakened are few. The mouth recites in vain while the heart fails to uphold; the heart may be sincere, yet the strength cannot turn. How pitiful—betraying the sagely intent, vainly pointing to the Dharma-treasure.\n\nNow, I cannot but expound the sutra’s wonders on its behalf, revealing the true mechanism to guide you, disciples, into sudden awakening. Each of you, with reverence and wholehearted attention, listen closely.\n\nThe sutra states: *\"Long ago, fifteen kalpas past, my heart encountered this Dao, and I ascended to the rank of Upper Perfected. My intent refined this merit, and I wielded the power of great transformation.\"* It further says: *\"With a pure and still heart, one vows boundlessly; with the power of wisdom, one subdues all demons.\"* And: *\"You, gods and humans, desire to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profound and distant—it lies nowhere else. If you wish to hear it, the uninterrupted is it. Uninterrupted and unseen, this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing dissolve—only you remain. You are not even ‘you,’ let alone the Dao. To hear without hearing—what Dao can be spoken?\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. Using sincerity appears foolish; using silence appears inarticulate; using softness appears clumsy. Only thus can one forget form, forget the self, and forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, the radiance of insight arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, profound stability is secure. With profound stability secure, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, the radiance of insight arises; with the radiance of insight arising, one becomes one with the Dao. This is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten—this is the supreme Dao. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know it not. Sentient and insentient—all is one, without duality.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"Those who attain awakening ascend to the immortal’s throne.\"* And: *\"The foolish can become wise, the turbid can become clear—this is commanded by fate. The foolish are dull, the turbid are dark—these are shifts in endowment from wind and earth. Heaven and earth wield their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called ‘natural.’ If they know what they do not know, this too is called ‘natural.’ The marvel of the natural, though marvelous in knowing, is marvelous precisely in not knowing. Yet regarding the Dao, there has never been foolishness or turbidity.\"*\n\nFinally, it says: *\"All that has been proclaimed—when the noble receive the sutra, they must dig for gold to offer as tribute, swearing before heaven to transmit it.\"*\n\nDisciples, this is the true and profound mystery of the *Jade Pivot Sutra*—the supreme, inconceivable Dharma treasure of pure stillness, liberation, and the most subtle and wondrous upper grade. You merely recite the sutra day after day yet have never grasped its wondrous essence. If, when you recite and uphold it, you awaken to the secret key within, you become complete in sagely wisdom, and the light of insight arises.\n\nThe profound Dao spoken of is deep and obscure, beyond sight and sound. Had the Heavenly Worthy not, fifteen hundred kalpas ago, opened the mind of pure stillness and vowed with boundless resolve to deliver all beings to the ultimate mystery, none could have attained it. The Dao’s root is emptiness and nothingness—no sound to be heard, no form to be seen. Since no sound may be heard, forget the ear; since no form may be seen, forget the eye. When ear and eye are forgotten, hearing and seeing too dissolve. For ear and eye, being formed and colored, lead the six senses; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are the very source of the six senses. How could they accord with the Dao?\n\nIf one can purify the six senses and sweep away the six consciousnesses, then the ear that does not listen hears with the heart, and the eye that does not see perceives with spirit. Thus, one hears without listening and sees without looking. Without hearing or seeing, one merges with the Dao. The *Ancient Sutra of the Crimson Text* states: *\"Forget the eye, and light overflows without limit; forget the ear, and the mind’s awareness abides in profound depth. When both mechanisms are forgotten, one enters the gate of all wonders. Seeing yet not seeing the self, hearing yet not grasping sound—transcending all extremes, this is called the wondrous Dao.\"* The *Nanhua Sutra* says: *\"Qi halts at the ear, the mind halts at the tally.\"*\n\nThus, the *Jade Pivot Sutra* teaches: *\"Forget form, forget self—this is the mechanism of entering the Dao.\"* One enters through sincerity—this sincerity is precept-keeping. One guards through silence—this silence is the taming of body and mind through precepts. To be silent as if mute is to enter samadhi, forgetting ear and eye. To be yielding as if clumsy is to inwardly conceal wisdom in secrecy.\n\nIt further states: *\"If you seek within your own bodily form for hearing and seeing, you will never see or hear.\"* The *Diamond Sutra* says: *\"Those who seek me through form or sound walk the wrong path and cannot see the Tathagata.\"*\n\nThose who wish to enter the Dao must only receive the precepts, enter samadhi, and secretly cultivate wisdom, transforming delusion into clarity. Then, though not hearing and not seeing, they hear and see. Thus, those who enter the Dao know stillness—this is the practice of precept-keeping to still thoughts; they know reverence—this is the practice of vigilance in solitude and diligent progress; they know subtlety—this is the practice of transcending sageliness and abandoning cunning.\n\nStillness of thought cannot be achieved without precepts; vigilance in solitude cannot be achieved without samadhi; subtlety cannot be achieved without wisdom. If one truly upholds precepts, enters samadhi, and cultivates wisdom, body and mind become serene, sagely wisdom becomes complete, and the light of insight shines universally. When the light of insight penetrates fully, one unites with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. This true forgetting is not the empty stillness of sitting in dull vacuity but true emptiness. Within this true emptiness, a wondrous purple-golden form appears—the marvelous fruit of emptiness that is not empty.\n\nTo avoid falling into dull emptiness and to realize emptiness that is not empty is to allow the essential mystery to manifest naturally. Only when forgetting is without what to forget, and what is forgotten is the ultimate, wondrous Dao.\n\nIt is also said: Foolishness and wisdom differ, as do purity and turbidity. Though these arise from uneven endowments of wind and earth, they are all the workings of creation’s mechanism, the natural movement of qi and destiny, fixed by fate. Yet the foolish remain foolish, and the wise remain wise—how could heaven and earth be blamed for making the foolish wise? Only by arousing the mind of pure stillness and establishing the vast vow—vowing to leave the world to deliver others—can one hear the Dao and attain self-deliverance.\n\nThose who attain self-deliverance take refuge in the Three Jewels, receive the precepts, enter samadhi, and cultivate wisdom to radiate light. Then the foolish may become wise, and the turbid may become clear. But without upholding precepts, entering samadhi, or penetrating wisdom, no light shines—then the clear may become turbid, and the wise may become foolish. The *Diamond Sutra* says: *\"The Dharma I teach is originally without fixed Dharma.\"* This is what it means.\n\nThe wisdom and light spoken of shine brilliantly upon the Great Mystery, illuminating the Dharma realm—how could they lie beyond the *Jade Pivot Treasure Sutra*? The Jade Pivot is the true mechanism. Those who wish to transmit the sutra must first turn the true mechanism, secretly cultivating merit and wisdom. Yet if the light remains hidden, one cannot open or see it. How then could one perceive the forms of ghosts and spirits, grasp the pivot of creation, participate in heaven and earth’s transformations, direct the movements of sun and moon, contain the Dharma realm within a mustard seed, stabilize all things at their unmanifest beginning, be called a master of the wondrous Dao, and ascend to the realm of heavenly immortals?\n\nJust so:\n*Seeing the treasury of light, one hears the root of the supreme Dao.\nWithout cultivating precepts and samadhi, how could wisdom’s light run deep?\nClinging to appearances is not the true form—only by forgetting hearing can one truly hear.\nHearing, contemplating, and cultivating enter the mystery, freely as the ocean’s tide.*\n\n**The Nineteen Wondrous Functions of Supernormal Powers**\n\nDisciples, the path of wisdom and light spoken of above—the *Jade Pivot Sutra* merely teaches the dissolution of hearing and seeing. Without hearing or seeing, the wondrous functions are fully expounded, and supernormal powers manifest. Disciples, the *Yinfu Sutra* says: *\"The deaf see seeing, the blind see hearing.\"* The ancient immortals said: *\"In stillness, one hears not the thunder’s roar; in clarity, one sees not Mount Tai.\"* The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: *\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is! Seen yet not seen, heard yet not heard.\"*\n\nThe *Nanhua Sutra* states: *\"See not, hear not—embrace the spirit in stillness.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Ear, eye, and mouth are the three treasures; close and seal them, let no passage open. The true person dives deep into the abyss, floating and roaming yet abiding within the compass.\"* In all the scriptures, the wondrous words spoken are beyond enumeration.\n\nThe Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation, entered *samādhi*. The ear-root is the aperture through which essence leaks—not the essence of post-natal fleeting desires, but the *qi* of primordial Taiyi, the essence of true origin manifesting in response. If one listens inwardly and seals their hearing, essence does not scatter, and wisdom is born. The eye is the aperture through which spirit leaks—not the spirit of post-natal deliberation, but the innate luminous awareness of *liangzhi*, the primal spirit of nebulous *taisu*. If one gazes inwardly and returns their vision, spirit does not wander outward, and insight is born.\n\nBy upholding precepts and entering concentration, wisdom arises. With wisdom, water and fire intermingle. When water and fire intermingle, *kan* and *li* unite. When *kan* and *li* unite, Heaven and Earth are in harmony. When Earth and Heaven are in harmony, metal and wood merge. When metal and wood merge, *hun* and *po* converge. When *hun* and *po* converge, essence and *qi* transform. When essence and *qi* transform, supernormal powers manifest. When supernormal powers manifest, radiance shines forth. When radiance shines forth, merit is perfected. When merit is perfected, the *Dharmakāya* is realized. When the *Dharmakāya* is realized, the Dao-body is revealed. When the Dao-body is revealed, wondrous functions operate. When wondrous functions operate, beings are delivered. When beings are delivered, vows are fulfilled. When vows are fulfilled, the great task is complete. When the great task is complete, the fruit of realization is attained.\n\nThis is the One Vehicle; the other two are not true. From beginning to end, it does not depart from the word *sincerity*. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Without sincerity, there is nothing.\"* That \"nothing\" is the *huang* and *hu*—within it lies something; the *yao* and *ming*—within it lies essence. Its essence is most true, and within it lies *trust*. *Trust* is sincerity, which is the *Book of Changes*’ *\"essence and qi become things\"* and the *Great Learning*’s *\"things are investigated.\"* *Essence* is the *Shangshu*’s *\"refined unity.\"* *Middle* is the *\"centrality\"* of *jue zhong*. The *Lotus Sutra* says: *\"There is a treasure hidden within the mountain of form; the sage uses it to purify the heart and withdraw, concealing it in secrecy.\"* All are none other than this. First conceal it, then it is seen.\n\nAn ancient song says: *\"If this heart holds not a single thing, before your eyes is the time of Fuxi.\"* Then what need is there for supernormal powers or wondrous functions? What need for wisdom and light? These supernormal powers and wondrous functions are the true person who guards the Dao through precepts, manifesting to teach and deliver beings, gathering delusion to return to truth—this is their wondrous function.\n\nThus, within the radiance of great wisdom, the golden arm of insight extends, rescuing all beings, lifting them from suffering and affliction into purity and stillness. It can grant longevity to those with short lives, transform calamity into peace and joy. It brings about the tranquility of lands and the preservation of life. It makes beings pure and upright, dispelling demons and evil, driving away violence and rebellion, eradicating malevolent spirits. It makes beings compassionate, refraining from killing or harming life. It can protect beings from the turning of kalpas, dissolving karmic knots and grievances. It can shatter the darkness of ignorance, revealing light. It can heal all illnesses, dispelling chronic ailments. It can turn foolishness into wisdom, guiding beings to return to rightness and abandon evil. It can curb desires, purify the heart, gather emotions to return to nature. It can bring liberation without hindrance, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood. It can accumulate blessings, dispel misfortune, generate auspiciousness, and eradicate transgressions. It can lead beings to transcend the world, leave suffering, and ascend to truth. It can enable the cultivation of the supreme vehicle, ascending to heaven, universally guiding beings to roam the eight directions, surpassing celestial palaces.\n\nMay all beings in their ordinary forms become the bodies of Dharma Kings—so unfathomable that it is called *supernormal power*. Its mechanism is not revealed to the world, and thus it is called *wondrous function*. Therefore, the supernormal powers of the precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the *power that is not supernormal*, transforming the six senses into the six penetrations—penetrating heaven, earth, spirits, ghosts, humans, and things—this is called *supernormal power*. This wondrous function, though without wondrousness, operates one mechanism to display myriad transformations. Transforming heavenly demons, earthly malevolent stars, myriad ghosts, evil persons, and monstrous beings—this is called *wondrous function*.\n\nWithin the gate of precepts and concentration, entering stillness, the light of concentration and wisdom arises—the luminous auspicious sign of the primordial unified *qi*. Above, it connects to the celestial palaces, paying homage to the ancestral *qi* above the Three Purities. Below, it reaches the underworld, absolving the sins of souls in the nine springs. When the Dharma is expounded, celestial deities are subdued, the Five Emperors attend in state, myriad spirits stand guard in solemn array, desiring to hear the true Dharma and refine the spirit to return to emptiness. Having attained liberation, with compassionate heart and merciful intent, they relieve the suffering of the cold and forsaken. The *Jingluo* praises and extols, Earth Treasury illuminates, ghostly judges comply, and the underworld is subdued. Sins are absolved, beings are reborn, they hear the true Dharma, escape the ghostly register, and all turn toward the Land of Bliss.\n\nThus, self-deliverance leads to delivering others. Great vows are made: may all beings universally hear the supreme Dao, and may the medicine of the Dharma universally save all beings. May all beings, even the crawling and moving, the sensitive and the insensate, together attain liberation. Even earth, wood, tiles, and stones may receive its resonance. All things and emotions are thoroughly penetrated. Supernormal powers operate in the unknowing and unaware, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things are within this body. Wondrous functions arise naturally, and mountains, rivers, and stars return to the Dharma. Heavenly demons all bow in reverence, lowering their heads in welcome. Earthly malevolent stars transform into kindness and harmony, submitting with respectful hearts. Fierce and malevolent ghosts, upon hearing the transformation, ascend beyond, forever forsaking blood offerings. *Asuras* and external paths submit to the Dharma and return to rightness.\n\nWar forever ceases, wrongs are all redressed, and enmities dissolve. Through virtue one transforms, not by force one subdues—thus the wicked all become good; through sincerity one moves, not by artifice one oppresses—thus the perverse all turn upright. Inverting the Dipper’s handle to wield yin and yang, even spirits and ghosts cannot fathom it; reversing the mechanism of transformation to transcend the world, even heaven and earth remain unaware. Universally manifesting numinous clarity, the Dharma-body stands firm, yet no form can be perceived. Broadly proclaiming the supreme vehicle’s singular wondrous Dharma, yet no sound can be heard. The void is my Dharma-realm, and I am the Dharma-body of the void. Vast and boundless, one with heaven as a single body; upright and majestic, one with immortals and buddhas in a single heart. As Master Cheng said: *\"Unfurled, it fills the six directions; rolled up, it retreats into secrecy.\"* This is precisely what is meant.\n\nThey are called the parents of all beings, the Dharma-teachers of the Daoist gate. Are these not the divine powers of purity and liberation, the wondrous functions of non-action and spontaneity? Disciples, if you do not cling to appearances, wisdom flows boundlessly; if you follow heaven’s natural course, wondrous functions are inexhaustible. It lies only in the daily and ordinary, never neglected, even in haste or urgency—nothing more than the two words *virtue* and *Dao*. Why then abandon precepts to study talismanic arts, or forsake jade to covet mere jasper? Would you willingly remain among the unwise, refusing to learn the supreme vehicle’s Way?\n\nAlas! Disciples entering the mystery-gate, seek the supreme vehicle. Every person contains a wondrous aperture, each one radiates luminosity. Yet due to myriad obstructions, they regard precepts as empty formalities. Even if one upholds them intermittently, vacillation ensures no depth. When concentration deepens and vows are earnest, neither attachment nor forgetfulness serves as the rule. Uphold them ceaselessly in every moment of the twelve double-hours, for three to five years without lapse. When concentration is forgotten and precepts become second nature, spiritual communion arises spontaneously—true wondrous functions emerge from this communion.\n\nWielding divine powers, attaining wondrous functions, disciples must rely on sincere progress. If one foolishly clings to appearances in pursuit, the ghostly den becomes one’s path—no true course. External paths and side doors dwell in form; clinging to emptiness or abiding in form is not true cultivation. Neither cling to emptiness nor to form: in concentration, no form arises; in resonance, communion is achieved. In application, spirit becomes luminously distinct—how many Daoists lose the central work!\n\nI do not speak idly now—hark!—I reveal the celestial mechanism outright. Divine powers manifest, wondrous functions shine forth: the great Dharma-king coils through earth and sky. Not departing from the ever-quiet true and constant Dao, demonic teachings submit in reverence, and evil transforms into goodness. Disobedience one morning yields to filial piety; the stubborn and fierce all become kind and harmonious. Wisdom like a mirror, insight like a spirit—one’s luminous platform shines resplendently. The six penetrations intermingle without trace of dust; the great earth and mountains and rivers all turn to gold.\n\nDisciples, do not grow lax in upholding precepts—this is the heavenly ladder, step by step ascending. The divine is unfathomable, the wondrous immeasurable, yet they never depart from precepts, concentration, and the true and constant. Within the gate of Suchness lies a celestial aperture; within the Hall of Non-Duality, sacred fragrance issues forth. Disciples, cultivate sincerely and do not abandon yourselves—since ancient times, this has been the great Dao-field of immortals and sages.\n\n**Twenty: Awakening to Life and Death**\nDisciples, from ancient times to now, sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—all for the great matter of causation—faced the wall for nine years, solely to pursue life and death, to transcend the world and subdue the mind. Have you not heard? Like sparks from stone or lightning’s flash, like fallen blossoms or flowing water—when impermanence arrives, not a moment can be retained. Sin and fortune follow the body, and in the wheel of rebirth, one receives retribution. Before words are finished, the breath in the throat ceases; before speech is complete, the tongue retracts, and no sound can be made. Naked and alone, where can one find refuge? Dark and boundless, who can establish destiny? With great fortune, one returns to the human realm; with evil karma, one falls into Fengdu. When fortune is exhausted, one re-enters the wheel; when karma is complete, one is reborn as an animal. For ten thousand kalpas, karmic entanglements are hard to escape; for a thousand lives, sinful deeds cannot be worn away. Lifetime after lifetime, sunk in delusion, living as if drunk or dreaming. Mutual retribution, wearing horns and fur. To speak of it is grievous and lamentable; to recount it is pitiful and terrifying.\n\nIf one does not firmly resolve and hold fast to innate goodness, overturning earth and sky to awaken to what comes after death; if one does not risk life and limb to thoroughly see through the myriad delusions of past lives—then, should one encounter a resolute person, brows raised and demon-slaying sword in hand; truly a great person, with vast qi unleashed, wielding the sharp blade of rectitude to sever evil from the heart—one must see through to the state before parents gave birth: where was one’s destiny established? Investigate thoroughly the workings of creation from the very root. After death, where does one find refuge? Awaken to the three bodies—past, future, and present. Pursue the three worlds as if they were yesterday; tomorrow becomes this morning.\n\nThus, let all cares vanish, leaving only this single point of luminous spirit. Sweep away all conditions, preserving only that small measure of wisdom-nature. Enter the mysterious pass: when one aperture opens, a hundred apertures open. Perceive the true source: the three times become clear, and the three realms are transcended. In liberation, the five phases are unobstructed; in emptiness, the four great elements dissolve. Enter the gate of myriad wonders, ascend the ground of the Three Treasures—coming and going freely, transforming without limit. Gently turning the celestial mechanism, even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its wonder; majestically inverting the Dipper’s handle, even yin and yang cannot control its power. Roaming freely in the vastness of Brahma’s qi, attaining the position of pure emptiness and boundlessness. Forever leaving the dust and kalpas, transcending the cage of existence.\n\nThe great matter of the Perfected is accomplished. Step by step, the great path is traversed; without cultivating right and wrong, one swiftly arrives. This wondrous Dharma-body of subtle existence is entirely obtained through wisdom’s aperture. Secretly practicing each step of the work, how could one not awaken and achieve fulfillment?\n\nDisciples! The Dao is transmitted by sages, but cultivation lies with oneself.\n\nVirtue is accumulated by the person, while discernment comes from Heaven. Have you not heard? Heaven divides creation from the One Center, while humans establish order from the heart. Each must strive and swiftly practice, pressing forward with urgency. Those who have not awakened do not lose their good causes; those who penetrate the truth return entirely to the azure heavens; even those who have not awakened do not fall into hell. Disciples! It is like knocking at a gate with a golden brick—the gate remains unopened, yet the golden brick is still there. If one cultivates precepts and the Dao but does not awaken, the precepts and cultivation remain intact, and one will not sink into the netherworld, but will ultimately be reborn in the world of light. Past causes are not obscured, and fruition naturally manifests; merely overturning a small part, one still holds a handle in hand.\n\nDisciples! If you awaken to life and death, do not seek outside your own body. Only when life and death are awakened to does one know the true origin within the heart. Though I now speak at length, it amounts to no method at all. If you embody the heart in this way, you will find that principle yourself. Investigate death within life, awaken to death within life—this mechanism of life and death turns on the path you yourself traverse; it is up to you, not up to me. Seek stillness within movement, find movement within stillness—thus the subtleties of movement and stillness are entirely illuminated by the inner light of innate knowledge. The heart can be questioned, but the teacher cannot. Remember my words well, and you will not go astray. If you do not follow what I say, you will ultimately fall into error and delay.\n\nThis dim lantern of mine has guided countless lost travelers along their way. This raft of mine, for crossing suffering’s sea, has ferried passengers across the Ganges’ endless waves. Disciples, do not doubt—once you recognize the truth, journey onward through the night.\n\nThen, in the silent garden, a verse was heard:\n\nWhere was your homeland before birth?\nTo which realm shall you return after death?\nNow is the time to awaken to the Dharma-body—\ndo not pass through the spring of your years empty-handed.\n\nDeath and life, life and death—examine them both,\nfor the great matter of karmic conditions brooks no delay.\nBefore death arrives, first model yourself on death,\nand within death, seek the mechanism of life.\n\nNot in water, not on mountains—\nwhy search the northwest or the southeast?\nLook, and you will find it not beyond this body,\nonly within this small square inch of the heart.\n\nPrecepts, concentration, wisdom—enter the mysterious gate,\nand do not let your efforts scatter in duality.\nWith single-minded focus on awakening to life and death,\neven iron walls and bronze ramparts will not be hard to break.\n\nTruly bitter, truly arduous—\nlike a boat navigating shallow shoals.\nBut should the river’s tide rise and the wind turn fair,\nin an instant you will fly past the Nine Dragons’ Bay.\n\nRecognize the truth, and walk through the night,\nseeking even the staff of support—you will find none.\nEmpty and free, cultivate alone,\nneither thirsty nor hungry, with the longevity of heaven and earth.\n\nThe twenty-one virtues are complete—\ndisciples!\n\nThe vastness of empty space—within this gate of precepts and concentration lies the ladder to heaven. The boundless sea of suffering—within this radiance of wisdom lies the vessel to cross the ocean. If you do not stride forward with resolve, how can you traverse the ninety thousand miles of the journey? If you do not straighten your spine and press on, how can you hear the true Dharma through a hundred thousand kalpas?\n\nShould your steps falter or your will waver, how can your merit be perfected or your virtue fulfilled? Disciples, let not a single thought leak from your minds, and the primordial qi within your bodies will naturally suffuse and harmonize. When your virtue subdues gods and spirits, only then may you escape the retribution of rebirth. When the Dao pervades heaven and earth, only then may you transcend the path of life and death.\n\nAscend the shore of the Dao, and with a turn of the body, you are home. Plunge into the profound and subtle, and in the blink of an eye, you return to your original nature. Disciples! Who among you abides in deathlessness? Who has witnessed eternal life? The deathless is no mortal form; the long-lived is not bound to shape or substance. Where now is Pengzu? Does Yanzi endure through ten thousand kalpas? The deathless is my Dharma-body; the long-lived is my primordial qi.\n\nEven the Tathāgata has his time of extinction, entering the realm of Nirvana. Even Laozi had his day of ascension, soaring beyond the Great Scarlet Heaven. Where the Dao abides, there the person abides; where the Dharma is present, there the body is present. To die yet not forget is true longevity—an indestructible nameless name enduring through ten million kalpas. To live yet not cling to form is true embodiment—an unblemished formless form persisting through a hundred generations.\n\nOf the immeasurable sages like grains of sand in the Ganges, which one did not pass through this mysterious gate? Of the countless, inconceivable Buddhas and immortals, which one did not traverse this great path? Yet the bright and clear celestial thoroughfare confounds the deluded, who doubt and disbelieve. The pure and tranquil Buddha-realm remains obscured to the unenlightened, whose hindrances are hard to remove. Alas, their blessings are meager and their sins profound—though they have eyes, they are no better than the blind.\n\nMany are bound by deep karmic debts, though alive, they are already counted among the dead. Their flesh walks and their corpses move, yet they differ from beasts only in speech. They sleep by day and slumber by night, yet fall short even of plants, which at least stand tall with branches outstretched. When their allotted days are spent and the ghosts come to summon them, what does it matter if they are perfected Daoists? A single misstep is recorded in the ledger of sins, and they are judged as the wicked and unvirtuous.\n\nDisciples! All must die, but strive to die well—pure and clean, unburdened, coming and going freely without constraint. All must disperse, but seek to disperse with wonder—lucid and untrammeled, transforming with effortless mastery. Before turning away, bid farewell to all. When the hour arrives, release your grip and go. Naked as a newborn, a radiant aura of auspicious light streams from your crown. Round and perfect, your wondrous form ascends, while in midair, colored clouds and white cranes soar. Amidst such celestial visions, your primordial spirit returns to the void. A cascade of auspicious light carries your true bones to the grotto-realm.\n\nThe great man’s work is complete! He leaves behind an immortal name among men and bequeaths a scripture of the Dao to the world. Thus, for a hundred generations to come, they will know of his existence—this is what it means to \"die yet not perish\" and be called long-lived. For ten thousand kalpas hence, his Dao will spread—this is the body of perfect fulfillment, great merit, and boundless blessing.\n\nDisciples, life and destiny lie within yourselves—none can bequeath them to you. If you do not cultivate, none can cultivate in your stead. The arising and ceasing of thoughts—none can grasp them for you. Deluded desires and selfish impulses—none can sweep them away for you. Deep attachments—none can relinquish them for you. The formless Dharma-body—none can recognize it for you. Precepts and regulations—none can practice them for you. Afflictions and ignorance—none can extinguish them for you. Worldly habits—none can dissolve them for you. Countless hindrances—none can remove them for you. Sacred words and wondrous Dharma—none can uphold them for you. Karmic consequences of sin and blessing—none can believe them for you. Mundane thoughts and worldly attitudes—none can forget them for you. Aspirations bound to form—none can empty them for you. Heterodox paths—none can discern them for you. Illusory constructs—none can penetrate them for you. Matters and things—none can master them for you. Realms and states—none can transcend them for you. Perfected masters—none can seek them for you. The vast Dao of empty space—none can enter it for you. In this lifetime, none can liberate you. Your initial vows and resolve—none can fulfill them for you.\n\nDisciples, why is this so? It is because your arrogance and self-importance make you unteachable. Kind words and gentle admonitions cannot reach you. Doubt and disbelief render you unreachable. Heavy sins and deep karma cannot be uprooted. Anger and slander cannot be stilled. Flattery and praise cannot sway you. Fierce temper and rage cannot be subdued. Cunning schemes and treachery cannot be abandoned. Earnest counsel falls on deaf ears. Delusion and madness cannot be shattered. Blind and sightless, you cannot be enlightened. Reckless and unruly, you cannot be restrained. Sickness and suffering cannot be healed. Misfortune and calamity cannot be absolved. Fate and kalpas spare no one. The retribution of rebirth cannot be evaded. The laws of men and the punishments of the unseen cannot be avoided. The sword trees and blade mountains cannot be turned aside. The compassionate raft of wisdom cannot ferry you. The wondrous elixir of the golden pill cannot be bestowed upon you. Though celestial secrets exist, they cannot transform you. Though divine powers abound, they cannot liberate you.\n\nDisciples, only when you truly endure hardship and discipline, steadfastly upholding the precepts without transgression, seeking the One within concentration, and maintaining unwavering sincerity—only then will you truly turn your hearts toward the Dao. Disciples, turn your hearts toward the Dao, and repentance will naturally wash you clean.\n\nTaking refuge in the Great Dao, entanglements can naturally be severed. The celestial mysteries of Heaven’s subtle apertures—through purity and emptiness, one may draw near. The darkness of the underworld—light will naturally dawn. Great calamities and kalpas—from the wheel of rebirth, one may break free. The impermanence of life and death—firmly grasp the handle, and stand resolute. The boundless Great Dao—heart by heart, one naturally merges with it. The supreme Dharma-body—with clarity, one naturally attains realization. Limitless blessings—naturally and securely, one receives them. Countless beings—one by one, one may liberate them all. Vast vows and great aspirations—through profound sincerity, they are naturally fulfilled. Enduring as heaven and earth—longevity and destiny may be equally attained.\n\nOnly with a luminous heart—obstructions can be penetrated. Only with sincere faith—metal and stone can be pierced. Only with an empty heart—not even a thread can stain it. Only with constancy—no demon can seize it. Only with a kind heart—enmity and evil naturally dissolve. Only with a true heart—no demon can provoke it. Only with a luminous heart—one may stand equal with sages and worthies, and naturally attain thorough understanding. Only with a discerning heart—one may realize the state of immortals and buddhas, and naturally awaken completely. Only with an empty heart—wondrous principles may be perceived, and one naturally delves deeply. Only with a settled heart—subtle forms may be recognized, and wisdom naturally unfolds. Only with an illuminating heart—the true emptiness may be comprehended, and one naturally achieves silent accord. Only with a concentrated heart—life and death may be understood, and one naturally becomes free of karmic transgressions. Only with an impartial heart—one may face ghosts and spirits, and naturally remain free of deception. Only with an upright heart—demons and monsters may be subdued, and light naturally shines forth. Only with a sincere heart—evil spirits may be subdued, and wisdom naturally multiplies. Only with a giving heart—celestial deities may be drawn near, and great vow-power naturally arises. Only with a compassionate heart—the ignorant and obstinate may be transformed, and universal shelter naturally extends. Only with a majestic heart—fierce evils may be subdued, and fearlessness naturally prevails. Only with a forbearing heart—nothing need be discarded, and magnanimity naturally expands. Only with an empty heart—no form can linger, and one naturally ascends to awakened illumination. Only with a forgetful heart—forms may be distinguished, and one naturally transcends self and others. Only with a patient heart—no being remains unknowable, and one liberates all beings from the self. Only with a non-attached heart—no realm can confine one, and one naturally attains perfect freedom. Only with a mind of perfect adaptability—the three realms cannot bind one, and one naturally becomes free of all hindrances. Only with a mind of beneficence—no kalpa is impassable. Only with a pure and tranquil heart—the boundless may be dwelled in, and great perfection naturally manifests.\n\nDisciples, I have now completed the teaching, and the Dao-field is complete. Yet consider this: when father and son ascend the mountain, the father cannot transmit to the son, nor can the son take the father’s place. Fellow cultivators may walk the same path, but each knows their own warmth and cold, each advances or retreats on their own. Thus, in expounding the Dharma, there is not a single fixed method—only prescribing medicine according to the illness, dispensing remedies according to the symptoms. Once the illness is cured and the symptoms dispelled, there is no need for further prescriptions or medicine. It is like crossing a river by boat: once ashore, one should not long for the vessel again. Or like threading a needle to sew clothes: once the stitching is done, there is no need to seek needle and thread further. Do not draw legs on a snake or pull grass to find a snake.\n\nOnly strive forward with earnest effort, holding fast to the precepts with unwavering discipline. Forget the precepts within the precepts, add discipline beyond discipline—when the work deepens and the firing time is ripe, the ancestral masters will naturally lift and guide you to communion with the true. Never waver without resolve, leaning on the master or relying on fellow cultivators, clinging to names and forms, blindly following others’ footsteps year after year. You must steel your resolve, free of doubt, wholeheartedly and without regret—even unto death. When the firing time is complete, have you not heard that Heaven does not fail the earnest?\n\nThe Great Dao is still and unmoving; when one resonates with it, communion is achieved. Disciples, if you can resolve with fervent hearts, pressing forward without hesitation, advancing without turning back, your aspirations will be lofty and far-reaching—you will be the seeds of the Dao-gate. The silent gatha left by Patriarch Qiu is not lightly shown to the multitude. Today, for your sake, I have recited it—listen closely and receive it.\n\nGatha says:\n\"Impermanence of life and death must be self-realized—\nWhen you die, none will care for you but yourself.\nDo not rely on others for your own salvation,\nEven immortals must deliver themselves.\n\nNot only the six dusts and six senses,\nBut not clinging to any dharma, the mind abides constantly.\nThe constant abides in the impermanent, the impermanent in the constant—\nKnow the causes without delusion, for causes are innumerable.\nIn the causal ground, investigate and clarify the emptiness of self-nature;\nAt the fruition stage, who perceives emptiness to abide in it?\nFrom this moment, resolve the mechanism of life and death,\nAnd henceforth strike your name from the ledger of rebirth.\n\nIf one follows the precepts to seek conduct,\nHeavenly spirits will silently acknowledge it.\nThe Longmen heart-method is originally without form,\nYet I speak plainly of its entirety in bitter earnest.\nDo not cling to dharmas but sweep them all away,\nOnly then will the truth of these gatha-words be seen.\n\nPonder deeply my words on the Dharma-body—\nThe empty sky itself is a treasury of many jewels.\nWhen moved, thoughts arise endlessly without cease,\nYet the Dao conceals itself within the body to extend blessings.\nThe heart-method harmonizes, and method is the heart;\nHeart and method without end stretch on like a long carrying-pole.\"\n\nAt the end of the *Jade Garden Altar Sutra*\n\n\"Twenty-Second Inquiry into the Primal Mechanism\n\nDisciples, this single point of empty clarity that never fades—this is the true person of your original destiny. Is it so easily seen? From ancient times to the present, sages, worthies, immortals, buddhas, patriarchs, and hosts of perfected beings have faced walls for nine years, sat in meditation for six, practiced thrice seven and seven thrice, enduring hardship in their inquiries. They have traversed famous mountains, wandered blessed lands, sought masters, visited friends, asked about the Dao, listened to sutras, engaged in ascetic practices, and accumulated virtue through almsgiving. All such cultivation is but for this body’s great matter of life, death, and destiny—knowing neither whence it comes nor whither it goes, drifting and drowning, unable to escape rebirth. Thus they vow oaths and establish merit through conduct.\n\nSome, taking the cessation of thought and forgetting of emotion as the method of liberation, sit in meditation for three or five years, wearing out countless meditation cushions—yet when has a single thought ceased, or a moment’s emotion been forgotten? This is but the return of duality to unity.\n\nOthers, taking the refinement of lead and mercury as the method of liberation, practice the firing process from *zhun* to *meng*, advancing the talisman and withdrawing the fire—yet when have they seen the sevenfold return of jade liquid or the ninefold return of golden liquid? They seize the thief only to release him.\n\nSome engage in visualization and contemplation, silently paying homage to the Emperor in the Three Heavens. Others refine and deliver the suffering, liberating lost souls from the Nine Hells. Some summon spirits and command generals, wearing talismans to proclaim themselves perfected beings. Others guide qi to open the gates, circulating essence and qi to claim mastery of the wondrous Dao. Some recite scriptures and perform devout prostrations; others prepare elixirs to heal sickness and cure sores. Some refine and consume medicinal foods in hopes of ascending; others emulate yin and yang to practice absorption. Some, in crucibles and bellows, breathe to circulate true lead and extend life; others, in furnaces of cinnabar and fire, add and withdraw to refine *maogen*, establishing merit through almsgiving. Some, their bodies withered and broken, cling to the Way of the Golden Elixir, awaiting transmission by fortunate heirs; others, their karmic conditions shallow, practice the most arduous deeds only to let go at the precipice.\n\nAll such deluded cultivation, mistaking illusion for reality, is but side doors.\n\nDisciples, to cease thought and forget emotion, you must first inquire: Where does thought arise? From whence does emotion come? Only when you can grasp it firmly, press it steadily, recognize it truly, and point to it accurately may you then proceed to cease it, proceed to forget it. But I ask you: What is this that grasps, seizes, recognizes, points, acts, ceases thought, and forgets emotion? No matter how you cease thought and forget emotion, no matter how many cushions you wear out in meditation, thought remains thought, and emotion remains emotion.\n\nAssembly, to cease thought with thought is like adding a head atop a head; to forget emotion with emotion is like seizing a thief only to release him. Far better to forget even the method of forgetting emotion, to cease even the method of ceasing thought—both mechanisms forgotten, entering the gate of manifold wonders. Only then is it the supreme principle.\n\nDisciples, when I use a method to cease thought, I do not realize that the method itself is but another thought; when I use a method to forget emotion, I do not realize that the method itself is but another seed of emotion. Assembly, ceasing thought is not as good as thought ceasing itself; forgetting emotion is not as good as emotion forgetting itself. This is what is meant by ‘seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself.’\n\nDisciples, those who refine lead and mercury, who add and withdraw fire, who emulate hexagrams and lines—all pierce and break apart the Supreme Ultimate of Chaos. They mistake false names for true use, take metaphors for actual practice. They recklessly discuss the Three Fields, blindly guess at essence and qi, manipulate the mechanisms of the Seven Emotions, and the pivot of the Nine Orifices. They take the characters for ‘seven’ and ‘nine,’ ‘return’ and ‘reversion,’ to mean seven or nine *times*, seven or nine *cycles*, seven or nine *stages*, seven or nine *years*, seven or nine *transformations*. This one draws diagrams, that one produces images. They align the spine with Mud-Pill Palace, Tailbone Pass, Cinnabar Field, Vermilion Chamber, Yellow Court, and Flowery Pond, practicing water ascending and fire descending, warm nurturing and bathing, sealing and securing. Today it is Kan-Li Exchange, tomorrow Earth-Heaven Peace, the next day Soul and Spirit United. This year the infant is thus, next year the infant is still thus—even after nine years, they remain an old sinner unaware of death.\n\nUnaware of their own errors, they shake their heads, count on their fingers, and babble to outsiders: ‘On such-and-such a day I formed the sacred embryo; my warm nurturing and firing times were not mistaken; my bathing intervals were not amiss. Why, after ten months of gestation, has the infant not been born? Is it that my blessings are meager and my sins profound, that the spirits do not permit its completion?’ They clutch their bellies, their faces aged, their eyes searching, shedding tears in vain.\n\nYou should know these dull-witted, benighted beings, ignorant of their own minds, unclear about their own natures, lost in the karmic darkness—what principle do they understand? Yet such people are still those with hearts set on the upward path; it is only their delusion that prevents them from awakening to the upward mechanism.\n\nThe essence and qi within your bodies are the original qi and original essence of the prior heavens, a treasure neither increasing nor decreasing. If you manipulate them, you will not see them grow; if you leave them be, you will not see them diminish. This empty clarity that never fades is the original spirit. Since it is called the original spirit, why speak of it as an ‘infant’? For countless kalpas, your karmic offenses have not been dissolved, your obstructions not shed, the source of your heart not purified, the root of your nature not awakened. Instead of early repenting your transgressions, transforming your temperament, seeking a master, and awakening to the Dao, you turn this useful true heart to useless false affairs, wasting this limited time waiting for some illusory infant—what is the point?\"\n\nDisciples, that within yourselves which knows good and knows evil, knows right and knows wrong, knows deviance and knows uprightness, knows arising and knows ceasing, knows self and knows other, knows truth and knows falsehood—this is the infant. Yet this infant originally knows neither good nor evil, neither right nor wrong, neither deviance nor uprightness, neither arising nor ceasing, neither self nor other, neither truth nor falsehood. This infant does not cling to appearances; it is through encountering circumstances that the heart arises, through the heart that wisdom arises, through wisdom that knowledge arises. Through good, thus it knows evil; through right, thus it knows wrong; through uprightness, thus it knows deviance; through arising, thus it knows ceasing; through self, thus it knows other; through truth, thus it knows falsehood. Originally without the appearance of self, yet not the appearance of emptiness, it is merely this point of awareness moving in the world to respond to the ten thousand affairs. If we speak of the Supreme Polarity and Primordial Chaos, then this knowing can also be non-knowing. Yet this knowing is innate knowledge; in the Buddhist tradition it is called \"good knowing-advisor,\" while in the Daoist tradition it is named the \"infant original spirit.\" In sum, disciples, it is this single point of empty clarity that never fades—the essence of nature.\n\nHave you ever seen any Daoist, after entering the chamber to sit in meditation and speaking of \"conceiving the embryo,\" emerge after ten months to manifest the infant in radiant form? Before entering the chamber, such a one knows nothing of the conditions of heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, yin and yang, nor of human fortune and misfortune, future auspices and omens, the year of birth or the day of death. After emerging, they remain just as ignorant. Unclear about their own life and death, unable to liberate themselves, how can they liberate others? With their own life and death unresolved, fortune and misfortune unprophesied, bound by heaven and earth, living like ordinary people, dying no different from common folk—sharing the same clothing, food, and suffering in life, the same burial and stench in death—then is this entering the chamber to sit in meditation not a superfluous affair?\n\nDisciples, first die to the heart before entering the chamber; first sever the bonds of attachment before sitting in meditation. When lustful thoughts have long ceased, the kidneys are full and true lead ascends. When anger has long ceased, the heart is empty and true mercury descends. When diet is regulated and timely, the spleen is strong and mercury and lead are sealed and secured. When emotions are stilled, the lungs are moistened and the nature is settled; when the liver flourishes and kidney water abounds, the eyes shine and the pupils are dark as lacquer. When the fire of the heart is extinguished, the mouth is filled with saliva and its taste is sweet as nectar. When the hun-soul is clear, the liver qi flows smoothly and the sinews and bones are light; when the po-soul is at peace, the lung fluids flow and the hair and beard turn black. When the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonious, the tongue and throat are refreshed and the voice resonant. When the orifices are open and the blood abundant, the hundred diseases retreat; when the five flavors are bland, the upright qi arises. Practicing guiding and pulling exercises according to the four seasons and eight nodes, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness cannot invade. By restraining the six desires and seven emotions, taming the nature and subduing the heart, demonic and ghostly influences cannot encroach. By seeking the great Dao, the good heart appears and the true nature is illuminated; by awakening to suchness, the physical body is emptied and the Dharma-body is revealed. Only after self-liberation can one liberate others—yet this is still the liberation of oneself.\n\nDisciples, only at this stage have you truly taken the first step through the great gate. Then, entering the chamber to sit in stillness, above you may communicate with heaven, below you may penetrate the earth; the conditions of ghosts and spirits, the pivot of heaven and earth—all are grasped within the space of a breath, and creation does not extend beyond the palm of your hand. All this arises from discipline and concentration. Thus, when entering the chamber, one is of the ordinary womb-born body; upon emerging, one is of the sacred Dharma-body. With the great Dao illuminated, the eye’s perspective is lofty, seeing through all conditions as illusory and false; with a staff in hand, the heart’s breadth is vast, embracing heaven and earth into emptiness. Before the human heart stirs, I already know; before events arise, I foresee. Only then is one possessed of the six penetrations, wisdom boundless, all heavenly demons bowing in submission and secretly protecting one. The external paths of the ten directions submit in reverence and fear. Within a mustard seed, Mount Sumeru is contained unnoticed; within a grain of millet, the worlds of the ten directions are hidden unseen. When extended, the mountains and rivers of the great earth are at my leisure; when concealed, the body, fine as a speck of dust or a grain of rice, is at my disposal.\n\nDisciples, this supreme, non-doing, most true and wondrous Dao lies first in investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism. Therefore, you must set aside all those profitless affairs—blind cultivation and ignorant sitting, refining lead and smelting mercury, contemplative visualization, alchemical deliverance of the departed, assuming ranks and receiving registers, circulating qi and waving fans, chanting sutras and reciting liturgies, compounding medicines and burning thatch, consuming elixirs and gathering herbs, yin-yang furnaces and crucibles—and cast them all aside. With utmost sincerity, face heaven and vow with a resolute heart: from this day forward and into the future, may I early awaken to the mechanism of life, death, coming, and going; may I escape the suffering of cyclic rebirth; may I depart from all extremes and hear the wondrous Dao.\n\nAh! This phrase \"departing from all extremes\" is spoken directly to you—it is the great expedient gate to investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism.\n\nDisciples! What are \"all extremes\"? They are blind cultivation and ignorant sitting, refining lead and smelting mercury—all such side doors. What is an \"extreme\"? These side doors are neither central nor upright. Imagine a table: all these side doors lie at its four edges, unable to enter the heart. Even if they reach the heart, they do not depart from the table. Little do they know that only by leaving the table is there the vast emptiness of the Dao. Without leaving the table, it remains an object, not the Dao—is this not an extreme? \"Extreme\" means seeking, deviance, boundary, shore. \"Side\" means not central; \"deviance\" means not upright. With a territorial boundary, there can be no vastness; with a bank or shore, there can be no great clarity.\n\nClinging stubbornly to this sack of flesh, mistaking it for a thousand-year-old cypress or an evergreen pine, you strangle the true master within. Turning away to abandon the lamp in search of fire, clinging to the false and casting aside the real—is this not toppling to one side? Even if you succeed, you are but a self-liberated man. Never having seen your nature, though you attain a fruition, when your retribution is exhausted you still enter the wheel of rebirth, unable to transcend the three realms—what benefit does this bring to these sentient beings?\n\nDisciples! To become immortals, to become buddhas, to be sages, to be worthies—all lies in forsaking the self to follow others, in vowing to deliver all beings. Yet these meditators of today cannot even liberate themselves—how can they liberate others? Called self-liberated men, when have they ever understood the great Dao or delivered countless beings? Falling into partial cultivation, they are truly pitiable!\n\nThe True Lord spoke in verse, revealing the true mechanism, teaching the multitude to abandon the mind of self-benefit and to leave behind one-sided methods. Thus, side doors return to the central path, and heterodox teachings revert to the true Dharma. The limited territory is opened into boundless expanse, the vast world is stretched to reach heaven and earth, the gully with its banks is widened into shoreless vastness, and the unfathomable Dharma-body is extended to transcend self and other.\n\nAs the sutra says: *\"Seeing yet not seeing me, hearing yet not hearing me, departing from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.\"*\n\nDisciples, the gate of realization first requires opening the ground of the heart. From whence does life come? To where does death return? Draw near to enlightened and accomplished teachers, to wise and sincere friends. Cultivate a heart of goodness and investigate minutely.\n\nLife is like a cup of tea, confined by form, its water already flavored. Poured into the Eastern Ocean, it scatters into towering waves. If you seek your original source, adding the flavor of tea and calling it water, you still perceive form. Yet within this ocean, your original source abides—what then is your original source? Investigate carefully, probe deeply, until seeing yields no sight, hearing yields no sound. With accumulated merit over time, naturally one morning your breast will suddenly open, your vision instantly clarify, and your original face—bright and wondrous, the celestial mechanism—will appear. Only then will you realize that the great Dao has never failed anyone!\n\nDisciples, the sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas attained the Dao and ascended to heaven long ago. To see the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, first understand their principles. By understanding their principles, you awaken to their methods; by practicing their methods, you perform their deeds. By performing their deeds, you embody their form.\n\nDisciples, where does the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas reside? Only within the square inch of each person’s heart. Where do their principles reside? Only before each person’s eyes. Where do their methods reside? Only within the classics and histories. Their deeds do not lie beyond worldly Dharma but within it. Their forms, in turn, reside within their hearts.\n\nIf you know the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas within the square inch of your heart, you can understand their principles. Understanding their principles, you awaken to their methods. Awakening to their methods, you can practice their deeds. Understanding their principles, the true Dao abides. Awakening to their methods, all conditions are perceived. Practicing their deeds, merit and achievement are established. Then the celestial mechanism ceaselessly turns, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nKnow this: such a person’s divine powers and wisdom already embody the essence of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—this is their heart. Then, advancing to receive the Precepts of the Supreme Pole, you open the numinous mind, allowing the Mysterious Pass to become thoroughly clear, and thus understand the principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Next, advancing to receive the Precepts of Heavenly Immortals, you delve deeply into wondrous meanings, allowing wisdom to become all-pervading, and thus penetrate the Dao of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas.\n\nThen, unbound and unobstructed, you may be round or square, large or small, moving or still, advancing or retreating, living or dying, bending or stretching, exiting or entering, a sage or a worthy, an immortal or a buddha; you may traverse the four births, the six paths, heaven and earth, or hell. Adapting teachings to circumstances, you deliver beings across kalpas. Transforming without measure, you manifest bodies to expound the Dharma. Like an infinite bright mirror reflecting all forms and shadows, mutually containing one another—thus you practice the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, embody their forms, and realize their fruition.\n\nDisciples, at this stage, you are said to have investigated subtle principles and awakened to the celestial mechanism.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor lost his Mystic Pearl in the Red Water and sent Li Zhu to seek it. Li Zhu sought it in vain. He sent Qi Gou to seek it; Qi Gou also failed. Then he sent Wang Xiang, and Wang Xiang found it.\n\nThat Li Zhu—with his vermilion palace and crimson hues—is the postnatal clump of flesh that is the human heart. Thus, he could not find it, illustrating those who today rely on partial views of the heart. That Qi Gou, who cast himself into filth, represents those who cling to karmic attachments, purifying mouth and body, relying on fasting—even with such purity of heart, they cannot find it. As for Wang Xiang, how was he able to obtain it?\n\nDisciples!\n\n\"‘Wǎng’ means ‘without,’ and ‘xiàng’ means ‘form and appearance.’ ‘Wǎngxiàng’ thus signifies that which is without form or appearance. Therefore, it is not called a luminous pearl but the Mystic Pearl. Even the most sagely former master Confucius said: ‘That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.’ The Most High Ancestor Laozi spoke: ‘Inwardly observe the heart, and the heart is without its heart; outwardly observe form, and form is without its form.’\n\nDisciples, the supreme principle is originally the true suchness. Whether sages or worthies, immortals or buddhas, all abide in non-attachment to appearances in their cultivation. If one clings to appearances in practice, even the Yellow Emperor would be using wisdom, fasting, and abstinence to seek the Mystic Pearl.\n\nDisciples! The Yellow Emperor lost the Mystic Pearl and found it through Wǎngxiàng; the wondrous principle for ordinary people is attained through the mindless multitude. I have now revealed the celestial mechanism in full and illuminated the mind-seal. You must examine yourselves carefully and guard closely—should this Mystic Pearl in the Red Water be lost again, who knows where it may be recovered!\"\n\nThereupon, he admonished his disciples, who bowed in reverence and listened to the gāthā:\n\n\"Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures cannot exhaust it,\nOne direct pointing leaves nothing concealed.\nI urge you: do not toy with many methods—\nThe Dao resides in the heart, not in books.\n\nClinging to appearances in inquiry breeds scattered thoughts,\nIntentional sitting in meditation breeds demons.\nMany stray paths men insist on treading,\nYet none take the true Way—what can be done?\n\nThe true person is without appearance or form,\nA thread of celestial mechanism laid bare everywhere.\nPay no heed to the groping in darkness before you,\nNor cast aside the true path to enter side gates.\"\n\nAt that time, after Master Kunyang had completed the universal dedication with the great assembly, he charged his disciple Shi Shouping to compile the records into a volume and present it to the Vinaya Master for inscription to instruct later students. The Vinaya Master said, \"There is no need. As long as you transmit it faithfully from person to person, after one hundred seventy years have passed, it shall be established as the *Sutra of the Azure Garden Altar*.\"",

The True Words of the Mind-Dharma**\n\nIn the second year of the Kangxi reign, the cyclical year *guimao*, on an auspicious day in the tenth month, Kunyangzi expounded the precepts at the Blue Park in Jinling. Addressing Ningzhenzi Shao Shoushan and Fuyaozi Zhan Shouchun, he said:\n\n\"From my youth, I aspired to the Dao, seeing through the illusory nature of fleeting life and the impermanence of phantom realms. To escape the wheel of rebirth, one must early cultivate the supreme Way. Yet though Mount Kongtong lies near, Guangchengzi does not deign to meet; though Penglai is not distant, how can a mortal body ever reach it? One must resolutely distance oneself from defilement, sweep away all dust, purify the heart’s chamber, and cleanse the mind’s intent. Grind away ingrained habits until worldly thoughts turn to ash; sift the desiring self until delusive roots are severed.\n\nAll conditions suddenly cease, each step taken within the discipline of precepts and stillness. Myriad thoughts return to emptiness, each layer perceived through wisdom’s gaze. What is grasped can be stabilized; what is seen through can be endured. Thus, one raises the brows, wielding the blade that severs emotion; one strides forth, boarding the boat that ferries across the world. Turn the body, and liberation from rebirth is attained; shift the thought, and transcendence from the net is achieved.\n\nCompassion does not fade—so the ancients said, ‘Liberate yourself to liberate others.’ Benevolent vows endure—I resolve to liberate myself to liberate others.\"\n\n\"I recall my early years seeking truth and visiting the Dao, once journeying to Wangwu Mountain, where I encountered an enlightened master. Above, I received the boundless grace of the Three Treasures and heard the Dharma’s sacred teachings; below, I relied on my own strength, enduring austerities to cultivate the body. I took refuge in the supreme Dharma King, practicing the wondrous Mahayana Way. Now, in this flourishing age of peace and tranquility—a rarity across ten thousand kalpas, a sight unseen in a thousand lifetimes—how dare I not propagate the Three Treasures and repay the Four Graces? Though my offering is but a drop in the ocean, I humbly present the clarity of my heart.\"",

This is not for the sake of seeking fame through good deeds, but solely to dispel delusion and resolve confusion. Heaven’s law brooks no ornate speech; the supreme Dao resides only in forthright words. With reverence, I convey the seventh-generation tradition of the Dragon Gate lineage to this assembly. Humbly recording the unvarnished words from the Emerald Garden, I seek to universally benefit beings of heaven and earth. I dare not indulge in empty rhetoric—why not speak plainly?

This is my deepest aspiration.”\n\nUpon hearing this teaching, the disciple bowed and withdrew, standing in orderly ranks to the east and west. Then, the disciple Shi Shouping of Guangling prostrated himself and intoned:\n\n“The Dharma is originally no-Dharma, for the mind gives rise to it;\nThe mind is fundamentally no-mind, for the Dharma is empty.\nThe mind manifests the Dharma King, the mind manifests forms;\nThe Dharma returns to the mind’s lord, the Dharma returns to emptiness.\nTo clarify that the fixed Dharma is not the perfect sign,\nOne must awaken to the truth that the ordinary mind is the sagely mind.\nMind-Dharma, Dharma-mind, mind-Dharma-Dharma,\nThe mind-Dharma’s liberation—this is the true understanding.”\n\nII. Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures\n\nThe Three Treasures are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. The Dao is fundamentally empty, formless and nameless; without the scriptures, it cannot be made manifest. The Dao resides within the scriptures, profound and subtle; without a master, its principles cannot be grasped. Those who fail to take refuge in the Three Treasures will inevitably sink into heterodox paths, lost in confusion and delusion. All who cultivate the truth and study the Dao, and who wholeheartedly take refuge, must regard this as a rare and precious encounter.\n\nFirst, take refuge in the supreme Dao-Treasure, vowing that all beings may eternally attend the Heavenly Worthy and forever escape the cycle of rebirth.\nSecond, take refuge in the supreme Scripture-Treasure, vowing that all beings may, life after life, hear the true Dharma.\nThird, take refuge in the supreme Master-Treasure, vowing that all beings may study the supreme vehicle and avoid falling into heterodox views.\n\nThese Three Refuges are the first step on the ascending path by which the sages and worthies of old guided people into the Dao, the first gateway to entering virtue. All who attain immortality, the Dao, sagehood, or worthiness begin here, with the Three Refuges. Why is this so? For the matters of nature and destiny, life and death, are of grave karmic significance—subtle, secret, and seldom witnessed. Without a true master’s compassionate guidance to awaken the spiritual faculty, how could one suddenly awaken to the Mahayana’s true essence, gradually enter the wondrous Dao of emptiness, and avoid falling into heterodox views or straying into side doors?\n\nThus, those who have yet to understand the Dao first take refuge in the scriptures. Those who have yet to understand the scriptures first take refuge in the master. If one can take refuge in the Master-Treasure, then the Scripture-Treasure may be heard amid what was once unheard. If one can hear the Scripture-Treasure, then the Dao-Treasure may be seen amid what was once unseen. What was once invisible and inaudible suddenly becomes thoroughly clear—all through the power of taking refuge in the Master-Treasure. Naturally, one comprehends the true texts, gains insight into the correct Dharma, transcends life and death, and avoids the cycle of rebirth.\n\nHowever, the Three Refuges of which I speak must be the true Three Treasures. Why is this so? Great assembly!”",

      "translated_text": "Nowadays, the Three Refuges are treated as mere routine—morning and evening, one bows before sacred images and recites the words, yet never truly penetrates the essence of refuge, nor understands its purpose. Thus, one remains mired in deluded teachings and cannot escape the cycle of rebirth. How then can one comprehend the Great Dao and transcend life and death?\n\n*(Xie’s note: The above two passages concern principle and practice.)*\n\nWhen we speak of taking refuge in the Three Treasures:\nTo take refuge in *intent* is to render thoughts free from arising and ceasing—thus may the Dao-Treasure be understood.\nTo take refuge in the *mind* is to render its mechanism free from obstruction—thus may the Scripture-Treasure be awakened to.\nTo take refuge in the *body* is to render the eyes without sight, the ears without hearing, the nose without scent, the tongue without taste, the hands without reckless movement, the feet without reckless wandering; to avoid defilement by lust and craft, to practice austerities in person, to toil with sinew and bone, to starve the flesh, to weary the limbs, to abandon the form—thus may the Master-Treasure be moved to respond.\n\n*(Xie’s note: This taking refuge in the Three Treasures of intent, mind, and body constitutes the actual method of practice. In the initial stages of internal alchemy, refuge in intent gives rise to the true essence; refuge in the mind manifests the true fire; refuge in the body stills the form and solidifies the essence, generating true water. The first step in internal alchemy hinges on the clarity of the water’s source, and its clarity depends on two key factors: first, the body’s stillness ensures water’s purity, while its restlessness renders it turbid; second, the clarity of fire determines the clarity of water—when fire is impure, water is likewise muddied. Thus, refuge in the body and mind naturally facilitates the foundation-laying process, and when all Three Treasures are embraced in refuge, the practice advances layer by layer.)*\n\nOnly when one moves the compassion of the master to transmit the scriptures and impart the Dao must one first take refuge in one’s own body, mind, and intent as the true Three Treasures.

      "translated_text": "Should one maintain the body’s uprightness, cultivate the root through practice, and align the intent with the true and constant, then thought after thought dissolves into emptiness, and profound tranquility ensues—this is called taking refuge in the Three Treasures. *(Xie’s note: Taking refuge in the Three Treasures is none other than the supreme celestial immortal’s practice, namely, “uprighting the body, emptying the heart, and making thoughts real.” From beginning to end, it is no more than this—how direct and unobstructed! Though the practice has no discrete stages, it naturally advances layer by layer. Master Kunyang, in his compassion for later learners, has revealed the immortal’s mechanism in this scripture. Yet how可惜 that people today pass over it in haste, failing to perceive the meaning beyond the words, and instead treat this book as a mere manual of precepts and repentance.)*\n\nWhen the body refrains from deviant desire, the master’s treasure may be moved to respond;\nwhen the heart does not obscure its numinosity, the scripture’s treasure may be awakened to;\nwhen the intent is undivided, the Dao’s treasure may be illuminated. *(Xie’s note: “Undivided intent” means utmost sincerity without cease. See *The Heart Transmission of Celestial Immortals* and *Annotations on the Rain and Fragrance Heavenly Scripture and Mantras.*)*\n\nWhen the body is firm, essence is preserved and the form is robust;\nwhen the heart is numinous, qi is clear and wisdom flows;\nwhen the intent is sincere, spirit congeals and nature manifests.\nOnce essence and qi are abundant, spirit and wisdom transform—profound and unfathomable mysteries all arise from taking refuge in one’s own body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures. Thus do the Dao, the scriptures, and the master emerge from them.\n\nNow, let us speak of the method for taking refuge in the body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures.\nDisciples! Each of you must listen with focused mind, for I shall now explain the method of taking refuge in the body, heart, and intent as the Three Treasures, that you may shatter darkness and dispel doubt.\n\nDisciples! This body is formed from the father’s essence and mother’s blood, coalescing into shape within the womb—temperament, nature, countenance, and limbs all grown therein. A mass of filth, a sack of the four elements, eyes seeing, ears hearing, feet moving, hands swaying, mouth speaking, tongue tasting—none of this is enduring or inherently good. Those who use it well become immortals, buddhas, sages, or worthies; those who misuse it become demons, monsters, ghosts, or beasts. A single upward turn, and heaven may be ascended; a single downward turn, and hell may be reached. Those who receive blessings treat it as an external thing; those who receive misfortune take it as their foundation.\n\nHow much more so for you, disciples, who have left the household life to transcend birth and death? You must take refuge in this body—only then is it secure. Otherwise, the six senses turn outward, the three poisons arise within, and the ten thousand calamities, thousand disasters, nine demons, and ten hardships all stem from the body. How then can one cultivate and enter the Dao?\n\nIf you wish to take refuge, there is but one method to subdue this body: you must uphold the precepts and restrain the unruly frame. Let the four great deportments—walking, standing, sitting, lying—be your foundation, governing all with dignity and composure. Let the ears not hear sounds, the eyes not see forms; adorn yourself with a majestic and wondrous appearance, upright and compassionate, so that others rejoice at the sight and feel reverence. When the precepts harness the wild body, transforming it into a dharma-body, then refuge in the master’s treasure is achieved.\n\nDisciples! This first method having been made clear, you must next take refuge in the heart.\nDisciples! This heart differs from this body.",

      "translated_text": "Perils and strange transformations defy all measure—like wind stirring the sea, its waters deep and boundless, the gale’s force surging fierce, waves and tides churning in tumult, rising and falling beyond prediction, shifting and turning without reliance. Through kalpas uncounted, there has been no day of emergence, for the sea of suffering knows no shore.\n\nIf you now seek refuge in this heart, you must first recognize it as a mass of blood and flesh, no enduring or inherently good thing. It feasts on sounds and delights in forms, heedless of transgressing laws or incurring punishment; it craves sweet tastes, reckless of forfeiting life. It sinks into the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts without fear, submits to knife mountains and charcoal fires without dread; it drifts through pestilence and plague without refusal, conjures stars to fall and mountains to crumble without avoidance. All manner of calamitous causes arise from this heart’s beckoning. The six thieves lead the vanguard, the seven emotions command the host.\n\nIf you seek cultivation yet do not first take refuge in this heart, how can you subdue demons and tame apparitions, dispel the seven hindrances and expel evil, penetrate the primordial mechanism, attain the true Dharma, delve deeply into the宗旨, and ascend directly to the supreme vehicle? Yet to restrain this heart, you must abide by the precepts, enter samādhi with a tranquil mind, rein in the steed and wield the whip, turn back the wind and extinguish the flames. When the fire of ignorance blazes in this heart, quell it with the water of forbearance. Transform raging flames into the wind of wisdom, transmute ignorance into great insight. Shift evil causes into good fruits, dissolve sorrow and resentment into joy. Sweep sounds and forms away as floating dust, turn indolence into reverence. Let no delusion arise, no right and wrong be distinguished, no conflict between departure and stay, no oscillation between high and low, no shifting of gain and loss, no whirling or agitation. Naturally, qi settles and the heart is at peace; the heart at peace, qi settles—then refuge in the sutra-treasure is achieved.\n\nDisciples! Having subdued the wild heart of blood and flesh with the power of samādhi, the waves grow still, the wind calms, the moon rises over a tranquil sea, the pearl radiates its light, wisdom penetrates the sutra’s depths, and insight grasps its meaning. You must next take refuge in this intent.\n\nThis intent is even harder to restrain than the heart. The heart seeks rectitude, while intent lies in sincerity. Sincerity means meticulous care. In samādhi, within stillness, all is vividly clear, not a single hair’s breadth concealed, undivided and unceasing, movement and stillness as one, light shining universally. Thus, until you take refuge in intent, you must guard against the heart’s quietude. It may stealthily seize control, its mechanisms shifting and deceitful; its illusions branching and divergent, now appearing, now vanishing. It devises myriad paths, flickering between existence and nonexistence; its waves craft countless guises, like dragon or tiger. It cannot be grasped, now shadow, now wind; though you may clutch at it, no form is visible. A trigger’s release unleashes a thousand jun, yet no sound is heard; a single drop steers a ten-thousand-hu vessel, scheming ten thousand calculations. Its spiritual powers defy measure—stealing the sun and swapping the sky—its stratagems boundless.\n\nOnce you take refuge in intent, it dissolves like water, crumbles like tiles, and all things return to spring. You may enter sagehood and attain the real, ascend as an immortal and realize the Dao. In the world, you transform and guide; the nation is governed, the people at peace, the times harmonious, the years abundant. Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness; modesty, purity, chastity, and clarity—all arise from sincere intent. The three bonds and five constants emerge from it; the nine schools and three teachings are born of it. Between sincerity and insincerity lie fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing, good and ill, prosperity and adversity—all hinge on this intent. It is the cause of life and destiny, the retribution of saṃsāra.\n\nDisciples! Without refuge in this intent, this heart will never find peace. If you seek peace, take refuge in this intent. The light of wisdom will naturally shine brightly, and enlightenment will clarify all things. Before this thought stirs, it is serene and limpid. The moment it arises, it becomes either perverse or upright. Do not obscure the radiant light; the mechanism turns on its pivot, stars follow the Dipper’s course. When intent is sincere, you may wield the power of life and death. When intent is insincere, who holds the handle of saṃsāra?\n\nDisciples! Within your own heart lies the treasure of intent. A single thought of true purity can reach the heavens above and move the netherworld below. Ghosts and spirits pale before it; sun and moon dim by its power. Creation loses its authority, yin and yang their constancy. Demons and monsters flee its presence; beings and things vanish by its decree. Within the three realms, intent reigns supreme. Release it, and it exists; withdraw it, and it vanishes. Free and unobstructed, all is intent. Above, it ascends to the primordial as the ancestral qi; at the center, it returns to the numinous treasure as the brahma-qi; below, it abides in the Most High as the true qi. Extending broadly, it becomes the vast qi; coalescing gently, it forms the original qi. Compassionate and benevolent, it is the yang qi; sorrowful and wrathful, it is the yin qi. Greed, anger, and restlessness are the qi of blood; lust, killing, theft, and delusion are the qi of evil. Attachment and obstruction are the qi of demons; cruelty and darkness are the qi of monsters. Oppression and resentment are the qi of grievance—all these arise from you, disciples.\n\nIf the body does not take refuge in the master’s treasure, it leans toward violence and strength. If the heart does not take refuge in the sutra-treasure, it is often deluded and benighted. If intent does not take refuge in the Dao-treasure, it is entangled in chaos and confusion. Deviation from sincerity is to lose the center; losing the center, the light of wisdom does not arise, samādhi is not firm, the precepts are not strict, spirit does not congeal, qi does not gather, essence does not transform. Thus, the body cannot be cultivated, the heart cannot be stilled, and intent cannot be sincere.\n\nDisciples! I now reveal the great Dao, pointing directly to the human heart. If you do not swiftly subdue body, heart, and intent, transforming them into the true body of the Three Treasures, and liberate yourself from saṃsāra, then—one by one—take refuge in the world’s awakened teachers, those who first realized the sutras and the Dao. Do not squander this fine karmic opportunity of leaving the household life.\n\nIf there are those who, relying on the three great Dharma gates of precepts, samādhi, and wisdom, practice with unwavering faith, never wavering or retreating, know that such a person will surely attain the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "If even the slightest deviation occurs, and one cannot adhere steadfastly, becoming lax in one’s own practice, know that such a person bears deep transgressions and meager blessings, unable to perceive the Dao. Heavenly spirits will not tolerate them—how then could they hear the supreme, most true, and pure liberating Dao? Should you encounter such individuals, take care not to reproach them in anger. Instead, cultivate compassion, employ gentle persuasion, and skillfully guide them onto the Way—this is what it means to take refuge in the Three Treasures.\n\nThereupon, the precept-disciples bowed their heads in reverence, took refuge, and recited a gatha:\n\nThe great Dao is clear and void, beyond all naming,\nIts subtle wonders revealed through scripture’s text.\nWere it not for the master’s exposition of the primal truth,\nHow could the muddled and deluded ever awaken?\n\nClearly, continuously—this is called Perfection of Truth,\nAttaining the true origin, transcending life and death.\nThe first to know, the first to awaken, with earnest compassion,\nEndless worthies guide others through the gate.\n\n### The Threefold Repentance of Transgressions\n\nDisciples! Having taken refuge in the Three Treasures, you must diligently cultivate wondrous practices. The Most High has said: *\"Misfortune and blessing have no fixed gate; they are summoned only by oneself. The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow.\"* Thus, heaven and earth possess spirits that oversee transgressions, diminishing a person’s allotted years in accordance with the severity of their offenses. Even minor faults number in the hundreds—those who seek long life must first avoid them.\n\nTransgressions refer to faults and errors. Nowadays, those who cultivate the Way deceive their own innate knowing, betray their original nature, seeing only the faults of others while remaining blind to their own. This very blindness to one’s own faults means that transgressions run deep and karmic obstructions grow heavy. How can one who deceives heart and self ever enter the Dao? Therefore, repentance is essential.\n\nRepentance means reverently facing the sacred and true, daring not conceal past wrongs, solemnly vowing never to repeat former misdeeds—only then can one advance. I shall now, without fear of giving offense, clearly expose the ways of deceiving heart and self in this world. Disciples, listen closely, and you will understand.\n\nWhat, then, are the deeds of deceiving heart and self?\n\nOutwardly, one speaks in lofty, expansive terms, while inwardly coveting wealth and goods;\nExternally, one maintains appearances, while internally scheming with cunning;\nReceiving precepts yet failing to uphold them, urging others while fearing no blame;\nOutwardly a Daoist, secretly consorting with the unprincipled;\nWords spoken in the same hall go unheeded, yet in public affairs, one constantly justifies wrongdoing;\nHearing the Dao yet not practicing it, knowing the Dharma yet willfully violating it;\nUsing cleverness to deceive the foolish, seizing advantages as a foothold;\nHabitually stirring ignorance, often acting stubbornly;\nTaking non-being for being, being for non-being;\nTreating the false as true, the true as false;\nCalling a deer a horse, selling dogs as sheep;\nCommitting wrongs in secret, playing tricks in broad daylight;\nPlotting in the heart, hiding daggers behind smiles.\n\nSuch perverse conduct, each act turning away from the Dao—yet none of it is unknown to oneself. Those who remain unaware are fools, the deluded, the confused, the reckless. But those who knowingly commit such acts are what the ancients called the treacherous, the wicked, the perverse, the base. Is this not deceiving heart and self? Their transgressions far exceed those of the foolish and deluded.\n\nWhy? The foolish, lacking wisdom, act in ignorance and error, harming only themselves. If they harm others, they will ultimately be harmed in return. But the treacherous and wicked, cunning and deceitful, not only harm others for personal gain but also deceive themselves to conceal their true hearts. They strive to ensure that heaven and earth remain unaware of their schemes, that ghosts and spirits remain ignorant of their evil. They weave intricate deceptions, ever concealing their actions; they plot in secret, ever patching over their misdeeds. They set snares for others, yet none perceive where the trap was laid; they push others into pits, yet none discern who dug them. Such people exist in abundance in the world—yet they are utterly unfit for cultivation.",

      "translated_text": "Before taking refuge in the Three Jewels, if one harbored such a heart, now that one has received the precepts, one must transform and reform, swiftly seeking repentance. In recent times, the primordial wind has waned, the precepts have grown lax, the Dao’s transformation has declined, and the yellow-crowned have lost their teachings. Repeatedly receiving instruction from the feathered and flowing, many violate the rules and breach the precepts. I now spare no earnest words to admonish and exhort, offering counsel to all.\n\nNot only should one repent for the karmic offenses of eons adrift, for the karmic burdens of parents across many lives, and for the transgressions of one’s present parents, nine ancestors, and seven generations. Even the karmic offenses of one’s own past must be swiftly swept clean in the depths of the heart. All unrighteous deluded thoughts, every trace of wayward念, must be repented for their former wrongs, and past errors must be regretted—only then can one attain the fruits of the Dao. Otherwise, it is like covering one’s ears to steal a bell; how can one achieve liberation? The Great Dao remains distant!\n\nI now compose a repentance text for all to recite morning and evening.\n\n**Repentance and Vow Text**\n\nWe, the assembly of disciples, since receiving the precepts until now, have merely indulged in the empty name of precepts, failing to uphold them in truth. Our robes and crowns are falsely worn, and the rules and alms-bowl are but hollow traditions. We have neither advanced in the initial truth nor avoided falling into the depths of transgression. Lacking wisdom in our hearts, we have not earnestly sought guidance from enlightened masters; our nature, stirred by ignorance, has struggled to endure humiliation among our peers. Our minds are narrow, unable to embrace others with compassion; our perceptions are biased and crooked, leading us to commit many offenses. Unaware of true awakening, we mistake illusion for reality; failing to examine causes, we take thieves for sons. We regard the virtuous as outcasts, confusing right and wrong; we mistake noble ones for petty men, unable to discern truth from falsehood. Some have misled donors in matters of cause and effect, pocketing offerings for private gain; others have chanted scriptures with mispronounced words, their minds entirely heedless. Some, upon seeing beauty, stir lustful roots in their hearts; others, upon hearing sacred words, harbor doubts within. Such manifold misdeeds have forever bound us to the mundane.\n\nIf we do not renew ourselves from this day forth, as dusk approaches and the path narrows, we shall inevitably sink like stones to the ocean’s depths. Should we persist in recklessness, only when the bell tolls and the water clock runs dry will we realize the horrors of sword trees and knife mountains.\n\nTherefore, with this offering of the incense of the heart, the lamp of the heart, and the water of the heart, we exhaust the sincerity of taking refuge in body, mind, and life. Moment by moment, we gaze toward the crimson heavens, beseeching deliverance; morning and night, we look up to the golden palace, offering our devotion. With the utmost reverence of fasting and purification, we spare no toil in our efforts. Turning ourselves around, we bow again and again to the compassion of our teachers. We set forth offerings and implore the heavens for forgiveness!",

      "translated_text": "The above text of repentance and vows should be recited with reverence morning and evening. One must align one’s own dharmakāya with the Heavenly Emperor, offering sincere devotion with every thought and harboring shame in every heart. Each sentence should be recited with clarity, each word uttered with remorse and hesitation, advancing with courage and diligence. Whether in life or death, hardship or hunger, all must be relinquished. Only by upholding the precepts and cultivating samādhi can one secure a future path.\n\n*Jade Garden Altar Sutra, Volume One: Four Obstacles to Remove*\n\nFor the practitioner, if obstacles are not severed, one remains obstructed and deluded; if hindrances are not eliminated, one remains foolish and benighted. The essence of the mind is originally as bright as the sun and sky, yet delusive thoughts are but floating clouds. When mist veils the azure heavens, how can the sun shine brightly? When emotions obscure the spiritual apertures, how can the true mechanism attain perfect clarity? Is this not the greatest affliction of the practitioner?\n\nI now point out the root of this affliction: Daoist teachings speak of two kinds of obstacles—one called *obstacles of principle* (理障), the other *obstacles of phenomena* (事障). Without clarity in phenomena, truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished; without clarity in principle, right and wrong cannot be discerned. If one clings to principle while discussing phenomena, rigid and pedantic, this becomes an obstacle of principle to the mind. If one acts in ways that violate principle, perverse and wayward, this becomes a thief to one’s nature, an obstacle of phenomena. Whether in principle or phenomena, any attachment whatsoever constitutes an obstacle.\n\nNow, let us examine these two obstacles in detail.\n\nDisciples, the myriad scriptures and classics are all teachings left by those of prior awakening, guiding later generations to perform good deeds, cultivate virtue, awaken to the Dao, and refine the true. Yet sentient beings, instead of doing good, commit evil; instead of learning virtue, they learn wickedness; instead of refining the true, they engage in falsehood; instead of awakening to the Dao, they corrupt the teachings. This is called the *obstacle of phenomena* to the original mind.\n\nThere are also those who have left the household life, performing good deeds yet clinging to goodness, learning virtue yet clinging to virtue, refining the true yet taking it as real, awakening to the Dao yet becoming attached to forms and traces. All this stems from an inability to relinquish attachment to what is good—this is called the *obstacle of principle* to the original mind.\n\nYet even those with these two obstacles—of principle and phenomena—are still among the advanced practitioners. There is another class of practitioners whose minds remain unenlightened, whose celestial mechanisms have not turned. Everywhere they go, they generate obstacles. When they see advanced practitioners expounding scriptures and explaining precepts, they outwardly praise them but inwardly stir ignorance, harboring obstructive thoughts and igniting delusive impulses.\n\nDisciples, if this obstructive mind is not eradicated, how can one escape the sea of suffering? Though the boat and raft, sail and oar are clearly available to cross the sea, one cannot, dares not, cross—what is the reason? Know this: this obstructive mind is like a sudden surge of dark clouds, spreading and billowing, foretelling wind and rain, inevitably bringing perilous waves and treacherous tides. Thus, one dares not, cannot, cross.\n\nDisciples, the sea of suffering is boundless; turning back is the shore. The obstacles of the practitioner are like darkness rising on all sides, shrouding the sky in deception. Only when they are severed does the sea grow calm and the wind still, allowing one to cross in peace and ease, safely escaping the sea of suffering.\n\nHave you not heard what is said in the *Highest Emperor’s Original Deeds Collection Sutra*? “It is only because sentient beings’ obstacles are heavy that they cannot behold the compassionate countenance of the Celestial Emperor.” It further states: “All such obstacles—each of you must sever them.” Thus, the *Emperor’s Sutra* begins by expounding the severing of obstacles.\n\nThe method to sever obstacles is to generate great wisdom: do not give rise to doubt, greed, anger, lust, jealousy, killing, mundane thoughts, ordinary reflections, dullness, defilement, sound and form, right and wrong, love and hatred, discrimination, arrogance, or attachment. Concentrate the spirit and settle the mind; regulate the myriad spirits. Let the heart be as vast as the great void, inwardly and outwardly pure. Embrace all without rejection, contain all without exclusion. Do not allow external deviance to disturb the supreme Dao, leading one astray from the true source, corrupting the spiritual root, and stealing the supreme treasure. Otherwise, one will forever sink into the mundane stream, entangled in worldly nets, assailed by ten thousand demons. For hundreds of thousands of kalpas, one will not hear the wondrous Dharma, and spirits will seize and punish, leading one from life to death.\n\nTherefore, each of you should resolve with sincerity to guard the true source and not allow it to be lost. As previously stated, sever all obstacles—these are the clauses of obstruction. If they are not severed, the six senses will be defiled, the three karmas entangled, and purity will not be attained. Without purity, how can one behold the compassionate countenance of the Celestial Emperor? How can the seventeen great lights and thirty kinds of virtue be attained? It is through the light and virtue of the Celestial Emperor that all buddhas, sagely masters, and lords of the ten thousand heavens are manifested. The wondrous scriptures of the three volumes and five ranks all arise from the severing of obstacles.\n\nDisciples, the obstacles in the world are manifold. The *Emperor’s Sutra* merely points out the main events and practices to give you a general understanding and clarify the gateway to heavenly principle. You must understand that the subtle obstacles in the world are as numerous as ten thousand threads and a thousand strands—every thought and movement is too many to enumerate.\n\nFor example, when reading scriptures and reciting classics, the profound and subtle meanings within may surpass one’s limited wisdom, making them difficult to comprehend. This reveals that one’s spiritual apertures are not yet awakened and the light of wisdom is dim. If one is unwilling to humble oneself and inquire of the wise, this is dullness and defilement. Even after receiving clarification, doubt may arise, fearing the other’s words are not true. One may ask another, only to receive conflicting answers, leading to vexation. With countless paths and myriad scriptures, is this not an obstacle?\n\nOr, when studying scriptures with companions, if another is more familiar while one is still learning, and impatience arises—is this not an obstacle?",

      "translated_text": "Obstacles, obstacles! It all lies in whether the assembly can sever them or not. Thereupon, the preceptor of the Vinaya expounded the Dharma, saying:\n\n\"From the very beginning of the descent of the celestial mandate, the luminous decree has never been empty. It shines upon the terrace of the spirit, where not even the finest wisp can be concealed. Once the breast is suddenly swept clean and vast, the eye’s vision instantly becomes clear.\"\n\nFor those who have renounced the five houses and severed the bonds of affection—O assembly!—you have already understood the harm of obstacles. Yet the harm of affectionate bonds is even more dire than that of obstacles. How so? The mind of obstruction arises only when encountering circumstances; once the circumstance passes, it vanishes—its harm comes and goes in an instant. But as for the two words *affectionate bonds*, they are the karmic roots planted from beginningless kalpas down to this present life. Thus, sages, immortals, and buddhas have all exhorted sentient beings: do not cling to appearances, do not become entangled, do not indulge in attachment. The scriptures of the Three Teachings all urge later generations of the world: do not be ensnared by affectionate bonds. These bonds are the progenitor of all demons, the root of all harm. Repeated kalpas of delusion, countless lifetimes of downfall—all stem from affectionate bonds. The failure to attain the Way of liberation, the failure to comprehend the principle of true emptiness—all stem from affectionate bonds. In life, one violates the laws of the state; in death, one sinks into hell—all stem from affectionate bonds. Drowning in floods, perishing in fires, slaughter by bandits, death by the sword—all stem from affectionate bonds. The ruin of clans and the extinction of heirs, the breaking of precepts and the violation of rules—all stem from affectionate bonds. Nine generations suffering calamity, the decline of ancestral sacrifices—all stem from affectionate bonds. Birth, aging, sickness, death; the perversity of nature and mind; the frailty of the body; the stagnation of the Dao and its methods—all stem from affectionate bonds. The six senses defiled, the six thieves rampant, the six consciousnesses discriminating, the six paths of rebirth—all stem from affectionate bonds. Within heaven and earth, amid the five phases, the birth and withering of the myriad things, the arising and ceasing of the ten thousand kinds—all stem from affectionate bonds.\n\nIf you wish to leave the world, to transcend birth and death, yet do not seek to sever these bonds, to renounce affection and abandon attachment, and still hope to attain perfect clarity, immaculate purity, liberation, and freedom—such a thing has never existed. Let me first speak of the affectionate bonds of the laity in this world: those between ruler and minister, father and child, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, friends. The ancient sages have already spoken of the five *haves*, the five *stops*, and the five *perversions*, as well as the gradations of *emotions all attuned to moderation*, *cherishing kin and honoring the worthy*. All these are but the natural endowments within this spark of numinous awareness, by which they are ordered, regulated, and cultivated, each fulfilling its nature and destiny. Thus, the cosmos is preserved in perfect harmony. Within this undifferentiated primordial qi, there is no need to further renounce affectionate bonds—it is the pure, spontaneous, tranquil, and liberated Way, which we shall discuss at length another time.\n\nNow, I speak only of those who have left the household life—today’s assembly of benefactors here in this garden—who should also pare away all extraneous affectionate bonds. For all that is properly within your sphere and yet lovable, you must refrain from loving it. As if these bonds were already exhausted, examine each one clearly and restrain them in the past. O assembly! You remain utterly deluded by affectionate bonds. How so? That which the human mind swiftly and gladly seizes upon is called *affectionate bonds*: all things, great and small, refined and coarse; all people, kin and strangers, near and far...",

Even sacred mountains and grotto-heavens, celestial palaces and divine realms; even the Seven Treasures and Eight Rarities, the River Chart and tortoise omens. And one’s own body and mind, the five viscera and six bowels, teeth and tongue, essence and qi; mountains and rivers, the great earth, grasses and trees, birds and beasts, insects and worms—whatever the thought grasps with desire, whatever the mind dwells upon, whatever the heart imagines, whatever the spirit and qi fix upon, whatever the emotions cling to, whatever the nature delights in, whatever the mouth craves, whatever the body enjoys, whatever the dreams wander toward—all are bonds of affection. If even a single thought lingers, one is ensnared and cannot attain the pure, tranquil, and liberated Way, forever remaining a deluded and suffering being.\n\nO assembly! When deluded, affectionate bonds arise; when awakened, affectionate bonds vanish. You must be ever vigilant, moment by moment bearing witness. If even the slightest attachment to any beloved thing arises in the heart, you must sever it at once, allowing no further conditions to take root. If you love sleep, sit instead; if you love sitting, walk instead. If you love dwelling in stillness, let the spirit and mind become lively; if you love emptiness, let the numinous nature become void. With not a thread of attachment, no bonds arise. The awakened one’s heart radiates light, unshaken by circumstances, unmoved by things, undisturbed by affairs. Over time, the wondrous and boundless opens, and the primordial aperture is unsealed.\n\nIf today you do not eliminate them, if tomorrow you do not sever them, if you relinquish them yet fail to cut them off, you remain entangled as before. Then your monastic robe and alms bowl, your meditation cushion, become nets; your straw sandals and bamboo staff, become ropes; sacred mountains and divine realms, become prisons; fellow disciples and companions, become enemies. Even sacred incantations and true words turn into arsenic and poison; the Dao-heart and original nature transform into karmic rewards and asura realms. How can one not be cautious? How can one not grieve? How can one not bear to sever and cut them off?\n\nOnce there was a Daoist who, after long meditation, experienced a vision. He saw a radiance emanating from the crown of his head, resplendent with five colors, like clouds or brocade. Within that light, mountains and rivers, the great earth, and all things were visible. The Daoist rejoiced in his heart, believing he had attained the Great Unobstructed Light of the Supreme Emperor. Day and night, he sat upright, contemplating the light, but it never reappeared. Failing to recognize the vision as an illusion, he fixated on it, forgetting all other thoughts, thinking only of the light. As he persisted in this contemplation, he grew dull and witless, his body like earth or wood. Others believed he had entered the supreme Way.\n\nAfter six years of such sitting and concentration, his spirit congealed and his form altered, yet he remained unaware. One day, his breath grew coarse and labored. His companions kept watch, awaiting his emergence from stillness to seek the Way. Among them, only one practitioner recognized his possession by delusion. At midnight, the meditator suddenly flung his hands outward as if taking flight. The others lit lamps and candles, offering incense and flowers in reverence. Then his breath ceased, and from his mouth flew a moth, drawn to the flame, where it perished. The practitioner retrieved it and addressed the assembly: “This is the body of the Daoist who fixated on the light. His bond of affection for the light made him no different from this moth. When conditions ripened, his form transformed and entered another realm. If affectionate bonds are not severed, all meet the same fate. How lamentable! How imperative to cut them off!”\n\nO assembly! Where the heart harbors attachment, there is bondage. Bonds arise from affection, and affection follows bonds; bonds and affection entwine endlessly. Fathers become sons, ancestors become descendants, men become women; faces change, forms shift, names alter, yet deluded beings mistake these for reality. How terrifying! How pitiable!\n\nO assembly, take heed. The Six Precepts must be observed with utmost rigor.",

Therefore, follow the example of the ancient sages and worthies: gather the heart within the precepts.\n\nThis word *precepts* is the vajra that subdues demons, capable of suppressing evil and malevolence; it is the talisman that protects life, capable of increasing blessings and prolonging longevity; it is the ladder to ascension, capable of paying homage to the Three Pure Ones and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood; it is the lamp that illuminates the path, capable of dissolving the Six Desires and dispelling darkness and ignorance; it is the immortal’s boat and precious raft, capable of ferrying sentient beings across the sea of suffering; it is the compassionate bridge and ford, capable of delivering sentient beings from the river of affection.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, there are benefactors who offer alms—robes, crowns, and alms bowls—all prepared and ready. Such opportunities are rare in a thousand lifetimes, seldom encountered across ages. This is the karmic affinity you have met in this life. Having received the precepts, you must now carefully seek to understand the meaning of *jie* (precepts). What is meant by *jie*?\n\nAlas, those who receive the precepts vary in wisdom. The foolish may begin with good intentions, but after ordination, they obscure their initial resolve, unable to uphold the precepts. How lamentable—this original aspiration is abandoned, and the precept robe and crown are cast into the vast ocean. Some pawn or sell them, others refashion them into ordinary clothes or patch them into sleeves. They profane the celestial spirits and defile the sacred precincts. The pure alms bowl is repurposed as an incense burner, a vessel for money or rice. They break fasts, violate precepts, drink wine, consume meat—nothing is beyond them. Their wisdom is extinguished, and their immortal root severed.\n\nThere are living examples, clear and undeniable. Once, a precept-disciple violated his vows, defiled the precept scriptures, sold his robe, and discarded his bowl. He suddenly died and was seized by ghostly constables, bound in chains. Arriving at the underworld, he saw a majestic tribunal, its gates flanked by rows of ghostly soldiers, shackling many—all former companions who had broken precepts in life. Startled, he asked, *\"Why are you here?\"* They replied, *\"We do not know why, but one by one, we all ended up here.\"*\n\nAbove the gate hung a plaque inscribed with three characters: *Kao Dui Si* (Bureau of Examination and Verification). He asked a ghostly guard, *\"What is the Bureau of Examination and Verification?\"* The guard replied, *\"This is a newly established celestial ordinance. There are two judicial bureaus, specially tasked with overseeing the precepts of monks and Daoists. When someone in the world resolves to receive precepts, the local earth deity records their name. The date of ordination, days of merit, days of transgression, violations of precepts, betrayal of the Dao or teachers, defilement of scriptures, sale of robes, desecration of bowls, slander of precept masters, exploitation of benefactors, greed, lust—all are meticulously documented and reported monthly for examination. You must first pass through this bureau before proceeding to other tribunals. Those who receive precepts but cultivate virtue with unwavering devotion may avoid the underworld. But for those like you—who take precepts in name only—you will inevitably be summoned here for examination before your allotted lifespan ends. Without passing this bureau, no other tribunal will issue a warrant for your death.\"*\n\nThis precept-disciple revived after half a day and night, recounting this case. Listen well: when you criticize others’ faults, you are sharp and discerning, yet when it comes to your own, you remain blind. Day by day, month by month, you indulge yourself, accumulating boundless transgressions while concealing them—this is called deceiving the heart.\n\nThose who have received precepts must examine their daily actions and words, reflecting day and night. Do good, correct evil, and never justify or excuse yourself. If you err and fail to recognize it, immediately repent before the sacred immortals, weeping in remorse. Study the precept scriptures diligently, seek enlightened teachers, and pursue profound learning. Honor your teachers as parents, your fellow disciples as elder brothers, delight in the Dao as a wife, and cherish the scriptures as jade.\n\nHold the precepts in your heart as you would an object in your hand—once released, it is lost; once the precepts are abandoned, they are broken. The laws of the world punish transgressors with imprisonment; the celestial ordinances of the Dao, the statutes of Nüqing, mete out karmic retribution. Do not assume the underworld is unseen—life and death reside in your heart. Do not think the precept spirits are hidden—your every thought is known.\n\nThe four characters *jie xing jing yan* (precept conduct, pure and strict) mean: subduing the heart to align with the Dao is *jie*; patience and perseverance in practice is *xing*; untainted by even a thread is *jing*; unviolated by even a hair’s breadth is *yan*. Unchanging from beginning to end is *upholding precepts*; unwavering through hardship is *guarding precepts*.\n\nYet among you who have received precepts, how many remember even the Ten Precepts? This is precept-holding in name only—why bother? But if there is even one word of the Dharma, let it give all of you the resolve to practice sincerely.",

Should any precept-holder transgress, yet from that moment repent and reform, revealing a sincere heart, once more upholding the regulations with utmost strictness and purity, never daring to violate them again—if such earnest remorse and confession are offered, the heart of Heaven will naturally take pity, pardoning and restoring them to their original state.\n\nNow I shall relate to you all another tale of karmic cause and effect: one who transgresses the precepts yet later upholds them. A certain precept-holder once said that after receiving the precepts, he suddenly encountered demonic tribulations, breaking his fast and violating the precepts, committing every manner of misdeed. One night, he dreamed he arrived at the underworld court to witness the proceedings. There, he saw many ghostly clerks lighting gauze lanterns and setting up incense tables. After a short while, King Yama emerged from the main gate with the same majestic bearing as an earthly emperor. He heard an official report: “The celestial envoy has arrived. Quickly prepare the incense table to receive the decree,” no different from how earthly officials receive imperial edicts. The envoy was a celestial officer, wearing a golden lotus crown, draped in a five-colored cloud crane cloak, and holding a yellow scroll, which he presented before entering—none of the ghosts were permitted to follow. The dreaming Daoist also wished to enter. A ghostly guard shouted: “What wandering spirit are you, daring to approach this solemn hall?” Another ghost said: “He seems dressed like a Daoist.” The first ghost replied: “The recent decree ordered that those who cultivate and uphold the precepts, upon the end of their lives, may enter in full attire. Those with radiant light enter through the main gate; those with lesser light, the east gate; those without light have their Daoist names stricken, bound in shackles at the western side gate, and await trial by roster. You, Daoist, have no radiance—only a mass of black qi, no different from us. Impersonating a Daoist, be off at once!” With that, he brandished an iron rod.

      "translated_text": "The precept-holder immediately rose from his bed, hastily washed his face, took up pure fire to burn incense, and was filled with dread. Grieving and repentant, he vowed to reform his past transgressions and strictly uphold the precepts.\n\nOne day, he dreamed again of wandering through the underworld, returning to the same place as before. The ghostly guards wielding iron rods and shackles ran toward him, asking: “Where does the immortal master wish to go?” The precept-holder replied: “I was merely passing through and dared not disturb the King. I shall depart at once.” The ghost said: “The King has a rule: all immortal masters of radiant virtue who pass by must first enter the tea hall, take a seat, and have their names recorded for verification.” The precept-holder answered: “I have no official business; I shall not trouble you.” As he turned to leave, he suddenly found himself outside the realm. Upon waking, he recounted the dream to the assembly.\n\nIn his first journey, he was beaten and scolded by ghosts; in the second, they knelt to receive him and inquired after his name. The difference in treatment arose from the state of his own heart—had he not repented of his past faults, he would have remained as before. Behold the Dao of the spirits: the principles of the unseen and the visible are one. How can one not stand in awe?\n\nBrethren, time passes swiftly; let your nature be luminous. Do not wait until impermanence arrives, forcing you to wander in the dark underworld, where ox-headed guards offer no kindness and horse-faced demons show no mercy. If you have faults, correct them swiftly; all depends on the purity of your precepts. Among the myriad methods and thousand gates of cultivation, refining the mind is the supreme vehicle. In the boundless sea without shore, follow the precepts and let wisdom’s light guide you.\n\n**Seven: Enduring Humiliation to Subdue the Mind**\nThe foremost affliction of cultivators, the most difficult to remove and rectify, is the character for *wrath*. Whether clinging to the illusion of self or the illusion of others, the moment wrath arises, it is called the *fire of ignorance*—the foremost of the three poisons.\n\nIf wrath is not dissolved, it burns oneself within; if wrathful words are spoken, they burn others without. A single spark of this fire scorches the numinous gateway, reducing the Dharma-body to ashes. The six viscera cannot remain pure, the five organs cannot stay at peace. When the ear hears another’s insult, wrathful fire arises from the liver, and like wild flames meeting a gale, the ear’s faculty of hearing suddenly becomes as if sealed shut. When the eye sees another’s disrespect, wrathful fire arises from the kidneys, and like wild flames meeting a gale, the eye’s faculty of sight becomes as if veiled and obstructed. Before one realizes it, wrathful words spill from the mouth, while in the heart, the fire of resentment surges forth, and from the gallbladder, schemes of malice arise.\n\nAbove, one fears neither the gods of heaven and earth; in the middle, one fears neither life nor death; in the unseen, one fears neither cauldrons of boiling oil nor forests of swords; in the worldly, one fears neither beheading, hanging, nor exile. Yet with a single tongue, one forges a thousand kinds of karmic transgressions. Why do the ear, the eye, the mouth, and the tongue suffer such torment? It is because this heart of flesh cannot be subdued, relying on a mere breath of qi to wield power and authority. Yet when the moment of reflection comes, it turns as cold and insipid as ice.\n\nBrethren, all beings in the world are formed of blood and qi, and this root of wrath has been planted since beginningless kalpas. Thus, when matters align with the heart, joy arises; when they do not, that joy turns to enmity. When circumstances oppose the heart, wrath is born—this is the root of endless rebirth.\n\nYou have left the household life to escape the web of birth and death, yet if the root of wrath remains unsevered, the poisonous dragon will assail the celestial root. You seek liberation from the world because the burden of life and destiny is heavy; if wrath is not extinguished, qi will fill the lunar cavern. The nature is fundamentally good, but wrath transforms it into a poisonous dragon. Habitual wrathful fire burns the body; life is inherently eternal, but wrath turns it into a ferocious tiger. Constantly generating toxic qi, one loses one’s true essence in haste. Ignorance of birth and death stems from failing to treasure one’s nature and life; the failure to establish nature and life stems from the strength of fire. As a result, the six senses cannot be gathered, the four limbs tremble in vain, the five senses cannot function, and the pores scatter the fiery nature of qi, bringing harm in a hundred ways and shortening one’s heavenly allotted lifespan.\n\nBrethren, to eradicate wrath, first subdue evil thoughts. What are evil thoughts? The inability to endure humiliation. The great sage Confucius said: *“Teach with gentleness and forbearance; do not retaliate against the unprincipled.”* If the mind cannot endure for a single day, one remains an evil person for that day. How can an evil person enter the Dao?\n\nBrethren, those who cannot endure humiliation have hearts that cannot be subdued, like poisonous dragons and ferocious tigers—only knowing how to humiliate others, never tolerating humiliation themselves. They seek dominance and victory, seizing joy before others, wielding power and authority, speaking harshly and sternly; they play the hero, act the gallant; they seize profit and fame, boast of merit and power, bully the weak with force, and scorn the aged. Though they may sometimes act with warm hearts for the sake of others, they do not realize that while they may save lives, they may also take them.\n\nBeings are deluded and do not awaken; when have they ever considered the long term or pondered deeply? Heaven’s Dao is distant, and grudges remain unresolved—all because the root of wrath is not severed. Wrath inevitably seeks to humiliate others, unwilling to endure humiliation oneself. Yet there is a vast difference between being humiliated by others and humiliating others.\n\nBrethren, the concept of *humiliation* encompasses much. For instance, if one seduces another’s wife or concubine, one disregards the humiliation of her husband, children, grandchildren, ancestors, and clan. Yet if another seduces one’s own wife or concubine, wrath arises, and great evil follows. One thinks: *If this person seduces my wife or concubine, where is my dignity? If others hear of it, not only am I shamed, but the merits of my parents and ancestors, the reputation of my descendants, and the prestige of my clan will all be defiled and ruined. How can I let this pass?*",

      "translated_text": "The shopkeeper, moved by devotion, welcomed the precept-observer with joy, inviting him into the central hall to sit. He bowed, offered alms, and placed a coin of broken silver into the alms bowl. As the precept-observer was leaving the hall, he suddenly encountered the shopkeeper’s wife passing beneath the veranda. She could not avoid him in time, and after exchanging glances, he expressed his gratitude for the alms and departed.\n\nThat night, as he sat in meditation, his thoughts drifted to the woman, picturing her face. He rose at once, knelt before the incense, repented, and then lay down. Suddenly, he became aware of his own death, his soul entering a womb. He grew to adulthood, took a wife—her beauty striking, their marriage harmonious. One day, while walking along the road, he saw a Daoist monk begging for alms. His heart filled with joy. He invited the monk home, offered alms, and performed good deeds. Calling his wife to meet the monk, he knelt and bowed. Then, turning to the monk, he beckoned his wife with his hand. Instantly, fury surged within him. He rushed into the kitchen, seized a vegetable knife, and charged to slay the monk. But he stumbled, fell, and awoke—his heart seething with rage. It had all been a dream, his body drenched in sweat. Reflecting on the monk’s face, he recognized it as the shopkeeper who had offered alms; his wife in the dream was the woman he had passed beneath the veranda.\n\nDisciples, this precept-observer, though firm in his discipline, was still a beginner in his practice. His meditative concentration was not yet steadfast. Thus, his daytime sight and nighttime thoughts gave rise to delusion. The depth of his false念 plunged him into a dream, shaping its realm.\n\nAnother practitioner, unwavering in his precepts, had never spoken an idle word nor allowed his mind to wander. Though humiliated, he harbored no resentment; though struck, he did not retaliate; though cursed, he made no reply. He reflected only on his own faults, never blaming others. One day, while carrying a load on the road, he encountered a donkey rushing toward him. He stepped aside to let it pass, but the donkey suddenly butted him, knocking him to the ground. The beast then bit his clothes, tearing them, before running off.\n\nThat night, as the practitioner sat in meditation, entering a state of hazy absorption, a figure in white appeared and bowed in gratitude, saying, *\"I am the donkey that collided with you on the road. In a past life, we were bound by enmity, but now the grievance is resolved, and we are both freed. I have escaped suffering and will be reborn among humans. I have come to tell you: on a certain day next month, seek me at a certain place to aid in my deliverance.\"* With that, the figure vanished.\n\nThe practitioner saw and heard all clearly—it was neither dream nor waking. He rose and resumed his meditation as usual. When the appointed day arrived, he went to the designated place, where a family seemed overjoyed, as if celebrating a joyous occasion. Asking neighbors, he learned that a child had been born in that house the previous night. Hearing this, he was deeply alarmed. He memorized the name, vowing first to liberate himself, then others.\n\nDisciples, you may have entangled karmic roots from past lives, now coming to fruition. Precept-observers, you must rouse your own resolve: endure humiliation, release resentment, bear suffering, embrace hardship, forget shame, accept loss, reconcile grievances, and submit to adversity. Subdue this mind, enduring all. Wield the blade of precepts to extinguish the fire of ignorance at every moment; clothe yourself always in the robe of forbearance.\n\nWhen others strike or curse you, endure their scorn and slander, their mockery and insults—none of it can shatter your precept-mind. Even if falsely implicated, subjected to royal law and official punishment, struck by lightning from a clear sky, burned by fire or thunder, drowned in floods, robbed by bandits, seized by wolves or tigers, poisoned by snakes, afflicted by illness, oppressed by demons, haunted by ghosts, or tormented by spirits—even if the world’s desires twist words to ruin your reputation, or enemies hurl curses to harm your kin—even if there is no escape, your limbs severed, your body broken, with no means to evade—all these are the fixed karmic consequences of past causes, the inescapable fate you must face. You can only accept them with equanimity, aligning with the will of Heaven, repaying old debts, and resolving past karma.\n\nNever harbor resentment or defiance, lest you violate the precepts. Instead, reflect: if I am wronged by another, it is because I once wronged them. If I am oppressed, it is because I once oppressed others. All misfortunes, calamities, demonic obstacles, and disasters are the fruits of past deeds—self-created, self-endured. From the moment you receive the precepts, all evil karma dissolves with the mind. Naturally, the six desires fade, the three poisons vanish, body and mind grow light and healthy, the temperament becomes peaceful, suffering is healed, and enmities are resolved.\n\nDisciples, from beginningless time until now, accumulated grievances must awaken your innate goodness. For all debts and transgressions, willingly accept and repay them one by one. Sacrifice yourself to benefit others—only then is liberation attained. From this point, you will forever return to purity, to the original integrity of the great void, to the primordial source. Preserve the spirit, guard silence, and nurture the perfect reward-body.\n\nOtherwise, if past-life debts remain unpaid and present humiliations are not endured, the retribution of future lives will not spare you. How then can this body transcend? How can this mind become empty? How can this Dao be cultivated? If you cannot even endure these few words now, how will you ever reach the end of birth and death, attaining pure liberation?\n\nDisciples, forbearance extinguishes the fire of ignorance, naturally cooling the five viscera. Forbearance generates the waters of the Flower Pool, naturally harmonizing the six bowels. Forbearance satisfies the desires of others, naturally dissolving enmity and fostering peace. Forbearance expands your capacity, naturally broadening your heart and mind. When others humiliate you, if you do not take it as humiliation, the shame returns to them.",

When desire is extinguished, within this perishable body, the Dharma-body is born, and only then can one escape the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThese are our true words—do not treat them as idle talk and let them pass. Recently, there was a lay disciple, a man of profound devotion in his daily practice, who one day went forth to solicit alms and provisions. Passing by a rice shop, he held out his alms bowl.",

If I can endure, my heart and qi will be at peace, preventing the liver’s fire from blazing and transforming it into the Southern Dipper’s disaster-dispelling light.

If I can endure, the spleen’s earth will not parch, lightening the body and bringing ease, transforming into white snow and yellow sprouts.

Those who can endure in the household will surely benefit their kin. Those who can endure in the body will surely benefit their spirit. Those who can endure in the heart will surely benefit their nature and life. Those who can endure in teaching will surely benefit their Dharma kin. Such are the benefits of endurance.\n\nIf one cannot endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, the heart will not be empty, the spirit will not be numinous, the qi will not be robust, the capacity will not be vast, the chest will not be open, the aspirations will not be great, the merits will not be complete, the conduct will not be fulfilled, the vision will not be penetrating, the thoughts will not be profound, wisdom will be small, blessings and virtue will be shallow, and the root foundation will be weak. The Dao will not be clearly heard, its practice will be obstructed, one will be despised by others, incite jealousy, invite disgust, provoke vexation, be treated with contempt, suffer frequent ghostly reproach, experience nightmares and terror, endure divine rebukes in waking life, and suffer from scabies, leprosy, rashes, and madness. The roots of karmic grievances from many kalpas will not fade, and the retribution of future lives will grow deeper. The sea of suffering will not cease its waves—how then can one stir up storms from nothing?\n\nDisciples, have you not heard that virtue is the root? Only with forbearance does virtue become great. Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. Among you, the worthy and the foolish are not equal. Some lose virtue for wealth, some for beauty, some for pride. Though the external circumstances differ—whether humiliated for wealth, beauty, or pride—the humiliation is the same.\n\nThe sages said: *\"A moment’s anger makes one forget oneself and one’s kin.\"* They also said: *\"When angry, think of the consequences.\"* Master Zeng said: *\"When the heart harbors anger and rebellion, it cannot attain its proper state.\"* Is not the precept of forbearance weighty? Is not the harm of wrath and anger poisonous?\n\nThus, the true patriarchs took the restraint of anger as the gateway, forgetting anger to enter the Dao. They took forbearance as the slaying of the heart and the forgetting of humiliation as the fulfillment of vows.

      "translated_text": "Disciples, awaken swiftly and heed my verse:\n\n\"Swiftly dissolve the marks of self and others,\nHasten to realize the cause of birth and death.\nForbearance subdues the fire of wrath,\nAnd in emptiness the Dharma-body appears.\nThe seven emotions perish with each thought,\nThe hundred forbearances praised by ancients.\nWillingly bear the weight of karmic sins—\nOnly then is one beyond the kalpas.\n\nMyriad karmic obstacles are past causes,\nDebts owed and repaid are all the same.\nFoolishness and ignorance breed grievance, wrath erupts,\nA mass of karmic entanglement, dark and boundless.\nIn cultivation, never seek advantage—\nIf I gain, others will not comply.\nThrough kalpas adrift, grievances unresolved,\nThe Hall of Purity teems with strife.\n\nStrife finds no foothold where heaven is vast,\nImmortals and asuras differ thus.\nThe Cool and Blessed Land thrives on much forbearance,\nRepaying humiliations, the Dao’s work is complete.\nThis mortal frame ascends the Dao’s path—\nWhy refuse to bear another’s wrong?\nRaging fury sets the skin ablaze,\nThe homeless true person suffers hungry ghost’s fate.\"\n\n**The Eightfold Purity of Body and Mind**\n\nDisciples, having taken the precepts and sought refuge, you must now single-mindedly seek liberation from the world, transcending birth and death. Yet those who transcend birth and death possess the supreme, deathless, and birthless vehicle of the highest Dao—this Dao is the turning of worldly dharmas, fundamentally devoid of any fixed method.\n\nWorldly dharma and transcendent dharma differ only in the mind; their application may be inverse or compliant, yet in truth they are one dharma. This dharma is not merely the inverse use of compliance. To employ the inverse within compliance is to return the myriad dharmas to the non-doing Dao, a mechanism even spirits cannot fathom. To follow compliance within the inverse is to disperse one dharma into myriad dharmas, where yin and yang do not escape its calculation.\n\nThis is not a matter of deliberate action or mental deliberation, but rather the luminous wisdom of inherent nature, which is originally thus—not some separate transcendent dharma. Yet who transcends the world? Ultimately, one must send this person beyond the world to the world’s outer realm—yet this, too, is not it.\n\nNow, I urge you to transcend this body from the world. But in the vastness of heaven and earth, the breadth of the cosmos, where is this \"outer realm\"? Disciples, listen closely: the \"outer realm\" lies beyond worldly dharmas. Seeing through worldly dharmas as unreal, illusory passions as false, all conditioned actions and merits as dreams—where every phenomenon is insubstantial, every event unreal—only then can this mind attain the outer realm.\n\nDisciples, how can this mind transcend the world? Consider:\nHeaven’s cycles of cloud and clear cannot transcend;\nEarth’s collapses and landslides cannot transcend;\nThe waxing and waning of sun and moon cannot transcend;\nThe falling of distant stars cannot transcend;\nWind, clouds, thunder, rain, frost, snow, mist, and dew—each bound by its measure—cannot transcend;\nMountains crumbling, stones splitting, waters drying, springs depleting, grasses withering, trees rotting, metals smelting, jade shattering—cannot transcend;\nHumans’ birth and death cannot transcend;\nThings’ growth and decay cannot transcend;\nAffection’s depth and shallowness cannot transcend;\nQi’s inhalation and exhalation cannot transcend;\nThe mind’s movement and stillness cannot transcend;\nEssence’s leakage cannot transcend;\nSpirit’s dullness and dissipation cannot transcend;\nPower’s rise and fall cannot transcend;\nProfit’s gain and loss cannot transcend;\nAll conditioned things are bound to formation, abiding, decay, and dissolution—birth, aging, sickness, and death—how can they transcend?\n\nDisciples, you must awaken to transcendent dharma within worldly dharma. This transcendent dharma does not lie in verbose speech but in the return of this mind. Once you know that heaven, earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly affairs are not the dharma of transcendence, you realize they are all confined within the snare of the world. If you can awaken within the mind to this truth—seeing that heaven, earth, and the myriad things are impermanent, that worldly dharmas and human emotions are illusions—what then is the true spirit?\n\nThis true spirit is formless and imageless, odorless and soundless. Speak of it as within, yet it is not confined to within; speak of it as without, yet it does not come from without. It is possessed by all, inherent in all things—this is the Dharma-king of transcendence. Disciples, this Dharma-king of true spirit pervades the cosmos, ancient and present, existing in all things at all times—it is no trifling matter.\n\nIn Buddhism, it is called the wondrous luminous true mind; in Confucianism, the luminous virtue of utmost goodness; in Daoism, the perfectly luminous Dao-mother or the primordial qi. Its many names are beyond enumeration.\n\nWhere does this knower of heaven, earth, the myriad things, human emotions, and worldly dharmas reside? It is found in the *Great Learning*: \"Illumine the luminous virtue and rest in utmost goodness.\" This luminous virtue of utmost goodness dwells within formation, abiding, decay, and dissolution—within birth, aging, sickness, and death—as the deathless and sickness-free true spirit. It has endured from ancient times to the present, ever-present and undimmed. It penetrates heaven and earth, emerges from darkness and enters the unseen. It is unborn and unchanging, neither increasing nor decreasing, neither lacking nor surplus, neither coming nor going.\n\nIt governs yin and yang yet is not obstructed by them; it commands spirits and gods yet is not hindered by them. It employs the myriad things yet is not misled by them; it transforms human emotions yet is not moved by them. It responds to worldly dharmas yet is not drowned by them. It transcends the world yet abides within it. It roams the three realms freely, unbound; it governs the myriad spirits, its transformations profound and unfathomable. Above heaven and below earth, it alone is supreme, without equal.\n\nYet this true spirit, though possessed by all, is rarely understood. The myriad dharmas, the thousand gates, the three vehicles, and the entire canon all arise from it.",

      "translated_text": "These subtle apertures, these profound mechanisms—realize them, and they lie before your eyes; miss them, and they sink to the ocean’s depths.\n\nDisciples, know that to leave the world and cultivate the Way, you need not go beyond the two words: *body* and *mind*. The body is provisional, the mind is true; the mind is provisional, the nature is true. You must awaken to the truth of refining the real by means of the provisional. Outer forms are provisional, inner reality is true; outer phenomena are form, inner reality is emptiness. Without relying on the provisional, conditioned form-body, you cannot cultivate the inner, unconditioned Dharma-body. Without the outer body of birth, aging, sickness, and death, you cannot realize the inner mind of serene perfection. Without the mind of luminous responsiveness, you cannot transcend and verify the boundless, limitless nature.\n\nYet this nature comes from the Mandate of Heaven. From the moment of birth, it is utterly unstained, one in substance with the Great Void, equal in measure to the Great Void. Empty and vast, it possesses nothing; whole and undivided, it lacks nothing.\n\nDisciples, if you now seek to leave the world, first purify body and mind. What is the practice of purifying body and mind? The body is formed of blood and qi, and blood and qi are not indestructible—they are the root of birth and death, the source of calamity and suffering. They entangle the mind and ravage the nature. Lust and desire arise from this body’s pursuit of pleasure; strife for fame and profit arises from this body’s pursuit of comfort. Violations of the law, punishments, disasters, and illnesses all originate from this body.\n\nThe Most High said: “People suffer because they have a body; if I had no body, what suffering would there be?” The ancients said: “If one is not burdened by form, before one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Immortal.” Clearly, this body is no small source of trouble. You must see through this skin-bag as a provisional thing, composed of earth, water, and wind. If cultivation is not pursued to the utmost, and one merely exhorts others to filial piety—saying that body, skin, and hair are received from one’s parents and must not be harmed—then know this: father’s essence and mother’s blood, the five agents in harmony, receive the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, the divine workings of yin and yang. The head is round like Heaven, the feet are square like Earth; standing between Heaven and Earth, humanity ranks among the Three Powers. Among the myriad things, humans are foremost. Above, they may match Heaven and Earth; in the hidden, they may assist spirits and gods. Through learning, they may approach sagehood; through cultivation, they may become immortals or Buddhas. How can one regard this most noble and richly endowed body as a stinking, filthy clod of earth? The intent is only to warn disciples against complacency and worldly delusion, to prevent them from seeking comfort for the body of form and instead return the true nature to its original constancy. Aspire to govern yin and yang with your will; adorn the Dharma-realm with your form and spirit. If the Dharma-body remains leaky, form and spirit cannot both attain perfection and merge with the Dao in truth.\n\nDisciples, I now explain the practice of purity to you. To purify this body, first cast aside worldly things, sever worldly attachments, and distance yourself from all worldly dharmas. Embrace simplicity and delight in tranquility; forsake rich flavors and shun clamor. Take refuge in the Three Jewels, and steadfastly uphold the One Truth. Cultivate a peaceful disposition; keep your hands and feet dignified and composed. Let your eyes and ears not stray into deviance; let your thoughts not scatter in distraction. Do not indulge in mental fabrications; do not raise your voice in loud speech. Gather the spirit-light of your two eyes to inwardly illuminate the unwavering mind-terrace; return the essence-apertures of your two ears to inwardly listen to the constant sound of Heaven’s harmony. Speak sparingly, and when silent, rest in natural stillness. Strive to be free of regret and resentment; let your thoughts not drift idly. Let your spirit be free of agitation, your celestial mechanism clear and smooth, the profound principle perfectly realized. Abstain from meat and fish to silently dissolve the karmic retribution of many lifetimes’ killing. Uphold the precepts with your body, and secretly practice the dignified conduct of the Four Great Elements. Let your feet not wander aimlessly, lest your mind grow restless; let your hands not move recklessly, lest your mind grow impatient. When sitting, be upright and centered, not leaning or slouching; when lying down, remain alert, avoiding excessive drowsiness. Eat plainly and reduce flavors, that the five viscera may be calm and harmonious; speak with care and composure, that your voice may be gentle and smooth. This is called the coarse practice of bodily purity.\n\nAs for the subtle work, you must delve into the meaning of “purity.” Do not fear that you cannot penetrate the heart and put it into practice; fear only that you will not investigate with sincerity and fail to realize the Dao.\n\nDisciples, a mind without dual thoughts is called *pure*; thoughts without杂乱 are called *still*. A mind unattached to forms is called *pure*; thoughts without stagnation are called *still*. Thought after thought perfectly luminous is called *pure*; luminosity without obstruction is called *still*. Unstained by a single speck of dust is called *pure*; all worries emptied is called *still*. No form escapes its perception—this is called *pure*; no spirit or god can fathom its mechanism—this is called *still*. A mind like flowing water is called *pure*; a nature like the bright moon is called *still*. The sins of beginningless time extinguished—this is called *pure*; the causes of countless kalpas thoroughly exhausted—this is called *still*. Inwardly observing the mind, the mind is no-mind—this is called *pure*; outwardly observing things, things are no-things—this is called *still*. Realizing the Three Truths—this is called *pure*; seeing only emptiness—this is called *still*. Observing emptiness, emptiness is also empty—this is called *pure*; emptiness is empty of emptiness—this is called *still*. When what is emptied is gone, and even emptiness of emptiness is gone—this is called *pure*; serene and ever still, stillness without stillness—this is called *still*. Truly constant in responding to things—this is called *pure*; constantly responding, constantly still—this is called *still*. Luminous and unobscured—this is called *pure*; entering the gate of all wonders—this is called *still*. Transcending the Three Realms—this is called *pure*; liberated from the Five Agents—this is called *still*. Shattering empty space—this is called *pure*; pulverizing empty space—this is called *still*. Light embracing all heavens—this is called *pure*; universally ferrying all beings—this is called *still*.\n\nDisciples, I have briefly outlined the essentials in my instruction. The sages of the Three Teachings, the great canon of scriptures, the myriad dharmas and thousand gates, the wondrous forms of all heavens—",

Instead, enter the gate of purity and stillness: extinguish deluded thoughts, quiet wayward intentions, and proceed steadily along the great middle path. Have no fear; this is called *\"delaying is better than erring\"*—when there is a road, do not board a boat.

      "translated_text": "Since ancient times, sages, immortals, and buddhas—all who realized fruition and attained truth—did so only through a teacher. Thus, the transmission passes from master to master, mouth to mouth, heart to heart. In this, the principle is consistent and all-pervading. Like milk and water blending, or glue and lacquer uniting, like attracts like, sound responds to sound, water and sky merge as one, and lamp and flame shine together—only then is the way of master and disciple fully realized.\n\nDisciples, I observe that many in the world seek teachers and inquire after the Dao, yet most err slightly. They bear the name of master-disciple transmission but lack its true essence. Therefore, today I spare neither words nor fear of slander to explain the principle of seeking a teacher and inquiring after the Dao. You must bear this in mind, for in the future, when you first serve as another’s disciple, if you uphold this propriety, then later, when you become a teacher, your own disciples will follow the ancient model and emulate it. To honor the teacher is to revere the Dao.\n\nDisciples, the world is full of blind and deluded fools who do not recognize their own minds and are swept along by external things. Though they harbor thoughts of the Dao, they do not know the gate of right and wrong; though they possess the heart of the Dao, they do not understand the method of cultivation. They hear the saying, *\"Nature is realized through self-awakening; destiny is transmitted through a teacher,\"* and take it as their guide. Then, they may encounter some wandering Daoist—clad in tattered robes, straw sandals on his feet, a palm-leaf fan in hand, a rush mat slung over his shoulder—passing through towns, sitting by the roadside with a begging bowl, or strolling leisurely along the way. He finds lodging in temples and monasteries, speaking of secret formulas, his tongue like a reed organ’s pipes. He expounds on the Mysterious Pass, the Gate of Tailbone, the Sea of Qi, the Mud Pill Palace above, the Bubbling Spring point below. He teaches how to guard the center and draw qi, to establish the cauldron and set the furnace, to prolong life and ward off illness, to practice massage and guiding exercises. He recites the Six-Syllable Formula, the Eight Brocades, the *Awakening to Reality*, the *Triple Concordance*, along with metaphors from alchemical classics—lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, silver and cinnabar, husband and wife, the hexagrams of sun and moon, the nurturing of tortoise and snake, the bathing and conception of the embryo, the sealing of the chamber and sitting in meditation, the emergence of the yin spirit and the yang spirit.

      "translated_text": "Oh, assembly! This august and celestial Dao of the Supreme Heaven—dim and indistinct, profound and obscure—is most vast, most great, most high, most revered; most mysterious, most hidden, most secluded, most subtle. It is so great that nothing lies beyond it, so small that nothing lies within. It can weave the heavens and warp the earth, emerge from darkness and enter the unseen. Now present, now absent, it enters water yet is not drenched, enters fire yet is not burned. Without past or present, it gives birth to heaven and earth, sets the sun and moon in motion, and nurtures the ten thousand things. It gives rise to sages and worthies, immortals and buddhas. Even the wriggling and the sentient—from insects to grasses and trees—all possess it, and nowhere does it not abide. In daily use and common practice, it is nothing but the wondrous Dao. Yet because the common folk employ it daily yet remain unaware, and lesser men’s hearts are deluded and fail to awaken, the One True is lost in an instant, and across ten thousand kalpas, clarity remains elusive. Before father and mother were born, the true spirit knows not its beginning; after essence and spirit depart, this body knows not its end. Thus, trapped in the cycle of inversion, they suffer the torments of birth and death.\n\nTherefore, I point to the root and source, urging all to seek a true master with haste and hear the supreme Dao without delay. Yet true masters are hard to meet, and worthy disciples hard to encounter. Know this: if a disciple lacks the true resolve to transcend the world, obstacles will cloud their wisdom-nature. Even if they chance upon a true master, spirits will prevent them from seeing, veiling their wisdom-nature, so that even if they do see, they cannot recognize the master’s authenticity. If a master lacks the resolve to deliver the world, even if they meet a worthy disciple, spirits will likewise obscure their Dharma-eye, deeming them without karmic affinity, and many such opportunities will slip away before their very eyes.\n\nOh, assembly! When a master seeks a disciple, it is like tossing a mustard seed to find a needle; when a disciple seeks a master, it is like grasping at the moon in water. True masters are rare, worthy disciples hard to find—not in the exchange of wealth and treasure, but only in the sincerity of a single thought. Have you ever seen a master of the Dao recklessly transmit to the unworthy? Have you ever seen a seeker of the highest Way carelessly bow to any master?\n\nOh, assembly! Since masters do not recklessly transmit to just anyone, such a master harbors the supreme Dao and seeks a worthy disciple. Since disciples do not carelessly bow to any master, such a person possesses keen insight and remains vigilant. Suppose there are those who refuse to lightly seek masters or recklessly bow to the Dao: their minds are free of obstacles, their aspirations lie beyond the dusty world, their vision is broad, and their hearts expansive. When they encounter a master of the Dao, they naturally perceive clearly beyond the surface, able to speak of it and discern it thoroughly. A single word or half a phrase—like a mustard seed finding a needle—aligns perfectly with the needle’s eye.\n\nSuppose there are masters who do not recklessly accept disciples or lightly transmit and teach: when they meet such discerning disciples, how could they not joyfully engage in profound discourse, exchanging wondrous secrets, true principles, subtle celestial mechanisms, and the most esoteric mysteries of the profound and arcane? Through the heart, they transmit the supreme Dao; through the mouth, they bestow celestial teachings.\n\nOh, assembly! True masters are not few, and disciples are many. Let me tell you why true masters are not few. Oh, assembly! Within the six senses you possess, all may become true masters. For instance, if your ear hears virtuous words and you wholeheartedly embrace and follow them, then the ear-root becomes your introductory master, and those virtuous words become your transmitting master. The same applies to the other five senses.\n\nOh, assembly! In learning, there is no fixed master—only the Dao is the master. Whenever you hear good and virtuous words, you must listen with focused spirit, as if sweet dew were dripping into your heart or ambrosia were pouring upon your crown. Silently, you should reflect on how this person has opened your delusion with compassion and skillful means, and wish that this proclaimer of virtuous words may swiftly realize the mysterious workings and attain the supreme Dao. Is this not a master-disciple relationship?\n\nFor example, if your eyes behold scriptures, texts of the Three Teachings, true words, or secret formulas, and your heart awakens in understanding, you should bow in reverence and praise. Such texts become the ones you recognize as true and believe in utterly, and naturally, master and disciple meet. Yet the master’s compassionate vessel and Dharma-bridge are not of a single method. Mencius said: “Teaching has many methods—some cultivate virtue, some develop talent, some answer questions, some privately instruct distant disciples. All are but forms of teaching.”\n\nThus, some delight in each other at first meeting, bonding instantly; some begin as strangers, neither acknowledging the other; some bow deeply and kneel to transmit; some exchange vows and offerings before transmission. Reverence is the prelude to ritual, yet reverence without substance is no reverence at all. What matters is observing the disciple’s sincerity, steadfast conduct, and respect for master and Dao.\n\nTherefore, some masters test repeatedly before transmission, as Yunfang tested Dongbin ten times. Some humble themselves before meeting, as Liu Xuande thrice visited the thatched cottage. Some follow their master for many years without wavering in resolve. Some, though knowing another’s sincerity, deliberately impose trials. Is the transmission of the Dao and reception of teachings a trivial or easily obtained matter? Thus, there are those who speak not a word in the presence of three, nor transmit where six ears may hear.\n\nFor the supreme teachings of the Dao cannot be imparted to those of middling or lesser capacity, just as middling or lesser teachings cannot be given to those of superior wisdom. Teaching must be tailored to the person. As in Confucius’ gate, when Ran You asked whether one should act upon hearing something, the Master said, “Act upon it.” When Zilu asked the same, the Master said, “With father and elder brother still living, how could you act upon hearing it?” For Qiu was retiring, so he urged him forward; You was overbearing, so he held him back. These teachings could not be shared indiscriminately. Thus, when Gongxi Hua heard both, he became confused.",

The greedy and foolish often ruin their families. Compared to the Daoists mentioned earlier, their karmic offenses are multiplied manyfold.\n\nI dare not speak further, lest I invite slander.\n\nBut those who have received the precepts must now heed my words on the proper way to seek a master and inquire into the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "The Master’s disciples asked many times about benevolence, yet the Master’s answers differed each time—rightly so. One may have unwavering faith, another may listen by chance; the faithful may be taught, the casual listener may not.

If one loudly recites the teachings, revealing the profound mechanism, those with intent may receive and remember—but those with intent yet no karmic affinity will hear it as the wind passing by, taking it as nothing.\n\nDisciples, when Śākyamuni Buddha held up a flower before the assembly and said, *\"I possess the wondrous luminous true nature, the sublime mind of nirvana, the treasury of the true Dharma-eye—can any of you perceive it?\"* Only Mahākāśyapa broke into a subtle smile.\n\nDisciples, Mahākāśyapa and Śākyamuni—openly they built plank roads, secretly they crossed the hidden pass. Before the great assembly, they transmitted the secret Dao mind-to-mind, mouth-to-mouth. Yet none among those disciples knew what was being passed or received.\n\nLikewise, when the great sage Confucius spoke before his many disciples, he turned to Zengzi and said, *\"Shen, my Way is bound together by one thread.\"* Zengzi replied, *\"Yes.\"* Though many disciples were present, did not the sage transmit the Dao before them all, while Zengzi alone grasped it among them? The others, not recognizing their own minds, met yet did not meet—what was transmitted, what was received, they knew not. But Zengzi, deeply attuned to his own nature, naturally aligned with the sage’s mind.\n\nLong ago, the Yellow Emperor journeyed to Mount Kongtong to seek the Dao from Guangchengzi. Thrice he entreated, yet Guangchengzi did not respond. The Emperor withdrew and purified himself, dwelling in seclusion for three months. He returned, humbly taking the lower position, advancing on his knees, and with reverent deference asked for the essentials of the supreme Dao. Only then did Guangchengzi reply:\n\n*\"The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure;\nits ultimate state is dim and silent.\nSee nothing, hear nothing—embrace the spirit in stillness,\nand the body will right itself.\nBe still, be pure; do not weary your form,\ndo not let your thoughts and cares run wild—\nthen you may attain long life.\nGuard your externals, close your internals;\ntoo much cleverness leads to ruin.\nI preserve the One and abide in harmony—\nthus have I lived twelve hundred years without aging.\"*\n\nThese few straightforward words he spoke directly to the Yellow Emperor—then fell silent.

Who can sweep clean their ears to reverently hear the wondrous teachings of the sacred texts, or open wide their eyes to transcend and awaken to the great Dao beyond words? Without awakening, the heart remains unillumined; even if you encounter a sagely teacher, you will not recognize them.\n\nDisciples, before seeking a teacher, first seek yourself. Before inquiring of the Dao, first inquire of your own heart. If you do not follow the precepts in practice, it will be most difficult to find a teacher who confirms your Dao. The key to this lies in your humility and self-effacement: first carve away all pride and arrogance, soften and yield in compliance. Cut away every thought of slander and jealousy. When meeting others, never boast of your own abilities—fear only that someone may equal you. If you happen upon a clear-eyed master or a lofty-minded adept, and their single phrase or half-sentence severs you at the waist, how will you break free? Naturally, like snow melting to reveal the corpse beneath, you cannot escape the discerning eye.\n\nNow I earnestly advise you all: seeking a teacher and inquiring of the Dao is no trifling matter. It is not enough to kneel and kowtow a few times before a teacher, or to hear them call you \"disciple\" a few times. Today, those who take the precepts lightly and disrespect the Dao are everywhere. Disciples, you must swiftly turn inward and reflect, repenting before the successive patriarchs of old for your past arrogance and contempt, transforming your old habits, and revering the Dharma-treasures.

      "translated_text": "Hold fast to the tenfold balance of concentration and wisdom, O assembly. Those who have received the First Real Precepts must advance to the Middle Ultimate, first fulfilling the subtle and wondrous practices of the First Real Ten Precepts in secret and meticulous observance before proceeding to receive the Middle Ultimate’s Three Hundred Great Precepts.\n\nO assembly, what distinguishes the Middle Ultimate Precepts from the First Real Precepts? One precept restrains all; one truth encompasses all truth.\n\nWhy, after the First Real, comes the Middle Ultimate, and after the Middle Ultimate, the Heavenly Immortal Precepts—why this sequence of progression? O assembly, this principle is clear and plain to see. Let me draw it from the empty sky to tell you.\n\nGreat assembly, the First Real Ten Precepts you have received are meant to restrain your physical form, to ride the wind and break the waves, forbidding reckless action and erratic behavior. The Middle Ultimate’s Three Hundred Great Precepts are meant to subdue your stubborn mind, forbidding wild thoughts and scattered intentions. The Heavenly Immortal Wondrous Precepts are meant to liberate your true intent, forbidding attachment and entanglement.\n\nO assembly, the First Real Ten Precepts are coarse; the Middle Ultimate Three Hundred are refined. The First Real Precepts govern the outer six senses; the Middle Ultimate Precepts sweep clean the inner six dusts; the Heavenly Immortal Wondrous Precepts dissolve the three bodies, extinguish the eight consciousnesses, and render the nine demons and ten trials powerless to invade.\n\nO assembly, the First Real Precepts arise because you have awakened to past wrongs, deeply repented former transgressions, and reflected that life in this world is fleeting, impermanent in birth and death. Having left the household life to become a Daoist, you are called a Perfected in Wholeness. Consider carefully: from the day you left home until now, when have you ever truly perfected anything? Year after year, you have idly passed the days, aging no differently than the common folk. From dawn to dusk, you wade through rivers and climb mountains, rushing south and north. Though you may have paid homage to several famous peaks, seeing more stones and trees than the common folk, in the end, you suffer the same hardships as merchants and travelers, buying and selling. Eating wind and lodging in water—what purpose does it serve? When have you ever encountered immortals? Those who transmit oral instructions are but common folk, worldly in eye and mortal in nature, reciting alchemical classics by rote, clinging stubbornly to trivial details—swallowing stones that cannot be digested, tasting nothing of their essence. Thus, you differ not at all from the common folk; how can you transcend the world and rise above the mundane?\n\nToday, having received the First Real Precepts, this heart that knows its faults still retains its original face. Why not transform your habitual false heart into a true heart, your habitual false intentions into true intentions, your habitual false visage into a true visage? Reveal your true heart and extend your repentance. From this day of receiving the precepts, you are called a disciple of the First Real. These First Real Precepts govern the four great dignified postures, adorn the physical form, yet remain unrelated to the Dharma-body and untouched by concentration and wisdom. Knowing your restlessness, I have imposed the Ten Precepts to restrain your body. If you can uphold these precepts in practice, your body will settle into stillness and concentration, allowing you to advance to the Middle Ultimate Precepts.\n\nO assembly, the Middle Ultimate Precepts pertain to concentration, differing from the First Real Precepts. The First Real is governed by the word *precept*; the Middle Ultimate by the word *concentration*; the Heavenly Immortal Precepts by the word *wisdom*. When the Heavenly Worthy took pity on sentient beings, he established these precepts of concentration and wisdom to subdue the workings of body, mind, and intent—this is the very art of transcending the world and rising above the mundane, the wondrous treasure of the Golden Elixir. Beyond these precepts of concentration and wisdom, there is no other method. Though there are eighty-four thousand external dharmas, none can escape these two words: *concentration* and *wisdom*. Whether you consume divine elixirs, refine the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, ascend to heaven in broad daylight, lift your dwelling to soar aloft, perform miraculous transformations, dissolve your corpse in emptiness, die standing or sitting, or seize another’s body—no matter how many immortal arts you master, the radiance of concentration and wisdom remains steadfast and unmoved. It illuminates all these divine powers and arts as a bright mirror in the courtyard reveals every coming and going, each form reflected within it. Thus, they remain within concentration and wisdom, never beyond their bounds.\n\nO assembly, the *Middle* in Middle Ultimate is the Celestial Pivot of the Dipper Mother, the unshakable center; the *Ultimate* is the Southern Ultimate governing birth and the Northern Ultimate governing death—the great mechanism of life and death, wholly dependent on the Dipper’s handle silently turning the numinous pivot. The Middle Ultimate wields the authority of heaven and earth, grasps the handle of life and death. This *Middle* is neither inside nor outside, neither left nor right, neither before nor behind, neither biased nor partial, neither excessive nor deficient—the *Middle* of \"holding fast to the center to attain harmony,\" the *Middle* of \"when words multiply and numbers fail, it is better to abide in the center,\" the *Middle* of \"the noble person walks the central path,\" the *Middle* of \"standing in the center without leaning.\" The Mystic Pearl, the Mustard Seed, the Pearl of the Buddha, the Great Ultimate of the Golden Elixir—many are its borrowed names and alternate titles, yet in truth, it does not transcend this wondrous, luminous, and unobscured true nature.\n\nO assembly, what is the equal holding of concentration and wisdom? O assembly, this single spark of numinous awareness has been entangled since beginningless time by the three karmic actions you have performed, stained by the six dusts, deluded by the seven emotions, assailed by the six desires, scorched by the three poisons, and overpowered by the ten demons. It has stolen your numinous awareness, leaving you neither daring to die nor daring to live. You cannot observe the Dao of heaven nor grasp the conduct of heaven.\n\nO assembly, this spark of numinous awareness is a Dharma-treasure; it should be turned against the current, not allowed to flow with it.",

      "translated_text": "Flowing with the current, one drifts with external things, stirred by circumstances, summoning demons and gathering monstrosities, inviting harm and courting calamity, entering and exiting the cycle of rebirth, traversing the four modes of birth and six paths of existence, adrift and submerged in suffering. Those who have received the Middle Ultimate Precepts must instead flow against the current. Flowing against it, one does not turn with any thing nor with any circumstance; demons, monsters, disasters, and calamities dare not encroach; the cycle of rebirth may be escaped, and the drifting may be transcended.\n\nNow, I ask you: what is called flowing with the current? In the ways of the world, it is bearing sons and raising daughters, taking wives and purchasing concubines, fathering children and begetting grandchildren, pursuing fame and fortune, expanding households and amassing property, buying fields and acquiring land, donning fine silks and wearing embroidered brocades, indulging in lust and desire, killing living beings and harming lives, filling one’s mouth with delicacies and one’s belly with feasts—all of this merely gratifies the physical form. Yet this physical form is but earth, water, fire, and wind, a temporary vessel of skin and flesh, formed when father’s essence and mother’s blood unite in lustful congress, when essence and qi interact, blood congeals into a mass, and consciousness invests it with spirit, settling the fetus and establishing life. All arises from the illusory transformation of the two qi, and in the end, it is impermanent, ultimately returning to dust. Only these two matters—merit and transgression—do not concern the physical form; rather, it is the Dharma-body that suffers.\n\nAlas! O assembly, those among you who do not believe this claim that the Dharma-body originally resides within the physical form, and that when the physical form dies, the Dharma-body is already empty. When a person dies, their numinous qi disperses and returns to emptiness—where then is there talk of heaven and hell, hungry ghosts and beasts, or the Dharma-body receiving retribution?\n\nNow, I ask you this: when a person dies and their qi disperses into emptiness, why do their descendants set out offerings during the four seasons and eight festivals? If you say that after death, this stream of numinous qi is not taken by the courts of the underworld for judgment, and that the good and evil, kindness and malice, debts owed, schemes hatched, killings, thefts, and all manner of karmic entanglements of one’s former life are not accounted for—then this stream of numinous qi would not come to partake of the sacrifices offered by descendants in the world. If it does not come to partake of worldly sacrifices, then the ancient *Rites of Zhou* and other such texts should not have falsely expounded so many sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies. The great sage Confucius should not have said, *\"Serve the dead as if they were living; serve the departed as if they were present,\"* nor *\"Sacrifice as if they are present; sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits are present.\"* Nor should he have spoken of *\"solemnly purifying oneself and donning fine robes to receive the sacrifices, as if the spirits were above, as if they were at one’s side,\"* or the *Book of Songs*’ lines: *\"The spirits’ arrival is unfathomable, immeasurable—King Wen is above, radiant in the heavens.\"* O assembly, since these sayings of *\"as if they were above\"* and *\"King Wen is above\"* have been passed down, then our hearts have already stored the sincerity of ghosts and spirits drawing near. If our hearts have already stored the sincerity of ghosts and spirits drawing near, then the great sages of old—Zhou Gong and Confucius—must have deeply understood the conditions of ghosts and spirits before establishing these sacrificial texts, vessels, rites, and ceremonies to instruct countless generations for all time. How could the sages have spoken deceptive words or fabricated strange tales?\n\nMoreover, consider those scholar-officials who are posthumously granted titles and ranks: if the stream of numinous qi after death scatters and becomes insensate, then the honors of posthumous enfeoffment would be excessive. Who would enjoy the golden seals and purple patents, or the favor of ascending to heaven? If receiving blessings implies the existence of ghosts and spirits, but suffering punishment implies their absence, then it is the human heart that lacks clarity, and the numinous awareness that remains unenlightened.\n\nThere are those cunning, murderous fools who know only to indulge in wine and lust, bewildered by wealth and qi, never having examined the karmic roots of what comes after death, recognizing only the blood and qi of the present moment. They stubbornly recite a few lines of poetry: *\"Do not ponder the endless matters after death; just drain this cup of wine in life.\"* They never recite those other two lines: *\"When the body perishes, nothing of the myriad things will go with it; in the dark realm, only karma follows the self.\"*\n\nO assembly, karma has three kinds.\n\nThe first is unwholesome karma—all entangling branches and leaves, unbroken and unending, unresolved and unexhausted, with causes and effects, effects and retributions. Those who do not believe in ghosts and spirits, do not revere heaven and earth, do not fear the king’s law, are disloyal to the sovereign, unfilial to parents, corrupt the Three Bonds, ruin the Five Constants, slander sages and worthies, kill, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, act cruelly and viciously, behave recklessly and falsely—after such a life ends, they fall into hell, transmigrating through its prisons, enduring boundless suffering. Later, reborn in the world of the living, they take the form of beasts. After the beastly retribution is complete, they return as humans, but with incomplete faculties, dull-witted and benighted, unaware of human affairs, despised and loathed by all, their bodies degraded and forced into servitude. They become beggars, their bodies covered in festering sores, infested with lice and filth, their clothes unable to cover them, their food unable to fill their mouths, suffering hunger and cold without recourse, enduring a thousand pains. They die in the wilderness, devoured by ants and dragged away by dogs. Their solitary souls, adrift and forlorn, sink once more into hell.\n\nThe second is wholesome karma—those who are intelligent and upright, incorruptible and impartial, bringing joy to the six relations and peace to their villages, revering parents, honoring the divine, respecting heaven and earth, esteeming the sovereign, venerating teachers and elders, cherishing friends, cultivating themselves and transforming desires, not being greedy with wealth, not lusting after beauty, not disrupting the Five Constants, and conducting all affairs with care. Even those who dwell in mountains as bhikṣus or in caves as old Daoists, content with frugality, enduring humiliation, their concentration yet unsteady and their Dao-practice incomplete—after their lives end, they are reborn as humans, becoming high officials or esteemed teachers, or enjoying ready-made wealth and honor, or attaining both fortune and longevity, living in ease and splendor, their lives filled with joy.",

It has stolen your numinous awareness, leaving you neither daring to die nor daring to live. You cannot observe the Dao of heaven nor grasp the conduct of heaven.\n\nO assembly, this spark of numinous awareness is a Dharma-treasure; it should be turned against the current, not allowed to flow with it.",

      "translated_text": "The third karma is the pure karma, with aspirations set upon the sage and the worthy, yearnings reaching toward immortals and buddhas. The mind abides in good thoughts, the mouth speaks good words, and the body performs good deeds. One associates with good people, treads upon good earth, and holds good things in hand. Solemn and dignified, the body does not move recklessly, the mind does not wander idly. One strives for clarity of mind, strives for stillness of mind. With long and deep cultivation, the original spirit settles in tranquility, ever dwelling within the Crimson Chamber, within the Yellow Court, in the Golden Portal and Jade Hall. All entanglements suddenly cease, all thoughts become empty. Only the true spirit is seen—form forgotten, things forgotten, realms forgotten, mechanisms forgotten. This is called *ding* (meditative absorption), and it is no small matter. It is the luminous and undimmed realm of the Three Purities, transcending the thirty-six heavens above and penetrating the seventy-two earths below, roaming beyond the Three Realms, revolving within the Five Phases.\n\nWithin this state of *ding*, all is dim and obscure, silent and still. Heaven and earth revolve and return to primordial chaos, merging into a single *qi*. Above, it is not heaven; below, it is not earth; in the center, it is not human. It cannot be spoken, cannot be described, cannot be conceived. Suddenly, a divine radiance bursts forth, and a wheel of wisdom-nature wells up. The clear is divided into heaven, the turbid into earth, and the harmonious *qi* within the principle becomes the Dharma-body. Wisdom pervades the Three Realms, illuminating the Great Mystery. No thing can escape its traces, no affair is unknown in its coming and going. There is not the slightest hindrance, not the thinnest obstruction, not a speck of dust or filth.\n\nAll heavenly dragons, ghosts, spirits, demons, and monsters submit in reverence. Yama, upon seeing it, dare not raise his voice; Ox-Head and Night-Rakshasa bow in submission with clenched fists. The ledger of life holds no name, the register of death bears no surname. One may attain longevity in the world. Expounding the Dharma to liberate beings, one may ascend in spirit and attain transformation. Ultimately, one enters the realm of pure emptiness, ascends to pay homage to the Beginningless, and forever escapes the cycle of rebirth.\n\nAll of you, the pivotal celestial mechanism for crossing over lies solely in the movement and stillness of the true mind. Profound stillness is called the power of *ding*; true *ding* is named the radiance of wisdom. If the deluded mind is not first put to death, how can one settle the spirit and stabilize the *qi*? If one cannot abide in constant purity and stillness, how can one enter *ding*? If one cannot enter *ding*, how can one attain wisdom?\n\nAll of you, when the mind is empty, the spirit is settled; when the spirit is settled, radiance is born. If there is *ding* without wisdom, it is called the yin-spirit overcoming the yang-spirit. One must give rise to wisdom within *ding*. Wisdom is the Dharma-body; *ding* is the Buddha-nature.\n\nAll of you, *ding* is the home, precepts are the path, wisdom is the life-giving force. The myriad things, myriad realms, and myriad affairs of the world are all guests. If *ding* and wisdom mutually give rise to one another, entering the gate of manifold subtleties, then the spiritual power and wisdom of the true master are fully nurtured, and radiant light manifests. One can respond to the myriad things and myriad affairs without being bound by them; one can transform the myriad realms of the world without being deluded by them; one can transcend the cycles of yin and yang, life and death.\n\nAll of you, first you must understand the two paths of sin and blessing, the law of cause and effect, and retribution. Follow the precepts and practice them one by one, not daring to deviate in the slightest. After long and deep contemplation, clarity and understanding will naturally arise. Only then should one enter stillness and engage in meditative observation. Within *ding*, the original nature becomes perfectly luminous, the radiance of wisdom shines brightly, and the spirit and *qi* suddenly awaken. Then, mountains, rivers, and the great earth do not extend beyond one’s body; the life and death of the myriad things do not extend beyond a single thought. From the numinous clarity of the true master, one holds the handle that prevents entry into the cycle of rebirth.\n\nThis work of the \"center\" cannot be substituted by father or son, nor can it be known by gods or ghosts. Each of you must personally attend to it and practice it.\n\nAll of you, I have erected the ladder to heaven—who among you will ascend it? I have pushed off the raft of the Dao—who will board it?",

      "translated_text": "Amidst summer damp and winter chill, the six pulses of yin and yang fall into discord; through ceaseless pursuit and relentless chase, the three souls scatter and drift away. A hundred ailments assail, bringing the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and pain; a thousand calamities cling fast, from toil and weariness to transgressions and faults. Though ginseng and poria are consumed, no cure is found; though heaven and earth are invoked, no response comes. A thousand pains and sorrows cannot be fully told—until, in a single breath, the qi severs, and one descends to the courts of the dead.\n\nOnce so dignified in appearance, no sooner has the breath ceased than others cover their noses; once so imposing in presence, the moment the eyes close, the face turns upward. The four limbs are gathered into the coffin’s wood, the likeness preserved only on paper. Children do not take one’s place in death, nor do wives and concubines follow. Before the corpse has grown cold, the living have already turned their thoughts elsewhere. Brothers squabble over wealth and property, while wives and concubines hide treasures and fine garments. Those with sons begin scheming for the days ahead; those without devise plans to remarry. At the gate, the carriages of guests grow sparse—so the saying goes, *\"When a man lives, his favors live with him.\"* Within the household, servants begin to steal, for as the proverb warns, *\"When power wanes, even slaves will deceive.\"* Who tends to the crumbling walls and gates? Who notices the family’s decline? Wives turn to wantonness, children prove unfilial—each looks only to their own future.\n\nWhen has the dead ever returned to life? Who has departed and then come back? Born with empty fists, one departs with bare hands. The physical form returns to earth, the name dissolves into emptiness. Along two paths—good and evil—retribution is meted out with perfect clarity.\n\nPeople, behold these illusory forms of the physical world—are they not false? Yet if they are false, then this single spark of true spirit, which seeks to build a household, pursue high rank, acquire wives and concubines, cherish children and grandchildren, and enjoy wealth and honor, is most certainly not false. Observe, then: where does this true spirit go? Clearly, it departs to the netherworld. And once there, can it still cling to wives, concubines, beloved children, wealth, honor, and glory?\n\nPeople, the two causes of good and evil, the two retributions of sin and blessing, the two fruits of suffering and joy—these follow as surely as a shadow clings to form. Can the physical body escape even the slightest bit of suffering or punishment? Therefore, you must regard the physical form as light and the Dharma-body as weighty, using the false to cultivate the true, preserving the true and discarding the false, so as to escape the sea of suffering. Yet without this physical form, there would be no means of cultivation, and the solitary spirit of the Dharma-body, unable to govern itself, would be cast into the six paths of rebirth—then the effort would be in vain.\n\nSince we have attained human form and entered the gate of the Dao, we must seek liberation from the cycle of rebirth while the light in our eyes has not yet faded. How, then, is this cultivation to be pursued? People, you must sweep clean the six sense gates and their dust, harmonize the five viscera and their qi, and keep the master ever abiding in the luminous terrace, so that demonic thieves cannot invade. Perform many good deeds, and eradicate the roots of sin.\n\nYet within this method of cultivating the true, there are two paths—each with its true and false, its active and passive. The *Diamond Sutra* says, *\"All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and like lightning.\"* The *Classic of Purity* states, *\"Living beings fail to attain the true Dao because of their deluded minds.\"* From these scriptures, we know that within the cultivation of the true, the path of conditioned dharmas is not the right one.\n\nAlas, there is a school that manipulates essence and moves qi, seeks to extend life and replenish vitality, reverse aging and restore youth, achieve immortality and escape death—all while clinging to form in their practice. Others ascend lead and descend mercury, forge cauldrons and burn thatch, ingest elixirs, swallow talismans, and consume qi. These are all attempts to use the false to cultivate the true, mere conditioned methods—how can they lead to seeing the nature, establishing the mandate, and escaping the cycle of rebirth? To transcend birth and death, one cannot emerge in such a way.\n\nPeople, in using the false to cultivate the true, you must thoroughly investigate the great matter of life and death and truly comprehend the authentic path of the Dao. Where does this path lie? It lies solely in the turning of your own mind—whether it follows or resists. If it follows, it is at the mercy of others; if it resists, it is governed by the self.\n\nThis physical form—whether cultivated or not—will still die. Even if one lives a thousand years, in the end, it returns to earth. Why, then, does it come? People, where there is form, there is decay; where there is beginning, there is end; where there is creation, there is transformation; where there is gathering, there is scattering; where there is coming, there is going; where there is success, there is failure; where there is youth, there is old age. Since this body is born, it must inevitably die.\n\nThe method of transcending birth and death that I speak of does not concern itself with this body. It merely borrows it as a dwelling place to cultivate the heavenly mandate of the Dharma-body. Those of external paths, failing to grasp this principle, take it as real, cling to form, and seek to make this flesh-and-blood body imperishable and deathless—is this not laughable?\n\nThe method of transcending birth and death that I speak of lies solely within the true mind of this body, in the thoughts that arise and the deeds that are done. When deluded thoughts do not stir, the Dharma-body is born; when the Dharma-body is still, the heavenly mechanism moves; when the heavenly mechanism moves, the true light appears. It is only because this true light is not yet complete that we borrow this physical form to perform good deeds. Yet even good deeds have their true and false: clinging to form makes them false, while non-attachment makes them true.\n\nBehold the Tathāgata: He gives without attachment to giving, accumulates merit without attachment to merit, expounds the Dharma without attachment to expounding, cultivates the Dao without attachment to cultivation, and emerges into the world without attachment to emergence. Because He is unattached, He can emerge into the world; because He can emerge into the world, He can transcend birth and death.\n\nThe *Classic of Purity* says, *\"The highest virtue does not act as virtue.\"* This is non-attachment—is this not liberation? How, then, can one escape birth and death?",

      "translated_text": "Merely living a few more years only earns some karmic rewards. When those rewards are exhausted, one still cannot transcend the cycle of rebirth. Disciples, I urge you to follow the words of the Most High—there is no error in them: *\"Set the body aside, and the body endures; place the self last, and the self leads.\"* Only then can one die yet not perish.\n\nDisciples, set your bodies aside and do not cling to the cultivation of essence and qi, coveting the ascent and descent of vital energy, the unblocking of orifices, the circulation of blood and meridians, the prolongation of life, or the prevention of illness. Attached to such practices, you instead fixate on the solidity of the physical form, seeking fleeting pleasure and carefree ease, while neglecting your true nature year after year, day after day. Yet one day, when the lesser spirits catch you unawares, they will suddenly seize you. Where then will your Dharma-body drift with the waves? Your physical form will be consigned to the muddy pit, and in the end, all will be emptiness.\n\nI implore you, disciples, to diligently practice the work of humbling the mind and enduring with patience, so that you may early awaken to your true nature. How then could you worry that your life will not be established? Disciples, I remind you: the physical body is but a house, and the Dharma-body is its master. If the master possesses treasure, how could the house not be well-ordered? But if the master falls ill, or invites misfortune, or incurs calamity, or is taken away, who then will dwell in that well-ordered house?\n\nLet me raise the matter one level higher to awaken you: the physical body is a rented house, not one you own. When the master departs, it returns to dust, and the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—are each restored to their source. If you can silently cultivate an unattached true Dharma-body, how could the physical form not find a good place to rest?\n\nDisciples, I have a few clumsy verses—listen as I recite:\n\nThe physical form is but the Dharma-body’s house;\nWhen the inner is bright, the outer naturally shines.\nIf only the master cultivates blessings and wisdom,\nHow could the house fail to radiate splendor?\n\nTo preserve the true, first dispel the false;\nThe true Dharma must discard the false and illusory.\nDo not boast, do not cling to form—\nDual cultivation of nature and life transcends impermanence.\n\nOnly by quieting the mind and seeking liberation\nCan the illusory body be set down, revealing the true self.\nClinging to life and fearing death, you will still die;\nAttached to form in cultivation, how can you attain the real?\n\nThe Tathāgata severed body and limbs,\nThe Jade Emperor once endured humiliation.\nForgetting the body, he perished through three thousand kalpas;\nAbandoning the kingdom, he retreated to the mountains for eight hundred years.\n\nYet the Daoist, clinging to this skin-bag of falsity,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives, never escapes the dust.\nCease your striving, spare your spirit—\nAll that has form must ultimately return to yin.\n\nIf you lose the true Suchness of your nature,\nIn the boundless sea of suffering, where will you seek it?\nAlas! Pity those who,\nWithin the false, cling to layer upon layer of falsity,\nStudying the Complete Truth in vain—how can they attain the real?\n\nThe sorrows of birth, aging, sickness, and the fear of death—\nIn death, how are you different from ordinary people?\nWearing the yellow cap and feathered robes in vain,\nNever having grasped the mechanism of life and death,\nYou wander the ends of the earth in search of clothing and food,\nOnly for karmic retribution to overtake you, turning you to mud.\n\nIf you do not understand that sin and blessing are fundamentally empty,\nThe cycle of birth and death will never cease.\nIf you have not awakened to the fact that the false and true reside within you,\nWho will reveal the light of wisdom?\n\nDisciples, each of you must reflect: impermanence comes swiftly. The esoteric practices I speak of number three hundred, comprising the Three Hundred Subtle Precepts of the Supreme Ultimate. Through them, cultivating the body refines its posture; cultivating the mind dissolves deluded thoughts. Applied inwardly, they make one a sage; applied outwardly, they make one a sovereign. They enable transcendence of the worldly and ascension to the fruit of pure emptiness, allowing one to deliver others from suffering and end the cycle of birth and death.\n\nThe most crucial element is secrecy. Without secrecy, one cannot preserve the true; without preserving the true, the mind remains unclear; and if the mind is unclear, the true nature cannot be seen. Disciples, what does \"secrecy\" mean? The sages used it to purify the mind and retreat into concealment. Secrecy is the utmost vigilance. Utmost precision is hidden in obscurity—this is the pinnacle of secrecy.\n\nDisciples, all who wish to receive the Supreme Ultimate Precepts must first take the first to the hundredth precept as the great divine mantra for purifying the body. By observing this mantra with care, you must entirely dispel the body’s restlessness, transforming it into stillness. All frivolity must depart, replaced by steadiness. In the four great deportments—walking, sitting, standing, and lying—you must walk the middle path, sit without leaning to one side, stand upright without leaning on walls or pillars, or propping yourself on tables. When lying down, curl the body to the side; do not sleep flat on your back with loud snoring. Even the slightest sound from the breath must be regulated, cultivating an appearance of reverence and propriety—this is called \"external adornment.\"\n\nThe hundredth to the two hundredth precept form the great divine mantra for purifying the mind. By contemplating this mantra in accord with the Dao, you must delve deeply and awaken secretly, ensuring every thought returns to the true, every action aligns with the Dao, and not a single word is neglected. Investigate again and again, awaken again and again. Observe things from afar, then examine them closely within yourself, eradicating all wayward and perverse thoughts. Only when the true mind is firmly settled can you proceed.\n\nThe two hundredth to the three hundredth precept form the great divine mantra for purifying the intent. Not a single thread must be leaked. Within them lie the subtle mechanisms of ebb and flow, the principles of interaction, hidden in the mysterious capital’s treasury—subtle, wondrous, beyond thought and description, beyond form and image. They can be spiritually realized but not spoken of, encompassing the supreme, most honored, non-actional, wondrous Dao.\n\nDisciples, this is the esoteric practice of cultivating the true. Hear now one final word and remember it well: the supreme Dao abhors disclosure. Disciples, is the cultivation of the true and the liberation from birth and death a trivial matter?",

      "translated_text": "If the celestial mechanisms are not kept secret, they will be leaked to the unworthy. Thus, when Master Zhang Ziyang of the Purple Sun transmitted the teachings to the unfit, he thrice incurred heavenly punishment—hence, they must not be disclosed. How much more so for those who seek to transcend the wheel of rebirth, leap beyond the world, and become true beings unharmed through ten thousand kalpas? Would this not incur the envy of heaven and earth, the wrath of ghosts and spirits, the resentment of yin and yang, and the fury of creation? Moreover, this reversal of the natural course, this inversion of worldly ways, sets you at odds with the mundane like fire and ice. You must proceed with utmost caution and secrecy, lest your six relations turn against you, your nine clans become enemies, your wife and children grow cold, and your friends lose faith—all because you failed to rouse a mighty resolve, thus fostering a heart that retreats from the Way.\n\n**The Twelve Acts of Repaying Kindness and Dispelling Calamities**\n\nDisciples, since you have left the household life to seek liberation from the world, you must repent and eradicate the karmic debts of a thousand past lives and the deep-seated grievances of countless generations, ensuring they vanish from this moment onward and never arise again. Only then can you clear the suffering of karmic retribution. Yet this remains the work of the lesser vehicle, the deeds of those who flee from karmic debts, cowards who cling to life and fear death—petty-minded, incompetent, inferior beings. Such persons have not illuminated their hearts, nor awakened their innate nature. They live only for the present, heedless of future lives. Now, let me recount an example of such externalists for all to hear and understand.\n\nThere was once a Daoist who left the household life midway through his journey. He wandered in search of truth and encountered several companions, with whom he made a vow to build a hermitage on Laoshan in Shandong and cultivate there. Later, due to war, they descended the mountain together and settled in the foothills of Wangwushan in Henan, living alone in meditation. Though six of them dwelt in the same place, their aspirations and practices differed. After a year, three departed, leaving only three who renewed their vows to seek liberation from the world.\n\nLater, one of the three entered *samadhi* and passed away. The remaining two grew even more resolute. Then another entered *samadhi* and departed, leaving only one to cultivate in solitude. During meditation, his spirit wandered to Tiantaishan, where he unexpectedly encountered the companion who had passed later. Overjoyed, the latter said, \"I have met you by karmic affinity and must tell you this: you should revise the vow you made years ago. When I first vowed to cultivate, I sought to repent of karmic grievances to attain liberation. Yet when my allotted time in the world ended, I arrived at the outer gates of the Three Heavens, where the Bureau of Karmic Review proclaimed loudly: *'This one’s karmic roots remain; their fate is inescapable. Their name is not on the celestial register, nor do they have a place on the Cinnabar Terrace. They may not proceed further and must instead go to Yuntaishan to receive an appointment at the Three Primordials’ Assembly Hall.'* Immediately, a mighty wind and vast *qi* obscured the heavenly gates, and I found myself at the Three Primordials’ Hall.\n\nThere, the Three Officials examined the ledger and said: *'You, with your lesser aspirations and heterodox practices, deludedly sought liberation. Out of compassion for your ignorance, we appoint you provisionally as the mountain spirit of Tongbo Palace on Tiantai, to await a vacancy in the underworld before confirming your post.'* I pleaded for further instruction to cultivate in secret, and the Three Officials, their faces kind, replied: *'When you sat in meditation, your thoughts were not pure, your mind not empty. You failed to see through the emptiness of the physical form and the reality of the innate nature, nor did you awaken to the non-emptiness within emptiness. You merely sought to repent of the grievances of a thousand lives and erase the enmities of countless generations, believing that after leaving the household life, karmic debts and sins would no longer arise. Yet you never deeply investigated or fully awakened to how grievances are eradicated and enmities repented within the innate nature. How could the karmic grievances accumulated over eons and the enmities forged across lifetimes be swept away by mere words or thoughts? You must enter the gate with resolve, study the supreme vehicle, and cultivate the great root and great capacity with a heart of universal salvation.\n\nThe great capacity of the supreme vehicle instantly extinguishes the mundane mind, rendering heaven and earth empty and illusory forms like ashes. Yet even then, deep-seated karmic grievances may remain unresolved. How can debts of wealth and life be taken lightly? Thus, the ancient Buddha King Ariya severed his own limbs to repay past debts, leaving no trace behind, and only then attained the realization of Sakyamuni. The Sixth Patriarch washed away deep-seated grievances, bearing even the slightest karmic burden, and only then attained the great mirror of the Western Heaven.\n\nNow, your aspirations are small, your roots inferior. You refuse to repay karmic debts, seeking only to escape suffering. You cling too tightly to the physical form, fearing the arrival of karmic adversaries, dreading punishment, beatings, death, and pain, desiring only the fleeting comfort of the body. This fear of repayment is the mark of an inferior root, placing you in the lesser vehicle. If the roots of grievance are not emptied, they will resurface in future kalpas. With karmic causes still present, you will encounter them again in future lives. Though you call this 'leaving the household life,' it is merely fleeing from suffering. Unable to escape it, you remain entangled across kalpas, bound through generations—all because your initial vow was weak and your aspirations narrow. In this life, leaving the household life earns you only the name of 'cultivating blessings,' not 'cultivating the Dao.' You were fated to reenter the wheel of rebirth and be reborn with great fortune. Yet because you once recited the sacred scriptures of the Supreme Emperor a hundred times and chanted the sacred name of Maitreya for three years with sincere devotion, you were appointed to the rank of Orthodox Unity Perfected One. Since you performed rituals for patrons without error and distributed all the wealth you received, you are deemed worthy of promotion—thus, this additional rank.'\"",

      "translated_text": "This Daoist, having swept clean his six senses, dissolved his eight consciousnesses, emptied his five aggregates, and severed his seven emotions, was now poised for final refuge in the Ever-Clear, Ever-Tranquil Great Heavenly Worthy. Yet, bound by the qi allotment of his mortal form—bestowed by parents, nurtured by heaven and earth—his destined lifespan had reached its end. The next day, he descended the mountain to bid farewell to his external protectors and fellow disciples: *\"I must now take leave of you all and return to the source.\"* The assembly asked, *\"Why must you depart so hastily?\"* The Daoist replied, *\"I have repaid my three karmic debts, yet four great debts remain unfulfilled. Thus, I must be reborn to settle this one last resolve.\"* With these words, he clasped his hands, turned toward the void, and bowed in reverence—then, in perfect stillness, he departed.\n\nDisciples, heed this: the path may be straight or crooked, the vows great or small. These three individuals, when viewed by the fruit of their return, reveal ranks of vastly differing magnitude. Disciples, those with great aspiration become great beings; those with small aspiration remain small. For without great aspiration, the heart cannot expand; without an expansive heart, the capacity cannot widen. Narrow vows and constricted capacity breed shallow knowledge and cramped vision, and the qi thus cultivated cannot become vast. If qi is not vast, it merely fills the illusory sack of skin—unable to pervade the Great Void, to stand between heaven and earth, to penetrate sun and moon, or to permeate the ten thousand beings. How then can this be called the Great and Ultimate Dao?\n\nDisciples, we are born between heaven and earth, illumined by sun and moon, nurtured by parents, and guided by sovereign and teacher—these are the Four Great Debts, boundless and profound, impossible to fully repay. Yet we still fall back into the suffering of the colored body, the calamities of the five aggregates, still unable to transcend. Even with dual cultivation of merit and wisdom, we struggle to attain lasting permanence.\n\nDisciples, now that you have taken refuge in the Three Treasures, why have you not yet transcended suffering? Merit and wisdom are but the desires of wealth and honor—ancient sages said: *\"The River of Love surges with thousand-foot waves; the Sea of Desire churns with ten-thousand-layer swells.\"* Only when the waters dry and the waves subside, when the source of inherent nature is perfectly clear, can you awaken. You must realize that all beings—past and present—share this same source. Whether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all possess awareness. Recognizing the unity of self and others is repayment to heaven—endless, boundless compassion, embracing impurity and enduring humiliation. Who among the flying, swimming, moving, and growing does not share this same vital force, sustained and nurtured by it? This is repayment to earth.\n\nWhen the ground of inherent nature is luminous and the sky of inherent nature is radiant, you meet those lost in darkness and guide them with true words, pointing out the path of awakening. You encounter the drowning and deliver them through the Dharma, clearing away obstacles. This is repayment to sun and moon.\n\nDiligently follow your teacher’s instructions, strictly adhere to the laws of the land, and reverently uphold the sovereign’s decrees. Do not overstep your bounds, violate virtue, or deviate from the natural order. Uphold the pure precepts and observe the scriptures; pray for the sovereign’s longevity and the empire’s stability. Transmit these teachings to future generations and propagate the true Dao. This is repayment to sovereign and teacher.\n\nThe body is a gift from parents—do not defile hair or skin. Dissolve the barrier between self and others, repent and liberate the suffering of the departed. For the toil of past parents, dissolve the karmic knots of many lives. For the hardships of present kin, repay their afflictions and atone for their transgressions. Devote this mortal form to unceasing filial piety. Without delivering your parents, you cannot ascend to truth. Honor all parents as you would your own, and cherish all children as you would your own flesh. Thus, the seven generations above will ascend, and the three generations will rise high. This is repayment to parents.\n\nDisciples, if even a thread of obstruction lingers in your heart, how can you perceive the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Three Officials, the Four Saints, the Five Elders, or the Seven Perfected? Now, you constantly divide self and others, habitually give rise to ignorance. Your hearts are narrow—unable to endure even a single matter. Your capacities are shallow—unable to accommodate even one person. You fail to examine origins, misjudge right and wrong. You rejoice in honor and rage at humiliation. Your aspirations lack steadfastness; your thoughts lack clarity. Your hearts hold no magnanimity; your bodies are prone to indolence. You dismiss small faults as insignificant, yet cling to minor virtues as if they were great. How then can you repay heaven, earth, sovereign, teacher, or ancestral kin?\n\nDisciples, to repay the debts to heaven and earth, you must understand the Dao of heaven and earth, embody their heart, comprehend their principles, and realize their virtue. Never deceive in darkness—sever all false passions. Let wisdom’s light shine universally, embracing all impurities. In loss, accept loss without a trace of self; in hardship, endure hardship without a single selfish thought. Cultivate with unwavering effort, and your realm will radiate clarity. With virtue profound and Dao lofty, even ghosts and spirits will revere you. With spirit clear and wisdom manifest, beings will transform and return to the Dao. Above, you may move the throne of the gods; below, you may command thunder and lightning. In drought, pray for rain to nourish the people; in flood, pray for clear skies to dispel disaster. Demons and evil spirits will flee; malevolent forces will vanish. Above, pray for the eternal stability of the empire and the boundless longevity of the sovereign; below, pray for the land’s prosperity and the people’s joy. Only then can you be said to propagate the ancestral teachings and advance the transformative power of the Dao.\n\nMoreover, consider the toil of your parents: ten months of pregnancy, three years of nursing, countless hardships—an immeasurable debt. As you grow, they hope for your support in old age, for your success to bring honor to the family. The sovereign labors day and night, with the Six Ministries and Nine Courts governing, eliminating evil, nurturing the good, suppressing wrongdoing, and promoting virtue. The teacher awakens the deaf and enlightens the blind, establishing the laws of earth in accord with heaven. The Three Bonds rely on this clarity; the Five Constants depend on this understanding. Distinguishing good from evil, discerning human from beast—how shallow is such virtue?",

Your clothing relies on the alms of a thousand households, your food depends on the toil of ten thousand commoners.

Your actions violate every rule; your spirit is dull, your mind scattered. When you ascend the altar to pray for the nation, the gods and spirits do not descend. When you drive out evil and purify pestilence, plagues do not heal. Talismans lose their power, prayers and exorcisms are in vain.\n\nThe base among you, when met with darkness or flood, curse the wind and rail against the rain, resenting heaven and earth. You wander recklessly, act perversely, defy your kin and offend your clan, break the law, and rage at others. Consider the oxen, horses, donkeys, mules, pigs, sheep, dogs, and swine—all possess the five senses, six apertures, yin and yang, male and female, awareness and intelligence.

They sought to transcend the mundane, to awaken to the mechanism of life and death, retreating deep into the mountains, forgetting the self and risking life, all to seek the supreme Dao.\n\nYet, all of you know only the names of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not their true essence. You all wish to become sages, worthies, and buddhas, yet have not truly resolved to do so. You all desire the fruits of sages, worthies, and buddhas, yet do not cultivate their causes. You all aspire to their station, yet fail to generate their vow-power. Thus, you speak of what you cannot practice, for your mouths are clear but your hearts are not.\n\nThe Dao remains obscure because one has not encountered a true master of the Dao. The Dao remains unpracticed because one has not found a true practitioner of the Way. Those called *Daoists*—how many truly grasp the subtleties of the Dao? Those called *Quanzhen* (Complete Realization)—who among them embodies its reality? No wonder the way of filial piety declines and the ancestral Dao withers.\n\nToday, having taken refuge in the Three Jewels and received the precepts, you may be said to have encountered a true master of the Dao. But you must heed my true words and practice the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—only then can you be called a practitioner of the Way.\n\nAll sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas were once ordinary beings like you, no more eyes or hands than you possess. Yet they resolved to seek the method of transcending the world and to understand the mechanism of life and death. This resolve elevated them a hundredfold above the ordinary, vast beyond measure. Though their bodies remained those of ordinary beings, their minds already embodied the sacred.\n\nA sage does not merely speak of transcending the world—they truly hold it in their hearts and act accordingly. Thus, they are called possessors of great heroic power, bearers of great compassion. The great person, the teacher of heaven and humanity—all arise from extraordinary resolve. Their deeds are never small. With thunderous might, the sword of wisdom slung over their shoulder, their brows raised like flashing lightning; with awe-inspiring presence, the blade of precepts at their neck, their eyes blazing like thunder. The hearts of heretics grow cold, and they flee far away; the courage of evil winds falters, and all wish to take refuge.\n\nThey ascend the nine-petaled lotus throne, rising straight to the Dharma King’s seat. Their words resound with purity, heard as the sacred Dharma-sound, pouring ambrosia upon the crowns of all gods and humans. Their bodies emanate the wondrous fragrance of pure qi, seen by all as universal liberation, turning countless multitudes into rivers of ghee and butter.\n\nAfter attaining the Dao, their great resolve fulfilled, they generate vast vows—no notions of self, others, beings, or lifespan. They do not wish to liberate themselves alone but only to liberate others. With the method of self-liberation, they universally liberate all beings, yet do not impose their own path upon others. They take the hearts of the common people as their own.\n\nThe common people are but another name for sentient beings, and sentient beings are of the same kind as oneself. With the method of one’s kind, they save beings of the same kind. Without liberating sentient beings, they do not wish to attain the Dao. As the *Qingjing Jing* states: *“Though called attaining the Dao, there is nothing attained. For the sake of transforming beings, it is called attaining the Dao. Those who awaken to this may transmit the sacred Dao.”*\n\nSages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas are no different from ordinary people. The distinction lies solely in the two words: *public* and *private*. The sage is only impartial and upright, acting for others, not for self. The ordinary person is only biased, deceptive, and selfish, acting for self, not for others.",

      "translated_text": "The sage is only clear, luminous, deep, and still; the ordinary person is but turbid, dark, flighty, and restless. The sage only employs firmness inwardly to master the self and gentleness outwardly to win over others; the ordinary person only uses softness inwardly to indulge the self and hardness outwardly to blame others. The sage constantly fears his own faults; the ordinary person only reproaches the errors of others. The more the sage takes on tasks, the more meticulous his care; the more the ordinary person shoulders perilous affairs, the more careless and reckless he becomes. The sage, though death has not yet come, first discerns the mechanism of what follows death; the ordinary person, though death stands before him, still only schemes for survival. The sage seeks the Dharma beyond the world, refining the heart through worldly Dharma—serving as a child, he fulfills filial piety; serving as a minister, he fulfills loyalty. The ordinary person not only knows nothing of the Dharma beyond the world, but even of worldly Dharma he remains ignorant—how then would he know loyalty to his lord or filial piety to his parents? Pitiable are these deluded, unawakened beings, who neither understand worldly Dharma nor the Dharma beyond the world. Day after day, they live in drunken stupor and dreamlike death, idly born and recklessly dying, born at dawn and dead by dusk, clinging to life and fearing death, blindly living and blindly dying. They bury their single spark of true numinous principle within a stinking skin-bag, drifting through ten thousand kalpas, ignorant of their own inversion, turning this way and that, changing faces and altering heads, endlessly revolving in the wheel of rebirth—when will they ever emerge?\n\nDisciples, having already received the precepts, you have emerged. Having emerged, you may escape suffering. Escaping suffering, you may depart from the world. Disciples, to escape suffering, first endure suffering. Without enduring suffering, one cannot escape suffering. You must follow the true words of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not chase their empty names. You must establish the resolve of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, not merely speak of their fruits. You must plant the roots of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally their rewards will come. You must accumulate the virtue of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally attain their Dao. You must enact the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, and naturally realize their station. If one’s actions do not match one’s words, if one’s words exceed one’s deeds, one remains an unprogressive ordinary person. How could such a spiritless person ever attain the Dao of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas?\n\nDisciples! You must set great resolve and make great vows—only then can you depart from the world.\n\nThus I speak these verses:\n\n*\"Disciples, listen with wholehearted intent to what I say:\nResolve can sever the bonds of birth and death.\nFirst endure suffering to master body and mind;\nWhen suffering ends, sweetness comes, and death revives.\n\nSet resolve in the heart to sweep away dust,\nTurning back worldly passions to depart the world.\nInverting the Dipper’s handle, stand towering,\nUnmoved in true emptiness, on the white jade terrace.\n\nDo not wish for active striving, lest you become an external path;\nDo not wish for inaction, lest you stray into heterodox teachings.\nNeither non-being nor being—wish for harmony,\nNeither existence nor non-existence—cultivate awakened illumination.\n\nSet resolve not to be swayed by circumstances;\nThough circumstances be perilous, the heart remains unshaken.\nAble to turn circumstances with the mind’s Dharma,\nWisdom’s sky opens, light pervades all.\n\nSet resolve not to be moved by worldly things;\nIf moved by them, apply true mechanism.\nOnce authority is lost to demonic hands,\nThe wheel turns at their will—too late for regret.\n\nSet resolve not to be hindered by affairs or principles;\nClinging and attachment bind one to appearances.\nWhen principles are clear and affairs penetrated, hindrances dissolve,\nLiberation in true emptiness dispels illusory delusion.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the ear in hearing sounds;\nInwardly listen with the ear-root to perceive the true source.\nGuard against the ear’s leakage, lest true nature be deluded;\nEndure humiliation first by sealing the ears.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the eye in seeing forms;\nContain the light, inwardly illuminating emptiness and whiteness.\nGuard against the eyes’ leakage, lest primordial spirit be scattered;\nWhen the eyes see nothing, the heart’s lord is unified.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the mouth in uttering words;\nAccord with the Dao, speak sparingly, return to spontaneity.\nSpeaking the Dharma without words completes the teaching;\nWithout speech or words, qi naturally flows.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the tongue in tasting flavors;\nKilling and harming life offend gods and ghosts.\nGolden nectar, jade liquid, sweet spring fragrance,\nDivine water, dripping sweet dew—these nourish.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the nose in smelling scents;\nThe human heart stirs thoughts, corrupting true constancy.\nSince liberating from celestial fragrances,\nEach offers the incense of the heart to the heavens above.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the body in reckless movement;\nAlways maintain dignity, abandoning laziness and carelessness.\nFilial impiety and defilement corrupt the numinous root;\nThe Dao-body is solemn, reverent, and respectful.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the heart in opposing things;\nAnger and wrath arise without cause.\nSubdue the heart, follow principle in action,\nHarmonious qi flows, the spirit rejoices.\n\nSet resolve not to follow the will in changing;\nSincerity and integrity are ever present in thought.\nThe heart without dual thoughts, the will without otherness,\nVigilance in solitude, sincerity preserved, return to the one vow.\n\nSet resolve not to be entangled by love’s bonds;\nLove’s bonds entrap like ropes and chains.\nYou must uproot love’s roots entirely,\nSever every sprout to board the Dharma-boat.\n\nSet resolve not to follow reckless and inferior companions;\nInferior friends and reckless followers lack steadfast hearts.\nThey erode the thought of the Dao, lose true mind,\nHow can one walk the path with those who ruin the teaching?\n\nSet resolve not to be misled by blind teachers;\nThe six roots and six dusts—let the heart not abide.\nNot relying on any dharma, perceive the true mechanism;\nExternal paths and side doors cannot ferry the body across.\n\nSet resolve first to receive the initial true precepts;\nUpholding the ten precepts, the heart remains uncorrupted.\nSubduing the heart, guarding the rules, not losing the true,\nThe four great deportments are diligently maintained.\n\nSet resolve to advance and receive the middle ultimate precepts;\nIn secret action, subtle movement, observe self-mastery.\nThe physical body is liberated, becoming the Dharma-body,\nRealizing the three bodies, transcending kalpas beyond.\n\nSet resolve to repay kindness with earnest heart;\nThe four great debts are profound—you must settle them.\nAble to repay deep kindness with body and life,\nFilial children and loyal ministers delight heaven and earth.\n\nSet resolve to cultivate the true by first discarding the false;\nDo not feign deafness or pretend to be mute.\nTrue heart, sincere intent—no deception or concealment;\nEven a little falsity turns one into a donkey or horse.\n\nSet resolve to sever killing, stealing, and lust,\nWine, sex, wealth, anger, greed, ignorance, and wrath.\"*",

      "translated_text": "All assembled,\n\nThose who have established苦志 and made great vows—today I entrust each one to you, exhorting you again and again. You, the esteemed disciples who uphold the Dao and transform others, the immortal youths who propagate the宗风, the灵童 who continue the Dao’s lineage, the Daoists who break through the heavenly barrier—across the Ten Continents and Three Isles, all have heard, all have come to know.\n\nEach of you must reflect deeply: set your mind early on a vow of cultivation, for that is the true advantage.\n\nHark!\nIf this body is not liberated in this life,\nIn what life will it be liberated?\n\nTime flies like an arrow, days and months shuttle like a loom. From the day you left the household life until now, you have dallied through the years, frittered away the seasons. Your hair is frosted, your skin wrinkled, your teeth loosening, your sinews stiffening, your flesh sagging.\n\nAlas!\nWhen the bones soften, you cannot walk far;\nWhen the blood is depleted, you cannot bear heavy burdens.\nWhen essence withers and the kidneys fail, your eyes grow dim;\nWhen spirit is weary and the heart is wild, your one灵 is unsettled.\nWhen the魂 fades and the魄 swells, your ears droop to listen;\nWhen the stomach is strong but the spleen weak, your appetite wanes.\n\nAll assembled, know this: this body is originally illusory. No matter how sturdy, the day of death will come—only the timing differs. When your ears grow deaf, your eyes dim, your tongue parched, your teeth loose and shaking; when your waist aches, your back bends, your hair whitens, your beard withers; when your sinews harden, your hands and feet grow numb, your resolve weakens, your heart cools and your thoughts chill—these are the summons sent by King Yama, courteously awaiting your early arrival.\n\nDo not cling to the tender-heartedness of old women, the petty trade of tofu vendors, the short-sightedness of dwarves, the delusion of beasts—fixated on the present, heedless of the next life. If today the ghost comes to claim you, you cannot refuse; you must go. Though you call yourselves Daoists, having left the household life to escape the mundane, can you truly evade this fate? Why not see through it clearly and attain liberation early?\n\nTake one step in vigilance, let go and proceed—only then will you be a true man of courage, an extraordinary man. Stand firm in resolve, display your skill, leave the household to cultivate. Otherwise, with timid spirit and feeble countenance, the four great elements—wind, fire, earth, and water—each rush to their own ends, while the faculties of sight, hearing, and wisdom scatter in all directions. Muttering and murmuring, drifting and floating, aimless and adrift, you sink into hell.\n\nAh!\nAll assembled,\nTo cultivate without resolve\nIs like a puppet show—\nWhen the gongs and drums end,\nWhere will you go?\n\nOnly with resolve can one transcend the world;\nWithout it, success is ten thousand times harder.\nOnly by establishing resolve and cultivating the true Dao\nCan the mighty and divine not be taken lightly.\n\n**Fourteen Marks of Verification**\n\nDisciples, if you wish to cultivate the wondrous Dao of purity, non-action, and self-mastery, you must first have resolve and act with self-mastery. If you can achieve self-mastery, the natural Dao will naturally be within it. But if you cannot act with self-mastery, how can you attain the natural?\n\nIf you cannot even complete worldly affairs, how can you achieve self-mastery?\n\nThe immortal masters say:\n*\"To cultivate the Dao of immortality, first cultivate the human Dao.\nIf the human Dao is not cultivated, the immortal Dao is far indeed.\"*\n\nThe Confucians say:\n*\"First put your household in order, then you may govern the state.\"*\nOrdering the household is like the human Dao; governing the state is like the immortal Dao.\nIf you cannot govern your household, how can you govern the state?\n\nThe Buddhists say:\n*\"You must exhaust the mundane mind; there is no separate sagely understanding.\"*\nThis mundane mind is the principle of the Three Bonds and Five Constants. If you can act in accordance with it, the human Dao is complete, and cultivating immortality is not difficult. Even if you cannot become a sage, an immortal, or a buddha, it will still be easy.\n\nHow, then, to advance in the cultivation of the immortal Dao?\n\nDisciples, since entering the Mystery Gate, learning to be Daoists, taking a master, and receiving transmissions, you have gone to sit in meditation and quiet the mind, believing you have already exhausted the human Dao of the mundane world and that the immortal Dao is within reach. Yet you have not even fully cultivated the reverence due to your master. The oral transmissions you received are confused and indistinct, yet you rush to act without foundation. As soon as you begin, you seek results. After sitting for two or three days without seeing any signs, you abandon it. Then you seek another master, receive a few words, and sit again. This fleeting desire for the Dao lasts no more than two or three days before you again crave results, your thoughts restless and unceasing. With such a deluded mind and shallow wisdom, your meager cultivation is in vain. Though you think and ponder endlessly, your spirit cannot settle—it is all but a dream. After sitting for twenty or thirty years, you remain an ordinary mortal, unaware even at the hour of death.\n\nAlas! You have wasted time, squandered the years, grasping at the moon in water, plucking flowers in a mirror—easy to imagine, but where is the ready-made immortal?\n\nPitiful are those misled by blind masters, deceived by heterodox teachings. I will say no more of this. I only urge you to reflect deeply on the chapter of strict precepts and the resolve to repay kindness. First correct your thoughts, eliminate afflictions and ignorance. Single-mindedly turn toward the Dao, take refuge in the Three Treasures, recite the true scriptures, and follow the precepts in conduct. Sit in the Ten Directions Hall for a hundred days: maintain dignified appearance, stabilize the physical form, keep all matters orderly, and hold the body upright. Then, with reverent movement and prostration, invoke the true master, vow not to pursue the lesser or middle vehicles, and with sincere devotion, seek to hear the wondrous Dao of the supreme, most true, great vehicle—pure, liberated, and natural. Only when you awaken to life and death and forever escape the cycle of rebirth may you receive the Ten Precepts of the Initial Truth.",

Only after hearing the Dao may one ascend the meditation cushion, still the mind, and quiet thoughts, cutting off deliberation and forgetting emotions. Apply effort to the ground of the heart, wholly casting aside worldly affairs. Carefully contemplate the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Central Ultimate received in transmission, penetrating them thoroughly to comprehend that the great matter of karmic conditions lies within the body, not outside the mind. In secret, engage in earnest inquiry, perfecting wondrous practice until it is complete, and verify it against the natural state of emptiness. At the hundred-foot pole’s tip, advance yet further. Do not distort the crooked into the straight, nor force arguments from ignorance.\n\nYet some, having recognized a few places of practice or obtained a single hermitage, taking in one or two disciples, become self-satisfied and arrogant, no longer holding the precepts, concentration, and wisdom in their hearts. They neither emulate the discipline masters of strict deportment nor harmonize with fellow practitioners. Illiterate and half-witted, their own transformation incomplete, they falsely exalt themselves, claiming to others, “We practice the supreme vehicle’s work.” They take up a fan, scribbling a few alchemical phrases, hang a pouch with several alchemical scriptures, and fill gourds with all manner of herbs, deceiving laypeople for silver. They boast of receiving extraordinary transmissions of elixir formulas from immortals, using the silver to buy wine and meat.

      "translated_text": "They corrupt the methods of the Supreme Dao and sully the reputation of the Perfect Realization. These law-destroying disciples, these precept-breaking practitioners—seeds of sin—will, when their evil fills to the brim, face the judgment of celestial tribunals and fall forever into hell. How lamentable! How grievous!\n\nThere is yet another sort: those newly entered into the Daoist gate, their aspirations small and vows narrow. They seek only seated meditation for ease, unwilling to subdue the heart and master the qi, to sever attachments and cut off passions. Clinging to the mud and water, they remain entangled in form and hold fast to deluded thoughts. All they desire is the verification of their practice, moving qi and shifting essence, fixating on apertures until they fall into confusion, mistaking the thief for their own child, long deluded without awakening. Refusing to humbly seek confirmation, to observe, inquire, and investigate, their illusions grow ingrained until they become irredeemable. Many thus harm themselves and lose their lives, falling into the cycle of rebirth. They take the boundless Great Dao and treat it as a thing of flesh and blood, mistaking the consciousness for the primordial spirit, allowing it to turn them about—how then can they ever transcend life and death?\n\nDisciples, you must heed my words: sweep away at once all these heterodox paths, deviant methods, and divergent branches. Cast them aside with bold resolve. Temper body, heart, and intent within the mandate of heaven and the nature of your being. Do not covet immediate results; seek only the awakening of the heart. With resolve, press forward on this path—even if it be a wall of bronze or iron, you must break through. Naturally, there will come a day of emergence, a moment when the fruit ripens and the stem falls away, when the heart-mind suddenly awakens in luminous clarity, penetrating heaven and earth.\n\nIf your blessings are meager and your karmic conditions shallow, you must accumulate virtue and merit, advancing with courage and vigor. Should you fail to awaken in this life, you will awaken in the next; if not in the next, then in some future life among thousands—yet you will not fail to awaken eventually. Set this vow, and your resolve for enlightenment will never waver, age after age. You will surely become a sage of great compassion and vast vows, ultimately attaining the Dao.\n\nYet worldly fortune is easily cultivated, while spiritual fortune is difficult to nurture. If you are resolved to follow the path of transcendence, it is the true Dao—not that of alchemical refinement seeking immortality, which is but an external path. Such practitioners are but ghosts guarding tombs, lingering for millennia. The boundless, tranquil, and true Dao of the Wuji does not seek quick results or immediate merit. It does not fix upon three or nine years but takes seeing the nature as its essence. Daily, there are signs of efficacy; moment by moment, transformation occurs: the mouth is moistened with sweetness, the limbs grow firm, the head assumes a spherical form, the heavenly gate opens in the brain, fire steams within the abdomen, and the bones of the body resound. Yet these are but the achievements of middle and lower cultivation. Step by step, you must return to the Dao-body.\n\nFor the Dao is fundamentally emptiness, its essence fundamentally nothingness—hence it is called Wuji. If your practice loses its proper return and you take what is presently attained as true attainment, you fall into heterodoxy and external paths. Thus, a hair’s breadth of deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles.\n\nAs for those who cling to names and grasp at forms, vainly guarding their cauldrons, establishing their tripods, ascending lead at the hour of zi and descending mercury at the hour of wu, advancing the yang fire and retreating the yin tally, practicing according to the hexagrams and seeking verification by the hour—those who do not recognize the return to the Dao-body—all these are but lesser paths of the lower vehicle.\n\nThe wondrous Dao of tranquil non-action, by contrast, is the natural path of return, vastly different from these. Consider, for example, the *Huangjing*: when you first arouse the heart and set your resolve, vowing to transcend the mundane, this initial aspiration is like the Jade Maiden releasing fragrance. As soon as the heart’s incense is released, it revives the six paths of rebirth, and all who hear this fragrance are universally delivered. This release of fragrance is the practice; this hearing of fragrance is the effect.\n\nOr consider the Jade Emperor radiating light: it gathers all heavens and earths, all Wuji worlds, into its illumination, as if infinite mirrors reflecting one another—this is the effect. Cutting through obstacles is the practice; the seventeen lights and thirty kinds of merit are the effect. The *Merit Chapter* and the *Karmic Response Chapter* are the karmic effects of the sutra-chanter.\n\nIf you were once frivolous and restless, your mouth never still, uttering only reckless words; your hands never ceasing, ever in haste—",

      "translated_text": "Feet never still, merely wandering blindly; sitting never still, only slouching askew; sleep never settled, the body tossing and turning; eyes darting all around—now gazing east, now peering west—striding forth like a gust of wind, no semblance of the conduct of one who cultivates the Dao.\n\nLike an ox yet to have its nose pierced, a horse without bridle, not following the central and upright path. Now, having received the precepts and donned the robe and headcloth, carrying the alms bowl and wearing the shoes, the body assumes the appearance of one who is wholly true. Following others in their affairs, listening to their words and observing their ways, you transform your former coarse and hasty demeanor into one of composed and courteous conduct—this is the practice of upholding the precepts. Transmuting your temperament and adopting the countenance of the Dao, so that others, upon seeing you, feel reverence—this is the outward manifestation of upholding the precepts.\n\nIf you can uphold the wondrous conduct, refine your thoughts to align with the Dao, seeking only to clarify the mind and perceive your nature, not chasing after effects, worrying only that your practice is insufficient, not that effects will fail to come—then, when the great timing matures, you will awaken completely. But if your practice is not steadfast, if your mind wavers between two or three intentions, if you falter in doubt, then the heart is not true and the spirit not efficacious; thoughts are not pure and qi does not gather. With spirit adrift and qi floating, the heart’s resolve unsteady—from where could effects arise?\n\nNow that you have great aspirations to escape the wheel of rebirth, first expand your capacity, focus on your practice, and set effects aside—then it will be wondrous. It is like a skilled physician administering medicine, ensuring harmony; an inept physician, seeking quick results, disregards the root, chasing immediate effects. Though near-term effects may appear, the primordial qi is ultimately harmed, the original source momentarily unrecovered, and myriad complications arise. The patient, unaware, regrets it too late.\n\nDisciples, if you truly practice day and night according to the precepts, follow the rituals in cultivation, constantly rouse yourselves, and ceaselessly inquire—how could effects not manifest? Yet even if your chest feels open and your vision clear, you must still subdue your will and humble your heart, drawing near to those of virtue to verify and ascend to higher understanding.\n\nNever become attached to the notion of self, forgetting others; nor attached to others, forgetting the self. With no duality in the heart and the four illusions emptied, the effects of virtue and fortune will naturally follow.\n\nDisciples, the cultivation of the Dao depends entirely on a single heart. If the heart is true and the resolve sincere, the Dao becomes intimate. When thoughts cease and the heart is empty and still—where in practice will efficacy not arise?\n\nThe heart must be cold, thoughts must turn to ash—from cold ash, a mighty sprout bursts forth. True fire and qi illuminate all things, like the sun radiating brilliance in the sky. Steadfastly uphold the precepts in practice, and in samadhi, the effects of wisdom’s light will be known. Within, a millet grain contains heaven and earth; to speak of it to others is folly.\n\nDisciples, heed these teachings: how can one with a coarse heart and floating qi become an immortal? Swiftly follow the precepts to cultivate merit and conduct, with firm resolve and unwavering heart, severing wayward thoughts. Cultivate in seclusion, sitting silently in the mountains, closing the mountain gate—let the heart not be coarse. With the four illusions emptied and the heart stilled, the Dao harmonizes and flows.\n\nNow I reveal this celestial mechanism to you: the manifestation of merit lies solely in the heart’s application. Diligence in practice and austerity yield abundant efficacy; every moment, every instant, be steadfast and deep. Within the heart’s stillness, reflect inwardly—let no one else know even half. Do not cling to the mind’s inner realm, for that is the moment of great awakening.\n\nThe deluded cat guarding its burrow stirs ignorance; vain thoughts conceive and give birth to the sacred infant. When will the Golden Lord ride the azure tiger? Where does the Wooden Mother mount the white dragon? Atop the crown, the Three Flowers radiate brilliantly; within the body, the Five Qi surge powerfully. Pitiable are those who do not recognize the true message, their spirit terrace blocked and nature obstructed.\n\nI tell you: do not slander the precepts as lowly—they are the foundation for entering the Dao without effort. Like a raft poled through the waves to cross the sea, like a ladder raised in the void to ascend to heaven. Do not boast of your own arrogance, nor slander others to debate right and wrong. If you refuse to accept this, that is your choice—why create obstacles to sow doubt in others?\n\nOnly when your lips praise and your heart rejoices are you one who promotes the mystery and protects the teaching. If you generate slander, you will incur heavenly retribution—karmic consequences have always been true and certain.\n\nHark! Why not be a good person? Why not speak good words? Why not cultivate the great Dao? Instead, you scheme and contrive, failing to follow the precepts and samadhi in practice—how can you inherit the robe and bowl of the Most High? Without cultivating both merit and wisdom, how can you attain liberation of body and mind? Without understanding the principles, acting recklessly—how can you unravel the mechanism? Without removing obstacles and ignorance, how can your heart’s capacity expand?\n\nMany transgressions are worse than few; reckless speech is worse than silence. The supreme Dao is not like heterodox paths—how can you lightly chatter and wag your tongue? Everywhere, secret teachings are sold for coin—karmic consequences, high and low, are clear. If you remain deluded and unenlightened, you will face death without life. Reborn as swine or sheep, your karmic retribution will be slaughter at the hands of others. How can you escape the unseen and seen realms of heaven and earth? The Three Primes and Five Offerings will examine you.\n\nKnow that the sun and moon, yin and yang, are not a muddled darkness. Naturally, the delusion of such a person is evident—disciples, be aware and do not slander what is right. With profound compassion, I exhort you repeatedly: take refuge early in the Three Thousand Great Precepts. With no obstacles in the heart, right and wrong are empty—whether sitting, lying, walking, or practicing, all is unobstructed. From this day forth, the flames of karmic fire dissolve into empty illusions, and the radiance of night reports the dawn in the Dharma hall.\n\nWithin precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, liberation is born; uphold the precepts with sincere resolve, and you will traverse and verify the profound. If you doubt that the precepts are deceptive transmissions, heaven will despise you and condemn you to have your tongue torn out. When a learner awakens without doubt or confusion, floating clouds disperse, and the wind clears all.\n\nBeyond the kalpas, you will wander freely and at ease, suddenly severing the entangling vines of distraction.",

      "translated_text": "Following the ritual to honor the Heavenly Worthy, the voice does not rise, the head does not tilt. Within and without, the spirit remains unwavering—though still in mortal form, the Dao is already perfected.\n\nPerfection in the Dao is neither easy nor difficult; whether upholding or loosening the precepts lies within the heart. From life to death, from death to life, one emerges through precepts and samadhi. Once having taken refuge, do not neglect the precepts as mere obstinacy.\n\n**Fifteen Methods for Preserving Life and Prolonging Existence**\n\nDisciples, when I previously took the high seat, I repeatedly exhorted you to rouse courage, to vow great vows, and to seek early clarity on life and death. You must not diminish your resolve, nor follow the Two Vehicles’ path of clinging to life and fearing death. Now, I speak again of the mind-method for preserving life and prolonging existence—does this not amount to duplicitous speech, deluding sentient beings?\n\nDisciples, the mind-method for preserving life and prolonging existence that I speak of is not attachment to the physical form, nor mere talk of essence and qi, urging you to preserve post-heavenly lifespan or extend this transient existence. What I now call *preserving life* refers to the mandate of heaven as nature, safeguarding the life bestowed by heaven, abiding in ease while awaiting its fulfillment.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"the mandate of heaven as nature\"—the *wisdom-life* of the Buddhist school, the *original destiny-star* of the Daoist gate. This *life* is the longevity that does not perish in death. As the *Vajracchedikā* states: *\"How does one attain long life? As the indestructible vajra-body.\"* Moreover, the mandate of heaven is non-dual; cultivate body and mind to await its realization. To exhaust principle and fulfill nature so as to reach life is the essential principle of establishing destiny.\n\nWhat I speak of as *prolonging* is not curing illness to extend years or achieving immortality in death. Rather, it is the true nature that remains unbroken through ten thousand kalpas, the Dharma-body that endures through ancient ages, the embodiment that nurtures all beings—no ordinary form. If you point to the skin-bag and cultivate it, you may live a few more years, but death will only come later; this is not the true Dao.\n\nWhat I now call *preserving life through cultivation* is to equalize heaven and earth and harmonize with the ten thousand things. Though heaven and earth undergo change and movement, my original nature knows no change. Though the ten thousand things have ends and limits, my original nature knows no end. Though heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things pass through kalpas, cycles, and epochs, my serene and constant true nature—lucid and unobscured—transcends form, free from destruction, decay, or alteration.\n\nThis is the life preserved, the existence prolonged. It is the true and constant Dao of heavenly principle flowing ceaselessly, the unending cycle of life. This passage reveals words spoken only out of necessity. If one with clear eyes awakens to the profound seat of Dharma-teaching, silent and soundless, they will grasp the message within.\n\nThe boundless Great Dao encompasses heaven and earth, leaving nothing behind, present at all times, inherent in all things, all-encompassing. In daily life, every moment is the Dao: seeing and hearing, walking and standing, sitting and lying, eating and resting, advancing and retreating, dressing and dining, in clear or cloudy skies, in cold or heat—everywhere the Dao.\n\nYet how is it that you remain bound by material obstructions and constrained by qi, unaware in your daily lives? Within emptiness, the luminous responds clearly, yet before echoes and shadows, you stumble blindly. Today, I rely on the patriarchs of the Three Teachings, their compassion for universal salvation, their vow to benefit beings—thus I cannot refrain from speaking at length to you.\n\nTherefore, I universally proclaim to all beings: there is no second method. If there were two, it would not be the path of the Great Vehicle’s perfect awakening. This single spark of your spiritual nature is another name for *wisdom-life*; originally, it is one thing. This *wisdom-life* is but a provisional name for the substance of the Dao, fundamentally of one source. Though they emerge together, they differ; thus, they embrace the Three Teachings while bubbling forth as one.\n\nThis *wisdom-life* manifests moment to moment, yet you do not see its form; it hides instant by instant, yet you do not know its whereabouts. It preaches the Dharma day by day, yet you do not hear its voice.",
      "overlap_context": "rma hall.\n\nWithin precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, liberation is born; uphold the precepts with sincere resolve, and you will traverse and verify the profound. If you doubt that the precepts are deceptive transmissions, heaven will despise you and condemn you to have your tongue torn out. When a learner awakens without doubt or confusion, floating clouds disperse, and the wind clears all.\n\nBeyond the kalpas, you will wander freely and at ease, suddenly severing the entangling vines of distraction.",

      "translated_text": "Are you not like fools searching for fire by the light of a lamp, or riding an ox in quest of the ox itself? My disciples, why must you strive to preserve it? I fear you do not recognize this *wisdom-life* as the sacred treasure it is. I know you well—at every turn, you resist and defy it, not as seasoned practitioners who see their nature, nor as elders who grasp the mind’s intent.\n\nMoreover, even when you encounter it, you do not employ it. And when you do attempt to use it, you cannot wield it fully. The moment this spark of life departs, it is as though the Primordial Heavenly Worthy has left the Dharma throne, the Yellow Emperor has lost the Mystic Pearl, Iron Crutch Li has mislaid his staff, or Zhang Guolao his blue donkey. Mouths remain but cannot speak; hands grope at empty nostrils. Hearts exist yet lack the aperture—bereft of subtlety, they vanish into obscurity.\n\nNow, I do this to fulfill the sacred intent of the Primordial One’s teaching and to honor the great virtue of Qiuzu’s compassion for all life. Thus, I pour the nectar of awakening upon you, urging you to swiftly discern the wondrous principle of preserving life and prolonging existence.\n\nHave you not heard of the *Supreme Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture for Dispelling Disaster and Protecting Life*? If you, my disciples, can truly awaken to this sutra, you will perpetuate your *wisdom-life* endlessly, generation after generation without cease. Yet if you merely recite its name with your lips as an offering, this is not true awakening. Those who make such offerings recite and depart, unable to savor its depths.\n\nDoes the sutra not say: “All you beings, since time without beginning, have allowed the mind to be enslaved by form and thoughts to drift with circumstances. Ever entangled in love and delusion without respite, you drift upon the river of attachment and sink into the sea of desire. Clinging to illusory forms and appearances, you obscure your original face. The Dao is formless, yet you grasp it as form; the Dao is not empty, yet you cling to emptiness. Deluded by the interplay of form and emptiness, confused by existence and non-existence, you cannot attain clarity. How then can you escape the path of birth and death, leap beyond the karma of cyclic existence?\n\nOnly those who know emptiness yet do not abide in emptiness, who know form yet do not cling to form, who are free from the view of emptiness and detached from all doubts and leaks—only such persons can purify the six senses and sever all obstructions. This is the essence of my teaching, the Dharma I expound and entrust to you. The sutra is called *Protecting Life to Attain the Dharma*, for the universal salvation of beings, to propagate the teaching in the world and circulate its recitation. Those who recite and transmit it will be guarded by flying heavenly kings, vajra warriors who shatter evil, Dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverers from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts—countless hosts who shield this sutra, enabling all to depart from defilements.”\n\nO assembly! How can this bodily form know emptiness yet not abide in emptiness, know form yet not cling to form, perceive the Dharma of non-emptiness, penetrate all barriers, and enter the gate of myriad wonders? Therefore, I first elucidate the sutra’s profound truths to safeguard the *wisdom-life* of this great assembly.\n\nThe ancestral masters, in their compassion, fear that you, my disciples, will mistake this fleshly form for your true self. You must abide in non-emptiness within emptiness, in non-form within form, in non-existence within existence, in non-emptiness within emptiness—lest this illusory, blood-and-flesh body enslave you, tossing you endlessly to and fro, deluding you into losing the true teaching and forfeiting the treasure of wisdom.\n\nThus, this sutra urges each of you to protect your spiritual root, to nurture your original essence. When the root is firm, the Dao arises. The noble one delights in Heaven, thus preserving life; untouched by premature death or longevity, this is prolonging existence. The noble one serves Heaven, thus the *wisdom-life* endures. Hence, generation after generation flows unceasingly, nurturing and circulating, attaining the indestructible vajra body and realizing the true, untainted Dharma-body.\n\nO assembly! The Three Caverns and Four Treasuries, the Five Thousand and Three Hundred True Writings—all point to prolonging life and preserving destiny, only then can one transcend kalpas and rise above the dust. Clinging to appearances is not preserving life; true emptiness is prolonging existence. *Wisdom-nature* does not depart from *wisdom-life*; *wisdom-light* is the *wisdom-lamp*. If you wish the *wisdom-light* to shine constantly, the *wisdom-life* must abide in steadfastness. Abiding in unceasing stillness, the lamp’s light naturally remains bright. Awakening to the true suchness, the lamp shines perpetually, illuminating and guiding all beings. The light is not truly light to be seen; the brightness is not truly brightness to be named. It is merely the inherent nature of life, provisionally called light and clarity.\n\nForm and emptiness, birth and death in the world—through emptiness and form, life is preserved and existence prolonged. Prolonging existence is transcending the kalpa; transcending the kalpa, what death is there? What name remains? Beings, only because of deluded wisdom, drift and sink through kalpas without end. The *wisdom-lamp* and *wisdom-light* illuminate universally—awaken swiftly to the causes of discipline!\n\nNow, I offer the wondrous method of preservation and prolongation: in the stillness of emptiness, I point it out to you all.\n\nO disciples, my disciples! The sutra says: “If you cannot see it when using it, life may be preserved; if you see it yet cannot use it, existence may be prolonged. Only by extinguishing the moving mind while not extinguishing the illuminating mind can existence be prolonged; only by extinguishing the abiding mind and concentrating the empty mind can life be preserved. To prolong existence is to ensure the *wisdom-life* remains unbroken, and the great elixir is accomplished; to preserve life is to realize non-birth, and the great cinnabar is achieved.”\n\n“Life does not abide in constancy; if one cultivates the Dao well, one attains it; if not, one loses it. Receiving life from Heaven, one must heed Heaven’s luminous mandate. Though Zhou is an ancient state, its mandate is ever renewed.” These are the true principles of preservation and prolongation, the great Dao of establishing destiny.\n\nDisciples, if you can awaken to this point, you have grasped the wonder. Now, I do not begrudge this supreme treasure—I empty my bag and overturn my sack, revealing the profound mystery. Here are four verses for the assembly to ponder deeply:\n\n*Life’s brevity or length is destined,*\n*Coming and going in birth—no birth at all.*\n*To prolong or preserve, seek no other method;*\n*The Dharma returns to no-Dharma, the city of the Dharma King.*\n\n*Jade Garden Altar Scripture, Lower Scroll: Sixteen Expansions of the Teaching and Propagation of the Dao*",

      "translated_text": "Disciples, what this poor Daoist expounded yesterday from the high seat speaks of the Dao-body as non-action and the Dharma-body as reality itself. Yet you must understand that the Dao-body does not lie beyond the ordinary body, and the Dharma-body resides within the physical form. The physical body is fortified by the adornments of external, active virtue; the Dharma-body is purified by the adornments of internal, inactive virtue. When both inner and outer are cleansed, and the two are awakened to, then the spirit is liberated—attaining the supreme, unsurpassable, indestructible true emptiness, the great luminosity, the great perfection, the invincible. All spirits pay homage, thunder is commanded, the Three Realms are upheld, the Five Emperors receive and escort, and wisdom penetrates all. This is not something cultivated through active virtue.\n\nDisciples, secure essence and nurture qi, and qi will settle while essence congeals. Naturally still the fire and return the wind, and essence transforms into qi, steaming the four great elements and harmonizing the myriad spirits. When true fire burns without smoke, qi is pure; when spirit-water does not leak, the spirit is still. Pure qi transforms into spirit; still spirit merges with emptiness. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness is profound, the original true returns, and the nine refinements and seven reversions restore life to its root. Returning to the root is the establishment of life and the preservation of true nature. When true nature is preserved, the Dao-body manifests. When the Dao-body manifests, the Dharma-body appears.\n\nDisciples, this is the Dao-body cultivated within activity as non-action, the Dharma-body cultivated within non-use as use. The physical body has a lifespan; the Dharma-body has a wisdom-life. Lifespan is bestowed by Heaven, not by oneself, so the physical body undergoes the cycles of rebirth and death, the revolutions of kalpas. Wisdom-life is determined by me, not by Heaven, so the Dharma-body wields sovereign power, liberated and unobstructed.\n\nDisciples, the lifespan of the physical body is finite, and fixed karma is inescapable—when Heaven decrees death, one cannot but die. The wisdom-life of the Dharma-body is infinite, its spiritual powers vast, eternally realizing non-birth, thus attaining true longevity. Disciples, even if the physical body endures for ten thousand years, it is merely called a demon, not the Dao. The Dharma-body comes and goes yet remains constant—“Hearing the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening” is the true saying of the utmost sage. The Dharma-body does not perish in death, hence it is called long life. The physical body dies and dies again, hence it is impermanent.\n\nDisciples, if you awaken to the Dharma-body, even those of short, impermanent lives may attain longevity. If you cling to the physical body as form, even those of boundless longevity fall into the cycle of rebirth. The essential secret in a single word: see through the physical body, empty all cares, cultivate with true sincerity, unstained by a speck of dust. Do not let the Dharma-body be trapped within the physical body; instead, see through the physical body to liberate the Dharma-body. Is this not the great turning of the Dharma-wheel, the flourishing of the Dao’s destiny?\n\nNow, in expounding and propagating the Dao through filial piety, all depends on the constant turning of the Dharma-wheel. To restore the ancestral Dao to radiance, if the Dharma-body of beings is not illuminated, who will come to its protection? As it is said: if the teaching is not propagated, the Dao will not be clear; if the Dao is not clear, the Dharma cannot be practiced; if the Dharma cannot be practiced, the Dao cannot be propagated. The utmost sage has said: “Humans can propagate the Dao; the Dao does not propagate humans.” You must each recognize yourselves as propagators of the Dao, practice the methods of propagating the Dao, and expound the mechanisms of illuminating the Dao. Then how can the Dao’s lineage not flourish, or the ancestral wind decline?\n\nIn my youth, I studied little and did not widely read the books. Unversed in Confucianism and Buddhism, I foolishly sought the learning of the Dao, wandering within the realm for decades, determined to fathom its source. What I sought was the seeking of my own innate knowledge; what I questioned was the questioning of my original wisdom-nature. After long inner seeking, innate knowledge alone revealed itself on the cinnabar terrace; after deep inner questioning, wisdom-nature gave birth to clarity in the empty chamber. With an inner host, why fear receiving guests or responding to visitors? With a true origin within, I desired to propagate the teaching and spread the Dao.\n\nDisciples, I am dull in literary matters and ashamed before the jade cases of the Three Caverns. Having read few alchemical classics, I had no means to transcribe the true immortal’s precious secrets. For my nature is lazy, fond of leisure and stillness. Constantly cultivating the wisdom-life, I delved deeply into the subtle and imperceptible, casting aside all affairs to embrace the true origin alone. Where would I find the time to read Confucian books or study alchemical classics? Thus, even now, I am unskilled in writing, clumsy in speech, and can only roughly and crudely speak these utmost true words and most secret mysteries—unrevealed esoteric teachings—for you to hear.\n\nYet the Dao is fundamentally wordless—why expound it? The scriptures are originally unlearned—why open a hall? The teaching upholds non-action—why trouble oneself with much ado? This Dao is everyone’s share; one cannot be separated from it for even a moment. Whether in the world or in the Dao, one may awaken and inquire—why must one leave the world, seek teachers, or find friends? Only because this matter of life and death remains unresolved in the heart do we hunger and search for food, rush east and west, to the ends of the sea and sky, seeking a method to restore life to its root.\n\nFortunately, the Jade Purity, Highest Purity, and Supreme Purity transmitted the scriptures, expounded the Dharma, established teachings, and opened altars, propagating the lineage to this day. Even the Confucians—Master Zhou, the two Cheng Masters, Master Zhang, and Master Zhu—received the secrets of the sacred scriptures and elucidated the essentials of the mind’s method. Then there are the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, and *Heart Sūtra*—the true principles of Buddhism, the profound mysteries of stilling the body and shedding desire. The Three Teachings share one aim: the single Dao of nature and life, all compassionately delivering beings from distress and saving them from suffering.\n\nNow, I have been humbly listed among the disciples of Master Qiu, following the example to propagate the Dharma-treasures, receive and expound them.

      "translated_text": "Students, I am but an ordinary mortal, devoid of supernatural powers. I know only the work of daily cultivation—teaching others to awaken—not for those in the Daoist gate who merely observe precepts and uphold discipline. Unlike those who peddle secrets, beg for alms, idle their days, eat without labor, and clothe themselves without toil—how could such men ever comprehend the matters of life and death? Thus, I rouse my spirit with resolve, devising a plan for universal deliverance. Above, I revive the teachings; below, I benefit all beings. This is fundamentally for the sake of sentient beings, not for myself.\n\nOur Dragon Gate lineage began with Ancestor Qiu in the Yuan dynasty, flourishing in the mysteries and spreading transformation. Four hundred years have passed, yet men of lofty attainment are rare, and those of steadfast aspiration are hard to encounter. In this declining age of the Dao, I unexpectedly devoted thirty years to upholding precepts, observing the rules, seeking truth through inquiry, and visiting masters. Heaven aligned with my resolve: I met my teacher at Wangwu, received the Dharma at the Nine Palaces, and have practiced for over twenty years. Heaven opened the Dao’s fortune, and I rejoiced to encounter this imperial dynasty, this flourishing era—where gentry and officials embrace goodness, scholars and merchants delight in giving, and those of like mind, bound by karmic affinity, meet the time to return and cultivate. Thus, I established an altar and administered precepts in the capital. For eight cycles of cold and heat, the wind stirred a thousand truths. Those of the feathered and secular realms, bound by affinity, all took refuge in precepts and samādhi, entering directly into the wondrous Dao of pure emptiness.\n\nThis poor Daoist relies solely on this spark of spiritual insight, silently moving with utmost sincerity. Moved by heavenly grace, I have met with true opportunity, presumptuously ascending the Dharma seat and recklessly acting as a precept-master. As for grandly propagating the mysteries of the Daoist gate and universally expanding the Dharma arena—this is the deepest aspiration of this poor Daoist.\n\nStudents, do not heed those who sow doubt and slander, stubbornly clinging to their meditation cushions, sealing their throats and gritting their teeth, feigning the appearance of the Dao—only to mislead themselves in the end. Such people speak of \"constant response, constant stillness.\" Response to what? They cannot even tend to their own lives—how could they tend to the lives of others?\n\nHear these words:\nThe precepts and scriptures emerge from the *Daoist Canon*;\nTransmitting precepts by the liturgy is no falsehood.\nOnly to propagate the teachings and deliver all beings—\nI pray you, deluded disciples, cease your slander.\n\nI urge you, fellow cultivators, to open your hearts and broaden your capacity,\nEndure humiliation and cultivate truth to expand the teachings.\nCultivate both samādhi and wisdom, deepening your merit and virtue,\nUniversally deliver all beings from the ocean of suffering.\n\nThose who receive precepts must first sever obstacles;\nWhen obstacles are removed, radiance shines bright.\nWhy fear your wisdom-nature lacks brilliance?\nOnly fear its light stretching ten thousandfold.\n\nConceal its flame to preserve life, and wisdom will grow;\nAbide not in prolonging life, but depart from illusory forms.\nEmbrace purity, nurture simplicity, and study non-action—\nThe wisdom-life will extend, returning to the vast and boundless.\n\nIf you stubbornly cling to the physical form,\nUnaware that when the body dies, who attains immortality?\nRefusing to deliver others, seeking only self-liberation—\nHow could immortal masters ever deliver us?\n\nReady-made robes, effortless meals—\nWho provides for each mouth and body?\nHow can the kindness of Ancestors Mi and Qiu ever be repaid?\nA single drop of water, a vast wave—\nThe cries of the *Avīci* hell echo in response.\n\nDeceiving others with offerings for ease and comfort,\nWarm clothes, full bellies, never thirsting—\nCrafting sweet words, claiming enlightenment,\nPromising to ascend and carry you away.\n\nPatrons, hearing such words, offer even more diligently,\nFoolishly chasing gold in the water.\nHow many ordinary people can awaken on their own?\nIn what year, what month, will they ascend?\n\nThose of wise awakening harbor no jealousy;\nIn stillness, they practice non-action and first liberate themselves.\nIn activity, they propagate the Dao to liberate others—\nTen thousand words, a thousand sayings, all for a single awakening.\n\nA single awakening, bound to universal deliverance—\nUniversal deliverance requires a sincere and steadfast heart.\nThe Dao flourishes, the teachings expand, the ancestral wind soars,\nLiberation in true emptiness harmonizes the nature of the mind.\n\n---\n\nSeventeen Generations of Deliverance\n\nStudents, the propagation of the teachings and expansion of the Dao that I speak of is not for myself, nor even for the sake of the teachings—it is solely to embody the Dao and emulate Heaven, delivering all beings. If the sages of the Three Teachings had not acted for the sake of sentient beings, why would they have established teachings, transmitted scriptures, proclaimed altars, revealed truths, and tirelessly extended compassionate means?\n\nStudents, the Confucian gate honors the Most Sage Former Teacher.\nHis virtue matched the Supreme Ultimate, his Dao perfected the Great Achievement;\nNeither obstinate nor inflexible, neither self nor others;\nHe edited the *Book of Documents*, established music, expounded the *Yi*, and upheld ritual.\nEverywhere, he enacted the transformative power of the *Spring and Autumn*;\nIn every place, he elucidated the scriptures of filial piety and righteousness.\nHis Dao was transmitted to Zeng and Meng, bearing the weight of a single shoulder;\nHe became the teacher of ten thousand generations of Confucians, the master of instruction for all people.\nHad Zeng and Meng not received the transmission in the Zhou dynasty, had the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi not elucidated and upheld it in the Song, how could we have what we have today?\n\nThe Buddhist gate traces back to the Tathāgata Śākyamuni Buddha of the Western Regions.\nHe practiced austerities on Snow Mountain, relinquished his kingdom and left his family,\nSubdued body and mind, perfected merit and conduct;\nThe five aggregates were empty, the six senses purified.\nHe manifested wondrous forms, transforming and appearing in the ten directions.\nIn the reign of Emperor Ming of Han, a golden man entered his dream.\nThe White Horse came from the West, transmitting 5,048 scrolls—\nThe *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra*—\nThe teachings flowed into the eastern lands.\nHis name was the Tathāgata, the Dharma was transmitted to the Sixth Patriarch.\nVenerating the golden immortals of Brahmanic monasteries,\nThe Mahāyāna’s compassionate and supreme honor.\n\nIf not for our Buddha’s transmission of the scriptures, how could we today universally revere golden bodies and arhats?\n\nThe Daoist gate was established by the Three Pure Ones, vast and indescribable, towering and unfathomable.\nThe scriptures are wondrous and profound, transmitted from sage to sage.\nManifesting bodies to expound the Dharma, polishing the mind through kalpas.\nDelivering beings from the sea of suffering, saving the world through the ages.\nThis is the transmission of the Three Officials, the opening of altars by the Five Poles.\nAncestor Lü of Pure Yang, master of the Three Teachings,\nIssuer of the Five Thunder commands,\nAppearing everywhere, opening the mysteries in every place—\nGreat compassion, great benevolence, great filial piety,\nForsaking fame and merit, leaving behind the incense of practice.\n\nHe transmitted to our Ancestor Qiu, who diligently cultivated the Dao and preserved benevolence,\nBowing to the *Book of the Phoenix* at the imperial palace;\nEstablishing the lineage, transmitting precepts,\nReviving the pure precepts of Dragon Gate.\nThrough a thousand hardships and ten thousand sufferings,\nHe vowed to deliver all beings.\nHonored as the Perfected Lord of Eternal Spring,\nRepeatedly revered as the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Response.\nIlluminating all dharma realms,\nAll equally partake in his vast grace.",

      "translated_text": "When encountering things and facing affairs, each application differs, and every response varies. At every turn, shadows appear; at every moment, traces are lost. Following the wondrous numinous mechanism, layer by layer one delves deeper into realization—yet still, the summit of mystery remains unattainable. The more one moves, the more emerges; drawn without end, used without exhaustion. Those who awaken grasp it for themselves; those who remain deluded drift far away.\n\nFor I fear that once you have glimpsed one or two parts of this principle, you may cling to it and seek further awakening—but if you abandon it to pursue another, you fall into impermanence. You must turn the unchanging, constant numinous mechanism toward the ever-changing, mutable affairs of the world. Then principle becomes clear, nature is revealed, the old is relinquished, the new is embraced, and step by step, layer by layer, you ascend to the heights. If you do not stand firm and independent, how can you penetrate profound mechanisms, illuminate life and death, transcend the mundane world, and sever the roots of doubt across ten thousand kalpas?\n\nWhat is *giving*? It is to offer yesterday’s awakened mechanism, the wondrous principles realized before—whether bestowing them upon sentient beings or storing them within a grain of millet—without retaining them to cloud the numinous terrace. As it is said: the past mind cannot be grasped, the future mind cannot be grasped, and even the present mind cannot be grasped. Yet within this ungraspable, seek the wondrous self-attainment—then the light of wisdom becomes complete.\n\nGiving wealth is called cultivating merit; giving the Dharma is called cultivating wisdom. Material giving has an end, but my teaching, when given, is inexhaustible. Giving wealth sustains worldly dharmas, nourishes the physical form with clothing and food, and adorns external appearances—yet when wealth is spent, one remains empty-handed. My giving of the Dharma serves both worldly and transcendent paths. Through Dharma-giving, one opens the deluded apertures of others and uplifts their spiritual roots.\n\nYet the wealth given is not worldly wealth. When ordinary beings nurture life, save others, relieve distress, aid the imperiled, ward off disasters, govern calamities, bring peace to nations, ensure well-being for the people, harmonize movement and stillness, water and fire, dispel misfortune and resolve adversity—all these acts of manifesting heaven’s transformation, commanding yin and yang, and penetrating heaven and earth with boundless, wondrous power—this is true wealth, the talent of the youth Sudhana, disciple of the Great Being Avalokiteśvara of the Southern Ocean.\n\nAh! Do you know? To seek the treasures of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world. This worldly wealth is not ordinary wealth—it is the Dharma-wealth of self-liberation and liberating others, called the *divine treasure*, which invokes heavenly treasures. In daily practice, it is the giving of the Dharma. Those who awaken to this become the wise ones of primordial wisdom across ten thousand kalpas.\n\nWhat is *loftiness and clarity*? One who can give the wondrous Dharma to liberate sentient beings must possess true discernment, genuine loftiness, and wisdom that thoroughly penetrates. All things between heaven and earth possess this numinous nature. If I take the Dharma as the Dharma, I am attached to the Dharma. Attachment to the Dharma makes it a dead Dharma, not a living one—this is a lack of lofty discernment.\n\nThus, if I impose my own methods to teach others or apply rigid principles to respond to things, it becomes a dead Dharma and a dull mechanism—like fixing a stake to row or gluing the tuning pegs to play the zither. One must not insist that one’s own Dharma is right and others’ wrong. With uprightness and luminosity, one adapts to the moment, seizes opportunities, and expounds with flexibility. If one measures the round with the square, one cannot turn freely. Teaching the foolish with wisdom does not suit the occasion.\n\nOne must assess the foolish and speak their language, making it clear and comprehensible, gauging what they can practice and gradually guiding them toward awakening. If one addresses the wise with the language of the foolish, it is equally unsuited. One must harmonize self and others, refine and vulgar alike, be fluid and adaptable—so the wise see wisdom, the benevolent see benevolence, blockages dissolve, disturbances settle, doubts resolve, the dull become astute, the deaf hear, and the blind see. Only then is one truly lofty and clear, fit to lead the work of salvation.\n\nWhat is *humility*? When true cultivation reaches this point, one encounters those with clear vision—vast in wisdom, empty in heart. All things external to the body, all worldly affairs, become emptiness, emptiness, emptiness. Above, one shakes the gates of heaven; below, one rocks the axis of earth. Transcending the human world, the spirit enters the void.",

      "translated_text": "Where then is there still a sentient being before one’s eyes? From ancient times to the present, the Two Vehicles’ bodhisattvas and the lesser immortals of the lower vehicle have all contracted this affliction—so deeply ingrained they remain unaware. Thus are they called the lesser vehicle’s inferior roots, the heterodox teachings, the deviant paths and demonic arts. If this be so, how could one presume to fix the boundless, to grasp the unfathomable? The Dao has no fixed form; its spiritual transformations are beyond measure. How could you delimit it, seize it? A finite thing—how dare it falsely exalt itself?\n\nHave you not heard that the Most High dares not take precedence in the world? He does not claim blessings first, does not boast of his merits, does not display his Way. Advancement takes retreat as its foundation; loftiness takes humility as its base. By placing the self last, one preserves it; by putting the self behind, one leads. While others vie to be first, I alone withdraw. Supreme virtue does not assert virtue; the noble person does not contend. Seeing yet not perceiving the self, one is neither arrogant nor self-exalting nor self-aggrandizing. The more one gives to others, the more one possesses; the more one benefits others, the more one gains. I know not its name—reluctantly, I call it the Dao. Thus, the higher one’s station, the more one practices humility and withdrawal. Gentleness and yielding preserve the Way of profundity. On the one hand, one universally extends kindness and wisdom; on the other, one conserves one’s radiance. A state’s sharpest weapon must not be shown to others. If I do not seek to subdue others, others will naturally submit.\n\nAt this stage, one must comprehend the principle of liberation. What is liberation? Disciples, those who cling fail to understand the Dao and virtue. Unfettered and at ease, untangled by dharmas; bare and unburdened, unencumbered by things. Perfectly round, adapting teachings to circumstances; radiantly luminous, delivering beings across kalpas. Entering the gate of all wonders, becoming the mother of sentient beings. Compassion loves beings, yet does not take loving beings as compassion; goodness aids others, yet does not take aiding others as goodness. The wondrous Dharma delivers sentient beings, yet does not take delivering beings as the wondrous Dharma; the supreme Dao transcends the world, yet does not take transcending the world as the supreme Dao. One can both escape suffering and endure suffering. Above, one may ascend beyond heaven, yet does not regard the celestial palaces as realms of joy; below, one may universally save those in hell, yet does not regard hell as a place of torment. Encountering suffering, one rescues others from it; encountering joy, one shares it with all. In joy, one points out the suffering of beings; in adversity, one reveals their joy. In heaven, one delivers dragons, ghosts, and spirits, enabling them to hear the true awakening and attain transcendental immortal arts; on earth, one delivers sin-laden departed souls, allowing the lost to see the light and be reborn in the human realm. In the world of humans, one delivers all good men and faithful women, universally cultivating the ordinary and everyday—effortless integrity, loyalty, trustworthiness, fairness, and the great Way of virtue. One does not guide scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants into the lesser vehicles’ petty teachings, manipulating spirits and souls, falling into demonic paths, or waging the wars of asuras.\n\nWithin this liberation, one must attain the function of spontaneity—this is the Dao of self-mastery. What is spontaneity? Disciples, this wondrous spontaneity is as the *Heart Sutra* states: Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, the Perceiver of the World’s Sounds, perceiving the sounds of the world. Attaining the wondrous spontaneity, one becomes the Self-Mastered Perceiver of Sounds—this bodhisattva in one’s own heart, the Guanyin of the Southern Sea. One perceives the wondrous forms of the other shore’s pure emptiness, the principle of effortless void. One can perceive the wondrous forms of the true sound. Without a true teacher’s guidance, could one awaken to the wondrous forms of true emptiness?\n\nAh, disciples! Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; neither emptiness nor form, the Dao is not true. The true emptiness’ wondrous forms are the everlasting Dao; neither empty nor formed, wondrous and boundless. One with the vast void, the void and that are undivided. Entering metal and stone without obstruction, entering water and fire unharmed.\n\nDisciples, you must carefully contemplate the nine essentials of the Dao, steadfastly uphold the humble meditation cushion, awaken to all wondrous forms, align with spontaneity. The Three Teachings have already borne witness; universally delivering beings, one’s merit is immeasurable, virtue subdues ghosts and spirits, demons and evil spirits are rendered powerless, and malevolent forces lose their vigor. What worry is there that the world will not believe and take refuge?\n\nJust so—universal deliverance, meritorious deeds, and the mind of beneficence. Diligently cultivate the self before delivering others. With sincere resolve toward the true and everlasting Dao, the bodhisattvas will naturally protect your practice. The ninefold wondrous scripture transcends the mundane world; its profound truth is deeply refined. Dispensing subtle words of true wondrous principle, dual cultivation of nature and life without shirking hardship. With discerning wisdom, expound the Dharma abundantly; with gentle humility, do not boast of ability. Abandoning external appearances, forget self and other; the true and thusness of heaven’s heart, the great Dao in motion. Carefree and liberated, expounding the profound; the supreme true emptiness, the mysterious and abstruse Dao. The small fire harms not the union of the three families; with merit perfected and conduct fulfilled, one ascends the clouds.\n\nThe eighteen wisdoms’ radiance—disciples, having received the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Middle Realm, upholding secret conduct and subtle deportment, you are no longer as in the days of the initial true precepts. These precepts are subtle and profound; one must apply effort in the heart’s core. In every arising thought, one must maintain sincerity and reverence, silently examining, reflecting, and scrutinizing—upright in the great mean. Sweep the mind’s thoughts clean and pure, like the azure sky’s bright moon, without a trace of cloud; like crystal and lapis lazuli, without the slightest flaw; like a boundless bright mirror, without a speck of dust; like a luminous pearl, without a thread of darkness. Perfectly stable, radiantly luminous—only then can one discourse on the Dao. The radiance of wisdom, the wondrous forms of true emptiness, originally arise from precepts and concentration.",

      "translated_text": "Through forbearance, one severs obstructions; through the strictest observance of precepts, through self-mastery and tempering—coupled with the aid of dharma and elixirs—only then can one attain this state. If one merely holds the precepts yet rarely upholds them, practicing cultivation with subtle precision and rigor, deceiving and deluding oneself, one will never achieve cessation. Why is this so? Alas, disciples, laxity in practice is called a \"leaky cause\"—how can it yield the fruit of the unconditioned?\n\nThis phrase, \"the radiance of wisdom,\" belongs to the superior vehicle and keen roots. Thus, those of the inferior vehicle and dull roots, unable to awaken and enter, must instead focus the will without distraction, concentrate the spirit in the qi cavity, nurture the ancestral qi, and cultivate the primordial—attaining utmost emptiness, guarding profound stillness, maintaining absolute singleness, and concealing the spirit in the boundless. When this reaches its extreme, the Supreme Ultimate arises, and the radiance of wisdom naturally emerges; the first yang returns, and one beholds the original face.\n\nTo know the conditions of ghosts and spirits, to penetrate the pivot of creation—this is called *zhi* (wisdom). To assist in heaven and earth’s transformative nurturance, to alternate brilliance with the sun and moon, to harmonize with the four seasons’ cyclical movements—this is called *hui* (insight). To universally manifest the Dharma-body, to encompass the Dharma-realm without straying beyond awakened illumination, to wholly return within luminous clarity—this is called *guang* (radiance). To pervade all things without form, to perceive all affairs before their signs, to traverse empty space without trace, to surpass the sun and moon without shadow—this is called *ming* (luminosity).\n\nIf precepts are not observed with meticulous precision, one cannot attain profound stability. Without profound stability, wisdom does not arise. Without wisdom, radiance does not manifest.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Precious Sutra* in one scroll directly reveals the original nature, pointing straight to the human mind. The nature’s truth is made manifest, and the celestial mechanism is fully unveiled, enabling sentient beings to turn the sutra and awaken to the Dao. Yet, alas, the deluded are many, and the awakened are few. The mouth recites in vain while the heart fails to uphold; the heart may be sincere, yet the strength cannot turn. How pitiful—betraying the sagely intent, vainly pointing to the Dharma-treasure.\n\nNow, I cannot but expound the sutra’s wonders on its behalf, revealing the true mechanism to guide you, disciples, into sudden awakening. Each of you, with reverence and wholehearted attention, listen closely.\n\nThe sutra states: *\"Long ago, fifteen kalpas past, my heart encountered this Dao, and I ascended to the rank of Upper Perfected. My intent refined this merit, and I wielded the power of great transformation.\"* It further says: *\"With a pure and still heart, one vows boundlessly; with the power of wisdom, one subdues all demons.\"* And: *\"You, gods and humans, desire to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profound and distant—it lies nowhere else. If you wish to hear it, the uninterrupted is it. Uninterrupted and unseen, this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing dissolve—only you remain. You are not even ‘you,’ let alone the Dao. To hear without hearing—what Dao can be spoken?\"*\n\nIt also says: *\"The Dao is entered through sincerity, guarded through silence, and employed through softness. Using sincerity appears foolish; using silence appears inarticulate; using softness appears clumsy. Only thus can one forget form, forget the self, and forget even forgetting. Those who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who guard the Dao know caution; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, the radiance of insight arises; knowing caution, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, profound stability is secure. With profound stability secure, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, the radiance of insight arises; with the radiance of insight arising, one becomes one with the Dao. This is called true forgetting. Only in forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten—this is the supreme Dao. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know it not. Sentient and insentient—all is one, without duality.\"*\n\nIt further states: *\"Those who attain awakening ascend to the immortal’s throne.\"* And: *\"The foolish can become wise, the turbid can become clear—this is commanded by fate. The foolish are dull, the turbid are dark—these are shifts in endowment from wind and earth. Heaven and earth wield their mechanism, causing people to remain unaware—this is called ‘natural.’ If they know what they do not know, this too is called ‘natural.’ The marvel of the natural, though marvelous in knowing, is marvelous precisely in not knowing. Yet regarding the Dao, there has never been foolishness or turbidity.\"*\n\nFinally, it says: *\"All that has been proclaimed—when the noble receive the sutra, they must dig for gold to offer as tribute, swearing before heaven to transmit it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Disciples, this is the true and profound mystery of the *Jade Pivot Sutra*—the supreme, inconceivable Dharma treasure of pure stillness, liberation, and the most subtle and wondrous upper grade. You merely recite the sutra day after day yet have never grasped its wondrous essence. If, when you recite and uphold it, you awaken to the secret key within, you become complete in sagely wisdom, and the light of insight arises.\n\nThe profound Dao spoken of is deep and obscure, beyond sight and sound. Had the Heavenly Worthy not, fifteen hundred kalpas ago, opened the mind of pure stillness and vowed with boundless resolve to deliver all beings to the ultimate mystery, none could have attained it. The Dao’s root is emptiness and nothingness—no sound to be heard, no form to be seen. Since no sound may be heard, forget the ear; since no form may be seen, forget the eye. When ear and eye are forgotten, hearing and seeing too dissolve. For ear and eye, being formed and colored, lead the six senses; hearing and seeing, clinging to appearances and thoughts, are the very source of the six senses. How could they accord with the Dao?\n\nIf one can purify the six senses and sweep away the six consciousnesses, then the ear that does not listen hears with the heart, and the eye that does not see perceives with spirit. Thus, one hears without listening and sees without looking. Without hearing or seeing, one merges with the Dao. The *Ancient Sutra of the Crimson Text* states: *\"Forget the eye, and light overflows without limit; forget the ear, and the mind’s awareness abides in profound depth. When both mechanisms are forgotten, one enters the gate of all wonders. Seeing yet not seeing the self, hearing yet not grasping sound—transcending all extremes, this is called the wondrous Dao.\"* The *Nanhua Sutra* says: *\"Qi halts at the ear, the mind halts at the tally.\"*\n\nThus, the *Jade Pivot Sutra* teaches: *\"Forget form, forget self—this is the mechanism of entering the Dao.\"* One enters through sincerity—this sincerity is precept-keeping. One guards through silence—this silence is the taming of body and mind through precepts. To be silent as if mute is to enter samadhi, forgetting ear and eye. To be yielding as if clumsy is to inwardly conceal wisdom in secrecy.\n\nIt further states: *\"If you seek within your own bodily form for hearing and seeing, you will never see or hear.\"* The *Diamond Sutra* says: *\"Those who seek me through form or sound walk the wrong path and cannot see the Tathagata.\"*\n\nThose who wish to enter the Dao must only receive the precepts, enter samadhi, and secretly cultivate wisdom, transforming delusion into clarity. Then, though not hearing and not seeing, they hear and see. Thus, those who enter the Dao know stillness—this is the practice of precept-keeping to still thoughts; they know reverence—this is the practice of vigilance in solitude and diligent progress; they know subtlety—this is the practice of transcending sageliness and abandoning cunning.\n\nStillness of thought cannot be achieved without precepts; vigilance in solitude cannot be achieved without samadhi; subtlety cannot be achieved without wisdom. If one truly upholds precepts, enters samadhi, and cultivates wisdom, body and mind become serene, sagely wisdom becomes complete, and the light of insight shines universally. When the light of insight penetrates fully, one unites with the Dao—this is called true forgetting. This true forgetting is not the empty stillness of sitting in dull vacuity but true emptiness. Within this true emptiness, a wondrous purple-golden form appears—the marvelous fruit of emptiness that is not empty.\n\nTo avoid falling into dull emptiness and to realize emptiness that is not empty is to allow the essential mystery to manifest naturally. Only when forgetting is without what to forget, and what is forgotten is the ultimate, wondrous Dao.\n\nIt is also said: Foolishness and wisdom differ, as do purity and turbidity. Though these arise from uneven endowments of wind and earth, they are all the workings of creation’s mechanism, the natural movement of qi and destiny, fixed by fate. Yet the foolish remain foolish, and the wise remain wise—how could heaven and earth be blamed for making the foolish wise? Only by arousing the mind of pure stillness and establishing the vast vow—vowing to leave the world to deliver others—can one hear the Dao and attain self-deliverance.\n\nThose who attain self-deliverance take refuge in the Three Jewels, receive the precepts, enter samadhi, and cultivate wisdom to radiate light. Then the foolish may become wise, and the turbid may become clear. But without upholding precepts, entering samadhi, or penetrating wisdom, no light shines—then the clear may become turbid, and the wise may become foolish. The *Diamond Sutra* says: *\"The Dharma I teach is originally without fixed Dharma.\"* This is what it means.\n\nThe wisdom and light spoken of shine brilliantly upon the Great Mystery, illuminating the Dharma realm—how could they lie beyond the *Jade Pivot Treasure Sutra*? The Jade Pivot is the true mechanism. Those who wish to transmit the sutra must first turn the true mechanism, secretly cultivating merit and wisdom. Yet if the light remains hidden, one cannot open or see it. How then could one perceive the forms of ghosts and spirits, grasp the pivot of creation, participate in heaven and earth’s transformations, direct the movements of sun and moon, contain the Dharma realm within a mustard seed, stabilize all things at their unmanifest beginning, be called a master of the wondrous Dao, and ascend to the realm of heavenly immortals?\n\nJust so:\n*Seeing the treasury of light, one hears the root of the supreme Dao.\nWithout cultivating precepts and samadhi, how could wisdom’s light run deep?\nClinging to appearances is not the true form—only by forgetting hearing can one truly hear.\nHearing, contemplating, and cultivating enter the mystery, freely as the ocean’s tide.*\n\n**The Nineteen Wondrous Functions of Supernormal Powers**\n\nDisciples, the path of wisdom and light spoken of above—the *Jade Pivot Sutra* merely teaches the dissolution of hearing and seeing. Without hearing or seeing, the wondrous functions are fully expounded, and supernormal powers manifest. Disciples, the *Yinfu Sutra* says: *\"The deaf see seeing, the blind see hearing.\"* The ancient immortals said: *\"In stillness, one hears not the thunder’s roar; in clarity, one sees not Mount Tai.\"* The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: *\"The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is! Seen yet not seen, heard yet not heard.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Nanhua Sutra* states: *\"See not, hear not—embrace the spirit in stillness.\"* The *Cantong Qi* says: *\"Ear, eye, and mouth are the three treasures; close and seal them, let no passage open. The true person dives deep into the abyss, floating and roaming yet abiding within the compass.\"* In all the scriptures, the wondrous words spoken are beyond enumeration.\n\nThe Great Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, through hearing, contemplation, and cultivation, entered *samādhi*. The ear-root is the aperture through which essence leaks—not the essence of post-natal fleeting desires, but the *qi* of primordial Taiyi, the essence of true origin manifesting in response. If one listens inwardly and seals their hearing, essence does not scatter, and wisdom is born. The eye is the aperture through which spirit leaks—not the spirit of post-natal deliberation, but the innate luminous awareness of *liangzhi*, the primal spirit of nebulous *taisu*. If one gazes inwardly and returns their vision, spirit does not wander outward, and insight is born.\n\nBy upholding precepts and entering concentration, wisdom arises. With wisdom, water and fire intermingle. When water and fire intermingle, *kan* and *li* unite. When *kan* and *li* unite, Heaven and Earth are in harmony. When Earth and Heaven are in harmony, metal and wood merge. When metal and wood merge, *hun* and *po* converge. When *hun* and *po* converge, essence and *qi* transform. When essence and *qi* transform, supernormal powers manifest. When supernormal powers manifest, radiance shines forth. When radiance shines forth, merit is perfected. When merit is perfected, the *Dharmakāya* is realized. When the *Dharmakāya* is realized, the Dao-body is revealed. When the Dao-body is revealed, wondrous functions operate. When wondrous functions operate, beings are delivered. When beings are delivered, vows are fulfilled. When vows are fulfilled, the great task is complete. When the great task is complete, the fruit of realization is attained.\n\nThis is the One Vehicle; the other two are not true. From beginning to end, it does not depart from the word *sincerity*. The *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Without sincerity, there is nothing.\"* That \"nothing\" is the *huang* and *hu*—within it lies something; the *yao* and *ming*—within it lies essence. Its essence is most true, and within it lies *trust*. *Trust* is sincerity, which is the *Book of Changes*’ *\"essence and qi become things\"* and the *Great Learning*’s *\"things are investigated.\"* *Essence* is the *Shangshu*’s *\"refined unity.\"* *Middle* is the *\"centrality\"* of *jue zhong*. The *Lotus Sutra* says: *\"There is a treasure hidden within the mountain of form; the sage uses it to purify the heart and withdraw, concealing it in secrecy.\"* All are none other than this. First conceal it, then it is seen.\n\nAn ancient song says: *\"If this heart holds not a single thing, before your eyes is the time of Fuxi.\"* Then what need is there for supernormal powers or wondrous functions? What need for wisdom and light? These supernormal powers and wondrous functions are the true person who guards the Dao through precepts, manifesting to teach and deliver beings, gathering delusion to return to truth—this is their wondrous function.\n\nThus, within the radiance of great wisdom, the golden arm of insight extends, rescuing all beings, lifting them from suffering and affliction into purity and stillness. It can grant longevity to those with short lives, transform calamity into peace and joy. It brings about the tranquility of lands and the preservation of life. It makes beings pure and upright, dispelling demons and evil, driving away violence and rebellion, eradicating malevolent spirits. It makes beings compassionate, refraining from killing or harming life. It can protect beings from the turning of kalpas, dissolving karmic knots and grievances. It can shatter the darkness of ignorance, revealing light. It can heal all illnesses, dispelling chronic ailments. It can turn foolishness into wisdom, guiding beings to return to rightness and abandon evil. It can curb desires, purify the heart, gather emotions to return to nature. It can bring liberation without hindrance, transcending the mundane to enter sagehood. It can accumulate blessings, dispel misfortune, generate auspiciousness, and eradicate transgressions. It can lead beings to transcend the world, leave suffering, and ascend to truth. It can enable the cultivation of the supreme vehicle, ascending to heaven, universally guiding beings to roam the eight directions, surpassing celestial palaces.\n\nMay all beings in their ordinary forms become the bodies of Dharma Kings—so unfathomable that it is called *supernormal power*. Its mechanism is not revealed to the world, and thus it is called *wondrous function*. Therefore, the supernormal powers of the precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the *power that is not supernormal*, transforming the six senses into the six penetrations—penetrating heaven, earth, spirits, ghosts, humans, and things—this is called *supernormal power*. This wondrous function, though without wondrousness, operates one mechanism to display myriad transformations. Transforming heavenly demons, earthly malevolent stars, myriad ghosts, evil persons, and monstrous beings—this is called *wondrous function*.\n\nWithin the gate of precepts and concentration, entering stillness, the light of concentration and wisdom arises—the luminous auspicious sign of the primordial unified *qi*. Above, it connects to the celestial palaces, paying homage to the ancestral *qi* above the Three Purities. Below, it reaches the underworld, absolving the sins of souls in the nine springs. When the Dharma is expounded, celestial deities are subdued, the Five Emperors attend in state, myriad spirits stand guard in solemn array, desiring to hear the true Dharma and refine the spirit to return to emptiness. Having attained liberation, with compassionate heart and merciful intent, they relieve the suffering of the cold and forsaken. The *Jingluo* praises and extols, Earth Treasury illuminates, ghostly judges comply, and the underworld is subdued. Sins are absolved, beings are reborn, they hear the true Dharma, escape the ghostly register, and all turn toward the Land of Bliss.\n\nThus, self-deliverance leads to delivering others. Great vows are made: may all beings universally hear the supreme Dao, and may the medicine of the Dharma universally save all beings. May all beings, even the crawling and moving, the sensitive and the insensate, together attain liberation. Even earth, wood, tiles, and stones may receive its resonance. All things and emotions are thoroughly penetrated. Supernormal powers operate in the unknowing and unaware, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things are within this body. Wondrous functions arise naturally, and mountains, rivers, and stars return to the Dharma. Heavenly demons all bow in reverence, lowering their heads in welcome. Earthly malevolent stars transform into kindness and harmony, submitting with respectful hearts. Fierce and malevolent ghosts, upon hearing the transformation, ascend beyond, forever forsaking blood offerings. *Asuras* and external paths submit to the Dharma and return to rightness.",

      "translated_text": "War forever ceases, wrongs are all redressed, and enmities dissolve. Through virtue one transforms, not by force one subdues—thus the wicked all become good; through sincerity one moves, not by artifice one oppresses—thus the perverse all turn upright. Inverting the Dipper’s handle to wield yin and yang, even spirits and ghosts cannot fathom it; reversing the mechanism of transformation to transcend the world, even heaven and earth remain unaware. Universally manifesting numinous clarity, the Dharma-body stands firm, yet no form can be perceived. Broadly proclaiming the supreme vehicle’s singular wondrous Dharma, yet no sound can be heard. The void is my Dharma-realm, and I am the Dharma-body of the void. Vast and boundless, one with heaven as a single body; upright and majestic, one with immortals and buddhas in a single heart. As Master Cheng said: *\"Unfurled, it fills the six directions; rolled up, it retreats into secrecy.\"* This is precisely what is meant.\n\nThey are called the parents of all beings, the Dharma-teachers of the Daoist gate. Are these not the divine powers of purity and liberation, the wondrous functions of non-action and spontaneity? Disciples, if you do not cling to appearances, wisdom flows boundlessly; if you follow heaven’s natural course, wondrous functions are inexhaustible. It lies only in the daily and ordinary, never neglected, even in haste or urgency—nothing more than the two words *virtue* and *Dao*. Why then abandon precepts to study talismanic arts, or forsake jade to covet mere jasper? Would you willingly remain among the unwise, refusing to learn the supreme vehicle’s Way?\n\nAlas! Disciples entering the mystery-gate, seek the supreme vehicle. Every person contains a wondrous aperture, each one radiates luminosity. Yet due to myriad obstructions, they regard precepts as empty formalities. Even if one upholds them intermittently, vacillation ensures no depth. When concentration deepens and vows are earnest, neither attachment nor forgetfulness serves as the rule. Uphold them ceaselessly in every moment of the twelve double-hours, for three to five years without lapse. When concentration is forgotten and precepts become second nature, spiritual communion arises spontaneously—true wondrous functions emerge from this communion.\n\nWielding divine powers, attaining wondrous functions, disciples must rely on sincere progress. If one foolishly clings to appearances in pursuit, the ghostly den becomes one’s path—no true course. External paths and side doors dwell in form; clinging to emptiness or abiding in form is not true cultivation. Neither cling to emptiness nor to form: in concentration, no form arises; in resonance, communion is achieved. In application, spirit becomes luminously distinct—how many Daoists lose the central work!\n\nI do not speak idly now—hark!—I reveal the celestial mechanism outright. Divine powers manifest, wondrous functions shine forth: the great Dharma-king coils through earth and sky. Not departing from the ever-quiet true and constant Dao, demonic teachings submit in reverence, and evil transforms into goodness. Disobedience one morning yields to filial piety; the stubborn and fierce all become kind and harmonious. Wisdom like a mirror, insight like a spirit—one’s luminous platform shines resplendently. The six penetrations intermingle without trace of dust; the great earth and mountains and rivers all turn to gold.\n\nDisciples, do not grow lax in upholding precepts—this is the heavenly ladder, step by step ascending. The divine is unfathomable, the wondrous immeasurable, yet they never depart from precepts, concentration, and the true and constant. Within the gate of Suchness lies a celestial aperture; within the Hall of Non-Duality, sacred fragrance issues forth. Disciples, cultivate sincerely and do not abandon yourselves—since ancient times, this has been the great Dao-field of immortals and sages.\n\n**Twenty: Awakening to Life and Death**\nDisciples, from ancient times to now, sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—all for the great matter of causation—faced the wall for nine years, solely to pursue life and death, to transcend the world and subdue the mind. Have you not heard? Like sparks from stone or lightning’s flash, like fallen blossoms or flowing water—when impermanence arrives, not a moment can be retained. Sin and fortune follow the body, and in the wheel of rebirth, one receives retribution. Before words are finished, the breath in the throat ceases; before speech is complete, the tongue retracts, and no sound can be made. Naked and alone, where can one find refuge? Dark and boundless, who can establish destiny? With great fortune, one returns to the human realm; with evil karma, one falls into Fengdu. When fortune is exhausted, one re-enters the wheel; when karma is complete, one is reborn as an animal. For ten thousand kalpas, karmic entanglements are hard to escape; for a thousand lives, sinful deeds cannot be worn away. Lifetime after lifetime, sunk in delusion, living as if drunk or dreaming. Mutual retribution, wearing horns and fur. To speak of it is grievous and lamentable; to recount it is pitiful and terrifying.\n\nIf one does not firmly resolve and hold fast to innate goodness, overturning earth and sky to awaken to what comes after death; if one does not risk life and limb to thoroughly see through the myriad delusions of past lives—then, should one encounter a resolute person, brows raised and demon-slaying sword in hand; truly a great person, with vast qi unleashed, wielding the sharp blade of rectitude to sever evil from the heart—one must see through to the state before parents gave birth: where was one’s destiny established? Investigate thoroughly the workings of creation from the very root. After death, where does one find refuge? Awaken to the three bodies—past, future, and present. Pursue the three worlds as if they were yesterday; tomorrow becomes this morning.\n\nThus, let all cares vanish, leaving only this single point of luminous spirit. Sweep away all conditions, preserving only that small measure of wisdom-nature. Enter the mysterious pass: when one aperture opens, a hundred apertures open. Perceive the true source: the three times become clear, and the three realms are transcended. In liberation, the five phases are unobstructed; in emptiness, the four great elements dissolve. Enter the gate of myriad wonders, ascend the ground of the Three Treasures—coming and going freely, transforming without limit. Gently turning the celestial mechanism, even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom its wonder; majestically inverting the Dipper’s handle, even yin and yang cannot control its power. Roaming freely in the vastness of Brahma’s qi, attaining the position of pure emptiness and boundlessness. Forever leaving the dust and kalpas, transcending the cage of existence.\n\nThe great matter of the Perfected is accomplished. Step by step, the great path is traversed; without cultivating right and wrong, one swiftly arrives. This wondrous Dharma-body of subtle existence is entirely obtained through wisdom’s aperture. Secretly practicing each step of the work, how could one not awaken and achieve fulfillment?\n\nDisciples! The Dao is transmitted by sages, but cultivation lies with oneself.",

It is like knocking at a gate with a golden brick—the gate remains unopened, yet the golden brick is still there. If one cultivates precepts and the Dao but does not awaken, the precepts and cultivation remain intact, and one will not sink into the netherworld, but will ultimately be reborn in the world of light. Past causes are not obscured, and fruition naturally manifests; merely overturning a small part, one still holds a handle in hand.\n\nDisciples!

Though I now speak at length, it amounts to no method at all. If you embody the heart in this way, you will find that principle yourself. Investigate death within life, awaken to death within life—this mechanism of life and death turns on the path you yourself traverse; it is up to you, not up to me. Seek stillness within movement, find movement within stillness—thus the subtleties of movement and stillness are entirely illuminated by the inner light of innate knowledge. The heart can be questioned, but the teacher cannot. Remember my words well, and you will not go astray. If you do not follow what I say, you will ultimately fall into error and delay.",

      "translated_text": "The vastness of empty space—within this gate of precepts and concentration lies the ladder to heaven. The boundless sea of suffering—within this radiance of wisdom lies the vessel to cross the ocean. If you do not stride forward with resolve, how can you traverse the ninety thousand miles of the journey? If you do not straighten your spine and press on, how can you hear the true Dharma through a hundred thousand kalpas?\n\nShould your steps falter or your will waver, how can your merit be perfected or your virtue fulfilled? Disciples, let not a single thought leak from your minds, and the primordial qi within your bodies will naturally suffuse and harmonize. When your virtue subdues gods and spirits, only then may you escape the retribution of rebirth. When the Dao pervades heaven and earth, only then may you transcend the path of life and death.\n\nAscend the shore of the Dao, and with a turn of the body, you are home. Plunge into the profound and subtle, and in the blink of an eye, you return to your original nature. Disciples! Who among you abides in deathlessness? Who has witnessed eternal life? The deathless is no mortal form; the long-lived is not bound to shape or substance. Where now is Pengzu? Does Yanzi endure through ten thousand kalpas? The deathless is my Dharma-body; the long-lived is my primordial qi.\n\nEven the Tathāgata has his time of extinction, entering the realm of Nirvana. Even Laozi had his day of ascension, soaring beyond the Great Scarlet Heaven. Where the Dao abides, there the person abides; where the Dharma is present, there the body is present. To die yet not forget is true longevity—an indestructible nameless name enduring through ten million kalpas. To live yet not cling to form is true embodiment—an unblemished formless form persisting through a hundred generations.\n\nOf the immeasurable sages like grains of sand in the Ganges, which one did not pass through this mysterious gate? Of the countless, inconceivable Buddhas and immortals, which one did not traverse this great path? Yet the bright and clear celestial thoroughfare confounds the deluded, who doubt and disbelieve. The pure and tranquil Buddha-realm remains obscured to the unenlightened, whose hindrances are hard to remove. Alas, their blessings are meager and their sins profound—though they have eyes, they are no better than the blind.\n\nMany are bound by deep karmic debts, though alive, they are already counted among the dead. Their flesh walks and their corpses move, yet they differ from beasts only in speech. They sleep by day and slumber by night, yet fall short even of plants, which at least stand tall with branches outstretched. When their allotted days are spent and the ghosts come to summon them, what does it matter if they are perfected Daoists? A single misstep is recorded in the ledger of sins, and they are judged as the wicked and unvirtuous.\n\nDisciples! All must die, but strive to die well—pure and clean, unburdened, coming and going freely without constraint. All must disperse, but seek to disperse with wonder—lucid and untrammeled, transforming with effortless mastery. Before turning away, bid farewell to all. When the hour arrives, release your grip and go. Naked as a newborn, a radiant aura of auspicious light streams from your crown. Round and perfect, your wondrous form ascends, while in midair, colored clouds and white cranes soar. Amidst such celestial visions, your primordial spirit returns to the void. A cascade of auspicious light carries your true bones to the grotto-realm.\n\nThe great man’s work is complete! He leaves behind an immortal name among men and bequeaths a scripture of the Dao to the world. Thus, for a hundred generations to come, they will know of his existence—this is what it means to \"die yet not perish\" and be called long-lived. For ten thousand kalpas hence, his Dao will spread—this is the body of perfect fulfillment, great merit, and boundless blessing.\n\nDisciples, life and destiny lie within yourselves—none can bequeath them to you. If you do not cultivate, none can cultivate in your stead. The arising and ceasing of thoughts—none can grasp them for you. Deluded desires and selfish impulses—none can sweep them away for you. Deep attachments—none can relinquish them for you. The formless Dharma-body—none can recognize it for you. Precepts and regulations—none can practice them for you. Afflictions and ignorance—none can extinguish them for you. Worldly habits—none can dissolve them for you. Countless hindrances—none can remove them for you. Sacred words and wondrous Dharma—none can uphold them for you. Karmic consequences of sin and blessing—none can believe them for you. Mundane thoughts and worldly attitudes—none can forget them for you. Aspirations bound to form—none can empty them for you. Heterodox paths—none can discern them for you. Illusory constructs—none can penetrate them for you. Matters and things—none can master them for you. Realms and states—none can transcend them for you. Perfected masters—none can seek them for you. The vast Dao of empty space—none can enter it for you. In this lifetime, none can liberate you. Your initial vows and resolve—none can fulfill them for you.\n\nDisciples, why is this so? It is because your arrogance and self-importance make you unteachable. Kind words and gentle admonitions cannot reach you. Doubt and disbelief render you unreachable. Heavy sins and deep karma cannot be uprooted. Anger and slander cannot be stilled. Flattery and praise cannot sway you. Fierce temper and rage cannot be subdued. Cunning schemes and treachery cannot be abandoned. Earnest counsel falls on deaf ears. Delusion and madness cannot be shattered. Blind and sightless, you cannot be enlightened. Reckless and unruly, you cannot be restrained. Sickness and suffering cannot be healed. Misfortune and calamity cannot be absolved. Fate and kalpas spare no one. The retribution of rebirth cannot be evaded. The laws of men and the punishments of the unseen cannot be avoided. The sword trees and blade mountains cannot be turned aside. The compassionate raft of wisdom cannot ferry you. The wondrous elixir of the golden pill cannot be bestowed upon you. Though celestial secrets exist, they cannot transform you. Though divine powers abound, they cannot liberate you.\n\nDisciples, only when you truly endure hardship and discipline, steadfastly upholding the precepts without transgression, seeking the One within concentration, and maintaining unwavering sincerity—only then will you truly turn your hearts toward the Dao. Disciples, turn your hearts toward the Dao, and repentance will naturally wash you clean.",

Yet consider this: when father and son ascend the mountain, the father cannot transmit to the son, nor can the son take the father’s place. Fellow cultivators may walk the same path, but each knows their own warmth and cold, each advances or retreats on their own. Thus, in expounding the Dharma, there is not a single fixed method—only prescribing medicine according to the illness, dispensing remedies according to the symptoms. Once the illness is cured and the symptoms dispelled, there is no need for further prescriptions or medicine. It is like crossing a river by boat: once ashore, one should not long for the vessel again. Or like threading a needle to sew clothes: once the stitching is done, there is no need to seek needle and thread further. Do not draw legs on a snake or pull grass to find a snake.\n\nOnly strive forward with earnest effort, holding fast to the precepts with unwavering discipline. Forget the precepts within the precepts, add discipline beyond discipline—when the work deepens and the firing time is ripe, the ancestral masters will naturally lift and guide you to communion with the true. Never waver without resolve, leaning on the master or relying on fellow cultivators, clinging to names and forms, blindly following others’ footsteps year after year. You must steel your resolve, free of doubt, wholeheartedly and without regret—even unto death. When the firing time is complete, have you not heard that Heaven does not fail the earnest?\n\nThe Great Dao is still and unmoving; when one resonates with it, communion is achieved. Disciples, if you can resolve with fervent hearts, pressing forward without hesitation, advancing without turning back, your aspirations will be lofty and far-reaching—you will be the seeds of the Dao-gate.

      "translated_text": "\"Twenty-Second Inquiry into the Primal Mechanism\n\nDisciples, this single point of empty clarity that never fades—this is the true person of your original destiny. Is it so easily seen? From ancient times to the present, sages, worthies, immortals, buddhas, patriarchs, and hosts of perfected beings have faced walls for nine years, sat in meditation for six, practiced thrice seven and seven thrice, enduring hardship in their inquiries. They have traversed famous mountains, wandered blessed lands, sought masters, visited friends, asked about the Dao, listened to sutras, engaged in ascetic practices, and accumulated virtue through almsgiving. All such cultivation is but for this body’s great matter of life, death, and destiny—knowing neither whence it comes nor whither it goes, drifting and drowning, unable to escape rebirth. Thus they vow oaths and establish merit through conduct.\n\nSome, taking the cessation of thought and forgetting of emotion as the method of liberation, sit in meditation for three or five years, wearing out countless meditation cushions—yet when has a single thought ceased, or a moment’s emotion been forgotten? This is but the return of duality to unity.\n\nOthers, taking the refinement of lead and mercury as the method of liberation, practice the firing process from *zhun* to *meng*, advancing the talisman and withdrawing the fire—yet when have they seen the sevenfold return of jade liquid or the ninefold return of golden liquid? They seize the thief only to release him.\n\nSome engage in visualization and contemplation, silently paying homage to the Emperor in the Three Heavens. Others refine and deliver the suffering, liberating lost souls from the Nine Hells. Some summon spirits and command generals, wearing talismans to proclaim themselves perfected beings. Others guide qi to open the gates, circulating essence and qi to claim mastery of the wondrous Dao. Some recite scriptures and perform devout prostrations; others prepare elixirs to heal sickness and cure sores. Some refine and consume medicinal foods in hopes of ascending; others emulate yin and yang to practice absorption. Some, in crucibles and bellows, breathe to circulate true lead and extend life; others, in furnaces of cinnabar and fire, add and withdraw to refine *maogen*, establishing merit through almsgiving. Some, their bodies withered and broken, cling to the Way of the Golden Elixir, awaiting transmission by fortunate heirs; others, their karmic conditions shallow, practice the most arduous deeds only to let go at the precipice.\n\nAll such deluded cultivation, mistaking illusion for reality, is but side doors.\n\nDisciples, to cease thought and forget emotion, you must first inquire: Where does thought arise? From whence does emotion come? Only when you can grasp it firmly, press it steadily, recognize it truly, and point to it accurately may you then proceed to cease it, proceed to forget it. But I ask you: What is this that grasps, seizes, recognizes, points, acts, ceases thought, and forgets emotion? No matter how you cease thought and forget emotion, no matter how many cushions you wear out in meditation, thought remains thought, and emotion remains emotion.\n\nAssembly, to cease thought with thought is like adding a head atop a head; to forget emotion with emotion is like seizing a thief only to release him. Far better to forget even the method of forgetting emotion, to cease even the method of ceasing thought—both mechanisms forgotten, entering the gate of manifold wonders. Only then is it the supreme principle.\n\nDisciples, when I use a method to cease thought, I do not realize that the method itself is but another thought; when I use a method to forget emotion, I do not realize that the method itself is but another seed of emotion. Assembly, ceasing thought is not as good as thought ceasing itself; forgetting emotion is not as good as emotion forgetting itself. This is what is meant by ‘seeking others is not as good as seeking oneself.’\n\nDisciples, those who refine lead and mercury, who add and withdraw fire, who emulate hexagrams and lines—all pierce and break apart the Supreme Ultimate of Chaos. They mistake false names for true use, take metaphors for actual practice. They recklessly discuss the Three Fields, blindly guess at essence and qi, manipulate the mechanisms of the Seven Emotions, and the pivot of the Nine Orifices. They take the characters for ‘seven’ and ‘nine,’ ‘return’ and ‘reversion,’ to mean seven or nine *times*, seven or nine *cycles*, seven or nine *stages*, seven or nine *years*, seven or nine *transformations*. This one draws diagrams, that one produces images. They align the spine with Mud-Pill Palace, Tailbone Pass, Cinnabar Field, Vermilion Chamber, Yellow Court, and Flowery Pond, practicing water ascending and fire descending, warm nurturing and bathing, sealing and securing. Today it is Kan-Li Exchange, tomorrow Earth-Heaven Peace, the next day Soul and Spirit United. This year the infant is thus, next year the infant is still thus—even after nine years, they remain an old sinner unaware of death.\n\nUnaware of their own errors, they shake their heads, count on their fingers, and babble to outsiders: ‘On such-and-such a day I formed the sacred embryo; my warm nurturing and firing times were not mistaken; my bathing intervals were not amiss. Why, after ten months of gestation, has the infant not been born? Is it that my blessings are meager and my sins profound, that the spirits do not permit its completion?’ They clutch their bellies, their faces aged, their eyes searching, shedding tears in vain.\n\nYou should know these dull-witted, benighted beings, ignorant of their own minds, unclear about their own natures, lost in the karmic darkness—what principle do they understand? Yet such people are still those with hearts set on the upward path; it is only their delusion that prevents them from awakening to the upward mechanism.\n\nThe essence and qi within your bodies are the original qi and original essence of the prior heavens, a treasure neither increasing nor decreasing. If you manipulate them, you will not see them grow; if you leave them be, you will not see them diminish. This empty clarity that never fades is the original spirit. Since it is called the original spirit, why speak of it as an ‘infant’? For countless kalpas, your karmic offenses have not been dissolved, your obstructions not shed, the source of your heart not purified, the root of your nature not awakened. Instead of early repenting your transgressions, transforming your temperament, seeking a master, and awakening to the Dao, you turn this useful true heart to useless false affairs, wasting this limited time waiting for some illusory infant—what is the point?\"",

      "translated_text": "Disciples, that within yourselves which knows good and knows evil, knows right and knows wrong, knows deviance and knows uprightness, knows arising and knows ceasing, knows self and knows other, knows truth and knows falsehood—this is the infant. Yet this infant originally knows neither good nor evil, neither right nor wrong, neither deviance nor uprightness, neither arising nor ceasing, neither self nor other, neither truth nor falsehood. This infant does not cling to appearances; it is through encountering circumstances that the heart arises, through the heart that wisdom arises, through wisdom that knowledge arises. Through good, thus it knows evil; through right, thus it knows wrong; through uprightness, thus it knows deviance; through arising, thus it knows ceasing; through self, thus it knows other; through truth, thus it knows falsehood. Originally without the appearance of self, yet not the appearance of emptiness, it is merely this point of awareness moving in the world to respond to the ten thousand affairs. If we speak of the Supreme Polarity and Primordial Chaos, then this knowing can also be non-knowing. Yet this knowing is innate knowledge; in the Buddhist tradition it is called \"good knowing-advisor,\" while in the Daoist tradition it is named the \"infant original spirit.\" In sum, disciples, it is this single point of empty clarity that never fades—the essence of nature.\n\nHave you ever seen any Daoist, after entering the chamber to sit in meditation and speaking of \"conceiving the embryo,\" emerge after ten months to manifest the infant in radiant form? Before entering the chamber, such a one knows nothing of the conditions of heaven and earth, ghosts and spirits, yin and yang, nor of human fortune and misfortune, future auspices and omens, the year of birth or the day of death. After emerging, they remain just as ignorant. Unclear about their own life and death, unable to liberate themselves, how can they liberate others? With their own life and death unresolved, fortune and misfortune unprophesied, bound by heaven and earth, living like ordinary people, dying no different from common folk—sharing the same clothing, food, and suffering in life, the same burial and stench in death—then is this entering the chamber to sit in meditation not a superfluous affair?\n\nDisciples, first die to the heart before entering the chamber; first sever the bonds of attachment before sitting in meditation. When lustful thoughts have long ceased, the kidneys are full and true lead ascends. When anger has long ceased, the heart is empty and true mercury descends. When diet is regulated and timely, the spleen is strong and mercury and lead are sealed and secured. When emotions are stilled, the lungs are moistened and the nature is settled; when the liver flourishes and kidney water abounds, the eyes shine and the pupils are dark as lacquer. When the fire of the heart is extinguished, the mouth is filled with saliva and its taste is sweet as nectar. When the hun-soul is clear, the liver qi flows smoothly and the sinews and bones are light; when the po-soul is at peace, the lung fluids flow and the hair and beard turn black. When the spleen is robust and the stomach harmonious, the tongue and throat are refreshed and the voice resonant. When the orifices are open and the blood abundant, the hundred diseases retreat; when the five flavors are bland, the upright qi arises. Practicing guiding and pulling exercises according to the four seasons and eight nodes, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness cannot invade. By restraining the six desires and seven emotions, taming the nature and subduing the heart, demonic and ghostly influences cannot encroach. By seeking the great Dao, the good heart appears and the true nature is illuminated; by awakening to suchness, the physical body is emptied and the Dharma-body is revealed. Only after self-liberation can one liberate others—yet this is still the liberation of oneself.\n\nDisciples, only at this stage have you truly taken the first step through the great gate. Then, entering the chamber to sit in stillness, above you may communicate with heaven, below you may penetrate the earth; the conditions of ghosts and spirits, the pivot of heaven and earth—all are grasped within the space of a breath, and creation does not extend beyond the palm of your hand. All this arises from discipline and concentration. Thus, when entering the chamber, one is of the ordinary womb-born body; upon emerging, one is of the sacred Dharma-body. With the great Dao illuminated, the eye’s perspective is lofty, seeing through all conditions as illusory and false; with a staff in hand, the heart’s breadth is vast, embracing heaven and earth into emptiness. Before the human heart stirs, I already know; before events arise, I foresee. Only then is one possessed of the six penetrations, wisdom boundless, all heavenly demons bowing in submission and secretly protecting one. The external paths of the ten directions submit in reverence and fear. Within a mustard seed, Mount Sumeru is contained unnoticed; within a grain of millet, the worlds of the ten directions are hidden unseen. When extended, the mountains and rivers of the great earth are at my leisure; when concealed, the body, fine as a speck of dust or a grain of rice, is at my disposal.\n\nDisciples, this supreme, non-doing, most true and wondrous Dao lies first in investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism. Therefore, you must set aside all those profitless affairs—blind cultivation and ignorant sitting, refining lead and smelting mercury, contemplative visualization, alchemical deliverance of the departed, assuming ranks and receiving registers, circulating qi and waving fans, chanting sutras and reciting liturgies, compounding medicines and burning thatch, consuming elixirs and gathering herbs, yin-yang furnaces and crucibles—and cast them all aside. With utmost sincerity, face heaven and vow with a resolute heart: from this day forward and into the future, may I early awaken to the mechanism of life, death, coming, and going; may I escape the suffering of cyclic rebirth; may I depart from all extremes and hear the wondrous Dao.\n\nAh! This phrase \"departing from all extremes\" is spoken directly to you—it is the great expedient gate to investigating subtle principles and awakening to the celestial mechanism.\n\nDisciples! What are \"all extremes\"? They are blind cultivation and ignorant sitting, refining lead and smelting mercury—all such side doors. What is an \"extreme\"? These side doors are neither central nor upright. Imagine a table: all these side doors lie at its four edges, unable to enter the heart. Even if they reach the heart, they do not depart from the table. Little do they know that only by leaving the table is there the vast emptiness of the Dao. Without leaving the table, it remains an object, not the Dao—is this not an extreme? \"Extreme\" means seeking, deviance, boundary, shore. \"Side\" means not central; \"deviance\" means not upright. With a territorial boundary, there can be no vastness; with a bank or shore, there can be no great clarity.",

Turning away to abandon the lamp in search of fire, clinging to the false and casting aside the real—is this not toppling to one side? Even if you succeed, you are but a self-liberated man. Never having seen your nature, though you attain a fruition, when your retribution is exhausted you still enter the wheel of rebirth, unable to transcend the three realms—what benefit does this bring to these sentient beings?\n\nDisciples! To become immortals, to become buddhas, to be sages, to be worthies—all lies in forsaking the self to follow others, in vowing to deliver all beings. Yet these meditators of today cannot even liberate themselves—how can they liberate others? Called self-liberated men, when have they ever understood the great Dao or delivered countless beings? Falling into partial cultivation, they are truly pitiable!\n\nThe True Lord spoke in verse, revealing the true mechanism, teaching the multitude to abandon the mind of self-benefit and to leave behind one-sided methods. Thus, side doors return to the central path, and heterodox teachings revert to the true Dharma. The limited territory is opened into boundless expanse, the vast world is stretched to reach heaven and earth, the gully with its banks is widened into shoreless vastness, and the unfathomable Dharma-body is extended to transcend self and other.\n\nAs the sutra says: *\"Seeing yet not seeing me, hearing yet not hearing me, departing from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.\"*\n\nDisciples, the gate of realization first requires opening the ground of the heart.

If you seek your original source, adding the flavor of tea and calling it water, you still perceive form. Yet within this ocean, your original source abides—what then is your original source? Investigate carefully, probe deeply, until seeing yields no sight, hearing yields no sound. With accumulated merit over time, naturally one morning your breast will suddenly open, your vision instantly clarify, and your original face—bright and wondrous, the celestial mechanism—will appear. Only then will you realize that the great Dao has never failed anyone!\n\nDisciples, the sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas attained the Dao and ascended to heaven long ago. To see the hearts of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, first understand their principles. By understanding their principles, you awaken to their methods; by practicing their methods, you perform their deeds. By performing their deeds, you embody their form.\n\nDisciples, where does the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas reside? Only within the square inch of each person’s heart. Where do their principles reside? Only before each person’s eyes. Where do their methods reside? Only within the classics and histories. Their deeds do not lie beyond worldly Dharma but within it. Their forms, in turn, reside within their hearts.\n\nIf you know the heart of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas within the square inch of your heart, you can understand their principles. Understanding their principles, you awaken to their methods. Awakening to their methods, you can practice their deeds. Understanding their principles, the true Dao abides. Awakening to their methods, all conditions are perceived. Practicing their deeds, merit and achievement are established. Then the celestial mechanism ceaselessly turns, enduring through ten thousand kalpas.\n\nKnow this: such a person’s divine powers and wisdom already embody the essence of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas—this is their heart. Then, advancing to receive the Precepts of the Supreme Pole, you open the numinous mind, allowing the Mysterious Pass to become thoroughly clear, and thus understand the principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Next, advancing to receive the Precepts of Heavenly Immortals, you delve deeply into wondrous meanings, allowing wisdom to become all-pervading, and thus penetrate the Dao of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas.\n\nThen, unbound and unobstructed, you may be round or square, large or small, moving or still, advancing or retreating, living or dying, bending or stretching, exiting or entering, a sage or a worthy, an immortal or a buddha; you may traverse the four births, the six paths, heaven and earth, or hell. Adapting teachings to circumstances, you deliver beings across kalpas. Transforming without measure, you manifest bodies to expound the Dharma. Like an infinite bright mirror reflecting all forms and shadows, mutually containing one another—thus you practice the deeds of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas, embody their forms, and realize their fruition.\n\nDisciples, at this stage, you are said to have investigated subtle principles and awakened to the celestial mechanism.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor lost his Mystic Pearl in the Red Water and sent Li Zhu to seek it. Li Zhu sought it in vain. He sent Qi Gou to seek it; Qi Gou also failed.

Therefore, it is not called a luminous pearl but the Mystic Pearl. Even the most sagely former master Confucius said: ‘That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is below form is called the vessel.’ The Most High Ancestor Laozi spoke: ‘Inwardly observe the heart, and the heart is without its heart; outwardly observe form, and form is without its form.’\n\nDisciples, the supreme principle is originally the true suchness. Whether sages or worthies, immortals or buddhas, all abide in non-attachment to appearances in their cultivation. If one clings to appearances in practice, even the Yellow Emperor would be using wisdom, fasting, and abstinence to seek the Mystic Pearl.\n\nDisciples! The Yellow Emperor lost the Mystic Pearl and found it through Wǎngxiàng; the wondrous principle for ordinary people is attained through the mindless multitude. I have now revealed the celestial mechanism in full and illuminated the mind-seal. You must examine yourselves carefully and guard closely—should this Mystic Pearl in the Red Water be lost again, who knows where it may be recovered!\"\n\nThereupon, he admonished his disciples, who bowed in reverence and listened to the gāthā:\n\n\"Ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures cannot exhaust it,\nOne direct pointing leaves nothing concealed.\nI urge you: do not toy with many methods—\nThe Dao resides in the heart, not in books.\n\nClinging to appearances in inquiry breeds scattered thoughts,\nIntentional sitting in meditation breeds demons.\nMany stray paths men insist on treading,\nYet none take the true Way—what can be done?\n\nThe true person is without appearance or form,\nA thread of celestial mechanism laid bare everywhere.\nPay no heed to the groping in darkness before you,\nNor cast aside the true path to enter side gates.\"",
