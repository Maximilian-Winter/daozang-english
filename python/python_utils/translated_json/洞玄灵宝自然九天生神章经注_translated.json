  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* from the *Dongxuan Lingbao***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the* Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine *from the* Dongxuan Lingbao\n**Author:** Hua Yangfu of the Yuan dynasty\n**Volumes:** Three\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* Section, Jade Instructions Category\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the Commentary on the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Chapters on Generating the Divine***\n\nThe *Jade Chapters on Generating the Divine* are how the Supreme Thearch proclaims the virtue of cherishing life. Thus, all methods of refining the sacred, blending the primordial, and ascending at dawn are fully encompassed within it. Yet its purport transcends the mundane, and its language is not of this world—without transmission and commentary, it is not easily understood.\n\nI have heard that the Daoist of Mount Heng, Xue Youqi; the Supreme Clarity Attendant, Li Shaowei; and the Western Florescence Master, Cheng Xuanying—all transmitted teachings that penetrated the profound and investigated the subtle, though I have never seen their works. Later commentators were many, but only Wang Yinxian, Xiao Zhenyou, and the Perfected of Floating Mountain offered explanations that were particularly thorough. However, their interpretations sometimes differed, leaving readers unable to reconcile them and even leading to doubts.\n\nFor instance, regarding the cyclical renewal of the *jiashen* era, the matter is difficult to verify, yet some delve into obscure and recondite theories, startling the world and confounding custom—this is how such transmissions arise.\n\nThe divine is the numinous aspect of *qi*, riding the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, wielding transformation, circulating above and below, throughout the four directions, without obstruction. The heavens move through the four seasons, generating the myriad things. The divine person traverses great floods, reaching the heavens without drowning; treads upon scorched earth without burning; rides clouds and commands the wind—nothing can harm them. All this is the work of this divine *qi*.\n\nFor all people, when the divine *qi* gathers, life arises; when it scatters, death follows. The *Nine Chapters* take \"generating the divine\" as their title—its meaning is profound indeed.\n\nOld commentaries number perhaps dozens, but the loftier ones verge on the abstruse, while the lesser ones cling to vulgar interpretations, leaving me sighing in regret. Recently, a visitor from Wu presented me with Hua Yangfu’s commentary. Upon examining its general intent, I found that it harmonizes the strengths of various interpretations, blending them into one. Drawing from the *Lingbao* and *Huangting* scriptures, it elucidates the Dao of cinnabar, making the profound simple and easily visible—like floating clouds clearing to reveal the bright moon hanging in the sky, leaving one with perfect clarity.\n\nAh! This commentary is a guide for those who study the Dao. How could its significance be merely about words? There must be superior scholars who diligently practice it, embodying what our Laozi spoke of.\n\nWritten on the fifth day after the Double Fifth Festival in the *renshen* year of the Zhishun era,\n**Zhang Shouqing of Mount Wudang, the Perfected of Mysterious Response and Supreme Harmony, Founder of the Palace of Subtle Transformation in Supreme Clarity**\n\n---\n\n### **Commentary on the** *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* **from the** *Dongxuan Lingbao*, **Volume One**\n**Annotated by Hua Yangfu**\n\n*Dong* means \"void.\" *Xuan* means \"profound and distant.\" Only the void can contain all wonders; only the profound and distant can give its meaning depth and endurance.\n\n*Lingbao* (\"Numinous Treasure\") refers outwardly to the wondrous and weighty transformations of the sacred, and inwardly to the divine descending as the numinous and *qi* gathering as the treasure. Among the Three Treasures in the scripture, only *Lingbao* is singled out to mark the time when the book emerged to deliver humanity.\n\n*Natural* refers to the original Three *Qi*, which appeared in response to the times, congealing in the great void. Phoenix scripts and dragon chapters took form without trace—naturally becoming patterns, not crafted by the intentional design of sages.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens* are the nine heavens from *Yushan Wu-liang* to *Wu-jie Wu-ai*. *Generating the divine* is the method of nurturing transformation and change.\n\nA *scripture* is a book that carries the Dao, the path of cultivating the true.\n\n---\n\n### **The Golden Book of the Three Treasures in the Great Abundance**\n\nThe *Three Treasures* are the Heavenly Treasure, the Numinous Treasure, and the Divine Treasure. *Great Abundance* is the name of a heavenly palace. The *Scripture of Deliverance* states: \"The Wondrous Court of Great Abundance\"—speaking of the heavenly palace’s abundance, beyond which nothing can be added. This book was once secretly stored in this palace. Gold is the most precious and indestructible, hence its use here.\n\nIts text comprises nine chapters, tracing their origins.\n\nThe *Heavenly Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Great Cavern*. The *Heavenly Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the *Hundun Taiwu Yuan* and the *Supreme Void King*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion *qi*. Later, in the first year of the *Longhan* era, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born of transformation. At the time of the book’s emergence, he was titled *Supreme Great Abundance Jade Clarity Palace*.\n\nThe *Heavenly Treasure Lord* is the *Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy*, originally congealed from the *qi* of the *Mystic Unity*. The highest is called *Heaven*; that which governs above is called *Thearch*. The Dao precedes the Thearch, hence it is called the *Primordial Beginning*. In the human body, it is the *Supreme Unity Emperor Lord*, the primordial spirit.\n\nThe *Great Cavern* is the origin of the teachings’ authority. *Elder* is a title of reverence, noble yet without rank. When the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born of transformation, the name was first established.\n\n*Hundun Taiwu Yuan* refers to the form of the *Jade Void Heaven* before the primordial chaos was split. The number nine corresponds to the *yang* of *Qian*. The *Chart of Opening Transformation* states: \"First is *Longhan*, second is *Yankang*, third is *Chiming*, fourth is *Shanghuang*, fifth is *Kaihuang*\"—all names of past kalpas in the heavens. *Long* means \"numinous,\" and *Han* means \"heaven.\"\n\nThe *emergence of the book* refers to the *Scripture of Deliverance*’s five texts opening and expanding, universally planting the divine spirits. The *Jade Clarity Palace* is the abode of the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s mysterious seat. The *ancestral qi* is the Dao, and the Dao is the Heavenly Treasure Lord. Tracing its origins, the wondrous root is self-formed, with no ancestor above it. It takes emptiness and nothingness as its master, spontaneity as its foundation, enduring without governing, formless and nameless. When the sage establishes teachings, they cannot but honor its source, hence they force a name upon it as the ancestor of the Dao.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Cavern Mystery*. The *Numinous Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the *Chi-hun Taiwu Yuan* and the *Supreme Purple Void*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad *qi* of darkness. Later, at the opening of the *Longhan* chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born of transformation. After one kalpa, in the first year of the *Chiming* era, at the time of the book’s emergence to deliver humanity, he was titled *Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace*.\n\n*Purple Void* follows the Zhao edition.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Lord* is the *Celestial Worthy of Supreme Clarity*. From the One, the Two arises, becoming the *qi* of the *Primordial One*. \"Numinous\" signifies the wondrous and unfathomable. The *Cavern Mystery* scriptures and the *Numinous Treasure* teachings all emerge from the *Great Cavern*. According to the *Preface to the Collected Scriptures* in the *Canon*: the *Cavern Mystery* is the root, while the *Numinous Treasure* is its trace. The *qi* of the *Great Cavern* originally arises from emptiness, flowing into *Cavern Perfection*, then into *Cavern Mystery*, and further into *Cavern Spirit*. The preceding chapter refers to it not as *Cavern Perfection* but as the *Great Cavern*, speaking of its origin. *Chi-hun Taiwu Yuan* signifies that within the *Supreme Void*, the light and images have already begun to sprout, soon to manifest. From the *Longhan* chart’s opening, its traces were faintly revealed; by the *Chiming* era, when the scriptures emerged to deliver humanity, the civilizing influence first became radiant. *Chiming* and *Purple Void* describe the luminous and resplendent appearance of the *Cavern Yang*. \"Delivering humanity\" refers to the transmission of scriptural teachings, all of which are the Dao of rescuing beings from the cycle of birth and death. The *Purple Tenuity Palace* is where the *Numinous Treasure Lord* expounds the teachings and stores the scriptures. Compared to the *Jade Void*, its *qi* is diminished by nine hundred million myriad, thus one knows that as kalpas descend and epochs shift, it scatters into the ten thousand existences, no longer resembling the primordial undifferentiated state.\n\nThe sage’s intent in revealing these scriptures was to fear that later ages would grow shallow and frivolous, pursuing superficialities, deceit, and cunning, cutting short their Heaven-bestowed years, drifting endlessly in the sea of suffering. Thus, he wished to return them to purity and restore their roots, valuing *qi* and securing their foundation to advance the immortal Dao. Therefore, he revealed the divine chapters, earnestly admonishing and awakening them—no virtue could be greater.\n\nThe *Spirit Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Cavern Spirit*. The *Spirit Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the *Spirit Treasure Lord*. The Elder is the *qi* of *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, Primordial Non-Being, and Supreme Clarity Void*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety million *qi*. Later, in the first year of the *Chiming* era, the *Spirit Treasure Lord* was born of transformation. After two kalpas, in the first year of the *Shanghuang* era, when the scriptures emerged, he was titled *Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace of Pure Void*, following the Zhao edition.\n\nThe *Spirit Treasure Lord* is the *Celestial Worthy of Supreme Purity*. From the Two, the Three arises, becoming the *qi* of the *Primal One*. \"Spirit\" is the name for the unfathomable transformations of yin and yang. The *Cavern Spirit* teachings expound the Dao of *Supreme Clarity*’s *Great Peace* and *non-action*. Its revered scriptures comprise twelve sections, with additional texts such as the *Purple Void Register*, *Disaster Dispelling and Calamity Averting*, and *Pure Tranquility Heavenly Youth*, all belonging to this tradition. *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, Primordial [Non-Being]* describe a state of thoughtless non-action, serene and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated. The original text lacked the character *Primordial*; Wang Yinxian later added it to complete the *Three Primordials*. *Pure Void* refers to the light and clarity of Heaven. Compared to *Chi-hun*, its *qi* is further diminished by ninety myriad, growing ever more attenuated with descent. The *Great Ultimate Palace* is the immortal realm of *Supreme Clarity*. All immortals who attain the Dao, observe the precepts, and present petitions gather here to pay homage. Within the palace, the officials, perfected ones, and immortal ministers stand in solemn order.\n\nWithin the *Great Cavern* teachings, there are the *Three Primordial Palaces*. The *Celestial Worthy* once commanded Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou to guard and purify the palace gates. These deities correspond above to the *Three Qi* and below to the three regions of the human body. In Heaven, they assist the pivotal mechanisms of the Northern Dipper and govern talismans, sacred writings, covenants, and registers. When one’s cultivation of the *Great Cavern*’s practices is complete, these three deities guide one’s ascension to pay homage at the imperial palace—this is the Dao of primordial unity.\n\nDuring the *Zhihe* era of the Song dynasty, Emperor Renzong fell ill and dreamed he wandered through thorns, lost and bewildered. He saw a divine figure clad in golden armor, who said to him: \"Heaven grants Your Majesty twelve more years of life for your benevolent heart.\" The emperor asked, \"By what path may I return?\" The divine figure replied, \"I shall send you with my chariot.\" The emperor mounted the chariot and inquired who the deity was. The reply came: \"Your subject is General Ge.\" Upon awakening, the emperor recovered and ordered the *Daoist Canon* to be searched. Indeed, General Ge was recorded as presiding over the Heavenly Gate. The emperor then elevated his rank and established a temple for him in the capital. It is regrettable that at the time, no one memorialized this deity, who corresponds to the *qi* of one’s own body, to enhance the practice of nurturing life.\n\nThough these three titles differ in name and era, their essence is one. They divide into the *Primordial*, *Mysterious*, and *Initial* *Three Qi* to govern. The *Three Treasures* are the revered deities of the *Three Qi*, giving rise to the *Three Qi*, and the three titles together generate the *Nine Qi*. The *Nine Qi* emerge before the *Great Void*, concealed within the empty cavern, without light or image, form or name, color or trace, sound or voice.\n\nThe three titles correspond to the *Three Clarities*’ palaces. The \"eras\" refer to the five kalpas of transformation. Though their names differ, their principle is one. From the *Mysterious One*’s *qi*, the *Heavenly Treasure* was born; later, it divided into the *Primordial One* and *Initial One* *qi*, becoming the *Numinous Treasure* and *Spirit Treasure*. Once the *Three Qi* are complete, they generate the *Nine Qi*, and the *Nine Qi* scatter into the ten thousand *qi* to establish the roots of living beings.\n\nBefore the *Nine Qi* emerged, their light was submerged and their traces obscured, merging indistinguishably into one—beyond governance or inquiry. Guiding the cosmos and governing the world, they opened the mysterious and interconnected, the three hues of chaos flickering in and out of existence. As the revolutions of destiny reached their limit, the *Three Qi* radiated light. The *qi* clarified and ascended, accumulating into yang to form Heaven; the *qi* congealed and settled, accumulating into stagnation to form Earth. The *Nine Qi* arrayed in order, giving rise to the sun, moon, stars, the five agents, yin and yang, and all people and creatures—all receiving life and completion.\n\nFrom the One dividing into Three comes the *Spirit Treasure Lord*, who governs the *qi* of *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, and Primordial Non-Being*, guiding yin and yang to accomplish the work of transformation and overseeing the life and death of the world’s people. The *three hues* are the *Mysterious Qi* (azure), the *Primordial Qi* (yellow), and the *Initial Qi* (white). Before the *Three Qi* divided, they flickered between existence and non-existence, their mechanisms already foreshadowed, soon to emerge with the turning of destiny. After their division, Heaven and Earth were established in their positions, and people and creatures arose accordingly—here one sees that Heaven, Earth, and humanity all emerge from the Dao.\n\nThe myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, without the nurturing of the *Three Primordials* or the guidance of the *Nine Qi*, could not come into being. The *Three Qi* are the lords of Heaven and Earth, the *Nine Qi* are the roots of the ten thousand things. Thus, the union of the Three completes virtue—this is the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *Three Primordials* and *Three Qi* are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth, hence their revered status. They transform and give rise to the *Nine Qi*, which govern the movements of yin and yang and nurture the ten thousand kinds—thus they are called the roots. The *Threefold Union* refers to the congealing and merging of the *Three Qi*, whose transformations are boundless, and from which the virtue of generation and completion arises. The meaning of *ultimate* aligns with the *Great Ultimate*, the convergence and pivot of yin-yang and the Five Phases.\n\nWhen a person receives life within the womb, the *Three Primordials* nurture and sustain, while the *Nine Qi* shape the form. Thus, after nine months, the spirits are arrayed, the qi is full, and the voice emerges. With the voice, the spirit is complete, and the Nine Heavens rejoice. The *Grand Unity* holds the talisman, the *Imperial Lord* ranks and commands, the *Director of Destinies* records and inscribes, the *Life-Span Decreer* fixes the allotment, the *Five Emperors* oversee birth, the *Holy Mother* guards the chamber, and the deities of Heaven and Earth, along with the guardians of the Three Realms, all stand vigil. The *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* stands in the courtyard, facing east, and recites the *Ninefold Treasured Scripture of the Birth of Spirits* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; if female, they chant in devotion. If male, the *Director of Destinies* responds with respect; if female, with compliance. Only then is the child born. If the *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* does not issue the *Mandate Scripture*, and the myriad spirits do not chant their reverent responses, birth cannot occur.\n\nHumans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, endowed with the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. Before birth, they dwell in profound obscurity, and only through transformation do they enter the mother’s womb to become human. The *Three Primordials* distribute qi to form the *Three Fields*, which govern the entire body. The qi of the Nine Heavens sequentially coalesce to form the hun and po souls, the five viscera, and the hundred bones, giving rise to the complete person. By the time nine months—two hundred seventy days—have passed, the *three nines* are complete, and the child separates from the mother’s form. At this moment, voice, form, spirit, and qi are all perfected, and the work of the *Birth of Spirits* in the Nine Heavens is finally accomplished. How could this not be cause for celebration?\n\nAccording to the *Mysterious Mirror*, the *Grand Unity* is the great master of long life, the *Great Unity* of the *Supreme Clarity* and *Great Cavern*, who holds the talisman to unite the hundred spirits. The *Imperial Lord* is the *Lord of the Myriad Spirits*, who determines rank and status. The *Director of Destinies* is the *Central Elder*, named *Li Mingchu*, styled *Xuandu Qing*. The *Life-Span Decreer* predetermines longevity or early death. The *Five Emperors* are the lords of the Five Phases, who bestow the true qi of the Five Phases upon the body. The *Holy Mother* is the *Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens*, the supreme yin ruler, who delights in the completion of beings and thus wards off inauspicious influences. The *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* is entrusted with guarding the jade scriptures and, facing east, recites the scriptures to invoke the qi of generation. The myriad spirits chanting reverence or devotion, like the presentation of jade scepters or tiles to distinguish male and female, are as such. If the *Marshal* does not issue the *Mandate Scripture*, then the Mandate of Heaven is not bestowed. If the myriad spirits do not chant their reverent responses, then the Principle of Heaven does not flow. How, then, could birth occur?\n\nThat a person comes to life is by no means easily obtained. Should one not strive to advance in the virtuous Way to preserve what Heaven has bestowed? The *True Master of Mount Float* said: When a person does good, the yang spirits rejoice, saying, “Today we celebrate, for this person aligns with Heaven.” If one does evil, the spirits mourn, saying, “We have lost the mandate previously bestowed upon this person, and together we shall fall into the dark yin.” Su Dongpo’s poem to Chen Lüchang on *Refraining from Killing* reads: “Have you not seen Wang Wuzi? Before his death, the spirits already wept.” This expresses the same sentiment.\n\nThe *Mandate Scripture* is what Heaven bestows as destiny, as the *Book of Documents* says: “Only the August Lord-on-High bestows the centeredness upon the people below.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “What Heaven imparts is called *nature*.” Though Heaven does not speak, it entrusts the work of creation to the jade scriptures, hence the term *Mandate Scripture*. For a person to return and be born into the human realm, to bathe in the form of the Great Yang, is an event so momentous it startles Heaven and Earth—its value is beyond measure. The true spirits of Heaven and Earth, along with the deities of the Three Realms, all attend, for this is no trivial matter. Even at the moment of birth, it is not to be considered insignificant. Therefore, one should cherish one’s form, preserve one’s spirit, honor one’s qi, and secure one’s roots, so as never to die or decay, and thus attain immortality. With flesh and bones ascending together, one mounts to the *Three Clarities*, aligning virtue with the *Three Qi* and uniting with the *Nine Qi*. Yet, though born human, one may fail to revere one’s qi, honor one’s form, treasure one’s life, or cherish one’s spirit, thereby bringing about death and decay, and severing oneself from one’s original true nature.\n\nHumans experience life and death, but nature itself knows no life or death. Those who transcend life and death have surely heard the Dao or perceived their nature. Ordinary people, their habitual tendencies unremoved, are bound by karma, lingering in the dark yin, or locked in mutual retribution. Once the karmic debt is exhausted and the virtuous nature remains unperished, they may return to the human realm, but only after bathing in the Great Yang do they enter the womb. Above the sun lies a dwelling called the *Palace of Cavern Yang*, a pool of flowing fire containing the *True Water of Yellow Blossoms*. The divine beings there use this water to bathe their bodies. The *Documents of Long Life* speak of the *Yellow Blossom Washing the Form*—this is what it refers to. From attaining human birth, through so many stages, startling Heaven and Earth—how could this be considered trivial? If one can refine and nurture the original spirit, return to the root and restore purity, merging with the *Three Qi* and *Nine Qi*, then the principle of ascending with flesh and bones to the *Three Clarities* is within reach. Yet, failing to exert oneself and thus falling into death and decay—how lamentable!\n\nIn the past, Minister Ouyang Wenzhong, though he did not pursue the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi throughout his life, in his later years, while guarding the Bo She, suddenly gained insight. One day, he sought the Dao from the hermit Shi Tang. The hermit replied: “Your dwelling is already in ruins; it is difficult to speak of such matters now. If you can only clarify your past circumstances, there may yet be hope.” Though Minister Ouyang’s literary and official achievements crowned his generation, did he lack the capacity to receive the Dao? He merely missed the opportunity too late. Nevertheless, the work of attaining the Dao lies in awakening the nature, and one must cultivate the foundation of life as the root. If one cannot revere qi, honor form, preserve life, or cherish spirit, and thus allows decline to set in, with mercury dried and lead exhausted, the foundation of life eroded and the true nature obscured—then, to undertake cultivation at such a time is like digging a well when thirsty. Is it not too late?\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Chapter of Generating Spirits* is the resonant sound formed by the triune fusion of the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, a sacred text that coalesces the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names within its hidden rhythm. It is the natural scripture through which *qi* generates form. The *Flying Mystery* refers to the primordial *qi* of the Originator soaring through the Great Void, merging the Three Caverns into written revelation, its tones harmonizing like metal and stone, gathering the ceaseless creative intent of Heaven and Earth. Within it lie the inner names of the hundred spirits; when recited, the spirits hear their names called and assemble to commune with the divine.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* states:\n*\"The nine numina within the body—why not summon them? To summon them is auspicious.\nThe three essences within the body—why not invoke them? To invoke them is blessed.\"*\n\nReciting it as the *Heavenly Treasure* opens the radiance of Heaven and Earth.\nReciting it as the *Numinous Treasure* awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night.\nReciting it as the *Spiritual Treasure* commands the ten thousand spirits.\nReciting it as the *Grand Unity* equips the body’s gods.\nReciting it as the *Imperial Lord* shapes the form.\nReciting it as the *Nine Heavens* generates humanity.\nReciting it as the *Learned Adept* ascends to Heaven.\n\nWhen the Lords of the Three Treasures recite the Jade Chapter, they proclaim the wonders of the Dao. The *Grand Unity* is the Primordial Lady of the Grand Unity; the *Imperial Lord* is the Sovereign Lord of the Grand Unity. Though the Jade Chapter is one, those who recite it differ, and according to their virtue and power, the transformations and responses they evoke vary in depth.\n\nWhen ghostly spirits hear it, they ascend and advance.\nWhen ordinary mortals hear it, they endure and abide.\nWhen imprisoned souls hear it, they are liberated and delivered.\nWhen withered husks hear it, they emit smoke and revive.\nWhen infants hear it, they gain speech.\nWhen dead remains hear it, they return to life.\n\nThe *ghostly spirits* are ghostly officials. The *Flying Immortal’s Sword Scripture* records that Xiao Miao, a man of talent and renown, became a stalwart ghost and served four hundred years before ascending to rule the underworld. Now, upon hearing this scripture, he need not wait for his term to end, for he may hope for promotion and advancement.\n\nThe *ordinary mortals* are those possessed of the six desires; through the scripture, they attain purity and stillness, and thus may endure in the world. The *imprisoned souls* are ghosts confined in the hells of darkness; upon hearing the scripture, they are fortunate to be liberated, as was Zhang Lihua, who entreated the recitation of the Jade Chapter for deliverance.\n\nThe *withered husks* are rotting wood and dead grass. *Emitting smoke* signifies the revival of primordial *qi*. The Reverted Immortal of Yueyang City’s south used cinnabar to restore an ancient tree—this is the same principle. When *infants gain speech*, their orifices open and their faculties sharpen. When *dead remains return to life*, it is as when Xu Jia, reduced to dry bones, was revived by the Lord Lao with the *Great Mystery’s Life Talisman*—this is the same truth.\n\nThe Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of all myriad beings. Thus, they are beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, beyond what ordinary mortals may hear.\n\nThe Jade Chapter is prized by the Three Eminent Lords; its efficacy serves as the root of all myriad beings’ generation. Tracing its profound principles, even spirits and gods, though numinous, cannot fathom them—how much less can ordinary mortals?\n\nThose who study the supreme Dao aspire to transcendence as immortals. Upon attaining *corpse liberation*, they escape the cycle of rebirth and dissolution, ultimately returning to the immortal Dao, where form and spirit unite, never parting, both entering the true reality of the Way. Without this scripture, however, the womb’s obstructions congeal, the *qi* of death solidifies the root of life, the true radiance cannot be preserved, the *qi* of generation lacks sustenance, the nine orifices remain blocked, the body fails to engender spirit, and one merely receives a single form, as if borrowing *qi* to animate it. Those who master this method may sit and attain spontaneity.\n\nThe Way of the Supreme Perfected comprises seven paths; the Way of the Most High, three; the Way of the Middle Perfected, six; and the Way of the Lesser Perfected, eight. This chapter shares its meaning with the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*. Those who study transcendence, their strength shallow and their steps halting, have yet to escape the Three Realms and can only achieve *corpse liberation*. Though they have not yet escaped the cycle of rebirth and dissolution, they ultimately return to the immortal Dao. For those who cherish their form and preserve their spirit, they draw near to the Way.\n\nThe *True Records* state that when one dies as if still living—feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, eyes as bright as in life—this is *corpse liberation*. Without this scripture, one cannot obtain the essential method of the Jade Chapter and the Great Cavern, nor sever the obstructions of the womb. Thus, they fear the *qi* of death will solidify their life’s root, and the true radiance cannot be long preserved. The *true radiance* is the light of spirit. Though they attain *corpse liberation*, they merely receive a single form, as if borrowing *qi* to animate the body—a withered tree briefly revived in spring, its fluids unsustained, unable to endure.\n\nThose who obtain this method master the secret of harmonizing the hundred spirits. Generally, the human body is born of the Three *Qi*. Having received this illumination, one becomes one with the Primordial Beginning, able to blend with the *qi* of the mundane, the spirit following wherever it resides. Initially, the Three *Qi* generate the Three Spirits, which divide into the Three Sections, Eight Radiant Ones, and Twenty-Four Spirits. If one can harmonize and transform them, the Three and Five Perfected Ones coalesce into the Orthodox Unity, enabling one to summon yang and invoke yin, moving without constraint. Yang *qi* transforms into dragons and simurghs; yin *qi* into jade maidens. Riding the whirlwind chariot beyond the Eight Extremities, one sits and attains spontaneity—how could this be deceit?\n\nThe Three Treasures are revered; the Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens are most sacred. Their secrets are vast, sealed within the Ninefold Golden Racks of the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, this scripture will not emerge. It is the *Forbidden Book of the Primordial Beginning*, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits. Whoever steals it will be severed by the wind-blade for ten thousand kalpas, their soul perishing without rebirth. Those who follow the precepts and revere it will unite form and spirit in transcendence.\n\nAccording to the *Seven Transformations That Harm Heaven Scripture*, the Three Hundred Scrolls of the Supreme Clarity’s sacred scriptures, the Seven Thousand Jade Instructions, the Seven Thousand Talismans, and the Spontaneous Chapters are all concealed in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens—this is one such text. The Ninefold Golden Racks and Purple Yang Jade Terrace are where the scriptures are stored. *Ninefold* signifies layer upon layer, like treasures wrapped in tenfold silk. *Racks* refer to shelves for books. The *Scripture of the Dao-Treasure* speaks of jade and golden racks, so strictly guarded that even spirits dare not steal a glance. Only when heaven and earth are illuminated and the mystic wind flows freely do the true scriptures and sacred talismans descend in due time. Those who revere them long enough will surely attain enlightenment, rightfully uniting form and spirit in transcendence.\n\nThe Three Primordial Palaces hold golden names inscribed in purple characters, marking those destined to become Perfected Ones of the Three Clarities in their next lives. They are fit to receive this scripture. When the karmic conditions align, they should offer gold and treasures, serve their masters with devotion, and receive the precepts through ritual covenant. They must guard their hearts and practice diligently, never lightly disclosing it, lest the wind-blade examine their bodies.\n\nThe Three Primordials’ judgment extends not only to the dead but to all—whether they have attained the Way or not. Only those with golden names and purple characters are distinguished as students of transcendence. The scriptures speak of the Three Primordials’ judgment halls in the underworld, called the *Ink Registers*—the black ledgers. The difference between those with golden names and purple characters and others is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\nIn former times, Li Jue, a commoner of Jiangyang, had long accumulated merit in the immortal registers. Though he had not yet ascended, his name was already inscribed in gold by the immortal officials in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. This distinction is not exclusive to immortals. When Emperor Yuan of Liang was Prince of Xiangdong, he recorded loyal ministers, righteous scholars, and those of literary excellence, using three kinds of brushes: gold-tipped for the loyal and filial, silver-tipped for those of virtuous conduct, and mottled bamboo for those of fine writing. Such distinctions exist even among mortals.\n\nThis refers to those with prior karmic ties to transcendence, whose names are recorded in the immortal registers. Only they may receive and uphold the Jade Chapter, offering gold and treasures to their masters with sincerity, never transmitting it lightly. *Guarding the heart and practicing diligently* means calming the mind, dispelling distractions, and steadfastly following the scriptural teachings. Those who leak or disdain it bring calamity upon themselves.\n\nThe method of cultivation requires a thousand-day retreat, disengaging from worldly affairs and exhausting all sensory leaks. One pacifies the mind, silently recites, burns pure incense, and observes the precepts. Entering the chamber facing east, one knocks the teeth nine times, regulates the voice and aligns the *qi*, then chants the sacred chapter. *Retreat* means single-minded emptiness. The method of cultivation aims for completion in three years.\n\nBefore the retreat, the heart contends with external things, racing like wind and blazing like fire, never resting. Once in retreat, one unifies thoughts, attaining profound stillness, becoming one with the Great Void. The scriptures speak of the *Eight Leaks*: tears from the eyes (liver leak), nasal mucus (lung leak), saliva (kidney leak), sweat (heart leak), night sweats (small intestine leak), drool during sleep (brain leak), dreams of intercourse with spirits (spirit leak), and lustful desires (body leak). When the heart, the sovereign, is settled, all these cease. *Pacifying* means leveling; *silent recitation* means contemplating the Supreme Perfected.\n\nOnce, Master Ge the Immortal observed a prolonged retreat on Mount Tiantai. Before even a year had passed, his devotion moved the Supreme Perfected, who deigned to glance into his secluded chamber—this was the response to his prolonged retreat. Entering the chamber facing east, he aligned with the qi of generation. He struck his teeth: the left as the *Celestial Bell*, to subdue demonic spirits; the right as the *Celestial Chime*, to gather the hundred spirits; and the center as the *Celestial Drum*, to summon the Perfected Sages. Striking the teeth, burning incense, modulating the voice, and rectifying the qi—all are essential methods for reciting scriptures.\n\nReciting once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens.\nReciting twice, Heaven and Earth display reverence.\nReciting thrice, the Three Realms bow to the chamber.\nReciting four times, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.\nReciting five times, the Five Emperors pay homage to the Perfected.\nReciting six times, demon kings bind themselves.\nReciting seven times, the stellar lodges halt their gates.\nReciting eight times, the darkest night becomes luminous.\nReciting nine times, all heavens descend in attendance, and every spirit and numinous being, without exception, guards the carriage.\n\nThis chapter unites the marvel of Heaven and humanity as one. There is no duality between Heaven and humanity. My heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth; my qi is the qi of Heaven and Earth. Having embraced singular sincerity, this resonance elicits that response. \"Once\" means reciting a chapter through once, its sound reaching the Nine Heavens. Formerly, Duke Jing of Song uttered a single word, and Mars retreated from its station. Tang, reproaching himself for six faults, brought rain across thousands of miles. If such is the resonance of their responses, how much more so the chanting of the ancestral qi’s tone?\n\nFor the transformation of ancestral qi is vast, encompassing Heaven and Earth, pervading the Three Realms, stellar lodges, and Five Phases. Externally, it extends to demon kings; below, to the shades of the dark. All spirits and numinous beings derive from this source, flowing and spreading in accordance with their stations, thus giving rise to distinctions of good and evil, high and low.\n\nTwice: the gods of Heaven and Earth hear it and display reverence.\nThrice: the deities of the Three Realms descend to bow before the chamber of scripture recitation.\nFour times: Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Among Daoist heavenly deities, there are titles such as *Dharma King* and *Heavenly King*. Through invocation, they descend—just as Master Ge’s refined devotion in retreat summoned the descent of Perfected Xu to transmit scriptures.\nFive times: the Five Emperors, lords of the Five Qi, behold the true scripture’s abode and pay homage.\nSix times: the Yin-numbered demon kings, the great demons of the Six Heavens, who share in the Primordial Beginning’s dissemination. In retreat and jiao rites, there is a method to command demons, driving them away so that upon hearing the scriptures, they bind themselves and dare not intrude.\nSeven times: the stellar lodges halt their gates, as in the *Scripture of Salvation*, where the *Celestial Pivot* ceases its turning, and divine radiance attains great stillness.\nEight times: the darkest night reveals light, as Yang breaks through Yin.\nNine times: all heavens descend in attendance, and spirits guard the carriage. As when Li Shun chanted the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years, one evening thousands of flying immortals suddenly gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber, and he attained the Dao. The merit and virtue thus evoked are like a corpse dwelling yet a dragon appearing, like profound silence yet thunderous sound—unexpected yet inevitable.\n\nOnce through reaches Heaven, the *bao yuan* opens and flows.\nThe preceding speaks of external resonance; this speaks of internal achievement, elucidating the method of the Great Cavern and returning elixir. \"Once through opens the *bao yuan*\" refers to Heaven generating Water. Human life begins in the *bao yuan*, where the qi of coagulating embryo and yellow essence circulates, ascending and descending without losing its measure, thus gradually nurturing vitality. If the *bao yuan* remains obstructed, there will surely be the affliction of heavenly blockage. For those cultivating the true, when first applying effort to the inner elixir, thoughts, intentions, qi, and breath all settle, spirit and essence begin to gather, and the lower gate of the *Mingmen* opens from this point.\n\nTwice through resounds in Earth, the root of the fetal knot dissolves.\nEarth generates Fire, and in the second month, the fetus forms. Yet the dead qi’s old root may cause it to bind and solidify, so it must be steamed and dispersed by true qi to enable growth. The *Supreme Clarity Cavern Mystery Scripture* contains the talisman of the Great One Emperor Lord for dissolving the Three Passes and Twelve Knots, written in red on green bamboo membrane and recited to dissolve them.\n\nThrice through, spirits bow, the *hun* gate refines the immortal.\nHeaven generates Wood, which in humans becomes the *hun*. In the third month, Yin and Yang begin to separate, and the *hun* acquires form. The *hun* gate lies to the left, belonging to Yang. In the third revolution of elixir refinement, Yang qi becomes sufficient. The method involves concentrating spirit and entering breath to nurture it, whereby divine intelligence naturally arises, the Azure Emperor guards the *hun*, and the Lord of Wood records the tally.\n\nFour times through, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals, the *po* gate closes its barrier.\nEarth generates Metal, which in humans becomes the *po*. In the fourth month, the *po* is born. The *po* gate lies to the right, belonging to Yin. In the fourth revolution of elixir refinement, Yang nurtures Yin, causing the *po* to be carried by the *hun*. The method takes the nose as the heavenly aperture, connecting to the lungs. The lungs govern the *po*; when profoundly still, the breath of coming and going ceases—this is called closing the barrier. Naturally, the *Flowery Pond* fills with water, descending to irrigate the heart’s network. Heart Fire descends, Kidney Water ascends, *ding* and *ren* unite, and the inner elixir harmonizes. If the barrier is not closed, the *hun* scatters and wanders, following dreams in and out. Unable to restrain it, the *po* acts at will, and one ultimately joins the ranks of ghosts.\n\nFive times through, the Five Emperors pay homage to the Perfected, the viscera and bowels become clear and cool.\nHeaven generates Earth; in the fifth month of human life, the Five Phases’ qi is complete, generating the five viscera and six bowels. The five viscera are the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. The six bowels are the small intestine, gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, bladder, and Triple Burner. \"Clear and cool\" means tranquil and undisturbed. Those cultivating the true abstain from desire, so the kidneys do not leak essence; they practice stillness, so the heart does not lose spirit; they stabilize breath, so the lungs can pacify the *po*; they simplify vision, so the liver can nurture the *hun*; and they concentrate thought, so the spleen can settle intention. With the Yellow Center penetrating principle, preserving the Great Harmony, spirit, essence, *hun*, *po*, and intention gather into one—this is called assembling the Five Phases. Their qi ascends to pay homage to the *Mud Pill*, which is called paying homage to the Perfected. Then the Azure Emperor guards the *hun*, the White Emperor attends the *po*, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—ten thousand spirits do not transgress.\n\nThe Six Perils’ demon-kings submit in compliance, and the stomach’s tube generates fluid. The demon-kings refer to the inner promptings of the six desires. *Nuo* means submission. Restrained by the jade scripture, they submit and yield. The stomach and spleen form an outer-inner pair, storing water and grain to nourish the five viscera. The *Classic of Difficulties* states that the qi of the five viscera all converge in the stomach. Moreover, the moistening of fluids depends on thought. If one is enticed by the six desires, thought loses its correctness, and one sees food as drool, encounters sorrow as tears, shame as sweat, anger as surging blood—all flowing away without return. Internally deprived of nourishment, essence, qi, and spirit scatter and leak, leaving only a withered husk, which is the cohort of death. If the six demon-kings submit in compliance, thought regains its correctness, governed within, then fluid arises in the stomach’s cavity, irrigating the four limbs, flowing to moisten the elixir crucible. Essence, qi, and spirit thereby congeal and unite—this is the cohort of life.\n\nThe Seven Perils’ stellar lodges shine bright, and the orifices open with keen perception. Heaven has the seven luminaries; humans have the seven orifices. By the seventh month, all are open to govern seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, and intake and output. Some say that keen perception originally arises from the heart, corresponding to the number of fire. The supremely wise have seven apertures in the heart, hence their keen perception. The dull have few or none, hence their dullness and turbidity. With seven revolutions of the elixir practice, the heavy barriers dissolve, and clarity pervades above and below. The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: “The seven orifices interpenetrate, each orifice radiant with light. The sagely sun and sagely moon illuminate the golden court.”\n\nThe Eight Perils’ dark night reveals light, and the three divisions’ eight luminous spirits fully integrate form and spirit. Yanluozi said: “In the eighth month, the spirits are complete.” The three divisions are the upper, middle, and lower. The *Central Alliance Register* records: the upper division’s eight luminous spirits are the spirit of hair, brain, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, tongue, and teeth. The middle division’s eight luminous spirits are the spirits of the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, left kidney, right kidney, gallbladder, and throat. The lower division has eight luminous spirits: the spirits of the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, navel, chest diaphragm, two flanks, left yin and left yang, and right yin and right yang. Together they number twenty-four, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. The upper division’s spirits take the brain spirit as their origin, stored at dawn. The middle division’s spirits take the heart spirit as their master, stored at noon. The lower division’s spirits take the kidney spirit as their master, stored at midnight. When the work of the Eight Perils nears completion, the body naturally emits light, illuminating the hidden and manifest. The three divisions’ eight luminous spirits are all fully integrated without laziness. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “The eight luminous spirits darkly merge, and qi enters the profound mystery.”\n\nThe Nine Perils: all heavens descend in visitation. The three barriers, five viscera, six bowels, nine palaces, golden tower and jade chamber, twelve layered gates, purple portals and jade enclosures—thirty-six thousand joints, their roots and origins, all simultaneously generate spirit. The *Yellow Court* takes the mouth as the Heavenly Barrier, the hands as the Human Barrier, and the feet as the Earthly Barrier. Also, below the brain is the Upper Barrier, beside the spine is the Middle Barrier, and the kidneys facing each other form the Lower Barrier. The viscera and bowels were noted earlier. The *Nine Palaces Cavern-Truth Scripture* states: “Three *fen* within the space between the eyebrows is the Double Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three *cun* inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace, also called the Mud Pill Palace; four *cun* is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five *cun* is the Emperor’s Palace. One *cun* above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace; one *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Truth Palace; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Sovereign Palace.” The golden tower is the throat, also called the layered tower, within which twelve wardens hold jade halberds to guard it, governing the circulation of qi above and below. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: “Within the layered tower are twelve rings; from high to low, all are perfected beings.” The jade chamber is another name for the brain palace. The *Yellow Court* calls it the jasper chamber. The purple portals, according to the *Plain Questions and Spiritual Pivot Middle Section*, lie within the space above the eyebrows, where the Purple Chamber Cavern resides, guarded externally by the myriad spirits’ sovereign, named Feng Lingfan. The jade enclosure is the Jade Hall, namely the lower cinnabar field. There are eighteen thousand yang spirits and eighteen thousand yin spirits, totaling thirty-six thousand. This describes how, in the womb, the embryo’s form and qi transform, and by the ninth month, all spirits within the body simultaneously arise. With nine revolutions of the elixir practice, the sagely embryo is complete, and the myriad qi ascend as immortals—it is likewise so. The Nine Perils complete one cycle. When one cycle concludes, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors befriend and distinguish one, and one is called a Perfected. Ten cycles unify qi, controlling and commanding the myriad spirits. Demon-kings protect and recommend one, and one is listed among the heavens. A hundred cycles unify spirit, attaining spontaneity. The Great One’s tally is received, and the Primordial Lord grants life. A thousand cycles unify numen, enabling one to sit or stand at will, vanish or appear. Immortal youths and jade maidens serve at one’s command. Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, enabling one to ride a dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight. The Three Realms record one’s name, and heaven and humanity praise one’s virtue. The Five Emperors are the lords of the five directions and five qi. *You bie* means recording one’s meritorious deeds, regarding one as a friend, and distinguishing one from ordinary people. Refining the body into qi is called a Perfected. “Ten cycles unify qi” means the Dao’s qi circulates, and ghosts and spirits submit. Demon-kings protect and recommend one: when one first cultivates the Dao, demon-kings test one; if one does not retreat, they protect and recommend one, inscribing one’s name in the heavenly register, and only then does one attain the Dao. “Unifying spirit” means transformation without limit, attaining spontaneity without relying on thought or action—such as summoning the Six Jias’ traveling kitchen. The Great One’s tally: the Great One is the lord of a hundred spirits; the tally symbolizes the numinous qi within the body. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “Holding the register and grasping the tally, preserving life and planting the root.”\n\nThe Yuanjun is the title of a female immortal, the mother of the qi within the human body. The *Daode Jing* states: “Alone I differ from others, valuing the seeking of sustenance from the mother.” A thousand cycles unify the numinous: when the practice is pure and refined, its wondrous applications are unfathomable, and one may sit in presence or vanish while standing.\n\nThe jade lads and maidens who are dispatched east and west practice the method of guarding the Three Ones. The *Shangqing Mingtang Xuandan Zhenjing* states: “If a Daoist cultivates the Supreme Lord’s method of summoning the Three Ones to guard the form, they may meet with Perfected Ones, attain communion with the numinous and penetrating vision, sit in presence or vanish while standing, and command the Six Dings. The Celestial Emperor grants twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to attend at their left and right.”\n\nUpon reaching ten thousand cycles, this heart merges entirely with the scripture as one, enabling one to ride clouds and drive dragons, roaming and feasting in the Grand Clarity.\n\n\"Ascending the dawn\" refers to rising and ascending with the clarity of the dawn qi, visualizing the Great One in harmonious union—this time is often employed for such practices. The *Huangting Jing* says: “With feathered robes arrayed, the Eight Winds are driven; controlling the reins of the Three Primes, one ascends the rosy dawn.”\n\n*Commentary on the* Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Generation of Spirit *concludes, Volume the Upper.*\n\n*Commentary on the* Wondrous Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Generation of Spirit, *Volume the Middle.*\n\nWithin the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, the Primordial Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement reposed in tranquil seclusion, reclining amidst the seven-jeweled curtains, nurturing purity and refining the true, savoring the penetrating wisdom and delving into the subtle principles of spirit-generation, where the profoundest mysteries merge with the Great Primordial—his resonant whistling echoing through the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Celestial Worthy’s repose and refinement of the true in stillness bespoke a natural ease, harmonizing with the Great Peace. \"Empty Azure\" denotes the qi of the First Green Heaven. The Cloud Palace’s Yellow Chamber and seven-jeweled curtains adorn the celestial palace. \"Savoring and delving\" mean to ponder deeply. \"Penetrating wisdom generating spirit\" encapsulates the essential purport of Daoist scriptures. \"Subtle principles of the Great Primordial\" signify the profoundest truths, their traces concealed. \"Resonant whistling\" describes the unfurling of his spirit and the expansiveness of his numinous heart.\n\nAt that moment, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, the Jade Assistant and Supreme Steward, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of the Dawn, having purified themselves in fasting and raised their ritual tablets, stood in attendance at his side. Leaning upon his jade countenance, they were moved to wondrous perception; gazing upon his numinous eyes, they opened their hearts. Secretly inspired by the divine chapters, they leapt with joy; feasting upon the celestial sounds, they were reborn. Seizing the moment to awaken to communion, they dared to expose their hearts beneath his numinous gaze.\n\nThe Spirit-King, Supreme Steward, and Attendants of the Dawn were all close ministers. The Four Harmonious correspond to the Four Assistants—front and rear, left and right. \"Purifying in fasting\" means emptying the heart to await inquiry. \"Raising ritual tablets\" refers to the Spirit-King’s holding of the staff of office, used by decree to summon the myriad spirits. \"Jade countenance\" signifies flawless purity. \"Numinous eyes\" and \"numinous gaze\" denote all-pervading illumination. At this moment, the Spirit-King, gazing upon the Celestial Worthy’s visage and hearing his celestial voice, yearned for the divine chapters. Suddenly enlightened, he seized the opportunity to venture beneath the numinous gaze, laying bare his long-held heart to make his request.\n\nThereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: \"This humble servant, fortunate to attend in your numinous presence, unworthy though I am, has been cleansed in the dark ford, twice awakened to the congealed mystery, and elevated to the rank of Spirit-King. I govern life and death, oversee all celestial immortals, bestow rewards and monitor the Seven Awakenings, gaze afar into distant realms, and in harmonious observation, face the Supreme Steward, answering as Attendant of the Dawn.\"\n\nThe Spirit-King, desiring to request the jade chapters, first offered words to the Celestial Worthy, humbly acknowledging his own limited talents, cleansed of the stains of his heart in the ford of the dark sea. \"Twice awakened to the congealed mystery\" signifies profound attainment of the most profound profundities. All that follows—\"governing life and death\" and so on—pertains to the duties of the Spirit-King. \"Bestowing rewards and monitoring the Seven Awakenings\" refers to carrying out the Celestial Worthy’s mandate to confer favor upon those who cultivate the Way. Master Xiao Zhenyou explains the Seven Awakenings, citing the *Scripture on Stabilizing Contemplation in the Numinous Treasure*: \"Those who study the Way pass through seven stages. First, the heart attains stability, easily perceiving all defilements. Second, all long-standing illnesses vanish, and body and mind become light and refreshed. Third, premature depletion is replenished, and one regains one’s years to restore destiny.\"\n\nFourth, attaining long life and enduring vision, one is called an Immortal. Fifth, refining the form into qi, one is called a Perfected. Sixth, refining qi into spirit, one is called a Spirit-Person. Seventh, refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one is called a Supreme Person.\n\nHarmonious and concordant—this speaks of one’s duty to maintain harmony, gazing upward to serve the Supreme Steward, as if attending the dawn and responding to its governance.\n\nAt the proper moment, one must seize the opportunity and align with the convergence, treading the Nine Great Suns, penetrating the Yin Talisman, and extending a guiding hand to the myriad people. When the great cycle nears its end and the reckoning of *jiashen* arrives, the deluge will scour away filth, and calamities will blanket the heavens. The Three Officials will wield their brushes, assessing and distinguishing the seed-people, examining merits and transgressions, and separating the good from the wicked.\n\n*Opportunity* refers to what precedes an event; *convergence*, to encounter. *Treading* means to act. *Nine* signifies the thorough penetration of yang. *Talisman* means register—here, the extreme of yang gives rise to yin, and one traverses the yin register. The *Three Officials* are those of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Stirring their brush-tips, they distinguish the good and evil of a person’s lifetime to determine blessings or misfortunes.\n\n*Seed-people*—Master Xiao Zhenyou explains: the Four Brahmā Heavens are called the Four Seed-Civilian Heavens, located above the Twenty-Eight Heavens and beyond the reach of the Three Calamities. The Spirit-King, moved by the impending flood disaster of the time, seized the moment to request scriptures, proclaiming the power of the Dao to deliver salvation.\n\nFrom the era of *Chiming* to the first year of *Shanghuang*, according to the *Primordial Yang Jade Archives*, those who received deliverance numbered 240,000. *Chiming* refers to the time of the *Numinous Treasure’s* deliverance of humanity; *Shanghuang*, to the emergence of the *Divine Treasure* scriptures. *Primordial Yang* is the palace of the Purple Tenuity. The *Nine Dark Jade Archives* contain the statutes of the Perfected, recording the merits and transgressions of people. Those who *received deliverance* were all virtuous.\n\nAfter *Kaihuang*, when the reckoning reaches *jiashen*, the heavens will select officials in sequence, the offices of the immortals will lie vacant, the ranks of the bureaucracy will be unfilled, and the scattered administrative posts will all await appointed personnel. *Kaihuang* is the name of a celestial kalpa, following *Shanghuang*.\n\nThe *Recorder of Destinies* said: \"Yesterday, the Eastern Flower gathered all the officials of destiny, the spirits of the land, and the functionaries of the registers to review and assess the records. They found that among the people of the world, those who do good are few—less than one in fifty—let alone those who attain immortality. The offices of the immortals lie vacant, with none worthy of their posts, and even the scattered administrative positions are filled with the indolent. Those found to have transgressions upon examination will have the higher immortals demoted to lower immortals, and the lower immortals stripped of their ranks to become overseers of the underworld, so that they may repent, cultivate diligently, and eventually regain their former positions.\"\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Primordial Lady, having attained the rank of Primordial Lord, neglected her imperial duties, fell short in her proper affairs, transgressed the bounds of propriety, and lost decorum in courtly feasts. For carelessly revealing celestial treasures, she was demoted to a lesser Perfected, her register as a Perfected Sovereign was revoked, and her position in the Purple Void was withdrawn. From this, it is clear that the promotions and demotions of immortal offices are precise to the finest detail.\n\nAccording to the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*, during the Three Generations, those who have accumulated goodness and established merit, who are commended by the Three Realms and vouched for by the Five Emperors, and whose names are recorded in the heavens, shall be selected—100,000 to fill the offices, and an additional 120,000 to serve as reserve officials.\n\nThe *Jade Archives* mentioned earlier assess the souls of the deceased, while this *Jade Calendar* records the duties of the immortal offices. The *Three Generations* refer to ancestors who accumulated goodness, selecting those whose merit spans generations to fill the offices of the immortals, with the reserves serving as deputies.\n\nSuch examples include those whose names are preordained in the *Mystic Registers*—this is one criterion for selecting immortal officials, taking those whose names are recorded in the heavens, such as Sima Ziwei, whose name appears in the Cinnabar Terrace and Crimson Gates. Others possess bone structures aligned with immortality—those endowed with the pure qi of heaven and earth, born untainted by the mundane, with crane-like necks, tortoise-like jaws, emerald pupils, and double ankles, their bearing ethereal and embracing the mien of soaring clouds. These are the vessels of the Dao’s grove, fully worthy of such selection.\n\nOthers attain it through *extinction and rebirth*, their karmic cycles turning—those who cultivated the Dao but had not yet achieved completion before passing are called *extinguished*, yet they may still be promoted to immortal offices. In the past, Zheng Ren’an was born in Chanli and could speak within three days, already knowing his past lives. At twelve, his face radiated jade-like light, and he left home to wander the mountains and forests. Later, he attained extinction in the northern deserts of Rong, achieving fruition and becoming known as the Venerable Lord of Cinnabar Spirit.\n\nOthers are deeply devoted to the Three Treasures, their virtuous deeds piercing the heavens. The *Three Treasures* are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. The teachings reside within them. Disciples recite their words to illuminate the Dao and transform those who have not yet awakened—this is profound devotion. The *Scripture of the Hidden Perfected* states: \"When the nature of greed is stilled and extinguished, and the dusty burdens are untainted, with precepts unbroken, this is called the Treasure of Dharma. When the nature of anger does not arise and one is not enraged by external dust, with concentration unshaken by birth and death, this is called the Treasure of the Master. When the nature of delusion takes nothing, free from vexation and affliction, with wisdom flowing unimpeded, this is called the Treasure of the Dao. When the Three Poisons of greed, anger, and delusion are extinguished, the Three Treasures naturally manifest, and virtuous deeds pierce the heavens.\"\n\nOthers are commended by the Three Officials for their offerings to the Treasure of the Master. The *Master* is one who transmits the Dao, establishes teachings, and expounds scriptures. Since ancient times, immortals and sages have not attained deliverance without a master. Even ordinary people rely on masters to transmit their learning—how could one not revere, trust, and make offerings to them? Serving with diligence and utmost sincerity, earnestly guiding and instructing, one is rightfully commended by the Three Officials.\n\nOthers accumulate merit through fasting and upholding precepts. *Fasting* means aligning one’s thoughts, moderating flavors, and preserving wholeness of truth. *Precepts* include the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure and the Ten Precepts of the Orthodox Unity. Upholding them unwaveringly over time accumulates merit and virtue.\n\nLi Changling said: \"Daily practice is called *merit*; daily renewal is called *virtue*. The heavenly immortals require 1,300 good deeds—one good deed a day would take only four years. The earthly immortals require 300 good deeds—practicing them would take only a year. Yet most people abandon their efforts midway. Have they not heard of the saying about water wearing through stone or bowing to a tree?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lady of the Purple Void said: \"In the past, Master Fu loved the Dao from his youth and entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao, where he cultivated for seven years.\"\n\nSuddenly, the Supreme Pole Perfected One bestowed upon him a wooden drill and commanded him to bore through a massive stone. The Perfected One admonished: \"When the stone is pierced, I shall deliver you.\" The stone measured five *chi* in thickness. Fu drilled without respite, and after forty-seven years, the stone was suddenly pierced through. The Perfected One indeed came to deliver him.\n\nThe Lady of Southern Marchmount said: \"In ancient times, there was a man who roused his resolve for the Dao yet knew not the method of seeking it. Day and night, he bowed to a withered tree. After twenty-eight years, the tree suddenly bloomed, and its sap flowed like honey. The man took the blossoms and sap and consumed them, thereby attaining longevity.\n\nAlas! Even wood and stone, devoid of sentience, can yet respond to sincerity—how much more so for those who perform purification rites, uphold precepts, and accumulate merit and virtue to reach the lofty spirits?\n\nSome distribute wealth and treasures, establishing Daoist halls. Of all worldly goods, the true value lies in bestowing alms; otherwise, they are but hoards amassed by great thieves, inviting only the scorn of the enlightened. To establish Daoist halls is to construct numinous sanctuaries, enshrine revered images, and expound the scriptural teachings, thereby awakening the good heart in people.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma’s Original Form* states: The Supreme Mystery Purple Void Perfected One, in a former life, built the Hall of Worthies to Gather Immortals and copied ten thousand scrolls of scriptures. Unceasingly, he offered purification meals and clothing in devotion, and thus attained the rank of Perfected One. This account is recorded in the sacred canon—truly not in vain.\n\nSome rescue and succor the destitute, ferrying humans and celestial beings across the sea of suffering.\"\n\nCompassion resides in every human heart—how could one bear to witness the destitute and not relieve them? One ought to aid them according to one’s capacity. In ancient times, Zhou Xihua was devoted to almsgiving, never wearying despite hardship and poverty. The Perfected One Zhi Guan transformed into a beggar to test his resolve, and Zhou indeed rejoiced in giving. That very day, he was ferried across to become the Perfected One of Western Florescence. During the sacred reign of the Song, when a great famine struck Zizhou, the Perfected Lord of Protective Sageliness appeared as an old man selling steamed waterfowl and millet, saving countless lives. At the end of the Jianlong era, when famine struck the Hebei Circuit, the Perfected Lord again took the form of a merchant, transporting one hundred fifty thousand *hu* of grain and wheat into the city. Suddenly, the merchant vanished, and the officials used the grain for relief, extending aid to neighboring commanderies. Though the Perfected Lord had ascended to the rank of High Perfected, he acted thus—his single thought of benevolence toward life was as ceaseless as heaven itself.\n\nAnother example: Huang Jianji sold mixed grain without raising the original price, and the Perfected Lord of Purple Submission paid him reverence, seating him above Prefect Zhang Guaiya. Wang Shiliang measured out rice, allowing buyers to take their own measure, and with a single word, summoned sweet rain—his merit and conduct shone brightly. Good people who do good—how could one not strive to emulate them?\n\nTo \"ferry across\" is like the earth bearing all things or a boat conveying people. Some serve as the Three Masters, accumulating merit to fullness, their names recorded in the celestial registers. The Three Masters are the Masters of Scriptures, Registers, and Ordination. Establishing precepts and models to deliver the living and the dead, disciples follow their transmitted methods, propagating the Dao and cultivating merit. When accumulation reaches fullness, their names are inscribed in the celestial registers. The ledgers of merit and demerit, examined by the Three Officials, are all inscribed in reverse order, with distinctions between high and low, leaving no detail unrecorded.\n\nThe Three Officials oversee the Nine Palaces, which together govern seventeen bureaus and one hundred twenty offices. The Palace of Yang and Life lies to the left, while the Palace of Yin and Death lies to the right. The left bureau records merit in green ledgers, while the right bureau records transgressions in black ledgers. If sins are mingled with blessings or blessings with sins, they are not assigned to a single office. The periods of examination vary—three years, nine years, or twenty-four years—all serving as appointed times for reckoning. Only when the records of the Three Officials align are the names and numbers inscribed, with good deeds yet insufficient also noted in reverse.\n\nMoreover, the Nine Dark Prisons receive the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate from the Azure Palace of Eastern Florescence, commanding the release of the dead souls of men and women from the Jade Caskets of the Nine Darks—those whose past lives bore good deeds, whose merit and virtue are full, and who are destined for deliverance. Thirty-two thousand are selected to replenish the people after the expulsion of the *jiashen* year, becoming the flourishing populace of the Great Abundance. The Nine Dark Prisons are the nine yin realms beneath the nine earths, where the dead are governed. The Azure Palace of Eastern Florescence, according to the *Scripture of the Yellow Qi and Yang Essence*, is Fusang, the Cavern of Yang. It oversees the registers of the living and issues the Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate to the Nine Dark Prisons, selecting the dead souls of men and women who once performed good deeds to receive deliverance. \"Great Abundance\" signifies flourishing prosperity.\n\nAt this moment, the living and the dead converge, good and evil are distinguished—those who pass through truly find joy. \"Distinguished\" means good and evil are made clear. Those who do evil cannot escape calamity, while those who do good summon blessings without harm—how could this not be joyous? Yet the Three Offices press closely, their records teeming in profusion; the Dragon Gate receives the assembly, and the Bird Mother oversees the immortals. The ten thousand sages manifest their presence, ceaseless through the night. Merit and transgression are weighed equally, ensuring life and death are impartially judged. This tumultuous chaos is also my concern.\n\nThe great reckoning presses near, and in every matter, omissions and lapses arise—I constantly fear that one day I may be ensnared by the public tribunal. \"Presses\" means to grind or wear down. \"Records teeming in profusion\" refers to the overwhelming burden of documents. The Dragon Gate lies where the waters converge in Hedong. The Perfected of Floating Mountain is called the Bird Mother, a water deity who, in a past kalpa, at the summons of the Earth Mother, regulated the assembly of the river’s source at the Dragon Gate. She then used a great wind chariot to carry those studying immortality from the waters to Kunlun—this is what is meant by \"overseeing the immortals.\" The ten thousand sages and thousand Perfected scrutinize human good and evil, ensuring life and death are judged by impartial justice. Yet the divine kings, overwhelmed by the press of affairs, fear lapses and omissions—how could they not be troubled?\n\nI have heard that the Heavenly Worthy, in great compassion, extends mercy to the black-haired people, unlocking the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to deliver the countless multitudes.\n\nThe sacred statutes contain prohibitions beyond the purview of a humble servant such as myself. Yet the great reckoning draws near—with the approach of the jiashen year’s end, the cosmic cycles hasten, and the grand Dharma must be enacted. Among the Four Practices of Jade Purity, compassion stands foremost; among the Three Treasures of the Old Master, compassion leads. The sages expand and fulfill it, extending its blessings to all things without exception.\n\nThe transmission of the *Mingzhen* precepts and scriptures is bound by fixed time limits, and when the divine kings petition beyond the appointed hour, it is to urgently deliver humankind. Thus, those of sincere intent may, even amid the calculations of fate, hear the Dharma’s resonance, receive its revelation through sight and sound, and be exhorted toward enlightenment. In presenting this entreaty, I fear offending the celestial countenance and humbly beseech your compassion, granting what has not yet been heard.\n\nI request the scriptures so that those who aspire to the Dao yet remain unenlightened may partake of its mysterious transformation, cultivate virtuous conduct, and escape the censure of the Three Bureaus.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy leaned forward from his high seat, composed his spirit in profound contemplation, raised his voice to chant the cavernous verses, and intoned the jade-like liturgy. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said: \"The supreme model abides in emptiness, its principles subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao penetrates the double mystery, its qi crowning the Divine Empyrean. Its ultimate truth is difficult to express, its wonders hard to surpass.\"\n\n*Leaning forward* suggests a gesture of engagement; *high seat* signifies loftiness beyond reach. *Composing the spirit in profound contemplation* indicates deep reflection; *raising the voice to chant the cavernous verses and intoning the jade-like liturgy* describes a resonant and stirring recitation. *The supreme model abides in emptiness, its principles subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao penetrates the double mystery, its qi crowning the Divine Empyrean*—these lines describe the scripture’s wondrous model and profound principles, vast and profoundly remote. Its Dao pervades all mysteries, its qi originating in the Divine Empyrean. The *Divine Empyrean* is one of the Nine Empyreans, governing the myriad heavens. This passage declares the jade scripture’s ineffable wonders, unmatched by any other text.\n\nSince you hold the imperial office and bear the charge of divine king, your celestial wings soar above the jasper towers, and the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel. Your gaze surveys all, your oversight boundless; you harmonize the myriad transformations and govern the black-haired people. As divine king, your station is imperial; your charge, regal. The *Thirty-Nine-Chapter Commentary* states: \"The Jasper Towers are the halls of the Grand Tenuity, the true celestial palace of the Heavenly Emperor.\" It further notes: \"The sun and moon of the human realm are the luminous wheel, requiring the divine king’s winged assistance and ministerial aid.\" Beyond this, you harmonize the myriad transformations, survey the four directions, and oversee countless affairs—your duties are not confined to one domain.\n\nNow, as the great cycle unfolds its appointed time, the Three and Five announce the hour; the Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine surges, the vast springs churn their waves, ten thousand calamities assail the heavens, and the Four Bureaus select candidates to replenish the seed people. Three generations of chaos and disorder demand the separation of good and evil. You must labor for the multitudes, exhausting yourself for the Three Bureaus. At this juncture of rise and decline, matters require your utmost ability. I now entrust this to you—strive diligently.\n\nThis recalls the Heavenly Worthy’s past exhortation to the divine king, urging him to save the people amid the great flood. The precious scriptures, wondrous and weighty, and the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens are bestowed upon the exalted sages—not for the ears of ghosts and spirits. The *Mingzhen* statutes decree that they be transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, in defiance of the prohibitions, I entrust them to you—guard them well and transmit them with utmost care.\n\nThe transmission of these sacred texts is accompanied by solemn admonitions—how could one not be vigilant?\n\nThen, summoning the Marshal of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Gentlemen Attending the Immortals, he commanded them to open the Purple Yang Jade Case and the cloud-brocade satchel, revealing the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Giving Qi*. The Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the transmission, the Great One selected the auspicious hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the oath. Following the protocols of the *Mingzhen* rites, they faced south in prostration as the scriptures were conferred upon the Boundless Flying Celestial Divine King.\n\nOnce the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations.\n\n*Summoning* occurred without delay. The *Jade Gentlemen Attending the Immortals* are the officials in charge of the scriptures. *Purple Yang* is the repository of the scriptures; the *jade case and cloud-brocade satchel* are the containers for the texts. The *Four Assistants* correspond to the Four Harmonizers. The *Five Elders* are the Primordial Elder of the Jade Purity’s Vast Ultimate, the Radiant Elder of the Void Sovereign, the True Elder of the Mystic Flower’s Treasure Heaven, the Ancestral Elder of the Subtle Grand Ultimate, and the Immortal Elder of the Vast Capital. The *Great One* is the Central Yellow Great One. *Selecting the auspicious hour* refers to choosing a propitious time. The *Jade Emperor* is the Highest Jade Emperor. *Oversight of the transmission, intonation of the oath, prostration, and facing south* all follow the *Mingzhen* protocols for scripture transmission.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy solemnly addressed the Flying Celestial Divine King: \"These *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens* are the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, the sound formed through three assemblies, the true scripture coalescing the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One’s precept-observation encompasses the ten directions, gathering and uniting the Cavernous Void to initiate the cinnabar and azure oaths.\"\n\n*The coalescence of hidden rhymes* was explained previously. Wang Yinxian suggests that *precept* should read *trial*. This means the Great One’s spirits were once commanded to test those studying the Dao; only if their resolve remained unshaken were they permitted to take the cinnabar and azure oaths. The *Transmission and Establishment Manual* records: \"In the past, when I received the divine scriptures, someone tested me by suddenly striking my hand with a staff until it bled, yet I remained steadfast in my devotion.\" The scriptural precepts include a trial covenant: before transmission, one’s robes might be set ablaze without cause, and only if the aspirant remained silent as the flames consumed them would they be deemed unwavering. The *Golden Mystery Feather Scriptures* state: \"All transmissions are initiated by the Five Elders, with the Great One testing the ten directions.\" Thus, the character *trial* was mistakenly written as *precept*—this is certain.\n\nAmong the Six Caverns, the Cavernous Void belongs to the west. Yet the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the Great One to encompass the ten directions, presiding over the qi of life and also overseeing the registers of death—hence the phrase *gathering and uniting the Cavernous Void*. *Cinnabar and azure* refer to the blood oath (cinnabar) and the silk pledge (azure), used to affirm trust and establish covenants.\n\nOnly those with karmic affinities spanning countless kalpas, whose names are inscribed in the imperial registers, may behold these texts. Even a glimpse of their titles ensures that nine generations of ancestors ascend together. You must select those destined for immortality: for seven hundred years, they must maintain a thousand days of pure fasting, present gold and silk as pledges, and transmit the scriptures in accordance with the oath.\n\nGuard it with reverence, and you shall enjoy celestial favor; let it slip, and calamity shall swiftly arrive. Enjoying celestial favor extends blessings to nine generations of ancestors, and your virtue shall weigh as mountains and seas. Inviting calamity condemns your deceased to suffer through countless kalpas—agonies sharper than boiling poison, torments like blades of wind and knives—how could one not guard it with utmost care?\n\nKarmic affinities spanning kalpas are not forged in a single lifetime. When Master Xu the Perfected ascended, the Celestial Emperor proclaimed: *\"Since kalpas past, you have diligently cultivated the Dao, enduring hardships without respite. Your mastery of scriptures and precepts runs deep, traversing ten thousand methods and a thousand gates without omission. Today, you shall ascend.\"* Then the Heavenly Marshal of Great Strength on the Left was commanded to escort him with the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, illuminating the Central Yellow, lest any negligence arise. His remote ancestor Xu You was enfeoffed as Minister of Jade Void; his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father were all granted ranks in gradation. Thus, those whose names are inscribed in the immortal registers—like Zhenyang—are duly recognized.\n\nTo glimpse even the titles of these texts ensures that nine generations of ancestors ascend together—how much more so for those who chant and recite them? Yet when lesser scholars hear the Dao, they laugh at it. It is not that the Dao rejects them, but that they cut themselves off from the Dao, for no other reason than this: their deep-rooted transgressions obstruct their virtuous aspirations.\n\nThe *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors* states: *\"Those who attain the Dao yet lack immortal bones will have their names carved in jade records, but in future lives, they shall not even glimpse these texts. If they encounter the scriptures, they may become patriarchs of the Five Peaks.\"* The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao must first untie the knots of darkness—hence the phrase *nine generations ascend together*.\"*\n\nSeven hundred years marks the time of the scriptures’ revelation. A thousand days of pure fasting is the appointed term for their transmission.\n\nHere now is the translation of the provided text:\n\n---\n\nSilk and precious offerings serve as pledges when receiving the scriptures. The jade chapters are hidden in the heavens above, and their transmission is no easy matter. Those who receive and uphold them must revere and honor them with utmost gravity, thereby illuminating their profound mysteries—so as not to betray the original intent of the divine kings who entreated these scriptures.\n\n*The Central Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: Annotated Scroll of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Scripture of the Generation of the Gods* concludes here.\n\n*The Central Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: Annotated Scroll of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Scripture of the Generation of the Gods*, Lower Scroll\nFurther annotations by Huayang\n\n**First Chapter: The Generation of the Gods in the Immeasurable Heaven of Yudu**\n\nThe *qi* of Heaven is of a verdant hue.\n\nThe *Three Primordial Scripture* states: A person’s *qi*-soul is received from Heaven, while their bodily form and *po*-soul are received from Earth. Without shape or image, they come from the void, passing from non-being into being. They dwell in the womb for ten months—though in truth, nine months. Each month, they receive the *qi* of one heaven to generate the gods. After nine months, the *qi* is full, the gods complete, and they emerge from the womb as a human being.\n\nThe *Records of the Western Mountains* says: Those who nurture life well proceed from non-being to being; those who nurture it poorly return from being to non-being. When a person’s *qi* and blood are at their peak, they squander the gods and *qi* they have received on passions and desires. Once blood and *qi* decline, the *hun* and *po* they possessed return to Heaven and Earth, and the body becomes withered wood. Only those who cultivate the truth know that spirit, *hun*, and *po* are but temporary loans from Heaven. Thus, they treasure, cherish, and refine them, prolonging the loan indefinitely until all becomes their own.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This heaven is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, the *kaiyang* of the Northern Dipper. The primordial *qi* of the imperial true embryo-life is the *yuan-yi huangyan*.\n\nThe imperial name is *Ning Shou Can*.\n\nThe *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel* says: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Purple Empyrean Yellow-Yan Lord was transformed and took his place in the Palace of the Great Brahma of the Purple Empyrean. The Emperor of the Center of Heaven uses true *qi* as the origin of the embryo-life.\n\nWang Yin Xian says: Each of the nine chapters contains four characters of the imperial true life-origin. This is the Yellow Court’s primordial king, located below the Gate of Life, governing the *qi* of generation and transformation. As it presides over all, it is called \"Emperor\"; as the Great One is without peer, it is called \"True.\" The nine heavens array their rectitude, all following the command of the imperial true. Once the mandate is fixed, it does not change.\n\n*Yuan* is the name for the *qi* at the beginning of its generation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Great indeed is the primal *qi* of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it.\" \"Profound indeed is the primal *qi* of Kun! All things owe their birth to it.\" When this primal *qi* first sprouts from below, the initial embryo resembles a hanging sac attached to the spleen. The spleen belongs to Earth, from which all things arise. The Central Yellow Great One is the life of the self; its *qi* flows and extends without end—hence the name *yuan-yi huangyan*.\n\nIntermingling with the *qi* of the empty cavern,\nThe flying *shuang* drifts in the distant void.\nExtending through kalpas without end,\nVast and remote, they part from their root.\nSuffering souls sink into the nine nights,\nRiding the dawn, they long for the sun’s rays.\n\nThe Dao Lord says: The primal *qi* originates beyond the distant and obscure, born within the space of the empty cavern. It gathers and scatters, scatters and gathers. Before a person receives life, their *hun-shuang* drifts in the distant void, faint and without support. From the ancient kalpa of Yan Kang to the present, they have undergone countless cycles of life and death, emerging and vanishing like flowers and fruits severed from their branches, scattered and adrift, never returning to the soil. The \"nine nights\" refer to the nine earths. Ghosts belong to yin and dwell in darkness, following their kind. After long immersion, all yearn to lift their heads and gaze upon the dawn’s sunlight, hoping for deliverance.\n\nThe Great Possession opens the gate of mysterious profundity,\nThe Immeasurable Heaven descends the divine aurora.\nYellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,\nYin and yang *qi*-images intertwine.\nThe embryo-origin binds long life,\nEvil roots dissolve in response to transformation.\n\nThis is the initial work of cultivating the truth. The Palace of Great Possession is the Mud Pill Palace within the human body. At the first stirring of yang, one draws the *qi* of the Great Possession Palace downward to subdue and restrain the yang essence, thereby opening the gate of mysterious profundity—the secret gate behind the navel. One then receives the gods of the Immeasurable Heaven of Yudu, the Morning Metal Aurora Emperor One, both female and male, within the body. The Morning Heaven is female, the Metal Aurora is male.\n\nThe *Scripture of Yang Essence* says: \"Return the yang essence to the Floating Black; gather the yellow *qi* from the Immeasurable.\" The female one and male one are the heart’s fluids and the kidneys’ *qi*, becoming the infant boy and jade maiden. Fire above and water below—how can they unite? If one can abide in the Central Yellow, steadfastly concentrating the numinous palace (the heart), with inner thoughts not straying outward and outer thoughts not entering in, then water and fire, yin and yang, will naturally merge. Once yin and yang unite, the Five Phases invert, and the numinous sprout arises of itself. The embryo-origin is formed, becoming the foundation of the primordial supreme essence’s ceaseless generation and transformation. Life is renewed, and all past evil roots and transgressions are washed away, no longer a burden.\n\nMaster Lü of Floating Mountain, teacher of Min Zhong, said: \"Stillness without movement is the nature of Earth. This is true Earth. When the roots of the senses are severed and all thoughts extinguished, a single purity remains whole. Profoundly still, this is the state of primordial chaos.\" The cloud palace is the Yellow Chamber. The pure harmony of *qi* becomes visible, hence the \"yellow clouds.\" At this stage, sun and moon unite, spirit and *qi* merge, the mysterious pearl nears formation, and the Great One gradually returns to the true.\n\nPeach-Kang unites essence and extends,\nThe two emperors flourish like jade petals.\nThey irrigate the Gate of Embryo-Life,\nRefining essence, the spirit does not wither.\n\nPeach-Kang is the god of the Gate of Life, named \"Uniting Essence and Extending.\" He is the revered god of the Great Cavern, guarding the human navel. The two emperors are the Numinous Emperor and the Revered Emperor.\n\nThe *Hidden Book* says: Without the Great One, the Numinous Emperor cannot return the *qi* of the mysterious void; without the Great One, the Revered Emperor cannot house the Three Ones. The powers of the two emperors operate in harmony without conflict. The flourishing of jade petals describes their purity. The principle of life’s generation in the body originates here. Throughout the twelve hours, the god of the Great One circulates numinous fluids to irrigate the Gate of Life, thereby securing the embryo-origin—this is what is meant by \"refining essence, the spirit does not wither.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Nourish the numinous root so it does not wither; seal the Gate of Life to protect the Jade Capital.\"\n\n---\n\nThe *Nine Heavens’ Mandate of Numinous Life* Chapter states: \"When the spirit is born, the spirit transcends of itself.\" The Primordial Lord seals the Gate of Death, while the Marshal recites the *Cavernous Chants*. One intonation harmonizes with the myriad perfected; nine recitations summon the homage of all heavens. Bowing in reverence through kalpas of time, we celebrate the flourishing of the ancient sprout.\n\nThe efficacy of the *Nine Heavens’ Emperor Lord’s Descent of the Numinous Chapter* gathers the perfected radiance to generate the spirit. Once the spirit is born, one may transcend the subtle and enter sageliness. The human body possesses thirty-nine Gates of Life and thirty-nine Gates of Death. Having attained life, one must fear the reopening of the Gates of Death; thus, the Primordial Lord’s *qi* must seal them, preventing the intrusion of stale *qi*. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Only the utterly true may gaze upon it; most abhorrent are the dead *qi* and all defilements.\"\n\nThe Marshal of Longevity sings the *Cavernous Chapter* to praise the work of generation. When the Marshal intones once, the myriad perfected respond in harmony, their joy mutual. After nine recitations, the *qi* of all heavens arrives in homage, their union complete. Through kalpas to this day, encountering this opportunity, what was once severed from its root now sprouts anew—how could one not rejoice?\n\nMo Xi Zi said: \"To cultivate the Dao and perfect the true lies in this life; the deluded wait for death before seeking life. Where there is life, there must be the principle of life. Even if one attains life, where does one truly live?\" Pondering this verse may serve as a clarion for the birth of the spirit.\n\n**Second Chapter of the Uppermost Meditation on Goodness and the Immeasurable Longevity Heaven’s Birth of the Spirit**\n*The Heavenly Qi is Crimson*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: \"This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence and luminous yang.\" The *qi* of the Emperor’s True Embryonic Life originates in the Cavernous Obscurity of the Purple Chamber. The Emperor’s name is *Heng-Ni-Nan*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* records: \"In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of the Cavernous Obscurity of the Great Empyrean was transformed and born. This Heaven’s Emperor takes true *qi* as the origin of embryonic life.\" The Perfected of the Western Marchmount states: \"In humans, the second month forms the embryo—the root of the entire body, from which life first arises. Thus, it is called the *Embryonic Life Origin*.\"\n\nWhen the Perfected forms the embryo, the spirit dwells in the Purple Chamber, its root linked to the Gate of Life, continuous and unbroken—this is called *embryonic breathing*. The *Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: \"The true person breathes through the heels, still and *qi* profound. The multitude breathes through the throat, restless and *qi* shallow.\" Shallow *qi* scatters the embryonic origin and dissipates true *qi*. The Gate of Life lies in the north, termed *Cavernous Obscurity*. As its *qi* ascends to the Purple Chamber, it is called the *qi* of the Purple Chamber. The Purple Chamber is located one *cun* above the space between the brows, recessed three *fen* into the bone.\n\nThe Immeasurable One knits the Purple Chamber,\nIts *qi* revered as the King of Heaven’s Center.\nIt opens and conveys the soaring mysterious luminosity,\nCongealing and transforming the wheel of empty vastness.\nThus, sever the roots of past attachments,\nAnd trace the origin of former affinity.\nThrough dark nights sunk in distant kalpas,\nFace the exhaustion of the great cycle’s passage.\n\nThe Immeasurable Longevity Heaven bestows and infuses numinous *qi*, which coalesces in the Purple Chamber, where among the Nine Heavens it is revered as the *qi*-honored Emperor. The *soaring mysterious luminosity* refers to the dead soul, which at its inception as a person also receives the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery. The Heavenly Emperor, abiding in the azure vault, turns the wheel to transform its end in the empty vastness, opening and conveying it, instantly severing the bonds of past attachments. One regains the Great Dao as the root and awakens to the original nature of former days.\n\nYet in the past, through greed and attachment, one endured suffering, sinking into dark nights across distant kalpas. Now, the retribution is complete, and the great cycle’s turning brings renewal—one may be reborn.\n\nThe Emperor’s True Beginning Clarity is named *Primordial Yang*. The Infant Historian Bo Hua forms the embryo and guards the Yellow Chamber. Sever the roots and seal the Gates of Death; nurture the infant with radiant countenance.\n\nUpon receiving precelestial *qi*, one is born. After birth, a single spark of primordial numen returns to the space between the kidneys—this is the Emperor’s True. Initially called *Essence*, its name is *Primordial Yang*, the title of the Original King of the Yellow Court below the Gate of Life, who presides over this Emperor’s True. The Infant Historian Bo Hua is the Red Child of the Heavenly Emperor of the Muddy Pellet, named *Mysterious Congealing Heaven*, who together holds true *qi* and forms the embryo within the Yellow Chamber. The Yellow Chamber is the Central Palace. Once the embryonic *qi* is complete, a spirit guards it.\n\nThe roots of evil and the Gates of Death refer to the karmic habits and desires lodged in the heart—these must be severed. Even slight transgression causes lead to scatter and mercury to flee. Maintain constant harmony to nurture the sacred embryo into the Infant Child.\n\nMeditation guides the numinous *qi*,\nMysterious feeding bestows celestial fragrance.\nRadiant splendor refines the jade-like form,\nThrough refinement, one’s countenance naturally emerges.\nDevoted to the Mysterious, fostering life’s flourishing,\nThe host of spirits arrays itself within the Hall of Light.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor guides the numinous *qi*. Having already formed the embryo, one must now nurture it. Beginning at the Purple Gate below the Three Passes, it descends from the Muddy Pellet to the Flowery Pond, where one rinses and swallows the fragrant essence—hence called *Mysterious Feeding*. As the irrigation circulates, the Infant’s true *qi* becomes abundant, and the body naturally assumes the purity of jade. With prolonged refinement, the countenance forms of itself. As the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: “The mouth is the Jade Pond, the Palace of Grand Harmony; rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid, calamities cannot approach. The body emits radiant light, the *qi* redolent as orchid; repelling the hundred evils, the face is refined as jade. Those who cultivate this diligently ascend to the Broad Cold.” Wang Yin Xian says: *Radiant Splendor* refers to absorbing the luminous essence of the sun and moon to nourish the embryo, dissolve obstructions, and naturally refine the jade-like complexion.\n\nWithin the embryo dwell two spirits:\nOne is the Lord of White *Qi*, named *Devoted to the Mysterious*, styled *Fostering Life’s Flourishing*.\nThe other is *Mysterious Return*, styled *Abundant Prosperity*.\nThese spirits are born with the embryo’s destiny, arraying themselves alongside all spirits within the Hall of Light. As Master Xiao states: The Three Fields of the human body each contain chambers of the Hall of Light and the Grotto Chamber.\n\nThe Great Void stirs the numinous convergence,\nCommanding me to sing the *Chapter on Generating Spirit*.\nAt the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir;\nAt the second, Heaven and Earth commune.\nHarmonizing and blending of themselves,\nNine recitations complete the work of humanity.\nThe Great Sage celebrates the Primordial Auspiciousness—\nScattering flowers in homage to the Great Void.\nAll heavens rejoice in unison,\nEvery being bows in reverence.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor commands the Jade Chapter to generate spirit within the Great Void, evoking the assembly of the hundred numina—precisely what the *Book of Changes* calls “the Dao of Qian transforming and transmuting, each rectifying its nature and destiny.” *Stirring the Nine Mysteries* means that one recitation resonates through the Nine Heavens. *Heaven and Earth commune* means that two recitations establish reverence between Heaven and Earth. With the harmony of yin and yang and the completion of nine recitations, all beings receive the work of generation and transformation. *Primordial* is the chief of virtues; *auspiciousness* ensures nothing is inauspicious. The rejoicing of all heavens reflects the Heavenly Dao’s reverence for life.\n\n**Third Chapter of the *Celestial Longevity Scripture*: The Heaven-Born Chapter on Generating Spirit**\n*The Azure Qi of Heaven*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the Heavenly Soul’s primordial yang, the *qi* of the Emperor’s True, the soul’s destiny, the origin of the numinous, the radiant immortal’s *qi*.\nThe Emperor’s name is *Yan Bing Ning*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Azure Radiance Bright Immortal Lord was transformed and born, taking true *qi* as his soul and the origin of his destiny. Master Dou of the Western Marchmount says: In the third month of gestation, the three *qi* circulate, the three souls descend, and the spirit’s numinosity lengthens. Zhao Yu Chan says: The soul is yang *qi*; yang *qi* is luminous, hence called the *Bright Immortal*. *Lengthening Numinosity* is what the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* calls “the yellow *qi* surges, clear and long.”\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor *Xu Yan* governs the three souls and the *qi* of the *Lengthening Numinous Bright Immortal*, which truly divides from the Primordial Origin. It manifests as the vast expanse of the Great Brahmā, the radiant splendor of the Jade Lord of Emerald. *Xu Yan* is the Heavenly Emperor who governs the three souls. The *qi* of the *Lengthening Numinous Bright Immortal* truly originates from the Primordial Origin, transforming into the boundless image of the Great Brahmā. *Great Brahmā* refers to the *qi* of all heavens filling the ten directions. The soul resides in the liver, corresponding to wood and spring; its color is azure, hence called the *Radiant Splendor of the Jade Lord of Emerald*.\n\nThe luminous Brahmā soars on the dark radiance,\nOpening the path to deliver the souls of the long night.\nThe wandering spirits hasten to their appointed return,\nThe *qi* in abundance returns to its original root.\n\nHuman life fundamentally arises from Brahmā *qi*, within which dwells the spirit of birth, named *Luminous Brahmā*. The *Universal Salvation Mantra* speaks of the six *qi* all obeying *Luminous Brahmā’s* summoning—this refers precisely to this. *Dark Radiance* is the name of a dragon. It means the spirit of *Luminous Brahmā* rides the dragon through the void, opening the path to deliver the dead souls from the long night’s yin realm. *Wandering spirits* refers to the ethereal soul’s roaming; now, having received life, it hastens to its appointed return. *The qi in abundance returns to its original root* means that the *qi* of the former body, once dispersed, all returns to the origin.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor is titled *Hall of Yang*,\nStyled *Lord of the Eight Numinous Ones*.\nThe Ninefold Opening reverses the register of the Dao,\nThe embryo’s *qi* generates the Upper Primordial.\nAscending the Brahmā to cross the ledger of destiny,\nThe Great One assists the extension of essence.\nThe Muddy Pellet spreads the Emperor’s seat,\nThe Three Fields and Eight Radiant Ones divide.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor’s essence-soul is named *Hall of Yang Jade*, styled *Eight Numinous Ones*. The Heavenly Emperor of the Nine Openings is named *Reversing the Register of the Dao*, styled *River of Utmost Darkness*. The *Jade Record of the Great Simplicity* states: In the third month, the soul forms, its *qi* originally generated from the embryo. Moreover, the Grand Harmony August Sage, the Old Master, governs the *qi* of the embryo’s origin, entering and exiting the Purple Tenuity—precisely the residence of the Great One on Kunlun, which is the Upper Palace of the Muddy Pellet, hence called *the embryo’s qi generates the Upper Primordial*. *Ascending the Brahmā* is the Lord of the Myriad Spirits, also named the *Divine Elder*, styled *Treading the Flourishing Numinous One*, who guards the Purple Gate within the space between the human brows, overseeing human lifespan and longevity. *Extending Essence* is the name of the Peach Vigor Lord of the Gate of Destiny, who guards the Central Gate of the navel, holding the single spark of primordial yang *qi*, also converging in the Upper Palace of the Muddy Pellet. The Venerable Great One, *Devoted to Gathering*, resides at the Jade Pillow below the Muddy Pellet’s rear gate, assisting and sheltering it, blending and harmonizing. Then the seat is properly spread, and the spirits of the Three Fields and Eight Radiant Ones each take their places.\n\nThe solemn cultivator of the true,\nNurturing yang and gathering the soul,\nCauses the Eight Radiant Ones to unite their light,\nIlluminating the Muddy Pellet.\nGathering the myriad numina,\nAt dawn ascending the chamber of the Heavenly Elder,\nConcentrating essence and converging spirit,\nStriking down the roots of the womb,\nAscending to the immortal capital.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Grotto* states:\n*The Supreme Emperor’s Upper Primordial Qi*,\n*The Child of the Controller of Destiny at midday*.\nResplendent, it forms radiant light,\nDonning auroras, riding the Emperor’s ramparts.\nArrayed in seats of the Thunderous Numinous,\nBlending with the five days as one.\nThe Eight Radiant Ones illuminate the Muddy Pellet,\nLuminous within the Grotto Chamber.\n\nThe resonant tones of the Nine Heavens,\nJade scriptures give birth to the myriad spirits.\nThrice recited, they array in proper positions,\nQi aligning with the Eight Celestial Gates.\nThe Mysterious Pass bars the Gate of Death,\nThe numinous guards the source of fluids.\nResponding to the tally of spiritual convergence,\nThe Dao illumines, subtly revolving the wheel.\nJoyous is this Infant’s shedding,\nBowing in reverence to praise the *Grotto Scripture*.\n\nThe jade scriptures of the Nine Heavens,\nTheir sounds resonant and clear,\nDescend to generate the myriad spirits.\nThree revolutions compose one body,\nEach spirit and qi assumes its rightful place,\nTheir positions at the Eight Celestial Gates.\nThe *Commentary on the Scripture of Spirit Transference* states:\n*The human skull comprises eight plates, corresponding to the Eight Gates of Heaven.*\nThe *Upper Scripture of the Grotto Chamber of the Purple Void Lord* says:\n*Above the Purple Gate, gazing toward the Eight Celestial [Gates],\nDrawing forth the Cinnabar Palace, assembling the luminous spirits.*\n\nThe Eight Gates of Heaven are:\nIn the East, the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate;\nIn the South, the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance;\nIn the West, the Interconnected Yin Metal Portal;\nIn the North, the Yin Birth Vast Spirit;\nIn the Northeast, the Spirit-Through Prohibited Heights;\nIn the Southeast, the Beginning Yang Birth Qi;\nIn the Southwest, the Mysterious Yellow Lofty Dawn;\nIn the Northwest, the Nine Transformations Brahma Conduct Gate.\nSome say the qi of the Eight Radiant Ones within the body\nAscends to align with these Eight Celestial Gates.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass refers to the Lower Cinnabar Field.\nThe *True Instructions* states:\n*Guard and seal the Mysterious Pass,\nInwardly draw the Nine Perfected,\nThe Three Qi circulate fluids,\nIrrigating the Cinnabar Field.*\nThree inches below the navel lies the Gate of Life.\nIf the Gate of Life is secured, the Gate of Death is barred;\nThus, the numinous qi settles and stills,\nThe source of fluids flows ceaselessly,\nNourishing the hundred bones.\nThose who study immortality, favored by karmic affinity,\nExternally can proclaim the transformations of the Dao,\nInternally can subtly revolve the mechanism of yin and yang within the body.\nConcentrating qi to achieve suppleness,\nTheir merit complete in nine revolutions,\nA body beyond the body—\nThe Infant sheds its form.\n\n**Silent and Formless: The Heaven-Born Spirit Chapter of the Doushu Heaven**\n**Heavenly Qi: Verdant Hue**\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states:\n*This is the qi of the Heavenly Soul’s essence, the Supreme Yang.*\n*The Emperor’s True Po, the Destiny’s Origin, the Vast Corpse’s Dark Evolution Qi.*\nThe Emperor’s name: *Yun Dun Gong*.\nThe *Seven Bamboo Slips of the Cloudy Satchel* says:\n*In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han, the Azure Firmament Dark Evolution Lord was transformed into being.\nThus, the Emperor of this heaven employs true qi as po,\nThe inception of destiny’s origin.*\nPo pertains to substance, hun to spirit;\nHun qi governs ascent, po form governs descent.\nHun is light and pure, po heavy and turbid—\nHence, it is called the \"Vast Corpse.\"\n\"Vast\" denotes the solidity of stone;\n\"Dark Evolution\" signifies freedom and pursuit.\nAs po belongs to yin, it delights in wandering—\nThus, it is called Dark Evolution.\n\nSilent, formless, the ancestral origin,\nThe Doushu resists the Great Veil.\nSpirit transforms, the Four Sceneries divide,\nMyriad strands of emerald and vermilion auroras.\nThe preceding chapter spoke of the Primordial Qi’s division,\nThe Three Qi’s differentiation;\nThis speaks of the Four Sceneries,\nThe heavens transformed from the Brahma Qi beneath the Three Qi.\n\"Resists\" means to shield,\nDwelling beneath the Great Veil like a barrier.\nEmerald and vermilion auroras—\nThe spectacle of Brahma Qi’s diffusion.\n\nThe wandering po heeds not return,\nOnce departed, it penetrates the demonic hordes.\nThe Divine Duke gathers the wandering qi,\nFloating, refining the pristine blossom.\nFlourishing, surpassing the kalpas of the great camphor,\nRiding the destiny, responding to the numinous chart.\nPo is the gathering of yin spirits,\nDelighting in wandering, desiring human death and departure,\nPursuing the six grottoes’ yin demons as companions.\nThe immortal scriptures possess methods to restrain po:\nClose the qi for seven breaths,\nKnock the teeth seven times,\nThe mind visualizes white qi at the tip of the nose,\nGradually expanding to pervade the entire body.\nThen swallow saliva seven times,\nVigorously call the po’s names: Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Yin,\nFlying Poison, Heavenly Thief, Expel Filth, Fetid Lung.\nAfter calling, settle into stillness—\nThe po will naturally calm.\n\nThe Divine Duke Wang is said to be:\nThe Jade Clarity High Minister, once commanded to subdue the Northern Feng,\nOverseeing the punitive hosts—\nHence, he is called the Divine Duke.\nSubduing his martial prowess,\nHe gathers back the wandering po.\nMoreover, the Liver Spirit, the Peerless Duke,\nNamed Mysterious Origin Shu, styled Divine Duke,\nGoverns the hun.\nCultivators must ensure the hun constantly attends the po,\nLike sunlight carrying moonlight’s substance,\nThe po constantly restrains the hun,\nLike moonlight receiving sunlight.\nThus, the hun does not stray, the po does not depart—\nOnly then can one ascend as an immortal.\nIf the po does not receive the hun, the hun does not carry the po,\nThe hun wanders and the po descends—\nThen the person dies.\nNow that the wandering po has returned,\nRefining it coalesces into a pristine blossom, extending life,\nMatching the years of the great camphor.\n\"Riding the destiny, responding to the numinous chart\"—\nPraising those who study immortality with karmic affinity.\n\n**The Empty Grotto’s Spirit-Birth Chapter,\nJade tones soar beyond the nine auroras.**\nOne chant summons the myriad perfected,\nThe ethereal and bright unite as one household.\nNine revolutions complete the radiant spirit,\nLushly gleaming like jade blossoms.\nThe Doushu opens the Great Possession,\nOne celebration

Empty Grotto’s Spirit-Birth Chapter,\nJade tones soar beyond the nine auroras—\nThe sounds of jade scriptures,\nCombining the Three Grottoes’ flying mysterious qi\nTo form the essence of the nine auroras.\nOne chant and recitation,\nHeaven and earth’s myriad spirits converge in assembly.\nHow could the yin and yang, hun and po, essence and brightness of my body\nFail to unite as one household?\nMaster Wang says:\n*Po takes hun as its household;\nHun and po united, how could they diverge?*\nNine revolutions complete the radiant spirit—\nMerit fulfilled, spirit and qi fully equipped.\nRadiant spirit: the luminous numinous qi within the body.\nJade blossoms: the appearance of radiance.\nHere, one sees the Doushu Heaven Emperor’s great merit in delivering humanity.\n\"One celebration enjoys abundant blessings\"—\nLong life and enduring vision, free from calamity.\nThe Supreme Sage turns the chariot,\nThe deliverance of humanity complete.\nThe Infant’s song—\nThe Dharma body already manifest,\nFitting that the myriad spirits rejoice and respond in unison.\n\n**The Pāramitā’s Secret Joy: The Heaven-Born Spirit Chapter of the Paradise Heaven**\n**Heavenly Qi: Yellow Hue**\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states:\n*This is the qi of the Heavenly Soul’s essence, the Supreme Yang.*\n*The Emperor’s True Zangfu, the Destiny’s Origin, the Five Immortals’ Central Numinous Qi.*\nThe Emperor’s name: *Yan Gong Yuan*.\n\nThe heavens form human shape through the qi of the Five Phases—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water—internally arranging the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys to store the *hun*, *shen*, *yi*, *po*, and *jing*. In heaven, these correspond to the Five Stars and the Five Emperors; in humanity, to the Five Constants; in function, to seeing, speaking, thinking, bearing, and hearing. Those who cultivate the Dao ensure the Five Qi reside at the center to coalesce the Origin of Destiny—hence called the \"Central Numinous Qi of the Five Immortals.\"\n\nFluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots,\nDrifting, the Gate of Mystery Above.\nStrolling the Yellow Flower Wilderness,\nRevolving the numinous chariot at Heaven’s edge.\nGathering the soaring spirits of the void,\nFew of the old souls remain.\n\"Fluttering, drifting\"—both describe the aspect of soaring flight.\nThe Five Emperors are none other than the Joyous Heavenly Emperors, who often command their chariots to roam. The *Gate of Mystery Above* is the Gate of the Mysterious Capital. *Yellow Flower* refers to the harmonious void of Great Emptiness. *Revolving the numinous* means lingering the divine chariot at Heaven’s edge, gazing down upon the world to sing and gather the scattered souls, returning them to life. Yet, as the ages stretch into obscurity, the old souls have worn away, and few remain. As the ancients said: *\"To lose the human form is to wander ten thousand kalpas without hope\"*—how grievous!\n\nThe *Yellow Banner of the Supreme Subtlety* revolves,\nThe *Numinous Pennant of Wu Ying* summons.\nDrawing forth from the Long Night’s abode,\nOpening deliverance to receive the living souls.\nThe earlier passage spoke of how few old souls remain, fearing they may dissipate in the harsh winds or sink into the various destinies. Thus, the Lesser Lad of the *Supreme Subtlety*, named *Jing Jing*, is commanded to turn the Central Yellow Banner before the Emperor, gathering the wandering souls. The Noble Son *Wu Ying*, master of the liver’s *hun*-spirit, is ordered to grasp the *Numinous Pennant of Destiny* to summon the soul-qi, refining them anew to be reborn in the *Supreme Subtlety*. According to the *Qingxuan Commentary on the Scripture of Salvation*: The Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen—also the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound—governs the *Supreme Subtlety* and oversees the fire-refinement. Long-immersed in darkness, the souls must enter the fire to shatter yin’s turbidity and restore yang’s radiance. When the heart-source is purified and karmic filth dissolved, the spirit is transformed through emptiness, returning to the human realm.\n\nThe Noble Son aids *Huang Ning*,\nCollating form and spirit as one.\nJade chapters illumine the hidden numinous,\nFive revolutions part heaven and earth.\nQi refines the primordial zangfu,\nPurple portals birth immortals of their own.\nThe Noble Son *Wu Ying* is the spirit of the *hun*. *Huang Ning* refers to the Three Perfected of Essence and Blood, named the *Lord of Primordial Life*. When *hun* and essence-blood assist one another, collating them into unity, form and spirit become whole. *Illumining the hidden* means revealing the subtle within the obscure. Those who cultivate the Dao cause the Brahma-qi to revolve, the Emperor’s True Self to enter stillness, golden light to shine forth, and drifting clouds to linger—naturally, the tiger’s roar summons wind, the dragon’s chant gathers clouds, and the Great Treasure is achieved.\n\nSome say: Heaven One generates Water to stabilize nature; Earth Two generates Fire to stabilize the heart; Heaven Three generates Wood to stabilize form; Earth Four generates Metal to stabilize qi; Heaven Five generates Earth to stabilize the Central Palace. This is called the \"gathering of the Five Phases.\" The *Ten Revolutions of the Returning Numinous Diagram* in the *Scripture of Salvation* states: Qian Nine and Kan One make ten; Kun Six and Li Four make ten; Xun Two and Dui Eight make ten; Gen Three and Zhen Seven make ten—these are the Ten Revolutions of the Returning Numinous, completing the supreme number of the celestial cycle, the Way of the myriad qi’s return to the origin.\n\nThus, Heaven Three (Wood) and Earth Two (Fire) dwell together to form the first five; Earth Four (Metal) and Heaven One (Water) dwell together to form the second five. Wu and Ji, with the number five, reside in central harmony, uniting the Four Images to birth the Infant—this is called the \"Three and Five Returning to One.\"\n\nAccording to the *River Diagram*: Heaven One, Earth Two, Heaven Three, Earth Four, Heaven Five—these are the generating numbers of Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth in heaven. One plus five makes six, for Water halts upon meeting Earth. Two plus five makes seven, for Fire is nurtured by Earth. Three plus five makes eight, for Wood is planted by Earth. Four plus five makes nine, for Metal is born through Earth. The phrase *\"Five revolutions part heaven and earth\"* means the Four Images are inherently natural, though belonging to heaven, they have names but no form. Only when harmonized with Earth do they take shape, becoming of the earth. After these five revolutions, the Five Qi, Five Essences, and Five Spirits congeal, ascending to the Purple Portal—thus the elixir is complete.\n\nThe numbers complete, the assembly of perfected beings,\nYang stirs, responses flourish.\nJade maidens anoint with five fragrances,\nThe Holy Mother rejoices for the myriad lives.\nThe Three Realms unite in joy,\nBowing their heads to the Heavenly Venerable.\n*Numbers complete* refers to the nine revolutions. When the inner elixir of cultivation is achieved, one must refine it through nine cycles, like a pregnancy of nine months. *\"Yang stirs, responses flourish\"* means that once the yang-spirit is formed, the transformations within the body resonate with abundant auspicious signs. Those who persevere in cultivation to this realm will witness its efficacy. *\"Anointing with five fragrances\"* refers to the Jade Maidens of the Yellow Flower guiding the true qi of the Five Directions to bathe the body. It is also said: when the elixir ripens, fragrance permeates the bones and crowns the head. The *Holy Mother* is the *Holy Mother of Primordial Qian*, who once protected the body at birth—now witnessing the Dao’s completion, how could she not rejoice? Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, who have guarded this path, also delight. Since the great virtue of life and completion belongs to heaven, all bow their heads to the Heavenly Venerable.\n\n**The Sixth Chapter of the Heaven-Born Spirit in the Resonant Transformation of the Cavernous Mystery: Heavenly Qi of White Hue**\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states:\n*This is the qi of the Heavenly Soul’s essence, the Primordial Yang.*\n*The Emperor’s True Spirit Palace, the Origin of Destiny, the Qi of the Lofty Perfected’s Harmonious Fusion.*\nThe Emperor’s name: *[redacted]*\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the *Lord of Harmonious Fusion of the Radiant Empyrean* was transformed and born—this Heaven’s Emperor, whose Origin of Destiny and Spirit Palace begin with true qi.\n\nMaster *Dou* of the Western Marchmount’s *Guide to Cultivating the Dao* says: *\"At six months of life, the Six Fluids stabilize the Six Palaces, nourishing the numinous.\"*\n\nThe adept of Dao cultivation, having refined the hun-soul, po-soul, and the Five Viscera to completion, allows the Yang Spirit to ascend and resonate with the qi of the Resonant Transformation Heaven, thereby nourishing its numinosity. Numinosity is qi. \"Harmonious Fusion\" signifies the joyous union of spirit and qi. At this stage, yin turbidity is wholly exhausted, Yang luminosity shines brilliantly, and warmth suffuses like spring.\n\nResonating with the Formless Realm,\nRadiance crowns the Ten Directions.\nThe Wheel of Return leaves no trace,\nDarkly tending toward the Dao-ground.\nThe Spirit-Chariot needs no reins,\nLuminously born in the *Divine Chapter*.\n\nThe \"Formless Realm\" refers to the Heaven of the Formless Realm. \"Radiance crowns the Ten Directions\" means its light illumines all heavens, standing supreme over the ten directions. \"The Wheel of Return leaves no trace\" signifies harmonizing with creation without visible mark. \"Darkly tending toward the Dao-ground\" describes its subtle alignment with the realm of the Great Dao.\n\nThe *Green Mystery Commentary on the Scripture of Salvation* states: \"The beings of the Formless Realm Heaven are wholly purified of dust and defilement, penetrating naturally into subtlety. Their forms are wondrous, now vast, now minute, no longer bound by color or shape, invisible to mortals—hence the name Formless Realm.\" The ode declares:\n*Gradually entering the ancestral school of non-action,*\n*Mind untainted, intent perfectly attuned,*\n*Glancing back to survey the Three Thousand Realms,*\n*All dharmas dissolve into a single emptiness.*\n\nThe first five stanzas of the Jade Chapter expound the *Mandate School*; the latter four, the *Nature School*—teaching one to preserve life and attain longevity, to clarify nature and transcend the mundane.\n\nThe \"Spirit-Chariot,\" as the *Nanhua Scripture* says, is \"to ride the transformations of the Six Qi and wander boundlessly—what need has it for reins?\" Only at this stage does one truly grasp the marvel of the *Divine Chapter*, its luminous truth undeniable.\n\nThe *Elixir Formula* states: \"At the fifth transformation, true Yang wholly transmutes the hun-soul into spirit. At the sixth transformation, true Yin wholly transmutes the po-soul into qi. With hun and po inwardly perfected, one roams at midday without shadow, merging with the sun’s pure Yang. From this point, ghosts and spirits cannot perceive, yin and yang cannot fathom.\"\n\nVast and boundless, the Hollow Cavern,\nEven the Mysterious Effulgence is but a name.\nRefining the embryo to return to the primordial,\nEver riding the Flying Dark Beam.\nThose who seek to hoard and lose their Heavenly Truth,\nScatter their thoughts awaiting the tread of the common.\nSever the stagnation of the womb-tree,\nMind soaring beyond the Upper Capital.\n\nThe Hollow Cavern of the Great Void—how could it have bounds?\n\nThe term \"Mysterious Effulgence is but a name\" signifies that when ghosts and spirits first become human, they differ not from sages and worthies—how could they be deemed weak? Yet through kalpas of birth and death, their Heavenly Truth is withered by the passions and desires, and thus they are no longer strong. The *Feathered Chapters of the Joyous True Beam of the Mysterious* states: \"Beating their wings, they soar through the ninefold firmament, their mournful cries resounding through the Mysterious Beam.\" Knowing them to be birds of heaven, their names diverge from the common. This speaks of the work of refining the embryo to return to the primordial—precisely the effort to gather and settle in stillness, not to lightly take flight like the Mysterious Beam.\n\n*Qí* means \"to wish.\" The *Nanhua Scripture* says: \"The marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not wish to be reared in a cage.\" Though the pheasant’s sustenance in the wild is arduous, it will never desire captivity, where freedom is lost. So too with humans: bound and constrained, pent-up and stagnant, they lose their Heavenly Truth. Only by scattering and releasing their thoughts, treading the common Way, then severing the stagnation of the womb-tree and the dead *qi* of the embryo, can they be utterly unobstructed and ascend in spirit to the Jade Capital.\n\nThe fulfillment of the wish is most profound: awakening to the mystery of mysteries, I forget both principle and self. Supreme blessings arise from the nine heavens, propitious moments converge with earthly seasons. When the wish is fulfilled—awakening to the profound Dao—one accords with one’s original aspiration. Once awakened, all distinctions of right and wrong, self and other, are forgotten. At this point, blessings arrive unbidden, seasons become naturally auspicious—what path is not felicitous?\n\nMerging the transformations to return to the primordial One,\nLoftily conjoined with the Primordial Sovereign.\nI bow my head to the fellowship of the numinous journey,\nForever parting from the clamor and dust of the world.\n\nBlending the *qi* of the Three Origins of creation, one returns to the One, above corresponding to the Primordial Beginning, below presiding over the body. As it is said: \"Though the Heavenly Honored One is distant and wondrous, it is near—bound to the Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace.\" On the day the Dao of immortality is perfected, one also meets with a propitious moment. *Xiè* means \"to sever,\" *xiāo* means \"clamor,\" and *zhāng* means \"to soar.\" From this point onward, one forever severs the clamor of the world and the soaring dust of the mundane.\n\n**Chapter Seven of the *Heavenly Numinous Transformations*: The Birth of the Spirit in the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven**\n*The Purple Qi of Heavenly Qi*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: \"This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, the true Yang.\" The *qi* of the Imperial True Origin Palace and the Life-Source High Immortal of the *Dongji* Cavern. The imperial name is Wuyun-*. The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* says: \"In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of the Jade Rosy Cloud Cavern was born—this Emperor of Heaven, whose true *qi* forms the Origin Palace, the beginning of the life-source.\"\n\nMaster Dou of the Western Marchmount said: \"When a person reaches seven months of age, the seven essences open, and the seven apertures become luminous. The outer ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, and the inner heart orifice all become bright and clear, naturally endowed with awareness. In cultivating the truth, at this seventh transformation, one has already attained the state of the seven awakenings: dark wisdom is thoroughly lucid, the roots and dust are severed, being and non-being are both empty, and the myriad dharmas are extinguished. All kalpas—past and future, the three realms and ten directions, the roots of self and other, past and future—are penetrated in sevenfold and eightfold clarity, pervading above and below, with all principles fully present. Hence it is called the *High Immortal Dongji* Cavern.\"\n\nThe Mysterious Convergence governs without bounds,\nMerging *qi* returns to the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven.\nDuty-Yet labors in numinous transformation,\nSilently advancing through endless seasons.\nRiding the reckoning to forge the steadfast bough,\nSleeve fluttering, brushing light feathers.\nWithin the jade chamber, wondrous tones arise,\nFloating upward to the lofty abode of the gods.\n\nThe Mysterious Convergence is the origin of the myriad Ways, governing the three realms—how could its wondrous function be limited? The merging *qi* blends the soaring Mysterious *qi* to return to the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven, restoring the Great Beginning. *Duty-Yet* is the revered spirit of the Great One, named *Duty-Yet the Gatherer*, who guards the rear gate of the human Mud-Pill Palace. In heaven, it silently operates the transformations, undeterred by cold or heat.\n\n\"Riding the reckoning to forge the steadfast bough\" means that by riding the reckoning of the seven passages, the Yang light congeals and coalesces, the hundred bones become steadfast and firm, like the branches of a tree. \"Sleeve fluttering, brushing light feathers\" signifies the imminent ascent. Then, suddenly, within the nine palaces of the Mud-Pill’s jade chamber, celestial harmonies spontaneously arise, joyous *qi* surges forth, fire dragons and dark cranes dance within the body, and the myriad spirits all ascend to the lofty divine palace. There, they merge with the Heavenly Emperor’s foremost Red Child—this is what is meant by \"within the jade chamber, wondrous tones arise, floating upward to the lofty abode of the gods.\"\n\nThe wheel of perfection turns without cease,\nTrue immortals arrayed in ordered ranks.\nThe highest celestial thoroughfares stretch afar,\nThe profound origin plunges ten thousandfold deep.\nLush leaves shade the kingfisher clouds,\nResting in the shade of the limpid islet.\n\nAccording to the *Perfect Methods of the Numinous Treasure*, this is the method of transcendence. The divine light shines through, penetrating the bodily husk, ascending to the Great Void, and joining the ranks of the true immortals. As for the distant celestial thoroughfares, gazing beside them reveals the cavernous emptiness, the cavernous void of the Great Mystery, the boundless expanse. Below lies a depth of ten thousand measures, yet I alone stand resplendent in the sea of tranquil nature, floating beneath the feathered canopy of lush leaves and kingfisher clouds. Below, I contemplate the limpid islet, serene and ever still.\n\nThe *Eight Yang Songs of the Plain* say:\n\"I soar with my feathered canopy,\nWandering the limpid islet.\nDelighting the five spirits,\nVoicing my thoughts to the radiant companions.\"\n\nThe five difficulties are dispelled by principle,\nThe impassive heart finds its joy.\nThe discourse on transcendence speaks of a single leap, yet if the five *qi*-spirits are not yet adept at emerging, they may come and go intermittently. One wanders and plays to become familiar, or if stray thoughts arise, one whistles and chants to disperse them, so that the hundred spirits all harmonize. The \"radiant companions\" are the spirits within the body.\n\nThe five difficulties remain unsettled in various accounts; perhaps the five demonic emperors still test one’s resolve. They can be dispelled by principle, ensuring the nature of heaven is pure and untainted by the slightest selfish human desire—only then does one accord with the supreme Dao. For in the work of cultivation, transcendence is the ultimate achievement, and the moment of transformation is most vulnerable to demonic trials. Thus, one must be vigilant.\n\nThe luminous soul follows its root,\nDiligent and unwearied, it abides in the void.\nThe seven recitations open the layered gates,\nDissolving stagnation—not through divine martial prowess.\nThe movement issues from within,\nA lofty chant, a bow of reverence.\n\nNature is the spirit of life;\nThe heart is the master of *qi*.\nWith the heart unburdened, the nature of heaven shines bright. One’s own luminous soul abides in the Great Void, diligent and unwearied, never straying from its root.\n\nThe root is the primordial *qi*. Seven passages through the gates and orifices dissolve the dharmakāya, revealing afflictions alone—neither death nor life can become a burden. Without the numinous efficacy of the jade scriptures, how could such swiftness be attained?\n\nThat movement issues from within means what is within must manifest without. The lofty chant and bow of reverence signify a resonant intonation ascending in reverence.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Purity – The Birth of the Divine**\n*Heavenly qi* of azure hue.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, through which yang is communicated. The true *qi* of the Imperial Flowery Mansion, the life-force of the primordial numinous transformation and congealment.\n\nThe Emperor’s name is *Hongji*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Transcendent Congealing Lord of Langxiao was born—this celestial emperor governs the heavens through the true *qi* as the origin of the life-force of the Flowery Mansion.\n\nMaster Dou of the Western Marchmount says: In the eighth month of human gestation, the eight luminous spirits are complete, and the true numen descends. Once the true numen descends, the five viscera also generate their flowery essences.\n\nThe *Great Cavern* has ten flowery gates of the Purple Portal:\n- Heaven One’s essence communicates with the Cinnabar Flower of the Great Prime,\n- Earth Two’s *qi* communicates with the Dark Mystery Azure Flower,\n- Heaven Three’s spirit communicates with the Myriad Births Plain Flower,\n- Earth Four’s brahma communicates with the Ten Directions Yellow Flower,\n- Heaven Five’s origin communicates with the Jade Flower of the Great Clarity,\n- Earth Six’s origin communicates with the Nether Yin Metal Flower,\n- Heaven Seven’s origin communicates with the Great Mystery Green Flower,\n- Earth Eight’s origin communicates with the Highest Clarity Azure Flower,\n- Heaven Nine’s origin communicates with the Jade Void Jade Flower,\n- Earth Ten’s *xuan* communicates with the Jade Clarity, the Primal Chaos of the Great Non-Being.\n\nThe ten flowers connect to the void—this is the *qi* of the true numen’s transformation and congealment.\n\nIn the luminous clarity of the layered heavens above,\nThe appointed meeting is at the edge of auspicious clouds.\nThe jade scriptures disperse into the soaring heart,\nThe solitary radiance seeks the numinous assembly.\n\nThe Emperor of the Heaven of Luminous Clarity resides in the layered heavens above—this must be a heaven beyond the formless realm. Meeting with the various heavens at the edge of auspicious clouds, one recites the jade scriptures to arouse the unfettered spirit, dispersing the soaring and free heart.\n\nAuspicious clouds are neither smoke nor clouds—they are the wondrous *qi* of supreme harmony.\n\nMaster Sima the Perfected says: The solitary radiance is the character of the Flowery Mansion, the lord who convenes the assembly of the numinous mansion.\n\nScattering radiance and rosy clouds spread,\nNo spirit’s lapel fails to transcend.\nJade branches flow with ethereal sounds,\nLeisurely in the void, wondrous words arise.\n\nThese all describe the scenery of the heavens. The scattering radiance refers to the vibrant, intermingling hues of rosy clouds. *Jin* (lapel) is synonymous with *jin* (collar), signifying that the heart’s expanse is without exception transcendent. The ethereal sounds of jade branches—are these not the winds of heaven stirring the soaring forests?\n\nThe *Great Cavern*’s verses contain: *\"Mysterious songs disperse the soaring lapel, jade branches flow with ethereal sounds.\"* This precisely refers to the wondrous conversations of the assembly of perfected immortals, who together discourse on the profound principle.\n\nNuminous sounds vibrate through the empty cavern,\nThe nine mysteries depart from dark descendants.\nWith clarity and vigor, no stagnation remains,\nComing and going like untying a sash.\n\nHaving awakened to the birth of the divine chapter,\nOne soars high without ultimate defeat.\nOnce a cultivator has transcended the self,\nThey should extend the merit of the divine scriptures—\nAbove, repaying the nine mysteries,\nBelow, aiding the obscured souls—\nAll are enabled to hear the scriptures and suddenly awaken,\nMoving freely, no longer fettered by karmic obstructions.\nComing and going in life and death is like loosening a belt.\n\nYet an elder once said: *\"Arriving is like putting on a staff, departing is like removing trousers.\"* This speaks of having nothing to cling to. If one can truly awaken to the profound subtleties of the jade scriptures and achieve the work of transcendence, then the true nature endures forever, unharmed through kalpas.\n\nMysterious radiance illuminates the clouded thoroughfare,\nTraces transcend beyond the divine directions.\nResponsive and perceptive, without fixed form,\nOne casually moves the four great elements.\nWith focused heart, bowing and reciting,\nAll sages together praise with delight.\n\nThe mysterious radiance is the name of a dragon. The perfected one rides the dragon to ascend to heaven, its light illuminating the clouded thoroughfare. Their traces transcend beyond the divine directions, for their transformed dharmakāya can respond and perceive without fixed form.\n\nMoving the four great elements refers to circulating through the four heavens of the formless realm.\n\n*\"Together praise with delight\"*—the Feathered Transcendent Lord once said: *\"Today, tomorrow—what a pity, what a pity! When the great limit arrives, what power will you have? You cannot rely on mere words, nor on ink on paper. When the sages of the ten directions nod their heads, that is when the cultivator truly attains.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment – The Birth of the Divine**\n*Heavenly qi* of black hue.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, through which yang begins to sprout. The true *qi* of the Imperial Marchmount Mansion, the life-force of the naturally mysterious illumination.\n\nThe Emperor’s name is *Lingji*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Mysterious Illumination Lord of Shenxiao was born—this celestial emperor governs the heavens through the true *qi* as the origin of the life-force of the Marchmount Mansion.\n\nMaster Lü of Floating Mountain says: This is the heaven of the seed people above the formless realm. The original nature of humans is profoundly clear and empty, like the great void, admitting nothing. Deluded thoughts and attachments are like flowers in the sky; the cycle of birth and death is like knots forming in emptiness. If one can return to the root and restore the origin, not a single thought arising, all conditions suddenly ceasing, one is then born into this heaven and begins to become indestructible.\n\nFor those who cultivate the truth, it begins with overcoming thoughts and culminates in thoughtlessness. When all yin influences are dissolved and the true nature is perfectly luminous, one decisively transcends the three realms—this is the indestructible true emptiness, the supreme dharmakāya.\n\nThe Left Attendant Perfected says: The Marchmount Mansion is the human skull. When the form is first complete at birth, there must be a numen to govern it. With the numen, there is the origin; with the origin, there is the flower; with the flower, life begins. The Marchmount is the gate through which all spirits enter and exit, and it must be fully formed before the skull can solidify it. In infants, this is the fontanelle. As the *qi* returns to nourish the root, it becomes the dwelling of all spirits—this is called the numinous. It is so named because its numinosity can reflect downward, hence \"illumination.\"\n\nWithout knots, truly without emotion,\nIn profound profundity, the void settles.\nThe wheel of transformation has no fixed sequence,\nIts reckoning neither adheres nor deviates.\n\nThe perfected one is indifferent and detached, the heart without knots, the nature without emotional movement. Serene and settled, they do not follow the sequence of cyclic transformation, nor do they deviate from the changes of yin and yang.\n\nWho says the realm of formlessness is level?\nLofty and towering, it brims with hills and mounds.\nWith a stilled heart, one may roam freely,\nYet only through the summons of the Three Clarities may the spirit ascend in purity.\n\nSuch an encounter is not measured in years,\nNor can kalpas fathom its reckoning.\nThe formless realm is the境 of the Upper Clarity.\nWho claims this land is flat? It too is shaped by *qi*,\nits high ridges and vast mounds like the jade peaks of the celestial capital, towering and grand—yet still one may ascend and gaze upon them.\nIf the seeker of immortality wishes to still the heart and wander freely,\nthey must await the summons of the Three Clarities to reach that place—\ntruly a rare encounter of a thousand ages.\n\nThe floating *shuang* follows its destined path,\nRebirth from the womb is an eternal principle.\nWhen the numinous stirs the Great Void,\nOne strides upon the frost of the empyrean.\nThe celestial ford stirs ten thousand currents,\nAs the hidden spirit ascends in true stillness.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow;\nFrom the lofty vantage, one bows and ascends.\n\nThe floating *shuang* returning to the womb refers to the *Dadong Jing*,\nwhere myriad ancestors across kalpas—kin bound by *qi*—\ndissolve their lingering attachments and together attain rebirth.\nFor descendants and forebears share the same *qi*;\nwhen one’s own body transcends, ancestors too may return to the womb and become immortals—\nthis is the natural principle, why doubt it?\nMoreover, the spirit within the body is the Three Ones of the Grand Tenuity,\nin perfect resonance with the Great Void, soaring freely above the frigid heights of the empyrean.\n\nWhen the celestial ford stirs ten thousand currents, it is the Milky Way one crosses.\nAs the Lady of Purple Tenuity says:\n*\"The dark waves shake the azure tides,\nThe vast ford stirs ten thousand currents,\nI ride the light, gazing upon the Six Voids,\nYearning to wander with the fair one.\"*\n\nThough one may ascend to celestial immortality,\none must still concentrate the spirit and refine the true,\ncleansing all attachments to love—\nonly then may one attain perfect freedom.\nThus we know that love is the root of sorrow.\nWithout love, there is no sorrow.\n\nIt is said that the nature of humanity is originally pure,\nserene as still water, unstained by even a speck of dust—\nthus it endures across kalpas.\nBut once tainted by love, delusion’s clouds obscure the sky,\nkarmic winds churn the waters,\nand purity is lost forever.\nLove gives rise to desire, desire to affliction,\na tangle of false thoughts, ceaseless toil,\nthe convergence of all suffering.\nOne drifts through the waves of the sea of desire,\ntrapped in the cycle of birth and death without end,\nwhile karmic consciousness flourishes and hells arise.\n\nThe seven emotions and six desires all harm the nature—\nwhy single out love?\nYet love is the sprout of karmic conditions,\nthe ladder and go-between of passions and desires.\nIts poison is sweet and soft, beguiling the unwary,\nseeping deeper day by day, binding ever more tightly.\nWithout wisdom, courage, and steadfast resolve—\nwithout awakening to the eternal truth—\nwho can sever it?\nThe nine chapters’ work, from self-cultivation and embryo refinement to final ascension,\ncompletes the task.\nYet love is still spoken of here,\nlest one grow complacent, mistaking it for the norm,\nunaware that it is the root of eternal sorrow and suffering.\nEven the slightest trace, if not scoured clean, bars liberation.\nThus the sage, in the final chapter, draws back the bolt and turns the key—\nthe meaning is profound.\nAs for gazing upon the celestial thoroughfare and bowing in ascent,\nthis awaits those yet to come.\n\n**Ode of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One**\n*To the Divine and Serene Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate*\n\nThough the Great Dao has no heart,\nIt may be sought with devotion.\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*\"I know not its name, so I style it ‘Dao,’\nAnd by force call it ‘Great.’\"*\nIf the Dao itself is nameless,\nhow could it possess a heart?\nYet those who seek the Dao cannot do so without devotion.\n\nI halt my spirit-chariot in the emptiness,\nGazing back at the azure currents, vast as motes of dust—\nlike the poet who called himself *\"a grain of millet in the boundless sea.\"*\nThe Three Realms are the realms of desire, form, and formlessness.\nWhen body and mind transcend these,\npure and luminous, unbound,\none may wander the Jade Capital.\n\nWithout a heaven-sent stalwart to guide the way,\nWho can fathom these mysteries?\nThe Milky Way stretches, clear and boundless,\nIn reverence, one moves through the void’s softness.\nWithout such a heaven-born, destiny-appointed talent,\nwho could grasp this subtle truth?\nIn the space between heaven and earth, the greatest joy resides.\nThe void is the form of heaven;\nsoftness, the nature of earth.\n\nThe seven *xuan* disperse the dark night,\nReturning to the womb, one follows the ebb and flow.\nThe seven *xuan* are the seven *po*.\nRebirth through womb-breathing follows the rise and fall of yin and yang.\n\nIf one’s destiny is hidden and still,\nEven the calamities of the *yang* nine hold no terror.\nThe cycles of life and death, the disasters of the *yang* nine—\nif one’s fate is fixed in silent stillness,\nif one can conceal one’s light and concentrate the spirit,\nthere is nothing to fear.\nAs the *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Abide in timeliness, follow the natural order,\nAnd sorrow and joy cannot enter.\"*\n\nBeholding the meetings of departure and return,\nOne lingers but a while.\nCast aside the self, and the self endures—\nSuch is the company of true immortals.\nThe Perfected One observes how swiftly life and death pass,\nhow fleeting the respite before death.\nOne must strive in cultivation,\nfreeing the heart from all within and without—\nonly then is the true preserved.\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*\"Cast aside the self, and the self endures.\"*\nSuch a one is surely the true companion of immortals.\n\nStill and deep, the mysteries of the profound,\nClear and boundless, the waves of the Milky Way.\nChange and decay follow one another in endless cycles,\nYet the *chun* tree’s branches remain unchanged.\nThe mysteries of the profound are like the Milky Way’s ceaseless flow.\nThe cycles of birth and death are the suffering of an unending wheel,\nbut those who attain the Dao stand apart,\nlike the great *chun* tree, untouched by the blooming and withering of lesser plants.\nThough frost and stars pass by, its branches and leaves remain unaltered.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Life and death are great matters,\nYet they cannot change one who is beyond change.\"*\n\nStill the heart and contemplate the utmost truth,\nFollow the *qi*’s movements, escape the net of doubt.\nWhen resonance and principle are ever in accord,\nThe spirit attains its proper course and departs.\nStill the heart and contemplate the utmost truth—\nthis is the resolve to seek the Dao.\n*Luo* is the net.\nFollow the movements of yin and yang’s *qi*,\nescape the snares of doubt,\nand when resonance and principle are in harmony,\nthe spirit naturally attains its proper path and departs.\n\n\"To depart\" is to go forth—\nnowhere it goes that is not open.\nWandering in stillness, boundless at first,\nyet tangled thoughts stir the nine distances.\nFlying roots scatter dark leaves,\nbut when principle returns, there is no other.\n\nLet the heart roam in stillness,\nunite *qi* with the Han’s flow—\nwhat limit to this joy?\nWhen tangled thoughts arise,\na single thought drifts to the nine distances,\nlike a tree’s roots and karma scattering in flight.\nYet nurture them, and roots grow deep, stems firm.\nWhen human thoughts are tangled,\nstill the mind and the spirit returns, *qi* gathers—\nall is self-wrought, not from without.\n\nRecite the jade verses,\nand their dark tones pierce clouds and rosy dawn.\nIn the *jiashen* flood’s calamity,\nwith wings outstretched, one reaches the Queen Mother’s home.\nEver reciting, savoring the Way’s richness,\nlips attuned to creation’s workings,\nthe spirit soars above the Jasper Pool—\nhow then could the flood bring rest?\n\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Great floods rise to the heavens yet do not drown.\"*\n\nEternally abiding, without end,\nwho knows the measure of kalpas?\nWith the Dao as one’s body,\nneither born nor destroyed,\none endures forever in the Great Void.\n\n*Commentary

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* from the *Dongxuan Lingbao***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the* Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine *from the* Dongxuan Lingbao\n**Author:** Hua Yangfu of the Yuan dynasty\n**Volumes:** Three\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan* Section, Jade Instructions Category\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the Commentary on the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Jade Chapters on Generating the Divine***\n\nThe *Jade Chapters on Generating the Divine* are how the Supreme Thearch proclaims the virtue of cherishing life. Thus, all methods of refining the sacred, blending the primordial, and ascending at dawn are fully encompassed within it. Yet its purport transcends the mundane, and its language is not of this world—without transmission and commentary, it is not easily understood.\n\nI have heard that the Daoist of Mount Heng, Xue Youqi; the Supreme Clarity Attendant, Li Shaowei; and the Western Florescence Master, Cheng Xuanying—all transmitted teachings that penetrated the profound and investigated the subtle, though I have never seen their works. Later commentators were many, but only Wang Yinxian, Xiao Zhenyou, and the Perfected of Floating Mountain offered explanations that were particularly thorough. However, their interpretations sometimes differed, leaving readers unable to reconcile them and even leading to doubts.\n\nFor instance, regarding the cyclical renewal of the *jiashen* era, the matter is difficult to verify, yet some delve into obscure and recondite theories, startling the world and confounding custom—this is how such transmissions arise.\n\nThe divine is the numinous aspect of *qi*, riding the interplay of *yin* and *yang*, wielding transformation, circulating above and below, throughout the four directions, without obstruction. The heavens move through the four seasons, generating the myriad things. The divine person traverses great floods, reaching the heavens without drowning; treads upon scorched earth without burning; rides clouds and commands the wind—nothing can harm them. All this is the work of this divine *qi*.\n\nFor all people, when the divine *qi* gathers, life arises; when it scatters, death follows. The *Nine Chapters* take \"generating the divine\" as their title—its meaning is profound indeed.\n\nOld commentaries number perhaps dozens, but the loftier ones verge on the abstruse, while the lesser ones cling to vulgar interpretations, leaving me sighing in regret. Recently, a visitor from Wu presented me with Hua Yangfu’s commentary. Upon examining its general intent, I found that it harmonizes the strengths of various interpretations, blending them into one. Drawing from the *Lingbao* and *Huangting* scriptures, it elucidates the Dao of cinnabar, making the profound simple and easily visible—like floating clouds clearing to reveal the bright moon hanging in the sky, leaving one with perfect clarity.\n\nAh! This commentary is a guide for those who study the Dao. How could its significance be merely about words? There must be superior scholars who diligently practice it, embodying what our Laozi spoke of.\n\nWritten on the fifth day after the Double Fifth Festival in the *renshen* year of the Zhishun era,\n**Zhang Shouqing of Mount Wudang, the Perfected of Mysterious Response and Supreme Harmony, Founder of the Palace of Subtle Transformation in Supreme Clarity**\n\n---\n\n### **Commentary on the** *Scripture of the Natural Nine Heavens’ Chapters on Generating the Divine* **from the** *Dongxuan Lingbao*, **Volume One**\n**Annotated by Hua Yangfu**\n\n*Dong* means \"void.\" *Xuan* means \"profound and distant.\" Only the void can contain all wonders; only the profound and distant can give its meaning depth and endurance.\n\n*Lingbao* (\"Numinous Treasure\") refers outwardly to the wondrous and weighty transformations of the sacred, and inwardly to the divine descending as the numinous and *qi* gathering as the treasure. Among the Three Treasures in the scripture, only *Lingbao* is singled out to mark the time when the book emerged to deliver humanity.\n\n*Natural* refers to the original Three *Qi*, which appeared in response to the times, congealing in the great void. Phoenix scripts and dragon chapters took form without trace—naturally becoming patterns, not crafted by the intentional design of sages.\n\nThe *Nine Heavens* are the nine heavens from *Yushan Wu-liang* to *Wu-jie Wu-ai*. *Generating the divine* is the method of nurturing transformation and change.\n\nA *scripture* is a book that carries the Dao, the path of cultivating the true.\n\n---\n\n### **The Golden Book of the Three Treasures in the Great Abundance**\n\nThe *Three Treasures* are the Heavenly Treasure, the Numinous Treasure, and the Divine Treasure. *Great Abundance* is the name of a heavenly palace. The *Scripture of Deliverance* states: \"The Wondrous Court of Great Abundance\"—speaking of the heavenly palace’s abundance, beyond which nothing can be added. This book was once secretly stored in this palace. Gold is the most precious and indestructible, hence its use here.\n\nIts text comprises nine chapters, tracing their origins.\n\nThe *Heavenly Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Great Cavern*. The *Heavenly Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the *Hundun Taiwu Yuan* and the *Supreme Void King*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion *qi*. Later, in the first year of the *Longhan* era, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born of transformation. At the time of the book’s emergence, he was titled *Supreme Great Abundance Jade Clarity Palace*.\n\nThe *Heavenly Treasure Lord* is the *Jade Clarity Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy*, originally congealed from the *qi* of the *Mystic Unity*. The highest is called *Heaven*; that which governs above is called *Thearch*. The Dao precedes the Thearch, hence it is called the *Primordial Beginning*. In the human body, it is the *Supreme Unity Emperor Lord*, the primordial spirit.\n\nThe *Great Cavern* is the origin of the teachings’ authority. *Elder* is a title of reverence, noble yet without rank. When the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born of transformation, the name was first established.\n\n*Hundun Taiwu Yuan* refers to the form of the *Jade Void Heaven* before the primordial chaos was split. The number nine corresponds to the *yang* of *Qian*. The *Chart of Opening Transformation* states: \"First is *Longhan*, second is *Yankang*, third is *Chiming*, fourth is *Shanghuang*, fifth is *Kaihuang*\"—all names of past kalpas in the heavens. *Long* means \"numinous,\" and *Han* means \"heaven.\"\n\nThe *emergence of the book* refers to the *Scripture of Deliverance*’s five texts opening and expanding, universally planting the divine spirits. The *Jade Clarity Palace* is the abode of the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s mysterious seat. The *ancestral qi* is the Dao, and the Dao is the Heavenly Treasure Lord. Tracing its origins, the wondrous root is self-formed, with no ancestor above it. It takes emptiness and nothingness as its master, spontaneity as its foundation, enduring without governing, formless and nameless. When the sage establishes teachings, they cannot but honor its source, hence they force a name upon it as the ancestor of the Dao.\n\nThe *Numinous Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Cavern Mystery*. The *Numinous Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Elder is the *qi* of the *Chi-hun Taiwu Yuan* and the *Supreme Purple Void*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad *qi* of darkness. Later, at the opening of the *Longhan* chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born of transformation. After one kalpa, in the first year of the *Chiming* era, at the time of the book’s emergence to deliver humanity, he was titled *Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace*.\n\n*Purple Void* follows the Zhao edition.",

      "translated_text": "The *Numinous Treasure Lord* is the *Celestial Worthy of Supreme Clarity*. From the One, the Two arises, becoming the *qi* of the *Primordial One*. \"Numinous\" signifies the wondrous and unfathomable. The *Cavern Mystery* scriptures and the *Numinous Treasure* teachings all emerge from the *Great Cavern*. According to the *Preface to the Collected Scriptures* in the *Canon*: the *Cavern Mystery* is the root, while the *Numinous Treasure* is its trace. The *qi* of the *Great Cavern* originally arises from emptiness, flowing into *Cavern Perfection*, then into *Cavern Mystery*, and further into *Cavern Spirit*. The preceding chapter refers to it not as *Cavern Perfection* but as the *Great Cavern*, speaking of its origin. *Chi-hun Taiwu Yuan* signifies that within the *Supreme Void*, the light and images have already begun to sprout, soon to manifest. From the *Longhan* chart’s opening, its traces were faintly revealed; by the *Chiming* era, when the scriptures emerged to deliver humanity, the civilizing influence first became radiant. *Chiming* and *Purple Void* describe the luminous and resplendent appearance of the *Cavern Yang*. \"Delivering humanity\" refers to the transmission of scriptural teachings, all of which are the Dao of rescuing beings from the cycle of birth and death. The *Purple Tenuity Palace* is where the *Numinous Treasure Lord* expounds the teachings and stores the scriptures. Compared to the *Jade Void*, its *qi* is diminished by nine hundred million myriad, thus one knows that as kalpas descend and epochs shift, it scatters into the ten thousand existences, no longer resembling the primordial undifferentiated state.\n\nThe sage’s intent in revealing these scriptures was to fear that later ages would grow shallow and frivolous, pursuing superficialities, deceit, and cunning, cutting short their Heaven-bestowed years, drifting endlessly in the sea of suffering. Thus, he wished to return them to purity and restore their roots, valuing *qi* and securing their foundation to advance the immortal Dao. Therefore, he revealed the divine chapters, earnestly admonishing and awakening them—no virtue could be greater.\n\nThe *Spirit Treasure Lord* is the revered deity of the *Cavern Spirit*. The *Spirit Treasure Elder* is the ancestral *qi* of the *Spirit Treasure Lord*. The Elder is the *qi* of *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, Primordial Non-Being, and Supreme Clarity Void*, numbering ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety million *qi*. Later, in the first year of the *Chiming* era, the *Spirit Treasure Lord* was born of transformation. After two kalpas, in the first year of the *Shanghuang* era, when the scriptures emerged, he was titled *Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Palace of Pure Void*, following the Zhao edition.\n\nThe *Spirit Treasure Lord* is the *Celestial Worthy of Supreme Purity*. From the Two, the Three arises, becoming the *qi* of the *Primal One*. \"Spirit\" is the name for the unfathomable transformations of yin and yang. The *Cavern Spirit* teachings expound the Dao of *Supreme Clarity*’s *Great Peace* and *non-action*. Its revered scriptures comprise twelve sections, with additional texts such as the *Purple Void Register*, *Disaster Dispelling and Calamity Averting*, and *Pure Tranquility Heavenly Youth*, all belonging to this tradition. *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, Primordial [Non-Being]* describe a state of thoughtless non-action, serene and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated. The original text lacked the character *Primordial*; Wang Yinxian later added it to complete the *Three Primordials*. *Pure Void* refers to the light and clarity of Heaven. Compared to *Chi-hun*, its *qi* is further diminished by ninety myriad, growing ever more attenuated with descent. The *Great Ultimate Palace* is the immortal realm of *Supreme Clarity*. All immortals who attain the Dao, observe the precepts, and present petitions gather here to pay homage. Within the palace, the officials, perfected ones, and immortal ministers stand in solemn order.\n\nWithin the *Great Cavern* teachings, there are the *Three Primordial Palaces*. The *Celestial Worthy* once commanded Generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou to guard and purify the palace gates. These deities correspond above to the *Three Qi* and below to the three regions of the human body. In Heaven, they assist the pivotal mechanisms of the Northern Dipper and govern talismans, sacred writings, covenants, and registers. When one’s cultivation of the *Great Cavern*’s practices is complete, these three deities guide one’s ascension to pay homage at the imperial palace—this is the Dao of primordial unity.\n\nDuring the *Zhihe* era of the Song dynasty, Emperor Renzong fell ill and dreamed he wandered through thorns, lost and bewildered. He saw a divine figure clad in golden armor, who said to him: \"Heaven grants Your Majesty twelve more years of life for your benevolent heart.\" The emperor asked, \"By what path may I return?\" The divine figure replied, \"I shall send you with my chariot.\" The emperor mounted the chariot and inquired who the deity was. The reply came: \"Your subject is General Ge.\" Upon awakening, the emperor recovered and ordered the *Daoist Canon* to be searched. Indeed, General Ge was recorded as presiding over the Heavenly Gate. The emperor then elevated his rank and established a temple for him in the capital. It is regrettable that at the time, no one memorialized this deity, who corresponds to the *qi* of one’s own body, to enhance the practice of nurturing life.\n\nThough these three titles differ in name and era, their essence is one. They divide into the *Primordial*, *Mysterious*, and *Initial* *Three Qi* to govern. The *Three Treasures* are the revered deities of the *Three Qi*, giving rise to the *Three Qi*, and the three titles together generate the *Nine Qi*. The *Nine Qi* emerge before the *Great Void*, concealed within the empty cavern, without light or image, form or name, color or trace, sound or voice.\n\nThe three titles correspond to the *Three Clarities*’ palaces. The \"eras\" refer to the five kalpas of transformation. Though their names differ, their principle is one. From the *Mysterious One*’s *qi*, the *Heavenly Treasure* was born; later, it divided into the *Primordial One* and *Initial One* *qi*, becoming the *Numinous Treasure* and *Spirit Treasure*. Once the *Three Qi* are complete, they generate the *Nine Qi*, and the *Nine Qi* scatter into the ten thousand *qi* to establish the roots of living beings.\n\nBefore the *Nine Qi* emerged, their light was submerged and their traces obscured, merging indistinguishably into one—beyond governance or inquiry. Guiding the cosmos and governing the world, they opened the mysterious and interconnected, the three hues of chaos flickering in and out of existence. As the revolutions of destiny reached their limit, the *Three Qi* radiated light. The *qi* clarified and ascended, accumulating into yang to form Heaven; the *qi* congealed and settled, accumulating into stagnation to form Earth. The *Nine Qi* arrayed in order, giving rise to the sun, moon, stars, the five agents, yin and yang, and all people and creatures—all receiving life and completion.\n\nFrom the One dividing into Three comes the *Spirit Treasure Lord*, who governs the *qi* of *Mysterious Tranquility, Profound Communication, and Primordial Non-Being*, guiding yin and yang to accomplish the work of transformation and overseeing the life and death of the world’s people. The *three hues* are the *Mysterious Qi* (azure), the *Primordial Qi* (yellow), and the *Initial Qi* (white). Before the *Three Qi* divided, they flickered between existence and non-existence, their mechanisms already foreshadowed, soon to emerge with the turning of destiny. After their division, Heaven and Earth were established in their positions, and people and creatures arose accordingly—here one sees that Heaven, Earth, and humanity all emerge from the Dao.\n\nThe myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, without the nurturing of the *Three Primordials* or the guidance of the *Nine Qi*, could not come into being. The *Three Qi* are the lords of Heaven and Earth, the *Nine Qi* are the roots of the ten thousand things. Thus, the union of the Three completes virtue—this is the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "The *Three Primordials* and *Three Qi* are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth, hence their revered status. They transform and give rise to the *Nine Qi*, which govern the movements of yin and yang and nurture the ten thousand kinds—thus they are called the roots. The *Threefold Union* refers to the congealing and merging of the *Three Qi*, whose transformations are boundless, and from which the virtue of generation and completion arises. The meaning of *ultimate* aligns with the *Great Ultimate*, the convergence and pivot of yin-yang and the Five Phases.\n\nWhen a person receives life within the womb, the *Three Primordials* nurture and sustain, while the *Nine Qi* shape the form. Thus, after nine months, the spirits are arrayed, the qi is full, and the voice emerges. With the voice, the spirit is complete, and the Nine Heavens rejoice. The *Grand Unity* holds the talisman, the *Imperial Lord* ranks and commands, the *Director of Destinies* records and inscribes, the *Life-Span Decreer* fixes the allotment, the *Five Emperors* oversee birth, the *Holy Mother* guards the chamber, and the deities of Heaven and Earth, along with the guardians of the Three Realms, all stand vigil. The *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* stands in the courtyard, facing east, and recites the *Ninefold Treasured Scripture of the Birth of Spirits* nine times. If the child is male, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; if female, they chant in devotion. If male, the *Director of Destinies* responds with respect; if female, with compliance. Only then is the child born. If the *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* does not issue the *Mandate Scripture*, and the myriad spirits do not chant their reverent responses, birth cannot occur.\n\nHumans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings, endowed with the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. Before birth, they dwell in profound obscurity, and only through transformation do they enter the mother’s womb to become human. The *Three Primordials* distribute qi to form the *Three Fields*, which govern the entire body. The qi of the Nine Heavens sequentially coalesce to form the hun and po souls, the five viscera, and the hundred bones, giving rise to the complete person. By the time nine months—two hundred seventy days—have passed, the *three nines* are complete, and the child separates from the mother’s form. At this moment, voice, form, spirit, and qi are all perfected, and the work of the *Birth of Spirits* in the Nine Heavens is finally accomplished. How could this not be cause for celebration?\n\nAccording to the *Mysterious Mirror*, the *Grand Unity* is the great master of long life, the *Great Unity* of the *Supreme Clarity* and *Great Cavern*, who holds the talisman to unite the hundred spirits. The *Imperial Lord* is the *Lord of the Myriad Spirits*, who determines rank and status. The *Director of Destinies* is the *Central Elder*, named *Li Mingchu*, styled *Xuandu Qing*. The *Life-Span Decreer* predetermines longevity or early death. The *Five Emperors* are the lords of the Five Phases, who bestow the true qi of the Five Phases upon the body. The *Holy Mother* is the *Holy Mother of the Nine Heavens*, the supreme yin ruler, who delights in the completion of beings and thus wards off inauspicious influences. The *Marshal of the Nine Heavens* is entrusted with guarding the jade scriptures and, facing east, recites the scriptures to invoke the qi of generation. The myriad spirits chanting reverence or devotion, like the presentation of jade scepters or tiles to distinguish male and female, are as such. If the *Marshal* does not issue the *Mandate Scripture*, then the Mandate of Heaven is not bestowed. If the myriad spirits do not chant their reverent responses, then the Principle of Heaven does not flow. How, then, could birth occur?\n\nThat a person comes to life is by no means easily obtained. Should one not strive to advance in the virtuous Way to preserve what Heaven has bestowed? The *True Master of Mount Float* said: When a person does good, the yang spirits rejoice, saying, “Today we celebrate, for this person aligns with Heaven.” If one does evil, the spirits mourn, saying, “We have lost the mandate previously bestowed upon this person, and together we shall fall into the dark yin.” Su Dongpo’s poem to Chen Lüchang on *Refraining from Killing* reads: “Have you not seen Wang Wuzi? Before his death, the spirits already wept.” This expresses the same sentiment.\n\nThe *Mandate Scripture* is what Heaven bestows as destiny, as the *Book of Documents* says: “Only the August Lord-on-High bestows the centeredness upon the people below.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: “What Heaven imparts is called *nature*.” Though Heaven does not speak, it entrusts the work of creation to the jade scriptures, hence the term *Mandate Scripture*. For a person to return and be born into the human realm, to bathe in the form of the Great Yang, is an event so momentous it startles Heaven and Earth—its value is beyond measure. The true spirits of Heaven and Earth, along with the deities of the Three Realms, all attend, for this is no trivial matter. Even at the moment of birth, it is not to be considered insignificant. Therefore, one should cherish one’s form, preserve one’s spirit, honor one’s qi, and secure one’s roots, so as never to die or decay, and thus attain immortality. With flesh and bones ascending together, one mounts to the *Three Clarities*, aligning virtue with the *Three Qi* and uniting with the *Nine Qi*. Yet, though born human, one may fail to revere one’s qi, honor one’s form, treasure one’s life, or cherish one’s spirit, thereby bringing about death and decay, and severing oneself from one’s original true nature.\n\nHumans experience life and death, but nature itself knows no life or death. Those who transcend life and death have surely heard the Dao or perceived their nature. Ordinary people, their habitual tendencies unremoved, are bound by karma, lingering in the dark yin, or locked in mutual retribution. Once the karmic debt is exhausted and the virtuous nature remains unperished, they may return to the human realm, but only after bathing in the Great Yang do they enter the womb. Above the sun lies a dwelling called the *Palace of Cavern Yang*, a pool of flowing fire containing the *True Water of Yellow Blossoms*. The divine beings there use this water to bathe their bodies. The *Documents of Long Life* speak of the *Yellow Blossom Washing the Form*—this is what it refers to. From attaining human birth, through so many stages, startling Heaven and Earth—how could this be considered trivial? If one can refine and nurture the original spirit, return to the root and restore purity, merging with the *Three Qi* and *Nine Qi*, then the principle of ascending with flesh and bones to the *Three Clarities* is within reach. Yet, failing to exert oneself and thus falling into death and decay—how lamentable!\n\nIn the past, Minister Ouyang Wenzhong, though he did not pursue the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi throughout his life, in his later years, while guarding the Bo She, suddenly gained insight. One day, he sought the Dao from the hermit Shi Tang. The hermit replied: “Your dwelling is already in ruins; it is difficult to speak of such matters now. If you can only clarify your past circumstances, there may yet be hope.” Though Minister Ouyang’s literary and official achievements crowned his generation, did he lack the capacity to receive the Dao? He merely missed the opportunity too late. Nevertheless, the work of attaining the Dao lies in awakening the nature, and one must cultivate the foundation of life as the root. If one cannot revere qi, honor form, preserve life, or cherish spirit, and thus allows decline to set in, with mercury dried and lead exhausted, the foundation of life eroded and the true nature obscured—then, to undertake cultivation at such a time is like digging a well when thirsty. Is it not too late?",

      "translated_text": "The *Nine Heavens’ Chapter of Generating Spirits* is the resonant sound formed by the triune fusion of the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, a sacred text that coalesces the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names within its hidden rhythm. It is the natural scripture through which *qi* generates form. The *Flying Mystery* refers to the primordial *qi* of the Originator soaring through the Great Void, merging the Three Caverns into written revelation, its tones harmonizing like metal and stone, gathering the ceaseless creative intent of Heaven and Earth. Within it lie the inner names of the hundred spirits; when recited, the spirits hear their names called and assemble to commune with the divine.\n\nThe *Jade Pivot Scripture* states:\n*\"The nine numina within the body—why not summon them?

To invoke them is blessed.\"*\n\nReciting it as the *Heavenly Treasure* opens the radiance of Heaven and Earth.\nReciting it as the *Numinous Treasure* awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night.\nReciting it as the *Spiritual Treasure* commands the ten thousand spirits.\nReciting it as the *Grand Unity* equips the body’s gods.\nReciting it as the *Imperial Lord* shapes the form.\nReciting it as the *Nine Heavens* generates humanity.\nReciting it as the *Learned Adept* ascends to Heaven.\n\nWhen the Lords of the Three Treasures recite the Jade Chapter, they proclaim the wonders of the Dao. The *Grand Unity* is the Primordial Lady of the Grand Unity; the *Imperial Lord* is the Sovereign Lord of the Grand Unity. Though the Jade Chapter is one, those who recite it differ, and according to their virtue and power, the transformations and responses they evoke vary in depth.\n\nWhen ghostly spirits hear it, they ascend and advance.\nWhen ordinary mortals hear it, they endure and abide.\nWhen imprisoned souls hear it, they are liberated and delivered.\nWhen withered husks hear it, they emit smoke and revive.\nWhen infants hear it, they gain speech.\nWhen dead remains hear it, they return to life.\n\nThe *ghostly spirits* are ghostly officials. The *Flying Immortal’s Sword Scripture* records that Xiao Miao, a man of talent and renown, became a stalwart ghost and served four hundred years before ascending to rule the underworld. Now, upon hearing this scripture, he need not wait for his term to end, for he may hope for promotion and advancement.\n\nThe *ordinary mortals* are those possessed of the six desires; through the scripture, they attain purity and stillness, and thus may endure in the world. The *imprisoned souls* are ghosts confined in the hells of darkness; upon hearing the scripture, they are fortunate to be liberated, as was Zhang Lihua, who entreated the recitation of the Jade Chapter for deliverance.\n\nThe *withered husks* are rotting wood and dead grass. *Emitting smoke* signifies the revival of primordial *qi*. The Reverted Immortal of Yueyang City’s south used cinnabar to restore an ancient tree—this is the same principle. When *infants gain speech*, their orifices open and their faculties sharpen. When *dead remains return to life*, it is as when Xu Jia, reduced to dry bones, was revived by the Lord Lao with the *Great Mystery’s Life Talisman*—this is the same truth.\n\nThe Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of all myriad beings.

      "translated_text": "The Jade Chapter is prized by the Three Eminent Lords; its efficacy serves as the root of all myriad beings’ generation. Tracing its profound principles, even spirits and gods, though numinous, cannot fathom them—how much less can ordinary mortals?\n\nThose who study the supreme Dao aspire to transcendence as immortals. Upon attaining *corpse liberation*, they escape the cycle of rebirth and dissolution, ultimately returning to the immortal Dao, where form and spirit unite, never parting, both entering the true reality of the Way. Without this scripture, however, the womb’s obstructions congeal, the *qi* of death solidifies the root of life, the true radiance cannot be preserved, the *qi* of generation lacks sustenance, the nine orifices remain blocked, the body fails to engender spirit, and one merely receives a single form, as if borrowing *qi* to animate it. Those who master this method may sit and attain spontaneity.\n\nThe Way of the Supreme Perfected comprises seven paths; the Way of the Most High, three; the Way of the Middle Perfected, six; and the Way of the Lesser Perfected, eight. This chapter shares its meaning with the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*. Those who study transcendence, their strength shallow and their steps halting, have yet to escape the Three Realms and can only achieve *corpse liberation*. Though they have not yet escaped the cycle of rebirth and dissolution, they ultimately return to the immortal Dao. For those who cherish their form and preserve their spirit, they draw near to the Way.\n\nThe *True Records* state that when one dies as if still living—feet uncyanosed, skin unwrinkled, eyes as bright as in life—this is *corpse liberation*. Without this scripture, one cannot obtain the essential method of the Jade Chapter and the Great Cavern, nor sever the obstructions of the womb. Thus, they fear the *qi* of death will solidify their life’s root, and the true radiance cannot be long preserved. The *true radiance* is the light of spirit. Though they attain *corpse liberation*, they merely receive a single form, as if borrowing *qi* to animate the body—a withered tree briefly revived in spring, its fluids unsustained, unable to endure.\n\nThose who obtain this method master the secret of harmonizing the hundred spirits. Generally, the human body is born of the Three *Qi*. Having received this illumination, one becomes one with the Primordial Beginning, able to blend with the *qi* of the mundane, the spirit following wherever it resides. Initially, the Three *Qi* generate the Three Spirits, which divide into the Three Sections, Eight Radiant Ones, and Twenty-Four Spirits. If one can harmonize and transform them, the Three and Five Perfected Ones coalesce into the Orthodox Unity, enabling one to summon yang and invoke yin, moving without constraint. Yang *qi* transforms into dragons and simurghs; yin *qi* into jade maidens. Riding the whirlwind chariot beyond the Eight Extremities, one sits and attains spontaneity—how could this be deceit?\n\nThe Three Treasures are revered; the Perfected Ones of the Nine Heavens are most sacred. Their secrets are vast, sealed within the Ninefold Golden Racks of the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth are newly opened, this scripture will not emerge. It is the *Forbidden Book of the Primordial Beginning*, beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits. Whoever steals it will be severed by the wind-blade for ten thousand kalpas, their soul perishing without rebirth. Those who follow the precepts and revere it will unite form and spirit in transcendence.\n\nAccording to the *Seven Transformations That Harm Heaven Scripture*, the Three Hundred Scrolls of the Supreme Clarity’s sacred scriptures, the Seven Thousand Jade Instructions, the Seven Thousand Talismans, and the Spontaneous Chapters are all concealed in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens—this is one such text. The Ninefold Golden Racks and Purple Yang Jade Terrace are where the scriptures are stored. *Ninefold* signifies layer upon layer, like treasures wrapped in tenfold silk. *Racks* refer to shelves for books. The *Scripture of the Dao-Treasure* speaks of jade and golden racks, so strictly guarded that even spirits dare not steal a glance. Only when heaven and earth are illuminated and the mystic wind flows freely do the true scriptures and sacred talismans descend in due time. Those who revere them long enough will surely attain enlightenment, rightfully uniting form and spirit in transcendence.\n\nThe Three Primordial Palaces hold golden names inscribed in purple characters, marking those destined to become Perfected Ones of the Three Clarities in their next lives. They are fit to receive this scripture. When the karmic conditions align, they should offer gold and treasures, serve their masters with devotion, and receive the precepts through ritual covenant. They must guard their hearts and practice diligently, never lightly disclosing it, lest the wind-blade examine their bodies.\n\nThe Three Primordials’ judgment extends not only to the dead but to all—whether they have attained the Way or not. Only those with golden names and purple characters are distinguished as students of transcendence. The scriptures speak of the Three Primordials’ judgment halls in the underworld, called the *Ink Registers*—the black ledgers. The difference between those with golden names and purple characters and others is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\nIn former times, Li Jue, a commoner of Jiangyang, had long accumulated merit in the immortal registers. Though he had not yet ascended, his name was already inscribed in gold by the immortal officials in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven. This distinction is not exclusive to immortals. When Emperor Yuan of Liang was Prince of Xiangdong, he recorded loyal ministers, righteous scholars, and those of literary excellence, using three kinds of brushes: gold-tipped for the loyal and filial, silver-tipped for those of virtuous conduct, and mottled bamboo for those of fine writing. Such distinctions exist even among mortals.\n\nThis refers to those with prior karmic ties to transcendence, whose names are recorded in the immortal registers. Only they may receive and uphold the Jade Chapter, offering gold and treasures to their masters with sincerity, never transmitting it lightly. *Guarding the heart and practicing diligently* means calming the mind, dispelling distractions, and steadfastly following the scriptural teachings. Those who leak or disdain it bring calamity upon themselves.\n\nThe method of cultivation requires a thousand-day retreat, disengaging from worldly affairs and exhausting all sensory leaks. One pacifies the mind, silently recites, burns pure incense, and observes the precepts. Entering the chamber facing east, one knocks the teeth nine times, regulates the voice and aligns the *qi*, then chants the sacred chapter. *Retreat* means single-minded emptiness. The method of cultivation aims for completion in three years.\n\nBefore the retreat, the heart contends with external things, racing like wind and blazing like fire, never resting. Once in retreat, one unifies thoughts, attaining profound stillness, becoming one with the Great Void. The scriptures speak of the *Eight Leaks*: tears from the eyes (liver leak), nasal mucus (lung leak), saliva (kidney leak), sweat (heart leak), night sweats (small intestine leak), drool during sleep (brain leak), dreams of intercourse with spirits (spirit leak), and lustful desires (body leak). When the heart, the sovereign, is settled, all these cease. *Pacifying* means leveling; *silent recitation* means contemplating the Supreme Perfected.",

When *dead remains return to life*, it is as when Xu Jia, reduced to dry bones, was revived by the Lord Lao with the *Great Mystery’s Life Talisman*—this is the same truth.\n\nThe Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of all myriad beings. Thus, they are beyond the ken of ghosts and spirits, beyond what ordinary mortals may hear.",

      "translated_text": "Once, Master Ge the Immortal observed a prolonged retreat on Mount Tiantai. Before even a year had passed, his devotion moved the Supreme Perfected, who deigned to glance into his secluded chamber—this was the response to his prolonged retreat. Entering the chamber facing east, he aligned with the qi of generation. He struck his teeth: the left as the *Celestial Bell*, to subdue demonic spirits; the right as the *Celestial Chime*, to gather the hundred spirits; and the center as the *Celestial Drum*, to summon the Perfected Sages. Striking the teeth, burning incense, modulating the voice, and rectifying the qi—all are essential methods for reciting scriptures.\n\nReciting once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens.\nReciting twice, Heaven and Earth display reverence.\nReciting thrice, the Three Realms bow to the chamber.\nReciting four times, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.\nReciting five times, the Five Emperors pay homage to the Perfected.\nReciting six times, demon kings bind themselves.\nReciting seven times, the stellar lodges halt their gates.\nReciting eight times, the darkest night becomes luminous.\nReciting nine times, all heavens descend in attendance, and every spirit and numinous being, without exception, guards the carriage.\n\nThis chapter unites the marvel of Heaven and humanity as one. There is no duality between Heaven and humanity. My heart is the heart of Heaven and Earth; my qi is the qi of Heaven and Earth. Having embraced singular sincerity, this resonance elicits that response. \"Once\" means reciting a chapter through once, its sound reaching the Nine Heavens. Formerly, Duke Jing of Song uttered a single word, and Mars retreated from its station. Tang, reproaching himself for six faults, brought rain across thousands of miles. If such is the resonance of their responses, how much more so the chanting of the ancestral qi’s tone?\n\nFor the transformation of ancestral qi is vast, encompassing Heaven and Earth, pervading the Three Realms, stellar lodges, and Five Phases. Externally, it extends to demon kings; below, to the shades of the dark. All spirits and numinous beings derive from this source, flowing and spreading in accordance with their stations, thus giving rise to distinctions of good and evil, high and low.\n\nTwice: the gods of Heaven and Earth hear it and display reverence.\nThrice: the deities of the Three Realms descend to bow before the chamber of scripture recitation.\nFour times: Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Among Daoist heavenly deities, there are titles such as *Dharma King* and *Heavenly King*. Through invocation, they descend—just as Master Ge’s refined devotion in retreat summoned the descent of Perfected Xu to transmit scriptures.\nFive times: the Five Emperors, lords of the Five Qi, behold the true scripture’s abode and pay homage.\nSix times: the Yin-numbered demon kings, the great demons of the Six Heavens, who share in the Primordial Beginning’s dissemination. In retreat and jiao rites, there is a method to command demons, driving them away so that upon hearing the scriptures, they bind themselves and dare not intrude.\nSeven times: the stellar lodges halt their gates, as in the *Scripture of Salvation*, where the *Celestial Pivot* ceases its turning, and divine radiance attains great stillness.\nEight times: the darkest night reveals light, as Yang breaks through Yin.\nNine times: all heavens descend in attendance, and spirits guard the carriage. As when Li Shun chanted the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years, one evening thousands of flying immortals suddenly gathered in the sky, their divine radiance illuminating his chamber, and he attained the Dao. The merit and virtue thus evoked are like a corpse dwelling yet a dragon appearing, like profound silence yet thunderous sound—unexpected yet inevitable.\n\nOnce through reaches Heaven, the *bao yuan* opens and flows.\nThe preceding speaks of external resonance; this speaks of internal achievement, elucidating the method of the Great Cavern and returning elixir. \"Once through opens the *bao yuan*\" refers to Heaven generating Water. Human life begins in the *bao yuan*, where the qi of coagulating embryo and yellow essence circulates, ascending and descending without losing its measure, thus gradually nurturing vitality. If the *bao yuan* remains obstructed, there will surely be the affliction of heavenly blockage. For those cultivating the true, when first applying effort to the inner elixir, thoughts, intentions, qi, and breath all settle, spirit and essence begin to gather, and the lower gate of the *Mingmen* opens from this point.\n\nTwice through resounds in Earth, the root of the fetal knot dissolves.\nEarth generates Fire, and in the second month, the fetus forms. Yet the dead qi’s old root may cause it to bind and solidify, so it must be steamed and dispersed by true qi to enable growth. The *Supreme Clarity Cavern Mystery Scripture* contains the talisman of the Great One Emperor Lord for dissolving the Three Passes and Twelve Knots, written in red on green bamboo membrane and recited to dissolve them.\n\nThrice through, spirits bow, the *hun* gate refines the immortal.\nHeaven generates Wood, which in humans becomes the *hun*. In the third month, Yin and Yang begin to separate, and the *hun* acquires form. The *hun* gate lies to the left, belonging to Yang. In the third revolution of elixir refinement, Yang qi becomes sufficient. The method involves concentrating spirit and entering breath to nurture it, whereby divine intelligence naturally arises, the Azure Emperor guards the *hun*, and the Lord of Wood records the tally.\n\nFour times through, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals, the *po* gate closes its barrier.\nEarth generates Metal, which in humans becomes the *po*. In the fourth month, the *po* is born. The *po* gate lies to the right, belonging to Yin. In the fourth revolution of elixir refinement, Yang nurtures Yin, causing the *po* to be carried by the *hun*. The method takes the nose as the heavenly aperture, connecting to the lungs. The lungs govern the *po*; when profoundly still, the breath of coming and going ceases—this is called closing the barrier. Naturally, the *Flowery Pond* fills with water, descending to irrigate the heart’s network. Heart Fire descends, Kidney Water ascends, *ding* and *ren* unite, and the inner elixir harmonizes. If the barrier is not closed, the *hun* scatters and wanders, following dreams in and out. Unable to restrain it, the *po* acts at will, and one ultimately joins the ranks of ghosts.\n\nFive times through, the Five Emperors pay homage to the Perfected, the viscera and bowels become clear and cool.\nHeaven generates Earth; in the fifth month of human life, the Five Phases’ qi is complete, generating the five viscera and six bowels. The five viscera are the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. The six bowels are the small intestine, gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, bladder, and Triple Burner. \"Clear and cool\" means tranquil and undisturbed. Those cultivating the true abstain from desire, so the kidneys do not leak essence; they practice stillness, so the heart does not lose spirit; they stabilize breath, so the lungs can pacify the *po*; they simplify vision, so the liver can nurture the *hun*; and they concentrate thought, so the spleen can settle intention. With the Yellow Center penetrating principle, preserving the Great Harmony, spirit, essence, *hun*, *po*, and intention gather into one—this is called assembling the Five Phases. Their qi ascends to pay homage to the *Mud Pill*, which is called paying homage to the Perfected. Then the Azure Emperor guards the *hun*, the White Emperor attends the *po*, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood, and the Yellow Emperor presides at the center—ten thousand spirits do not transgress.",

      "translated_text": "The Six Perils’ demon-kings submit in compliance, and the stomach’s tube generates fluid. The demon-kings refer to the inner promptings of the six desires. *Nuo* means submission. Restrained by the jade scripture, they submit and yield. The stomach and spleen form an outer-inner pair, storing water and grain to nourish the five viscera. The *Classic of Difficulties* states that the qi of the five viscera all converge in the stomach. Moreover, the moistening of fluids depends on thought. If one is enticed by the six desires, thought loses its correctness, and one sees food as drool, encounters sorrow as tears, shame as sweat, anger as surging blood—all flowing away without return. Internally deprived of nourishment, essence, qi, and spirit scatter and leak, leaving only a withered husk, which is the cohort of death. If the six demon-kings submit in compliance, thought regains its correctness, governed within, then fluid arises in the stomach’s cavity, irrigating the four limbs, flowing to moisten the elixir crucible. Essence, qi, and spirit thereby congeal and unite—this is the cohort of life.\n\nThe Seven Perils’ stellar lodges shine bright, and the orifices open with keen perception. Heaven has the seven luminaries; humans have the seven orifices. By the seventh month, all are open to govern seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, and intake and output. Some say that keen perception originally arises from the heart, corresponding to the number of fire. The supremely wise have seven apertures in the heart, hence their keen perception. The dull have few or none, hence their dullness and turbidity. With seven revolutions of the elixir practice, the heavy barriers dissolve, and clarity pervades above and below. The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: “The seven orifices interpenetrate, each orifice radiant with light. The sagely sun and sagely moon illuminate the golden court.”\n\nThe Eight Perils’ dark night reveals light, and the three divisions’ eight luminous spirits fully integrate form and spirit. Yanluozi said: “In the eighth month, the spirits are complete.” The three divisions are the upper, middle, and lower. The *Central Alliance Register* records: the upper division’s eight luminous spirits are the spirit of hair, brain, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, tongue, and teeth. The middle division’s eight luminous spirits are the spirits of the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, left kidney, right kidney, gallbladder, and throat. The lower division has eight luminous spirits: the spirits of the stomach, large intestine, small intestine, navel, chest diaphragm, two flanks, left yin and left yang, and right yin and right yang. Together they number twenty-four, corresponding to the twenty-four qi. The upper division’s spirits take the brain spirit as their origin, stored at dawn. The middle division’s spirits take the heart spirit as their master, stored at noon. The lower division’s spirits take the kidney spirit as their master, stored at midnight. When the work of the Eight Perils nears completion, the body naturally emits light, illuminating the hidden and manifest. The three divisions’ eight luminous spirits are all fully integrated without laziness. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “The eight luminous spirits darkly merge, and qi enters the profound mystery.”\n\nThe Nine Perils: all heavens descend in visitation. The three barriers, five viscera, six bowels, nine palaces, golden tower and jade chamber, twelve layered gates, purple portals and jade enclosures—thirty-six thousand joints, their roots and origins, all simultaneously generate spirit. The *Yellow Court* takes the mouth as the Heavenly Barrier, the hands as the Human Barrier, and the feet as the Earthly Barrier. Also, below the brain is the Upper Barrier, beside the spine is the Middle Barrier, and the kidneys facing each other form the Lower Barrier. The viscera and bowels were noted earlier. The *Nine Palaces Cavern-Truth Scripture* states: “Three *fen* within the space between the eyebrows is the Double Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three *cun* inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace, also called the Mud Pill Palace; four *cun* is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five *cun* is the Emperor’s Palace. One *cun* above the Hall of Light is the Heavenly Court Palace; one *cun* above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate Truth Palace; one *cun* above the Cinnabar Field is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace; one *cun* above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Sovereign Palace.” The golden tower is the throat, also called the layered tower, within which twelve wardens hold jade halberds to guard it, governing the circulation of qi above and below. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: “Within the layered tower are twelve rings; from high to low, all are perfected beings.” The jade chamber is another name for the brain palace. The *Yellow Court* calls it the jasper chamber. The purple portals, according to the *Plain Questions and Spiritual Pivot Middle Section*, lie within the space above the eyebrows, where the Purple Chamber Cavern resides, guarded externally by the myriad spirits’ sovereign, named Feng Lingfan. The jade enclosure is the Jade Hall, namely the lower cinnabar field. There are eighteen thousand yang spirits and eighteen thousand yin spirits, totaling thirty-six thousand. This describes how, in the womb, the embryo’s form and qi transform, and by the ninth month, all spirits within the body simultaneously arise. With nine revolutions of the elixir practice, the sagely embryo is complete, and the myriad qi ascend as immortals—it is likewise so. The Nine Perils complete one cycle. When one cycle concludes, the Three Realms record one’s name, the Five Emperors befriend and distinguish one, and one is called a Perfected. Ten cycles unify qi, controlling and commanding the myriad spirits. Demon-kings protect and recommend one, and one is listed among the heavens. A hundred cycles unify spirit, attaining spontaneity. The Great One’s tally is received, and the Primordial Lord grants life. A thousand cycles unify numen, enabling one to sit or stand at will, vanish or appear. Immortal youths and jade maidens serve at one’s command. Ten thousand cycles complete the Dao, enabling one to ride a dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight. The Three Realms record one’s name, and heaven and humanity praise one’s virtue. The Five Emperors are the lords of the five directions and five qi. *You bie* means recording one’s meritorious deeds, regarding one as a friend, and distinguishing one from ordinary people. Refining the body into qi is called a Perfected. “Ten cycles unify qi” means the Dao’s qi circulates, and ghosts and spirits submit. Demon-kings protect and recommend one: when one first cultivates the Dao, demon-kings test one; if one does not retreat, they protect and recommend one, inscribing one’s name in the heavenly register, and only then does one attain the Dao. “Unifying spirit” means transformation without limit, attaining spontaneity without relying on thought or action—such as summoning the Six Jias’ traveling kitchen. The Great One’s tally: the Great One is the lord of a hundred spirits; the tally symbolizes the numinous qi within the body. The *Scripture of Salvation* states: “Holding the register and grasping the tally, preserving life and planting the root.”",

The Cloud Palace’s Yellow Chamber and seven-jeweled curtains adorn the celestial palace. \"Savoring and delving\" mean to ponder deeply. \"Penetrating wisdom generating spirit\" encapsulates the essential purport of Daoist scriptures. \"Subtle principles of the Great Primordial\" signify the profoundest truths, their traces concealed. \"Resonant whistling\" describes the unfurling of his spirit and the expansiveness of his numinous heart.\n\nAt that moment, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, the Jade Assistant and Supreme Steward, and the Four Harmonious Attendants of the Dawn, having purified themselves in fasting and raised their ritual tablets, stood in attendance at his side. Leaning upon his jade countenance, they were moved to wondrous perception; gazing upon his numinous eyes, they opened their hearts. Secretly inspired by the divine chapters, they leapt with joy; feasting upon the celestial sounds, they were reborn. Seizing the moment to awaken to communion, they dared to expose their hearts beneath his numinous gaze.\n\nThe Spirit-King, Supreme Steward, and Attendants of the Dawn were all close ministers. The Four Harmonious correspond to the Four Assistants—front and rear, left and right. \"Purifying in fasting\" means emptying the heart to await inquiry. \"Raising ritual tablets\" refers to the Spirit-King’s holding of the staff of office, used by decree to summon the myriad spirits. \"Jade countenance\" signifies flawless purity. \"Numinous eyes\" and \"numinous gaze\" denote all-pervading illumination. At this moment, the Spirit-King, gazing upon the Celestial Worthy’s visage and hearing his celestial voice, yearned for the divine chapters. Suddenly enlightened, he seized the opportunity to venture beneath the numinous gaze, laying bare his long-held heart to make his request.\n\nThereupon, the Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Boundless Spirit-King, stepped forward, bowed deeply, and addressed the Celestial Worthy, saying: \"This humble servant, fortunate to attend in your numinous presence, unworthy though I am, has been cleansed in the dark ford, twice awakened to the congealed mystery, and elevated to the rank of Spirit-King. I govern life and death, oversee all celestial immortals, bestow rewards and monitor the Seven Awakenings, gaze afar into distant realms, and in harmonious observation, face the Supreme Steward, answering as Attendant of the Dawn.\"\n\nThe Spirit-King, desiring to request the jade chapters, first offered words to the Celestial Worthy, humbly acknowledging his own limited talents, cleansed of the stains of his heart in the ford of the dark sea. \"Twice awakened to the congealed mystery\" signifies profound attainment of the most profound profundities. All that follows—\"governing life and death\" and so on—pertains to the duties of the Spirit-King. \"Bestowing rewards and monitoring the Seven Awakenings\" refers to carrying out the Celestial Worthy’s mandate to confer favor upon those who cultivate the Way.

Sixth, refining qi into spirit, one is called a Spirit-Person. Seventh, refining spirit to merge with the Dao, one is called a Supreme Person.\n\nHarmonious and concordant—this speaks of one’s duty to maintain harmony, gazing upward to serve the Supreme Steward, as if attending the dawn and responding to its governance.\n\nAt the proper moment, one must seize the opportunity and align with the convergence, treading the Nine Great Suns, penetrating the Yin Talisman, and extending a guiding hand to the myriad people. When the great cycle nears its end and the reckoning of *jiashen* arrives, the deluge will scour away filth, and calamities will blanket the heavens. The Three Officials will wield their brushes, assessing and distinguishing the seed-people, examining merits and transgressions, and separating the good from the wicked.\n\n*Opportunity* refers to what precedes an event; *convergence*, to encounter. *Treading* means to act. *Nine* signifies the thorough penetration of yang. *Talisman* means register—here, the extreme of yang gives rise to yin, and one traverses the yin register. The *Three Officials* are those of Heaven, Earth, and Water. Stirring their brush-tips, they distinguish the good and evil of a person’s lifetime to determine blessings or misfortunes.\n\n*Seed-people*—Master Xiao Zhenyou explains: the Four Brahmā Heavens are called the Four Seed-Civilian Heavens, located above the Twenty-Eight Heavens and beyond the reach of the Three Calamities. The Spirit-King, moved by the impending flood disaster of the time, seized the moment to request scriptures, proclaiming the power of the Dao to deliver salvation.\n\nFrom the era of *Chiming* to the first year of *Shanghuang*, according to the *Primordial Yang Jade Archives*, those who received deliverance numbered 240,000. *Chiming* refers to the time of the *Numinous Treasure’s* deliverance of humanity; *Shanghuang*, to the emergence of the *Divine Treasure* scriptures. *Primordial Yang* is the palace of the Purple Tenuity. The *Nine Dark Jade Archives* contain the statutes of the Perfected, recording the merits and transgressions of people. Those who *received deliverance* were all virtuous.\n\nAfter *Kaihuang*, when the reckoning reaches *jiashen*, the heavens will select officials in sequence, the offices of the immortals will lie vacant, the ranks of the bureaucracy will be unfilled, and the scattered administrative posts will all await appointed personnel. *Kaihuang* is the name of a celestial kalpa, following *Shanghuang*.\n\nThe *Recorder of Destinies* said: \"Yesterday, the Eastern Flower gathered all the officials of destiny, the spirits of the land, and the functionaries of the registers to review and assess the records. They found that among the people of the world, those who do good are few—less than one in fifty—let alone those who attain immortality. The offices of the immortals lie vacant, with none worthy of their posts, and even the scattered administrative positions are filled with the indolent. Those found to have transgressions upon examination will have the higher immortals demoted to lower immortals, and the lower immortals stripped of their ranks to become overseers of the underworld, so that they may repent, cultivate diligently, and eventually regain their former positions.\"\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Primordial Lady, having attained the rank of Primordial Lord, neglected her imperial duties, fell short in her proper affairs, transgressed the bounds of propriety, and lost decorum in courtly feasts. For carelessly revealing celestial treasures, she was demoted to a lesser Perfected, her register as a Perfected Sovereign was revoked, and her position in the Purple Void was withdrawn. From this, it is clear that the promotions and demotions of immortal offices are precise to the finest detail.\n\nAccording to the *Primordial Yang Jade Calendar*, during the Three Generations, those who have accumulated goodness and established merit, who are commended by the Three Realms and vouched for by the Five Emperors, and whose names are recorded in the heavens, shall be selected—100,000 to fill the offices, and an additional 120,000 to serve as reserve officials.\n\nThe *Jade Archives* mentioned earlier assess the souls of the deceased, while this *Jade Calendar* records the duties of the immortal offices. The *Three Generations* refer to ancestors who accumulated goodness, selecting those whose merit spans generations to fill the offices of the immortals, with the reserves serving as deputies.\n\nSuch examples include those whose names are preordained in the *Mystic Registers*—this is one criterion for selecting immortal officials, taking those whose names are recorded in the heavens, such as Sima Ziwei, whose name appears in the Cinnabar Terrace and Crimson Gates. Others possess bone structures aligned with immortality—those endowed with the pure qi of heaven and earth, born untainted by the mundane, with crane-like necks, tortoise-like jaws, emerald pupils, and double ankles, their bearing ethereal and embracing the mien of soaring clouds. These are the vessels of the Dao’s grove, fully worthy of such selection.\n\nOthers attain it through *extinction and rebirth*, their karmic cycles turning—those who cultivated the Dao but had not yet achieved completion before passing are called *extinguished*, yet they may still be promoted to immortal offices. In the past, Zheng Ren’an was born in Chanli and could speak within three days, already knowing his past lives. At twelve, his face radiated jade-like light, and he left home to wander the mountains and forests. Later, he attained extinction in the northern deserts of Rong, achieving fruition and becoming known as the Venerable Lord of Cinnabar Spirit.\n\nOthers are deeply devoted to the Three Treasures, their virtuous deeds piercing the heavens. The *Three Treasures* are the Dao, the scriptures, and the masters. The teachings reside within them. Disciples recite their words to illuminate the Dao and transform those who have not yet awakened—this is profound devotion. The *Scripture of the Hidden Perfected* states: \"When the nature of greed is stilled and extinguished, and the dusty burdens are untainted, with precepts unbroken, this is called the Treasure of Dharma. When the nature of anger does not arise and one is not enraged by external dust, with concentration unshaken by birth and death, this is called the Treasure of the Master. When the nature of delusion takes nothing, free from vexation and affliction, with wisdom flowing unimpeded, this is called the Treasure of the Dao. When the Three Poisons of greed, anger, and delusion are extinguished, the Three Treasures naturally manifest, and virtuous deeds pierce the heavens.\"\n\nOthers are commended by the Three Officials for their offerings to the Treasure of the Master. The *Master* is one who transmits the Dao, establishes teachings, and expounds scriptures. Since ancient times, immortals and sages have not attained deliverance without a master. Even ordinary people rely on masters to transmit their learning—how could one not revere, trust, and make offerings to them? Serving with diligence and utmost sincerity, earnestly guiding and instructing, one is rightfully commended by the Three Officials.\n\nOthers accumulate merit through fasting and upholding precepts. *Fasting* means aligning one’s thoughts, moderating flavors, and preserving wholeness of truth. *Precepts* include the Nine Precepts of the Numinous Treasure and the Ten Precepts of the Orthodox Unity. Upholding them unwaveringly over time accumulates merit and virtue.\n\nLi Changling said: \"Daily practice is called *merit*; daily renewal is called *virtue*. The heavenly immortals require 1,300 good deeds—one good deed a day would take only four years. The earthly immortals require 300 good deeds—practicing them would take only a year. Yet most people abandon their efforts midway. Have they not heard of the saying about water wearing through stone or bowing to a tree?\"\n\nThe Primordial Lady of the Purple Void said: \"In the past, Master Fu loved the Dao from his youth and entered a stone chamber on Mount Jiao, where he cultivated for seven years.\"",

In ancient times, Zhou Xihua was devoted to almsgiving, never wearying despite hardship and poverty. The Perfected One Zhi Guan transformed into a beggar to test his resolve, and Zhou indeed rejoiced in giving. That very day, he was ferried across to become the Perfected One of Western Florescence. During the sacred reign of the Song, when a great famine struck Zizhou, the Perfected Lord of Protective Sageliness appeared as an old man selling steamed waterfowl and millet, saving countless lives. At the end of the Jianlong era, when famine struck the Hebei Circuit, the Perfected Lord again took the form of a merchant, transporting one hundred fifty thousand *hu* of grain and wheat into the city. Suddenly, the merchant vanished, and the officials used the grain for relief, extending aid to neighboring commanderies. Though the Perfected Lord had ascended to the rank of High Perfected, he acted thus—his single thought of benevolence toward life was as ceaseless as heaven itself.\n\nAnother example: Huang Jianji sold mixed grain without raising the original price, and the Perfected Lord of Purple Submission paid him reverence, seating him above Prefect Zhang Guaiya. Wang Shiliang measured out rice, allowing buyers to take their own measure, and with a single word, summoned sweet rain—his merit and conduct shone brightly.

When accumulation reaches fullness, their names are inscribed in the celestial registers. The ledgers of merit and demerit, examined by the Three Officials, are all inscribed in reverse order, with distinctions between high and low, leaving no detail unrecorded.\n\nThe Three Officials oversee the Nine Palaces, which together govern seventeen bureaus and one hundred twenty offices.

      "translated_text": "The sacred statutes contain prohibitions beyond the purview of a humble servant such as myself. Yet the great reckoning draws near—with the approach of the jiashen year’s end, the cosmic cycles hasten, and the grand Dharma must be enacted. Among the Four Practices of Jade Purity, compassion stands foremost; among the Three Treasures of the Old Master, compassion leads. The sages expand and fulfill it, extending its blessings to all things without exception.\n\nThe transmission of the *Mingzhen* precepts and scriptures is bound by fixed time limits, and when the divine kings petition beyond the appointed hour, it is to urgently deliver humankind. Thus, those of sincere intent may, even amid the calculations of fate, hear the Dharma’s resonance, receive its revelation through sight and sound, and be exhorted toward enlightenment. In presenting this entreaty, I fear offending the celestial countenance and humbly beseech your compassion, granting what has not yet been heard.\n\nI request the scriptures so that those who aspire to the Dao yet remain unenlightened may partake of its mysterious transformation, cultivate virtuous conduct, and escape the censure of the Three Bureaus.\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy leaned forward from his high seat, composed his spirit in profound contemplation, raised his voice to chant the cavernous verses, and intoned the jade-like liturgy. After a long while, he suddenly sighed and said: \"The supreme model abides in emptiness, its principles subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao penetrates the double mystery, its qi crowning the Divine Empyrean. Its ultimate truth is difficult to express, its wonders hard to surpass.\"\n\n*Leaning forward* suggests a gesture of engagement; *high seat* signifies loftiness beyond reach. *Composing the spirit in profound contemplation* indicates deep reflection; *raising the voice to chant the cavernous verses and intoning the jade-like liturgy* describes a resonant and stirring recitation. *The supreme model abides in emptiness, its principles subtle and profoundly obscure; the Dao penetrates the double mystery, its qi crowning the Divine Empyrean*—these lines describe the scripture’s wondrous model and profound principles, vast and profoundly remote. Its Dao pervades all mysteries, its qi originating in the Divine Empyrean. The *Divine Empyrean* is one of the Nine Empyreans, governing the myriad heavens. This passage declares the jade scripture’s ineffable wonders, unmatched by any other text.\n\nSince you hold the imperial office and bear the charge of divine king, your celestial wings soar above the jasper towers, and the Four Ministers assist the luminous wheel. Your gaze surveys all, your oversight boundless; you harmonize the myriad transformations and govern the black-haired people. As divine king, your station is imperial; your charge, regal. The *Thirty-Nine-Chapter Commentary* states: \"The Jasper Towers are the halls of the Grand Tenuity, the true celestial palace of the Heavenly Emperor.\" It further notes: \"The sun and moon of the human realm are the luminous wheel, requiring the divine king’s winged assistance and ministerial aid.\" Beyond this, you harmonize the myriad transformations, survey the four directions, and oversee countless affairs—your duties are not confined to one domain.\n\nNow, as the great cycle unfolds its appointed time, the Three and Five announce the hour; the Hundred and Six respond to the mechanism, the Yang Nine surges, the vast springs churn their waves, ten thousand calamities assail the heavens, and the Four Bureaus select candidates to replenish the seed people. Three generations of chaos and disorder demand the separation of good and evil. You must labor for the multitudes, exhausting yourself for the Three Bureaus. At this juncture of rise and decline, matters require your utmost ability. I now entrust this to you—strive diligently.\n\nThis recalls the Heavenly Worthy’s past exhortation to the divine king, urging him to save the people amid the great flood. The precious scriptures, wondrous and weighty, and the numinous sounds of the Nine Heavens are bestowed upon the exalted sages—not for the ears of ghosts and spirits. The *Mingzhen* statutes decree that they be transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, in defiance of the prohibitions, I entrust them to you—guard them well and transmit them with utmost care.\n\nThe transmission of these sacred texts is accompanied by solemn admonitions—how could one not be vigilant?\n\nThen, summoning the Marshal of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Gentlemen Attending the Immortals, he commanded them to open the Purple Yang Jade Case and the cloud-brocade satchel, revealing the *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Giving Qi*. The Four Assistants took their positions, the Five Elders oversaw the transmission, the Great One selected the auspicious hour, and the Jade Emperor intoned the oath. Following the protocols of the *Mingzhen* rites, they faced south in prostration as the scriptures were conferred upon the Boundless Flying Celestial Divine King.\n\nOnce the ritual was complete, the hosts of heaven returned to their stations.\n\n*Summoning* occurred without delay. The *Jade Gentlemen Attending the Immortals* are the officials in charge of the scriptures. *Purple Yang* is the repository of the scriptures; the *jade case and cloud-brocade satchel* are the containers for the texts. The *Four Assistants* correspond to the Four Harmonizers. The *Five Elders* are the Primordial Elder of the Jade Purity’s Vast Ultimate, the Radiant Elder of the Void Sovereign, the True Elder of the Mystic Flower’s Treasure Heaven, the Ancestral Elder of the Subtle Grand Ultimate, and the Immortal Elder of the Vast Capital. The *Great One* is the Central Yellow Great One. *Selecting the auspicious hour* refers to choosing a propitious time. The *Jade Emperor* is the Highest Jade Emperor. *Oversight of the transmission, intonation of the oath, prostration, and facing south* all follow the *Mingzhen* protocols for scripture transmission.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy solemnly addressed the Flying Celestial Divine King: \"These *Jade Chapters of the Nine Heavens* are the qi of the Three Caverns’ Flying Mystery, the sound formed through three assemblies, the true scripture coalescing the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names in hidden rhymes. Thus, the Great One’s precept-observation encompasses the ten directions, gathering and uniting the Cavernous Void to initiate the cinnabar and azure oaths.\"\n\n*The coalescence of hidden rhymes* was explained previously. Wang Yinxian suggests that *precept* should read *trial*. This means the Great One’s spirits were once commanded to test those studying the Dao; only if their resolve remained unshaken were they permitted to take the cinnabar and azure oaths. The *Transmission and Establishment Manual* records: \"In the past, when I received the divine scriptures, someone tested me by suddenly striking my hand with a staff until it bled, yet I remained steadfast in my devotion.\" The scriptural precepts include a trial covenant: before transmission, one’s robes might be set ablaze without cause, and only if the aspirant remained silent as the flames consumed them would they be deemed unwavering. The *Golden Mystery Feather Scriptures* state: \"All transmissions are initiated by the Five Elders, with the Great One testing the ten directions.\" Thus, the character *trial* was mistakenly written as *precept*—this is certain.\n\nAmong the Six Caverns, the Cavernous Void belongs to the west. Yet the Primordial Heavenly Worthy commanded the Great One to encompass the ten directions, presiding over the qi of life and also overseeing the registers of death—hence the phrase *gathering and uniting the Cavernous Void*. *Cinnabar and azure* refer to the blood oath (cinnabar) and the silk pledge (azure), used to affirm trust and establish covenants.\n\nOnly those with karmic affinities spanning countless kalpas, whose names are inscribed in the imperial registers, may behold these texts. Even a glimpse of their titles ensures that nine generations of ancestors ascend together. You must select those destined for immortality: for seven hundred years, they must maintain a thousand days of pure fasting, present gold and silk as pledges, and transmit the scriptures in accordance with the oath.",

When Master Xu the Perfected ascended, the Celestial Emperor proclaimed: *\"Since kalpas past, you have diligently cultivated the Dao, enduring hardships without respite. Your mastery of scriptures and precepts runs deep, traversing ten thousand methods and a thousand gates without omission. Today, you shall ascend.\"* Then the Heavenly Marshal of Great Strength on the Left was commanded to escort him with the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, illuminating the Central Yellow, lest any negligence arise.

Yet when lesser scholars hear the Dao, they laugh at it. It is not that the Dao rejects them, but that they cut themselves off from the Dao, for no other reason than this: their deep-rooted transgressions obstruct their virtuous aspirations.\n\nThe *Inner Scripture of the Five Emperors* states: *\"Those who attain the Dao yet lack immortal bones will have their names carved in jade records, but in future lives, they shall not even glimpse these texts. If they encounter the scriptures, they may become patriarchs of the Five Peaks.\"* The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao must first untie the knots of darkness—hence the phrase *nine generations ascend together*.\"*\n\nSeven hundred years marks the time of the scriptures’ revelation.

The jade chapters are hidden in the heavens above, and their transmission is no easy matter. Those who receive and uphold them must revere and honor them with utmost gravity, thereby illuminating their profound mysteries—so as not to betray the original intent of the divine kings who entreated these scriptures.\n\n*The Central Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: Annotated Scroll of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Scripture of the Generation of the Gods* concludes here.\n\n*The Central Scripture of the Numinous Treasure: Annotated Scroll of the Nine Heavens’ Spontaneous Scripture of the Generation of the Gods*, Lower Scroll\nFurther annotations by Huayang\n\n**First Chapter: The Generation of the Gods in the Immeasurable Heaven of Yudu**\n\nThe *qi* of Heaven is of a verdant hue.\n\nThe *Three Primordial Scripture* states: A person’s *qi*-soul is received from Heaven, while their bodily form and *po*-soul are received from Earth. Without shape or image, they come from the void, passing from non-being into being. They dwell in the womb for ten months—though in truth, nine months. Each month, they receive the *qi* of one heaven to generate the gods. After nine months, the *qi* is full, the gods complete, and they emerge from the womb as a human being.\n\nThe *Records of the Western Mountains* says: Those who nurture life well proceed from non-being to being; those who nurture it poorly return from being to non-being. When a person’s *qi* and blood are at their peak, they squander the gods and *qi* they have received on passions and desires. Once blood and *qi* decline, the *hun* and *po* they possessed return to Heaven and Earth, and the body becomes withered wood. Only those who cultivate the truth know that spirit, *hun*, and *po* are but temporary loans from Heaven. Thus, they treasure, cherish, and refine them, prolonging the loan indefinitely until all becomes their own.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This heaven is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, the *kaiyang* of the Northern Dipper. The primordial *qi* of the imperial true embryo-life is the *yuan-yi huangyan*.\n\nThe imperial name is *Ning Shou Can*.\n\nThe *Seven Lots from the Cloudy Satchel* says: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Purple Empyrean Yellow-Yan Lord was transformed and took his place in the Palace of the Great Brahma of the Purple Empyrean. The Emperor of the Center of Heaven uses true *qi* as the origin of the embryo-life.\n\nWang Yin Xian says: Each of the nine chapters contains four characters of the imperial true life-origin. This is the Yellow Court’s primordial king, located below the Gate of Life, governing the *qi* of generation and transformation. As it presides over all, it is called \"Emperor\"; as the Great One is without peer, it is called \"True.\" The nine heavens array their rectitude, all following the command of the imperial true. Once the mandate is fixed, it does not change.\n\n*Yuan* is the name for the *qi* at the beginning of its generation. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Great indeed is the primal *qi* of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it.\" \"Profound indeed is the primal *qi* of Kun! All things owe their birth to it.\" When this primal *qi* first sprouts from below, the initial embryo resembles a hanging sac attached to the spleen. The spleen belongs to Earth, from which all things arise. The Central Yellow Great One is the life of the self; its *qi* flows and extends without end—hence the name *yuan-yi huangyan*.\n\nIntermingling with the *qi* of the empty cavern,\nThe flying *shuang* drifts in the distant void.\nExtending through kalpas without end,\nVast and remote, they part from their root.\nSuffering souls sink into the nine nights,\nRiding the dawn, they long for the sun’s rays.\n\nThe Dao Lord says: The primal *qi* originates beyond the distant and obscure, born within the space of the empty cavern. It gathers and scatters, scatters and gathers. Before a person receives life, their *hun-shuang* drifts in the distant void, faint and without support. From the ancient kalpa of Yan Kang to the present, they have undergone countless cycles of life and death, emerging and vanishing like flowers and fruits severed from their branches, scattered and adrift, never returning to the soil. The \"nine nights\" refer to the nine earths. Ghosts belong to yin and dwell in darkness, following their kind. After long immersion, all yearn to lift their heads and gaze upon the dawn’s sunlight, hoping for deliverance.\n\nThe Great Possession opens the gate of mysterious profundity,\nThe Immeasurable Heaven descends the divine aurora.\nYellow clouds congeal in the numinous palace,\nYin and yang *qi*-images intertwine.\nThe embryo-origin binds long life,\nEvil roots dissolve in response to transformation.\n\nThis is the initial work of cultivating the truth. The Palace of Great Possession is the Mud Pill Palace within the human body. At the first stirring of yang, one draws the *qi* of the Great Possession Palace downward to subdue and restrain the yang essence, thereby opening the gate of mysterious profundity—the secret gate behind the navel. One then receives the gods of the Immeasurable Heaven of Yudu, the Morning Metal Aurora Emperor One, both female and male, within the body. The Morning Heaven is female, the Metal Aurora is male.\n\nThe *Scripture of Yang Essence* says: \"Return the yang essence to the Floating Black; gather the yellow *qi* from the Immeasurable.\" The female one and male one are the heart’s fluids and the kidneys’ *qi*, becoming the infant boy and jade maiden. Fire above and water below—how can they unite? If one can abide in the Central Yellow, steadfastly concentrating the numinous palace (the heart), with inner thoughts not straying outward and outer thoughts not entering in, then water and fire, yin and yang, will naturally merge. Once yin and yang unite, the Five Phases invert, and the numinous sprout arises of itself. The embryo-origin is formed, becoming the foundation of the primordial supreme essence’s ceaseless generation and transformation. Life is renewed, and all past evil roots and transgressions are washed away, no longer a burden.\n\nMaster Lü of Floating Mountain, teacher of Min Zhong, said: \"Stillness without movement is the nature of Earth. This is true Earth. When the roots of the senses are severed and all thoughts extinguished, a single purity remains whole. Profoundly still, this is the state of primordial chaos.\" The cloud palace is the Yellow Chamber. The pure harmony of *qi* becomes visible, hence the \"yellow clouds.\" At this stage, sun and moon unite, spirit and *qi* merge, the mysterious pearl nears formation, and the Great One gradually returns to the true.\n\nPeach-Kang unites essence and extends,\nThe two emperors flourish like jade petals.\nThey irrigate the Gate of Embryo-Life,\nRefining essence, the spirit does not wither.\n\nPeach-Kang is the god of the Gate of Life, named \"Uniting Essence and Extending.\" He is the revered god of the Great Cavern, guarding the human navel. The two emperors are the Numinous Emperor and the Revered Emperor.\n\nThe *Hidden Book* says: Without the Great One, the Numinous Emperor cannot return the *qi* of the mysterious void; without the Great One, the Revered Emperor cannot house the Three Ones. The powers of the two emperors operate in harmony without conflict. The flourishing of jade petals describes their purity. The principle of life’s generation in the body originates here. Throughout the twelve hours, the god of the Great One circulates numinous fluids to irrigate the Gate of Life, thereby securing the embryo-origin—this is what is meant by \"refining essence, the spirit does not wither.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Yellow Court* says: \"Nourish the numinous root so it does not wither; seal the Gate of Life to protect the Jade Capital.\"\n\n---",
      "overlap_context": " bones will have their names carved in jade records, but in future lives, they shall not even glimpse these texts. If they encounter the scriptures, they may become patriarchs of the Five Peaks.\"* The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: *\"Those who cultivate the Dao must first untie the knots of darkness—hence the phrase *nine generations ascend together*.\"*\n\nSeven hundred years marks the time of the scriptures’ revelation. A thousand days of pure fasting is the appointed term for their transmission.",

      "translated_text": "The *Nine Heavens’ Mandate of Numinous Life* Chapter states: \"When the spirit is born, the spirit transcends of itself.\" The Primordial Lord seals the Gate of Death, while the Marshal recites the *Cavernous Chants*. One intonation harmonizes with the myriad perfected; nine recitations summon the homage of all heavens. Bowing in reverence through kalpas of time, we celebrate the flourishing of the ancient sprout.\n\nThe efficacy of the *Nine Heavens’ Emperor Lord’s Descent of the Numinous Chapter* gathers the perfected radiance to generate the spirit. Once the spirit is born, one may transcend the subtle and enter sageliness. The human body possesses thirty-nine Gates of Life and thirty-nine Gates of Death. Having attained life, one must fear the reopening of the Gates of Death; thus, the Primordial Lord’s *qi* must seal them, preventing the intrusion of stale *qi*. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: \"Only the utterly true may gaze upon it; most abhorrent are the dead *qi* and all defilements.\"\n\nThe Marshal of Longevity sings the *Cavernous Chapter* to praise the work of generation. When the Marshal intones once, the myriad perfected respond in harmony, their joy mutual. After nine recitations, the *qi* of all heavens arrives in homage, their union complete. Through kalpas to this day, encountering this opportunity, what was once severed from its root now sprouts anew—how could one not rejoice?\n\nMo Xi Zi said: \"To cultivate the Dao and perfect the true lies in this life; the deluded wait for death before seeking life. Where there is life, there must be the principle of life. Even if one attains life, where does one truly live?\" Pondering this verse may serve as a clarion for the birth of the spirit.\n\n**Second Chapter of the Uppermost Meditation on Goodness and the Immeasurable Longevity Heaven’s Birth of the Spirit**\n*The Heavenly Qi is Crimson*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: \"This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence and luminous yang.\" The *qi* of the Emperor’s True Embryonic Life originates in the Cavernous Obscurity of the Purple Chamber. The Emperor’s name is *Heng-Ni-Nan*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* records: \"In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of the Cavernous Obscurity of the Great Empyrean was transformed and born. This Heaven’s Emperor takes true *qi* as the origin of embryonic life.\" The Perfected of the Western Marchmount states: \"In humans, the second month forms the embryo—the root of the entire body, from which life first arises. Thus, it is called the *Embryonic Life Origin*.\"\n\nWhen the Perfected forms the embryo, the spirit dwells in the Purple Chamber, its root linked to the Gate of Life, continuous and unbroken—this is called *embryonic breathing*. The *Scripture of Southern Florescence* states: \"The true person breathes through the heels, still and *qi* profound. The multitude breathes through the throat, restless and *qi* shallow.\" Shallow *qi* scatters the embryonic origin and dissipates true *qi*. The Gate of Life lies in the north, termed *Cavernous Obscurity*. As its *qi* ascends to the Purple Chamber, it is called the *qi* of the Purple Chamber. The Purple Chamber is located one *cun* above the space between the brows, recessed three *fen* into the bone.\n\nThe Immeasurable One knits the Purple Chamber,\nIts *qi* revered as the King of Heaven’s Center.\nIt opens and conveys the soaring mysterious luminosity,\nCongealing and transforming the wheel of empty vastness.\nThus, sever the roots of past attachments,\nAnd trace the origin of former affinity.\nThrough dark nights sunk in distant kalpas,\nFace the exhaustion of the great cycle’s passage.\n\nThe Immeasurable Longevity Heaven bestows and infuses numinous *qi*, which coalesces in the Purple Chamber, where among the Nine Heavens it is revered as the *qi*-honored Emperor. The *soaring mysterious luminosity* refers to the dead soul, which at its inception as a person also receives the *qi* of the Three Caverns’ soaring mystery. The Heavenly Emperor, abiding in the azure vault, turns the wheel to transform its end in the empty vastness, opening and conveying it, instantly severing the bonds of past attachments. One regains the Great Dao as the root and awakens to the original nature of former days.\n\nYet in the past, through greed and attachment, one endured suffering, sinking into dark nights across distant kalpas. Now, the retribution is complete, and the great cycle’s turning brings renewal—one may be reborn.\n\nThe Emperor’s True Beginning Clarity is named *Primordial Yang*. The Infant Historian Bo Hua forms the embryo and guards the Yellow Chamber. Sever the roots and seal the Gates of Death; nurture the infant with radiant countenance.\n\nUpon receiving precelestial *qi*, one is born. After birth, a single spark of primordial numen returns to the space between the kidneys—this is the Emperor’s True. Initially called *Essence*, its name is *Primordial Yang*, the title of the Original King of the Yellow Court below the Gate of Life, who presides over this Emperor’s True. The Infant Historian Bo Hua is the Red Child of the Heavenly Emperor of the Muddy Pellet, named *Mysterious Congealing Heaven*, who together holds true *qi* and forms the embryo within the Yellow Chamber.

Having already formed the embryo, one must now nurture it. Beginning at the Purple Gate below the Three Passes, it descends from the Muddy Pellet to the Flowery Pond, where one rinses and swallows the fragrant essence—hence called *Mysterious Feeding*. As the irrigation circulates, the Infant’s true *qi* becomes abundant, and the body naturally assumes the purity of jade. With prolonged refinement, the countenance forms of itself. As the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* states: “The mouth is the Jade Pond, the Palace of Grand Harmony; rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid, calamities cannot approach. The body emits radiant light, the *qi* redolent as orchid; repelling the hundred evils, the face is refined as jade. Those who cultivate this diligently ascend to the Broad Cold.” Wang Yin Xian says: *Radiant Splendor* refers to absorbing the luminous essence of the sun and moon to nourish the embryo, dissolve obstructions, and naturally refine the jade-like complexion.\n\nWithin the embryo dwell two spirits:\nOne is the Lord of White *Qi*, named *Devoted to the Mysterious*, styled *Fostering Life’s Flourishing*.\nThe other is *Mysterious Return*, styled *Abundant Prosperity*.\nThese spirits are born with the embryo’s destiny, arraying themselves alongside all spirits within the Hall of Light. As Master Xiao states: The Three Fields of the human body each contain chambers of the Hall of Light and the Grotto Chamber.\n\nThe Great Void stirs the numinous convergence,\nCommanding me to sing the *Chapter on Generating Spirit*.\nAt the first chant, the Nine Mysteries stir;\nAt the second, Heaven and Earth commune.\nHarmonizing and blending of themselves,\nNine recitations complete the work of humanity.\nThe Great Sage celebrates the Primordial Auspiciousness—\nScattering flowers in homage to the Great Void.\nAll heavens rejoice in unison,\nEvery being bows in reverence.\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor commands the Jade Chapter to generate spirit within the Great Void, evoking the assembly of the hundred numina—precisely what the *Book of Changes* calls “the Dao of Qian transforming and transmuting, each rectifying its nature and destiny.” *Stirring the Nine Mysteries* means that one recitation resonates through the Nine Heavens. *Heaven and Earth commune* means that two recitations establish reverence between Heaven and Earth. With the harmony of yin and yang and the completion of nine recitations, all beings receive the work of generation and transformation. *Primordial* is the chief of virtues; *auspiciousness* ensures nothing is inauspicious. The rejoicing of all heavens reflects the Heavenly Dao’s reverence for life.\n\n**Third Chapter of the *Celestial Longevity Scripture*: The Heaven-Born Chapter on Generating Spirit**\n*The Azure Qi of Heaven*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the Heavenly Soul’s primordial yang, the *qi* of the Emperor’s True, the soul’s destiny, the origin of the numinous, the radiant immortal’s *qi*.\nThe Emperor’s name is *Yan Bing Ning*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Azure Radiance Bright Immortal Lord was transformed and born, taking true *qi* as his soul and the origin of his destiny. Master Dou of the Western Marchmount says: In the third month of gestation, the three *qi* circulate, the three souls descend, and the spirit’s numinosity lengthens. Zhao Yu Chan says: The soul is yang *qi*; yang *qi* is luminous, hence called the *Bright Immortal*. *Lengthening Numinosity* is what the *Scripture of the Yellow Court* calls “the yellow *qi* surges, clear and long.”\n\nThe Heavenly Emperor *Xu Yan* governs the three souls and the *qi* of the *Lengthening Numinous Bright Immortal*, which truly divides from the Primordial Origin. It manifests as the vast expanse of the Great Brahmā, the radiant splendor of the Jade Lord of Emerald. *Xu Yan* is the Heavenly Emperor who governs the three souls. The *qi* of the *Lengthening Numinous Bright Immortal* truly originates from the Primordial Origin, transforming into the boundless image of the Great Brahmā. *Great Brahmā* refers to the *qi* of all heavens filling the ten directions. The soul resides in the liver, corresponding to wood and spring; its color is azure, hence called the *Radiant Splendor of the Jade Lord of Emerald*.\n\nThe luminous Brahmā soars on the dark radiance,\nOpening the path to deliver the souls of the long night.\nThe wandering spirits hasten to their appointed return,\nThe *qi* in abundance returns to its original root.\n\nHuman life fundamentally arises from Brahmā *qi*, within which dwells the spirit of birth, named *Luminous Brahmā*. The *Universal Salvation Mantra* speaks of the six *qi* all obeying *Luminous Brahmā’s* summoning—this refers precisely to this. *Dark Radiance* is the name of a dragon. It means the spirit of *Luminous Brahmā* rides the dragon through the void, opening the path to deliver the dead souls from the long night’s yin realm. *Wandering spirits* refers to the ethereal soul’s roaming; now, having received life, it hastens to its appointed return. *The qi in abundance returns to its original root* means that the *qi* of the former body, once dispersed, all returns to the origin.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor is titled *Hall of Yang*,\nStyled *Lord of the Eight Numinous Ones*.\nThe Ninefold Opening reverses the register of the Dao,\nThe embryo’s *qi* generates the Upper Primordial.\nAscending the Brahmā to cross the ledger of destiny,\nThe Great One assists the extension of essence.\nThe Muddy Pellet spreads the Emperor’s seat,\nThe Three Fields and Eight Radiant Ones divide.\n\nThe Supreme Emperor’s essence-soul is named *Hall of Yang Jade*, styled *Eight Numinous Ones*. The Heavenly Emperor of the Nine Openings is named *Reversing the Register of the Dao*, styled *River of Utmost Darkness*. The *Jade Record of the Great Simplicity* states: In the third month, the soul forms, its *qi* originally generated from the embryo. Moreover, the Grand Harmony August Sage, the Old Master, governs the *qi* of the embryo’s origin, entering and exiting the Purple Tenuity—precisely the residence of the Great One on Kunlun, which is the Upper Palace of the Muddy Pellet, hence called *the embryo’s qi generates the Upper Primordial*. *Ascending the Brahmā* is the Lord of the Myriad Spirits, also named the *Divine Elder*, styled *Treading the Flourishing Numinous One*, who guards the Purple Gate within the space between the human brows, overseeing human lifespan and longevity. *Extending Essence* is the name of the Peach Vigor Lord of the Gate of Destiny, who guards the Central Gate of the navel, holding the single spark of primordial yang *qi*, also converging in the Upper Palace of the Muddy Pellet. The Venerable Great One, *Devoted to Gathering*, resides at the Jade Pillow below the Muddy Pellet’s rear gate, assisting and sheltering it, blending and harmonizing. Then the seat is properly spread, and the spirits of the Three Fields and Eight Radiant Ones each take their places.\n\nThe solemn cultivator of the true,\nNurturing yang and gathering the soul,\nCauses the Eight Radiant Ones to unite their light,\nIlluminating the Muddy Pellet.\nGathering the myriad numina,\nAt dawn ascending the chamber of the Heavenly Elder,\nConcentrating essence and converging spirit,\nStriking down the roots of the womb,\nAscending to the immortal capital.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Grotto* states:\n*The Supreme Emperor’s Upper Primordial Qi*,\n*The Child of the Controller of Destiny at midday*.\nResplendent, it forms radiant light,\nDonning auroras, riding the Emperor’s ramparts.\nArrayed in seats of the Thunderous Numinous,\nBlending with the five days as one.\nThe Eight Radiant Ones illuminate the Muddy Pellet,\nLuminous within the Grotto Chamber.",

Celestial Gates.\nThe Mysterious Pass bars the Gate of Death,\nThe numinous guards the source of fluids.\nResponding to the tally of spiritual convergence,\nThe Dao illumines, subtly revolving the wheel.\nJoyous is this Infant’s shedding,\nBowing in reverence to praise the *Grotto Scripture*.\n\nThe jade scriptures of the Nine Heavens,\nTheir sounds resonant and clear,\nDescend to generate the myriad spirits.\nThree revolutions compose one body,\nEach spirit and qi assumes its rightful place,\nTheir positions at the Eight Celestial Gates.\nThe *Commentary on the Scripture of Spirit Transference* states:\n*The human skull comprises eight plates, corresponding to the Eight Gates of Heaven.*\nThe *Upper Scripture of the Grotto Chamber of the Purple Void Lord* says:\n*Above the Purple Gate, gazing toward the Eight Celestial [Gates],\nDrawing forth the Cinnabar Palace, assembling the luminous spirits.*\n\nThe Eight Gates of Heaven are:\nIn the East, the Azure Florescence Primordial Yang Gate;\nIn the South, the Cavern Yang Supreme Radiance;\nIn the West, the Interconnected Yin Metal Portal;\nIn the North, the Yin Birth Vast Spirit;\nIn the Northeast, the Spirit-Through Prohibited Heights;\nIn the Southeast, the Beginning Yang Birth Qi;\nIn the Southwest, the Mysterious Yellow Lofty Dawn;\nIn the Northwest, the Nine Transformations Brahma Conduct Gate.\nSome say the qi of the Eight Radiant Ones within the body\nAscends to align with these Eight Celestial Gates.\n\nThe Mysterious Pass refers to the Lower Cinnabar Field.\nThe *True Instructions* states:\n*Guard and seal the Mysterious Pass,\nInwardly draw the Nine Perfected,\nThe Three Qi circulate fluids,\nIrrigating the Cinnabar Field.*\nThree inches below the navel lies the Gate of Life.\nIf the Gate of Life is secured, the Gate of Death is barred;\nThus, the numinous qi settles and stills,\nThe source of fluids flows ceaselessly,\nNourishing the hundred bones.\nThose who study immortality, favored by karmic affinity,\nExternally can proclaim the transformations of the Dao,\nInternally can subtly revolve the mechanism of yin and yang within the body.\nConcentrating qi to achieve suppleness,\nTheir merit complete in nine revolutions,\nA body beyond the body—\nThe Infant sheds its form.\n\n**Silent and Formless: The Heaven-Born Spirit Chapter of the Doushu

Dark Evolution Lord was transformed into being.\nThus, the Emperor of this heaven employs true qi as po,\nThe inception of destiny’s origin.*\nPo pertains to substance, hun to spirit;\nHun qi governs ascent, po form governs descent.\nHun is light and pure, po heavy and turbid—\nHence, it is called the \"Vast Corpse.\"\n\"Vast\" denotes the solidity of stone;\n\"Dark Evolution\" signifies freedom and pursuit.\nAs po belongs to yin, it delights in wandering—\nThus, it is called Dark Evolution.\n\nSilent, formless, the ancestral origin,\nThe Doushu resists the Great Veil.\nSpirit transforms, the Four Sceneries divide,\nMyriad strands of emerald and vermilion auroras.\nThe preceding chapter spoke of the Primordial Qi’s division,\nThe Three Qi’s differentiation;\nThis speaks of the Four Sceneries,\nThe heavens transformed from the Brahma Qi beneath the Three Qi.\n\"Resists\" means to shield,\nDwelling beneath the Great Veil like a barrier.\nEmerald and vermilion auroras—\nThe

death and departure,\nPursuing the six grottoes’ yin demons as companions.\nThe immortal scriptures possess methods to restrain po:\nClose the qi for seven breaths,\nKnock the teeth seven times,\nThe mind visualizes white qi at the tip of the nose,\nGradually expanding to pervade the entire body.\nThen swallow saliva seven times,\nVigorously call the po’s names: Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Yin,\nFlying Poison, Heavenly Thief, Expel Filth, Fetid Lung.\nAfter calling, settle into stillness—\nThe po will naturally calm.\n\nThe Divine Duke Wang is said to be:\nThe Jade Clarity High Minister, once commanded to subdue the Northern Feng,\nOverseeing the punitive hosts—\nHence, he is called the Divine Duke.\nSubduing his martial prowess,\nHe gathers back the wandering po.\nMoreover, the Liver Spirit, the Peerless Duke,\nNamed Mysterious Origin Shu, styled Divine Duke,\nGoverns the hun.\nCultivators must ensure the hun constantly attends the po,\nLike sunlight carrying moonlight’s substance,\nThe po constantly restrains the hun,\nLike moonlight receiving sunlight.\nThus, the hun does not stray, the po does not depart—\nOnly then can one ascend as an immortal.\nIf the po does not receive the hun, the hun does not carry the po,\nThe hun wanders and the po descends—\nThen the person dies.\nNow that the wandering po has returned,\nRefining it coalesces into a pristine blossom, extending life,\nMatching the years of the great camphor.\n\"Riding the destiny, responding to the numinous chart\"—\nPraising those who study immortality with karmic affinity.\n\n**The Empty

radiant spirit,\nLushly gleaming like jade blossoms.\nThe Doushu opens the Great Possession,\nOne celebration enjoys abundant blessings.\nThe Supreme Sage turns the Emperor’s chariot,\nThe Infant suddenly sings.\nOverwhelmed by the auspicious occasion’s assembly,\nAll bow in reverence and harmony.\n\nThe Empty Grotto’s Spirit-Birth Chapter,\nJade tones soar beyond the nine auroras—\nThe sounds of jade scriptures,\nCombining the Three Grottoes’ flying mysterious qi\nTo form the essence of the nine auroras.\nOne chant and recitation,\nHeaven and earth’s myriad spirits converge in assembly.\nHow could the yin and yang, hun and po, essence and brightness of my body\nFail to unite as one household?\nMaster Wang says:\n*Po takes hun as its household;\nHun and po united, how could they diverge?*\nNine revolutions complete the radiant spirit—\nMerit fulfilled, spirit and qi fully equipped.\nRadiant spirit: the luminous numinous qi within the body.\nJade blossoms: the appearance of radiance.\nHere, one sees the Doushu Heaven Emperor’s great merit in delivering humanity.\n\"One celebration enjoys abundant blessings\"—\nLong life and enduring vision, free from calamity.\nThe

      "translated_text": "The heavens form human shape through the qi of the Five Phases—Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water—internally arranging the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys to store the *hun*, *shen*, *yi*, *po*, and *jing*. In heaven, these correspond to the Five Stars and the Five Emperors; in humanity, to the Five Constants; in function, to seeing, speaking, thinking, bearing, and hearing. Those who cultivate the Dao ensure the Five Qi reside at the center to coalesce the Origin of Destiny—hence called the \"Central Numinous Qi of the Five Immortals.\"\n\nFluttering, the Five Emperors’ chariots,\nDrifting, the Gate of Mystery Above.\nStrolling the Yellow Flower Wilderness,\nRevolving the numinous chariot at Heaven’s edge.\nGathering the soaring spirits of the void,\nFew of the old souls remain.\n\"Fluttering, drifting\"—both describe the aspect of soaring flight.\nThe Five Emperors are none other than the Joyous Heavenly Emperors, who often command their chariots to roam. The *Gate of Mystery Above* is the Gate of the Mysterious Capital. *Yellow Flower* refers to the harmonious void of Great Emptiness. *Revolving the numinous* means lingering the divine chariot at Heaven’s edge, gazing down upon the world to sing and gather the scattered souls, returning them to life. Yet, as the ages stretch into obscurity, the old souls have worn away, and few remain. As the ancients said: *\"To lose the human form is to wander ten thousand kalpas without hope\"*—how grievous!\n\nThe *Yellow Banner of the Supreme Subtlety* revolves,\nThe *Numinous Pennant of Wu Ying* summons.\nDrawing forth from the Long Night’s abode,\nOpening deliverance to receive the living souls.\nThe earlier passage spoke of how few old souls remain, fearing they may dissipate in the harsh winds or sink into the various destinies. Thus, the Lesser Lad of the *Supreme Subtlety*, named *Jing Jing*, is commanded to turn the Central Yellow Banner before the Emperor, gathering the wandering souls. The Noble Son *Wu Ying*, master of the liver’s *hun*-spirit, is ordered to grasp the *Numinous Pennant of Destiny* to summon the soul-qi, refining them anew to be reborn in the *Supreme Subtlety*. According to the *Qingxuan Commentary on the Scripture of Salvation*: The Great Lord of Longevity of the Southern Culmen—also the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound—governs the *Supreme Subtlety* and oversees the fire-refinement. Long-immersed in darkness, the souls must enter the fire to shatter yin’s turbidity and restore yang’s radiance. When the heart-source is purified and karmic filth dissolved, the spirit is transformed through emptiness, returning to the human realm.\n\nThe Noble Son aids *Huang Ning*,\nCollating form and spirit as one.\nJade chapters illumine the hidden numinous,\nFive revolutions part heaven and earth.\nQi refines the primordial zangfu,\nPurple portals birth immortals of their own.\nThe Noble Son *Wu Ying* is the spirit of the *hun*. *Huang Ning* refers to the Three Perfected of Essence and Blood, named the *Lord of Primordial Life*. When *hun* and essence-blood assist one another, collating them into unity, form and spirit become whole. *Illumining the hidden* means revealing the subtle within the obscure. Those who cultivate the Dao cause the Brahma-qi to revolve, the Emperor’s True Self to enter stillness, golden light to shine forth, and drifting clouds to linger—naturally, the tiger’s roar summons wind, the dragon’s chant gathers clouds, and the Great Treasure is achieved.\n\nSome say: Heaven One generates Water to stabilize nature; Earth Two generates Fire to stabilize the heart; Heaven Three generates Wood to stabilize form; Earth Four generates Metal to stabilize qi; Heaven Five generates Earth to stabilize the Central Palace. This is called the \"gathering of the Five Phases.\" The *Ten Revolutions of the Returning Numinous Diagram* in the *Scripture of Salvation* states: Qian Nine and Kan One make ten; Kun Six and Li Four make ten; Xun Two and Dui Eight make ten; Gen Three and Zhen Seven make ten—these are the Ten Revolutions of the Returning Numinous, completing the supreme number of the celestial cycle, the Way of the myriad qi’s return to the origin.\n\nThus, Heaven Three (Wood) and Earth Two (Fire) dwell together to form the first five; Earth Four (Metal) and Heaven One (Water) dwell together to form the second five. Wu and Ji, with the number five, reside in central harmony, uniting the Four Images to birth the Infant—this is called the \"Three and Five Returning to One.\"\n\nAccording to the *River Diagram*: Heaven One, Earth Two, Heaven Three, Earth Four, Heaven Five—these are the generating numbers of Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth in heaven. One plus five makes six, for Water halts upon meeting Earth. Two plus five makes seven, for Fire is nurtured by Earth. Three plus five makes eight, for Wood is planted by Earth. Four plus five makes nine, for Metal is born through Earth. The phrase *\"Five revolutions part heaven and earth\"* means the Four Images are inherently natural, though belonging to heaven, they have names but no form. Only when harmonized with Earth do they take shape, becoming of the earth. After these five revolutions, the Five Qi, Five Essences, and Five Spirits congeal, ascending to the Purple Portal—thus the elixir is complete.\n\nThe numbers complete, the assembly of perfected beings,\nYang stirs, responses flourish.\nJade maidens anoint with five fragrances,\nThe Holy Mother rejoices for the myriad lives.\nThe Three Realms unite in joy,\nBowing their heads to the Heavenly Venerable.\n*Numbers complete* refers to the nine revolutions. When the inner elixir of cultivation is achieved, one must refine it through nine cycles, like a pregnancy of nine months. *\"Yang stirs, responses flourish\"* means that once the yang-spirit is formed, the transformations within the body resonate with abundant auspicious signs. Those who persevere in cultivation to this realm will witness its efficacy. *\"Anointing with five fragrances\"* refers to the Jade Maidens of the Yellow Flower guiding the true qi of the Five Directions to bathe the body. It is also said: when the elixir ripens, fragrance permeates the bones and crowns the head. The *Holy Mother* is the *Holy Mother of Primordial Qian*, who once protected the body at birth—now witnessing the Dao’s completion, how could she not rejoice? Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, who have guarded this path, also delight. Since the great virtue of life and completion belongs to heaven, all bow their heads to the Heavenly Venerable.\n\n**The Sixth Chapter of the Heaven-Born Spirit in the Resonant Transformation of the Cavernous Mystery: Heavenly Qi of White Hue**\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states:\n*This is the qi of the Heavenly Soul’s essence, the Primordial Yang.*\n*The Emperor’s True Spirit Palace, the Origin of Destiny, the Qi of the Lofty Perfected’s Harmonious Fusion.*\nThe Emperor’s name: *[redacted]*\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the *Lord of Harmonious Fusion of the Radiant Empyrean* was transformed and born—this Heaven’s Emperor, whose Origin of Destiny and Spirit Palace begin with true qi.\n\nMaster *Dou* of the Western Marchmount’s *Guide to Cultivating the Dao* says: *\"At six months of life, the Six Fluids stabilize the Six Palaces, nourishing the numinous.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The term \"Mysterious Effulgence is but a name\" signifies that when ghosts and spirits first become human, they differ not from sages and worthies—how could they be deemed weak? Yet through kalpas of birth and death, their Heavenly Truth is withered by the passions and desires, and thus they are no longer strong. The *Feathered Chapters of the Joyous True Beam of the Mysterious* states: \"Beating their wings, they soar through the ninefold firmament, their mournful cries resounding through the Mysterious Beam.\" Knowing them to be birds of heaven, their names diverge from the common. This speaks of the work of refining the embryo to return to the primordial—precisely the effort to gather and settle in stillness, not to lightly take flight like the Mysterious Beam.\n\n*Qí* means \"to wish.\" The *Nanhua Scripture* says: \"The marsh pheasant takes ten steps to peck, a hundred steps to drink, yet does not wish to be reared in a cage.\" Though the pheasant’s sustenance in the wild is arduous, it will never desire captivity, where freedom is lost. So too with humans: bound and constrained, pent-up and stagnant, they lose their Heavenly Truth. Only by scattering and releasing their thoughts, treading the common Way, then severing the stagnation of the womb-tree and the dead *qi* of the embryo, can they be utterly unobstructed and ascend in spirit to the Jade Capital.\n\nThe fulfillment of the wish is most profound: awakening to the mystery of mysteries, I forget both principle and self. Supreme blessings arise from the nine heavens, propitious moments converge with earthly seasons. When the wish is fulfilled—awakening to the profound Dao—one accords with one’s original aspiration. Once awakened, all distinctions of right and wrong, self and other, are forgotten. At this point, blessings arrive unbidden, seasons become naturally auspicious—what path is not felicitous?\n\nMerging the transformations to return to the primordial One,\nLoftily conjoined with the Primordial Sovereign.\nI bow my head to the fellowship of the numinous journey,\nForever parting from the clamor and dust of the world.\n\nBlending the *qi* of the Three Origins of creation, one returns to the One, above corresponding to the Primordial Beginning, below presiding over the body. As it is said: \"Though the Heavenly Honored One is distant and wondrous, it is near—bound to the Lord of the Mud-Pill Palace.\" On the day the Dao of immortality is perfected, one also meets with a propitious moment. *Xiè* means \"to sever,\" *xiāo* means \"clamor,\" and *zhāng* means \"to soar.\" From this point onward, one forever severs the clamor of the world and the soaring dust of the mundane.\n\n**Chapter Seven of the *Heavenly Numinous Transformations*: The Birth of the Spirit in the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven**\n*The Purple Qi of Heavenly Qi*\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: \"This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, the true Yang.\" The *qi* of the Imperial True Origin Palace and the Life-Source High Immortal of the *Dongji* Cavern. The imperial name is Wuyun-*. The *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* says: \"In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of the Jade Rosy Cloud Cavern was born—this Emperor of Heaven, whose true *qi* forms the Origin Palace, the beginning of the life-source.\"\n\nMaster Dou of the Western Marchmount said: \"When a person reaches seven months of age, the seven essences open, and the seven apertures become luminous. The outer ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, and the inner heart orifice all become bright and clear, naturally endowed with awareness. In cultivating the truth, at this seventh transformation, one has already attained the state of the seven awakenings: dark wisdom is thoroughly lucid, the roots and dust are severed, being and non-being are both empty, and the myriad dharmas are extinguished. All kalpas—past and future, the three realms and ten directions, the roots of self and other, past and future—are penetrated in sevenfold and eightfold clarity, pervading above and below, with all principles fully present. Hence it is called the *High Immortal Dongji* Cavern.\"\n\nThe Mysterious Convergence governs without bounds,\nMerging *qi* returns to the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven.\nDuty-Yet labors in numinous transformation,\nSilently advancing through endless seasons.\nRiding the reckoning to forge the steadfast bough,\nSleeve fluttering, brushing light feathers.\nWithin the jade chamber, wondrous tones arise,\nFloating upward to the lofty abode of the gods.\n\nThe Mysterious Convergence is the origin of the myriad Ways, governing the three realms—how could its wondrous function be limited? The merging *qi* blends the soaring Mysterious *qi* to return to the Brahmā-Assisting Heaven, restoring the Great Beginning. *Duty-Yet* is the revered spirit of the Great One, named *Duty-Yet the Gatherer*, who guards the rear gate of the human Mud-Pill Palace. In heaven, it silently operates the transformations, undeterred by cold or heat.\n\n\"Riding the reckoning to forge the steadfast bough\" means that by riding the reckoning of the seven passages, the Yang light congeals and coalesces, the hundred bones become steadfast and firm, like the branches of a tree. \"Sleeve fluttering, brushing light feathers\" signifies the imminent ascent. Then, suddenly, within the nine palaces of the Mud-Pill’s jade chamber, celestial harmonies spontaneously arise, joyous *qi* surges forth, fire dragons and dark cranes dance within the body, and the myriad spirits all ascend to the lofty divine palace. There, they merge with the Heavenly Emperor’s foremost Red Child—this is what is meant by \"within the jade chamber, wondrous tones arise, floating upward to the lofty abode of the gods.\"\n\nThe wheel of perfection turns without cease,\nTrue immortals arrayed in ordered ranks.\nThe highest celestial thoroughfares stretch afar,\nThe profound origin plunges ten thousandfold deep.\nLush leaves shade the kingfisher clouds,\nResting in the shade of the limpid islet.\n\nAccording to the *Perfect Methods of the Numinous Treasure*, this is the method of transcendence. The divine light shines through, penetrating the bodily husk, ascending to the Great Void, and joining the ranks of the true immortals. As for the distant celestial thoroughfares, gazing beside them reveals the cavernous emptiness, the cavernous void of the Great Mystery, the boundless expanse. Below lies a depth of ten thousand measures, yet I alone stand resplendent in the sea of tranquil nature, floating beneath the feathered canopy of lush leaves and kingfisher clouds. Below, I contemplate the limpid islet, serene and ever still.\n\nThe *Eight Yang Songs of the Plain* say:\n\"I soar with my feathered canopy,\nWandering the limpid islet.\nDelighting the five spirits,\nVoicing my thoughts to the radiant companions.\"\n\nThe five difficulties are dispelled by principle,\nThe impassive heart finds its joy.\nThe discourse on transcendence speaks of a single leap, yet if the five *qi*-spirits are not yet adept at emerging, they may come and go intermittently. One wanders and plays to become familiar, or if stray thoughts arise, one whistles and chants to disperse them, so that the hundred spirits all harmonize. The \"radiant companions\" are the spirits within the body.\n\nThe five difficulties remain unsettled in various accounts; perhaps the five demonic emperors still test one’s resolve. They can be dispelled by principle, ensuring the nature of heaven is pure and untainted by the slightest selfish human desire—only then does one accord with the supreme Dao. For in the work of cultivation, transcendence is the ultimate achievement, and the moment of transformation is most vulnerable to demonic trials. Thus, one must be vigilant.\n\nThe luminous soul follows its root,\nDiligent and unwearied, it abides in the void.\nThe seven recitations open the layered gates,\nDissolving stagnation—not through divine martial prowess.\nThe movement issues from within,\nA lofty chant, a bow of reverence.\n\nNature is the spirit of life;\nThe heart is the master of *qi*.\nWith the heart unburdened, the nature of heaven shines bright. One’s own luminous soul abides in the Great Void, diligent and unwearied, never straying from its root.",

      "translated_text": "The root is the primordial *qi*. Seven passages through the gates and orifices dissolve the dharmakāya, revealing afflictions alone—neither death nor life can become a burden. Without the numinous efficacy of the jade scriptures, how could such swiftness be attained?\n\nThat movement issues from within means what is within must manifest without. The lofty chant and bow of reverence signify a resonant intonation ascending in reverence.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Heaven of Luminous Clarity and Purity – The Birth of the Divine**\n*Heavenly qi* of azure hue.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, through which yang is communicated.

Once the true numen descends, the five viscera also generate their flowery essences.\n\nThe *Great Cavern* has ten flowery gates of the Purple Portal:\n- Heaven One’s essence communicates with the Cinnabar Flower of the Great Prime,\n- Earth Two’s *qi* communicates with the Dark Mystery Azure Flower,\n- Heaven Three’s spirit communicates with the Myriad Births Plain Flower,\n- Earth Four’s brahma communicates with the Ten Directions Yellow Flower,\n- Heaven Five’s origin communicates with the Jade Flower of the Great Clarity,\n- Earth Six’s origin communicates with the Nether Yin Metal Flower,\n- Heaven Seven’s origin communicates with the Great Mystery Green Flower,\n- Earth Eight’s origin communicates with the Highest Clarity Azure Flower,\n- Heaven Nine’s origin communicates with the Jade Void Jade Flower,\n- Earth Ten’s *xuan* communicates with the Jade Clarity, the Primal Chaos of the Great Non-Being.\n\nThe ten flowers connect to the void—this is the *qi* of the true numen’s transformation and congealment.\n\nIn the luminous clarity of the layered heavens above,\nThe appointed meeting is at the edge of auspicious clouds.\nThe jade scriptures disperse into the soaring heart,\nThe solitary radiance seeks the numinous assembly.\n\nThe Emperor of the Heaven of Luminous Clarity resides in the layered heavens above—this must be a heaven beyond the formless realm. Meeting with the various heavens at the edge of auspicious clouds, one recites the jade scriptures to arouse the unfettered spirit, dispersing the soaring and free heart.\n\nAuspicious clouds are neither smoke nor clouds—they are the wondrous *qi* of supreme harmony.\n\nMaster Sima the Perfected says: The solitary radiance is the character of the Flowery Mansion, the lord who convenes the assembly of the numinous mansion.\n\nScattering radiance and rosy clouds spread,\nNo spirit’s lapel fails to transcend.\nJade branches flow with ethereal sounds,\nLeisurely in the void, wondrous words arise.\n\nThese all describe the scenery of the heavens. The scattering radiance refers to the vibrant, intermingling hues of rosy clouds. *Jin* (lapel) is synonymous with *jin* (collar), signifying that the heart’s expanse is without exception transcendent. The ethereal sounds of jade branches—are these not the winds of heaven stirring the soaring forests?\n\nThe *Great Cavern*’s verses contain: *\"Mysterious songs disperse the soaring lapel, jade branches flow with ethereal sounds.\"* This precisely refers to the wondrous conversations of the assembly of perfected immortals, who together discourse on the profound principle.\n\nNuminous sounds vibrate through the empty cavern,\nThe nine mysteries depart from dark descendants.\nWith clarity and vigor, no stagnation remains,\nComing and going like untying a sash.\n\nHaving awakened to the birth of the divine chapter,\nOne soars high without ultimate defeat.\nOnce a cultivator has transcended the self,\nThey should extend the merit of the divine scriptures—\nAbove, repaying the nine mysteries,\nBelow, aiding the obscured souls—\nAll are enabled to hear the scriptures and suddenly awaken,\nMoving freely, no longer fettered by karmic obstructions.\nComing and going in life and death is like loosening a belt.\n\nYet an elder once said: *\"Arriving is like putting on a staff, departing is like removing trousers.\"* This speaks of having nothing to cling to. If one can truly awaken to the profound subtleties of the jade scriptures and achieve the work of transcendence, then the true nature endures forever, unharmed through kalpas.\n\nMysterious radiance illuminates the clouded thoroughfare,\nTraces transcend beyond the divine directions.\nResponsive and perceptive, without fixed form,\nOne casually moves the four great elements.\nWith focused heart, bowing and reciting,\nAll sages together praise with delight.\n\nThe mysterious radiance is the name of a dragon. The perfected one rides the dragon to ascend to heaven, its light illuminating the clouded thoroughfare. Their traces transcend beyond the divine directions, for their transformed dharmakāya can respond and perceive without fixed form.\n\nMoving the four great elements refers to circulating through the four heavens of the formless realm.\n\n*\"Together praise with delight\"*—the Feathered Transcendent Lord once said: *\"Today, tomorrow—what a pity, what a pity! When the great limit arrives, what power will you have? You cannot rely on mere words, nor on ink on paper. When the sages of the ten directions nod their heads, that is when the cultivator truly attains.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, No-Attachment – The Birth of the Divine**\n*Heavenly qi* of black hue.\n\nThe *Golden Book of Secret Characters* states: This is the *qi* of the celestial soul’s essence, through which yang begins to sprout. The true *qi* of the Imperial Marchmount Mansion, the life-force of the naturally mysterious illumination.\n\nThe Emperor’s name is *Lingji*.\n\nThe *Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel* states: In the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era, the Mysterious Illumination Lord of Shenxiao was born—this celestial emperor governs the heavens through the true *qi* as the origin of the life-force of the Marchmount Mansion.\n\nMaster Lü of Floating Mountain says: This is the heaven of the seed people above the formless realm. The original nature of humans is profoundly clear and empty, like the great void, admitting nothing. Deluded thoughts and attachments are like flowers in the sky; the cycle of birth and death is like knots forming in emptiness. If one can return to the root and restore the origin, not a single thought arising, all conditions suddenly ceasing, one is then born into this heaven and begins to become indestructible.\n\nFor those who cultivate the truth, it begins with overcoming thoughts and culminates in thoughtlessness. When all yin influences are dissolved and the true nature is perfectly luminous, one decisively transcends the three realms—this is the indestructible true emptiness, the supreme dharmakāya.\n\nThe Left Attendant Perfected says: The Marchmount Mansion is the human skull. When the form is first complete at birth, there must be a numen to govern it. With the numen, there is the origin; with the origin, there is the flower; with the flower, life begins. The Marchmount is the gate through which all spirits enter and exit, and it must be fully formed before the skull can solidify it. In infants, this is the fontanelle. As the *qi* returns to nourish the root, it becomes the dwelling of all spirits—this is called the numinous. It is so named because its numinosity can reflect downward, hence \"illumination.\"\n\nWithout knots, truly without emotion,\nIn profound profundity, the void settles.\nThe wheel of transformation has no fixed sequence,\nIts reckoning neither adheres nor deviates.\n\nThe perfected one is indifferent and detached, the heart without knots, the nature without emotional movement. Serene and settled, they do not follow the sequence of cyclic transformation, nor do they deviate from the changes of yin and yang.",

      "translated_text": "Who says the realm of formlessness is level?\nLofty and towering, it brims with hills and mounds.\nWith a stilled heart, one may roam freely,\nYet only through the summons of the Three Clarities may the spirit ascend in purity.\n\nSuch an encounter is not measured in years,\nNor can kalpas fathom its reckoning.\nThe formless realm is the境 of the Upper Clarity.\nWho claims this land is flat? It too is shaped by *qi*,\nits high ridges and vast mounds like the jade peaks of the celestial capital, towering and grand—yet still one may ascend and gaze upon them.\nIf the seeker of immortality wishes to still the heart and wander freely,\nthey must await the summons of the Three Clarities to reach that place—\ntruly a rare encounter of a thousand ages.\n\nThe floating *shuang* follows its destined path,\nRebirth from the womb is an eternal principle.\nWhen the numinous stirs the Great Void,\nOne strides upon the frost of the empyrean.\nThe celestial ford stirs ten thousand currents,\nAs the hidden spirit ascends in true stillness.\nWithout attachment, there is no sorrow;\nFrom the lofty vantage, one bows and ascends.\n\nThe floating *shuang* returning to the womb refers to the *Dadong Jing*,\nwhere myriad ancestors across kalpas—kin bound by *qi*—\ndissolve their lingering attachments and together attain rebirth.\nFor descendants and forebears share the same *qi*;\nwhen one’s own body transcends, ancestors too may return to the womb and become immortals—\nthis is the natural principle, why doubt it?\nMoreover, the spirit within the body is the Three Ones of the Grand Tenuity,\nin perfect resonance with the Great Void, soaring freely above the frigid heights of the empyrean.\n\nWhen the celestial ford stirs ten thousand currents, it is the Milky Way one crosses.\nAs the Lady of Purple Tenuity says:\n*\"The dark waves shake the azure tides,\nThe vast ford stirs ten thousand currents,\nI ride the light, gazing upon the Six Voids,\nYearning to wander with the fair one.\"*\n\nThough one may ascend to celestial immortality,\none must still concentrate the spirit and refine the true,\ncleansing all attachments to love—\nonly then may one attain perfect freedom.\nThus we know that love is the root of sorrow.\nWithout love, there is no sorrow.\n\nIt is said that the nature of humanity is originally pure,\nserene as still water, unstained by even a speck of dust—\nthus it endures across kalpas.\nBut once tainted by love, delusion’s clouds obscure the sky,\nkarmic winds churn the waters,\nand purity is lost forever.\nLove gives rise to desire, desire to affliction,\na tangle of false thoughts, ceaseless toil,\nthe convergence of all suffering.\nOne drifts through the waves of the sea of desire,\ntrapped in the cycle of birth and death without end,\nwhile karmic consciousness flourishes and hells arise.\n\nThe seven emotions and six desires all harm the nature—\nwhy single out love?\nYet love is the sprout of karmic conditions,\nthe ladder and go-between of passions and desires.\nIts poison is sweet and soft, beguiling the unwary,\nseeping deeper day by day, binding ever more tightly.\nWithout wisdom, courage, and steadfast resolve—\nwithout awakening to the eternal truth—\nwho can sever it?\nThe nine chapters’ work, from self-cultivation and embryo refinement to final ascension,\ncompletes the task.\nYet love is still spoken of here,\nlest one grow complacent, mistaking it for the norm,\nunaware that it is the root of eternal sorrow and suffering.\nEven the slightest trace, if not scoured clean, bars liberation.\nThus the sage, in the final chapter, draws back the bolt and turns the key—\nthe meaning is profound.\nAs for gazing upon the celestial thoroughfare and bowing in ascent,\nthis awaits those yet to come.\n\n**Ode of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One**\n*To the Divine and Serene Emperor of the Supreme Ultimate*\n\nThough the Great Dao has no heart,\nIt may be sought with devotion.\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*\"I know not its name, so I style it ‘Dao,’\nAnd by force call it ‘Great.’\"*\nIf the Dao itself is nameless,\nhow could it possess a heart?\nYet those who seek the Dao cannot do so without devotion.\n\nI halt my spirit-chariot in the emptiness,\nGazing back at the azure currents, vast as motes of dust—\nlike the poet who called himself *\"a grain of millet in the boundless sea.\"*\nThe Three Realms are the realms of desire, form, and formlessness.\nWhen body and mind transcend these,\npure and luminous, unbound,\none may wander the Jade Capital.\n\nWithout a heaven-sent stalwart to guide the way,\nWho can fathom these mysteries?\nThe Milky Way stretches, clear and boundless,\nIn reverence, one moves through the void’s softness.\nWithout such a heaven-born, destiny-appointed talent,\nwho could grasp this subtle truth?\nIn the space between heaven and earth, the greatest joy resides.\nThe void is the form of heaven;\nsoftness, the nature of earth.\n\nThe seven *xuan* disperse the dark night,\nReturning to the womb, one follows the ebb and flow.\nThe seven *xuan* are the seven *po*.\nRebirth through womb-breathing follows the rise and fall of yin and yang.\n\nIf one’s destiny is hidden and still,\nEven the calamities of the *yang* nine hold no terror.\nThe cycles of life and death, the disasters of the *yang* nine—\nif one’s fate is fixed in silent stillness,\nif one can conceal one’s light and concentrate the spirit,\nthere is nothing to fear.\nAs the *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Abide in timeliness, follow the natural order,\nAnd sorrow and joy cannot enter.\"*\n\nBeholding the meetings of departure and return,\nOne lingers but a while.\nCast aside the self, and the self endures—\nSuch is the company of true immortals.\nThe Perfected One observes how swiftly life and death pass,\nhow fleeting the respite before death.\nOne must strive in cultivation,\nfreeing the heart from all within and without—\nonly then is the true preserved.\nThe *Daode Jing* says:\n*\"Cast aside the self, and the self endures.\"*\nSuch a one is surely the true companion of immortals.\n\nStill and deep, the mysteries of the profound,\nClear and boundless, the waves of the Milky Way.\nChange and decay follow one another in endless cycles,\nYet the *chun* tree’s branches remain unchanged.\nThe mysteries of the profound are like the Milky Way’s ceaseless flow.\nThe cycles of birth and death are the suffering of an unending wheel,\nbut those who attain the Dao stand apart,\nlike the great *chun* tree, untouched by the blooming and withering of lesser plants.\nThough frost and stars pass by, its branches and leaves remain unaltered.\nThe *Nanhua Jing* says:\n*\"Life and death are great matters,\nYet they cannot change one who is beyond change.\"*\n\nStill the heart and contemplate the utmost truth,\nFollow the *qi*’s movements, escape the net of doubt.\nWhen resonance and principle are ever in accord,\nThe spirit attains its proper course and departs.\nStill the heart and contemplate the utmost truth—\nthis is the resolve to seek the Dao.\n*Luo* is the net.\nFollow the movements of yin and yang’s *qi*,\nescape the snares of doubt,\nand when resonance and principle are in harmony,\nthe spirit naturally attains its proper path and departs.",
