  "full_translation": "**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Upper Clarity Collection***\n*Record of Wandering to Immortal Rock*\n*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\nYellow leaves drift like clouds; fresh geese inscribe the sky. Garden orchids shatter jade; fence chrysanthemums forge gold.\n\nA traveler arrived from Qiongzhou—hair unbound, beard flowing, face weathered, feet bare. His body was clad in coarse hemp, his scriptures half-exposed from their wrappings. A staff slung across his shoulder, his qi transcended the dust. He sought the Three Flowers of Upper Clarity, paying homage to Master Yun Gu at dusk.\n\nBamboo sealed the emerald mist; eaves bells summoned the wind. A lamp glowed faintly red; nesting magpies called their young. The guest loosened his heart, drinking from waterfalls and consuming lingzhi. At midnight, he took his pillow, lying down without dreams. At dawn, he leaned by the window, pursing his lips to sing:\n\n*\"On parasol branches, autumn winds rise;\nGreen waters merge with the sky, sky mirrors water.\nA few crows dot the purple dusk hills;\nThe slanting sun’s shadow falls among reed flowers.\nBees end their court, frogs hold their market;\nA staff rests on my shoulder as I sleep beneath peach mushrooms.\nAt daybreak, the moon’s trace fades—\nOh, when shall I find an extraordinary man\nTo roam Immortal Rock in freedom?\"*\n\nMaster Yun Gu rose and sang in reply:\n\n*\"Wine just sobered, sleep just broken—\nA guest’s long song echoes beyond jade screens.\nI shall tune my voice to clarity, shake my jade collar,\nRide a single leaf on the wind, the azure pool clear.\nGathering the crisp qi of a thousand peaks and ten thousand gorges,\nI return to recline high among pine lattices,\nTo forge a poetic pact with you.\"*\n\nAt dawn the next day, they moored a small willow boat beneath Carp Rock. Level fields spread in twilight; crows and egrets divided black and white. Jagged mountains unfolded; pines and bamboos sketched themselves in ink. Releasing the reins, they ascended Chicken Coop Stone—mountain blossoms dazzled the eyes; rock birds clamored in the ears. Wandering freely, they climbed Tianzhu Peak. The ancient temple stood with four bare walls; cypress seeds rustled in the deep hall. Crimson peaks touched the sky; green vines bridged the void. Gibbons howled at dusk; the moon hung over withered trees. Tigers roared in the clear night; wind howled through a thousand hollows. A sparse bell chimed into the cloud chamber. Holding a gourd, they sought the Cinnabar Well.\n\nSeated on the dustless rock, they chanted a poem:\n\n*\"Atop the peak, a turtledove calls the morning rain;\nPale mist seals the path before the crag.\nLast night, heavy dew dripped from cold pines;\nBroken clouds, homeless, are torn by the wind.\"*\n\nStaff in hand, sandals in order, they rode the wind, ready to depart. Here, Master Yun Gu bowed and spoke of the marvels of the elixir knife. The guest stroked the stone and sang:\n\n*\"In the crescent-moon furnace, crow and hare;\nWithin the cinnabar tripod, dragon and tiger.\nBlack mercury enters red lead—\nIn the red furnace, a single grain rounds.\"*\n\nMaster Yun Gu and the traveler from Qiongzhou then returned. Gibbons wailed in ancient ravines; cranes cried over tinkling springs. The watery realm had no boats; they dragged bamboo along the shore. A lone village where oxen slept; flowing water and white clouds—desolate as Mount Lu.\n\nLater, Master Yun Gu returned to his former abode, but the guest had already wandered away. Thus, he recorded their journey.\n\n---\n\n**Record of Cloud Nest**\n\nWuyi Mountain is a grotto-heaven. Immortals may hide or appear. Long ago, Qian Keng consumed purple lingzhi here, mastering wind and qi. The divine maiden gathered yellow wood, summoning wind and commanding rain. Among the perfected like Zhang and Wei, thirteen men and women attained immortality. In some unknown year, on an autumn evening, the Jade Emperor feasted his descendants. After one cup, flutes and drums echoed in the void. Those present, clad in rainbow skirts and misty sleeves, had already become immortals.\n\nLater generations spoke of Elixir-Refining Rock and Bone-Exchanging Rock—echoes of those bygone events. Legends tell of Daoist Li at Stop-Stop Hermitage, Li Iron Flute at Banner Peak Pavilion, and Li the Mirror-Polisher in Mao Bamboo Grotto—were they one Li or three? Below Ascension Cave lived Zhang Golden Toad; below Drum Cave, Zhang the Straw-Clad—one Zhang or two? Then there was Zhan of Drum Tower Rock, Ge of Spirit Rock, and the late Daoist Wu Huaiyu. All were seen in the mountains, now halting, now soaring on the wind, drifting on leaves across water. Crimson temples, green hair, steps swift as flight. Some shed their forms; some achieved liberation through the corpse. Some vanished; some remained. Those who longed for them could never speak with them.\n\nYet how startling—after a thousand years, immortal traces are few. Only green grass and white clouds endure. The cries of gibbons and cranes are too sorrowful to bear.\n\nThen there was Master Chen of the Cinnabar Pivot. He abstained from grains, taking no sustenance. Though seventy or eighty, his eyes remained bright as lacquer, his hair black, his complexion youthful. No one knew his origins. All day, he sat in silent absorption, his waking and sleeping, laughter and speech unlike ordinary men. His only possession was a tattered sleeve. For a day, he lingered among the Five Bends, reciting Master Huiweng’s verse: *\"The mountain is high, the clouds deep.\"* The misty rain over the level forest seemed as if from yesterday.\n\nThere, he felled bamboo and thatched reeds, building a hut. He named it *Cloud Nest*. Behind it rose the Great Hidden Screen; before it stood the Three Teachings Peak. To the left, Immortal’s Palm; to the right, Heavenly Pillar. Facing the Elixir Furnace Stone, resting against Iron Elephant Rock—shaped like dragons and tigers, wondrous indeed!\n\nA hundred paces east reached Benevolence and Wisdom Hall; a hundred paces west, Immortal’s Journey Lodge. The pines were green, the bamboo emerald, the grass verdant. Cold gibbons called at dawn; azure mist curled. Tower crows hastened dusk; purple haze spread. Clouds flew like white blossoms; crows let fall their crisp cries. How much more the mountain’s blue, the water’s jade, the wind’s clarity, the moon’s whiteness—this land of no human traces.\n\nIf one asked a year of the world, it was but a day in this grotto. No exaggeration. Ah, true joy is enough! Fitting for the old man of the Cinnabar Pivot.\n\nAs for the hut becoming the man, the man the hut—merged with the streams and mountains, transformed with the wind and moon—there were matters of red simurghs and purple lips, blue crows and white cranes. The master knew them.\n\nAfter *Cloud Nest* was thatched, on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the *yihai* year of Jiading (1209), mist and rosy clouds lingered as of old.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Hall of Lingering Sojourn**\n\nBai Yuchan thatched a hut on Wuyi Mountain. One morning, he felt the stirrings of lakes and seas. Staff in hand, sandals fluttering, he had not taken many steps when he turned back to his old hut—gibbons startled, cranes cried. After a few waves of his sleeves, he found himself already in Yanshan.\n\nEncountering a Daoist in coarse robes, he led him back to the hall, following the old custom of burning cypress seeds in the hearth. Setting aside the tea bowls after battle, they spoke of the flavor of clouds and waters—so withered, so austere. They spoke, too, of the Way of learning: so arduous, so profound. Thereupon I said: \"This place lies not far beyond eighty-four thousand miles, above which lies the capital of the Great Clarity, the Jasper Terrace and Cinnabar Mound, pearl forests and jade grottoes, precious blossoms and rare herbs, all resplendent to the eye. Exquisite birds and rare fowl fill the air with the music of *shao* and *hu*. There dwell a thousand long-robed, wide-sleeved immortals, their bodies light as goose down, who daily sport with blue simurghs and dance with white cranes. In a fleeting moment, they peer down upon the Five Defiled Worlds of suffering, where sentient beings spin through birth and death, death and birth, like ants on a millstone—unable to bear it, their noses grow sour with grief.\n\nThus they incarnate their spirits in the womb of dust, shape their forms within the realm of form. From swaddling to topknot, they never forget their former lives’ resolve to cultivate the true and nurture the primordial. Rousing fierce courage, mustering diligent effort, they cast off worldly garb and mar their appearances, seeking guidance among the followers of the Dao. Herein lies the beauty of their compassion for all beings.\n\nSome wear filthy faces and pine-needle hair; others go barefoot with shorn temples. Some don crowns askew like *ruyi* wands; others don robes of serene simplicity. Some wear blue headscarves and paper jackets; others wield great swords or long zithers. Some carry single gourds or straw hats; others lean on ornate staffs and wear hempen sandals. They wander through villages, drift along country paths. The world’s people vie to gaze upon them, point at them with their fingers, elders tell the young, one neighbor informs another: *These are Daoists.*\n\nYet the Dao cannot be named or spoken; its vastness resides only in the human heart. Thus the ancients composed alchemical classics, then shaped them into songs and poems, treatises and dialogues—all to reveal the essence of the Golden Elixir, to serve as a bridge for later learners, guiding them toward the immortal throng. What is called lead, silver, mercury, cinnabar is but dragon and tiger, water and fire. What is called hare and crow, chamber and wall is but horse and ox, tortoise and snake. What is called husband and wife, male and female is but ruler and minister, parent and child. What is called *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li* is but heaven and earth, sun and moon. They are likened to Ding Gong and Yellow Hag, named as Infant and Crone, borrowed as yellow thatch and white snow—yet all reduce to the two words: *yin* and *yang*. Through gradual accumulation, one attains liberation from the corpse; through steady progress, one ascends in flight.\n\nIn essence: form and sleeve, body and mind, spirit and *qi*, nature and destiny—all are one principle. Boring through the Five Phases to gather the Five *Qi*, uniting the Three Essences to congeal the Three Flowers—such is the cultivation called the Elixir; such is the entry called the Dao. Thus the Daoist in heaven and earth is assuredly no ordinary being.\n\nAlas! In years past, they hollowed earth to make huts, wove grass for nests. In cold, they sewed orchids; in hunger, they ate magic mushrooms. Dwelling in the forest, a few notes from an iron flute would unlock the boundless secrets of heaven and earth. Before ascending to the heavens, they nested their bodies and reduced their ambitions to ash, fearing only that idle fame might reach others’ ears, or that their strange forms might offend the eye. They forgot themselves among streams and mountains, fish and birds, merged with wind and moon, mist and rosy clouds. White clouds drifted endlessly; green grass spread lushly. Beneath towering pines and verdant bamboo, though they dared not hope for flesh to sprout wings, they at least aspired to sit for a thousand years, watching mulberry fields turn to seas, seas to mulberry fields—such were the Daoists.\n\nYet the world now suffers a degenerate age, its customs coarsened by the drumbeat of frivolity. Later generations, like fish and dragons, know only beans and wheat. Thus was built this abode of Lingering Clouds and Perching Cranes, to house such men, allowing them to recline in the forest of ropes, lounge on mushroom couches. Torrential rains and fierce winds cannot harm their bodies; freezing ice and piled snow cannot chill their frames. How fitting that body finds peace and the Dao flourishes!\n\nFortunately, within the palace gates there often appear extraordinary men, scholars with the hearts of great men and noble lords, who build halls to shelter these disciples, lend grain to feed them. Thus the essence of the Golden Elixir endures, its thread unbroken, generation after generation producing those who trumpet this Way.\n\nThe Daoist Hall of Yanshan has stood for ages. Zhou Daoming of Siming, a standout among gourd-and-hat wanderers, initiated its founding discourse. There were Huangfu Rubing and Ruqu, men of leisurely elegance who ardently admired purity and emptiness. Long had they harbored the intent to welcome immortals and greet transcendents, regretting only that a single hand cannot sound the bell. This sentiment resonated deeply with Zhou Daoming.\n\nCarpenters wielded their axes, potters rolled up their sleeves, laborers and artisans worked in concert—all was swiftly accomplished. They named it *Lingering Clouds*. What delighted me most was that the Mysterious Net had revived, and the incense of the Wondrously Penetrating Old Man remained unextinguished. Upon inspection, the alchemical furnace stood in solitary splendor, the tea cauldron exuded carefree charm. There were rush cushions, leather mats, fresh *bo* boards, and plain walls—nothing strayed from ancient traditions. Morning and evening, congee was served in abundance; the fragrance of offerings lingered. Daoists gathered in quiet harmony, their headscarves and robes hung neatly on the walls.\n\nAmong those who split their forms to transform *qi*, who does not know the wonders of returning gold and mercury? Their comings and goings, their concealments and revelations—who can fathom them? Amidst poems and wine, they pluck a tune or two on the zither, dance three or four sword forms. Wild songs and rustic dances lead them homeward. Morning incense, evening lamps—all follows orderly discipline. Thus do the old men of rivers and lakes, the scholars of Chu and Yue, come in streams and settle in droves. Only then does Penglai’s Three Isles appear before one’s eyes, where feathered robes and rainbow skirts may be greeted face-to-face. Truly, the establishment of this Daoist hall is not in vain!\n\nIn former times, Prince Liu An of Han cultivated immortality; Prince Zhaoming of Liang pursued transcendence; Li Yuancao of Tang sought the Dao—all were extraordinary men from imperial clans. The master of this hall belongs to their lineage.\"\n\nOne day, perusing scriptures on Tiantai and refining the bones on Wuyi—all begins with today’s founding of this hall to gather scholars. The immortals of heaven, as spoken of before, manifest in the world as Daoist adepts, and so it is. Yet returning to the root and restoring the source, reverting to life’s origin—this alone does not suffice; there must be something extraordinary, rare in the world.\n\nWhy so? The fires of the elixir furnace burn bright; the crane of white clouds takes flight. Upon the head rests the *Yuling* crown of soaring jade; the body is clad in robes of *Baohua* black and white. Mounting the azure steed of the clouded midst, riding the rainbow phoenix of the celestial expanse, one ascends to the heavens’ zenith, pays homage to the Heavenly Emperor—at this moment, the immortal’s earthly mission is complete. Though not every seeker may attain the rank of Zhong or Lü, I suspect one or two among them shall.\n\nIf one possesses the discerning eye to encounter a youth with lacquer-black hair, who bears a *Boshan* censer and asks what path to pursue—such is the intent of this Daoist hall, such is the calling of the Daoist adept.\n\nWritten in joyful admiration to conclude this record.\n\nOn the second day after Rain Water in the *bingzi* year of Jiading, inscribed in haste by Juyin.\n\nWithin the Palace of Supreme Subtlety, the essence of the Star of Astral Legs transforms into the pine; the pine’s soul, the pine’s spirit—playing with the white dragon, soaring with the azure phoenix, lithe and luxuriant. Yet amid these, there dwells the Recluse of Seven Pines. The star of the Chamber Lodge in the Palace of Supreme Subtlety metamorphoses into the willow; the willow’s voice, the willow’s mystery—calling the golden oriole, entering the purple simurgh, trailing in gentle grace. Yet within the mist of light rain, there abides the Master of Five Willows. The ancients who concealed themselves among pines sought to manifest their lofty, unyielding integrity; those who hid among willows aimed to display their gentle, modest resolve. Yet who does not know that the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, such as these, endure in the annals of history, their names resounding through the ages? As for the orange—what manner of thing is it truly?\n\nIn Yangzhou, its boughs bear mandarins and pomelos; the tribute of Jiangling offers a thousand orange trees, their owners ranked with marquises of a thousand households—thus is the orange esteemed. The *Record of Local Customs* names the orange \"barbarian citron\"; the people of Ba speak of two elders concealed within an orange’s peel—thus is the orange deemed wondrous. The Xiang and Xiao rivers have their Orange Hamlets; Dongting Lake has its Orange Marsh; Yunmeng has its Orange Village; Pengze has its Orange Market—thus is the orange lauded. Lu Ji concealed oranges to present to his mother; Li Jing ate oranges and thought of his elder brother—thus may the orange embody filial piety and fraternal duty. Li Deyu composed the *Rhapsody on the Auspicious Orange*; Zhang Hua wrote the *Song of the Numinous Orange*—thus may the orange enter the realm of literature. Li Yuan had lines on \"crimson fruit like hanging gold\"; Shen Yue wrote of \"golden raiment, not what I seek.\" In the sixth month of the ninth day, the Penglai Palace of the Tang bestowed oranges upon its ministers; on the first day of the first month, the E-pang Palace of Qin did the same. The abundance of oranges in Dan Lake, the profusion in Han Isle—who does not know the orange’s beauty is not easily obtained? Thus has it been recorded through the ages, for the orange is indeed a marvel.\n\nSpeak of the orange grove, and it is like stars scattered to the ends of the earth; behold its fruit, and it is like pearls strung upon the treetops. Its skin is thin, its segments plump; its fragrance delicate, its taste sweet. Liu Yuxi likened it to the \"sweetness of *yu* and the coolness of *tuo* nectar\"—how much more its blossoms resemble dragon’s spittle, its leaves duck’s topknots, its clusters like wax, its frost like jade? Thus did the Perfected Lü compare the Golden Elixir to a pellet \"large as a pellet, its hue like the red orange.\"\n\nNow I comprehend the orange in full. In the southeastern realm, upon the mountains of Wuyi, within the Cavern of Mysterious Transformation, at the Abbey of Divine Protection, the Hermitage of Serene Integrity—there dwells a Daoist. Chen Hongfan, styled Tianxi, with the Daoist name Rizaozhai, has, beyond his love of the qin and books, an eccentric fondness for oranges. He is passionately devoted to orange groves and has planted many. Yet I suspect what he truly cherishes is not the orange itself, but rather the Perfected Lü’s metaphor for the Golden Elixir. Thus, within his hall, the wind and moon reign; throughout his grove, mist and rain linger. From dawn’s chant to dusk’s libation, he dwells in carefree ease—within, he cultivates his inner power; without, he delights in his surroundings. In haste or upheaval, he ever holds fast to that single golden pellet of the Elixir, his resolve unwavering. Is it any wonder he has chosen this seclusion? Compared to the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, he is by no means their inferior.\n\nHis dwelling is named \"Orange Hermitage.\" In broadening its meaning and illuminating its name, I do not err. Chen Tianxi’s bearing and demeanor are like autumn before the frost, like the first month of night, like the dawn-green of water, like the spring-blue of mountains. A single glimpse of his spirit is enough to evoke admiration. In his leisure, by the window’s lattice, his desk holds but a qin; he also tends to a sword—truly, it is the qin of Cangwu and the purple *xun*, the sword of Qingping and the red *jiang*. Often he burns tung resin to temper whale-glue, or binds rabbit’s fur to bamboo for brushes. For the most part, his gate is of pine, his walls bare; no vulgar visitor disturbs his solitude. Thus may he vie with the streams and mountains, the fish and birds, for tranquility; contend with the pines and bamboos, the mist and clouds, for purity of spirit and savor of life. This is why I so delight in Chen Tianxi’s intent.\n\nOne day, after playing his qin and singing a long ode, he raised his cup, then set it down, summoning Taohong and Maoying to beseech me for an essay—seeking to elucidate the meaning of \"Orange Hermitage.\" Of old, the immortal of Mount Wei had a poem: *\"Refining the Returned Elixir is bitter work— / I cannot bear to see sweet oranges.\"* The Old Man of Mount Qingcheng wrote: *\"How many times have I mistakenly swallowed an orange, / Only to long to ascend the clouded heavens.\"* Such were the ancients’ subtle allusions. Thus does Chen Tianxi’s concealment among oranges embody the intent of these two sages of Mount Wei and Mount Qingcheng.\n\nMoreover, as night deepens, the wind turns crisp, the moon bright; suddenly, a gibbon’s cry rings out, and a thousand groves awaken to dawn. In the pause between combing and washing, he cradles his qin by the orange grove’s edge—could there fail to be profound and wondrous meaning in this? At such a moment, I offer him a song:\n\n*\"The orange forms a grove, the orange forms a grove—\nAn acre of white clouds, hollow jade depths.\nWithin, an immortal elder cradles his qin—\nWho knows this heart of his?\"*\n\nThus may one glimpse the savor of \"Orange Hermitage.\"\n\nRecorded by the Daoist of Hainan, Bai Yuchan.\n\n---\n\nThe Master of the Elixir Crucible built his hut in the recesses of the fifth bend of Mount Wuyi. His door remained shut, his grains untouched. One day, a female Daoist arrived from Dongyang, recounting her quest for the Dao. He tested her with trials of tranquility, spoke to her of the world’s shallow morals, and described the hardships of dwelling in mountain valleys, the arduousness of cultivating the Dao, the toil of clearing brambles, the difficulty of securing provisions. After a long while, he said to her: *\"Coarse grains may be boiled into porridge; tattered robes may serve as rags. Flower buds may be eaten; kindling may be gathered for fire. All one needs is a patch of land to raise a thatched hut, weave orchids into a cloak, and strike flint for a fire. Let not the rain wet my head, nor the frost chill my skin. Before father and mother were born, what thought was there for cold or heat? After bones are reduced to ash, hunger can no longer be voiced. If life in the mountains is thus, then the Dao may indeed be attained.\"* Presently, the Dao was achieved, and phoenixes and cranes filled the sky in flight.\n\nThe master laughed and said: *\"Entering the Dao is as easy as a trapped ape fleeing to the forest; abandoning the Dao is as easy as a fish leaping onto the shore. The Dao resides in the heart—where the heart is, there is the Dao. If you can persist to the end, how fortunate I shall be!\"* Thereupon, he took her in as his disciple.\n\nThis Daoist was Liu Miaoqing. Some may doubt, for in her youth she was graceful and alluring, a sight to startle the heart and stir the eyes. Yet through the eye of the Dao, she was but a foul sack of festering pus, a vessel of bitterness and a bait for delusion. Thus, amid the red dust of the world, Miaoqing stood resolute, embodying the bearing of a steadfast hero. I believe her dreams of immortal wanderings and her spirit of Chan transformation enabled her to turn inward, to recognize her original face as her true destiny, and to somersault within the skull—like washing one’s face and finding the nose, requiring not the slightest effort.\n\nMiaoqing built several thatched huts beside the master’s abode and named the place *Thorn Concealment*, borrowing the line from He Xiangu: *\"In secluded mountain forests, thorns hide this body.\"* Amid green pines and emerald bamboo, she lived with carefree ease; the cries of cranes and gibbons echoed through the misty chill, while the spirit of wind and the soul of moonlight stretched boundless and free—such was the joy of *Thorn Concealment*.\n\nWhat, then, occupied her mind within this retreat? I say: in establishing such a refuge, she must have aspired to join the ranks of those who don cloud-scarves and crane-feather robes—serene as a dragon coiled in silence before thunder, composed as a gull in deep slumber, limpid as a spring sky without clouds, still as an autumn pool with its moon, leisurely as a fish darting through waterweeds, unburdened as a crow perched in reeds, crisp as the evening breeze through parasol trees, desolate as morning rain on plantain leaves, fleeting as a daydream now faded, dissolving as a chronic illness shed from the body, clear as a long-standing lawsuit resolved, remote as the twilight path through bamboo, distinct as night snow on a lone pine, unperturbed as an elder nearing old age, unformed as an infant yet unborn, tranquil as Penglai’s three isles upon the sea, vast as the boundless expanse of the Yangtze’s heart, hushed as the first light over a thousand groves, expansive as the fullness of spring in all things, cool as duckweed drifting on water, distant as a single leaf adrift in the void, swift as a sharp blade cleaving bamboo, weightless as a thread suspending a stone.\n\nIts subtlety defies description; its mechanism eludes comprehension—was this not the very purpose of *Thorn Concealment*?\n\nThus, if one seeks no use, one must place oneself in a realm of idle emptiness, allowing the self to merge with the streams and mountains, fish and birds, becoming a single mass of pure, ethereal qi. One must let the self be touched by the forests and springs, wind and moon, to acquire a trace of their wondrous, refined essence. Then, that person shall don the rainbow robes of Penglai and the feathered garments of the Weak Waters. Between Penglai and the Weak Waters, where birds never cease their flight and clouds and mist stretch endlessly, who but such a one could traverse a hundred or two hundred *li* in a single journey to reach that land?\n\nThe ancients compiled *Biographies of the Immortals* and *Biographies of Exemplary Women*—both records of heroic figures among women. Consider Zhang Daoling’s wife, who ascended in flight, and her daughter with her; Xu Jingyang’s wife, who ascended, and her daughter likewise; Ge Xianweng’s wife, who achieved liberation through the corpse, and her daughter as well; Liu Dongtian’s wife, who achieved liberation, and her daughter too. Those who refine the true and cultivate the primordial refine grain into essence, essence into blood, blood into marrow, marrow into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Dao, and this single-minded Dao into sagehood. Without inner cultivation and outer steadfastness, how could the women of old have achieved feathered transformation and ascension as they did?\n\nAmong the jade halls of the Heavenly Emperor stand immortal maidens: the celestial matrons of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the moon maidens of Guanghan, the cloud consorts of Penglai, the consorts who govern the peaks of the Great Cavern Heavens, the aged attendants who tend incense in the Miao Brahma Heaven—such as the Old Crone of Mount Li, the Xiao and Wang clans of Qingcheng, the Tong clan of the imperial house, the Ge clan of Huotong, the Hu, Li, and Yu clans of Wuyi, and He Xiangu among them. It is also told that in the Qin era there was Mao the Maiden, in the Han era Li the Maiden, and in the realms of Wu Mountain and Dongting Lake, divine maidens dwelled. Even Zhuangzi spoke of the maiden of Mount Miao Gu Ye in such form. Were such forms, such immortals, real or not? Many waver between doubt and belief. Yet the records of past and present, the accounts in ancient texts—surely female immortals exist.\n\nIf immortality can be learned, then why doubt that one may achieve the Dao? Once one reverses aging to return to infancy, one must be able to reverse yang and renew the bones; once one can preserve form and remain in the world, one must be able to transform and ascend in flight. With the heart of an immortal, believe in the affairs of immortals; study the Dao of immortals, and realize the fruits of immortality. Learning to be an immortal is not difficult—what is truly hard is transcending the dust and forsaking desire. Since the Dao of immortals, of long life and enduring vision, can be learned, then transcending the dust and forsaking desire—how could that be difficult?\n\nLiu Miaoqing, having devoted herself thus, must surely be within reach. If the girl who played the flute could ride the phoenix, if the girl who picked mulberry leaves could mount the crane, then I nod in approval of her resolve and take up my brush to write what can be said.\n\n**Three Quatrains Inscribed on the Wall of Thorn Concealment**\n\nMoss lies dead in green coins,\nThe pine, dead, grows thin in its shade.\n\n**From *The Upper Clarity Collection of the Ten

disdain.\nThen, in a flash, a pore of his heart opens:\nBreath and chaos drawn onto the silk.\n\nA white-haired, yellow-crowned adept flaunts his power,\nLifting Mount Wu-yi with a single hand.\nIn the Great Locust Palace, men crawl like ants—\nAwakening, he hears this and his heart leaps with joy.\n\nWith straw sandals and bamboo staff, a snap of the fingers,\nThirty-six peaks tumble to his

settles body and mind,\nMountains bloom on their own, birds sing of their own accord.\nHe has yet to see mulberry fields turn to sea,\nHow many times has the evening sun locked the level woods?\n\nLiving in this thatched hut, no other defense—\nAll day, he sits in stillness, absorbed and vacant.\nHe is no immortal of the Ten Isles or Three Mountains,\nNor any buddha of the Ten Directions or Three Times.\n\nJust a carefree, unburdened man,\nHis hut cradling a pot of spring.\nBefore the window, the moon’s thousand-year shadow;\nUpon his pillow, the clear wind’s ten-thousand-kalpa voice.\n\nWho is the master of this hut?\nFrom ancient times to now, he claims this land of leisure.\nSuddenly, he washes his face and feels his nose—\nNo eating, no drinking, no sleeping.\n\nThe hut stands empty, the man gone, mist curling,\nA white crane calls to the clouds, filling the azure sky.\nWith one glimpse of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s face,\nEverywhere a hut—everywhere the same.\n\nThis thatched hut, small and smaller still,\nIs but a pore in the vast emptiness.\nAt its peak, not a blade of thatch hangs—\nThe ten thousand forms array themselves as its constellations.\n\nThough kalpa-fire burns all to the last atom,\nThis hut remains unscathed, its dweller unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**For Zhao Daxu’s Painting of Bamboo and Stone**\n\nThe bamboo’s soul, the bamboo’s spirit,\nFallen to Xiao and Xiang, the Qi’s banks.\nA thousand stalks, ten thousand stalks vie in verdant splendor,\nDrinking wind, sipping dew for a thousand springs.\n\nThe master’s brush-tip moves like wind and rain,\nStartling the bamboo’s soul—nowhere to alight.\nA drop of ink transforms into a dragon,\nThe dragon’s offspring fly to E Creek to dwell.\n\nThe master wields his brush without hesitation,\nCreation dares not hoard spring for itself.\nNew shoots, sturdy joints, a forest of cold jade—\nWhere can phoenix and simurgh perch their dream-souls?\n\nThe Jin immortals like Sun Ju—\nTheir bamboo paintings often summoned heaven’s rain.\nThe Tang immortals like Zhang Zhen—\nTheir bamboo paintings often heard wild geese cry.\n\nThe master’s hand has entered the divine—\nOne stalk, two stalks spring from his wine.\nDrunk, he called for his ink-slave,\nOne stroke swept out a thousand *mu* of bamboo.\n\nHow could wine’s power usurp Creation’s work?\nThe master has refined his cinnabar elixir to crimson.\nA grain of yang-light illumines his lungs and viscera,\nThe ten thousand forms arrayed within his breast.\n\nSometimes he holds forth a leaf of wind-bamboo—\nThe Silver Sea grows warm, all tremble in awe.\nSometimes he holds forth a branch from the snow—\nAs if frozen jade scorns the rippling waves.\n\nHe can also moisten his brush to shape stone,\nNaturally steep and strange, ancient and rugged.\nTigers crouching in sand, rhinos in grass—\nHe bids men take them to Penglai to sell.\n\nBamboo’s purity, stone’s hardness—\nThrough these, he reveals true nature and life.\nLet men gaze upon stone and love bamboo,\nKnowing there is a true Zhao Yuanjing.\n\nWhen the master is drunk, he is often wind-mad,\nThe world’s eyes hold no immortals.\nI now treasure several of his paintings—\nWhen the cloud-crane comes, you will ascend to heaven.\n\n---\n\n**For a Painter of Fish**\n\nLong ago, the monk Xian painted fish,\nThirty-six scales clinging to emerald reeds.\nShen Xun’s paintings often featured fish,\nTheir fins flaring, manes waving—now captured in art.\n\nThe ancients’ wondrous paintings still endure,\nThe moderns’ marvels were unknown in ancient times.\nGuo Danqing stands peerless across the ages,\nThe world’s foremost painter of fish.\n\nAt the height of his skill, hand answers heart,\nHis mind’s craft surpasses cunning, his wit runs deep.\nOn the paper, a limpid stream flows,\nReleasing two or three iron bream.\n\nGolden scales, brocade manes, crimson jade topknots,\nThey circle and glide, playing in the waves.\nTiny fish, needle-like, swim in formation,\nLeaping to sip water, toying with duckweed.\n\nTossing heads, flicking tails in floating-sinking motion,\nNow clustering, now scattering in their leaps.\nHis brush divides light and dark, counting ten thousand scales,\nEtching whiskers, dotting eyes, evening the ink’s traces.\n\nAs if casting a ruler to measure rippling silk,\nOr threading a shuttle through water’s patterns.\nVividly, mandarin fish nest in green algae,\nThe fisherman has yet to cast his line—already he blows his fire.\n\nOn the wall, fish leap, yet the water does not flow,\nA child squints, tapping his needle-hook.\n\nAt the moment your brush reaches the realm of spirit,\nThis painting, once revealed, will resound even more.\nThough fish have no guts, they brim with living intent,\nJade waves steep the talisman, cold isles grow limpid.\n\nI fear that on some storm-lit night,\nThey may transform and soar as dragons through Yu’s Gate.\n\n**For Guo Chengwu’s Reed-Waisted Geese**\nAmong painters, Guo Xi stood supreme,\nAnd though he’s gone, his name remains unbroken.\nHis descendant, Guo Wanli, now appears,\nHis heart brimming with boundless ink and hues.\n\nFor whom did he craft this *Reeds and Wild Geese*?\nFor Yuwen Huan of the Southern Studio, its splendor unmatched.\nMisty waters, rustling reeds in the wind’s grasp,\nBy the sands, geese and crows call at dusk.\n\nThis is the autumn scene of Xiao Xiang and Dongting—\nWho in the world knows if such a painting exists?\nIllusion conjures three or four crows on a tower,\nEight or nine reeds stretch across ancient shoals.\n\nHesitant to roost, their cries ring clear,\nAs fishing boats moor by the shore, mountain mists darken.\nAutumn winds strip the wutong leaves to gold,\nMigrating geese return again to Hengyang.\n\nWriting characters across the void, none can decipher,\nTheir shadows glide past, sinking into the deep.\nEvening glow dips into the river, a village at dusk,\nA few wheel and circle back to ancient waves.\n\nNecks stretched, beaks raised, they peck at lotus blooms,\nThen soar beyond the western watchtower’s edge.\nCold clouds, pale moon—autumn at Xisai,\nA few plaintive cries stir melancholy.\n\nBy the bank, they fly with falling maple leaves,\nGathering in flocks to visit the sandpipers.\nSuch scenes, such sentiments—\nFor you, painting them is no difficult task.\n\nA few sheets of *Exi* silk, cold as ice and snow,\nYet in an instant, you sweep out a market of reeds and geese.\nThough many in the world study painting,\nFew can compare to your skill.\n\nI long to store these in a bamboo basket,\nWhere crisp autumn chill would fill its depths.\nBut I fear your paintings may go unseen—\nWho among those who hear of them would dare compete?\n\nHang them in a quiet chamber’s plain white walls,\nAnd one would gaze upon them a hundred times a day.\n\n**Pure Void Hall’s Ode to Snow**\nThe vast sky darkens, day turns to night,\nFierce winds tear clouds into shreds below.\nCold gibbons cling to trees, too afraid to cry,\nPlum blossoms shy from blooming, fearing frost’s swift blow.\n\nCountless mountains drown in fallen leaves’ sorrow,\nEverywhere, frozen mist clings to thatched eaves.\nWithered and stiff, life seems beyond revival,\nAs if the Spring Decree were barred by Feilian’s might.\n\nHungry tigers call their cubs to rocky dens,\nBirds dart like shuttles through the leafless grove.\nGardens and groves stand desolate, stripped bare,\nAfter nights of frost’s relentless, wanton force.\n\nThreatening rain, yet only sleet descends,\nThe sky’s deceit weighs heavy in the air.\nWillow fluff takes flight like a chariot’s wheels,\nFrozen for days, refusing to melt away.\n\nBefore my eyes, a jade-white tower appears,\nYet I dare not ascend, left only to sigh.\nGoosebumps rise, my nose runs cold,\nWhile in the village, fresh wine’s price soars high.\n\nBy the stream, fishermen laugh as they haul their nets,\nUnknowing that the hooks bear musk’s scent.\nThey wash the pot, stoke the fire, brew snow tea,\nLower the blinds, cross their legs, and speak of purity.\n\nThey call a boy to shatter the inkstone’s ice,\nWarm their hands, form a circle, and found a poetry club.\nThe poem captures this scene—yet still it falls short,\nHow I wish Wang Wei could paint it true!\n\n**Pure Yang Assembly**\nA breath of warm wind dances through green locusts,\nZhurong’s fire rolls in from the south.\nCrabapples scatter, bees and butterflies depart,\nThe pondside pavilion stands empty, lotuses yet unopened.\n\nA single handful of pure harmony’s essence,\nThe pure Yang has already turned to mare’s form.\nThe mountains and rivers gather this heroic qi,\nSealing it suddenly in a gourd.\n\nBefore the steps, fourteen pods of *jiaomu* grow,\nThe censor dreams of qilin at night.\nThe old immortal, robed in carelessness, laughs from his nose,\nHis celestial spring yet unborn in the womb.\n\nLü Dongbin’s cleverness turns to clumsiness,\nOn Penglai’s path, only the bright moon remains.\nPlum blossoms cling to the wall, wax drips from branches,\nBy the pond, pomegranate flowers bleed within their leaves.\n\nBorn with an unyielding spirit,\nHis nature and passions exhaust the heavens’ truth.\nSuddenly, he grasps the mechanism of lead and mercury,\nDaring to say the great Dao knows no Chu or Qin.\n\nIn an instant, the golden elixir completes nine cycles,\nThe ten-month gestation ripens—yet none inquire.\nIt shakes heaven and earth, startles ghosts and gods,\nOnly the blue clouds and white cranes find solace.\n\nLater ages long for the true man,\nEver celebrating his birth.\nOn the day the cherry kitchens open,\nEven Buddhists wish to craft wax figures.\n\nWho first began this custom?\nTruly, it began in Qiaoling during the Five Dynasties.\nWang Shen held gatherings, donning the scholar’s cap,\nWhite cranes flew in, uncounted.\n\nNext, the Xiao family built their immortal abode,\nIn the Seven Min lands, ten thousand households birthed auspicious mist.\nOne prefecture, then two, gradually embraced the custom,\nSwiftly they came to know Dongbin’s worth.\n\nHow many times did they traverse the city’s north and south?\nYet none knew the old man had returned.\nThey only saw an ancient pine speak in human tongue,\nAsking, \"To whose house does the master carry his ink?\"\n\nWithin Taiping Temple, he composed a poem,\nThen scoffed at those who polished mirrors, calling them fools.\nIn Yueyang’s marketplace, he let out a long whistle,\nThe iron flute fell silent—how long has it been?\n\nThere was a man, a son of the Pan family,\nContent with his lot, his heart filled with joy.\nFrom his extravagant years of devotion to this day,\nPilgrims from the four seas swarm like ants.\n\nAmid the throng, a jade toad appears,\nUnashamed of tattered robes or humble garb.\nHe inscribed a poem to urge steadfastness like metal and stone,\nMorning incense and evening candles heighten reverence.\n\nThe wondrous Elder Miaotong clapped in secret,\nWondering when he might dream of such radiance.\nWaiting for him to rise like Yi, towering and bold,\nHe would arrange the robes and alms bowl—blessings boundless.\n\nFive hundred white cranes call to the blue clouds,\nIn their depths, jade plums bloom anew.\nIf one asks of the matter of ascending to immortality,\nSimply gaze upon the sun and moon at heaven’s edge.\n\n**For Xie Zhitang of the Western City**\nOn Penglai’s peak, a divine immortal,\nHis Daoist bearing tall and straight as a pine.\nEyes gleaming, blacker than lacquer,\nCheeks faintly flushed like peach blossoms.\n\nAt times, he throws back his head and laughs,\nGathering Kunlun in his right hand.\nSuddenly, he tumbles from the empty void,\nUnknowing that his belly holds the stars.\n\nAt times, he startles an old dragon into roaring,\nIn one breath, he drains the Canglang’s waves.\nShattering the primordial chaos, he extracts its bones,\nPlucking a mustard seed to contain mountains and rivers.\n\nIn the crescent moon’s furnace, he boils heaven and earth,\nRefining the sun’s soul and the moon’s marrow.\nLaughing, he wields his gourd to bind ghosts and gods,\nHis staff hoisting mountains and waters alike.\n\n**For Le Ba and Others**\n\nLe Ba’s rice grains take flight as bees,\nZuo Ci’s mugwort shears transform to dragons.\nIn summer, plum blossoms; in winter, lightning—\nSuch feats make even Lü and Zhong ask questions.\n\nScooping earth for incense is but illusion,\nWhile qilin from the water’s depths serve as delicacies.\nGhosts and gods’ eyes bulge in astonishment,\nBeneath the rootless tree, he rides an iron horse.\n\nWhen skill reaches its peak, play becomes profound,\nTossing and shaping creation like a child at play.\nSomersaulting on the tiger’s tongue,\nHe laughs at Vajra learning to paint eyebrows.\n\nNüwa seeks to mend the western heavens’ flaw,\nYet her smelted stones fail to amuse Fuxi.\nQin Shi Huang carved mountains to link the four seas,\nThe Han Emperor’s grasp elicits but a long laugh.\n\nThe master wields his bottomless basket,\nMoving from being to non-being with ease.\nClutching this Dao-guard, he surveys the four seas—\nDongbin now seeks a fellow practitioner.\n\nIn cups, cotton swells and scatters,\nFish swim in fire, while water holds obstructions.\nAt Yellow Crane Tower, deep in drunkenness,\nHe widens his eyes to show Zhongli.\n\nStirring a basin to scatter five-colored sands,\nHe writes dragons and serpents across the earth.\nWith a single cup left as parting wine,\nDare he transform it to tea before others’ eyes?\n\nBehind the bamboo fence lies a single path,\nPiercing the azure clouds beyond.\nAt the crossroads, he spreads his mat,\nWith a flip of his hand, clouds and rain arise.\n\nNowadays, none in the world can match him,\nFor his Dao-guardian’s skill is truly divine.\nHow many springs has he wandered rivers and lakes,\nBecoming one with the cloud-and-water life?\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Month Reflections**\n\nOn Fangying Mountain, the wind howls,\nWhere the fifth and sixth months feel like autumn.\nPine blossoms fall as cranes take flight,\nEndless white clouds drift over emerald peaks.\n\nMidnight’s toad descends into the cinnabar well,\nJade forests locked in twilight’s cold mist.\nDew blankets the sky, dotting the moss,\nFrog markets disperse, and all sounds fade.\n\nThree or two trees where gibbons cry,\nTheir branches home to sleepless birds.\nA few fireflies linger on sandy paths,\nWhile mountain streams weep with cold springs.\n\nThe bell’s toll severs the path to dreams,\nUnknowing where butterflies now flutter.\nRubbing my eyes, I fold paper streamers—\nToday is the fifth day of the fifth month.\n\nMorning rain clears, plums grow plump,\nYoung dragons shed their shells as new phoenixes soar.\nMy mountain dwelling holds nothing,\nYet ginger and wheat suffice for the morning meal.\n\nI recall the fourth day of the fifth month in years past,\nWearing a kudzu hat and feather fan at Luán Creek’s market.\nDragon boats split the waves with a thousand oars,\nDrums shook the heavens as banners cleaved the water.\n\nPaper money flew at Qu Yuan’s shrine,\nCrowds moved like swarming ants.\nPaulownia blossoms adorned temples, colored threads bound arms,\nEvery household warded off plague with peach branches.\n\nBefore the hall, green mugwort shaped green tigers,\nFinely chopped calamus steeped in green vinegar.\nSucculent goose and carp graced the feast,\nGlutinous rice wrapped in leaves, steeped in water.\n\nThis year, solitude in these empty mountains,\nWhere mountain rain and wind bring morning chill.\nMòān bids me cease sighing,\nSo I write this poem to express my mountain life.\n\nOh, to grow wings beneath my arms,\nAnd fly with you to the boundless void,\nSpared the bitterness of this world’s sorrows!\n\n---\n\n**Journey to Immortal Rock**\n\nDrunk, he seizes a seven-foot frost-bitten bamboo,\nBefore Cloud-Brocade Mountain’s winding bays.\nAutumn rain at the stream’s head deepens the chill green,\nA jade pot where dragons play.\n\nDream-flowers along the brocade shore, red as flowing blood,\nRice fields rise and fall like a game of *sai*.\nEmerald cliffs soar halfway to the azure sky,\nBirds dare not fly, tucking their feet in fear.\n\nAn ancient grotto, empty, with stone wine presses,\nSheer cliffs house immortal granaries, heaped with celestial grain.\nThe old pine’s gesture still draws gasps,\nAs gods and ghosts carve paths through valleys.\n\nThe sound of pounding medicine dries the air—man already ascended,\nA ten-thousand-foot cinnabar well, a single spring’s gleam.\nWind strikes ancient pines, their jade canopies soar,\nSunlight forges green coins on moss.\n\nVines and creepers drag trees through wispy mist,\nSince the yellow crane’s departure, how many years have passed?\nThe sky leans toward dusk, cicadas cry in vain,\nThe mountain moon turns full toward man at night.\n\nA desolate temple’s old halls hold a few oaks,\nA lone monk gone, the brushwood gate left ajar.\nIron statues face the wall, silent and still,\nBefore the ancient hall, a cold brazier stands.\n\nCrows alight on the eaves, dripping water,\nEvening clouds and withered grass make the mountains seem gaunt.\nThe quilt is thin, warmth flees, sleep eludes,\nTiger roars and gibbon cries fill the ear.\n\nA few sparse stars fall on the parasol tree,\nCinnabar peaks and purple ravines vie in height.\n\n---\n\n**Journey to Yan Rock**\n\nWhen shall I wander carefree on a green ox,\nDawn’s dew glistening at White Jade Tower?\nA guest arrives from Tianzhu Peak,\nCatching a single pole’s wind at the ferry.\n\nAutumn wind lends strength to the journey,\nBlowing into Wu Rock’s pines and bamboos.\nPines and bamboos mourn, the sky turns autumn,\nFloating empty, coming and going in the void.\n\nTowering cliffs rise ten thousand feet into the azure,\nThe immortal master rides a crane, leaving no trace.\nThe alchemical furnace cold, grasses overgrown,\nA few rock huts shrouded in cold mist.\n\nBelow lies a dragon pool, fathomless green,\nA thousand-foot waterfall hangs from the cliff.\nNight’s moon casts shadows across the mountain,\nA stone bell’s chime stirs autumn’s chill.\n\nWang Wu danced here in years past,\nTransforming into rain that filled the sky.\nThey say this rock teems with immortals,\nA white crane’s touch turning the mountain green.\n\nMist veils the mountain, stones always damp,\nMoss carpets the earth, endless emerald.\nOne day, I’ll refine elixirs here,\nSeizing a thousand years of leisure from the mortal world.\n\nA lofty man, Master Lu Rock,\nHolds his zither, playing *Zhong Lü* for me.\nHe urges me to return in years to come,\nLest this rock be buried in mist and clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Fragrant Brocade Pavilion of Hu Dongyuan**\n\nThe Eastern Emperor splits open Goumang’s belly,\nRevealing a brocade heart, embroidered guts, and fragrant richness.\nFor a hundred springs, the crimson capital’s winds and rains held sway,\nThe flower’s spirit, masterless, yet full of vigor.\n\nThe oriole’s first call opens the willow’s eyes,\nOn crabapple branches, spring mist lingers.\nA few red dots emerge,\nThe wall’s red-cheeked breeze smiles faintly.\n\nAfter Dongyuan’s departure, the flowers lost their master,\nEven Spring’s labor grew lazy at the loom.\nSuddenly, a poet-immortal appears before the pavilion,\nAnd the flowers exhale dragon’s spittle.\n\nWind urges, rain drills, yet the flowers remain indistinct,\nThe courtyard blooms with fragrant splendor.\nPeonies breathe fire, flowers ablaze,\nThe sun spreads brocade upon the mossy felt.\n\n**Poetic Madness and Dream-Drinking with the Flower Spirit**\n\nDrunk with poetry, I dreamt of drinking with the Flower Spirit;\nWine-sodden, I would not sleep with the Flower Spirit.\nAs the wine ebbed, I recalled Dongyuan—\nThough the flowers and trees remain, my heart aches for the man.\nThis poem was never meant for flowers,\nYet I grieve for Dongyuan in these hills and vales.\nNow, when I admire flowers, I see no one—\nOnly bees and butterflies flitting through the idle pavilion.\n\n*Perfect Realization: The Upper Clarity Collection, Scroll Thirty-Eight Concludes*\n*Perfect Realization: The Upper Clarity Collection, Scroll Thirty-Nine*\n*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\n**Two Songs of Cloud-Wandering**\n\nCloud-wandering is hard, oh so hard,\nTen thousand miles of misty waters, the four seas so wide.\nSpeak of such bitterness, and who would not weep?\nFirst parting from home, leaving kin behind,\nThree hundred coins jingling at my waist.\nI pondered, sought, and found the Way so arduous—\nTonight, where shall I rest my head?\n\nUnknowing, I walked two or three stages,\nAnd was told this place was Zhangcheng.\nMy robes sold off, my clothes all pawned,\nYet not a soul did I meet upon the road.\nArriving at a riverside village, I lodged in a lonely inn—\nCrows cawed, flowers fell, a thousand groves at dusk.\nAt dawn, I rose again to walk the road,\nWith naught but a single umbrella in hand.\n\nGradually, I drew near to Xinghua Prefecture,\nWhere wind and rain whispered of spring’s departure.\nAll I had left was this bare, emaciated frame,\nAnd a few coins still tucked in my pouch.\nMy steps grew heavy, my feet weak,\nMy body wracked with itching, lice crawling everywhere.\nStripped bare, I stood at last,\nLonging to return home—yet home was beyond reach.\nHow could I endure ten days of gnawing hunger?\nHiding my name, concealing my face—who would know me?\n\nI came to Xingfu Temple in Luoyuan,\nAnd there became a servant.\nNot half a month had passed before I parted ways with the abbot.\nFire-clouds soared above Zhiti Peak,\nThe road’s stones scorching like embers.\nThe blazing sun seared the sky,\nAnd my bare feet could not bear the burning path.\nA mound of flesh, sweat streaming down—\nNot even a fan to stir the wind.\n\nFortunately, the triple heat of summer passed,\nAnd my steps led me once more to Jianpu.\nTruly, I was poor to the bone, to the marrow—\nA night in the wilds, rain pattering on the parasol trees.\nAt dusk, I looked around, tears streaming,\nNo hat, no raincoat—how could I not despair?\nI huddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,\nBut the village elder would not let me stay.\n\nHearing that the people of Jianning were kind,\nI came seeking food and clothing.\nYet all I heard were whispers of shame—\nWho would meet me with eyes of mercy?\nI recalled my days of wealth and ease,\nAnd now, head bowed, I knit my brows in sorrow.\nHouse after house, I stretched out my hand—\nNot one soul pitied this beggar.\n\nFrom Fujian, I made my way to Longhu,\nTo the Upper Clarity Palace, to seek an audience with the master.\nBefore we met, I begged for shelter,\nBut the temple keeper scorned my tattered robes.\nIt was just like my first arrival at Wuyi,\nWhere the yellow-capped Daoists berated me.\nA bowl of stale rice, a ladle of cold water—\nThey called me a wretch, a disgrace to their kind.\n\nEast and west of the river, north and south of the lake,\nZhejiang’s borders touching the western reaches of Shu,\nGuangdong, Fujian, Huai, and the seas—tens of thousands of miles,\nA thousand mountains, ten thousand waters, all in vain.\nYears passed in cloud-wandering,\nAnd my fellow Daoists laughed at my folly.\nI revisited old haunts, came and went again—\nGreat matters slip by, yet I do not blame Heaven.\n\nIf I truly have the destiny of an immortal,\nThere must be someone to guide me.\nNow, my training has reached its peak,\nAnd not a trace of vexation lingers in my breast.\n\nI remember the flames of war rising in Huaixi,\nFrozen corpses stretching for miles.\nFortune granted me a thread of life,\nYet hunger and thirst brought me to the brink of despair.\nI remember the snow in Wulin,\nMy clothes in tatters, the wind piercing my bones.\nThough my essence and qi remained whole,\nStill, my skin split from the cold.\n\nI recall an ancient temple in wind and rain,\nNo fire in the incense burner, paper money scattering in the gale.\nGhosts wailed, spirits howled, the sky grew grim,\nDew dripped, clouds thinned, and apes cried through the night.\nI think of straw sandals on frost-hardened ground,\nMoonlight on green moss, fallen leaves turning yellow.\nNot a moment of true ease—\nHow could I endure such bitter cold?\n\nThen, one day, Heaven opened its eyes,\nAnd Master Chen Niyuan saw my laziness.\nOn the Mid-Autumn of the *guiyou* year, beneath a clear sky,\nI sat alone in the pine’s shade, speaking of this and that.\nIt turned out the true gold was at home all along—\nMy past toil had been in vain.\nI recalled the *Long Life, Preserve the Life-Spark* formula,\nAnd built a thatched hut to sit in stillness amid the deep clouds.\n\nRefining the golden elixir is easy—\nWhether in the mountains or the marketplace.\nI write these *Songs of Cloud-Wandering* in passing,\nLest others fail to grasp their meaning.\n\n**Again**\n\nI recall a night of rain on Dongting,\nNo raincoat, no hat—\nHuddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,\nBut the village elder would not let me stay.\n\nI recall seven days of snow in Wulin,\nMy clothes torn and tattered—\nHad I not been Bai Yuchan,\nHe would have frozen till his skin split and blood flowed,\nFor the cold pierced to the bone.\n\nI recall the summer heat east of the river,\nThe road’s stones burning like fire—\nWhere could I rest?\nNo fan to stir the wind,\nBarefoot, I could not bear the path.\n\nI recall an autumn moonlit night on Qingcheng,\nAlone beneath the pines,\nA *bu xu* hymn sung—\nMouth and heart conversing,\nCold mist veiling all, the world hushed.\nOnly then did I truly arrive at the mountain.\n\nI recall a gentle breeze on Xiaoxiang,\nTurning my *Huaxu* dream,\nThe sun crimson at the mountain’s edge,\nA crow’s cry—\nThe cry faded, leaving no trace,\nSuch fleeting joy—with whom could I share it?\n\nI recall the troops rising in Huaixi,\nRows of bleached bones stretching for miles,\nHungry, yet no food,\nThirsty, yet no water.\n\nI recall a year in a village,\nPlague raging,\nPeople came begging for talismanic water,\nYet I had nowhere to turn.\nThe divine generals manifested,\nSeizing ghosts and spirits at will.\n\nI recall walking beneath the northern mountains,\nAncient graves overgrown with autumn grass,\nPaper money still damp from the rain,\nWhite poplars sighing in the wind,\nA desolate terrace bathed in moonlight,\nGhosts and spirits weeping all night—\nSaved only by a scroll of scripture to deliver the dead.\n\nAgain I recall—\nwhere outstretched hands met the thoroughfare,\na thousand households cried *\"Ashamed!\"*,\nten thousand households muttered *\"Karma!\"*.\nLeaning on doorways, eyes fixed on noses,\nthey repeated, *\"Just pass by, just pass by.\"*\nFaces full of scornful smiles,\nshouting curses to drive me away.\n\nAgain I recall—\nentering halls to seek shelter,\nthey scorned my ragged robes.\nThe head monk and the abbot,\nthe senior monk said I was unfit.\nAfter barely two days of inquiry,\nI wandered the streets in circles,\nthen reentered the almshouse,\nmingling with beggars in the mix.\n\nAgain I recall—\nyears lying in frost-covered weeds,\nnights under bright moonlight, collapsing alone,\ndays of ceaseless rain,\nsitting solitary in an ancient temple.\nEnduring all cold, suppressing all hunger,\nyet glimpsing neither a trace of *Chan*\nnor a hint of the *Dao*.\n\nHow virtuous was Master Cuixu!\nAt first sight, he took pity on me,\nspeaking a single word that struck like a needle to the pain,\nteaching me to practice for but a moment—\nchilled to the bone, my heart’s flower\ncongealed into a single crimson grain.\nHe said, *\"This alone is the Golden Elixir.\nTen thousand sutras are but idle chatter.\nA thousand, ten thousand *Dao*s may be tamed,\nbut who knows the True Eternal Way?\nNo need for convoluted schemes,\nno need for secret signals.\"*\n\nIt is difficult—\nlike an eighty-year-old gnawing an iron plate.\nIt is easy—\nlike a single stroke of a sharp bamboo knife.\n\nHe asked me,\n*\"How many springs have you wandered, cloud-like?\nDisheveled, barefoot, filthy—\nwho would recognize you?\"*\n\n**Song of Joy**\nJoy, joy—true joy!\nAll at once, I cast it all away.\nWith hands unbound, I sing a mighty song and return—\nginger and pepper are indeed spicy!\nNow, joy is great joy,\nsometimes wild, sometimes unruly.\n\nWithin this body, I have my own spouse—\ntell this to others, and they’ll surely laugh.\nOnce, joy was but small joy,\nlike uprooting a shadowy tree, root and all.\nA man truly capable of conceiving,\nmother and child in one form, vividly alive.\n\nJoy, joy—true joy!\nThe vast emptiness shattered like an autumn hair’s tip.\nCountless lives of birth and death overturned—\nonly this great death brings true life.\nThe old rut of existence, now utterly cast off.\nOnly now do I see—\n*\"Father was only ever father,\"*\nbewildered, entangled in my own roots.\n\nRecently, I’ve sorted the tangled threads,\nseven times seven, back to forty-eight.\nLike a dragon nurturing its pearl, never forgetting,\nlike a hen brooding her eggs, breath unbroken,\nlike a cicada sipping the dawn wind,\nlike an old clam holding the autumn moon.\n\nA carefree man between heaven and earth,\na great laugh shakes the vast expanse.\nClothing: one robe for all four seasons.\nFood: one bowl from a thousand homes.\nIn a three-house village, I play the madman,\non a ten-house street, I cause a stir.\nOne husband, one wife, with six children—\nwhether walking or sitting, ever steadfast.\n\nGather and release, move freely as you will—\nthis is the Buddha of the ten directions and three times.\nOne cup of wine, then another,\none song, then another.\nAt midday, three clear meals,\nafter eating, a sound sleep.\nLaying down the ten thousand greens, all cast away—\nonly when freed and at ease is there true joy.\n\nExhausting all cleverness to learn foolishness,\nin this moment, the scene transforms, ascending the morning’s secret.\nOrdinary people don’t understand flipping somersaults—\nlike eating salt when hungry, only increasing thirst.\n\nBy chance, I roamed to Mount Lu,\nmy body amid the white duckweed and red dreams.\nAscending the Pavilion of Heavenly Music,\nthe yellow crane had not returned—spring rain was cold.\nHow many in this world feel the heart’s bitterness,\nnot refining the Golden Liquid, the Great Return Elixir?\n\nForgetting form to nurture *qi* is the Golden Liquid,\nfacing scenes with a heart devoid of intent is the Great Return.\nForgetting form, transforming *qi*; *qi* transforming spirit—\nthis is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.\nThe Crimson Palace, a blazing crescent furnace,\nthe Spirit Terrace, a silent altar of the Great Mystery.\n\nCinnabar is the blood of the red phoenix,\nquicksilver is the liver of the black tortoise.\nGolden lead gathered into the earthen crucible,\nwooden mercury flying to dwell in the *niwan*.\nThe Flower Pool lies within the Sea of *Qi*,\nthe Spirit Chamber within the Yellow Court.\n\nScattered, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are busy;\ngathered, the meridians and protective *qi* are at ease.\nThe five viscera and six bowels each have their spirits—\nten thousand spirits pay homage to the One Spirit.\nThis One Spirit is the Primal Essence,\npre- and post-heavenly *Qian*’s prosperity.\n\nThe sage gathers this as medicinal material—\ngathered, it exists; scattered, it vanishes.\nDay and night, the River Chariot never pauses,\nsilently aligning with the Great Creation’s movement.\nEvery person inherently possesses a drop of gold,\ngold essence and wood liquid, each half a catty.\n\nThe twenty-eight constellations return to one furnace,\none water, one fire—must be harmonized.\nOne phase hard, one phase soft,\none line firm, one line yielding.\nThe heart’s sky determines the seasons,\nthe nature’s earth divides the lands like Chu and Qin.\n\nIn a day, eighty-four thousand miles,\nnaturally, the Dipper’s handle revolves the heavens.\nWhen a person sheds their shell beyond yin and yang,\none must refine mercury into silver.\nOnly when the Yellow Woman arrives at the Purple Court\ndo the golden male and radiant female unite in marriage.\n\nGreen Dragon and White Tiger encircle the golden tripod,\nthe yellow sprout—a branch of spring at midnight.\nAt the bend of the Nine-Curved River, white snow flies,\nat Kunlun’s peak, purple clouds soar.\nDing Gong silently guards the jade furnace,\nin union and nurturing, the fetal infant forms.\n\nDivine water extinguishes the Three Corpses’ fire,\nthe wisdom sword sweeps away the Six Bandits’ troops.\nFrom nothing, one arises—a grain of elixir,\nwithin the dung pellet, the transformed maiden’s form.\nTruly, once attained, it is forever attained—\nin but a moment, it can be congealed.\n\nSuddenly, the four great elements birth emptiness,\nunaware, the One Spirit ascends the Great Clarity.\nEven if skillfully merging mercury with lead,\nwithout knowing the fire’s timing, it is futile.\nIt largely depends on the Zhou Tian fire—\nonly after ten months does the sacred embryo begin to round.\n\nThough the elixir’s head may form, it will dissipate—\nfire’s timing must solidify it.\nMovement and stillness, life and death—bathe appropriately,\nfortune and misfortune, advance and retreat—value withdrawal and addition.\nAfter nine cycles of gentle fire,\nthe medicinal substances can form the fetal immortal.\n\nOne hour and eight quarters make one celestial cycle,\ntwelve hours correspond to one year.\nFrom each yang union after,\nrefine the work until the six pure *Qian*s.\n\nThe spirit’s ebb and flow mark the tides’ timing,\nqi and blood wax and wane like the moon’s soul.\nA single hub ever holds thirty spokes—\nthe mystery lies in the waxing and waning crescents.\n\nRefining qi to softness is the highest benevolence,\nritual, justice, wisdom, and trust fuse into *ren*.\nWhen true earth returns to its place, it is most authentic,\nwater, fire, metal, and wood all merge in perfect wholeness—\nessence-water, spirit-fire, and intent-earth.\n\nRefine to return hun and po to their root,\nthe primordial qi now abides eternally,\nscattered through the ten thousand things and the human body,\nflowers bloom in spring winds, birds sing of their own accord.\nWho knows the Creator’s heaven as spring?\nThe common folk use it daily yet remain unaware.\n\nQi enters the four limbs, but in vain they wither,\npine and bamboo, hollow-hearted, receive qi in full,\ndefying frost and snow to stay verdant through the years.\nHow much more so the human primordial spirit, which never dies?\nThis qi is the yellow sprout and lead,\nold pines may rejuvenate, the sick may heal,\nthe scattered may gather, the brief may extend.\n\nThe heart enters emptiness to enact the fire’s timing,\ninner visions, inner images—a heaven within the flask.\nKnow that each mote of dust is Penglai,\neach drifting leaf is a transcendent’s boat.\nSpirit is fire, qi is the medicine,\nthe heart is the furnace, the body the field—\nself-cultivating, self-planting, self-refining,\neach day a grain like millet.\n\nOnce lingzhi sprouts, sweet dew descends,\ntortoise and snake coil through the ages.\nOne morning, thunder shakes the mountains and rivers,\none spark becomes the sun, ten thousand turn to smoke.\nWithin the sun flies the golden crow,\neach night at midnight, one enters the Moon’s vast cold.\nChildren and grandchildren, hundreds of millions—\nin the crucible, even chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.\n\nThe Great Dao passed through thirty-two transmissions,\nreaching Tiantai’s Zhang Wuzhen,\nfour transmissions later, to Bai Yuchan.\nWith eyes empty of the four seas, he sighed at the lack of true seekers,\nuntil he chanced upon Taiping Xingguo Palace,\nwhere an aged Daoist, surnamed Chen,\nhad spent half his life vowing to master lead and mercury,\ntraversing ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains in vain,\nuntil one day, beneath Mount Lu, he met his fate—\nlaughing, he brushed the dust of the mortal world from his sleeves.\n\nOn a jade-green bed, through wind and rain at night,\nthe method of the elixir was imparted, restoring his origin.\nWhat is a human life but a cup of wine?\nWhat is a human life but a flickering lamp?\nWhere lie Penglai and Fangzhang?\nI long to return on white clouds with a crane’s grace.\nJoy! Joy! True joy!\nFor you, I speak these final words—\nthe very last phrase is personally entrusted,\nto reveal clearly the path to Penglai\nfor all under heaven who seek immortality.\n\n---\n\nThough the patched sleeve is torn, it can be mended,\nfor within the body lies the treasure of longevity.\nWhy lean on a staff of tangled vines?\nWhy wear sandals woven from field herbs?\n\nNow raving, now still,\nnow standing erect, now lying supine—\npeople call me mad,\nbut I am not mad—who truly knows me?\n\nIn heat, I drink only the snow of Hua Pond,\nin cold, I turn to the fire within the elixir.\nWhen hungry, I crave the black dragon’s liver,\nwhen thirsty, I long to sip the green dragon’s brain.\n\nThe Crimson Palace blooms with peonies,\nthe Spirit Terrace sprouts fresh mugwort.\nYet I laugh at Yan Hui for dying young,\nand Peng Keng for not being truly old.\n\nA cup of central-yellow wine tastes sweeter,\na thousand verses of inner visions are finer still.\nThe stringless zither needs no strumming,\nthe song of non-being finds no chorus.\n\nMorning and night, I strike at delusion,\nyet not a trace of idle vexation remains.\nCorpse-liberation and ascension are but trifles,\ndeath and life, life and death—nothing is forbidden.\n\nI eat when others offer food,\nno need to raise silkworms or plant rice.\nFrost and snow are not true cold,\nhunger at dawn and dusk can be endured.\n\nI imagine heaven has immortal offices,\nbut on earth, I disdain the title of Perfected One.\nThe golden tiger’s cap is my lead brother,\nthe dragon-riding maiden is my mercury sister.\nWithin the Niwan Palace dwells the Yellow Dame,\nwho cradles the infant in her embrace.\n\nThe Pass of Spirit, the Black Pass, the Heart’s Pass—\nall three gates are traversed as one.\nThe Six Bandits burn like raging fire,\nthe Three Corpses swell with gall like the heavens—\nyet without wielding weapons, in an instant,\nthe Diamond Guardians are shattered and searched,\nbound to the furnace’s edge,\ncrushed to dust, ground to fragments.\n\nNow, at last, I delight in a single red grain,\nas if Ding Gong had wed the old crone.\nHad I not once doubted Master Cui Xu,\nhow could I now break free from the locks of the pass?\n\nPluck the tender shoots when young,\nrefine them with fierce fire into purple polish.\nI reflect: had I begun earlier, it would still have been too late—\nMaster Cui Xu is now hard to find,\nand I no longer see Zhang Ping Shu,\nso I might as well revile the *Awakening to Reality*.\nHow could I have known the ancient sages’ hearts?\nTheir compassion instead invited calamity for descendants.\n\nIf mortals wish to refine the golden elixir,\nseek the medicinal herbs within the body.\nProceed slowly over ten months,\nfearing only that none will teach the fire’s timing.\nKnow only advance and retreat, withdrawal and addition—\nseven returns and nine reversions all stem from impatience.\n\nFish and birds in streams and mountains grow weary of carefree wandering,\nwind and moon in forests and springs fuel my laughter and pride.\nWith unkempt hair and soiled robes, I roam the world,\nafter three thousand merits fulfilled, I return to Peng Isle.\nSometimes in the marketplace, sometimes in the mountains,\nsometimes laughing uproariously, sometimes collapsing in mirth.\n\nClouds fill a thousand peaks—where to seek me?\nI am in the city’s dust, yet who knows me?\n\n---\n\nIn the end, I sing:\nI never believed in immortals,\nnor knew of the Great Brahma Heaven.\nHow could I bear to hear others speak of Penglai?\nI cover my face and laugh at their madness.\n\nThe seven-return elixir is often false,\nand people say its tales are mere fiction.\nThe world claims immortals can ascend,\nthat they live forever, defying death.\nBut flesh has no wings—how could it not fall?\nNo one lives a century—how could life extend?\nWith my own eyes, I see birth and death together,\nlife and death cycling endlessly.\n\nMaster Cui Xu told me:\nhis insights were not like this.\nFearing others’ roots are shallow, their allotments meager,\nthey lack the lifespan to return to the Yellow Springs.\n\nThe human body holds only three things—\nessence, qi, and spirit—preserve them all.\nThis essence is not the essence of intercourse,\nbut the saliva from the Jade Emperor’s mouth.\nThis qi is not the qi of breath,\nbut the mist of primordial simplicity.\nThis spirit is not the spirit of thought,\nbut one that stands shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial Beginning.\n\nHearing his words, I trembled—\ntrembling, doubting, clenching my fists.\nI knew only to ask about daily movements,\nhow one thing dwells with us in constant unity.\n\nThis thing’s root and stem are essence and qi,\nessence and qi that may fill the body.\nYet how could I know this essence, this spirit, this qi\noriginated before father and mother conceived me?\nThe three never once parted,\nknotted into one boundless mass.\n\nMan’s birth and death are but empty illusion—\nthis thing remains serene, untouched.\nI turned inward to ponder,\nand the elder’s words rang true.\nThis must be the beloved practice he revealed,\nhis discourse unfolding its meaning.\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night of Kai Xi’s first year,\nincense burned, I knelt to receive the oral transmission.\nAfter three days of practice,\nheaven and earth, sun and moon softened like silk.\nSuddenly, I bit through empty space and shattered it—\nonly then did I grasp that Zhong and Lü had plumbed the mystery.\n\nHad I devoted myself in youth,\nI would not still be mired in dust.\nI think of the eight hundred and three thousand,\ncloud-cranes descending in graceful pairs.\n\n**Song of Contentment**\nDo you know what the immortals’ work entails?\nIf you knew, you would not seek so carelessly.\nFirst turn inward and measure yourself—\nonly speak when your heart is free of deceit.\n\nThe immortals guard their arts, not out of secrecy,\nbut because few possess the karmic roots.\nWere it so easy for all to attain,\nwould the celestial mechanism be so lightly shared?\n\nTo study the Dao or seek immortality, fix your will,\nhold fast to one resolve without doubt.\nSteady your heart from beginning to end—\nas gold is tested by fire, so too is the Way.\n\nYour mind is thick with brambles,\ngood roots sprout only to become demons.\nIf you first align with the immortals’ intent,\nyour portion is set—what more can be done?\n\nA clouded mind breeds wicked words and deeds,\nand every act becomes a mistake.\nSeek nothing from others, desire nothing for yourself—\nbetter to have never begun at all.\n\nReflect on this truth,\nand let your heart rest firm.\nLook at those who’ve attained through the ages—\ntheir minds were never thus.\n\nI long to meet a true seeker,\nyet when I do, their hearts shift like shadows.\nWhy speak of transmission as easy or hard?\nIt is the gate of mystery that remains untested.\n\nAsk yourself why you do not reflect—\nleave your fate to the vault of heaven.\nSimply tend your heart and follow your nature,\nfor musk’s fragrance needs no proclamation.\n\nThe Jade Toad was once a mountain hermit,\nyet a kindred spirit is hard to find.\nNow, while my straw sandals are still sturdy,\nmy face flushes like peach blossoms, my eyes dark and clear.\n\nJade Toad, why do you still scheme?\nBetter to brush your sleeves and depart.\nIf there were a place to save others,\nZhong and Lü would already be flaunting their prowess.\n\nNo one knows—\nI go alone,\nwhite clouds stretch a thousand miles, unturning.\nI return to guard my three-legged cauldron,\nsimmering the bright wind and clear moon.\n\n**Tea Song**\nWillow eyes steal glances at flying plum blossoms,\na hundred flowers bow to the east wind’s breath.\nSpring arrives in the valley’s source unnoticed,\nuntil a thunderclap startles the dawn branches.\n\nThe branches dare not unfurl their banners,\nfirst offering jade and gold in marvelous display.\nSparrow-tongue buds hold spring but cannot speak—\nonly the morning dew and mist understand.\n\nPlucked with dew and mist, they are taken home,\nsteamed, then pounded thousands of times.\nShaped into three hundred moon-round cakes,\nfire’s art tempered with both civil and martial skill.\n\nAt the mill’s edge, jade dust swirls like flying catkins,\npearls scatter from the grindstone like golden threads.\nA small cauldron of Shou Shan bronze,\nfresh spring water boiled over a lively flame.\n\nCrab-eye bubbles vanish, fish-eyes rise,\nthe wind and rain whisper through scraping pine.\nA flowered bowl of Dingzhou red jade,\nbrimming with auspicious snow and floating white foam.\n\nGreen clouds enter the mouth, birthing fragrant winds,\na boundless orchid and angelica perfume.\nCool breezes rise beneath the arms, pores open—\nall worldly cares washed from the withered gut.\n\nHave you not seen\nMeng the Remonstrator,\nwhose tea startled Lu Tong from sleep?\nOr Bai Juyi,\nwhose gift of tea roused Ma Xi from drunkenness?\n\nLu Yu wrote the *Classic of Tea*,\nCao Hui composed the *Inscription of Tea*.\nMinister Fan, the upright, smiled over tea,\nhis gauze hat askew as he brewed stone sprouts.\n\nSu Xu saw rain like cinnabar,\ndotting each cup with calamus blossoms.\nSu Dongpo mastered the art of boiling water,\noften seeking a sip after wine’s end.\n\nZhao Zhou dreamed of meeting Nanquan,\nlovingly kindling incense to steep tea’s green.\nWe brew tea with savor,\nfirst blending it with the divine water of Hua Chi.\n\nA plot in the cinnabar field, self-cultivated,\ngolden lads and maidens gather the harvest.\nHeavenly furnace and earthen tripod follow the seasons,\nrefining yellow sprouts, boiling white snow.\n\nIts taste like sweet dew, finer than aged wine,\ndrinking it, one feels lingering illness vanish.\nThe body lightens, ready to ascend the celestial road—\nwho knows if heaven has tea?\n\n**Song of the Great Dao**\nCrow flies gold, hare runs jade,\nthe three realms a single grain of millet,\nmountains and rivers, the great earth—how many years of dust?\nYin and yang inverted, plunging into the mysterious valley.\n\nMan’s life flickers like stone sparks and lightning,\na few guest magpies lodging in the branches.\nSang fields and blue seas shift through spring and autumn,\nheaven and earth never release Kan and Li from their embrace.\n\nIn the high nine heavens, wind and moon chime,\nthe immortals’ bellies hold no idle sorrow.\nThose who study immortality in the world\ntransform their hearts to purity and elegance.\n\nUnread in alchemical classics, they yearn for ascension,\npointing at shadows, prattling of emptiness to deceive and frighten.\nSometimes they gallop with their three-inch tongues,\nor feign muteness on the street corners.\n\nAmid the upright, beware of the crooked;\nwithin the true, discern the false.\nIf you are a person of clarity and detachment,\nyourself beyond all things, utterly unburdened.\n\nGather qi and concentrate spirit,\nto refine the golden elixir—how many will you fool?\nLuring thieves into your home to open the treasure vault,\nunaware there is another self beyond the self.\n\nSeek the self within the self,\nwhere harmonious qi and emptiness are a spring in a pot.\nCapture the six thieves with your hands,\nchew the three corpses alive in your mouth.\n\nThe three corpses and six thieves were never real—\nthey arise only from the heart’s frantic busyness.\nThe Jade Emperor does not merely cherish his edicts,\nbut demands the guarding of spirit and qi.\n\nThis spirit and qi congeal into true essence,\ncalled Pure Yang, the ninety-nine cycles complete.\n\nAt this moment, the sacred embryo is complete,\na somersault off the ten-thousand-foot cliff.\nLead and mercury are but dung and dust,\ndragon and tiger mere chickens and dogs.\nWhite gold and qi, tin in countless forms,\nquicksilver and cinnabar entice each other—\nwhite snow and yellow sprouts take no shape,\nthe divine pool’s waters flow without a spring.\n\nFailing to turn back with that single move,\nyou rush through wind and rain in all directions.\nRushing in all directions to seek a master,\nwhen you find a false teacher’s guidance,\nyou follow blindly—how pitiful!\nThe great Dao is never far from the square inch of the heart,\nits workings subtle, its practice steadfast.\n\nNot through visualization,\nnot through intention,\nnot by circulating essence and qi within the body—\nseal one pass, and a hundred are secure.\nTurn the body, and the path becomes truly easy.\n\nThe heart without a heart has no form,\nwithin the formless, the infant’s spirit is nurtured.\nTo learn immortality is to reach the infant’s state—\nthe moon shines bright in the cold pool’s stillness,\nwithered wood blooms with fragrance beyond,\nby the sea, pledging vows with the white gulls.\nA moment’s effort is easily done,\nthe great elixir is but a moment’s achievement.\n\nClinging to strange words and marvelous speech,\ncountless metaphors are just like this.\nLet life take its course, let death take its course—\nonly ensure you are master of yourself.\nClouds in the sky can be bound,\nthe moon in water can be grasped.\nThe two words \"body\" and \"heart\"—\nare both fire and medicine.\nTortoise and snake, crow and hare—all idle talk,\nhusband and wife, male and female—cast them all aside.\n\nHave you not seen?\nFrom emptiness arises the natural,\nfrom the natural arises the one qi,\nfrom the one qi, things are formed,\nwhen qi is full, heaven and earth divide.\nHeaven and earth have no mind,\nthe two qi are naturally so.\nAll things flourish and wither,\nthe great reckoning has its end and beginning.\nGrasp the precelestial’s natural origin,\nand you hold the true root of nature and life.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand words,\nthe *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred characters—\nform and spirit, nature and life,\nbody and heart, spirit and qi,\ntheir union forms the great treasure,\nthis is the principle of the golden elixir.\nMost cling to the world,\nmistaking effort for effortlessness,\nbut the resolute man can comprehend.\nChew on these words in quiet moments—\nif even the ancient sages and worthies\nestablished teachings to guide others, how could they be wrong?\nIf you can stride straight down the direct path,\na single road leads straight to the Three Pure Ones’ pavilion.\n\nBeneath the Three Pure Ones’ pavilion lies a mass of marrow,\nday and night its radiance gleams like jade.\nCloud Valley Daoist, an immortal among men,\nhis bones refined, his qi flourishing—truly noble.\nYet for years he was bound by the red dust,\nsixty-four years of error.\nScraping away the dust and grime, his eyes open wide,\nhe lets out a long whistle and returns.\n\nImmortals rely on but two things—\njust a touch of foolishness among men,\nand suddenly they too reach Penglai.\nThe Master of Mount Wuyi speaks to you,\nseeing in you the true bones of an immortal.\nNow I no longer refine form and spirit,\nsometimes wild, sometimes unruly—\nin cold, the elixir field’s fire warms me,\nin hunger, I feast on the snow of Jade Lake.\n\nLast year, my immortal teacher sent word:\nmy name is recorded in the Golden Tower.\nA vain name in the world, hard to escape,\nnow my heart and conduct stray even further.\nHow can I bear the Jade Emperor’s pity?\nHis summons to return—I have not yet complied.\n\n**Prayer for Rain**\nHeaven and earth are deaf,\nsun and moon are blind,\nthe world suffers drought, yet no rain falls,\nmountains and rivers wither, grasses and trees parch.\nThe carefree in heaven hear the people’s suffering—\nI shall ride a crane down to Fusang,\nrouse the weary dragon with a single strike,\nbind the scorching yang spirits below the Star of Kuí.\nWith iron chains, send them to Deng’s estate.\n\nCommand the Thunder Lord,\ndispatch the Lightning Mother,\nin an instant, the world is transformed,\nwind and clouds swallow and exhale.\nThe old general of divine martial prowess,\na single drop from heaven’s golden vase,\nthreads through the sky like a shuttle’s weave.\nIt becomes frozen rain across the four heavens,\nsweeping away the world’s heat.\n\nIf some wag reports this to the lord,\nsoon they’ll seek the rain-bringing immortal—\nbut he is already on the Yangtze, a single oar’s sound.\n\n*Xiuzhen Shishu Shangqing Ji*, Scroll Thirty-Nine—Complete\n*Xiuzhen Shishu Shangqing Ji*, Scroll Forty\n\n**Five Poems on Mount Wuyi**\n\n**I**\nNo rainbow

sleeves to hold wind and moon,\ndrunk, I clutch my gourd to bind ghosts and spirits.\nBrandishing the silver toad, I stir heaven and earth,\nby night, I boil the golden cauldron to cook the stars.\nLost in slumber, I forget the path of schemes—\nmy body is a wheel of crimson flame.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed in Master Zheng Tongmiao’s Chamber**\nA few games of uncontentious chess,\na cup or two of self-poured wine.\nLet it be—flow with the world as it is,\nand when the elixir is complete, cloud-cranes will come of their own.\n\n---\n\n**Miscellaneous Verses on the Nine Bends**\n\n**First Bend: Cave of Ascending Perfection**\nEagerly, I seek the immortal’s abode,\nat the mouth of the Cave of Ascending Perfection, bees hold court.\nA spring stream ripples with cold jade-green,\ncarrying petals of red peach blossoms.\n\n**Second Bend: Jade Maiden Peak**\nA singular peak, flower-adorned by the water,\nits jade bones and crystalline flesh like a maiden’s form.\nMist-sleeved, clad in rosy clouds, spring veiled in rain,\nher cloud-coiffed, mist-tangled hair combed by the dawn wind.\n\n**Third Bend: Rock of the Immortal’s Loom**\nWoven into rainbow skirts to fend off the chill wind,\nthe jade shuttle, with a flick of the hand, transforms into a dragon.\nThe Weaving Maiden returns to the Milky Way’s edge—\nthe cave’s white clouds and empty loom remain.\n\n**Fourth Bend: Golden Rooster Rock**\nThe cold pool brims, reflecting the moon in its depths,\nthe hollow valley swallows the mist.\nThe golden rooster first heralds dawn within the cave,\nwith a single *yi-wo* cry, it soars into the sky.\n\n**Fifth Bend: Iron Flute Pavilion**\nA vast expanse of night’s essence stirs the pure wind,\na white crane alights upon the verdant pine.\nThe moon chimes in the empty mountains as the iron flute plays—\na single note awakens the dragon of Jade Abyss.\n\n**Sixth Bend: Immortal’s Palm Peak**\nThe immortal, grasping vines, ascends the jade-green cliff,\nwhere an ancient alchemical terrace once stood.\nTo this day, the stone bears the imprint of her palm—\nten spring-onion fingers, layered with green moss.\n\n**Seventh Bend: Stone Tang Temple**\nThe high monk penetrated Zhaozhou’s Chan,\nuprooting the temple to relocate it to Tusita Heaven.\nIn the second month of the second year of Tiansheng,\na single night’s thunderstorm shook the mountains and rivers.\n\n**Eighth Bend: Drum Tower Rock**\nA towering cliff, a stone tower soars ten thousand feet,\ncloud-wrapped, mist-bound, overlooking the cold stream.\nLong ago, the Manting Pavilion hosted the descendants’ feast—\nthe stone drum was carried away to the ancient ferry.\n\n**Ninth Bend: New Village Market**\nThe setting sun moves the boat to the azure shoal,\nbeyond the peach blossom grove, green mountains appear.\nSuddenly, the sounds of chickens and dogs reach my ears—\nwithout meeting Master Liu, I refuse to return.\n\n---\n\n**Ten Boat Songs of the Nine Bends**\n*Mount Wuyi*\n\n**Thirty-Six Peaks of Wuyi**\nThirty-six peaks in wondrous array,\none cleft reveals nine bends in jade-green sway.\nWhite clouds veil the eyes—where to gaze?\nWho says immortals dwell in Wuyi’s maze?\n\n**First Bend**\nBeneath Manting Peak, the immortal boat glides,\njade blossoms at the cave-mouth, emerald mist abides.\nSince the King of Wei ascended to the crimson gate,\nthe apes on the ridge still mourn their fate.\n\n**Second Bend**\nHow many generations have passed below the hill?\nThe pipes and drums of old now silent, still.\nThe cinnabar furnace sprouts spring grass again,\nbefore Jade Maiden Peak, white clouds remain.\n\n**Third Bend**\nThe immortal boat moors at the cliff’s brow,\nhow many autumns since the yellow crane flew now?\nPeach blossoms fill the grotto, yet none appear,\nfor whom does the green stream flow here?\n\n**Fourth Bend**\nA thousand acres of autumn light, nowhere to stay,\nthe limpid pool gleams like polished bronze’s ray.\nThe golden rooster’s cry topples the moon on high,\ncold mist drifts, the wind sighs.\n\n**Fifth Bend**\nWho plays the iron flute’s resounding tone?\nThe stone cliff splits, the old dragon starts

brews fresh tea’s foam.\nThe host points afar where blue smoke swirls,\na waterfall hangs from the cliff, snipping snow like pearls.\n\n**Seventh Bend**\nStill autumn mist veils the emerald bay,\nonce here stood a Chan gate, now swept away.\nThe river god moved to the Dragon Palace deep,\none night’s wind and thunder shook the mountains from sleep.\n\n**Eighth Bend**\nA few sandpipers drift on the azure stream,\nreeds and flowers on both banks, dusk’s sorrowful gleam.\nFrom Drum Tower Rock, a flute’s single note—\nstartled, the phoenix tree sheds autumn’s coat.\n\n**Ninth Bend**\nMountain market bathed in sunset’s glow,\na village of chickens and dogs in fading light’s show.\nRice fields rise and fall like a chessboard’s play,\na few crows and egrets take flight this day.\n\n---\n\n**Eleven Poems on Wuyi’s Scenes**\n\n**Spring**\nRain clears, mist congeals in the setting sun,\nthe cuckoo’s cry breaks how many hearts as one?\nThe east wind stirs no sentiment here,\ncountless fallen blossoms—spring’s fragrance clear.\n\n**Summer**\nOrioles call the green willows to sprout new leaves,\nbutterflies urge the lotus to bloom, fresh and brief.\nA sudden waft of warm wind arrives,\nas the sun sets, crows clamor in hives.\n\n**Autumn**\nRain’s aftermath—moss like brocade heaps,\nsunrise gilds morning sunflowers in golden deeps.\nFacing the scene, a clear whistle rings,\nstartling the wild apes in green willow springs.\n\n**Winter**\nSnow buries the mountain path at dusk’s close,\na single plum branch heralds spring’s repose.\nLast night by the stream, the water ran cold,\nwind rolls crimson clouds as dawn unfolds.\n\n**Dawn**\nWind stirs a thousand trees, waking roosting magpies,\nthe moon sets west, the apes’ cries rise.\nClouds part to reveal the temple deep in green,\na bell tolls before the jade cliff serene.\n\n**Dusk**\nGreen clouds, red trees—evening’s query,\nthe sun sinks, crows scatter, the sky grows weary.\nThe herb-gatherer strays, lost in return,\nthe thatched hut stands empty, the brushwood gate shut in concern.\n\n**Journeying**\nRain’s trailing feet retreat with evening’s haze,\nstraw sandals, bamboo staff tread verdant ways.\nThe east wind unbinds spring’s intent,\nloosing fallen blossoms, crows cry as they’re sent.\n\n**Abiding**\nMoon bright, wind clear—three paths of bamboo,\napes cry, cranes shriek through a window’s gloom.\nOpening the door, the mountain’s green pours in,\ntesting the stars with burning cypress within.\n\n**Seated**\nA thousand peaks, apes call beneath moon’s glow,\nten thousand sounds, wind howls—autumn’s show.\nMist dampens moss, smoke drifts in haze,\nwhite clouds drift, dreams cross Penglai’s ways.\n\n**Reclining**\nDeep in descending mist, no one comes near,\nwhite clouds hush, moss veils the ear.\nPine flowers fall, the crow’s voice stills,\na pillow of pure wind returns dreams’ thrills.\n\n**Closing**\nThe Daoist’s heart transforms with all things’ flow,\nfacing scenes without thought, poems naturally grow.\nVerses spontaneously reveal creation’s art,\nonce composed, creation falls silent, apart.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at the Meditation Hut**\nHere at dusk, the wind sighs cold,\nbefore the cliff, the alchemy furnace lies empty, old.\nUnbearable—the flowers fall, mist takes flight,\nagain, the cold ape weeps for Master Hui in the night.\n\n---\n\n**For Daoist Chen

Concluded*\n*Xiuzhen Shishu Shangqing Ji, Volume 42*\n\nWhite Jade Toad of Hainan’s *Ode to the Lazy Old Man’s Studio*\n\nSu Sen of Meishan, old in idleness, named his studio the \"Lazy Old Man’s.\" Was the Old Man truly lazy? Though gulls shunned mandarin ducks, how could he ignore the people’s desperate gaze?\n\nI hear that in his youth, he was not so indolent—whipping his heart with yellow silk, binding his hair in a green robe, gazing at mirrors for glory, and wielding his pen like a blade. He moved with grace within the bounds of Zhou and Kong, soaring beyond Han and Liu. The common folk then pointed and stared, hoping this \"lazy\" one would take Yu or Gao as his model.\n\nWhy, then, did he grow lazy? Before his rank was revealed, his ambition for office was already sated. The scholarly groves grew thin as mist, the sea of learning chilled as waves—how could he not disappoint the hopes of his gowned peers?\n\nSince the Jia Tai era, when he retired to Junyang, then served as the Marquis of Hengyang, and later sought reclusion in Wuyi, the Lazy Old Man had no heart for office, his official passions fading like autumn. Among the gentry, none could sway him with flattery, so he coiled like a dragon, refusing to bring rain.\n\nNow past the age of following his heart, he is even lazier than before, content to idle away his days amid clouds and waters. He has a floating home in Jinhua, the former residence of his late father, the Minister. Before the hall, a space of over a zhang was roofed with eight or nine beams. Three sides were fitted with windows, barely enough to kneel in. Planks replaced bricks, lime smoothed the walls. He kept a single flower, stood a zither of green paulownia, and hung a three-foot sword of Wenyan green jade.\n\nWhen the Old Man wished to sleep, he transformed into a butterfly, flying to the Land of Hua Xu. When he wished to drink, he stretched his neck like a jade rainbow, draining the sea of wine in one gulp. When he wished to chant, jade trees stirred in the wind, scattering pearls and gems upon the page. When he wished to play chess, the stars scattered in disarray, the sound of carved jade chilling the air. When he wished to dance, the Valley Spirit shifted the jade mountain, his flying sword pointing to the azure sky. When he wished to roam in joy, he dragged his seven-foot staff, letting out a long whistle among the pines. When he wished to sing wildly, a single note from his iron flute summoned the dragon of Jade Abyss.\n\nIf streams and mountains gained fame without harming grass or trees, the Old Man wrote poems in kind. If flower spirits wandered lost and moon souls failed to return, he drowned them in wine. He was lazy only in worldly affairs, for in these, his laziness knew no laziness.\n\nAt leisure, he played chess; in high spirits, he drank; when elated, he sang; when drunk, he slept. Life was his to command, his will his own. He entrusted each matter to its proper place, his heart free of care, his mind free of affairs—this was the Old Man’s laziness.\n\nTo sit in oblivion like Xi Yan, to lose his reflection like Qi, to merge with the void, to transform with all things, to reach the point of forgetting sleep and food—this was true laziness.\n\nThe Old Man’s heart, sovereign of his palace, gazed with cold eyes upon the red and purple of the world, like a cuckoo scolding swans and geese, or thorns mocking the finest timber.\n\nIn his studio, he followed only his lazy whims. Rain provided ink-water, bamboo supplied winds to sweep his couch, clouds unfurled as curtains to veil the mountains, and grass served as a mat upon the rocks. By day, green serpents coiled from the incense burner; by night, silver lamps floated like red millet. He drank wine and swallowed wind and moon, chanted poems and bit clouds and water, hewed bamboo to fell spring winds, and moved flowers to uproot the dawn moon—these were things even his laziness could not neglect.\n\nA guest from Wuyi, seeing how lazy he had become, visited the Lazy Old Man’s studio and, drunk with inspiration, wrote with unbridled ink. He asked the Lazy Old Man:\n\n*\"The east wind parts the willow’s eyes,\nThe golden crow scolds the peach blossoms.\nSpring dwells within your studio—\nWhy seek joy beyond the fields?\"*\n\nWas the Old Man too lazy to tread the green at this time?\n\n*\"The rain passes through the secluded pavilion,\nA bright moon over a pond of lotuses.\nA fragrant breeze rises from the brush—\nThis heart knows no heat.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to enter the grove then?\n\n*\"Fallen leaves follow the lone crow,\nCalling frost to test the cold.\nAutumn’s light fills heaven and earth,\nAll things at ease and free.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to climb heights at that moment?\n\n*\"Water soaks the shadow of plum blossoms,\nA gibbon’s cry through a frosted tree.\nTaro embers warm the earthen stove,\nTea brewed from melted snow.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to seek the plum blossoms then?\n\nThe Old Man replied: *\"Indeed.\"*\n\nAlas! Dust stings the eyes, fame and profit burn the heart—how could one suddenly become as lazy as the Old Man? His zither gathered dust for days, his inkstone dried without water—all due to his laziness. He shut the door to the clear wind, left the moon to wait for his couch—his laziness knew no bounds.\n\nThe Lazy Old Man’s abode could shelter from wind and rain, his fields could provide gruel, his son could inherit his robe and bowl. He mingled not with the vulgar, spoke not to others, his body as light as a feather—truly an old Chan master in life.\n\nUpon meeting White Jade Toad of Wuyi, he delighted in their endless conversation. Jade Toad, overjoyed, composed this ode to his studio.\n\nThis occurred on the fifteenth day of early summer in the Jia Ding Bing Zi year. Attended by Mao Ying Xuan, Tao Hong, and others.\n\n**Preface to the Treatment of Abscesses and Fistulas**\n\nGoose fat and phoenix eggs heal carbuncles and boils—this is the art of Bian Que. Unicorn wax and tortoise toes cure abscesses and fistulas—this is the learning of Yu Pi. If the method is not esteemed, the medicine is not deemed cheap; if the learning is not mastered, people deem it wondrous. When the wondrous is deemed unattainable by learning, the method becomes precious, and the medicine no longer inexpensive—all the work of Yu Cun and Bian Que.\n\nThe Daoist of Wuyi, Huang Jichang, in his youth roamed the wilds of Chonggang, where he once encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the remedies for abscesses and fistulas. He guarded the formula closely, sealing it in his arm pouch, never to be shown to others. Yet observing the man himself—his spirit soaring and untrammeled—one could well believe in his encounters.\n\nThe human body is a vessel of flowing qi; should it harbor stagnation, pus and clotted blood congeal, spreading and thickening, until one cries out in pain, unable to endure. Some suffer from the wasting of blood in fistulas, others from the seepage of internal decay, soaking their clothes and corroding their flesh—who would desire such afflictions? Of the four hundred and four diseases, none wrings the heart like abscesses and fistulas.\n\nHuang Jichang is a man in the lineage of Yu Pi and Bian Que. The medicines he employs are goose fat, phoenix eggs, unicorn wax, and tortoise toes. One day, when I visited his Cloud Nest, he spoke of his learning, his remedies, and the countless patients he had treated. It seemed he wished for me to compose a piece in praise. Alas! Musk does not rely on wind to diffuse its fragrance, nor pearls on oysters to gleam—why must I wield my brush to amuse him?\n\nSince I know his skill, I told him this: Sun Simiao said, *\"At first, an abscess is a fleshy knot; once formed, it is a pearl of congealed flesh. When it first bursts, it is like a split melon; when fully ruptured, like a peeled tangerine.\"* Reflecting on these words, one cannot bear the suffering of those afflicted with abscesses. Yet if I were to stand before such a patient, my brows would furrow in distress, my face contort in aversion—even as I longed to knead the wound, I would recoil from sucking it. Is this how a physician should act? You, sir, must emulate the true healer.\n\nYou should cultivate the blessings you sow and the deeds you accumulate, for they are no less than the labors of the woodcutter Su or the surgeon’s skill in lancing boils. Did you know that the First Emperor of Qin carved into human flesh, and Emperor Wu of Han flayed human skin? You, however, treat abscesses and fistulas without decoctions or cauterization, without needles or scraping—only with medicine to attack the illness within and salves to apply without, until the affliction falls away like a leaf from a branch or a flower yielding fruit. Such is the depth of your care.\n\nThis is written for all to see.\n\n---\n\n**Essay to Banish the Sleep Demon**\n\nMan is not granted a hundred years—how many days does he truly have? A hundred years contain thirty-six thousand days, each with a hundred thousand moments. Yet in the span of a single moment, a finger’s snap, morning rises and evening falls—such is the constant of time. Within a hundred years, seventy-seven million five hundred thousand moments are spent in social obligations, and another seventy-seven million five hundred thousand in sleep. Subtracting sleep, man has but fifty years of waking life—how much less for those who do not reach a hundred?\n\nYet some indulge in slumber as if unaware even of grass and trees. The primordial spirit flees its abode, scattering without return; true qi departs the body, leaving breath without anchor. Clouds veil the heart’s sky, waves muddy the sea of nature. The mirror of wisdom gathers dust, the sword of intellect grows dull. Wakefulness becomes slumber, clarity turns to obscurity. One drifts like a ghostly mountain, darkens like a spectral valley. In stupor, one is as insensate as a drunkard; in torpor, as dazed as one drugged with mandrake. The taste is like a parched fish ensnared in a net; the longing, like a starving rat coveting a painted cake. The snores roar like thunder shaking a thousand peaks; the struggle is like waves crashing into a cliffside well.\n\nNo blade of wisdom can pierce it, no rope of intellect can pull one back. What of the stillness of a bright window and a chaste desk? The purity of a plain mat and a small pillow? Within, the empty valley cradles a myriad spirits; without, the great earth houses a hundred bones. The eyes seal shut like lacquer, the limbs grow heavy as stone. Then the Sleep Demon arrives, consorting with the heart’s monkey and the mind’s horse. It defies the sovereign of the heart, spurns the spirit of the valley. It seizes the jade towers and golden palaces of the body, turning them into its own fortress—looming ten thousand fathoms high, weighing a thousand pounds. It plunders the soul, buries the spirit, steals the cinnabar from one’s home, and robs the treasure vault.\n\nIt conjures illusions, transforms appearances. No talisman or charm can chase it; no libation can appease it. Thus, I demote the Minister of Qingzhou, summon Black Sweetness, call forth Yellow Slumber, and dispatch the Cloud-Cream Envoy, arming him with a sword to strike. Yet still, the Sleep Demon rages unchecked, unmoved by war, unshaken in countenance.\n\nThen I command the Ink-Pine Censor, the Rabbit-Hair Secretary, the Black Jade Cavalry Officer, and the Ke Creek Commander to drive dragons and tigers into battle. I seal the nose, bind the tongue, listen with the ears, see with the eyes—yet the Sleep Demon nestles in the land of Hua Xu, hides in the realm of the locust tree, transforms into a butterfly, shifts into an ant. Between the pillars, it murmurs in delight.\n\nSo I weave a willow carriage and mend a grass boat, fill paper money into bags and bundle bamboo-wrapped millet. I paint an ox to pull the cart, draw a dragon to pole the boat. With three bows, I address the Sleep Demon: *\"I have long heard of your desire to depart. I have chosen the day and prepared the vessel. You and your companions should take your leave. Here is rice to fill your bowls, wine to fill your cups. Go with your friends, linger no longer. Flee swift as clouds, vanish quick as lightning. Search your hearts—do you truly wish to stay?\"*\n\nHolding the breath to listen in silence, turning the gaze inward to observe its form—tears and laughter fail, disquiet and restlessness arise. Shoulders hunch as the neck strains, eyes bulge as the tongue lolls. At first, one doubts its very existence; now, one knows it for the Sleep Demon.\n\nAs if in speech, it says: *\"Sleep itself has no demon—your heart is the darkness. You shiver, yet I wear no cloak; you hunger, yet I eat no food. I bear you no grudge, not even the slightest, yet our bond is as glue and lacquer. Now you bid me depart, but I have no home to return to. Though I take leave of you, how can I not weep? I am a ghost, not a man—what need have I for carriage or boat? What use are food and drink to me? I would eat, yet have no mouth; I would dress, yet have no body to bare. I would ride, yet there is no road; I would sail, yet there is no shore. If you would but turn your thoughts inward, you would see I am no affliction of yours. Wash your heart clean and cultivate stillness—then you may seal your form and close your spirit.\"*\n\nAgain I address it: *\"You merely see me sit in silence and peer through my windows; you merely see me lost in thought and scale my palace walls. I am no Chen Tuan dreaming his way into the vast wilds, nor King Xiang of Chu dreaming his way into Gaotang. Do not bewitch me—lest I cleave you with the Heavenly Axe.\"*\n\nFour or five Sleep Demons turn to one another, faces aghast, and speak in reply: *\"Though we are called the essence of sleep-demons, we are but one spirit of your own self. When the spirit is clear, the Sleep Demon departs; when the spirit is dull, the Sleep Demon arises. Sleep only the body, not the spirit—that is the way. Gather us into primordial essence, store us as the one numinous spark, melt us into the Great Void, release us into the Great Clarity. If you but keep us in your dwelling and preserve your form, you may escape death and attain long life.\"*\n\nI laugh and say: *\"Do I drive out the Sleep Demon—or does the Sleep Demon drive me out?\"*\n\n**Admonition on the Study of the Dao**\nWhen Sima Ziwei first sought immortality, he placed a hundred pieces of tile before his desk. For every scroll of the *Scripture of Salvation* he read, he moved one tile beneath the desk. Each day, through all one hundred divisions of time, he studied a hundred scrolls. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, Keeper of the Registers, and the True Person of the Cinnabar Prime of the Grand Empyrean.\n\nLikewise, when Ge Xiaoxian first refined the elixir, he always held a rosary in hand. Each day, seated by the alchemical furnace, he recited the full name of the Jade Emperor ten thousand times. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of the Purple Spirit of the Jade Void, the Mysterious and Tranquil True Person of Universal Transformation.\n\nWhat manner of men are we? Born in the Central Kingdom, raised in noble households, our six senses complete, our nature and intellect keen—we ought to kindle the resolve for diligence and swiftly ascend the steps of the Most High.\n\nThe crow soars over Fusang, the hare flies to the Broad Cold Palace. The swallow returns to the Black Robes, the wild goose crosses Mount Heng. Xihe drives the sun and moon, and the sun and moon hasten the years. Human life is but a dream, death no more than a night’s slumber. How many times have we scratched our heads in vain, drowned our aspirations in poetry and wine, utterly heedless of the Dao, the mind-monkey left without a master?\n\nFrom this day forth, I sever all ties. Turning back to survey the path ahead—youth does not return, time must not be squandered. One day, when I gaze down upon the mortal realm, my eyes will look down upon the cosmos. I shall ride the white clouds, tread the Purple Pole—all beginning today.\n\nExert yourselves! Exert yourselves!\n\n*On Dreams*\n\nThe Divine Farmer dreamed that the Heavenly Sovereign bestowed upon him the Jade Book of Herb-Tasting; the Yellow Emperor dreamed of journeying to the land of Huaxu and the Great Court; Shun dreamed of bowing before his ministers; Gao Huangming dreamed of attaining the teachings of the Zhi Zong lineage; Confucius dreamed of meeting the Duke of Zhou; Lao [Laozi] dreamed of traveling to Śrāvastī—all these were dreams. Yet they were not the sleep of sleep, nor the dreams of dreams.\n\nConsider Zhuang Zhou’s dream of becoming a butterfly, or Lü Dongbin’s dream of being an ant—vastly different paths indeed. The *Nanhua Sutra* states: \"In their slumber, no dreams; in their waking, no cares.\" This arises from the undivided concentration of spirit and the undispersed gathering of qi. For they had penetrated to the primordial mind-ground of Fuxi, and thus what they called \"dreams\" were but the communion of spirit and the union of sincerity—not the deluded fantasies of sleep.\n\nIf one fails to grasp the principle of dreamlessness within dreams, the wandering consciousness and drifting soul will float aimlessly, lost and unrecoverable, manifesting in the realms of perception and cognition, only to return to the cycles of womb, egg, moisture, and transformation. How much more so when, amidst the myriad affairs of the world and the ceaseless clamor of thoughts, the mind is ensnared by external things, its tranquility shattered? This is the waking dream—how much deeper the dream of sleep?\n\nSu Dongpo said: \"In this world, there is no Chan of the sleepless; only the snoring slumber of one deep in repose.\" Alas, people today drown their numinous spirit in fermented dregs and sully their inherent nature with dust and grime. How true the words of the ancient worthies: \"This illusory body is but a dream.\"\n\n*Gèn Ān’s Verse in Gift to Vice Magistrate Lu Ziwen*\n*\"Gèn its back, not grasping its body; walking its courtyard, not seeing its person—no blame.\"*\nThe *Tuan* says: \"Gèn means stop. Stop when it is time to stop, act when it is time to act; in movement and stillness, timing is never lost—thus the Dao shines. 'Gèn its stop'—stopping where it should stop. Above and below oppose and do not respond, hence 'not grasping its body'; 'walking its courtyard, not seeing its person'—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"The doubled mountain of Gèn: the noble person reflects without overstepping his position.\"\n\nThe elders said: \"To study the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not as good as reading the single hexagram Gèn.\" For the *Avataṃsaka* speaks only of cessation and contemplation, while Gèn embodies the meaning of the doubled mountain. The mountain is the character *chū* (出, \"to emerge\"): though it halts in obscurity, it emerges into clarity. This is what is meant by: \"Walking to where the waters end, sitting to watch the clouds arise.\"\n\n*Collected Writings on Cultivating Perfection, Volume 42 of the Supreme Clarity Corpus*\n*Collected

Painting**\n\nThe Dao is originally formless—how could it rely on painted forms and adorned images?\nYet people must see things before their hearts are stirred by them.\nThus, one paints what cannot

and boundless skies.\nWithin, there are primal images—\nThese beings defy forced names.\nIf heart and mind can conjure them in vision,\nHow could mere gilding and pigment be amiss?\nVaguely,

lean—how long can they endure the slow erosion of years?\nIncense cools, embers dim—exposed to the assault of wind and rain.\nWe newly invite a master of wind and moon,\nTo once more continue this tale of clouds and waters.\nA bowl of round jade-like grains,\nHalf a skein of fine silver threads.\nMouths agape, awaiting sustenance—how can they feast on mist and dew?\nBrush in hand, ink on paper—yet still they hope for water to freeze at a shout.\n\n**Ordination Certificate Text**\nSeas turn to mulberry fields, mulberry fields to seas—\nIn a single instant, a hundred years may pass.\nTurn the lock in the crown of your head—\nWho among you is not a Celestial of the Great Brahma Heaven?\nThus it is said: a candle in the wind, duckweed on water,\nA vine on the bank, a tree by the well,\nFire beside stone, lightning’s fleeting glow—\nPrepare the mulberry before the rain, dig not the well when thirst already strikes.\n\nNow, at this hour, we, the officiants of this fast, turn our gaze\nFrom the realms of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind,\nAnd from the profound, wondrous, and mysterious teachings of the Dao, scriptures, and masters—\nWe recognize true friends.\nWe prepare a feast of jade scrolls and bamboo slips,\nSummon the star-capped and cloud-robed singers,\nTransforming heaven and earth into a sacred realm of fragrant silk.\nThis, once more, is the first kalpa of the Dragon Han era.\nLamps burn with dragon-fat oil, drawing down the stars of the southern sky;\nIncense from Oxhead Mountain blackens into clouds over the distant peaks.\nNot only in one or two heavens, but in boundless heavens,\nDo celestial blossoms dance;\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, through as many kalpas as grains of sand in a river,\nMay blessings and merit flourish abundantly.\n\nThough this bridge exists,\nHow shall we provide proof?\nThus, we raise the certificate and proclaim:\n\n\"O all you kindred spirits, this is the eye of ten thousand sages and a thousand worthies,\nA stairway to the Three Voids and Four Brahma Heavens.\nIts plain silk—condensed clouds of the azure vault;\nIts black script—sealed in the purple empyrean.\nIn the end, what single phrase is entrusted?\nHow shall it be spoken?\nIn the day, there is the crow; in the moon, the hare;\nIn water, behold the tiger; in fire, the dragon.\nOne day, riding cranes and borne on winds,\nYou shall ascend to Penglai’s first peak.\"\n\n*Ten Books on Cultivating the True, Supreme Clarity Collection, Scroll Forty-Four—Concluded*",

      "translated_text": "**The Thirty-Seventh Scroll of the *Ten Books on Cultivating the True: Upper Clarity Collection***\n*Record of Wandering to Immortal Rock*\n*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\nYellow leaves drift like clouds; fresh geese inscribe the sky. Garden orchids shatter jade; fence chrysanthemums forge gold.\n\nA traveler arrived from Qiongzhou—hair unbound, beard flowing, face weathered, feet bare. His body was clad in coarse hemp, his scriptures half-exposed from their wrappings. A staff slung across his shoulder, his qi transcended the dust. He sought the Three Flowers of Upper Clarity, paying homage to Master Yun Gu at dusk.\n\nBamboo sealed the emerald mist; eaves bells summoned the wind. A lamp glowed faintly red; nesting magpies called their young. The guest loosened his heart, drinking from waterfalls and consuming lingzhi. At midnight, he took his pillow, lying down without dreams. At dawn, he leaned by the window, pursing his lips to sing:\n\n*\"On parasol branches, autumn winds rise;\nGreen waters merge with the sky, sky mirrors water.\nA few crows dot the purple dusk hills;\nThe slanting sun’s shadow falls among reed flowers.\nBees end their court, frogs hold their market;\nA staff rests on my shoulder as I sleep beneath peach mushrooms.\nAt daybreak, the moon’s trace fades—\nOh, when shall I find an extraordinary man\nTo roam Immortal Rock in freedom?\"*\n\nMaster Yun Gu rose and sang in reply:\n\n*\"Wine just sobered, sleep just broken—\nA guest’s long song echoes beyond jade screens.\nI shall tune my voice to clarity, shake my jade collar,\nRide a single leaf on the wind, the azure pool clear.\nGathering the crisp qi of a thousand peaks and ten thousand gorges,\nI return to recline high among pine lattices,\nTo forge a poetic pact with you.\"*\n\nAt dawn the next day, they moored a small willow boat beneath Carp Rock. Level fields spread in twilight; crows and egrets divided black and white. Jagged mountains unfolded; pines and bamboos sketched themselves in ink. Releasing the reins, they ascended Chicken Coop Stone—mountain blossoms dazzled the eyes; rock birds clamored in the ears. Wandering freely, they climbed Tianzhu Peak. The ancient temple stood with four bare walls; cypress seeds rustled in the deep hall. Crimson peaks touched the sky; green vines bridged the void. Gibbons howled at dusk; the moon hung over withered trees. Tigers roared in the clear night; wind howled through a thousand hollows. A sparse bell chimed into the cloud chamber. Holding a gourd, they sought the Cinnabar Well.\n\nSeated on the dustless rock, they chanted a poem:\n\n*\"Atop the peak, a turtledove calls the morning rain;\nPale mist seals the path before the crag.\nLast night, heavy dew dripped from cold pines;\nBroken clouds, homeless, are torn by the wind.\"*\n\nStaff in hand, sandals in order, they rode the wind, ready to depart. Here, Master Yun Gu bowed and spoke of the marvels of the elixir knife. The guest stroked the stone and sang:\n\n*\"In the crescent-moon furnace, crow and hare;\nWithin the cinnabar tripod, dragon and tiger.\nBlack mercury enters red lead—\nIn the red furnace, a single grain rounds.\"*\n\nMaster Yun Gu and the traveler from Qiongzhou then returned. Gibbons wailed in ancient ravines; cranes cried over tinkling springs. The watery realm had no boats; they dragged bamboo along the shore. A lone village where oxen slept; flowing water and white clouds—desolate as Mount Lu.\n\nLater, Master Yun Gu returned to his former abode, but the guest had already wandered away. Thus, he recorded their journey.\n\n---\n\n**Record of Cloud Nest**\n\nWuyi Mountain is a grotto-heaven. Immortals may hide or appear. Long ago, Qian Keng consumed purple lingzhi here, mastering wind and qi. The divine maiden gathered yellow wood, summoning wind and commanding rain. Among the perfected like Zhang and Wei, thirteen men and women attained immortality. In some unknown year, on an autumn evening, the Jade Emperor feasted his descendants. After one cup, flutes and drums echoed in the void. Those present, clad in rainbow skirts and misty sleeves, had already become immortals.\n\nLater generations spoke of Elixir-Refining Rock and Bone-Exchanging Rock—echoes of those bygone events. Legends tell of Daoist Li at Stop-Stop Hermitage, Li Iron Flute at Banner Peak Pavilion, and Li the Mirror-Polisher in Mao Bamboo Grotto—were they one Li or three? Below Ascension Cave lived Zhang Golden Toad; below Drum Cave, Zhang the Straw-Clad—one Zhang or two? Then there was Zhan of Drum Tower Rock, Ge of Spirit Rock, and the late Daoist Wu Huaiyu. All were seen in the mountains, now halting, now soaring on the wind, drifting on leaves across water. Crimson temples, green hair, steps swift as flight. Some shed their forms; some achieved liberation through the corpse. Some vanished; some remained. Those who longed for them could never speak with them.\n\nYet how startling—after a thousand years, immortal traces are few. Only green grass and white clouds endure. The cries of gibbons and cranes are too sorrowful to bear.\n\nThen there was Master Chen of the Cinnabar Pivot. He abstained from grains, taking no sustenance. Though seventy or eighty, his eyes remained bright as lacquer, his hair black, his complexion youthful. No one knew his origins. All day, he sat in silent absorption, his waking and sleeping, laughter and speech unlike ordinary men. His only possession was a tattered sleeve. For a day, he lingered among the Five Bends, reciting Master Huiweng’s verse: *\"The mountain is high, the clouds deep.\"* The misty rain over the level forest seemed as if from yesterday.\n\nThere, he felled bamboo and thatched reeds, building a hut. He named it *Cloud Nest*. Behind it rose the Great Hidden Screen; before it stood the Three Teachings Peak. To the left, Immortal’s Palm; to the right, Heavenly Pillar. Facing the Elixir Furnace Stone, resting against Iron Elephant Rock—shaped like dragons and tigers, wondrous indeed!\n\nA hundred paces east reached Benevolence and Wisdom Hall; a hundred paces west, Immortal’s Journey Lodge. The pines were green, the bamboo emerald, the grass verdant. Cold gibbons called at dawn; azure mist curled. Tower crows hastened dusk; purple haze spread. Clouds flew like white blossoms; crows let fall their crisp cries. How much more the mountain’s blue, the water’s jade, the wind’s clarity, the moon’s whiteness—this land of no human traces.\n\nIf one asked a year of the world, it was but a day in this grotto. No exaggeration. Ah, true joy is enough! Fitting for the old man of the Cinnabar Pivot.\n\nAs for the hut becoming the man, the man the hut—merged with the streams and mountains, transformed with the wind and moon—there were matters of red simurghs and purple lips, blue crows and white cranes. The master knew them.\n\nAfter *Cloud Nest* was thatched, on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the *yihai* year of Jiading (1209), mist and rosy clouds lingered as of old.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Hall of Lingering Sojourn**\n\nBai Yuchan thatched a hut on Wuyi Mountain. One morning, he felt the stirrings of lakes and seas. Staff in hand, sandals fluttering, he had not taken many steps when he turned back to his old hut—gibbons startled, cranes cried. After a few waves of his sleeves, he found himself already in Yanshan.",

      "original_text": "道遇一褐，挈乎归堂，循一灶柏子故事，罢战茗几碗，应言云水滋味如此枯淡，如此孤介。 又言学道如此艰苦，如此玄奥。 予遂有言曰：此去不远八万四千余里，上有太清之都，玄圃丹丘，珠林玉洞，宝花异卉，满目琳琅，丽雀珍禽，声声韶濩，中有长倨大袂汉千辈，举身如鸿毛，一日一戏青鸾舞白鹤，瞥然於五浊恶世之顶，所视苦趣众生，生死死生如蚁旋磨，不忍为之鼻酸。 於是胎其神於尘胞，范其形於色界，自褪褓以及丫冠，不昧夙昔常生修真养元之念，发猛勇心，办精进力，易服毁形，问津於道家者流，以此可见其慈悯众生之美意。 或垢面而松发，或赤足而秃鬓，或冠逍逼如意之冠，或服灵静清淡之服，或青巾纸袄，或巨剑长琴，或单瓢只笠，或华杖芒鞋，徜徉乎井里，萧散乎鏖陌。 世之人以目争观，以手争指，耆以告稚，甲以谕乙。 此则道人也。 夫道不可得而名言，惟弘之在人耳。 所以前辈着述丹经，又形而为之歌诗、契论，皆显露金丹之旨，必欲津筏后学，率归仙吵。 所谓铅银汞砂者，即龙虎水火也，所谓乌兔房壁者，既马牛龟蛇也，所谓夫妇男女者，即君臣子母也，所谓乾坤坎离者，即天地日月也。 喻之为丁公黄婆，名之为婴儿姥女，假之为黄茅白雪，不过阴阳二字。 觊乎尸解，积渐乎飞升。 以要言之，形与袖也，身与心也，神与气也，性与命也，其实一理。 钻五行而聚五气，会三性而结三花，如是而修谓之丹，如是而入谓之道。 则道人在天地问，固非庸常物。 呜呼，昔年穴土以为庐，辑草以为窠，寒则纫兰，馁则茹芝，在於林下，一两声铁笛，发出无穷天地之秘，未得登天以前，巢其身，灰其志，惟恐闲名落人耳，又恐异状碍人目，与溪山鱼乌相忘，与风月烟霞俱化。 白云悠悠，青草芋芋，茂松青竹之下，虽不敢望肉生翅，且图千百岁坐视桑田沧海如何，此则道人也。 良由世丁叔运，时鼓浇风，后进鱼龙，各自菽麦，遂建留云驻鹤之居，以宅此辈，使之宴坐乎绳林，偃仰乎蕈榻，飘雨骤风不能残其身，凝冰积雪不能冽其体，宜乎身安道隆也。 幸而阅阖中往往有奇人志士有大人君子之心，筑堂以居此徒，借粮以饭此徒，赖得金丹之旨，一丝之脉不绝，代不乏人以呜此道。 铅山道堂置之久矣，四明周道明乃瓢笠中翘楚者也，遂启创堂话柄，有皇甫汝禀、汝渠，素志闲雅，酷慕清虚，旧有栖仙迎真之意，所恨独掌不呜锺也，此意与周道明颇相契券。 梓人运斤，陶氏涎臂，倨鸠旱庸，弹指就绪，目之日驻云。 予所喜者，玄纲中兴而妙通老人香篆不灭，及乎观之，专炉，茶鼎潇洒之甚，复有蒲团、革毡、新博、素壁，殊不坠旧典，早昼擅粥，香积有余，云集贴然，巾单挂壁。 其问分形化气之士，又谁不知金汞返还之妙？ 出没隐显，人岂堪测。 於篇诗斗酒之余，弹一两操琴，舞三四歇剑，狂歌野舞，翔然归宿，晨香夕灯，规绳整整，使江湖烟雨之叟，楚越风月之士，源源而来，柄柄而止，方见蓬莱三岛，移在目前，羽衣霓裳，端可顾揖，斯则道堂之设不虚也。 向时，刘安王修仙於汉，昭明太子修仙於梁，李元操修仙於唐，皆宗室中有此挺挺奇特汉，今是堂之主人，此之流也。",
      "translated_text": "Encountering a Daoist in coarse robes, he led him back to the hall, following the old custom of burning cypress seeds in the hearth. Setting aside the tea bowls after battle, they spoke of the flavor of clouds and waters—so withered, so austere. They spoke, too, of the Way of learning: so arduous, so profound. Thereupon I said: \"This place lies not far beyond eighty-four thousand miles, above which lies the capital of the Great Clarity, the Jasper Terrace and Cinnabar Mound, pearl forests and jade grottoes, precious blossoms and rare herbs, all resplendent to the eye. Exquisite birds and rare fowl fill the air with the music of *shao* and *hu*. There dwell a thousand long-robed, wide-sleeved immortals, their bodies light as goose down, who daily sport with blue simurghs and dance with white cranes. In a fleeting moment, they peer down upon the Five Defiled Worlds of suffering, where sentient beings spin through birth and death, death and birth, like ants on a millstone—unable to bear it, their noses grow sour with grief.\n\nThus they incarnate their spirits in the womb of dust, shape their forms within the realm of form. From swaddling to topknot, they never forget their former lives’ resolve to cultivate the true and nurture the primordial. Rousing fierce courage, mustering diligent effort, they cast off worldly garb and mar their appearances, seeking guidance among the followers of the Dao. Herein lies the beauty of their compassion for all beings.\n\nSome wear filthy faces and pine-needle hair; others go barefoot with shorn temples. Some don crowns askew like *ruyi* wands; others don robes of serene simplicity. Some wear blue headscarves and paper jackets; others wield great swords or long zithers. Some carry single gourds or straw hats; others lean on ornate staffs and wear hempen sandals. They wander through villages, drift along country paths. The world’s people vie to gaze upon them, point at them with their fingers, elders tell the young, one neighbor informs another: *These are Daoists.*\n\nYet the Dao cannot be named or spoken; its vastness resides only in the human heart. Thus the ancients composed alchemical classics, then shaped them into songs and poems, treatises and dialogues—all to reveal the essence of the Golden Elixir, to serve as a bridge for later learners, guiding them toward the immortal throng. What is called lead, silver, mercury, cinnabar is but dragon and tiger, water and fire. What is called hare and crow, chamber and wall is but horse and ox, tortoise and snake. What is called husband and wife, male and female is but ruler and minister, parent and child. What is called *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li* is but heaven and earth, sun and moon. They are likened to Ding Gong and Yellow Hag, named as Infant and Crone, borrowed as yellow thatch and white snow—yet all reduce to the two words: *yin* and *yang*. Through gradual accumulation, one attains liberation from the corpse; through steady progress, one ascends in flight.\n\nIn essence: form and sleeve, body and mind, spirit and *qi*, nature and destiny—all are one principle. Boring through the Five Phases to gather the Five *Qi*, uniting the Three Essences to congeal the Three Flowers—such is the cultivation called the Elixir; such is the entry called the Dao. Thus the Daoist in heaven and earth is assuredly no ordinary being.\n\nAlas! In years past, they hollowed earth to make huts, wove grass for nests. In cold, they sewed orchids; in hunger, they ate magic mushrooms. Dwelling in the forest, a few notes from an iron flute would unlock the boundless secrets of heaven and earth. Before ascending to the heavens, they nested their bodies and reduced their ambitions to ash, fearing only that idle fame might reach others’ ears, or that their strange forms might offend the eye. They forgot themselves among streams and mountains, fish and birds, merged with wind and moon, mist and rosy clouds. White clouds drifted endlessly; green grass spread lushly. Beneath towering pines and verdant bamboo, though they dared not hope for flesh to sprout wings, they at least aspired to sit for a thousand years, watching mulberry fields turn to seas, seas to mulberry fields—such were the Daoists.\n\nYet the world now suffers a degenerate age, its customs coarsened by the drumbeat of frivolity. Later generations, like fish and dragons, know only beans and wheat. Thus was built this abode of Lingering Clouds and Perching Cranes, to house such men, allowing them to recline in the forest of ropes, lounge on mushroom couches. Torrential rains and fierce winds cannot harm their bodies; freezing ice and piled snow cannot chill their frames. How fitting that body finds peace and the Dao flourishes!\n\nFortunately, within the palace gates there often appear extraordinary men, scholars with the hearts of great men and noble lords, who build halls to shelter these disciples, lend grain to feed them. Thus the essence of the Golden Elixir endures, its thread unbroken, generation after generation producing those who trumpet this Way.\n\nThe Daoist Hall of Yanshan has stood for ages. Zhou Daoming of Siming, a standout among gourd-and-hat wanderers, initiated its founding discourse. There were Huangfu Rubing and Ruqu, men of leisurely elegance who ardently admired purity and emptiness. Long had they harbored the intent to welcome immortals and greet transcendents, regretting only that a single hand cannot sound the bell. This sentiment resonated deeply with Zhou Daoming.\n\nCarpenters wielded their axes, potters rolled up their sleeves, laborers and artisans worked in concert—all was swiftly accomplished. They named it *Lingering Clouds*. What delighted me most was that the Mysterious Net had revived, and the incense of the Wondrously Penetrating Old Man remained unextinguished. Upon inspection, the alchemical furnace stood in solitary splendor, the tea cauldron exuded carefree charm. There were rush cushions, leather mats, fresh *bo* boards, and plain walls—nothing strayed from ancient traditions. Morning and evening, congee was served in abundance; the fragrance of offerings lingered. Daoists gathered in quiet harmony, their headscarves and robes hung neatly on the walls.\n\nAmong those who split their forms to transform *qi*, who does not know the wonders of returning gold and mercury? Their comings and goings, their concealments and revelations—who can fathom them? Amidst poems and wine, they pluck a tune or two on the zither, dance three or four sword forms. Wild songs and rustic dances lead them homeward. Morning incense, evening lamps—all follows orderly discipline. Thus do the old men of rivers and lakes, the scholars of Chu and Yue, come in streams and settle in droves. Only then does Penglai’s Three Isles appear before one’s eyes, where feathered robes and rainbow skirts may be greeted face-to-face. Truly, the establishment of this Daoist hall is not in vain!\n\nIn former times, Prince Liu An of Han cultivated immortality; Prince Zhaoming of Liang pursued transcendence; Li Yuancao of Tang sought the Dao—all were extraordinary men from imperial clans. The master of this hall belongs to their lineage.\"",

      "translated_text": "Within the Palace of Supreme Subtlety, the essence of the Star of Astral Legs transforms into the pine; the pine’s soul, the pine’s spirit—playing with the white dragon, soaring with the azure phoenix, lithe and luxuriant. Yet amid these, there dwells the Recluse of Seven Pines. The star of the Chamber Lodge in the Palace of Supreme Subtlety metamorphoses into the willow; the willow’s voice, the willow’s mystery—calling the golden oriole, entering the purple simurgh, trailing in gentle grace. Yet within the mist of light rain, there abides the Master of Five Willows. The ancients who concealed themselves among pines sought to manifest their lofty, unyielding integrity; those who hid among willows aimed to display their gentle, modest resolve. Yet who does not know that the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, such as these, endure in the annals of history, their names resounding through the ages? As for the orange—what manner of thing is it truly?\n\nIn Yangzhou, its boughs bear mandarins and pomelos; the tribute of Jiangling offers a thousand orange trees, their owners ranked with marquises of a thousand households—thus is the orange esteemed. The *Record of Local Customs* names the orange \"barbarian citron\"; the people of Ba speak of two elders concealed within an orange’s peel—thus is the orange deemed wondrous. The Xiang and Xiao rivers have their Orange Hamlets; Dongting Lake has its Orange Marsh; Yunmeng has its Orange Village; Pengze has its Orange Market—thus is the orange lauded. Lu Ji concealed oranges to present to his mother; Li Jing ate oranges and thought of his elder brother—thus may the orange embody filial piety and fraternal duty. Li Deyu composed the *Rhapsody on the Auspicious Orange*; Zhang Hua wrote the *Song of the Numinous Orange*—thus may the orange enter the realm of literature. Li Yuan had lines on \"crimson fruit like hanging gold\"; Shen Yue wrote of \"golden raiment, not what I seek.\" In the sixth month of the ninth day, the Penglai Palace of the Tang bestowed oranges upon its ministers; on the first day of the first month, the E-pang Palace of Qin did the same. The abundance of oranges in Dan Lake, the profusion in Han Isle—who does not know the orange’s beauty is not easily obtained? Thus has it been recorded through the ages, for the orange is indeed a marvel.\n\nSpeak of the orange grove, and it is like stars scattered to the ends of the earth; behold its fruit, and it is like pearls strung upon the treetops. Its skin is thin, its segments plump; its fragrance delicate, its taste sweet. Liu Yuxi likened it to the \"sweetness of *yu* and the coolness of *tuo* nectar\"—how much more its blossoms resemble dragon’s spittle, its leaves duck’s topknots, its clusters like wax, its frost like jade? Thus did the Perfected Lü compare the Golden Elixir to a pellet \"large as a pellet, its hue like the red orange.\"\n\nNow I comprehend the orange in full. In the southeastern realm, upon the mountains of Wuyi, within the Cavern of Mysterious Transformation, at the Abbey of Divine Protection, the Hermitage of Serene Integrity—there dwells a Daoist. Chen Hongfan, styled Tianxi, with the Daoist name Rizaozhai, has, beyond his love of the qin and books, an eccentric fondness for oranges. He is passionately devoted to orange groves and has planted many. Yet I suspect what he truly cherishes is not the orange itself, but rather the Perfected Lü’s metaphor for the Golden Elixir. Thus, within his hall, the wind and moon reign; throughout his grove, mist and rain linger. From dawn’s chant to dusk’s libation, he dwells in carefree ease—within, he cultivates his inner power; without, he delights in his surroundings. In haste or upheaval, he ever holds fast to that single golden pellet of the Elixir, his resolve unwavering. Is it any wonder he has chosen this seclusion? Compared to the Recluse of Seven Pines and the Master of Five Willows, he is by no means their inferior.\n\nHis dwelling is named \"Orange Hermitage.\" In broadening its meaning and illuminating its name, I do not err. Chen Tianxi’s bearing and demeanor are like autumn before the frost, like the first month of night, like the dawn-green of water, like the spring-blue of mountains. A single glimpse of his spirit is enough to evoke admiration. In his leisure, by the window’s lattice, his desk holds but a qin; he also tends to a sword—truly, it is the qin of Cangwu and the purple *xun*, the sword of Qingping and the red *jiang*. Often he burns tung resin to temper whale-glue, or binds rabbit’s fur to bamboo for brushes. For the most part, his gate is of pine, his walls bare; no vulgar visitor disturbs his solitude. Thus may he vie with the streams and mountains, the fish and birds, for tranquility; contend with the pines and bamboos, the mist and clouds, for purity of spirit and savor of life. This is why I so delight in Chen Tianxi’s intent.\n\nOne day, after playing his qin and singing a long ode, he raised his cup, then set it down, summoning Taohong and Maoying to beseech me for an essay—seeking to elucidate the meaning of \"Orange Hermitage.\" Of old, the immortal of Mount Wei had a poem: *\"Refining the Returned Elixir is bitter work— / I cannot bear to see sweet oranges.\"* The Old Man of Mount Qingcheng wrote: *\"How many times have I mistakenly swallowed an orange, / Only to long to ascend the clouded heavens.\"* Such were the ancients’ subtle allusions. Thus does Chen Tianxi’s concealment among oranges embody the intent of these two sages of Mount Wei and Mount Qingcheng.\n\nMoreover, as night deepens, the wind turns crisp, the moon bright; suddenly, a gibbon’s cry rings out, and a thousand groves awaken to dawn. In the pause between combing and washing, he cradles his qin by the orange grove’s edge—could there fail to be profound and wondrous meaning in this? At such a moment, I offer him a song:\n\n*\"The orange forms a grove, the orange forms a grove—\nAn acre of white clouds, hollow jade depths.\nWithin, an immortal elder cradles his qin—\nWho knows this heart of his?\"*\n\nThus may one glimpse the savor of \"Orange Hermitage.\"\n\nRecorded by the Daoist of Hainan, Bai Yuchan.\n\n---\n\nThe Master of the Elixir Crucible built his hut in the recesses of the fifth bend of Mount Wuyi. His door remained shut, his grains untouched. One day, a female Daoist arrived from Dongyang, recounting her quest for the Dao. He tested her with trials of tranquility, spoke to her of the world’s shallow morals, and described the hardships of dwelling in mountain valleys, the arduousness of cultivating the Dao, the toil of clearing brambles, the difficulty of securing provisions. After a long while, he said to her: *\"Coarse grains may be boiled into porridge; tattered robes may serve as rags. Flower buds may be eaten; kindling may be gathered for fire. All one needs is a patch of land to raise a thatched hut, weave orchids into a cloak, and strike flint for a fire. Let not the rain wet my head, nor the frost chill my skin. Before father and mother were born, what thought was there for cold or heat? After bones are reduced to ash, hunger can no longer be voiced. If life in the mountains is thus, then the Dao may indeed be attained.\"* Presently, the Dao was achieved, and phoenixes and cranes filled the sky in flight.",

Though not every seeker may attain the rank of Zhong or Lü, I suspect one or two among them shall.\n\nIf one possesses the discerning eye to encounter a youth with lacquer-black hair, who bears a *Boshan* censer and asks what path to pursue—such is the intent of this Daoist hall, such is the calling of the Daoist adept.\n\nWritten in joyful admiration to conclude this record.\n\nOn the second day after Rain Water in the *bingzi* year of Jiading, inscribed in haste by Juyin.",

      "translated_text": "The master laughed and said: *\"Entering the Dao is as easy as a trapped ape fleeing to the forest; abandoning the Dao is as easy as a fish leaping onto the shore. The Dao resides in the heart—where the heart is, there is the Dao. If you can persist to the end, how fortunate I shall be!\"* Thereupon, he took her in as his disciple.\n\nThis Daoist was Liu Miaoqing. Some may doubt, for in her youth she was graceful and alluring, a sight to startle the heart and stir the eyes. Yet through the eye of the Dao, she was but a foul sack of festering pus, a vessel of bitterness and a bait for delusion. Thus, amid the red dust of the world, Miaoqing stood resolute, embodying the bearing of a steadfast hero. I believe her dreams of immortal wanderings and her spirit of Chan transformation enabled her to turn inward, to recognize her original face as her true destiny, and to somersault within the skull—like washing one’s face and finding the nose, requiring not the slightest effort.\n\nMiaoqing built several thatched huts beside the master’s abode and named the place *Thorn Concealment*, borrowing the line from He Xiangu: *\"In secluded mountain forests, thorns hide this body.\"* Amid green pines and emerald bamboo, she lived with carefree ease; the cries of cranes and gibbons echoed through the misty chill, while the spirit of wind and the soul of moonlight stretched boundless and free—such was the joy of *Thorn Concealment*.\n\nWhat, then, occupied her mind within this retreat? I say: in establishing such a refuge, she must have aspired to join the ranks of those who don cloud-scarves and crane-feather robes—serene as a dragon coiled in silence before thunder, composed as a gull in deep slumber, limpid as a spring sky without clouds, still as an autumn pool with its moon, leisurely as a fish darting through waterweeds, unburdened as a crow perched in reeds, crisp as the evening breeze through parasol trees, desolate as morning rain on plantain leaves, fleeting as a daydream now faded, dissolving as a chronic illness shed from the body, clear as a long-standing lawsuit resolved, remote as the twilight path through bamboo, distinct as night snow on a lone pine, unperturbed as an elder nearing old age, unformed as an infant yet unborn, tranquil as Penglai’s three isles upon the sea, vast as the boundless expanse of the Yangtze’s heart, hushed as the first light over a thousand groves, expansive as the fullness of spring in all things, cool as duckweed drifting on water, distant as a single leaf adrift in the void, swift as a sharp blade cleaving bamboo, weightless as a thread suspending a stone.\n\nIts subtlety defies description; its mechanism eludes comprehension—was this not the very purpose of *Thorn Concealment*?\n\nThus, if one seeks no use, one must place oneself in a realm of idle emptiness, allowing the self to merge with the streams and mountains, fish and birds, becoming a single mass of pure, ethereal qi. One must let the self be touched by the forests and springs, wind and moon, to acquire a trace of their wondrous, refined essence. Then, that person shall don the rainbow robes of Penglai and the feathered garments of the Weak Waters. Between Penglai and the Weak Waters, where birds never cease their flight and clouds and mist stretch endlessly, who but such a one could traverse a hundred or two hundred *li* in a single journey to reach that land?\n\nThe ancients compiled *Biographies of the Immortals* and *Biographies of Exemplary Women*—both records of heroic figures among women. Consider Zhang Daoling’s wife, who ascended in flight, and her daughter with her; Xu Jingyang’s wife, who ascended, and her daughter likewise; Ge Xianweng’s wife, who achieved liberation through the corpse, and her daughter as well; Liu Dongtian’s wife, who achieved liberation, and her daughter too. Those who refine the true and cultivate the primordial refine grain into essence, essence into blood, blood into marrow, marrow into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into the Dao, and this single-minded Dao into sagehood. Without inner cultivation and outer steadfastness, how could the women of old have achieved feathered transformation and ascension as they did?\n\nAmong the jade halls of the Heavenly Emperor stand immortal maidens: the celestial matrons of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the moon maidens of Guanghan, the cloud consorts of Penglai, the consorts who govern the peaks of the Great Cavern Heavens, the aged attendants who tend incense in the Miao Brahma Heaven—such as the Old Crone of Mount Li, the Xiao and Wang clans of Qingcheng, the Tong clan of the imperial house, the Ge clan of Huotong, the Hu, Li, and Yu clans of Wuyi, and He Xiangu among them. It is also told that in the Qin era there was Mao the Maiden, in the Han era Li the Maiden, and in the realms of Wu Mountain and Dongting Lake, divine maidens dwelled. Even Zhuangzi spoke of the maiden of Mount Miao Gu Ye in such form. Were such forms, such immortals, real or not? Many waver between doubt and belief. Yet the records of past and present, the accounts in ancient texts—surely female immortals exist.\n\nIf immortality can be learned, then why doubt that one may achieve the Dao? Once one reverses aging to return to infancy, one must be able to reverse yang and renew the bones; once one can preserve form and remain in the world, one must be able to transform and ascend in flight. With the heart of an immortal, believe in the affairs of immortals; study the Dao of immortals, and realize the fruits of immortality. Learning to be an immortal is not difficult—what is truly hard is transcending the dust and forsaking desire. Since the Dao of immortals, of long life and enduring vision, can be learned, then transcending the dust and forsaking desire—how could that be difficult?\n\nLiu Miaoqing, having devoted herself thus, must surely be within reach. If the girl who played the flute could ride the phoenix, if the girl who picked mulberry leaves could mount the crane, then I nod in approval of her resolve and take up my brush to write what can be said.\n\n**Three Quatrains Inscribed on the Wall of Thorn Concealment**\n\nMoss lies dead in green coins,\nThe pine, dead, grows thin in its shade.",

thousandfold deep.\n\nI, too, come and go by chance—\nOne night of pattering rain on the river.\n\nThe Wind God rages, filling the sky with snow,\nBefore Heaven’s Pillar Peak, willow catkins fly.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on Master Dan Shu’s Thatched Hut**\n\nA few jagged peaks like carved jade,\nA stream of autumn water born in cold green.\nFortunate to find a thatch where white clouds probe,\nAnd moonlit bamboo before the altar.\n\nClearing brambles, felling bamboo to build a lotus hut,\nThe mountains and waters here are ready for woodcutting and fishing.\nDwelling in the hills as fate allows,\nGathering *mani* wish-fulfilling pearls.\n\nThe thatched-hut Daoist is poor to the bone,\nHis hut empty, free, and spare.\nWithin him lies a treasure—he seeks no one,\nIts price too great to bear, so he keeps it hidden.\n\nMorning and evening, he settles body and mind,\nMountains bloom on their own, birds sing of their own accord.\nHe has yet to see mulberry fields turn to sea,\nHow many times has the evening sun locked the level woods?\n\nLiving in this thatched hut, no other defense—\nAll day, he sits in stillness, absorbed and vacant.\nHe is no immortal of the Ten Isles or Three Mountains,\nNor any buddha of the Ten Directions or Three Times.\n\nJust a carefree, unburdened man,\nHis hut cradling a pot of spring.\nBefore the window, the moon’s thousand-year shadow;\nUpon his pillow, the clear wind’s ten-thousand-kalpa voice.\n\nWho is the master of this hut?\nFrom ancient times to now, he claims this land of leisure.\nSuddenly, he washes his face and feels his nose—\nNo eating, no drinking, no sleeping.\n\nThe hut stands empty, the man gone, mist curling,\nA white crane calls to the clouds, filling the azure sky.\nWith one glimpse of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s face,\nEverywhere a hut—everywhere the same.\n\nThis thatched hut, small and smaller still,\nIs but a pore in the vast emptiness.\nAt its peak, not a blade of thatch hangs—\nThe ten thousand forms array themselves as its constellations.\n\nThough kalpa-fire burns all to the last atom,\nThis hut remains unscathed, its dweller unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**For Zhao Daxu’s Painting of Bamboo and Stone**\n\nThe bamboo’s soul, the bamboo’s spirit,\nFallen to Xiao and Xiang, the Qi’s banks.\nA thousand stalks, ten thousand stalks vie in verdant splendor,\nDrinking wind, sipping dew for a thousand springs.\n\nThe master’s brush-tip moves like wind and rain,\nStartling the bamboo’s soul—nowhere to alight.\nA drop of ink transforms into a dragon,\nThe dragon’s offspring fly to E Creek to dwell.\n\nThe master wields his brush without hesitation,\nCreation dares not hoard spring for itself.\nNew shoots, sturdy joints, a forest of cold jade—\nWhere can phoenix and simurgh perch their dream-souls?\n\nThe Jin immortals like Sun Ju—\nTheir bamboo paintings often summoned heaven’s rain.\nThe Tang immortals like Zhang Zhen—\nTheir bamboo paintings often heard wild geese cry.\n\nThe master’s hand has entered the divine—\nOne stalk, two stalks spring from his wine.\nDrunk, he called for his ink-slave,\nOne stroke swept out a thousand *mu* of bamboo.\n\nHow could wine’s power usurp Creation’s work?\nThe master has refined his cinnabar elixir to crimson.\nA grain of yang-light illumines his lungs and viscera,\nThe ten thousand forms arrayed within his breast.\n\nSometimes he holds forth a leaf of wind-bamboo—\nThe Silver Sea grows warm, all tremble in awe.\nSometimes he holds forth a branch from the snow—\nAs if frozen jade scorns the rippling waves.\n\nHe can also moisten his brush to shape stone,\nNaturally steep and strange, ancient and rugged.\nTigers crouching in sand, rhinos in grass—\nHe bids men take them to Penglai to sell.\n\nBamboo’s purity, stone’s hardness—\nThrough these, he reveals true nature and life.\nLet men gaze upon stone and love bamboo,\nKnowing there is a true Zhao Yuanjing.\n\nWhen the master is drunk, he is often wind-mad,\nThe world’s eyes hold no immortals.\nI now treasure several of his paintings—\nWhen the cloud-crane comes, you will ascend to heaven.\n\n---\n\n**For a Painter of Fish**\n\nLong ago, the monk Xian painted fish,\nThirty-six scales clinging to emerald reeds.\nShen Xun’s paintings often featured fish,\nTheir fins flaring, manes waving—now captured in art.\n\nThe ancients’ wondrous paintings still endure,\nThe moderns’ marvels were unknown in ancient times.\nGuo Danqing stands peerless across the ages,\nThe world’s foremost painter of fish.\n\nAt the height of his skill, hand answers heart,\nHis mind’s craft surpasses cunning, his wit runs deep.\nOn the paper, a limpid stream flows,\nReleasing two or three iron bream.\n\nGolden scales, brocade manes, crimson jade topknots,\nThey circle and glide, playing in the waves.\nTiny fish, needle-like, swim in formation,\nLeaping to sip water, toying with duckweed.\n\nTossing heads, flicking tails in floating-sinking motion,\nNow clustering, now scattering in their leaps.\nHis brush divides light and dark, counting ten thousand scales,\nEtching whiskers, dotting eyes, evening the ink’s traces.\n\nAs if casting a ruler to measure rippling silk,\nOr threading a shuttle through water’s patterns.\nVividly, mandarin fish nest in green algae,\nThe fisherman has yet to cast his line—already he blows his fire.\n\nOn the wall, fish leap, yet the water does not flow,\nA child squints, tapping his needle-hook.",

waves steep the talisman, cold isles grow limpid.\n\nI fear that on some storm-lit night,\nThey may transform and soar as dragons through Yu’s Gate.\n\n**For Guo Chengwu’s Reed-Waisted Geese**\nAmong painters, Guo Xi stood supreme,\nAnd though he’s gone, his name remains unbroken.\nHis descendant, Guo Wanli, now appears,\nHis heart brimming with boundless ink and hues.\n\nFor whom did he craft this *Reeds and Wild Geese*?\nFor Yuwen Huan of the Southern Studio, its splendor unmatched.\nMisty waters, rustling reeds in the wind’s grasp,\nBy the sands, geese and crows call at dusk.\n\nThis is the autumn scene of Xiao Xiang and Dongting—\nWho in the world knows if such a painting exists?\nIllusion conjures three or four crows on a tower,\nEight or nine reeds stretch across ancient shoals.\n\nHesitant to roost, their cries ring clear,\nAs fishing boats moor by the shore, mountain mists darken.\nAutumn winds strip the wutong leaves to gold,\nMigrating geese return again to Hengyang.\n\nWriting characters across the void, none can decipher,\nTheir shadows glide past, sinking into the deep.\nEvening glow dips into the river, a village at dusk,\nA few wheel and circle back to ancient waves.\n\nNecks stretched, beaks raised, they peck at lotus blooms,\nThen soar beyond the western watchtower’s edge.\nCold clouds, pale moon—autumn at Xisai,\nA few plaintive cries stir melancholy.\n\nBy the bank, they fly with falling maple leaves,\nGathering in flocks to visit the sandpipers.\nSuch scenes, such sentiments—\nFor you, painting them is no difficult task.\n\nA few sheets of *Exi* silk, cold as ice and snow,\nYet in an instant, you sweep out a market of reeds and geese.\nThough many in the world study painting,\nFew can compare to your skill.\n\nI long to store these in a bamboo basket,\nWhere crisp autumn chill would fill its depths.\nBut I fear your paintings may go unseen—\nWho among those who hear of them would dare compete?\n\nHang them in a quiet chamber’s plain white walls,\nAnd one would gaze upon them a hundred times a day.\n\n**Pure Void Hall’s Ode to Snow**\nThe vast sky darkens, day turns to night,\nFierce winds tear clouds into shreds below.\nCold gibbons cling to trees, too afraid to cry,\nPlum blossoms shy from blooming, fearing frost’s swift blow.\n\nCountless mountains drown in fallen leaves’ sorrow,\nEverywhere, frozen mist clings to thatched eaves.\nWithered and stiff, life seems beyond revival,\nAs if the Spring Decree were barred by Feilian’s might.\n\nHungry tigers call their cubs to rocky dens,\nBirds dart like shuttles through the leafless grove.\nGardens and groves stand desolate, stripped bare,\nAfter nights of frost’s relentless, wanton force.\n\nThreatening rain, yet only sleet descends,\nThe sky’s deceit weighs heavy in the air.\nWillow fluff takes flight like a chariot’s wheels,\nFrozen for days, refusing to melt away.\n\nBefore my eyes, a jade-white tower appears,\nYet I dare not ascend, left only to sigh.\nGoosebumps rise, my nose runs cold,\nWhile in the village, fresh wine’s price soars high.\n\nBy the stream, fishermen laugh as they haul their nets,\nUnknowing that the hooks bear musk’s scent.\nThey wash the pot, stoke the fire, brew snow tea,\nLower the blinds, cross their legs, and speak of purity.\n\nThey call a boy to shatter the inkstone’s ice,\nWarm their hands, form a circle, and found a poetry club.\nThe poem captures this scene—yet still it falls short,\nHow I wish Wang Wei could paint it true!\n\n**Pure Yang Assembly**\nA breath of warm wind dances through green locusts,\nZhurong’s fire rolls in from the south.\nCrabapples scatter, bees and butterflies depart,\nThe pondside pavilion stands empty, lotuses yet unopened.\n\nA single handful of pure harmony’s essence,\nThe pure Yang has already turned to mare’s form.\nThe mountains and rivers gather this heroic qi,\nSealing it suddenly in a gourd.\n\nBefore the steps, fourteen pods of *jiaomu* grow,\nThe censor dreams of qilin at night.\nThe old immortal, robed in carelessness, laughs from his nose,\nHis celestial spring yet unborn in the womb.\n\nLü Dongbin’s cleverness turns to clumsiness,\nOn Penglai’s path, only the bright moon remains.\nPlum blossoms cling to the wall, wax drips from branches,\nBy the pond, pomegranate flowers bleed within their leaves.\n\nBorn with an unyielding spirit,\nHis nature and passions exhaust the heavens’ truth.\nSuddenly, he grasps the mechanism of lead and mercury,\nDaring to say the great Dao knows no Chu or Qin.\n\nIn an instant, the golden elixir completes nine cycles,\nThe ten-month gestation ripens—yet none inquire.\nIt shakes heaven and earth, startles ghosts and gods,\nOnly the blue clouds and white cranes find solace.\n\nLater ages long for the true man,\nEver celebrating his birth.\nOn the day the cherry kitchens open,\nEven Buddhists wish to craft wax figures.\n\nWho first began this custom?\nTruly, it began in Qiaoling during the Five Dynasties.\nWang Shen held gatherings, donning the scholar’s cap,\nWhite cranes flew in, uncounted.\n\nNext, the Xiao family built their immortal abode,\nIn the Seven Min lands, ten thousand households birthed auspicious mist.\nOne prefecture, then two, gradually embraced the custom,\nSwiftly they came to know Dongbin’s worth.\n\nHow many times did they traverse the city’s north and south?\nYet none knew the old man had returned.\nThey only saw an ancient pine speak in human tongue,\nAsking, \"To whose house does the master carry his ink?\"\n\nWithin Taiping Temple, he composed a poem,\nThen scoffed at those who polished mirrors, calling them fools.\nIn Yueyang’s marketplace, he let out a long whistle,\nThe iron flute fell silent—how long has it been?\n\nThere was a man, a son of the Pan family,\nContent with his lot, his heart filled with joy.\nFrom his extravagant years of devotion to this day,\nPilgrims from the four seas swarm like ants.\n\nAmid the throng, a jade toad appears,\nUnashamed of tattered robes or humble garb.\nHe inscribed a poem to urge steadfastness like metal and stone,\nMorning incense and evening candles heighten reverence.\n\nThe wondrous Elder Miaotong clapped in secret,\nWondering when he might dream of such radiance.\nWaiting for him to rise like Yi, towering and bold,\nHe would arrange the robes and alms bowl—blessings boundless.\n\nFive hundred white cranes call to the blue clouds,\nIn their depths, jade plums bloom anew.\nIf one asks of the matter of ascending to immortality,\nSimply gaze upon the sun and moon at heaven’s edge.\n\n**For Xie Zhitang of the Western City**\nOn Penglai’s peak, a divine immortal,\nHis Daoist bearing tall and straight as a pine.\nEyes gleaming, blacker than lacquer,\nCheeks faintly flushed like peach blossoms.\n\nAt times, he throws back his head and laughs,\nGathering Kunlun in his right hand.\nSuddenly, he tumbles from the empty void,\nUnknowing that his belly holds the stars.\n\nAt times, he startles an old dragon into roaring,\nIn one breath, he drains the Canglang’s waves.\nShattering the primordial chaos, he extracts its bones,\nPlucking a mustard seed to contain mountains and rivers.\n\nIn the crescent moon’s furnace, he boils heaven and earth,\nRefining the sun’s soul and the moon’s marrow.\nLaughing, he wields his gourd to bind ghosts and gods,\nHis staff hoisting mountains and waters alike.",

astonishment,\nBeneath the rootless tree, he rides an iron horse.\n\nWhen skill reaches its peak, play becomes profound,\nTossing and shaping creation like a child at play.\nSomersaulting on the tiger’s tongue,\nHe laughs at Vajra learning to paint eyebrows.\n\nNüwa seeks to mend the western heavens’ flaw,\nYet her smelted stones fail to amuse Fuxi.\nQin Shi Huang carved mountains to link the four seas,\nThe Han Emperor’s grasp elicits but a long laugh.\n\nThe master wields his bottomless basket,\nMoving from being to non-being with ease.\nClutching this Dao-guard, he surveys the four seas—\nDongbin now seeks a fellow practitioner.\n\nIn cups, cotton swells and scatters,\nFish swim in fire, while water holds obstructions.\nAt Yellow Crane Tower, deep in drunkenness,\nHe widens his eyes to show Zhongli.\n\nStirring a basin to scatter five-colored sands,\nHe writes dragons and serpents across the earth.\nWith a single cup left as parting wine,\nDare he transform it to tea before others’ eyes?\n\nBehind the bamboo fence lies a single path,\nPiercing the azure clouds beyond.\nAt the crossroads, he spreads his mat,\nWith a flip of his hand, clouds and rain arise.\n\nNowadays, none in the world can match him,\nFor his Dao-guardian’s skill is truly divine.\nHow many springs has he wandered rivers and lakes,\nBecoming one with the cloud-and-water life?\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Month Reflections**\n\nOn Fangying Mountain, the wind howls,\nWhere the fifth and sixth months feel like autumn.\nPine blossoms fall as cranes take flight,\nEndless white clouds drift over emerald peaks.\n\nMidnight’s toad descends into the cinnabar well,\nJade forests locked in twilight’s cold mist.\nDew blankets the sky, dotting the moss,\nFrog markets disperse, and all sounds fade.\n\nThree or two trees where gibbons cry,\nTheir branches home to sleepless birds.\nA few fireflies linger on sandy paths,\nWhile mountain streams weep with cold springs.\n\nThe bell’s toll severs the path to dreams,\nUnknowing where butterflies now flutter.\nRubbing my eyes, I fold paper streamers—\nToday is the fifth day of the fifth month.\n\nMorning rain clears, plums grow plump,\nYoung dragons shed their shells as new phoenixes soar.\nMy mountain dwelling holds nothing,\nYet ginger and wheat suffice for the morning meal.\n\nI recall the fourth day of the fifth month in years past,\nWearing a kudzu hat and feather fan at Luán Creek’s market.\nDragon boats split the waves with a thousand oars,\nDrums shook the heavens as banners cleaved the water.\n\nPaper money flew at Qu Yuan’s shrine,\nCrowds moved like swarming ants.\nPaulownia blossoms adorned temples, colored threads bound arms,\nEvery household warded off plague with peach branches.\n\nBefore the hall, green mugwort shaped green tigers,\nFinely chopped calamus steeped in green vinegar.\nSucculent goose and carp graced the feast,\nGlutinous rice wrapped in leaves, steeped in water.\n\nThis year, solitude in these

winding bays.\nAutumn rain at the stream’s head deepens the chill green,\nA jade pot where dragons play.\n\nDream-flowers along the brocade shore, red as flowing blood,\nRice fields rise and fall like a game of *sai*.\nEmerald cliffs soar halfway to the azure sky,\nBirds dare not fly, tucking their feet in fear.\n\nAn ancient grotto, empty, with stone wine presses,\nSheer cliffs house immortal granaries, heaped with celestial grain.\nThe old pine’s gesture still draws gasps,\nAs gods and ghosts carve paths through valleys.\n\nThe sound of pounding medicine dries the air—man already ascended,\nA ten-thousand-foot cinnabar well, a single spring’s gleam.\nWind strikes ancient pines, their jade canopies soar,\nSunlight forges green coins on moss.\n\nVines and creepers drag trees through wispy mist,\nSince the yellow crane’s departure, how many years have passed?\nThe sky leans toward dusk, cicadas cry in vain,\nThe mountain moon turns full toward man at night.\n\nA desolate temple’s old halls hold a few oaks,\nA lone monk gone, the brushwood gate left ajar.\nIron statues face the wall, silent and still,\nBefore the ancient hall, a cold brazier stands.\n\nCrows alight on the eaves, dripping water,\nEvening clouds and withered grass make the mountains seem gaunt.\nThe quilt is thin, warmth flees, sleep eludes,\nTiger roars and gibbon cries fill the ear.\n\nA few sparse stars fall on the parasol tree,\nCinnabar peaks and purple ravines vie in height.\n\n---\n\n**Journey to Yan Rock**\n\nWhen shall I wander carefree on a green ox,\nDawn’s dew glistening at White Jade

      "translated_text": "**Poetic Madness and Dream-Drinking with the Flower Spirit**\n\nDrunk with poetry, I dreamt of drinking with the Flower Spirit;\nWine-sodden, I would not sleep with the Flower Spirit.\nAs the wine ebbed, I recalled Dongyuan—\nThough the flowers and trees remain, my heart aches for the man.\nThis poem was never meant for flowers,\nYet I grieve for Dongyuan in these hills and vales.\nNow, when I admire flowers, I see no one—\nOnly bees and butterflies flitting through the idle pavilion.\n\n*Perfect Realization: The Upper Clarity Collection, Scroll Thirty-Eight Concludes*\n*Perfect Realization: The Upper Clarity Collection, Scroll Thirty-Nine*\n*By Bai Yuchan of Hainan*\n\n**Two Songs of Cloud-Wandering**\n\nCloud-wandering is hard, oh so hard,\nTen thousand miles of misty waters, the four seas so wide.\nSpeak of such bitterness, and who would not weep?\nFirst parting from home, leaving kin behind,\nThree hundred coins jingling at my waist.\nI pondered, sought, and found the Way so arduous—\nTonight, where shall I rest my head?\n\nUnknowing, I walked two or three stages,\nAnd was told this place was Zhangcheng.\nMy robes sold off, my clothes all pawned,\nYet not a soul did I meet upon the road.\nArriving at a riverside village, I lodged in a lonely inn—\nCrows cawed, flowers fell, a thousand groves at dusk.\nAt dawn, I rose again to walk the road,\nWith naught but a single umbrella in hand.\n\nGradually, I drew near to Xinghua Prefecture,\nWhere wind and rain whispered of spring’s departure.\nAll I had left was this bare, emaciated frame,\nAnd a few coins still tucked in my pouch.\nMy steps grew heavy, my feet weak,\nMy body wracked with itching, lice crawling everywhere.\nStripped bare, I stood at last,\nLonging to return home—yet home was beyond reach.\nHow could I endure ten days of gnawing hunger?\nHiding my name, concealing my face—who would know me?\n\nI came to Xingfu Temple in Luoyuan,\nAnd there became a servant.\nNot half a month had passed before I parted ways with the abbot.\nFire-clouds soared above Zhiti Peak,\nThe road’s stones scorching like embers.\nThe blazing sun seared the sky,\nAnd my bare feet could not bear the burning path.\nA mound of flesh, sweat streaming down—\nNot even a fan to stir the wind.\n\nFortunately, the triple heat of summer passed,\nAnd my steps led me once more to Jianpu.\nTruly, I was poor to the bone, to the marrow—\nA night in the wilds, rain pattering on the parasol trees.\nAt dusk, I looked around, tears streaming,\nNo hat, no raincoat—how could I not despair?\nI huddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,\nBut the village elder would not let me stay.\n\nHearing that the people of Jianning were kind,\nI came seeking food and clothing.\nYet all I heard were whispers of shame—\nWho would meet me with eyes of mercy?\nI recalled my days of wealth and ease,\nAnd now, head bowed, I knit my brows in sorrow.\nHouse after house, I stretched out my hand—\nNot one soul pitied this beggar.\n\nFrom Fujian, I made my way to Longhu,\nTo the Upper Clarity Palace, to seek an audience with the master.\nBefore we met, I begged for shelter,\nBut the temple keeper scorned my tattered robes.\nIt was just like my first arrival at Wuyi,\nWhere the yellow-capped Daoists berated me.\nA bowl of stale rice, a ladle of cold water—\nThey called me a wretch, a disgrace to their kind.\n\nEast and west of the river, north and south of the lake,\nZhejiang’s borders touching the western reaches of Shu,\nGuangdong, Fujian, Huai, and the seas—tens of thousands of miles,\nA thousand mountains, ten thousand waters, all in vain.\nYears passed in cloud-wandering,\nAnd my fellow Daoists laughed at my folly.\nI revisited old haunts, came and went again—\nGreat matters slip by, yet I do not blame Heaven.\n\nIf I truly have the destiny of an immortal,\nThere must be someone to guide me.\nNow, my training has reached its peak,\nAnd not a trace of vexation lingers in my breast.\n\nI remember the flames of war rising in Huaixi,\nFrozen corpses stretching for miles.\nFortune granted me a thread of life,\nYet hunger and thirst brought me to the brink of despair.\nI remember the snow in Wulin,\nMy clothes in tatters, the wind piercing my bones.\nThough my essence and qi remained whole,\nStill, my skin split from the cold.\n\nI recall an ancient temple in wind and rain,\nNo fire in the incense burner, paper money scattering in the gale.\nGhosts wailed, spirits howled, the sky grew grim,\nDew dripped, clouds thinned, and apes cried through the night.\nI think of straw sandals on frost-hardened ground,\nMoonlight on green moss, fallen leaves turning yellow.\nNot a moment of true ease—\nHow could I endure such bitter cold?\n\nThen, one day, Heaven opened its eyes,\nAnd Master Chen Niyuan saw my laziness.\nOn the Mid-Autumn of the *guiyou* year, beneath a clear sky,\nI sat alone in the pine’s shade, speaking of this and that.\nIt turned out the true gold was at home all along—\nMy past toil had been in vain.\nI recalled the *Long Life, Preserve the Life-Spark* formula,\nAnd built a thatched hut to sit in stillness amid the deep clouds.\n\nRefining the golden elixir is easy—\nWhether in the mountains or the marketplace.\nI write these *Songs of Cloud-Wandering* in passing,\nLest others fail to grasp their meaning.\n\n**Again**\n\nI recall a night of rain on Dongting,\nNo raincoat, no hat—\nHuddled beneath an eave, waiting for dawn,\nBut the village elder would not let me stay.\n\nI recall seven days of snow in Wulin,\nMy clothes torn and tattered—\nHad I not been Bai Yuchan,\nHe would have frozen till his skin split and blood flowed,\nFor the cold pierced to the bone.\n\nI recall the summer heat east of the river,\nThe road’s stones burning like fire—\nWhere could I rest?\nNo fan to stir the wind,\nBarefoot, I could not bear the path.\n\nI recall an autumn moonlit night on Qingcheng,\nAlone beneath the pines,\nA *bu xu* hymn sung—\nMouth and heart conversing,\nCold mist veiling all, the world hushed.\nOnly then did I truly arrive at the mountain.\n\nI recall a gentle breeze on Xiaoxiang,\nTurning my *Huaxu* dream,\nThe sun crimson at the mountain’s edge,\nA crow’s cry—\nThe cry faded, leaving no trace,\nSuch fleeting joy—with whom could I share it?\n\nI recall the troops rising in Huaixi,\nRows of bleached bones stretching for miles,\nHungry, yet no food,\nThirsty, yet no water.\n\nI recall a year in a village,\nPlague raging,\nPeople came begging for talismanic water,\nYet I had nowhere to turn.\nThe divine generals manifested,\nSeizing ghosts and spirits at will.\n\nI recall walking beneath the northern mountains,\nAncient graves overgrown with autumn grass,\nPaper money still damp from the rain,\nWhite poplars sighing in the wind,\nA desolate terrace bathed in moonlight,\nGhosts and spirits weeping all night—\nSaved only by a scroll of scripture to deliver the dead.",

thing’s root and stem are essence and qi,\nessence and qi that may fill the body.\nYet how could I know this essence, this spirit, this qi\noriginated before father and mother conceived me?\nThe three never once parted,\nknotted into one boundless mass.\n\nMan’s birth and death are but empty illusion—\nthis thing remains serene, untouched.\nI turned inward to ponder,\nand the elder’s words rang true.\nThis must be the beloved practice he revealed,\nhis discourse unfolding its meaning.\n\nOn the Mid-Autumn night of Kai Xi’s first year,\nincense burned, I knelt to receive the oral transmission.\nAfter three days of practice,\nheaven and earth, sun and moon softened like silk.\nSuddenly, I bit through empty space and shattered it—\nonly then did I grasp that Zhong and Lü had plumbed the mystery.\n\nHad I devoted myself in youth,\nI would not still be mired in dust.\nI think of the eight hundred and three thousand,\ncloud-cranes descending in graceful pairs.\n\n**Song of Contentment**\nDo you know what the immortals’ work entails?\nIf you knew, you would not seek so carelessly.\nFirst turn inward and measure yourself—\nonly speak when your heart is free of deceit.\n\nThe immortals guard their arts, not out of secrecy,\nbut because few possess the karmic roots.\nWere it so easy for all to attain,\nwould the celestial mechanism be so lightly shared?\n\nTo study the Dao or seek immortality, fix your will,\nhold fast to one resolve without doubt.\nSteady your heart from beginning to end—\nas gold is tested by fire, so too is the Way.\n\nYour mind is thick with brambles,\ngood roots sprout only to become demons.\nIf you first align with the immortals’ intent,\nyour portion is set—what more can be done?\n\nA clouded mind breeds wicked words and deeds,\nand every act becomes a mistake.\nSeek nothing from others, desire nothing for yourself—\nbetter to have never begun at all.\n\nReflect on this truth,\nand let your heart rest firm.\nLook at those who’ve attained through the ages—\ntheir minds were never thus.\n\nI long to meet a true seeker,\nyet when I do, their hearts shift like shadows.\nWhy speak of transmission as easy or hard?\nIt is the gate of mystery that remains untested.\n\nAsk yourself why you do not reflect—\nleave your fate to the vault of heaven.\nSimply tend your heart and follow your nature,\nfor musk’s fragrance needs no proclamation.\n\nThe Jade Toad was once a mountain hermit,\nyet a kindred spirit is hard to find.\nNow, while my straw sandals are still sturdy,\nmy face flushes like peach blossoms, my eyes dark and clear.\n\nJade Toad, why do you still scheme?\nBetter to brush your sleeves and depart.\nIf there were a place to save others,\nZhong and Lü would already be flaunting their prowess.\n\nNo one knows—\nI go alone,\nwhite clouds stretch a thousand miles, unturning.\nI return to guard my three-legged cauldron,\nsimmering the bright wind and clear moon.\n\n**Tea Song**\nWillow eyes steal glances at flying plum blossoms,\na hundred flowers bow to the east wind’s breath.\nSpring arrives in the valley’s source unnoticed,\nuntil a thunderclap startles the dawn branches.\n\nThe branches dare not unfurl their banners,\nfirst offering jade and gold in marvelous display.\nSparrow-tongue buds hold spring but cannot speak—\nonly the morning dew and mist understand.\n\nPlucked with dew and mist, they are taken home,\nsteamed, then pounded thousands of times.\nShaped into three hundred moon-round cakes,\nfire’s art tempered with both civil and martial skill.\n\nAt the mill’s edge, jade dust swirls like flying catkins,\npearls scatter from the grindstone like golden threads.\nA small cauldron of Shou Shan bronze,\nfresh spring water boiled over a lively flame.\n\nCrab-eye bubbles vanish, fish-eyes rise,\nthe wind and rain whisper through scraping pine.\nA flowered bowl of Dingzhou red jade,\nbrimming with auspicious snow and floating white foam.\n\nGreen clouds enter the mouth, birthing fragrant winds,\na boundless orchid and angelica perfume.\nCool breezes rise beneath the arms, pores open—\nall worldly cares washed from the withered gut.\n\nHave you not seen\nMeng the Remonstrator,\nwhose tea startled Lu Tong from sleep?\nOr Bai Juyi,\nwhose gift of tea roused Ma Xi from drunkenness?\n\nLu Yu wrote the *Classic of Tea*,\nCao Hui composed the *Inscription of Tea*.\nMinister Fan, the upright, smiled over tea,\nhis gauze hat askew as he brewed stone sprouts.\n\nSu Xu saw rain like cinnabar,\ndotting each cup with calamus blossoms.\nSu Dongpo mastered the art of boiling water,\noften seeking a sip after wine’s end.\n\nZhao Zhou dreamed of meeting Nanquan,\nlovingly kindling incense to steep tea’s green.\nWe brew tea with savor,\nfirst blending it with the divine water of Hua Chi.\n\nA plot in the cinnabar field, self-cultivated,\ngolden lads and maidens gather the harvest.\nHeavenly furnace and earthen tripod follow the seasons,\nrefining yellow sprouts, boiling white snow.\n\nIts taste like sweet dew, finer than aged wine,\ndrinking it, one feels lingering illness vanish.\nThe body lightens, ready to ascend the celestial road—\nwho knows if heaven has tea?\n\n**Song of the Great Dao**\nCrow flies gold, hare runs jade,\nthe three realms a single grain of millet,\nmountains and rivers, the great earth—how many years of dust?\nYin and yang inverted, plunging into the mysterious valley.\n\nMan’s life flickers like stone sparks and lightning,\na few guest magpies lodging in the branches.\nSang fields and blue seas shift through spring and

the world\ntransform their hearts to purity and elegance.\n\nUnread in alchemical classics, they yearn for ascension,\npointing at shadows, prattling of emptiness to deceive and frighten.\nSometimes they gallop with their three-inch tongues,\nor feign muteness on the street corners.\n\nAmid the upright, beware of the crooked;\nwithin the true, discern the false.\nIf you are a person of clarity

Though gulls shunned mandarin ducks, how could he ignore the people’s desperate gaze?\n\nI hear that in his youth, he was not so indolent—whipping his heart with yellow silk, binding his hair in a green robe, gazing at mirrors for glory, and wielding his pen like a blade. He moved with grace within the bounds of Zhou and Kong, soaring beyond Han and Liu. The common folk then pointed and stared, hoping this \"lazy\" one would take Yu or Gao as his model.\n\nWhy, then, did he grow lazy? Before his rank was revealed, his ambition for office was already sated. The scholarly groves grew thin as mist, the sea of learning chilled as waves—how could he not disappoint the hopes of his gowned peers?\n\nSince the Jia Tai era, when he retired to Junyang, then served as the Marquis of Hengyang, and later sought reclusion in Wuyi, the Lazy Old Man had no heart for office, his official passions fading like autumn. Among the gentry, none could sway him with flattery, so he coiled like a dragon, refusing to bring rain.\n\nNow past the age of following his heart, he is even lazier than before, content to idle away his days amid clouds and waters. He has a floating home in Jinhua, the former residence of his late father, the Minister. Before the hall, a space of over a zhang was roofed with eight or nine beams. Three sides were fitted with windows, barely enough to kneel in. Planks replaced bricks, lime smoothed the walls. He kept a single flower, stood a zither of green paulownia, and hung a three-foot sword of Wenyan green jade.\n\nWhen the Old Man wished to sleep, he transformed into a butterfly, flying to the Land of Hua Xu. When he wished to drink, he stretched his neck like a jade rainbow, draining the sea of wine in one gulp. When he wished to chant, jade trees stirred in the wind, scattering pearls and gems upon the page. When he wished to play chess, the stars scattered in disarray, the sound of carved jade chilling the air. When he wished to dance, the Valley Spirit shifted the jade mountain, his flying sword pointing to the azure sky. When he wished to roam in joy, he dragged his seven-foot staff, letting out a long whistle among the pines. When he wished to sing wildly, a single note from his iron flute summoned the dragon of Jade Abyss.\n\nIf streams and mountains gained fame without harming grass or trees, the Old Man wrote poems in kind. If flower spirits wandered lost and moon souls failed to return, he drowned them in wine. He was lazy only in worldly affairs, for in these, his laziness knew no laziness.\n\nAt leisure, he played chess; in high spirits, he drank; when elated, he sang; when drunk, he slept. Life was his to command, his will his own. He entrusted each matter to its proper place, his heart free of care, his mind free of affairs—this was the Old Man’s laziness.\n\nTo sit in oblivion like Xi Yan, to lose his reflection like Qi, to merge with the void, to transform with all things, to reach the point of forgetting sleep and food—this was true laziness.\n\nThe Old Man’s heart, sovereign of his palace, gazed with cold eyes upon the red and purple of the world, like a cuckoo scolding swans and geese, or thorns mocking the finest timber.\n\nIn his studio, he followed only his lazy whims. Rain provided ink-water, bamboo supplied winds to sweep his couch, clouds unfurled as curtains to veil the mountains, and grass served as a mat upon the rocks. By day, green serpents coiled from the incense burner; by night, silver lamps floated like red millet. He drank wine and swallowed wind and moon, chanted poems and bit clouds and water, hewed bamboo to fell spring winds, and moved flowers to uproot the dawn moon—these were things even his laziness could not neglect.\n\nA guest from Wuyi, seeing how lazy he had become, visited the Lazy Old Man’s studio and, drunk with inspiration, wrote with unbridled ink. He asked the Lazy Old Man:\n\n*\"The east wind parts the willow’s eyes,\nThe golden crow scolds the peach blossoms.\nSpring dwells within your studio—\nWhy seek joy beyond the fields?\"*\n\nWas the Old Man too lazy to tread the green at this time?\n\n*\"The rain passes through the secluded pavilion,\nA bright moon over a pond of lotuses.\nA fragrant breeze rises from the brush—\nThis heart knows no heat.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to enter the grove then?\n\n*\"Fallen leaves follow the lone crow,\nCalling frost to test the cold.\nAutumn’s light fills heaven and earth,\nAll things at ease and free.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to climb heights at that moment?\n\n*\"Water soaks the shadow of plum blossoms,\nA gibbon’s cry through a frosted tree.\nTaro embers warm the earthen stove,\nTea brewed from melted snow.\"*\n\nWas he too lazy to seek the plum blossoms then?\n\nThe Old Man replied: *\"Indeed.\"*\n\nAlas! Dust stings the eyes, fame and profit burn the heart—how could one suddenly become as lazy as the Old Man? His zither gathered dust for days, his inkstone dried without water—all due to his laziness. He shut the door to the clear wind, left the moon to wait for his couch—his laziness knew no bounds.\n\nThe Lazy Old Man’s abode could shelter from wind and rain, his fields could provide gruel, his son could inherit his robe and bowl. He mingled not with the vulgar, spoke not to others, his body as light as a feather—truly an old Chan master in life.\n\nUpon meeting White Jade Toad of Wuyi, he delighted in their endless conversation. Jade Toad, overjoyed, composed this ode to his studio.\n\nThis occurred on the fifteenth day of early summer in the Jia Ding Bing Zi year. Attended by Mao Ying Xuan, Tao Hong, and others.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the Treatment of Abscesses and Fistulas**\n\nGoose fat and phoenix eggs heal carbuncles and boils—this is the art of Bian Que. Unicorn wax and tortoise toes cure abscesses and fistulas—this is the learning of Yu Pi. If the method is not esteemed, the medicine is not deemed cheap; if the learning is not mastered, people deem it wondrous. When the wondrous is deemed unattainable by learning, the method becomes precious, and the medicine no longer inexpensive—all the work of Yu Cun and Bian Que.\n\nThe Daoist of Wuyi, Huang Jichang, in his youth roamed the wilds of Chonggang, where he once encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the remedies for abscesses and fistulas. He guarded the formula closely, sealing it in his arm pouch, never to be shown to others. Yet observing the man himself—his spirit soaring and untrammeled—one could well believe in his encounters.\n\nThe human body is a vessel of flowing qi; should it harbor stagnation, pus and clotted blood congeal, spreading and thickening, until one cries out in pain, unable to endure. Some suffer from the wasting of blood in fistulas, others from the seepage of internal decay, soaking their clothes and corroding their flesh—who would desire such afflictions? Of the four hundred and four diseases, none wrings the heart like abscesses and fistulas.\n\nHuang Jichang is a man in the lineage of Yu Pi and Bian Que. The medicines he employs are goose fat, phoenix eggs, unicorn wax, and tortoise toes. One day, when I visited his Cloud Nest, he spoke of his learning, his remedies, and the countless patients he had treated. It seemed he wished for me to compose a piece in praise. Alas! Musk does not rely on wind to diffuse its fragrance, nor pearls on oysters to gleam—why must I wield my brush to amuse him?\n\nSince I know his skill, I told him this: Sun Simiao said, *\"At first, an abscess is a fleshy knot; once formed, it is a pearl of congealed flesh. When it first bursts, it is like a split melon; when fully ruptured, like a peeled tangerine.\"* Reflecting on these words, one cannot bear the suffering of those afflicted with abscesses. Yet if I were to stand before such a patient, my brows would furrow in distress, my face contort in aversion—even as I longed to knead the wound, I would recoil from sucking it. Is this how a physician should act? You, sir, must emulate the true healer.\n\nYou should cultivate the blessings you sow and the deeds you accumulate, for they are no less than the labors of the woodcutter Su or the surgeon’s skill in lancing boils. Did you know that the First Emperor of Qin carved into human flesh, and Emperor Wu of Han flayed human skin? You, however, treat abscesses and fistulas without decoctions or cauterization, without needles or scraping—only with medicine to attack the illness within and salves to apply without, until the affliction falls away like a leaf from a branch or a flower yielding fruit. Such is the depth of your care.\n\nThis is written for all to see.\n\n---\n\n**Essay to Banish the Sleep Demon**\n\nMan is not granted a hundred years—how many days does he truly have? A hundred years contain thirty-six thousand days, each with a hundred thousand moments. Yet in the span of a single moment, a finger’s snap, morning rises and evening falls—such is the constant of time. Within a hundred years, seventy-seven million five hundred thousand moments are spent in social obligations, and another seventy-seven million five hundred thousand in sleep. Subtracting sleep, man has but fifty years of waking life—how much less for those who do not reach a hundred?\n\nYet some indulge in slumber as if unaware even of grass and trees. The primordial spirit flees its abode, scattering without return; true qi departs the body, leaving breath without anchor. Clouds veil the heart’s sky, waves muddy the sea of nature. The mirror of wisdom gathers dust, the sword of intellect grows dull. Wakefulness becomes slumber, clarity turns to obscurity. One drifts like a ghostly mountain, darkens like a spectral valley. In stupor, one is as insensate as a drunkard; in torpor, as dazed as one drugged with mandrake. The taste is like a parched fish ensnared in a net; the longing, like a starving rat coveting a painted cake. The snores roar like thunder shaking a thousand peaks; the struggle is like waves crashing into a cliffside well.\n\nNo blade of wisdom can pierce it, no rope of intellect can pull one back. What of the stillness of a bright window and a chaste desk? The purity of a plain mat and a small pillow? Within, the empty valley cradles a myriad spirits; without, the great earth houses a hundred bones. The eyes seal shut like lacquer, the limbs grow heavy as stone. Then the Sleep Demon arrives, consorting with the heart’s monkey and the mind’s horse. It defies the sovereign of the heart, spurns the spirit of the valley. It seizes the jade towers and golden palaces of the body, turning them into its own fortress—looming ten thousand fathoms high, weighing a thousand pounds. It plunders the soul, buries the spirit, steals the cinnabar from one’s home, and robs the treasure vault.\n\nIt conjures illusions, transforms appearances. No talisman or charm can chase it; no libation can appease it. Thus, I demote the Minister of Qingzhou, summon Black Sweetness, call forth Yellow Slumber, and dispatch the Cloud-Cream Envoy, arming him with a sword to strike. Yet still, the Sleep Demon rages unchecked, unmoved by war, unshaken in countenance.\n\nThen I command the Ink-Pine Censor, the Rabbit-Hair Secretary, the Black Jade Cavalry Officer, and the Ke Creek Commander to drive dragons and tigers into battle. I seal the nose, bind the tongue, listen with the ears, see with the eyes—yet the Sleep Demon nestles in the land of Hua Xu, hides in the realm of the locust tree, transforms into a butterfly, shifts into an ant. Between the pillars, it murmurs in delight.\n\nSo I weave a willow carriage and mend a grass boat, fill paper money into bags and bundle bamboo-wrapped millet. I paint an ox to pull the cart, draw a dragon to pole the boat. With three bows, I address the Sleep Demon: *\"I have long heard of your desire to depart. I have chosen the day and prepared the vessel. You and your companions should take your leave. Here is rice to fill your bowls, wine to fill your cups. Go with your friends, linger no longer. Flee swift as clouds, vanish quick as lightning. Search your hearts—do you truly wish to stay?\"*",

Shoulders hunch as the neck strains, eyes bulge as the tongue lolls.

Now you bid me depart, but I have no home to return to. Though I take leave of you, how can I not weep? I am a ghost, not a man—what need have I for carriage or boat? What use are food and drink to me? I would eat, yet have no mouth; I would dress, yet have no body to bare. I would ride, yet there is no road; I would sail, yet there is no shore. If you would but turn your thoughts inward, you would see I am no affliction of yours. Wash your heart clean and cultivate stillness—then you may seal your form and close your spirit.\"*\n\nAgain I address it: *\"You merely see me sit in silence and peer through my windows; you merely see me lost in thought and scale my palace walls. I am no Chen Tuan dreaming his way into the vast wilds, nor King Xiang of Chu dreaming his way into Gaotang. Do not bewitch me—lest I cleave you with the Heavenly Axe.\"*\n\nFour or five Sleep Demons turn to one another, faces aghast, and speak in reply: *\"Though we are called the essence of sleep-demons, we are but one spirit of your own self. When the spirit is clear, the Sleep Demon departs; when the spirit is dull, the Sleep Demon arises. Sleep only the body, not the spirit—that is the way. Gather us into primordial essence, store us as the one numinous spark, melt us into the Great Void, release us into the Great Clarity. If you but keep us in your dwelling and preserve your form, you may escape death and attain long life.\"*\n\nI laugh and say: *\"Do I drive out the Sleep Demon—or does the Sleep Demon drive me out?\"*\n\n**Admonition on the Study of the Dao**\nWhen Sima Ziwei first sought immortality, he placed a hundred pieces of tile before his desk. For every scroll of the *Scripture of Salvation* he read, he moved one tile beneath the desk. Each day, through all one hundred divisions of time, he studied a hundred scrolls. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of Supreme Clarity, Keeper of the Registers, and the True Person of the Cinnabar Prime of the Grand Empyrean.\n\nLikewise, when Ge Xiaoxian first refined the elixir, he always held a rosary in hand. Each day, seated by the alchemical furnace, he recited the full name of the Jade Emperor ten thousand times. Through such diligence and toil, sustained over time, he ascended to become the Perfected of the Purple Spirit of the Jade Void, the Mysterious and Tranquil True Person of Universal Transformation.\n\nWhat manner of men are we? Born in the Central Kingdom, raised in noble households, our six senses complete, our nature and intellect keen—we ought to kindle the resolve for diligence and swiftly ascend the steps of the Most High.\n\nThe crow soars over Fusang, the hare flies to the Broad Cold Palace. The swallow returns to the Black Robes, the wild goose crosses Mount Heng. Xihe drives the sun and moon, and the sun and moon hasten the years. Human life is but a dream, death no more than a night’s slumber. How many times have we scratched our heads in vain, drowned our aspirations in poetry and wine, utterly heedless of the Dao, the mind-monkey left without a master?\n\nFrom this day forth, I sever all ties. Turning back to survey the path ahead—youth does not return, time must not be squandered. One day, when I gaze down upon the mortal realm, my eyes will look down upon the cosmos. I shall ride the white clouds, tread the Purple Pole—all beginning today.\n\nExert yourselves! Exert yourselves!\n\n*On Dreams*",

Yet they were not the sleep of sleep, nor the dreams of dreams.\n\nConsider Zhuang Zhou’s dream of becoming a butterfly, or Lü Dongbin’s dream of being an ant—vastly different paths indeed. The *Nanhua Sutra* states: \"In their slumber, no dreams; in their waking, no cares.\" This arises from the undivided concentration of spirit and the undispersed gathering of qi. For they had penetrated to the primordial mind-ground of Fuxi, and thus what they called \"dreams\" were but the communion of spirit and the union of sincerity—not the deluded fantasies of sleep.\n\nIf one fails to grasp the principle of dreamlessness within dreams, the wandering consciousness and drifting soul will float aimlessly, lost and unrecoverable, manifesting in the realms of perception and cognition, only to return to the cycles of womb, egg, moisture, and transformation. How much more so when, amidst the myriad affairs of the world and the ceaseless clamor of thoughts, the mind is ensnared by external things, its tranquility shattered?

Above and below oppose and do not respond, hence 'not grasping its body'; 'walking its courtyard, not seeing its person'—no blame.\"\nThe *Xiang* says: \"The doubled mountain of Gèn: the noble person reflects without overstepping his position.\"\n\nThe elders said: \"To study the entire *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* is not as good as reading the single hexagram Gèn.\" For the *Avataṃsaka* speaks only of cessation and contemplation, while Gèn embodies the meaning of the doubled mountain. The mountain is the character *chū* (出, \"to emerge\"): though it halts in obscurity, it emerges into clarity.

year.\n\nOn the Orchid Pavilion’s purification day—the *Xu* star descends upon the courtyard locust tree.\nThe *bingzi* year aligns with the Northern Emperor;\nMoreover, the Northern Spirit’s birth is the locust wood—essence of *Xu* and *Wei*.\nBorn with divine spirit—pearl-browed, sun-angled;\nSmoke-like whiskers, awe-inspiring—eyes flashing like lightning.\n\nProdigious in speech and calligraphy—his mind vast and erudite;\nHis heart yearns for the solitary cloud and lone crane.\nIn azure robes, shedding his mortal form—he meets his master in the jade palace;\nFrom the Nine Heavens, rain and dew descend—he dons a feathered cap, assuming the posture of transcendence.\n\nJade chimes resound with celestial chant—his voice pierces the Great Void;\nHe serves in office, clarifying records.\nIn the Hall of Medicines, he collates maps and texts—green scrolls, cinnabar script;\nLater, he oversees the registers.\n\nRefining white lead blossoms—red furnace tempering snow;\nThe Valley Spirit formless—autumn moon on a jade pool.\nHis teaching mat and seat—his reputation reaches the celestial court;\nHe serves as vice-official.\n\nPiercing ignorance, severing vulgarity—his teachings scatter like flying jade fragments.\nIn his sleeve, a green serpent—beyond his spine, azure bronze;\nWearing through iron shoes—he nurtures purity in the bamboo palace.\nPaying homage to grotto-heavens, he returns to the Great One.\n\nAt court, eloquent—before the throne, he enjoys celestial rank;\nAs the Imperial Talisman-Water Dharma Master.\nHis brush roars like thunder—his alms-bowl conceals dragons.\nHe sings of returning to his native mountains—ancient pines, cold chrysanthemums;\nGathered disciples brew wine—steaming millet porridge for the masses.\nHe urges them to uphold official oaths.\n\nFlying *gang* transformation incantations—the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Heart Method;\nPerceiving the subtle, listening to the void—the Lingbao Central Alliance Thread.\nClad in rosy clouds, pearl pendants—holding the jade tablet, he gazes upon the Mysterious Altar;\nOverseeing the tally of ordained disciples.\n\nBlack hooks, dark inlays—flowers on paper chill the ghosts’ courage.\nThe Mysterious Realm revives—propping up the fallen, lifting the sunken;\nThe Three Realms bow in reverence—myriad spirits tremble in awe.\n\nAbiding in truth, dwelling in immortality—together with the potter’s kiln and catalpa;\nOrnate eaves, dragon-carved beams—flowered tiles pave Ruan’s poetry.\nConstructing halls and pavilions.\n\nImperial bestowal of the *pu* beast—morning and evening, its jade tones resound;\nA hundred affairs restored—ancestral principles rise anew.\nIn death, he praises his bones’ conduct—unrefined yet unadorned.\nRosy cheeks, white teeth—sixty years, a full cycle of *jiazi*;\nTemples sprouting black threads—people say he appears forty;\nThe golden elixir ripened—he becomes a man of heaven, a crane among immortals.\nA man of heaven—self-styled \"Clumsy Hermitage.\"\n\nLaughing at the Three Flowers—all directions cease their homage;\nHis dwelling is the Hall of Three Flowers.\nIncense from Boshan’s flying serpent scripts—opening jade bamboo to recite sacred texts;\nFeather fan, silk headband—dust whisk stirring pure discourse.\n\nDuring his discourse, a visitor from beyond the world arrives and sings:\n*\"Blue cloth robe, jade-green staff,\nPoems chant white peonies, melodies sing purple hibiscus.\nA game of chess ends—worldly affairs awaken;\nSeven strings plucked—mundane illusions shatter.\"*\n\nNow

sky;\nKnowing the master’s heart—snow touched by a red furnace.\nHearing of the master’s virtue—ice-pure, jade-clear;\nWitnessing the master’s deeds—frost’s heat, ice’s flame.\n\nThe master’s words—cutting nails, severing iron;\nThe master’s conduct—slaying men, drawing blood.\nA heart attuned to wind and moon—bamboo’s integrity, pine’s resolve.\nThe Dao’s methods submerged—disciples scattered like shattered tiles;\nThe master wields the prefect’s decree—thunder roars, lightning flashes.\n\nIn the Grotto Palace, he initiates grand rituals—\nChariots of *geng* and *nan* wood, clay vessels, cracked bowls;\nAdorned with splendor, embellished with elegance.\nWithin a year, the azure river bends;\nCrossing with the Five Divine Feet—rosy skirts arrayed in ranks.\n\nOrder restored, harmony achieved—\nWhy, like a cloud-crane, does he suddenly return to the imperial court?\nMountains and streams lose their hue—gibbons and crows mourn in sorrow.\nScattering verses at the jade shrine—a single cypress seed burns.\nYearning and admiration fade—leaving one choked with grief.\n\n---\n\n**Master Xu Jing**\n\nWho lacks the seven-return elixir?\nThe master departs—who recognizes him?\nIf one wishes to see the true Xu Jing,\nLook to the west of the Northern Dipper—a single point of light.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for the Portrait of Master Zhu Wengong**\n\nHeaven and earth are
