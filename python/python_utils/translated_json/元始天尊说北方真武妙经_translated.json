With him gathered the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the ten Perfected Ones of the Poles, countless flying celestial deities, jade lads and jade maidens, all in attendance to his left and right. As one, they assembled.\n\nThe drums of the Dharma resounded, and celestial music arose of itself. The great assembly rejoiced and listened as the Heavenly Honored One expounded the supreme, most wondrous, and true Dharma.\n\nThen, from the northeast of the Upper Prime Heavenly Palace, seven great tremors shook the heavens, and the celestial gates suddenly opened. Gazing downward upon the world, they beheld a foul and noxious *qi*—black, poisonous, and suffused with the light of blood and filth. Dim and obscure, it rose straight from the northeast of the human realm, coiling upward into the heavens, unyielding and unscattered.\n\nThe great assembly was struck with awe and dared not speak or inquire.\n\nFrom among the assembly, a perfected one named Wondrous Conduct, whose majesty and virtue were complete and whom all heavens revered, stepped forth from the ranks. Holding a tablet, he knelt and addressed the Heavenly Honored One, saying: “This realm is the pure and tranquil domain of the Great Yang Dao—how then does this black and poisonous *qi* coil upward? What strange cause lies behind it? We beseech the Heavenly Honored One, most sagely, to proclaim the truth for all and dispel our doubts.”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One replied: “You, Wondrous Conduct, have asked this question for the sake of all beings. Return to your seat, compose your spirit in stillness, and I shall explain.”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One said: “The people of the Lower Prime all receive their forms from the pure and undifferentiated *qi* of the True One, each endowed with thirty-six thousand spirits and *qi* to guard and sustain their bodies. Yet now, the reckoning of yin and yang is exhausted, and the kalpa’s end draws near. Demons and ghosts spread unchecked, and beings follow perverse paths. Forgetting their original source, they flatter and seek fleeting fortune, sunk in delusion and chaos. Disloyal, unfilial, unjust, and unkind, they delight in wicked spirits, offering prayers and sacrifices to demonic arts. Now, they are wrongfully harmed by the demons of the Six Heavens—whether old or young, man or woman. Their allotted years unfulfilled, they are slain without cause. Though their time has not come, their souls have nowhere to turn. The poison of ghosts surges, and the dead linger, unscattered. Their resentment and rage rise upward, coiling into this malign *qi*. You should take heed.”\n\nThereupon, the Perfected One Wondrous Conduct and the great assembly, having heard these words, were filled with dread. They wished to entreat the Heavenly Honored One to temporarily descend his awe-inspiring radiance to the lower realms, to subdue and eradicate the demonic hordes, to save and deliver all beings, to rescue and uplift the lost souls, and to banish perverse misfortune. Yet the assembly hesitated, uncertain.\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One declared: “There is no need for my divine might. To the north, there already exists a great divine general named True Warrior. His legions are fierce and valiant, supremely capable of subduing perverse paths and beheading demonic fiends.”\n\nThe Perfected One then addressed the Heavenly Honored One, saying: “We humbly inquire—this divine general, dwelling in the celestial realms, what virtues and powers did he cultivate to become such a divine commander?”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One declared: “In former times, there was a king of Jinle and his consort, Queen Shansheng. The queen dreamed of swallowing sunlight and, upon waking, conceived. She carried the child for fourteen months. On the third day of the third month in the *jiachen* year of the Kaihuang era, at the hour of noon, the prince was born within the palace. From birth, he was divinely spirited; as he grew, he became fierce and valiant. Yet he did not ascend the throne, devoting himself solely to cultivation. He vowed to aid the Jade Emperor in cutting down all demonic forces beneath heaven and delivering the multitudes. Day and night within the palace, he made this oath, and his father could not restrain him. Thus, he abandoned his home, bid farewell to his parents, and entered the Wudang Mountains, where he cultivated the Dao for forty-two years. When his merit was complete and his fruitfulness fulfilled, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Jade Emperor, hearing of his valor, appointed him to guard the northern realm, entrusting him with the position of True Warrior to sever all demonic and perverse forces beneath heaven.”\n\nThe Perfected One addressed the Heavenly Honored One, saying: “How may this divine general descend to the lower realms to eradicate demonic fiends, deliver all beings, and spare them from violent deaths? May the great compassion be fulfilled, for this would bring daily benefit.”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One granted his request and commanded the Jade Youth on his right to swiftly dispatch a divine decree and talisman directly to the north, summoning the divine general True Warrior. Upon receiving the summons, the general led his legions and hastened to the presence of the Heavenly Honored One, kneeling in reverence: “I have received the Jade Emperor’s decree to guard the northern realm. By what grace today do I behold your compassionate countenance and receive this talismanic summons?”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One replied: “In the Upper Prime Palace, I was expounding the Dharma to a great assembly when suddenly, from below, black and venomous qi of resentment surged upward into the celestial realms, alarming all present. You must go there to subdue and eradicate the demonic hordes and rescue the lost souls.”\n\nThe divine general True Warrior respectfully received the Heavenly Honored One’s command. With hair unbound and feet bare, he trod upon the intertwined serpent and Eight Trigrams divine tortoise. Leading three hundred thousand divine generals, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, the Five Thunder divine soldiers, mighty lions, venomous dragons, and ferocious beasts, with a vast procession before and behind, he descended to the lower realms. Within seven days, all demonic forces beneath heaven were eradicated. Humans and ghosts were separated, grievances dissolved, the living found peace, and the lands were purified.\n\nTrue Warrior and his legions returned to the Upper Prime Palace and presented themselves before the Heavenly Honored One, saying: “Yesterday, by your command, we descended to the lower realms to eradicate the demonic hordes. By the power of your compassion, within seven days, all perverse spirits beneath heaven were swept away.”\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One said: “Excellent! Have you and your divine hosts not wearied?”\n\nThereupon, True Warrior arranged the celestial patterns, directed the Dipper’s handle, and with the *kuigang* constellation’s force, assisted the Celestial Pass. He intoned the incantation:\n\n*Born of the Great Yin, essence of the Water trigram,\nAligned with Xu and Wei above, tortoise and serpent conjoined.\nPervading the Six Directions, your might subdues the ten thousand spirits.\nNo darkness escapes your gaze, no wish remains unfulfilled.\nFrom kalpa’s end to kalpa’s dawn, you sever demonic essence.\nDelivering the multitudes, bringing peace to households and nations.\nWhen the cyclical reckoning reaches *jia* at the end,\nAnd demonic qi flows unchecked,\nThe Emperor issues his decree, and I descend in spirit.\nProclaiming the true Dharma, dispelling perversity and averting war,\nNurturing the masses, aiding the resurgence of the center.\nShould any petty demon dare appear,\nMy single glance will topple the Five Peaks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nHe then offered the ritual incantation, saying:\n\nIn the Primordial Beginning, in the Great Simplicity,\nNo image, no form—\nWho could know the heavy and turbid?\nWho could discern the light and pure?\nWithin the chaos, I divided darkness from light.\nHeaven gained its strength, Earth attained its tranquility.\nThe people found sustenance, all things sprouted forth.\nPerversity was rectified, spirits became numinous.\nWithin the Three Realms, the myriad beings flourished.\n\nWhen the Great Uncarved Block dispersed,\nBenevolence and righteousness arose.\nWhen rites and music were established,\nDeceit and perversity spread.\nThe Six Relations faltered, the Four Peoples contended.\nAbove, there was no magnanimity; below, no loyalty or fidelity.\nDemons and ghosts, specters and spirits,\nRampant in their venom, harassed the living.\nEntire households fell to illness, years passed under official punishment.\nWealth dissipated, kin were left forlorn.\nLives were cut short unjustly, calamities entwined.\nFoul and turbid qi ascended to the Celestial Court.\nThe Heavenly Venerable issued his decree, commanding peace and stability.\nAll specters were severed, no ghost left unscorched.\nOfficers of pestilence bowed their heads in submission.\nGhostly essences were extinguished, demonic forces overthrown.\n\nI command one hundred thousand mighty warriors,\nFifty million soldiers.\nFrom Heaven above to Earth below,\nThey rise and descend at my behest.\nThose who resist me perish; those who revere me live.\nThose who revile me are disgraced; those who honor me are exalted.\nThose who offer rites to me gain longevity; those who defy me meet their end.\nThis is my decree—let humans and spirits alike heed it!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nHe then offered another incantation, saying:\nO Mysterious Heaven of the North, O Profound Divine Lord,\nWith countless transformations, O numinous and true Xuanwu,\nYou soar through the heavens, overturn the earth,\nDrive the thunder, race the clouds.\nA host of millions strong, you sweep away demonic miasma.\nThunder Lords attend you, Jade Maidens command your generals.\nGhosts and spirits submit, dragons and tigers flee in concealment.\nYour might shakes the Five Peaks, the myriad spirits all obey.\nWith bells ringing and drums resounding, you traverse the cosmos.\nYou seize rebellious ghosts, shatter demonic armies.\nExpelling perversity, aiding rectitude, the Dao’s qi ever approaches.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable addressed Zhenwu, saying:\nFrom this day forth, whenever the cyclical signs *jiazi* or *gengshen* arrive,\nOr on the third and seventh days of each month,\nYou shall descend into the human realm.\nReceive the offerings of mortals, observe their good and evil,\nTheir cultivation of merit and transgression, the length of their years.\nFollow my teachings: let them present offerings and recite sutras,\nThat the host of perfected beings may descend.\nDemon essences will be subdued, inauspicious omens severed.\nThe departed will transcend suffering, the Nine Dark Realms will know respite.\nThe living will receive blessings, the world will know peace.\n\nAt that moment, the Wondrous Practitioner and the assembly of Celestial Emperors,\nInnumerable Flying Heavenly Kings, perfected immortals, and divine multitudes,\nHaving heard these words, rejoiced and exulted.\nAs one, they paid homage and extolled his virtue.\n“We today,” they said, “have received the great benefit of the Dharma.\nWe beseech you to descend into the world of humans,\nTo deliver and protect all beings, sparing them the Three Calamities and hardships.”\nEach vowed to uphold and practice these teachings, bowing in reverence.\n\nThe divine generals of Zhenwu, having received the Heavenly Venerable’s decree,\nWere commanded to eternally guard the North.\nThey took their leave and withdrew.\n\nThus concludes *The Wondrous Sutra of Zhenwu of the Northern Realm*, spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable.",
