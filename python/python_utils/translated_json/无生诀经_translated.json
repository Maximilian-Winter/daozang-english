  "full_translation": "**The Scripture of Non-Arising**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of Union with Arising* (alternatively, *The Scripture of the Unborn*)\n**Author:** Anonymous\n**Volume:** One\n**Source:** *Supplement to the Daoist Canon*, Huai section\n\n---\n\n**Śākyamuni Buddha:**\nThe Dharma is fundamentally without Dharma,\nYet the Dharma-less Dharma is also Dharma.\nNow, when the Dharma-less is transmitted,\nHow can Dharma meet with Dharma?\n\n**Mahākāśyapa the Venerable:**\nDharmas are originally twofold Dharma,\nYet without Dharma, there is no non-Dharma.\nWhy, within a single Dharma,\nDo some see Dharma and others not?\n\n**Śāṇavāsa the Venerable:**\nIt is neither Dharma nor mind,\nWithout mind, there is no Dharma.\nWhen speaking of mind-Dharma,\nThis Dharma is not mind-Dharma.\n\n**Upagupta the Venerable:**\nThe mind is originally the mind,\nThe original mind is not a Dharma.\nIf there is Dharma, there is the original mind,\nYet it is neither mind nor original Dharma.\n\n**Dhṛṭaka the Venerable:**\nWhen you recognize the nature of mind,\nIt may be called the inconceivable.\nYet when fully realized, nothing is attained—\nWhen attained, it cannot be spoken or known.\n\n**Great Master Bodhidharma:**\nIn the womb, it is the body;\nIn the world, it is the person.\nIn the eye, it is seeing;\nIn the ear, it is hearing;\nIn the nose, it discerns fragrance;\nIn the mouth, it engages in discourse;\nIn the hands, it grasps and holds;\nIn the feet, it moves and runs.\nPervading and encompassing the Dharma-realm,\nIt is gathered into a single mote of dust.\nThose who recognize it know it as Buddha-nature;\nThose who do not call it the spirit-soul.\n\nIt does not see evil and generate aversion,\nNor observe goodness and strive for it.\nIt does not abandon wisdom to approach foolishness,\nNor cast off delusion to attain awakening.\nIt transcends measure in penetrating the Great Dao,\nAnd surpasses bounds in comprehending the Buddha-mind.\nNot entangled with ordinary or sacred,\nIt is called \"uncovered\" in its transcendent state.\n\nWhen deluded, people pursue Dharma;\nWhen awakened, Dharma follows people.\nAwakened, one recognizes that perception encompasses form;\nDeluded, form encompasses perception.\nMerely by the mind’s discrimination,\nCalculations arise from the mind itself.\nAll measurements are but dreams—\nIf you recognize the mind’s original quiescence,\nWithout a single stirring thought,\nThis is called true awakening.\n\n**Great Master Sengcan:**\nThough flowers are sown in the earth,\nFrom the earth, the flower-seed grows.\nIf no one plants the seed,\nNeither flower nor earth arises.\n\nThe supreme Dao is not difficult,\nOnly avoid picking and choosing.\nSimply do not love or hate,\nAnd all becomes perfectly clear.\nRound and equal to the great void,\nNothing lacking, nothing in excess.\nTruly, it is through grasping and rejecting\nThat one falls short.\nDo not chase after existence,\nNor cling to the endurance of emptiness.\nMaintain a single, even mind,\nAnd all distinctions naturally dissolve.\n\nTo halt movement is to return to movement,\nYet halting only increases movement.\nClinging to either side,\nHow can one know the singular?\nIf the singular is not penetrated,\nBoth sides lose their efficacy.\nAbandoning existence and non-existence,\nOne turns from emptiness to oppose emptiness.\nReturning to the root, one grasps the essence,\nBut following illumination, one loses the source.\nA moment of turning inward\nSurpasses all prior emptiness.\nThe transformation of prior emptiness\nArises from deluded perception.\nDo not seek the real—\nOnly cease to hold views.\n\nFrom duality arises oneness,\nYet even oneness must not be grasped.\nWhen the mind does not arise,\nThe myriad dharmas are without fault.\nWithout fault, there is no Dharma;\nWithout arising, there is no mind.\nWhen the subject vanishes, the object sinks;\nThe object follows the subject’s submersion.\nThe object arises from the subject,\nThe subject from the object.\nTo know these two aspects\nIs to see they are originally one emptiness.\nOne emptiness unites the two,\nEqually containing all phenomena.\n\nThe wise are without action,\nThe foolish bind themselves.\nDharma is not a different Dharma—\nDelusion arises from clinging.\nTo employ the mind to use the mind,\nIs this not a great error?\n\nDelusion gives rise to quiet and disturbance;\nAwakening is without good or evil.\nAll dualities\nMust be carefully weighed.\nDreams, illusions, and empty flowers—\nWhy labor to grasp them?\nGain and loss, right and wrong—\nLet them all be released at once.\n\nIf the eye does not sleep,\nAll dreams vanish of themselves.\nIf the mind does not differ,\nThe myriad dharmas are one thusness.\n\nTo halt movement is not movement,\nTo halt stillness is not stillness.\nIf the two cannot be established,\nHow can the one exist?\nThe one is all,\nAll is the one.\nIf you can be thus,\nWhy worry about incompletion?\n\nAll is the precepts of the self-nature,\nAll is the wisdom of unimpeded self-nature.\nNeither increasing nor diminishing, it is the vajra of self-nature;\nDeparting and arriving, it is the samādhi of the original body.\nNot seeing a single Dharma yet abiding in non-seeing\nIs like floating clouds obscuring the face of the sun.\nNot knowing a single Dharma yet clinging to empty knowing\nIs like lightning flashing in the great void.\nWhen such knowing and seeing fleetingly arise,\nHow can one mistakenly recognize them as expedient means?\nYou should, in a single thought, know your own error—\nYour own numinous light is ever manifest.\n\n**Great Master Hongren:**\nSentient beings sow the seed,\nAnd from the ground, the fruit arises.\nThe insentient have no seed,\nThus, without nature, there is no arising.\n\n**Great Master Lu Neng:**\nFundamentally, bodhi has no tree,\nNor is the bright mirror a stand.\nOriginally, there is not a single thing—\nWhere could dust alight?\n\nWhen the mind is deluded, the *Lotus Sutra* turns;\nWhen the mind awakens, it turns the *Lotus Sutra*.\nReciting the sutra for long without understanding\nMakes it an enemy of its meaning.\n\nWithout thought, thought is correct;\nWith thought, thought becomes deviant.\nNeither calculating existence nor non-existence,\nOne eternally rides the white ox cart.\n\nSamādhi is the essence of wisdom,\nWisdom is the function of samādhi.\nAt the time of wisdom, samādhi is in wisdom;\nAt the time of samādhi, wisdom is in samādhi.\nLike the light of a lamp—\nWith the lamp, there is light;\nWithout the lamp, there is darkness.\nThe lamp is the essence of light,\nLight is the function of the lamp.\nThough the names are two,\nTheir essence is not different.\n\nTo seek to see the Buddha,\nOnly recognize sentient beings.\nIt is only because sentient beings are deluded about the Buddha,\nNot because the Buddha is deluded about sentient beings.\nIf the self-nature awakens,\nSentient beings are the Buddha;\nIf the self-nature is deluded,\nThe Buddha is sentient beings.\nWhen the self-nature is equanimous,\nSentient beings are the Buddha;\nWhen the self-nature is biased,\nThe Buddha is sentient beings.\n\nThe Buddha is in my own mind—\nMy own Buddha is the true Buddha.\nIf I myself lack the Buddha-mind,\nWhere can the true Buddha be sought?\nThus, the sutra says:\nWhen the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise;\nWhen the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease.\n\nThe ordinary person is the Buddha,\nAfflictions are bodhi.\nThe prior thought deluded is the ordinary person;\nThe subsequent thought awakened is the Buddha.\nThe prior thought attached to conditions is affliction;\nThe subsequent thought detached from conditions is bodhi.\n\n**Chan Master Farong:**\nConditions have no beauty or ugliness—\nBeauty and ugliness arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not impose names,\nWhere can deluded thoughts arise?\nWhen deluded thoughts do not arise,\nThe true mind functions freely.\n\n**Chan Master Huizhong**\n\nThe thought-stream is but illusion from the start,\nTrue nature has no end nor beginning.\nIf one grasps this meaning,\nThe long waves will cease of themselves.\n\nPerson and dharma both pure,\nGood and evil both forgotten.\nThe straight mind, the true intent—\nThis is the bodhimanda.\n\n**Chan Master Shenxiu:**\nAll Buddha-dharmas are originally within the mind;\nTo seek them outside is to abandon the father and flee.\n\n**Great Master Sida of Nanyue:**\nThe source of the Dao is not far,\nThe sea of nature is not distant.\nSeek only within yourself,\nDo not search elsewhere.\nTo search is not to find,\nAnd what is found is not real.\n\n**Master Wugong of Tianhuang:**\nFollow your nature, roam freely,\nWander at ease with conditions.\nSimply exhaust the ordinary mind—\nThere is no separate \"sacred\" understanding.\n\n**Chan Master Benjing:**\nThe Buddha is awakened through the mind,\nThe mind is revealed through the Buddha.\nIf one awakens to no-mind,\nThe Buddha too does not exist.\nThe Dao is fundamentally without mind,\n\"No-mind\" is the name of the Dao.\nIf one fully understands no-mind,\nNo-mind *is* the Dao.\n\nSeeing, hearing, knowing, perceiving—no obstruction,\nSound, scent, taste, touch—ever in samadhi.\nLike a bird flying in empty space,\nNo grasping, no rejecting, no love, no hate.\nIf one meets conditions with no-mind,\nOnly then is one called \"Guan Zizai.\"\n\nTo see the Dao is to cultivate the Dao;\nWithout seeing it, what is there to cultivate?\nThe nature of the Dao is like empty space—\nWhat does empty space contain?\nSurvey those who cultivate the Dao:\nThey stir the fire seeking floating bubbles.\n\nJust watch the fine marionettes—\nWhen the coins run out, all comes to rest.\n\nPush the real: the real has no form.\nExhaust the false: the false has no shape.\nTurn back to examine and push the mind—\nKnow that the mind too is but a provisional name.\n\nGood arises from the mind—\nCan evil exist apart from the mind?\nGood and evil are external conditions,\nIn the mind they truly do not exist.\nWhere to discard evil?\nWhom to entrust with good?\nAlas for those of two minds,\nRunning back and forth between conditions.\nIf one awakens to the original no-mind,\nOnly then will one regret past faults.\n\n**Chan Master Zhongguo of Nanyang:**\nGreen vines climb straight to the cold pine’s peak;\nWhite clouds drift through mud, emerging in the vast emptiness.\n\nAll dharmas are fundamentally at rest,\nYet people themselves create disturbance.\nWhen beings are deluded, they congeal nature into mind—\nLike water freezing into ice in the cold.\nWhen beings awaken, they dissolve mind back into nature—\nLike ice melting into water in warmth.\n\nDharma, dharma, dharma—originally no dharma;\nEmpty, empty, empty—yet not empty.\nStillness and clamor, speech and silence—all originally the same.\nWhy labor to speak of dreams within a dream?\n\nIn the useful there is no use;\nIn effortless effort, effort is applied—\nLike fruit ripening naturally red,\nAsk not how to cultivate or plant.\n\n**Master Jigong of Panshan:**\nThe mind-moon stands alone, perfectly round,\nIts light embracing the ten thousand images.\nThe light does not illuminate objects,\nNor do objects exist.\nWhen both light and objects are forgotten,\nWhat remains?\n\n**Master Haigong of Dazhu:**\nIf one does not follow sounds and forms to stir thoughts,\nDoes not chase after appearances,\nThe mind’s understanding arises naturally—\nAble to go without affairs.\n\nThe *Prajñā Sūtra* says:\nThe nine kinds of beings,\nEach body fully equipped,\nTransform as they create—\nThus arises ignorance.\n\nAs egg-born: wrapped in affliction;\nAs womb-born: steeped in the waters of love;\nAs moisture-born: vexation arises from longing;\nAs transformation-born: awakening is Buddhahood.\n\nDelusion is called \"sentient beings,\"\nBodhisattvas take thought after thought—\nThe mind *is* sentient beings.\nIf one fully understands each thought,\nBoth mind and substance are empty—\nThis is called \"delivering sentient beings.\"\n\nThe wise, at their own original ground,\nDeliver what has not yet taken form.\nSince the unformed is empty,\nThey know in truth no sentient being is liberated.\n\n**Master Shanlu of the Good Perch:**\nThere is something prior to heaven and earth,\nFormless, originally still and silent.\nIt can be the master of the ten thousand images,\nYet does not fade with the four seasons.\n\nEmpty-handed, grasping a hoe,\nWalking on foot, riding an ox.\nPeople pass over the bridge—\nThe bridge flows, the water does not.\n\nNight after night, embracing the Buddha in sleep,\nMorning after morning, rising together.\nRising and sitting, always accompanied,\nSpeech and silence, dwelling as one.\nNot the slightest separation—\nLike form and shadow, inseparable.\nIf you wish to know where the Buddha is,\nJust this very voice is it.\n\n**Master Huizhen of Jianzhen:**\nThe eye’s light fades with colors,\nThe ear’s perception vanishes with sounds.\nTo return to the source—no other meaning,\nYesterday and today the same.\n\n**Master Mi of Jiashan:**\nThe mind is originally Buddha—\nWhen thoughts arise, one drifts and sinks.\nThe shore does not move,\nYet the boat races swiftly.\n\n**Master Bei of Xuansha:**\nThe mirror reflects all images,\nIts radiance undisturbed;\nThe bird flies in empty space,\nIts color not mingling with the sky.\n\n**Master Fu the Layman:**\nSalt’s flavor in water,\nGlue’s blue within color—\nUltimately they exist,\nYet their form is unseen.\n\nFalse calculation leads to attachment,\nMistaking rope for snake;\nDoubtful mind conjures dark ghosts,\nAiling eyes see flowers in the void.\n\nOne realm is not different,\nYet three people see it differently.\nUnderstanding this as unreal,\nOne forever rides the white ox cart.\n\n**Master Bai of Fayun:**\nLi Zhu with intent—\nWhite waves surge in vain;\nXiang Wang without mind—\nThe bright pearl suddenly in hand.\n\n**Master Shou of Yongming:**\nLike the wish-fulfilling jewel that follows colors,\nAll forms appear yet the original body remains unmoved;\nLike the echoing valley responding to sounds,\nAll voices arise yet their source leaves no trace.\n\nA lone gibbon cries, the moon falls on the central crag;\nA rustic traveler chants, the lamp burns low at midnight.\nWho can comprehend this scene at this moment?\nA meditating monk in the depths of white clouds.\n\nThe true mind’s essence\nCannot be expressed in words.\nLimpid as boundless empty space,\nLuminous as a flawless mirror.\n\nPraise and blame do not reach it,\nPrinciple and reason cannot fathom it.\nIt cannot be exhausted by existence or nonexistence,\nNor can its wondrous body be discoursed upon by knowledge or wisdom.\nOnly those who enter it know it in their hearts.\n\nLike grinding ten thousand ingredients into incense—\nOne speck of dust already contains all fragrances;\nLike bathing in the great sea—\nA single handful of water already uses all rivers.\n\nWhen seeing nature, nature is originally free—\nThoughts are not thoughts to be removed.\nWhen observing things, things are originally nonexistent—\nForms are not things to be dispelled.\n\nEyes full of sights, ears full of sounds,\nNeither following nor destroying—\nOnly then does one understand the true nature of sights and sounds.\nIf one falls into the gate of sounds and forms,\nOne falls into the realm of ordinary beings;\nIf one destroys the appearances of sounds and forms,\nOne enters the lesser vehicle.\n\nThus the Tathāgata’s true eye\nIlluminates all without omission—\nHow could it be like the blind eyes of ordinary beings,\nOr the dim vision of the two vehicles?\nThen, meeting conditions without hindrance,\nTouching realms without arising.\n\nPángyùn Layman:\nSimply wish to empty all that exists—\nBeware of reifying what does not.\n\nShuǐmíng Shòu-gōng:\nThe true source is profound and still,\nThe ocean of awakening, limpid and clear.\nCutting off the roots of names and forms,\nNo nearness of subject or object remains.\n\nAt first, unaware,\nA sudden stirring of the mind arises;\nBy clarity, illumination begins,\nFollowing illumination, dust is established.\nAs reflections appear in a mirror,\nThe root-body suddenly arises—\nFrom this, the true is lost, the nature forgotten,\nClinging to forms, chasing after names.\nAccumulating the dust of stagnant passions,\nWeaving the waves of continuous consciousness.\n\nLocking true awakening in the night of dreams,\nSinking into delusion within the three realms;\nBlinding the eye of wisdom on dark roads,\nCrawling within the nine dwellings.\nToward the unchanging realm of emptiness,\nReceiving rebirth in the inescapable dharma—\nSelf-generated bondage, like spring silkworms spinning cocoons,\nOr autumn moths rushing toward flame,\nWith the threads of dualistic delusion,\nBinding the karmic mass of suffering;\nWith the wings of ignorance and craving,\nDashing into the fire-wheel of birth and death.\n\nThere are also those of heterodox roots and external seeds,\nWith shallow wisdom and provisional devices,\nWho do not understand the source of the illness of birth and death,\nNor know the origin of the view of self and others.\nThey merely seek to shun noise and reject movement,\nTo break forms and analyze dust,\nThough they claim to savor stillness and darkness,\nThey do not know they bury the true and resist awakening—\nLike failing to distinguish red and green in the eye,\nBut only extinguishing the layered light upon the lamp,\nIgnoring the illusory body within perception,\nYet vainly avoiding the empty shadow in sunlight.\n\nSuch is the labor of form and toil of thought,\nA waste of effort, a loss of merit—\nNo different from adding water to ice,\nOr casting firewood into flame.\nWho knows that layered light resides in the blue,\nAnd empty shadows follow the body?\nRemove the diseased eye, and layered light vanishes of itself;\nCease the illusory form, and empty shadows must fade.\n\nIf one can turn the light inward,\nReflect upon the mind within the realm,\nThe Buddha-eye shines and karmic shadows dissolve,\nThe Dharma-body appears and the dust’s edge is cut off.\nWith the blade of self-awakened wisdom,\nSplit open the heart-pearl enmeshed within entanglements;\nWield the single thought of insight\nTo forge anew the net of views from former dust.\n\nThis is truly the essence of exhausting the mind,\nThe explanation of penetrating knowledge.\n\nCíyún Cōng Chánshī:\nA sliver of moon soaks the cold pond,\nWisps of cloud mirror the azure sky.\nFor those who have attained the Dao,\nWhat fine news this is.\n\nHuángshān Lún-gōng:\nOne dives into the Red Waters to seek the pearl,\nEnters Mount Jingshan to find the jade.\nYet what enters through the gate is not the family treasure—\nMistaking the shadow for the head, is this not a grave error?\n\nTiānyī Huái-gōng:\nWild geese cross the vast sky,\nTheir shadows sink into the cold water.\nThe geese have no intent to leave traces,\nThe water has no mind to retain reflections.\n\nGuīfēng Chánshī:\nWhen used, waves surge and the sea boils—\nThe whole true body moves in action;\nWhen at rest, the mirror is bright, the water still—\nAll conditions gather in stillness.\n\nThe mind has no inherent form,\nIt arises only when relying on conditions;\nThe realm of dust is empty, appearing only because of the mind.\n\nZhìzhēn Chánshī:\nThe mind is originally free of dust—what need is there to wash it?\nThe body is without illness—why seek medicine?\nTo know whether this is the Buddha or not,\nObserve the bright mirror, high and suspended, before it shines.\n\nLǐ Cháng-gōng:\nTen ages, past and present,\nBeginning and end never leave the edge of the present thought;\nRealms of self and other are not separated by a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe wise and the ordinary do not obstruct each other,\nLike many mirrors reflecting all forms;\nThe self and the other pose no hindrance,\nLike a thousand lamps sharing one room.\n\nTiāntái Guān-gōng:\nTranscending names and appearances, the wondrous essence fully manifests;\nBeyond past and present, the direct mechanism stands alone.\nGrasping the black pearl to illuminate things, each thing radiates brilliance;\nBrandishing the sacred sword to cleave the void, all traces vanish from the void.\n\nYúnmén Kǎn-gōng:\nBefore worldly toils are shattered, encountering conditions gives rise to endless distinctions;\nWhen the mind-mirror is perfectly bright, not even a hair’s breadth remains.\nThe numinous light shines purely,\nAlone revealing the true constant.\nPast and present both forgotten, sage and ordinary both transcended—\nOnly here can one roll and unfold at will,\nRespond and act without deficiency,\nMoving freely between the human realm and the heavens.\n\nDàjìng Chánshī:\nSitting idly at night, the mind’s thoughts scatter and fly.\nYet take this scattering, flying mind\nTo investigate the source of its flight—\nWhen the investigation finds no source,\nWhere then do the scattering thoughts abide?\nTurning back to investigate the investigating mind,\nWhere does the mind that investigates reside?\nThe wisdom that illuminates is fundamentally empty,\nThe realm it perceives is also still.\nStillness that is not stillness—\nFor there is no one who can still it;\nIllumination that is no illumination—\nFor there is no realm to be illuminated.\nWhen both realm and wisdom are still,\nThe mind’s anxieties naturally settle.\nThis is the essential path of returning to the source.\n\nSeeing things, one sees the mind;\nWithout things, the mind does not appear.\nAmidst full clarity or complete obstruction,\nThe true mind knows no bounds.\nIf the mind clings to knowledge and understanding,\nIt becomes inverted perception.\nOnly when seeing conditions without engaging the mind\nDoes one behold the firm ground of bodhi.\n\nYǒngjiā Chánshī:\nWhen the mind accords with emptiness,\nWhat care for slander or praise, what sorrow or joy?\nWhen the body accords with emptiness,\nWhat pain from the blade, what pleasure from fragrance?\nWhen karmic retribution accords with emptiness,\nWhat gain from giving, what loss from plunder?\n\nThe mind is not being, the mind is not non-being;\nThe mind is not non-being, the mind is not non-non-being.\nTo affirm being or non-being is to fall into affirmation;\nTo negate being or non-being is to fall into negation.\nThe idle Daoist, free from learning and effort,\nNeither eliminates delusion nor seeks truth.\nThe true nature of ignorance is Buddha-nature,\nThe illusory, empty body is the Dharma-body.\nWhen the Dharma-body awakens, nothing remains—\nThe original nature is the celestial true Buddha.\nThe five aggregates are floating clouds, coming and going in emptiness;\nThe three poisons are mere bubbles, rising and vanishing in illusion.\n\nStillness gives rise to mindlessness,\nAwareness gives rise to scattered thoughts.\nStillness may cure scattered thoughts,\nYet it breeds mindlessness;\nAwareness may cure mindlessness,\nYet it breeds scattered thoughts.\nThus it is said:\nAwareness within stillness is true,\nMindlessness within stillness is not;\nStillness within awareness is true,\nScattered thoughts within awareness are not.\n\nOrdinary people are often obstructed by affairs in principle,\nBy conditions in the mind.\nThey constantly seek to escape conditions to pacify the mind,\nTo abandon affairs to preserve principle—\nNot knowing it is the mind that obstructs conditions,\nPrinciple that obstructs affairs.\nSimply allow the mind to be empty, and conditions will empty themselves;\nLet principle be still, and affairs will still themselves.\nDo not invert the proper use of the mind.\n\nThis Dharma is the mind itself—\nBeyond the mind, no Dharma exists;\nThis mind is the Dharma itself—\nBeyond the Dharma, no mind exists.\nThe mind is naturally without mind,\nNor is there one who lacks mind.\nIf one attempts to use the mind to lack mind,\nThe mind paradoxically becomes something.\n\nBecause of greed, anger, and delusion,\nThe precepts, concentration, and wisdom are established.\nIf there were no afflictions originally,\nWhy would bodhi be needed?\nThus the ancestral master said:\nThe Buddha taught all Dharmas\nTo eliminate all minds.\nIf I have no mind at all,\nWhat use are all Dharmas?\n\nDòuchí Chánshī:\nAwakening to the mind is easy, stilling the mind is hard.\nWhen the mind’s source is stilled, leisure pervades everywhere.\nAs the Dipper turns and stars shift, the sky brightens toward dawn—\nWhite clouds still cover the green mountains as before.\n\nLíngyù Shānzhǔ:\nI possess a luminous pearl,\nLong locked away by worldly toils.\nToday, the dust is gone, and light arises,\nIlluminating mountains and rivers for ten thousand leagues.\n\nFórì Cái-gōng:\nThe city is bustling and noisy,\nThe mountains and forests are quiet and still.\nThough movement and stillness differ,\nThey are one—no different from life and death.\nThe four seasons turn in succession,\nThe principles of things are natural.\nSummer does not depart, yet autumn arrives on its own;\nThe wind does not chill, yet people feel refreshed.\n\nGuǎnghuì Chánshī:\nThe Buddha awakened through non-mind,\nThe mind is deluded by the existence of the Buddha.\nWhere the Buddha-mind is pure and clear,\nBeyond the clouds, a wild ape cries.\n\nYuánwù Chánshī:\nA bird flies through the empty sky—\nDoes the sky retain the bird’s shadow after it passes?\nA fish swims in the floating water—\nDoes the water leave the fish’s trace after it departs?\nThe sage’s mind responding to things\nIs likewise.\n\nShànshèng Chánshī\n\nThe echo ceases when the sound ends,\nYet one does not know sound is the root of echo;\nThe shadow flees when the form departs,\nYet one does not know form is the origin of shadow.\nTo inquire of the Dao with the Dao,\nOne does not know the Dao is originally without Dao;\nTo transmit the mind with the mind,\nOne does not know the mind is originally without mind.\n\nLóngjì Chánshī:\nThe wind stirs, the mind sways the tree,\nClouds arise, the nature stirs dust.\nIf one understands today’s affairs,\nThe original person remains obscured.\n\nGreen bamboo and yellow flowers are not external realms,\nWhite clouds and bright moon reveal the whole body.\nEverywhere is my family’s possession—\nPicked up at will, yet not of dust.\n\nWúzhuó Chánshī:\nA single leaf skiff drifts into vastness,\nOars dance and part from melody.\nClouds, mountains, water, moon—all cast aside,\nGaining only Zhuang Zhou’s long dream.\n\nClouds drift, the moon moves,\nThe boat sails, the shore shifts.\nNot knowing the clouds of delusion\nAre not the true moon;\nWhy does the boat of clinging attachment\nEver float on the unmoving shore of awakening?\n\nYúnyán Chánshī:\nA single mote in the eye,\nA thousand flowers scatter the sky;\nA single delusion in the mind,\nCountless sands arise and cease.\nWhen the mote’s shade vanishes, delusion ends, truth remains.\nIllness cured, medicine discarded—\nIce melts, water remains.\n\nEchoes in the valley, praise and blame dissolve together;\nColors immersed in the moonlit pool, self and other fade away.\nIn desire, yet without desire;\nDwelling in dust, yet unstained by dust.\nPassing through a thicket of a hundred flowers,\nNot a single robe is soiled.\n\nJǐngcén Huīshī:\nObstruction is not the wall,\nPassage is not empty space.\nIf one understands thus,\nMind and form are originally the same.\n\nHuìtáng Chánshī:\nThe foolish remove circumstances but not the mind,\nThe wise remove the mind but not circumstances.\nNot knowing circumstances are inherently thus,\nWherever the eye meets, one remains steadfast.\n\nNántái Héshàng:\nAt Nantai, sitting in stillness with a censer of incense,\nAll day long, serene, ten thousand cares forgotten.\nNot by stilling the mind or removing delusions,\nBut because there is nothing to ponder.\n\nZōng- Chánshī:\nFine jade hidden in rough stone,\nLotus flowers emerging from mud.\nKnow that within affliction,\nAwakening is bodhi.\n\nSome speak of emptiness only to break attachment to existence,\nYet existence is also used to remove emptiness.\nAgain, existence is used to end existence,\nEmptiness to dissolve emptiness—\nEven when words and speech are cut off,\nThought and path exhausted,\nIt cannot be called emptiness,\nHow then could it be named existence?\n\nZhòngxuān Chánshī:\nThe ordinary and sacred are originally not two,\nDelusion and awakening—how could their paths differ?\nNot that nirvana is to be rejoiced in,\nNor that birth and death are to be loathed.\nWith a single word of awakening,\nWithout rising or sitting, one realizes the unborn;\nWith a single thought turning the light inward,\nWithout taking a step, one pervades the sands of the world.\nResponding to stimuli, one communicates—\nLike moonlight reflected in water;\nIn stillness, one answers—\nLike an echo following sound in an empty valley.\n\nTo speak of Buddha-nature is emptiness,\nTo speak of Buddha-mind is reality.\nWith this real mind, Buddha-nature is not mere emptiness;\nWith this empty nature, Buddha-mind is not attached to form.\n\nShàowù Huīshī:\nPeak after peak, mountain beyond mountain,\nSitting atop the solitary summit, observe closely.\nClouds roll back, mist disperses, mountains grow still—\nThe vast Chu sky, a single gust of cold.\n\nZhìjiān Huīshī:\nThe radiance of the autumn moon\nIs seen only when the clamor ceases;\nThe sound of the cold spring\nIs heard only in deep meditation.\nThus, movement of thought loses awareness,\nCessation of thought merges with truth.\nPlanting the fruit of merit in the ear’s root,\nOpening the flower of awakening in the mind’s ground.\n\nThough conditioned things are false,\nPursuing them makes the Buddha-way hard to achieve;\nThough the unconditioned is true,\nClinging to it dims wisdom’s nature.\n\nGūfēng Zhǎnglǎo:\nIn daily use, nothing is not the Dao,\nPeace of mind is Chan.\nDwelling in secluded clouds and valleys,\nDreaming amidst snow and reeds.\n\nWéikuān Huīshī:\nThe true cultivator neither strives nor forgets;\nStriving approaches attachment,\nForgetting falls into ignorance.\nA thousand waves rise and break—\nThe nature of water remains;\nA thousand lamps light and extinguish—\nThe nature of fire is originally present.\n\nThe mind that forgets emotions does not abide in form,\nLike hot water melting ice—\nWater and ice both vanish, nothing to distinguish;\nThe mind that encounters circumstances cannot remain unmoved,\nLike a valley responding to sound—\nIt answers and ceases, leaving no residue.\n\nZōng- Huīshī:\nThe moon’s reflection in the autumn pool,\nThe bell’s toll in the quiet night—\nUnchanged despite repeated strikes,\nUndispersed though touched by waves.\n\nKāixiānzhào Chánshī:\nPeople’s minds do not cease,\nThoughts do not abide.\nIf one can cease where there is no ceasing,\nAnd have no thought where there is thought,\nOne naturally accords with the principle of the unborn.\n\nScattering one into ten thousand,\nThe moon sinks into ten thousand rivers—ten thousand reflections;\nGathering ten thousand into one,\nWater returns to a single vessel—only one moon.\nExpanding, it fills the Dharma-realm;\nContracting, not even a hair’s tip remains.\n\nYùquán Yuǎn Chánshī:\nOne seal imprints emptiness—\nTen thousand images gathered in the ancient mirror;\nOne seal imprints water—\nThe autumn toad’s shadow falls into a thousand rivers;\nOne seal imprints clay—\nObserve closely the patterns before they arise.\n\nBǎoníng Chánshī:\nThe three realms are only mind,\nThe ten thousand dharmas are only consciousness.\nClouds arise beyond the railing,\nRaindrops fall before the eaves.\nThe stream’s water deep as indigo,\nMountain flowers blooming like brocade.\nIf one does not investigate the root at this moment,\nOne will have to wait to ask Maitreya.\n\nFójiàn Chánshī:\nThe supreme Dao is not difficult,\nOnly avoid picking and choosing.\n\nThe peach blossoms red, the plum blossoms white—\nWho can merge them into one hue?\nThe purple swallow chitters, the yellow oriole sings—\nWho says their calls are but a single sound?\n\nA bright mirror stands before the dais—\nHow could it distinguish stillness from motion?\nA solitary cloud emerges from the peak—\nWhy cling to going or staying?\n\nFrom delusion, truth is spoken,\nYet truth has no inherent form;\nFrom truth, delusion arises,\nBut delusion’s essence is fundamentally empty.\nOnce delusion returns to emptiness,\nTruth, too, does not stand.\n\n**Chan Master Zhida:**\nWhen the mind establishes a realm, it exists;\nWhen the mind is void, no realm arises.\nWhen realm is empty and mind is still,\nThe mind illumines the realm with cool clarity.\nIn the ice-mirror, one sees one’s own image;\nIn the lamp-moon, one sees one’s own shadow;\nIn the mountain valley, one hears one’s own voice.\n\n**Chan Master Baiguizhao:**\nBirds flying through the void\nForget the void is their homeland;\nFish swimming in the water\nForget the water is their very life.\n\nAll of you, stand firmly here,\nFocus your spirit,\nTurn your light inward in a single thought—\nSuddenly, you will see yourself,\nNo different from the red sun in the sky!\nSpontaneously revolving, selfless,\nA bright pearl in the dish turns of itself.\n\n**Master Lin:**\nIts essence transcends mind and thought;\nIts purport surpasses past, present, and future.\nFree from the mind’s intentions,\nThe myriad forms show no distinction;\nBeyond past, present, and future,\nThe ten directions are utterly seamless.\nUnobstructed at the outset,\nThoroughly without reliance.\nAwakening lies before signs arise;\nApplication rests where no effort is made.\n\n**Master Zhaojue:**\nAdd a single thread—\nLike dust in the eye;\nRemove a single thread—\nLike carving flesh from the body.\nRely on the Dharma, not on people;\nRely on meaning, not on words;\nRely on wisdom, not on knowledge;\nRely on the understood meaning of scriptures,\nNot on the ununderstood.\n\nWhen cold, approach the fire;\nWhen hot, wave a fan;\nWhen hungry, eat;\nWhen tired, sleep.\nThus it is said:\nThe cypress before Master Zhaozhou’s hall,\nThe pines behind Xiangyan’s ridge—\nPlanted for no other purpose\nThan to summon the pure breeze.\n\n**Master Yunfeng Jun:**\nSlender bamboo and towering pines drip emerald fragrance,\nA gentle breeze and sparse moonlight pass through the chill.\nWho dwells in the old temple to the west?\nEach day, the bell’s toll sends off the setting sun.\n\nWind in the branches, moon on the islet—\nBoth convey the mind;\nMist-shrouded isles and cloud-wrapped forests—\nAll reveal the wondrous purport.\n\n**Venerable Baoji:**\nThe deluded body faces the mirror and sees its reflection—\nReflection and deluded body are no different.\nYet wishing to remove the reflection and keep the body,\nOne does not know the body, too, is fundamentally empty.\nBody and reflection are not distinct—\nNeither one nor the other can be held or abandoned.\nTo cling to one and discard the other\nIs to forever drift apart from true principle.\nLoving the sacred and hating the mundane,\nOne sinks and floats in the sea of birth and death.\nAfflictions arise from the mind—\nWithout mind, where would afflictions dwell?\nNo need to discriminate or grasp at forms—\nNaturally, the Dao is attained in an instant.\n\n**Chan Master Longya:**\nIn a dream, who knows the dream is false?\nOnly upon waking does one realize the dream was nothing.\nWhile deluded, it is just like events in a dream;\nAfter awakening, it is like rising from sleep.\n\nTo seek the ox, visit the frontier;\nTo learn the Dao, seek the mindless.\nWhen the ox is near, the mind is near—\nWithout mind, the Dao is easily found.\n\n**Chan Master Wenyì:**\nA single lotus bud,\nTwo slender green cypresses—\nWhy ask about lofty standards\nIn a monk’s garden?\n\n**Chan Master Tong’an:**\nBefore the withered tree crag, diverging paths abound;\nTravelers who reach this point all falter.\nThe egret stands in snow—no shared color;\nThe bright moon and reed flowers—nothing alike.\nWhen all is fully understood, nothing is understood;\nWhere mystery upon mystery unfolds, one must still ask why.\nDiligently I sing the song of the profound—\nCan the toad in the void grasp the moon’s light?\n\n**Monk of Yun Ding Mountain:**\nSitting idly, profoundly still—no sage knows,\nEven if one speaks, nothing compares to this.\nThe stone man claps a board in the clouds;\nThe water maiden plays a flute beneath the waves.\nIf you say you do not hear, you have not yet understood;\nIf you seek its echo, you will still doubt.\nI teach you to sing and respond—you must respond,\nBut do not ask about the notes of bamboo or silk.\n\n**Chan Master Danxia:**\nRecognize the treasure within your robe,\nAnd the drunkenness of ignorance will awaken of itself.\nThough the hundred bones dissolve,\nOne thing remains eternally numinous.\nKnow that realms are not the true essence;\nThe spirit-pearl has no fixed form.\nAwakened, one is a three-bodied Buddha;\nDeluded, one doubts even ten thousand scriptures.\nIn the mind, the mind can be fathomed;\nThrough the ear, the ear cannot hear.\nThe formless preceded heaven and earth;\nThe dark spring emerges from the profound.\nOriginally firm, it needs no forging;\nOriginally pure, it requires no settling.\nSpontaneously revolving like the sun at dawn,\nTranslucent like the morning star.\nAuspicious light flows unceasingly;\nTrue qi stirs and revives.\nReflecting, the hollow peaks are still;\nEncompassing, the Dharma-realm is bright.\nUnderstanding speech does not depend on the tongue;\nUttering words is not the same as sound.\nAt the farthest edge, vastness is stilled;\nWithout bounds, it equals the level void.\nSeeing the moon is not about observing the finger;\nReturning home requires no path.\nKnow the mind, and the mind is Buddha—\nWhat other Buddha could there be to attain?\n\n**Chan Master Tongzhi:**\nThe true self is originally present—\nDeluded, it seems absent;\nThe false self is originally nonexistent—\nGrasped, it appears to exist.\nTo understand the mind,\nThere is no mind to understand;\nThe mind that is not understood\nIs called the true mind.\nWhen truth and delusion interpenetrate,\nThe ordinary mind sees the Buddha-mind;\nWhen principle and practice are cultivated together,\nOne relies on original wisdom to seek Buddha-wisdom.\n\n**Master Chonghua Zan:**\nSealing emptiness, sealing clay, sealing water—\nOn level ground, cold waves fiercely rise.\nEven if one strives with utmost effort,\nIn the end, it is but a turtle dragging its tail.\n\n**Monk Dan Jiao’s Inscription on a Portrait:**\nDepicting form to see oneself—\nSeeing oneself, one harms the spirit.\nAlready a dream within a dream,\nFurther encountering a body beyond the body.\nWater flowers congeal into illusory substance;\nInk hues gather as empty dust.\nAlas, both you and I\nRemain unenlightened beings.\n\n**Master Zhu Anzhu:**\nDew glistens on green grass like jade;\nThe golden wind stirs the white duckweed.\nA single cry of a cold goose passes—\nAwakening one who has not yet awakened.\n\nLike the sun emitting flames, sharing redness with motes of dust—\nYet it is not truly red;\nLike water, clear and still, holding light clouds to share its greenness—\nYet it is not truly green.\n\n**Master Shan Gu:**\nThe lifeblood of the monk’s lineage,\nThe mind-essence of the ancient Buddhas.\n\nAs the moon of contention shines forth, ten thousand waves divide its reflection;\nAs the hair-splitting sword is wielded, a thousand miles see no man.\n\nDesire’s fire is quenched by precepts;\nFear’s fire is quenched by samādhi;\nThe fire of ignorance is quenched by wisdom.\n\nThe numinous spring flows ceaselessly, dissolving the heart’s vexation and restlessness;\nThe stream of wisdom trickles gently, irrigating the palace of purity and coolness.\n\nA thousand rivers hold water—one moon of treasure mirrors the cold pool;\nTen thousand hearths hold no smoke—the golden wind blows across every face.\n\n**Master Shan Tangfu:**\nBurying a callus on a fingertip, plucking a single hair to move nine oxen.\nMount Hua stretches green to the heavens; the Yellow River flows clear to its depths.\nCut off the pointing finger, swiftly turn the gaze—\nBeneath the green bamboo hat, endless affairs;\nWithin the green straw cloak, all at once still.\n\n**Master Juehai Hui:**\nThe azure vault contends with no clouds; the autumn sky holds a bright moon.\nThe Long River gleams like silk; the clear wind comes without cease.\nA Daoist in the forest’s shade, gazing in shared delight.\nThough still within the gate of teaching and transformation—\nWhat then is the Daoist’s own affair?\nLeisurely on stone, watching flowing water,\nWishing to wash the Chan robe, yet finding no dust.\n\n**Master Linji:**\nA thought of doubt—earth comes to bind;\nA thought of love—water comes to drown;\nA thought of fear—fire comes to burn;\nA thought of joy—wind comes to scatter.\nIf one can discern thus, not turned by circumstances,\nOne may use circumstances everywhere.\nYet once it touches the lips, it falls into meaning;\nEven if thoroughly liberated, one remains in sinking and drowning.\n\nAll day eating rice, yet never biting a single grain;\nAll day wearing clothes, yet never hanging a single thread.\nOnly then can one transform the great earth into gold,\nChurn the long river into ghee.\n\n**Master Fa:**\nThe Dharmakāya is without form—it cannot be sought through sound;\nThe wondrous Dao is without words—it cannot be grasped through script.\nEven if one surpasses buddhas and ancestors, one still falls on the steps;\nEven if one speaks of the subtle and profound, one remains entangled in layers of teeth.\nOnly when merit leaves no trace, when shadows leave no residue,\nWhen withered trees and cold cliffs hold no moisture,\nWhen the illusory person and wooden horse are empty of conceptual thought—\nOnly then can one lower the hand to enter the marketplace,\nTurn the body to take on other forms.\nYet one does not say: in the land of no outflows, one cannot stay,\nAnd so returns to the cold sands beyond the misty cove.\n\n**Master Conglun:**\nLike a bright pearl in the palm—\nWhen Hu comes, it appears as Hu; when Han comes, it appears as Han.\nTaking a blade of grass as the sixteen-foot golden body,\nUsing a blade of grass as a blade of grass.\n\n**Master Zhiming Hui’s Inscription on a Portrait:**\nTwice washed, the pale red peach blossoms soften;\nThe wind sways the light green willow threads.\nWithin the shadow of white clouds, strange rocks emerge;\nAmid the gleam of green waters, ancient trees stand clear.\n\nAlas!\n\nWho are you?\n**Master Muzheng:**\nBlossoms unfurl on jeweled branches,\nWillows burst forth along the embankment.\nThe yellow warbler tunes Ji Shuye’s zither,\nFragrant grasses enter Xie Gong’s verses.\n\nWhy must one see form to clarify the mind,\nHear sound to awaken to the Dao?\nNot only is this like seeking vomit upon the water—\nIt is already dust in the eye.\n\nIn delusion, one must rely on the Three Vehicles’ teachings;\nAfter awakening, one knows there is not even a single word.\n**Master Duochong:**\nA concave mirror makes one appear gaunt,\nA convex mirror makes one appear stout.\nBetter to shatter the mirror\nAnd restore my original face.\n\n**Master Duanji:**\nThought does not cease by forgetting dust,\nDust is not forgotten by ceasing thought.\nForget dust, yet ceasing ceases nothing;\nCease thought, yet forgetting forgets nothing.\n\nGreat delusion is not foolishness,\nEmerging truth is not wisdom.\nLife’s delusory name is real;\nConfusion of truth is called delusion.\nHow could delusion transform into truth by following folly,\nOr truth revert to delusion by pursuing wisdom?\nFolly and wisdom differ of themselves!\n\nThus Master Guan observed:\nDelusion arises from confusing truth;\nAwakening to truth halts delusion.\n\nWhen principle is clear, speech is cut off—\nWhat words could discuss it?\nWhen the intent is grasped, the mind’s activity ceases—\nWhat observation could contemplate it?\n\nThus Tiantai said:\nThe mouth seeks to speak but words fail,\nThe mind seeks to think but thought vanishes.\nAll dharmas merge in emptiness,\nAll thoughts extinguish in stillness.\nOriginally not existent—\nWho would insist on calling it nonexistent?\n\nWhat clamor is there to clamor?\nWhat silence is there to silence?\nIf one knows that self and other are mysteriously one,\nThen there is no place that is not a bodhimandala.\nWhy chase after clamor among the crowd,\nOr scatter solitude in empty valleys?\n\nThose who seek stillness through movement\nAre like monks who love to twist willow branches;\nThose who seek kinship by fleeing enmity\nAre like those who loathe cages yet delight in pens.\n\nIf one knows knowing as stillness,\nThis is not knowing without cause—\nLike a hand grasping a *ruyi*,\nIt is not a hand without a *ruyi*.\nIf one knows self-knowing,\nThis is also not knowing without cause—\nLike a hand making a fist,\nIt is not a hand that is not a fist.\n\nNeither knowing stillness nor self-knowing,\nYet not without knowledge—\nThe self-nature is inherently luminous.\nThus it differs from wood and stone.\n\nThe hand does not grasp a *ruyi*,\nNor does it make a fist,\nYet it is not without a hand—\nThe hand rests naturally,\nThus it differs from a rabbit’s horn.\n\nNo afflictions to remove in the past,\nNo self-nature to guard in the present,\nNo Buddha to become in the future—\nThis is called the severance of the three times,\nThe purification of the three karmas.\n\nThe moment I raise a thought, it already belongs to the past;\nBefore I raise a thought, it is still the future.\nThe future mind is not the past mind—\nWhere, then, is the present mind?\n\nIf the scholar knows that the instant a thought arises,\nIt is already unattainable—\nA thing of the past, the past is empty,\nThe future is also void—\nThen the future Buddha is the present Buddha,\nFor thoughts do not abide in the present.\nThought after thought aligns—\nThought after thought becomes Buddha.\nThis is the first expedient gate.\n\n**Master Huiri:**\nA single stride outshines the Four Seas,\nA single fist topples Mount Sumeru.\n\nThe ranks of Buddhas and Patriarchs cannot retain him—\nAgain he blows the fish-pipe, moored at Luoyang Bay.\nNo need to seek the mind, only to still perceptions.\n\nThough the Third Patriarch evaded the golden hook,\nUnawares he had already swallowed the red coin.\nHuiri is not so: no seeking truth, no stilling perceptions—\nRiding backward on an ox, he enters the Buddha Hall,\nA single note from the herdsman’s flute and heaven-and-earth expand.\nBowing to that yellow-faced Dharma-true one.\n\nLayman Budai:\nI have a cloth sack,\nEmpty, unobstructed by space.\nUnfurled, it pervades the ten directions;\nFolded, it reveals freedom.\n\nA single bowl gathers meals from a thousand homes,\nA lone body roams ten thousand miles.\nFew with clear eyes see me—\nI ask the way of the white clouds’ heads.\n\nMaster Baiyang Shun:\nGood things come heaped and piled,\nNo need to contrive or arrange.\nYellow leaves fall in the forest, swept away by water;\nWhite clouds in the ravine, rolled back by wind.\n\nA single cry from a cold goose severs the thread of longing,\nThe frost-bell’s first toll shatters my mountain.\nYet Baiyang has a way beyond others—\nAll night he pokes dead ashes in the cold brazier.\n\nMonk Run:\nIllusion dissolved, truth returned, ten thousand burdens empty,\nThe river-sands of beings and sages are originally the same.\nDeluded, all are moths plunging into flame;\nAwakened, they are cranes freed from the cage.\n\nA slice of moonlight divides its shadow among a thousand ravine streams,\nA lone pine’s voice endures the winds of the four seasons.\nOnly when heart after heart seals in perfect accord\nDoes one awaken from the lifelong sleep of dreams.\n\nMaster Huanglong:\nAll the ancients’ expedient means\nOpen a single path for all people.\n\nHaving found the path of entry, one must seek the path of exit.\nTo climb a mountain, reach its summit;\nTo enter the sea, plumb its depths.\nClimb not to the summit, and you will not know the vastness of the cosmos;\nPlumb not the depths, and you will not know the abyss of the deep blue sea.\nOnce you know its breadth and depth,\nWith a single stride you cross the four great seas,\nWith a single strike you topple Mount Sumeru.\nLet go and arrive home—none recognize you,\nAs magpies clamor and crows cry in the cypress tree.\n\nMaster Anpi:\nA solitary peak stands aloof, untangled by vines.\nA slice of moon traverses the sky, white clouds drift freely.\nSeeing one’s nature, do not cling to Buddha;\nAwakening to the Dao, do not rely on a master.\nBefore the eye-root’s dust:\nAs objects seen in dreams, as images beheld in illusion;\nBefore the ear-root’s dust:\nAs wind heard in empty space, as the cries of birds;\nBefore the mind-root’s dust:\nAs ice and snow melting in hot water, as gold and iron smelted in fire.\n\nMaster Zizai:\n“Mind is Buddha” is a remedy for those without illness;\n“Not mind, not Buddha” is a cure for the afflicted.\nDispel delusion without extinguishing illumination,\nGuard stillness without clinging to emptiness.\nPractice with constancy, and true vision will naturally arise.\nClinging to emptiness while rejecting form—\nHow can one attain neither form nor emptiness?\nDwelling in non-being while rejecting being—\nHow can one speak of neither being nor non-being?\n\nMaster Wunian:\nThought is not inherently existent, nor must it be absent.\nOne who understands this principle is called “thoughtless.”\nAs a lost traveler mistakes east for west,\nThough direction does not change, ignorance deludes.\nSo too is mind called “thought,” though mind itself does not move.\nFreedom from entanglement is liberation;\nRemoving afflictions brings purity.\nSeeing the five aggregates as empty is profound prajñā;\nAttaining the quiescence of one mind is great nirvana.\n\nMaster Damao:\nTo know the nature of all buddhas,\nSeek it within the conduct of sentient beings;\nTo know the undecaying nature,\nSeek it amid the flux of the ten thousand things.\nThe mind that seeks to cease thought stirs more vexation.\nIf you know that knowing is fundamentally empty,\nKnowing itself becomes the gateway to all wonders.\n\nMaster Congyue:\nHow clear the ears and eyes,\nDwelling in the secluded valley.\nAutumn wind enters the ancient pine,\nAutumn moon rises over the cold waters.\nThe monk who seeks truth here is deluded—\nTwo gibbons dangle their four tails.\nIntrinsic nature is no-thing;\nNo-thing is called quiescence.\nYet people chase after sense-objects,\nThoughts following one after another,\nUnable to quiesce in the present moment.\nTurn the light around, return the gaze—\nThe original landscape flashes before you,\nAnd the one vanishes, the six dissolve.\n\nMaster Xingkong:\nTo forget both mind and dharma is still to linger in delusion;\nTo transcend both form and dust is yet to leave traces of dust.\nA hundred birds do not come, spring passes again—\nWho is the one dwelling in the hermitage?\n\nTruth and convention both extinguished, the two truths remain;\nEmptiness and being both forgotten, the one taste is ever manifest.\nFor true emptiness is never without being,\nAnd being is discerned as illusory through emptiness.\nBeing is never without emptiness,\nAnd emptiness clarifies being.\nEmptiness that is not empty is emptiness without annihilation;\nBeing that is not being is being without permanence.\nThe four attachments once extinguished, the hundred negations are dispelled.\n\nMaster Shui’an:\nTo hide the body is neither near nor far;\nTo cast off the body is to be without reliance, yet perfectly at ease.\nThe ancient mirror needs no polishing to reflect itself,\nAs mist and smoke gently moisten the autumn light.\nTo realize emptiness is to become real;\nTo grasp the self is to become hollow.\nApply medicine to match the illness;\nWhen there is no illness, remove the medicine.\n\nMaster Changqing:\nThe gateway to the Dao requires the two methods of cessation and contemplation.\nPrinciple-obstacles obstruct right knowledge and vision;\nAffair-obstacles perpetuate the cycle of birth and death.\nWithout the method of great contemplation, how can principle-obstacles be removed?\nWithout the method of great cessation, how can affair-obstacles be overcome?\nThrough mind one awakens to the Dao, yet the Dao is not mind;\nThrough the eye one attains clarity, yet clarity is not the eye.\nCut off delusive thoughts and abandon attachments—\nTrace back to what is not to see inherent nature and realize the Tathāgata.\nTrace back to what is—\nBy what is not, liberate from all fetters;\nBy what is, illuminate all darkness,\nAnd it is the great sun of wisdom.\n\nMaster Yuanjue:\nTo dispel delusion in pursuit of awakening\nIs to mistake delusion for the hammer that forges awakening.\n\nClinging to the sacred while despising the mundane,\nOne fails to see the mundane as the crucible that refines the sacred.\nWhen sacred and mundane both dissolve, delusion and awakening both forgotten—\nHow then to speak of midnight’s rosy clouds adorning jade elephants,\nOr dawn’s five-colored mists veiling the mountain peak?\n\nMaster Huangyao:\nWhen the sun rises, light pervades the world,\nYet empty space is never illuminated;\nWhen the sun sets, darkness pervades the world,\nYet empty space is never darkened.\nThe realms of light and dark contend and vie,\nWhile empty space’s nature remains vast and self-abiding.\nThe mind of buddhas and sentient beings is likewise.\n\nIf one perceives buddhas as pure, radiant forms of light,\nAnd sentient beings as defiled, dim, and dull—\nEven after kalpas as numerous as Ganges’ sands,\nEnlightenment will never be attained.\nOrdinary people all follow conditions to generate the mind;\nIf one wishes to be free of conditions, one must forget the mind.\nWhen the mind is forgotten, conditions dissolve;\nWhen conditions dissolve, delusion ceases.\nSeeing good approach, there is no joyful heart;\nFacing myriad evil forms, there is no aversion.\nOnly when the mind is forgotten, merging with the Dharma-realm,\nDoes one attain true freedom.\n\nMind without absence is called illumination;\nDesire without extinction is called forgetting.\nForgetting and illumination are one yet two,\nTwo yet one.\nWhen forgetting, the mind is serene,\nYet never fails to illuminate;\nWhen illuminating, not even a mote of dust arises,\nYet never fails to forget.\nThis is true forgetting, true illumination.\n\nScholar Zhang Zhuo\n\nThe radiant light silently illumines across the Ganges’ sands,\nAll beings—ordinary and sacred—dwell within my home.\nThe moment a single thought does not arise, the whole body manifests;\nThe instant the six senses stir, clouds obscure the view.\n\nSevering afflictions only breeds new illness,\nPursuing true suchness is ever delusion.\nFollowing conditions without clinging yields no attainment—\nNirvāṇa and saṃsāra are but empty flowers.\n\nMaster Nanhua Yu\n\nSeeking birth when birth itself is unborn,\nFearing extinction when extinction is but momentary.\nEyes’ seeing falls short of ears’ hearing,\nMouth’s speech cannot match the nose’s telling.\nGrasping the moon in water, seeking the head in a mirror,\nCarving the boat to find the sword, riding the ox to seek the ox.\nEmpty flowers and mirages, dreams and illusions—\nWith a single stroke, let them all go; when you wish to cease, cease at once.\n\nAlready singing village songs of wine and fields,\nWhere there seems no elegance, elegance arises of itself.\n\nBuddha and sentient beings—\nOriginally without distinction.\nThe awakened mind turns things,\nAnd all things return to mind: this is the Buddhas.\nThe deluded mind turns toward things,\nBlindly following their course: this is sentient beings.\n\nWu Gouzi\n\nAll Buddhas of the three times reside within this very body,\nYet obscured by qi’s habits and turned by external realms, one loses the way.\nIf within the mind there is no mind, this is the past Buddha;\nAbiding in stillness, unmoved—this is the future Buddha;\nResponding to conditions, adapting to things—this is the present Buddha;\nPure and undefiled—this is the Buddha of Purity;\nEntering and exiting without attachment—this is the Buddha of Spiritual Powers;\nRoaming freely everywhere—this is the Buddha of Freedom;\nThe mind undimmed—this is the Buddha of Light;\nThe Dao-mind firm—this is the Indestructible Buddha;\nTransforming in myriad ways, yet ever the One True.\n\nDharma Master Fachang\n\nThe Buddha comes from non-action,\nAnd to non-action returns.\nThe Dharmakāya equals empty space,\nAbiding where the mind is absent.\nThoughts return to no-thought,\nDwelling returns to no-dwelling.\nComing for the sake of sentient beings,\nGoing for the sake of sentient beings.\nThe pure ocean of true suchness,\nIts essence ever still and constant.\nLet the wise reflect deeply—\nNo more doubts should arise.\n\nThe Buddha’s body is fundamentally non-action,\nYet deluded feelings falsely discriminate.\nThe Dharmakāya equals empty space,\nNever having birth or extinction.\nWith conditions, the Buddha appears in the world;\nWithout conditions, the Buddha enters extinction.\nEverywhere transforming sentient beings,\nLike the moon reflected in water.\nNeither eternal nor annihilated,\nNeither born nor extinguished.\nBirth has never been born,\nExtinction has never been extinguished.\nWhen insight penetrates the profound,\nNaturally, no dharma can be spoken.\n\nBao’en Yi Gong\n\nYanruo Dadu, mistaking his reflection for his head—\nwas he not carrying his head in search of his head?\nWhen truly deluded, the head was never lost;\nupon awakening, nothing was gained.\nWhy? Because delusion calls it loss,\nawakening calls it gain.\nGain and loss lie with the person—\nwhat do they have to do with movement or stillness?\n\nQingliang Guoshi\nThe supreme Dao originates in the heart-mind;\nthe heart-mind’s dharma abides in non-abiding.\nThe non-abiding heart’s essence and appearance are quiescent,\nneither existent nor empty, neither arising nor ceasing.\nSought, it cannot be grasped;\nabandoned, it cannot be parted from.\nWhen deluded by the present moment, confusion and suffering arise in profusion;\nwhen awakened to true nature, emptiness and clarity pervade all.\nThough \"the heart-mind is the Buddha,\"\nonly those who realize it know this.\nYet to have realization and knowledge\nis for the sun of wisdom to sink into the realm of being;\nif there is no illumination and no awakening,\nthen dark clouds obscure the gate of emptiness.\nOnly when not a single thought arises\nare past and future cut off, illumination stands alone,\nand all things—self and other—are thus.\nNo delusion or awakening remains to depend on the opposition of truth and illusion.\nTo seek truth by eliminating illusion\nis like chasing a shadow and exhausting the body.\nTo realize illusion as truth\nis like resting in shade and stilling the shadow.\nIf the heart-mind does not illumine illusion,\nthen illusory thoughts are entirely relinquished.\nIf one abides in effortless quiescent knowing,\nthen all actions naturally arise.\nThus, awakening is quiescence without quiescence,\ntrue knowing is knowing without knowing.\nWith the non-dual heart-mind of knowing and quiescence,\none accords with the wondrous principle of empty and existent fused.\nNon-abiding, non-attachment,\nneither grasped nor contained,\nright and wrong both forgotten,\nsubject and object both transcended—\neven this transcendence is quiescent,\nand prajñā manifests before one.\nHeart-mind after heart-mind becomes Buddha;\nthere is no heart-mind that is not the Buddha’s heart-mind.\nEverywhere the Dao is realized;\nthere is no dust that is not the Buddha-land.\nThus, illusion and truth, self and other—\ngrasp one and all are gathered.\nHeart-mind, Buddha, sentient beings—\nall are undifferentiated and equal.\nKnow this:\nWhen deluded, people follow dharmas,\nand though the ten thousand dharmas differ, people are not the same.\nWhen awakened, dharmas follow people,\nand though each person has one wisdom, all realms are fused.\nWords exhausted, thoughts ceased—\nwhat is cause, what is effect?\nThe essence is fundamentally still and solitary—\nwho is the same, who is different?\nOnly by forgetting concerns and becoming empty and bright,\nby merging and harmonizing in tranquility,\ndoes one resemble the moon’s reflection in water—\nempty yet visible;\nthe mirror of the heart-mind without thought—\nilluminating yet ever empty.\n\nFazhen Chanshi\nWillow hues hold mist, spring’s beauty returns;\na solitary peak stands tall, myriad blossoms vie in splendor.\nWhite clouds drift aimlessly, no heart-mind remains;\nall around, green mountains remain fundamentally unmoved.\nThe fisherman casts his line—\na stream’s chill hue never fades;\nthe wild ferry lies empty—\nfor ten thousand ages, the emerald pool is clear as a mirror.\nShadow follows form, echo follows sound—\nto remove afflictions and seek nirvana is like leaving the body behind.\n\nXiming Chanshi\nLeaves scatter from the forest, heaven and earth herald early autumn.\nWhat need to distinguish the intent of the Western Patriarch\nor seek further?\nIf one deeply understands this principle\nand thoroughly penetrates its source,\none knows that all activity and stillness, conduct and repose,\nwalking, standing, sitting, lying—\neach accords with the Dao,\nevery thought turns toward its origin.\nDid the Patriarch not say:\nDelusion gives rise to stillness and disturbance;\nawakening has no preference, no aversion.\nGain and loss, right and wrong—\nall are cast aside at once.\nThen who is right, who is wrong?\nWho is deluded, who is awakened?\nIt is only people who generate peculiar views,\nobserving great and small, grasping being and non-being.\nThe solitary radiance of the spiritual root\nrefuses to bear witness;\nthe solitary fullness of the heart-moon\ncreates its own opposition—\nhow is this different from abandoning one’s father at home\nor forgetting the pearl within one’s robe?\nThus, on the path of bodhi, thorns grow into forests;\nin the emptiness of liberation, delusive clouds obscure the sun.\n\nDoushuai Chanshi\n\nBeneath Dragon Peace Mountain, roads crisscross;\nWithin the Tushita Palace, pavilions rise in layers.\nThough not of heaven, nor of the human realm,\nthose who arrive find peace, all thoughts forgotten.\nThe skillful walker moves not both feet;\nthe skillful entrant stirs not the double doors—\nnaturally they scorn the dust of dreams,\nheedless of time dissolving in stillness.\nYet even so, I ask: is there still a matter beyond?\n\nWu Gen Jiu Ri says:\n*Let not the stone before the cliff be cast down,\nto shatter the clouds that shade the world below.*\n\nChan Master Daoying\n\nTo speak of the Dao: speech is not permitted,\nsilence is not permitted.\nEven if speech and silence are both forgotten,\nit remains untouched.\nWhy?\nThe radiance of the ancient Buddhas,\nthe grace of the former worthies—\neach emerges from desirelessness, from non-reliance.\nAt times, solitary and sheer, towering beyond grasp;\nat times, all-embracing, merged beyond perception—\nnever fixed in one place,\nnever bound to either end.\nNo right, no wrong;\nno \"is,\" no \"is not.\"\nGain brings no gain,\nloss brings no loss.\nNot a hairbreadth apart,\nnot a strand of hair altered.\nThe ancient path, luminous and clear,\nbelongs not to the subtle or profound.\nSeen face-to-face, it is grasped and gone in an instant,\nneither abiding in the central place\nnor straying onto crooked paths.\nNot pursuing great or small,\nhow could it tread narrow trails?\nTurning back, none is met;\nfacing forward, none is matched.\nA single thought surveys all—\nvast, empty, still.\n\nThis essential teaching\nthe thousand sages do not transmit.\nDirectly knowing it,\none transcends in the very place.\n\nThus, to conceive of it as bare and unadorned is easy;\nto conceive of it as bright and distinct is hard.\nIf these are the hands and feet of one’s original portion,\nlet go what cannot be reclaimed.\nEach emits light, each manifests signs,\neach severs near and far, cuts through entanglement.\nOn the pivot of the moment, nothing lingers;\nin speech, nothing is revealed.\nThoroughly stirred, it cannot be muddied;\nstruck whole, it cannot be shattered.\nIn the end—what is it?\nSo wondrous!\nSo extraordinary!\n\nFriends in the Dao, do not seek to recognize its face,\nnor fix it with a name,\nnor search for its dwelling place.\nWhy?\nIt has no dwelling place,\nno name,\nno face.\nThe moment you pursue it with a single thought,\nyou are separated by ten lives, five lives—\nbetter to let it be free:\nwhen it arises, it arises;\nwhen it abides, it abides.\nThen \"natural\" is not natural,\n\"thusness\" is not thusness,\n\"profound stillness\" is not profound stillness,\n\"decay\" is not decay.\nNo birth to cling to, no death to fear,\nno Buddha to seek, no demon to spread.\nIt does not meet with bodhi,\ndoes not dwell with affliction,\naccepts no dharma,\nrejects no dharma.\nNo place, yet nowhere absent;\nneither apart nor not apart.\nIf you can be thus,\nyou see Śākyamuni as Śākyamuni,\nDharma as Dharma.\n\nMaster Huì of Táiwèn:\nThe eighty-four thousand gates of pāramitā stand ever open;\nthe buddhas of the three thousand great thousand worlds,\neach and every one, expound the Dharma.\nThey do not speak of being,\ndo not speak of nonbeing,\ndo not speak of neither being nor nonbeing,\ndo not speak of both being and nonbeing.\nWhy?\nBeyond the four propositions, beyond the hundred negations.\nWhen you meet it, few raise their eyes to know.\n\nYesterday’s frost-laden wind leaked its tidings,\nyet plum blossoms still adorn the cold branches.\n\nMaster Huì of Huìlín:\nNot environment, nor mind—\ncall it Buddha, and it sinks from sight.\nWithin it, no ranks exist from the outset;\nbeware of seeking where no ranks are found.\nSeek not at all, and the fault runs deeper still.\nShatter the Cloud Gate rice-sack,\nthen you’ll know red earth as gold.\n\n*Wúshēng Juéjīng* (concluded)\n\nOn an auspicious day of

      "translated_text": "**The Scripture of Non-Arising**\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of Union with Arising* (alternatively, *The Scripture of the Unborn*)\n**Author:** Anonymous\n**Volume:** One\n**Source:** *Supplement to the Daoist Canon*, Huai section\n\n---\n\n**Śākyamuni Buddha:**\nThe Dharma is fundamentally without Dharma,\nYet the Dharma-less Dharma is also Dharma.\nNow, when the Dharma-less is transmitted,\nHow can Dharma meet with Dharma?\n\n**Mahākāśyapa the Venerable:**\nDharmas are originally twofold Dharma,\nYet without Dharma, there is no non-Dharma.\nWhy, within a single Dharma,\nDo some see Dharma and others not?\n\n**Śāṇavāsa the Venerable:**\nIt is neither Dharma nor mind,\nWithout mind, there is no Dharma.\nWhen speaking of mind-Dharma,\nThis Dharma is not mind-Dharma.\n\n**Upagupta the Venerable:**\nThe mind is originally the mind,\nThe original mind is not a Dharma.\nIf there is Dharma, there is the original mind,\nYet it is neither mind nor original Dharma.\n\n**Dhṛṭaka the Venerable:**\nWhen you recognize the nature of mind,\nIt may be called the inconceivable.\nYet when fully realized, nothing is attained—\nWhen attained, it cannot be spoken or known.\n\n**Great Master Bodhidharma:**\nIn the womb, it is the body;\nIn the world, it is the person.\nIn the eye, it is seeing;\nIn the ear, it is hearing;\nIn the nose, it discerns fragrance;\nIn the mouth, it engages in discourse;\nIn the hands, it grasps and holds;\nIn the feet, it moves and runs.\nPervading and encompassing the Dharma-realm,\nIt is gathered into a single mote of dust.\nThose who recognize it know it as Buddha-nature;\nThose who do not call it the spirit-soul.\n\nIt does not see evil and generate aversion,\nNor observe goodness and strive for it.\nIt does not abandon wisdom to approach foolishness,\nNor cast off delusion to attain awakening.\nIt transcends measure in penetrating the Great Dao,\nAnd surpasses bounds in comprehending the Buddha-mind.\nNot entangled with ordinary or sacred,\nIt is called \"uncovered\" in its transcendent state.\n\nWhen deluded, people pursue Dharma;\nWhen awakened, Dharma follows people.\nAwakened, one recognizes that perception encompasses form;\nDeluded, form encompasses perception.\nMerely by the mind’s discrimination,\nCalculations arise from the mind itself.\nAll measurements are but dreams—\nIf you recognize the mind’s original quiescence,\nWithout a single stirring thought,\nThis is called true awakening.\n\n**Great Master Sengcan:**\nThough flowers are sown in the earth,\nFrom the earth, the flower-seed grows.\nIf no one plants the seed,\nNeither flower nor earth arises.\n\nThe supreme Dao is not difficult,\nOnly avoid picking and choosing.\nSimply do not love or hate,\nAnd all becomes perfectly clear.\nRound and equal to the great void,\nNothing lacking, nothing in excess.\nTruly, it is through grasping and rejecting\nThat one falls short.\nDo not chase after existence,\nNor cling to the endurance of emptiness.\nMaintain a single, even mind,\nAnd all distinctions naturally dissolve.\n\nTo halt movement is to return to movement,\nYet halting only increases movement.\nClinging to either side,\nHow can one know the singular?\nIf the singular is not penetrated,\nBoth sides lose their efficacy.\nAbandoning existence and non-existence,\nOne turns from emptiness to oppose emptiness.\nReturning to the root, one grasps the essence,\nBut following illumination, one loses the source.\nA moment of turning inward\nSurpasses all prior emptiness.\nThe transformation of prior emptiness\nArises from deluded perception.\nDo not seek the real—\nOnly cease to hold views.\n\nFrom duality arises oneness,\nYet even oneness must not be grasped.\nWhen the mind does not arise,\nThe myriad dharmas are without fault.\nWithout fault, there is no Dharma;\nWithout arising, there is no mind.\nWhen the subject vanishes, the object sinks;\nThe object follows the subject’s submersion.\nThe object arises from the subject,\nThe subject from the object.\nTo know these two aspects\nIs to see they are originally one emptiness.\nOne emptiness unites the two,\nEqually containing all phenomena.\n\nThe wise are without action,\nThe foolish bind themselves.\nDharma is not a different Dharma—\nDelusion arises from clinging.\nTo employ the mind to use the mind,\nIs this not a great error?\n\nDelusion gives rise to quiet and disturbance;\nAwakening is without good or evil.\nAll dualities\nMust be carefully weighed.\nDreams, illusions, and empty flowers—\nWhy labor to grasp them?\nGain and loss, right and wrong—\nLet them all be released at once.\n\nIf the eye does not sleep,\nAll dreams vanish of themselves.\nIf the mind does not differ,\nThe myriad dharmas are one thusness.\n\nTo halt movement is not movement,\nTo halt stillness is not stillness.\nIf the two cannot be established,\nHow can the one exist?\nThe one is all,\nAll is the one.\nIf you can be thus,\nWhy worry about incompletion?\n\nAll is the precepts of the self-nature,\nAll is the wisdom of unimpeded self-nature.\nNeither increasing nor diminishing, it is the vajra of self-nature;\nDeparting and arriving, it is the samādhi of the original body.\nNot seeing a single Dharma yet abiding in non-seeing\nIs like floating clouds obscuring the face of the sun.\nNot knowing a single Dharma yet clinging to empty knowing\nIs like lightning flashing in the great void.\nWhen such knowing and seeing fleetingly arise,\nHow can one mistakenly recognize them as expedient means?\nYou should, in a single thought, know your own error—\nYour own numinous light is ever manifest.\n\n**Great Master Hongren:**\nSentient beings sow the seed,\nAnd from the ground, the fruit arises.\nThe insentient have no seed,\nThus, without nature, there is no arising.\n\n**Great Master Lu Neng:**\nFundamentally, bodhi has no tree,\nNor is the bright mirror a stand.\nOriginally, there is not a single thing—\nWhere could dust alight?\n\nWhen the mind is deluded, the *Lotus Sutra* turns;\nWhen the mind awakens, it turns the *Lotus Sutra*.\nReciting the sutra for long without understanding\nMakes it an enemy of its meaning.\n\nWithout thought, thought is correct;\nWith thought, thought becomes deviant.\nNeither calculating existence nor non-existence,\nOne eternally rides the white ox cart.\n\nSamādhi is the essence of wisdom,\nWisdom is the function of samādhi.\nAt the time of wisdom, samādhi is in wisdom;\nAt the time of samādhi, wisdom is in samādhi.\nLike the light of a lamp—\nWith the lamp, there is light;\nWithout the lamp, there is darkness.\nThe lamp is the essence of light,\nLight is the function of the lamp.\nThough the names are two,\nTheir essence is not different.\n\nTo seek to see the Buddha,\nOnly recognize sentient beings.\nIt is only because sentient beings are deluded about the Buddha,\nNot because the Buddha is deluded about sentient beings.\nIf the self-nature awakens,\nSentient beings are the Buddha;\nIf the self-nature is deluded,\nThe Buddha is sentient beings.\nWhen the self-nature is equanimous,\nSentient beings are the Buddha;\nWhen the self-nature is biased,\nThe Buddha is sentient beings.\n\nThe Buddha is in my own mind—\nMy own Buddha is the true Buddha.\nIf I myself lack the Buddha-mind,\nWhere can the true Buddha be sought?\nThus, the sutra says:\nWhen the mind arises, the myriad dharmas arise;\nWhen the mind ceases, the myriad dharmas cease.\n\nThe ordinary person is the Buddha,\nAfflictions are bodhi.\nThe prior thought deluded is the ordinary person;\nThe subsequent thought awakened is the Buddha.\nThe prior thought attached to conditions is affliction;\nThe subsequent thought detached from conditions is bodhi.\n\n**Chan Master Farong:**\nConditions have no beauty or ugliness—\nBeauty and ugliness arise from the mind.\nIf the mind does not impose names,\nWhere can deluded thoughts arise?\nWhen deluded thoughts do not arise,\nThe true mind functions freely.\n\n**Chan Master Huizhong**",

effortless effort, effort is applied—\nLike fruit ripening naturally red,\nAsk not how to cultivate or plant.\n\n**Master Jigong of Panshan:**\nThe mind-moon stands alone, perfectly round,\nIts light embracing the ten thousand images.\nThe light does not illuminate objects,\nNor do objects exist.\nWhen both light and objects are forgotten,\nWhat remains?\n\n**Master Haigong of Dazhu:**\nIf one

Jianzhen:**\nThe eye’s light fades with colors,\nThe ear’s perception vanishes with sounds.\nTo return to the source—no other meaning,\nYesterday and today the same.\n\n**Master Mi of Jiashan:**\nThe mind is originally Buddha—\nWhen thoughts arise, one drifts and sinks.\nThe shore does not move,\nYet the boat races swiftly.\n\n**Master Bei of Xuansha:**\nThe mirror reflects all images,\nIts

different,\nYet three people see it differently.\nUnderstanding this as unreal,\nOne forever rides the white ox cart.\n\n**Master Bai of Fayun:**\nLi Zhu with intent—\nWhite waves surge in vain;\nXiang Wang without mind—\nThe bright pearl suddenly in hand.\n\n**Master Shou of Yongming:**\nLike the wish-fulfilling jewel that follows colors,\nAll forms appear yet the original body remains

lamp burns low at midnight.\nWho can comprehend this scene at this moment?\nA meditating monk in the depths of white clouds.\n\nThe true mind’s essence\nCannot be expressed in words.\nLimpid as boundless empty space,\nLuminous as a flawless mirror.\n\nPraise and blame do not reach it,\nPrinciple and reason cannot fathom it.\nIt cannot be exhausted by existence or nonexistence,\nNor can its wondrous body be discoursed upon by knowledge or wisdom.\nOnly those who enter it know it in their hearts.\n\nLike grinding ten thousand ingredients into incense—\nOne speck of dust already contains all fragrances;\nLike bathing in the great sea—\nA single handful of water already uses all rivers.\n\nWhen seeing nature, nature is originally free—\nThoughts are not thoughts to be removed.\nWhen observing things, things are originally nonexistent—\nForms are not things to be dispelled.\n\nEyes full of sights, ears full of sounds,\nNeither following nor destroying—\nOnly then does one understand the true nature of sights and sounds.\nIf one falls into the gate of sounds and forms,\nOne falls into the realm of ordinary beings;\nIf one destroys the appearances of sounds and forms,\nOne enters the lesser vehicle.\n\nThus the Tathāgata’s true eye\nIlluminates all without omission—\nHow could it be like the blind eyes of ordinary beings,\nOr the dim vision of the two vehicles?\nThen, meeting conditions without hindrance,\nTouching realms without arising.",

      "translated_text": "The peach blossoms red, the plum blossoms white—\nWho can merge them into one hue?\nThe purple swallow chitters, the yellow oriole sings—\nWho says their calls are but a single sound?\n\nA bright mirror stands before the dais—\nHow could it distinguish stillness from motion?\nA solitary cloud emerges from the peak—\nWhy cling to going or staying?\n\nFrom delusion, truth is spoken,\nYet truth has no inherent form;\nFrom truth, delusion arises,\nBut delusion’s essence is fundamentally empty.\nOnce delusion returns to emptiness,\nTruth, too, does not stand.\n\n**Chan Master Zhida:**\nWhen the mind establishes a realm, it exists;\nWhen the mind is void, no realm arises.\nWhen realm is empty and mind is still,\nThe mind illumines the realm with cool clarity.\nIn the ice-mirror, one sees one’s own image;\nIn the lamp-moon, one sees one’s own shadow;\nIn the mountain valley, one hears one’s own voice.\n\n**Chan Master Baiguizhao:**\nBirds flying through the void\nForget the void is their homeland;\nFish swimming in the water\nForget the water is their very life.\n\nAll of you, stand firmly here,\nFocus your spirit,\nTurn your light inward in a single thought—\nSuddenly, you will see yourself,\nNo different from the red sun in the sky!\nSpontaneously revolving, selfless,\nA bright pearl in the dish turns of itself.\n\n**Master Lin:**\nIts essence transcends mind and thought;\nIts purport surpasses past, present, and future.\nFree from the mind’s intentions,\nThe myriad forms show no distinction;\nBeyond past, present, and future,\nThe ten directions are utterly seamless.\nUnobstructed at the outset,\nThoroughly without reliance.\nAwakening lies before signs arise;\nApplication rests where no effort is made.\n\n**Master Zhaojue:**\nAdd a single thread—\nLike dust in the eye;\nRemove a single thread—\nLike carving flesh from the body.\nRely on the Dharma, not on people;\nRely on meaning, not on words;\nRely on wisdom, not on knowledge;\nRely on the understood meaning of scriptures,\nNot on the ununderstood.\n\nWhen cold, approach the fire;\nWhen hot, wave a fan;\nWhen hungry, eat;\nWhen tired, sleep.\nThus it is said:\nThe cypress before Master Zhaozhou’s hall,\nThe pines behind Xiangyan’s ridge—\nPlanted for no other purpose\nThan to summon the pure breeze.\n\n**Master Yunfeng Jun:**\nSlender bamboo and towering pines drip emerald fragrance,\nA gentle breeze and sparse moonlight pass through the chill.\nWho dwells in the old temple to the west?\nEach day, the bell’s toll sends off the setting sun.\n\nWind in the branches, moon on the islet—\nBoth convey the mind;\nMist-shrouded isles and cloud-wrapped forests—\nAll reveal the wondrous purport.\n\n**Venerable Baoji:**\nThe deluded body faces the mirror and sees its reflection—\nReflection and deluded body are no different.\nYet wishing to remove the reflection and keep the body,\nOne does not know the body, too, is fundamentally empty.\nBody and reflection are not distinct—\nNeither one nor the other can be held or abandoned.\nTo cling to one and discard the other\nIs to forever drift apart from true principle.\nLoving the sacred and hating the mundane,\nOne sinks and floats in the sea of birth and death.\nAfflictions arise from the mind—\nWithout mind, where would afflictions dwell?\nNo need to discriminate or grasp at forms—\nNaturally, the Dao is attained in an instant.\n\n**Chan Master Longya:**\nIn a dream, who knows the dream is false?\nOnly upon waking does one realize the dream was nothing.\nWhile deluded, it is just like events in a dream;\nAfter awakening, it is like rising from sleep.\n\nTo seek the ox, visit the frontier;\nTo learn the Dao, seek the mindless.\nWhen the ox is near, the mind is near—\nWithout mind, the Dao is easily found.\n\n**Chan Master Wenyì:**\nA single lotus bud,\nTwo slender green cypresses—\nWhy ask about lofty standards\nIn a monk’s garden?\n\n**Chan Master Tong’an:**\nBefore the withered tree crag, diverging paths abound;\nTravelers who reach this point all falter.\nThe egret stands in snow—no shared color;\nThe bright moon and reed flowers—nothing alike.\nWhen all is fully understood, nothing is understood;\nWhere mystery upon mystery unfolds, one must still ask why.\nDiligently I sing the song of the profound—\nCan the toad in the void grasp the moon’s light?\n\n**Monk of Yun Ding Mountain:**\nSitting idly, profoundly still—no sage knows,\nEven if one speaks, nothing compares to this.\nThe stone man claps a board in the clouds;\nThe water maiden plays a flute beneath the waves.\nIf you say you do not hear, you have not yet understood;\nIf you seek its echo, you will still doubt.\nI teach you to sing and respond—you must respond,\nBut do not ask about the notes of bamboo or silk.\n\n**Chan Master Danxia:**\nRecognize the treasure within your robe,\nAnd the drunkenness of ignorance will awaken of itself.\nThough the hundred bones dissolve,\nOne thing remains eternally numinous.\nKnow that realms are not the true essence;\nThe spirit-pearl has no fixed form.\nAwakened, one is a three-bodied Buddha;\nDeluded, one doubts even ten thousand scriptures.\nIn the mind, the mind can be fathomed;\nThrough the ear, the ear cannot hear.\nThe formless preceded heaven and earth;\nThe dark spring emerges from the profound.\nOriginally firm, it needs no forging;\nOriginally pure, it requires no settling.\nSpontaneously revolving like the sun at dawn,\nTranslucent like the morning star.\nAuspicious light flows unceasingly;\nTrue qi stirs and revives.\nReflecting, the hollow peaks are still;\nEncompassing, the Dharma-realm is bright.\nUnderstanding speech does not depend on the tongue;\nUttering words is not the same as sound.\nAt the farthest edge, vastness is stilled;\nWithout bounds, it equals the level void.\nSeeing the moon is not about observing the finger;\nReturning home requires no path.\nKnow the mind, and the mind is Buddha—\nWhat other Buddha could there be to attain?\n\n**Chan Master Tongzhi:**\nThe true self is originally present—\nDeluded, it seems absent;\nThe false self is originally nonexistent—\nGrasped, it appears to exist.\nTo understand the mind,\nThere is no mind to understand;\nThe mind that is not understood\nIs called the true mind.\nWhen truth and delusion interpenetrate,\nThe ordinary mind sees the Buddha-mind;\nWhen principle and practice are cultivated together,\nOne relies on original wisdom to seek Buddha-wisdom.\n\n**Master Chonghua Zan:**\nSealing emptiness, sealing clay, sealing water—\nOn level ground, cold waves fiercely rise.\nEven if one strives with utmost effort,\nIn the end, it is but a turtle dragging its tail.\n\n**Monk Dan Jiao’s Inscription on a Portrait:**\nDepicting form to see oneself—\nSeeing oneself, one harms the spirit.\nAlready a dream within a dream,\nFurther encountering a body beyond the body.\nWater flowers congeal into illusory substance;\nInk hues gather as empty dust.\nAlas, both you and I\nRemain unenlightened beings.\n\n**Master Zhu Anzhu:**\nDew glistens on green grass like jade;\nThe golden wind stirs the white duckweed.\nA single cry of a cold goose passes—\nAwakening one who has not yet awakened.\n\nLike the sun emitting flames, sharing redness with motes of dust—\nYet it is not truly red;\nLike water, clear and still, holding light clouds to share its greenness—\nYet it is not truly green.\n\n**Master Shan Gu:**\nThe lifeblood of the monk’s lineage,\nThe mind-essence of the ancient Buddhas.",
