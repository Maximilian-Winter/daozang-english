  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Lord Lao**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Lord Lao* (One Scroll)\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* Section, Registers and Genealogies Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao is the ancestral origin of the Dao, embodying spontaneity. He existed before the Three Pure Ones, prior to the Primordial Emperor, and reigned as the Jade Emperor, dwelling in the Jade Clarity Golden Palace.\n\nWithin the netherworld’s dark depths, the Hollow Void arose; from the Hollow Void emerged the Great Nothingness; the Great Nothingness transformed to generate the Three Blacks of Primordial Mystery. After countless eons of transformation, the Three Blacks gave birth to the Mysterious Jade Maiden, the Lady of Primordial Origin, whose divine countenance and wondrous form were of jade-like subtlety.\n\nAt that time, the Three Blacks remained undifferentiated in primordial chaos. The Jade Maiden ascended to the Great Clarity Golden Palace, while Lord Lao wandered beyond the Era of Grand Simplicity, abiding at the extremity of the Supreme Ultimate. There, he divided the Two Modes and thus engendered the Three Powers. Once the Three Powers were complete, the myriad existences came into being.\n\nLord Lao then responded to the needs of the age, assuming titles in turn: the Nameless Lord of Governance, the Lofty and Supreme Lord of the Void, the Most High Lord, the Teacher of the Upper Three Sovereigns, the Teacher of the Middle Three Sovereigns, the Teacher of the Lower Three Sovereigns, and the Teacher of the Five Emperors. From the dawn of creation until the reign of Emperor Shun, he served as the unbroken preceptor of the world for two million, seven hundred fifty-eight thousand, four hundred years and more.\n\nLord Lao commanded the divine messenger Xuan Yi of Mount Wanwei to bestow upon Yu the Jade Writ. Yu unsealed the golden tablets and silver-bound registers, obtaining the means to regulate the waters. Thereafter, Lord Lao ascended to the Jade Clarity Golden Palace. After the flood’s governance, the text was concealed within the Grotto of the Forest Chamber.\n\nFollowing Shun’s reign, virtue and the Dao declined below, and after a thousand-year cycle of the world’s destiny, a sage was destined to appear. At that time, Lord Lao emerged as the world’s teacher, manifesting his birth by entrusting himself to the Jade Lady’s jade body within her jeweled palace. The Jade Lady, reposing in the Great Clarity Golden Palace, dreamed of a solar essence vast as a shooting star entering her mouth. She swallowed it, awoke pregnant, and descended to the world for eighty-one years.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month, the *gengchen* year of the third reign of King Wuding of Yin (13th century BCE), the Jade Lady, accompanied by thirty-six jade lads and thirty-six jade maidens, descended to the land of Youbo. There, a palace of natural mist and cloud arose, with a thousand gates and ten thousand portals, guarded by celestial soldiers and divine warriors.\n\nAt that moment, the Jade Lady gave birth to Lord Lao from beneath her left armpit. Nine dragons proffered waters to bathe the sacred body, and where the dragons emerged, nine wells formed. The solar lad scattered radiance, and the lunar consort bore blossoms.\n\nThe sagely lord could speak immediately upon birth. Retreating nine steps, he caused nine-colored lotuses to bloom with each stride. Pointing to a plum tree, he declared, “This shall be my surname.” Then he proclaimed, “Within the Three Realms, I alone am their ancestral origin.”\n\nClad in the spontaneous raiment of heaven, he suddenly grew to nine feet in height. His jade countenance and golden body bore cinnabar lips and jade teeth; his ears rose above his crown. His visage combined the solar angle and lunar mystery, possessing ten thousand perfect features beyond enumeration.\n\nMarveling at his appearance, all exclaimed, “The sage is profound! Born before heaven and earth, he does not age; abiding after heaven and earth, he does not grow young. Though born with white hair, he is called *Laozi* (Old Master).”\n\nAt the time of his descent and birth, the divine immortals and the Supreme Lord of the Void paid homage in midair, reciting his ten titles: (1) Jade Emperor, (2) Primordial Sage, (3) Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, (4) Unsurpassed Venerable, (5) Lord of the Dao, (6) Nameless Lord, (7) Lofty and Supreme Lord of the Void, (8) Most High Lord, (9) Lord Lao, and (10) Teacher of Emperors.\n\nHaving spoken, they bowed their heads in reverence to Lord Lao and took their leave. The host of celestial immortals then arrayed their heavenly processions, clouds veiling the sky, to welcome the Sacred Mother’s return to the Heaven of Great Clarity.\n\nOn the day of Lord Lao’s descent and birth, whenever the sun rose, incense was burned and flowers scattered. As the Sacred Mother ascended to heaven, celestial incense and the resonant tones of the Hollow Void filled the world. Those who studied immortality transmitted these sounds among themselves, creating the *Step of the Void* melody, which is none other than the voice of heaven.\n\nWhen the Sacred Mother ascended, she left behind one sandal. The immortals interred it as a tomb, which was thereafter called the *Tomb of the Sacred Mother’s Ascension*.\n\nLord Lao also cultivated the Dao in Bo, where a well for refining the elixir remains. When King Xin of Yin grew tyrannical, the Supreme Emperor sought a sage to aid the realm. Lord Lao, seated in the Golden Palace, received the Emperor’s homage. The Emperor said, “King Xin is cruel and deluded; the people have no master. Only the Earl of the West, Ji Chang, possesses the Dao. I humbly beseech the Most High to protect him with compassion.”\n\nLord Lao assented to the Emperor’s request and descended to the southern slope of Mount Qi, dwelling as a recluse. The Earl of the West, Ji, appointed him as the Archivist of the Royal Repository. He transmitted the Dao of emperors and kings, aiding Lü Shang and King Wu of Zhou in overthrowing the Shang.\n\nIn the first year of King Zhao’s reign, he was appointed as the Historian Beneath the Pillars. In the twenty-fifth year of King Zhao’s reign (*guichou*, 974 BCE), he passed through the Hangu Pass, intending to journey to the Western Rong lands.\n\nEarlier, Yin Xi, a grandee of King Kang skilled in astrology, had retired to serve as the Pass Prefect. He built a thatched tower to observe the stars and await auspicious omens. Suddenly, he saw a purple qi rising in the east, serpentine as a dragon, moving westward. He urgently instructed the pass officers, “A sage is about to pass. If you see an ancient-looking figure traveling discreetly in a carriage drawn by a black ox, do not let him slip by.”\n\nThe officers replied, “Understood.” They then swept the roads and burned incense to await his arrival.\n\nThen, as foretold, the officers detained him for inquiry. Yin Xi beheld him and prostrated himself, kowtowing, saying, “Your servant earlier divined the omen of the purple qi. Now, beholding the Dao Lord’s countenance and form, could this not be the great divine personage of highest antiquity?”\n\nThe Old Lord replied, “You are able to know me; I am able to know you.”\n\nXi said, “I venture to ask the Dao Lord’s name.”\n\nThe Old Lord said, “My name is vast and boundless, spanning kalpas from one to the next, not to be fully recounted. Now, my surname is Li, my given name Er, my courtesy name Boyang, and my sobriquet Lao Dan.”\n\nXi, with utmost sincerity, lodged him in a guesthouse, prostrated himself, and kowtowed, humbly entreating instruction. The Old Lord, wishing to transmit the Dao, tested Xi’s resolve. Suddenly, he soared into the air, transforming into a golden body eighteen feet tall. Xi, astonished and reverent, prostrated himself and kowtowed, saying, “The Dao Lord is supremely sagely and divine, his transformations unfathomable. Your servant’s blood and saliva are foul and impure; to be graced with an audience of your celestial presence fills me with awe and joy. I humbly entreat your instruction.”\n\nThe Old Lord said, “Attend carefully to my command: I bestow upon you the *Daodejing*. Master it, and you shall ascend to heaven, becoming a master of immortals.”\n\nXi replied, “Though your servant has long purified his heart, I have been mired in the floating world. Yet by karmic fortune, I have received this sacred grace.” He bowed twice, kowtowed, and received the scripture, then said, “I reverently embrace this profound decree, seeking only to cultivate and perfect it to the end of my days, never daring to neglect or lose it. By upholding this covenant, reciting in purity, I shall retire from office and attain perfection.”\n\nLater, he visited the Old Lord, who appointed Xi as the Celestial Lord of the Twenty-Eight Heavens, the Supreme Perfected One. Initially, the Old Lord had revealed his golden body to Xi, but afterward, he resumed his true form of the Nine Heavens. Taking leave of Xi, he journeyed west to the eighty-one lands beyond the Flowing Sands. Arriving in India, he propagated the arts of the floating pagoda to transform the Hu people, and in that land, all called him the Venerable Master of Antiquity.\n\nIn the forty-fourth year (*renshen*, 953 BCE), on the eighth day of the second month, Śākyamuni received the Dao from him in Yucheng. With each sentence of the scripture he received, his body merged with the Great Ultimate, and the Supreme Emperor paid homage from afar. After reciting it ten thousand times, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Truly, when reciting scriptures, one must seek a place of purity and stillness, unifying heart and spirit, meditating upon the Primal Sage. Thus, the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall all be reborn in heaven. The text is secretly preserved in the Golden Towers of the Three Clarities and the immortal caves of various mountains, inscribed on golden tablets and jade slips, attended by immortal youths and maidens who burn incense in vigil. When the great kalpa turns and the world nears its end, the Lords of the Grotto-Heavens shall gather the texts and return them to the Golden Towers of the Grand Clarity.\n\nIn the fifth year of King Mu’s reign (*jiashen*, 972 BCE), the Old Lord returned to the Central Kingdom and transmitted to the king the arts of immortal travel and aerial chariotry. In the twenty-eighth year of King Xuan’s reign (*xinchou*, 801 BCE), the Three Rivers trembled. The king asked the Old Lord, “What is this portent?”\n\nThe Old Lord replied, “I have heard a song in the suburbs: ‘When Venus enters Xuanyuan, the state’s ruler shall decline.’ In the reign of King You, Mount Qi collapsed. The Old Lord said, ‘In ancient times, when the Yi and Luo rivers dried, the Xia perished; when the Yellow River dried, the Shang perished. Now, Mount Qi has collapsed and the rivers have run dry—this state shall perish.’” The Old Lord bestowed upon the king the *Hidden Writ of the Three Heavens*, but the king did not revere the celestial texts. The Old Lord retrieved the writ and departed, and the king was later slain by the Quan Rong.\n\nIn the third year of King Huan’s reign (*jiazi*, 717 BCE), the Old Lord rode a white deer, accompanied by twenty-four immortals, with Guiguzi as his charioteer. He ascended Kunlun in the west and passed through Hangu Pass again. The Celestial Lord of the Twenty-Eight Heavens, the Supreme Perfected One, learned of the Old Lord’s return and descended from heaven to pay homage, following his carriage to the Palace of the Queen Mother before taking leave. The Old Lord then appointed Xi as the Celestial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of King Xiang’s reign (*yiyou*, 635 BCE), the Old Lord returned to the Central Kingdom. The king’s scribe, whose name was later changed to Danran, revered him. Confucius traveled to Zhou and inquired of the rites from the Old Lord. The Old Lord said, “The man of whom you speak—his bones have long since decayed; only his words remain. I have heard that a good merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and a gentleman of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your pride, anger, and excessive desires, for these bring no benefit to your person. This is why I tell you thus.”\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples, “Birds—I know they can fly, and so I make snares. Beasts—I know they can run, and so I make nets. Fish—I know they can swim, and so I make lines. But as for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend heaven. Today, I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon? I am but a mayfly in comparison.”\n\nConfucius returned to Lu and declared Laozi a sage of all directions, one who is trusted without speaking, who transforms without governing—truly, he may be called a sage. One hundred and nineteen years after Confucius’ death, the Old Lord appeared to Duke Xian of Qin, saying, “At first, Qin and Zhou were united; after five hundred years, they separated. Ten years after their separation, a hegemon-king shall arise.” At that time, he was called the Grand Historian of Zhou.\n\nThe Old Lord was born in the time of King Wuding of Shang. Sometimes he appeared, sometimes he concealed himself, dwelling in the world for nine hundred years before ascending Mount Zizhu in the Purple Tenuity. The mountain lies within the borders of Quren County, and thus it is called the Ascension Mound of Laozi.\n\nThe Mystic Master says: I have perused all the records of the Dao, seeking their essential meaning. Yet many who delight in immortality have fabricated and compiled recklessly. When examining their historical accounts, the dates often conflict, and when tracing their wondrous traces, the beginnings and ends are scattered and incoherent, their words empty and extravagant, losing all truth. Such matters are not trivial, and I have omitted them entirely. I have instead consulted external sources and verified them against the jade tablets, recording only what is indelible through the ages. I title this the *Inner Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Old Lord*, leaving a true record to correct the floating words.\n\nHere ends the *Inner Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Old Lord*.",

Initially, the Old Lord had revealed his golden body to Xi, but afterward, he resumed his true form of the Nine Heavens. Taking leave of Xi, he journeyed west to the eighty-one lands beyond the Flowing Sands. Arriving in India, he propagated the arts of the floating pagoda to transform the Hu people, and in that land, all called him the Venerable Master of Antiquity.\n\nIn the forty-fourth year (*renshen*, 953 BCE), on the eighth day of the second month, Śākyamuni received the Dao from him in Yucheng. With each sentence of the scripture he received, his body merged with the Great Ultimate, and the Supreme Emperor paid homage from afar. After reciting it ten thousand times, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Truly, when reciting scriptures, one must seek a place of purity and stillness, unifying heart and spirit, meditating upon the Primal Sage. Thus, the ninefold ancestors and sevenfold forebears shall all be reborn in heaven. The text is secretly preserved in the Golden Towers of the Three Clarities and the immortal caves of various mountains, inscribed on golden tablets and jade slips, attended by immortal youths and maidens who burn incense in vigil. When the great kalpa turns and the world nears its end, the Lords of the Grotto-Heavens shall gather the texts and return them to the Golden Towers of the Grand Clarity.\n\nIn the fifth year of King Mu’s reign (*jiashen*, 972 BCE), the Old Lord returned to the Central Kingdom and transmitted to the king the arts of immortal travel and aerial chariotry. In the twenty-eighth year of King Xuan’s reign (*xinchou*, 801 BCE), the Three Rivers trembled. The king asked the Old Lord, “What is this portent?”\n\nThe Old Lord replied, “I have heard a song in the suburbs: ‘When Venus enters Xuanyuan, the state’s ruler shall decline.’ In the reign of King You, Mount Qi collapsed. The Old Lord said, ‘In ancient times, when the Yi and Luo rivers dried, the Xia perished; when the Yellow River dried, the Shang perished. Now, Mount Qi has collapsed and the rivers have run dry—this state shall perish.’” The Old Lord bestowed upon the king the *Hidden Writ of the Three Heavens*, but the king did not revere the celestial texts. The Old Lord retrieved the writ and departed, and the king was later slain by the Quan Rong.\n\nIn the third year of King Huan’s reign (*jiazi*, 717 BCE), the Old Lord rode a white deer, accompanied by twenty-four immortals, with Guiguzi as his charioteer. He ascended Kunlun in the west and passed through Hangu Pass again. The Celestial Lord of the Twenty-Eight Heavens, the Supreme Perfected One, learned of the Old Lord’s return and descended from heaven to pay homage, following his carriage to the Palace of the Queen Mother before taking leave. The Old Lord then appointed Xi as the Celestial Lord of the Thirty-Two Heavens.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of King Xiang’s reign (*yiyou*, 635 BCE), the Old Lord returned to the Central Kingdom. The king’s scribe, whose name was later changed to Danran, revered him. Confucius traveled to Zhou and inquired of the rites from the Old Lord. The Old Lord said, “The man of whom you speak—his bones have long since decayed; only his words remain. I have heard that a good merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and a gentleman of great virtue appears foolish. Rid yourself of your pride, anger, and excessive desires, for these bring no benefit to your person. This is why I tell you thus.”\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples, “Birds—I know they can fly, and so I make snares. Beasts—I know they can run, and so I make nets. Fish—I know they can swim, and so I make lines. But as for the dragon, I cannot know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend heaven. Today, I have seen Laozi—is he not like the dragon? I am but a mayfly in comparison.”\n\nConfucius returned to Lu and declared Laozi a sage of all directions, one who is trusted without speaking, who transforms without governing—truly, he may be called a sage. One hundred and nineteen years after Confucius’ death, the Old Lord appeared to Duke Xian of Qin, saying, “At first, Qin and Zhou were united; after five hundred years, they separated. Ten years after their separation, a hegemon-king shall arise.” At that time, he was called the Grand Historian of Zhou.\n\nThe Old Lord was born in the time of King Wuding of Shang. Sometimes he appeared, sometimes he concealed himself, dwelling in the world for nine hundred years before ascending Mount Zizhu in the Purple Tenuity. The mountain lies within the borders of Quren County, and thus it is called the Ascension Mound of Laozi.\n\nThe Mystic Master says: I have perused all the records of the Dao, seeking their essential meaning. Yet many who delight in immortality have fabricated and compiled recklessly. When examining their historical accounts, the dates often conflict, and when tracing their wondrous traces, the beginnings and ends are scattered and incoherent, their words empty and extravagant, losing all truth. Such matters are not trivial, and I have omitted them entirely. I have instead consulted external sources and verified them against the jade tablets, recording only what is indelible through the ages. I title this the *Inner Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Old Lord*, leaving a true record to correct the floating words.\n\nHere ends the *Inner Preface to the Golden Writ of the Most High Old Lord*.",

Suddenly, he saw a purple qi rising in the east, serpentine as a dragon, moving westward. He urgently instructed the pass officers, “A sage is about to pass. If you see an ancient-looking figure traveling discreetly in a carriage drawn by a black ox, do not let him slip by.”\n\nThe officers replied, “Understood.” They then swept the roads and burned incense to await his arrival.",
