Notify the local earth gods and territorial deities of this place.\n\nI now conduct this jiao offering, perform the rites, and burn incense to present the intent of this fast. Today, I invoke the covenant of the Three Realms and proclaim to the ten directions. May the true qi of the Supreme Perfected Dao descend and flow into our bodies, that our hearts may be expansive, our forms at ease, our spirits clear, and our qi refreshed. May sincere words ascend, and auspicious blessings descend in response. Transmit my earnest supplication swiftly to the presence of the Supreme Three Heavens’ Seven August Emperors, the Demon-Quelling Mysterious Heavenly Worthies, and the assembly of perfected ones.\n\n**Announce the Dharma Titles**\n\nYour humble servant, the inferior official [Name], respectfully petitions:\nThe Golden Towers’ Ninefold Pure Emperors, the Lofty Perfected of the Great Veil’s Ten Poles, the Celestial Emperors of all heavens, the host of stellar perfected, and the perfected of the four bureaus descending upon the altar—may your vast compassion open your numinous gaze.\n\nI have heard that the Great Dao is impartial, yet all things attain the transformations of generation and completion. The sages act, and all beings receive the blessings of their sheltering care. Before the primordial chaos was divided, there was already one who bent to accomplish without neglect. Vastly, in the opening of heaven and earth, how majestic were the achievements! In small matters, in benefiting beings and aiding humanity, how abundant the surplus! Our patriarch, the Demon-Quelling Great Emperor, founder of the Three Realms’ Dao, ranked among the Nine Heavens, is the august sovereign of the Central Heaven’s myriad chariots and the lord of the destinies of the mortal realm’s multitudes. In the Dragon-Kang kalpa, during the year of Jia-Wu, demonic spirits arose and brought misfortune, and the people suffered untimely deaths. Receiving the secret decree of the Primordial Beginning, he crushed the demonic encampments. Assisting the Jade Emperor, he blessed the common people, all attaining longevity. Thus, the earth was purged of demonic dust, and the heavens were cleansed of foul vapors. To this day, his radiance illumines the sun and moon, and his might stabilizes heaven and earth. His teachings, proclaimed from the golden mouth, spread throughout the mortal realm. His luminous traces and mighty mysterious works—whenever prayers are offered, they are invariably answered; no request goes unfulfilled. Now, the precious throne is arrayed, and humble offerings are set upon the table. Lamps kindle the myriad phenomena, dispelling darkness and revealing the unseen. Incense burns amidst the wispy five-colored clouds, conveying sincerity and transmitting devotion. Though the ten ranks of true teachings are complete, I still wish to present threefold humble offerings. The majestic talismans of the Six Jia spirits and auspicious registers are temporarily sealed in the celestial palace. The myriad demons flee at the divine talismans, and the ritual regalia descend upon the altar. May the dragon and phoenix carriages draw near in secret, and may even the sincerity of beasts and otters be accepted. We gaze upward to the heavens in reverence, awaiting the arrival of the sagely presence.\n\n**Request the Assembly** | **Descend, O Sages** | **Be Seated** | **Offer Tea**\n\nWith redoubled sincerity, I humbly petition:\nThe Void Golden Towers’ Seven August Emperors, the Northern Culmen Divine Empyrean Lord, the celestial ministers and assistants, and the lofty perfected of the upper altar.\n\nI have heard that human life in this world is governed by heaven above. Profound is its benevolence, for all share in the transformations of yin and yang. Lofty and exalted, it holds the power of life and death. If cultivation is neglected in the numinous terrace, karmic retribution is surely meted out by the net of law. Adrift in the various destinies, submerged in the three evil paths—fortunately, our patriarch bequeathed the teachings of the scriptures, that later generations might know the methods of cultivation and expiation. Reforming evil and turning toward goodness, one may pray for blessings and prolong life. Today, I, [Name], have been shaped by your molding and sheltered by your covering. Turning to follow the scriptural teachings, I respectfully enter the Dharma gate. Pouring water and offering flowers, lighting lamps and venerating the Dipper, I raise the wine vessel to present the three offerings, baring my heart and pouring forth my sincerity. Though green ants and yellow seals are but meager offerings of mortal fare, the pearl palaces and conch towers abound with celestial nectar. I humbly present this small token to repay your great virtue.\n\nMay the myriad heavens rejoice, and the Three Realms attend in reverence. In the orderly beginning of this feast, may it be as grand as the assembly in the Jade Capital. May the majestic and vast model ever inspire us to draw near the mysterious millet of the precious altar. Bowing to the lofty perfected, I respectfully present the first offering.\n\n**Let the Dharma be as a wife**\n\nWith redoubled sincerity, I humbly petition:\nThe Central Heaven’s Northern Dipper, the Three Lights’ arrayed luminaries, the celestial perfected of the upper realms, and the host of saints of the middle altar.\n\nI have heard that the Sun Lord and Moon Queen are the honored among the celestial bodies of the upper heavens. The Dipper and the Pole Star govern the destinies of all beings below. Their mechanisms operate beyond comprehension, yet their radiance is impartially displayed. Moreover, the various bureaus of bestowal and the Three Mysterious Ministries extend their vast regulations, harmonizing the four seasons. They assist heaven and earth in their proper functions and govern the affairs of ghosts and spirits. They manifest their qi and propagate their teachings, employing blessings as warnings and wielding awe as authority. Dwelling on high, they hear below, rewarding goodness and punishing evil with clarity. Today, I, [Name], am governed by their decrees and daily receive their illumination. Deeply fearing to drift into the sea of desire and enter the river of attachment, I would merely be born into the mortal realm and encounter the true teachings. Reverently upholding the mysterious model, I open the jade registers. Once more, I pour the clear wine, hoping to fully display my devotion before your august gaze. The immortal guests of the three isles have long attended the Jasper Pool; now, a cup of Luo-Fu spring wine is presented at the jade steps. Offering the pine flowers to the August Emperor, I emulate the sincerity of the rustic’s waterweed.\n\nMay this offering be met with perfect sincerity and bestowed with abundant fortune. As the sacred writ emerges into the world, its lofty radiance shines resplendent; as the Wine Star hangs in the heavens, its brilliant light blazes forth. Overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, I present this second pure libation.\n\nFlourishing and majestic is the realm’s prosperity—\nYour servant humbly reiterates, reverently addressing:\nThe lords of Fengdu, the sacred peaks, the watery domains,\nThe boundless immortals of the Yang world and scriptural canons,\nThe marshals and generals assembled beneath the altar.\n\nI have heard that the Supreme August One’s scales of justice are entrusted to the myriad offices’ governance, while the sins and blessings of the common folk cannot escape the judgment of the host of sages. Lofty is the Dao, exalted is virtue; vast and unfathomable are the gods. Harmonious within the palace, solemn within the temple, they are upright and selfless, their depth profound as the abyss. Vast as the heavens, their oversight is ever luminous. Some preside over the mysterious registers, wielding the azure statutes; others traverse the azure vaults above and descend to the yellow springs below. Attending the perfected ones of the upper realms, they serve as the courts of immortals and gods. None fail to expel evil and uphold rectitude, emerging from darkness into light. They vow to deliver the dead and ferry the living, accomplishing transformations in every quarter.\n\nToday, I, [Name], have long been nourished by the rain of the teachings and bathed in the mystic winds. Yearning for the Dao and contemplating the true, I now perform the rites of the canon. Avoiding misfortune and pursuing fortune, I seek to firmly establish the roots of goodness. Thrice I present the pure libation, twice I declare my sincere devotion. Earnest and reverent, I fear overstepping the bounds of the exalted; towering and majestic, I trust my humble offering will not be disdained.\n\nIn its purity, it is presented forth—\nThe clear belongs to the sages, the turbid to the worthy; how difficult it is to rank them. Yet by clarifying the heart and dispelling desire, I prostrate myself like the sunflower turning to the sun. May you heed the soundless and respond when called. As the jade [vessel] pours the primordial, the sweet wine is exhausted in this moment of devotion to the August One. May the immortal soldiers guard the Dao, and may the altar look up to the millennia-old teachings of demon-subduing.\n\nThe wine concludes its threefold offering; the rites fulfill the one heart.\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—\nThe ceremony ends with three rounds, yet my humble heart remains ever vigilant. Though my sins may number ten thousand, none can escape the vast net of heaven. Looking up, I revere the great virtue’s love of life and pray that this humble one may gather blessings.\n\nI humbly beseech your vast grace, offering my meager sincerity. May my heart’s prayer be fulfilled; I now reverently proclaim it.\n\n**Proclamation**\nAs the words have been fully recited, I trust that the celestial compassion will surely heed this mortal’s plea. May you pardon transgressions and absolve sins, washing away filth and dissolving blemishes. May the edict descend from the Purple Tenuity Palace, perfecting the numinous treasures. May the jade chimes resound, the Brahmanic qi suffuse the cosmos. May the Golden Lads scatter flowers, the Jade Maidens hold the towels. May demon kings show reverence, and ghostly spirits be extinguished.\n\nStill, I pray that my person be drenched in the dharma’s grace, that the azure registers record my blessings and longevity. Born in an age of prosperity, may the yellow path follow the stars’ course. May nothing remain unexorcised, nothing remain undelivered. All shall accord with the scriptures’ unerring words—surely I shall attain my fortune, surely I shall attain my name, all in harmony with the Dao’s boundless pronouncements.\n\nNext, I pray that we, your servants, may have our Dao-hearts awakened and our dharma-nature perfected. May we ever gaze upon the lion throne floating in the void, where wind and clouds gather in celebration; may we together behold the dragon scriptures’ manifestation in the world, where sun and moon shine as one. May yang flourish and yin wane, the heavens be clear and the earth solemn. May the four seas rejoice in the transformative peace, and all beings ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your consideration.\n\n**Petition Presented**\n\nWith three bows and twelve vows, the recitation of scriptures and proclamation of prayers now complete, we, your humble servants of such-and-such rank, reverently submit this earnest petition:\n\nTo the Ninefold Pure August Thearchs of the Golden Towers, the Lofty Perfected of the Ten Poles of Great Mystery, the Thearchs of all Heavens, the host of stellar perfected, and the assembled perfected of the four bureaus descending to the scripture altar—we humbly beseech your vast compassion to open wide the mirror of numinous insight.\n\nWe have heard that the Thearch’s throne stands at the center of heaven, where all stars pay homage in their places; that the true scriptures, handed down through the ages, endure for ten thousand kalpas by virtue of the mysterious statutes. Having been granted the grace to behold these sacred texts, we count it our greatest fortune.\n\nYet we, your servants, are but coarse vessels of turbid qi, walking corpses of the lower realms. We have presumptuously borne the title of *jijiu* (libationer) without worthy merit, and undertaken the task of scripture-holding without true capacity. Our words are crude and trivial, our conduct rough and careless. Trembling with fear, we dread the inescapable axe and saw; yet in your boundless majesty, we trust you will not hold us to the standards of the thatched hut.\n\nIn your vast mercy, deign to regard this humble sincerity. Record even the smallest good, and let the brush of transformation extend your grace. The great virtue is called \"life\"—turn the great pivot and bestow your protection.\n\nNow the incense has burned low in the precious tripod, the lamps have dimmed in their silver vessels. Our humble snail-shell abode cannot long detain the immortal retinue; the august dragon-chariot must soon return to the Dark Capital. Clinging to the original cause, joy and trepidation mingle within us. As your radiant cortege turns back, we gaze in reverence upon the celestial qilin; though our wheels cannot follow your traces, we strain to hear the cocks and dogs in the clouds.\n\nWe pray that our sins be dissolved and our blessings gathered. May the officiants of this fast be pardoned for their presumption and granted the blessings of peace to come. Vast, deep, high, and luminous—our private praises cannot exhaust your glory. Uphold us, guide us, aid us, and shelter us, that we may forever rely upon your protecting canopy.\n\nWith utmost awe and fear, we send forth the lofty perfected. The fast is concluded, the cloud-chariots have departed. In silent meditation, we burn incense. May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit-officials ensure that this place of our offering naturally generates the golden elixir’s cinnabar essence. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected gather here before this incense burner.\n\nWe pray that we, your servants, may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality. May the officiants of this fast receive blessings, and all households enjoy your grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend our orchid banquet. May the sincerity of our petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Three Heavenly August Ones, the Seven August Thearchs, the Perfected Who Subdue Demons, the Mysterious and Subtle Heavenly Worthy, and the assembled perfected.\n\n**Concluding Hymn**\nThe rite of thanksgiving for the subduing of demons at the scripture altar is now complete.",

Notify the local earth gods and territorial deities of this place.\n\nI now conduct this jiao offering, perform the rites, and burn incense to present the intent of this fast. Today, I invoke the covenant of the Three Realms and proclaim to the ten directions. May the true qi of the Supreme Perfected Dao descend and flow into our bodies, that our hearts may be expansive, our forms at ease, our spirits clear, and our qi refreshed. May sincere words ascend, and auspicious blessings descend in response. Transmit my earnest supplication swiftly to the presence of the Supreme Three Heavens’ Seven August Emperors, the Demon-Quelling Mysterious Heavenly Worthies, and the assembly of perfected ones.\n\n**Announce the Dharma Titles**\n\nYour humble servant, the inferior official [Name], respectfully petitions:\nThe Golden Towers’ Ninefold Pure Emperors, the Lofty Perfected of the Great Veil’s Ten Poles, the Celestial Emperors of all heavens, the host of stellar perfected, and the perfected of the four bureaus descending upon the altar—may your vast compassion open your numinous gaze.\n\nI have heard that the Great Dao is impartial, yet all things attain the transformations of generation and completion. The sages act, and all beings receive the blessings of their sheltering care. Before the primordial chaos was divided, there was already one who bent to accomplish without neglect. Vastly, in the opening of heaven and earth, how majestic were the achievements! In small matters, in benefiting beings and aiding humanity, how abundant the surplus! Our patriarch, the Demon-Quelling Great Emperor, founder of the Three Realms’ Dao, ranked among the Nine Heavens, is the august sovereign of the Central Heaven’s myriad chariots and the lord of the destinies of the mortal realm’s multitudes. In the Dragon-Kang kalpa, during the year of Jia-Wu, demonic spirits arose and brought misfortune, and the people suffered untimely deaths. Receiving the secret decree of the Primordial Beginning, he crushed the demonic encampments. Assisting the Jade Emperor, he blessed the common people, all attaining longevity. Thus, the earth was purged of demonic dust, and the heavens were cleansed of foul vapors. To this day, his radiance illumines the sun and moon, and his might stabilizes heaven and earth. His teachings, proclaimed from the golden mouth, spread throughout the mortal realm. His luminous traces and mighty mysterious works—whenever prayers are offered, they are invariably answered; no request goes unfulfilled. Now, the precious throne is arrayed, and humble offerings are set upon the table. Lamps kindle the myriad phenomena, dispelling darkness and revealing the unseen. Incense burns amidst the wispy five-colored clouds, conveying sincerity and transmitting devotion. Though the ten ranks of true teachings are complete, I still wish to present threefold humble offerings. The majestic talismans of the Six Jia spirits and auspicious registers are temporarily sealed in the celestial palace. The myriad demons flee at the divine talismans, and the ritual regalia descend upon the altar. May the dragon and phoenix carriages draw near in secret, and may even the sincerity of beasts and otters be accepted. We gaze upward to the heavens in reverence, awaiting the arrival of the sagely presence.\n\n**Request the Assembly** | **Descend, O Sages** | **Be Seated** | **Offer Tea**\n\nWith redoubled sincerity, I humbly petition:\nThe Void Golden Towers’ Seven August Emperors, the Northern Culmen Divine Empyrean Lord, the celestial ministers and assistants, and the lofty perfected of the upper altar.\n\nI have heard that human life in this world is governed by heaven above. Profound is its benevolence, for all share in the transformations of yin and yang. Lofty and exalted, it holds the power of life and death. If cultivation is neglected in the numinous terrace, karmic retribution is surely meted out by the net of law. Adrift in the various destinies, submerged in the three evil paths—fortunately, our patriarch bequeathed the teachings of the scriptures, that later generations might know the methods of cultivation and expiation. Reforming evil and turning toward goodness, one may pray for blessings and prolong life. Today, I, [Name], have been shaped by your molding and sheltered by your covering. Turning to follow the scriptural teachings, I respectfully enter the Dharma gate. Pouring water and offering flowers, lighting lamps and venerating the Dipper, I raise the wine vessel to present the three offerings, baring my heart and pouring forth my sincerity. Though green ants and yellow seals are but meager offerings of mortal fare, the pearl palaces and conch towers abound with celestial nectar. I humbly present this small token to repay your great virtue.\n\nMay the myriad heavens rejoice, and the Three Realms attend in reverence. In the orderly beginning of this feast, may it be as grand as the assembly in the Jade Capital. May the majestic and vast model ever inspire us to draw near the mysterious millet of the precious altar. Bowing to the lofty perfected, I respectfully present the first offering.\n\n**Let the Dharma be as a wife**\n\nWith redoubled sincerity, I humbly petition:\nThe Central Heaven’s Northern Dipper, the Three Lights’ arrayed luminaries, the celestial perfected of the upper realms, and the host of saints of the middle altar.\n\nI have heard that the Sun Lord and Moon Queen are the honored among the celestial bodies of the upper heavens. The Dipper and the Pole Star govern the destinies of all beings below. Their mechanisms operate beyond comprehension, yet their radiance is impartially displayed. Moreover, the various bureaus of bestowal and the Three Mysterious Ministries extend their vast regulations, harmonizing the four seasons. They assist heaven and earth in their proper functions and govern the affairs of ghosts and spirits. They manifest their qi and propagate their teachings, employing blessings as warnings and wielding awe as authority. Dwelling on high, they hear below, rewarding goodness and punishing evil with clarity. Today, I, [Name], am governed by their decrees and daily receive their illumination. Deeply fearing to drift into the sea of desire and enter the river of attachment, I would merely be born into the mortal realm and encounter the true teachings. Reverently upholding the mysterious model, I open the jade registers. Once more, I pour the clear wine, hoping to fully display my devotion before your august gaze. The immortal guests of the three isles have long attended the Jasper Pool; now, a cup of Luo-Fu spring wine is presented at the jade steps. Offering the pine flowers to the August Emperor, I emulate the sincerity of the rustic’s waterweed.",

As the sacred writ emerges into the world, its lofty radiance shines resplendent; as the Wine Star hangs in the heavens, its brilliant light blazes forth. Overwhelmed with awe and trepidation, I present this second pure libation.\n\nFlourishing and majestic is the realm’s prosperity—\nYour servant humbly reiterates, reverently addressing:\nThe lords of Fengdu, the sacred peaks, the watery domains,\nThe boundless immortals of the Yang world and scriptural canons,\nThe marshals and generals assembled beneath the altar.\n\nI have heard that the Supreme August One’s scales of justice are entrusted to the myriad offices’ governance, while the sins and blessings of the common folk cannot escape the judgment of the host of sages. Lofty is the Dao, exalted is virtue; vast and unfathomable are the gods. Harmonious within the palace, solemn within the temple, they are upright and selfless, their depth profound as the abyss. Vast as the heavens, their oversight is ever luminous. Some preside over the mysterious registers, wielding the azure statutes; others traverse the azure vaults above and descend to the yellow springs below. Attending the perfected ones of the upper realms, they serve as the courts of immortals and gods. None fail to expel evil and uphold rectitude, emerging from darkness into light. They vow to deliver the dead and ferry the living, accomplishing transformations in every quarter.\n\nToday, I, [Name], have long been nourished by the rain of the teachings and bathed in the mystic winds. Yearning for the Dao and contemplating the true, I now perform the rites of the canon. Avoiding misfortune and pursuing fortune, I seek to firmly establish the roots of goodness. Thrice I present the pure libation, twice I declare my sincere devotion. Earnest and reverent, I fear overstepping the bounds of the exalted; towering and majestic, I trust my humble offering will not be disdained.\n\nIn its purity, it is presented forth—\nThe clear belongs to the sages, the turbid to the worthy; how difficult it is to rank them. Yet by clarifying the heart and dispelling desire, I prostrate myself like the sunflower turning to the sun. May you heed the soundless and respond when called. As the jade [vessel] pours the primordial, the sweet wine is exhausted in this moment of devotion to the August One. May the immortal soldiers guard the Dao, and may the altar look up to the millennia-old teachings of demon-subduing.\n\nThe wine concludes its threefold offering; the rites fulfill the one heart.\nThe Great Dao pervades the mysterious void—\nThe ceremony ends with three rounds, yet my humble heart remains ever vigilant. Though my sins may number ten thousand, none can escape the vast net of heaven. Looking up, I revere the great virtue’s love of life and pray that this humble one may gather blessings.\n\nI humbly beseech your vast grace, offering my meager sincerity. May my heart’s prayer be fulfilled; I now reverently proclaim it.\n\n**Proclamation**\nAs the words have been fully recited, I trust that the celestial compassion will surely heed this mortal’s plea. May you pardon transgressions and absolve sins, washing away filth and dissolving blemishes. May the edict descend from the Purple Tenuity Palace, perfecting the numinous treasures. May the jade chimes resound, the Brahmanic qi suffuse the cosmos. May the Golden Lads scatter flowers, the Jade Maidens hold the towels. May demon kings show reverence, and ghostly spirits be extinguished.\n\nStill, I pray that my person be drenched in the dharma’s grace, that the azure registers record my blessings and longevity. Born in an age of prosperity, may the yellow path follow the stars’ course. May nothing remain unexorcised, nothing remain undelivered. All shall accord with the scriptures’ unerring words—surely I shall attain my fortune, surely I shall attain my name, all in harmony with the Dao’s boundless pronouncements.\n\nNext, I pray that we, your servants, may have our Dao-hearts awakened and our dharma-nature perfected. May we ever gaze upon the lion throne floating in the void, where wind and clouds gather in celebration; may we together behold the dragon scriptures’ manifestation in the world, where sun and moon shine as one. May yang flourish and yin wane, the heavens be clear and the earth solemn. May the four seas rejoice in the transformative peace, and all beings ascend to the realm of benevolence and longevity.\n\nRespectfully submitted for your consideration.",

Having been granted the grace to behold these sacred texts, we count it our greatest fortune.\n\nYet we, your servants, are but coarse vessels of turbid qi, walking corpses of the lower realms. We have presumptuously borne the title of *jijiu* (libationer) without worthy merit, and undertaken the task of scripture-holding without true capacity. Our words are crude and trivial, our conduct rough and careless. Trembling with fear, we dread the inescapable axe and saw; yet in your boundless majesty, we trust you will not hold us to the standards of the thatched hut.\n\nIn your vast mercy, deign to regard this humble sincerity. Record even the smallest good, and let the brush of transformation extend your grace. The great virtue is called \"life\"—turn the great pivot and bestow your protection.\n\nNow the incense has burned low in the precious tripod, the lamps have dimmed in their silver vessels. Our humble snail-shell abode cannot long detain the immortal retinue; the august dragon-chariot must soon return to the Dark Capital. Clinging to the original cause, joy and trepidation mingle within us. As your radiant cortege turns back, we gaze in reverence upon the celestial qilin; though our wheels cannot follow your traces, we strain to hear the cocks and dogs in the clouds.\n\nWe pray that our sins be dissolved and our blessings gathered. May the officiants of this fast be pardoned for their presumption and granted the blessings of peace to come. Vast, deep, high, and luminous—our private praises cannot exhaust your glory. Uphold us, guide us, aid us, and shelter us, that we may forever rely upon your protecting canopy.\n\nWith utmost awe and fear, we send forth the lofty perfected. The fast is concluded, the cloud-chariots have departed. In silent meditation, we burn incense. May the Incense Officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit-officials ensure that this place of our offering naturally generates the golden elixir’s cinnabar essence. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected gather here before this incense burner.\n\nWe pray that we, your servants, may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality. May the officiants of this fast receive blessings, and all households enjoy your grace. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend our orchid banquet. May the sincerity of our petition swiftly ascend to the presence of the Three Heavenly August Ones, the Seven August Thearchs, the Perfected Who Subdue Demons, the Mysterious and Subtle Heavenly Worthy, and the assembled perfected.\n\n**Concluding Hymn**\nThe rite of thanksgiving for the subduing of demons at the scripture altar is now complete.",
