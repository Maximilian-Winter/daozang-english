To illustrate the principle of the preceding fuel’s exhaustion, fire is transmitted yet never extinguished; when the heart attains the midst of nurturing and nourishment, life continues without cessation.\n\nNurturing life is the very means by which life is generated—how could one know its end? Time never returns, and life never pauses even for a moment. Thus, human existence is but a single breath, a single attainment. The past breath is not the present breath, so by absorbing nourishment, life continues; the preceding fire is not the subsequent fire, so by transmitting fuel, the flame endures. If one grasps the principle of absorbing nourishment, how could the ultimate limit of life be known or its end be fathomed?\n\nThe *Commentary on the Yin符经* states: \"The Grand Duke destroyed life with the ‘One Dissolution’—why does the world employ it through taste?\" The \"One\" refers to the heart’s discernment of the primordial transformations of nature. Thus, those who skillfully destroy life employ dissolution to still the breath, curb desires, and return to the true. This is how long years transform into divine transfiguration—such is the meaning of the \"One Dissolution.\"\n\nThe commentary says: The Grand Duke, a sage, called them the \"Five Thieves,\" while the world calls them the \"Five Virtues.\" People consume the five flavors, yet when they die, none resent or flee—so too with the heart’s indulgence in taste. The sage, with his perfectly true essence, observes these five as nothing but desires, hence calling them the \"Five Thieves.\" The world’s people consume the five flavors, yet when they die, none resent or flee—so too with the heart’s indulgence. This speaks of the masses drowning in the five flavors until the end, for the five desires drive them to act for themselves.\n\nAll desire to live, to be nourished, to mature, to flow freely, to be at peace. Following and granting these, then regulating them, the world pursues its nature, each attaining what it desires. Yet they deem it the work of creation, unaware that they themselves forge their own benefit.\n\nThose in the world who fail to grasp the essentials merely seek flavors to please the palate, fill the belly, and sate the stomach, nourishing their nature and life—fearing only the lack of rich tastes. Yet their viscera, long steeped in desire, steam the heart and disturb the spirit, instead fostering a hundred illnesses, leading to premature death.\n\nThus, the Grand Duke said: \"People consume the five flavors and die, yet none resent or flee.\" Those who do not consume the five flavors are immortals and perfected beings. Guangchengzi considered it \"accumulating fire to burn the Five Poisons.\" The \"Five Poisons\" are the five flavors. If one abandons the five flavors, one may attain long life. This is clearly proven!\n\nI hold that \"accumulating fire\" refers to the heart. Refining the heart, the yang harmony of qi fills the body, spreading qi and circulating fluids. As the heart abides in yang, the five flavors dissolve, and tastes naturally grow bland.\n\nTo aspire to transcendence, one must first cultivate qi. Those who can augment and transform it are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals; those who cannot augment or transform it will not escape the calamity of death. Simply by grasping firmly, closing the breath, and swallowing fluids, qi transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into spirit, spirit into fluid, fluid into bone. The embryo coalesces in the cinnabar field, enduring ceaselessly. Practicing without weariness, the divine radiance overflows the body.\n\nWhenever swallowing qi, one must do so slowly through the throat, without leakage—leakage causes vexation. Each swallow should be unhurried, with a pause of ten breaths in between; another swallow is even better. If one merely swallows, it easily rushes out.\n\nWhen first practicing qi absorption, the mind must be at ease, free of doubt and fear—this ensures great success. If one harbors doubt, the upright qi will struggle to flow. Thus, one must settle the mind and resolve the will.\n\nWhen absorbing qi, the four limbs must be harmonized, the mind joyful and content, desiring nothing. Each day grows more radiant than the last.\n\nWhen consuming grains while absorbing qi, though one may eat, one must not eat to satiety—satiety causes qi to stagnate, and stagnation forces it to reverse and exit. One must utterly avoid pungent and acrid foods, calmly abandoning rich flavors. If one does not restrain oneself, the mind will not be upright, and qi will not flow.\n\nOn days of qi absorption, drinking a little medicinal wine is also excellent, as is consuming boiled lotus, which benefits qi. If qi does not descend, take a small amount of ginger-honey decoction.\n\nBy roaming the mind in the mysterious vastness, free from all thoughts, and with utmost sincerity moving the spirits, one will naturally feel sated, cease grain consumption, and attain longevity—nothing will hinder this.\n\nEven if the chest or heart feels unsettled during qi absorption, it is not harmful. With time, each day will bring improvement.\n\nWhen absorbing qi, one must not consume meat or any fruits, raw vegetables, or the like. If one cannot entirely abstain from meat, one must at least avoid the twelve zodiac animals, lest the abdomen become unsettled. Moreover, with residue and filth in the intestines, the upright qi struggles to flow. Gradually empty the stomach, restraining oneself with patience. Over time, one will perceive a change in spirit and disposition, the four limbs growing stronger, the eyes discerning good and evil. After calming the mind and stabilizing the will for twenty-one days, one may inwardly observe the intestines and stomach, clearly surveying the five viscera in perfect clarity—indescribably wondrous.\n\nWhen qi within the body habitually exits through the mouth and nose, one must control and prevent its escape.\n\nThe immortal formula states:\nTo attain deathlessness, the intestines must be free of residue;\nTo attain long life, the five viscera must be pure;\nTo attain agelessness, return essence to replenish the brain.\nThis is the way of practice.\n\nBeginners must not forget it day or night. Within the four seasons and six periods, one must naturally adapt and grow accustomed. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—even in pavilions—one may absorb qi.\n\nWhen sated, one must close the breath to permeate the entire body, then visualize the qi, sensing the pathway of qi take form.\n\nBefore each qi swallow, first close the eyes, click the teeth, and grasp firmly. Then, visualize the five viscera transforming into beasts: the lungs into a white qilin, the heart into a red qilin, the liver into a green qilin, the spleen into a yellow qilin, and the kidneys into a black qilin. Each emits its proper color from its respective direction, swirling and coiling like five clouds entering the mouth. Then, puff the cheeks to receive it, swallowing as usual. Upon completion, rub the face seven times, calm the mind, click the teeth seven times, and recite the incantation:\n\nGreat auroras radiate their brilliance, clouds and mists spread in all directions. The bound qi coils and bends, the Five-Colored Grotto-Heavens interpenetrate. The divine swallow harmonizes with qi, metals and stones blossom with true essence. Purple mists thicken the void, refining the form to preserve its wholeness. Emerging radiance conceals the profound; the five clouds converge and part. United with the luminous Great Void, one rides the six clouds in due season, harmonizing and gathering them to one’s body, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe incantation complete, again click the teeth seven times and swallow saliva seven times. Be without action, without striving; calm the spirit and settle the will. Do not contend with the qi.\n\nThen await the exhalation, puff the cheeks as an infant suckling at the breast, and swallow. Focus the mind and send it to the cinnabar field. Observe the qi descending along the left side, distinctly hearing it as water crossing a threshold—its sound perfectly clear—this is one qi. After a long while, send another qi. When it feels full, cease; do not overdo it. With time and practice, one comes to know.\n\nWhen first absorbing qi, pause the breath during exhalation. After a short while, it will seem full. As the breath exits, release two-thirds and pause again. After a moment, visualize the abdomen filling. Practice this at dawn and dusk, at midnight and noon. When fullness threatens to escape, chew a small amount of licorice or cinnamon bark, or swallow saliva to gradually disperse it. The cinnabar field need not be completely full, nor should it be forced to fullness.\n\nWhen the primal qi descends, there may naturally be slight oppression—do not let it escape. Whenever qi surges toward the mouth or nose, immediately forcefully swallow saliva, applying effort to gently press it down into the lower abdomen. If it cannot be restrained, reverse the process: draw out the breath, puff the cheeks, strain the lower abdomen, and swallow it back in. With gradual mastery, over time it will no longer escape.\n\nThe explanation of Master Zhuang’s qi method is now complete.",
