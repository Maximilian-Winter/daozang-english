Recite it ten thousand times, and evil spirits will be subdued and vanquished. All wishes shall be granted, all deeds shall succeed. Malevolent ghosts will be subdued, and wayward spirits bound.

You shall ride cloud chariots, pay homage to Heaven and Earth, and be ranked among the immortals.

Whether dwelling in the wilds, encountering warfare, facing calamity or misfortune, besieged within a walled city, or meeting tigers, wolves, venomous snakes, or malevolent ghosts and demonic spirits—amidst all terrors, simply recite this scripture. Do not chant loudly; let no sound escape. Purify your mind, concentrate your intent, and store up sincerity. I shall dispatch divine soldiers to instantly dissolve disasters and misfortunes, and blessings shall naturally arise.\n\nAll divine names, when urgently invoked, shall respond:\nOne hundred thousand Heavenly Masters extend life,\nOne hundred thousand Perfected Ones record destiny,\nOne hundred thousand Golden Lads guard the hun-soul,\nOne hundred thousand Jade Maidens protect the form,\nOne hundred thousand Heavenly Soldiers devour ghosts,\nOne hundred thousand Mighty Warriors consume spirits,\nOne hundred thousand Generals slay demons,\nOne hundred thousand Diamond Gods bind evil,\nOne hundred thousand Dragon Kings rage in fury,\nThunder Lords wield lightning in crisscrossing bolts.\n\nAll they encounter shall be devoured, regardless of name. Waves shall darken the sun, mountains and peaks shall shift, winds and thunder shall roar, and thunderbolts shall crash. The Five Emperors and Five Peaks shall follow the Six Jia, and the Six Ding shall be commanded as well. At their approach, demonic ghosts shall split their skulls, and evil spirits shall have no place to hide. Tigers and wolves shall flee in haste, and blades shall inspire no fear.\n\nThose who recite must focus their minds and not treat this lightly. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao shall be perfected, and you shall naturally journey to Penglai and Yingzhou. The merit of the Great Emperor has been practiced by the Five Emperors.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances of the Most High and the Mysterious Capital!*\n\n**Here ends *The Scripture of the Great Dipper’s Mighty Stalwart Reciting the Demon-Subduing Divine Incantation, Spoken by the Most High.***",
