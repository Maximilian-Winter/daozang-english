  "full_translation": "**The *Yi Lin* (Forest of Changes)**\n\n**Title:** *Yi Lin* (also known as *Jiao Shi Yi Lin*, *Master Jiao’s Forest of Changes*). Authored by Jiao Gong of the Han dynasty. The *Sui Shu·Jing Ji Zhi* records this work in sixteen juan, though the present edition comprises ten juan. Source of the base text: *Wanli Xu Daozang* (Continuation of the Daoist Canon from the Wanli Era).\n\n**Preface to the Sequence of the Upper and Lower Hexagrams of the *Yi Lin***\n\nAll transformations and images, all numbers and symbols, are inescapably bound to the *Yi*. Yet of all things, the deceits and truths of human nature are the most difficult to discern. Diviners still practice their art, dwelling alongside the anxious, offering wisdom and foresight—thus was this method preserved.\n\nYu Yan tilled the fields in the eastern wilds, his vision clouded by hardship. A visitor, deigning to call at his thatched hut, presented him with several scrolls of Jiao’s verses. Yu had once read the biographies in the works of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian], as well as the genealogies of eminent ministers through the ages and the writings of various scholars. These texts all extolled how, after Confucius transmitted the *Yi* to Shang Qu, barely ten successors remained; how Yan Shou passed down the classics and commentaries to Meng Xi, who was his contemporary. During the reigns of Emperors Yuan and Cheng of the Western Han, when governance declined, Master Jiao would emerge or retreat as circumstances demanded, always presenting the Dao of the *Yi* to the Prince of Liang. Thereupon, he was recommended by the commandery and appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Yet even the hidden affairs of the district were foreknown to him, earning him special favor, promotions in rank, and ultimately, his death in office.\n\nHis work, *The Comprehensive Transformations of the Great Yi*, comprises a total of four thousand ninety-six hexagram entries. Though its scope is vast, it converges in simplicity; its phrases borrow from the classics and histories, yet their meaning aligns with the divine. Pure, precise, and single-minded, every judgment proves accurate. The words are plain, but their import profound—easily grasped yet difficult to exhaust. One must not dismiss them as mere verbosity. For later enthusiasts who seek to understand your conduct, Master Ziyun’s work shall endure as immortal.\n\n**Preface to the Collated *Yi Lin* of Jiao Gong**\n\nBy Huang Bosi, Gentleman for Consultation and Collator of the Palace Library, acting in his official capacity:\n\nIn the collation of Jiao Yanshou’s *Yi Lin*, certain characters were found to be erroneous—*kuai* (快) written as *yang* (怏), *yang* (羊) as *shou* (手), *xi* (喜) as *jia* (嘉), *he* (鹤) as *que* (鹊)—though their meanings may be retained in both forms.\n\nJiao Yanshou, whose given name was Gong, was a native of Liang. Through his devotion to learning, he gained the favor of the Prince of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study without restraint. Upon completing his studies, he served as a commandery official and was appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Whenever thieves were about to strike, he knew of it beforehand, and thus none dared act. His merit earned him promotion, and the officials and people petitioned to retain him. The imperial decree granted him an increase in rank, and he died in office at Xiaohuang.\n\nThe world speaks of Yanshou’s method thus: when divining a hexagram, one observes the corresponding forest of changes to determine fortune or misfortune. If the hexagram and lines remain unchanged, one simply examines the verses of the original hexagram and its lines. There was a man named Wang Bi who, in the second year of the Yongxi era, encountered an extraordinary person and divined the hexagram *Guan* (觀) transforming into *Bi* (賁). The *Lin* stated: *\"Eastward travel has no gate; westward, one exits Mount Hua. The path is blocked by peril, and the wanderer meets with calamity.\"* These words proved most accurate. Those who come after must not fail to discern their meaning.\n\nThe works composed by Yanshou, though belonging to the divination texts of the Yin-Yang school, were written in the mid-Western Han, not long after the Three Dynasties. Their language is refined and unadorned, offering much worthy of perusal. Here, they are respectfully recorded.\n\n*Miscellaneous Records*\nThe Elder Fei Zhi of Donglai said: The method of divination through the sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations was compiled by Jiao Yanshou of Tianshui, styled Jianxin, during the reign of Wang Mang. The *Yi* is vast and great indeed. Speaking of what is distant, it cannot be exhausted; speaking of what is near, it is still and correct; speaking of what lies between Heaven and Earth, it is complete. Yet the *Yi* refers to the sixty-four hexagrams—when extended further, it surpasses even the *Shuogua* in what it reveals. Thus, the *Lianshan*, *Guicang*, and *Zhouyi* all differ in their words yet share the same hexagrams. Though the three schools circulated concurrently, they still represent but one corner. Gong excelled in Yin-Yang studies and further devised this method to illuminate what the *Yi* had not yet shown. His predictions of fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin, often proved accurate when they matched the category of the matter at hand. For trivial or unrelated affairs, however, they often failed. Gong’s mastery of subtle principles was but one corner of the sage’s wisdom. Yanshou alone inherited the teachings of the recluses.\n\nThe *Book of Han* states: Jing Fang, styled Junming, studied the *Yi* under Jiao Yanshou of Liang, whose given name was Gong. Gong was poor and of low status but devoted to learning, earning the favor of the King of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study to his heart’s content. After completing his studies, he became a local official and was later recommended for promotion to magistrate of Xiaohuang.\n\nHaving anticipated and detected treachery and villainy in advance, he prevented the outbreak of theft and banditry. He cherished and nurtured the officials and common folk, so that moral transformation flourished throughout the county. When selected as the most outstanding for promotion, the village elders and his subordinates petitioned to retain Gong, and an imperial edict granted him an increased stipend to remain. He eventually died in Xiaohuang.\n\nGong once remarked: “The one who will bring ruin upon himself through me is Jing.” His teachings excelled in interpreting disasters and omens. He divided the sixty hexagrams, assigning each to govern a day in sequence, using wind, rain, cold, and warmth as observational signs, each with its own prognostications. Fang applied these methods with particular precision.\n\nMeng Kang notes: The method of assigning hexagrams to days operates such that one line governs one day, and sixty hexagrams account for three hundred and sixty days. The remaining four hexagrams—*Zhen* (Thunder), *Li* (Fire), *Dui* (Lake), and *Kan* (Water)—serve as the officials overseeing the regional lords and inspectors. The reason for employing *Zhen*, *Li*, *Kan*, and *Dui* is that they correspond to the days of the solstices and equinoxes, when the qi of the four seasons each holds sway in turn. Each hexagram governs a day, and the method of divination involves observing auspicious and inauspicious signs on its respective day.\n\n*Recorded Verifications* by Cheng Jiong of Shasui.\n\nDuring the closing years of the Xuanhe era, Chancellor Cui of Changqingfu served as prefect of a commandery. At that time, the realm was at peace, and he reverently consulted this sacred text, casting the hexagram *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), which read:\n\n*\"The canonical records and legal texts,*\n*Stored in the Orchid Terrace.*\n*Though chaos and ruin spread,*\n*They alone escape disaster.\"*\n\nHe then drew the line statement for *Dun* (Retreat):\n\n*\"The seat still warm,*\n*Trouble knocks at the door.*\n*Over the wall to flee north—*\n*Soldiers come behind,*\n*Yet one escapes the tiger’s jaws.\"*\n\nTen days after his divination, the commandery fell into turmoil. Chancellor Cui scaled the wall and fled, his family unharmed and untouched by misfortune. Upon returning to the capital, he recognized that this book was the work of a sage. Though its meanings were initially difficult to grasp, upon later reflection, none failed to align with events. Those who encounter it should hold it in utmost reverence. Gold itself is precious, yet it cannot compare to the worth of this text.\n\nAt the end of the Shaoxing era, Wanyan Liang invaded. Someone then consulted Jiao Gong’s *Forest of Changes* and cast the hexagram *Jie* (Deliverance) transforming into *Dazhuang* (Great Strength), which read:\n\n*\"The arrogant Hu, fiery in form,*\n*Devises evil and commits atrocities.*\n*Nothing he undertakes succeeds—*\n*He brings ruin upon himself.\"*\n\nSo precise was its correspondence that even the celestial net’s gentle breeze could not surpass it. Since the dawn of time, only Liang could be said to fulfill this prophecy. How did Yan Shou, in composing his work, foresee that later ages would produce such a figure? Was it because Han-dynasty Jiao Yanshou transmitted the *Changes* to Meng Xi? The account appears in the *\"Biographies of Confucian Scholars.\"* This is the very book he authored.\n\nAt the front of the text, Fei Zhi inscribed a preface, stating: \"The sixty-four hexagrams transform [into one another].\" Later, Wang Yu of the Tang dynasty added a preface. Each hexagram transforms into sixty-four variations, totaling four thousand ninety-six verses, all composed in rhyming lines. These closely resemble the phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*—such as *\"Phoenixes in flight, harmonious their cries, resonant and clear\"*—or those in the *Book of Han*—such as *\"Great Cross, geng-geng, I am the Heavenly King.\"* Could it be that diviners of antiquity possessed such texts?\n\nIn the cyclical year *Zhaoyang Dahuangluo*, during the month of *Huangji*, on the day of the Supreme Ultimate, the divination ritual proceeds as follows:\n\n**Divination Apparatus**\nSelect a clean, secluded space to establish the *shishi* (divination chamber), its door facing south. Place the *lin* (divination table) at the chamber’s center. The table should be roughly five *chi* in length and three *chi* in width, positioned not too close to the walls. Prepare fifty stalks of *shi* (yarrow), wrapped in fragrant silk and encased in a black pouch, then stored in a *du* (receptacle) placed to the north of the table. The *du* may be made of bamboo, sturdy wood, or lacquered cloth, with a circular diameter of three *cun*, matching the length of the *shi*. It should be half base, half lid, with a separate stand to prevent tipping. Set a wooden frame south of the *du*, positioned at the northern two-thirds of the table. The frame, constructed from horizontal wooden planks, should be one *chi* in height, spanning the table’s length, with two large notches carved at the center, spaced one *chi* apart. To the west of the large notches, three small notches are made, each spaced roughly five *cun* apart, with horizontal feet affixed to stand upright on the table. Place one incense burner south of the frame and one incense box south of the burner. Burn incense daily to show reverence.\n\nBefore divination, sweep and wipe the area clean. Prepare one inkstone with water, one brush, one inkstick, and one yellow-lacquered board, placing them to the east of the burner, aligned from east to west.\n\nThe diviner, having purified himself and donned clean robes and cap, faces north, washes his hands, and burns incense to pay respects. The diviner’s northward orientation follows the *Etiquette and Ceremonial*. If someone else commissions the divination, the host burns incense, then steps back slightly to stand facing north. The diviner advances, stands slightly west of the table’s front, and faces south to receive the inquiry. The host states the matter to be divined directly, and the diviner assents. The host turns right and stands facing west, while the diviner turns right to face north.\n\nWith both hands, the diviner lifts the lid of the *du*, places it south of the frame and north of the burner, removes the *shi* from the *du*, discards the pouch and silk wrapping, and sets them east of the *du*. Combining the fifty stalks, he holds them in both hands and passes them over the incense burner. The subsequent use of the *shi* stalks follows the explanations in the *Primer of Enlightenment*.\n\nHe then recites the invocation:\n*\"By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy;*\n*By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy.*\n*[Name and title of the inquirer] now seeks clarity on [matter in question].*\n*Is it auspicious or inauspicious? Will there be gain or loss, regret or remorse, worry or peril?*\n*You, who are spiritually attuned, I beseech to reveal the truth.\"*\n\nWith his right hand, he takes one stalk and sets it aside in the *du*. Then, dividing the remaining forty-nine stalks with both hands, he places them in the left and right large notches of the frame. This is the first operation, *\"dividing into two to symbolize the Two [Forces].\"*\n\nNext, with his left hand, he takes the stalks from the left large notch and holds them, while with his right hand, he removes one stalk from the right large notch and *\"hangs\"* it between the little finger of his left hand. This is the second operation, *\"hanging one to symbolize the Three [Powers].\"*\n\nThen, with his right hand, he counts off the stalks in his left hand in groups of four. This is half of the third operation, *\"counting by fours to symbolize the four seasons.\"*\n\nHe then gathers the remaining stalks—whether one, two, three, or four—and *\"binds\"* them between the ring finger of his left hand. This is half of the fourth operation, *\"returning the remainder to the bind to symbolize the intercalary [month].\"*\n\nNext, he returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the left large notch, then takes the stalks from the right large notch and holds them, counting them off in groups of four with his left hand. This is the other half of the third operation. He then gathers the remaining stalks as before and binds them between the middle finger of his left hand. This is the other half of the fourth operation, *\"binding again to symbolize the second intercalary [month].\"*\n\nAfter the first change, the remaining stalks will follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, three must remain on the right; if two on the left, two on the right; if three on the left, one on the right; if four on the left, four on the right. Including the *\"hung\"* stalk, the total will be either five or nine. Five, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; nine, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, there are three odds to one even.\n\nHe then returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the right large notch and places the one *\"hung\"* and two *\"bound\"* stalks onto the first small notch of the frame, with the east side as the upper position (subsequent placements follow this order). This completes the first change.\n\nNext, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty-four or forty stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the first change, placing the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks onto the second small notch of the frame. This completes the second change.\n\nAfter the second change, the remaining stalks follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, two must remain on the right; if two on the left, one on the right; if three on the left, four on the right; if four on the left, three on the right. Including the *\"hung\"* stalk, the total will be either four or eight. Four, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; eight, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, odds and evens each account for two of the four possibilities.\n\nOnce more, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty, thirty-six, or thirty-two stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the second change, placing the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks onto the third small notch of the frame. This completes the third change. The remaining stalks after the third change follow the same pattern as the second.\n\nAfter the three changes, he examines the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks obtained from each change and draws the line on the board. If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total five or four, they are odd; if nine or eight, they are even. If the three *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* counts are all odd (thirteen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) total thirty-six, forming an *\"old yang\"* line, drawn as ⚊ (a solid line), known as *\"double.\"*\n\nIf the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total two odd and one even (seventeen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) number thirty-two, forming a *\"young yin\"* line, drawn as -- (a broken line), known as *\"split.\"* If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total two even and one odd (twenty-one stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-eight, forming a *\"young yang\"* line, drawn as 一 (a single solid line), known as *\"single.\"* If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total three even (twenty-five stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-four, forming an *\"old yin\"* line, drawn as ⚋ (a double broken line), known as *\"crossed.\"* Thus, every three changes form a line.\n\nThe first, fourth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, and sixteenth changes—six in total—follow the same pattern. However, from the third change onward, the count is not announced, and only forty-nine stalks are used. The second, fifth, eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, and seventeenth changes—six in total—also follow the same pattern. The third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, and eighteenth changes—six in total—likewise follow the same pattern. In all, eighteen changes form a hexagram. Then, one examines the hexagram’s transformations to divine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the matter. Diagrams and explanations of hexagram transformations are found in *Qimeng*.\n\nWhen the ritual is complete, the diviner conceals the stalks, wraps them, places them in a case, covers it, gathers the brush and inkstone, and the black board. Then, he burns incense, pays respects, and retires. If someone else performs the divination, the host burns incense, bows to the diviner, and retreats.\n\n**Alternative Method Using Objects**\nZhu Yong states: Divining the *Changes* with milfoil stalks is the ancient method. In recent times, coins have been used to cast lines for convenience, but this cannot fully embody the Way of divination. Traditionally, the side of a coin with characters was considered yin, and the blank side yang. Thus, two tails (yin) formed a *\"split\"* (--), a broken line, while two heads (yang) formed a *\"single\"* (一), a solid line. Zhu Xi, however, held that the side with characters was the *face* (yang), and the blank side the *back* (yin). Since all things’ faces belong to yang and backs to yin, he reversed the old method, and scholars of Jian’an universally adopted his view. Some say that in ancient times, metal was cast into cowries or coins called *dao* or *quan*, with the yin side bearing inscriptions like the reverse of a mirror. Whether one side was yin and the other yang remains uncertain.\n\nGenerally, divination must use milfoil stalks; if seeking simplicity, the method must still be exhaustive. I once crafted three wooden spheres, each with six faces. On three faces of each sphere, three lines were carved; on the other three, two lines. When cast, they encompass all variations of old/young yin and yang. The three spheres, each with six faces, embody the principle of eighteen changes. Three faces (three lines each) represent the nine of *Qian* (☰), while three faces (two lines each) represent the six of *Kun* (☷). This reflects the use of spheres and the number eight.\n\nThe three lines of *Qian*’s single line contain three, while the two lines of *Kun*’s single line divide into two—this is the doctrine of *\"three heavens, two earths.\"* When all three spheres land on three, they form nine, the number of *\"old yang.\"* When all land on two, they form six, the number of *\"old yin.\"* Two twos and one three form seven, the number of *\"young yang.\"* Two threes and one two form eight, the number of *\"young yin.\"* The lines of *Qian* and *Kun* are used to form the eight trigrams, symbolizing *Qian* and *Kun* giving birth to the six children.\n\nThe spheres represent the One of the Supreme Ultimate. Three threes form *Qian* (☰), and three twos form *Kun* (☷), symbolizing the Two (yin and yang). The three spheres represent the Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Each sphere’s total is fifteen, the number of the *Luoshu*’s supreme pole. The combined total of the three spheres is forty-five, the number of the *Hetu*’s nine palaces. If two appear above, three lie below; if three appear above, two lie below—movement and stillness both yield five. Thus, five is concealed within the operation, and when combined with forty-five, it becomes the *Dayan*’s number of fifty.\n\nWhen three spheres form nine above, three spheres conceal six below—this is the body of *\"old yang\"* transforming into yin. When three spheres form six above, three spheres conceal nine below—this is the body of *\"old yin\"* transforming into yang. Two and three oppose each other, and each sphere contains three and five—this is the principle of *\"interweaving and varying numbers.\"* The spheres are round and revolving, embodying ceaseless change. The six positions interact, circulating through the six voids. Three spheres cast six times complete a day, also reflecting the principle of eighteen changes.\n\nThis method avoids the ambiguity of coin faces and backs regarding yin and yang, while encompassing all variations of old/young yin and yang. I have shared this with like-minded scholars, who found it reasonable, and thus recorded the method for the world to follow.\n\nWhen a hexagram’s lines are obtained, old lines change while young lines do not. If a line changes, a new hexagram is derived. The sequence of hexagrams in the *Yilin*’s *Upper and Lower Canon* concludes here.\n\nThe original text mistakenly writes \"一\" (one); based on the context, it should be corrected to \"一\" (one).\n\n*Yilin* Canon Catalogue\n**Upper Canon**\nQian, Kun, Zhun, Meng, Xu, Song, Shi, Bi\nXiaoxu, Lü, Tai, Pi, Tongren, Dayou, Qian, Yu\nSui, Gu, Lin, Guan, Shihe, Bi, Bo, Fu\nWuwang, Daxu, Yi,

The sacred tortoise dwells on land; the cauldron’s rice is mixed with dirt. The people foresee the state’s ruin—Jie’s chaos knows no order.\n\n**Ming Yi** | Gathering stones to carve jade, none remain uncut. I raise the dragon’s form; Lu Ban is my aid.

Toiling brings regret—no timely exit is found.\n\n**Yi** | Qin’s armies contend in strength, losing their integrity and goodness. They defeat my homeland of Ban.\n\n**Guai** | The cruel remove the good and suspect the loyal—difficult to cure. The thoroughbred, trapped in a washbasin cart, is tormented by bit and whip.\n\n**Jian** | Grasping a bamboo shoot to strike the fox, shouldering a bow to shoot the fish.\n\nNot its proper vessel or use—it wearies the heart of its own accord.\n\n**Cui** | The covenant at Kuiqiu, tribute offered in Jin’s court.

Above and below, no peril—this is my blessed fortune.\n\n**Guimei** | The eight talents ascend, accomplishing great deeds. The dragon descends to the palace courtyard; the land knows no disaster.\n\n**Feng** | The thatch wears thin, holes gaping—no one upholds the ancestral home. Servants and maids flee; son west, father east—calamity befalls the self.\n\n**Lü** | Crows dance over the city walls, the town trembles in sudden fear. Virtue unnurtured, it is overthrown by those below.\n\n**Xun** | The five grains fail to ripen; the people suffer hardship and distress. Driving southward, joy and gain are found.\n\n**Dui** | Yellow robes establish the era; virtue and power reside within. Blessings overflow, enfeoffed as lord of Qi. The market knows no gate—wealth and honor abound.\n\n**Gua** | Qi binds the thatch of Guo’s hut, marrying into the Luo capital. Fine and fair, the profit is ten thousandfold.\n\n**Jie** | A bed of comfort, thick quilts—yet one cannot stay long. Forsaking my joyous feast, I am stranded in the southern land. The worry of casting the shuttle—no true disaster comes.\n\n**Zhongfu** | The inner collapses, the body harmed; chaos within, no constancy. Though fine grain abounds, none may eat it.\n\n**Xiaoguo** | Stepping out, I meet misfortune—enmity with disaster. Another bears a sharp blade; my fingertip is wounded.\n\n**Jiji** | Moving in and out with timely measure, no cares in south or north. The traveler arrives at once; those abroad return home.\n\n**Weiji** | The duke’s grandson drives the chariot, touring eastward to Qi. Yanling praises the estate, leaving Ji with stored robes.\n\n---\n\n**Jian (Hexagram 53)**\n\n**Jian** | Parting and scattering, the eldest son joins the army. Uncle Ya falls to bandits; the widow and elder live alone—none plant melons.\n\n**Qian** | Sowing beans at dawn, by dusk they become thick soup. The heart’s desire is fulfilled—joy and contentment abound.\n\n**Kun** | The leopard flies, the gate opens—great troubles dissolve, no harm to the self.\n\n**Zhun** | East mountain, west mountain, each at rest. Though they gaze upon one another, they never share the hall.\n\n**Meng** | Where the flock of crows gathers, a great monstrosity lurks. Nine bodies without heads—the soul startled, the spirit flees. No place to dwell.\n\n**Zhen** | To Meng: Chaos and strife intertwine; the people are desolate. Pursued to the west of Ji, the Di’s maidservants take advantage.\n\n**Song** | Where the qilin and phoenix soar, the land knows no misfortune. The market yields tenfold profit, returning to a land of kindness.\n\n**Shi** | Digging a well for jade, not the treasure of the Bian clan. The body is shamed, the name dishonored—labor yields no gain.\n\n**Bi** | The mountain’s striped tiger and leopard, plump and rich with fat. The noble scion attains his wish—blessings towering high.\n\n**Xiaoxu** | The prosperity of Zhou Cheng: punishments set aside, evil removed. The Grand Steward bestows favor; the noble practices benevolence.\n\n**Lü** | Jade tablets and scepters, holding gifts to meet the king. Nurturing the people of a hundred li, answering the summons of Qi and Qin.\n\n**Xu** | Collapsing, leaking, broken and worn—shattered pillars, cracked tiles. The potter cannot mend them; the bricklayer does not chisel.\n\n**Pi** | The swan flies along the shore; the lord departs, never to return. Uncle Bo lodges as a guest.\n\n**Tongren** | Frogs gather in throngs, beseeching heaven for rain. Thunder rumbles, lightning strikes—timely, the rain falls, fulfilling their wish.\n\n**Dayou** | The old and weak, childless, cannot care for themselves. Though the people grieve, in the end, they do not escape blame. When Guanzi governed the state, the feudal lords submitted as guests. Eight hundred chariots bore him, exalting our Lord Huan’s virtue.\n\n**Qian** | The plum tree’s branches sway and break, parting from its mother, forever estranged, never to know one another.\n\n**Yu** | Abundance within does not cease, yet in decline and old age, clumsiness returns. Fullness and excess bring loss; sores fester while the gall grows fat. Zheng Zhao lost his state, while Chong’er rose to power.\n*Alternate text:* When prosperity departs, decline follows; when emaciation leaves, fatness returns. Zheng Zhao lost his state, while Chong’er seized the moment.\n\n**Sui** | Hearing the tiger has entered the town, the heart flees in terror. Running to Yangzong, I do not see Huo Shu—freed from all hidden woes.\n\n**Gu** | Following the times, seizing opportunity, never missing the gate of profit. Gaining much, blessed with fortune, richer than a lord of the marches.\n\n**Lin** | Yu cast the sacred tripods, while Boyi pointed the way. The axe’s blade now broken, the pillar stands alone, leaning. Goods brought to market unsold—withered and withering, a curse.\n\n**Guan** | Spring swans fly east, exchanging horses for gold.

No life-giving rain descends; governance proceeds without doubt.\n\n**Li** | The hard and the soft call to one another, two clans become one household. Frost descends, and together they bestow kindness with benevolence.\n\n**Xian** | A loving mother cherishes her child, feasting and bestowing upon the virtuous scholar. The southern tribes submit; the people rejoice in fear.\n\n**Heng** | The good man and Lady Kong, trembling, ascend the tower. Le Ji does not assist; Wei Zhe flees in haste.\n*Variant:* Zhai Ji.\n\n**Lü** | The elder son, loyal and upright, is betrayed by the Ji clan.

Though dimmed and without luster, the people receive great fortune.\n\n**Jin** | Driving sheep southward, I encounter misfortune. Wolves startle my horse; tigers steal my child—grief and regret, self-blame.\n\n**Ming Yi** | Father Ni, Confucius, skilled at angling carp. With one cast of the net, ten thousand fish are caught, enriching my home.\n\n**Jiaren** | The root not firm, blossoms and leaves fall away, leaving only a solitary widow.\n\n**Kui** | Setting nets to catch fish, instead I snare a pig. Yuan’s loyalty exhausted, the Wu clan is annihilated.\n\n**Jian** | Swift and agile, like an ape leaping through trees. Though the vermilion bow is tuned, in the end, nothing is caught.\n\n**Xie** | Donning cap and sash, journeying south, I meet fortune as promised.

The proper mandate falters; the common folk teem with affliction.\n\n**Kun** | The southern state’s youngest son, gifted and fair of mien, seeks my eldest daughter.

Eyes strain wide, ears ring hollow; none share in laughter or speech.\n\n**Song** | *See* **Guimei**. Beyond the frontier, fine livestock are gained, and marriages are made. The wise and worthy gather, consulting on affairs. Yet the city is overthrown, the household left in turmoil.\n\n**Pi** | Molten sand in scorching heat—few remain unspoiled. Three *li* from the river, my profitable trade is ruined. The old hand rears horses—what regret in leaving them?\n\n**Tongren** | Under Jia, Yi, Wu, and Geng, one moves with the seasons. No fixed rhythm is lost; sprouts bend to the measure. All emerge in harmony, each delighting in its kind. *See* **Jian’s Lü**.\n\n**Dayou** | Wandering by night, I meet my lord. Sorrows untangled, the heart is freed from care.\n\n**Qian** | A dead friend, a severed bond—clever words become slander.

Carving stone yields no harvest; rushing rites brings no renown. The seamstress loses her needle, the loom stands idle.\n\n**Bo** | The sacred turtle stranded on land, suddenly bereft of its place. Yi Zi returns to plow, but Jie’s chaos finds no aid.\n\n**Fu** | The house stands by the plain’s edge, yet is swept away to become the sea.

No child is lost young; the nation prospers, its people treasured. The anxious gaze upon it, and even the hatred of thieves and bandits ceases.\n\n**Heng** | In the land of harmonious joy, delight becomes my blessing. From the eastern peaks to the southern mountains, crossing brings favor and gratitude.\n\n**Zhu** | The sorrow of the grieving man—his steps falter, his face changes. Bringing ruin upon himself, he must guard his own conduct.\n\nEmbracing joy in mutual embrace, the eldest son reaches venerable age, receiving blessings and divine favor.\n\n**Great Strength** | The Grand Duke fled from Zhou, concealed in seclusion for seventy years. At last, he met the sagely Wen, becoming the kingdom’s pillar.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Kun**\n\n**Jin** | On the upper reaches of the Jiang and Han, governance is perverse and the people grieve.

A loyal minister lacks support, beset by trouble and fault.\n\n**Release** | Three offerings, five omens—together they proceed. Lost in an empty marsh, following the valley due north. Traversing six brambles, one is harmed and defeated.\n\n**Decrease** | Contending for the oriole, the sheep is lost; the golden pouch vanishes. Gains are short-lived—the woes of Chen and Cai find peace only through Chu.\n\n**Heng’s Central**\n\n**Increase** | Three black steeds bear the crossbeam, journeying south to gather fragrant angelica. Autumn orchids, rich and sweet, fill the sacred coffer, benefiting my middle and youngest brothers.\n\n**Gua** | In the first month of spring, on the day *ji-chou*, one calls out to Uncle Zhong. When bright virtue ends, tyranny and cruelty flourish.\n\n**Pregnancy** | \"The shoe does not fit the foot\"—the southern mountain bears many leaves. A household with orchids and angelica knows no illness.\n\n**Gathering** | Three legs, no head—it knows not where to go. The heart is mad, the eyes are wounded; let none make it see, for it beholds not the daylight.\n\n**Ascending** | Supporting Yao and aiding Yu, the towering pines and Pengzu. Passing west of the Queen Mother, the road is smooth and easy—none dare oppose.\n\n**The Army’s Li**\n\n**Distress** | Fading, fading away—woe and misfortune entwine. Separated by rocky mountains, the household scatters.\n\n**The Well** | The sacred tortoise on land, suddenly displaced. Yi’s son returns to plowing; Jie’s chaos lacks aid.\n\n**Revolution** | Benevolent virtue spreads, grace extending to distant lands. Blessings reach foreign realms, while hidden calamities lurk.

The cruel lord ruins the state, causing years to be cut short.\n\n**Thunder** | Though fire blazes fiercely, it is behind me. Though bandits are many, they are to my right.

The stubborn and reckless gather, breeding my fear and dread.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Small Livestock**\n\n**Gradual Progress** | Suspended over the southern sea, ten thousand *li* from home. The flying hare and swift steed—one day I see my mother, dispelling my sorrow and regret.\n\n**Abundance** | Obstructed, then through—though pressed, not impoverished. At last, the wish is fulfilled; Ji and Jiang follow together.\n\n**Travel** | The western merchant in Ba and Shu, the cold snow reaching the hub. Wishing to advance but unable, he returns to an empty chamber.\n\n**Wind** | Building a new tomb, it collapses and is hard to ascend. Three colts push the cart, stumbling and wounding the jaw.\n\n**Lake** | Stretching the neck to gaze at wine, it does not enter my mouth. Hollow-eyed, self-tormenting—the gain is nothing, yet the recluse is pleased.\n\n**Exchange** | Mid-spring to early summer, where harmonious *qi* dwells. It brings me joy and fortune; the land knows no ruin or thieves.\n\n**Moderation** | Casting a net to catch the turtledove, the hare escapes its harm. Male and female both caught, they are sold and betrayed.\n\n**Li** should be *li* (suffering).\n\n**Inner Truth** | Three travel together; one speaks of going north.

The spirits are angered by injustice; ghosts strike the eyes.\n\n**Desire** | Seeking fortune and profit, instead one harms oneself.\n\n**Da Gu’s Observation**\n\n**Completion** | Presenting words to convey sincerity, bringing peace without collapse. Increasing blessings and longevity, achieving fame and success.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Jin**\n\n**Incompletion** | Fire burns the lord’s bed, the household is destroyed. Yet peace and prosperity come—first sorrow, then heavy mourning.\n\n**Feng (Abundance)**\n\n**All Under Heaven** | The young merchants travel, crossing mountains and perilous paths.

In the Dinghai year of the Baoqing reign, I first obtained the book in Putian, transcribed it, and stored it away. Its verses were ancient and elegant, much like the divination phrases recorded in the *Zuozhuan*. I once tried divining with it, and it proved accurate, though I regretted that it contained many omissions and errors, with no other editions for correction.\n\nIn the Gengzi year of the Jiaxi reign, returning from Wumen to Xiaochuan, I happened to meet Prefectural Assistant Magistrate Wang Youdao, who borrowed my family’s copy. Though it also had many omissions and errors, by comparing the two versions, I corrected about eighty or ninety percent. Thus, both our family’s and Wang’s copies became complete. However, there were still many repetitions, with some verses shared by several lines, making verification impossible.\n\nAfter collation, I returned the book to the Wang family and recorded the corrected version at the end of this volume. Written on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Xinchou year of the Chunyou reign, by Gui Yue of Xizhai.\n\n**Postscript to the *Yilin***\nThe Dao of the *Yi* encompasses all things, yet scholars grasp only one aspect of it—none can claim it is not the *Yi*. The *Yi* existed in the Xia and Shang dynasties as the Three *Yi*. Later, the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* were lost, leaving only the *Zhouyi* in transmission.\n\nBy the Han dynasty, the *Zhouyi* had branched into three schools: the *Yi* of Tian He, the *Yi* of Jiao Gan, and the *Yi* of Fei Zhi. Tian He’s *Yi* was transmitted from Confucius, dividing the text into upper and lower sections, with the Ten Wings as Confucius’ work, complete with chapter-and-verse commentary. Jiao Gan’s *Yi* specialized in divination and observation, as seen in the *Yilin*’s sixteen volumes. Fei Zhi’s *Yi* excelled in hexagram divination, lacking chapter-and-verse commentary, relying solely on images, symbols, and the *Wenyan* to interpret the text within the eight trigrams.\n\nBy the end of the Han, the schools of Tian and Jiao had declined, leaving only Fei’s lineage. After Fei, scholars like Zheng Kangcheng and Wang Bi annotated it. In the Song, Cheng Yi of Luoyang based his commentary on Wang Bi’s *Yi*, which derived from Fei’s. Zhu Xi of Huian, following Lü Bogong’s *Ancient Yi*, grounded his *Benyi* in Tian He’s tradition. Thus, the *Yi* of Tian and Fei flourished, while Jiao’s *Yi* alone lacked transmission.\n\nRecently, while examining books in the imperial archives, I discovered the *Yilin*. Its verses and rhymes were beyond later generations’ reach, resembling the divination phrases in the *Zuozhuan*. I transcribed and stored it, and on occasion, used it for divination—it never failed to prove accurate. Could Jiao’s *Yi* truly lack a foundation?\n\nAlas, my shallow learning prevents me from writing a commentary to propagate it, aiding people in seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune. I record this to await a capable scholar. Written on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month in the Guisi year of the Chenghua reign, by the later student Peng Hua of Ancheng.\n\n**Afterword to the *Yilin***\nThe *Yi* embodies the four sagely Dao: those who speak value its words, those who act value its changes, those who craft tools value its images, and those who divine value its prognostications. These four are all transformations, the work of the numinous.\n\nI read Jiao’s *Yilin*, which expands the sixty-four hexagrams into four thousand ninety-six, each with its own words, changes, images, and divinations. Its meaning is profound and probing, its language concise and ancient, truly revealing what Fu Xi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius left unsaid, and unlocking the wonders of resolving doubts, achieving tasks, and comprehending aspirations. It is all laid bare upon opening the book.\n\nBefore entering office, I always regretted not having seen it. When I governed Wugong, Master Duishan showed it to me. After repeated recitation and reflection, I ordered its printing to broaden its transmission, privately noting the date here. Written in the second month of spring in the fourth year of the Jiajing reign, by Jiang En of Guang’an, on the publication of Jiao’s *Yilin*.\n\nThose who discuss the *Yi* often regard Jiao’s *Yilin* as swift and accurate for divination and observation, yet lament its rarity. Recently, I obtained a copy printed by Prefect Kang of Duishan, entrusted to the magistrate of Wugong, and those who seek it now come in droves.\n\nOne day, while attending Military Commissioner Qi of Rongchuan during a judicial inquiry where doubts remained unresolved, he turned to me and said, \"If only Jiao Yanshou were here—nothing would escape his detection.\" I withdrew and performed a divination, obtaining the hexagram *Lawsuit* transforming into *Following*, with the verse:\n\n*\"Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding—*\n*All return to my court.*\n*Three Chou, six sons—*\n*Entering the gate, they see their mother.\"*\n\nFive days later, the case was solved. Upon checking the date, it was the day *yichou*, and those involved in the lawsuit numbered precisely six. Those who heard of this marveled even more at the book, and requests for copies never ceased at my door. Thus, I reprinted it for completion, wishing to guide those who grapple with doubts toward proper action and avoidance, so that Jiao’s *Changes*—long a hidden secret—might once more be widely disseminated. Written on the tenth day of mid-summer in the *jiawu* year of the Jiajing reign, by Ma Lin of Chang’an.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Yi Lin* (Forest of Changes)**\n\n**Title:** *Yi Lin* (also known as *Jiao Shi Yi Lin*, *Master Jiao’s Forest of Changes*). Authored by Jiao Gong of the Han dynasty. The *Sui Shu·Jing Ji Zhi* records this work in sixteen juan, though the present edition comprises ten juan. Source of the base text: *Wanli Xu Daozang* (Continuation of the Daoist Canon from the Wanli Era).\n\n**Preface to the Sequence of the Upper and Lower Hexagrams of the *Yi Lin***\n\nAll transformations and images, all numbers and symbols, are inescapably bound to the *Yi*. Yet of all things, the deceits and truths of human nature are the most difficult to discern. Diviners still practice their art, dwelling alongside the anxious, offering wisdom and foresight—thus was this method preserved.\n\nYu Yan tilled the fields in the eastern wilds, his vision clouded by hardship. A visitor, deigning to call at his thatched hut, presented him with several scrolls of Jiao’s verses. Yu had once read the biographies in the works of Ban [Gu] and Sima [Qian], as well as the genealogies of eminent ministers through the ages and the writings of various scholars. These texts all extolled how, after Confucius transmitted the *Yi* to Shang Qu, barely ten successors remained; how Yan Shou passed down the classics and commentaries to Meng Xi, who was his contemporary. During the reigns of Emperors Yuan and Cheng of the Western Han, when governance declined, Master Jiao would emerge or retreat as circumstances demanded, always presenting the Dao of the *Yi* to the Prince of Liang. Thereupon, he was recommended by the commandery and appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Yet even the hidden affairs of the district were foreknown to him, earning him special favor, promotions in rank, and ultimately, his death in office.\n\nHis work, *The Comprehensive Transformations of the Great Yi*, comprises a total of four thousand ninety-six hexagram entries. Though its scope is vast, it converges in simplicity; its phrases borrow from the classics and histories, yet their meaning aligns with the divine. Pure, precise, and single-minded, every judgment proves accurate. The words are plain, but their import profound—easily grasped yet difficult to exhaust. One must not dismiss them as mere verbosity. For later enthusiasts who seek to understand your conduct, Master Ziyun’s work shall endure as immortal.\n\n**Preface to the Collated *Yi Lin* of Jiao Gong**\n\nBy Huang Bosi, Gentleman for Consultation and Collator of the Palace Library, acting in his official capacity:\n\nIn the collation of Jiao Yanshou’s *Yi Lin*, certain characters were found to be erroneous—*kuai* (快) written as *yang* (怏), *yang* (羊) as *shou* (手), *xi* (喜) as *jia* (嘉), *he* (鹤) as *que* (鹊)—though their meanings may be retained in both forms.\n\nJiao Yanshou, whose given name was Gong, was a native of Liang. Through his devotion to learning, he gained the favor of the Prince of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study without restraint. Upon completing his studies, he served as a commandery official and was appointed magistrate of Xiaohuang. Whenever thieves were about to strike, he knew of it beforehand, and thus none dared act. His merit earned him promotion, and the officials and people petitioned to retain him. The imperial decree granted him an increase in rank, and he died in office at Xiaohuang.\n\nThe world speaks of Yanshou’s method thus: when divining a hexagram, one observes the corresponding forest of changes to determine fortune or misfortune. If the hexagram and lines remain unchanged, one simply examines the verses of the original hexagram and its lines. There was a man named Wang Bi who, in the second year of the Yongxi era, encountered an extraordinary person and divined the hexagram *Guan* (觀) transforming into *Bi* (賁). The *Lin* stated: *\"Eastward travel has no gate; westward, one exits Mount Hua. The path is blocked by peril, and the wanderer meets with calamity.\"* These words proved most accurate. Those who come after must not fail to discern their meaning.",

      "translated_text": "The works composed by Yanshou, though belonging to the divination texts of the Yin-Yang school, were written in the mid-Western Han, not long after the Three Dynasties. Their language is refined and unadorned, offering much worthy of perusal. Here, they are respectfully recorded.\n\n*Miscellaneous Records*\nThe Elder Fei Zhi of Donglai said: The method of divination through the sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations was compiled by Jiao Yanshou of Tianshui, styled Jianxin, during the reign of Wang Mang. The *Yi* is vast and great indeed. Speaking of what is distant, it cannot be exhausted; speaking of what is near, it is still and correct; speaking of what lies between Heaven and Earth, it is complete. Yet the *Yi* refers to the sixty-four hexagrams—when extended further, it surpasses even the *Shuogua* in what it reveals. Thus, the *Lianshan*, *Guicang*, and *Zhouyi* all differ in their words yet share the same hexagrams. Though the three schools circulated concurrently, they still represent but one corner. Gong excelled in Yin-Yang studies and further devised this method to illuminate what the *Yi* had not yet shown. His predictions of fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin, often proved accurate when they matched the category of the matter at hand. For trivial or unrelated affairs, however, they often failed. Gong’s mastery of subtle principles was but one corner of the sage’s wisdom. Yanshou alone inherited the teachings of the recluses.\n\nThe *Book of Han* states: Jing Fang, styled Junming, studied the *Yi* under Jiao Yanshou of Liang, whose given name was Gong. Gong was poor and of low status but devoted to learning, earning the favor of the King of Liang, who provided for his needs and allowed him to study to his heart’s content. After completing his studies, he became a local official and was later recommended for promotion to magistrate of Xiaohuang.",

At that time, the realm was at peace, and he reverently consulted this sacred text, casting the hexagram *Daguo* (Great Exceeding), which read:\n\n*\"The canonical records and legal texts,*\n*Stored in the Orchid Terrace.*\n*Though chaos and ruin spread,*\n*They alone escape disaster.\"*\n\nHe then drew the line statement for *Dun* (Retreat):\n\n*\"The seat still warm,*\n*Trouble knocks at the door.*\n*Over the wall to flee north—*\n*Soldiers come behind,*\n*Yet one escapes the tiger’s jaws.\"*\n\nTen days after his divination, the commandery fell into turmoil. Chancellor Cui scaled the wall and fled, his family unharmed and untouched by misfortune. Upon returning to the capital, he recognized that this book was the work of a sage.

      "translated_text": "At the front of the text, Fei Zhi inscribed a preface, stating: \"The sixty-four hexagrams transform [into one another].\" Later, Wang Yu of the Tang dynasty added a preface. Each hexagram transforms into sixty-four variations, totaling four thousand ninety-six verses, all composed in rhyming lines. These closely resemble the phrases recorded in the *Zuo Tradition*—such as *\"Phoenixes in flight, harmonious their cries, resonant and clear\"*—or those in the *Book of Han*—such as *\"Great Cross, geng-geng, I am the Heavenly King.\"* Could it be that diviners of antiquity possessed such texts?\n\nIn the cyclical year *Zhaoyang Dahuangluo*, during the month of *Huangji*, on the day of the Supreme Ultimate, the divination ritual proceeds as follows:\n\n**Divination Apparatus**\nSelect a clean, secluded space to establish the *shishi* (divination chamber), its door facing south. Place the *lin* (divination table) at the chamber’s center. The table should be roughly five *chi* in length and three *chi* in width, positioned not too close to the walls. Prepare fifty stalks of *shi* (yarrow), wrapped in fragrant silk and encased in a black pouch, then stored in a *du* (receptacle) placed to the north of the table. The *du* may be made of bamboo, sturdy wood, or lacquered cloth, with a circular diameter of three *cun*, matching the length of the *shi*. It should be half base, half lid, with a separate stand to prevent tipping. Set a wooden frame south of the *du*, positioned at the northern two-thirds of the table. The frame, constructed from horizontal wooden planks, should be one *chi* in height, spanning the table’s length, with two large notches carved at the center, spaced one *chi* apart. To the west of the large notches, three small notches are made, each spaced roughly five *cun* apart, with horizontal feet affixed to stand upright on the table. Place one incense burner south of the frame and one incense box south of the burner. Burn incense daily to show reverence.\n\nBefore divination, sweep and wipe the area clean. Prepare one inkstone with water, one brush, one inkstick, and one yellow-lacquered board, placing them to the east of the burner, aligned from east to west.\n\nThe diviner, having purified himself and donned clean robes and cap, faces north, washes his hands, and burns incense to pay respects. The diviner’s northward orientation follows the *Etiquette and Ceremonial*. If someone else commissions the divination, the host burns incense, then steps back slightly to stand facing north. The diviner advances, stands slightly west of the table’s front, and faces south to receive the inquiry. The host states the matter to be divined directly, and the diviner assents. The host turns right and stands facing west, while the diviner turns right to face north.\n\nWith both hands, the diviner lifts the lid of the *du*, places it south of the frame and north of the burner, removes the *shi* from the *du*, discards the pouch and silk wrapping, and sets them east of the *du*. Combining the fifty stalks, he holds them in both hands and passes them over the incense burner. The subsequent use of the *shi* stalks follows the explanations in the *Primer of Enlightenment*.\n\nHe then recites the invocation:\n*\"By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy;*\n*By your greatness, O stalks, divination has its constancy.*\n*[Name and title of the inquirer] now seeks clarity on [matter in question].*\n*Is it auspicious or inauspicious? Will there be gain or loss, regret or remorse, worry or peril?*\n*You, who are spiritually attuned, I beseech to reveal the truth.\"*\n\nWith his right hand, he takes one stalk and sets it aside in the *du*. Then, dividing the remaining forty-nine stalks with both hands, he places them in the left and right large notches of the frame. This is the first operation, *\"dividing into two to symbolize the Two [Forces].\"*\n\nNext, with his left hand, he takes the stalks from the left large notch and holds them, while with his right hand, he removes one stalk from the right large notch and *\"hangs\"* it between the little finger of his left hand. This is the second operation, *\"hanging one to symbolize the Three [Powers].\"*\n\nThen, with his right hand, he counts off the stalks in his left hand in groups of four. This is half of the third operation, *\"counting by fours to symbolize the four seasons.\"*\n\nHe then gathers the remaining stalks—whether one, two, three, or four—and *\"binds\"* them between the ring finger of his left hand. This is half of the fourth operation, *\"returning the remainder to the bind to symbolize the intercalary [month].\"*\n\nNext, he returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the left large notch, then takes the stalks from the right large notch and holds them, counting them off in groups of four with his left hand. This is the other half of the third operation. He then gathers the remaining stalks as before and binds them between the middle finger of his left hand. This is the other half of the fourth operation, *\"binding again to symbolize the second intercalary [month].\"*\n\nAfter the first change, the remaining stalks will follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, three must remain on the right; if two on the left, two on the right; if three on the left, one on the right; if four on the left, four on the right. Including the *\"hung\"* stalk, the total will be either five or nine. Five, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; nine, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, there are three odds to one even.\n\nHe then returns the counted stalks from his right hand to the right large notch and places the one *\"hung\"* and two *\"bound\"* stalks onto the first small notch of the frame, with the east side as the upper position (subsequent placements follow this order). This completes the first change.\n\nNext, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty-four or forty stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the first change, placing the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks onto the second small notch of the frame. This completes the second change.\n\nAfter the second change, the remaining stalks follow this pattern: if one remains on the left, two must remain on the right; if two on the left, one on the right; if three on the left, four on the right; if four on the left, three on the right. Including the *\"hung\"* stalk, the total will be either four or eight. Four, when its four are counted as one, becomes odd; eight, when its four are counted as two, becomes even. Thus, odds and evens each account for two of the four possibilities.\n\nOnce more, he combines the stalks from the left and right large notches—either forty, thirty-six, or thirty-two stalks—and repeats the four operations as in the second change, placing the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks onto the third small notch of the frame. This completes the third change. The remaining stalks after the third change follow the same pattern as the second.\n\nAfter the three changes, he examines the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks obtained from each change and draws the line on the board. If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total five or four, they are odd; if nine or eight, they are even. If the three *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* counts are all odd (thirteen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) total thirty-six, forming an *\"old yang\"* line, drawn as ⚊ (a solid line), known as *\"double.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "dertakes succeeds—*\n*He brings ruin upon himself.\"*\n\nSo precise was its correspondence that even the celestial net’s gentle breeze could not surpass it. Since the dawn of time, only Liang could be said to fulfill this prophecy. How did Yan Shou, in composing his work, foresee that later ages would produce such a figure? Was it because Han-dynasty Jiao Yanshou transmitted the *Changes* to Meng Xi? The account appears in the *\"Biographies of Confucian Scholars.\"* This is the very book he authored.",

      "translated_text": "If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total two odd and one even (seventeen stalks), then the stalks counted through (*guoshe*) number thirty-two, forming a *\"young yin\"* line, drawn as -- (a broken line), known as *\"split.\"* If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total two even and one odd (twenty-one stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-eight, forming a *\"young yang\"* line, drawn as 一 (a single solid line), known as *\"single.\"* If the *\"hung\"* and *\"bound\"* stalks total three even (twenty-five stalks), then the stalks counted through number twenty-four, forming an *\"old yin\"* line, drawn as ⚋ (a double broken line), known as *\"crossed.\"* Thus, every three changes form a line.\n\nThe first, fourth, seventh, tenth, thirteenth, and sixteenth changes—six in total—follow the same pattern. However, from the third change onward, the count is not announced, and only forty-nine stalks are used. The second, fifth, eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, and seventeenth changes—six in total—also follow the same pattern. The third, sixth, ninth, twelfth, fifteenth, and eighteenth changes—six in total—likewise follow the same pattern. In all, eighteen changes form a hexagram. Then, one examines the hexagram’s transformations to divine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the matter. Diagrams and explanations of hexagram transformations are found in *Qimeng*.\n\nWhen the ritual is complete, the diviner conceals the stalks, wraps them, places them in a case, covers it, gathers the brush and inkstone, and the black board. Then, he burns incense, pays respects, and retires. If someone else performs the divination, the host burns incense, bows to the diviner, and retreats.\n\n**Alternative Method Using Objects**\nZhu Yong states: Divining the *Changes* with milfoil stalks is the ancient method. In recent times, coins have been used to cast lines for convenience, but this cannot fully embody the Way of divination. Traditionally, the side of a coin with characters was considered yin, and the blank side yang. Thus, two tails (yin) formed a *\"split\"* (--), a broken line, while two heads (yang) formed a *\"single\"* (一), a solid line. Zhu Xi, however, held that the side with characters was the *face* (yang), and the blank side the *back* (yin). Since all things’ faces belong to yang and backs to yin, he reversed the old method, and scholars of Jian’an universally adopted his view. Some say that in ancient times, metal was cast into cowries or coins called *dao* or *quan*, with the yin side bearing inscriptions like the reverse of a mirror. Whether one side was yin and the other yang remains uncertain.\n\nGenerally, divination must use milfoil stalks; if seeking simplicity, the method must still be exhaustive. I once crafted three wooden spheres, each with six faces. On three faces of each sphere, three lines were carved; on the other three, two lines. When cast, they encompass all variations of old/young yin and yang. The three spheres, each with six faces, embody the principle of eighteen changes. Three faces (three lines each) represent the nine of *Qian* (☰), while three faces (two lines each) represent the six of *Kun* (☷). This reflects the use of spheres and the number eight.\n\nThe three lines of *Qian*’s single line contain three, while the two lines of *Kun*’s single line divide into two—this is the doctrine of *\"three heavens, two earths.\"* When all three spheres land on three, they form nine, the number of *\"old yang.\"* When all land on two, they form six, the number of *\"old yin.\"* Two twos and one three form seven, the number of *\"young yang.\"* Two threes and one two form eight, the number of *\"young yin.\"* The lines of *Qian* and *Kun* are used to form the eight trigrams, symbolizing *Qian* and *Kun* giving birth to the six children.\n\nThe spheres represent the One of the Supreme Ultimate. Three threes form *Qian* (☰), and three twos form *Kun* (☷), symbolizing the Two (yin and yang). The three spheres represent the Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Each sphere’s total is fifteen, the number of the *Luoshu*’s supreme pole. The combined total of the three spheres is forty-five, the number of the *Hetu*’s nine palaces. If two appear above, three lie below; if three appear above, two lie below—movement and stillness both yield five. Thus, five is concealed within the operation, and when combined with forty-five, it becomes the *Dayan*’s number of fifty.\n\nWhen three spheres form nine above, three spheres conceal six below—this is the body of *\"old yang\"* transforming into yin. When three spheres form six above, three spheres conceal nine below—this is the body of *\"old yin\"* transforming into yang. Two and three oppose each other, and each sphere contains three and five—this is the principle of *\"interweaving and varying numbers.\"* The spheres are round and revolving, embodying ceaseless change. The six positions interact, circulating through the six voids. Three spheres cast six times complete a day, also reflecting the principle of eighteen changes.\n\nThis method avoids the ambiguity of coin faces and backs regarding yin and yang, while encompassing all variations of old/young yin and yang. I have shared this with like-minded scholars, who found it reasonable, and thus recorded the method for the world to follow.\n\nWhen a hexagram’s lines are obtained, old lines change while young lines do not. If a line changes, a new hexagram is derived. The sequence of hexagrams in the *Yilin*’s *Upper and Lower Canon* concludes here.",

      "translated_text": "Hexagram Twenty-Five: *Wu Wang* (\"Without Falsehood\")\n\n**Wu Wang** – In Xia Terrace and Beautiful Li, Tang and Wen endured hardship. Gao Yao heard and judged, and the people of Qi rejoiced. Gazing west toward Hua Peak, returning in haste brings no blame.\n\n**Qian** – Eaves pierced through the ear, bound and toiling at the pestle. Heaven and Earth alter their order, sun and moon begin anew. Locusts sting my hand, pain becomes my poison.\n\n**Kun** – A mother’s compassionate grace, grown great yet without descendants. Swaddled in infancy, harm does not enter the gate.\n\n**Zhun** – Deceitful words and reckless speech, entangling one another in error. Losing the path to the left, unaware where the wolf lurks.\n\n**Meng** – Obscured and dim, yin accumulates without light. The sun rests in the northern quarter, all things wither and hide.\n\n**Xu** – The hostess abounds in fortune, where Heaven’s blessings lie concealed. Dwelling therein brings flourishing favor, the noble one shines.\n\n**Song** – Reaping without tilling, household provisions fall short. The middle daughter is unvirtuous, the eldest son lame. Gapped teeth excel in trade, the merchant rejoices.\n\n**Shi** – Fire rises at the gate, yet does not harm me. Leaping and fleeing east and west, I alone survive intact. Unfavorable to venture beyond the neighborhood, illness and sorrow bring distress.\n\n**Bi** – Holding a knife to carve meat, facing wine yet not eating. The eldest perishes in military service, the youngest son is imprisoned, hugging his knees to sleep alone. *Fu* to *Bo*.\n\n**Xiao Xu** – Fish and shrimp leave the sea, wandering in parched shallows. Streets and alleys press close, no freedom to move. North and south to the four limits, thirst and hunger breed sickness.\n\n**Lü** – Laughing and chattering, drinking wine with joy. Enduring delight flows in cups, dancing for a thousand autumns, bowing to receive great fortune.\n\n**Tai** – Ascending heights and climbing mountains, welcomed at the four gates. The common ranks gain favor, fortune becomes my root.\n\n**Pi** – Heaven rejects Zhou’s virtue, fate turns to the southern state. With ritual, the people are stilled, weapons and armor rest.\n\n**Tong Ren** – Dams and levees obstruct, water cannot flow. Fire’s radiance blazes, yin spirits hide in retreat, fleeing back to their homeland.\n\n**Da You** – Rivers and seas, cities and markets, the state’s hidden treasury. The merchant receives fortune, the youngest son gains jade. Alternately: food.\n\n**Qian** – Bound eastward to evade war, southward to avoid misfortune. Pursuing evil west, northward welcoming fortune’s birth, meeting joy along the way.\n\n**Yu** – The eastern household’s maiden, uglier than her mother-in-law. Thirty years unwed, matchmakers toil in vain.\n\n**Sui** – A ruined and fallen state, Heaven does not bless it, hard to bring peace.\n\n**Gu** – Harnessing a lame donkey, dusk falls and the hour is lost. The dweller knows no sorrow, preserving my joy and delight.\n\n**Lin** – Beside the smelting furnace, flattery and favor sway the heart. Women’s petitions run rampant—does the king’s Way not prevail?\n\n**Guan** – Three rams and five sheep, following one another in file. Lost in the empty marsh, tracing the valley due north. Crossing six fords, they are harmed by bandits.\n\n**Shi He** – Embracing joy and cradling a child, befriending profit. What Heaven commands brings no fear of peril. Xun Bo toils in hardship, the Queen Mother of the West arrives.\n\n**Bi** – Weaving threads unfinished, the needle breaks and cannot mend. The maid’s many arts disrupt my governance.\n\n**Bo** – The dispute over dew on the path, the chaste maiden does not go forth. The noble one lacks food, the Way is blocked and obstructed.\n\n**Fu** – Yi draws his bow and cries out, shooting the Heavenly Wolf. Bells and drums fall silent, the general stands resolute. The valor of Zhao’s warriors, dying in battle at Rongyang.\n\n**Da Xu** – Craning the neck to gaze at wine, it does not enter my mouth. The merchant toils in vain, no profit is gained. In Xia Terrace and Beautiful Li, though perilous, joy returns.\n\n**Yi** – Donning cap and sash, journeying south, meeting joy as promised. Invited to a fine state, receiving office in timely accord. *Kan* to *Jing*.\n\n**Da Guo** – East and west, crashing into walls, unfavorable to venture out. Fish hide in deep waters, no means to delight guests. Ranks and titles crumble, glory and might fade in sorrow.\n\n**Kan** – Two mothers with ten children, ceaselessly shifting and sighing. Five teats for a hundred fledglings, piebald colts with dappled words.\n\n**Li** – Chong and Li, ancestral lords, ministers and grand historians. The Yang family’s disaster, the palace’s sorrow and grief.\n\n**Xian** – Inwardly holding gentle virtue, halting disputes with silence. The ancestral temple and town rely on fortune, calamity does not arise.\n\n**Heng** – Gathering in Tangmei’s village, meeting in Sangzhong as promised. Breaking faith, the rendezvous missed, sorrow girds the waist. Alternately: ox and steed share the hall, the Guo family perishes. The state lies in ruins, the lord flees in flight. *Xun* to *Qian*, *Shi* to *Shi He*.\n\n**Dun** – The palace is established, governance set in order, garments worn with torn sleeves. Reverence and humility serve as defense, ultimately free from misfortune.\n\n**Da Zhuang** – Qilin and phoenix, descendants flourish and prosper. The young and pure stand at the gate, favorable for marriage. The noble one rejoices greatly.\n\n**Jin** – A state in chaos and peril, its borders cannot be crossed. The trap springs, the body collapses, fleeing to fall prostrate.\n\n**Ming Yi** – A thousand sparrows and ten thousand turtledoves, making enemies of gulls. Though numerous, their strength is no match, bringing no benefit. Struck by the hawk, all is lost.\n\n**Jia Ren** – The spirits gather in assembly, conferring in counsel. The southern state oppresses and disorders, the people grieve in sorrow. Raising an army to campaign, a worthy lord is enthroned. *Bo* to *Wei Ji*, *Zhun* to *Jie*, *Xiao Xu* to *Yu*.\n\n**Kui** – Yan Yuan and Min Sun, self-restrained through ritual. Where the noble one dwells, misfortune does not abide.\n\n**Jian** – The three Huan clans’ descendants, generationally holding state power. Ranked as chief ministers, wealthier than the Duke of Zhou.\n\n**Xie** – The crane calls in the nine marshes, the maiden misses her time.

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nTwo sentences appear to be superfluous.\n\n**Yi** – Fish stir the waters to muddy them; Jie disorders our state. Riding dragons forth to wander, bound for the joyous city. Heaven bestows its bounty upon me, a blessing for life.\n\n**Guai** – White tiger and black wolf lurk on the southern mountain. They intercept oxen and sheep, afflicting my merchants.\n\n**Gou** – Treading peril without peace, my face grows gaunt and sallow. Wounds swell into scars.\n\n**Cui** – Three men ride together in a cart, bound for a neighbor’s house. The mistress, greedy and gluttonous, steals my wealth and cattle, losing my plow ox.\n\n**Sheng** – Three cranes fly south, alighting together in the pond. Shrimp and fish abound, yielding double profit.\n\n**Kun** – An eagle perches in a lush tree, watching sparrows come and go. One strike secures two—profit lies in the branches.\n\n**Jing** – Yao and Shun, reverent and wise; Yu and Ji, their stalwart ministers. Yi Yin comes and goes, ascending the hall in sandals. Those of illustrious virtue may assist the king.\n\n**Ge** – Three years of drought and barrenness; no grass or herbs grow. Music and grain stores are depleted, nothing to offer the spirits.\n\n**Ding** – Square mouth and round tongue, serving as the hinge of knowledge. Unfastening sashes and belts, merchants rejoice.\n\n**Zhen** – Seeing the pool overflow, high land becomes a sea. Rivers and streams surge across the land; fish and turtles gather in markets. A thousand *li* without walls, mandarin ducks and phoenixes roam freely.\n\n**Gen** – Cooking fish but losing the knife; driving a carriage but the horse flees. The sacrificial blade does not enter; weaving nets reeks of fishy stench.\n\n**Jian** – The Rong and Di squat in rudeness, greedy and gluttonous. Not of our kind, the noble one turns away.\n\n**Guimei** – Crossing the river, the fox wets its tail. No misfortune or worry—catching fish but meeting crabs, little profit gained.\n\n**Feng** – The river yields small fish, not worth toil. Harsh governance harms the people; the ruler suffers its ills.\n\n**Lü** – Laying down arms and cultivating culture, weapons and armor rest in peace. The pure of heart wander freely, returning to leisure.\n\n**Xun** – The Nine Doubts and Yu’s forests, damp and unfit for dwelling.

Fleeing to a fearful land, laughing with fortune, the noble one rejoices.\n\n**Huan** – A dog gives birth to a dragon-horse; the lord toils, the old woman suffers. The household lacks baskets; regret turns to remorse.\n\n**Jie** – An infant seeks milk; the loving mother returns to her child. The yellow muntjac rejoices, finding its sweet bait.\n\n**Zhongfu** – Two red sparrow hawks, with five others, gather noisily. Grasping arrows of unequal length, hasten to release your shot. Bowing in submission, they dare not stir.\n\n**Xiaoguo** – Yi Yin, a scholar of resolve, left Jie to till the wilds. Holding fast to compliance and strength, Heaven aids him without fault.\n\n**Jiji** – Chasing deer to the west, profit enters my gate. Yin and Yang harmonize; the state suffers no calamity. The eldest son travels bound, awaiting his three foes.\n\nEleven sentences appear to be superfluous.\n\n**Weiji** – The virtue of the Dragon’s rise; King Wu of Zhou secured fortune. The eldest daughter brings harmony to the household, in virtue with her lord. Long-legged, she travels far; the fox and badger hide well.\n\n---\n\n**26. Daxu**\n\n**Daxu** – The land of Chaoxian, where the Lord of Ji found refuge. Fitting for people and household, its legacy endures for descendants. Seeking affairs brings great joy.\n\n**Qian** – Bronze pillars and iron gates, firmly guarding against disaster. The noble one dwells here, secure without doubt.\n\n**Kun** – Turning misfortune into fortune, joy enters the house. Spring in the city, summer in the state—one may feast, preserving the household.\n\n**Zhun** – Waters surge violently, floating houses and collapsing walls. Swelling and overflowing, the market’s masters panic. Dwelling in safety, mother and child remain unharmed.\n\n**Meng** – Tigers and leopards, bears in abundance, play at the mountain’s edge. Obtaining their desire, the noble one knows no worry. Travelers lose profit; the market stands empty.\n\n**Xu** – Practicing ritual and treading in benevolence, exalting virtue to end disputes. The ancestral city is secure; the Three Lords suffer no harm.\n\n**Song** – The Jiang and Huai change garments, black and yellow, vermilion and white. Duke Ling’s summer campaign brings calamity without end. High positions collapse; favor and chambers are lost.\n\n**Shi** – Unforeseen disaster strikes without warning. Sudden and swift, it ends in grief—pain wounds my heart. *Meng* to *Mingyi*.\n\n**Bi** – The Three Paths and Five Peaks, leaving danger to enter the chamber. Misfortune does not arise; Jie and Robber steal Yao’s robes. Losing their favored fortune, the noble suffers illness.\n\n**Xiaoxu** – Union and welcome extend to the four directions. Setting the wedding date by dusk, the bright star shines brilliantly. Joy and radiance—words of praise earn reward.\n\n**Lü** – Three hands and six bodies, none find their place. Shifting and swaying, movement loses its advantage. Jizi feigns madness; the state does not prosper.\n\n**Tai** – A tiger beyond the mountain’s edge; a deer passes behind its chest. Bow and arrow set, it is called the merit officer. Crouching, it dares not rise, fleeing to preserve its life, finding my fine grass. *Dayou* to *Song*.\n\n**Pi** – The qilin and phoenix are captured; heroes lose their posts. From Wei back to Lu, fearing obscurity, they do not rise—fortune and emolument end.\n\n**Tongren** – The joyful son brings calamity; the elder is slain. Zhou Li flees to Chu, losing his favored light.\n\n**Dayou** – The Yellow Emperor sets forth, riding dragons and horses. Bound for Mount Tai, passing south through Qi and Lu. Wang Liang drives to the right; what fault do Wen and Wu bear? Unfavorable for merchants.\n\n**Qian** – Qi and Lu dispute in words, battling at Dragon Gate. Resentment breeds misfortune; three generations know no peace.\n\n**Yu** – The Way and ritual harmonize virtue; benevolence does not harm.",

Ranked as chief ministers, wealthier than the Duke of Zhou.\n\n**Xie** – The crane calls in the nine marshes, the maiden misses her time. Hauling earth and selling basins, labor brings little success.\n\n**Sun** – Square axle and round wheel, the cart cannot advance. Piercing the sack with an awl, the task is lost. Returning the army and mustering the troops, weapons and armor rest.",

      "translated_text": "**Heng** – Ox and steed share the same hall; the Guo clan perishes thereby. The state is broken to ruins; the lord flees in haste.\n\n**Zhu** – A large tail and slender waist, too heavy to sway. The ridgepole sags and the beams crack; the minister grieves for his lord. Words of scalding fire melt away, no longer a threat—let me be at peace again.\n\n**Da Zhuang** – The Great One sets out wine; the Music Master rises to dance. Ten thousand blessings converge—one may dwell in safety, preserving my teeth and gums.\n\nBelow: There is emptiness, no bait—unfavorable for travel.\n\n**Jin** – Drinking wine, drunk and reckless, leaping up to brawl. The elder is wounded, the younger falls stiff—bind the household and prepare the funeral.\n\n**Ming Yi** – Ling’s steep cliffs are perilous to climb; the ravine is full of stones. The carriage races, the axle strikes—heavily laden, the axle breaks. Shouldering the burden, one stumbles, twisting the right foot.\n\n**Jia Ren** – Disputes never cease, each seeking the other’s counsel. Zhang and Li, weak of speech, loose their hair and flee north.\n\nBelow: The ear follows the heart; one practices perfect virtue. No need for arms—the world is at great peace.\n\n**Kui** – The heart lacks goodness, recklessly breaking through. Hitting walls and smashing jade, one cannot find the door or chamber. The former kings shut the passes; merchants and travelers are abandoned.\n\n**Jian** – Quails and crows feed their young, cultivating to ward off disaster. Pacifying virtue and securing the household, the Duke of Zhou toils diligently.\n\n**Xie** – The pure man, Gaozi, lingers long in the wilds. Wandering without return, he thinks of his kind mother.\n\n**Sun** – Two tigers fight; their thighs are wounded, no place unscathed. Yet they do not become enemies—walking apart, they leave.\n\n**Yi** – Heaven’s daughter pushes the bed, but no pattern is made. Southern Dipper lacks a tongue; the rice is full of husks and grit. Oppressing the masses and stealing fame, the rooster breaks its neck.\n\n**Guai** – The Crown Prince Fusu is sent to the distant outskirts. Flatterers and villains prevail; altered commands bring sorrow. The kindness of a loving mother—no path to reach her.\n\n**Gou** – Cold and heat alternate; one shines, one fades. The illustrious House of Zhou—its glory wanes and declines.\n\n**Cui** – Chickens and dogs gaze at one another; the Way of benevolence is firmly practiced. Dogs bark at dawn and dusk, each at peace in its place. The Zhou tripods blend their offerings; the state is rich, the people prosperous—all eight directions receive blessing.\n\n**Sheng** – Windows and doors, rooms and chambers—all open, bright, and clear. The wise and sagacious assist the sage; benevolence is widely enacted. Households are provided for, the people content—the realm flourishes.\n\n**Kun** – Rain and snow for three months; birds and beasts hunger and suffer. Travelers lose their way; no profit is to be had. Clever words resolve peril, curing grave illness—danger to the body is restored to peace.\n\n**Jing** – A white crane holds a pearl in its beak, feeding at night to shine. Rich and abundant nourishment—years of plenty for the state. The middle son returns; seeing evil, he meets no misfortune.\n\n**Cong** – A pig leads a sheep, encountering a tiger. Though startled, no misfortune befalls.\n\n**Ding Liang** – Wild geese honk, making their home upon the water. Male and female harmonize; their hearts delight, obtaining what they desire.\n\n**Da You** and **Gui Mei**.\n\n**Zhen** – Chasing a fox on the plain, water blocks my path. Too deep to ford, by dusk nothing is gained.\n\n**Gen** – A cave for a chamber, a thatched door for a gate—where the poor and lowly dwell. Gazing a thousand *li* for kin, they scatter to the four directions. The body perishes, sinking into the abyss—never again to see the lord.\n\n**Jian** – The lords Jie and Zhou, perverse and unfit for aid. Greedy for glory, they bring ruin upon themselves. Hoarding and amassing, the wilds become cities—yet they do not come to my house.\n\n**Gui Mei** – Granaries and storehouses are full; the year yields abundance. Merchants linger, though long delayed, they gain.\n\nYin is strong, yang is weak—adapt to the land and apply one’s strength.\n\n**Feng** – Mount Tai does not burn; the carp loses the fishing line. The fish cannot be caught; profit departs to my north.\n\nAlternatively: Three travel together, reviving the House of Zhou. The noble one rests in peace.\n\n**Lü** – A maiden without a matchmaker—unfavorable to move. Secure in her chamber and hut, why should Mother Fu worry?\n\n**Xun** – Riding the wind and clouds, roaming to the eastern sea. Beating wings for a thousand *li*, I see my beloved child.\n\n**Dui** – A swan steals my skirt, fleeing to the mountain’s corner. Not seen nearby, it makes Uncle anxious.\n\n**Huan** – Night vision fails; unfavorable to journey afar. Shut the door, seal the windows—fortune becomes my mother.\n\n**Jie** – Three dogs chase a hare on the eastern road. Favorable to advance; the merchant gains.\n\n**Zhong Fu** – The King Wu was unwell; the Duke of Zhou prayed and offered jade, holding the scepter. Peace was restored as before.\n\n**Xiao Guo** – Sharing a carriage, they part midway. Rank and position do not advance; the noble one steps down.\n\n**Ji Ji** – Six wild geese fly together, playing in the rice pond. Feasting abundantly, eating their fill—no harm.\n\nBelow: Undertaking affairs without retreat; merchants and travelers stir resentment.\n\n**Wei Ji** – Tallies match left and right, joining in harmony. Qian’s strength with Kun’s advantage—Ji bears six sons. Grown and accomplished, their words are like a mother’s—no blame attaches.\n\n**Yi (Hexagram 27)**\n\n**Yi** – Households are provided for, the people content; songs of praise arise together. The four barbarians submit; shields and spears are stored away.\n\n**Qian** – Longing for the beginning, tracing the ancient Way, lamenting without aid. The light of yang is uncontrolled; the superior loses his place.\n\n**Kun** – The Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, the sea—heaven’s deep treasuries. Where all benefits gather, one may abound in wealth—joy to our lord.\n\n**Zhun** – Three wild geese fly together, avoiding heat and seeking cold. By chance meeting an archer, they are struck by the arrow.\n\n**Meng** – Autumn in the south, spring in the north—resting in season. Dwelling in harmony, treading the center—peace without misfortune or calamity.",

      "translated_text": "**Xu (Hexagram 5)**\n\n**Xu** – Treading danger without harm, escaping alone to safety. Unfavorable to go out—my left knee is injured. Sickness prevents eating; ghosts wail in the house.\n\n**Song** – A shrewish wife in the household, resenting her in-laws. Breaking plates and smashing bowls, she discards their food, leaving me impoverished and distressed.\n\n**Shi** – Mired in filth and disgrace, cast aside into ditches. Laughed and wept at by the crowd, never to be recognized or recorded.\n\n**Bi** – Going at dawn and returning at dusk, each sustaining the other—no harm or misfortune befalls.\n\n**Xiao Xu** – Six wings with long pinions, flying by night past the archer’s land. Soaring high into the dark, even Yi cannot reach them.\n\n**Lü** – A land of wasps and scorpions, hard to rest in. The fine and charming scholar is devoured by the king, forced to flee his home.\n\n**Tai** – Riding a fox, mounting a dragon, bound for the king’s eastern road. Failing to return in time, it makes me deaf with worry.\n\n**Pi** – Hail and plum blossoms fall, the heart filled with indignation. Bearing sorrow and little shame, it disorders my spirit and qi.\n\n**Tong Ren** – The eldest daughter married thrice, advancing and retreating with many guises. A vixen’s sorcery—wandering at night brings only grief.\n\n**Da You** – Thunderous clamor, driving and chasing westward. Fullness and excess must break; high positions collapse and topple.\n\n**Qian** – Boarding a boat to cross the river, carrying water yet meeting fire. Relying on me brings no harm—my protection grants full life.\n\n**Yu** – A lord of utmost virtue, governing with benevolence and warmth. Yi and Lü as his ministers—his state is prosperous, his people at peace.\n\n**Sui** – Born out of time, beset by hardship and many sorrows. No winter or summer passes—my heart is ever sorrowful.\n\n**Gu** – Journeying south to Jade Mountain, entering eastward through the Gate of Life. Ascending to the hall of fortune, drinking the nectar of ten thousand years.\n\n**Lin** – A great axe hewing wood, slanderers ruin the state. Closing the two and five, calamity befalls the three sons. The people of Jin fall into chaos; Duke Huai flees.\n\n**Guan** – A single house with a hundred grandsons—lord rejoices, matriarch delights. Laughing and speaking together, the household is joyful and secure.\n\n**Shi He** – Following the sun’s course, never straying from constancy. The lord rests in his domain—his state knows no misfortune or disaster.\n\n**Bi** – A pack of tigers enters the city, seeking meat to eat. The great man defends and guards—his lord does not lose his state.\n\n**Bo** – Weak feet, severed heels—unfavorable to go out. Merchants gain no profit; collapse and ruin bring harm. The worry of scalding fire turns to joy upon resolution.\n\n**Fu** – The summer terrace’s dark chamber, where King Wen was imprisoned. Ghost Marquis provided food; the people of Qi rejoiced.\n\n**Wu Wang** – The catalpa rafters rot, the corridors and halls collapse. Palaces and towers stand empty, like trees withered in winter.\n\n**Da Xu** – Slander brings inner peace, yet harms the state. The household is seized with terror, imprisoned and tightly confined. Sickness brings many demands; crime and chaos breed resentment.\n\n**Da Guo** – Six dragons rage together, battling at the marsh’s edge. Confusion reigns—no victor emerges; the traveler suffers hardship.\n\n**Kan** – Thunder rolls across the land, dust rises and obscures the sky. The market is empty of sheep; the sick man fears misfortune. Three innocent trees escape and return home.\n\n**Li** – A single finger eats meat, yet the mouth gains nothing. Staining its tripod, the tongue slanders in return.\n\n**Xian** – Laughter and joy are fleeting, losing their blessings. Glib words spread scabies—travelers fear and shun them.\n\n**Heng** – Hair grows on the back, the state rejoices, the people prosper—its lord possesses virtue.\n\n**Dun** – A castrated pig and a calf—no harm or injury comes. The three luminaries gather in one hall, bringing me fortune and kindness.\n\n**Da Zhuang** – The Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, the Ji—overflowing, they bring disaster. The city is afflicted; the year is barren, no harvest comes.\n\n**Jin** – Two tigers fight, their thighs wounded and torn. No true enmity forms—they part and go their ways.\n\n**Ming Yi** – The Five Peaks and Four Marshes, moistening and nurturing with virtue. Conduct never strays from principle—people rely on its grace and fortune.\n\n**Jia Ren** – Loading a cart, mounting a horse, journeying south to meet a lord. He grants me great fortune—departing sorrow, no blame remains.\n\n**Kui** – A torn sack, a broken basket—empty of millet and grain. Failing to flatter the lord at first, they flee to the dung heap.\n\n**Jian** – Killing the journey to Peach Orchard, seeing a tiger, they turn back east. The mantis’s foe brings me no harm.\n\n**Xie** – A basket of grain enters the house—governance decays to ruin. Clutching their ritual vessels, they flee to another state, turning misfortune into fortune.\n\n**Sun** – The courtyard torch burns bright at night, tracing the past and mourning the present. Yang is weak and cannot restrain—yin’s strength sits in rebellion.\n\n**Yi** – Hanging a mirror, setting a standard—food beyond one’s station. Losing the carriage, the hut is stripped. Resting, they move to a new home.\n\n**Guai** – A fine gate, fortune and joy—silks and fabrics woven in abundance. Daily progress brings gain; wealth rivals the state.\n\n**Gou** – Grasping the reins, mounting the chariot, trailing banners on an eastern journey. Delighting in Qi, dissolving Yan—his state is secure and at peace.\n\n**Cui** – Waters deep, no oar to cross—how to journey through difficulty? The Lord of Shang loses advantage; the common people grieve and worry.\n\n**Sheng** – Three crows and mandarin ducks, following one another in flight. South to the lush marsh, they feast on fish and grain. The noble man finds lasting joy—seeing evil, he is unharmed.\n\n**Kun** – Gazing afar, eyes darting, standing at the edge brings dizziness. Not leaving Yue’s capital, the traveler is detained and distressed.\n\n**Jing** – Endless wind from east to west, scattering in all four directions. From dawn till dusk, no sign of fear or dread.\n\n**Ge** – Words without binding agreement—no contract is made. Yin Shu and Ji Ji, the Duke’s grandson contend. Forcibly entering, they present gifts, yet I am not pleased by the union.\n\n**Ding** – Oxen and horses deaf and mute, unaware of sound or taste.\n\n*(Note: Minor textual variants in the original were resolved for clarity while preserving meaning.)*",
      "overlap_context": "light of yang is uncontrolled; the superior loses his place.\n\n**Kun** – The Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, the sea—heaven’s deep treasuries.

By chance meeting an archer, they are struck by the arrow.\n\n**Meng** – Autumn in the south, spring in the north—resting in season.

      "translated_text": "**Fu Xin** | The heart’s aid wells forth like a spring. Rolling and rolling, like a mountain.\n\n**Qian** | Anxiety and alarm run deep, yet misfortune brings no disaster. Since then, all has been secure.\n\n**Kun** | Piercing the gourd, embracing ice, the reed-pipe’s mother kindles fire. Exhausted and spent, hunger and thirst become calamity.\n\n**Zhun** | The lame ox breaks its horn, unable to bear the load. Disasters cannot be avoided; the year yields no grain. The city of Meng will become a wasteland—dwelling there brings peril.\n\n**Xu** | The tree’s roots are severed, its blossoms and leaves fallen. Suddenly, a crowd of flames arises; with the wind, all collapse.\n\n**Song** | The supreme ruler’s greed exhausts the people’s strength. Those in power act perversely, and the Yi overthrow them.\n\n**Shi** | On the northern mountain grows millet; let Shu live long and prosper. The eastern ridge abounds with grain—go forth and trade in the market. The soaring pheasant brings profit and joy wherever it alights.\n\n**Bi** | High plateaus and towering peaks, where earth yields little water. Forests and groves of grass and trees—fine crops meet with disaster.\n\n**Xiao Xu** | The celestial bodies enter Lou, and the king sets forth on his tour. Broadly bestowing virtue and favor, the land is at peace, free from care.\n\n**Lü** | The carriage’s axle and canopy fray as the year draws late. Favor and renown are cast aside; the lord declines in his position.\n\n**Tai** | The bit is loosed, the reins abandoned; chaos runs unchecked. Laws and norms shift without constancy—the lord loses his place.\n\n**Pi** | Alone, I ascend the western wall; none share my laughter or words. The autumn wind carries much sorrow, grieving my heart.\n\n**Tong Ren** | The sinews contract, the thighs cramp—I cannot leave the house. At dusk, the wandering horde arrives; surely, it will bring harm.\n\n**Da You** | Truth and deceit are hard to discern, making me partial and biased. With petty men in office, what fault can even the wise avoid?\n\n**Qian** | Millet and wine, pure and rich, are reverently offered to the mountain’s spirit. The gods relish the feast; sweet rains and auspicious omens follow. All things flourish in abundance; the time knows no disaster or fault. Alone, I receive blessings.\n\n**Yu** | The prince and his noble sons take up the sling and grasp the pellets. Every shot brings gain; the household overflows with plenty.\n\n**Sui** | Yin ascends, Yang recedes; Shun loses his home. The common people, red and starving, go hungry together.\n\n**Gu** | Seven orifices in a dragon’s body, crafting the *Yi*’s eight trigrams. Following Heaven and modeling Earth, bestowing grace in accord with the seasons. Drawing harmony and honoring elders, they enrich and endure forever.\n\n**Lin** | Chasing the fox on the eastern mountain, water blocks my path. Too deep to ford, I lose advantage and miss the later opportunity.\n*(See *Sun* → *Jian*, *Meng* → *Gu*.)*\n\n**Guan** | Bearing a mandate, I am shamed by the mission. Unable to endure the task, I fall midway and am made to bear the burden anew.\n\n**Shi He** | The warm and benevolent lord, steadfast in loyalty and filial piety. Entering the inner palace as a model, no misfortune or disaster arises.\n\n**Bi** | Spring brings abundant moisture; summer’s blessings are rich and deep. The harvest ripens, and each acre yields a hundred *hu*. The army marches without discipline—hegemonic ambitions go unfulfilled.\n\n**Bo** | Two women share a chamber, their hearts too troubled to eat. Their hair stands wild as thistledown; sorrow lingers within.\n\n**Fu** | Building a tower on a rocky peak, establishing the wellspring’s source. Illness persists, unrelieved; old and solitary, I dwell beside it.\n\n**Wu Wang** | Seeking to avoid the gate of misfortune, I instead draw near to disaster. Overturned and uncontrolled, pain sears my heart.\n\n**Da Xu** | Creeping and peering, I hide in fear. The fox’s head stays low, lurking—night is its advantage.\n\n**Yi** | A face with nine mouths, a long tongue like an axe. It severs and shatters the coral, cutting off Yin Shang’s posterity.\n\n**Da Guo** | Harmonious qi intermingles; moisture and essence nurture my fine grain.\n\n**Kan** | Smelting metal to cast weapons, the thunder chariot does not roll. The people rest secure in their villages.\n\n**Li** | The words of Qin’s counselors resolve the state’s troubles. One persuades Yan to submit; Qi’s minister gains power.\n\n**Xian** | At dawn, the wise assist the king—Zhou’s virtue shines brightly. Yue Shang presents pheasants; the myriad states know peace.\n*(Zhou Gong Dan, Shao Gong Shi.)*\n\n**Heng** | Weak feet, severed heels—no profit in going out. Trade brings no gain; loss and ruin follow.\n\n**Dun** | Hard ice, yellow birds, ever wailing in sorrow. No sweet grain is seen—only flowering mugwort. Startled again and again by crows, my heart is filled with care.\n*(See *Qian* → *Shi He*, *Yi* → *Da Guo*.)*\n\n**Da Zhuang** | The soul fades, faint and trembling; the thread of weaving is cut. Suddenly, all becomes clear—I live again.\n\n**Jin** | Yin gives birth to the deer in Kang Valley; mice dance in Ghost Gorge. The sacred tortoise dwells on land; the cauldron’s rice is mixed with dirt. The people foresee the state’s ruin—Jie’s chaos knows no order.\n\n**Ming Yi** | Gathering stones to carve jade, none remain uncut. I raise the dragon’s form; Lu Ban is my aid. The qilin and phoenix take shape—their virtue mirrors the noble one.\n\n**Jia Ren** | Mountains shift to become the sky; dry land turns to sea’s mouth. The people cannot rest in peace.\n\n**Kui** | The east wind opens the door; hidden, I fear yet rejoice. The sprouts receive favor—I regain my child.\n\n**Jian** | A hundred branches of flowering lamps, planted in darkness, wane and dim. Their radiance nearly spent, they fade like ash or dust.\n\n**Xie** | Thirty and still unwed, I lodge in the mulberry grove. The eldest daughter of the upper palace—no shared joy is ours.\n\n**Sun** | The egg battles the stone; surely, it shatters. Toiling brings regret—no timely exit is found.\n\n**Yi** | Qin’s armies contend in strength, losing their integrity and goodness. They defeat my homeland of Ban.\n\n**Guai** | The cruel remove the good and suspect the loyal—difficult to cure. The thoroughbred, trapped in a washbasin cart, is tormented by bit and whip.\n\n**Jian** | Grasping a bamboo shoot to strike the fox, shouldering a bow to shoot the fish.",

Seeing the Grand Steward’s plea, the chariot is turned back.\n\n**Sheng** | Sun Bin deceives Pang Juan, carving words on wood to feign favor. The ambush is sprung at last—arrows fall like rain. The Wei army panics in chaos; its general is taken captive.\n\n**Kun** | Journeying south beyond the city, the world gains great fortune. The royal princess returns to Qi, her desires fulfilled, bringing peace to the state.\n\n**Jing** | Winter gathers fern and orchid, the earth frozen hard. Though one flees in haste, by dusk nothing is gained.\n\n**Ge** | Wang Qiao is free of illness, yet the dog’s head aches not. Sandals lost, shoes misplaced—I lack those to send me off.\n\n**Ding** | The swift-footed horse races blindly, guided by a sightless master. Eyes see no path; by midnight, they fail to arrive.\n\n**Zhen** | Seeking profit in a troubled land, I flee northward. Anxious, I return to my city—only to become its foe.\n\n**Jian** | The four-winged paired fish bring peace to my state. Above and below, no peril—this is my blessed fortune.\n\n**Guimei** | The eight talents ascend, accomplishing great deeds.

Virtue unnurtured, it is overthrown by those below.\n\n**Xun** | The five grains fail to ripen; the people suffer hardship and distress. Driving southward, joy and gain are found.\n\n**Dui** | Yellow robes establish the era; virtue and power reside within. Blessings overflow, enfeoffed as lord of Qi. The market knows no gate—wealth and honor abound.\n\n**Gua** | Qi binds the thatch of Guo’s hut, marrying into the Luo capital. Fine and fair, the profit is ten thousandfold.\n\n**Jie** | A bed of comfort, thick quilts—yet one cannot stay long. Forsaking my joyous feast, I am stranded in the southern land.

Though fine grain abounds, none may eat it.\n\n**Xiaoguo** | Stepping out, I meet misfortune—enmity with disaster. Another bears a sharp blade; my fingertip is wounded.\n\n**Jiji** | Moving in and out with timely measure, no cares in south or north.

Though they gaze upon one another, they never share the hall.\n\n**Meng** | Where the flock of crows gathers, a great monstrosity lurks. Nine bodies without heads—the soul startled, the spirit flees. No place to dwell.\n\n**Zhen** | To Meng: Chaos and strife intertwine; the people are desolate. Pursued to the west of Ji, the Di’s maidservants take advantage.\n\n**Song** | Where the qilin and phoenix soar, the land knows no misfortune. The market yields tenfold profit, returning to a land of kindness.\n\n**Shi** | Digging a well for jade, not the treasure of the Bian clan. The body is shamed, the name dishonored—labor yields no gain.\n\n**Bi** | The mountain’s striped tiger and leopard, plump and rich with fat.

      "translated_text": "**Dayou** | The old and weak, childless, cannot care for themselves. Though the people grieve, in the end, they do not escape blame. When Guanzi governed the state, the feudal lords submitted as guests. Eight hundred chariots bore him, exalting our Lord Huan’s virtue.\n\n**Qian** | The plum tree’s branches sway and break, parting from its mother, forever estranged, never to know one another.\n\n**Yu** | Abundance within does not cease, yet in decline and old age, clumsiness returns. Fullness and excess bring loss; sores fester while the gall grows fat. Zheng Zhao lost his state, while Chong’er rose to power.\n*Alternate text:* When prosperity departs, decline follows; when emaciation leaves, fatness returns. Zheng Zhao lost his state, while Chong’er seized the moment.\n\n**Sui** | Hearing the tiger has entered the town, the heart flees in terror. Running to Yangzong, I do not see Huo Shu—freed from all hidden woes.\n\n**Gu** | Following the times, seizing opportunity, never missing the gate of profit. Gaining much, blessed with fortune, richer than a lord of the marches.\n\n**Lin** | Yu cast the sacred tripods, while Boyi pointed the way. The axe’s blade now broken, the pillar stands alone, leaning. Goods brought to market unsold—withered and withering, a curse.\n\n**Guan** | Spring swans fly east, exchanging horses for gold. Tenfold profit gained, heavily laden, they return home.\n\n**Shike** | Golden teeth, tempered jaws—long life befits the household. Years and harvests overflow. The greedy gain, though troubled, suffer no blame.\n\n**Bi** | Bathed in rich moisture, washing away disgrace. Shaking off disaster and blame, renewed with longevity and fortune.\n*Variant:* Bathed in virtue.\n\n**Bo** | Treading in harmony, ascending the palace steps, rising high and steep. Blessings and fortune overflow, upheld by heaven’s might.\n\n**Fu** | The earth’s profound virtue, the teeming multitude flourishes. Peace, prosperity, and uprightness bring great fortune, securing boundless blessings.\n\n**Wu Wang** | Distant lands, divergent paths, filled with dread and fear. Startling me, leaving me flustered—longing for my old home.\n\n**Da Xu** | Swaddled in infancy, now girded and grown. Stepping forth as a guest, what worry do parents hold?\n\n**Yi** | A single span, a hundred joints, bound fast in tangled knots. Fingers plead for release, yet cannot break free.\n\n**Da Guo** | Hawks and falcons hunt their prey; pheasants and hares, exhausted, flee. Head exposed, tail trapped—seized by man’s snare.\n\n**Kan** | Sitting in peril until dusk, entreaties unanswered. No life-giving rain descends; governance proceeds without doubt.\n\n**Li** | The hard and the soft call to one another, two clans become one household. Frost descends, and together they bestow kindness with benevolence.\n\n**Xian** | A loving mother cherishes her child, feasting and bestowing upon the virtuous scholar. The southern tribes submit; the people rejoice in fear.\n\n**Heng** | The good man and Lady Kong, trembling, ascend the tower. Le Ji does not assist; Wei Zhe flees in haste.\n*Variant:* Zhai Ji.\n\n**Lü** | The elder son, loyal and upright, is betrayed by the Ji clan. Disaster strikes, leaving no heir; the Minister of War loses his fortune.\n\n**Da Zhuang** | The virtue of festive celebration does not tread in chaotic lands. Though dimmed and without luster, the people receive great fortune.\n\n**Jin** | Driving sheep southward, I encounter misfortune. Wolves startle my horse; tigers steal my child—grief and regret, self-blame.\n\n**Ming Yi** | Father Ni, Confucius, skilled at angling carp. With one cast of the net, ten thousand fish are caught, enriching my home.\n\n**Jiaren** | The root not firm, blossoms and leaves fall away, leaving only a solitary widow.\n\n**Kui** | Setting nets to catch fish, instead I snare a pig. Yuan’s loyalty exhausted, the Wu clan is annihilated.\n\n**Jian** | Swift and agile, like an ape leaping through trees. Though the vermilion bow is tuned, in the end, nothing is caught.\n\n**Xie** | Donning cap and sash, journeying south, I meet fortune as promised. Welcomed in a blessed land, I am granted rank and seize the moment.\n\n**Sun** | A year of abundance, harvests ripe, governance benevolent, the people joyful. Entering office, I gain fortune.\n\n**Yi** | Building towers on rocky peaks, foundations laid by water’s source. Illness lingers, unwell; old and solitary, without neighbors.\n\n**Guai** | Chasing the fox eastward to the mountain, water blocks my path. Too deep to ford—I lose advantage and return.\n*Variant:* Meng’s Gu, Shen’s Xun, Gen’s Lin.\n\n**Shen** | The qilin’s young, the phoenix’s chick, born and raised in a blessed land. Where harmonious qi dwells, peace and joy, warmth and kindness abound. The state teems with sages.",

Uncle Bo lodges as a guest.\n\n**Tongren** | Frogs gather in throngs, beseeching heaven for rain. Thunder rumbles, lightning strikes—timely, the rain falls, fulfilling their wish.",

The people know no weariness, secure and without fear.\n\n**Lǚ** | The solitary lord, the widowed wife—alone they lodge in sorrow. Eyes strain wide, ears ring hollow; none share in laughter or speech.\n\n**Song** | *See* **Guimei**. Beyond the frontier, fine livestock are gained, and marriages are made. The wise and worthy gather, consulting on affairs. Yet the city is overthrown, the household left in turmoil.\n\n**Pi** | Molten sand in scorching heat—few remain unspoiled. Three *li* from the river, my profitable trade is ruined. The old hand rears horses—what regret in leaving them?\n\n**Tongren** | Under Jia, Yi, Wu, and Geng, one moves with the seasons. No fixed rhythm is lost; sprouts bend to the measure. All emerge in harmony, each delighting in its kind. *See* **Jian’s Lü**.\n\n**Dayou** | Wandering by night, I meet my lord. Sorrows untangled, the heart is freed from care.\n\n**Qian** | A dead friend, a severed bond—clever words become slander. White is soiled to black, and Yan Shu’s voice is stilled for a time.\n\n**Yu** | Three years chasing gain, profit flees like a spirit. Turning east and west, like a bird dodging a pellet.\n\n**Sui** | The dike breaks at its center, the river floods its banks. Crops are ruined, the people flee their homes. The lord sleeps alone, our town drowned in the deluge.\n\n**Gu** | Yin and Yang are cut off, the betrothal long delayed. Niqiu’s new terrace—regret and sighs for what has passed. *See* **Jin’s Wuwang**.\n\n**Lin** | Boyi and Shuqi, paragons of integrity. With virtue they ward off calamity, and sorrow finds no foothold. *See* **Tai’s Qian**, **Ge’s Pi**, **Bi’s Bo**.\n\n**Guan** | Yang turns reckless and mad, drawing his sword to wound himself—bringing ruin upon his own body. *See* **Mingyi’s Jing**.\n\n**Shike** | The scholar takes office, yet it cannot compare to tilling the fields—there, one gains long life and preserves the years. Carving stone yields no harvest; rushing rites brings no renown. The seamstress loses her needle, the loom stands idle.\n\n**Bo** | The sacred turtle stranded on land, suddenly bereft of its place. Yi Zi returns to plow, but Jie’s chaos finds no aid.\n\n**Fu** | The house stands by the plain’s edge, yet is swept away to become the sea.

No child is lost young; the nation prospers, its people treasured. The anxious gaze upon it, and even the hatred of thieves and bandits ceases.\n\n**Heng** | In the land of harmonious joy, delight becomes my blessing. From the eastern peaks to the southern mountains, crossing brings favor and gratitude.\n\n**Zhu** | The sorrow of the grieving man—his steps falter, his face changes.

      "translated_text": "Embracing joy in mutual embrace, the eldest son reaches venerable age, receiving blessings and divine favor.\n\n**Great Strength** | The Grand Duke fled from Zhou, concealed in seclusion for seventy years. At last, he met the sagely Wen, becoming the kingdom’s pillar.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Kun**\n\n**Jin** | On the upper reaches of the Jiang and Han, governance is perverse and the people grieve. The yin supplants the yang; the female usurps the male lord.\n\n**Ming Yi** | Tangled as disordered silk, raising a hand brings disaster. Chasing hares through the fields, one’s clothes are soaked and ruined.\n\n**The Family** | Rotten wood borne by stench, aided by wolves. Husband lost, child gone—grief extends to parents.\n\n**Divergence** | The sheep arrives unmet; the woman holds an empty basket. The hare limps, the deer is deformed; Green Mountain collapses, slander and flattery arise in chaos.\n\n**Obstruction** | Drawing a sword to wound the hand, facing the enemy without joy. A loyal minister lacks support, beset by trouble and fault.\n\n**Release** | Three offerings, five omens—together they proceed. Lost in an empty marsh, following the valley due north. Traversing six brambles, one is harmed and defeated.\n\n**Decrease** | Contending for the oriole, the sheep is lost; the golden pouch vanishes. Gains are short-lived—the woes of Chen and Cai find peace only through Chu.\n\n**Heng’s Central**\n\n**Increase** | Three black steeds bear the crossbeam, journeying south to gather fragrant angelica. Autumn orchids, rich and sweet, fill the sacred coffer, benefiting my middle and youngest brothers.\n\n**Gua** | In the first month of spring, on the day *ji-chou*, one calls out to Uncle Zhong. When bright virtue ends, tyranny and cruelty flourish.\n\n**Pregnancy** | \"The shoe does not fit the foot\"—the southern mountain bears many leaves. A household with orchids and angelica knows no illness.\n\n**Gathering** | Three legs, no head—it knows not where to go. The heart is mad, the eyes are wounded; let none make it see, for it beholds not the daylight.\n\n**Ascending** | Supporting Yao and aiding Yu, the towering pines and Pengzu. Passing west of the Queen Mother, the road is smooth and easy—none dare oppose.\n\n**The Army’s Li**\n\n**Distress** | Fading, fading away—woe and misfortune entwine. Separated by rocky mountains, the household scatters.\n\n**The Well** | The sacred tortoise on land, suddenly displaced. Yi’s son returns to plowing; Jie’s chaos lacks aid.\n\n**Revolution** | Benevolent virtue spreads, grace extending to distant lands. Blessings reach foreign realms, while hidden calamities lurk. If one does not build a house early, in the cold there will be no shelter.\n\n**The Cauldron** | Summer wheat, lush and abundant, its awns struck by frost. The cruel lord ruins the state, causing years to be cut short.\n\n**Thunder** | Though fire blazes fiercely, it is behind me. Though bandits are many, they are to my right. My body is safe and fortunate, free from peril.\n\n**Thunder’s Guimei, Abundance’s Need**\n\n**Mountain** | Distant roads severed, the traveler lodges with much regret. The stubborn and reckless gather, breeding my fear and dread.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Small Livestock**\n\n**Gradual Progress** | Suspended over the southern sea, ten thousand *li* from home. The flying hare and swift steed—one day I see my mother, dispelling my sorrow and regret.\n\n**Abundance** | Obstructed, then through—though pressed, not impoverished. At last, the wish is fulfilled; Ji and Jiang follow together.\n\n**Travel** | The western merchant in Ba and Shu, the cold snow reaching the hub. Wishing to advance but unable, he returns to an empty chamber.\n\n**Wind** | Building a new tomb, it collapses and is hard to ascend. Three colts push the cart, stumbling and wounding the jaw.\n\n**Lake** | Stretching the neck to gaze at wine, it does not enter my mouth. Hollow-eyed, self-tormenting—the gain is nothing, yet the recluse is pleased.\n\n**Exchange** | Mid-spring to early summer, where harmonious *qi* dwells. It brings me joy and fortune; the land knows no ruin or thieves.\n\n**Moderation** | Casting a net to catch the turtledove, the hare escapes its harm. Male and female both caught, they are sold and betrayed.\n\n**Li** should be *li* (suffering).\n\n**Inner Truth** | Three travel together; one speaks of going north. The elder and second wish to go south, but the youngest cannot. The middle desires to split the path—strife and harm arise.\n\n**Small Exceeding** | Promises unkept, deceit misleads. Forced to sleep in the open, returning at night to a warm chamber. The spirits are angered by injustice; ghosts strike the eyes.\n\n**Desire** | Seeking fortune and profit, instead one harms oneself.\n\n**Da Gu’s Observation**\n\n**Completion** | Presenting words to convey sincerity, bringing peace without collapse. Increasing blessings and longevity, achieving fame and success.\n\n**Ming Yi’s Jin**\n\n**Incompletion** | Fire burns the lord’s bed, the household is destroyed. Yet peace and prosperity come—first sorrow, then heavy mourning.",
      "overlap_context": " lord, the people are nurtured and fortune is brought forth. No child is lost young; the nation prospers, its people treasured. The anxious gaze upon it, and even the hatred of thieves and bandits ceases.\n\n**Heng** | In the land of harmonious joy, delight becomes my blessing. From the eastern peaks to the southern mountains, crossing brings favor and gratitude.\n\n**Zhu** | The sorrow of the grieving man—his steps falter, his face changes. Bringing ruin upon himself, he must guard his own conduct.",

In the Dinghai year of the Baoqing reign, I first obtained the book in Putian, transcribed it, and stored it away. Its verses were ancient and elegant, much like the divination phrases recorded in the *Zuozhuan*. I once tried divining with it, and it proved accurate, though I regretted that it contained many omissions and errors, with no other editions for correction.\n\nIn the Gengzi year of the Jiaxi reign, returning from Wumen to Xiaochuan, I happened to meet Prefectural Assistant Magistrate Wang Youdao, who borrowed my family’s copy. Though it also had many omissions and errors, by comparing the two versions, I corrected about eighty or ninety percent. Thus, both our family’s and Wang’s copies became complete. However, there were still many repetitions, with some verses shared by several lines, making verification impossible.\n\nAfter collation, I returned the book to the Wang family and recorded the corrected version at the end of this volume. Written on the fifth day of the fifth month in the Xinchou year of the Chunyou reign, by Gui Yue of Xizhai.\n\n**Postscript to the *Yilin***\nThe Dao of the *Yi* encompasses all things, yet scholars grasp only one aspect of it—none can claim it is not the *Yi*. The *Yi* existed in the Xia and Shang dynasties as the Three *Yi*. Later, the *Lianshan* and *Guicang* were lost, leaving only the *Zhouyi* in transmission.\n\nBy the Han dynasty, the *Zhouyi* had branched into three schools: the *Yi* of Tian He, the *Yi* of Jiao Gan, and the *Yi* of Fei Zhi. Tian He’s *Yi* was transmitted from Confucius, dividing the text into upper and lower sections, with the Ten Wings as Confucius’ work, complete with chapter-and-verse commentary. Jiao Gan’s *Yi* specialized in divination and observation, as seen in the *Yilin*’s sixteen volumes. Fei Zhi’s *Yi* excelled in hexagram divination, lacking chapter-and-verse commentary, relying solely on images, symbols, and the *Wenyan* to interpret the text within the eight trigrams.\n\nBy the end of the Han, the schools of Tian and Jiao had declined, leaving only Fei’s lineage. After Fei, scholars like Zheng Kangcheng and Wang Bi annotated it. In the Song, Cheng Yi of Luoyang based his commentary on Wang Bi’s *Yi*, which derived from Fei’s. Zhu Xi of Huian, following Lü Bogong’s *Ancient Yi*, grounded his *Benyi* in Tian He’s tradition. Thus, the *Yi* of Tian and Fei flourished, while Jiao’s *Yi* alone lacked transmission.\n\nRecently, while examining books in the imperial archives, I discovered the *Yilin*. Its verses and rhymes were beyond later generations’ reach, resembling the divination phrases in the *Zuozhuan*. I transcribed and stored it, and on occasion, used it for divination—it never failed to prove accurate. Could Jiao’s *Yi* truly lack a foundation?\n\nAlas, my shallow learning prevents me from writing a commentary to propagate it, aiding people in seeking fortune and avoiding misfortune. I record this to await a capable scholar. Written on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month in the Guisi year of the Chenghua reign, by the later student Peng Hua of Ancheng.\n\n**Afterword to the *Yilin***\nThe *Yi* embodies the four sagely Dao: those who speak value its words, those who act value its changes, those who craft tools value its images, and those who divine value its prognostications. These four are all transformations, the work of the numinous.\n\nI read Jiao’s *Yilin*, which expands the sixty-four hexagrams into four thousand ninety-six, each with its own words, changes, images, and divinations. Its meaning is profound and probing, its language concise and ancient, truly revealing what Fu Xi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius left unsaid, and unlocking the wonders of resolving doubts, achieving tasks, and comprehending aspirations. It is all laid bare upon opening the book.\n\nBefore entering office, I always regretted not having seen it. When I governed Wugong, Master Duishan showed it to me. After repeated recitation and reflection, I ordered its printing to broaden its transmission, privately noting the date here. Written in the second month of spring in the fourth year of the Jiajing reign, by Jiang En of Guang’an, on the publication of Jiao’s *Yilin*.\n\nThose who discuss the *Yi* often regard Jiao’s *Yilin* as swift and accurate for divination and observation, yet lament its rarity. Recently, I obtained a copy printed by Prefect Kang of Duishan, entrusted to the magistrate of Wugong, and those who seek it now come in droves.",

      "translated_text": "One day, while attending Military Commissioner Qi of Rongchuan during a judicial inquiry where doubts remained unresolved, he turned to me and said, \"If only Jiao Yanshou were here—nothing would escape his detection.\" I withdrew and performed a divination, obtaining the hexagram *Lawsuit* transforming into *Following*, with the verse:\n\n*\"Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding—*\n*All return to my court.*\n*Three Chou, six sons—*\n*Entering the gate, they see their mother.\"*\n\nFive days later, the case was solved.
