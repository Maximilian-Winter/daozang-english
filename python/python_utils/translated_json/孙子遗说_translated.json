Only when a method is established in speech that attains such boundless depth can it be handed down as teaching in its time and transmitted to later generations.\n\nAmong the schools of the Ru, the *Book of Changes* alone is deemed difficult, for its Way is profound and inexhaustible. Those who study warfare, however, often lament that the teachings of *The Art of War* are subtle and unfathomable—could this not be likened to the *Changes* of the Ru?\n\nThe *Changes* speaks of embracing the Three Powers and encompassing the myriad things, taking the unfathomable interplay of yin and yang as its spirit. Thus, the benevolent see it as benevolence, the wise see it as wisdom, and the common people use it daily without awareness.\n\nThe methods of *The Art of War* encompass the Four Types and envelop the Hundred Schools, taking the mutual generation of the orthodox and the unorthodox as its transformations. Thus, the cunning see it as cunning, the skillful see it as skill, and the Three Armies follow it without comprehension.\n\nYet when the commentaries of the Nine Masters and Hundred Schools arose, the meaning of the *Great Changes* became even more apparent—like the spirit of the sun, moon, and stars, where one can only trace the paths of their brilliance without plumbing the depths of their divinity.\n\nWhen the Ten Commentaries emerged, the methods of the Thirteen Chapters became ever clearer—like the permutations of the Five Tones and Five Colors, where one can only detail what the ears and eyes perceive without exhausting the subtlety of their transformations.\n\nThus, the intent of *The Art of War* cannot be said to be fully captured in the Ten Commentaries. Yet without the explanations of the Ten, students of warfare would be unable to glimpse even the outer fence of its principles. Tracing the current to its source, entering the house through the gate—this is how the methods of *The Art of War* may be said to bear fruit.\n\nIn recent times, during my leisure, I have examined the subtle purport of *The Art of War* and extracted from the Ten Commentaries those points they failed to elucidate, amounting to several dozen matters. I have framed these as questions from a hypothetical interlocutor, presenting the responses in full, and titled the work *Lost Teachings from the Ten Commentaries*. When scholars see what these commentaries have omitted, they may at last believe that the boundlessly profound method and inexhaustible discourse approach the unfathomable spirit of the *Great Changes*.\n\n*Written by Zheng Youxian of Rongyang.*\n\n---\n\n**Sunzi’s Lost Teachings**\n\n**Question:** In the phrase *\"the ground of death and life,\"* why does [Sunzi] first speak of *\"the Way of survival and destruction\"*?\n\n**Answer:** Sunzi’s intent is that the great matter of warfare lies in the commander obtaining the right person. If the commander is capable, the army triumphs and lives; if the army lives abroad, the state survives at home. If the commander is incapable, the army is defeated and dies; if the army dies abroad, the state perishes at home. Thus, life and death abroad strike at survival and destruction within.\n\nHence, the defeat at Changping led to Zhao’s ruin, and the army’s annihilation at the Liao River brought about Sui’s downfall. As the Grand Duke said: *\"One without great wisdom or strategy, who relies on brute strength and engages in reckless battle, scattering the army and endangering the altars of state—such a man must never be made a commander.\"* This is the proper order of precedence.\n\nTherefore, it is said: *\"The commander who understands warfare is the arbiter of the people’s lives, the master of the state’s safety or peril.\"*\n\n**Question:** *\"Gaining many calculations,\"* *\"gaining few calculations,\"* and *\"having no reckoning\"*—what do these terms of *\"many,\"* *\"few,\"* and *\"none\"* signify?\n\n**Answer:** The text of *The Art of War* is certainly not vague or baseless. It establishes the Five Matters as its warp and compares the Seven Calculations as its weft—all calculations between self and other are exhausted therein.\n\nAmong the Five Matters, gaining three or four is *\"many,\"* while gaining one or two is *\"few.\"* Among the Seven Calculations, gaining four or five is *\"many,\"* while gaining two or three is *\"few.\"* To fulfill both Five and Seven is *\"complete victory.\"* To fail in these is *\"having no reckoning\"*—that is, acting blindly and rushing into battle, seeking victory only after fighting has begun, pursuing reckless profit, and dispatching an army in a gamble.",
