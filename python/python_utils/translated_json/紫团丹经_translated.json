  "full_translation": "**The Purple Sphere Elixir Canon**\n\n*The Purple Sphere Perfected One states:*\nThe Dao of inner elixir lies within the breath of one’s own body—the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness—below the heart and above the navel. At the outset, all licentious and wayward thoughts must cease; one returns illumination to the Central Palace. Day and night, one remains as if sleepless, the primordial yang unspent. Naturally, fire arises from the kidneys and ascends to pay homage to the heart, where true yang unites with the Central Palace—this is the union of heart and kidneys. After a hundred days of practice, the elixir head coalesces. The Three Palaces ascend and descend, the River Chariot revolves, qi resounds within the abdomen, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, and fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, suffusing the body with harmony.\n\nShould one fail to maintain vigilance for even an hour or neglect seated practice for a single night, the medicinal essence will dissipate, the fire timing falter, and all prior effort be forfeit. This is a Dao easily encountered yet difficult to perfect.\n\nAs *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"To cultivate but a single element is to wander in exhaustion!\"* Thus, though thousands or tens of thousands study, scarcely one or two ever succeed. Years pass in vain, and with hoary hair, they sigh in bewilderment. Yet the fault lies not in the practice itself, but in men’s yang being external and their yin internal, their natures prone to flight and restlessness, unable to refine and restrain.\n\n*Master Nameless says:* Essence, qi, and spirit are the great foundation of the body. Alas, this substance is the utmost yin of posterior heaven—without the true yang elixir of prior heaven to transmute one’s own yin mercury, how can it congeal and transform? This is a Dao difficult to encounter yet easy to perfect.\n\nRegard body and mind as Kan and Li, man and woman as dragon and tiger. When the knife and spatula enter the mouth, once mercury is obtained, it gathers without scattering, and the more it is refined, the firmer it becomes. With the return of wind and the blending of chaos, within a hundred days, one attains spiritual communion. Though a fool or simpleton, through this practice, one instantly transcends to the rank of sages.\n\n*Ma Ziran says:* *\"To speak of beginning at the hour of Chou brings laughter that cannot be stilled. Yet this very thing is the returning elixir, though it often leads men astray under heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Most High* says: *\"When inferior men hear the Dao, they laugh greatly. If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\"*\n\nAs *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The effort is easy, the medicine not distant—revealed, it makes men burst into laughter.\"* Such is the wondrous principle of the outer elixir.\n\nThe Dao of the inner elixir lies in the absence of a single arising thought, in silent inner vigilance, in unwavering constancy day and night. Those of strong will, men of iron spines, through long stillness achieve success. They may project spirit and shed the body, coming and going freely—these are the immortals. Yet among thousands or tens of thousands of modern scholars, scarcely one or two attain this, for it is a Dao easily encountered yet difficult to perfect.\n\nIf one cultivates both inner and outer elixirs, refining both nature and life, one must first enter seclusion and sit in stillness, clearly recognizing the Central Palace as the dwelling of body and life. Day and night without sleep, the mind guards within, the heart and kidneys unite in union, and the five qi gather in the Central Palace. After a hundred days of purity, the chaotic elixir head forms, resembling a parrot’s egg—lively and fluid, gathering and dispersing, ascending and descending. It is easily dissipated and difficult to congeal.\n\nThereafter, one extracts the single point from Kan, the true unity of pure yang elixir, to transmute the yin mercury elixir head within Li, instantly transforming it into a body of pure Qian. Thus, once obtained, it is eternally retained, gathering without scattering. Success is achieved in days, with both form and spirit perfected. There is no need to project spirit or shed the body—one may pierce metal and penetrate stone, perform a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes. Then, sitting in stillness for nine years, one awakens to the nature school, attaining the Dao of heavenly immortals.\n\n**Secret Formula of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"The six hours from Zi to Si form half a celestial cycle.\"* To perform this most wondrous practice, one moves this water and conducts this fire, also taking baths and ablutions. The count is six days, corresponding to three months. Altogether, the movement of water spans from Wu to Hai, six hours in number.\n\nFrom Zi to Si, one conducts fire weighing one jin, one liang, and one zhu—twenty-four zhu make one liang, which is one breath. Water is metal-water, also called the wine within the pot. When drawing from the water tripod, it is at the twenty-fourth Si, within the six-hour celestial count. Only two hours are spent in this movement, also within the celestial count, but one must not proceed past Zi. If the hour is misaligned, the medicine will lack efficacy.\n\nIf one conducts water and fire in accordance with the hours, harmonizing with the utmost wonder of heaven and earth, not a single thing will go amiss. This fire timing is a secret formula of the highest immortals—it must not be treated lightly! To transmit it to the unworthy invites heavenly retribution.\n\n*Zhang the Perfected One says:* *\"Meeting someone yet not transmitting the secret celestial treasure, or transmitting it to the unworthy, is to leak the heavenly Dao. When transmitting, one must ensure the recipient is genuine; reckless transmission brings karmic punishment to seven generations.\"*\n\nTo those without faith, even if surrounded by gold and jade, do not impart this. Moreover, to transmit this Dao, one must preserve essence and nurture qi, accumulate virtuous deeds to save others, honor parents, revere heaven and earth, and repay the king and the land. Thus, success is achieved in days, and one stands shoulder to shoulder with the ancient sages. If one acts recklessly or lightly, dust and obstacles arise, and success is unattainable. But by following this wondrous Dao, ascending to the golden towers of heaven—how could it be difficult?\n\nThrough this Dao dwelling within me, I rescue and uplift seven generations of ancestors. The Dao is originally formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; it is originally nameless, and we forcibly call it the Dao. One must reverently guard this secret, for in every place, divine dragons offer protection.\n\n*Zhang the Perfected One says:* *\"Transmitting thrice to the unworthy brings three great calamities. If one treats it lightly or leaks it, one will fall into the suffering of Dengdu. Later, those of like mind and love for the Dao should guide one another, that the multitudes may avoid premature death.\"*\n\nMy fate is not decreed by Heaven. The *Luyanzi Secret Formula for Refining and Nurturing* by Yu Shouyi of Western Shu—this formula was already revered as the profound root by the divine immortals of high antiquity. Receive it with reverence and treasure it, that primordial yang may be deeply stored within the Purple Palace, and true essence may ascend to the Original Palace. The key lies in seizing the moment to apply or withdraw, and in fortifying the Seven Gates and sealing the Eight Deviations—truly the essential Dao. If treated lightly or leaked, one will incur the retribution of yin. This is the twenty-eighth transmission of the Purple Radiance Perfected One!\n\n**Ancient Immortal’s Secret Formula**\n- Black Dragon’s spine and brain: 24 taels, soaked in fine rice vinegar, then roasted until scorched red and ground to powder.\n- Sal ammoniac: half a tael.\n- Fennel: half a tael.\n- Sour jujube kernels: half a tael, stir-fried and shelled.\n- Magnetite: one tael, calcined in fire and quenched in vinegar seven times.\n- Stone swallows: three, prepared identically.\n- Pumice: two taels, prepared identically.\n- Walnut meat: half a tael, stir-fried.\n- Lotus seeds: one tael.\n- Morinda root: one tael, stir-fried.\n- Foxnut seeds: one tael.\n- Polygala root: one tael, with hearts removed.\n- Cistanche: one tael, soaked in wine.\n- Acorus: one tael.\n\nGrind the above into powder. Take twenty-one yellow sparrows, remove their beaks, wings, feathers, feet, and entrails, then boil them in fine wine until pulpy. Discard the bones and mix with the powder to form pills the size of tung seeds. Take thirty pills on an empty stomach, washed down with musk wine. At the critical moment, one may feel as though drawing water through a tube, or like insects crawling from below upward, with heat blazing like fire—this is the sign of efficacy. After five to seven days of ingestion, a natural response will follow. Take again at the appointed time; the formula powerfully seals the essence-chamber, replenishes primordial yang, and when closed, true essence ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, coalescing into a treasure!\n\nThe Dao of cultivation and refinement does not depart from the Five Phases and the union of yin and yang. Just as Heaven and Earth do not unite, the myriad things cannot arise; just as the sun and moon do not unite, the waxing, waning, crescents, and fullness of the lunar phases cannot be distinguished.\n\nWhen husband and wife do not unite, men and women cannot nurture and raise offspring. Only through harmonious union do they remain mortal; through reversed union do they attain sagehood. Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"When the woman dons blue robes and the gentleman wears plain white silk, though seen, they must not be used; though used, they must not be seen.\" If husband and wife meet in union, affection naturally lingers. Within the crucible, flames take flight, and the Perfected One emerges of itself.\n\nMaster Lü the Perfected says: \"Let spirit unite while body does not; allow inner release while outer remains sealed.\" The High Perfected says: \"Union has its time; gathering has its day. Gather and take with utmost care.\" Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"I urge you to gather in accord with the seasons.\"\n\nMoreover, the Western Florescence Perfected, in discoursing on the method of longevity, directly points to the true principle of lead and mercury, fearing that世人 might mistake seminal essence and fluids for lead and mercury, or heart and kidneys for Kan and Li, abandon their wives, cease eating grain, retreat into mountain forests, emulate pines and consume cypress, chant mantras and drink water, recite scriptures and swallow elixirs—all losing the source of the True One. To hope for the completion of the Reverted Elixir thus would be like netting rabbits in water, seeking fish in green wood, or drawing cakes to allay hunger—all vain efforts.\n\nThey know not that the True Dragon is the sun, Heaven, mercury, the soul of wood, the male—what the sages cryptically call the Azure Dragon. The True Tiger is the moon, Earth, metal, lead, the spirit, the female—what the sages cryptically call the White Tiger. Therefore, true lead is that which has not yet been tempered by the Azure Dragon. It flourishes most in the flowering season of the gui year, and must be gathered with the Azure Dragon Sword—then there will be no error. \"One mouthful of the Flying Spirit Sword, two horns of the Reverted Elixir—all rests upon where the blade’s edge falls. Without the guidance of an enlightened master, countless kalpas of cultivation will be in vain.\"\n\nMasters Zhang and Lü the Perfected also say: \"Gather the heart of the flower, the medicine of the flower—layer upon layer of radiant beauty. Pluck the spring blossoms with their stems, drink the wine of jade nectar. At this moment, the Dao begins to sprout.\" The worldly do not fathom the principle within the flower; one decision of celestial mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\n\nThus, the yin essence of man cannot congeal without true lead; it must rely on the union of lead and mercury to return to the man’s original palace, forming a single round pearl. After ten months of fulfillment, the embryo is transformed through spiritual transmutation.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: \"When frost flies in the tenth month, the elixir is ripe—even spirits and ghosts must marvel.\" A single grain of the knife’s measure, born within the chamber, grows as large as a pomegranate seed, its color fresh as amber. Only one grain of this elixir may be taken; if the fire is too great, cease.\n\nMaster Lü the Perfected says: \"A grain of the knife’s measure determines longevity; true lead must refine jia and geng. Fire is drawn from the crimson phoenix marrow of the south; water from the black turtle essence of the north.\" He also says: \"Swallowing one grain of the Golden Elixir, you will know at last that my fate is not ruled by Heaven.\"\n\nAfter ingesting the elixir, all depends on the regimen of fire and nurturing, the method of withdrawal and addition—never departing from the Recumbent Moon Crucible. He also says: \"There is a natural true fire regimen; no need for kindling or blowing.\" And: \"Within the Recumbent Moon Crucible, the jade medicine is born; within the cinnabar tripod, mercury lies level. Only after the fire’s power is harmonized does the yellow sprout gradually grow.\"\n\nThe foregoing songs and verses contain the secret formulas of the true immortals. Cultivate according to this method, and you will surely ascend to the rank of immortality. Those of like mind and devotion to the Dao who come after, having obtained this, must keep it secret and not lightly disclose it. Hold it in reverence! Exercise caution!\n\nThe *Purple Cluster Elixir Canon* concludes. #1 (Note: \"也\" should be corrected to \"他\".)\n\n**Preface to the Recumbent Moon Mysterious Gold Chapter**\n\nBefore the Dao divided, it could not be illuminated or perceived. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, it was called the \"dim and obscure\"—the formless Dao. After the Dao had separated, the Great Beginning arose; the Five Phases were distinguished, the Two Modes established. The sun and moon became the hun and po, circulating the Five Phases between heaven and earth, arraying yin and yang as qi and seasons, ascending and descending within the cosmos. The pestle and mortar stars appear at the southern and northern sources, forming the hexagrams of Qian and Kun, converging between Xu and Hai. Through the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, yin and yang unite in harmony, and thereafter the myriad things are born. All things receive their endowment at Hai, emerging from non-being, and germinate at Ren and Zi. Humans, born alongside the myriad things, all issue forth from the gateways of heaven and earth. Qian is the gate of heaven; Kun is the door of earth. As Bo Yang said: \"Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*.\" In human birth, the Dao of Qian forms the male, the Dao of Kun forms the female; the two emotions interact and receive their qi. Yang essence becomes the hun, yin essence becomes the po; when the two essences contend, spirit is born.\n\nThus, the sage seizes the transformative mechanism of Qian and Kun, harmonizes the essences of male and female, yin and yang, unites the hun and po of the sun and moon’s transformations, and gathers the correspondences of the Five Phases and Three Origins. Thereby, the single qi merges with the Two Modes, the Three Powers are complete, and the Four Images are communicated. Nurtured within the divine chamber’s earthen crucible, once the Five Phases are fully present, the elixir naturally forms. The sages of antiquity and the immortals of recent ages all ascended to heaven by refining the golden elixir.\n\n**First: Refining and Nurturing the Golden Elixir in the Divine Chamber**\n\nTo refine the golden elixir, one must rely on the qi of Qian and Kun, mutually restraining and subduing each other, congealing to form the Great Elixir. The true mercury of men naturally yearns for lead; though temporarily retained, it soars when exposed to fire, making it difficult to subdue. Only when red lead is obtained to temper its nature—even if dispersed—can white silver then gather it, causing it to congeal without scattering. Thereafter, it is refined in the Recumbent Moon Mysterious Gold Crucible, irrigated with red snow and jade cream, bathed in golden water, and after ninety days, the yang elixir is achieved. As Immortal Bao said: \"Refine the head in the eighth month, the tail in winter.\" Gao Xiangxian said: \"Great indeed! After ninety days, the work is complete and verification possible!\" After ninety days of refining, the qi returns, transforming entirely into pure yang. As Zhang Langxian said: \"The golden crow sets, the jade hare rises.\" Gao Xiangxian said: \"All things are born of heaven and earth.\" Once the body of pure yang is achieved, one then selects the golden elixir that has formed, ingests a single grain, and ascension to heaven is assured! Having obtained the sage’s profound secrets, though the elixir canons number a hundred thousand words, one glance suffices for comprehension—what is meant by \"mastering one method completes all things.\" The Dao is not distant!\n\n**Second: Gathering Red Snow to Refine the Yang Elixir**\n\nOnly by collecting red snow and refining it into white silver does the true essence stabilize and the original yang begin to coalesce. The refined yang elixir becomes the foundation of life, forming the mysterious pearl as the root of longevity. Thereafter, essence flourishes in the cinnabar field, where the original qi resides, circulating through the blood vessels. As Pingshu said: \"The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within the pearl; the jade pool first receives silver from the water.\" Red snow is produced within the golden crucible’s moonlight, known as \"gold within water,\" which the sages name the supreme treasure. As Hai Chan said: \"Refining yields a sufficiency of yang elixir.\" Pingshu said: \"Such a supreme treasure exists in every household.\" The green crucible’s qi and blood sea—termed the \"confluence of the four seas,\" also called the \"water source\"—its meridians are likened to tidal seas, their arrival predictable, hence also called \"trustworthy water.\" Its color is red, called \"red water\" or \"descending qi,\" also known as \"black lead,\" which generates spirit and engenders transformation, thus called \"divine water.\" Sharing the same meridian as the Greater Yin, it cycles through thirty days, beginning anew, with two crescents and the new and full moons spanning five days. Water and metal generate the woman’s \"trustworthy water,\" arriving five times in a month. Mercury born in water and gold sinks and is turbid; after three days, it floats and becomes clear. The clear is the medicine; the turbid is black lead. As Immortal Yin said: \"Black lead has encountered gathered red lead.\" As Master Lü said: \"Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water source, then know the separation between metal and wood.\" Pingshu said: \"Without recognizing floating and sinking, host and guest are undetermined.\" This is the proof. After three days, on the fourth and fifth days, gather the floating and clear substance—red lead, also called red snow, water-gold, or white silver. White silver is produced from black lead. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Lead’s nature is to float; silver’s nature is to sink.\" The formula says: At midnight, the hour of Zi, a rosy glow naturally illuminates the crucible’s surface, filling the chamber with light. The lead, containing the five colors, radiates brilliance externally, and the light shines of itself. As Hai Chan said: \"Turning the head to follow the cycle, a rosy glow fills the chamber.\" Master Lü said: \"The warm lead crucible’s light penetrates the curtains.\" The Purple Cluster Immortal said: \"When the crucible’s light and qi are replete, this is the moment to gather the medicine. Choose a master to verify the method, follow the daily practice, and the medicine will surely form!\"\n\n**Third: Gathering the Yin-Yang True Elixir**\n\nTo gather the elixir medicine, one must skillfully turn the heavenly pivot and earthly axle, inverting above and below, employing the intent of the tortoise drinking, so that the gathered medicine directly enters the Crimson Palace, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, where it transforms into the mysterious pearl. The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise on land; when humans unleash their killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn.\" This is what is meant.\n\nSea Toad said: \"At this time, the crucible rests in the east (甲乙), the furnace aligns with the west (庚辛); turning the heavenly pivot, the Jade Balance halts its mechanism; rolling the earthly axle, the six lines transform as one. The muddy pearl appears before the twin trees, borne across the Celestial Bridge. The Gate of the Mysterious Female opens, and within the Flowery Pond, the true dragon returns to receive it.\n\nOnce, the Yellow Emperor roamed Red City and obtained the mysterious pearl. Li Ming sought it in vain—this Dao cannot be seized by sight. Later, he sent Wang Xiang to search, and it was found, for when profit is utterly cut off and nothing is seen, the mysterious pearl emerges in the midst of dim obscurity. Gao Xiangxian said: 'The mysterious pearl flies to Kunlun’s summit—if you would obtain it, seek Wang Xiang.'\n\nThe true essence of man is called the Great Yang Flowing Pearl; the descending qi of woman is called the Great Yin Mysterious Pearl. If it flees and cannot be restrained—like mercury meeting great fire, instantly vaporizing and flying away—only when bound by silver does it settle and congeal, as mercury meeting silver becomes cinnabar. Nurtured by fire, it transforms and blooms into golden flowers. The Yin Immortal Lord said: 'Golden flowers give birth to heaven and earth’s treasure'—this is what is meant.\n\nTo gather the red lead medicine is called 'transmitting the elixir,' for it is the transmission of red snow. Whether entering the Crimson Palace or passing through the Three Passes to ascend directly to the Mud Pill Palace, since ancient times, immortals and sages have passed this down mouth to mouth, never committing it to paper.\n\n**Fourth: The Verification Formula for the Returned Elixir**\n\nFor those who study the Dao, first recognize the returned elixir, and you will surely become an immortal! The *Profound Principles Sutra* states: 'Only fear the lead is not true—if the lead is true, the medicine forms itself; only fear the mercury is not upright—if the mercury is upright, the medicine must be sacred.' It also says: 'There is a day for gathering, a time for taking—people use it yet do not know.'\n\nPingshu said: 'On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—this is precisely when the golden essence flourishes. The golden essence is the golden elixir; once obtained, success can be achieved in days.' Before completion, merely ingesting a single grain can instantly transmute the yin qi within the body, transforming it entirely into pure yang to become a divine immortal.\n\nThus, woman is the image of the Kan trigram, and within Kan lies one yang, called the Kan male—like the rabbit in the moon. Man is the Li trigram, containing one yin line, called the Li female—like the crow in the sun. Pingshu said: 'Take the solid center from the Kan position, transmute the yin within the Li palace. If you obtain the golden elixir medicine, after ingestion, you will traverse a thousand springs.' He also said: 'A single grain of knife-round divides into five colors, the flying elixir enters the immortal’s grotto.'\n\nZhao Jiangzhen said: 'After the seven returns and nine reversions complete their work, merely consume one grain to reach the immortal’s home.' Pingshu said: 'Swallowing a single grain of golden elixir, I know my fate is no longer ruled by heaven.' Sea Toad said: 'A single grain of golden elixir is the medicine of longevity, the Dao of achieving true unity.'\n\nThe *Primal Chaos Sutra* states: 'When lead and mercury unite, immortality can be sought; when mercury and lead meet, the Dao is never unfulfilled.' Master Bao said: 'Cinnabar slowly becomes silver through nine revolutions—how many have been misled to their deaths!'\n\nThe returned elixir uses the true dragon and true tiger, true lead and true mercury, harmonizing them within the Palace of Mutual Resonance. Afterward, gather and ingest it according to the proper time and day—this is called the returned elixir.\n\nHumans are the physical form transformed by the five aggregates, a temporary union of earth, water, fire, and wind, with qi as the root, spirit as the foundation, and essence as the base. Failing to awaken to the primal source, one remains deluded, losing original qi, damaging the fundamental essence, dissipating the supreme treasure, and thus failing to achieve the immortal Dao. Therefore, the sage clarifies the return, discerns ascent and descent, establishes host and guest, distinguishes lead and mercury, and illuminates the fire times—thus the Dao is surely accomplished!\n\nThe return is the beginning and end of the great elixir.\n\n**Fifth: The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—Matching and Harmonizing Categories**\n\nThe return is the return to the source, the reversion to the origin. If the great elixir is accomplished, it seizes heaven and earth’s creative power, condenses water and fire’s essence and spirit, cycles back and forth to gather the great medicine, and penetrates above and below to form the golden elixir.\n\nMaster True Unity said: 'The true yin elixir, water and fire, harmonize within a hundred days.' The Yin Immortal Lord said: 'This is the qi of Great Unity Yin.' Master Bao said: 'The Yellow Emperor, bowing to Guangchengzi, obtained the Dao of true unity.'\n\nTo refine the golden liquid returned elixir, first take the unused crucible, with the red lead within the body as the elixir’s head. Then take the used crucible, where the white silver within the body congeals into golden flowers, refining them into pure yang. Reintroduce it into the Palace of Mutual Resonance, within the Qian palace, and nurture the embryo for ten months until the qi is full. The process is complete after three cycles.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Sayings* begins: 'Beneath the beginning green, the moon and the sun...' The two characters 'beginning green' are incomprehensible to people. 'Beginning' refers to the female embryo; 'green' is the master of the elixir. The golden liquid returned elixir is the true lead of the alchemical maiden. It is also called fire lead, the true yang of the southern direction’s correct color. It is also called nine-revolved cinnabar, the Scarlet-Clad Immortal, the Radiant Golden Elixir, or the fire pear and burning jujube. It ripens in autumn, hence called autumn stone.\n\nThe *Primal Chaos Sutra* states: 'Red lead is the white tiger—first experience this joy. If one ingests it into the abdomen, it permeates the skin and flesh, harmonizing the four limbs. After three months, spiritual communication is achieved, and the great Dao is cultivated. When three thousand merits are fulfilled, lead congeals and mercury solidifies; water restrains fire and fire is subdued—then the supreme medicine is complete. Though the returned elixir’s work is accomplished and immortality is not yet achieved, one can attain longevity and avoid death!\n\nThe method requires the crucible to be perfectly prepared, the tiger and dragon free of all ailments before proceeding. It is crucial that the woman be under twenty-one, her menstrual water just cleared, and the mysterious pass not yet closed. At midnight, the hour of zi, when arousal occurs, ensure her spirit is joyful and qi harmonized. Then drive the green dragon to mate with the white tiger. After a moment, use the Seven-Star Sword to gather it, entering the original palace—thus the returned elixir will form in days.\"\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl and White Paste—when primordial qi flourishes, sinews and bones grow strong, no different from youth. Master Xu the Perfected says: \"As the White Tiger just departs the Jade Grotto’s gate, the Crimson Dragon leaps from the True Pearl Sea.\" It fortifies primordial yang, like drinking nectar of jade—ancient immortals called it \"Heavenly Wine,\" also \"Crimson Wine,\" \"Gold in Water,\" or \"Golden Flower.\" This substance can congeal into pearls, a treasure of Heaven and Earth, hence called the Mysterious Pearl. If one ingests it, life endures as long as Heaven and Earth—thus it is also named the Queen Mother’s Immortal Peach, the Life-Restoring Elixir of Returned Soul, or the Purple Gold Elixir. Its sprout, born of true earth, is called the Yellow Sprout. The Yellow Sprout is the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, the Great Unity’s revolving convergence, where the Seven Luminaries and Nine Palaces gather and spirit coalesces—hence it is the root and stem of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Xiaoyao says: \"Seize the golden essence to lay the foundation of life.\" Master Lü says: \"Those who drank the *daogui* in that moment\"—the method of elixir-gathering—later immortals named it *daogui* according to the times. Master Chuan the Perfected says:\n*\"A single grain of daogui,\nHidden beside the chambered maiden,\nLarge as a pomegranate seed,\nResplendent like fresh amber.\nGather it with utmost purity,\nHarvest it with steadfast heart.\nSwallow the age-extending medicine,\nAnd your merit shall be recorded in Heaven.\"*\n\nThe elixir is obtained in an instant. Master Xiaoyao says: \"The radiant golden elixir forms in a day.\" Master Pingshu says: \"The elixir is complete within one *shichen*.\" The *daogui* lies outside the lower cinnabar field, within the Mysterious Gate, one *cun* and three *fen*. The elixir bears a crimson vein, ascending to the heart above and adhering to the small intestine below. When gathering it, one must concentrate the intent, draw it with an implement, and seize it in reverse—like capturing it alive to swallow whole. Master Zhongli says: \"Tilt the jade gourd, and golden agate bursts forth—seize it alive and swallow it whole.\" It is also said: \"Capture the tortoise and serpent, then reverse and inhale.\" The *Awakening the World Song* says: \"Drive it to become the Crimson Dragon’s head, fiercely snatch the Black Pearl to absorb.\" The ancient sages said: \"Before ingesting the golden elixir, first take the returned elixir—this is not amiss.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Ultimate* says: \"Red lead and black mercury are the great elixir’s foundation.\" Lead is the true lead of the chaste maiden; black lead is the true lead of the woman. Taking the returned elixir before the golden elixir means introducing the red into the black. Thus, the two medicines together form the Mysterious, and the Fire Dragon transforms into a divine immortal.\n\nThe method of the returned elixir lies hidden within the Seven-Star Sword’s secrets; the oral instructions for its execution must be personally transmitted by a master. **Red Lead and Black Mercury as the Elixir’s Foundation, Sixth Chapter**\n\nThe method for refining the golden elixir and returned elixir is fully contained within the *Scripture of Primordial Chaos*. Yet one must also receive the true master’s oral instructions—without encountering a true master, cultivation is difficult to accomplish. The *Scripture of Primordial Chaos* says: \"Before the primordial chaos divided, primordial qi was already distinct.\" Thus, one thing split into two images—these two images are yin and yang. Yang qi ascends to Heaven, yin qi descends to Earth, and between them, humans are born! From human birth, male and female diverge.\n\nIn refining the golden liquid and returned elixir, one must first gather the man’s mercury and woman’s lead, nurture them into an elixir, and recombine the two qi into one—just as before the primordial chaos divided. The *daogui* unites, and the returned elixir is thus formed. If one ingests a single grain, life endures as long as Heaven and Earth. Zhuangzi said: \"Split the primordial chaos, rend the vast mist.\" The ancient sages said: \"To forge the elixir, begin with two, then eight, then one.\" The method uses eight ounces each of lead and mercury, combining the two into one *jin*—forming the character for \"elixir.\" Here, two and eight are yin; one is yang. From eighteen to twenty years of age, regulate them as the crucible and furnace, nurture them as the fire and timing.\n\nThe method requires waiting until the menstrual water has just cleared and the Mysterious Pass remains unsealed. The Green Dragon in the spirit chamber mates with the White Tiger, and yang essence enters the Dragon Palace—then the elixir forms and the embryo congeals. Nurture it for ten months, ensuring the elixir mother does not endure hardship; maintain a calm mind and peaceful body, and the elixir will surely form. After ten months, when the time arrives, the Purple River Chariot descends of its own accord. Seven days later, the elixir emerges from the upper palace on the left—retrieve it using the method of elixir extraction. First, bathe in fragrant water, ascend the altar, and pay homage to the Three Pure Ones, the Ten Loftiest Perfected, and the Perfected of the Great Unity. Afterward, ingest the elixir. The rituals are fully detailed in the lower scroll of the *Scripture of Primordial Chaos*, in the chapter titled \"Dragon and Tiger.\"\n\nFew in the world understand: after ingestion, bones are replaced and intestines transformed into sinews; spirit becomes clear, essence solidifies, yin qi dissipates entirely, and yang qi congeals into truth—thus one becomes a pure yang immortal. Master Lü was called the Perfected of Pure Yang. Master Zhao said: \"Those who do not recognize the thing within yang refer to the One within the two and eight.\" The two and eight are the woman of eighteen, within whose body the true Way of the One is concealed. The One lies hidden within the Mysterious Pass—like a woman’s alignment with the Great Yin during her monthly cycle, completing one revolution of Heaven each month.\n\nThus, Master Yanluo said: \"On the third day, when *geng* is born, the gate closes—metal is born of water. By the first quarter, half-bright; on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the metal essence flourishes, and soul and spirit become whole.\" This alludes to the woman at fifteen or sixteen, when heavenly water arrives and yin essence flourishes. The world says: the first quarter on the seventh or eighth day, the last quarter on the twenty-second or twenty-third—from top to bottom, the number is fixed at sixteen. Master Bao said: \"The eighteen-year-old maiden is even more tender.\" Master Pingshu said: \"When the moon is but a half-wheel at the sky’s edge, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl are already heard. Then focus the mind to cultivate the two and eight—the elixir will form within one *shichen*.\" He also said: \"Between the first and last quarters, the medicine’s flavor is balanced and its qi complete.\"\n\nReturning from the search, the furnace refines within—\nin quiet contemplation, gentle nurturing cooks the fresh elixir.\nHarvest the cinnabar on the fifteenth night of the eighth month,\nwhen the wind is clear and the moon radiant—\nthis is the time when metal essence flourishes in full vigor.\nAt midnight, the hour of *zi*, the first stirrings of yang arise.\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nThere is a season for gathering, a day for harvesting—\ngather and harvest with utmost care,\nlest the black dragon awaken and startle,\nheavenly truth be lost, and the dark pearl slip away.\nThere is a day for gathering, a season for harvesting—\nyet the world uses them without knowing.\n\nFrom ancient times, immortals and enlightened adepts\nall attained perfection through refining and nurturing\nthe golden liquid returning cinnabar.\nFearing the leakage of heavenly secrets,\nthey veiled it under the name of \"external elixir.\"\nLater students, unaware, sought only external cinnabar,\nburning lead and mercury in hopes of transcendence—\nhow far they strayed!\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nThe world does not recognize true yin and yang,\nwandering blindly in search of dragon and tiger.\n\nMaster Pingshu said:\nDo not cling to the crucible and waste effort—\nthe elixir must be refined in the recumbent moon furnace.\nThe furnace is the vessel of the golden elixir,\nyet later students mistakenly believe\nthe recumbent moon furnace, with its waxing and waning phases,\nis the time to harvest the medicine—\na grave error indeed!\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nIf only they could find the recumbent moon furnace,\nI would not fear heavenly retribution,\nand would reveal the essentials of elixir refinement\nto enlighten later students.\n**The Seventh Stage: Nurturing the Elixir’s Fire in the Recumbent Moon Furnace**\n\nThe secret of nurturing the elixir’s fire:\nthe furnace lies within the body’s Chamber of Union.\n*The Scripture of Primordial Unity* states:\nThe White Tiger’s Original Palace is the realm of pure yang—\nthus called the Palace of *Qian*.\nIt can contain the true qi of the Great One—\nthus called the Palace of the Great One.\n\nHerein silver is born, thus called the Cinnabar Pit.\nWithin the Jade Grotto, golden blossoms transform and arise—\nthus called the Golden Chamber.\nWhere true earth abides,\nit is called the Earth Cauldron, or the Gate of *Wu-Ji*.\nThe golden elixir is born here,\nnurtured to achieve transmutation—\nthus called the Spirit Chamber.\nIts pool gives rise to water,\nthus called the Flowery Pond,\nor Spirit Water,\nor the Gate of the Purple Palace.\n\nWithin this gate stand three mountains:\nthe left mountain is named *Jia* Mountain,\nand within it lies a gate called the *Jia* Gate.\nThe right mountain is named *Ji* Mountain,\nand within it lies a gate called the *Ji* Gate.\nBetween them rises a mountain called Purple Gold Mountain.\nThe Purple River Chariot emerges here—\nthe source of water.\nThe substances that issue from *Jia* Mountain and the *Jia* Gate\nare called the Path of *Xi-Yi*,\nthe Path of the Three Blossoms,\nthe Path of White Snow,\nand the Path of the Black Flight.\nThose that issue from *Ji* Mountain and the *Ji* Gate\nare called the Winding River Path,\nthe Path of the Five Colors,\nand the Path of the Yellow Sprout.\n\nMaster Lü said:\nUpon the Winding River, one beholds the moon’s radiant purity—\nthere, the Black Flight appears.\nFor *Jia* and *Ji* earth is true earth.\nMaster Pingshu said:\nThe four images converge within *Wu-Ji*.\nGao Xiangxian said:\nNothing surpasses first knocking at the Gate of *Wu-Ji*,\nfor the Spirit Chamber and Earth Cauldron are true earth.\nWhen *Jia-Ji* true earth unites with the Spirit Chamber’s Earth Cauldron,\nthe two earths merge into a single *daogui*.\n\nYet世人 do not know that the woman’s Water Palace\nfollows the same course as the moon’s *Taiyin* radiance,\nits measure also five days per phase.\nEach month comprises six phases—\nthree *Jia* and three *Ji*.\nOn *Jia* days, the *Jia* Gate opens;\non *Ji* days, the *Ji* Gate opens;\non days of convergence, the Gate of the Purple Palace opens—\nthis is the faithful progression,\nthe five-day phase.\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nHow wondrous!\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nwhen Heaven and Earth engender transformation,\nyin and yang intersect in fives and sixes.\nFive denotes five days per phase;\nsix, six phases per month.\nFor those who refine the elixir,\nthe fire phases are most difficult.\nMaster Pingshu said:\nDo not commit the fire phases to writing.\nMaster Qingxia said:\nWithin six hundred chapters lie boundless matters—\nhow could one lightly reveal celestial secrets?\n\nIn general, the fire phases occur within the six days of *Jia* and *Ji*,\nat midnight, the hour of *zi*.\nOn *Jia* days, tilt the furnace to the right\nto gather the qi from the left gate;\non *Ji* days, tilt the furnace to the left\nto gather the qi from the right gate.\nSince ancient times, immortals have treasured this secret,\nneither disclosing this teaching\nnor revealing this method—\nmerely naming it the Recumbent Moon Furnace.\n\nMaster Pingshu said:\nWithin the Recumbent Moon Furnace, jade buds arise.\nIn all methods of gentle nurturing,\nthe essential lies in guarding against danger and averting peril.\nMaster Lü said:\nThe work of advancing the fire is perilous as the Ox and Dipper.\nMaster Pingshu said:\nIn drawing and adding, be ever vigilant against danger.\n*The Scripture of Yin Conformity* states:\nFire is born of wood,\nand calamity inevitably follows—\nbeware this above all! Let this be your warning.\n\nJust as the world has states, and each state has its ruler—civil governance to the left, martial authority to the right—when neighboring states invade, generals must be deployed to command the troops. The general receives the seal to take command, and the troops wield their weapons to act; the seal and weapons are the lifeblood of the army. With a general to lead the troops and orders issued, victory may be won in every battle. In warfare, the first strike is to sound the drum, and the highest merit lies in seizing the enemy’s banner. After victory, provisions overflow, and the River Chariot transports them straight into the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nOnce within the Mud Pill Palace, the Three Gates must be sealed: the upper gate to prevent the spirit from departing, the middle gate to keep the qi from scattering, and the lower gate to stop the essence from leaking—these are the Three Gates sealed. Once sealed, the work of transport begins, known as the \"Flying Gold Essence behind the Elbow.\" As the Perfected One Xu said:\n*At the Flowery Pond, the jade-like countenance drinks,\nFlying past the Golden Pass, the face blooms like a lotus.*\n\nWhen the golden essence passes the Three Passes and enters the Original Palace, the Golden Elixir is seen—no longer fleeing, it naturally submits. The seal is fire, and fire is the foundation of elixir refinement. In refining the Golden Elixir, fire timing is essential, just as a general with a seal commands troops without disorder. In applying fire timing, water and fire must not be misaligned; any error and the great work is lost. The Five Seals correspond to the Five Affairs; when the Five Affairs are correct, the heart remains unmoved, and when the heart is unmoved, the medicine does not flee. With the medicine unscattered, the Elixir is certain to form.\n\nThis text does not expound the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. Never has there been one who attained immortality through the arts of the bedchamber—thus, this is preserved to warn against delusion, for it is not the true path of immortal cultivation.\n\n*Preface to the \"Recumbent Moon Mysterious Gold\" Chapter #1*\n*(Originally bound with the* Purple Ball Elixir Canon*, but should be separated according to the internal text.)*",

      "translated_text": "**The Purple Sphere Elixir Canon**\n\n*The Purple Sphere Perfected One states:*\nThe Dao of inner elixir lies within the breath of one’s own body—the root of spirit and qi, the valley of emptiness—below the heart and above the navel. At the outset, all licentious and wayward thoughts must cease; one returns illumination to the Central Palace. Day and night, one remains as if sleepless, the primordial yang unspent. Naturally, fire arises from the kidneys and ascends to pay homage to the heart, where true yang unites with the Central Palace—this is the union of heart and kidneys. After a hundred days of practice, the elixir head coalesces. The Three Palaces ascend and descend, the River Chariot revolves, qi resounds within the abdomen, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, and fire blazes in the Cinnabar Field, suffusing the body with harmony.\n\nShould one fail to maintain vigilance for even an hour or neglect seated practice for a single night, the medicinal essence will dissipate, the fire timing falter, and all prior effort be forfeit. This is a Dao easily encountered yet difficult to perfect.\n\nAs *The Awakening to Reality* says: *\"To cultivate but a single element is to wander in exhaustion!\"* Thus, though thousands or tens of thousands study, scarcely one or two ever succeed. Years pass in vain, and with hoary hair, they sigh in bewilderment. Yet the fault lies not in the practice itself, but in men’s yang being external and their yin internal, their natures prone to flight and restlessness, unable to refine and restrain.\n\n*Master Nameless says:* Essence, qi, and spirit are the great foundation of the body. Alas, this substance is the utmost yin of posterior heaven—without the true yang elixir of prior heaven to transmute one’s own yin mercury, how can it congeal and transform? This is a Dao difficult to encounter yet easy to perfect.\n\nRegard body and mind as Kan and Li, man and woman as dragon and tiger. When the knife and spatula enter the mouth, once mercury is obtained, it gathers without scattering, and the more it is refined, the firmer it becomes. With the return of wind and the blending of chaos, within a hundred days, one attains spiritual communion. Though a fool or simpleton, through this practice, one instantly transcends to the rank of sages.\n\n*Ma Ziran says:* *\"To speak of beginning at the hour of Chou brings laughter that cannot be stilled. Yet this very thing is the returning elixir, though it often leads men astray under heaven.\"*\n\nThe *Most High* says: *\"When inferior men hear the Dao, they laugh greatly. If they did not laugh, it would not be the Dao.\"*\n\nAs *The Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The effort is easy, the medicine not distant—revealed, it makes men burst into laughter.\"* Such is the wondrous principle of the outer elixir.\n\nThe Dao of the inner elixir lies in the absence of a single arising thought, in silent inner vigilance, in unwavering constancy day and night. Those of strong will, men of iron spines, through long stillness achieve success. They may project spirit and shed the body, coming and going freely—these are the immortals. Yet among thousands or tens of thousands of modern scholars, scarcely one or two attain this, for it is a Dao easily encountered yet difficult to perfect.\n\nIf one cultivates both inner and outer elixirs, refining both nature and life, one must first enter seclusion and sit in stillness, clearly recognizing the Central Palace as the dwelling of body and life. Day and night without sleep, the mind guards within, the heart and kidneys unite in union, and the five qi gather in the Central Palace. After a hundred days of purity, the chaotic elixir head forms, resembling a parrot’s egg—lively and fluid, gathering and dispersing, ascending and descending. It is easily dissipated and difficult to congeal.\n\nThereafter, one extracts the single point from Kan, the true unity of pure yang elixir, to transmute the yin mercury elixir head within Li, instantly transforming it into a body of pure Qian. Thus, once obtained, it is eternally retained, gathering without scattering. Success is achieved in days, with both form and spirit perfected. There is no need to project spirit or shed the body—one may pierce metal and penetrate stone, perform a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes. Then, sitting in stillness for nine years, one awakens to the nature school, attaining the Dao of heavenly immortals.\n\n**Secret Formula of the Golden Elixir**\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"The six hours from Zi to Si form half a celestial cycle.\"* To perform this most wondrous practice, one moves this water and conducts this fire, also taking baths and ablutions. The count is six days, corresponding to three months. Altogether, the movement of water spans from Wu to Hai, six hours in number.\n\nFrom Zi to Si, one conducts fire weighing one jin, one liang, and one zhu—twenty-four zhu make one liang, which is one breath. Water is metal-water, also called the wine within the pot. When drawing from the water tripod, it is at the twenty-fourth Si, within the six-hour celestial count. Only two hours are spent in this movement, also within the celestial count, but one must not proceed past Zi. If the hour is misaligned, the medicine will lack efficacy.\n\nIf one conducts water and fire in accordance with the hours, harmonizing with the utmost wonder of heaven and earth, not a single thing will go amiss. This fire timing is a secret formula of the highest immortals—it must not be treated lightly! To transmit it to the unworthy invites heavenly retribution.\n\n*Zhang the Perfected One says:* *\"Meeting someone yet not transmitting the secret celestial treasure, or transmitting it to the unworthy, is to leak the heavenly Dao. When transmitting, one must ensure the recipient is genuine; reckless transmission brings karmic punishment to seven generations.\"*\n\nTo those without faith, even if surrounded by gold and jade, do not impart this. Moreover, to transmit this Dao, one must preserve essence and nurture qi, accumulate virtuous deeds to save others, honor parents, revere heaven and earth, and repay the king and the land. Thus, success is achieved in days, and one stands shoulder to shoulder with the ancient sages. If one acts recklessly or lightly, dust and obstacles arise, and success is unattainable. But by following this wondrous Dao, ascending to the golden towers of heaven—how could it be difficult?\n\nThrough this Dao dwelling within me, I rescue and uplift seven generations of ancestors. The Dao is originally formless, giving birth to heaven and earth; it is originally nameless, and we forcibly call it the Dao. One must reverently guard this secret, for in every place, divine dragons offer protection.\n\n*Zhang the Perfected One says:* *\"Transmitting thrice to the unworthy brings three great calamities. If one treats it lightly or leaks it, one will fall into the suffering of Dengdu. Later, those of like mind and love for the Dao should guide one another, that the multitudes may avoid premature death.\"*",

      "translated_text": "My fate is not decreed by Heaven. The *Luyanzi Secret Formula for Refining and Nurturing* by Yu Shouyi of Western Shu—this formula was already revered as the profound root by the divine immortals of high antiquity. Receive it with reverence and treasure it, that primordial yang may be deeply stored within the Purple Palace, and true essence may ascend to the Original Palace. The key lies in seizing the moment to apply or withdraw, and in fortifying the Seven Gates and sealing the Eight Deviations—truly the essential Dao. If treated lightly or leaked, one will incur the retribution of yin. This is the twenty-eighth transmission of the Purple Radiance Perfected One!\n\n**Ancient Immortal’s Secret Formula**\n- Black Dragon’s spine and brain: 24 taels, soaked in fine rice vinegar, then roasted until scorched red and ground to powder.\n- Sal ammoniac: half a tael.\n- Fennel: half a tael.\n- Sour jujube kernels: half a tael, stir-fried and shelled.\n- Magnetite: one tael, calcined in fire and quenched in vinegar seven times.\n- Stone swallows: three, prepared identically.\n- Pumice: two taels, prepared identically.\n- Walnut meat: half a tael, stir-fried.\n- Lotus seeds: one tael.\n- Morinda root: one tael, stir-fried.\n- Foxnut seeds: one tael.\n- Polygala root: one tael, with hearts removed.\n- Cistanche: one tael, soaked in wine.\n- Acorus: one tael.\n\nGrind the above into powder. Take twenty-one yellow sparrows, remove their beaks, wings, feathers, feet, and entrails, then boil them in fine wine until pulpy. Discard the bones and mix with the powder to form pills the size of tung seeds. Take thirty pills on an empty stomach, washed down with musk wine. At the critical moment, one may feel as though drawing water through a tube, or like insects crawling from below upward, with heat blazing like fire—this is the sign of efficacy. After five to seven days of ingestion, a natural response will follow. Take again at the appointed time; the formula powerfully seals the essence-chamber, replenishes primordial yang, and when closed, true essence ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, coalescing into a treasure!\n\nThe Dao of cultivation and refinement does not depart from the Five Phases and the union of yin and yang. Just as Heaven and Earth do not unite, the myriad things cannot arise; just as the sun and moon do not unite, the waxing, waning, crescents, and fullness of the lunar phases cannot be distinguished.",

      "translated_text": "When husband and wife do not unite, men and women cannot nurture and raise offspring. Only through harmonious union do they remain mortal; through reversed union do they attain sagehood. Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"When the woman dons blue robes and the gentleman wears plain white silk, though seen, they must not be used; though used, they must not be seen.\" If husband and wife meet in union, affection naturally lingers. Within the crucible, flames take flight, and the Perfected One emerges of itself.\n\nMaster Lü the Perfected says: \"Let spirit unite while body does not; allow inner release while outer remains sealed.\" The High Perfected says: \"Union has its time; gathering has its day. Gather and take with utmost care.\" Master Zhang the Perfected says: \"I urge you to gather in accord with the seasons.\"\n\nMoreover, the Western Florescence Perfected, in discoursing on the method of longevity, directly points to the true principle of lead and mercury, fearing that世人 might mistake seminal essence and fluids for lead and mercury, or heart and kidneys for Kan and Li, abandon their wives, cease eating grain, retreat into mountain forests, emulate pines and consume cypress, chant mantras and drink water, recite scriptures and swallow elixirs—all losing the source of the True One. To hope for the completion of the Reverted Elixir thus would be like netting rabbits in water, seeking fish in green wood, or drawing cakes to allay hunger—all vain efforts.\n\nThey know not that the True Dragon is the sun, Heaven, mercury, the soul of wood, the male—what the sages cryptically call the Azure Dragon. The True Tiger is the moon, Earth, metal, lead, the spirit, the female—what the sages cryptically call the White Tiger. Therefore, true lead is that which has not yet been tempered by the Azure Dragon. It flourishes most in the flowering season of the gui year, and must be gathered with the Azure Dragon Sword—then there will be no error. \"One mouthful of the Flying Spirit Sword, two horns of the Reverted Elixir—all rests upon where the blade’s edge falls. Without the guidance of an enlightened master, countless kalpas of cultivation will be in vain.\"\n\nMasters Zhang and Lü the Perfected also say: \"Gather the heart of the flower, the medicine of the flower—layer upon layer of radiant beauty. Pluck the spring blossoms with their stems, drink the wine of jade nectar. At this moment, the Dao begins to sprout.\" The worldly do not fathom the principle within the flower; one decision of celestial mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\n\nThus, the yin essence of man cannot congeal without true lead; it must rely on the union of lead and mercury to return to the man’s original palace, forming a single round pearl. After ten months of fulfillment, the embryo is transformed through spiritual transmutation.\n\nMaster Ziyang says: \"When frost flies in the tenth month, the elixir is ripe—even spirits and ghosts must marvel.\" A single grain of the knife’s measure, born within the chamber, grows as large as a pomegranate seed, its color fresh as amber.

      "translated_text": "The *Purple Cluster Elixir Canon* concludes. #1 (Note: \"也\" should be corrected to \"他\".)\n\n**Preface to the Recumbent Moon Mysterious Gold Chapter**\n\nBefore the Dao divided, it could not be illuminated or perceived. Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, it was called the \"dim and obscure\"—the formless Dao. After the Dao had separated, the Great Beginning arose; the Five Phases were distinguished, the Two Modes established. The sun and moon became the hun and po, circulating the Five Phases between heaven and earth, arraying yin and yang as qi and seasons, ascending and descending within the cosmos. The pestle and mortar stars appear at the southern and northern sources, forming the hexagrams of Qian and Kun, converging between Xu and Hai. Through the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, yin and yang unite in harmony, and thereafter the myriad things are born. All things receive their endowment at Hai, emerging from non-being, and germinate at Ren and Zi. Humans, born alongside the myriad things, all issue forth from the gateways of heaven and earth. Qian is the gate of heaven; Kun is the door of earth. As Bo Yang said: \"Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*.\" In human birth, the Dao of Qian forms the male, the Dao of Kun forms the female; the two emotions interact and receive their qi. Yang essence becomes the hun, yin essence becomes the po; when the two essences contend, spirit is born.\n\nThus, the sage seizes the transformative mechanism of Qian and Kun, harmonizes the essences of male and female, yin and yang, unites the hun and po of the sun and moon’s transformations, and gathers the correspondences of the Five Phases and Three Origins. Thereby, the single qi merges with the Two Modes, the Three Powers are complete, and the Four Images are communicated. Nurtured within the divine chamber’s earthen crucible, once the Five Phases are fully present, the elixir naturally forms. The sages of antiquity and the immortals of recent ages all ascended to heaven by refining the golden elixir.\n\n**First: Refining and Nurturing the Golden Elixir in the Divine Chamber**\n\nTo refine the golden elixir, one must rely on the qi of Qian and Kun, mutually restraining and subduing each other, congealing to form the Great Elixir. The true mercury of men naturally yearns for lead; though temporarily retained, it soars when exposed to fire, making it difficult to subdue. Only when red lead is obtained to temper its nature—even if dispersed—can white silver then gather it, causing it to congeal without scattering. Thereafter, it is refined in the Recumbent Moon Mysterious Gold Crucible, irrigated with red snow and jade cream, bathed in golden water, and after ninety days, the yang elixir is achieved. As Immortal Bao said: \"Refine the head in the eighth month, the tail in winter.\" Gao Xiangxian said: \"Great indeed! After ninety days, the work is complete and verification possible!\" After ninety days of refining, the qi returns, transforming entirely into pure yang. As Zhang Langxian said: \"The golden crow sets, the jade hare rises.\" Gao Xiangxian said: \"All things are born of heaven and earth.\" Once the body of pure yang is achieved, one then selects the golden elixir that has formed, ingests a single grain, and ascension to heaven is assured! Having obtained the sage’s profound secrets, though the elixir canons number a hundred thousand words, one glance suffices for comprehension—what is meant by \"mastering one method completes all things.\" The Dao is not distant!\n\n**Second: Gathering Red Snow to Refine the Yang Elixir**\n\nOnly by collecting red snow and refining it into white silver does the true essence stabilize and the original yang begin to coalesce. The refined yang elixir becomes the foundation of life, forming the mysterious pearl as the root of longevity. Thereafter, essence flourishes in the cinnabar field, where the original qi resides, circulating through the blood vessels. As Pingshu said: \"The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within the pearl; the jade pool first receives silver from the water.\" Red snow is produced within the golden crucible’s moonlight, known as \"gold within water,\" which the sages name the supreme treasure. As Hai Chan said: \"Refining yields a sufficiency of yang elixir.\" Pingshu said: \"Such a supreme treasure exists in every household.\" The green crucible’s qi and blood sea—termed the \"confluence of the four seas,\" also called the \"water source\"—its meridians are likened to tidal seas, their arrival predictable, hence also called \"trustworthy water.\" Its color is red, called \"red water\" or \"descending qi,\" also known as \"black lead,\" which generates spirit and engenders transformation, thus called \"divine water.\" Sharing the same meridian as the Greater Yin, it cycles through thirty days, beginning anew, with two crescents and the new and full moons spanning five days. Water and metal generate the woman’s \"trustworthy water,\" arriving five times in a month. Mercury born in water and gold sinks and is turbid; after three days, it floats and becomes clear. The clear is the medicine; the turbid is black lead. As Immortal Yin said: \"Black lead has encountered gathered red lead.\" As Master Lü said: \"Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water source, then know the separation between metal and wood.\" Pingshu said: \"Without recognizing floating and sinking, host and guest are undetermined.\" This is the proof. After three days, on the fourth and fifth days, gather the floating and clear substance—red lead, also called red snow, water-gold, or white silver. White silver is produced from black lead. The *Cantong Qi* states: \"Lead’s nature is to float; silver’s nature is to sink.\" The formula says: At midnight, the hour of Zi, a rosy glow naturally illuminates the crucible’s surface, filling the chamber with light. The lead, containing the five colors, radiates brilliance externally, and the light shines of itself. As Hai Chan said: \"Turning the head to follow the cycle, a rosy glow fills the chamber.\" Master Lü said: \"The warm lead crucible’s light penetrates the curtains.\" The Purple Cluster Immortal said: \"When the crucible’s light and qi are replete, this is the moment to gather the medicine. Choose a master to verify the method, follow the daily practice, and the medicine will surely form!\"\n\n**Third: Gathering the Yin-Yang True Elixir**\n\nTo gather the elixir medicine, one must skillfully turn the heavenly pivot and earthly axle, inverting above and below, employing the intent of the tortoise drinking, so that the gathered medicine directly enters the Crimson Palace, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, where it transforms into the mysterious pearl. The *Yinfu Jing* states: \"When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise on land; when humans unleash their killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn.\" This is what is meant.",

      "translated_text": "Sea Toad said: \"At this time, the crucible rests in the east (甲乙), the furnace aligns with the west (庚辛); turning the heavenly pivot, the Jade Balance halts its mechanism; rolling the earthly axle, the six lines transform as one. The muddy pearl appears before the twin trees, borne across the Celestial Bridge. The Gate of the Mysterious Female opens, and within the Flowery Pond, the true dragon returns to receive it.\n\nOnce, the Yellow Emperor roamed Red City and obtained the mysterious pearl. Li Ming sought it in vain—this Dao cannot be seized by sight. Later, he sent Wang Xiang to search, and it was found, for when profit is utterly cut off and nothing is seen, the mysterious pearl emerges in the midst of dim obscurity. Gao Xiangxian said: 'The mysterious pearl flies to Kunlun’s summit—if you would obtain it, seek Wang Xiang.'\n\nThe true essence of man is called the Great Yang Flowing Pearl; the descending qi of woman is called the Great Yin Mysterious Pearl. If it flees and cannot be restrained—like mercury meeting great fire, instantly vaporizing and flying away—only when bound by silver does it settle and congeal, as mercury meeting silver becomes cinnabar. Nurtured by fire, it transforms and blooms into golden flowers. The Yin Immortal Lord said: 'Golden flowers give birth to heaven and earth’s treasure'—this is what is meant.\n\nTo gather the red lead medicine is called 'transmitting the elixir,' for it is the transmission of red snow. Whether entering the Crimson Palace or passing through the Three Passes to ascend directly to the Mud Pill Palace, since ancient times, immortals and sages have passed this down mouth to mouth, never committing it to paper.\n\n**Fourth: The Verification Formula for the Returned Elixir**\n\nFor those who study the Dao, first recognize the returned elixir, and you will surely become an immortal! The *Profound Principles Sutra* states: 'Only fear the lead is not true—if the lead is true, the medicine forms itself; only fear the mercury is not upright—if the mercury is upright, the medicine must be sacred.' It also says: 'There is a day for gathering, a time for taking—people use it yet do not know.'\n\nPingshu said: 'On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s radiance—this is precisely when the golden essence flourishes. The golden essence is the golden elixir; once obtained, success can be achieved in days.' Before completion, merely ingesting a single grain can instantly transmute the yin qi within the body, transforming it entirely into pure yang to become a divine immortal.\n\nThus, woman is the image of the Kan trigram, and within Kan lies one yang, called the Kan male—like the rabbit in the moon. Man is the Li trigram, containing one yin line, called the Li female—like the crow in the sun. Pingshu said: 'Take the solid center from the Kan position, transmute the yin within the Li palace. If you obtain the golden elixir medicine, after ingestion, you will traverse a thousand springs.' He also said: 'A single grain of knife-round divides into five colors, the flying elixir enters the immortal’s grotto.'\n\nZhao Jiangzhen said: 'After the seven returns and nine reversions complete their work, merely consume one grain to reach the immortal’s home.' Pingshu said: 'Swallowing a single grain of golden elixir, I know my fate is no longer ruled by heaven.' Sea Toad said: 'A single grain of golden elixir is the medicine of longevity, the Dao of achieving true unity.'\n\nThe *Primal Chaos Sutra* states: 'When lead and mercury unite, immortality can be sought; when mercury and lead meet, the Dao is never unfulfilled.' Master Bao said: 'Cinnabar slowly becomes silver through nine revolutions—how many have been misled to their deaths!'\n\nThe returned elixir uses the true dragon and true tiger, true lead and true mercury, harmonizing them within the Palace of Mutual Resonance. Afterward, gather and ingest it according to the proper time and day—this is called the returned elixir.\n\nHumans are the physical form transformed by the five aggregates, a temporary union of earth, water, fire, and wind, with qi as the root, spirit as the foundation, and essence as the base. Failing to awaken to the primal source, one remains deluded, losing original qi, damaging the fundamental essence, dissipating the supreme treasure, and thus failing to achieve the immortal Dao. Therefore, the sage clarifies the return, discerns ascent and descent, establishes host and guest, distinguishes lead and mercury, and illuminates the fire times—thus the Dao is surely accomplished!\n\nThe return is the beginning and end of the great elixir.\n\n**Fifth: The Nine Returns and Seven Reversions—Matching and Harmonizing Categories**\n\nThe return is the return to the source, the reversion to the origin. If the great elixir is accomplished, it seizes heaven and earth’s creative power, condenses water and fire’s essence and spirit, cycles back and forth to gather the great medicine, and penetrates above and below to form the golden elixir.\n\nMaster True Unity said: 'The true yin elixir, water and fire, harmonize within a hundred days.' The Yin Immortal Lord said: 'This is the qi of Great Unity Yin.' Master Bao said: 'The Yellow Emperor, bowing to Guangchengzi, obtained the Dao of true unity.'\n\nTo refine the golden liquid returned elixir, first take the unused crucible, with the red lead within the body as the elixir’s head. Then take the used crucible, where the white silver within the body congeals into golden flowers, refining them into pure yang. Reintroduce it into the Palace of Mutual Resonance, within the Qian palace, and nurture the embryo for ten months until the qi is full. The process is complete after three cycles.\n\nThe *Supreme Hidden Sayings* begins: 'Beneath the beginning green, the moon and the sun...' The two characters 'beginning green' are incomprehensible to people. 'Beginning' refers to the female embryo; 'green' is the master of the elixir. The golden liquid returned elixir is the true lead of the alchemical maiden. It is also called fire lead, the true yang of the southern direction’s correct color. It is also called nine-revolved cinnabar, the Scarlet-Clad Immortal, the Radiant Golden Elixir, or the fire pear and burning jujube. It ripens in autumn, hence called autumn stone.\n\nThe *Primal Chaos Sutra* states: 'Red lead is the white tiger—first experience this joy. If one ingests it into the abdomen, it permeates the skin and flesh, harmonizing the four limbs. After three months, spiritual communication is achieved, and the great Dao is cultivated. When three thousand merits are fulfilled, lead congeals and mercury solidifies; water restrains fire and fire is subdued—then the supreme medicine is complete. Though the returned elixir’s work is accomplished and immortality is not yet achieved, one can attain longevity and avoid death!\n\nThe method requires the crucible to be perfectly prepared, the tiger and dragon free of all ailments before proceeding. It is crucial that the woman be under twenty-one, her menstrual water just cleared, and the mysterious pass not yet closed. At midnight, the hour of zi, when arousal occurs, ensure her spirit is joyful and qi harmonized. Then drive the green dragon to mate with the white tiger. After a moment, use the Seven-Star Sword to gather it, entering the original palace—thus the returned elixir will form in days.\"",

Master Xu the Perfected says: \"As the White Tiger just departs the Jade Grotto’s gate, the Crimson Dragon leaps from the True Pearl Sea.\" It fortifies primordial yang, like drinking nectar of jade—ancient immortals called it \"Heavenly Wine,\" also \"Crimson Wine,\" \"Gold in Water,\" or \"Golden Flower.\" This substance can congeal into pearls, a treasure of Heaven and Earth, hence called the Mysterious Pearl. If one ingests it, life endures as long as Heaven and Earth—thus it is also named the Queen Mother’s Immortal Peach, the Life-Restoring Elixir of Returned Soul, or the Purple Gold Elixir. Its sprout, born of true earth, is called the Yellow Sprout. The Yellow Sprout is the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, the Great Unity’s revolving convergence, where the Seven Luminaries and Nine Palaces gather and spirit coalesces—hence it is the root and stem of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Xiaoyao says: \"Seize the golden essence to lay the foundation of life.\" Master Lü says: \"Those who drank the *daogui* in that moment\"—the method of elixir-gathering—later immortals named it *daogui* according to the times. Master Chuan the Perfected says:\n*\"A single grain of daogui,\nHidden beside the chambered maiden,\nLarge as a pomegranate seed,\nResplendent like fresh amber.\nGather it with utmost purity,\nHarvest it with steadfast heart.\nSwallow the age-extending medicine,\nAnd your merit shall be recorded in Heaven.\"*\n\nThe elixir is obtained in an instant. Master Xiaoyao says: \"The radiant golden elixir forms in a day.\" Master Pingshu says: \"The elixir is complete within one *shichen*.\" The *daogui* lies outside the lower cinnabar field, within the Mysterious Gate, one *cun* and three *fen*. The elixir bears a crimson vein, ascending to the heart above and adhering to the small intestine below. When gathering it, one must concentrate the intent, draw it with an implement, and seize it in reverse—like capturing it alive to swallow whole. Master Zhongli says: \"Tilt the jade gourd, and golden agate bursts forth—seize it alive and swallow it whole.\" It is also said: \"Capture the tortoise and serpent, then reverse and inhale.\" The *Awakening the World Song* says: \"Drive it to become the Crimson Dragon’s head, fiercely snatch the Black Pearl to absorb.\" The ancient sages said: \"Before ingesting the golden elixir, first take the returned elixir—this is not amiss.\"\n\nThe *Scripture of the Great Ultimate* says: \"Red lead and black mercury are the great elixir’s foundation.\" Lead is the true lead of the chaste maiden; black lead is the true lead of the woman. Taking the returned elixir before the golden elixir means introducing the red into the black. Thus, the two medicines together form the Mysterious, and the Fire Dragon transforms into a divine immortal.\n\nThe method of the returned elixir lies hidden within the Seven-Star Sword’s secrets; the oral instructions for its execution must be personally transmitted by a master. **Red Lead and Black Mercury as the Elixir’s Foundation, Sixth Chapter**\n\nThe method for refining the golden elixir and returned elixir is fully contained within the *Scripture of Primordial Chaos*. Yet one must also receive the true master’s oral instructions—without encountering a true master, cultivation is difficult to accomplish. The *Scripture of Primordial Chaos* says: \"Before the primordial chaos divided, primordial qi was already distinct.\" Thus, one thing split into two images—these two images are yin and yang. Yang qi ascends to Heaven, yin qi descends to Earth, and between them, humans are born! From human birth, male and female diverge.\n\nIn refining the golden liquid and returned elixir, one must first gather the man’s mercury and woman’s lead, nurture them into an elixir, and recombine the two qi into one—just as before the primordial chaos divided. The *daogui* unites, and the returned elixir is thus formed. If one ingests a single grain, life endures as long as Heaven and Earth. Zhuangzi said: \"Split the primordial chaos, rend the vast mist.\" The ancient sages said: \"To forge the elixir, begin with two, then eight, then one.\" The method uses eight ounces each of lead and mercury, combining the two into one *jin*—forming the character for \"elixir.\" Here, two and eight are yin; one is yang. From eighteen to twenty years of age, regulate them as the crucible and furnace, nurture them as the fire and timing.\n\nThe method requires waiting until the menstrual water has just cleared and the Mysterious Pass remains unsealed. The Green Dragon in the spirit chamber mates with the White Tiger, and yang essence enters the Dragon Palace—then the elixir forms and the embryo congeals. Nurture it for ten months, ensuring the elixir mother does not endure hardship; maintain a calm mind and peaceful body, and the elixir will surely form. After ten months, when the time arrives, the Purple River Chariot descends of its own accord. Seven days later, the elixir emerges from the upper palace on the left—retrieve it using the method of elixir extraction. First, bathe in fragrant water, ascend the altar, and pay homage to the Three Pure Ones, the Ten Loftiest Perfected, and the Perfected of the Great Unity. Afterward, ingest the elixir. The rituals are fully detailed in the lower scroll of the *Scripture of Primordial Chaos*, in the chapter titled \"Dragon and Tiger.\"\n\nFew in the world understand: after ingestion, bones are replaced and intestines transformed into sinews; spirit becomes clear, essence solidifies, yin qi dissipates entirely, and yang qi congeals into truth—thus one becomes a pure yang immortal. Master Lü was called the Perfected of Pure Yang. Master Zhao said: \"Those who do not recognize the thing within yang refer to the One within the two and eight.\" The two and eight are the woman of eighteen, within whose body the true Way of the One is concealed. The One lies hidden within the Mysterious Pass—like a woman’s alignment with the Great Yin during her monthly cycle, completing one revolution of Heaven each month.\n\nThus, Master Yanluo said: \"On the third day, when *geng* is born, the gate closes—metal is born of water. By the first quarter, half-bright; on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, the metal essence flourishes, and soul and spirit become whole.\" This alludes to the woman at fifteen or sixteen, when heavenly water arrives and yin essence flourishes. The world says: the first quarter on the seventh or eighth day, the last quarter on the twenty-second or twenty-third—from top to bottom, the number is fixed at sixteen. Master Bao said: \"The eighteen-year-old maiden is even more tender.\" Master Pingshu said: \"When the moon is but a half-wheel at the sky’s edge, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl are already heard. Then focus the mind to cultivate the two and eight—the elixir will form within one *shichen*.\" He also said: \"Between the first and last quarters, the medicine’s flavor is balanced and its qi complete.\"",
      "overlap_context": "cible to be perfectly prepared, the tiger and dragon free of all ailments before proceeding. It is crucial that the woman be under twenty-one, her menstrual water just cleared, and the mysterious pass not yet closed. At midnight, the hour of zi, when arousal occurs, ensure her spirit is joyful and qi harmonized. Then drive the green dragon to mate with the white tiger. After a moment, use the Seven-Star Sword to gather it, entering the original palace—thus the returned elixir will form in days.\"",

The general receives the seal to take command, and the troops wield their weapons to act; the seal and weapons are the lifeblood of the army. With a general to lead the troops and orders issued, victory may be won in every battle. In warfare, the first strike is to sound the drum, and the highest merit lies in seizing the enemy’s banner. After victory, provisions overflow, and the River Chariot transports them straight into the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nOnce within the Mud Pill Palace, the Three Gates must be sealed: the upper gate to prevent the spirit from departing, the middle gate to keep the qi from scattering, and the lower gate to stop the essence from leaking—these are the Three Gates sealed.
