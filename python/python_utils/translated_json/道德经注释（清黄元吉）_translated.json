Acting Without Contending\n\n---\n\nThe Way of the Three Teachings is but the Way of the Sage.\nThe Confucian says *sincerity*, the Daoist says *golden elixir*, the Buddhist says *true emptiness*—yet all speak of the same boundless *qi*, permeating heaven, earth, and all beings.\n\nOnly the Sage delves to its source, attaining its utmost, harmonizing with the boundless void of heaven and earth without distinction—thus becoming the Sage.\nCapable of both firmness and yielding, adaptable to round or square, without form to imitate, without sound or stench to constrain—its divine transformations are boundless, beyond comprehension.\n\nIf all is natural and effortless, originally so, neither augmented by the Sage nor diminished by the common—even descending to birds, beasts, grasses, and trees, all share this same *qi*, this same principle.\n\nObserve the vast ocean—water most difficult to fathom. Yet a single sea contains all its waters, and a single dipper holds but water. The *qi* of the boundless void is likewise uniform.\n\nThough heaven, earth, sages, and beings differ in myriad ways, at their formation, they all receive this same *qi*. Beyond this, there is no vital breath, no generative principle—only varying dispositions.\n\nMencius said, *\"The Sage and the commoner share the same nature,\"* and *\"The difference between humans and beasts is slight.\"* Truly, a precise observation.\n\nAlas, the world’s customs decline daily, and the people grow ever more lax. Though the Dao is inherently plain and ordinary, many regard it as deceptive, strange, and bizarre. Thus, Confucianism becomes ever less Confucian, Buddhism ever less Buddhist, and Daoism ever less Daoist.\n\nIf we do not expose the root causes or pierce through the subtle mysteries, the Dao will grow ever more obscured and unmanifest, while human hearts will decay and become ever harder to govern—until, inevitably, we descend to the level of birds and beasts, and sages are no better than the ignorant masses. The Dao will then hang in peril like a fragile egg suspended between heaven and earth, with none to bear the responsibility of preserving civilization.\n\nFortune favors this age of peace, and the land enjoys tranquility. At this opportune moment, I encountered a Daoist friend among the sacred mountains, discussing profound truths and subtle mysteries. I listened in secret, and their words were no mere empty talk for idle ears—I gained true insight from their teachings.\n\nThe assembled revered me as a master, so day and night I lectured on the *Dao De Jing*, using it as proof for cultivating virtue and establishing moral power. Unwittingly, I wrote endlessly, page upon page. Though my flaws are glaring and unworthy of scrutiny by the wise, there are moments where my words align with the subtle intent of the *Tao Te Ching*, offering some small benefit to the world.\n\nMy friends urged me to publish this work for the benefit of future generations. Though I feel deep shame and dare not deceive myself or others, their earnestness compelled me to consent. Now, as this printing begins, I preface these annotations with a few words to explain their origin.\n\nWinter of the tenth month, Guangxu decade\nRecorded by **Gǔ Dàn**, **Yuán Jí**, and **Huáng Zhāng** in self-preface.\n\n**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Mysteries**\n\nThe Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;\nThe Name that can be named is not the constant Name.\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\nThus, without desire, one observes its subtlety,\nWith desire, one perceives its openings.\nThese two, though born from the same source and bearing different names,\nAre both rooted in the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious again and again—\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nMaster Zhu [Zi] said: *\"The Dao/Way is like a path, which all people share.\"*\nIn truth, it is the principle that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things,\nHence it is called the Dao/Way.\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided,\nThis Dao/Way hung suspended in the boundless void;\nAfter Heaven and Earth were opened,\nThis Dao/Way was entrusted to the heavens and the earth.\nWhat Dao/Way is this?\nBefore Heaven and Earth, it endured eternally;\nAfter Heaven and Earth, it does not decay.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nMingled within the formless,\nNeither visible nor audible.\nThus, the Sage of Highest Virtue said:\n*\"To speak of the Dao/Way is to exhaust and obscure it—\nIn truth, there is nothing to speak of;\nWhat can be spoken of are but the Dao/Way’s manifestations,\nNot the constant Dao/Way itself.*\n*To name the Name is to empty and void it—\nIn truth, there is nothing to name;\nWhat can be named are but the Dao/Way’s dross,\nNot the constant Name itself.*\n\nIf people do not know the Dao/Way,\nHow can they read the *Book of Poetry* and say:\n*\"The Heavenly carriage moves without sound or scent\"*—\nThe Dao/Way cannot be confined by words!\nAnd again:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing\"*—\nThe Dao/Way cannot be without designation.\n\nOne must know that within the utmost void,\nThe utmost reality resides;\nWithin the utmost emptiness,\nThe utmost substance dwells.\nThe Dao/Way’s truth cannot be measured by what is spoken of.\n\nThe Sage of Highest Virtue, in compassion and mercy,\nBroadly expounded the teachings for the world:\n*\"Before the primordial chaos had yet taken form,\nIt was but a boundless, undifferentiated unity—\nThough called Nameless, all things under Heaven and Earth, humans and nature,\nAre nurtured within it.\nThis is why it is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen stillness endured long,\nThe movement of *qi* arose,\nThen came the Named,\nA vast and harmonious *qi* of the Great Unity,\nFlowing through the cosmos,\nNourishing all life.\nThis is why it is called the mother of all things.\n\nThe beginning is the undivided *qi* before Heaven and Earth opened;\nThe mother is the transformation giving birth to all things after their division.\nFor the student at the outset,\nThere is no other method—\nOnly to sit upright with a single mind,\nDiscard all thoughts,\nAnd observe with a veiled gaze.\n\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nThere seems a void, a hollow space.\nSpirit meets spirit, breath returns to its source,\nFollowing its ebb and flow,\nBut the focus must be on the convergence of spirit and *qi* in the central palace.\nIn no time, spirit and *qi* merge into one.\n\nThen, one listens to its boundless chaos,\nWithout stirring a single conscious thought.\nAfter long stillness, a faint, indistinct awareness arises,\nEntering the realm of the Unknowable.\nAt this moment,\nOne does not know whether spirit enters *qi* or *qi* returns to spirit—\nAll is indistinct, neither self nor other, neither here nor there,\nYet not dull or lifeless—\nIf it were dull and lifeless, it would be but a withered tree, dead ashes.\nThe cultivator, reaching this stage,\nShould extinguish the stirring mind,\nYet preserve the observing mind.\nOnly then does one attain wisdom as if foolish,\nAnd insight without application.\n\nIn the midst of ignorance and unconsciousness,\nA sudden awakening stirs—\nThis is the foundation of the *Tai Ji*.\nOne must know that this awakening,\nArising naturally and not through external influence,\nIs the true awareness of my original nature.\n\nThe Daoists call this the Mysterious Gateway,\nFound within the space of a single breath.\nWhen inhaling, it is yin, stillness, void;\nWhen exhaling, it is yang, movement, presence.\nEven this fleeting breath contains mystery.\n\nIf one seeks to cultivate true awakening,\nAt the moment of this awakening—\nA genuine, unshakable, thoughtless, and pure original person emerges.\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth awaken, giving birth to myriad things;\nHumans awaken, refining the Golden Elixir.\n\nBut this awakening is like a flash of lightning or a spark of stone fire—\nBefore one’s eyes, it is present;\nIn an instant, it vanishes—\nThe difference is but a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe scholar must discern it clearly in ordinary times,\nOnly then can they grasp it when the moment arrives.\nEven the ancient Great Awakened Ones,\nDid not attain otherwise than through this awakening’s accumulation.\n\nIf the cultivator begins their work\nWithout first mastering the stages of no-desire and desire,\nOf observing subtlety and perceiving openings,\nFrom where can they establish their foundation?\n\nThough no-desire and desire,\nSubtlety and openings,\nAre but yin-stillness and yang-movement—\nOne *qi* divided into two,\nTwo *qi*s still returning to one.\n\nWhen stillness endures and movement arises,\nThe void generates presence—\nThis is called *One Yang Emerges, the Child is Born*.\nWhen movement reaches its peak and stillness returns,\nPresence returns to void—\nThis is called *Restoring the Command, Returning to the Root*.\nBoth are but the yin and yang of the *Tai Ji*.\n\nThough they bear different names,\nThey spring from the same source—\nThe Sage of Highest Virtue calls this *One Mysterious*.\nThe Mysterious means profound and distant.\n\nThe scholar who seeks the Mysterious Dao/Way,\nMust still the mind again and again,\nAchieve steadiness once more—\nWithin, all is boundless and free,\nThis is observing subtlety without desire.\n\nThis is the first Mysterious.\nWhen the *qi* stirs,\nThough one knows,\nThey do not produce the perception of knowing;\nThough one moves,\nThey do not cling to the thought of movement.\nWith one mind,\nWithout dual thoughts—\nThis is perceiving openings with desire.\nThis is the second Mysterious.\n\nAs for the Mysterious again and again,\nIt is truly the realm of returning to the root—\nWhat else could it be but the gateway to all mysteries?\n\nWhat is regrettable is that ordinary people,\nThough possessing this mystery,\nDo not nurture it directly—\nThus it opens and closes in cycles,\nUntil it is exhausted without end.\n\nThe True Person, when the Mysterious Gateway opens,\nFixes it with a single glance,\nSeizes it with a single hand,\nCultivates and nurtures it—\nNever allowing it to stray for an instant,\nThus directly attaining the supreme primordial source,\nAnd achieving the Great Awakening as a Golden Immortal.\n\nThe initial practice lies within the single Mysterious Gateway.\nThe Supreme Chapter first distinguishes the Nameless as Named,\nAnd perceiving subtlety without desire, with desire.\nThis clearly shows the essence of cultivation—\nBeyond this single Mysterious Gateway,\nThere is nothing else to progress toward.\n\nThus the opening four lines speak of the Great Dao’s root,\nWhich is truly formless and boundless,\nUnthinkable and inexhaustible.\nOnly at the dawn of Heaven and Earth,\nWhen all was indistinct and chaotic,\nWithout any trace or clue,\nIs it akin to when a person steadies themselves in stillness.\n\nAt the moment of Heaven and Earth’s sudden manifestation,\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and motion begins,\nAwareness dawns and clarity awakens—\nThis is when a person detects *qi* in movement,\nThe very foundation for refining the elixir.\n\nWithin this mere blink of an eye,\nWithout the wisdom-pearl or insight-sword,\nOne cannot grasp it.\nEssentially, the moment thoughts arise,\nThe Mysterious *yin* (womb) emerges—\nThe very beginning of Heaven’s opening and Earth’s splitting.\n\nSince ancient times, all divine immortals\nHave been born from this moment of awakening motion.\nIt is also said:\nPerceiving subtlety without desire,\nPerceiving openings with desire—\nThese two, one still and one moving,\nMutually forming their roots,\nThus differing in name though arising from the same source.\n\nAll things with form and appearance\nCan be pondered, measured, and divined.\nBut this subtle opening—\nIt is without yet present,\nPresent yet without—\nCannot be named or described by any fixed standard.\n\nEven if the tongue flows like a suspended river,\nIt cannot utter a single word of it—\nThus it is called the *Dao/Way* of *Dao/Way*.\n\nLearners also do not regard it as distant and obscure,\nNor do they exhaustively seek its concrete reality.\nIf one truly finds this definite place,\nWhere others see it as vague and elusive,\nIn me, it is solidly grasped.\nWith prolonged practice, vitality springs forth—\nEvery moment is the Dao itself.\n\n**Chapter Two: Achieving Merit Yet Not Claiming It**\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen wickedness already arises.\n\nThus the presence and absence of forms generate,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLength and shortness define one another,\nHeight and low incline toward one another,\nSounds harmonize with one another,\nFront and back follow one another.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in affairs of non-doing,\nPractices teachings of no-speech,\nAll things arise yet they do not take credit,\nGive birth yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely—\nAchieving merit yet not claiming it;\nOnly by not claiming it,\nDoes it not depart.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"I urge you to exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body,\nReturning to the root and returning to the source is the Elixir King.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Exhaustively seek where your vital body receives its mandate,\nDo not blame Heaven’s *qi* for being fully revealed.\"*\n\nFrom this perspective, it is clear that at the very beginning of receiving one’s mandate,\nThe natural principles of Heaven are complete,\nWithout any flaw.\nThose who speak of beauty and ugliness,\nGoodness and deformity,\nAre all harming the Dao.\n\nWhat is the Great Dao’s nature?\nIn Confucianism, it is called *\"hidden and subtle\"*,\nWithin which lies the essence of unseen and unheard.\nIn Buddhism, it is called *\"that\"* (which is),\nWithin which lies the truth of neither good nor evil.\nIn Daoism, it is called *\"Mysterious Gateway\"*,\nWithin which lies the profound mystery of no-thought and no-contemplation.\n\nThe Great Dao’s root originates from here.\nOnce imagined or theorized,\nIt falls into the trap of duality;\nOnce discussed or deliberated,\nIt stumbles into the snare of words.\nThough immortals of old praised the Dao’s marvels,\nSaying it is beautiful and good,\nThey were all but dimly grasping its form—\nNot truly seeing its essence.\n\nFor when they say it is good,\nEvil already opposes it;\nWhen they say it is beautiful,\nDeformity already opposes it.\nMoreover, beauty exists here,\nYet ugliness also exists here;\nGoodness exists here,\nYet deformity also exists here.\nThis is doubtless the post-Heaven duality of *yin* and *yang*,\nWith their interplay of victory and defeat—\nNot the pre-Heaven unity of *qi*.\n\nThus the Supreme Chapter says:\n*\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen wickedness already arises.\"*\n\nIt is known that if one does not seek the emptiness of *qi* beyond extremes,\nBut merely speaks of beauty as beauty and goodness as goodness,\nThis is abandoning the root for the branches.\n\nThe Supreme Chapter specifically instructs beginners:\nAt the start of seated practice,\nOne must cast aside all entanglements,\nHold nothing in mind—\nOnly then, lowering the curtain and sealing the *fu* (mouth),\nObserving the elixir field in emptiness,\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,\nRegulating the breath and concentrating the spirit—\nThus, with prolonged effort,\nSpirit and *qi* merge into one cluster,\nInstantly entering the distant and obscure realm—\nThis is non-doing.\n\nWhen emptiness reaches its utmost,\nSuddenly, a single awareness stirs—\nThis is doing.\nFrom this single thought arising within the rule,\nContinuous yet indistinct,\nUnceasing yet surging—\nSpirit relies on *qi* to stand,\n*Qi* relies on spirit to move,\nWithout knowing yet knowing,\nWithout awareness yet aware—\nThe Gateway of the Mysterious *yin* (womb) is already established.\n\nFrom this point, one must diligently uphold the rule,\nConcentrating the spirit beyond form.\nWith each inhalation and exhalation,\nEach advance and retreat,\nOne must ensure *qi* returns to the Mysterious opening.\nBreathing naturally as Heaven dictates—\nThis is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,\nThe foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—\nThe most profound secret of our Daoist school,\nNot to be carelessly revealed.\n\nFor cultivators’ practice,\nRather than seeking the boundless and unattainable,\nWhy not seek the *yin* and *yang* with tangible proof?\n\nThe generation of presence and absence,\nIs but movement and stillness,\nStillness and movement,\nEmerging from the Mysterious and entering the *yin* (womb),\nHarmonizing the principles of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nDifficulty and ease completing each other,\nIs but firmness and yielding,\nYielding and firmness,\nThe cauldron, furnace, lute, and sword—\nOne simmers, one warms.\n\nLength and shortness defining one another,\nIs the inhalation and exhalation,\nThe advance and retreat of the *Task* (governor) and *Du* (conceptor) vessels—\nThe forward movement is short,\nThe backward movement is long.\n\nHeight and low inclining toward one another,\nIs fire above yet making it descend,\nWater below yet making it ascend—\nThe wondrous reversal of above and below,\nThe transformation of *kan* and *li* (water and fire).\n\nThe harmony of sounds and voices,\nIs the merging of spirit and the flow of *qi*,\nWith the hundred channels coursing freely—\nNot unlike the cry of a phoenix summoning its flock,\nOr the resonance of voices in unison,\nComing without being called.\n\nThe following and preceding in succession,\nIs the *Du* vessel descending at the rear,\nThe *Task* vessel ascending at the front—\n*Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) in union,\nA harmonious whole, clinging yet never parting.\n\nThese are all the return of *yin* and *yang* from the post-heaven realm\nTo the pre-heaven realm of *wuji* (non-extreme).\n\nThe sage understands the origin of the Dao/Way,\nVague and boundless, vast and traceable—\nIn their conduct, they esteem *wuwei* (non-action),\nAnd follow the manner of *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),\nWhereby they are revered without boast.\n\nIn their teaching, they uphold *buyan* (non-speech) as their principle,\nAnd illustrate the wondrous method of *guohua cunshen* (transcending transformation to preserve the spirit).\n\nThe sage acts, yet all things behold them—\nWhat difficulty could there be?\n\nEven in the tilling of fields and the digging of wells,\nThey are born to life yet forget their own practice;\nIn regulating the source and conserving the flow,\nThey diligently guide transformation yet conceal their own traces.\nThough their merit fills the heavens and earth,\nAnd their fame echoes across the land,\nThe sage regards it as shame—\nFor hollow titles are never matched with true accomplishment.\n\nHow could this be compared to the *Book of Documents* saying:\n*\"You alone do not boast, do not claim—*\n*None under heaven can contend with you in ability,*\n*None can contend with you in merit.\"*\nYet even this still harbors the thought of *miren zhangjing* (dispelling strife and competition)?\n\nThis is truly the realm of *shenhua* (spiritual transformation),\nThe *danding* (tranquil and settled) heaven,\nWhere one simply finds contentment in their own nature,\nAnd never forgets the true essence of self-realization.\n\nThe ancients spoke of viewing wealth and nobility as floating clouds,\nAnd discarding fame as worn-out footwear—\nWas this not their meaning?\n\nThough so, when the Dao is complete,\nVirtue/power establishes itself,\nAnd true attainment naturally brings renown.\n\nThe sage, though not dwelling on merit,\nIs praised by the world and posterity—\nTheir merit shines like the sun and moon,\nTheir fame weighs heavy in ancient and modern times.\nIt is only because they do not claim,\nThat it is never lost.\n\nStudents must cultivate from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nNurturing forth the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,\nOnly then can their cultivation be said to have genuine roots.\n\nWhat is this Dao/Way?\nThe *xuan guan* (mysterious aperture)!\n\nAbandon this, and there is no life.\nFor those who cultivate the Dao/Way,\nAbandoning this mysterious aperture,\nThere is no other Dao/Way.\n\nIf one takes beauty and virtue/power as the Dao/Way,\nIt belongs to the dust of post-heaven concerns.\nThe *Taoist Canon* warns of this,\nHoping people will trace the flow back to its source.\nOtherwise, the praise of beauty and virtue/power\nIs also for the gentlemen of the Three Dynasties—\nHow could one blame them too harshly?\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*\"One *yin* and one *yang*, this is called the Dao/Way.\"*\nThus *yang* is not the Dao/Way,\nAnd *yin* is also not the Dao/Way—\nThe Dao/Way lies between *yin* and *yang*!\n\nMoreover, the Dao/Way is principle,\nWhile *yin* and *yang* are *qi*.\nPrinciple without *qi* cannot manifest,\nAnd *qi* without principle cannot move.\nTo speak of the Dao/Way alone is formless and elusive—\nOnly when observing where *yin* and *yang* emerge,\nCan one truly grasp its foundation.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,\nDirectly piercing the root of the Great Dao/Way,\nUrging people to establish their foundation and extreme,\nAs the basis for cultivating the self and governing the world.\n\nThe phrases on presence and absence, ease and difficulty,\nTeach people to return from the duality of *yin* and *yang*\nTo the true unity of *qi*.\n\nWithin this, it also teaches people\nTo seek the mysterious aperture from the interplay of presence and absence,\nAs the fundamental root of alchemical refinement.\n\nAs for guarding the middle and nurturing the elixir,\nRevitalizing *yang* within the *Du* vessel,\nOperating the *heche* (river car),\nAll are progressively unraveled.\n\nOnly the sage points directly to its source,\nThus *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *wuwei* (non-action),\nSilent yet trusted—\nThough there be action and creation,\nIn themselves, there is no trace of virtue/power.\n\nWhen their work is complete and they retire,\nThey regard wealth and nobility as of no consequence—\nWho but the sage could attain this learning?\n\nStudents who ponder and gain insight,\nNot only have a basis for their practice,\nBut also a path to transcendence.\n\nOther commentaries say:\n*\"All under heaven know why beauty and virtue/power are beautiful and virtuous—*\n*Then they themselves will not be evil or unvirtuous.\"*\nThis explanation is also correct.\n\nBut the *Taoist Canon* often speaks from the source,\nWithout falling into the realm of the Two Vehicles.\n\n**Chapter Three** does not show what is desirable,\nDoes not exalt the worthy—\nSo the people do not contend;\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nSo the people do not become thieves;\nDoes not show what is desirable,\nSo the heart does not become disordered.\n\nThus the sage’s governance,\nEmpties the heart, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones,\nEver keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,\nSo that even the wise dare not act.\n\nTo do *wuwei* (non-action),\nIs to have nothing left ungoverned.\nThe sage’s governance of the world,\nRather than having action,\nIs to prefer non-action—\nEven more, to not knowingly act while non-acting.\n\nIn transforming the people and establishing customs,\nRather than being able to influence,\nIt is better to be able to transform—\nEven more, to let them rest in harmony with the natural state of no affairs.\n\nThus Yao and Shun, with *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),\nBrought the four quarters to reverence and moved them by their example—\nWhat profound method of transformation is this?\n\nIt is merely:\nThe ruler’s own emptiness brings the people stillness,\nThe ruler’s own lack of partiality brings the people rectitude,\nThe ruler’s own lack of desire brings the people stability.\n\nOtherwise, in their bustling and meddling,\nThey believe they are bringing benefit and removing harm to the people,\nYet they do not realize that their disturbance of the people is indeed great.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe people originally have no contention,\nYet the ruler contends and seizes;\nThe people originally have no greed,\nYet the ruler is greedy and covetous;\nThe people originally have no thoughts or desires,\nYet the ruler leads them with strange arts, seductive cunning,\nGay attire, and delicious food.\n\nCould one then make the people free from contention, greed,\nAnd all cravings and partialities?\n\nIf the ruler can cultivate their own self,\nRectify their own heart,\nAnd remain serene and detached,\nWith no involvement in any affairs,\nAnd does not exalt the worthy and able,\nThen the people naturally settle and are at peace, without contention;\nIf the ruler does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nThen the people value modesty and shame,\nAnd do not become thieves.\n\nMoreover, the fields of sound, color, wealth, and profit are varied—\nIf the eyes are without sight and without desire,\nAnd the ruler and the people each find contentment in their own natural state,\nThen the spirit, which is *xu ling huo po* (empty, responsive, fluid, and lively),\nNaturally remains ever responsive and ever still, without disorder.\n\n「Is this matter one that only the extraordinary can achieve? Only the Sage can close off the ears and eyes, sever all crooked and private inclinations, and embrace *One* to empty their heart. When the heart is empty, the foundation for refining the elixir is established. Thus, they gather the *Daoist* **Lingyang** (精陽, the refined yang-qi of heaven and earth) to transform the **Yinjing** (陰精, primordial yin-essence), day by day, month by month. Naturally, the yin-essence diminishes and the yang-qi flourishes, filling the belly so that the form is preserved—this is what is called \"concentrating the *Dao* to solidify the body, employing techniques to prolong life,\" the very method of transcending birth and escaping death. Furthermore, through focused *qi* to achieve softness, one is like an infant whose strength is weak and cannot grasp objects. Though supremely soft, when moved, it becomes firm. Observing its vast and profound nature, its towering and surging essence, it truly encompasses heaven and earth with abundance. All the senses of knowledge and the inclinations of craving—where do they retreat and dissolve? The Sage cultivates themselves with this.\n\nTo govern the world, they must first be without knowledge or desire—\nNot only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,\nBut even the clever and learned *Rujia* (儒, Confucian scholars),\nWho daily boast of their abilities and rely on their wisdom,\nFearful lest they fail to assert themselves,\nAt this point, having become serene and detached, their private thoughts of knowledge and cleverness\nAll merge into simplicity and purity.\nThis is the power to act yet not act—\nNot because they cannot, but because they dare not.\nNevertheless, humans cannot escape the *void* while alone transcending the material world;\nThey must follow the *Dao* of human relations and daily practice.\nYet how can they avoid action entirely?\nBut if they follow nature and act without contrivance,\nEven if they act, it remains as *non-action*—\nJust as Heaven speaks not yet transforms all things,\nAnd the seasons proclaim their teachings without words.\nThe Emperor governs without action, and the ministers administer the affairs.\nThe trace of action is in the *form* (迹), while the essence of non-action is in the *spirit* (神).\nThus, seated in state with hands clasped,\nThe whole realm rejoices in peace and harmony—\nAh, how magnificent!\n\nThe *Dao* is inherently plain and ordinary,\nNot seeking to display novelty or oddity,\nNor to exalt the strange and unusual.\nWhen a state honors the worthy and able,\nIt is indeed a good thing,\nBut if they boast and vie over this,\nThe truly worthy remain worthy,\nYet the unworthy will also feign virtue.\nEven worse, the worthy may condemn the unworthy as unworthy,\nWhile the unworthy condemn the worthy as unworthy—\nThus, contention arises.\nEach side mutually flaunts their merits,\nTaking turns to support factions,\nAnd from this, the world becomes embroiled in affairs.\nWhen a state manages finances,\nIt is also a common practice,\nBut if they prize rare goods and treasure distant commodities,\nThe people will climb mountains and cross seas,\nRisking peril and danger,\nUndeterred by the hardships of travel or the fear for their lives,\nTo gather and present them to the court.\nWhen they fail to obtain these,\nThey resort to every scheme imaginable—\nEven thieves and brigands will not hesitate to seize them.\nAs for clothing and food,\nThese are also daily necessities,\nYet if one insists on delicacies and rare dishes,\nAnd seeks only fine silks and embroidered garments,\nSeeing what is desirable and desiring it—\nWhen will this extravagant trend be corrected?\n\nThus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,\nNecessarily nurturing the *heart* (神) with emptiness,\nAnd filling the belly to nourish the *qi* (氣),\nSo that the *heart* and *qi* merge into one,\nFlowing harmoniously throughout the body—\nSmooth and integrated, soft and joyful,\nAnd the will becomes weak.\nMoreover, when the *heart* is still as a mountain,\nAnd the *qi* flows like a spring,\nThe bones grow strong.\nEver embracing *One* (抱一),\nAnd guarding the *Middle* (守中),\nNot only does one remain without desire or thought,\nBut even the clever and learned,\nFeeling the influence, are transformed within,\nDaring not to act arbitrarily.\nSome say, \"If one acts, it will lead to chaos and criticism;\nIf one does not act, it will invite ridicule for its purity.\"\nBetween action and non-action, the distinction is indeed subtle.\nYet to act in accordance with nature—\nThis is not reckless action;\nAction and non-action are equal in essence.\nThus, Confucius praised Shun (舜), saying:\n*\"Is it not Shun who governs without action?\"*\n**Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Common**\n\nThe *Dao* is boundless yet applied—\nSometimes it does not fill,\nProfound, like the source of all things.\nIt dulls the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nHarmonizes its brilliance,\nMerges with the dust.\nDeep and still, as if it existed—\nI know not whose child it is,\nResembling the Emperor before all beginnings.\nThe Emperor (帝) is the **Tian Di** (天帝, Heavenly Sovereign).\nThe *beginning* (先) is the beginningless beginning.\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nThe **Taihe** (太和, Great Harmony) of *One Qi* (一氣),\nFilling and permeating the heavens and earth,\nIts extent encompassing the universe,\nIts essence permeating past and present,\nIts *virtue/power* (德) reaching all nine regions and myriad lands.\nFrom the *taihuan* (胎卵, womb and egg) to the *shihua* (湿化, damp transformation),\nFrom the *feizhan* (飛潛, flying and burrowing) to the *dongzhi* (動植, moving and growing),\nNo place exists where it is not present.\nHow vast is the *Dao*?\nYet its substance is empty, void, and boundless—\nWithout form, yet overflowing.\nWhen it manifests and takes action,\nIt is vast and harmonious in its embrace,\nApplied here and there, yet always fitting.\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Left and right, left and right—\nThere is nothing it does not suit;\nLeft and right, left and right—\nThere is nothing it does not possess.\"*\nTruly like rivers converging at the sea,\nYet the sea does not appear to be full—\nIs it not indeed the fundamental principle of all things?\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"The virtue/power (德) of ghosts and spirits\nNourishes all things without remainder.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Speak of small matters without breaking them,\nSpeak of great matters without exhausting them.\"*\nIts vast and profound nature is truly inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Dao* is so difficult to describe—\nHow then shall later generations cultivate it?\nThe **Taishang** (太上, Supreme Sage) out of compassion for ordinary people,\nPoints to its essence, saying:\n*\"The reason ordinary people cannot enter the *Dao*\nIs that those with cleverness and wisdom,\nRelying on their own abilities,\nAct arbitrarily and haphazardly,\nThus, their minds become obstructed,\nAnd the empty, responsive essence is not seen.\nNow, to cultivate the *Dao*,\nOne must know that cleverness and wisdom\nAre all demons that obstruct the *Dao*.\nFrom this point onward,\nOne must abandon cleverness and lose wisdom,\nSet aside the private inclinations of the ears and eyes,\nAnd return all to the undifferentiated chaos—\nAll the sharpness of boasting in ability,\nRelying on wisdom,\nArrogance toward things,\nAnd domineering over people,\nMust be completely blunted and extinguished,\nSo that the human heart dies and the *Dao* heart is born,\nKnowledge vanishes and *wisdom* (慧) shines forth.»\n\nThe sages of old said: *\"Those with cleverness and wisdom are not to be feared,\nBut those who sink deeply into the *Dao*, purify the heart, and observe its principles—these are truly to be feared.\nIs this not the truth?*\n\nThe practitioner must take as primary\nSettling the spirit, refining thoughts,\nReducing desires, and clearing the heart.\nYet how can one know?\nThe spirit of perception, thought, and deliberation—\nThe turbulent, false, and impure thoughts—\nSwirl and disturb in ceaseless flux:\nThis thought not yet stilled, another arises;\nThis reflection not yet extinguished, another follows.\nI must exhort and encourage myself,\nGrant myself patience and release—\nAs tangled silk, I must trace its threads and unravel it;\nAs overgrown vines, I must uproot them and clear the ground.\nThus, all confusion dissolves,\nAnd the *Heavenly Sovereign* remains ever serene.\n\nYet this is but the practice of solitary stillness,\nStill not reaching the clamor of the world.\nIf one can be still but not move with the world,\nIt remains a rootless study.\nOne must examine oneself in stillness,\nBut when entering bustling scenes,\nOne must be all the more vigilant and cautious!\nIn all things, yield precedence to others,\nPlace yourself behind them,\nHold others above you,\nAnd willingly submit below them.\nThus, there will be no conflict with the world,\nNo strife with others.\n\nMoreover, men delight in the like and reject the unlike—\nThis is the common nature of the world.\nI must only follow the currents, conform to their kind,\nAnd harmonize with them.\nThough I possess a luminous and upright heart,\nI will not display its sharp edges.\nI must only silently recognize their ways,\nSubtly uphold their form,\nFavor those who align with me,\nAnd tolerate those who do not.\nThus, the people of Lu hunted hares,\nYet Confucius also hunted hares.\nIn ancient times, when the *Dao* was not yet illuminated,\nThe sages all mixed with the vulgar thus.\n\nAgain, observe the Sixth Patriarch:\nThough his *Dao*-fruit was complete after receiving the robe and bowl,\nIts subtlety was not yet exhausted.\nThus, he remained in the world, dwelling in Four Assemblies Mountain,\nLiving among hunters, unperturbed by their ways,\nAnd so escaped harm.\nHad he not blended with the dust and followed the light,\nHow could he have long preserved his life?\n\nThrough such dynamic and static cultivation,\nEver adapting with skill,\nThe originally pure, still, and luminous essence\nNaturally remains embraced—\nYet it is not a fixed attainment:\nIf it seems to be somewhere, to be stored,\nIt is not truly stored.\nA single radiant light flickers beneath the golden court.\nWhat *Dao* is this?\n\nIt arises before Heaven and Earth,\nMingles within the void.\nI do not know from whence it comes,\nNor to where it goes—\nWhose child is it, truly?\nThe *Classic* says: *\"There is a thing, mixed and complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\"*\nIs this not the profound mystery of the *Dao*?\n\nWhat form did the *Emperor* have before?\nIt was nothing but the undifferentiated chaos,\nThe indistinct *Hun-Meng*,\nA single breath of empty clarity.\nWhen the One Principle gave rise to myriad transformations,\nAnd all things returned to spring,\nThe *Dao* dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—\nYet it remains beyond measure.\nThe cultivator who seeks to illuminate the *Dao*-body\nMust observe the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of opening,\nWhen the unopened suddenly opens,\nAnd thus discern the source of the *Dao*—\nThen the foundation for practice will not lack.\n\nThe *Most High* outlines the *Dao*-body for all to see,\nAnd teaches those who cultivate the Great *Dao*\nTo first recognize the *Dao*-source.\nTo seek the *Dao*-source,\nOne must first, within one’s own heart-nature,\nEliminate deceit and preserve sincerity,\nAnd through gradual study,\nEventually reach the realm of spiritual transformation,\nOnly then knowing that within one’s heart-nature\nLies the essence of the *Dao*,\nEver present, never leaving one’s embrace.\n\nOne must seek its beginnings in stillness,\nUsing cultivation, reflection, and preservation\nTo safeguard the original purity,\nNot overwhelming others with arrogance,\nNor confusing the mind with excess.\nThis is what Zhangzi called *\"liberation from private desires.\"*\n\nParting the clouds to reveal the blue sky,\nSevering the vines to expose the true face—\nWhen one moves among people,\nOne must not conceal one’s light while displaying it,\nNor blend with the dust while remaining in it.\nSome may flaunt their cleverness and wisdom,\nOthers their abilities,\nOr perhaps assume the guise of a recluse in mist and stone,\nDisplaying an air of lofty detachment.\nObserving history, many have invited disaster and calamity\nThrough such harm to the *Dao*.\n\nLike the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of Confucius,\nOr the *Qingliu* disasters of the Jin—\nThough rooted in the treachery of petty men,\nIt was also because they did not know the *Dao* of preserving life through wisdom.\n\nIf one blends with the world, follows the light,\nAnd mingles with the dust like the *lingzhi* among common grasses,\nOr the phoenix flying with ordinary birds—\nUnheard yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—\nThus hiding one’s talents,\nThus nurturing oneself directly,\nThen the still and ever-present *Dao*\nWill hover between the eyebrows,\nExisting yet not existing,\nHaving form yet none.\n\nAs the *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The carriage of Heaven moves without sound or scent.\"*\nWhat else could be before the *Emperor*?\n\n**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Guard the Center**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind;\nThey treat all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage is not kind;\nHe treats the people as sacrificial dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet not collapsing,\nMoving yet ever producing more.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nBetter to guard the center.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nThe ceaseless generation and transformation,\nThe unrestrained motion—\nAll depend on this original *qi*,\nSustaining all between them.\nIt props up Heaven above,\nSupports Earth below,\nAnd flows through all beings,\nExcluding none.\n\nWhen this *qi* is undifferentiated and boundless,\nIt governs all things in orderly harmony—this is *principle*.\nWhen it is vast and pervasive,\nEncompassing all things,\nFlowing and turning freely—this is *qi*.\nThe unity of *principle* and *qi* is *virtue*.\n\nThus, the sages of old said:\n*\"The virtuous one, with all human desires exhausted,\nAllows Heaven’s *principle* to flow freely,\nWithout a trace of artificiality.\"*\n\n「”Further, it says: *“Generating and transforming is called *Dao/Way* (仁).”* In essence, *Dao/Way* (仁) is like the *Dao/Way* (仁) inherent in wood: its generative *principle* (理) and generative *qi* (气) are fully complete without exception.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, all things are born; the sages nourish all people—none of this is without the *principle* (理) and *qi* (气) permeating through it. How could it be so trifling as to be seen merely in outward actions?\n\nThus, the *Taoist Master* (太上) spoke to clarify the *Dao/Way* (道):\n*\"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi* (生气), relying only on the teachings of the four seasons and the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—\nmerely passing through cycles of movement—\nthen all things would lack any foundation to draw upon.\nHow would *qi* be received?\nHow would form be established?\nIn their view, all things would be as light as straw dogs (刍狗),\nutterly unworthy of regard,\nand would only see their gradual decay.*\n\n*\"If the sages lacked this true primordial essence (真元心体), depending solely on ministers, officials, and the promulgation of decrees, laws, and regulations\nto instruct the common people,\nthen the rural masses would have no way to observe or be moved,\nand how would people be transformed?\nHow would households prosper?\nIt would be as if the sages regarded these people as lowly as straw dogs (刍狗),\ncompletely indifferent to their well-being,\nand would only see their ruin and destruction.*\n\n*\"Yet why does Heaven and Earth, though lacking conscious intent (无心),\nencompass all things—wind, cloud, rain, and dew—\nwithout a single being excluded?\nAnd why do the sages, though silent in speech (忘言),\nassist and perfect all beings,\nso that none fail to thrive within the world?\nThis clearly shows that Heaven, Earth, and the sages\nall rely on this original generative *qi* (一元真气),\npermeating and nourishing beings and things—\nthough there may be deprivation,\nthere is also creation;\nthough there may be coercive power (刑威),\nthere is also virtuous transformation (德化).\nThis so-called ‘lack of *Dao/Way* (仁)’ is precisely the ultimate expression of Heaven, Earth, and the sages’ *Dao/Way* (仁).*\n\n*\"If people do not know the *Dao/Way* (圣),\nlet them observe Heaven and Earth:\nThe upper *qi* (上浮) solidifies as Heaven,\nthe lower *qi* (下凝) condenses as Earth.\nBetween them, it is hollow yet luminous (空洞了明),\nboundless and without obstruction (浑浩流转),\nas vast as the unfathomable belly of a gourd (橐), yet freely communicating (龠之相通).\nWhen it is empty and contains nothing (虚而无物),\nit naturally follows the *qi*'s rise and fall (随气机之升沉),\nunbent and unyielding (不挠不屈).\nWhen it moves and becomes sound (动而为声),\nit also listens to the transformations of beings and things (听人物之变化),\never producing more that is strange and marvelous (愈出愈奇).\nObserving Heaven and Earth,\nit is no different from the gourd and its hollow (橐龠).\nThe sages are surely no different either.*\n\n*\"The scholar who guards the center (守中) and embraces the One (抱一),\nboundless and without trace (空空无迹),\nvast and without end (浩浩无垠),\nthe deeper the concealment (藏之愈深),\nthe broader the manifestation (发之愈溥).\nCompared to those who fill halls with words (言堂满堂) or rooms with speech (言室满室),\nthe difference is as vast as Heaven and Earth (相隔不啻天渊).\nThose who rely on words to set teachings (以言设教)\nand exhaust their teachings through words (以教有尽),\nhow can they compare to those who treasure their vital essence (宝吾之精),\nnourish their generative *qi* (裕吾之气),\nand wander spiritually beyond form (神游象外),\nwhile their *qi* permeates the rules of the world (气注规中),\nensuring nothing is left untransformed?\nTruly great is the study of guarding the center (守中之学),\nthe essential path for cultivating the self (修身之要道).*\n\n*\"This is the original generative *qi* (一元真气).\nCultivating the self lies here,\ngoverning the world also lies here.\nBeyond this, so-called institutions and laws (制度法则)\nare like traps and snares (筌蹄) for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔).\nFish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained,\nyet saying that one cannot catch fish and rabbits without them is wrong,\nand saying that traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is also wrong.*\n\n*\"The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir (金丹大道) is like capturing Yang to supplement Yin (采阳补阴):\nthe forward path is short,\nthe backward path is long;\nthe small return of the Jade Nectar (玉液小还),\nthe great return of the Golden Nectar (金液大还)—\nall are methods for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔之筌蹄).\nIf one regards them as the source of the Dao (道源),\none errs by a hair’s breadth and strays a thousand miles.*\n\n*\"Only this original *qi* (元气) is without sound or scent (无声无臭),\nwithout form or shape (无象无形),\nthe shared generative *qi* of Heaven, Earth, and all beings.\nThe scholar who cultivates and refines must seek this single essence (一件丹头),\notherwise they will only burn and refine in vain (空烧空炼).\nOtherwise, refining essence (炼精),\nrefining *qi* (炼气),\nrefining spirit (炼神),\nrefining emptiness (炼虚)—\nall belong to studies without foundation (无本之学).\nPracticed from childhood,\nthey will still yield no results by old age (到老犹无成).*\n\n*\"The *Taoist Master* (太上) teaches people to focus on guarding the center (守中用功),\nwhile the key lies in the gourd’s hollow (消息在橐仑).\nThe learner must explore this themselves!\"*\n\n*\"The phrase ‘not *Dao/Way* (仁)’ in the chapter is merely rhetorical.\n**Chapter Six: The Immortal *Spirit* (谷神不死)**\nThe immortal *Spirit* (谷神) does not die—\nthis is called the Mysterious Mother (玄牝).\nThe Mysterious Mother’s gate—\nthis is called the root of Heaven and Earth (天地根).\nEndlessly present (绵绵若存),\nyet never exhausted in its use (用之不勤).*\n\n*\"The matter of cultivation and refinement (修炼一事)\narises only because humans have a body (自有身后),\nwhile their *qi* and nature are bound to the past (气质拘于前),\nand desires for things obstruct the future (物欲蔽于后)—\njust as gold and jade, though pure and flawless (精金良玉),\nonce plunged into filth (陷于污泥),\nlose their brilliance (金之精者不精),\nand their excellence (玉之良者不良).\nThus, to restore their original form (复原形),\none must not rely solely on washing away impurities (淘汰之力),\nbut also on the work of polishing and refining (琢磨之功),\nto return to their initial essence (还乎初质).*\n\n*\"The *Taoist Master* (太上) shows the starting point for practice:\n“‘The immortal *Spirit* (谷神) does not die.’*\nWhat is meant by *Spirit* (谷神)?\nMountain caves are called *gǔ* (谷), speaking of their emptiness (虚);\nVariation and unrestraint are called *shén* (神), speaking of their responsiveness (灵).\nNot dying (不死) means the unceasing clarity of awareness (惺惺不昧).\nIf one can nourish the body of emptiness and responsiveness (虚灵不昧之体)\nas the foundation for the elixir (丹头),\nthen cultivation and refinement will be effortless.*\n\n*\"Yet this is formless and shadowless (无形无影),\nungraspable and elusive (不可捉摸).\nOne must seek its traces in things that have sound and color (有声有色者).\nThe ancients said:\n“‘To make the *Spirit* (谷神) of the *gǔ* (谷) endure without dying,\none must establish the foundation in the Mysterious Mother (玄牝).’*\nWhy is it called ‘Mysterious’ (玄)?\nMysterious (玄) is Heaven (天).\nWhy is it called ‘Mother’ (牝)?\nMother (牝) is Earth (地).\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite (合),\nthe Mysterious Mother emerges (玄牝出),\nand from the Mysterious Mother,\nthe opening and closing of all things is formed (阖辟成).\nBetween them, one ascends and one descends (一上一下),\none goes forth and one returns (一往一来),\ncycling endlessly within the hollow of emptiness (旋循于虚无窟子)—\nthis is the gate of the Mysterious Mother (玄牝之门).*\n\n*\"Confucius said, ‘The *Gāi* (乾) and *Kūn* (坤) are the gate of the *Yì* (易),’\nis this not true?\nThrough this gate (此门),\nthe path of Yin and Yang’s coming and going (阴阳往来之路) is traversed,\nthe realm of Heaven and Earth’s transformations (天地造化之乡) is realized,\nand the birthplace of beings and things (人物发生之地) is found.\nObtaining it means life;\nlosing it means death.*\n*If common people follow it conventionally (顺用之),\nthey become the path of death (死户);\nIf the sages invert and reverse it (颠倒之),\nthey become the gate of life (生门).*」\n\nAlchemists who seek to refine elixirs for eternal life and enduring vision must pass through this **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**—there is no other path.\n\nWhat else could be the root of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen the cultivator draws the curtain to observe and reflect, in the state of undifferentiated ignorance, the common heart dies.\nSuddenly awakened and stirred, the Dao-heart is born.\nThis is called: stillness as **Original Spirit**, movement as **True Intention**.\n\nWithin this, when the prenatal breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the **dantian**;\nrather, in the space neither inside nor outside, observe its rising and falling, its coming and going—\neffortless, lively, and unrestrained—\nand thus the true prenatal breath is attained.\n\nThe ancients said, *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Mother”*—\nthis exit is not one’s original face,\nthis entry is not one’s original face either.\nOnly in this space of exit and entry lies the subtle truth,\nwhich is **emptiness and responsiveness**.\n\nThis is the **True Yin** and **True Yang**,\nmanifesting as the **True One Qi**.\n\nIs there anything beyond this as the root of Heaven and Earth?\n\nKnow that the **Valley Spirit** is the principle of the **Supreme Ultimate**;\nthe **Mysterious Mother** is the **Yin-Yang qi**.\n\nIn the **pre-heaven**, principle and qi were originally one;\nin the **post-heaven**, principle and qi cannot be spoken of together.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must seek this subtle orifice—\nthey must not be hasty in their intent,\nnor negligent in their awareness.\nOnly by relying on the empty **Mysterious Mother**,\nnurturing the **Valley Spirit** of emptiness and responsiveness,\nneither clinging nor rejecting,\nforgetting yet not assisting,\ncan it be attained.\n\nThus it is said:\n*“Continuous as if it exists,\nyet used without strain.”*\n\nThe **Great Dao** is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth.\nThe **Great Dao** is nameless, nourishing all things.\nThe Sage, though having substance, appears formless;\nthough real, appears empty—\nrevealing this most hidden, most subtle essence as the **Valley Spirit**.\n\nThe **Valley Spirit** is the spirit of the empty valley—\nwhen questioned, it responds as if answering;\nwhen called, it echoes as if replying—\nthis is immortality.\n\nIn the human body, it is the unified **emptiness and responsiveness** of true clarity.\nSince humans lost their innate virtue, the **Valley Spirit** has long been submerged!\n\nLater cultivators, seeking the **Valley Spirit** to remain eternal,\nthe **emptiness and responsiveness** to be unobscured,\nas the foundation of the Golden Elixir and the root of the Dao,\nmust revolve in the void without grasping—\nonly by observing the **subtle orifice** through **non-desire and desire**,\nwhen the **having and non-having** align,\nwhen the **subtle orifice** fully opens,\ndoes the **Mysterious Mother** stand revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\n*“This orifice is no ordinary orifice,\nHeaven and Earth together form it.\nCalled the **Divine Qi Hole**,\nwithin it lies the **Kān-Lǐ essence**.”*\n\nOnly when **essence, qi, and spirit** are fused as one\ndoes it become the **orifice of having and non-having**,\nthe **gate of life and death**;\notherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice,\nwith no **True One Qi** dwelling within—\nif empty, it falls into coarse vacuity;\nif solid, it is bound by form—\nneither is the body of **emptiness and responsiveness**.\n\nOnly this **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**—\nneither empty nor solid,\nboth empty and solid—\nholds an ineffable truth:\nstill, it is formless;\nmoving, it takes shape.\nStillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth,\nmovement is not the origin of beings—\nonly at the juncture of stillness and movement\nlies the **Kān-Lǐ inversion**,\nthe realm where **sun and moon intersect**—\ntruly the **Heavenly Root and Earthly Cavern**.\n\nWhen the student attains the **True Mysterious** and **True Mother**,\neach ascent and descent—\nthe qi within this space,\ncondensed as **nature**,\nemanating as **emotion**—\nfrom the **extreme emptiness and profound stillness**,\nthe **Law-forms** arise.\n\nKnowing this orifice,\nthe Dao of immortality is exhausted here.\n\nWhen it says *“Continuous as if it exists”*,\nit means nourishment must be sustained long,\nbefore the prenatal breath can stir.\nWhen it says *“Used without strain”*,\nit means extraction and supplementation must be timed,\nso the **sympathetic fire** is neither recklessly added nor diminished.\n\nIf one follows the **natural Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\nthe Golden Elixir will be obtained.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Persists**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and persist\nis that they do not **self-generate**—\nthus they attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nsets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\nIs this not because he is without selfishness?\nOnly because he is without selfishness\ncan he fulfill his selfishness.\n\nThe **qi** of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly,\nenduring countless eons without exhaustion,\nall because the **True One Sovereign** silently governs within—\nthis is why Heaven and Earth endure without limit.\n\nEven as they give birth and nourish all things,\nendlessly sustaining life,\nHeaven and Earth are never depleted—\nthis is why the **mechanism of qi** remains unbroken through the ages.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** said, *“Heaven endures, Earth persists”*—\nis this not true?\n\nYet why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?\nBecause they do not **self-generate**.\nIf they had a **self-generating** intent,\nHeaven and Earth would have emotions,\nand Heaven too would age.\n\nOnly by not possessing their own life,\nand instead taking all beings as their life,\ndoes the unceasing generation of all beings\nbecome the unceasing generation of Heaven and Earth—\nthus, **eternal life**.\n\nMost people are ignorant of this principle of generation:\nthey do not seek life but seek death,\ndo not seek eternal life but seek swift death.\nThey drown in wealth, honor, fame, and power;\nthey sink in sounds, colors, goods, and profits.\nThey constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—\nin just a few years, their essence is exhausted,\ntheir qi weakened,\ntheir spirit and vitality scattered—\nthey toil through countless hardships,\nyet barely enjoy one lifetime.\nPursuing life only to court death—\nhow can this be lamented enough!\n\nThus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth:\nhe does not chase after the world’s gains,\nnor does he greedily seek techniques for prolonging life.\nOnly the **Great Dao** comes first—\nhe clears his mind’s field,\nrefines his **command root**,\nand in all matters of nourishing the body,\nhe never has time to scheme—\nas if he places his body last,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIn the end, his **virtue** is established,\nand none surpass him among his kind;\nhis **name** is fulfilled,\nand later generations still revere his model.\n\nThe Sage does not place his body last yet preserves it first,\nnor does he neglect his body yet sustains it—\nhow far above the world’s selfish who destroy their own lives!\nYet the Sage is not one who feigns emotion or acts out of eccentricity;\nfrom ancient times, he has loved simplicity and clarity,\nmaintaining purity of heart, never floating with the vulgar,\nnor relying on form to establish himself—\nunbounded and impartial, like Heaven and Earth’s boundless generosity.\n\nMortals are deeply self-absorbed, their hearts burdened with cares,\nwhile the Sage holds no private attachments—\nhis luminous essence transcends all things.\nA single expanse of empty clarity, a hollow yet radiant spirit,\nconstantly shining yet never dimmed.\n\nIf one were to obsess over this mortal coil—\nthis fleshly vessel, this stinking sack—\nconstantly fretting day and night,\nhow could one ever be first yet not last,\nor endure yet perish?\n\nOnly through selflessness does one align with Heaven and Earth,\nharmonize with the sun and moon,\nand thus fulfill one’s true purpose.\n\nLater cultivators who seek an immortal body and unbroken spirit,\nthough they refine with relentless austerity,\nshaking off filth and enduring prolonged tempering,\nnaturally attain a realm beyond the mundane—\na world apart from the world’s rise and fall—\nwhat greater joy is there?\n\nHeaven and Earth speak not, yet their primal *qi* circulates endlessly,\nso life’s cycle renews without ceasing.\nThus Heaven and Earth endure eternally, ever fresh through the ages.\n\nThe Sage harmonizes with Heaven and Earth,\nnurturing the *qi* of Great Unity,\nreturning to the primal undifferentiated truth.\n\nAt rest, his virtue stands firm—\nin action, his conduct is royal.\nWhat of those who speak of self-cultivation yet only seek secluded mountains,\nor of rulers who exhaust themselves in schemes?\nThese cling to extremes, each serving their own narrow ends—\nsome empty and detached, others frenzied and grasping.\n\nThe Sage in adversity remains pure and unstained,\nhis true form as enduring as mountains and rivers;\nin prosperity, he benefits all beings,\nhis transient body and noble rank alike light as feathers.\n\nWhen his name echoes through the cosmos,\nhis body transcends time—\nhis deeds cover the world,\nhis presence lingers beyond his age—\nis this not the power of selflessness?\n\nThe scholar who discards all attachments,\nempties all forms,\nand forever severs worldly roots—\nif his virtue accumulates, he abides in the mortal realm;\nif he ascends, he endures in the celestial expanse.\nTo forsake self-interest yet attain longevity—\nhow vast the difference from those bound by worldly calculations!\n\nCan one truly sever external temptations?\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Virtue is Like Water**\n\nThe supreme virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend—\nit dwells where others disdain,\nand thus approaches the Dao.\n\nIt rests in the lowest places,\nits heart is deep,\nits words are trustworthy,\nits governance is effective,\nits actions are skillful,\nits movements are timely.\n\nOnly because it does not contend\ndoes it incur no blame.\n\nThe Great Dao has no other mystery—\nonly the unification of spirit and *qi*,\nreturning to the boundless *Tai Ji*,\nthe single point of primal *qi* from which parents sprang.\n\nIf one does not attend to the Dao,\nspirit and *qi* separate—\nlead scatters, mercury flees—\nthus water and fire become divided.\n\nMencius said: *\"Without water and fire, people cannot live.\"*\nThis saying, shallowly interpreted, refers to daily needs;\ndeeply understood, it is the key to cultivation.\n\nSometimes fire warms water and true *yang* manifests;\nsometimes water nourishes fire and sweet dew arises.\nThe marvels of water and fire—\ntruly beyond words.\n\nYet water and fire share the same essence;\nspeak of water, and fire is known.\n\nWater’s nature is yielding—\nthe Dao values humility.\n\nThus the Sage of supreme virtue,\nheart serene and *qi* balanced,\nwith gentle intent,\nallows all things to flourish naturally—\nnone escape his beneficence.\n\nUltimately, his deeds cover the world yet he knows no merit,\nhis actions fill the cosmos yet he claims no credit.\nOnly by following Heaven and Earth’s natural order,\nfulfilling all things’ true nature,\ndoes he remain unopposed—\ntruly like water, benefiting all without contention.\n\nNot only this—\nall things prefer clarity to turbidity,\nelevation to lowliness.\nYet water cleanses others while dwelling in filth,\nelevates others while humbling itself.\nOh water, water—\nhow perfectly you embody the Dao!\n\nThe Sage’s nature aligns with water’s—\ngentle, not rigid,\nhumble in self-cultivation.\nWhat others cannot endure,\nthe Sage accepts as natural;\nwhat others most abhor,\nthe Sage treats as ordinary.\nThus he harbors no ill will toward himself,\nnor contends with others.\nOnly the Sage of the Dao can do this.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Dwelling where others disdain—\nthis approaches the Dao.\"*\n\nThe Dao’s blessings upon oneself\nare received in one’s proper place—\nnowhere is it not advantageous.\nEven in poverty or wealth,\ngain or loss,\ncalamity or death—\nwhat mortals cannot bear,\nthe Sage regards with equanimity.\n\nThe gentleman discusses principles, not *qi*;\nspeaks of nature, not fate—\nonly reflecting inward to cultivate virtue.\n\nYet virtue arises from a single source,\nthough its paths vary—\nhow could it drift without foundation,\nboundless yet without end?\nThere must be a place of ultimate goodness,\nwhere one rests without straying,\nonly then can one grow silently,\nnurturing true nature daily,\nwhile worldly desires fade.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"His back is firm yet he does not grasp his body,\nhe walks in the courtyard yet sees no one\"—\nthis is the Sage’s dwelling in the lowest place.\n\nWhen dwelling is secure,\nits resources are profound.\nGazing inward at the heart—\nempty, containing nothing,\ndeep as the depths—\noh, how profound!\n\nThe Sage examines outward encounters,\nchoosing worthy companions—\ntruly, how profound his virtue!\n\nWhen it comes to words,\na thousand gold pieces cannot match a single promise,\nfor *\"speech must be true to virtue\"* (i.e., *\"faithful and good\"*).\n\nIn governance,\ngreat benevolence is as nothing compared to great virtue—\n*\"virtue governs well\"* (i.e., *\"governance is true to virtue\"*).\n\nExtending this to all things—\nobjects, deeds, actions, or stillness—\nevery aspect aligns with the Dao.\n\nAssigning tasks to others,\nhe only hopes they do not fail in their abilities.\n\nConsidering actions with care,\nhe seeks only that they occur at the proper time.\n\nThus does the Sage cultivate himself and govern the world.\n\nThis arises from *\"resting in ultimate goodness,\"*\nfinding his place of security,\nand then all his actions are measured and harmonious.\n\nFor in every moment and place,\nthere is no flaw, no deficiency—\nwhat need is there for strife?\n\nOnly when one does not contend,\ndoes humanity respond with gratitude and reverence,\nengraved upon the bones and etched in the heart—\nthen one attains *\"loyalty without ambition\"* (i.e., *\"true devotion without ulterior motives\"*),\nand what grievance could there be?\nWhat blame could there be?\n\nEven if there are wicked men,\nthey too are transformed into goodness.\n\nWhen one reaches this pinnacle,\neffortless and natural,\nall are at ease in the *\"unaware and unknown\"* (i.e., *\"the boundless, primordial state\"*),\nnearly forgetting the *\"water-like goodness\"* (i.e., *\"the natural, unassuming virtue\"*),\nsoft yet resolute, beneficent without fail.\n\nPointing to the heart of ultimate goodness—\never ordinary, without preference or aversion,\nboundless and without obstruction,\nperfectly harmonious and yielding—\n\nThus, in high station he is not arrogant,\nin lowly place he does not falter;\ntoward himself he finds no fault,\ntoward others he bears no grudge.\n\nYet how does one attain this state?\nIt is not through the learning of the vulgar world,\nnor by the hollow studies of those without foundation.\n\nHence, the highest Sage dwells\nbehind what the crowd abhors,\nthen reveals a place of goodness.\n\nWhat is this place?\nIt is the *\"inner depths of the heart\"*—\nan inch of sincerity is an inch of ground.\n\nTo find this place is to have a foundation for life and vitality;\nto lose it is to be without master of spirit and *qi*.\n\nWithout mastery, there is confusion—\nhow could one harmonize all things,\nuniting inner and outer,\nacting in self and others without strife?\n\nYet if one says this place *exists*,\none risks falling into rigid attachment;\nif one says it *does not exist*,\none stumbles into dull emptiness.\n\nThis is the *\"neither existence nor nonexistence\"* (i.e., *\"the transcendent, ungraspable state\"*),\nunbound by action or stillness.\n\nTo cultivate the ultimate Dao,\none must carefully ponder its essence—\naccumulate abundant *yin* merit,\nnurture wide-ranging virtue,\nand thus ascend toward divine harmony,\neither through a teacher’s guidance,\nor through sudden enlightenment,\nto attain this place,\nlest one stray into false paths and left-handed doctrines,\nand fulfill one’s lifelong aspirations.\n\nThis place understood,\nthe Dao is half attained.\n\nWhat follows—words of *\"heart\"* and *\"speech\"*—\nilluminates that in every moment and place,\none must examine and align with ultimate goodness,\nlest one dwell without first securing it.\n\nAll that is said thereafter,\nnothing can surpass goodness—\nthis is the true essence of learning,\nthe foundation of practice.\nIf one neglects this,\nholding oneself and engaging with others,\nall matters will crumble.\n\nI have briefly revealed this,\nhoping those in the world with resolve\nwill not rely on their talents and intellect,\narrogantly guessing and presuming,\nwhile failing to cultivate virtue and turn back the heavens;\nonly with a humble heart may one seek the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Accomplishment and Withdrawal**\n\n*\"Filled and overflowing, it is not as good as stopping in time.\"*\n*\"Sharpened and kept keen, it cannot be long preserved.\"*\n*\"Gold and jade fill the halls, yet none can guard them.\"*\n*\"Rich and noble yet proud, one invites calamity upon oneself.\"*\n\nWhen accomplishment is achieved and name secured,\none must withdraw—\nthe Dao of Heaven.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"To cross the river, use a raft;\nhaving reached the shore, no need for the boat.\"*\n\nAgain they said:\n*\"Before attaining merit, one must study the Way;\nwhen merit is attained, one must forget the Way.\"*\n\nThese few words are indeed the most vital for cultivating the Dao.\n\nIf one practices the Dao and fulfills its work,\nhaving already entered the realm of profound and vast attainment,\nyet still clings and boasts—\n*\"My learning is refined, my cultivation pure\"*—\none cannot avoid the rise of arrogance and agitation,\neither falling into withdrawal or contradiction.\n\nIf such is the case,\nhow could the Dao endure?\nHow could virtue exist?\n\nThus the **Tàishàng** says:\n*\"Hold and fill it to the brim—\nit is better to stop before that.\nSharpen it to a point—\nit cannot be long preserved.\"*\n\nWhen the practitioner’s refinement is yet insufficient,\none must undergo countless purifications and selections,\nwashing out a single point of utmost purity\nto serve as the foundation for longevity.\n\nIf one obtains **True Yang**,\nboiling it at dawn and refining it at dusk,\nthe **preheaven essence** fills the body inside and out—\nthen the body stands firm as a thousand-foot wall,\nthe mind serene as autumn moon over still water.\n\nWhen the **external kidney** shrinks like that of a child,\nthe state of **leak-proof, all-pervasive attainment** is achieved.\n\nAt this time, when essence is full within the body,\none must not further apply the **fire talisman**—\ninstead, one should cease all fire-working,\nand in **non-knowing, non-awareness**,\nbecome **muddle-headed and indistinct**,\ncompletely forgetting the state of fullness as attainment.\n\nIf one persists in holding to fullness,\none risks the peril of **elixir collapse and cauldron overturn**—\nbetter to stop early than to press on.\n\nWhen **qi** is yet insufficient,\none must undergo countless firings and refinings,\nstirring the **civilized and martial divine fires**,\nto forge the **preheaven one-element true qi** as the basis for longevity.\nWhen all **profane qi** is exhausted,\nit transforms into a single piece of **pure yang**—\nmost vast, most potent—\npenetrating the body’s sinews and bones,\nnimble as a dragon, fierce as a tiger.\nWhat sharper refinement could there be?\n\nI must **concentrate qi to attain softness**,\nas a babe in its **innocent, unknowing** state—\nonly then can one long preserve the qi,\nreaching **perfection of form and spirit**, merging with the Dao and attaining **authentic truth**.\n\nIf one persists in sharpening without cease,\none risks the danger of **wildfire consuming all**—\nhow could such a state endure?\n\nThis is like **gold and jade filling a hall, yet none able to guard them**—\nor a wealthy noble family,\nindulging in extravagance, trampling morality,\nproud and domineering—\nlike the **Luan clan’s extinction** or the **Fan family’s ruin**,\nall because they failed to curb their excess,\nacting lawlessly until they invited their own ruin.\n\nThus, observing human affairs,\nthe **Heavenly Way** becomes clear.\n\nSee how in spring it is warm,\nyet by summer the **hot sun rules supreme**—\nno longer temperate.\nBy autumn it grows cool,\nand in winter the **cold dominates**—\nno trace of the western wind remains.\n\nWhen things are nurtured to completion,\ntheir season passes—\nHeaven and Earth withdraw and conceal,\npreserving the **harmonious virtue of yang**.\nIf winter were both cold and warm,\nor summer both hot and cool,\nthis would be **Heaven’s Way in reverse**—\nseasons out of order,\ncompletion without withdrawal—\njust the **perverse qi** that brings great harm to humankind.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When accomplishment is achieved and name secured,\none must withdraw—\nthe Dao of Heaven.\"*\n\nIf Heaven itself is thus,\nhow much more so for humankind?\n\nIn history, wise ministers of great achievement—\ntheir deeds resplendent, names renowned—\nyet failing to retreat into the mountains,\nlike **Wenzhong of Yue** or **Han Xin of Han**,\nmet with disaster—\nmany perishing, their families ruined.\n\nThus, those who study the Dao,\nwhen their essence is refined and qi is full,\nmust **forget the method, forget the form**,\nlest they ruin their own Way.\n\nBut those who have not yet reached this state—\nhow could they abandon method or form?\n\nThis teaching instructs those who cultivate the Great Dao:\n**drop one link, advance one link**—\nnever self-satisfied, lest **slothful and arrogant hearts arise**,\nand disaster strike before one turns.\n\nEven without the peril of **leakage**,\none risks **halfway abandonment**,\nunable to cross to the other shore\nand enter the realm of **spirit-transformation**.\n\nThe *Awakening to Truth* says:\n*\"Before refining the elixir, refine swiftly;\nafter refining, know when to stop.\nIf one clings to fullness without end,\none risks sudden ruin and disgrace.\"*\n\nIt is clear that the Dao has no end,\nand achievement no limit—\nwhat use is **pretended fullness**?\n\nMany ancient cultivators met with death or ruin,\nall because they failed to **conceal their light and nurture obscurity**,\nto **blend with the vulgar and follow the dust**.\n\nThe **Alchemical Canon** states:\n*\"Cultivate while blending with the vulgar,\nharmonize while keeping light hidden.\nRound when round, square when square—\nhidden or revealed, following others unrecognized,\nteaching people how to see **retreat and concealment**.\"*\n\nThus, the **true adept** must hide deeply,\nadjusting with the times—\nonly then can one **not differ, not oppose**,\n**neither good nor evil**,\nlong preserving one’s life.\n\nOtherwise, **virtue cultivated invites slander**,\n**high Dao invites calumny**—\nthough this may stem from others’ malice,\nit is also self-inflicted by **excessive display**.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n*\"Hoard lazily and invite theft;\nadorn oneself and invite licentiousness.\"*\nTruly, self-inflicted.\n\nWhy should those who are self-satisfied expect otherwise?\n\nI wish later learners:\nBefore advancing, follow the method with discipline;\nwhen deeply attained, cease all fire-working—\nonly then may one avoid the peril of **self-immolation**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Ten: Concentrating Qi to Attain Softness**\n\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—\ncan one avoid separation?\nConcentrating qi to attain softness—\ncan one resemble an infant?\nPurifying and illuminating the mysterious—\ncan one avoid blemish?\nLoving the state, governing the people—\ncan one act without action?\nHeaven’s Gate opening and closing—\ncan one avoid passivity?\nBright and all-pervading—\ncan one avoid knowing?\nNurturing and preserving—\nnurturing without possession,\nacting without reliance,\nnourishing without domination—\nthis is called **mysterious virtue**.\"*\n\nThis chapter begins by speaking of the **method of refining essence into qi**.\nHaving obtained essence and qi within the body,\none must **unify heart and virtue**,\npreventing even momentary separation—\nfor separation scatters the **Three Treasures** of essence, qi, and spirit,\npreventing their reunion at the **ultimate extreme**,\nwhich serves as the foundation for elixir-refining.\n\nThus the **Tàishàng** says:\n*\"Carrying the vital essence and embracing unity—\ncan one avoid separation?\"*\n\n**Yíng** is blood.\nBlood is generated by the heart, **pò** stored by the heart—\nits light must illuminate the **elixir field**,\nthe heart unmoving,\nso that the **soul** may settle into the **spirit**,\nand the **moon** returns as **pure yin**.\nThis occurs when **heart-yang enters kidney-yin**,\nthe **divine fire** illuminating the **blood-water**—\nthough water is cold and metal frigid,\nthe **divine fire** boils and refines it,\nand it rises spontaneously,\nuncontrollably effervescent.\n\n「The **Perfect Adept** understands this **mysterious mother** as the root of heaven and earth. Thus, within each breath—one inhalation, one exhalation—when the subtle **yang** stirs, he fixes his gaze with one eye, grasps it with one hand, and directs a drop of his own **mercury** to meet it. With left rotation and right withdrawal, he draws it back to the **middle elixir field**, congealing it so that it does not scatter. Then, he carries the **soul** and returns, embraces **unity** and dwells within it, without pause. In this way, the **true yang** flourishes, and the **true qi** moves powerfully.\n\nFrom this, he operates the **River Vehicle**, igniting fire from the **empty perilous acupoint** and drawing it to the **tail end**. He strikes the **Ninefold Iron Drum**, mobilizing the **Three-Legged Golden Toad**, ascending it to the crown—all must be done with **one heart** focused, unerring and unceasing—until it reaches the **mud pellet**, where the **Muni’s treasure pearl** is obtained. If he does not then **nurture and temper** it for a moment, the **mud pellet’s yin essence** will not transform, and how could **lead and mercury** fuse harmoniously? How could it become **sweet dew divine water** to moisten the hundred **vessels** of the body?\n\nOnce the **mud pellet** is nurtured, he further guides it downward through the **lower ninefold palace** and into the **crimson palace**, which is the **retreat of yin at noon**. Yet when advancing the fire, he must take its **rigidity**, not the **virtue/power** of **pure health**—otherwise, the **true gold** cannot ascend. At the time of **yin’s retreat**, he must take its **gentleness**, not the **virtue/power** of compliance—otherwise, the **yang lead** remains scattered, unable to subdue the **mercury** into **elixir**. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one focus **qi** to achieve **gentleness** like a newborn infant?\"*\n\nIts meaning instructs that after **yin’s birth**, one must maintain a **one-hearted** clarity, allowing the **vital mechanisms** to descend naturally, as they are, as they are, without adding a single intention or exerting a single force. This is the **gentleness** of the **Kūn hexagram**, the **Way** of the **Noble Person**’s cultivation. When descending to the **palace** for nurturing, returning to the **earthen cauldron**, and sealing it firmly, one must only dwell in **serenity and tranquility**, blending and calming it. In a mere instant, the **qi** breathes as if nonexistent, and the **spirit’s mechanisms** seem extinguished—this is the attainment of **gentleness**.\n\nAfter nurturing for a while, the **spirit** and **qi** return to their roots, like a **fire seed** in the furnace, slowly congealing and refining. If one does not let it wander recklessly, the **true qi** will naturally flow and circulate throughout the body. With **one heart** at peace, the limbs become supple, as if the body of an infant—soft as cotton, delicate as silk—exhibiting a **gentleness** that cannot bear the weight of things. This is sufficient evidence that the **elixir** is congealing.\n\nFrom this point, **lead and mercury** merge, and **water and fire** are harmonized. One must then **purify the heart** and **cleanse the mind**, cultivating the **true lead** in solitude. If the mind wanders even slightly, the **elixir** will scatter wildly—it cannot be refined, nor will the **lead** from the **water realm** belong to you. The *Scripture of Purity* states:\n*\"The heart without its heart, things without their things.\nThe void lacks nothing to void, the none lacks nothing to none—\nserene and ever still,\nnaturally tranquil.\"*\n\nAnd what flaw could there be?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Can one purify and perceive the **mysterious** without flaw?\"*\n\nEven if the **external elixir** is obtained, if the **internal illumination** is not strict, then **human desires** remain uncleansed and **heavenly principle** impure. How could one attain a single **grain of barley**—**void** yet forming the **embryo**?\n\nWhen the **elixir** is present in the body, one must still **preserve essence** and **abundantly nourish qi**, to form the **sage’s womb**. Yet even so, **preserving essence** must follow **nature’s spontaneity**, and **nourishing qi** must align with **effortless ease**. This **non-preservation** surpasses preservation, and this **non-nourishment** surpasses nourishment. Otherwise, if one clings to **treasure** and **value**, harm is inevitable.\n\nThe **elixir** is the **primordial essence** of the **first heaven**, formless and without trace—why must it be made? If one seeks it through **manifestation**, one risks **stirring fire** in the **later heaven**, and the **Great Dao** of the **first heaven** will be lost. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one govern the people and rule the land without action?\"*\nThe people are likened to **essence**, the land to **qi**. The key to governing lies in **love** for the people. To establish laws and rule the land is but a minor relief for the **tyrant**—far from the **sage’s** effortless governance.\n\nThe **auspicious and harmonious** reigns, the **vital mechanisms** in contention—all lies between **action** and **non-action**. The **Way** of cultivating the body is to **stabilize essence** as the people’s security and **abundant qi** as the land’s prosperity. Refining oneself **stabilizes essence**, while **direct nourishment** fills **qi**. At its utmost, the **vast and mighty** **yang** overflows the two realms—yet even then, it is seen as an ordinary possession, a mundane practice. One does not boast of **capabilities**, nor does one flaunt **wisdom**. In **primordial unity**, one forgets to forget what is **full and complete**—**non-action** yet **great action** emerges.\n\nWhen the **student** reaches this stage—**essence overflowing**, **qi abundant**—if he nurtures it long enough, the **crown will naturally split open**, and he may ride the clouds, roam the islands, far surpassing those who formerly **strictly adhered** to **circular breathing** and **focused qi to achieve gentleness**. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one open and close the **heavenly gate** without **femininity**?\"*\nThis refers to the former days of **adjusting spirit** and **nurturing the womb**—one could not avoid **femininity**. But now, with the **yang spirit** fully robust, **detached from the mundane body**, it bursts through the **heavenly gate**, ascending toward the **celestial expanse**—truly a joy!\n\nHow could **qi** be so robust? At this point, the **heart** is like a **clear mirror**, the **nature** as **still water**—**clear as the sky**, **lively as the earth**. All **perceptions and cognitions** of the **spirit of knowledge** dissolve into the **void**, transforming into the **primordial spirit**. Formerly, one knew what came before and was aware of what followed; now, **illuminated and transparent**, one is **omniscient yet unobstructed**.\n\nYet **ever-serene** and **ever-illuminated**, there is no **heart of serenity or illumination**; **ever-clear** and **ever-aware**, there is no **thought of clarity or perception**. It is as if all things come and are **reflected**—like a **high-suspended mirror**, nothing can hide. And all this is rooted in **non-action**, with **action** as its application.\n\nWhen **yang** has not yet arisen, one **accumulates essence** and **nurtures qi** to generate it. Once **yang** has arisen, one **treasures essence** and **abundantly nourishes qi** to store it. When later, one **remains in form** and **transforms the world**, having **accumulated merit** and **amassed virtue**, even in birth, one does not boast of **nurturing**—even in action, one does not rely on **clinging to gentleness**—even in longevity, one does not depend on **forced subjugation**.»\n\n「The **heart** of one **kalpa**—the **heart** of ten thousand **kalpas**—truly may be called the **Celestial Sovereign**, wielding the authority to govern **creation and transformation**. Hence, it is termed **\"Mysterious Virtue/Power.\"**\n\nHere, the nine stages of **foundation-building to obtain the elixir**, **refining the self to return the elixir**, and **shedding the mortal coil to attain the Pearl** are expounded—yet all boil down to **ultimate emptiness and profound stillness**, **embracing the Three and holding the One**, **vague and indistinct, dim and obscure** as the essence. From **self-cultivation within** to **returning the elixir**, one cannot depart from **blending the manifest with the unmanifest**, **transforming action into non-action**.\n\nFor **Primordial One-Element True Qi** dwells hidden within **void and nothingness**, beyond the realm of sight and sound. If one **extinguishes awareness** and **abandons action**, this **One-Element True Qi** remains ever-present.\n\nThus, the **Most High** declares:\n*\"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies form;\nIndistinct and faint, yet within it lies substance;\nDim and obscure, yet within it lies essence.\"*\nThis reveals that **life gives birth to Heaven and Earth**—originally **chaotic and formless**, beyond comparison. Only by **unifying the spirit-mind** and **obliterating perception** does the **Dao** reside therein.\n\nShould one awaken to **Great Clarity and Awareness**, then **post-heavenal consciousness** arises in response to thoughts—no longer the **Primordial Original Spirit**. Thus, one must seek in **vagueness and indistinctness**, attain in **dimness and obscurity**. Let the cultivator know whence to begin.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: Non-Action as Function**\n\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub—when the **hub is empty**, the **function of the cart** arises.\nClay is molded into vessels—when the **center is hollow**, the **function of the vessel** arises.\nDoors and windows are carved for a room—when the **space is empty**, the **function of the room** arises.\nThus, **having** is for **utility**, while **emptiness** is for **function**.\n\nThe **Dao** originates at the **Primordial Chaos**, merging within **void and nothingness**—invisible, inaudible. How then does the cultivator proceed?\n\nThe Sage knows the **substance of the Dao** is formless, yet its **function** manifests in forms. Thus, **manifesting the unmanifest**, **embodying the empty**, they **plunder qi from the Chaos** and **withdraw the spirit from the dim**, to complete the **Great Dao of True Unity** and eternally become **immortal and transcendent**.\n\nWhat is called **\"substantial and manifest\"**? The **True Yin and True Yang**, beings of the same kind.\nWhat is called **\"empty and unmanifest\"**? The **Primordial Dao’s root**, the **Dragon-Tiger Eight-Trigrams’ initial tension qi**.\n\nWhere there is **qi without substance**, the **Dao is manifest**.\nThus it is said: *\"When Yin and Yang unite, Primordial Qi appears; when Yin and Yang separate, Post-Heavenal form is complete.\"*\nThe *Classic of Change* states:\n*\"Above form, it is called the Dao; below form, it is called Qi.\"*\nIt is not that there is no vessel without the Dao, nor is it that there is no Dao without a vessel to bear it.\n\nThe **Most High** illustrates with the cart:\n*A cart has spokes and a hub—thirty spokes symbolize the movement of sun and moon, while the hub sits centrally, pierced by all axles. The hub is hollow within, the spokes converge without—thus it turns without hindrance. Were it not for this inner void, how could one be carried? How could things be stored?*\nHence, *\"When the hub is empty, the cart’s function arises.\"*\n\nAgain, like pottery:\n*Mixing water with clay, kneading into vessels—once fired, the exterior is solid, the interior hollow. Yet in all human utility, the value lies not in the clay’s substance but in the hollow’s emptiness. As with Tao Qian transporting bricks, were there not this empty space, how could they move freely?*\nHence, *\"When the center is empty, the vessel’s function arises.\"*\n\nSimilarly, in building a room:\n*One must carve doors and windows—only then does light radiate fully. Yet upon entering, the doors and windows seem unnecessary; it is the empty space that allows one to sit comfortably, though the room itself is formed. Hence, *\"When the space is empty, the room’s function arises.\"*\n\nFrom these three examples, **emptiness** manifests as **form** for the **cart, vessel, and room**; **emptiness** manifests as **void** for **carrying, storing, and dwelling**. Yet what pertains to **manifest forms** is the **utility of extension**; what pertains to **unmanifest void** is the **function of extension**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Having is for utility; emptiness is for function. Having and lacking, lacking and having—each is the root of the other.\"*\n\nIn essence, the **Dao** originates from **void and nothingness**, yet without **Yin and Yang**, it cannot be seen. **Qi** belongs to **Yin and Yang**, yet without the **Dao**, it cannot arise. **Yin and Yang** emerge after **Heaven and Earth**, with defined shapes and locations—**they cannot be the elixir of longevity**. Only by seeking the **Dao** within **Yin and Yang**, returning through **Yin and Yang** to the **Primordial Pole**, can **before and after merge**, and the **Great Dao** be attained.\n\nLater **elixir cultivators**, serving only **manifest qi**, fail to refine the **unmanifest elixir**. To seek transcendence while doing so—is this not like driving a cart southward while heading north?\n\nThe **Dao** has no name; it is **named Dao** by force.\nThe **Dao** requires no cultivation; it is **called cultivation** by force.\nFor the **Dao** as a thing—**ultimately empty, ultimately nothing**—only then can it be **ultimately divine, ultimately sage**.\n\nObserve how **Heaven and Earth’s qi** is clear and void, containing nothing. Yet when suppressed for long, the **qi-machine stirs**, and **Yin and Yang** arise. Then **forms and colors** emerge, **patterned and vivid**, filling the four quarters. Who created them? Who gave them birth?\n\nThe **Dao** gives rise to **One Qi**, and **One Qi** transforms into **Yin and Yang**, from which all things are born.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The **Dao** from **emptiness and nothingness** generates **One Qi**,\nThen from **One Qi** **Yin and Yang** arise.\n**Yin and Yang** thus form the **Three Families**,\nAnd the **Three Families** give birth to myriad transformations, flourishing evermore.\"*\n\nThose who cultivate seek the **Dao’s true essence** to attain the **body of the Transcendent Sage**. They must first take **Yin and Yang** as their **instrument**, then **emptiness and nothingness** as their **root**. Only then will the **Great Dao** be attained.\n\nWithin this chapter, the **three \"Wu\" (無) characters**—they speak of **emptiness** where there is **emptiness**. Roughly, it means: the cultivator, from **nothingness** to **somethingness**, from **somethingness** back to **nothingness**, until **pure and void One Qi** is achieved, and only then does the **Great Dao** take form. Its meaning is surely drawn from this.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: Rejecting the Extraneous, Taking the Essential**\n\nThe **five colors** blind the eyes;\nThe **five tones** deafen the ears;\nThe **five flavors** dull the palate;\n**Hunting and galloping** drive the mind to madness;\n**Rare treasures** obstruct one’s conduct.\n\nThus the **Sage** nourishes the **abdomen**, not the eyes—\nHence, **reject the extraneous, take the essential**.\n\nThe world’s restless pursuit—\nChasing after **sounds, colors, wealth, and gain**,\nGazing far and wide,\nDelighting the eyes, pleasing the mouth—\nIs this not because the **true joys within** are truly delightful?\n\nWho knows that the **pleasures of the world** are limited,\nWhile the **pleasures of the heart** are boundless?\n\nMoreover, where **pleasure** is, **worry** is also.\nWhat benefits the **body** harms the **mind**.\n\nTake **five-colored patterns**—\nTheir hues are radiant, their designs dazzling.\nWho does not **see them and rejoice**, **behold them and be astonished**?\nYet the moment the eyes fix upon them,\nThe **spirit grows dizzy**.\n\nHuman vitality—how much can there be?\nTo linger on sights, indulge the senses,\nAnd call it **beauty**—\nWhoever does so will find their **qi obstructed**, their **spirit wasted**, their **mind in turmoil**, and their **eyes blinded in return**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The **five colors blind the eyes**\"*—\nA truth most profound.\n\nAs for the **melodies of silk and bamboo**, the **sounds of pipes and flutes**,\nEven the **Ancients** did not abandon them.\nYet the **foolish and debauched**,\nIndulging in **female musicians and singing boys**,\nExhaust their **spirit** for fleeting pleasure—\nBefore the music ends, the **clanging still resounds**,\nYet the **inner essence of the ears** has already dissipated outward,\nAnd the **ears grow deaf in return**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The **five tones deafen the ears**.\"*\n\nAs for the **mouth’s taste**—\nBalanced **sweet and fatty**, **thick and thin**—\nEven the **Sage** requires them.\nBut the **gluttonous**,\nGreedy for the **mouth’s desires**, craving **rich flavors**,\nFill their tables with **delicacies**, their kitchens with **exotic meats**,\nSpending **thousands in gold** for a single meal without hesitation.\nDo they not know that what **pleases the mouth** harms the **mind**?\n\nMoreover, the **heart contains boundless supreme flavors**—\nWithout **fattening meats**, yet **sweet**;\nWithout **rich dishes**, yet **satisfying**.\nThose who merely **stuff themselves** seek only to **gratify the mouth**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The **five flavors dull the palate**.\"*\n\nAs for **hunting**—\nThe **Ancient Emperors** did so to **protect the people**, **eliminate harm**, and **encourage farming**.\nLater generations, however, **chase beasts and birds**,\n**Hunt and gallop**, making **hounds their sole pursuit**,\nBurning fields, ravaging mountains,\nEven slaughtering **innocent snakes, scorpions, and insects** without mercy.\nSome **indulge in cruelty**, taking life as their livelihood,\nUnmoved by guilt.\nIn the end, **Heaven’s retribution is swift**—\nA moment’s recklessness brings **calamity**.\n\nMoreover, when **galloping and hunting**, one **releases their violent nature**—\nTheir **body rages**, their **mind rages**.\nThus the **Highest Sage** warns: *\"Hunting and galloping drive the mind to madness.\"*\n\nFurthermore, **rare and strange treasures**—\nThe **Sage** does not **covet them with the eyes**,\nThus **refining customs** and **embellishing virtue**,\nSo all may live in **peace under Heaven**.\nLater generations, however, **value the strange and bizarre**,\nDevoting **half their lifeforce** to **acquiring wealth**,\nYet what they **covet, others covet too**—\nThis is how the **wind of plunder** grows ever fiercer.\n\nThe **Ancients said**:\n*\"An ordinary man bears no guilt,\nYet his **hidden greed** is his crime.\"*\nThus it is known:\n**The deeper the hoarding, the greater the calamity**—\nA truth not false.\n\nEven if one **strengthens defenses** and **guards carefully**,\nIf **Heaven’s will** does not favor them,\n**Destruction is inevitable**.\n\nLife’s **essence and spirit** are precious—\nOnce **soul and body scatter**, where are the **treasures**?\nWhy not **prioritize the inner**, **discard the outer**?\n\nThus the **Highest Sage** warns:\n*\"Rare treasures obstruct conduct\"*—\nUrging the world with solemn care.\n\nTherefore, the **high-minded Daoist**,\n**Empties the mind** to **nourish the nature**,\n**Fills the belly** to **establish life**,\nKnowing that **Prenatal One Qi**—\nWhen born, **flows in**; when dead, **flows out**—\nIs the **unbreakable treasure of the body**.\nWith **one heart devoted** to this,\nAll external things become **like floating clouds**—\nThus **pure and enlightened**, unobstructed,\nAs if **receiving offerings from mortals**,\nOr **ruling as Celestial Sovereign**—\nEven now, their **ears and eyes** remain clear.\n\nAsk: Do **Shun’s zither**, **Zhao’s jade**, **Qi’s lute**, or **Lu’s dwelling** still exist?\nLong since **lost to obscurity**!\n\nThus it is known:\n**Things are finite**, yet the **Dao is infinite**;\n**Man is limited**, yet the **Dao is boundless**.\nTo seek **longevity**, one must **set aside the finite**,\nCultivate the **formless**—\nOnly then will they know what to **prioritize and discard**.\n\nAlas—\nOnly those with **great insight and vision** can **reject the extraneous and take the essential**.\n\nThe **principle of self-cultivation** fundamentally opposes the **world’s ways**—\nKnow that what the **world desires**, the **Daoist abhors**.\n\nThe **world’s coveted** things are the **Daoist’s discarded**.\nFor **sound and color, wealth and gain**—\nThough alluring and beneficial to the **physical form**,\nThey ultimately **profit not the heart**;\nAnd when the **heart grows greedy**,\nThe **physical form itself falls into disharmony**.\n\nOnly the **cultivation of nature and life**—\nSeemingly **formless and insubstantial**,\nNot deemed worthy of the **body’s refinement**—\nIf one can **reject external temptations**,\n**Fulfill their innate essence**,\n**Focus wholeheartedly on inner refinement**,\n**Seek nothing beyond**,\nThen ultimately, **achievement and virtue are complete**,\nAnd the **Dao of longevity** lies therein.\nWhat treasure in the **world surpasses this**?\n\nYet I fear:\n**Resolutions may falter**,\n**Progress on the Dao may lack courage**,\n**Desires and principles intertwined**,\n**Heaven and man in constant conflict**,\nThus making it **difficult to attain perfection**.\n\nI hope future scholars will first **quiet distractions and preserve sincerity**,\nThen **refine lead and subdue mercury**,\nAnd when they reach **returning to their original nature**,\n**Embracing simplicity and returning to truth**,\nWhat difficulty will there be in **joining the ranks of immortals**?\n\nThus, the **Sage cultivates the inner, not the outer**,\n**Nourishes the belly, not the eyes**—\n**Rejecting one and preserving the other**,\n**Concentrating their will and focusing their spirit**,\n**Standing firm in nature and establishing life**,\nIs this not **far superior to worldly glory and wealth** by ten thousandfold?\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation as if Startled**\n\nHonor and humiliation **as if startled**,\nTreating great calamities **as one’s own body**.\n\nWhat is meant by **\"honor and humiliation as if startled\"**?\nHonor is **lowly**—\nTo **gain it** is **as if startled**,\nTo **lose it** is **as if startled**—\nThis is called **\"honor and humiliation as if startled\"**.\n\nWhat is meant by **\"treating great calamities as one’s own body\"**?\nMy **great calamity** arises from **my having a body**—\nWhen I **have no body**,\nWhat **great calamity** shall I face?\nThus, **valuing the body as the world’s foundation**,\nIs **as if one can entrust it to the world below**;\n**Loving the body as the world’s foundation**,\nIs **as if one can commit the world to it**.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"What must one guard? Guarding the body is paramount.\"*\nThe *Book of Songs* states:\n*\"Both bright and wise, to preserve one’s own body.\"*\n\nHow **heavily did the ancients weigh the body**?\n\nThis **body** sustains not only **one’s own nature and life**,\nBut within a **single household**,\nNone do not **rely on it for survival**.\nExtending this further—\nTo **establish the heart for Heaven and Earth**,\nTo **grant life to all things**,\nTo **carry on the teachings of past sages**,\nTo **bring great peace to future generations**—\nAll is **governed by this body**.\n\nThough this **body governs the cosmos**,\nOnly the **Dao masters it**.\nThe **Dao cannot stand alone in emptiness**,\nIt **must depend on a person to uphold it**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"If the body exists, the Dao exists; if the body perishes, the Dao perishes.\"*\n\nThe **great practitioner**, before the **Dao is fully realized**,\n**Retreats from dust and worldly affairs**,\n**Follows the paths of mountain and forest**,\n**Conceals their light and nurtures obscurity**,\n**Finds joy in the Dao and accepts poverty**,\n**Hears no human voices**,\n**Speaks not of worldly matters**,\n**Treads not the red dust of the world**—\nIs this merely to **avoid misfortune and preserve the body**?\nIt is also to **settle the body and establish life**.\n\nWhen the **Perfect One** encounters **worldly honor and glory**,\nOr **shame and disgrace**,\nThey regard them **as ordinary occurrences**,\n**Not worth the slightest concern**.\n\nThough **without cause**, arrows and banners descend upon them,\n**Tributes and invitations arrive**,\n**Emperors and ministers bestow extraordinary favors**,\nAnd **humble dwellings shine with borrowed splendor**—\nThose who **revel in wild delight**,\nThey alone **remain indifferent with increasing calm**.\n\nShould **misfortune befall them**,\n**Reputation and calamity** arriving swiftly,\n**Slanderous mouths of the wicked** spreading,\n**Families unjustly accused**—\nThey alone **do not shift blame to others**,\nBut **accept it upon themselves**.\n\nThe **ancient sages**, in **honor untainted by corruption**,\nIn **humiliation unbroken by despair**,\nHad **good reason**.\nAll understood the **Dao of preserving the body**—\nThey did not **sustain the body with fame and wealth**,\nBut **refined their nature with benevolence and righteousness**,\nThus achieving **an immortal form unspoiled by time**,\n**Reliable for all ages past and present**.\n\nShould one **cling to the body**,\n**Selfish and self-important**,\n**Striving with others for name and gain**,\n**Plotting for food and clothing**,\n**Chasing worldly pursuits in frenzy**,\n**Distracted and chaotic without rest**,\n**Grappling and seizing without end**—\nThen **misfortune will follow swiftly**.\n\nThus, the **gentleman values** **concealing their talents to await their time**,\n**Settling the body to uphold virtue**.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** sees that if people **cannot accept honor with reverence**,\n**Preventing calamity in its unseen form**,\nThat is why there is the **lament**:\n*\"Honor and humiliation as if startled,\nTreating great calamities as one’s own body.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by **\"honor as if startled\"**?\nHonor is **the glory of later attainment**,\nNot the **inherent nobility of origin**—\nThus it is said: **\"Honor is lowly.\"**\n\nYet **common human emotions** cling to **gain and loss**,\nThus to **gain it is as if startled**,\nTo **lose it is as if startled**—\nThis is **\"honor and humiliation as if startled.\"**\n\nWhat is meant by **\"treating great calamities as one’s own body\"**?\nIt means that **people suffer calamity because they have a body**.\nIf **there were no body**,\nFrom where would **calamity arise**?\n\nWhile the **Dao remains incomplete**,\nOne **cannot avoid retaining the body** as a **tool for cultivation**.\nOnce **the shell is shed and ascent is achieved**,\n**Spirit exists yet qi is gone**—\nWhat **misfortune** can befall them?\n\nThough **they retain form and dwell in the world**,\n**All attachments are extinguished**,\n**One true essence is contained within**—\nEven **roaming the four realms**,\nThey **come and go as they please**,\nAnd what **great calamities** shall they face?\n\nThe **world’s cultivators**, who seek to **become gods of a thousand years**,\nTo **be the hope of a thousand people**,\nTo **achieve extraordinary deeds**,\nTo **establish eternal merit**—\nMust **speak and act with utmost restraint**,\n**Treating the body as precious**—\nOnly then can they **be entrusted with the world’s destiny**;\n**Moving or resting with utmost care**,\n**Never daring to be negligent**—\nOnly then can they **be loved by the world**,\nAnd **rely on it for support**.\n\nLike **Shen of the fields**, who **plowed for years in obscurity**,\nYet when **three marriage proposals came**,\nHe **expressed his sincerity**,\nAnd **took responsibility for the people** as if **he were Yao or Shun**;\nOr **like Rong of Nanyang**, who **lay high in seclusion**,\nYet when **invited repeatedly with gifts**,\nHe **stood tall as if he could divide the world into three**—\nThe **entrusting of a six-foot infant**,\nThe **committing of a hundred-li domain**—\nWho but **such a person** could **fulfill this duty**?\n\n「He who **hoards his own self** yet **stands aloof and distant**,\nDoes not **think to use the Dao/Way to benefit the world**,\nNor **lead all beneath the heavens to wander in the Great Dao/Way**—\nThe gap between them is vast indeed.\n\nThis speaks of a person whose **body inherently holds** great worth,\n**Not needing external acquisition**,\nWhose **virtue/power** surpasses even that of **worldly rank and honor**.\nIf one **strives to cultivate this** with unflagging effort—\nAs the ancients said, **\"Toil for two or three years, and joy for ten thousand\"**—\nTruly, it is not false.\nWhat **fears of favor or disgrace**, what **lamentations of affliction**,\nCould ever **disturb such a person**?\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way of scholars** is not yet attained,\nThey must **rely on this body** for **cultivation and refinement**.\nIf they merely **cling to clothing, food, wealth, and honor** as the **essentials for nurturing the body**,\nThen **this mortal frame grows heavy**,\nAnd the **innate, primordial True Body** will **surely suffer harm** from it.\n\nOnce the **innate, primordial True Body** is **damaged**,\nEven the **later-acquired mortal frame** will **find it hard to endure long**.\n\nThis is how **ordinary people love their bodies** yet **ultimately lose them**.\n\nOnly the **Perfect Sage** understands that **all worldly affairs** are but **manifestations of illusion**,\nWith **birth and death**, **unable to be taken as true**.\nOnly **my innate, primordial True Qi** is the **source of my living body**,\n**Enduring for one age**, **for a hundred ages**,\n**For ten thousand years**.\n\nIf **this True Qi is not cultivated**,\nHow could the **mortal frame** ever **come to be**?\nThis is the **inner essence of a human body**—\n**Preserve it, and life continues**; **lose it, and death ensues**.\n**Scatter it, and it becomes matter**; **concentrate it, and it becomes an immortal**.\nIt must **never be separated**, not even for an instant.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** teaches:\n**\"To act with utmost restraint and caution**,\n**Never daring to neglect even the smallest matter**,\n**Never wavering in the slightest thought**,\n**Even less to vie with others in strength or victory**—\nOnly **serene contentment**, **natural ease**,\n**Purity without dust or defilement**,\n**To align oneself with one’s True Nature**.\"\n\nThough **not yet emerging to benefit the people**,\nThe **multitudes of common folk** have **long since rejoiced in safety within his heart**.\nHow else could the **people survive** without such a one?\nThe **people’s longing and reverence** for him run **deep and sincere**.\n\n**\"To take no joy in one’s own joy**,\nBut **to take joy in the world’s joy**—\n**To bear no sorrow in one’s own sorrow**,\nBut **to bear the world’s sorrow**—\nWhat **entrustment and reliance** could be greater than this?**\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Formless Form**\n**Seeing it, yet unseen**—called **Yí (夷)**;\n**Hearing it, yet unheard**—called **Xī (希)**;\n**Seizing it, yet unattained**—called **Wēi (微)**.\nThese three cannot be **grasped or questioned**,\nSo they **merge into one**.\n\nIts **uppermost reaches** are **not bright**,\nIts **lowest depths** are **not obscure**—\n**A continuous thread**, **unnamable**,\nYet **returning to nothingness**.\n\nThis is called the **Form of Formlessness**,\nThe **Form of the Formless**—\nThis is called **Huǎnghǔ (恍惚)**.\n**Approach it, yet its head is unseen**;\n**Follow it, yet its end is unmarked**.\n\n**Holding to the Dao/Way of antiquity**,\nTo **govern the present with it**,\n**Knowing the ancient origins**—\nThis is called **the framework of the Dao/Way**.\n\nIn general, **all affairs of the world** require **a guiding principle and thread**,\nOnly then can one **grasp the main points and hold the outline**,\n**With order and no confusion**.\nHow much more so for **cultivating the Dao/Way**?\n\nMoreover, the **source of the Great Dao/Way** is **True Unity’s Qi**;\n**True Unity’s Qi** is the **root of the Great Dao/Way**.\nWhat is **True Unity’s Qi**?\nThe *Book of Odes* says: **\"The mandate of Heaven is vast and ceaseless, its solemnity unending.\"**\nWhat is the **root and source of the Great Dao/Way**?\nThe *Book of Odes* says: **\"The carriage of Heaven moves on without sound or scent.\"**\n**Reason and Qi united** is the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIf a **cultivator recognizes this framework**,\nAnd **discovers its beginnings**,\n**Regulating emotions with principle**, **fixing nature with righteousness**,\n**Taking the boundless, formless Qi as the foundation**—\nThen the **Dao/Way of longevity** is **attained**.\n\nIf one **takes clarity and brightness, purity and lucidity** as **cultivation**,\nI **fear the Dao/Way has no true essence**,\nAnd all **effort is in vain**.\n\nThus the **Supreme Sage** describes the **innate, primordial Dao/Way**:\n**\"Seeing it, yet unseen—called Yí (夷);\nHearing it, yet unheard—called Xī (希);\nSeizing it, yet unattained—called Wēi (微).\"**\n\nThe **heart** communicates with the **eyes**—\nThe **eyes** harbor **spirit**.\nThe **kidneys** communicate with the **ears**—\nThe **ears** harbor **essence**.\nThe **spleen** communicates with the **four limbs**—\nThe **four limbs** belong to the **spleen**, the **spleen** to **Earth**,\n**Earth** generates all things—\n**True Qi** condenses here.\nThus **spirit and essence dwell here**.\n\nIf the **eyes see something**,\nIf the **ears hear something**,\nIf the **hands act**—\nThese are **later-acquired, tangible, colored, scented, and audible essence, spirit, and Qi**,\nOnly **able to manifest form**,\n**Not able to manifest the Dao/Way**.\n\nOnly when **seeing nothing**—\nThen the **innate, primordial Wood Nature** is **revealed**;\nWhen **hearing nothing**—\nThen the **innate, primordial Metal Emotion** is **revealed**;\nWhen **seizing nothing**—\nThen the **innate, primordial Earth Will** is **revealed**.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe **later-acquired Water, Fire, and Earth**—\n**They give rise to form**;\nThe **innate, primordial Metal, Wood, and Earth**—\n**They bring about immortality**.\n\nThe **Yí (夷), Xī (希), Wēi (微)**—\nThese are **profound, mysterious, and distant**,\n**Beyond grasp or comprehension**—\nThere is **truly what cannot be exhausted or questioned**.\n\nIf one can **merge the Five Qi into One Qi**,\nAnd **blend the Three Primordials into One Primordial**—\nThen **True Primordial Qi** is **here**,\nAnd **Heaven’s natural sovereignty** is **here as well**.\n\nThus the *Awakening to True Reality* says:\n**\"A maiden in green robes (Fire generates Water),\nA scholar in white silk (Water generates Metal).\nSeeing it, yet **unable to use it** (Later-acquired Water, Fire, Earth),\nUsing it, yet **unable to see it** (Innate, primordial Metal, Wood, Earth).\n**Huǎnghǔ (恍惚)**—here they meet,\n**Yǎomíng (杳冥)**—here **transformation occurs**.\nIn a flash, **Fire blazes forth**,\nAnd the **Perfect Sage emerges**.\"**\n\nIf a **cultivator knows this**,\nHe **knows the source of the Great Dao/Way**,\nAnd the **key to cultivating it**.\n\nIf one **does not know** that it **begins with the Void**,\nBut **fixates on the foul gas of this mortal corpse**,\n**On impure and confused spirit**,\n**On a generated, luminous mind**,\n**On fabricated perception and reflection**—\nI **fear that his reserves are not deep**,\nAnd his **emergence will not be smooth or effortless**.\n\nThis is the **work of refining essence, Qi, and spirit**—\nThus it **never departs from the state of Hun Dun (混沌)**.\n\nOnce **Hun Dun (混沌)** is **achieved**,\nWith **time**, the **embryonic body grows**,\nAnd the **Yang Spirit is born**—\nYet **the methods for nurturing the embryo and fostering the spirit** must **also be known**,\nWhich are the **principles of loving the people and governing the state without action**,\nAs taught in the **previous chapter**.»\n\n「The **Yang Spirit** rises and falls, flowing naturally—\nWhen it ascends to the heights, one does not know whence it came,\nThus it is not dazzling.\nWhen it descends to the depths, one does not neglect its hidden source,\nThus it is not obscure.\n\nFrom this, it extends endlessly and subtly,\nContinuously and inextricably,\nIndescribable in form,\nYet all things arise from this **Hun Dun (混沌)**—\nThe **Daoist** *Zhuangzi* says: *“Wash the heart and retreat to the hidden depths”*—\nThis is its essence!\n\nThus it returns to the **Void of No-Thing (无物)**.\nThough No-Thing, yet the **ten thousand affairs and things of the world**,\nAll emerge from this **Void**.\n\nThe **Taoist Sage (太上)** speaks of the **formless Form (无状之状)**,\nThe **imageless Image (无象之象)**—\nBut what **Form** or **Image** is there indeed?\nOnly a fleeting glimpse in the **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**.\n\nTruly **dim and indistinct (恍惚)**,\nThe **True Primordial Qi (真元)** is born.\nIf one **welcomes its opportunity and guides it (迎其机而导之)**,\nIt seems to arise from nowhere—**the beginning is unseen (前不见其首)**;\nIf one **follows its movement and draws it (随其气而引之)**,\nIt ends without trace—**the end is unseen (后不见其尾)**.\n\nSuch is the **vastness of the Dao (道之浩浩)**—\nThis is not the **great cycle of the mundane world (大周沙界)**,\nNor the **subtle penetration into the minutest things (毫芒)**,\nBut the **Dao itself (是道也)**—\nWhat **Dao** is this?\nIt is the **Primordial Qi of Origin (元始一气)**,\nThe **true sovereign of the human body and its organs (人身官骸真宰)**.\n\nTo **obtain it** is to **live**,\nTo **lose it** is to **die**;\nTo **preserve it fully** is to **be human**,\nTo **neglect it** is to **be mere things**—\nIts **manifestation is but a hair’s breadth apart**.\n\nA **student of the Dao** who **attains this Primordial Qi (元始之气)**,\nAnd **regulates and nurtures the five organs and hundred bones (调摄乎五官百骸)**,\nWill have **luminous hair and skin, smooth and refined flesh**—\nThis is the **embodiment of ancient Dao (执古之道)**,\nTo **command the present (以御今之有)**.\n\nIf a **student of the Dao** can **recognize this Primordial Qi (元始一气)**—\nThe **origin of heaven and earth (开天辟地)**, before the **ancient times (太古)**—\nAnd **hold it as the framework of one’s body (以为一身纲纪)**,\nThe **core of all affairs (万事主脑)**,\nThen **one’s foundation is upright (体立)**, and **all else follows naturally (用自行)**,\n**One’s root is pure (本正)**, and **the branches align (末自端)**.\n\nIf a **student of the Dao** does not **take this Primordial Qi (元始一气)** as the foundation,\nAnd **seeks to cultivate awakened awareness (修正觉)**,\nHe **falls into false paths (反堕旁门)**—\nThis is truly **pitiable**!\n\nTo **grasp the Dao’s essence (状道之体)**,\nA **student of the Dao** must **understand this body (会得此体)**.\nFor **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** is the **source of innate life and death (先天性命之源)**,\nNot to be compared with **postnatal essence, Qi, and spirit (后天精气神)**.\n\nTo **perceive the vital breath (命气)**,\nOne must **merge the innate True One (性真)** with it,\nOnly then will **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** be attained.\n\nThough this **Qi is formless and boundless (浑浑沦沦，浩浩荡荡)**,\nWithout **image or shape (虽无可象可形)**,\nYet all **images and shapes in the world (天下之有象有形者)**,\nEmerge from this **formless and imageless (无形无象)**.\nTruly the **pivotal foundation of the Dao (大道纪纲)**,\nThe **root of heaven, earth, and all beings (天地人物之根本)**.\n\nThe **Daoists** speak of **holding the center (守中)**,\nThe **Buddhist** speak of **contemplating emptiness (观空)**,\nThe **Confucians** speak of **cultivating solitude with caution (慎独)**—\nAll share the **same fundamental practice**.\n\nTo the **outer eye**, it seems **neither seen nor heard (无睹无闻)**,\nYet **within oneself**, it is **utterly clear (至虚至实，至无至有)**.\nThus **Zi Si (子思)** says:\n*“Do not reveal what is hidden,\nDo not display what is subtle.”*\n\nThe **scholar’s practice of solitude (君子慎独之功)** is **unceasing**.\nIn the **hidden, subtle, and secluded realm (隐微幽独之地)**,\nThough there may be **what can be displayed or grasped (可显可据)**,\nThe **Dao’s root and source (大道根源)** is **only the most elusive and mysterious (希夷微妙)**—\n**Indescribable yet described (无可状而状)**,\n**Formless yet imaged (无可象而象)**,\n**Exalted in its pristine unity (极其浑穆)**.\n\nA **student of the Dao** must,\n**Before Yang arises**, await it in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**,\n**When Yang is born**, welcome it in **dim and indistinct**,\n**When Yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron (归炉入鼎)**,\n**Preserve and nurture it in dim and indistinct**—\n**Never awakening a great luminous mind (绝不起大明觉心)**),\nOnly then will one **constantly attain the Dao’s return (无时无处而不得大道归源)**.\n\nEarlier, it was said that when the **Yang Spirit appears (阳神出现)**,\n**Heaven and earth are illuminated (明天察地)**,\n**He penetrates the mysterious and reaches the subtle (通玄达微)**,\nAnd **upon enlightenment (及了悟之候)**,\nThe **radiant landscape (光明景界)** is **purely natural (纯任自然)**—\n**Awareness seems as if it were not (有知若无知)**,\n**Perception seems as if it were not (有觉若无觉)**—\n\n**How much more so at the very beginning of practice?**\nCan one not **kill the mundane heart (死人心)** to **generate the Daoist heart (生道心)** in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Mysterious Communication**\nThe **ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,\nWere **subtle and mysterious (微妙玄通)**,\n**Deep beyond recognition (深不可识)**.\n\nBecause they were **beyond recognition (唯不可识)**,\nThey **forced a semblance of form (故强为之容)**:\n**Serious (豫)**, as if **crossing a river in winter (若冬涉川)**;\n**Cautious (犹)**, as if **fearing the four neighbors (若畏四邻)**;\n**Solemn (俨)**, as if **a guest (若客)**;\n**Dissipated (涣)**, as if **ice about to melt (若冰之将释)**;\n**Unadorned (敦)**, as if **raw and simple (若朴)**;\n**Vast (旷)**, as if **a valley (若谷)**;\n**Turbulent (浑)**, as if **muddy waters (若浊)**.\n\nWho can **clarify what is turbulent (浊以澄静)**?\nOnly **gradually (徐清)**.\nWho can **establish what is tranquil (安以久动)**?\nOnly **gradually (徐生)**.\n\nThose who **preserve the Dao (保此道者)** do not **seek fullness (不欲盈)**,\nThus they **remain unspoiled though worn (敝不新成)**.\n\nThe **Taoist Sage (太上)** spoke earlier of the **Dao’s essence (道体)**,\nNow he speaks of **those who embody the Dao (体道之人)**.\n**Man and the Dao** are **two as one (二而一)**—\nThe **Dao is invisible (无可见)**,\nYet **through man, it becomes visible (因人可见)**.\n\nHow can **man become immortal (人何能仙)**?\nThrough **the Dao (以道而仙)**.\n\nWhat is the **Dao (道者何)**?\nIt is **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)**—\nThe **virtue/power (德)** of the *Zhongyong (中庸)*.\n\nTo **cultivate the Dao**, is there **any other way (岂有他哉)**?\n**King Wen (文王)** was **dutiful and reverent (小心翼翼)**,\nServing the **Celestial Sovereign (上帝)** with clarity.\n**Confucius (孔子)** was **modest and restrained (足缩缩)**,\nAs if **following a path (有循)**.\n\nThe **Dao as Dao** is **nothing more than reverence (不过一敬)**.\nIf **man can dwell in reverence (以敬居心)**,\nWith **no thought left unguarded (一念不苟)**,\nAnd **no deed taken lightly (一事不轻)**,\nIs not the **Dao itself (大道)** here?\n\nThough the **Dao is not strange (无奇怪)**,\nIt **depends on those who embody it (尤赖有体道者)**—\nOnly then does the **Dao not hang empty in heaven and earth (不虚悬于天壤)**.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:\n*“The ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,\n**Their actions were not dualistic (其为物不二)**,\nThus their **generation of things was beyond measure (生物不测)**.\nHow **subtle and mysterious (至微至妙)** is this Dao!\n\n*“Stillness yet responsive (寂然不动，感而遂通)**—\nHow **profound and penetrating (至玄至通)** is this Dao!\n\nIt is **only their vastness of heart (心之浩浩)**,\nAnd **their boundless Qi (气之洋洋)**—\nLike the **depth of rivers and seas (不啻江河之深)**,\nMaking one **unfathomable (无从测识)**.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:\n*“Because it is beyond recognition (夫惟不识)**,\nThey force a semblance of form (故强为之容)**.”*\n\nTo reveal the **inner truth** as unfathomable yet its outward form as something that can be shaped—\nIts **mind ever-vigilant in solitude (心心慎独)**, in every place preserving sincerity (在在存诚),\nLike **Yu’s crossing of the river**, waiting for ice to solidify before passage;\nOr **like the night traveler**, awaiting still winds before proceeding—this is the utmost caution.\n\nIts **orderly solemnity** is like a **guest of honor** arriving from afar, daring not to slacken;\nIts **effortless liberation**, unburdened and unconstrained, is like **ice melting into water**, leaving no trace to follow;\nIts **loyal and thick-hearted sincerity**, its **benevolent kindness toward all things**, is like **Taipu’s pristine wholeness**, untouched by carving, yet **perfectly seamless**;\nIts **restful yet capacious demeanor**, its **humble self-restraint**,—what differs it from **deep mountains and hidden valleys**, empty yet boundless, vast yet all-embracing?\n\nSuch its form—its **nature is known**.\nAll this is **the Dao’s vastness borne in silence**, conforming to the **Heavenly Pattern** yet unrecognized.\nIt is as if **Shun dwelling in the deep mountains**, no different from the **wild men of the wilderness**.\n\nIts **primordial and muddled mien**—how could the **dim-witted** ever emulate it?\nYet **muddled and turbid** are alike in name, **sage and commoner** share the same root—\nThe **commoner’s turbidity** is truly turbid;\nThe **Sage’s turbidity**, though muddled like turbidity, is in truth **utterly turbid yet utterly clear**.\n\nYet the Sage **does not claim sainthood**—this is how sainthood is attained;\nThe commoner **does not claim ordinariness**—yet remains truly ordinary.\nWho can **clarify the mind’s defilements** and still them, awaiting their **prolonged stillness** until **pure light emerges**?\nWho can **nurture the nature’s innate tranquility**, immersing and expanding it,\nUntil, through **long cultivation**, life **gradually unfolds**—\nHarvesting it as **medicine**, refining it as **elixir**?\nIs not the **Way of Preserving Life** found here?\n\nThis is **stillness to concentrate the spirit**, **movement to generate qi**—\nIt is **holding the Center**, it is **the Yang Life of the Child**.\nFrom this **rising and descending**, gathering back into the furnace,\nGradually refining, gradually condensing—\nAll is **one undivided mind**, all **phenomena as empty**—\nPreserving this **Yang** alone.\n\nThe more **substance**, the more **it heals**; the more **emptiness**, the more **emptiness**.\nWith **utterly empty mind**, without **fear of excess**,\nThus one can **return the One True Qi**, attain the **Eternal Dao**.\n\nAnd what of *“The worn-out is not replaced”*?\nFor all **newly made things** decay swiftly—\nYet this **decays without decaying**.\nDecay is its **manifest trace**; non-decay is its **spirit**.\nOne **True Essence** contained within, **ten thousand spirits** manifested without—\nIts **subtle, mysterious, and profound penetration** is indeed as such.\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao-embodying sage’s** meticulous caution—\nThough the **Dao is originally empty and void**, yet **Dao-masters** can **form without form**, **manifest without image**,\nAs if **inner and outer are perfectly unified**.\n\nThe seven clauses beginning with *“like”* (若) all **borrow phenomena to describe the Dao’s marvels**,\nRevealing its **profound, unfathomable depths**.\n\n*“Who can”* and the following sentences speak of those **unable to perfect virtue** yet seeking **entry into the Dao**.\nTurbidity is hard to clarify—**stillness preserves the mind’s purity**;\nTranquility requires duration—**movement sharpens the spirit’s insight**.\nFullness invites loss—**thus one avoids excess**;\nNovelty decays swiftly—**thus one avoids the newly made**.\n\nI wish the **seeker** to be **empty yet capacious**, **unpolished yet genuine**,\n**Primordially vast and unrestrained**, everywhere displaying **sincerity and integrity**—\nThen **no heart will fail to transform into Dao-heart**, no **vulgar qi** will fail to become **True Qi**.\n\nDo not, because the **depths are unfathomable**, hesitate and retreat!\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixteen: The Extremes of Emptiness and Sincere Stillness**\n\n**Attain the utmost emptiness**, **guard the most sincere stillness**.\nWhen **all things flourish together**, I observe their return.\nFor **all things, teeming and diverse**, each **returns to its root**.\nReturning to the root is **stillness**; stillness is **restoring the Mandate**.\nRestoring the Mandate is **constancy**; knowing constancy is **clarity**.\nIgnorant of constancy, **reckless action brings ruin**.\nKnowing constancy, **one is tolerant**—\nTolerance brings **impartiality**, impartiality brings **kingly virtue**,\nKingly virtue brings **Heaven**, Heaven brings **the Dao**,\nThe Dao brings **duration**—**lifelong without peril**.\n\nIf one seeks to **cultivate the Great Dao**, to **become a Golden Immortal**,\nAnd **endure for countless eons without decay**,\nFrom the **very first step**, one must not fail to grasp its **root**.\n\nWhat is this **root**?\nIt is the **Mysterious Pass orifice**.\n\nFor **cultivating True Essence and refining the Dao** is not a single path—\nHow could the **Mysterious Pass’s marvels** exhaust its depths?\nHeaven has **Heaven’s root**, things have **their stems**, humans have **their source**—\nNever has one **without origin** achieved **great deeds** or **immortal feats**.\n\nObserve **Heaven and Earth before their opening**—\nSilent and void, without sound;\nAfter their unfolding, **vast and boundless**.\nIs this **unopened state** the **Heaven’s root**?\nVague and formless—**hardly the Heaven’s root**.\nIs this **unfolded state** the **Heaven’s root**?\nEver-expanding and endless—**yet not the Heaven’s root**.\nThen where is this **root**?\nIt lies in the **threshold of opening and not-yet-opening**.\n\nObserve **humans and things before their birth**—\nFaint and indistinct, without form;\nAfter their nurturing, **prolific and boundless**.\nIs this **unborn state** their **origin**?\nMisty and shapeless—**hardly their origin**.\nIs this **nurtured state** their **origin**?\nEver-changing and endless—**yet not their origin**.\nThen where is this **origin**?\nIt too lies in the **threshold of birth and not-yet-born**.\n\nHow can one **cultivate the Great Dao** without knowing this **single orifice** and act in reckless confusion?\n\nThe **Taoist Sage** instructs those who **nurture the Dao and seek the Mysterious**:\n*“Attain utmost emptiness, guard sincere stillness—I observe their return.”*\nThis clarifies that **cultivators must**—\n**Discard superficiality**, **return to sincerity**,\n**Concentrate the spirit in emptiness**, **nurture qi in stillness**—\nAt the **utmost emptiness**, in **sincere stillness**,\nNaturally **all phenomena dissolve**, **One Truth is embraced**.\n\nThe *Classic of Change* thus says:\n*\"Does one see the **Heaven-Earth’s heart** at its return?\"*\n\nMaster Zhao further expounds:\n*\"At the Winter Solstice, the half of the Child—\nWhen the **Heavenly Root** reaches its utmost subtlety,\nThe first stir of **One Yang**—\nThe moment when all things begin to be born.\nThis is when **Heavenly Principle returns**, which the ancients likened to the **living Child hour**.\"*\n\nIt is also said:\n*\"When One Yang first emerges, the **dark and void** awaken in collision.*\nThis is the very **pivot** where all things return to their uprightness,\nwhere **Heaven-Earth’s return** unfolds.\nHere, the **Primordial Ancestor’s Original Qi** of the **Pre-Heaven** may truly be observed.\n\nYet its **mechanism is most subtle**, its **qi most swift**—\nIt is present now, gone in an instant.\nLike **stone-fire and lightning**, it vanishes in a blink.\n\nObserve the grasses and trees:\nThough they flourish in **teeming forms**—\nBranches and leaves, **radiant and patterned**, dazzling the eye—\nNone of these suffice as the **root of rebirth** or the **source of renewal**.\nOnly when **emergence turns to withdrawal**,\nWhen **life transforms into death**,\nWhen **roots gather fruit**,\nDoes each return to its origin—\nJust as the **alchemical adept’s elixir head** does.\n\nReturning to the root,\nIt is also **motion turning back to stillness**.\nOnce returned to stillness,\nIt once more **descends to bestow the noble seed**—\nFor things, this is **returning to their origin**;\nFor humans, this is **restoring the Mandate**.\nIt is no different matter.\n\nSpring and autumn pass—**the old gives way to the new**;\nLife and death alternate—**the blooming fades**.\nThus, the **adept’s way of restoring the Mandate**\nIs but the **interplay of Heaven-Earth’s Two Qi**,\nThe **flow of One Qi**—\nThe most **even**, the most **ordinary** of **Ways**.\n\nTo know the **Constant Way** is to grasp the **Great Dao**.\nFrom here, one’s practice advances—\nOnly then will it not stray.\n\nYet the **world’s errant paths**—\nIgnorant of the **Dao’s roots**,\nUnwilling to **purify the heart and clear the mind**,\nTo **return to origins and grasp the end**—\nSome **refine the nature of perception**,\nSome **cultivate the form and qi of life**,\nSome **harvest seven metals and eight stones** as medicine,\nSome **take young boys and girls** to forge the elixir—\nWith no foundation, where can the **Dao** be found?\nMoreover, fixated on one extreme,\nThey stray into **perverse paths**—\nAnd how many have **ruined their bodies and lost their lives**?\nAll this stems from **not knowing the Dao as the Constant Way**,\nThus **pursuing obscurities and performing wonders**,\n**Treading dangers and inviting calamity**.\n\nOnly when one knows that **the Dao belongs to the True and Constant**—\nThat it is **inherent in all people**, **sufficient in all things**—\nAnd does not **rejoice in knowing it** nor **marvel at possessing it**,\nLike **water and fire to humanity**—\nFreely taken and wielded at will—\n**Resting in emptiness yet capacious**,\nViewing **self and other with equal breadth**,\nHolding a **vastly impartial heart**—\nThen one aligns with the **Sage-King**.\n*\"My people, my kin; all things, my companions.\"*\nStanding with **Heaven-Earth’s extremes**,\nUniting with **all things in a single source**,\nUnseparated—\nIs this not **becoming One with Heaven**?\n\nFor **Heaven is the Dao**, the **Dao is Heaven**;\n**Beyond Heaven, there is no Dao**; **beyond the Dao, there is no Heaven**.\nOnly **Heaven is supreme**; only the **Sage follows it**.\nOnly the **Dao is sovereign**; only **Heaven is its law**.\n\nThus, for humans: **birth and death**.\nFor the **Dao**: **eternal and unexhausted**.\nEven **ascension and shell-shedding**—\nThere comes a time of **decay and annihilation**.\nYet though the **form perishes**, the **spirit does not perish**;\nThough the **body is lost**, the **qi does not perish**.\n\nAs the *Odes* say:\n*\"The King Wen stands above—\nIlluminating to Heaven.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nAll this comes from **attaining utmost emptiness and sincere stillness**,\nThen **observing the returning symbol**—\nOnly then can one be **fathomless**.\n\nThe scholar—**how dare they neglect the root and act recklessly, inviting misfortune?**\n\nThe **Most High** instructs on the **foundational practice**,\nThe **headwork of learning**.\nWhere one gains strength here,\nThere is strength everywhere.\n\nIf the scholar grasps this meaning,\nThey will **diligently uphold the Rule**,\n**Unceasingly, like silk threads**—\nFrom **non-being to being**, from **being to non-being**—\nEven in a **single breath’s instant**, the **root of the Great Dao** is present;\nIn **a meal’s time**, the **Primordial Beginning** of the **Dao** is stored.\nFrom this **single thread of subtle mechanism**,\nIf **gathered and refined**,\nGradually it **burgeons uncontrollably**—\nAll this is the **accumulation of One Yang**.\n\nThough **mighty qi fills Heaven-Earth**,\nThough the **Yang Spirit** pierces the **Big Dipper and Bull**—\nWhat is it but the **piling of a single True Qi**?\n\nThe **student who lacks this True Qi**,\nBut only **refines the post-heavenal form and spirit**,\nIs but **one hair of nine oxen**, **one grain of the sea**—\nHow dare they **compare with Heaven-Earth**?\n\nOnly by **walking this Way and becoming One with Heaven-Earth**\nDoes one achieve **unbreakable for billions of years**.\nThe **Dao-cultivator must take this seriously**—\n**Seizing the moment without loss**.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Work Completed, the Body Fulfilled**\n\nThe **Most High**—\n*Unknown to be known* (All other versions read *\"The lowly knows what is known\"*—\nYet this contradicts the **text’s intent**; it is a scribal error).\n\nNext, they are **cherished and praised**;\nNext, they are **feared**;\nNext, they are **insulted**.\n**Trust is insufficient**; **doubt arises**.\n*\"Ah, how cautious with words!\"*\nWhen the **work is complete and the matter fulfilled**,\nThe people all say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\n(*The line \"Ah, how cautious with words!\" speaks of **ease and sincerity**, **solemn reverence in proclamation**.*)\n\n---\n\n**The Dao of the Most High in Cultivating the Body is the Dao of Governing the World—nothing more than the singular True.**\n\nThe True, when held within oneself, refines the self;\nThe True, when applied to all things, fulfills the world.\nThough there be distinctions of inner and outer, self and others,\nThe True of this heart remains ever unchanging.\n\nIf one attains **至诚** without ceasing,\nThen the people’s response to them shall also be unceasing.\nIf one attains **至诚** with interruption,\nThen the world’s response to them shall also be interrupted.\n\nFor all share this heart, this heart shares this principle:\nCultivate the body, and the world naturally finds peace;\nLose the True, and the world must fall into chaos.\n\nFrom the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** down to the present,\nThere has never been one who differed in this.\n\nThe Most High wishes people to cultivate themselves with **sincerity and trust**,\nAnd thus governs them with **sincerity and trust**.\nWithout being seen, yet manifest;\nWithout acting, yet transforming;\nWithout doing, yet achieving.\n\nTo oneself, the Dao of governance is unknown;\nTo the people, it is felt through **ease and sincerity**,\n**Solemn reverence in proclamation**,\nAnd yet they do not perceive its transformation—\nNor know its origin.\n\nThis was the pure wind of antiquity;\nI have long failed to see it again.\n\nThus the Most High says:\n*\"The Most High—unknown to be known.\"*\nSo that ruler and people alike rejoice in **光天化日** beneath the radiant heavens and earth.\n\nIf **sincerity and trust** were not deeply rooted,\nHow could such **divine transformation** exist?\n\nThe **restoring wind of the ancient emperors** has faded long ago,\nThe **Most High’s perfect governance** is unheard of today.\nThus the customs decline, the **Great Dao** grows distant,\nAnd there are things too dire for words or witness.\n\nIf the ancient ways are not yet lost,\nIf the Dao still lingers,\nIf **天性** has not yet been obscured,\nAnd **至诚** remains,\nThen though not as profound as the **Most High’s** sincerity,\nIt is still the **light and splendor** of the present age.\n\nAll are ways of governance—\nOne without thought yet naturally transforming,\nOne with intent yet applying **仁**.\n\nTo cherish the people as one cherishes an infant,\nTo love the people as one loves family—\nIn such times, the **revered and long-lived** are honored,\nAnd their words are answered as echoes.\n\nYet when **ease and sincerity** are not uniform,\n**Virtue and transformation** cannot be equal.\nOnly through **cherishing and loving** them,\n**Praising and rewarding** them,\nWithout adding **harsh words or punishments**,\nDo they harbor **gratitude and fear**.\n\nThough not reaching the Most High,\nThis still follows the Dao, the path—\nPraiseworthy indeed,\nAs the saying goes: *\"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there are仁 and義.\"*\n\nThus **Emperor降** became **Emperor**, and **Emperor** became **King**—\nAll were those who knew **virtue** and practiced the **Kingly Dao**.\n\nLater, when the ancient customs grew distant,\nThe Great Dao more obscure,\n**King**降 became **Conqueror**,\nUsing **仁 and義** as pretexts,\nEach with their own heart, their own perception—\nFar removed from the **single virtue** of the emperors and kings.\n\nThus though **rites and teachings** remain,\nThough **laws and decrees** persist,\nThough **institutions and prohibitions** are unchanged,\nThe **True** of their hearts differs greatly.\n\nOnly through **talent and brilliance** do they govern the world,\nRelying on **laws and measures** to guide the people.\nWhen their administration is fitting,\nAnd their policies lawful,\nThe people fear them and dare not break laws or transgress rules—\nThis is the **clever ruler**, the **greatly peaceful age**.\n\nAnd those below them—\nToo dire to speak of.\n\nThey **trust in cunning** to drive the people,\nThey **indulge in deceit** to rule the masses,\nWith **狐狸** and **虎豹** hearts,\nThey enact **狐狸** and **虎豹**-like governance.\n\nWhen they are **haughty and self-proclaimed**,\nWhen they are **boastful and self-satisfied**,\nThere is none who does not think them wiser than the **Three Kings**,\nOr more talented than the **Five Conquerors**—\nYet the people of this age,\nIn the end, **fearful and trembling** in their sleep,\nAre truly **insulted and oppressed**.\n\nThough the people dare not speak,\nTheir hearts are divided and estranged,\nAnd thus there is no **unceasingly harmonious governance**—\nHence, disaster follows swiftly upon their heels.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"When the ruler values trust, the people will use their emotions.\"*\nIf trust is insufficient within oneself,\nHow can one expect trust from the people?\n\nThis is why ruler and people **deceive and trick each other**.\n\nWhen **institutions, teachings, laws, and decrees** are issued,\nEven the **Sage** does not abandon them—\nYet **emotion and falsity** are divided,\nAnd **response and resonance** differ.\n\nOnly the **Emperor and King** set the example with their bodies,\n**Trusting and inspiring** the people.\nWhen laws are established, governance follows;\nWhen words are spoken, the people believe.\nUltimately, their **light shines to the four quarters**,\nTheir **work is complete and their matter fulfilled**,\nAs **Yao** did in the **Age of Change and Prosperity**,\nAnd **Shun** in his **self-cultivation and non-action**—\nAnd the people all say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\nAlas!\nThe reach of **true trust** is vast—\nCompared to those who lack trust within,\nThe difference is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\n**Dao and Virtue** are all-encompassing,\nRefining the self here, governing the world here—\nExtending to all things under heaven,\nNothing lies beyond this scope.\n\nThus the words *\"Most High\"* in this chapter\nRefer to those of the highest rank,\nPossessing the highest **quality**—\nHence, *\"Most High.\"*\n\nThe **highest virtue** is **清净** and **无为**,\nWith the **六根** all settled.\nNext, they **reverence and love**, transforming the people—\nWhen moved, they respond.\nNext, they **fear and awe**, ruling the world.\nNext, they **guide the people with cunning**—\nThis is called **术**.\n\nYet the most wondrous of all is **trust**.\n**Trust** belongs to **土**,\nAnd its cultivation is **修炼始终**—\nIts purest essence lies in **意土**.\n\nThus the Most High says:\n*\"Its essence is supremely true,\nAnd within it lies trust\"*—\nThis is the **elixir foundation**.\n\n**Trust** is nothing else—\n**至诚** alone.\nIf one attains **至诚** without ceasing,\nThen the **elixir** is the **elixir** indeed.\n\nYet **trust** and **falsity** are nearly indistinguishable—\nA moment’s thought leads to **sainthood**,\nNeglect leads to **madness**.\nThe boundary between **man and beast**,\nThe threshold of **life and death**—\nAll that is contested lies in this **interval**.\n\nI wish the **later scholars** to seek **true trust**,\nFor the **constant Dao** can be found therein.\n\nWhere is **trust**?\nIt is the **玄关** of a single aperture—\nDo people truly know it?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Abandoned**\n\nThe **Great Dao abandoned**,\nThere are **仁 and義**.\n**智慧** arises,\nThere is **great deception**.\nThe **六亲** are not harmonious,\nThere are **孝 and慈**.\nThe state is **昏乱**,\nThere are **loyal ministers**.\n\nI have observed the **Age of the Most High**—\nCustoms were **敦厚** and **朴实**,\nPeople were **浑朴** and sincere,\nEach **正其性**, **定其命**,\n**安其俗**, **乐其业**—\nLike things following **天** and moving,\nLike nature acting as it will,\nWithout need of artifice or contrivance,\nNot awaiting arrangement or command,\nIn accordance with **性**’s natural course—\nAnd yet there were those who **did not know its origin**.\n\n「Zhuangzi spoke of those bloated and labored in their exertions—\nTheir dull sincerity, weary toil,\nMoving in accord with Heaven’s flow,\nRich with **true intent**.\n\nThis is why they fail to recognize or know,\nFollowing the **Way**’s natural course.\nWhat manner of transformation is this?\nNaught but **浑浑沦沦**—\nUnthinking, undisturbed,\nUnified with the **Great Dao**.\n\nYet alas, the **royal winds** decline,\nThe **Great Dao** grows ever feebler.\nThose in high station then speak of **仁 and義**,\nDiligently toiling, none daring to stray.\nTo dwell in **義** while upholding **仁**,\nIs indeed a praiseworthy deed of sages—\nNot wholly to be condemned;\nBut compared to ancient times of flourishing **Dao**,\nWhen hearts were **浑噩** and minds unspoiled,\nWhere **仁 and義** existed without need of speech—\nThe difference is vast.\n\nThus the **Most High** sighed:\n*\"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**.\"*\n\nFrom this point on,\nBoth high and low covet **仁 and義**,\nYet those who claim them practice deceit,\nThough **仁 and義** still appear,\nTheir actions have grown corrupt.\nIs this because **仁 and義** are flawed?\nOr because the **Dao** is pierced and hollowed,\nAnd those ensnared by **仁**, enslaved by **義**, bring harm to it?\n\nStill, they call it **仁 and義**,\nThough not as pure as the **Great Dao**,\nIt has not yet fallen into **great deception**.\n\nAfter this,\nCustoms grew ever more perverse,\nHearts grew ever more corrupted.\nEven where **仁 and義** were taught,\nLittle remained—\nFor in the halls of court and the common folk,\nBetween ruler and subject,\nAll flaunted their **智** and paraded their **慧**,\nWithin their cliques,\nDeceit and suspicion reigned supreme.\nHow could such a people hope to **harmonize the family** or **govern the state**?\n\nThus, sons and fathers grew estranged,\nBrothers turned against one another,\nEven husband and wife, friends and neighbors,\nRelatives and townsfolk—\nEach with their own heart,\nEach with their own view,\nAs distant as **Hu and Yue**,\nLet alone the rest!\n\nIf a son could show **孝**,\nThe court would single him out for praise;\nIf a father could show **慈**,\nThe village would acclaim him in unison.\nAlas!\n**孝** and **慈** were ever the **constant Dao** of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **proper path** of the family—\nWhy should they be so celebrated?\n\nYet when **三党六亲** were forgotten,\nAnd **逆** winds grew fierce,\nWhen **阋墙** strife was common,\nThose who could show **孝** or **慈**,\nThough few and far between,\nWere held in great reverence,\nAnd their deeds proclaimed to inspire the world.\n\nHow far this falls from the **Age of the Most High**,\nWhen **孝** was natural and **慈** unspoken—\nWhen even the **孝** and **慈** of today\nAre but **反**—a forced return to harmony,\nWhere men now but **粉饰** and **铺张**,\nClaiming **慈孝** while taking its name in vain—\nHow many such hypocrites could be counted?\n\nAnd after the **五霸**,\nWhen kin destroyed one another,\nWhen lords and ministers exchanged hostages,\nIt is no wonder\nThat **昏庸** rulers arose above,\nAnd **跋扈** ministers below—\nAnd the state has known no peace since then.\n\nFortunate are those with **忠肝义胆**,\nWho rise to **安邦定国**,\nThough success or failure may not be foreseen,\nTheir **尽瘁鞠躬** loyalty is clear.\nYet their strength cannot turn back the tide of fate,\nNor their resolve preserve the whole of the world—\nLike **Zhuge Liang**’s six campaigns at **Qishan**,\nOr **Jiang Banyao**’s nine assaults on the **Central Plains**.\n\nConsider the subject’s lot:\nTo serve a lord, they wish to be **良臣**,\nNot **忠臣**.\nIf fortune favors the land,\nThey may share in **同襄补衮**’s duties—\nYet if **强梁** wars rise again,\nEach must display their **济世** talents.\nWhen the world is **昏乱**,\nHeaven reveals the **忠臣**;\nWhen **忠臣** arise,\nHeaven sustains the **昏乱**.\n\nThough **忠臣** may emerge,\nEven if they could purge the **昏乱**,\nAnd turn the land from **干戈** to **礼义**—\nIt would still pale in comparison\nTo the **Age of the Most High**,\nWhen all was **无事** and distant from strife.\nAlas!\nThe **忠臣** would rather **终身埋没**,\nThan see their name proclaimed—\nFor one man’s **忠臣** title\nBrings the world’s share of **昏乱** woes—\nA sorrow too great to bear!\n\nThis is the **Most High**’s lament for the **Way** of the world,\nHis grief for the present, his thoughts for the past,\nDesiring men return to **朴** and embrace **真**,\nThat high and low alike be **无知**—\nTheir **virtue** unbroken,\nTheir **Way** ever sufficient,\n**熙熙皞皞**, all under Heaven at peace in **无事**,\nYet unaware of their own **Way**.\n\nEven **仁**, **義**, **智**, **慧**,\n**孝** sons, **忠** ministers—\nAll are seen as natural,\nUnknown as virtues,\nAnd to name them would be shameful—\nWhat greater **浑朴** could there be?\n\nThough this speaks of **治世**,\nIt applies no less to **修身**.\nThe opening line likens the **浑沦** customs,\nWhere **太朴** has yet to be carved,\nTo the **章贞** body,\nUnadorned yet perfect in its **Dao**’s mystery.\n\nIf one loses their **本来之天**,\nThen they must borrow from **先天阴阳** to restore it.\n**阴阳** are but **仁 and義**—\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**.\"*\n\nTo discern the **真** messages within the body’s **内外**,\nAnd to nurture with **智慧** as if plucked from emptiness—\nHere, purity is lost,\nAnd **后天**’s influences creep in,\nSo **伪妄** cannot be avoided.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"**智慧** arises, there is **great deception**.\"*\n\nAs for **采阴补阳**,\nIt is the means to **和** the **六根**’s discord,\nAnd bring them to **大定**—\nThe metaphor of **孝 and慈**.\n\nAnd **猛烹急炼**,\nThe way to **靖** the **昏乱** within oneself,\nAnd ascend to **清明**—\nThe essence of **\"loyal ministers\"**.\n\nKnow this, and the **Dao** is near.\nWhat deeper lesson does the **Most High** teach?\nNaught but to follow one’s **浑然粹然** Heavenly nature—\nAnd to cultivate it as such.»\n\nChapter Nineteen: *Few Private Affairs, Few Desires*\n\nTo discard **Dao/Way** and abandon **智**, the people’s benefit is a hundredfold;\nTo discard **仁** and abandon **義**, the people return to **孝** and **慈**.\n\nTo discard **巧** and abandon **利**, thieves and robbers vanish;\nThese three measures, though insufficient for **文**’s adornment,\nAre thus established to ensure their proper application:\n*\"Seeing the unadorned, embracing the unadulterated,\nFew private affairs, few desires,\nDiscarding learning, free from worry.\"*\n\nAmong all people and things under Heaven,\nThe wise and foolish, noble and humble—\nNone escape the fundamental principle of **理** and **氣**’s harmony.\n\nYet why do they remain divided and obstructed?\nWhy do passions clash and intentions stumble?\nIt is because those above lack what to inspire,\nAnd those below lack what to transform them.\n\nThe **至聖** sovereigns of old\nFollowed the **Dao/Way** of nature,\nPracticed the governance of **無為**,\nDid not delight in deeds for the sake of achievements,\nNor weary of duties and abandon governance.\n\nThough they possessed keen **聰明** and profound **睿智**,\nThey all entered the realm of **無為** governance,\nThe **清淨** domain of purity,\nWhere the people below, observing and transformed,\nNaturally honored their own kin,\nNurtured their own offspring,\nStabilized their customs,\nFound joy in their labors—\nWithout a single person failing to restore their **性**,\nWithout a single thing failing to fulfill its **生**,\nTheir benefit was indeed a hundredfold!\n\nAs for the **至仁** sovereigns,\nWho naturally embrace **慈善**’s essence,\nWho possess **恻隐** (*cìcè*) compassion—\nThey dedicate themselves entirely to benefiting others and nurturing all things.\n\n**浩浩荡荡**, **浑浑沦沦**,\nThey neither speak of right and wrong,\nNor of crooked and straight,\nBut instead let Heaven move them,\nAnd follow their **性** in action—\nNaturally without favor or bias,\nThey return to the realm of **大中至正**—\nThe Great Centrality of Rectitude.\n\nThe people, inspired and transformed by this,\nAs sons naturally become **孝** to their parents,\nAs fathers naturally become **慈** to their children.\nEven if there are those who are unfilial or unkind,\nWhose habits become rampant,\nThey too will gradually be transformed—\nHow splendid and flourishing this is!\n\nIn later ages, the most **聰明** and **敏捷** sovereigns,\nThough they govern the world and rule with skill,\nDo not comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s foundation of **無為**,\nAnd thus, if they follow it, it is easy;\nIf they oppose it, it becomes difficult.\n\nSome delight in constant change and disturb the people,\nCreating laws and regulations,\nOnly to bring calamity to the state,\nWhere the people barely survive.\nOthers love martial prowess and neglect governance,\nExhausting armies and waging wars,\nOnly to deplete the treasuries,\nWhere the people cannot endure—\nNo wonder then that the people grow impoverished,\nThe nation falls ill,\nAnd the winds of **攘窃劫奪** (*rǎngqièjiéduó*)—theft and plunder—rise,\nWhile thieves and robbers openly roam the land.\nSuch is the fate of those **至巧** sovereigns,\nWho do not know to apply their **巧** to the **無為** of Heaven,\nTo the **自在** of nature—\nWho seek to enrich the state through greed,\nOnly to weaken its strength,\nAnd unsettle the people’s customs.\n\nIf they could achieve **至巧無巧**—\nExpressing their hearts as they truly are,\nGuiding the **勢** in harmony,\nUpholding **義** without scheming for **利**,\nClarifying the **Dao/Way** without calculating **功**—\nThen the **德** of the **君子** would be the wind,\nAnd the **德** of the **小人** would be the grass—\nNaturally flowing downward like water,\nOr ascending like fire,\nWith an unstoppable force.\n\nWould there still be among the people\nThose who disregard **廉恥** (*liánchǐ*)—modesty and shame—\nWho become thieves and robbers,\nWho delight in wrongdoing?\nNone would.\n\nThis is the **大智若愚**—great wisdom as if foolishness—,\n**大仁若忍**—great virtue as if forbearance—,\n**大巧若拙**—great skill as if clumsiness—\nYet later generations view them as unfit to rule,\nUnfit to govern.\n\nHowever, the **聖德**’s pervasiveness,\nThe **仁恩**’s transformative power,\nThe **智巧**’s refined influence—\nThough lacking in outward **文**’s adornment,\nTheir **實質**—substance—is indeed profound.\n\n**理** and **欲** originally do not conspire,\nSufficiency in outward **文** breeds dissatisfaction within,\nReducing **文**’s excess enhances **實**’s abundance.\n\nThe **聖** discard **智**,\nThe **仁** discard **義**,\nThe **巧** discard **利**—\nAll to strengthen their **實**,\nAnd to remove **文**’s excess.\n\nThough the common people are **至愚**—utterly foolish—,\nThey always take the ruler’s actions as their guide for **去就**—departure and approach.\n\nThus, if one discards **華** (*huá*)—ornamentation—and upholds **實**,\nIt naturally unifies the **小民**’s hearts in the **本原**—origin—\nAnd leaves them **不雕不琢**—uncarved, unpolished.\n\nFor what they see is governance of **質實無文**—substance without adornment—\nAnd thus what they embrace\nIs the **太朴不凿** (*tàipǔbùzáo*)—unpierced Great Simplicity—of truth.\n\nIn such **浑完** naturalness,\nClothing and food are each in their **常**—proper measure—\nInteractions and exchanges\nFollow their **分**—natural roles.\n\nThough **氣禀** is limited,\nAnd private desires may occasionally sprout,\nThey are few and sparse.\n\nIn summary,\n**聖** and **仁** and **巧** are all **質**—substance—;\n**智** and **義** and **利** are all **文**—adornment.\n\nTo discard **聖** and abandon **智**,\nTo discard **仁** and abandon **義**,\nTo discard **巧** and abandon **利**—\nAll ensure **文** is insufficient,\nAnd **質** remains abundant,\nEach with its proper application.\n\nHow could the people, nourished by **德** and quenched by **和**,\nFail to benefit endlessly,\nTo see **孝** and **慈** flourish daily,\nAnd theft transformed into virtue?\nThis is the **隆盛** governance—\nA sight I have long failed to behold.\n\nThis metaphor illustrates the **修養** path—\nFirst, preserve the **心** and nurture the **性**;\nWhen **心** and **性** return to nature,\nThen the **後天**’s **精氣** also return to the **先天**’s **精氣**.\n\nIf one has not yet seen **性** and clarified **心**,\nAnd merely relies on **後天**’s **氣質**—constitution—\nAnd **知覺**—perception—of the **心** for use,\nThen the **精** belongs to the **凡精**—ordinary essence—,\nAnd the **氣** belongs to the **凡氣**—ordinary *qi*—,\nHow could one obtain the **真一**—true unity—of essence,\nThe **真一** of *qi* to forge the **丹**—elixir?\n\nThe practitioner must seek from the **本源**—original source—\nA **大本領**—great fundamental principle—,\nA **真頭腦**—true essence—\nTo serve as the master.\nThen, **煉精** (*liànjīng*) refining essence,\n**煉氣** (*liàngqì*) refining *qi*,\n**煉神** (*liàngshén*) refining spirit—\nAll become manifest.\n\nUnderstanding this meaning,\nOne not only comprehends the **《太上經》**—*Tàishàng Jīng* (Classic of the Most High)—,\nBut also grasps that governance and self-cultivation,\nIn every aspect, are a single thread—\nAnd that the **四書五經**—Four Books and Five Classics—\nAre none other than **丹經**—elixir scriptures.\n\nOther commentaries state that those in high positions,\nDiscarding **聖** and **智**,\nCause the people to know only **利**—profit—,\nAnd thus they flock to it a hundredfold;\nDiscarding **仁** and **義**,\nThe people do not know to love their kin,\nAnd thus they turn away from **孝** and **慈**—\nThis is to discard what should not be discarded,\nAnd the harm is as such.\n\nWhen it comes to the contradictions of clever profit, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—\nIf one can discard and abandon them,\nThen where would thieves and robbers arise?\nThis is what must be discarded and abandoned—\nAnd such is its effect.\n\nThis teaching is truly **\"high\"** indeed.\n\nThe three levels below this state:\nGovernance of the people need not rely on decrees—\nOnly that commands must originate from what is rooted in one’s own practice.\nTo see the unadorned is to know constancy;\nTo embrace the uncarved is to preserve the spirit.\nWith few desires and little private gain,\nThis is what is meant by \"having the world yet not partaking of it\"—\nHow could one without excess and without action attain this?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Distinct from Others**\n\nTo abandon learning is to have no worries.\nHow far apart are **\"yes\"** and **\"ah\"**?\nHow far apart are **good** and **evil**?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\n\nAh, its boundlessness knows no end!\n\nThe masses rejoice, feasting as if at a grand sacrifice,\nAscending as if to the Spring Terrace—\nYet I alone remain tranquil, unmarked,\nLike an infant yet unborn, still within the womb.\nBuoyant and unrestrained,\nAs if having nowhere to return—\nThe masses all have abundance,\nYet I alone seem forsaken.\n\nI alone possess the heart of the simple fool!\nMuddled, while the vulgar are clear—\nI alone am dim, while the vulgar are sharp.\nDull as the sea, unrestrained—\nLike the wind, without end.\n\nThe masses all have purpose,\nYet I alone am clumsy and crude.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I cherish the Mother’s nourishment.\n\nThe Sage’s attainment is supreme—\nCalled **\"Abandoning Learning\"**—\nPure and vital, flowing and unrestrained,\nWithout care, without thought.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The Most High watches over you—\nDo not let your heart be divided.\"*\n\nThus, one acts in one’s natural station,\nUnconcerned with poverty or wealth, gain or loss—\nNowhere does one not find self at ease,\nAnd so it is said: **\"No worries.\"**\n\nThis realm, compared to the unlearned and unskilled,\nIs as distant as heaven from an abyss—\nYet the gap is not so vast.\n\nLike an echo—\nThe same response—\nYet the direct **\"yes\"** and the flattering **\"ah\"** differ—\nThe response remains the same.\nBut the essence of the response—\nHow far apart can it truly be?\n\nFrom ancient times, the division between Sage and commoner\nLies only in good and evil—\nAnd the distinction between good and evil\nResides merely in reverence or insolence,\nA contest of but a single thought—\nHow far apart can they be?\n\nFor the human heart is perilous,\nAnd the **Dao**-heart is subtle—\nA hair’s breadth of difference leads to a thousand-li error.\nWhat people tremble to avoid,\nHow can I fail to fear what they fear?\n\nThus, from the very beginning,\nOne must gather the luminous spirit,\nReturning it to the undifferentiated—\nIn motion or stillness,\nAmidst change or constancy,\nAll as boundless as the primordial chaos,\nBefore Heaven and Earth were cleaved—\nVast and unrestrained,\nAs if the night had no end.\n\nThus, within there is a master,\nAnd external things do not disturb.\nWhen applied to governance and decrees,\nThe people naturally transform in joyous harmony.\n\nTo feed on the Sage’s virtue\nIs to feast as at a grand sacrifice;\nTo dwell in the Sage’s domain\nIs to ascend the Spring Terrace in delight.\nHow could this be compared to solitary cultivation in silent seclusion?\n\nThus, one’s merit fills the world yet knows no merit,\nOne’s actions fill the world yet knows no action.\nThe masses rejoice,\nYet I alone remain serene and undisturbed—\nFaint as an unborn babe,\nStill in the womb, a cluster of primordial *qi*,\nUndifferentiated and whole—\nAscending and descending, flowing without end,\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nYet unaware of its destination.\n\nWhile others act, I do not—\nThe masses have abundance to sustain them,\nYet I stand apart from the world, independent,\nFar beyond what others can attain.\n\nFrom their perspective, few would not call me foolish—\nYet when I reflect,\nI only feel my heart cleansed, hidden in secrecy,\nAt peace with Heaven, content with my fate—\nHow could this be the heart of a fool?\n\nIt is merely that great wisdom appears as folly,\nAnd great skill appears as clumsiness.\n\nOtherwise, how could one bring such joy to labor and contentment to residence,\nSo swiftly transforming hearts and spirits?\n\nThis is because the **Great Polarity** remains a boundless unity—\nMuddled as an unhatched egg,\nNo trace of yin or yang,\nNo knowledge at all.\n\nThe vulgar are clear in all things,\nYet I alone am dim, knowing nothing;\nThe vulgar are sharp in all things,\nYet I alone am confused, understanding nothing.\n\nAm I truly muddled and unaware,\nConfused and insensible?\nRather, it is to conceal one’s traces and dim one’s brilliance,\nNurturing clarity within profundity—\nDay by day, month by month,\nRefining the elixir through nine transformations,\nAttaining the Sage’s virtue,\nAnd becoming an immortal unchanging through the ages.\n\nIts grandeur in transformation\nIs like the obscurity of Heaven and Earth,\nEncompassing all phenomena within thought.\nIts subtlety and spirit\nAre like flowing clouds and water without end,\nNurturing all life within.\n\nFrom the outside, the masses all have purpose in the world,\nYet I alone am foolish and crude.\nWithin, the **Dao** is lofty and beautiful—\nA Sage who transcends the crowd, stands alone,\nAnd is unmatched by the world.\nThis is how I alone differ from others,\nAnd why I am beyond what others can attain.\n\nFor the commoner is scattered in external pursuits,\nLosing their original nature.\nThe Sage nurtures within,\nPreserving their inherent essence.\n\nThe Sage differs from the commoner—\nAll because they return to the **Primordial** from the **Later-Heaven**.\nFor the **Later-Heaven** is **emotion**—child *qi*;\nThe **Primordial** is **nature**—mother *qi*.\nReturning from emotion to nature,\nIt is as if the child clings to the mother,\nReluctant to part.\nThus it is said: **\"Cherish the Mother’s nourishment.\"**\n\nMencius said: **\"The Way of learning and inquiry is nothing else but seeking to restore one’s lost heart.\"**\n\nThe distinction between the Sage and the commoner lies in a single moment—\nthe Dao is not distant, is it?\nThe method is not complex, is it?\nIf one seeks to cultivate the Dao,\nyet does not seek it in the **Primordial** and **Later-Heaven** interval where **qi** is pure and unmanifest,\nwhere else should they exert their efforts?\nThus it is said:\n**\"The Mysterious Mother, the Mysterious Mother—\nthe true Mysterious Mother!\nNot in the heart, nor in the kidneys.\nTrace the origin of life and the reception of fate—\ndo not blame the **Heavenly Mechanism** for being fully drained!\"**\n\nWhat is the origin of life and the reception of fate?\nReflect upon this,\nand the Dao is already half attained.\n\nFirst, it is spoken of that the Sage transcends learning.\nHaving attained **constant joy** and **inner stillness**,\nthey bear no worries.\nIn daily life and practice,\nall returns to the **Primordial Heaven** of **mixed chaos**.\nUncarved and unpolished,\nunstained and unsoiled—\nthis is what is meant by:\n**\"Gazing upward, its heights are boundless,\nmaking it impossible to measure—\ntruly beyond reach!\"**\nYet though their cultivation reaches such extremes,\nthe true divide lies only in the distinction between **reverence** and **heedlessness**.\n\nCan one fear its unfathomable depth\nand still hesitate to proceed?\nYanzi said:\n**\"Who was Shun? Who am I?\nEven those with deeds are such as this!\"**\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nYet it is not the **empty foolishness** of idle learning,\nnor the absence of worldly achievements.\nThe Sage attains **self-clarification of virtue** and **renews the people**,\nenabling all living beings to **feast on virtue** and **drink harmony**,\nto **play and frolic in the radiant Heaven beneath the sun and moon**.\nWhat Dao is this?\nThe Dao of **utter sincerity** and **exhausting one’s inherent nature**—\nthe **nature of humanity** and the **nature of things**.\n\nAh!\nTo exhaust one’s nature to this extent—\nwhat further learning is there?\nIt is but the **nourishment of the Mother’s qi**.\n\n**Chapter 21: The Vessel of Confucian Virtue**\n\nThe **vessel of Confucian virtue** follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao, as a thing,\nis **dim and indistinct**,\n**indistinct and vague**.\nVague and indistinct—\nyet within, there are **forms**.\nIndistinct and dim—\nyet within, there are **things**.\n**Deep and dark**—\nyet within, there is **essence**.\nIts essence is most true—\nyet within, there is **faith**.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nits name never fades—\nit **pervades all beings**.\n\nHow do I know the state of all beings?\n**By this.**\nThe **vessel of Confucian virtue** is the **Mysterious Pass** itself.\nThe ancients said:\n**\"The Mysterious Pass—one orifice—\nunites Heaven and Earth.\nWithin it lies the **cavern of divine qi**,\nnamed the **Kan-Li Essence**.\"**\nAnd again:\n**\"The Mysterious Pass—one orifice—\nthe grand Dao’s gate.\nHere, lead is transmuted, and cinnabar is forged.\"**\n*The Classic of Changes_ says:\n**\"This law of the two orifices,\nthe gold-qi also follows.\"**\nHence, the Dao speaks of **\"the Mysterious Mother’s Gate\"**, the Confucian scholars of **\"the Gate of Rightness and Principle\"**, and the Buddhists of **\"the Gate of Non-Duality\"**.\n\nIn sum, all are the **vessel of Confucian virtue** that can contain:\nHeaven, Earth, humanity, and all things—\nall arise from within it.\nIt is neither **void** nor **non-void**,\nnor **non-Dao**—\n**void and Dao are one**.\nVoid and Dao are inseparable.\nWithout void, there is no Dao;\nwithout Dao, there is no void.\nThus it is said:\n**\"It follows only the Dao.\"**\nIf one seeks the Dao,\nand abandons this **void vessel**—\nwhere else should they go?\n\nBut if one remains in mere **voidness without form**,\nit is **empty foolishness**—\nhow then can the scholar gather **medicinal herbs** or forge **cinnabar**?\nThey must **hold emptiness while encompassing utter reality**,\n**be void yet contain all things**—\nonly then does it not become a **one-sided learning**.\n\nThe practitioner, having cast aside all **ten thousand entanglements**,\nnurtures stillness for a moment,\nand **observes this orifice**—\nvague as if without substance,\nindistinct as if with form.\nIn the **depth of emptiness and sincerity of stillness**,\nthe **divine mechanism** moves—\nthe **formless bears form**.\n\nThis is the **radiance of the Primordial** within,\nthe **flux of wood and fire**’s **forms**—\nthe **awakening of the subtle yang** in its time.\n\nAgain, with this **divine light’s momentary movement**,\none **contains the radiance of the eyes** and gazes downward—\nvague as if aware,\nindistinct as if without knowledge—\nwithin, the **yang substance** stirs—\nthis is the **Primordial radiance** first intersecting with the **Kan Palace**.\n\nAt that time, the **qi mechanism** is weak,\nunable to be gathered—\nonly the **two methods** of **adjusting and gathering the Buddha’s law**,\nand **refining the lurking yin-qi**,\ncan meet within the **qi cavern**.\n**Adjusting and gathering** is one method,\n**returning to the furnace for nourishment** is another.\n\nFollowing the law in practice,\nwithout pause—\n**fire enters the water’s depths**,\n**gold is born within the water**,\n**obscure and dark**—\none knows not its limits—\nthis is when the **divine qi** intersects,\nand the **Kan-Li Essence** is generated.\n\nYet when the **true essence** is born,\nthe body stands as if **erect against a wall**,\nthe mind is like **cold ashes**—\nnaturally, the whole body feels **softened and joyous**,\nthe **precise qi** of limbs and organs\nall return to the **Mysterious Orifice**.\nWithin, there is great **faith**—\n**melting like ice**, **vast like tides rising**.\n\nThis is not like before,\nwhen it was **vague as if with awareness**,\n**indistinct as if without knowledge**—\nunnameable.\nThis **true essence** is indeed the **true One Essence**,\nnot the **Later-Heaven**’s **intercourse-generated essence**—\nit cannot be compared.\nIt is also the **original essence** of Heaven, Earth, humanity, and all things—\nthe **common true essence** from which all arise.\n\nLike the **yang at Winter Solstice**,\nor the **child at midnight**—\nthe **achievement of a year in one day**,\nthough not limited to this,\nthe **qi mechanism** must all begin here.\nJust as the **thousand-layered terrace** begins with **piling earth**,\nor the **ten-thousand-li journey** begins with **the first step**—\nthis is the **root of Heaven, Earth, and humanity’s** **eternal generation**.\nIf the **root differs**, the **endless branches**—\nwhat limits are there?\n\nHence, from ancient times to now,\nall who cultivate the Dao\nnever depart from this **gathering of true qi**—\nonly then does the **symbol of generation** appear.\nAll things in their **initial arising**,\nshare this **one true essence**—\nforming **symbols** and **bodies**.\nHow do I know all things share this essence?\n**By this:**\nWithin the **void orifice**,\nthe **true qi** accumulates—\nwith time, the **Mysterious Pass opens**,\nand the **true essence** is born.\n\nIn essence,\n**vague** is the **dense radiance**,\n**indistinct** is the **subtle mechanism**.\nThe **Primordial yin** within—\nthis is the **substance** of **vague and indistinct**.\n\n「坎中真阳，是为杳冥中之精。\nWithin the **Kan abyss**, the **true yang**—this is the **elusive and profound essence**.\n\n学者必知之真，而后行之至也。\nOne must first know the **true**,\nthen practice it to its utmost.\n\n此恍兮惚是性光发越，故云“有象”；\nThis **vague** and **indistinct**—\nits **innate luminous virtue** ascends beyond,\nthus it is said to have **\"symbols\"**.\n\n惚兮恍是以性光下照坎宫，而真阳发动，故云“有物”。\nThis **indistinct** and **vague**—\nits **innate luminous virtue** descends to illuminate the **Kan Palace**,\nand the **true yang** stirs into motion,\nthus it is said to have **\"bodies\"**.\n\n窈冥之精，乃二五之精，故云甚真。\nThe **elusive and profound essence**—\nthis is the **Five Phases’ true essence**,\nthus it is called **most true**.\n\n欲得真精，须知真信。\nTo obtain the **true essence**,\none must first grasp **true faith**.\n\n真信者，阴阳迭运，不失其候之调，俟其信之初至，的当不易，即行擒伏之功得矣。\n**True faith**—\nwhen **yin** and **yang** alternate in their courses,\none does not fail to observe their proper **signs and rhythms**.\nAwaiting the **true essence**’s first arrival,\nseize it firmly without hesitation,\nand the **capturing and subduing** practice is achieved.\n\n凡人修炼之初，必要恍惚杳冥，而后人欲净尽，天理常存，凡息自停，真息乃见。\nAt the outset of cultivation,\nall must pass through **vague and indistinct, elusive and profound**—\nthen the **human desires** are purified and exhausted,\nwhile **Heavenly principle** remains constant.\nThe **ordinary breaths** cease naturally,\nand the **true breath** emerges.\n\n此何以故？\nWhy is this so?\n\n盖人心太明，知觉易生。\nIt is because the **human heart** is too bright,\nand **awareness** arises easily.\n\n若到杳冥，知觉不起，即元性元命，打成一片。\nYet when one reaches **elusive and profound**,\n**awareness** does not stir—\nthen **original nature** and **original life** merge as one.\n\n此个恍惚杳冥，大为修士之要。\nThis **vague and indistinct, elusive and profound**—\nit is the **most vital** for the cultivator.\n\n学人当静定之时，忽然偶生知觉，此时神气凝聚丹田，浑然精然，自亦不知其所之，此性命返还于无极之天也。\nWhen the **student** sits in **stillness and calm**,\nsuddenly **awareness** arises,\nat which point **spirit-qi** condenses in the **Elixir Field**,\npure and undivided—\none does not even know where it goes.\nThis is when **nature and life** return to the **limitless Heaven**.\n\n虽然外有是理，而丹田中必有融和气机，方为实据。\nThough externally this **principle** exists,\nwithin the **Elixir Field**, there must be **harmonized qi-machinery**,\nonly then is it **true foundation**.\n\n由此一点融和，采之归炉，封固温养，自能发为真阳一气。\nFrom this **single point of harmonization**,\ngather it and return it to the **Furnace**,\nseal it firmly and nurture it warmly—\nit will naturally **emanate as true yang qi**.\n\n但行功到此，大有危险。\nYet when one’s practice reaches this point,\n**great danger** looms.\n\n惟有一心内守，了照当中，方能团结为丹药，可以长生不老。\nOnly by **single-heartedly guarding internally**,\nand **illuminatingly penetrating the center**,\ncan one **congeal it into elixir**, achieving **longevity and immortality**.\n\n若生一它念，此个元气，即已杂后天而不纯矣。\nIf one **harbors another thought**,\nthis **original qi** will be **mingled with postnatal influences** and become impure.\n\n若动一淫思，此个气机即驰于外，而真精从此泄漏矣。\nIf one **stirs even one lustful thought**,\nthis **qi-machinery** will **bolt outward**,\nand the **true essence** will **leak away** from here.\n\n古人云：泄精一事，不必夫妻交媾，即此一念之动，真精已不守舍，如走丹一般。\nThe ancients said:\n**\"Leaking essence\"**—\nit need not involve **husband-wife copulation**;\neven the stir of **one thought**,\nand the **true essence** no longer **resides in its home**,\nlike **fugitive cinnabar** in flight.\n\n学人必心与气合，息与神交，常在此腔子里，久之，自有无穷趣味生来。\nThe **student** must **unite heart and qi**,\n**intermingle breath and spirit**,\never abiding in this **chamber**—\nwith time, **endless joys** will naturally arise.\n\n然而真难事也；\nYet truly, this is **no easy matter**.\n\n设能识透玄机，亦无难事。」\nIf one can **penetrate and discern the profound mechanism**,\nthen there is **no difficulty**.\n\nAt first, one merely employs the method of **lifting and gathering**—\nthis **true qi** must not **bolt downward**,\nnor must it **scatter through the six orifices**.\nIt is all about **one-heartedly returning to the command**,\n**five-bodied sincerity**.\n\nWith time, the **essence will naturally fill**—\nno longer craving **color**.\n\nI wish the **student** would **preserve the original essence**,\n**not allowing even a drop to leak**.\n\nAt first, **constant practice along the familiar Dao** seems difficult;\nbut if one **endures again and again**,\n**not permitting even a thought to stir**,\nwithin **three months**, the **external yang will naturally withdraw**.\n\nWhen the **external yang is withdrawn**,\nthen one perceives the **original qi** within the body **abundant**—\nand thus the **immortal, ageless sage** is attained.\nWhat is **sagehood**, if it is so distant?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: \"Complete and Return\"**\n*\"Crooked, yet whole;\nBent, yet straight;\nHollow, yet full;\nWorn, yet renewed;\nFew, yet gain;\nMany, yet confused.\"*\n\nThus the **Sage** embraces **Oneness** as the model for the world.\nNot seeing oneself, yet **clear**;\nNot asserting oneself, yet **illuminated**;\nNot boasting of oneself, yet **accomplished**;\nNot vaunting oneself, yet **enduring**.\n\nOnly because one **does not contend**,\nthe world cannot contend with them.\n\nWhat the ancients called **\"crooked, yet whole\"**—\nwas it empty speech?\n**Truly, it is complete and returned.**\n\nThe **essence of the Great Dao** must **reach the void while containing the full**;\n**reverse the full to realize the void**—\nonly then is it the **Dao of dual cultivation of nature and life**.\n\nFor **nature is originally void**—\nvoid arising from the full;\n**life is truly full**—\nfull arising from the void.\n\nIf one **fixes on emptiness**, it becomes **stubborn voidness**;\nif one **fixes on the full**, it becomes **entangled in names and forms**.\nEven if it does not **degenerate into absurd, unorthodox claims**,\nit is still **one-sided learning**—\nin the end, it cannot equal the **Great Dao**.\n\nThe **practitioner** must first **lay down all entanglements**,\n**free from even a speck of dust**,\nand within **absolute nothingness**,\n**seek out a spark of vitality** to serve as the **elixir’s foundation**.\nThe ancients called this **true yang**,\nor **true lead**,\nor **the true One-qi**.\n\nThe **Taoist Canon** says *\"crooked, yet whole\"*—\nmeaning within the **hidden recesses of the body**,\nin the **solitary knowing and solitary awareness**,\nthere exists a **wholly undivided, lively, and flowing mechanism**.\nBy **nurturing and refining** this,\none can attain **elixir completion and sagehood**.\n\nThe ancients likened it to the **slightest line of yang at Winter Solstice**,\nwhich **generates endlessly**.\nOr the **slim crescent of the new moon on the third day**,\ngradually waxing to the **full moon on the fifteenth**—\nall are expressions of **\"crooked, yet whole.\"**\n\nFor **crooked is hidden**—\nin the **subtle depths**, its **mechanism is subtle**,\nyet its **fulfillment is vast**.\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"Crooked can possess\"*—\ntruly so.\n\nWithin this **single crook**,\nthere is nothing but the **origin of principle and qi**;\nwithin this **whole body**,\nit is the **essence of the Great Ultimate**—\nthus, *\"crooked, yet whole.\"*\n\nThe **Sage** found this crook,\n**diligently and cautiously**,\n**cycling and embracing**, like a hen brooding,\nlike a dragon guarding its pearl—\n**one-heartedly guarding within**, not allowing it to **leak outward**.\n\nWith time, it **swells like the tide**,\n**rising and stretching upward**,\na **single current of clear, rigid qi**,\n**boldly ascending** beyond sun and moon,\n**encompassing** heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Kun* hexagram says:\n*\"Kun is supremely yielding, yet in movement, it is rigid\"*—\nall from the **aftermath of bending**,\n**hidden in the earthen vessel**,\n**accumulating until it overflows the heavens**,\n**bursting forth uncontrollably**—\nsuch is its nature.\n\nMoreover, **bent becomes yin, becomes yielding**—\nthis is the same qi;\n**straight becomes yang, becomes rigid**—\nalso this same qi.\nThough it is said *\"from bent to straight\"*, in truth,\n**it is both bent and straight**.\n\nAfter **piercing the source from within the hidden crook**,\nits **manifestation becomes easy**,\nbut **guarding it is difficult**.\n\nOnly by **resting in ease, drifting in play**,\n**nurturing its subtle traces**,\n**lowering oneself to serve others**,\n**humbling oneself in self-regard**,\ncan one **avoid the nature of haste and violence**,\n**not generate deluded views**,\n**not stir the vulgar fire**—\nonly then can **golden elixir** be formed.\n\nThus, **spirit governs qi**,\n**qi unites with spirit**,\n**hidden and revealed without trace**,\n**transformation beyond measure**—\n**\"utter sincerity without pause**,\n**embodying things without omission**,\n**present everywhere yet nowhere\"**—\nhow **full** it is!\n\nYet one must **be humble to receive benefit**,\n**hollow to become full**.\nOtherwise, how could one **embrace all things**?\n\nMuch less this **subtle crook**—\nall originally **our own substance**—\nwhat is called **\"worn\"**—\n**worn is the old**.\n\nAs the *Zhongyong* says: *\"Temper the old to know the new.\"*\nThe **student** who seeks **new growth to generate new ideas**,\nif not by **nurturing this old substance**,\nhow could they **know the new**?\nThis is also **\"worn, yet renewed.\"**\n\nThough **wornness is scarce**,\nif one **nurtures it from its fewness**,\nthe **vast qi** can **fill heaven and earth**, **pierce the Horns of the Bull**.\nIf one claims the **Dao is vast, encompassing all**,\nand **takes from its abundance**,\nI fear **desire and principle will be mixed**,\n**good and evil indistinguishable**—\nsometimes **holding to the middle**,\nsometimes **gathering herbs**,\nsometimes **advancing fire, withdrawing talismans**,\n**fixating on forms, grasping names**—\nthe more, the better—\nyet it remains **rootless learning**,\n**unable to return to stillness**,\nultimately a **tangled knot**.\n\nNo wonder one **spends a lifetime in doubt, yet never awakens**.\n\nThe **Sage** cultivates **Oneness** for themselves,\nand applies it to the world,\nas a **model for all**.\nIf one does not know that the **Dao of the crook** is truly the **unifying Dao**,\nand **occasionally strays**—\n**once strayed, there is no model**,\n**no model, no attainment**—\nwhat reliance is there on the **Dao**?\n\nThe **Dao is originally the unified principle of heaven and humanity**,\n**all things and self**—\na **common substance**.\nYet today’s scholars **each cling to their own views**,\nclaiming none surpass them—\nthis **arrogant pride** alone\nalready **obscures the luminous clarity**,\nwhile they fail to **measure the ancient against the present**,\n**take the superior as their standard**.\n\nThe *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The Dao of the **Noble** shines **dimly yet clearly**;\nthe Dao of the **petty** shines **brightly yet perishes.\"*\n\n「Indeed, the **Dao of the sincere cultivator** is something to be held with **solemn reverence**. Even if one approaches the **transformation into the divine** (*shénhuà*),\nit is merely what one ought to do and what one ought to fulfill—\nwhy must one **boast to the world** and **exaggerate one’s merits**?\nIf one **praises oneself**,\nnot only will one be **despised by others**,\nbut the **merits themselves will be false and not true**.\n\nThe ancients, having attained their **merits**, withdrew humbly—\nthey **never claimed credit** for their deeds,\n**truly covering the world with their virtue** and becoming **teachers for all ages**.\nAs for **self-cultivation and self-forging** (*zìxiū zìliàn*),\nit is like **clothing that brings warmth** or **food that satiates hunger**—\nall are **self-acquired joys**,\nand yet, they are **what others also possess and find sufficient**.\nWhy must one **swagger with arrogance** and **pretend to be great**,\n**boasting of one’s strengths**?\nThough it is said that **wisdom grows daily** and **cleverness expands each day**,\nthis is merely **what all humans share**—\nI have simply **attained it first**;\nwhere is the **true length** of it?\n\nIf one **boasts of one’s strengths**,\nthen one’s **strengths will become weaknesses**.\nEven the most **foolish of men**—\nwho would willingly **lag behind**?\nWhere do **disputes** not begin from here?\nThe **Noble** has **no place for contention**,\nso the world cannot **contend with their power**.\nThe ancients spoke of **\"crook/turning brings completeness\"** (*qǔ zé quán*)—\ntruly, this is not **empty talk**,\nbut refers to **one who fully receives and fully returns** the **Dao**?\nThis is the **unifying Dao** (*Zhōngyōng*), or next, the **Dao of the crook/turning** (*qǔ*), which can **sincerely embody the Dao**.\nThe **crook/turning** is the **hidden crook** (*yǐnqǔ*), the **Dao** calls it **\"mysterious orifice\"** (*Xuánqiào*),\nthe **Buddha** names it **\"that\"** (*nàge*),\nand the **Confucian** refers to it as **\"the origin and traces\"** (*duānní*).\nYet it is **not empty nor without substance**—\na **single point** from which **all things and beings** arise.\n\nWhen **heaven and earth opened** (*kāipì*) and **figures began to emerge** (*wùrén shǐshēng*),\nall originated from this **one point**,\nand its **movement and stillness** are visible at all times.\nWhen it **stays still and begins to manifest**,\nit does not arise from **external stimulation**.\nSuddenly **awakened**,\nthis **awakening itself is the crook/turning** (*qǔ*).\nWhen it **moves and displays its form**,\nit arises from **spontaneous resonance** (*gǎnfú*).\nSuddenly **stirred**,\nthis **stirring itself is the crook/turning**.\n\nEssentially, it is when one is **in ignorance and unawareness**,\nand the **qi-mechanism** (*qìjī*) moves **spontaneously**—\n**moving and suddenly awakening**—\nthis is **true movement and true awakening**.\nBut its **mechanism is extremely subtle**,\nits **timing swiftest**—\na **mere shift in thought** or **change in breath**,\nand it already belongs to **postnatal cultivation** (*hòutiān*),\n**unable to serve as the root of life** for all things and beings,\n**nor as the foundation for refining the elixir** (*liàn dān*).\nHumans receive **qi** and form **bodies** (*chéngxíng*),\nbecome **people and things** (*wùrén*),\nall from this **single thought** (*yī niàn*) that **branches into myriad forms** (*fēn tāi*).\nThe **right and wrong paths of cultivation** (*xiédào*),\nthe **true and false nature of the Dao**—\nwhich does not originate from this **single thought**?\n\nThe *Zhōushū* says:\n*\"**Erroneous thoughts lead to madness** (*wàng niàn zuò kuáng*),\n**overcoming thoughts leads to sainthood** (*kè niàn zuò shèng*).\"*\nThe **difference between sainthood and madness** lies in **a single thought**—\nso swift, so decisive!\nThis is what **\"crook/turning\"** (*qǔ*) truly means.\nThe ancients likened it to **a flash of lightning or a spark of stone fire** (*diàn guāng shíhuǒ*),\nor **a steed galloping a thousand li without leaving dust** (*qiān lǐ jì zú*).\nAt this moment, one must have **a bright pearl of wisdom** (*zhìzhū lǎngzhào*),\nonly then can one **recognize it clearly**.\n\nHaving **grasped this origin and trace** (*duānní*),\none must still **nurture and expand** it—\nas **Mencius** said:\n*\"Fire just begins to burn*,\n*the spring just begins to flow*—\n**vast and blazing** (*hào hào yán yán*),\n**naturally filling heaven and earth** (*tiān dì*).\"*\nYet the **way of nurturing and expansion**—\nis there truly another?\nIf one **does not bend and humble oneself** (*wǎng qū zìchí*),\nthen one’s **true qi cannot stretch** (*zhèngqì bù néng chángshēn*).\nIf one **does not lower and abase oneself** (*bēi wā zìxià*),\nthen one’s **heavenly virtue cannot be complete** (*tiāndé bù néng chángyuán*).\nOnly by **guarding the original substance within oneself and all things** (*shǒu wú shēn*),\n**not engaging nor separating** (*bù cān bù èr*),\n**warming the old** (*wēn qí gù*),\n**embracing the one** (*bào yī qí*),\n**not seeking novelty in new ends** (*bù qiú zhī yú xīn yīng zhī duān*),\n**nor indulging in the proliferation of names and forms** (*bù chǐ zhī yú míng xiàng zhī fán*),\ncan one **avoid becoming more confused with each day of learning**,\nand instead **find joy in the ceaseless renewal** (*rìxīn yòu xīn*).\n\nThe **ancient sages** knew that the **crook/turning** (*qǔ*) is the **stage for attaining immortality and sainthood** (*chéngxiān zhèngshèng*),\nso they **embraced the divine and relied on qi** (*shén bào qì*),\n**qi followed the divine and divine-qi merged as one without separation** (*qì yī shén, shén qì hé yī bù lí*),\nas the **essence of self-cultivation** (*zìxiū zhī yào*),\nand as the **model for all under heaven** (*tiānxià zhī shì*).\nIf one **only sees oneself and insists on one’s own views** (*zì jiàn zì shì*),\nthen one **obscures the luminous clarity** (*mèi qí míng ér bù zhāng*),\nlet alone **praises oneself and claims credit** (*zì fǎ ér bù zhēn*),\n**boasts of strengths and ignores weaknesses** (*zì jīn ér duǎn ér bù cháng*).\n**Wisdom arising from emotions** (*zhì qǐ qíng shēng*)\noften **becomes the Dao’s greatest harm**.\nOnly by **not seeing oneself nor insisting on one’s own views**,\n**not praising oneself nor boasting of strengths**,\ncan one’s **mind be level and qi harmonious** (*xīn píng qì hé*),\n**naturally avoiding evil in others** (*bìmǐ wū è*),\n**and corruption in oneself** (*cǐlǐ wú cuì*),\nso who could **contend with them**?\n\nThe **Dao’s subtle and silent influence** (*qián yí mòqì*) is such—\nunless one **embraces the one** (*bào yī*) and **fully receives and fully returns** the **Dao** (*quán shòu quán guī*),\nhow can one **return to the primal origin** (*fǎn qí tàishǐ zhī chū*)?\n\n**Chapter 23: Rare Words, Naturalness**\nRare words, naturalness.\nThus, **gusts of wind do not last all morning**,\n**sudden rains do not last all day**.\nWho is responsible for this?\n**Heaven and earth**.\nEven **heaven and earth cannot endure long**,\nlet alone **humans**?\nTherefore, those who **pursue the Dao**:\n—**those who align with the Dao** (*tóng yú dào zhě*) are **in harmony with the Dao** (*dào yě lè dé zhī*),\n—**those who align with virtue** (*tóng yú dé zhě*) are **in harmony with virtue** (*dé yě lè dé zhī*),\n—**those who align with loss** (*tóng yú shī zhě*) are **in harmony with loss** (*shī yě lè dé zhī*).\n**Truly, there is no joy in being unaligned** (*xìn bùzú yān, yǒu bùxìn yān*).\nThe **Dao originally has no sound nor breath** (*wú shēng wú xī*),\nso it is called **\"rare words\"** (*xī yán*).\nThe **Dao originally has no action nor doing** (*wú wéi wú zuò*),\nso it is called **\"naturalness\"** (*zìrán*).\n\nWhat **things can endure** and **affairs can last**?\nNone but those that **follow heaven’s movement** (*shùn tiān ér dòng*),\n**act in accordance with their nature** (*shuài xìng yǐ xíng*),\nand **listen to the qi-mechanism’s spontaneous operation** (*yī tīng qìjī zhī zìyùn*).\nIf one **forces and contrives** (*jiǎo niǔ zào zuò*),\n**unable to follow the qi-mechanism** (*bù néng shùn qí jī*),\nand **cannot conform to the revolutions of heaven and earth** (*hé yīn qián kūn zhī yùn zhuǎn*),\nthe **rising and setting of the sun and moon** (*rìyuè zhī shēng héng*),\nthen one’s **efforts will be like fleeting winds over boiling water** (*piāo táng zhī fēng*),\n**violent rains** (*kuáng bào zhī yǔ*),\n**uprooting great trees** (*bó dà mù*),\n**flooding flat plains** (*yǒng píng chuān*),\n**coming swiftly and departing swiftly**—\ntheir **force could not possibly last all day or all morning**!\n\nYet who is responsible for this?\nAsk **heaven and earth**, and they **do not know**.\n**Heaven and earth** are the **masters of all things** (*wànwù zhī zhǔzǎi*),\nyet even they **cannot endure long** if they **do not follow their natural ways** (*bù shùn qí cháng*).\nHow much more so for **humans**, who are **like a single grain in the great granary** (*tài cāng yī sù*)?\nWho could **endure long** by **not following the Dao of constancy**?\n\nThus, the **Greatest Sage** (*Tàishàng*) spoke of the **source of the Dao**,\n**taking non-action as its core** (*wúwéi wéi zōng*),\nand **naturalness as its application** (*zìrán wéi yòng*).\nIf one **does not pursue this**,\nbut instead **boasts of shortcuts** (*qiā kuài jìng*),\n**seeks out divine wonders** (*lìng xù shénqí*),\none is **misguided**!\nLook at those who **pursue the Dao**—\nthough they may be **far apart in the four directions** (*dōng xī nán běi zhī yáo*),\nand their **teachings differ** (*shēngjiào gè yì*),\nyet if they **have a resolve for the Dao** (*yǒu zhì yú dào*),\nand **do not stray into false paths** (*bù rù xiétú*),\nthey **all converge seamlessly without gap**.\n\nTo walk the Dao and gain insight in one’s heart is called **virtue** (*dé*).\nOnce one knows how to cultivate the Dao,\n**virtue** naturally arises within.\nAll who clearly manifest their **virtue**,\nfree from distraction and strife,\nfind themselves in silent accord as one.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nthose who align with **virtue** are one with **virtue**—\nwhat wonder is there in this?\"*\n\nAt the outset of practice,\ncultivation follows **Dao** and **virtue**,\ntracks and norms are observed,\neffortless and unburdened, free from entanglement.\nWhen one reaches the stage of profound self-realization,\nsettled in ease and depth,\nresources flow effortlessly in all directions—\nwhat was once gained now seems lost,\nas pure effort fuses into oneness,\nlike crafting a wheel behind closed doors,\nonly to find it fit perfectly upon emergence—\nall is unified.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who lose are one with loss.\"*\n\nThese three stages reflect differing levels of attainment,\neach progressing along distinct paths.\nYet with prolonged effort and endurance through hardship,\neven suffering transforms into serene ease,\nabundant with delight—\nspontaneously, one’s true nature unfolds.\nWhen suffering is exhausted, what joy knows bounds!\nThus it is said:\n*\"Those who align with the Dao find the Dao delights in them;\nthose who align with **virtue** find **virtue** delights in them;\nthose who align with loss find loss delights in them.\"*\n\nFor the essence of **non-action** is what all may cultivate,\nand the art of **naturalness** is what all may employ.\nEven sages of ten thousand *li* or gods of ten thousand years—\nthough time and place may shift—\nnaturally converge as if seals fitting together,\nall returning to the same path.\n\nIf one claims **naturalness** is not thus,\nthen bias clouds the mind,\nand divergent methods arise within.\nSome cling rigidly to the concrete, stubbornly fixed,\nothers cling to emptiness, practicing solitary stillness.\nSuch cases are countless—\nall stem from failing to trust the principle of **non-action**,\nthe Dao of **naturalness**,\nand instead clinging to their own views as truth.\n\nNo wonder those who begin young in the Dao\nfind no fruition in their later years—\ntheir resolve outstrips their learning,\nand they spend their lives never grasping the true meaning,\nstraying into false paths.\nHow tragic!\nHow lamentable!\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao of non-action and naturalness**—\nthe same that governs heaven and earth, sun and moon,\nthe unseen and the spirits of the dead.\nAll follow this principle:\nnon-action and naturalness,\nletting birth unfold as it will,\nserving their purpose and acting as they must.\n\nYet ordinary people, once born,\nexhaust their wit and cunning day and night—\nhow much of their innate nature remains intact?\nOnly those of lofty **Dao** follow nature’s constant way.\n\nThough their early efforts may require striving,\nonce perfected, they return to the realm of non-action and naturalness—\neffortless, as if attained without thought,\nachieved without strain,\nmoving naturally along the **Way**.\n\nThus, when sages observe the Great **Dao**,\nits principle of non-action and naturalness\nshines clearly before all eyes,\nunspoken yet universally understood.\nBut for later generations viewing the Great **Dao**,\nits attainment seems reserved only for sages and immortals—\ncommon folk dare not speak of it.\n\n*The Zhongyong* says:\n*\"Strive in learning, struggle in effort—\nsuccess brings unity.\"*\nIs this mere deceit?\nNo.\n\nThe origin lies in a heart that initially lacks faith,\nentering through the path of **non-Dao**,\nand as time progresses, it grows ever more distant and estranged—\nthus, the **Way** of non-action and naturalness\ncannot be fully shared,\nand distinctions arise, dividing as if into separate households.\nThose who study must understand this,\nlest they be misled by peripheral **Dao** and false paths.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\n*Those who stand on tiptoe cannot stand,*\n*those who stride cannot walk;*\n*those who seek self-visibility remain blind,*\n*those who insist on self-righteousness fail to shine;*\n*those who boast of their own merits gain no true achievement,*\n*those who vaunt their own virtues do not endure.*\nIn regard to the **Way**,\nthey are but gluttonous excess and burdensome exertion.\nSince others may detest this,\nthose who truly follow the **Way** do not dwell upon it.\n\nEarlier, it was said that the **Way** is rare in its naturalness—\nnot like the world’s coarse and dull masses,\nwho mistake recklessness for non-action,\nand abandon for naturalness.\nYet, its essence is the Great **Dao** of perfect balance,\nconforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,\nfollowing the sages’ **virtue** and the sovereign’s **Way**,\npreserving and reflecting inward,\nreturning to the root and restoring the origin—\nthus, aligning above with Heaven’s decree,\nit achieves non-action yet nothing remains undone,\nand naturalness without deviation.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Exhaust the principles, fulfill innate nature,\nand reach the realm of fate.\"*\nIs this not the ideal?\n\nExcess is a disease,\nand insufficiency is also a disease.\nThe *Shujing* states:\n*\"Without bias or faction,\nthe sovereign’s **Way** flows vast and unrestricted.\"*\nThis is exactly so.\n\nEven in human posture,\nthere exists an unchanging norm.\n*Standing on tiptoe* means two feet propped up—\nas the *Shijing* says:\n*\"I stand on tiptoe, gazing at you,\"*\nusing this posture to observe others allows one to survey the horizon,\nbut if one seeks to stand long,\nhow can it be sustained?\n*Striding* means two feet stretched wide—\nto mount a horse, one may rest upon the saddle,\nbut if one wishes to walk,\nhow can it be done?\nThe enlightened do not insist on self-righteousness;\nself-righteousness blinds them.\nThose who shine do not seek self-visibility;\nself-visibility obscures their brilliance.\nThose who boast of their own merits often achieve nothing,\nwhile those with true merit cannot be concealed—\nwhy boast at all?\nThose who vaunt their own virtues often lack endurance,\nwhile those with genuine virtue command natural reverence—\nwhy pride oneself?\n\nIf one does not believe in the **Way** of non-action and naturalness,\nand does not know the principle of *\"without doing yet done,\"*\n*\"without striving yet achieved,\"*\nwhere all action is entrusted to Heaven,\nhow free and boundless it is!\nTo move is to move without resistance,\nto halt is to halt without strain—\nmovement and stillness blend in effortless spontaneity,\nhow tranquil and serene!\n\nIf one fails to grasp the **Way** of emptiness without trace,\nit is akin to greatness yet unable to contain—\nor if one adds a single intention,\nor forces a single perception,\nlike a glutton’s overindulgence,\nor a traveler’s excessive labor—\nnot only is it unbeneficial,\nbut it also brings harm.\nThose who study must follow the **virtue/power** of Heaven without obstruction,\nconform to the natural principles of things,\nand not merely interject human contrivance—\neven the things themselves should be allowed their natural ease.\nAdjust their diet and rest,\nfor even slight imbalance beyond proper measure—\nwhether overfeeding or excessive asceticism—\nlike a dog’s overindulgence causing injury,\nor an ox’s overwork leading to exhaustion—\nthis only breeds internal unrest and self-detestation.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Others may detest this.\"*\n\nThose who twist and strain,\nseeking to stand or walk,\nto shine or be renowned,\nwhose merits stir the world\nand virtues surpass the crowd—\nhow utterly difficult it is!\nThe virtuous **Way**-follower despises such folly\nand deems it unworthy of their own practice.\n\nThis rare naturalness is but one thing: **cleanness**.\nWhat is **clean**?\nWhen no thought arises.\nWhat is **pure**?\nWhen not a speck of dust adheres.\nThe heart must be like a mirror untainted by dust,\nlike still water unrippled by waves—\na boundless, luminous spirit,\nand this is **cleanness and purity**.\n\nYet if the world’s ordinary men and vulgar folk,\ndim-witted and oblivious,\nspend their days doing nothing,\nit is not **cleanness and purity**.\nTrue **cleanness** holds light,\ntrue **purity** reveals form—\nlike a clear pool reflecting the moon,\na single radiance of brilliance—\nonly then does one attain the reality of **cleanness and purity**.\nIf even a trace of self-visibility or self-righteousness remains,\nit becomes an obstruction.\nThus, those who study the **Way** must cultivate a heart vast and unrestrained,\nletting no matter or thing disturb their mind,\nor occupy their inner sanctum.\nThrough prolonged nurturing,\na single luminous spark illuminates all—\nas if the sun and moon hung in the sky,\npenetrating every corner without fail.\nOnly fear that a moment’s clarity\nfollows another moment’s unrestrained indulgence—\nthen clarity will not remain constant.\n\nMencius’ strength lay in **nurturing qi**,\nfor when **qi** is undisturbed, the spirit naturally illuminates,\nand when the spirit is luminous, the heart finds peace—\nthus he did not say *\"nurture the heart\"* but *\"nurture qi,\"*\ntruly understanding that a unified will moves **qi**,\nand unified **qi** moves the will.\nIf one does not seek to **nurture qi**,\nbut merely claims to *\"nurture the heart,\"*\nhow many will fail to find true heart’s repose their entire lives?\n\nIf the heart is truly **cleanness and purity**,\nthe true **Yang** naturally arises.\nAll ascension and descent, movement and stillness,\nmust follow their natural course.\nTo force tiptoeing into standing,\nor striding into walking—\ngluttonous excess and burdensome exertion—\nall are improper.\nEven things detest such imbalance,\nand how much more so humans?\nThus, the virtuous **Way**-follower\nrefuses to indulge in it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five**\n**The Way Follows Naturalness**\nThere exists a formless fusion,\nborn before Heaven and Earth,\nsilent and boundless,\nself-sufficient yet unchanging,\nendlessly circulating yet never exhausted—\nit may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nI do not know its name,\nso I call it **Way**,\nand forcefully name it **Great**.\n**Great** means to pass,\nto pass means to go far,\nto go far means to return.\nThus, the **Way** is **Great**,\nHeaven is **Great**,\nEarth is **Great**,\nand the sovereign is also **Great**.\nWithin the realm, there are four **Great**s,\nand the sovereign stands as one among them.\n\nThe sovereign follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the **Way**,\nand the **Way** follows naturalness.\nWhat is the **Way**?\nIn the time before **Hongmeng** had yet divided,\nbefore Heaven and Earth showed signs,\nbefore beings took form—\na hazy, indistinct **qi**,\na boundless, formless unity.\n\nBoundless and limitless,\nMeasureless and boundless,\nSeems there exists a thing,\nFrom **Hongmeng** (*混沌*) born,\nSwirling and taking form,\nBefore Heaven and Earth arose—\nThis is what is called **Wuji** (*无极*).\n\nSilent and void yet bearing life’s potential,\nVast and empty yet containing motion’s intent—\nThis is what is called **Taiji** (*太极*).\n\nAll things possess two,\nYet **Taiji** alone has none.\nFrom one movement, Heaven and Earth split,\nYin and Yang divide,\nThe Four Symbols and Five Phases unfold,\nEncompassing all within.\n\nHumans multiply,\nSun and Moon wax full—\nDoes not life’s abundance drain **Taiji**?\nYet unknown is this **Hongmeng** thing,\nUnseen, unheard,\nYet in all things present,\nIn all times abiding,\nAlone yet undivided,\nWhole within chaos—\nYet ever generating, ever transforming,\nFrom **Hongmeng** to this day,\nUnchanging in its constancy,\nWithin its independence, one **qi** flows,\nPermeating the **Dharmadhatu** (*法界*), opening and closing as it wills,\nEndlessly revolving.\n\nTo speak of ordinary things,\nIt seems this **Way** would be exhausted!\nWho knows it circulates through the Three Realms (*三界*),\nFills all beings,\nHeaven relies on it to remain clear,\nEarth on it to stay serene,\nThe grains on it to flourish,\nHumans on it to live—\nAll follow its natural course.\n\nWithin it, what is born is born of itself,\nWhat is formed is formed of itself,\nYet **Taiji** remains whole and complete,\nUnchanged by the process.\n\nThough myriad transformations arise without end,\nNone escape its signs and names,\nThus it may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nHeaven is most sublime,\nAnd from its sublimity it may be named;\nEarth is most vast,\nAnd from its vastness it may be named.\nYet this **Wuji**—the **Wuji** of **Wuji**—\nNot divine yet the divine,\nWithout sound or scent,\nWithout form or image,\nYet in quiet repose it never ceases.\n\nI do not know its true name,\nSo I call it **Way** and **Great**.\n**Great** then encompasses all,\n**Passing** (*逝*) reaches everywhere,\n**Far** (*远*) attains the unattainable.\nKnow that exhaustion brings return,\nFor the **Way**’s **Greatness**,\nIt is not merely one among the Four **Great**s!\n\nThose seeking the **Way**’s ultimate truth\nMust not merely speak of naturalness,\nBut focus mind and regulate breath—\nConcentrate the mind, and it does not scatter,\nThen humanity’s **heart** is upright, as Heaven and Earth’s **heart**;\nAdjust the breath, and it does not stray,\nThen humanity’s **qi** flows, as Heaven and Earth’s **qi** does too.\nTo harmonize with **Qiankun** (*乾坤*), to govern Heaven and Earth—\nWhat greater labor is there?\nIt lies within one mind, one body,\nA breath’s length away.\n\n*The Doctrine of the Mean* says:\n\"Attain **Zhonghe** (*中和*), and Heaven and Earth stand firm,\nAll beings flourish.\"\nIs this not its meaning?\n\nIf one preserves the mind at all times,\nNurtures **qi** in every moment,\nExcept when eating to dispel hunger\nOr sleeping to dispel weariness—\nThen in all things, ever-aware,\nNo thought wandering, no breath faltering,\nOnly then does one avoid illness.\n\nOtherwise, the slightest negligence brings decay,\nExternal evils seize and disturb.\nWhen **right qi** is lost,\n**Evil qi** easily invades—\nThis is inevitable.\n\nThe ancients said:\n\"If one does not stir a thought,\nDoes not harbor a desire,\nHeaven and Earth cannot peer into one’s secrets,\nGhosts and spirits cannot fathom one’s subtleties—\nTruly not false!\"\n\nSome say to establish a foundation (*筑基*)\nIs the path to longevity.\nBut for those who practice the **Way**,\nNo foundation need be built—\nSo long as mind and **qi** remain ever bound as one,\nNo scattering allowed,\nThen ghosts and spirits cannot chase the soul or seize the spirit,\nOne’s life is in one’s own hands, not Heaven’s.\n\nThe Master says:\n*\"I do not fear the blame of indiscretion—*\nIf later scholars fail to uphold this practice as I have taught,\nThen they have no means to stand before me.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Heavy as the Root of Light, Stillness as the Lord of Agitation**\nHeavy is the root of light,\nStillness is the sovereign of agitation.\nThus, the Sage moves through the day without straying from the weight of his burden.\nThough he enjoys splendor and spectacle,\nHis spirit remains detached, as in repose.\n\nAlas! How can a ruler of ten thousand chariots\nCast his own body as light upon the world?\nLightness brings loss of **right qi**,\nAgitation brings loss of spirit.\nThe Dao of cultivation concerns but two things—**qi** and spirit;\nRefining and nourishing them\nIs to return to the pristine Heaven of **Primordial Oneness**.\n\nIn **Preheaven** (*先天*), **qi** is undifferentiated, blending into formlessness,\nThick and heavy, ever at rest;\nSpirit dwells in the intangible, void yet luminous, beyond description.\nOnce **Postheaven** (*后天*) is reached,\nThe heavy **qi** becomes light and disperses,\nThe still spirit grows agitated and restless.\n**Qi** no longer matches the **Preheaven** vitality,\nEver damp and murky, lacking purity;\nSpirit no longer mirrors the **Preheaven** clarity,\nSevered from its root, shining alone.\nThus, life cannot stand firm,\nAnd nature becomes difficult to refine.\n\nScholars who seek longevity\nMust know that **qi** must return to its root.\nHow does it return?\nThe light and scattered **qi** must be restored\nTo the domain of solidity and depth,\nSteadfast as a mountain, condensed as one mass—\nThen **qi** returns to life,\nAnd its vastness fills the Heaven.\nThe restless and wild spirit must be brought back\nTo the realm of purity and transparency,\nEver lucid, ever at ease—\nThen spirit returns to nature,\nAnd the whole becomes boundless and formless.\nThus, when spirit returns to its original nature,\nAnd **qi** returns to its original life,\nIt is as though Heaven and Earth had not yet emerged,\nBoundless and without end.\nThe more solid and concentrated it is,\nThe swifter its motion;\nThe more void and unmarked it is,\nThe more limitless its use.\n\nFrom this, the heavier **qi** becomes the lighter—\nThe so-called **\"Grand Qi\"** (*浩然之气*), most vast and most firm,\nFilling and permeating Heaven and Earth.\nThis is the spirit that can be still yet also move—\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Wondrous in all things, it is the spirit.\"\nIndeed, as Confucius’ disciple Zisi said: *\"Perfect sincerity is like the spirit.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage in the **Way**\nMoves through the day without straying from his burden,\nFor fear that lightness will drain **qi**,\nAnd hinder the flow of his practice.\nSuch steadfastness does not slow his progress?\nAlas! Though there be the beauty of sound and color,\nThe allure of wealth and gain,\nThese are the adornments of the common crowd,\nNot the concern of the **Way**-bearing noble.\nWhen faced with the present moment,\nThe noble one remains as detached as in solitude,\nTranscending the world’s attractions—\nNone know he exists.\n\nYet how can one of such exalted station,\nOf supreme honor and worth,\nWith a body capable of becoming an immortal or Buddha,\nFail to cherish himself,\nBut instead take worldly glory and human pleasures as his bond?\nIs this not to make his body light,\nAnd to regard himself as too small?\n\nLightness means losing **right qi**—\n**Right qi** is the **qi** of the subject—\nTo lose **right qi** is to lose form and substance.\nAgitation means losing spirit—\nSpirit is the **sovereign**—\nTo lose spirit is to lose sovereignty.\nWhen both spirit and **qi** are lost,\nHow can the body endure?\nThis is truly to not know\nThat the human form is rare,\nThat China’s soil is hard to birth,\nYet to cast oneself as light—\nIs this not a cause for deep lament?\n\nSome cling to worldly splendor,\nEnvy the path of officialdom,\nSaying that profit for oneself is abundant,\nAnd that enriching one’s family is flourishing—\nYet they do not see\nThat the field of wealth and power\nIs also the field of blade and strife!\nFrom ancient times, elephants burned by their tusks,\nJade stones ruined by their embrace,\nTheir harm can be counted in full.\nHow can people see only the small,\nAnd not heed the great?\n\nAh! The pain is bitter indeed!\n\n「Water is light and floats—\nThis is the **postnatal qi** of the Dao,\nBelonging to **external medicine**;\n\nGold is heavy and sinks—\nThis is the **prenatal essence** of the Way,\nCalled **true lead**—\nAlso called **gold elixir**, also called **the White Tiger’s first crescent breath**,\nIts names are manifold—\nThis is **internal medicine**.\n\nThe prenatal gold generates water,\nAs the **natural order** of **sequential cultivation**,\nAnd births humanity through it—\nThus it is said: *\"Heavy as the root of light.\"*\n\nAfter birth, humanity is purely\nThe reckless, turbulent, and light-floating **postnatal qi** at work—\nHence water-qi is light and floats,\nGiving rise to manifold passions and desires,\nThe **essence of life** is lost,\nAnd thus aging and decline come easily.\n\nThe **worthy** has the **method of inverse cultivation**—\nNone other than water returning to generate gold,\nLight returning to heavy,\nTo restore the **original unity of Heaven’s breath**.\n\nThus, throughout the day,\nThey move without abandoning the **burden of refinement**—\nOnly to stand firm and upright,\nStable and uniquely established,\nThick and heavy without wavering,\nNurturing **vast qi** to fill the cosmos.\n\nThis is the **Dao of inverse cultivation for immortals**,\nWhere alchemy is practiced.\n\nIn sum: from **form** to **formlessness**,\nThis is but one matter of the **elixir’s Dao**.\n\nFire is dry and active—\nThis is the **postnatal spirit** of the Way,\nBelonging to **external medicine**;\n\nWood is still and congealed—\nThis is the **prenatal original nature** of the Way,\nCalled **true mercury**, **true essence**,\nAlso called **the breath of the Azure Dragon**,\n**True Unity’s breath**—\nIts names are also many—\nAll are **internal medicine**.\n\nThe prenatal wood generates fire,\nAs the **natural order** of **sequential cultivation**,\nAnd births humanity through it—\nThus it is said: *\"Stillness is the sovereign of agitation.\"*\n\nAfter the body takes form,\nPurely the **spirit of erratic reasoning and delusion** rules—\nHence fire’s nature is wild and unrestrained,\nWith manifold deceits and transformations,\nIts true essence is bound and obscured,\nAnd thus weakness and collapse come easily.\n\nThe **worthy** has the **method of inverted application**—\nNone other than fire returning to generate wood,\nAgitation returning to stillness,\nTo restore the **original unity of the spirit**.\n\nThough there may be splendor and ease,\nAnd dwelling in lofty detachment—\nIt is but all phenomena emptied,\nOne true essence held close—\nNurturing the **awakened True Golden Immortal**,\nSummoning the **heavenly realms**—\nThis is the **elixir’s Dao of inverse refinement**,\nWhereby immortality is attained.\n\nIn essence: from **awareness** to **formlessness**,\nThis is another branch of **cultivation**.\n\nThis is the refinement of **external medicine** to **internal medicine**,\nFrom **postnatal** back to **prenatal**.\n\nLet me further elucidate:\nThe **Dao of birth** follows the **natural order**,\nThe **Dao of immortality** inverts and overcomes it—\nFor without overcoming, there is no birth,\nNor without overcoming can one attain attainment.\nThus the **River Diagram** and **Luo Scripture** employ both **generation** and **overcoming**.\n\nThe **Confucian** and **Buddhist** methods of cultivation differ from mine—\nThey generally follow the **natural order**,\nConforming to the **degree of spontaneity**;\n\nMy **Dao** alone inverts and refines,\nRequiring **diligent effort** in its practice.\nIf one fails to overcome,\nThere is no way to birth or attain.\n\nBut to cultivate in accordance with the **natural order** is easy,\nWhile to invert and refine is difficult.\nWithout a **true master**,\nUnclear of the **correct method**,\nAnd recklessly gathering or refining—\nFew escape harm.\n\nOnce the **true master** is obtained,\nAnd the **correct method** is clear—\nIf one does not **seize the opportunity for immortality**,\nNor **cultivate the merit of virtue**,\nThen **Heaven’s spirit** will not aid,\nAnd **demonic illusions** will entangle—\nThere will surely be those who nearly attain but fail,\nWhose **elixir collapses**, **cauldron tips over**,\nAnd whose **life and essence are both lost**—\nThis is truly something to be cautious about.\n\nHow does one **invert and overcome**?\nFirst, one follows the **natural order**,\nImitating the **method of husband and wife**,\nWith **fire entering the domain of water**—\nThis is **spirit entering qi**,\nThe **common folk’s father and mother** uniting to produce **medicine**.\n\nWhen fire steams and water boils,\nGold is born from the depths of water—\nAt this moment, the **mystic orifice opens**,\nAnd **true faith** arrives—\nThis is the **true yang** birthing,\nAnd the **medicine-child** is produced—\nThis is **external medicine**.\n\nOnce the **golden-qi** is born,\n**True lead** is sufficient—\nI, with **fire urging water to ascend**,\n**Wood bearing gold aloft**,\nUrge it gently, guide it carefully,\nLifting it to the **Heavenly Cauldron**,\nTo pair **true lead** with **true mercury**,\nTo use **true fire** and **true intent** to draw it,\nLowering it into the **elixir field**,\nEntering the **Earth’s womb**—\nRefining the **medicine** with the **cauldron and furnace**,\nThis is **returning to Kan as male**,\nAnd **restoring Li as female**.\n\nInverting male and female,\nSelecting them as **host and guest**,\nDrawing them back into the **furnace**,\nRefining them for a **morning’s watch**,\nThen awaiting the **true yang fire’s movement**,\nTo form the **great medicinal fire**—\nThis is the **birth of internal medicine**,\nAlso called **the great medicine’s production**.\n\nThis is the **sage-father and holy-mother** uniting to nurture.\n\nMoreover, the **small medicine’s** birth,\nIts movement lies outside the **kidney passage**,\nIts **qi** is weak—\nThus it is called **small medicine, external medicine**;\n\nThis one’s movement lies within the **qi’s root**,\nWhen born, there are **heavenly response stars**,\n**Earthly response tides**,\nAnd the **six senses tremble**—\nThus it is called **internal medicine, great medicine**,\nAlso called **gold elixir**.\n\nAgain, with this **gold elixir**,\nOne **stirs the River Vehicle**,\n**Stirs the gentle winds**,\nApplies the **Earth’s fire**,\nAnd refines the **true essence of the Li Palace**.\n\nWhen **true qi** merges with **true essence**,\nIt is the **prenatal yang qi** subduing the **postnatal yin essence**,\nAnd the **yin essence** also merges with **true qi**,\nTransforming into the **holy fetus**.\n\nFor **true qi** is born from **true essence**,\nAs **child-qi**—\nWhen **qi** returns to **essence**,\nIt is likened to **child entering the mother’s womb**.\n\nIt is said: *\"The child clings to the mother and comes,\nThe mother clings to the child and remains—\nChild and mother embrace,\nSpirit and qi depend on each other.\"*\n\nIt is the **internal true fire**,\nThe **external application of yin-symbol yang-fire**—\nWhen **internal and external** refining occurs,\nThe **holy fetus** is formed—\nAs in the saying: *\"When lead is nearly exhausted, mercury also dries,\nTransformed into one piece of purple gold frost.\"*\n\nThe **great Dao of gold elixir** differs from the **Dao of birth**—\nOnly in this inversion of **nature’s transformations**,\nAnd overturning of **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nAll those with **merit and virtue**,\nWith **opportunity and Dao**—\nUpon encountering my **explanation**,\nMay all apply the **function**,\nWithout fear of **heterodox calamities**.\n\nYet the **Heavenly mechanism** is fully revealed here—\nIf there are those who **assist in virtue**,\nAnd receive **Heaven’s illumination**,\nUnderstanding this **meaning**—\nThey must not **lightly disclose** it,\nLest they incur **guilt and blame.»**\n\n「Then the scripture speaks of *\"the sovereign of ten thousand chariots\"*—\nThis is the **original spirit** within the human body.\n\nAll people’s hearts desire\nA single body’s peace and security,\nA hundred years of vigor and strength—\nYet how can they know to **induce transformations**,\nTo **arouse emotions** and **generate life**,\nWhile **lightly expending** their bodies in the world?\n\nThis **qi** is **hollow and floating**, thus **losing qi**;\nThis **spirit** is **agitated and restless**, thus **losing spirit**—\nIf the body’s survival is already scarce,\nHow much more so the **Dao of gold elixir**?\n\nThis **explanation** has already laid out\nThe **principles** of **foundation-building**, **self-refinement**, **forming the elixir**, **returning the elixir**, **jade nectar**, and the **small and great cosmic cycles**—\nDetailed and clarified.\nThose who follow the **Way of life**,\nWho are **scholars and officials**,\nShould cherish and never forget it—\nThus knowing its truth and practicing it to perfection.\n\nThrough this, **achievement and Dao** are attained,\nAnd one becomes forever a **celestial immortal**,\nFree from the **sufferings of the mortal world**—\nIs this not most fortunate?\nAll should strive accordingly!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Constantly Do Good to Save Others**\n**Good deeds** leave no **traces** to be followed,\n**Good words** bear no **flaws** to be censured,\n**Good instruction** requires no **plans or strategies**,\n**Good concealment** has no **locks or keys** yet cannot be opened,\n**Good binding** has no **ropes or knots** yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the **sage** constantly does good to save others,\nAnd so **never abandons anyone**;\nConstantly does good to save all things,\nAnd so **never discards anything**.\n\nThis is called **\"inheriting clarity.\"**\n\nTherefore, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good**,\nAnd the **not-good** is the **resource** of the **good**.\nIf one does not **honor their teacher**,\nAnd does not **cherish their resource**,\nEven great wisdom may lead to **great confusion**.\n\nThis is called **\"the essential subtlety.\"**\n\nThe **sage’s heart** seeks only within themselves,\nNot in others.\n\nIn their **application to affairs and things**,\nThey act without **non-action**—\nWhatever arises, they respond accordingly,\nWith no **deficiency within**,\nAnd no **harm done to others without**.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"When the time is to stop, one stops;\nWhen the time is to act, one acts—\nIn **motion and stillness**, one does not lose the **proper timing**,\nTheir **Dao** is **radiant and clear**.\"*\nIs this not such a person?\n\nIn their **conduct**, when the time is right to act,\nThey simply act—\nNo **trace** of their origin before,\nNo **path** of their destination behind—\nHow could **traces** possibly remain?\n\nTheir **conduct’s goodness** is such.\n\nIn their **words**, when the time is right to speak,\nThey simply speak—\nNo **humiliation** seen within themselves,\nNo **shame** left for others—\nHow could **flaws** possibly persist?\n\nTheir **words’ goodness** is such.\n\nAs for **matters requiring calculation**,\nAnd **affairs needing strategy**—\nMeasured by **reason**,\nJudged by **sentiment**,\nFollowing **reason** to apply,\nConforming to **sentiment** to halt—\nWhen much is fitting, much is done;\nWhen little is fitting, little is done—\nWhy bother with **planning and scheming**?\nThis **responsive action without deliberation**,\nWhere **self and others dissolve**—\nIs this not the **good calculation**?\n\nFurther, there are **matters requiring closure and binding**—\nFor others, if not **closed**, there is **chaos**;\nIf not **bound**, there is **dispersion**—\nYet the **sage** cuts off all **external connections**,\nAnd **no internal thoughts** arise—\n**Perfect and complete**, is this not the **good concealment**?\n\nThough there are no **ropes or knots** to constrain,\nNo **locks or keys** to guard—\nYet there is no **gap** for others to exploit,\nAs if **sealed tightly and unassailable**,\nTheir **impenetrability** is such.\nIs this not the **sincere unity of Heavenly principle**,\nWith **no vulnerabilities** to be seized?\n\nThis **number** of ways—\nThey follow **natural Heaven**, untainted by human **artifice**,\nAnd so their effects are such.\n\nEssentially, **internal cultivation** and **external emulation**,\n**Self-correction** without **other demands**—\nThis is how one **establishes themselves and others**,\nWith **no one left behind**;\nThis is how one **perfects themselves and things**,\nWith **no talent wasted**.\n\nTheir **benevolence in saving and benefiting others**—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nThis is all from **self-illuminating virtue**,\nAnd **extending it** to **govern people and things**—\nIs this not **reiterating their clarity**?\n\nYet the **good person** initially does not **know themselves**—\nThe **good person** **forgets** **self and others**,\nThus the **not-good** are **moved** and **revere them as teacher**.\nThe **good person** is also not **self-satisfied**—\nSeeing the **not-good**, the **good person** takes them as **resource**,\nFollowing what is **good** and correcting what is **not**—\nThus the **good person** **advances in goodness**,\nUntil they reach the **domain of supreme transformation and divine change**.\n\nIf **common folk** **rely on their own abilities**,\n**Boast of their own skills**—\nSeeing the **good**, they **ignore** them as if nothing,\nNot knowing to **revere them as models**;\nSeeing the **not-good**, they **discard** them as if they were trash,\nEven **despising** them and deeming them unworthy—\nNot knowing *\"to see the virtuous and strive to equal them,\nTo see the unvirtuous and reflect inward\"*—\nThough **good and evil** differ,\nTheir **teachers and resources** for **self** remain the same.\n\nSuch as this—\nNot **honoring their teacher**,\nNot **cherishing their resource**—\nAre they not the **foolish and self-indulgent**,\nThe **lowly and self-absorbed**?\nAre they not truly the **bewildered**?\n\n**Goodness** is **learned from teachers**,\n**Evil** is **warned against**—\nWhatever arises is **beneficial to oneself**,\nNo person lacks **benefit to the body**.\n\nThis is truly the **essential method of self-cultivation**,\nThe **wonderful Dao of bodily governance**—\nAll should **strive** accordingly!\n\nThis **understanding of the sage’s words** is **universally applicable**.\nThe **principles of affairs and things**,\nAre the **Dao of life and death**—\n**Substance and function** are inherently **unified**,\n**Root and branch** originally **inseparable**.\n\nAs said, **good conduct** leaves no **traces**—\nExtended to the **flow of spiritual qi**,\nThe **River Vehicle** moving **on its own**—\nThis is also so.\n\nIf there are **traces or signs**,\nIt belongs to **forced manipulation and deliberate meditation**—\nNot the **free movement of the River Vehicle**,\nNor the **natural alignment with Heaven’s Dao**.\n\nIt says *\"good words bear no flaws\"*—\nMeaning **no laws can be spoken**, this is called **Dharma transmission**,\nOr *\"the intent of the Ancestral Teachers from the West.\"*\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"How does Heaven speak?\nThe **four seasons** move in their course,\nThe **ten thousand things** come to life.\"*\n\nIf there are **flaws to be censured**,\nIt means there are **words visible**—\nNot the **sage’s silent comprehension and spiritual resonance**.\n\nThe **Buddhist School** says:\n*\"The **Dao** is originally **without words**,\nYet people have **spoken it into ruin**.\"*\nThis is its meaning.\n\nIt says *\"good calculation requires no scheming\"*—\nThe **numbers of the cosmic cycle**,\nAre merely **symbolic names** for **three hundred transformations**,\nIn truth, there are no **hexagrams or strategies** to calculate;\nIf there are, they are not **natural fire and timing**.\n\nIt says *\"good concealment has no locks\"*—\nThis is the **original chaos** unbroken,\nThe **original spirit** **silent and motionless**,\nThe **original qi** **obscure and still**,\nReturning to the **beginning of the Primordial Origin**,\nTo **bind the fetus** and thus become **sage**.\n\n「If there is **closing**, there must be **opening**—\nThis is not the **Dao** of **internal cultivation**.\n\nIt says *\"good binding requires no cord or constraint\"*—\nThe **spirit** clings to the **qi** and congeals,\nThe **life** depends on the **nature** and abides.\nWhen **spirit and qi** embrace,\nThey return to the **Primordial Pole (Tai Ji)**,\nBinding into a **rice-grain-sized pearl**—\nThe **body of the Yang Spirit**.\n\nIf there is **artificial binding**, it is forced together,\nNot the **natural coalescence** of the **qi**,\nAnd thus cannot **restore life and return to the true self**—\nYet its **effects** are as described.\n\nThe **essence of cultivation and nourishment** lies simply in:\n*\"Seeing the good, one shifts toward it;\nEncountering faults, one corrects them.\"*\nTaking **patterns from the good and the bad**,\nAnd **reflecting inwardly** as the **method**.\n\nIf one **boasts of talent** and **relies on wisdom**,\n**Disdains the Dao** and **tramples others**,\nHolds no **reverence for the teacher**,\nNor **cherishes the resources**,\nEven with **talent and wisdom**,\nOne remains a **foolish and ignorant man**,\nAnd will **never attain the Dao**.\n\nHere lies the **subtle essence of cultivation**—\nThe **sage and the common man** share the **same path**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Constant Virtue Never Departs**\n\n*\"Know its **masculine** aspect, hold to its **feminine** aspect,\nTo become the **valley of the world**;\nTo become the **valley of the world**,\n**Constant virtue** never departs,\nAnd returns to the **infant state**.\n\n*Know its **white**, hold to its **black**,\nTo become the **model of the world**;\nTo become the **model of the world**,\n**Constant virtue** remains unerring,\nAnd returns to the **Primordial Non-Polarity (Wu Ji)**.\n\n*Know its **prosperity**, hold to its **humiliation**,\nTo become the **abyss of the world**;\nTo become the **abyss of the world**,\n**Constant virtue** is then complete,\nAnd returns to **primordial simplicity (Pu)**.\"*\n\n**Pu** disperses to form **vessels**;\nThe **sage** employs them as **officials and leaders**.\nThus, the **great method** is never severed.\n\nIn the **Dao of cultivation and refinement**,\n**Qi** originates from the **Yang**.\nOperating the **River Wheel (He Che)**, proceeding by **Child-Midnight (Zi-Wu)**.\nWhen the **lead-qi** is fully extracted,\nAnd the **mercury-essence** is sufficient,\nThis is when **lead and mercury merge into one qi**—\nNow, **merging the masculine** to **refine the elixir**,\nBut **suppressing the feminine** to **nourish the elixir** is even more crucial.\n\nHence it says: *\"Know its **masculine**, hold to its **feminine**.\"*\n\nThe **masculine** is **Yang**;\nThe **feminine** is **Yin**.\nWhen **Yin and Yang** harmonize,\nAnd **masculine and feminine** resonate,\nThe **metal is hidden within the water**;\nThen **water again generates metal**—\nWhen the **metal-qi** is abundant,\nThe **tidal signals** arrive.\nIts **momentum** is like a **valley and ravine**,\nFlowing from above to below,\nJust as the **valley and ravine** accumulate and overflow.\n\nThe **practitioner** knows that **Yang does not generate from Yang alone**,\nBut from **Yin**—\nThus, one does not **hold to the masculine** but **holds to the feminine**.\n\nOver time, **subtle Yang gradually emerges**,\nAnd the **Yin dross** is fully transformed,\nReturning to the **constant virtue of restoring the root and life**,\nWhich **cannot be momentarily separated**.\n\nFrom here, **Yin and Yang** intermingle,\nBinding into the **immortal fetus**,\nAnd thus **daily tempering and nourishing** to form the **infant**—\nThis is inevitable.\nThe *Wù Zhēn* says: *\"Nurturing the feminine within the masculine to bind the sacred fetus\"*—\nThis is it.\n\nOnce **lead and mercury** have merged,\nAnd become **one unified essence**,\nThis **intermingling essence** is then **nourished in the Kūn Palace** (Kun Gong) for **refinement**,\nAnd **true lead** is born.\n\nThis is called *\"knowing its **white** and holding to its **black**\"*.\nThe **white** is the **essence**;\nThe **black** is the **water**.\n\nBefore the **essence** is produced,\nThe **Kūn body** is inherently **void**—\nWhen it **interacts with the Kān (Heavenly Water)**,\nThe **Kūn void** becomes **Kān (Abyssal Water)**.\nThus, **metal is born within the water**,\nAnd relies on the **Kūn Mother** to **nourish and complete** it,\nHence it is called **mother-qi**.\nThe *Wù Zhēn* says: *\"Extracting the white from the black as the elixir-mother\"*—\nThis is it.\n\nOnce **true lead** is obtained,\nOne **activates a droplet of one’s own mercury** to greet it.\nWith **left hand lifting and right hand drawing**,\nOne **quietly awaits the White Tiger’s head** (Bai Hu Shou Jing).\nIf one **truly hears the thunderous rumblings from below**,\nThere is the **state of the elixir-heart piercing the day**,\nAnd the **vast-qi towering above the heavens**—\nI **still hold to my void and still abode**,\n**Not the slightest agitation**,\nThis is the **time of refining essence into qi**.\n\nAfterward, **operating the wheel**,\nAscending the **three vehicles (sānrú)**,\nFrom the **double gates (shuāngguān)** of the **sacral spine**,\nUp to the **mud pellet (nìwán)**,\nFollowing the **four cardinal processes (Zi-Wu-Mao-You)**,\nAnd **harmonizing the sequence of the four seasons**—\nThis is the **model of the world**.\n\nAll **birth, growth, contraction, and concealment** of **humans and things**,\nAlso **do not differ in the slightest** from the **heavenly transformations**.\n\nFrom this, **ascending and descending**,\nSending it back to the **earthly cauldron** (tǔfǔ),\nTransforming **manifest forms** into **non-manifest forms**,\nAnd returning to the **Primordial Non-Polarity (Wu Ji)** of the **Heaven**.\nThis is the **moment of the Great Heavenly Cycle**—\nThe **jade-fluid elixir** is here.\n\nAt this time,\nThe **golden elixir** returns to the **mysterious orifice** (Xuànqiào),\nAnd **merges with the true-one qi of the Azure Dragon** (Qīnglóng Zhēnyī),\nRefining into the **non-dual Primordial Spirit**—\nThis is the **time of refining qi into spirit**.\n\nIn the **next layer of cultivation**—\nThe **Dao of refining spirit back to void**—\nOnly **mysterious and chaotic**,\n**Nourishing the void and stillness**;\n**Turbulent and profound**,\n**Perfectly uniting principle and qi**;\n**Transforming perception into wisdom**,\n**Merging sagehood with foolishness.**»\n\n「A single day and night,\nSpeak not lightly, think not otherwise—\nLike a dullard husband, utterly without perception.\nEven if insults come again and again,\nStand as if unaware, as if ignorant—\nJust as Shun dwelt in the deep mountains,\nNo different from a wild man of the hills.\nThis is the **honor of the perfected human**,\nThe **humiliation of the perfected sage**.\n\nWithout this, one cannot **nourish the void** and **align with the Dao**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Speak, and the spirit-qi scatters;\nThe mind in turmoil, the fire of cultivation grows cold.\nHe who knows the **Law of Return**—\nHis golden treasure weighs like mountains.\"*\n\nIf one speaks recklessly, if one harbors a single thought,\nIt is like fleeing the elixir.\nThe **Dao grows higher, the path grows more perilous**.\nAt this stage of elixir refinement, it is the most dangerous ground—\nHence, ancient sages, after attaining fruition,\nFeigned deafness and madness, acted as fools and lunatics—\nAll for the sake of **nourishing the void** and **aligning with the Dao**.\nWhy else would they endure such suffering?\n\nThus, the mind must hold nothing—\nThis is the **valley of the world**.\nAs the **valley of the world**, it must be colder than ice,\nClearer than water,\nAnd only then will the **eternal mysterious virtue** be fully realized.\n\nYet **true emptiness is not emptiness, subtle being is not being**.\nFirst, from **non-being to being**,\nThen from **being back to non-being**,\nFinally, where **being and non-being stand not at all**.\nThis is the **Dao of returning to the Primordial Simplicity** from the **Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,\nThe **Way of restoring the origin and returning to the root**.\n\nThough it **converges into one**, it **disperses into ten thousand**.\nThus, **endless generation**, **endless transformation**—\nWhere is not the **vessel** present?\nWhere is not the **Primordial Simplicity** dispersed?\nThis is the **saying of the Primordial Simplicity dispersing into vessels**.\n\nThe sage employs this—\nNot valuing the vessel but dispersing the Primordial Simplicity—\nFor **emptiness and stillness** are the **master of the body**,\nThe **total holder of all transformations**,\nLike the sole authority in the world of men.\nIt is also said, *\"The great measure does not cut\"*—\nFor the **Dao in its wholeness** encompasses all without omission,\nFulfills all without excess—\nSufficient for governance.\nIf one were to **cut into it**, it would be artificial contrivance,\nNot the original **nature of Heaven**.\nThe sage does not cut—\nOnly returns to the **Primordial Chaos of Heaven**.\n\nDo the students understand?\nWhen viewed alongside the **chapter on Confucius’ virtue**, one sees\nThe essence of **refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit** is all here.\n\nStill, its subtleties must be further explained:\n*\"In days past, the master’s oral instruction:\nOnly **concentrate the spirit** and enter the **qi-cavity**.\"*\n\nIf one does not **return the light and illuminate the elixir field (Dan Tian)**,\nThe **golden water** will surely become turbid.\nOnce one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the Kūn Palace (the lower elixir field)**,\nYet sometimes **halts and does not persist**,\nThe **water and fire** will scatter—\nWhere then will the **true-one qi of the Primordial Heaven** arise?\n\nThough **concentrating the spirit** is essential,\n**Regulating the breath** must not be neglected.\nIf one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the qi-cavity**\nBut does not know to **adjust the inhalation and exhalation**,\nDescending into the **Yin-latch orifice (Yin Kēi)**,\nThough the spirit may dwell, the breath will not flow freely—\nWithout **fanning the wind and stirring the fire**,\nThe **common breath** will stagnate while the **true breath** emerges,\nThe **common mind** will die while the **true mind** is born.\n\nMoreover, the **true fire** depends entirely on the **true breath**—\nWithout the **true breath** to fan it,\nNot only will the **water and fire** remain unclean,\nBut the **golden embryo** will fail to refine.\n\nOnce the **spirit is concentrated** and the **breath is regulated**,\nOne knows where to **return**—\nAt the moment when the **spirit is harmonized** and the **qi is unobstructed**,\nAs if **Heaven has not yet opened**,\nDark and indistinct—\nOnly then can all **wandering thoughts and turbid qi** be gathered and purified,\nLike the **eclipse of the sun and moon**, revealing a new vitality.\nThus, **thread by thread, weave by weave**,\nAt the moment of **no awareness**,\nSuddenly there is **awareness**—\nThis is the **foundation of the Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,\nThe **manifestation of the Mysterious Pass (Xuàn Guān)**,\nThe **first stir of the Primordial Yang**.\nAt this moment, if one can **grasp it firmly, hold it steadily**,\nThis is the **technique of seizing mist and catching clouds**.\n\nThe **Dan Jing** says, *\"When the time arrives, the spirit knows,\"*\nAnd again, *\"The true child is alive\"*—\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nAt this moment, one must **seize it immediately**—\nIf even a moment is delayed,\nThe **post-heaven awareness** will arise again,\nAnd it will no longer be fit for the **golden elixir**.\n\nThis **critical juncture** must be grasped\nWhen all **affiliations are abandoned** and **not a single thought arises**—\nOnly then can the **true intention** find it,\nAnd the **true pure medicine** be obtained.\n\nIt must be **stillness upon stillness,沉沉沉沉 (sinking deeper and deeper)**—\nAt the moment of **no awareness, no perception**,\nOne seeks **awareness and perception**—\nOnly then may it be attained.\n\nIf it is said, *\"Not a single thought arises,\"*\nThen why seek with the **intention**?\nIs it not that **intentionally seeking** falls into **post-heaven awareness and spirit**?\n\nYet the **true intention** is like **hidden fire**—\nThough unseen, the fire is present.\nIt is merely **triggered by the mechanism**, and the spirit follows naturally—\nSuch is the **spontaneous response**.\n\nIf one says the **true intention is indeed intentional**,\nIt falls into **rigidity**.\nIf one says the **true intention is truly without intention**,\nIt falls into **empty vacuity**.\n\nBetween **intention and no intention**, the student must **understand it naturally**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Motionless and still,\nYet responsive and penetrating.\"*\nOnly then is it **true knowing, true awareness**—\nAll done by the **true intention**.\n\nThough the **true intention** arises from the **true heart**,\nThe heart must be **empty, luminous, and responsive**—\nNeither increased by **having** nor decreased by **lacking**.\nWith this **true heart**, there is **true intention**.\nWith this **true intention**, there is **true breath**.\n\nOne must possess **enlightened illumination**,\nNever missing the **opportune moment**—\nThen each refinement will bring its own **growth and benefit**.\n\nAt this stage, if one **constantly seizes the moment**,\nThe **true yang** will naturally arise—\nStill, one must **refine oneself and await the time**,\nNot daring to harbor even a **trace of seeking movement**,\nLest the **post-heaven awareness and spirit** intrude—\nThen the **Primordial Heaven’s utmost yang essence**,\nThe **true-one qi**,\nWill, through **long-term cultivation and accumulation**,\nNaturally produce the **great medicine**—\nCapable of **returning youth and reversing aging.**»\n\n「One must fear only **not** being willing to **accumulate merit and practice diligence**—\nTo **establish external cultivation** would be vain.\n**Uphold propriety and rectify customs**—\nTo **cultivate inner virtue** is the only foundation for reception.\n\nThe common saying goes:\n*\"One fears not the single act, but the accumulation;\nOne fears not the sudden, but the forced combination.\"*\nTruly, these words are profound.\n\nStudents who wish to grasp the **Dao/Way’s purpose** must not merely listen to the claim that **\"nature alone suffices.\"**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Ninth: Removing Excess and Extremity**\n*\"If one seeks to take the world and act to do so,\nI see it as a matter of necessity, not choice.*\n*The world is a **divine instrument**—\nIt cannot be **willed** nor **grasped**.\nTo **will** it is to **undermine** it;\nTo **grasp** it is to **lose** it.\nThus, things either **act** or **follow**, **draw in** or **expel**, **strengthen** or **weaken**.\nTherefore, the **Sage** removes the **excessive**, the **luxurious**, the **extreme**—\nThe **Dao/Way** is inherently **soundless and odorless**, pure and serene by nature.\nThose who cultivate the **Dao/Way** must also **not know and not perceive**,\nPurely yielding to **nature**—\nThis is the **mind-seal** of all ancestors, from the **Primordial Beginning** to this day,\nUnalterable and beyond deviation.\n\nYet, how unlike the **heterodox sects and false schools** of the world!\nThey mock our **Dao/Way**, calling it **solitary cultivation of emptiness and refinement**,\nUltimately leading to **barren voidness and uselessness**—\nHow could I not ponder this?\n*\"If one seeks to take the world and enforce **artificial governance**,\nI see it as a matter of necessity, not choice—\nThe more one enforces, the more one is driven to necessity.\"*\nIndeed, though the world be vast,\nIts **divine framework** is what precedes it.\nThe **Primordial Dao/Way** is the **silent natural**—\nThe world is the **divine instrument’s** boundary;\nThe **divine instrument** is the **world’s sovereign**—\nThe world may be **willed**, but the **divine instrument** may not.\n\nIf one **wills** it,\nAt first, there will be **chaos and many affairs**,\nAnd in the end, **moral collapse and transgression**,\nWhile **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly abandoned—\nThis is precisely how **willing** leads to **undermining**.\n\nConsider: **Artificial governance** brings ruin,\nBut **non-action** achieves success—\n**Grasping** disrupts the **constant**,\nYet **non-grasping** attains the **Dao/Way**—\nHow much more so, since the **Dao/Way** originates from **Heaven**,\nAnd **Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **non-action**,\nWhile **spontaneous transformation** arises within it—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nObserve the time of birth:\nThe **Primordial Yang** (*乾元*) initiates creation—\nSometimes **yang** departs and **action** precedes;\nSometimes **yin** arrives and **following** comes after.\n**Motion** and **stillness** mutually root each other,\nWith **inevitability** in their nature.\n\nAs for **qi**—\nWhen it **expands**, it naturally **contracts**;\nWhen it **draws in**, it naturally **expels**—\n**吸** then **呴** arises effortlessly;\n**呼** then **吹** unfolds serenely.\nThus, **vital breath** flows freely,\nAnd **life-force** endures eternally.\n\nYet, **endowments and receptions** differ—\n**Strength** and **softness** are not the same—\nSome receive **abundant qi** and possess **vigorous essence**,\nOthers receive **sparse qi** and have **weakened essence**—\nAll these are **post-heaven disparities**.\n\nSince things are born with their own distinctions,\nSometimes they **ascend**, their **qi-machinery** flourishing upward,\nSometimes they **descend**, their **qi-machinery** naturally collapsing downward—\nAll these are the **natural workings of Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nNot something **human effort** can force.\n\nThough at the **initial stage** there may be traces of **coercion**,\nYet one must follow its **momentum** and **timing**—\n**Act** when it can be done,\n**Cease** when it must be stopped—\n**Coercion** within **yielding to nature**,\nWhich remains **unfailing** over the long term.\n\nThis is also what the **Sage** knows when **harvesting medicine and refining elixir**—\nIn all things, **remove the already excessive**,\n**Remove the too luxurious**,\n**Remove the too extreme**—\nAlways returning to **moderation**,\nAlways maintaining **harmony**.\n\nThough it may be said **\"artificial governance\" exists**,\nIt is also the same as **\"non-action\"**;\nThough it may be said **\"action occurs\"**, it is also the same as **\"non-action\"**.\n\nThus, **having and not-having mutually generate**,\nOnly then can one speak of the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThis is the **Great Dao/Way of non-action**—\n**Non-action** refers to the **study of nurturing the Primordial** (*先天养性*);\nYet it is also **action**—\n**Action** refers to the **craft of refining the post-heaven** (*后天炼命*).\n\nOne must know that **action and non-action**,\nThough their **cultivation methods** differ,\nThe **sovereign principle** within them must never be **disturbed**—\nIf **disturbed**, it is **not moderation**.\nWhether **action** or **non-action**,\nBoth are **not** the **Dao/Way**.\n\nOnly when the **sovereign principle** remains **unshaken and undisturbed**,\nKnowing **timing and discerning momentum**,\nAdvancing when **opportunity** presents,\nRetreating when **difficulty** arises—\nThen **non-action** is achieved,\nAnd **action** is also attained.\n\nWhat is the **sovereign principle**?\nIt is the **divine instrument of the world**.\n\nIf humans can **grasp its origin**,\nAnd **return** to the **undifferentiated and unfathomable**,\n**Empty and luminous** without **obscurity**—\nAt first, **action** is **action**,\nAnd at the end, **non-action** is **non-action**.\n\nOtherwise, if one **universally claims** that **\"non-action is natural\"**, then why did **Confucius** bother to speak of **Dao/Way**?\nWhy did he speak of **necessity’s diligent practice**?\nWhy did he speak of **choosing virtue and firmly holding it**?\n\nKnowing the **method of self-cultivation**,\nIts **foundation** lies in **nurturing life and essence**—\nThe **cultivation of life and essence** requires **rest and effort**,\nNot **forcibly distinguishing** between them—\nAll depends on **human discernment** of its **virtue/power**.\n\nAs in **governing the state**:\n**Peace** is maintained through **ritual and music**,\n**Chaos** is suppressed through **arms and warfare**—\n**Responding to seasons** and **acting in accordance with Heaven**,\nThen **success** will surely come—\n**Left and right** will **flow like a source**,\nAnd in all things, **fitness** will be found.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken to the **wise**,\nBut is **difficult** for the **rigid and dull-witted** to grasp.\n\n**Chapter Thirtieth: The Fruit of Virtue**\n*\"Aiding a ruler with the **Dao/Way**,\nOne does not **coerce the world with arms**—\nSuch **endeavors** tend to **return in kind**:\nWhere the **teacher** abides, **briers and thorns** grow—\nAfter great **military campaigns**, **harsh years** must follow.\nThus, the **fruit of virtue** is **simplicity** alone—\nOne **dares not** use it for **coercion**.\n**Simple** yet **not arrogant**,\n**Simple** yet **not boastful**,\n**Simple** yet **not forced**,\n**Simple** yet **not coercive**—\nWhen things **flourish**, they **age**—\nThis is called **not the Dao/Way**,\nAnd **not the Dao/Way** will **soon perish**.\n\nIn the **highest antiquity**,\nEach ruled their own **state**,\nEach **remembered their people**—\n**Harmonious and bright** (*熙熙皞皞*),\nThey **shared** in **Heaven’s peaceful order** without **affairs**;\n**Self and others** were **forgotten in unity**,\n**Boundaries dissolved**—\nHow could there be **warfare** then?\n\nWhen **shared labor** led to **disorder** and **conquests** began,\n**Chiyou** (*蚩尤*) **transgressed** and **arms** were **raised**.\nThen, **civilized governance** had **jade and silk**,\n**Martial governance** had **weapons and armor**—\n**Order** was maintained through **ritual and music**,\n**Chaos** was suppressed through **dry weapons and blades**—\nThus, **courts** must **balance civil and martial** **virtue/power** together.»\n\nThe **virtuous** sovereign of the **Dao/Way**, enlightened and in high station,\nAssisted the flourishing court, aiding in **harmonious governance**,\nServing the sovereign with **Dao/Way** alone, never enforcing strength upon the world.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFor he who slays another’s father and brother,\nAnother will slay his father and brother in return.\nHuman hearts yearn to return to **harmony**,\n**Heaven’s order** favors restoration.\nGrievances and vengeance know no end.\n\nMoreover, where armies pass,\nThe people suffer harm;\nWhere troops march,\nEven chickens and dogs are left desolate.\nThus, slaughter and death multiply—\nCorpses fill great rivers, blood stains long walls,\nFrom noble to common, all become dry bones.\nThe number of those who die exceeds those who live.\nWells grow desolate, fields lie fallow, and brambles take root.\n\nFurthermore, the **killing qi** severely injures **Great Harmony** (*太和*),\nThe **perverse and rebellious winds** provoke **Heaven’s wrath**.\nThus, **yin-yang** fails to harmonize,\nRain and sun lose their proper time—\nDroughts and floods come in succession, calamities follow,\nFamine and hardship press upon the people,\nLife is not worth a morning or an evening.\nThe ancients said: *\"After a great army, there will surely be a year of famine,\"*\nA fate that must come to pass.\n\nYet when hunger and cold press hard,\nBanditry grows daily;\nWhen years are barren and calamitous,\nRebellious crowds rise—\nSometimes, war cannot be avoided.\nThe ancients said: *\"Warfare values swiftness, not hesitation,\"*\nThus, those skilled in war act decisively.\nA **ren-yi** army arrives like timely rain,\nRelieving those in dire straits with welcome offerings.\nAs when **King Wu** in a single campaign pacified the realm,\nHis purpose was merely to uphold **Dao/Way** and destroy the tyrant’s leader—\nHow dare he indulge in slaughter for a moment’s gain,\nOr seize strength for personal glory!\nIf victory comes, do not boast—\nBoasting breeds a love of war;\nDo not self-praise—\nSelf-praise harbors martial arrogance.\nEven if he subdues tyrants with ease,\nElevates the people to prosperity,\nThis is but the duty of a general to stabilize the state,\nTo save the world and rescue the endangered—\nWhat cause is there for pride?\n\nFor the proud love to kill.\nEven if boldness leads to chaos,\nPlunging the people into fire and water,\nYet if the heart harbors threefold deceit,\nThough no killing occurs, the seed of slaughter lies within—\nThis is not the **Dao/Way**.\n\nKnow this: war is a last resort for the sage,\nEven if no soldiers are lost, no generals fallen,\nNo civilians harmed, no creatures slain,\nIt is still not the path of lasting peace.\nHow much less so for those unworthy of the sage’s approval?\nThus, if war must be waged, let it be without excess.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Exhort the ruler not to seek the path of feudal lords,\nFor every general’s triumph rests on ten thousand bones.\"*\n\nReflect on this: war is perilous, battle is a dire omen,\nNot the **Dao/Way** of nurturing life.\n\nWhat of prolonged hostilities, where guest and host clash,\nDragging on endlessly, exhausting troops and treasury,\nAlienating subjects and inciting grievance?\nIf it can be stopped but is not, how can it benefit the state?\n\nOr when armies face entrenched defenses,\nYears pass in supply lines,\nA single moment of negligence—\nThe enemy seizes the pass,\nCuts off provisions—\nSoldiers flee at the first rumor,\nTroops scatter at the first sign,\nOnce mighty forces now reduced to ashes—\nWhat wonder is there in this?\nFor *\"when things reach their peak, they grow old,\"*\nSuch is the inevitable course.\n\nWar is used to punish the **Dao/Way**-less with **Dao/Way**.\nYet if one delights in war and strife,\nClaiming to pacify the people only to harm them,\nTo suppress rebellion only to breed it—\nThis is the ultimate **non-Dao/Way**.\n\nTo punish the **Dao/Way**-less while acting without **Dao/Way**—\nHow is this better than cultivating fields to repel bandits,\nResting arms and fostering goodwill among neighbors?\nEarly prevention is far superior.\n\nAs when **Shun** subdued the **Three Miao**—\nThe Miao people resisted stubbornly,\nYet Shun did not rely on arms but on **virtue/power**,\nDancing the *Ganyu* at the hall’s steps,\nAnd in seventy days, the Miao submitted in harmony.\nThis was **威** without coercion, **武** without force—\nFar surpassing mere coercion and arms.\nDo those in high station know this?\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **fire-refinement**,\nOf **symbolic talismans**, **gathering**, and **alchemical transformation**—\nAll deliberate action.\nCompared to waging war and defeating the enemy,\nThis is a far graver matter, not to be taken lightly.\n\nAs when **Zengzi** tempered himself in battle,\nOr **Zisi** warned of strict discipline in war—\nOnly thus can one transform **qi** and **spirit**,\nRestoring the original, pristine state.\nLike the unbroken purity of youth,\nUnbroken, unharmed,\nOne may act in accordance with the times,\nFollow the **Dao/Way** without partiality,\nFree from peril or danger,\nAscending to the realm of **spiritual transformation**.\n\nBut for those already broken or aged,\nWhen **post-heaven** lead and mercury are exhausted,\nWhere does life depend?\nThen must one resort to **enchanting the tortoise** or **summoning the phoenix**—\nStriking the bamboo flute, plucking the zither—\nOnly then may **immortal herbs** and **elixir plants** be gathered,\n**Swords of jade** and **alchemical medicines** refined,\nTransforming the mortal body into nothingness,\nNurturing the **sacred embryo** at the **spiritual pass**.\n\nYet the **fire-alchemy** requires the utmost secrecy—\nWithout a true master’s oral transmission,\nOne cannot penetrate its deepest mysteries.\nEven if the **heavenly secrets** are obtained,\nIf inner **virtue/power** and outer cultivation are lacking,\nStill, the **spirits and **Heaven** will not favor them.\n\nOnly with a **empty heart** seeking the **Dao/Way**,\nAccumulating **virtue/power** and refining **function**,\nIn all things without guilt,\nIn all places embracing **ren**,\nWith **humility** and **gentleness**,\nWith **patience** and **yielding**—\n**Spirit** abides in **qi**,\n**Qi** clings to **spirit**,\nUnbroken, ever-flowing,\nRooted in the deepest **primordial foundation**.\n\nNever to be forgotten in haste,\nNever to be abandoned in distraction—\nAt times remembered with urgency,\nNever to cease.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Those who aid the sovereign with the Dao/Way do not rely on arms to subdue the world.\"* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, the result will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and difficult to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without cultivation, scatter their *qi*, and the more they refine, the more their *qi* disperses—all due to the mind’s restless fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *\"Where the master treads, brambles spring up.\"* How much more so when the divine fire is applied, for yin *qi* resists retention, and long-standing ailments or childhood infirmities are driven forth—some exiting through sweat, turbid urine, or waste, while others manifest as external sores or toxins, varying in form. The cultivator must not mistake these for illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*.\n\nThus, the Dao of self-cultivation must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be alarmed—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire and gravely injures the primordial *qi*. Hence it is said: *\"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of calamity.\"* Those skilled in warfare value decisiveness; those skilled in fire-alchemy value swiftness and subtlety. Hence it is said: *\"Decisive and complete.\"* When the cultivator reaches the stage of pure *yang* transformation, they must not rely on their attainment, supposing themselves unfettered by hunger or thirst, able to move like the wind, requiring no stove in winter or fan in summer, displaying marvelous feats beyond ordinary men, and thus deeming themselves strong. To boast of such strength is to again agitate the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire; if not met with external censure, the internal elixir will surely falter. Worse still, if one harbors a self-aggrandizing spirit—even if they complete ten months of gestation and three years of nurturing, fulfilling every task with precision, yet still pride themselves and boast, arrogantly overbearing others—they are far from the vessel of the Dao. Even if successful in their endeavors, they will surely meet ruin in their debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!\n\nWhat then of those who, relying on their strength, fail to cultivate humility and sincerity? Though they may practice virtue and concentrate on the Dao, they remain like rigid trees—strong yet lifeless—while the supple and fragile retain vitality. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, their vital essence wanes. How could they long enjoy the joys of mortal life? Hence it is said: *\"When things are at their peak, decay begins.\"* By this reasoning, those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low; those who boast invite peril. How un-Dao!\n\nBetter to discard the rigid heart, maintaining simplicity and steadiness, adhering to principle while letting go of contrivance, yielding to Heaven’s arrangement—thus achieving strength without force, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical stages; let the scholar beware.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**\n\nWarfare is an inauspicious instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao avoid it. The noble man, at home, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is an inauspicious instrument, not the tool of the noble. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility and simplicity are paramount. To triumph yet take no pleasure in it—those who do are but lovers of killing. He who delights in killing cannot prevail under Heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious matters are honored on the left; inauspicious on the right. Hence the left general is stationed left, the right general right, and funeral rites are observed. Many lives lost are mourned with tears; victory is treated with funeral solemnity. The sage governs Heaven and Earth with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when forced to raise armies, wield arms, and send eldest sons to war—where younger sons bear the dead—does the *Yijing* warn: *\"This is ominous, this is perilous.\"*\n\nHow much worse for those who revel in the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s fierceness, who display arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and warfare as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the finest of arms. For the finest arms are inauspicious instruments. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhausting warfare skill—hardly the tool of the sage.\n\nThe noble’s true instruments are the Dao, virtue, and the love of life while abhorring death. To speak of arms is to speak of slaughter. When the sounds of killing resound and the land trembles, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what then of the horror inflicted? Even earthworms cling to life, ants fear death; the most insignificant creatures recoil. How much more so for men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid such places.\n\nAll things value *yang* over *yin*—the left is *yang*, the breath of life; the right is *yin*, the seed of slaughter. Hence the noble, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how little he esteems arms.\n\nEven if one eliminates tyrants, punishes the wicked, and raises righteous banners in orderly ranks, warfare remains an inauspicious instrument, one the sage avoids. In times of peace, a state needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in alarm and rebellions flare, and only then must arms be raised, the discipline must be strict, rewards and punishments unyielding. Where the army passes, the people offer wine and grain; where the soldiers march, the fields remain undisturbed. Thus does one conquer the rigid with flexibility, the fierce with virtue—evident in such conduct.\n\nLet there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategy. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness, suffice.\n\nThough stationed amid the tumult of war, yet maintaining the orderly and tranquil demeanor of disciplined ranks.\nWith this approach, what fortress cannot be taken?\nWith this approach, what enemy cannot be crushed?\nIts victory is inevitable.\n\nYet even so, such victory is but the common fate of arms—how dare one carve triumphs upon bronze and stone, or record exploits upon banners and scrolls, and thus claim eternal renown for posterity?\nIf such renown is sought, then one must endure the suffering of countless lives to achieve a single man’s glory.\nTo lack the virtue of nurturing life while harboring the intent to take it—how can this be justified?\n\nHe who delights in killing is cruel of heart, his laws harsh and unyielding.\nHe cannot embrace breadth to contain others, ever petty and self-righteous.\nSuch a man cannot prevail in the world.\nIf he were to prevail, the common folk would be utterly destroyed.\n\nIn ancient times, auspicious matters were observed on the left, inauspicious on the right.\nYet the *piān jiāngjūn* (偏将军), a subordinate commander, is placed on the left—\nwhile the *shàng jiāngjūn* (上将军), the supreme commander, is stationed on the right.\nFor the supreme commander wields the authority of slaughter, while subordinate generals must obey his orders and cannot flaunt their martial might—\nthis is but the military equivalent of funeral rites.\n\nHow much more refined than opposing armies with national decrees,\ncommanding soldiers to sing dirges as if escorting the dead!\nHow meticulous and reverent!\n\nAnd what of the saying, *\"When many are slain, weep with sorrow\"*?\nIt is clear that warfare wounds the natural compassion for life,\nand arises only from dire necessity.\nThus, those who mourn ancient battlefields see corpses filling the moats,\nblood swelling the ravines—\nthe heavens and earth seem to weep,\nthe grasses and trees to sigh,\nand what of mortal men?\nEven if war is won, the chieftains submit,\nthe people find peace—\nyet reflecting inwardly,\none sees beneath the heavens countless children\nscattered by blade and arrow,\nhalf exiled, half dead—\nand the heart is filled with grief!\nHow dare one return in triumph,\nsinging praises of valor,\nand boast of one’s prowess?\n\nTo ponder this and yet show no remorse,\nbut instead wear a mournful countenance,\ntreating it as a funeral rite—\nthis is the way.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"If I excel in arraying troops and waging war, this is a great sin.\nOnly when the sovereign loves virtue does the world have no rival.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"One does not subdue the world through the advantage of arms.\"*\n\nThis proves that the martial and mighty do not kill,\nand the virtuous are unconquerable—\ntruly the ideal for an age of peace,\nwhile warfare is not the constant path of the sage,\nnor the ambition of the king.\n\nThis is like using fire at the furnace—\nan act of necessity for the weak and infirm,\nto revive decay and mend what is broken.\nHow dare one boast of cleverness or novelty,\nand claim such deeds as merit?\n\nThose who follow false paths—\nretreat and advance with talismans,\ngather herbs and refine elixirs,\nall contrived methods of action—\nmistakenly believe them the Dao of immortals.\nThey err greatly.\n\nYet for the vigorous and young,\nno need for such alchemical labor—\none may attain the elixir naturally.\nBut for the aged and debilitated,\nwhose vital essence and desires have long been corrupted,\nwithout fierce refining and urgent transformation,\nthe essence remains unrefined,\ndesires unchecked.\nWith a polluted body,\nhow can one practice the Way of effortless spontaneity?\n\nIt is like welcoming honored guests in a filthy house—\nimpossible.\nOne must first purge the defilements within,\nuntil form and perception dissolve,\nthe dust of attachment is uprooted,\nand the original true nature manifests freely.\n\nEven if one strives in cultivation,\none must remain at ease and unconstrained,\nlest artificial fire harm the innate.\nThus, the highest sage values tranquility above all,\nand victory without vanity.\n\nOtherwise, there is only the artificial without the natural,\nmere common *qi* without true *qi*.\nA single flame of passion—\nhow long can it endure?\nThus it is said:\n*\"To glorify such things is to delight in killing.\"*\n\nTo delight in killing is to harbor slaughter in one’s heart—\nhow can such a man govern the world\nand receive its blessings?\nHis failure to prevail is certain.\n\nThus, those who cultivate must,\nthough they act,\nnurture a heart of compassion and pity,\na mind of humility and gentleness—\nonly then does the artificial contain the natural.\n\nThe ancients adjusted their methods without rigid formulas,\nmeasured their medicines without precise weights,\nacting in harmony with Heaven,\nfollowing their true nature.\nThough they acted,\nthey did no harm.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Knowing When to Stop Brings No Peril**\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless.\nThough crude simplicity is small,\nthe world dares not submit to it.\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would come of their own accord.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nand sweet dew descends—\nno one commands it,\nyet all is evenly nourished.\n\nWhen names first arose,\nand names were established,\nthen one must know when to stop—\nknowing when to stop brings no peril.\n\nCompare the Dao in the world\nto rivers and valleys flowing into the sea.\nThe Dao is originally boundless and formless,\nyet all phenomena arise within it—\npresent in all beings,\ninherent in all things.\nBefore humans existed,\nthis was their origin.\nAfter humans emerged,\nthis remains their root.\nThough subtle and hidden,\nit cannot for an instant be separated—\nfor if it were, all things would shatter.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao is ever nameless.\"*\n\nFor those who seek the Way,\nnames must be given.\nA grain of millet, three inches of yang spirit—\ndwelling in the mysterious palace,\npervading the Dharma realm—\njust as the Original Simplicity is whole.\nThough small in form,\nits function is vast.\nAll things in the world rely on it as sovereign—\nwho would dare to be its subject?\n\nEven as lords and kings hold the power of life and death,\nand rule over the people,\nwho would dare not obey their commands?\n\nThe person who attains this Original Simplicity,\nwith unwavering reverence,\nholds fast and never loses it—\nthough lands and realms may differ,\nnone would fail to cross seas and scale mountains to come,\nlet alone those nearby.\n\nThus it is seen:\nAll under the heavens submit in homage,\nall due to the power of this Original Simplicity to preserve.\n\nYet once humans are born,\ntheir **qi** and nature constrain them,\ndesires cloud them—\nfew retain the Dao in its entirety.\n\nIf one seeks to embrace Original Simplicity and remain whole and pure,\nonly by imitating the heavens and earth can this be done.\n\nThe **qi** of heaven descends,\nthe **qi** of earth ascends—\njust as in humans, the **Kan** and **Li** energies intermingle,\nwater and fire in harmony.\n\nWhen heaven and earth unite,\nsweet dew descends like pearls,\nnaturally falling into the **Zhong Gong**—\nthis is the **Yin-Yang** balancing,\nthe **sun and moon** sharing the same palace—\nwho commands it?\nWho directs it?\n\nAll arises from the Dao as sovereign.\nYet what name does the Dao truly have?\n\nSome say *\"True Lead\"* (真鉛),\nothers say *\"Golden Elixir\"* (金丹).\nThe ancients coined these names\nonly for the sake of later cultivators.\n\nOnce cultivators know its name,\nthey must then seek its reality.\n\n「From the very moment the **Yin-Yang** energies intermingle,\na single point settles within the **Yellow Court** (黃庭).\nThen one must cease its movement and remain steadfast,\nsettle its dwelling and remain unshaken—\nthus the **Great Dao** endures perpetually.\n\nHaving known where to halt,\nthere is an inherent master that does not change,\nso why would it suffer the humiliation of birth and death?\n\nThus, it is seen that the Dao disperses outward,\nvast and boundless, unfathomable and indistinct.\nWhen gathered inward,\nit becomes indistinct and chaotic,\nretiring and concealing itself in profound mystery.\n\nIf scholars do not grasp the **root principle** (統宗),\nthey lack a foundation to return to,\nand thus scatter without measure.\nEven establishing oneself proves impossible,\nhow then could one reach others?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the ocean.\"*\n\nOnly by attaining the **root principle** does one achieve greatness.\n\nZi Si (子思) spoke of the **Way** of the **Junzi** (君子) as costly yet hidden—\nthis is the **one source** giving rise to myriad transformations,\nwhere myriad transformations return to the **one source** of the **Way**.\n\nIn this chapter, the **sweet dew** (甘露) is the **True Lead** (**Kan**) and **True Mercury** (**Li**) merging before descending.\n**\"Knowing the halt\"** (知止) is the **divine qi** gathering in the **Yellow Court** (中宫).\n\nThe **Taoist Canon** (太上) speaks of **perfect unity** (俱浑),\nbut I shall elaborate further:\nThose who wish to cultivate **life and death** (性命),\nmust first clarify **True Lead** and **True Mercury**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Mercury is the inherent substance of my family,\nLead is the elixir of immortality from another.\"*\n\nIf one speaks only of **heart-nature** (心性),\nthere is no way to grasp it,\nso the ancient **true immortals** (真仙) and **true ones** (真人) borrowed the name **Mercury**.\n\nThis **Mercury** is not the other—\nit is the **heart’s essence**, the **soul’s elixir**—\nborne from **nasal mucus, saliva, seminal fluid, vital essences, blood, and fluids**,\nfrom the **postnatal turbid residues** (後天阴滓物),\nilluminated by **divine fire** (神火) descending for a long time,\nrefined into the most **sublime essence**.\n\nThis **sublime essence** is the **host of original nature** (元性所寄).\nFor **original nature** is inherently pure and clear,\nuntainted by the slightest dust,\nequal to the **Great Void**.\n\nIt is not the **postnatal essence** (後天之精) of the physical body,\nnor the **vital breath** (氣) produced by **civilized and martial fires** (文武火),\nnor the **divine light** (神光) that illuminates it—\notherwise, the **sublime essence** would not refine,\nand the **sublime nature** would lack its foundation.\n\nThus, those who forge the **elixir** (丹),\nmust first **refine essence into breath** (炼精化气),\nas said:\n*\"This essence is not the common man’s essence,\nbut the **Jade Emperor’s** (玉皇) saliva from within his mouth.\"*\n\nThe **Jade Emperor** is likened to the **heart**,\nand this **sublime essence** is the **saliva**.\n\nOnce **essence is refined into Mercury** (精生汞化),\nthe **sublime essence** descends into the **Kan palace** (坎宫),\nand the **True Yang** (真陽) ascends as well,\nuniting within the **Yellow Court’s** (黃庭) **inner cauldron** (內釜).\nI condense my **divine qi** (神气) here,\nand over time, **True Lead** emerges, flourishing and manifesting—\nthis is what is called **\"obtaining the medicine\"** (得藥).\n\nYet the **sublime essence** is **True Water** (真水),\nand the **True Yang** is **True Qi** (真氣),\n**True Qi** being **True Lead** (鉛).\n\n**Mercury** is **essence**,\n**Lead** is **common**—\nboth are **postnatal substances** (後天) with form and appearance,\ncapable only of **nurturing vitality** (順而生男育女),\nnot of **eternal life’s** great medicine.\n\nOnly when **Mercury** descends and **Lead** ascends,\nuniting in the **Yellow Court**,\ncondensing **divine qi** and regulating **breath**,\ndoes one feel, in an instant,\na **boiling, surging** sensation—\nlike mist and smoke,\nlike tides and waves—\nthen does it become **True Lead**,\nworthy as the foundation for **elixir forging** (炼丹之本),\nas said:\n*\"Kan and Li unite to obtain the medicine.\"*\n\nThen, **Yang fire** (陽火) and **Yin elixir** (陰符) are stirred,\nascending from the **tail vein** (尾闾) to the **muddy pellet** (泥丸).\nThe **muddy pellet**, long storing **Yin essence** (陰精),\ncombines with this **True Lead qi** (真鉛之氣),\nforming a single entity—\nthis is what is called:\n*\"**Qian and Kun** unite to forge the **elixir** (結丹).\"*\n\nWhen **Yang qi** ascends to the **muddy pellet**,\nwhat manifestation does it show?\nA **refreshing clarity** in the head and eyes,\nunlike the usual **dullness and dizziness**,\nas if the wind disperses clouds and the sky clears—\na distinct transformation,\nthis is **True Mercury**.\n\nThe **Mercury** of before was still **common Mercury**,\nunfit to nourish the **embryo of immortality** (仙胎).\n\nWhen **Lead** and **Mercury** meet in the **muddy pellet**,\nthe **postnatal essence** and **postnatal qi** (凡精凡氣)\nmerge and transform,\nno longer seen as **Lead** or **Mercury**,\nbut as a **pure, cool, and tranquil** taste—\nrefined into **sweet dew divine water** (甘露神水),\nfragrant and sweet to the palate,\nunlike the usual **coarse essence and turbid qi**,\nthis is what the ancients called:\n*\"**Amrita** (醍醐) anointing the **crown\"** (灌顶).*\n\nSwallowed from the **upper palate** (上腭),\nit enters the **Yellow Court** to be **nurtured in warmth** (溫養),\nand is then **sealed and secured** (封固).\n\nThis **True Essence**, once born,\nsoftens the entire body like silk,\nneither sleep nor wakefulness is desired;\nwhile the usual **agitated body and mind** (動蕩之身心)\nnow rest in **perfect stillness** (浑然湛然),\nunmoved and unshaken—\nnaturally attaining **stillness** (安所止) and **halt** (得所止),\nwhat peril could there be?\n\nThis realm requires **Great Stillness and Great Clarity** (大静大定).\nIf one **harvests** (采取) with **single-minded focus** (一意凝注),\nnot scattering in the slightest,\nthe ancients called this:\n*\"**Non-harvesting harvesting** (不采之采) surpasses harvesting.\"*\n\nCultivators advance one step and see one step’s effects.\nIf there is no **true foundation** (真实处),\nthe practice remains incomplete.\n\nWhen **heavenly mechanisms** (天机) are fully revealed,\none may **attain verification** (取证) by oneself.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\nWisdom in knowing others is wisdom,\nself-awareness is clarity.\n\nOvercoming others requires strength,\nself-mastery is power.\n\nContentment brings wealth,\nunyielding resolve brings purpose.\n\nLosing nothing ensures longevity,\ndying yet not perishing is true life.\n\nThe **Way** of cultivating oneself\nlies only in **life and death** (性命).\nIf one seeks to **fulfill nature and establish fate** (尽性立命),\none must first **preserve the heart and nurture nature** (存心养性),\n**safeguard life and maintain form** (保命全形).\n\nI **cultivate** and **forge** it,\n**accumulate** and **pile** it—\nthen **original nature** (本性) endures and **heavenly fate** (天命) is mine.\n\nYet to **fulfill the heart** (尽心),\none must first **know nature** (知性),\nto perceive **the foundation of human life** (人生之本),\npurely **heavenly principle** (天理),\nunmixed with **human desires** (人欲)—\nthis is called **insightful wisdom** (睿智).\n\nFrom this, **restraining desire and preserving principle** (遏欲存理),\nconstantly **self-examining** (省察),\never **vigilant** (防闲),\nensuring **private desires are utterly purified** (私欲尽净),\n**heavenly principle flows freely** (天理流行),\n**piercing the original face** (洞见本来面目),\n**lucid and unobstructed** (惺惺不昧),\n**ever-clear** (了了常明)—\nthis is **perfect clarity and wondrous awakening** (圆明妙觉).\n\nThis is not **external speculation**,\nbut **one’s own true knowing**—\nno other can comprehend it.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Knowing others is wisdom,\nself-awareness is clarity.\"*\n\nTo **establish the vital mandate** (立命),\none must first **refine oneself** (炼己).\nRefining oneself has two aspects:\nOne is **material desires** (物欲)—\nif **material desires are not eliminated** (物欲不除),\n**heavenly purity will not manifest** (天真难现).\nTo abandon these and seek **elixir and alchemical immortality** (药结丹) instead\nis like a fine grain of millet mixed with weeds and tares—\nwithout first uprooting the weeds (芟荑),\nthe good and the bad will inevitably grow together (苗莠并植).\nOnly by first **conquering human desires** (胜人欲),\nconstantly **maintaining and preserving** (常操常存),\ncan one achieve **steadfastness in practice** (有定守),\nthough not necessarily **steadfastness in power** (有定力).\nHence it is said:\n*\"To conquer others is to have power.\"*\n\nThe second is **constitutional qi** (气质)—\nif **constitutional qi is not transformed** (气质不化),\nhow can the body **become firm** (身何由固)?\nThus, one **peels away the flesh to preserve the fluids** (剥肤存液),\n**peels away the fluids to preserve the spirit** (剥液存神),\n**peels away the spirit to return to the void** (剥神还虚),\nlayer by layer, stripping away until\none can **align with the Dao in truth** (与道合真).\nIf not **qi is robust and spirit is vigorous** (精固气壮),\nhow could one **vanquish all pathogenic forces** (战胜群阴),\n**sweep away the six external evils** (扫除六贼),\nso that **one’s inner and outer self becomes luminous as jade** (一身内外，精莹如玉),\n**transmutes the mortal form** (变化凡躯),\nand **refines into an immortal body** (炼成仙体)?\nHence it is said:\n*\"To conquer oneself is to grow strong.\"*\n\nWhen refining oneself is thus complete (炼己了矣),\nthe vital mandate is **established** (命已立矣).\nDoes the **work end here** (功不于此尽乎)?\nDoes the **Dao reach fulfillment here** (道不于此成乎)?\nThough it may seem so,\n**igniting the furnace has its time** (起火有时),\n**extinguishing the furnace has its moment** (止火有候).\nIf one does not **practice extinguishing the furnace** (止火之功) when the time is right (火足之时),\nthe **essence will move with the stirring of qi** (精必随气之动而动),\nthus one knows that **stopping to nourish the elixir** (止养丹)\nis like a poor man **accumulating wealth until he becomes rich** (积财而富),\n**ever-awakened with abundance** (常觉有余).\n\nHaving known how to **extinguish the furnace** (止火),\none must also **advance the furnace to nourish the elixir** (进火以养丹),\n**retreat the furnace to warm the elixir** (退火以温丹).\nOnly those with **resolute determination** (有志之士)\ncan **persistently and meticulously** (绵绵密密)\n**inhale and exhale without interruption** (不二之息).\nThe *Classic of Changes* (《易》) says:\n*\"Heaven moves with vigor,\nthe virtuous person **strengthens himself without ceasing** (自强不息).\"*\n\nThe **resolute determination** spoken of is indeed the resolve of the **willful** (有志之士).\nAfter this **nourishment and tempering** (温养),\nmerely **calm the mind and rest** (安神息),\nletting nature take its course (一任天然),\nwithout ever losing one’s grounding (无一时一刻之失所).\nAs **Master Zisi’s son** said:\n*\"The utmost sincerity knows no cessation;\nwithout cessation, it endures.\"* (至诚无息，不息则久)\nThis is the very meaning.\n\nAs for the **transformation of the mortal form** (凡身脱化) and the **ascension of the true spirit** (真灵飞升),\nit is much like the death of an ordinary man.\nBut the death of an ordinary man means the **dispersion of the spirit** (神散);\nwhile the death of the **sage** (圣人) means the spirit remains whole (神完).\nThough the form dies, the spirit lives on—\nhow could it not share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth? (与天地同寿耶)\nThis speaks of **mastering human nature and conquering desires** (知人道、胜人欲),\nstill rooted in the pursuit of **exhausting principle and perfecting nature** (穷理尽性).\n\nOnly when **nature is revealed and the mind illuminated** (性见心明),\nwhen one **penetrates the original source** (洞彻本原),\nwhen **spirit is strong and qi robust** (神强气壮),\nand when **all yin impurities are purged** (煅尽阴滓),\ncan one **fulfill nature and establish fate** (了性立命).\nFor **nature and fate are not two separate paths** (性命不分二途),\nbut return to the **primordial chaos before differentiation** (混沌未开之天),\nwhere **yin-spirit is extinguished and yang-spirit perfected** (阴神尽灭，阳神完成).\n\nEven in the stages of **refining essence into qi** (炼精化气)\nand **refining qi into spirit** (炼气化神),\nthere remains the **practice of extinguishing the furnace to nourish the elixir** (止火养丹).\n*The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) says:\n*\"If one clings to fullness without restraint,\none risks sudden ruin and humiliation.\"* (若也持盈未已心，不免一朝遭殆辱)\nThis is precisely the warning.\n\n**Refining essence into qi** marks the **beginning of gestation** (入胎之始);\n**refining qi into spirit** marks the **completion of gestation** (成胎之终).\nIf one does not **know how to extinguish the furnace** (不知止火),\nthen **qi will not enter the womb** (气不入于胎).\nThough essence is refined into qi,\nit may yet **revert to essence through the movement of qi** (因气之动而复化为精).\nMoreover, if one does not **know how to extinguish the furnace**,\nthen **spirit will not congeal in emptiness** (神不凝于虚空).\nThough qi is refined into spirit,\nit may yet **revert to qi through the movement of spirit** (因神之动而复化为气).\nThus it is said:\n*\"He who knows sufficiency is always sufficient,\nand thus never meets disgrace.\"* (知足常足，终身不辱)\nThe words of the **Supreme Sage** (太上) are no deception.\n\nWhen **spirit attains Great Stillness** (神归大定),\n**qi follows into Great Stillness** (气亦因之大定).\nA hundred years pass like a single day.\nA wandering thought risks **losing the elixir** (走丹).\nSuch a burden is long and arduous—\nonly the **resolute and willful** (强行有志者)\ncan **steadfastly remain grounded** (常止其所),\nenduring without decay over time (历久而不敝).\n\nWhen the **threefold alchemical fire is perfected** (三昧火化),\none **ascends to the celestial heights** (立上凌霄),\nliving even in death—\ntheir spirit suffices to share in the longevity of Heaven and Earth. (精神足与天地同寿)\nThe **beginning and end of the Golden Elixir** (金丹始终) are fulfilled here.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: The Sage Never Claims Greatness**\n\nThe **Dao** flows vast and boundless (大道汜兮),\nyet cannot be confined to left or right.\nAll things rely on it for life,\nyet it does not demand recognition for its deeds.\nIt accomplishes without claiming ownership.\nIt **clothes all things yet does not rule them** (衣被万物而不为主).\n**Constantly without desire** (常无欲),\nit may be called **small**.\nAll things return to it,\nyet it does not rule them—\nthus it may be called **great** (可名于大).\nTherefore, the **sage never claims greatness** (终不自为大),\nand thus **achieves true greatness** (能成其大).\n\nThe **Dao** is profound and boundless,\nits expanse without end.\nAs the *Odes* say:\n*\"Left, left—what the lord approves;\nRight, right—what the gentleman possesses.\"* (左之左之，君之宜之；右之右之，君子有之)\nFrom this, one sees how the **Dao adapts to the times** (随时取用),\nfulfilling all without fail,\nnourishing all without measure.\nWhat **Dao** is this?\nIt is the **origin of all things’ generation** (万物生生之本).\n\nThe **Dao** dwells in Heaven and Earth,\nand all things draw from it for life,\nyet it does not shun their chaos.\nBecause the **Dao lacks nothing** (道无不足),\nall things thrive without obstruction (其生无不畅).\nThough the **path of fulfillment** (生之遂之之道) is sufficient,\nand things rely on it to complete themselves,\nit is as if they **generate and fulfill themselves** (若物之自生自遂),\nwhile the **Dao does not appear to act** (道不见为有).\nWhat then is its accomplishment?\nThough unnamed, it **permeates Heaven and Earth** (天地之大),\nspanning the **four seas** (四海之遥),\ncovering all without exclusion (无人不被其涵濡),\nencompassing all without remainder (无物不荷其帡幪).\nLet things **generate and nurture themselves** (自生自育),\nwhile the **Dao seems unaware of birth or nurturing**.\nIt **universally protects all** (普护一切),\n**embracing all existence** (包涵万有).\nTruly, it **\"clothes all things yet does not claim life\"** (衣被万物而不以为生).\n\nWhen the **Dao’s work is complete** (道之功成),\nits vastness is beyond naming (浩浩乎无可名也).\n**Constantly without desire** (常无欲),\nit is **always pure and clear** (常清常净)—\nthe **true and eternal Dao** (真常之道).\nWhen viewed as **small** (就其小而名之),\neven the **humblest blade of grass or tree** (一草一木之微)\nis not excluded.\nIt **encompasses all existence** (弥纶万有),\nleaving no gap unfilled (无隙可寻),\n**undivided and complete** (浑然一团),\ntransmuting even the finest dust (纤尘悉化).\nThis is the meaning of **\"nothing can break it\"** (小莫能破之义).\nThus it is said:\n*\"Constantly without desire, it may be called small.\"* (常无欲可名于小)\n\nWhen viewed as **great** (就其大而名之),\nit **spreads across Heaven and Earth** (铺天匝地),\n**nurturing all life** (统育群生);\nit **endures from antiquity to the present** (亘古及今),\n**embracing all things** (包含万夤),\nyet **nothing is excluded, no one left out** (无一物之不归，无一夫之或外).\nThis is the meaning of **\"nothing can contain it\"** (大莫能载之旨).\nThus it is said:\n*\"All things return to it, yet it does not rule them—\nthus it may be called great.\"* (万物归焉而不为主，可名于大)\n\nHow **profound and hidden** is the **sage’s Dao** (何其费而隐哉)!\nThe **sage aligns with the True Dao** (与道合真).\nAt rest, they **guard the Center and embrace Oneness** (守中抱一),\nmerging with the **serene Heaven** (浑同于穆之天).\nIn action, they **follow things and respond to conditions** (因物随缘),\nembodying the **symbol of timely conduct** (俨寓时行之象).\nOnly Heaven is great;\nonly the **sage follows its example** (惟圣则之).\nThe **sage’s greatness is as Heaven’s** (圣实与天同其大).\nYet the **sage never claims greatness** (然圣终不以为大).\nOnly by **not claiming greatness** can one **achieve true greatness** (能成其大)—\nthis is what makes the **great sage** (大圣人) so.\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao’s vastness** (道之浩浩),\n**generating all things with abundance** (生万物而有余),\n**clothing all things with sufficiency** (被万物而至足).\nWhether small or great,\nit **encompasses all within**.\nThe **sage achieves greatness** (能成其大)\nthrough **rooted cultivation** (修造有本).\n\nNow, let us **delineate the initial practice**:\nWhen **sitting in meditation** (打坐之时),\nfirst **concentrate the spirit** (凝神),\nthen **regulate the breath** (调息).\nOnce the **spirit is concentrated** (神已凝了)—\nthere is no need for **overwhelming righteous qi** (浩然正气),\nnor for **utter grandeur and rigidity** (至大至刚),\nfilling Heaven and Earth.\nOnly that the **mind is free of agitation** (心无烦恼),\nthe **intent is unburdened** (意无牵挂),\nfeeling the **heart like an empty vessel** (心如空器),\nutterly devoid of attachment (一点不有).\nThe **mind melts like ice** (意若冰融),\nwith **not a single thought arising** (片念不生).\nThe **body stands erect** (此身耸立),\nas if a **mountain steadfast and unmoving** (恍如山岳镇静，不动不摇)—\nthus the **spirit-light descends** (神光下照),\nilluminating the **qi-caverns** (于气穴之中),\n**silently observing** (默视)\nas the **yin-ascending qi** (吾阴蹻之气)\nand the **palace-of-the-cinnabar-field qi** (绛宫之气)\n**converge within the alchemical cauldron** (两相会于丹鼎之中).\n\n「I then use the gentle, warm **spirit-fire** (温温神火) to carefully refine and cook,\nwith the subtle, yielding **wind** (巽风) softly blowing and exhaling—\nnaturally, the **essence melts** (精融) and the **qi transforms** (气化).\n\nHow do I know this is **refining essence into qi** (炼精化气)?\nBefore, I did not draw in **external qi** (外来之气),\nbut relied solely on my **inner heart-spirit** (吾心内之神),\nthe two harmonizing as one, blending into a unified whole.\nThen, the **yin-ascending qi** (坎离) and the **kidney essence** (阴精)\nwere each scattered, utterly independent,\nand even my breathing was not in accord.\n\nWhen I begin to **retrieve external qi** (收回外气)\nto regulate my **internal kidney essence** (制内里阴精),\nupon its arrival, the **yin-ascending qi** (阴精) naturally transforms.\nThe **qi of the heart and kidneys** (上下心肾之气)\nthen merges into one, naturally settling the **palace-of-the-cinnabar-field** (绛宫) in tranquility,\nand the **kidney storehouse** (肾府) in ease.\n\nThe **external breath** (外之呼吸)\nand the **internal true breath** (内之真息)\nmerge as one **qi** (合为一气),\nlike a husband and wife in perfect union—\ngathered yet never dispersing.\nDay fills, month overflows,\nand the **true yang** (真阳) begins to manifest its forms.\n\nThis is the clear sign of **transforming qi** (化气).\n\nOnce **qi is transformed** (既已化气),\nI proceed to **ascend upward** (向上之事).\nWhat is **ascending upward** (向上之事)?\nAt this time, when **breathing unites** (呼吸合)\nand **spirit and qi exchange** (神气交),\nit condenses in the **alchemical field** (丹田),\nswirling and rising, like a living dragon swimming—\nendless transformations occur in a single day.\n\nI merely **concentrate the spirit within** (凝神于中),\n**direct the breath outward** (注息于外),\nand **listen to its natural course** (听其天然).\nNaturally, it reaches **ultimate stillness** (静极)\nand then **spontaneous motion** (动),\nthen **ultimate motion** (动极)\nand then **spontaneous stillness** (静)—\nthis is **refining qi into spirit** (炼气化神).\n\nWhen **stillness is firmly established** (静定久久),\nmy **qi becomes more regulated** (我气益调),\nand the **swirling essence** (宛转流行于丹田者)\nnow refined to perfection, feels **both present and absent** (似有似无),\n**both moving and still** (若动若静).\nThe **essence is imperceptible** (精看不觉),\nbut the **subtle convergence is known** (细会始知).\n\nAt this juncture, I must **extinguish all awareness** (务将知觉之心),\n**dissolve all thoughts** (百想无存),\n**dispel all illusions** (万虚全消).\nThe **spirit and qi of the alchemical field** (丹田交会之神气)\nare then left to **self-stir and self-regulate** (自鼓自调),\n**self-warm and self-fortify** (自温自煅).\nI merely **maintain emptiness and stillness** (致虚守寂),\n**entirely yielding to nature** (纯任自然).\nThe **spirit enters the qi** (神入气中) yet is unaware,\nthe **qi surrounds the spirit** (气周神外) yet is unnoticed.\n\nAfter such a **refinement** (烹炼),\na **fragrant breeze** (香风) naturally arises,\nrising to **penetrate the hundred meridians** (上冲百脉),\npervading the body in **scented transformation** (遍体熏蒸).\nThis is called **spirit giving birth to qi** (神生气).\n\nAgain, I sense that **spirit and wisdom grow daily** (精神日长, 智慧日开).\nWithin the **single mind** (一心),\nonly a **single breath** (一息) arises from the **alchemical field** (规中),\npure and subtle, refined like jade.\n\nThis is called **qi giving birth to spirit** (气生神).\n\nThus, **spirit and qi nourish and generate each other** (神气交养, 两两相生).\nAt this stage, it is most fitting to **release all grasping and return to emptiness** (撒手成空),\n**neither clinging nor detaching** (不粘不脱),\n**as if the spirit exists yet the mind does not** (若有心, 若无意).\nThis is the **practical essence of refining spirit back to emptiness** (炼神还虚之实际).\n\nThese **three practices** (此三件功夫),\nthough requiring time, can be **attained simultaneously** (一时可行可到).\nThe **student must follow the Dao** (遵道而行),\nnot merely reaching **coarse convergence of spirit and qi** (神气粗交)\nbefore abandoning the seat—\nnor **leaving upon achieving great union** (神气大交),\nwhen the two are indistinct, **before attaining the realm of effortless, pure, and free stillness** (虚无清净自在之境).\n\nOne must **persist in this cultivation** (照此行持),\nbeginning with **refining essence** (炼精),\nuntil over time the **qi grows strong** (气长) and the **spirit flourishes** (神旺),\ntransforming into **pure, natural ease** (清净自然).\nThen, applying the **refining furnace techniques** (归炉工法),\none aligns with the **Heavenly cycle of filling and emptying** (天地盈虚消息),\nand the **four seasons’ qi manifestations** (一年春夏秋冬气象).\nOnly then is the **great cycle fully complete** (始完全一周).\n\nBy **diligently cultivating thus** (工夫照此修持),\nmy **qi becomes ever more refined** (我气益调),\nmy **spirit ever more still** (我神益静).\nWithin, there are **endless transformations** (无穷变化)\nand **inexhaustible vitality** (不尽生机).\nThrough **unceasing, day-and-night practice** (日夜行工),\n**continuous and meticulous** (绵绵密密),\n**stillness and insight merge** (寂照同归),\nand **true qi** (真气) naturally arises,\n**ascending to the brain’s marrow** (上朝泥丸),\n**descending to the cinnabar storehouse** (下流丹府),\n**penetrating the hundred meridians** (透百脉) and **piercing the flesh** (贯肌肤),\n**bursting forth with an unstoppable force** (勃然有不可遏之状)—\nthis is the **path of the River Vehicle** (河车之路),\n**naturally open** (自然而通).\n\nI merely **follow its course** (顺其所通)\nand **slightly guide it** (略微引起足矣).\nUnlike **errant external methods** (旁门左道),\nwhich **forcefully manipulate** (以自家私意空空去运)\nor **rigidly control** (死死去行),\nI do not **artificially stir or halt** (为之起止)\nbut **observe its own spontaneous motion and stillness** (观他自动自静).\n\nOver time, the **cinnabar is perfected** (丹成) and the **Dao is established** (道立),\n**walking through mists and flying through emptiness** (走雾飞空),\n**becoming a companion of Heaven** (与天为徒).\nThe **sage’s attainment of greatness** (圣人之成其大)\nis truly not a **light or easy matter** (轻易也已).\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Fifth: To Go Without Harm**\n\nHold the **Great Symbol** (大象),\nand the world will **turn toward it** (天下往).\nTo go **without harm** (往而无害),\nis to **rest in ease and tranquility** (安平泰).\n**Delights and baits** (乐与饵)\ncause the **passing traveler to stop** (过客止).\nThe **Dao’s outward expression** (道之出口)\nis **plain and without taste** (淡乎其无味).\nTo **look upon it, it cannot be seen** (视之不可见),\nto **listen to it, it cannot be heard** (听之不可闻),\nto **use it, it cannot be exhausted** (用之不可既).\n\nWhat is the **Great Symbol** (大象)?\nIt is the **Dao that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and things** (生天生地生人生物之大道).\nBecause it **encompasses all** (无所不包),\nit is called the **Great Symbol**.\n\nWhat **Symbol** (象) is there to hold?\nIt is **the Boundless** (无极).\nYet **without a symbol is the symbol** (无象为象),\nand what **holding** (执) is there to grasp?\n**Without grasping is grasping** (亦无执为执).\nThus, one does not **contradict the Dao** (斯于道不悖).\n\nIf one can **always maintain and preserve** (常操常存),\n**never forgetting nor abandoning** (勿忘勿助),\nthen the **Great Symbol is held** (大象执焉),\nand the **Great Dao is present** (大道在焉).\n\nIn ancient times, **Confucius told Yan Yuan**:\n*\"One day’s effort in self-restraint and returning to ritual*\n*brings the world to the **Dao of Ren** (归仁).\"*\nThus, it is known that **where the Great Dao leads, the world follows** (大道所归, 天下所归).\nWhether **returning to humanity** (归人) or **returning to the Dao** (归道),\nall is **heartfelt sincerity** (心悦诚服).\nHow could there be **harm** (何害) in this?\n\nI know that **one qi permeates and transforms all things** (一气相贯通).\nAll **things transform in silence** (万物皆默化).\n**Merging and releasing**, **above and below rest in harmony** (上下相安)\nwithin the **Great Cycle of Heaven** (泰运之天).\nThis is the **direct return to nature’s essence** (直自然之依归),\nnot something **felt in an instant** (非一时所感激).\nIf one merely **adorns the ears and eyes for a moment** (徒饰片时之耳目),\nit **will not fail to flow continuously** (未始不源源而来).\nBut if one **listens to refined music** (世之雅乐) or **enjoys fragrant baits** (香饵),\nit is enough to **make a passing traveler pause** (令过客停骖),\n**dallying without departing** (流连不去).\nYet such pleasures can **only be temporary** (可暂而不可常).\n\nThe **Dao is without taste** (道无味),\nnot like **rich, fatty, sweet, or crisp** (肥浓甘脆)\nthat **makes one chew endlessly** (令人咀嚼不已),\n**satiating without limit** (餍饫无穷).\nYet **what truly satisfies the palate and delights the heart** (人之爽口悦心者)\n**is never wearying** (自不厌焉).\n\nThis is the **ultimate taste within the Dao’s plainness** (无味中之至味),\n**not to be compared with the world’s overbearing flavors** (非世味之浓所可拟).»\n\n「Though the Dao has no fixed place or form, it is difficult to conceive and even harder to grasp. Hence it is said: *\"It cannot be seen, yet cannot be exhausted; it cannot be heard, yet cannot be drained.\"* Such is its nature—**encompassing heaven and earth without excess**, **conforming to all things without omission**. This is why the Dao is called great.\n\n**A scholar must know where to aspire!**\n\nThis speaks of how a person must first **align with the harmonious exchange of heaven and earth** (天地交泰) before they can **fuse and disperse** (融融泄泄) in such a way—**not merely like refined music that lingers in the heart or fragrant baits that tempt the senses**, but rather to evoke **sighs of admiration without end**.\n\nYet such a realm is not easily attained. If one is in the throes of **private desires raging** (私欲甚炽) and **vital qi fading** (血氣將衰), and does not first **proceed from the realm of intense motion** (极动之处) to **gradually reach the state of stillness** (静地), then **the mundane heart will not perish** (人心不死), **the Dao-heart will not arise** (道心不生), **the ordinary breath will not cease** (凡息不停), and **the true breath will not manifest** (真息不見).\n\nOnly when **stillness follows extreme motion** (动极而静之际), must one **avoid letting true intention** (真意) dominate. This intention is **yin in nature**, belonging to **the category of *ji* earth** (己土).\n\nSoon, one will feel **dimly vague and indistinct** (恍恍惚惚), as **yin and yang intermingle** (阴阳交媾). Then, one enters **the boundless realm of profound obscurity** (杳冥之境)—**like a dream yet not a dream**, **like waking yet not fully awake**.\n\nWithin this settled stillness, **suddenly a thread of warm qi arises** (一缕热气), **mingling and flowing continuously** (混混续续). As **the qi flows freely and the spirit harmonizes** (气畅神融), the two **converge within the Yellow Palace** (黄房之间)—**on the verge of distinction yet indistinct**, **indistinct yet suddenly distinct**. This is the **manifestation of true *yan* lead** (真铅现象).\n\nThen, **the heart’s blossoms surge forth** (心花怒发), **warm qi fuses** (暖气融融), **the primordial spirit leaps** (元神跃跃)—**not through external provocation**, but **naturally arising**. Thus, **the signs of the Mysterious Pass** (玄关兆象) and **the foundation of the Great Ultimate** (太极开基) are realized.\n\nAt this moment, one must **employ a single point of true heart** (一点真心), **issuing true intention** (发真意) to **contain and gather** (收摄之). This intention is **yang in nature**, belonging to **the category of *wu* earth** (戊土).\n\nIn essence, it is **one intention**, merely **dividing the foundation of motion and stillness** (动静之基) into **the earths of *wu* and *ji*** (戊己之土).\n\nFor when **the Mysterious Gate** (玄牝) remains unopened and **chaos prevails** (混沌之中), **true intention** (真意) as the master is **the intention of boundless wonder** (无欲观妙)—**called *yin* earth**. But when **the Mysterious Gate opens and true essence manifests** (玄牝开而真机现), **one observes desire through its aperture** (有欲以观其窍)—**called *yang* earth**.\n\n**One is the nameless origin of heaven and earth;**\n**the other is the named mother of all things.**\n**Generating heaven, earth, humans, and beings,**\n**all arise from this single point of true intention** (真意), **flowing through them like a thread**.\n\n**A cultivator who can master and govern this true intention** (真意主宰运行) will **not be swayed by sensation into thought**, nor **driven by motion into distraction**. As it is said:\n*\"The Celestial Pass is under my control;*\n*the Earthly Axis is in my heart.*\n**The cosmos resides within the body;**\n**all transformations spring from the mind**—\n**all these are the operations of this moment’s luminous awareness** (灵觉), **to be mastered and sustained**.\"\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"If one lingers too early in the breath,*\n**the true essence does not yet appear** (真机未现), **and gathering it is futile** (采之无益);\n*if one lingers too late,*\n**mundane thoughts have already arisen** (凡念已起), **and gathering it will be mixed with impurities** (夹杂), **unfit as medicine for refining one’s essence** (不堪为我炼功大药).\n**This requires great wisdom and great strength**—\nonly then can one **recognize it clearly and hold it firmly** (认得清、把得定) in this single breath, **as the foundation for attaining immortality and sainthood** (成仙证圣之本).\n\nThough this **Mysterious Pass** (玄关) begins with **soft and delicate qi** (柔脆之气), **one feels only a faint warmth rising from the lower *dan*** (下元), yet over time it **surges through the body** (踊跃周身), **as if unstoppable**. A student must **discern it clearly at its subtlest stage**, **sustaining it with true intention** (以我真意主持) **without the slightest dispersion**. With time, the **qi-essence grows mighty** (气机大有力量), **allowing it to rise naturally, unchecked and unrestrained** (兀兀腾腾). One must **follow its course without added intention or interference** (不加一意，不参一见)—**then it is obtained**.\n\nWhen the **qi-essence is robust and flourishing** (气机壮旺), **a single moment of stillness triggers the Celestial Essence’s motion** (天机发动), **rapid as lightning**. Even in **the midst of all clamor**, it cannot be restrained.\n\n**One must have a heart of luminous awareness** (灵觉之心) to **master it**—**then there will be no flaw**.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**\n*\"When one is about to close them, they must first be fully extended;*\n*when one is about to weaken them, they must first be fully fortified;*\n*when one is about to discard them, they must first be fully employed;*\n*when one is about to seize them, they must first be fully granted.\"*\nThis is called **the subtle art of *wei* clarity** (微明).\n\n**Softness overcomes hardness;**\n**weakness overcomes strength.**\n**A fish cannot survive outside the depths.**\n**The state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to the people.**\n**Heaven has its ebb and flow, wax and wane;**\n**humans have their lifespans, fortunes, and paths of fulfillment.**\nThis too is the **ordinary course of qi and fate** (气数之常).\n\nYet this **applies only to the common masses** (凡夫), **not to the sages** (圣人). For **the sages possess the power to reverse heaven and earth** (挽回天地之能) and **the virtue to invert the *qian* and *kun*** (扭转乾坤之德)—**nothing more than inverting yin and yang** (颠倒阴阳) and **counteracting the workings of *dao* creation** (逆施造化).\n\nFor instance, **when autumn arrives**, **all things withdraw**, yet **one struggles to close and weaken** (欲歙弱而难整). The sages **then extend the vital breath of heaven and earth** (张天地之气运) and **strengthen the functional capacity of the vital qi** (强血气之功能).\n\n**When winter comes**, **all things decay**, yet **one seeks to wither and seize** (欲槁夺而难生). The sages **then revive the cosmic essence** (气象之重兴) and **grant the years and months as their own** (岁月之我与者).\n\nThis is **both the subtlest and the clearest** (至微而至明), **both the most ordinary and the most extraordinary** (实常而实异)—**a truth only the sages can fathom**.\n\n**To transform danger into safety,**\n**to reverse chaos into order,**\n**requires not mere mortal courage but divine transformation** (神化).\n\nYet **the essence of their return-and-restoration technique** (返还之术) is simply **softness** (柔) and **weakness** (弱).\n**Only because they are soft do they overcome hardness;**\n**only because they are weak do they overcome strength.**\n\nWhat is their method?\n*\"If humans lack precision, they perish;*\n**if fish lack water, they die.**\n**Once a fish is removed from the depths,**\n**the waters dry and life’s essence fades** (水涸而生机息矣).\n\n**Humans and fish share the same dependency on water.**\nBut it is not **the water of heaven’s dew** (天露之水),\nnor is it **the water of the Dao’s profound depths** (造道渊深),\n**the primordial water of unity** (一元之水).\n\n**It flows ceaselessly** (汩汩乎来), **frequently nourishing** (频相灌溉).\n**Zhuangzi once said:**\n*\"They moisten each other with dew;*\n**they breathe on each other with vapor—*\n**yet better still is to forget each other in the rivers and lakes.\"*\nThis is his meaning.\n\n**Later generations of heterodox schools** (旁门) **mistake tangible, material essence** (有形有质之精) for **the foundation of cultivation and longevity** (修炼长生之本), **utterly failing to grasp the Dao as a substance**—**vigorous, upright, and pure**, **its essence arising from profound obscurity, boundless void, and spontaneous naturalness** (恍惚杳冥、虚无自然而生者).»\n\nThe secrets of alchemical fire and the essence of culinary mastery are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the **sage-teacher** (聖師) does one reveal them, only to the **utterly sincere** (至誠) does one approach them, and only to those who have **deeds and virtue**, who **seek the Way with humility** (虚心访道), and who **sincerely pursue a master** (竭誠求師) can the **chance of Daoist attainment** (仙緣) be forged.\n\nFor the **heavenly mechanisms** (天機) are profound and hidden, the **weight of heaven and earth** (天地至重) is supreme, and the **ghosts and spirits** (鬼神) hold them in reverence. To recklessly transmit these to the unworthy invites **calamity upon the Nine Ancestors** (殃遺九祖). It is like the **state’s most vital implements** (國家利用之密器)—they cannot be casually revealed to others.\n\nThus, the **noble person** (君子) keeps them **meticulously concealed** (缜密而不出), and the **seeker** (學者)—does he grasp this truth?\n\nThis speaks of those who cultivate the Dao: they truly hold **the cosmos in their grasp** (宇宙在手), and **all transformations arise from their mind** (萬化生心). Yet still, they need only **observe the Dao of Heaven** (天之道) and **grasp its operation** (执天之行), following it to take and opposing it to act—this suffices.\n\nIt is not a matter of **harboring vital force within lethal force** (寓生機於殺機之中), but rather what is called **the supreme yin, resplendent** (至陰赫赫), and **the supreme yang, austere** (至陽肃肃). The resplendent arises from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To take the supreme yang from the supreme yin—this is the **seizing of opportunity** (資機).\n\nIf a person can **plunder yang from the black mountain’s cavern** (黑山窟), or **extract treasure from the demon’s lair** (鬼窩里), then they are **stealing vital force from lethal force**. Yet all this is done within the **void of heaven and earth**, or **plucked from the stillness of the human body**—this is the **true essence** (真精), not the **common essence of the world** (世之凡精).\n\nIf one can **plunder it without losing the moment**, and **apply it with a single effort**, then there will be **progress in proportion to the work**. I urge the seeker to **yield with softness** (以柔), to **weaken with humility** (以弱), to **establish virtue and deeds** (立德立功), so as to **earn the favor of the divine and heavenly** (神天之佑), and thus receive the **transmitted incantations of the immortals** (仙人傳授口訣).\n\nOtherwise, even the greatest matters—those that **stir heaven and earth and move ghosts and spirits**—though even the immortals **rarely transmit them**. For the **heavenly mechanisms are most secret** (天機至密), the **heavenly laws are most strict** (天律最嚴), and they **cannot be defied**.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.\nIf the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.\nIf the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their siblings.\nIf the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants.\"*\nYet none of these are possible—why? Because **without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand**, and **without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move**.\n\nWhen we combine the words of the sages, we see that **the state’s most vital implements cannot be lightly shown to others**.\n\nLater generations of cultivators must not treat the **Great Dao as a public matter**, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they **invite heavenly retribution** (天譴) and **regret it forever**. This is the meaning of **\"public yet not public, not public yet public\"** (有公而不公，不公而公)—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao Ever Does Without Doing**\n\nThe Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could **guard this**, all things would **transform of themselves**.\nWhen transformation is about to arise, I shall **restrain it with the nameless Primordial** (無名之朴).\nThe nameless Primordial—**it too will not desire**.\nThrough **non-desire, stillness** (不欲以靜), the world will **settle of itself**.\n\nThough the Dao is naturally without doing, yet to **fixate on non-doing** becomes the **doctrine of stubborn emptiness** (顽空之學). One must **root oneself in non-doing** (無為植其本) while **beginning action** (有為端其用)—**non-doing within doing**, **doing yet still non-doing**. Thus the **essence stands firm** (體立) and the **Dao moves** (道行), the **Dao is complete** (道全) and **virtue is fulfilled** (德備).\n\nThis is the **\"ever-responsive yet ever-still\"** (常應常靜), the **\"ever-quiet yet ever-alert\"** (常寂常惺). When released, it **fills all six directions**; when withdrawn, it **hides in the central void**. Even in this **boundless, formless moment** (沖漠無蹤), there is the **probity of seated illumination, leaving nothing unobserved** (坐照無遺之概).\n\nThough it is called **non-doing**, yet **doing is contained within it**; though it is called **doing**, yet **non-doing encompasses it**. Thus the **Great Dao is within me**, the **Great Root ever endures**.\n\nEven the most exalted lords and kings—if they lack this Dao as their foundation, then **all things are severed and difficult to transform**. Only by **holding fast to this Dao** can **all under heaven—people and things—harmonize in their natures**, **resonate in their breath**, and **transform silently and imperceptibly**, until **great peace takes form**.\n\nYet in times of prolonged tranquility, the **ancient Dao is hard to uphold**. This is the **inevitable course of human inclination** (情所必至) and the **fixed principle of things** (理有固然)—there is no cause for wonder.\n\nWhen **creation and destruction recur frequently**, and **luxury arises**, then **human hearts grow more treacherous**, and **calamities multiply**. This too is the **fate of heaven and earth**, from which **no one can escape**.\n\nOnly the **sage possesses the methods of enduring prosperity** (保泰持盈之法) and the **strategies of lasting governance** (久安長治之謀). In the age when **culture first emerges**, they **refine the nameless, undifferentiated Primordial** (浑然無名之太朴)—**without doing, without action, without thought, without deliberation**—and **apply it to themselves and to others**, **guiding those before and leading those behind**, **purely in accordance with Heaven**, unmixed with human contrivance. Thus they **stabilize the court within** and **pacify the world without**.\n\nThe **first line of the *Hexagram of Array*** (屯之初九) says: *\"The sun lingers, beneficially residing in the upright\"*—this is the **first stabilization of the unenlightened age**.\n\nJust as **stone contains jade and the mountain gleams**, and **water cradles pearls and the river enchants**, even the **primordial and undifferentiated** (凡朴) has such power—how much more so the **nameless Primordial**? To **unify all people and things under its governance**?\n\nIf it is not **restored to its original, undivided state** (不歸浑穆), then it is **impossible to make the extremes converge** (會極歸極) or **ensure all attain the ease of the mat and cushion** (咸登衽席之安).\n\nOnly by **not knowing yet knowing**, by **following the pattern of the Emperor** (順帝之則), by **forgetting morality and the Dao**, by **not recognizing the unity of Heaven and humanity**—only thus does one **truly attain it**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The nameless Primordial—it too will not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness—then the world **sets itself aright** (天下自正).\"*\nThis is the **tranquil and undemanding governance** (恬淡無為), the **natural order without contrivance** (郅治無為), where **the ruler does not know what he transforms**, and **the people do not know what they respond to**. The ruler and the people **both rest in the Dao of non-doing**, and there is **an unknowing yet natural harmony**.\n\nThus **Shun governed without doing**, and so **he alone was revered through the ages**.\n\nFor those who rule over the people, can they not take **non-doing as their foundation**?\n\nThis discourse on **governing the age** holds **non-doing as its root**. The **principles of self-cultivation** are no different.\n\nLords and kings are like **the human body**—**most exalted and noble**. The common saying is:\n*\"A human body is rare in a kalpa, yet once obtained, it is already a marvel.\"*\n\nYet, have you not heard of the **Dharma/True Teaching**—is it not far more splendid?\n\nIf one does not cultivate now, **one’s vital essence and spirit will dwindle**, and **life and body will falter**.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, **one’s qi is extinguished**, and **one knows not whether one becomes a ghost or a gnome** (為蜮), a beast or a bird.\n\nThrough the **six paths of cyclic existence** (輪回六道), one turns and turns again without cease—when will one ever break free?\n\nNow, with the **Dharma’s feast** (法筳) spread wide and the **Great Way** (大道) opened vast,\nshould one not hasten to practice and preserve it,\nlest the years slip by in vain?\n\nAll things, like the **human body’s five senses and hundred limbs** (五官百體),\nwith **vital essence and blood-qi** (血氣),\ncan uphold this **constant Dao of non-doing** (無為常道),\nthen **all anxieties naturally subside** (諸虑自息),\nand **the body’s framework is in perfect order** (百骸俱理).\nThe **skin becomes supple and the hair lustrous** (肌肤润泽，毛发晶莹),\nnot unlike **golden form and jade-like substance** (金相玉質).\n\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\nall things will **transform in harmony** (自化).\nThis is like **the inner light of a single mind** (一心内照),\nthen **changes resonate with mystic responsiveness** (通灵).\n\nYet **the fire of cultivation is not yet refined** (火候未纯),\nand **one’s qi and essence still linger** (氣質尚在).\nAt this juncture, **spirit is greatly purified** (精神大整),\nand **wisdom arises frequently** (智慧频生).\nSome delight in **discourse on past and future** (過去未來),\nto **showcase their talents** (以逞其才);\nothers take pleasure in **speaking of worldly achievements** (建功立業),\nto **boast before others** (以夸於世).\n\nAll these actions spring from **impure virtue/power** (道德未纯).\n\nThe elixir of jade nectar now perfected,\nonce more the furnace and cauldron are set in order,\nthe primordial *Bu* of the Nameless is reclaimed,\npoured into the Eight Trigrams Furnace.\nWithin, the divine fire of heaven burns naturally;\nwithout, the common hearth is adjusted in measure.\nAfter prolonged alchemical transformation,\neven the Nameless *Bu* is utterly forgotten.\n\nWhen one is **without knowing, without desiring**,\nserene and unadorned,\nthe mortal form undergoes transformation,\nreturning naturally to the **primordial One-Qi of Before-Heaven**—\nthus the Dao of the Transcendent is fulfilled.\n\nAs it is said:\n*\"By stillness without desire, the world will naturally align itself.\"*\n\nThis is the **single thread** that unifies the **Way of the Sovereign’s governance and self-cultivation**—\nthe thirty-eighth chapter:\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest is not virtue/power.\"*\n\nThe virtue/power of the Highest is not virtue/power,\nand thus it has virtue/power.\nThe virtue/power of the Lowest does not lose virtue/power,\nand thus it has no virtue/power.\n\nThe Highest acts without doing yet accomplishes nothing;\nthe Lowest acts and yet accomplishes something.\n\nThe Highest in benevolence acts yet accomplishes nothing;\nthe Highest in righteousness acts and yet accomplishes something.\n\nThe Highest in ritual acts yet none respond,\nso it raises its arm and forces compliance.\n\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nwhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\n\nRitual is but the **thinnest veneer of sincerity and trust**,\nyet it is the **beginning of chaos**.\n\nPrescience is the **flower of the Way**,\nyet it is the **origin of folly**.\n\nThus, the **true person** abides in substance, not in form;\ndwells in reality, not in ornament.\nHence, one discards the latter to take the former.\n\nIn the **ancient age**, the winds were vast and untrammelled,\neach following its natural course;\nthe waters deep and boundless,\neach resting in its own nature.\nAbove and below acted without contrivance,\nrulers and people shared in joy.\nSincerity and thickness became the custom,\nand disputes did not arise.\n\nHow profound and complete was the Way in those times!\nIt was because they abided in the **non-action of heaven**,\nfollowing nature’s spontaneous course.\n\nIn those days, the old were cherished as old,\nthe young as young,\nthe wise as wise,\nthe kind as kind.\nThey tilled the land with ease, took joy in their labor,\nfed on virtue and drank in harmony,\nknowing nothing of the names *virtue/power* or *Dao*,\nnor hearing of *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.\n\nYet they preserved their **primordial purity and integrity**,\nallowed their *qi* to move naturally,\nand harmonized with the flow of heaven and earth—\nas if untaught yet transformed,\nachieving without action,\nunited with virtue/power and the Dao,\nwithout conflict with *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.\n\nWhen *virtue/power* and *Dao* are spoken together,\n*Dao* is the **substance**, *virtue/power* the **function**.\nWhen *virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are discussed as a whole,\nthen *virtue/power* and *Dao* are again the **substance**,\nwhile *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are the **functions**.\n\nLater sages, though establishing these for the transformation of the people,\nnamed *virtue/power* and divided them into *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*—\nyet within *virtue/power* are *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*,\nand within *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* is *virtue/power*.\nThere is no separation, no lack.\n\nBut in later ages, *virtue/power* was divided.\nFurther still, *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* became fixated on one-sidedness.\nThis arose from the **shift of cosmic *qi*** and the **deceit of human hearts**.\n\nThe Transcendent One wished to return people to their roots,\nrestore them to their origin,\nand thus sighed:\n*\"The person of Highest virtue/power acts without doing,\nfollowing their nature without knowing of virtue/power—\nthus their virtue/power endures.\nThe person of Lowest virtue/power, knowing virtue/power’s excellence,\nloves its name and delights in its practice,\nfearing to lose it and thus their reputation.\nThese two minds—one divided, one consumed—\nshatter the singular sincerity of the Highest,\nwhere no duality remains, no thought lingers.\nFrom having virtue/power, they return to being without it.\"*\n\nMoreover, when the Highest acts without doing,\nthe people of the world align in one Way, one custom,\nall abiding in a world of non-action.\nWhen the Lowest acts with doing,\namid the rise of flourishing customs and varied governance,\nthey take joy in the constant of action.\n\nIs it not so?\nThose who forget contrivance **still the world’s machinations**,\nwhile those who delight in affairs **stir the world’s strife**?\n\nYet when times are exhausted, they return;\nwhen things are exhausted, they transform;\nwhen people are exhausted, they revert.\n\nIn this age of many affairs,\nwhen customs grow corrupt and hearts deceive,\nthe natural purity is long lost.\nThere must be a ruler who loves benevolence,\ngoverning with virtue/power, purifying the source, rectifying the root,\nturning chaos into order, peril into safety.\n\nThough forced to act,\nyet even in action, they adapt to the times,\nfollowing principle in their conduct—\naction remains non-action,\nthus the world is governed with ease.\n\nThen there are those who love righteousness,\nin times of disorder seeking to restore peace,\ntaking pride in sweeping away the old,\nyet unable to return to stillness.\nThough they may briefly pacify the world,\nrenewing people and things,\nyet those above and below emulate them,\nand the strife and contention among the people cannot cease.\n\nAs for the ruler of Highest Ritual,\nthe hearts of people grow ever more corrupt.\nThey practice the etiquette of reciprocity,\ndiscussing the ways of giving and receiving—\nsome generous in giving yet stingy in return,\nothers kind in granting favors yet vengeful in response—\nand cannot rest in tranquility.\nMorning brings changes, customs shift,\nyet they cannot harmonize near and far, great and small.\nThe slightest discord provokes raised arms and conflict,\nand war erupts anew.\nThey cannot dwell together in peace.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nwhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\"*\n\nDown to this day,\nas people grow more corrupt and affairs more complex,\nsincerity and trust have reached their ruin,\nand ritual alone is invoked to maintain order.\nYet such ornamentation, lacking inner sincerity,\nonly multiplies daily disputes and disputes over right and wrong.\nThose who rely on ritual to bind the hearts of people\nhave not considered that outward compliance does not stem from the heart—\nit must end in disaster and estrangement,\nseeking safety only to invite danger.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Ritual is the thinnest layer of sincerity and trust,\nyet it is the origin of chaos.\"*\n\n*\"As for wisdom, it is not some extraordinary strategy or foresightful scrutiny—it arises from sincerity and clarity, achieved without deliberation, without study, and without effort. It is as naturally luminous as a mirror; how could it compare to deceit or baseless trust?\n\nYet the superficial trappings of the Way are not the Way itself. Moreover, excessive scrutiny under the guise of clarity will inevitably lead to emptiness, deceit, and falsehood without one’s awareness. In oneself, one may pridefully claim exceptional insight, but this is merely the beginning of folly.\n\nThus, a true man of virtue possesses steadfast discernment and resolve. He knows that sincerity and depth are the essence of ritual, so he embraces substance over superficiality; he recognizes that empty ornamentation is not true wisdom, so he seeks the real over the illusory. When discernment in selection is proper, the Great Way is not difficult to restore.\n\nThis explains why, as morality decays, benevolence and righteousness emerge; when benevolence and righteousness decay, ritual and wisdom take their place—ever descending, a natural consequence of human nature and custom, nothing to marvel at.\n\nAs for cultivation, when swallowing saliva and breathing *qi* appeared, the Way shifted; when herbal alchemy and elixir refining emerged, the Way shifted again. Down to today, myriad false paths abound—beyond reckoning! Who still understands that the *xuanguan* (玄关)—that single orifice—is the essence of cultivation?\n\nI now reveal it to people: To perceive this *xuanguan*, one must wait after great toil and great rest before its nature becomes clear. It is also said: *'When thoughts arise, that is the ailment; not clinging is the remedy.'* And again: *'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and you become a Buddha in this instant.'* Ultimately, it is about ceasing the tumult of worldly desires and杂念 (*zaonian*), awakening from the chaos—this is the *xuanguan*, the 'bank' one returns to.\n\nIt is also said: *'The other shore is not distant; the return of light and reflection is the shore itself.'* Yet fear arises: before the *xuanguan* opens, one may forcefully seek it; after it opens, one may obsessively guard it. Such fixations only stir confusion—like the sky, originally cloudless, yet when the clouds disperse, the vast, wondrous expanse appears. But if, after the clouds vanish, one reintroduces smoke and dust, the once-clear sky becomes constricted, murky, and unrecognizable.\n\nThe Buddha said: *'Dwell thus, subdue the mind thus.'* Such profound truths cannot be articulated in words—words only distort them. Nor can they be grasped through thought—thought only errs.\n\nAt the moment before the *xuanguan* opens, I simply follow its natural illumination. Once it opens, I rest in its effortless clarity. If thoughts scatter, I withdraw them—that is all. If the mind grows dim, I steady it—that is all. How simple and direct!\n\nYet people complicate matters by layering bed upon bed, seeking motion in motion, stillness in stillness—only to fall into contrivance. The *xuanguan* lies plain before them, yet they obscure it with later-day intellect.\n\nI reveal a key principle: Let the thoughts churn endlessly, unresolved. The moment you awaken to their nature, they vanish instantly—that *is* the *xuanguan*. Thus, cultivation depends on this awakened awareness, like the unobstructed sun in an endless sky, ever luminous. The slightest shadow plunges one into the darkness of hellish defilement. If you dispel the clouds, the blue sky and white sun stand revealed.\n\nBut if worldly thoughts arise, you remain trapped in the ordinary. This is not the foundation of the immortals.\n\nIn truth, the Daoists have no secret beyond *mingxin jianxing* (明心见性)—enlightening the mind, realizing true nature—this is the essence of cultivation.\n\nIf asked what the elixir is, it is the primordial *qi* of the *dantian* (丹田), the unborn essence. Yet this essence, when united with the innate divine spirit (*yuanshen*), becomes the preheaven *taiji* and *wujji* (太极、无极), the primordial command before parents were born.\n\nIf one establishes one’s nature as one’s fate and fulfills one’s fate through nature, then eternal life is attained.\n\nBut those who seek the *xuanguan* of the watery realm, desiring to forge the golden elixir, must first harness the preheaven breath (*shenxi*). Without it, they cannot refine, temper, or nurture—preheaven nature and preheaven fate cannot unite, and the five and six energies cannot coalesce into the golden elixir.\n\nEven so, once preheaven nature and fate are attained, without true *taixi* (胎息), it is like a man and woman unable to wed—no union, no offspring. Thus the *Danjing* says: *'True intent is the matchmaker.'* Now it is said: *'True breath is the matchmaker'*—does this not contradict the ancient texts?\n\nThe unenlightened mistake *zhanyi* (真意) as the divine essence of elixir refinement and union; *zhanyi* (真息) as the means. Yet both are merely the convergence of spirit and *qi*.\n\nWithout true breath, true *qi* cannot ascend and descend, unite, or nurture the formation of the primordial pearl. With true breath but no true intent to command, guide, and seal it, the breath cannot flow freely, advancing and retreating as it will.\n\nThus, true intent is the key to elixir refinement.\n\nYet true intent, without the original divine spirit, originates from where? Only when the *xuanguan* first opens does one recognize this true intent. Then, one must hold it fast, as Yanzi (颜子) revered his principles with unwavering devotion—thus it is attained.\n\nMoreover, the divine spirit’s manifestation *is* true intent, *is* a single good deed, *is* the way of attaining all things through one.\n\nIf students recognize this clearly, the foundation of the Great Elixir is established.\n\nChiuzu (邱祖) once said: *'If the breath is even a hair’s breadth undetermined, the fate is not your own.'* I tell students: To seek longevity, first subdue the breath.\"\n\n「Yet subduing the *qi* has two meanings: one is to suppress and store this *qi* within the inner palace (中宫), remaining still and unmoved; the second is to regulate and govern it strictly, for longevity lies precisely in this mastery of *qi*.\n\nBeyond this, there is no other Dao. Those who practice must adhere to this principle, lest they betray my earnest intentions.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: Taking Humility as the Foundation**\n\nIn antiquity, those who attained *One* (得一者):\nThe heavens gained *One* and became clear,\nThe earth gained *One* and became tranquil,\nThe divine spirit gained *One* and became luminous,\nThe *gu* (谷, grains) gained *One* and became abundant,\nAll things gained *One* and thus came to life,\nAnd lords and kings gained *One* to establish their virtuous rule over the world—\nThis was the singular purpose of *One*.\n\nThe heavens without clarity would fear fragmentation,\nThe earth without tranquility would fear upheaval,\nThe divine spirit without luminosity would fear extinction,\nAll things without life would fear annihilation,\nAnd lords and kings without virtue would fear downfall—\nTheir lofty status would tremble.\n\nThus, the noble rely on humility as their foundation,\nThe exalted rely on lowliness as their base.\nHence, lords and kings call themselves *gu* (孤, lone), *gua* (寡, few), and *bu gu* (不谷, unworthy)—\nThis is their adherence to humility as the foundation, is it not?\n\nTherefore, the multitude of chariots lacks chariots,\nAnd they do not desire to gleam like jade or stand firm like stone.\n\nThe Great Dao is none other than *One*.\nWhat is this *One*? (一者何)」\n\nThe primordial *hóngmèng* before differentiation—this original *yuánqì*, vast and formless, the boundless *wújí*—gave birth to the *tàijí*, the ultimate principle that generates all things.\n\nIn essence, *yuánqì* is formless, thus called *wújí*. All things arise from *wújí* and take shape, truly the root of the world, thus called *tàijí*. This is the Dao.\n\nThe sage, unable to name it, yet naming it, thus says *One*.\nWithout *One*, there are no things; without things, there is no *One*.\nTo possess it is to live; to lose it is to perish.\nFrom the beginning of *yuánshǐ* onward, those who obtain *One* and manifest form and likeness—endless, unceasing, generating without end—whether vast as the *zhōusha* sands or fine as dust, none can escape it.\n\nAs the *Zhōngyōng* says:\n*\"To see it, you cannot see it;\nTo hear it, you cannot hear it;\nTo embody it, you cannot abandon it.\"*\nWhat else could this be?\n\nThus, in summary:\nThe heavens’ clarity comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe earth’s tranquility comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe spirit’s luminosity comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe valley’s resonance comes from obtaining *One*;\nAll things’ vitality comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe sovereign’s rectification of self and the world comes from nothing but obtaining *One* to uphold it.\n\nThough great and small differ in form,\nNoble and base diverge in path,\nExterior and interior vary in refinement,\nDark and bright divide in kind,\nGhosts and humans span the unseen—\nHow could anything transcend this *One* as its embrace?\n\nEven the heavens, most exalted, would fear collapse without *One*;\nThe earth, most vast, would fear upheaval without *One*;\nThe spirit, most subtle, would lose its luminosity without *One*;\nThe valley’s echo, full of *qi*, would falter without *One*;\nAll things, bearing form, would perish without *One*;\nThe sovereign, most high and noble, without *One* to uphold the world, would face peril in lofty rank and ruin in exalted name—\nHow could *One* be disregarded?\n\nIf one can disperse from *One* to the myriad things—vast, boundless, unfathomably deep—\nThen heaven, earth, spirit, valleys, all things, and sovereigns\nAll rely on this *One* as their sovereign,\nCoiling through the heavens, weaving the earth, without gaps or exhaustion, filling all without end…\nThus, its extremity is such:\nNothing is higher than the Dao,\nNothing is nobler than *One*.\n\nYet, from non-being to being—what is there to exalt?\nFrom subtlety to manifestation—what is there to prize?\nEven if nobility surpasses the capital,\nIt arises from *qi* emerging from the obscure to the manifest,\nThus it is said: *\"The noble relies on humility as its foundation.\"*\nEven if height reaches the boundless,\nIt arises from *qi* ascending from low to high,\nThus it is said: *\"The exalted relies on lowliness as its base.\"*\n\nAs for those in the world—\nThough their rank is high like a marquis,\nThough their honor is noble like a king,\nThey know the Dao arises from low to high,\nFrom humble to noble,\nThus they call themselves *\"gu\"* (lone), *\"guǎ\"* (few), *\"bùgǔ\"* (unworthy)—\nIs this not relying on humility as the foundation?\n\nIf one does not reside in humility,\nBut places oneself too high,\nThen the mind lacks mastery, the Dao cannot stand,\nThe heart becomes scattered, the spirit cannot coalesce.\nTo harmonize all things in great centrality and rectitude,\nReturning to the Dao—\nFew indeed can achieve this.\n\nEven those who drive many chariots cannot govern both center and periphery,\nYet those who drive but one chariot still hold sway within—\nThus, having chariots is like having none;\nGreed for many is not as good as embracing *One*.\n\nLike jade, if it gleams and multiplies,\nExcess breeds devaluation;\nLike stone, if it layers and piles,\nExcess breeds peril—\nThese are what the *Tàishàng* does not desire.\n\nBetter to embrace *One* in humility and lowliness,\nOnly then to ascend to heights beyond reach,\nTo nobility beyond speech—\nThis is the path of cultivating the Dao to true perfection,\nWhere there is only *One*, no second.\n\nConfucius said: *\"My Dao is one and penetrates all.\"*\nMencius said: *\"The Dao is but one.\"*\nYet—what is this *One*?\n\nThe ancients spoke of the *hónghóng-mèngmèng* state,\nWhere there is no thought, no dross—\nA single, empty yet luminous, still yet alert essence.\nThis essence, when vast, contains the *dharma-realm*;\nWhen narrow, not even a speck of dust can stand.\nWhen manifest, it reaches the eight *yí* and eight *huāng* without obstruction;\nWhen hidden, it scrutinizes even the finest dust.\nThis is the *extreme of wújí*,\nThe *non-divine divine*,\nTrue beyond naming, beyond imagination.\nThe Dao of nature and life—this is all.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* likens the sovereign to the human heart:\nIf the heart can constantly hold and preserve *One*,\nWithout forgetting or aiding it,\nMoment by moment reflecting inward,\nEver internally illuminating,\nThen it will not lose *One*.\n*One* is also *du* (solitary).\n\nSolitary as the realm of *dujue* (solitary awakening),\nWith awe and vigilance,\nThis is the originally most high and noble—\nPerhaps it can be long preserved.\nYet this is the study of cultivating nature,\nThus *shèn dān dú* (one mind in solitude) suffices.\n\nBut cultivating life involves action and effort—\nIf not beginning from the lowly,\nFrom the humble and impure,\nHow could the medicine be obtained?\nMuch less the *jīndān* (elixir)?\n\nThe lower refers to the lower *dāntián*;\nThe humble refers to the filthy lower realm.\nThe scholar, seeking *yīng lái fù* (the return of *yang*),\nWith *qi* surging upward,\nMust ascend from below to the apex—\nHow else could one obtain the pure and strong *qi*\nAs the treasure of eternal life?\n\nIf not from the lower *dāntián*, the turbid realm,\nWith divine fire descending to refine,\nHow could one forge the supreme *yang qi* as medicine?\nThe ancients said: *\"Seeking yang within yin, stealing treasure from the ghost’s lair\"*—\nTruly not false!\n\nAbove all, one must have a single heart, no dual thoughts—\nThis is the way of guarding *One*.\n\nWhen arriving at naturalness,\nForgetting self and others,\nThen *One* is obtained.\n\nWhen the cultivator reaches this state,\nAll things and matters under heaven\nAre handled with ease and appropriateness—\n*\"Obtaining One, all matters are complete.\"*\nIs this not true?\n\n「If one clings to form and image,\nChasing after them in frenzy,\nAnd is ensnared by the seven emotions and six desires,\nBy one’s body, family, and spouse—\nReluctant to cease, ever entangled,\nThen one is far removed from the Dao.\n\nDo not claim that external things are too manifold to speak of the Dao;\nEven matters like nurturing the mind and cultivating the nature,\nRefining the Dao and concocting elixirs,\nAdvancing fire and withdrawing talismans,\nGathering and sealing [the essence]—\nAll these categories are but empty constructs of their forms,\nEstablished as guidelines for later scholars.\n\nIf the cultivator’s heart retains even a thread of impurity,\nIt becomes an obstacle to the Dao.\nHence the *Tàishàng* says: *\"Make ten chariots vanish without chariots\"*—\nNot wishing to be polished like jade,\nOr rigid like stone,\nBut fluid and natural.\n\nFor the Dao is but one Dao;\nWhy should the scholar seek anything else?\n\n**Chapter 40: The Emergence of Existence from Non-Existence**\nThe reversal is the Dao’s movement,\nThe yielding is the Dao’s application.\nAll things under heaven arise from existence,\nExistence from non-existence.\nThe great Dao is inherent in all—\nWhole and complete in each,\nSo why seek further?\n\nYet one knows not that since the birth of humanity,\n*Qi* is constrained by form,\nThe mind is veiled by matter,\nAnd desires are stirred by knowledge—\nThus the Dao is drowned and lost in myriad ways.\n\nUnless one expels all external disturbances within,\nAnd disperses all outer agitations without,\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,\nSevering thoughts and forgetting artifice,\nHow could the primordial *yang qi* arise,\nAnd the Dao’s *qi* return?\n\nHence it is said: *\"The reversal is the Dao’s movement.\"*\nThis is the foundation of elixir refinement.\n\nWhen the medicine is returned to the furnace,\nAnd the elixir begins to form,\nMercury and lead merge as one—\nDay and night, one must observe internally,\nAnd the golden elixir shall manifest.\n\nFrom this point onward, with proper gathering,\nContinuous and unbroken,\nClear and ever-present,\nUsing humility to descend,\nAnd gentleness to refine—\nThis is the marvel of returning the elixir.\n\nYet it is not only in returning the elixir that this applies;\nFrom the initial practice to the completion of the elixir,\nOne must always focus the mind inwardly,\nAnd concentrate *qi* to achieve softness.\n\nFor the elixir is refined from the *Tàihé*’s singular *qi*;\nThe cultivator must treat it with humility and harmony.\nIf even a trace of roughness arises,\nThe mundane fire will stir,\nAnd harm the Dao.\n\nHence it is said: *\"The yielding is the Dao’s application.\"*\nAll matters under heaven,\nThough beginning with tangible forms and rules,\nDid not originate from existence itself.\nThe sage, when the great Dao is fulfilled,\nThough capable of infinite transformations and completeness,\nMust first gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-existence,\nThen the grand application flows,\nAnd boundless *qi* permeates the two extremes [of *yin* and *yang*].\n\nIf one does not refine from non-existence,\nHow could one achieve such boundless suffusion?\nHence it is said: *\"Existence arises from non-existence.\"*\n\nThe scholar’s essential cultivation:\nAt first, from non-existence to existence,\nRefining subtle *yang* from stillness;\nThen, from existence to non-existence,\nReturning to tranquility from the flourishing within;\nAnd finally, again from non-existence to existence—\nA blurred chaos, self and others forgotten—\nOver time, refining the three-inch *yang* spirit,\nAnd the six-foot golden body.\n\nThus, existence and non-existence cycle eternally,\nIterating without end.\nThe scholar must adhere to this principle,\nOr risk deviation.\n\nThis speaks of the great Dao of the golden elixir;\nIt is not something external,\nBut the true *qi* flowing through the body.\nIn stillness, it is deep as the abyss;\nIn motion, it surges like the tide.\nOnly those who cultivate with purity,\nFocus inwardly with clarity,\nCan reflect and verify it themselves—\nBeyond what words can exhaust.\n\nIf one understands that the motive of movement is the source of life’s origin,\nThen the elixir of eternal youth—\nCould it be anything else?\n\nMoreover, what is shared by all humanity,\nUnchanged, without deficiency—\nOnly when the body moves does the essence not flourish,\nWhen the mind moves does the *qi* not settle.\nThus arise birth, aging, sickness, and death,\nEndless cycles of suffering,\nUnceasing rounds of rebirth.\nTo escape all this,\nOne must first attain stillness in cultivation—\nOnly then can one grasp the motive of movement,\nAnd restore the original *qi* of life’s beginning.\n\nBut this motive of movement is subtle in force,\nTender in *qi*—\nA moment’s carelessness,\nAnd the *guǐ* water [of impurity] arises,\nTransforming the primordial flow into the coarse, post-heaven form,\nUnusable for the Dao.\n\nHence it is said: *\"See it, yet cannot use; use it, yet cannot see.\"*\nFrom this single movement onward,\nIf gathering is not lost to time,\nThen eternal life has its foundation,\nAnd the great elixir its root.\n\nIf one clings to existence and strives forcefully,\nOr holds fast to what one favors and guards rigidly,\nThough one may obtain the medicine at times,\nAnd await the elixir’s completion,\nIt cannot compare to the harmonious surge of *qi*—\nAnd because of later improper gathering,\nOr flawed refinement,\nThe singular *Tàihé qi* is injured by hasty, vulgar fire,\nThe Dao’s supreme *yang* vitality must endure humiliation and softness,\nOnly then can the elixir’s path be cultivated.\n\nHence the *Tàishàng* teaches:\n*\"Dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos,\nHarmonize its brilliance, align it with dust.\"*\n\nYet though the Dao moves through *qi*,\nIt remains non-existence giving rise to existence;\nIf existence is not nurtured with yielding,\nIt cannot return to the empty non-existence of Heaven,\nAnd how then could the Dao be fulfilled?\n\nOne may know that the return of the primordial *yang*\nIs the Dao’s motive,\nYet fail to understand that all forms must return to formlessness—\nFor form is the Dao’s trace,\nFormlessness its truth.\n\nUnderstanding this,\nOne’s cultivation and refinement will not lack a foundation.\n\n**Chapter 41: Great Vessels Take Time to Form**」\n\nThe superior scholar hears the Dao and diligently practices it;\nThe middle scholar hears the Dao, as if storing and forgetting it;\nThe inferior scholar hears the Dao and laughs greatly—\nOne who does not laugh is unworthy of the Dao.\n\nThus the *Jiàn yán* says:\n*\"Clarify the Dao as if in darkness,\nAdvance the Dao as if in retreat,\nSmooth the Dao as if in roughness,\nVirtue’s greatness as if in a valley,\nSupreme brightness as if in disgrace,\nBoundless virtue as if in scarcity,\nEstablished virtue as if in theft,\nSincerity as if in deception—\nThe great square has no corners,\nThe great vessel takes time to form,\nThe great sound is rare in tone,\nThe great form is shapeless.\"*\n\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless;\nOnly the Dao, when given and fulfilled, is good.\nBefore Heaven and Earth came into being,\nThere was a boundless, formless void—\nA vast, hazy *qi* of primordial harmony,\nFermenting for ages,\nUntil the *qi* transformed and filled the cosmos,\nAnd suddenly, with one awakening, the *Tàijí* opened its foundation.\n\nWhen it moved, it became *yang*—\nLight and clear *qi*, ascending to form Heaven;\nWhen it stilled, it became *yin*—\nHeavy and turbid *qi*, descending to form Earth.\nHeaven and Earth unfolded,\nAnd beings thrived and multiplied.\nAmong all the myriad folk,\nHow few can emulate Heaven and Earth’s functions?\n\nOnly the Sage, awakening from the chaos,\nRefines the Great Elixir.\nWith this, one governs the body,\nAnd with this, one cultivates the world.\nThough I dare not seal my lips in silence,\nNor teach indiscriminately to all,\nYet in accordance with *yuan* and *yì*,\nAnd adapting to things and beings,\nThis aligns with Heaven and Earth’s boundless, selfless measure.\n\nAt times, I meet the superior scholar—\nHearing my Dao, they joyfully pursue it,\nDiligently practice without doubt,\nSuch a person I have long sought to see.\n\nAt times, I meet the middle scholar—\nMy words pass their lips,\nEnter their hearts,\nYet this is commonplace,\nNothing extraordinary,\nThough I may love and cherish them,\nThey quickly lose interest.\nAlas, the world’s tastes are thick,\nWhile the Dao’s are thin,\nSagely intent is shallow,\nWhile worldly intent is deep—\nSome drift, some settle,\nAs if storing and forgetting,\nAnd they cannot escape this fate.\n\nAs for the inferior scholar,\nTheir habits deepen daily,\nTheir *qi* and nature grow perverse—\nHearing my Dao,\nThey doubt it as heretical speech that misleads the world,\nOr accuse it of gathering crowds for profit.\nHow could they know\nThat the cultivation of the gentleman begins with the union of *yin* and *yang*?\nThat the Sage’s Dao is none other than *yin* and *yang*?\nThat harmony yields life,\nWhile obstruction brings transcendence?\nThough their methods differ,\nTheir principle is one—\nYet the vulgar claim that immortality and sainthood are mere illusions.\nHow could such cultivation\nEver ascend to the Nine Heavens?\nOr else, how could one\nAlign with Heaven and Earth’s vastness,\nAnd the myriad beings’ flourishing,\nYet remain so constrained in nature?\nWhy are there so few immortals and sages today?\n\nThus I laugh at their boastful words,\nTheir false and eccentric practices.\nAlas, this Dao can only be spoken of to those who truly understand—\nIt is difficult to explain to the shallow and unlearned!\nThe mayfly does not know of dusk and dawn,\nThe cicada does not know of spring and autumn,\nThe well-frog does not know of rivers and seas—\nHow strange that they should laugh?\n\nOne who does not laugh is unworthy of seeing\nThe Dao’s utmost evenness and constancy,\nIts utmost divinity and strangeness—\nFor divinity and strangeness lie within the ordinary.\n\nMoreover, the Dao has no fixed form or sound,\nYet those of the world who cling to rigid virtue,\nGuarding themselves like a cornered beast,\nCannot flow freely and naturally.\nI, however, am boundless without bounds,\nA unified whole,\nNever confined by edges—\nHow could there be any hesitation?\n\nThe Great Elixir’s path is slow to manifest,\nYet its truth is swift to fulfill.\n\nAll things that are easily attained are not beautiful to behold,\nAnd those rushed to completion are not great vessels.\nI can follow step by step, ascending without expecting swift results,\nNot reckoning shallow gains—\nDwelling long in the Dao, it shall surely be accomplished—\nWhy should I regret myself?\n\nIn essence, the Dao is rare in speech, naturally effortless,\nIts form vague and elusive.\nIf I can attain ultimate emptiness and profound stillness,\nThen without sound, the Great Sound emerges,\nWithout form, the Great Form takes shape!\n\nApplied to the four seas, it remains ever true,\nTransmitted through ten thousand generations, it knows no end—\nHow could it merely be revered in one age,\nAnd fail to shine brightly across all ages?\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"In that place, there is no evil,\nIn this place, there is no decay.\"*\nThe Dao’s establishment and practice\nTruly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.\n\nWho is it that acts for the Dao?\nWho is it that receives from the Dao?\nIt is also said:\n*\"To practice the Dao is to lend it and see it fulfilled.\"*\nThis speaks of those who embrace the Dao in the world—\nTheir use is never insufficient,\nThey nourish all things without depletion,\nThey encompass the dusty realm with abundance,\nAnd yet bring about the Great Transformation—\nTruly, they are the highest of scholars.\n\nThe Supreme Sage speaks of those in the world\nWho do not conceal their light or cultivate obscurity,\nWho establish virtue and refine themselves—\nYet when they gain even a little,\nThey boast and exalt themselves.\n\nThe Five Aggregates are not yet emptied,\nThe Six Dusts remain impure—\nLike a house roofed with thatch,\nFire depends on something to burn.\n\nIf one only cultivates oneself without seeking others,\nAnd merges indistinctly into the realm of *wuheyou* [non-existence],\nThe boundless wilderness—\nEven if external harm comes,\nIt is like lighting a fire in empty space—\nIt shall surely extinguish itself.\n\nSuch cultivation of the self is true cultivation.\nOnly thus can people dwell in peaceful harmony with the Dao’s natural order,\nOtherwise, without attaining the Dao,\nThey invite blame instead.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"To have while seeming to have not,\nTo be full while seeming empty,\nTo be boundless while seeming constrained.\"*\nIt is no wonder they are despised by others.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao in this way\nCan avoid the anxieties of external concerns\nAnd escape the troubles of external harm.\n\n---\n**Chapter 42: Loss as Gain**\nThe Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to all things.\n\nAll things carry yin upon their backs and embrace yang,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* is the essence of balance.\nWhat people detest—\nThe solitary, the orphaned, the bereaved—\nThe king and duke consider them worthy of honor.\n\nThus, some things are benefited by loss,\nOthers are harmed by gain.\nWhat people revere, I also teach:\n*\"The arrogant and violent shall not meet a natural end.\"*\nI shall take this as my lesson.\n\nThe Daoist path, from beginning to end,\nHolds emptiness and nothingness as its essence.\nThe Primordial Heavenly Sovereign,\nCalled *Xuwu Ziran* [Emptiness-Naturalness],\nIs the very meaning of this.\n\nFrom emptiness comes reality—\nThis is called true reality.\nFrom nothingness comes existence—\nThis is called true existence.\n\nIf one does not embrace emptiness and nothingness,\nNot only are the Seven Emotions and Six Desires\nStifled, blocking the true spirit’s essence,\nLeaving no capacity to respond to all things and transform the yang spirit—\nEven in observing emptiness and enlightenment,\nIf one clings with even a trace of forced restraint,\nIt is but the mind controlling the mind,\nDirectly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.\n\nIn summary: emptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s substance,\nHarmonious balance is the Dao’s function.\nIf people can attain this, the Dao is nearly realized.\n\nThe Supreme Sage says, *\"The Dao gives birth to One\"*—\nWhat does the Dao possess?\nOnly emptiness.\n\nYet within ultimate emptiness,\nA breath of *qi* stirs—\nAnd thus heaven and earth are born.\nHence it is said:\n*\"There was a primal chaos, born before heaven and earth.\"*\n\nBefore the Boundless,\nIt was indistinct and formless—\nOnly this emptiness.\nWhen it moves, it becomes yang;\nWhen it stirs, it becomes yin—\nThus, *\"The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate,\nWhich gives rise to the Two Principles.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two.\"*\n\nIn the human body,\nWithin the subtle and obscure,\nA single awakening splits—\nHeaven and earth open and close,\n*Qi* flows in cycles—\nStillness and condensation form yin and essence;\nMotion and circulation form yang and *qi*.\n\nIf there is no true intention to govern them,\nThen yin and yang scatter chaotically,\nAnd there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.\nThus, between yin and yang,\nThe Primordial Spirit and true intention are vital to their balance—\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Two gives birth to Three.\"*\n\nFrom this,\nOne yin and one yang,\nOne motion and one stillness,\n*Qi* flows and transforms,\nIts mastery remains unchanged—\nAnd thus all things generate endlessly—\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nSome say:\n*\"Heaven One generates water—metal generates water;\nEarth Two generates fire—wood generates fire;\nHeaven Three generates wood—water generates wood;\nEarth Four generates metal—earth generates metal.\"*\nUsing the Five Phases’ generation to explain\nThe Supreme Sage’s meaning of *\"One, Two, Three, all things\"*\nIs overly strained—\nBetter to say the Dao is the Boundless,\nOne is the Supreme Ultimate,\nTwo is yin and yang,\nHeaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—\nThis is the clearest explanation.\n\n*\"All things carry yin upon their backs and embrace yang,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* is the essence of balance,\"*\nIllustrating that the Dao is the Primordial Emptiness-Naturalness *qi*,\nTransforming into yin and yang—\nAll things’ generation comes from yin and yang.\n\n*\"Suong\"* (harmonizing) means central—\nIf yin and yang lack this central harmony,\nThe center has no master, and the master is unsettled.\nEven things struggle to be born—\nHow much more so for cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth blend their threads,\nAll things refine their essence.\"*\nThus, the three—*jing* (essence), *qi* (breath), *shen* (spirit)—\nMust be complete,\nSo that yin and yang merge with the Supreme Ultimate and cannot be separated.\n\nIf yin and yang exist separately\nAnd the Supreme Ultimate vanishes,\nThen the creative power is lost,\nAnd the vital force of all things is extinguished.\n\nIn general, cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir\nCannot do without true yin and true yang,\nBut without the Primordial Harmonious *qi*,\nThe elixir cannot form,\nAnd the Dao cannot be fulfilled—\nFor the Dao is originally structured by this Harmonious *qi*.\n\nGenerating humans, generating immortals—\nIt is but one principle,\nThe difference lies only in obedience or defiance.\n\nThe Dao is but this Primordial *qi* as substance,\nWith yin and yang as its functions—\nThus, the Way of Alchemy is attained.\n\nObserve the kings and nobles, high in station,\nNoble in rank,\nYet they call themselves *\"gū\"* (孤, lone),\n*\"guǎ\"* (寡, few),\n*\"bùgù\"* (不榖, unfulfilled).\nWhat is their intent?\n\nFor the lofty are prone to peril,\nThe full are prone to loss—\nLike lightning beneath the sun,\nSwift thunder follows.\n\nOnly he who does not rely upon his height,\nWho does not boast of his nobility,\nBut instead dwells in humility and gentleness—\nSuch may long preserve his wealth and honor,\nAnd his kin shall not fall into ruin.\n\nThus, *\"gū\"*, *\"guǎ\"*, *\"bùgù\"*—\nWhat common folk abhor,\nAre the very titles by which kings and nobles refer to themselves.\n\nThen, if the Dao is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth,\nHow can those who cultivate it ignore the meaning of humility and gentleness?\n\n*The Shū* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss,\nHumility invites gain.\"*\n\nThis is without exception.\n\nGain does not begin with gain,\nIt must first undergo loss before gain;\nLoss does not begin with loss,\nIt must first undergo gain before loss.\n\nThus, wealth and poverty,\nIndigence and prosperity,\nGain and loss—\nWhen extremes bend, they rise;\nWhen heights rise, they must bend—\nThis is the Dao’s cyclical flow,\nNature’s immutable course.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot escape it,\nHow much less can mortals?\n\nAlas, the human Way is such—\nWhat difference is there from the Great Way?\n\nSeekers of the Dao desire a single yang to revive and renew,\nYet first must silence all attachments,\nPurely nurturing the Harmonious *qi*,\nAnd severing all restless and grasping thoughts.\n\nIf one diminishes again and again,\nTo the point of nonexistence,\nThen within the gathered darkness of all yin,\nTrue yang shall arise,\nAnd the benefit to one’s self shall be great.\n\nBut if one boasts of his talent,\nExalts his wisdom,\nThen pride shall not be far behind—\nNone have escaped the error of the discerning spirit,\nOr the flames of false fire consuming the body.\n\nTo seek gain and instead suffer loss—\nThis is the general rule of all things under Heaven,\nNot merely in the cultivation of the Dao.\n\nAs for all worldly affairs,\nThey are but illusions,\nNot worth fixation—\nYet mortals still cling to them as if they were the teachings of the next generation.\n\nKnow well: the Great Dao of Alchemy\nIs for the present moment,\nYet its consequences last through all ages—\nHow can it not be taken as law?\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) says:\n*\"What mortals teach, I also teach—*\n*Gentleness alone.\"*\n\nIf one does not employ gentleness but instead relies on rigidity,\nHe shall be like the tyrants of the world,\nWho ravage and plunder,\nYet none escape the law’s net\nAnd meet a good end.\n\nThus, the proud and fierce meet death,\nWhile gentleness and weakness are the path to life—\nThis is the very essence of Daoist cultivation.\n\nMy teaching of others\nEmphasizes gentleness and weakness first—\nSeekers of the Dao must not neglect this!\n\n*The Wùzhēn* (悟真) says:\n*\"From emptiness the Dao gives birth to one *qi*,\nFrom one *qi* it produces yin and yang.\nYin and yang thus form the three substances,\nAnd the three substances generate all things in flourishing—*\nThis is the meaning of:\n*'One generates two, two generates three, three generates all things.'*\n\nAt the outset of seated meditation,\nOne must first extinguish all emotional ties,\nSweep away all delusions,\nReach perfect emptiness and stillness,\nNo different from the dull and the foolish—\nNeither fully asleep nor fully awake,\nNeither fully asleep nor fully awake.\n\nThis is the undifferentiated *qi* of *Hóngmēng* (鸿蒙),\nThe very image of the Dao.\nSuddenly, a spark of awareness stirs,\nAnd the void is pierced by clarity.\n\nAfter this stirring,\nI perceive all phenomena as void,\nA single spirit alone in motion—\nEmbracing the Primordial, guarding the One—\nSome call it *true intention*,\nSome call it *right mindfulness*,\nSome call it *the Buddha’s perfect and equal enlightenment*.\n\nAt this moment, there is but one mind,\nNo duality of thought.\n\nWhen observing the yang’s emergence and the formation of elixir,\nIf it thrives and flourishes like the blending of threads,\nThen apply the two stages of forward practice:\nThe first stage is *taking and returning to the palace*,\nThe second stage is *returning to the furnace and sealing firmly*—\nThis is the stirring as yang, yang governing ascent;\nThe stillness as yin, yin governing descent.\n\nAgain, examine the strength of the *qi*’s movement:\nIf it is now fully robust,\nBegin the *river vehicle’s* circulation,\nThe four stages of taking and refining—\nCooking and consuming the elixir,\nDrying the self’s mercury.\n\nThis is the taking of yang to pair with yin,\nBoth arising from the One.\n\nAs for each inhalation and exhalation,\nEach opening and closing—\nNone are without the One *qi* dividing into two *qi*.\nYet the heart’s essence and kidney’s *qi*,\nThe heart’s yin and kidney’s yang—\nAll depend upon the true intention\nFor their taking, refining, union, and harmonization.\n\nThis is the yin and yang two *qi*,\nCombined with the true intention as three substances—\nAll unfolding naturally,\nWithout contrivance or manipulation.\n\nThe key lies in humility and yielding,\nThe slightest trace of self-exaltation or rigidity—\nSmall, it may topple the elixir;\nGreat, it may destroy life itself.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The rigid and fierce shall not meet their death,\nI shall take them as my teachers.\"*\n\nLearners must know:\nBefore attaining the elixir,\nRely upon the heart of emptiness and stillness;\nAfter attaining the elixir,\nNurture it with the intention of gentleness and harmony—\nBeware of excessive thought and worry,\nOf self-aggrandizement and rigidity.\n\nThis is the supreme key within the supreme key—\nLearners, take heed!\n\nOtherwise, with a heart brimming with delusion,\nWhere shall the Dao reside?\n\nSuch refining is blind refining—\nA single piece of rigidity,\nThough attained, it shall be lost;\nSuch cultivation is blind cultivation—\nWithout elixir or Dao,\nYet rushing to take and refine,\nTo circulate and transform—\nNot only is it wasted effort,\nBut it shall surely harm the emotions and deplete the essence.\n\nThe damage to body and mind is not slight,\nYet they still refuse to blame themselves,\nInstead blaming the Great Dao as false,\nThe Alchemical Elixir as untrustworthy—\nSuch are they who truly do not know the Dao as the Way!\n\nOnly in perfect emptiness and perfect gentleness,\nBy preserving the heart in stillness,\nAnd nourishing the *qi* in harmony—\nShall the Dao never fail to manifest.\n\nThis is to say:\nDaoist cultivation, healing disease, prolonging life,\nAscending to immortality, becoming a sage—\nIt depends upon nothing other than the three treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit.\n\nYet essence is not the essence of copulation,\nBut the Primordial Beginning’s true suchness,\nThe radiant singular spirit—\nAs earlier said:\n*\"Dim and vague, yet within it lies an image.\"*\n\nFrom emptiness comes generation—emptiness is the Dao.\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One\"* means emptiness generates essence; essence is nature itself.\n\nQi is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation, but rather *\"the primordial essence of the First Heaven, a single qi diffused\"*—as earlier said:\n*\"Dim and vague, yet within it lies a substance.\"*\n\nFrom One comes generation—One is essence.\n*\"One gives birth to Two\"* means essence generates qi; qi is life itself.\n\nSpirit is not the spirit of thought and deliberation, but rather the luminous radiance alone, ever-awake and unobstructed—\nas earlier said:\n*\"Fathomless and dark, yet within it lies essence,\nThat essence is most true, within it lies trust.\"*\n\nFrom Two comes transformation—Two is qi.\n*\"Two generates Three\"* means qi transforms into spirit—\nspirit is the true intent of the Primordial Spirit.\n\nAll are transformations of the Great Harmony’s singular qi.\nOnly by nurturing with gentleness and softness shall one attain it.\n\nIf one clings to impatience and a hasty heart,\nor generates a violent and tyrannical qi,\nthese are of a different kind—far from the Dao.\nPreserving the body is already difficult; how much more to aspire to immortality!\nThus there is the warning against forceful coercion.\n\nThe Most High teaches patience and compassion,\nand so speaks thus.\n\nConfucius arranged the *Yijing*, thrice emphasizing the *Qian* hexagram,\nand through figures like the tilted *Yi* vessel,\nhe demonstrated his teachings with earnestness—\nwas this not the same intent?\n\n**Chapter 43: The Benefit of Non-Action**\nThe utmost softness in the world overcomes the utmost hardness.\nThere is nothing that enters the unbroken—\nthus I know the benefit of non-action.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid, the benefit of non-action—\nfew in the world attain it.\n\nWhat is the Dao?\nIt is the primordial *qi* of Hongmeng.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth opened, this *qi* existed in the void;\nafter Heaven and Earth split, this *qi* dwelled in Heaven and Earth.\nThis *qi* existed before Heaven and Earth yet never perished,\nand endures after Heaven and Earth yet never ceases.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth obtained this *qi*, they became the Dao.\nThe Dao is Heaven and Earth—\nspeaking of Heaven and Earth, the Dao is within them.\n\nOnly Heaven and Earth could embrace this *qi*,\nthus they move endlessly without obstruction.\nThe *qi* that endures ten thousand years without decay,\nthe *qi* that flows ceaselessly, nourishing all beings—\nthis is the same *qi*, interconnected.\n\nThe Sage follows Heaven and Earth:\nwhat is sincere within becomes manifest without—\nthough inner and outer differ, the *qi* is the same;\nwhat is fully realized in oneself becomes accomplished in others—\nthough self and others differ, the *qi* is one.\n\nWhat is its nature?\nIt is emptiness alone.\n\nOne thing is connected, and all things are connected;\nemptiness is never unclear—\none thing is illuminated, and all things are illuminated.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"To govern is like the North Star in its place,\nwhile all stars naturally revolve around it.\"*\n\nMencius said:\n*\"The gentleman transforms through cultivation of spirit,\naligning above and below with the flow of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThis is truly beyond thought or time—\nthe *qi* naturally permeates, silently and steadily.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The world’s vastness comes from me, its peace from me.\nThe multitude of beings comes from me, their nurturing from me.\nThe distance of past and future comes from me, their connection from me.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s Dao is vast—\ntruly beyond comparison.\n\nConsider this:\nThe universe has no end, yet the Dao encompasses it—\nhow great is it!\nGold and jade are the most rigid, yet the Dao penetrates them—\nis it not firm?\n\nYet it is said in the *Odes*:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven, solemn and unceasing.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Heaven’s bearing, without sound or scent.\"*\nThis is the utmost softness.\n\nStill, without this *qi*, Heaven and Earth would be inert and useless;\nwithout this *qi*, beings would be dull and lifeless.\nWith it, they live; without it, they perish.\n\nThus *\"the utmost softness overcomes the utmost hardness\"*\n—because without *qi*, there would be no things.\n\nWhether vast as the Three Thousand Worlds,\nor minute as dust or hair,\nall are contained within it.\n\nNot only is it the utmost softness,\nbut also the utmost nothingness—\nis this not what Confucius called:\n*\"Visible yet unseen, heard yet unheard,\ngrasped yet intangible?\"*\n\nHow could there be separation?\nYet when things reach extreme softness, they become useless.\nOnly the Dao’s utmost softness\ncan sustain the world’s utmost hardness.\n\nWhen things reach utter nothingness, what purpose do they serve?\nOnly the Dao’s utter nothingness\ncan govern the world’s myriad existences.\n\nThis is nothing more than the undivided *qi*,\nflowing without obstruction.\n\nThus the Most High says:\n*\"I know the great benefit of non-action.\"*\n\nMoreover, Heaven and Earth act without action yet transform,\nthe Sage governs without action yet brings order—\nhow could there be a single being or thing not under its influence?\nIs this not because of the *qi*’s all-encompassing and vast reach?\n\nWithin the human body, the vast *qi* circulates naturally,\nwithout need for manipulation,\nspontaneously irrigating the entire body,\nfilling every hair—\nits benefits are indeed profound.\n\nAs for teaching,\nthe ancients relied on personal example, not words.\nThe teaching of teaching is not as true\nas twice the teaching of non-teaching.\n\nHeaven speaks not, yet the four seasons proceed;\nthe Sage speaks not, yet the world transforms.\nTo observe the Sage’s natural ease, his loose robes and composed demeanor—\nis this not the same path of non-action leading to natural perfection and self-governance?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The teaching of the unsaid, the benefit of non-action—\nfew in the world attain it.\"*\n\nAlas, how lamentable!\n\nThis describes the Dao’s natural non-action,\nencompassing Heaven and Earth,\nnurturing all beings,\nrooted in the Great Harmony’s singular *qi*,\nflowing through the cosmos,\npenetrating Heaven and humanity—\nwhether vast or minute, hidden or apparent,\nall are complete within it.\n\nThus the utmost softness nurtures the utmost hardness,\nthe utmost nothingness contains the utmost existence.\n\nHence, one connection leads to a hundred connections,\none movement sets all in motion—\nlike an echo in an empty valley,\neach sound responds in harmony.\n\nThe divine mystery of the Dao—\nnone can surpass it!\nWho but the Sage could truly align with this?\n\nIf one is but a novice,\nyet possesses true faith and great resolve,\nfollowing the Way and keeping to its path,\nprogressing from shallow to deep,\nfrom low to high,\nstarting with exertion yet eventually attaining natural ease,\nthen alone can one penetrate its essence.\n\nOne must endure with patience again and again,\nbear with forbearance again and again—\nthrough the twelve times of day,\nnever letting aversion arise,\nnever abandoning one’s resolve.\nOnly when deep understanding is gained,\ndwelling in tranquility and nurturing life,\nfinding abundance on all sides,\ndoes one suddenly grasp the intent of the Supreme Dao,\ntruly without a shred of falsehood.\n\nAs for refining the primordial foundation,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"When essence is born, there is the time to prepare the medicine;\nwhen the medicine is produced, there is the time to gather it.\"*\n\nThe primordial *qi* of the Dao gives rise to essence,\nessence gives rise to *qi*—\nthis is the principle by which Heaven and Earth generate life,\nin accordance with the Way.\nIf one follows it naturally,\nthough able to bear sons and daughters,\nessence will be consumed, *qi* will scatter,\nand life will be exhausted, ending in death.\n\nThe Supreme Dao pities mortal beings,\nwandering through birth and death,\nendlessly cycling through rebirth,\nand thus reveals the method of reverse cultivation:\nreturning to the root, restoring youth to age,\ntransforming weakness into strength,\nso that one may attain immortality and verify sainthood,\nforever free from generation and annihilation.\n\nInitially, it teaches one to cultivate emptiness and foster stillness,\nbeginning from the state of no knowledge, no awareness,\nand seeking the realm of knowledge and awareness.\nThe *Yijing* speaks:\n*\"Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and thus in harmony—*\nthis is it.\"\n\nThe essence of post-heavenly cultivation has form,\nwhile the essence of pre-heavenly cultivation leaves no trace—\nin that vague, indistinct state,\nthere is yet something within.\nThis is called *the opening of the Mysterious Pass*,\n*the foundation of the Great Ultimate*—\nfrom here, one must focus the spirit upon emptiness,\nunify the *qi* with the void,\nilluminate the mind internally,\nand observe the breath of each inhalation and exhalation,\nits opening and closing,\nits ascent and descent,\nits gathering and returning to the central palace,\nits bathing and nourishment.\n\nIn time, at the moment of profound obscurity,\nsuddenly a thought arises from the rule,\na *qi* emerges from the void—\nthis is essence giving rise to *qi*.\n\nThis *qi* is not of material form—\nif it were of material form,\nthen it would have beginnings and endings,\nfixed quantities.\nHow could it encompass Heaven and Earth,\nenter the finest hairs,\npenetrate without trace,\nshatter without resistance?\n\nThis *qi* is the very source of life for all beings—\nobtaining it brings life,\nlosing it brings death.\nThough it is the utmost softness,\nit can govern even the Sage;\nthough it is the utmost nothingness,\nit can rule all things.\nThe ancients likened it to medicine,\nfor it can cure old age and disease,\nnurture the immortal embryo.\nThus it is called *\"the Elixir of Longevity\"* and *\"the Nectar of Rebirth,\"*\nand also *\"the True Person’s Root of Immortality\"—*\ntruly the world’s greatest treasure.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"A thousand taels of gold cannot buy a single strand of this.\"*\n\nIf mortals can obtain this *qi*,\nthen eternal life is within reach.\n\nYet the method of gathering it\nmust also conform to the central and the proper,\nonly then will there be no calamity.\nIf one has the medicine but fails to blend it well,\nto brew and refine it properly,\nto take it at the right moment,\nto nourish it by the correct method,\nand if the fire’s strength—whether fierce or gentle—\nthe medicine’s balance—whether aged or fresh—\nand the dosage—whether heavy or light—\nare all mismanaged,\nthen like the inversion of yin and yang,\nor the disruption of cold and heat,\nit will occur out of season,\nbringing forth natural disasters,\nand causing all things to perish.\n\nStudents who master the Supreme Dao’s preceding chapters,\nputting forth effort with precision,\nwill never err.\n\nI reveal the function here to this single principle—\ntruly worth more than ten thousand gold.\nIf one perceives this principle clearly,\nthen there is mastery everywhere,\nthe medicine of eternal life can be obtained,\nand the realm of the immortals is without difficulty.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The More You Hoard, the More You Lose**\n\nWhich is closer to you—name or body?\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater suffering—gain or loss?\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The more you cherish, the greater the expense;\nthe more you hoard, the greater the loss.\"*\n\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nknowing restraint brings no peril—\nthis is how one endures long.\n\nThose who love name and wealth\nall believe that name can exalt their body,\nand wealth can enrich their body—\nif the body lacks name, it will be obscured and unnoticed;\nif the body lacks wealth, it will be destitute and unbearable.\n\nThus, the greedy for name\nforsake their body without hesitation;\nthe covetous of wealth\nlose their body without regret.\nThe *Guozi* says:\n*\"The avaricious man sells himself for riches,\nthe valiant man sells himself for name.\"*\n\nHuman nature is such,\nand this lament has been the same from ancient to modern times.\n\nYet consider: which is closer—name or body?\nName is external,\nbody is internal.\nPeople seek name for the sake of their body—\nwhy then, through name, do they lose their body?\nIs it that name is truly close,\nwhile the body is truly distant?\n\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nThe body is precious,\nwealth is base.\nAll seek wealth for the sake of their body—\nwhy then, through wealth, do they lose their body?\nIs it that the body is truly less,\nwhile wealth is truly more?\n\nThink deeply on this!\n\nIf one has name but loses their nature,\nor has body but lacks name,\nwhich has gained, which has lost?\n\nTo abandon the body while wealth remains empty,\nor to lose wealth while life is preserved—\nwhich endures, which perishes?\n\nFrom this perspective,\nit is better to gain the body and lose name and wealth\nthan to gain name and wealth while losing the body.\n\nMoreover, those who love name and wealth\ndamage their spirit and life,\nand their excessive love brings great expense;\nthose who hoard deeply\nemploy deceitful schemes,\ninjure their body and mind—\ntheir hoarding thus brings great loss.\n\nTo be held in high regard is to be feared by the state,\nto accumulate wealth is to be censured by Nature.\nFrom ancient times onward,\nhow many have been mighty yet met with misfortune,\nrich yet faced execution!\n\nAll because they failed to restrain themselves,\ndid not retreat and conceal,\nwere insatiable in their greed,\nthus inviting hatred from the people\nand retribution from Heaven.\n\nOnly those who know contentment and restraint\nwalk the middle path,\nremaining stable to the end.\nFree from disgrace and peril,\nthey neither falter nor topple,\nand thus long preserve their body,\nextending even to their descendants.\n\nWhen **Fan Li** thus escaped the calamity of **Goujian**,\nand **Zhang Liang** attained the leisure of **Chisong’s** wanderings—\ntruly, they were men who grasped the subtle Dao!\n\nLater seekers shall take heed of this sage teaching.\nHere, **contentment and restraint** are likened to **stopping the fire to nurture the elixir**,\nwith **reputation** as **light** and **wealth** as **medicine**.\n\nThose who covet illusory splendor are often ensnared by demons,\nthose who labor to transport riches rarely escape misfortune and blame.\n\nBefore the medicine returns to the furnace,\none must **stir the fire** to refine it;\nonce the medicine enters the cauldron,\none must **halt the fire** to preserve it.\n\nIf the fire burns **excessively** and one fails to stop it,\nnot only will the elixir be ruined and the cauldron overturned,\nbut one will invite sickness and disaster—\neven death by flames, and great peril.\n\nAnd yet, the **Great Dao** is empty and boundless,\nwith no place for grand distinctions among men.\nSome indulge in fine wine and delicacies,\nin beauty and adornment,\nin gold and jade, pearls and gems,\nin pavilions and palaces.\n\nOthers face **heavenly demons**, **earthly demons**,\n**ghostly demons**, and **spiritual demons**,\nall manner of trials that test the **Way**—\nsome boast of becoming **immortals**,\nothers claim to be **true persons**,\nproudly asserting they have ascended to the **Celestial Hall of Precious Treasures**—\nyet in a single distracted thought,\ntheir **spirit and life** are shattered,\nand many who pursue the **Great Dao** fail to achieve it.\n\nAgain, some revere the **manifestation of the Spirit**,\nand **San Shi** become their scourge—\nthey believe there is a body beyond the body,\nand in an instant, their **golden elixir**, their greatest treasure,\nis stolen and destroyed.\n\nSuch cases, and countless others,\nall stem from **unrestrained fire**—\nthe elixir **reverts** when the fire is not halted,\nthe **refinement** fails when the **nurturing** is neglected—\nthus, their **intentions scatter** while their **spirit perishes**,\ntheir **external pursuits disrupt** their **inner essence**.\n\nFor those who cultivate the **Way**,\nillusions of **reputation**, **form**, **light**, and **appearance**—\nall must be **dismissed with a single stroke**,\nheld with no attachment whatsoever.\nIf one thus **knows restraint** and **contentment**,\nconstantly **nurturing the numinous elixir**,\nthen one attains **the utmost excellence**,\nand **never falters or declines**.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: The Great Fulfilled as if Deficient**\nThe great fulfilled appears as if deficient,\nyet its efficacy is **unexhausted**.\nThe great abundant seems as if void,\nyet its efficacy is **unending**.\nThe great upright bends like a bow,\nthe great skilled feigns clumsiness,\nthe great eloquent speaks softly.\n\n**Calmness** overcomes **coldness**,\n**stillness** surpasses **heat**,\nand **serene clarity** is the **true norm** for the world.\n\nThe **Dao** is naturally empty and boundless,\nmoving with the **Heavenly order**,\nfollowing **nature’s inclination**,\nharmonizing with **Heaven and Earth’s** transformation,\nrising and setting with the **sun and moon**—\nhaving nothing yet encompassing all,\ndoing nothing yet accomplishing all.\n\nWhen the **Great Dao** is not yet complete or full,\nthere are still **traces of action**,\nsome **form and image** may be glimpsed,\nand one feels **self-satisfied and content**,\noverwhelmed with delight—\nuntil, upon its **great completion**,\nit seems as if **deficiencies multiply**,\nthe **greatly fulfilled** appearing as if **unfulfilled**.\n\nIn the **great abundance’s** wake,\nit seems **vast and formless**,\nthe **greatly full** appearing as if **unfull**.\n\nIs this not **the more one studies, the worse one fares**,\nor **the more one excels, the more one is censured**?\nNo.\n\nThe **Dao** is the innate perfection of all beings,\npure and empty, still and unmarked—\nwhen **form and spirit** are both wondrously refined,\nand one’s **self** merges with **True Reality**,\nthen **self and Dao** are one—\nwhat **fulfillment** or **abundance** remains?\n\nIf **fulfillment** and **abundance** persist,\nthey are still **dual with the Dao**,\nnot yet reaching the **domain of divine transformation**.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the **Way**\n**grow in having yet become without**,\n**increase yet decrease**,\nnever perceiving **fulfillment** or **abundance**.\n\nHence, the **greatly fulfilled** appears as if **deficient**,\nand the **greatly abundant** as if **void**.\n\nTherefore, all phenomena are **emptied**,\nwhile **True Reality** stands alone.\n\n**Taking things as conditions**,\n**responding to time naturally**—\ntruly, it **penetrates Heaven and Earth**,\n**spans ancient and modern**,\nand **applies universally**.\n\nHow could its efficacy ever be **exhausted**?\nHow could its efficacy ever **cease**?\n\nWhen the mind is empty as the sea,\nthe spirit still as a mountain,\nyet one feels utterly useless—\nthen suddenly the vast *qi* stretches forth,\nmost rigid, most great—\nhow could it be so straight?\nYet in return, one feels the unbearable strain of constraint.\n\nIts marvels are boundless—\nhow could they be so skillful?\nYet one only feels the stupidity of ignorance.\n\nWords are plain, yet their meaning profound;\nspeech is concise, yet its logic subtle.\nSpeaking only when necessary,\nuttering only when the time is right—\nhow could eloquence be so vast?\nYet one only feels stammering,\nas if unable to speak at all.\n\nBecause of this—\nthis bending, this clumsiness, this stammering—\nthe heart aligns with emptiness,\nthe will aligns with humility,\nvirtue aligns with breadth,\nand deeds grow ever more exalted.\n\nThis is truly the Dao’s return to voidness,\nlearning’s return to spontaneity.\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth’s turning,\nunaware of the sun and moon’s passage—\nthus its greatness endures.\n\nIf one follows the *Taiji*’s principle,\naligns with the constant of yin and yang,\nand endures prolonged cultivation—\nwhen lead and fire are fully charged,\nwithstanding nine colds without faltering;\nwhen the elixir is refined and settled,\nforgotten after three cycles—\nis this not what the *Taishang* meant by:\n*\"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat\"*?\n\nWhen clarity and purity reside within,\nvoid yet luminous, unencumbered—\nreturning to the boundless heaven,\nembracing the harmonious symbol—\nwhat agitation, what cold, what stillness, what heat remains?\n\nThe scholar, possessing a serene and tranquil mind,\ntransforming the seasons of cold and heat,\nconcentrates the body’s true *qi*—\nthus the true Dao of the world stands firm.\nWhat fear is there of errant paths emerging?\n\nThis is the ultimate plainness, the ultimate commonality,\nthe ultimate emptiness, the ultimate nothingness.\nBefore one attains the realm of voidness and commonality,\none only perceives fullness, not deficiency;\nonly perceives advantage, not disadvantage.\nThus the *Taishang* said:\n*\"The less one has, the more one gains.\nThe more one has, the more confused one becomes.\"*\nThe proverb states:\n*\"A great bell makes no sound,\na full jar makes no echo.\"*\nTruly not false.\n\nThe great virtue is non-virtue—\nthus it has virtue.\nGreat action is non-action—\nthus it has action.\nNot empty words.\n\nThe Dao originates as voidness, one *qi*.\nBecause of its attainment,\nit is without attainment;\nbecause of its lack of attainment,\nit is true attainment.\nThus, the higher the Dao,\nthe lower the heart;\nthe greater the virtue,\nthe more humble the will—\nthis aligns perfectly with the Dao.\n\nIf one has any excess,\none boasts arrogantly, swells with pride,\ndespises others, domineers—\nits lack of Dao and virtue is then evident.\n\nThus the *Taishang* said:\n*\"In learning, one gains daily;\nin the Dao, one loses daily—\nlose again, lose again,\nuntil reaching nothingness\"—\nonly then is attainment achieved.\n\nThe scholar must not view cultivating the Dao or refining the elixir\nlike the crafts of a hundred artisans,\ndeeming progress as personal gain.\nIf cultivation centers on voidness as its essence,\nand reaches the stage of forgetting—\nthis is progress.\nWhen forgetting is forgotten,\none has entered the realm of transformation.\n\nFor the Dao-seeker,\nretreat is advancement,\nweakness is strength.\nEmpty becomes full,\nnothing becomes something,\nreverse becomes upright,\nsubtraction becomes addition.\nThus, the scholar’s progress or stagnation\ndepends solely on whether the heart forgets or not.\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\n\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nwarhorses are driven out to manure fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo crime is greater than desire,\nno calamity greater than discontent.\nNo fault is greater than greed.\n\nThus, contentment is true contentment.\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nrulers and people alike are at ease.\nConquest is unnecessary,\nso horses are released to the forests,\nfields are plowed and tilled,\nmerely to fertilize the land.\n\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nchaos has already taken root.\nSome act out of necessity,\nbandits rise in succession,\nweapons clash without cease—\nhow could warhorses not be bred\nto meet the state’s demands?\n\nThus, the horses’ retreat is because of the Dao,\ntheir proliferation is because of its absence,\nand their fate is tied to the world’s great affairs.\n\nAlas!\nHow could we have rulers who rule,\nministers who minister,\nfathers who father,\nsons who son,\nupholding benevolence, discussing righteousness,\nreviving poetry, explaining ritual—\na time when the capital embodies the Dao?\n\nYet prolonged peace and indulgence\nbreed desires and greed.\nHaving this, lacking that,\nexotic arts and licentious crafts\nare arrayed before them.\nFine clothes and delicious food are insufficient—\nthey then covet palatial chambers.\nA thousand-li domain is still too narrow—\nthey then lust after ten-thousand-li fiefs.\n\nAlas!\nWithin, they indulge in moral decay;\nwithout, they indulge in bestiality.\nAdding to this, they prioritize profit and swift results,\nexhaust resources through warfare,\ndemand excessively, crave endlessly—\ninternal and external chaos ensues.\nWhat awaits but ruin?\n\nAll this stems from a single desire’s origin.\nWhen desire arises, greed follows;\nwhen greed arises, the unobtained is sought;\nwhen obtained, fear of loss takes hold.\n\nIf this continues,\nmoral order will not collapse,\ncalamities will not arise,\nthe state will not fall,\nthe world will not perish—\nthis will never occur.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"No crime is greater than desire.\"*\nIf desire did not exist,\nhow could greed arise?\nIf greed does not arise,\nthen the winds of superficial harmony, superficial completeness, superficial beauty\nwould not be difficult to restore.\n\nAnd it is said:\n*\"No calamity is greater than discontent.\"*\nIf one’s desire does not arise,\nthis will is always satisfied,\nthis heart always at ease—\nneither seeking from the world\nnor harming others.\nWhen success comes, one accepts it;\nwhen failure comes, one accepts it—\nwhere would calamity originate?\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"No fault is greater than greed.\"*\nIf one knows contentment,\none naturally guards one’s portion,\naccepts one’s fate,\nfollows the seasons,\nlistens to Heaven—\nwithout flattery, without arrogance,\nwithout contention, without seizure—\nwalking the straightforward path,\nlong basking in the great harmony—\nwhat fault remains?\n\nWhen much more, the true heart shines within, the true nature solidifies within.\nCultivate oneself in stillness,\never finding joy within.\nAct in one’s natural station,\nwithout conforming to the external.\n\nThus, those who naturally hold the world\nalways preserve their world;\nthose who hold a state\nalways preserve their state;\nthose who hold life\nalways preserve their life.\n\nWhat they fear is that once desire arises,\nit cannot be pruned away,\nultimately leading to extreme extravagance and insatiable craving—\nand no remedy exists.\n\nIs there a Dao to seek the world and obtain it?\nFrom ancient times, gain and loss hinge on a single thought.\nA thought once turned astray\nbecomes a great calamity.\nThis is how reckless desire brings about boundless ruin.\n\nLife and death depend on the slenderest thread.\nIf that thread is preserved,\ngreat plans will surely unfold.\nThis is how mastering the thought\ncreates boundless blessings.\n\nThus, one knows that desire, though initially slight,\ngrows vast in the end—\nhow can one not be cautious?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Know contentment, know contentment is always contentment.\"*\nThose who do not know contentment\nseek more and lose more,\nand in losing, seek even more.\nThus they exhaust their strength and weary their spirit,\ntoiling endlessly—\nwhat benefit is there?\n\nDo they not know that prosperity and adversity,\ngain and loss,\nare governed by Heaven,\nnot by human effort?\n\nWhy toil ceaselessly and grow ever more incompetent,\nwhen rest and ease would be the wiser choice?\n\nIf one knows contentment,\nthey follow nature effortlessly,\nact without striving—\nwhat need for worry or concern?\nWithout schemes or grasping,\nwhere could they go without thriving?\n\nLet people take heed!\n\nThis likens the world to the human body and the horse to the alchemical use of fire to refine elixirs. If a person is in accord with the Dao, their vital essence is full and their qi abundant—why then refine elixirs? To follow and preserve this naturally is sufficient.\n\nIf one lacks the Dao, however, their essence wanes and their qi scatters, forcing them to rely on the primal spirit and true breath to cultivate body and mind. Yet at the outset of practice, they must first nourish the external fields, hence the saying: *\"Warhorses are born in the wilderness.\"* Only when yang vitality arises and medicinal herbs flourish may they proceed with the alchemical methods of advancing fire and withdrawing talismans, the tactics of field battles and fortress defense—until all impurities are purged and pure radiance emerges, as when the world is at peace and the state at ease, and the horses are returned to Hua Mountain, hence the saying: *\"Drive the horses back to manure.\"* Yet the chaos of the world and the peril to one’s self all stem from a single thought of desire. If unchecked, it festers unseen, until essence and marrow are exhausted, and life itself cannot be preserved—how tragic is this?\n\nWhen desire arises in mortals, they must seek its fulfillment to find satisfaction. Even if all wishes are granted, the abyss of desire is unfathomable, greed insatiable—coveting the next hill after gaining one, endlessly turning without rest. Those who possess the world lose it, and those who possess life—how could they not lose both?\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Without schemes or grasping, where could they go without thriving?\"*\nOnly those who know contentment may dwell in tranquility, ever abiding in the Dao’s realm. No need for meritous deeds to mend deficiencies—only follow nature, and merge with Heaven.\n\nThe *Tao Te Ching* warns: *\"No fault is greater than the desire for desire\"*—these words teach one to cut off encroaching desires at their root, to guard against subtle transgressions, and to discipline the craft of covetousness, just as Confucius spoke of *\"caution in solitude\"* and the Buddha taught *\"right awareness.\"* All are one in the Dao.\n\nHave scholars ever glimpsed this truth?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\n*\"What is not wrought is perfected.\"*\n\nThe Way lies unseen within the home—\nyet one may know the world.\nNo need to peer through windows—\nyet one may perceive the Dao.\n\nThe farther one roams,\nthe less one knows.\nThus the Sage acts without striving yet knows,\nsees without gazing yet names,\ndoes without doing yet achieves.\n\nThe virtuous one possesses all things within,\nyet refines the self without stepping beyond the courtyard.\nYet the shifts of the world’s order,\nthe changes of human hearts,\nand the principles of preserving life while averting ruin,\nof reversing chaos into harmony—\nall are clearly understood within the mind’s breadth.\n\nIs this mere craft or calculation?\nTruly, all things share the same source—\nto exhaust the logic of one’s self\nis to grasp the logic of all under Heaven.\nThus, without leaving home, one knows the world.\n\nAncients shaped creation through the mind—\nno need to conceal light behind windows—\nyet the silent Emperor’s mandate,\nthe unceasing decree of Heaven,\nand the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation,\nof yin and yang’s creative work—\nall are fully illuminated within the heart.\n\nIs this mere conjecture?\nIt is because Heaven and humanity are one continuum—\nto cultivate one’s own life\nis to align with the Emperor’s decree.\nThus, without gazing through windows, one sees the Dao.\n\nIf one wanders abroad, inquiring into the world’s affairs,\nor consorts with wise friends, probing the subtleties of Heaven’s will—\none may gain some knowledge.\nBut if one seeks it not within but without,\nnot in the self but in externals,\neven what is learned will be less than what lies near.\n\nThe Way is plain before one’s very door—\nwhy abandon the near for the distant?\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech,\nand guarding brevity while applying broadly is the good Way.\"*\nBy this reasoning, learning grows ever nearer yet farther,\never more concise yet expansive.\nHow can the near and the concise be neglected?\n\nThus the Sage embraces unity to encompass the three,\nobserves emptiness to cultivate stillness,\nnever stepping beyond the door or hut,\nnever treading the dusty markets,\ndwelling among trees and stones,\nroaming with deer and swine,\nmoving not a step,\nconsorting with no one—\nseemingly lonely and secluded.\nYet when the spirit is steadied, wisdom arises—\nthough not walking, one surpasses those who do;\nthough lacking knowledge, one surpasses those who know.\n\nCommon folk take what they see as their aim,\nbut the Sage does not seek what is seen—\nthus, all day long, in the unseen and unheard,\none rests from thought and discards artifice;\nin what is unseen and unmanifest,\none guards against deceit and covetousness.\n\nWith only inner knowing,\nand no outward perception—\nseemingly obscure and void—\nyet the boundless gives rise to life.\nThough unseen, it is ever more manifest;\nthough unnamed, it is ever more established.\n\nAs for the myriad beings of the world,\nthe mysteries of hidden spirits and ghosts—\nall are wrought by this Way of non-action.\n\nWith order and essentials,\nbeginning and ending are fulfilled.\nWhat is feared is being ensnared by perception,\nfixated on names and forms,\nboasting of achievements,\nand clinging to opinions—\nthus the mind is scattered, unable to unite in virtue,\nthe heart is mixed, not like the Great Void.\nHence the Way fails to manifest, and virtue does not transform.\n\nNo wonder one exhausts a lifetime’s spirit\nyet gains nothing.\n\nIf applied to governing the world,\none cannot follow principle to perfection—\nwithout action, yet all under Heaven aligns of its own accord.\nIf applied to cultivating the self,\none cannot refine the void and merge with the Way—\nwithout action, yet the self attains true perfection.\nWhat use is mere external seeking?\n\nThus the virtuous one must be cautious in solitude,\nfor the essence of humanity and the origin of Heaven’s decree\nare known without seeking.\n\nThis speaks of the Way’s foundation in non-action,\nand its key in caution in solitude—\nthus, without action, there is no failure to act;\nwithout knowing, there is no failure to know.\n\nYet this is not the lifeless non-action of withered wood and ash.\nEarlier, I spoke of *\"all phenomena emptied, one spirit alone illuminated\"*—\nthis is the true meaning.\nAgain, *\"one awareness moves, one yang arises\"*—\nthis is the primal qi.\n\nGathering herbs or refining elixirs\nis but the cultivation of these two—nature and life.\nWithout true meaning, where would nature depend?\nWithout true qi, how could life be refined?\nTo gather true meaning with true qi,\nwhen the two merge into one,\nit returns to the origin of the Great Polarity—\nthis is called the Elixir.\n\nThus, within non-action, there must also be action;\nwithin non-knowing, there must also be knowing and awareness—\nonly then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.\nWhen practice deepens, emptiness becomes form,\nand form becomes emptiness.\nIn time, both are forgotten,\nand all things merge in harmony—\nthus one attains perfect alignment with the Dao.\n\nIf one does not know the Way of humanity,\none may still perceive the Way of Heaven.\nConfucius said:\n*\"Heaven speaks not—\nthe four seasons proceed, and all things are born.\"*\nThis is the essence of non-action.\n\nNon-action is Heaven’s nature,\naction is Heaven’s decree;\nnon-knowing is the original spirit,\nawareness is the original qi.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nwithout the two, there is no transformation;\nwithout the one, there is no mystery.\nMysterious yet not mysterious,\nnot mysterious yet mysterious—\nthus one attains the marvel of unity within duality,\nof mystery within transformation.\n\nThis cannot be fully expressed in words.\nIt lies with you, the cultivator—\nnurture the void and the still,\nconstantly guard the empty and the luminous,\nand thus nature and life will endure,\nwhile the Great Way may be fulfilled.\n\nDo not confuse non-action with action,\nnor cling to one side—\nthough it be the true path,\ndivergent roads will open.\nConsider this well.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nTo practice the Way is to daily diminish,\nto study is to daily increase.\nTo practice the Way is to daily diminish—\ndiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nIn non-action, there is no failure to act.\n\nThus, those who take the world\nmust act with non-interference.\nWhen interference arises,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n\nScholars memorize words and chapters,\nand artisans seek teachers and friends,\ngathering much knowledge and hearing much—\nonly then do talent and wisdom emerge,\nand skill and cleverness arise.\n\nThe wider one’s knowledge and the more one acts,\nonly then can one wield the brush to compose with ease,\nor swing the axe to shape with mastery.\nThus it is said: *\"To study the Way is to daily increase.\"*\n\nBut to practice the Dao is the opposite.\nIf one engages in extensive reading and broad familiarity with ancient texts,\nyet fails to turn inward and reflect,\nto guard the heart with singular focus—\nthen though one gathers knowledge and multiplies insights,\nthe mind will scatter and the spirit will falter.\nThough learning grows, the Dao recedes,\nuntil at last one is lost in the boundless *Tai Ji*,\ndrowned without trace.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao must strip away like peeling a banana leaf,\ndraw out like unraveling silk—\nthe more one strips, the less remains;\nthe more one draws, the more empty it becomes,\nuntil one reaches the realm of *wu-wu* (non-nonbeing).\nOnly then has one attained it.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage,\nnaturally one’s mysteries are unfathomable,\none’s transformations boundless:\nWhen gathered, there is presence;\nwhen dispersed, there is absence.\nDesire one thing, and it is one;\ndesire ten thousand, and it is ten thousand.\nThe sun, moon, and stars revolve at my command;\nthe winds, clouds, thunder, and rain obey my designs.\n\nWhat is its grandeur?\nYet scholars, grasping one principle while discarding another,\nlike eating sugarcane—\neating it all, then casting it aside,\nstill return to nothingness.\nThus it is said: *\"To practice the Dao is to daily diminish,\ndiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\"*\nIn non-action, there is no failure to act.\n\nObserve those who seek to take the world—\nthey must not hesitate to raise armies and mobilize troops,\nto brandish weapons and clash steel.\nHow can there be *wu-shì* (non-affairs)?\nYet within the chaos of affairs,\none must return to *wu-shì*,\nonly then can one unite heart and virtue,\nand devise strategies in seclusion.\nThen the mind will not scatter,\nand wise counsel will emerge.\n\nThus, commanders issue strict orders:\nears hear nothing external,\neyes see nothing external,\nthe heart wanders not to external schemes—\nonly then can one adapt to circumstances,\nand take the world as easily as turning the palm.\nOtherwise, in endless agitation,\nthe more affairs, the more disordered the mind;\nthe more disordered the mind, the more dimmed the spirit.\nBefore the enemy even arrives, one cannot remain composed,\nand at the first clash of arms, the ranks dissolve in chaos.\nTo hope for victory in such a battle—\nhow difficult is it not to be?\n\nWhat of when the eastern barbarians are not yet pacified,\nand the western nomads rise anew—\none crisis not yet resolved, another erupts—\nif one does not master stillness to govern movement,\nor ease to await exhaustion,\nfew escape defeat and ruin.\nIn antiquity, those who fled in defeat,\nwhose cities fell in ruin,\nall succumbed to the perils of *you-shì* (affairs).\n\nThus, military strategy employs tactics of deception and ambush.\nWhen the enemy sees banners filling the horizon,\ntrees trembling like soldiers,\neven facing a great foe, they are struck with dread,\nand few dare not flee at first sight of the wind’s warning.\n\nOnly by treating affairs as if they were nonexistent,\nabandoning all entanglements,\nand focusing the heart inward—\nlike Zhuge Liang amid a million troops,\nhis hair unbound, fan in hand, effortlessly composed—\ncould he secure the survival of Shu,\nand prolong the Han dynasty in its hour of peril.\nBut if one’s heart is entangled in affairs,\nthen the mind is already disordered,\nthe spirit masterless—\nlike Xu Shu, who could no longer offer counsel\nwhen his mother returned to Cao Cao,\nand thus failed to aid the First Emperor in restoring the realm.\nHow could such a one ever take the world?\n\nThis speaks to those who cultivate the Dao:\nif they see only increase, not diminution,\nthen their mind grows dim and the Dao fails to coalesce.\nThus it is said: *\"Virtue is singular;\ntwo or three, and it grows dim.\"*\nOnly by refining and forgetting in turn,\nforgetting and refining in turn,\ndoes one not become an obstacle to the Dao.\nIf memory clings without release,\nchattering endlessly—\nthis is indeed the Dao’s greatest concern.\nThus, one must gradually dissolve and extinguish\nuntil there is nothing left at all.\nOnly then is nature fully realized.\n\nThen, from nonbeing arises being,\nand one can move unseen among spirits,\ntransformations beyond measure.\nThe scriptures say that *\"the world\"* symbolizes the Dao,\n*\"taking the world\"* symbolizes cultivating the Dao,\n*\"affairs and non-affairs\"* symbolize *you-wu* (action and non-action).\nIf one can remain pure and non-acting,\none is purely *xiantiān* (primordial) *qi*—\nhow difficult is it then to attain the Dao?\nThis is the essence of taking the world.\n\nBut if one clings to forced action,\nit is all *hou-tian* (later-heaven) contrivance,\nand one falls into a side path.\nThis is the opposite of taking the world.\n\nSome may ask: *\"How can alchemy and elixirs be non-action?\"*\nKnow this: one follows the ascent as it ascends,\nnot forcing it to rise;\none follows the descent as it descends,\nnot forcing it to fall.\nEven if gathering is endless,\nand refining methods are manifold—\nit is all pure spontaneity,\nwithout a trace of contrivance.\nThough there is action, it remains *wu-wéi* (non-action).\n\nThose who merely swallow saliva and breathe *qi*\ncan never obtain the elixir or attain the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\n**The Sage Has No Fixed Heart**\n\nThe sage has no fixed heart,\nbut takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous;\nto the wicked, I am also virtuous—\nthus virtue is complete.\nTo the trustworthy, I trust them;\nto the untrustworthy, I also trust them—\nthus virtue is sincere.\n\nThe sage dwells in the world,\nblending his heart with the people’s.\nAll eyes and ears are fixed upon him,\nyet the sage treats them like children.\n\nThe sage’s heart is empty, hollow, clear, and luminous—\nnothing is excluded from its perception,\nyet nothing is obscured within it—\nlike a still mirror reflecting the moon,\nits radiance shooting in all directions.\nIt responds to each thing as it is,\nwithout preconceived intent—\nhow vast is its clarity!\nIt encompasses the great without exclusion,\nembraces the small without omission—\nbeauty and ugliness, good and evil,\nnone escape its grasp—\nhow boundless is its capacity!\n\nYet what is this heart?\nIt neither forces nor resists nature—\nthus it is said: *\"The sage has no fixed heart.\"*\nMeaning the sage does not anticipate before arrival,\nnor clings when it has passed—\nonly now is present, without attachment.\nIt is nothing but adapting to circumstances,\nresponding to each moment,\ntaking the hearts of the people as his own.\n\nAnd what is the people’s heart?\nOnly to love the good and hate the evil.\n\nThus the sage treats the people’s goodness with encouragement and praise,\nand the people’s unvirtuousness without failing to guide and lead them toward the good.\nBoth goodness and unvirtuousness, the sage encompasses with boundless virtue/power.\nThe good are moved with joy and devotion, ever more striving to be virtuous;\nthe unvirtuous awaken with resolve, transforming their ways to follow the good.\nThis is **\"virtue/power of goodness\"**—\nwhen the ruler cherishes goodness, none dare fail to comply.\nThe workings of response and transformation are such,\nand none can escape their natural unfolding.\n\nThe sage also treats the people’s faithfulness with reverence and elevation,\nand the people’s disbelief without failing to love and admire them.\nBoth faith and doubt, the sage unites with sincere, undivided embrace.\nThe faithful find peace and clarity, deepening their trust;\nthe doubters rise with vigor, abandoning disbelief to embrace faith.\nThis is **\"virtue/power of sincerity\"**—\nwhen the ruler cherishes sincerity, none dare act without genuine feeling.\nThe principle of giving and receiving is so profound,\nthat none can doubt its divine effect.\nThe people’s virtue returns to its natural simplicity—\nwhy should there be any hesitation?\n\nSince all share the same heart,\nand all hearts follow the same principle,\nthe sage views all hearts with one mind,\nand aligns all principles with one truth.\nThough the world be vast, he contains it with sincerity;\nthough the people be numerous, he unites them with righteousness.\nEven among the wise and deceitful, the loyal and false,\nall are treated with equal fairness—\ngreatly impartial, without self.\nWith open sincerity and public fairness,\nhe places his heart in theirs,\nblending all under heaven into one principle—\nthe people daily advance in goodness without knowing it.\nThe marvel of his transformative influence\nis far beyond the later ages’ exhortations to filial piety and loyalty,\nor teachings of propriety and righteousness.\n\nThus it is said: *\"He blends the hearts of all under heaven with simplicity.\"*\nHe sees all under heaven as one family,\nunites the realm as one person—\nhis benevolence and compassion embrace all,\nas one with the people in this way.\nThus the people submit to his virtue/power and cherish his benevolence,\nloving him as their parents,\nrevering him as gods,\nlooking up to him like teachers and guardians.\nWhatever they hear or see,\nthey always measure it against the sage’s words and bearing—\nnone know anything beyond this.\nHence it is said: *\"The people fix their ears and eyes upon the sage.\"*\n\nThe people’s expectation of the sage is such—\nyet what other way does the sage have?\nOnly to govern the multitude with gentleness,\nto lead the people with compassion—\nlike parents to their children:\nwhether wise or foolish, clever or dull,\nhis love is the same;\nhe lifts them up and protects them,\nguiding them with sincerity.\nIf the world has any who cannot be transformed,\nsuch do not exist.\nThis is the governance of *wuwei*—\nhow distant it is from those who rely on words and laws!\n\nIn the scriptures, **\"the sage\"** is a metaphor for the heart,\n**\"all under heaven\"** for the body.\nThe sage’s cultivation of the self\nis nothing but nurturing the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi.\nYet since humans have fundamental spirit, they also have ordinary spirit;\nsince they have fundamental qi, they also have ordinary qi.\nAt the outset of practice,\nhow could one not summon other thoughts,\nor fail to stir ordinary breath?\nOnly those who understand the Dao and cultivate it for long\nwill see the fundamental spirit arise.\nIf I treat it with an even mind,\neven if other thoughts remain unbanished,\nI still treat it with an even mind.\nIf the fundamental spirit has any who cannot see it,\nsuch do not exist.\nOnce the fundamental spirit is born,\ncultivation of the Dao has a foundation—\none must then quietly guard the elixir field,\nand regulate and nourish the fundamental qi.\nIf, at this time, the fundamental qi moves on its own,\nI must treat it with harmonious qi—\neven if ordinary qi has not yet ceased,\nI must still treat it with harmonious qi.\nIf the fundamental qi has any who cannot make it arise,\nsuch do not exist.\n\nOne must know:\nthe fundamental spirit is obscured by ordinary spirit,\nlike a bright mirror long sealed by dust—\nif not quickly polished and washed,\nhow could it suddenly become clear?\nThe fundamental qi is drowned by ordinary qi,\nlike white silk stained by oil—\nif not well cleansed and rinsed,\nhow could it return to its original state?\n\nAt this point, if one generates a single restless thought,\nor stirs a single harmful intention,\nit is as if seeking the fundamental spirit as one’s true self,\nwhile the ordinary spirit only grows stronger.\nTo seek to see one’s true nature—\nis this not difficult?\nTo seek to restore one’s fundamental qi—\nis this not a great challenge?\n\nOnly the sage’s governance of all under heaven\ndoes not distinguish between goodness and evil, sincerity or falsehood—\nhe treats all with a heart of benevolence and loyal simplicity:\nthe good he treats as good,\nthe unvirtuous he also treats as good;\nthe faithful he treats as faithful,\nthe unbelieving he also treats as faithful.\nA sphere of pristine simplicity,\nblended in his embrace.\nThis is emptiness—\nthis is the Dao.\nEmptiness naturally gives rise to spirit,\nthe Dao naturally gives rise to qi.\nThere is nothing that does not come naturally in response.\n\nOtherwise,\nif the heart is not emptied,\nthere is no Dao from the start—\nand if one seeks to conquer the spirit’s obscurity,\nor make the Dao’s qi endure,\nhow could this be attained?\n\nThe cultivation of the self and governance of the world\nshare the same Dao,\nand the principles are one without division—\nto know how to govern the world is to know how to cultivate the self,\nto understand external causes is to understand internal principles.\nThus, to illustrate this principle,\nits teaching to the learner is most profound and intimate.\n\nThe student must diligently guard the true constant,\nand skillfully nourish the emptiness—\nthen the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi\nwill naturally return to their original state.\nIf one generates even a single extraneous thought,\nor stirs a single extraneous breath,\none may fear that without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained,\nand the more one cultivates, the further the Dao recedes.\nLet the student be cautious and warned!\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Profound Nurturing of Generation**\nBirth and death.\nThose who cultivate birth alone number thirteen;\nthose who cultivate death alone number thirteen;\nthose who cultivate life—\nmoving toward death—also number thirteen.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the profound nurturing of *generation*.\n\n「For those who skillfully govern life,\nwalking upon land they meet no rhinoceros or tiger,\nentering battle they are not struck by armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to lodge its horn,\nthe tiger finds no opportunity to strike with its claws,\nand weapons find no opening for their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they dwell in the realm of no death.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth in generating beings,\nthough countless transformations and changes occur,\nwithout end or limit,\nyet their Way does not exceed\nthe interplay of yin and yang—\nswelling and waning, advance and retreat,\npreservation and annihilation.\nBetween these lies nothing beyond\nthe flow of *Taiji*'s principle and qi.\nLife and death are but day and night.\nDay and night cycle endlessly,\ntheir motion ceaseless,\njust as life and death cycle,\nendlessly alternating without cessation.\nYet within this bending and extending,\nthis coming and going,\nthe fundamental nature remains\na duality of opposing forces,\nwith no deviation.\n\nSpeaking of those who traverse birth and death,\nten out of thirteen meet yang-qi and live,\nand ten out of thirteen encounter yin-qi and die.\nThose who do not conform to Heaven and Earth’s constant yin-yang,\nwho gain yang and live yet remain like others—\nafter birth, their knowledge unfolds and desires arise,\nsenses are stirred by material cravings and actions multiply,\nthus they exhaust their vital essence and deplete their spirit,\nshortening their lifespan and forfeiting their fate—\nthese are the ones who move toward death’s domain,\nalso ten out of thirteen.\nThus the number of those who live\ndoes not surpass those who die;\nthe power of yin\nexceeds that of yang.\n\nThe principle and qi of *generation* and *transformation*,\ndo they not fear exhaustion?\nYet the origin of *Taiji* is\nsoundless and odorless—\nwhen it moves, yang is born;\nwhen it stirs, yin emerges.\nIt manifests as the Five Phases,\nscatters as myriad things,\nexhausting all oddities and variations,\nbeyond speech or name,\nyet never lacking.\nThus, when one follows its course,\nlife flows endlessly;\nwhen one opposes it,\nall returns to the root.\n\nWhen life is extinguished, death takes its place;\nwhen death is still, life stirs anew—\nthis is the Way of *generation* and *transformation*,\nthe virtue of utmost sincerity in the numinous,\nembedded within it,\nfrom the beginning of all things to this day,\nunchanged.\n\nIf not so,\nall things would have life but no death,\nand the teeming multitude would fill the cosmos,\nleaving no room for Heaven and Earth,\nnor the means to nurture life.\nThis is why the waxing and waning,\nthe swelling and emptying,\nserve to uphold the principle of life.\n\nIf one knows the profound nurturing of Heaven and Earth’s *generation*,\nit lies in this waxing and waning, swelling and emptying.\nThus, one observes the Way of Heaven,\nfollows Heaven’s course—\nwithin the killing mechanism, they seek the life-giving,\nand from death’s grasp, they draw vital qi.\nThey embody the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter,\nand contain the functions of growth, flourishing, gathering, and storing.\n\nBy guarding in harmony yet acting in opposition,\nHeaven and Earth nurture and transform all beings,\nand thus maintain their eternal, unobstructed state;\nthe human body returns to its origin,\nto become a sage of extraordinary virtue,\neternal and unchanging—\nall this arises from the same source.\nThis is not the task of the feeble!\n\nOnly those who excel in governing life\nemploy the inverted methods of yin and yang,\nthe counteracting ways of *generation* and *transformation*—\ndescending to ascend,\nadvancing to retreat;\nstilling to observe the natural,\nmoving to await yang’s emergence;\nurgently driving the celestial stem,\nleisurely guarding the alchemical furnace;\nreturning to *Taiji*,\nrestoring to utmost sincerity;\nexiting with entering, nonexiting with exiting—\nenduring from ancient times to the present;\naligned with sun and moon,\nunited with Heaven and Earth…\nThus, even when confronting great trials,\nthey find no obstacle impassable.\nEven fierce as rhinoceros or tiger,\nthey dissolve into kindred harmony;\neven sharp as armor or blades,\nthey vanish as if never existed.\n\nWhy then fear the rhinoceros’s horn,\nthe tiger’s claws,\nor the weapons’ strike,\nand calculate life and death,\nexistence and annihilation,\nin a single moment?\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they dwell in the realm of no death.»\n\n「Moreover, the Sage refines their nature and establishes their fate over years.\nWhen gathered, they take form;\nwhen dispersed, they become *qi*.\nThe sun and moon revolve at my command,\nthe winds and thunders obey their summoning.\n\nThough rhinoceros and tiger rage fiercely,\nand weapons may seem formidable,\nhow can they reach what has no form?\nFor only the formless can master the formed—\nnever the formed compel the formless!\n\nAlas, all things with form have life and death,\nbut the Sage, formless, transcends them.\nThey govern the source of life and death—\nall things see them as life and death,\nyet what calamity or harm can they inflict?\nThis is the tenfold *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s completeness,\nthe threefold interplay of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nHumans draw upon the *yang* of *Buqian* (乾) for birth,\nand meet the *yin* of *Bunkun* (坤) to die.\nThis is the fundamental principle of *Taiji*—\nthe interplay of *yin* and *yang*,\nflexing and extending,\ncycling endlessly in cause and effect.\n\nWithout *yin*, *yang* cannot manifest;\nwithout death, life has no meaning.\nThus, retreat and repose are but ways\nto nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.\n\nYet in their abandon to passion and desire,\nwhere reason perishes and humanity is lost,\ntheir death differs from others.\nFor those who follow *yin* and *yang* in life and death\nare truly embraced by *Taiji*’s boundless essence,\ntheir *true qi* flowing in harmony with the two principles.\n\nBut those who defy Nature’s *yin-yang* cycle\nhave lost their original *yuan qi* (元气),\nand are overwhelmed by excessive *yin* and malevolent forces.\n\nHence, they are said to be *“ten with three”* (十有三).\nThe ten represents completeness—*Dao* encompassing Heaven and Earth;\nthe three comes from Heaven’s *One* (天一) generating Water,\nEarth’s *Two* (地二) generating Fire,\nand the union of Heaven’s *One* and Earth’s *Two* forming Water and Fire’s threefold harmony.\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s *One* generates Water,\nand Metal also generates Water;\nEarth’s *Two* generates Fire,\nand Wood also generates Fire—\nthus the four symbols are complete.\n\nThe Earth has no fixed position,\nwandering through the four symbols,\nand in its purest, most refined essence—\nthe *Dao*’s ultimate substance—\nit governs *yin-yang qi*,\ndrives the mechanisms of creation,\nand in Heaven and Earth becomes *Wujiji* (无极).\n\nYet *Taiji*’s principle in the human body:\nstillness brings forth the *yuan shen* (元神) of soundless purity,\nunity without duality;\nmovement manifests *liang zhi liang neng* (良知良能) in timely action—\n*true intent*.\nTogether, they form the Five Phases.\n\nThis is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity\nfor Heaven, Earth, and all beings—\npresent in all things,\nor returning to the boundless *Taixu* (太虚),\nunchanged by life and death’s rise and fall.\n\nThus, those who skillfully cultivate life\nenter their chambers in quietude,\nobserving the *One yang*’s return and renewal,\nand drawing it upward, downward,\nor back to the alchemical furnace for nourishment.\nWith ninefold transformations complete,\nthe fire’s essence is fully refined.\n\nThis is the *Dao*’s height—\nwhere dragons and tigers submit,\nand the *virtue/power* is so profound\nthat even ghosts and spirits yield.\nWhat harm then from rhinoceros, tiger, or blade?\n\nConsider the ancients:\ndwelling in secluded mountains,\nwith rhinoceros and tigers in throngs,\nand wolves as companions,\nyet willingly tamed,\ncontent in their own boundless freedom—\nmany such examples exist.\n\nOr single-riding warriors\nwho command the loyalty of warlords,\nwho abandon armor and weapons,\nrevered as divine,\nloved as kin—\nsuch devotion arises from *Dao*’s profound *virtue/power*.\n\nAnd when filial piety moves Heaven,\nor bandits surrender in sincerity;\nwhen chastity and righteousness stand firm,\nand deceitful hearts are stilled—\nall these stem from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity.\n\nObserve again:\nthe rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,\nthe tiger cannot grasp with its claws,\nthe weapons cannot find purchase—\ntruly, this is no falsehood.\n\nEssentially, the *One yuan*’s *li qi* (理气)\nis not the *yin-yang* of creation.\nI can remain serene and bright,\nformless yet luminous—\nwhat then of life and death?\n\nThose who know life and death\nare bound by its traces,\nbut I can erase those traces,\nreturning to the undivided *ming* (命),\nthe *Taihe* (太和) of Heaven.\nThough traces of life and death may appear,\nthe principle endures unobstructed—\nwhy then rejoice in life,\nor dread death?\n\nThe ancient Sages chose *yi* (义) over life,\nsacrificed their bodies for *ren* (仁).\nThey saw knives and saws as commonplace,\nand boiling cauldrons as trifles—\nwhy was this so?\nBecause they found *Dao* within,\nand knew no fear without.\n\nHence it is said: *“the realm of no death.”*\n\nAnd the sevenfold completion of Water,\nunited with the tenfold, makes thirteen.\n\n**Chapter 51: Reverence for the Dao and Esteem for Virtue/Power**\nThe *Dao* gives birth,\n*virtue/power* sustains it;\nthings take form,\nand forces complete them.\nThus, all things reverence the *Dao* and esteem *virtue/power*.\n\nThe *Dao*’s reverence,\nthe *virtue/power*’s nobility—\nnone command them, yet they endure naturally.\nThe *Dao* gives birth,\n*virtue/power* sustains it,\nnurtures and matures it,\nrefines and perfects it,\ncovers and protects it.\nIt births without possession,\nacts without reliance,\nnourishes without domination—\nthis is *xuan de* (玄德), the profound *virtue/power*.\n\nThe *Dao* has no name,\nand without a name, it is *Wujiji* (无极).\nThis is the pure *qi* of emptiness—\nthe foundation of life’s continuity\nfor Heaven, Earth, and all beings.\nFor it is neither presence nor absence,\nneither vast nor minute—\nit encompasses and covers all things without distinction,\nhence called *“Great Virtue/Power”* (大德).\n\nThe *Dao* is the shared *Taiji* of all things;\nthe *virtue/power* is each thing’s individual *Taiji*.\nThus, all things draw upon life’s source,\nrooted in *Taixu*’s principle,\nand the *One yuan*’s *qi* spreads boundlessly.\n\nNo matter their size or subtlety,\nall rely on the *Dao* for life,\nand entrust their essence to fate’s decree.\nWithin them, *yin-yang* harmonize,\nand the sun and moon revolve—\nlike grasses and trees:\nresting in day and night,\nnourished by dew and rain,\nand thus their roots are cultivated.\n\nThis is the *Dao* giving birth,\nand *virtue/power* sustaining them.\nAll things, receiving this nurturing,\nemit a fragrant influence—\nfirst as *qi*, then as form.\nBy this, they grow unseen yet steadily,\nday by day, month by month,\nuntil humans become fully human,\nand things attain their own perfection without flaw.\n\nThus, all things reverence the *Dao* and esteem *virtue/power*.\nFor the *Dao* is the principle of life’s creation—\nwithout it, life cannot be sustained.\n\n*Virtue/power* is the origin of nurturing all things—\nwithout it, there is no way to store and cultivate.\nHow exalted is the *Dao*, how noble is *virtue/power*?\nYet both are granted from Heaven,\nand take things as their occasion.\nNo need for forced action—\nnaturally aligned with the *Dao*.\nWithout contrivance, *virtue/power* is spontaneously fulfilled.\nNo one commands it, no one ordains it,\nyet ever thus—\nnothing coerced, all returns to nature.\n\nWhat *Dao* is this?\nThe grand central path of Heaven and Earth,\nthe essential key for sages to attain immortality and enlightenment.\nIf one seeks to cultivate the Golden Immortal,\nhow else but through the *Dao*?\n\nThus, one concentrates the spirit in emptiness,\nunites the *qi* in boundlessness.\nAt the threshold of void and stillness,\na single *yuan*’s true *qi* emerges—\nthis is the birth of the *Dao*.\n\nOnce the *Dao* arises,\none then nourishes it in stillness,\ndraws from it in motion.\nHold fast to the One,\nand all phenomena dissolve into emptiness.\nEver maintain, never forget, never assist—\nthen *virtue/power* has its foundation.\n\nFollow the *Dao* in its unfolding,\nand the *Dao* will grow daily.\nNurture *virtue/power* in its essence,\nand *virtue/power* will flourish daily.\nTo grow and nurture—\nlike things thriving in abundance,\nuntil autumn arrives and ripeness is assured.\n\nWhen the *Dao* is thus complete and ripe,\nits cultivation and preservation—\nwhat differs from humanity?\nIt is but returning to the unformed origin,\nrestoring the undivided truth.\n\nUltimately, what is this \"generation\"?\nIts generation is the self-moving *qi* of void.\nWhy claim it as mine to possess?\n\nEven when the signs of *yang*’s birth appear—\ninternally circulating the Heavenly Canopy,\nexternally pushing the Dipper’s handle—\nit seems like action,\nyet purely entrusted to nature,\nwithout the slightest contrivance—\nnot acting, yet not relying on action.\n\nThus, as *virtue/power* advances daily and the *Dao* lengthens,\nthe transformations of *wen* and *wu* unfold,\nand the bath of sealing solidifies—\nall governed by the original spirit.\nThis is having a master yet no master,\nno ruler yet a ruler present.\n\nSuch cultivation—\nhow deep and distant the *Dao* becomes!\nThus it is called *\"Xuan De\"* [Mysterious Virtue].\n\n**Chapter 52: The Origin of the World**\nThe world has its origin,\nwhich becomes the mother of the world.\nHaving obtained its mother,\none knows its child;\nhaving known its child,\none returns to guard its mother—\nthus, no danger in life’s end.\nClose the *xuè* [mouth], seal the gate,\nand labor ceases for life’s span.\nOpen and return to clarity—\nno harm befalls the body—\nthis is called *\"clinging to constancy.\"*\n\nThe essence of the Golden Elixir—\nwhat else is it?\nOnly the primordial *yuan*’s true *qi*,\nwhich the ancients likened to true lead,\nto golden blossoms,\nto white snow,\nto the *White Tiger*’s first crescent *qi*—\nall metaphors for the same:\nwhen *Kàn* [Heaven] and *Kūn* [Earth] unite,\n*Kàn* loses a *yang* and descends into *Kūn*’s palace,\nwhile *Kūn* receives this *yang*’s true golden nature,\nthus solidifying into *Kǎn* [water].\nHence, the elixir is called \"golden\"—\nit falls from *Kàn*’s domain,\nknown in the body as *yang* essence.\nThough dwelling in the water palace,\nit is the primordial *qi*,\nthe mother for elixir cultivation.\n\nThe adept, standing before the furnace,\nmust press the *yang* lead from the water palace\nto serve as the elixir’s mother.\nThus it is said:\n*\"All the body’s blood is pure yin,\nThe body’s yang essence, none recognize.\"*\nThis essence—\nneither within nor without,\nnot entering the six senses’ gates,\nnot among the six dusts—\nhidden in the form’s mountain,\nseen yet unseen, heard yet unheard,\nyet ever generating—\nthe true seed, the great root of the body.\n\nIf the *yin* essence lacks this primordial *yang* lead as its mother,\nthe *yin* essence scatters easily,\nwith no way to congeal into the elixir.\n\nThe *qi* thus is the same as that of all sentient beings—\nboiled and refined in the cauldron and furnace;\nthen the primordial *Dao*’s *yang* essence and the ultimate *yin* essence,\nemerge from the void’s extreme stillness and profound obscurity—\nthis is the elixir’s mother, also the mother *qi*.\n\nWith *yang* fire pressing it,\nit ascends in flight to the *níhuáng* (泥丸),\nmingling with long-accumulated *yin* karma and dissolving,\ndescending to the upper palate,\ntransforming into sweet dew—\nthis is the *yin* essence, also called *ziqi* (子气).\n\nFrom this point, it descends to the *Chónglóu* (重楼),\npouring into the divine chamber,\nto be ingested and swallowed,\nnurturing the gentle divine fire,\nadjusting and nourishing this primordial *Dao*’s *yang* essence and ultimate *yin* essence.\nThus, the *Tàishàng* (太上) says:\n*\"Once the mother is obtained, the child is known;\nOnce the child is known, return to guard the mother.\"*\nAt first, the mother clings to the child and comes,\nthen the child clings to the mother and dwells,\nand finally, the child and mother unite in harmony and mutually nurture,\nas *yin* and *yang* reverse and merge in oneness—\nthough the body perishes, no harm befalls.\n\nFrom this moment, firmly adhere to the central rule:\none soul internally contained,\nensuring that internal thoughts do not stray outward,\nexternal thoughts do not intrude inward,\nkeeping silent and sealing the six gates,\nsoftly and subtly, unchanging and unceasing,\nneither helping nor forgetting,\nacting or not acting as if diligent or not.\nThus throughout life, the *Jīnxiān* (金仙) attainment is realized.\n\nOtherwise, if one seeks external gains,\none has already lost the internal treasure.\nAs it is said:\n*\"When the mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;\nWhen the mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes.\"*\nHeeding the external while neglecting the internal—\nthe life’s essence is already spent,\nwhere then is the life’s root?\nThus, it is unsalvageable throughout one’s life.\n\nIf a person can close the *duì* (兑) and seal the gates,\npreserving the essence and abundance of *qi*,\nmerging the mother *qi* and child *qi* into the elixir,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"The Primordial Emperor of the *Yuánshǐ* (元始) suspended a single millet-seed pearl in the void,\nseemingly present yet not present,\nseemingly empty yet not empty—\nonly those who silently recognize and merge their hearts can perceive it.\nNone are smaller than this elixir;\nthose who can see it are truly wise.\"*\n\nWhen the *yang* essence arises,\nthe entire body softens like silk—\nthis is the utmost gentleness.\nIf one can guard this gentlest *qi*,\nwithout mingling a single thought,\nwithout adding a single perception,\nover time, it will naturally give rise to vast, surging *qi*,\npiercing the heavens and passing through the sun.\nThus, *\"Guarding softness is called strength.\"*\n\nHowever, at the outset,\nthe divine light descends to illuminate the *qìhǎi* (气海),\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nthe golden essence radiantly manifests,\nlike tides, like flames,\nlike mist, like smoke—\nthen I must withdraw my sight and return my hearing,\nprotecting its brilliance,\nguiding it back to the earthen cauldron,\nrestoring it to my primordial *yīqì* (一气).\nIf small, it repels illness and prolongs life;\nif great, it achieves immortality and sainthood—\nwhat harm can the body suffer then?\nOtherwise, old age, sickness, and death,\ncome swiftly—\nhow can one not grieve?\nAll this is self-made;\nthe heavens do not predestine such limits.\n\nIf a person does not cherish the *Dao*,\ndo they not at least cherish their body?\nDo not abandon your body to calamity—\nregret will come too late.\n\nThis is the *Dao* of True Constancy,\nonly the Sage can follow its constancy,\nwithout defying its way.\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nthey reach the divine and boundless,\nthe ever-changing and unfathomable.\nThe saying goes:\n*\"Steadfastness is the foundation for sainthood;\na vacant heart is the vessel for the *Dao*.\"\nHow can one neglect this?*\n\nThis refers to the true *yang* essence,\nwhich originates from the moment one receives *qi* and forms the body.\nLife arises from *qi*;\nhow can *qi* be trifled with?\nConsider before birth—\nwas there not already this *qi*?\nAfter death—\nthis *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.\nThe primordial *yīqì* (一气) hangs suspended in the great void,\nwherever there is form, *qi* is within it,\nwherever there is no form, *qi* returns to the great void.\nAll things within heaven and earth,\nwith tangible manifestations,\nhave birth and death to speak of,\nbut this *qi* neither generates nor perishes,\nneither defiles nor purifies,\nneither increases nor decreases—\nempty yet not empty,\nnot empty yet empty,\nmost divine and most wondrous—\nthus it is the initial *qi* for all things under heaven to sustain life ceaselessly.\nIf a practitioner of the *Dao* knows this initial *qi*,\nthen the way of longevity can be attained,\nand the station of the Immortals can be realized.\n\nThe Immortals have no other marvel,\nmerely clinging to the *yang* essence and nurturing the *yin* essence,\nrefining them endlessly—\nthen the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* essence,\nand the *yang* essence returns to *yang* spirit,\nas it is said:\n*\"This body is not the body of a mortal,\nbut the body of an Immortal from the *Dàluó* (大罗) Heaven.\"*\n\nIf one were to cultivate only one aspect,\nhow could one attain the marvel of both form and spirit,\nunited with the True *Dao*,\nreaching the utmost extremes of transformation,\nand achieving the most saintly and enlightened state?\nThus, when the fire’s time arrives,\nthe golden elixir manifests,\nnaturally forgetting speech,\nforgetting taste,\nforgetting smell,\nseeing yet not seeing,\nhearing yet not hearing—\nas it is said:\n*\"The elixir field holds treasure,\nnaturally forgetting all emotions when confronted with phenomena.\"*\n\nThis is the principle of valuing the internal over the external,\nguarding the internal while forgetting the external—\nan immutable law.\nYet before obtaining the elixir,\none must still close the *duì* (兑) and seal the gates,\nto accumulate essence and *qi*.\nKnow that the small elixir is the mark of wisdom,\nand guarding the *Tàihé* (太和) brings natural strength.\n\nEntering *qi* with the spirit,\nstoring the spirit within *qi*—\nsuddenly, a single millet-seed pearl,\nits light illuminating the *dharma* realm—\nthis is the golden elixir’s radiance,\nthe moment when the Great *Dao* is about to manifest.\nAt first, the spirit descends to await the *qi*,\nthen the *qi* arises,\nand again the spirit presses it upward,\ndrives it back to its source—\nthus the elixir of longevity is obtained,\nand what harm can the body suffer?\n\nThis is achieved by constant vigilance,\nunceasingly flowing forth.\n---\n**Chapter 53: Walking the Great *Dao***\n\n*\"Though I have some knowledge,*\n*walking the Great *Dao*,\n*only reverence is my fear.\"*\n\nThe Great *Dao* is most level,\nyet people prefer narrow paths.\nThe morning is most clear,\nyet the fields grow overgrown,\nthe granaries empty;\n\n「Wearing fine silks and adorned with sharp blades,\ndisdaining sustenance yet hoarding wealth—\nthis is called the *thief of the Dao’s staff*.\nHow far from the *Dao*!\n\nThe *Dao* of the gentleman begins with husband and wife;\nthe *Dao* of the sage does not stray beyond yin and yang.\nIf one can move in accordance with Heaven,\nand act naturally in alignment with one’s nature—\nto cultivate oneself is *ren* (benevolence),\nto harmonize with things is *zhi* (wisdom).\nUniting inner and outer to achieve singular accord,\nthus all things find their place and all actions are fitting.\nWhat need is there for contrivance or artifice?\nYet the *Dao* is fundamentally level and plain,\nwithout hidden strangeness or monstrous deviation.\nIn the latter ages, men loathe moderation,\npreferring the bizarre and novel,\nand so they stray to crooked paths,\nunaware of their true course.\n\nTake the court: its laws and institutions\nare indeed the means to transform the people,\nyet those in ignorance fail to recognize them,\nand instead seek only to overturn them.\nThey delight in new arrivals and despise old ministers,\nfavor constant upheaval and change the state’s governance.\nAncestral precedents are discarded,\nas though a man’s vital *qi* were wounded and lost.\nMorning policies are abandoned,\nthe countryside lacks proper models.\nThus, the people neglect farming for ease,\nfields and lands grow overgrown,\ngrasses and herbs are left untended,\nand the sources of wealth are exhausted.\nDaily waste increases,\ngranaries are depleted,\nlegumes and grains vanish,\nand stored wealth is spent.\nIs this not like the depletion of a man’s *jing* (essence) and *qi*,\nconsumed and worn away until none remains?\n\nThey do not seek inner substance,\nonly outward display.\nThus, garments must gleam with utmost splendor,\nblades and swords must vie in sharpness and brilliance,\nfeasts must overflow with rare delicacies,\nand treasures must be piled high—\nunmindful of the scarcity of their roots,\nonly competing in the flourishing of their branches.\nYet to desire endless taking,\nunexhausted use,\nand seamless execution—\nis this not sheer folly?\n\nAll this stems from neglecting the natural *Dao* of Heaven,\nand abandoning the unadorned *Dao* of daily practice.\nIt is as though a thief steals goods,\nhiding his head while exposing his tail—\nlike a staff standing upright,\nits shadow seen but its form concealed.\nThis is a metaphor for those who practice the *Dao*\nbut confuse falsehood for truth.\n\nThe Great *Dao*—how lofty it is!\nThis fleeting comprehension is but sudden knowledge,\nunplanned, unforced—\nno need for contrivance or artificiality.»\n\n「Vast and boundless, the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth at their first opening—\nthis is the original *ancestral qi* of the Preheaven.\n\nIt is like Mencius’ sudden perception when seeing a child fall into a well,\nthat moment of shock and compassionate distress.\nMy *Dao* speaks of knowledge arising from utter ignorance—\nthis is true *liángzhī* (良知, innate true-knowing).\n\nThe stirrings of such true-knowing are not difficult to recognize,\nbut to act upon them and sustain them eternally—\nthis is no simple task.\n\nWhen it moves, it is right before one’s eyes,\nyet in an instant, the lure of external things arises,\ndesires well up, emotions take shape—\nunaware, it slips into the private knowledge of Postheaven.\n\nThis is why it must be tempered and applied,\nand why it is so formidable.\n\nOnly when the eyes hold the *smart pearl* (智珠),\nand the chest wields the *wisdom blade* (慧剑),\ncan one pierce through demons,\nsever the threads of desire—\nfrom refining elixirs to attaining the *still point* (还丹),\nall are true-knowing unfolding into true abilities,\na straightforward path with no oddity—\nthis is why the Great *Dao* is so level and easy.\n\nAlas, the Great *Dao* is plain and ordinary,\nyet those who rush forward in haste to seek results\noften fail to follow the broad and straight way,\nstraying into narrow, twisted paths,\nmistaking themselves for those who have attained the *Dao*,\nyet never awakening in their entire lives—\nhow lamentable this is!\n\n*\"Zhōu yù\"* (朝喻) is the body;\nthe body wishes to be refined, not destroyed,\nso one must suppress evil and preserve sincerity—\nonly then can human desires begin to be purified,\nand Heavenly principle fully realized.\n\nWith time, the luminous light shines forth,\nhow could the field of the heart ever be overgrown?\nWith spirit unified, how could the storehouse ever be empty?\nWithout embroidered adornment, one’s honor is self-fulfilled;\nwithout ointments or grains, one’s hunger is satisfied—\nwhy cling to outward embellishments,\nor weary of food and drink?\n\nThe *wisdom blade* is sharp indeed—\nexternal weapons are of no use.\nThe Three Treasures fully attained—\ninternal wealth is inexhaustible.\n\nIf one attains this,\nthey truly steal Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* (灵阳) *qi* to make the elixir.\n\nYet today’s practitioners,\nnot following *Zhōngyōng* (中庸, the Middle Way),\ndaily incline toward perverse paths—\na body encrusted with dust,\nits filth too vast to cleanse.\nMoreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune,\nlosing the primordial *yáng* (元阳) *qi*.\n\nThus, distractions come thick and fast,\nleaving no trace of an empty, transcendent spirit.\nWhen desolation reaches its peak,\nare not the orifices fully sealed?\nWhen strength is exhausted and spirit weary,\nwhat sign of fullness remains?\nPoverty is cause for sighing—\nhas not the vital *qi* been fully drained?\n\nThey boast of outward brilliance,\nyet their adornments are but superficial.\nThey praise the blade’s edge,\nyet their belts are mere symbols of status—\nthis is already the end!\n\nYet they persist: disdaining food to indulge in rare delicacies,\ncoveting wealth to seek abundance—\nwhy not ponder how practitioners cleverly manipulate techniques,\nstealing back primordial *qi*,\nseeking what lies within rather than without?\nThe *Yì* (《易》, *Book of Changes*) says:\n*“The one who composes the *Yì* knows the art of thievery.”*\nThis is exactly what it means.\n\nIf one abandons this to seek other paths,\nhow fragmented can it be—\ndare one call it the Great *Dao*?\n\nOthers comment that the phrase *“Jièrán”* (介然)\nand the following sentences speak of a fleeting moment\nwhen a single thread of light appears—\nhow could this not be knowledge?\nYet when tested in actual practice,\none often falters in execution,\nso it is called formidable.\nThis reveals the difficulty of understanding the Great *Dao*.\n\nThe next section discusses scholars\nwho fail to grasp the fundamental source,\nmerely priding themselves on outward refinement,\nwho do not seek true traces\nbut only chase empty fame—\nlike standing a staff and seeing its shadow,\ngrasping its likeness but not its truth,\nso they are called *thieves of the staff* (盗竿).\n\nThis critique is also apt.\nFrom ancient times, all who practiced the *Dao*,\ntheir skin supple and radiant,\ntheir hair lustrous and bright—\nthese effects, though common to all,\ncannot yet be taken as definitive proof.\n\nWhat of refining the *jīng* (精, essence) and *qì* (气, *qi*)?\nWhen the *yáng* (阳) light touches,\nhow could the *yīn* (阴) gloom endure?\nLike frost and snow melting in the sun.\n\nThus, even chronic ailments and old diseases\ntransform into festering sores and pus,\ndischarged through the large and small intestines—\nnot only novices suffer this,\neven at the stage of the *Great Elixir* (大丹) attainment,\nchanges still occur.\nThe Three Corpses and Six Bandits (三尸六贼),\nbleeding and oozing pus,\ntheir stench unbearable—\nonly those whose mind is settled and intent\ncan truly trust in the principles,\nand deeply verify the scriptures.\n\nOne must know that suppressing desire and preserving sincerity,\nremoving turbidity and retaining clarity,\neach layer reveals *yīn* *qi* dispelled\nand *yáng* *qi* subtly growing—\npractitioners of the *Dao* must not overlook these inner transformations.\n\nDo not fixate on a radiant body,\nor swift, light steps—\nthese are not reliable signs.\nNor trust in levitating through clouds,\nappearing and vanishing like ghosts and spirits,\ninstantaneous transformations of *yáng* *qi*,\nor traversing ten thousand miles in a moment—\nthese too are not to be taken as the *Dao*.\n\nFor marvels and oddities,\nheterodox and perverse teachings,\nmust lead one astray,\ncreating deviant forms.\nWhat a pity that one’s entire life’s energy\nis wasted in left-handed paths and false gates!\nTo seek transcendence yet fall into the Three Paths and Six Realms (三途六道),\nis this not deeply regrettable?\n\nThe essence of this chapter from the *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Venerable)\nteaches that only by recognizing true-knowing\ncan one avoid error.\n\nYet today’s practitioners of the *Dao*,\nonly seek delicate complexions,\nand robust physiques—\nthey do not realize that external labor\nwears the mind,\nwhile the inner fields lie fallow,\nthe treasure-houses empty.\nMany are harmed by Heaven’s *qi* before they even begin.\n\nPostheavenly treasures, though present,\nare of what use?\nTruly, when the Three Treasures unite,\nthe outer form naturally glows.\nThose who chase external effects,\nboasting of food and clothing—\nwhy not seek within,\nand first enrich the inner wealth?\nWhen the inner wealth is abundant,\nthe outer wealth will follow naturally.\nIs this not unlike thieves,\nwho steal not Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* *qi*,\nbut only the fame of sages’ cultivation?\n\n**Chapter 54: Cultivating the Body**\nThose who build well do not topple,\nthose who embrace well do not fall away—\ntheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivating the body,\nits *virtue* (德) is complete;\nCultivating the family,\nits *virtue* is abundant;\nCultivating the village,\nits *virtue* grows long;\nCultivating the state,\nits *virtue* becomes plentiful.」\n\n「Cultivating the Dao in the world,\nits *virtue* becomes universal.\nThus, one observes the body through the body,\nthe family through the family,\nthe village through the village,\nthe state through the state,\nthe world through the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nHeaven and Earth, in giving birth to humanity,\nendow them with *qi* to establish their fate,\nand with *principle* (理) to complete their nature.\n*Principle* and *qi* originally are one,\nnature and fate are never separate.\nAll arise from the pure, empty *qi*,\nswirling through Heaven and Earth,\nfilling and emptying in ebb and flow,\npurely natural, as creation unfolds,\nacross countless ages.\nThough humanity may differ in refinement,\nand the Creator’s gifts may vary in measure,\nthis *qi* is the same,\nthis *principle* is the same—\nnever altered, never changed.\n\nThe Sage stands at the center, erect and unshaken,\nindependent yet not leaning,\nupright yet not faltering.\nThough prosperity and adversity, gain and loss,\njoy and sorrow, life and death\ndiffer in myriad ways,\nthis *principle* and this *qi*\nflow within a single body,\nfilling the two great realms—\nnever diminished, not even slightly.\nIs this not what is meant by *“those who build well do not topple”*?\nOtherwise, though solid and substantial—\neven towering Tai Mountain, lofty and vast,\nstill faces ruin and collapse.\nFor what is shaped, though firm, cannot endure.\nOnly the formless *principle* and *qi*,\nunchanging with things, unmoved by numbers,\nenduring through all ages, ever new.\n\nThis Dao established within oneself,\ntransforming and harmonizing all people,\nnaturally brings deep benevolence and abundant grace,\npenetrating to the marrow and flesh,\nso the people love and revere them,\nclinging in devotion without separation—\nnot even for a breath’s parting.\nThough bound like glue and lacquer, it may be firm;\nthough mingled like water and milk, it may be harmonious—\nyet gathering and scattering are transient,\nchange and transformation swift,\nand in a moment, discord appears.\nBut benevolent heart and benevolent reputation—\nthose touched by its grace love without forgetting,\nthose who hear its wind cherish without abandoning.\nHow different from children depending on their parents,\nor limbs obeying the heart—\nno separation, no estrangement.\nIs this not *“those who embrace well do not fall away”*?\n\nFrom this, the virtuous cherish their own and their kin,\nthe petty delight in their own pleasures and seek their own gains—\nyet all govern under the same banner,\nrevering the rest of the effortless.\nThough the Sage may not always remain,\ntheir *virtue* and grace, deeply rooted in the heart,\nendure through all ages without ceasing.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*“Generation after generation, descendants,\ndo not let it fade away.”*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nOnce, Confucius praised Shun’s great filial piety:\n*“The ancestral temple enjoys him,\nhis descendants preserve him.”*\nThis shows that *virtue* is boundless,\nand descendants’ sacrifices\nare never interrupted through the ages,\nrenewed at every ancestral feast.\nIt is said:\n*“He who has *virtue* for ten generations\nshall have descendants to preserve it for ten generations.\nHe who has *virtue* for a hundred generations\nshall have descendants to preserve it for a hundred generations.”*\nAnd for those whose *virtue* endures eternally—\nthough billions of years pass,\ntheir descendants, generation upon generation,\ngrow ever more numerous and flourishing.\nSuch is the unchanging truth.\n\nAll this comes from the Dao of effortless naturalness,\ncultivated within oneself yet never lost,\nextended to others yet never forgotten—\nthus Heaven’s body thrives eternally,\nand the world enjoys boundless blessings.\n\nWhen a person cultivates this Dao in their body,\ntheir form and spirit both attain perfection,\nmerging with the True Dao.\nDao is body, body is Dao—\nthe two are one, without division.\nWhat then is *virtue* but truth?\n\nMoreover, when the Dao is cultivated in a village,\nthe village unites as one body;\nwhen the Dao is cultivated in a state,\nthe state regards itself as one person.\nHow much greater then is its *virtue*’s length and abundance?\n\nIf one can remain still and govern without action,\nserene and desireless,\nnaturally the winds of the four directions will stir,\nthe world will turn toward benevolence,\nthe people will cherish its *virtue* without end—\nhow universal is its *virtue*!\nThis is not achieved by coercion or enticement with gain.\nIt stems from the innate goodness within,\ncultivating the true heart in freedom—\nlike a wandering child longing for home,\nor an old man rejoicing in reunion.\nJoy comes unbidden yet arrives naturally.\n\nThough people differ in form, their hearts are not unlike,\ntheir fates the same, their natures aligned.\nThus, manifesting *virtue* renews the people,\nand calming them begins with self-cultivation—\nno difference exists.\n\nMoreover, a village is the accumulation of a family,\na state the expansion of a village.\nThe world, vast and populous,\nis nothing but the gradual extension of one family,\none village, one state.\nTo know the Dao of one person is to know the Dao of family, state, and Heaven as one.\nTo cultivate oneself is to cultivate family, state, and world.\nSeeking within, one must extend outward—\nthus, silently transforming, effortlessly changing customs,\nthe people naturally rejoice together in harmony.\nTherefore it is said:\n*“Only when *virtue* transforms does humanity arise,\nand only when humanity arises do customs form.”*\nIts Dao originates in the body,\nits *virtue* extends to the family,\nand its transformation spreads like grass bending before the wind—\nreaching no distance it does not encompass,\nspreading through village and state to the world.\n\nAh! How do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*“Great is the Primordial of Heaven!\nFirm and strong, moderate and correct,\npure and complete, precise and unceasing!”*\nThis is the Dao as preheavenal *Yin* gold,\nmost firm, most vigorous,\nerect between Heaven and Earth,\nflowing through all things within,\nembracing all without remainder,\nits sincerity never exhausted.\nIts power ever extends yet never bends,\nstraight yet unyielding—\nsupporting Heaven, sustaining Earth,\nreaching the Han, piercing the sky,\nthe state never even slightly toppled.\nYet it is the utmost of the boundless,\nthe most divine of the unmanifest,\nthus standing unshaken to this day.»\n\nThe human being, if able to establish their foundation in the boundless (*wújí*), erect their primordial spirit (*yuánshén*), then as the ancients said: *\"harvest the great medicine from the stillness within\"* and *\"conduct the fire-alchemy within the realm of non-action.\"* Dwelling at the center and establishing the pole, the vast *qi* arises—*qi* dependent upon spirit, spirit and *qi* mutually resonating, knotted as one cluster, thus returning to the root and restoring the command—*Dao* abides forever.\n\nNow, the birth of humanity: spirit and *qi* unite; in death, spirit and *qi* separate. If one harmonizes nature and life, blending spirit and *qi*, then they embrace the Primordial and preserve the One. My life is determined by me, not by Heaven—what escape is there? Thus, spirit depends upon spirit, *qi* upon *qi*, a single pulse transmitted, a single truth permeating—one can then undergo myriad transformations, vanishing as ghosts and emerging as gods, manifesting countless, boundless forms, enjoying countless, boundless years. How could it be otherwise than: *\"a child begets a grandson, who again begets a child, child upon child, grandson upon grandson—roots deep and leaves flourishing, source distant and flow enduring, with unbroken ancestral rites across ten thousand generations?\"*\n\nYet it is no more than using primordial *qi* as medicine and primordial spirit as the alchemical fire. For primordial *qi* is no-*qi*, primordial spirit is no-spirit. Refining *qi* with spirit to attain the *Dao* is like refining medicine with fire to forge the elixir. Common elixirs may succeed or fail, but the divine elixir knows no end nor beginning—thus it is said: *\"The Great Elixir Dao endures ten thousand years without erosion.\"* It is nothing but cultivating one’s own virtue and perfecting one’s own body, not relying on later acquisitions or external sources—thus its virtue is true.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth give birth to humanity, clean and turbid differing, the wise and unwise varied, yet when the august and sacred descend—from the family to the world—each possesses an inherent constancy. Thus, a single heart can permeate myriad households, a single virtue can inspire myriad people. Cultivating the self to harmonize the family leaves virtue in abundance; cultivating the self to transform the village extends virtue’s reach. As for governing the state and pacifying the world, it is nothing but *\"sitting in ease while the world transforms\"*—there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such success. This is the constant *Dao* of the age.\n\nConversely, if one cultivates the self, how could it differ? Discussing the state and the world, it is fundamentally a matter of progressing from near to far, layer by layer. When the three—refined essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit—are all present, it is not a step-by-step process. Speaking of initial practice: *\"refining essence,\"* yet *qi* and spirit are also involved. The second step: *\"refining qi,\"* yet spirit and essence are also present. The third step: *\"refining spirit,\"* yet essence and *qi* are also there. Returning to emptiness and merging with the *Dao*, the *Dao* merging with nature—from beginning to end, they never depart. To depart is to lose the *Dao*.\n\nThe body is like essence, but essence is not the essence of mutual resonance—it is the primordial essence received from the void’s five elements at birth. Cultivating the body is refining essence into *qi*. The practitioner, at the outset, obtains this essence to live and grow with it. Cultivating with essence is no different from cultivating the body itself—how true is this! Speaking of *qi*, essence is closer to the body, while *qi* is slightly more distant. *\"Cultivating the family, its virtue is abundant\"*—for gathering external true yang *qi* to refine internal true yin essence is like harmonizing the self to govern the family. What surplus does one not possess from what is inherently one’s own?\n\nThe village, when viewed from the body, is even more distant, yet closer than the family—just as spirit is. Spirit, like fire, belongs to *qi* in its heat and to spirit in its light—thus, two yet one. Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to emptiness. Hence it is said: *\"Its virtue is enduring,\"* for longevity and vast duration. As for the state, compared to the village it is nearer, yet more distant than the body—its breadth and width cannot be seen at a glance. The state is like the void; cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the *Dao*. When refining reaches the void, it becomes one with pure emptiness, illuminating the great thousand—how much more so the world! Thus it is said: *\"Its virtue is universal.\"*\n\nAs for observing the body through the body, the family through the family, the village through the village, the state through the state, and the world through the world—it is nothing but using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family, taking the highest as an analogy. The intent is profound, the meaning subtle. The Great *Dao* has no other path—refined to its utmost, reaching the natural void. Exhausted!\n\nThose who study the Great *Dao* have no other way than *\"reducing again and again, until non-action is natural.\"* Non-action yet nothing remains undone—exhausted!\n\nYet internal elixirs and external elixirs, internal *dan* and external *dan*—filling the *kàn* with *lì*, extracting lead and adding mercury—various metaphors and names, ultimately no more than cultivating the essence, *qi*, and spirit inherent in the body, received from Heaven and Earth at birth. Since they come with life, they are inherently possessed, yet they become enmeshed in the fleshly shell—thus they are called *\"yin essence, yin qi, yin spirit.\"* Since they come with life, they are called *\"internal medicine.\"*\n\nWhen the practitioner begins their work, they must first close the senses and concentrate within, regulating their breath, merging the three primals into one cauldron, and refining the three primals within that single cauldron—named *\"refining essence,\"* yet in truth, spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice. Only when spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely, blending into one, does the *qi*-mechanism activate, steaming and floating—this is called *\"qi-transformation,\"* or *\"gold born from water’s depths,\"* or *\"the common parents unite to produce the medicine.\"* This is the way of the world’s men and women, requiring the method of procreation. If one does not know the reverse cultivation, the essence will instantly transform into tangible, post-heavenly *qi*, leaking through the kidney passage. Hence: *\"Consolidate the *qi*, preserve the essence—this is the decisive path to longevity.\"*\n\nIf one seeks longevity, the transformation of essence into *qi* is the wondrous elixir of life.\n\n「When conflicts arise, one must urgently summon the *Tian Gang* (天罡) to subdue within, thrust the *Dou Bing* (斗柄) outward, advance and retreat the *He Che* (河车), and draw back the *Zhong Gong* (中宫) to forge anew. This is the refining of the inner elixir, where essence, *qi*, and spirit merge into one—how could it be merely *qi-transformation*?\n\nThe interplay of inner and outer, of *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离), begins with the body’s inherent capacities, converging in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), nurturing for a moment, and thus *qi* is born—this is the infusion of spirit into *qi*, whereby the essence within the body refines the *Ling Yang* (灵阳, \"heavenly earthly *qi*\") drawn from the cosmos, achieving *essence-refining into *qi-transformation***.\n\nNext, this *qi* is drawn and ascended, guided and descended, returning to the *Tu Fu* (土釜, \"earthly cauldron\") for repeated steaming and refining—this is the method of *\"leads smelting mercury\"* (铅制汞), where the *yang qi* submits to the *yin essence*. The essence is originally what the body inherently possesses, hence it is called *\"Li ji yin jing\"* (离己阴精, \"separate from oneself *yin essence*\"*). The *qi*, born from essence-transformation, is thus termed *\"Kan wu yang qi\"* (坎戊阳气, \"Kan’s *wu* phase *yang qi*\"*).\n\nNot all *qi* belongs to the heart, nor is it generated within the kidneys. From *Yong Quan* (涌泉) to *Qi Hai* (气海) all belong to *yang*—*yang* is *Kan*. From *Ni Wan* (泥丸) to *Xuan Guan* (玄关) all belong to *yin*—*yin* is *Li*. Thus, the *qi* of water and fire is *Kan* and *Li*, not the heart and kidneys themselves, which is now clear.\n\nAgain, when *Kan* contains *qi*, it is called *Di Po* (地魄)—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎, \"White Tiger\") of external elixir, and the *Jin Dan* (金丹, \"Golden Elixir\") of the inner. This elixir arises from extracting *lead* (铅) and adding *mercury* (汞), merging into one—both belong to the *Shui Fu* (水府, \"Water Palace\") *Xuan Zhu* (玄珠, \"Mysterious Pearl\").\n\nThe distinction between inner and outer is but layer upon layer, not truly separate. When the *Li Gong* (离宫, \"Abode of *Li*\") contains essence, it is called *Tian Hun* (天魂, \"Heavenly Soul\")—this is the *Qing Long* (青龙, \"Green Dragon\") of external elixir, but the true essence of oneself in the inner. *\"Jin born from water\"* (水中金生) is the *qi* transforming within essence—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎) *initial crescent qi* (初弦之气) of external elixir, and the *silver within lead* (铅中之银) of the inner.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Jin Dan* (金丹) is the supreme elixir of longevity.\" Only when this *Qian Yuan* (乾元, \"Primordial *Qian*\") *qi* sinks into the human body, and is not smelted by the *Shen Huo* (神火, \"spiritual fire\"), will it remain submerged and inert. And even when it moves and inclines, this is like the oil in a lamp—without oil, the lamp extinguishes; without *qi*, the person perishes. Life arises from this, hence it is the supreme elixir of longevity.\n\nFor it originally falls into *Kan* (坎) from *Qian* (乾), yet now returns from *Kan* to *Qian*—this is the origin of the *Jin Dan* doctrine.\n\nIf one seeks longevity, apart from this *Shui Xiang* (水乡, \"Water Domain\") *lead* (铅) essence, there is no other path. Though this *Jin Dan* is said to be inherent in all, without the *Shen Huo* (神火) to temper and refine it, there is no way to produce it.\n\nOnce the true *gold* (真金) is born, one must again subdue the *Bai Hu* (白虎) and tame the *Long* (龙), causing the *Qing Long* (青龙) to submit to the *Hu* (虎). The *Long* (龙) and *Hu* (虎) *qi* reconverge in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), their *qi* devouring and consuming each other to form *Jin Dan*.\n\nWhen the *qi* returns to the *Tu Fu* (土釜) and meets with true essence, it is nurtured by the *Shen Huo* (神火) to form the *Sheng Tai* (圣胎, \"Sacred Embryo\"). Once the embryo is formed, internally one employs the natural spiritual fire, softly permeating the *Shen Fang* (神房, \"Spiritual Chamber\"), while externally adding the drawn and tempered mundane fire, flowing throughout the body. This is the daily practice of *\"packaging one’s own mercury to consolidate true essence\"* (运己汞包固真精); over time, the embryo dissolves and one transcends.\n\nAscending to the *Ni Wan* (泥丸), refining all voids, one strives to return to the original, natural state. It is neither the three treasures of essence, *qi*, and spirit being distinct, nor the inner and outer elixirs being separate. If one does not sit until the meditation cushion is worn through, nor grind until the knees are calloused, enduring self-suffering and self-refinement—how could one ever penetrate the profound truth?\n\nI now briefly record the general principles, merely pointing the way for later students. The Dao is inherently ordinary, nothing extraordinary—yet the more one refines, the more ordinary it becomes.\n\nOther transformations are unfathomable; in the eyes of the world, they seem unattainable heights, mysteries beyond comprehension. Yet, as the *Taoist Canon of the Supreme Dao* (太上道德一经) reveals, even the Three Pure Ones (三清) and the Supreme Venerable (太上) are but ordinary mortals transformed.\n\nFor the mortal clings to life and death as joys and sorrows, while the sage views them as day and night. Life and death are like waking and sleeping—one must follow them naturally, without disturbance. Those who say longevity and immortality are the delight of the sage are mistaken.\n\nThe mortal takes pride in longevity, but the sage finds joy in *Xu Li* (须理, \"following the natural order\"). Even if one sacrifices life for virtue (*Sha Sheng Cheng Ren* 杀生成仁) or discards life for righteousness (*She Sheng Qu Yi* 舍生取义), it is something the sage has always willingly embraced. Otherwise, who would not fear the horrors of the guillotine and the saw?\n\nFrom ancient times, noble and virtuous souls have often regarded the cauldron and the furnace as joyous realms, and death as a peaceful path—because they have seen the truth clearly and believed in the fate of life. Their life and death are but the operation of this heart. To live in unease is worse than to die swiftly, just as to cling to pain while awake is worse than to rest in eternal slumber.\n\nSo long as spirit remains and principle is complete, what is life to be honored, or death to be shamed? One who listens to the operations of *Zao Hua* (造化, \"Creation and Transformation\") will never cling to life in the mortal world.\n\nIf one loves life and fears death, they are but vulgar and common folk, not the study of sages who follow the natural order in all things. Otherwise, why did Confucius die at seventy, and Yanzi at thirty? They acted according to Heaven’s will, daring not to defy it.\n\nThis is something no ordinary mortal could ever comprehend.»\n\n「I secretly hope that scholars seek only what is within, without concern for what is without, and view adversity, ease, life, and death all with equal indifference.\n\nWhat breadth, what tranquility this heart possesses! The saying goes: *“Recognize the Dao, and let fate unfold as Heaven arranges it.”*\n\nThus attaining ease in life and serenity in death, forever becoming a transcendent sage beyond the world—is this not superior to those who cling to life and fear death, now and then rejoicing within, now and then burdened with sorrow, their hearts never finding peace?\n\nMoreover, those of lofty Dao, whom Heaven wishes to retain as models to guide the common folk—I do not reject them, nor do I pursue them; I simply listen to Heaven’s will. How could my heart ever be troubled by such matters?\n\nFor life and death are both the Dao. To live fully in the Dao and die fully in the Dao—what need then for love or aversion?\n\nAll who harbor attachments within their hearts will see their spirit disrupted and their nature lost, unworthy of being called sages.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Depth of Virtue/Power**\n\nThe depth of virtue/power is like that of a newborn babe.\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not seize,\npredatory birds do not snatch.\n\nThough bones are frail and sinews soft, their grasp is firm;\nbefore knowing the union of male and female, yet already formed—this is the utmost refinement of essence.\nTo cry all day yet never hoarse—this is the utmost harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is to know constancy;\nto know constancy is to know clarity.\nTo nurture life is auspicious.\nThe heart directing *qi* is strength.\n\nWhen things flourish, they age and decay—this is called un-Dao;\nthe un-Dao perishes swiftly.\n\nThe *Yijing* says: *“Heaven and Earth blend like the finest silk, and all things are transformed into purity. The union of male and female *qi* brings forth all things.”*\nFrom the beginning of creation, they are not far from Heaven—\ntheir *qi* is tender and supple.\nIf one follows its momentum and guides it,\nwelcomes its opportunity and nourishes it,\none may yet reach the realm of pristine refinement,\nthe ultimate harmony of Heaven.\n\nMencius said: *“The noble sage does not lose the heart of a newborn babe.”*\nFor when a babe first emits its cry upon the earth,\nthough it possesses its own world of *Yin-Yang*,\nand initiates its own Creation and Transformation,\nstill it is pure and unadulterated—\na single mass of Heaven’s true nature in its embrace.\nWithout knowledge, without thought,\nstatic yet harmonious, moving yet in accord with Heaven.\n\nThe ancient sages and transcendent ones contained vast light and boundless virtue/power,\ncomparable in depth to that of a newborn babe.\n\nIn the moment of their parents’ embrace,\nwhen nurtured and cared for,\ntheir feet cannot walk,\ntheir hands cannot act.\n\nThough poisonous insects are present,\nthey cannot sting them;\nthough ferocious beasts are near,\nthey cannot seize them.」\n\n「Though fierce raptors may be present,\nthey have no way to strike—\nfor when in motion, they do not know where to go,\nand when they walk, they do not know where to tread.\nThus, they fear no poisonous insects,\nand the insects cannot sting them;\nthey fear no ferocious beasts,\nand the beasts cannot seize them.\n\nYet when they lie dangerously on a bed,\nor rest peacefully in a couch,\nthough raptors may lurk nearby,\nthe raptors cannot help but strike them.\nOnce youthful vigor arrives,\nand movement becomes effortless,\nthough there may be joy in wandering,\nthey cannot attain the tranquility of a secluded chamber,\nand few can escape the calamities of malevolent forces.\n\nConsider the newborn babe,\nyet unaware of the union of *Yin* and *Yang* in copulation,\nits vitality ever flourishing.\nIt is evident that the original *qi* is pure and unbounded,\nwith life’s essence daily unfolding.\n\nIf one can focus their *qi* and cultivate softness akin to an infant’s first breath,\nthen they possess the essence that can be refined.\nObserve how the babe’s cries,\nendless and unceasing,\nthough they wail all day,\nnever harm the throat or larynx—\nthis is not artificial but natural,\na spontaneous utterance, unrestrained yet effortless.\nAll is *Heaven’s mechanism* in motion,\n*Heaven’s resonance* in sound,\nwithout manipulation, without contrivance—\nharmony in its utmost.\n\nUnderstanding this *original harmony* within,\none aligns with the *eternal Dao*,\nrequiring no artificial effort to correct or force,\nbut preserving its true nature,\nsettling into its fixed essence.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*“Both wise and sagely,\nto safeguard their very being,”*\n—could this be its meaning?\n\nIf not for the cultivation of *harmonious soft qi*,\nnourishing the body and mind,\nhow could one be born and grow ever more vital?\nHow could one’s *Heavenly body* be sustained without decay,\nand this be the greatest of human blessings?\n\nOnce strength and vigor arise,\n*Heaven’s heart* is disturbed by *human heart*,\nand the depletion of spirit becomes frequent.\nNow, if we take *original harmony* as the Dao,\nultimate stillness enables ultimate motion,\nand supreme softness overcomes supreme hardness.\n\nThus, one must make the *qi* serve the mind,\nensuring this *qi* returns to the state of the newborn babe,\nand not let the *qi* disturb the mind,\nlest the mind stray from *original harmony*.\nOnly then can one achieve harmony without dissipation—\nstrong indeed, and far from artificial.\nThis is not unique to the newborn babe.\n\nObserve all things:\ntheir beginning is soft and tender,\ntheir end, hard and strong.\nSoftness and tenderness are signs of life’s vitality,\nhardness and strength, portents of death’s approach.\n\nThus, when things grow strong, they age,\nnot as when things remain young, they thrive.\nLife’s Dao endures,\nwhile death’s Dao perishes.\nHence it is said:\n*“Aging is not the Dao—\nthe Dao is not to age at all.”*\nWhy not? Because aging is merely the decay of vitality.\nYet if measured by years,\neven at eighty or ninety,\none may still cultivate the Dao of eternal life,\nfor so long as a breath remains,\nthis *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,\nunfailing and complete.\n\nFor when the *qi* is first cultivated in softness,\nit is like all things bending branches and sprouting buds.\nNurture and foster it here,\nand it shall grow daily, monthly,\nuntil it returns to the root of life,\nyielding the fruit of longevity.\n\nBut when the time of *San-Yang* (late twilight) arrives,\nthings have aged and are nearing decline—\ntheir essence is no longer fit to refine into medicine.\nYet aging is not merely old age in years,\nbut the decay of the medicine’s vitality.\nIf judged by age alone,\neven at eighty or nine years,\none may still attain the Dao of unending life,\nfor so long as a breath remains,\nthis *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,\nunfailing and complete.\n\nThis is the method of cultivating the self,\ntaking the newborn babe as its model.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*“A babe moves without knowing what to do,\nwalks without knowing where to go,\nits body like a withered tree,\nits mind as cold as dead ashes—\nmisfortune does not come,\nfortune does not arrive.”*\nIf misfortune and fortune alike do not manifest,\nhow could there be human or natural calamities?\nThe lines *“poisonous insects”* and following convey this very meaning.\n\nLater, it speaks of gathering herbs and refining elixirs,\nrequiring the *newly sprouted water* of *Heaven’s One* (the first drop of dew).\nThis water is the very source of human vitality.\nLike a wheel of crimson sun,\nrising at midnight’s beginning,\nits light clear and bright,\nilluminating the vast sea;\nor like a crescent autumn moon,\nemerging in the *Geng-Zhen* direction—\nthis is when the cultivator’s *mystic pass* opens,\ntheir senses lost in boundless void,\nand such a state is attained.\n\nFor when the *qi* is first cultivated in softness,\nit is like all things bending branches and sprouting buds.\nAt this stage, nurture and foster it,\nand it shall grow daily, monthly,\nuntil it returns to the root of life,\nyielding the fruit of hardy vitality.\n\nIf one waits until the *San-Yang* phase,\nthen vitality has aged and is declining—\nits essence is no longer fit to refine into medicine.\nYet aging is not merely old age in years,\nbut the decay of the medicine’s vitality.\nIf judged by age alone,\neven at eighty or ninety,\none may still cultivate the Dao of eternal life,\nfor so long as a breath remains,\nthis *original harmony’s qi* suffices within the body,\nunfailing and complete.»\n\nThe true adept alone can pierce the *watery heaven* within—\nwhen the two currents of inner and outer *qi* merge,\nhow many would otherwise pass by unknowing.\n\nThe scholar who seeks the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir\nmust empty the heart to seek the Way,\naccumulate virtue to turn back the heavens—\nonly then will the true master manifest in response,\nand the *White Tiger’s Classic* be found.\nOtherwise, even if one enters the Dao in youth,\nthey shall grow old without attainment.\n\nWorse still, those who follow false teachers,\nstraying onto false paths—\nmany a lifetime’s vital essence wasted in the realm of beasts.\nLet the scholar take heed!\n\n**Chapter 56: The Most Noble of the World**\nThe wise do not speak; those who speak do not know.\nClose the mouth, shut the door,\ndull the sharpness, resolve the tangled,\nharmonize the light, blend with the dust—\nthis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\n\nThus, one cannot be too close nor too distant,\ncannot be too beneficial nor too harmful,\ncannot be too noble nor too base.\nTherefore, one is the most noble of the world.\n\nCommon men, when they hear a good word or see a good deed,\nimmediately chatter and boast to stir others—\npleasing for a moment, yet never turning inward to self-examination.\nConfucius said, *“Hearsay and gossip are the abandonment of virtue,”*\nand truly, he spoke no falsehood.\n\nBut the true knower of the Great Dao,\nwhen he has even a scrap of understanding,\nis too busy morning and evening with reverent caution—\nhow could he have leisure to speak?\nEven if he reviews the old and gains new insights,\nand finds a moment of intuitive understanding,\nit is his own and self-attained—\nlike one sated with food and drink,\ndrunk and full, knowing its flavor,\nyet unable to convey it to others.\n\nThose who love to speak of it\nmust surely lack something within themselves.\nAnd since virtue is one’s own virtue,\nand cultivation one’s own cultivation—\nif one truly knows, the more one conceals it,\nthe more one fears that a single word spoken lightly\nmight cause even a breath to stray,\nand thus the loss of the Way in one’s heart.\nThis is why the wise do not speak.\n\nIf one does speak, it is because they lack virtue within themselves,\ntruly knowing nothing of the Dao.\nIf they did know, why would they so casually reveal it?\nThus, those who speak prove themselves even more ignorant.\n\nMoreover, what is unspeakable is the essence,\nand what is spoken of is but dross.\nThe wise do not fail to speak—\nthey simply cannot speak.\nThose who speak do not fail to know—\nthey only grasp the surface.\n\nAs the saying goes, *“When you’ve grasped it, close your mouth.”*\nIndeed, knowing the Dao is no easy feat—\nwhy waste one’s *qi* in speech,\nor tarnish one’s spirit with idle chatter,\nboasting of talent and ability to stand out?\nSuch actions only invite contempt from the vulgar.\n\nThus, the noble Daoist seals the mouth, shuts the door,\nnurturing *qi* within;\ndulls the sharpness, resolves confusion,\nstabilizing the spirit;\nharmonizes the light, blends with the dust,\nadapting to the times, rising and falling with the world,\nas if foolish, as if drunk,\nas if slow of speech, as if mad—\nwhen the multitude is confused, I too am confused,\nneither flaunting nor opposing,\nneither clashing with myself nor defying the world.\n\nShould even a thread of pretense or ambition arise,\none cannot help but speak grandly to satisfy a moment’s pride.\nSuch actions seek either fame or gain.\nHas one not heard the *Taoist Canon*’s warning to Confucius?\n*“Those who can be fed with wine and meat,\nI will whip and beat.\nThose who can be honored with rank and wealth,\nI will insult and humiliate.”*\n\nOnly by secluding oneself to cultivate in silence,\nembracing the *original unity*, guarding the *One*,\nkeeping the spirit silent and the *qi* obscure,\nremaining tranquil and desireless,\nacting without action, doing without doing—\none cannot be too close nor too distant,\ntoo beneficial nor too harmful,\ntoo noble nor too base.\nThis is to seek within oneself, not without,\nnot seeking from others,\nfulfilling one’s nature and returning to one’s life—\nthus, one is the most noble of the world.\n\nWithin the Three Realms, only the Dao is supreme.\nI cultivate my Dao, and thus my Dao is noble—\nnothing in the world surpasses this.\nThe *Taoist Canon* says: *“Few understand me, thus I am noble.”*\nDo scholars understand this as well?\n\nThe man of the Way must not speak lightly,\nfor few in the world truly know.\nIf one indulges in idle talk,\nnot only does it harm oneself internally,\nbut it also invites external harm to others.\nThe *I Ching* says: *“If secrets are not kept, disaster follows.”*\nMany a cultivator has, through careless disclosure,\ninvited calamity and misfortune.\n\nThus, the sage keeps secrets and does not speak.\nEven if one finds a worthy listener,\none must proceed with utmost caution and testing—\nonly after repeated trials,\nswearing by heaven and earth,\nascending the platform to teach,\ndoes one dare speak without exaggeration or excess.\nThis shows the ancient masters’ practice of concealing brilliance\nand revering the Dao and heaven.\n\nThose who speak lightly know nothing.\nIf one truly knows, one is too busy with self-cultivation and verification\nto have leisure for idle talk.\nThose who speak recklessly\nare those who, even in nobility, invite their own degradation.\n\nWith my Dao and my nobility,\nI can endure from one age to ten thousand ages—\nwho in the world can surpass this?\nLet the scholar cultivate what lies within,\nmoment by moment, observing inwardly,\nlest the wind of idle speculation arise.\n\n---\n**Chapter 57: Governing the World with Rectitude**\nGovern the world with rectitude,\nemploy strategy in warfare,\nand take the world without conflict.\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBecause of this:\n\nThe world is filled with taboos and prohibitions,\nyet the people grow ever poorer;\n\n「The people abound in greed and flattery,\nand the state grows ever more corrupt;\nThe people abound in cunning and artifice,\nand strange things multiply;\nLaws and decrees become ever more explicit,\nand thieves and bandits flourish.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*\"I act without interference, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love tranquility, yet the people align with rectitude.\nI take no action, yet the people grow rich.\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"My Dao is but one thread that runs through all things.\"*\nThis means that through the Dao,\nall affairs and things of the world\nare not without its penetration and manifestation.\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"One root scatters into myriad branches,\nyet myriad branches all return to one root.\"*\nTo govern oneself and the world—\nthis is the greatest principle.\nThe Dao of governing the world\ndoes not surpass\nthe four occupations—*scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant*—\neach finding their place in life,\nand filial piety and fraternal respect—\neach following their inherent moral nature.\nThese are the daily, constant practices,\nthe great precepts of the world,\nthe eternal laws of ages past and present—\nindeed, the common Dao,\nalso the Dao of rectitude.\nWhat every person ought to fulfill\nis what every person inherently possesses as virtue.\n\nFor those who lead the people,\nthey must practice frugality in person,\nexhaust their filial kindness and benevolence for the world,\nand act with solemn dignity and measured presence.\nThey must guide with gentleness,\nrestrain with stillness,\navoid frivolous matters to strengthen their resolve,\nand let all things fall into order without effort—\none act of rectitude suffices to bring harmony,\nand naturally the winds will follow,\nthe grass will bow.\nSwift as the influence of the stars,\nthis is the way.\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Rectify the ruler, and the kingdom will be steadied.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"The world’s existence has long endured.\"*\nOrder and chaos follow in cycles,\nas they have since ancient times—\nno deviation has ever escaped this truth.\nThough in times of order, *rites and music* are employed,\nand in times of chaos, *arms and warfare* are used,\nwhen two armies face each other in battle,\nand great enemies clash,\nthe fate of the state—its safety or peril—\nand the lives of the people—birth or death—\nrest upon a single commander.\nHow could this not be of utmost importance?\n\nThough the arts of *strategy and calculation*,\nand the cunning of *clever schemes and tactical shifts*,\nare not what the *noble* esteem,\nyet to fulfill the mandate of heaven in punishing rebels,\nand to uphold great justice in consoling the people,\ndoes not bar the use of *unexpected victories and decisive tactics*.\n\nThus the *art of war* has:\n*concealed raids and covert assaults*,\n*exploiting fatigue and exhaustion*,\n*separating alliances and counter-espionage*,\n*feigning weakness to deceive*,\n*strategies as elusive as gods and spirits*—\nthese marvelous schemes.\nTo employ the *Dao of the Unexpected* in warfare,\nis to never lose a battle,\nnever fail in an assault,\nto spare the lives of the people,\nto not drain their wealth,\nand for all to long enjoy the blessings of peace—\nis this not the very essence of *taking the world without conflict*?\n\nYet to unite the mountains and rivers under one rule,\nand to gather the heavens and earth under one person—\nhow could this not involve myriad affairs?\nBut if one lets the myriad things rush in,\nwhile maintaining a composed and tranquil heart,\nnaturally one will harmonize with the heavens,\nand the heavenly will favor them;\nbelow, the people will revere them,\nand all will follow in devotion—\nthus the world can be taken without effort.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Tang and Yu* [1] *offered three cups of wine in humble deference,\nwhile the Shang and Wu* [2] *conquered with a single move of the chessboard.\"*\nThe world was not seen as strange or wondrous,\nnor was its conquest taken lightly—\nthus the heart was free of burdens,\nand its capacity matched that of the heavens and earth.\nHence, when they presided over China\nand soothed the four barbarians,\nit came naturally and without premeditation.\nThis is the Dao of governing the world.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBecause the Dao of governing the world\ndoes not go beyond governing oneself—\nthe body is like a state.\nSight, hearing, speech, and action\nmust all conform to *rites*;\nthoughts, intentions, and wisdom\nmust be steadied by *emotion/feeling*.\nInner reflections do not stray outward,\nexternal distractions do not intrude inward—\nwhen nature is settled,\nthe body attains rectitude.\nWith prolonged cultivation of stillness,\nthe natural faculties of the heart spontaneously arise.\n\nTo apply the *ordinary Dao of life*\nas the *elixir method of reversal*,\napproaching the furnace with fire—\nthis is fraught with danger.\nThe highest method is likened to warfare:\none must act in accordance with the times,\nseize opportunities as they arise,\nharvest at the proper season,\nrefine with precision in place,\ncamp in the field at the right moment,\nand defend the city with the proper strategy—\nnot failing to await the right time and favorable conditions,\nand to deploy with unexpected schemes.\n\nAs for:\n*the fire extinguished by sufficient medicine*,\n*the elixir perfected to warm the furnace*,\n*elevating the spirit of the sun* [3] *to the void realm*,\n*nurturing the immortal embryo in the unbroken chamber*—\none must still cultivate in the *spiritual chamber*,\nattending to nothing with complete detachment,\nand only then can the elixir be refined,\nthe immortality achieved.\nThis is the Dao of governing oneself,\nand it mirrors the method of governing the world.\nThus I know the Dao of governing the world\nthrough this very Dao of governing oneself.\n\nHe who takes the world\nmust do so through *non-action*,\nyet he who holds the world\nmust not rely on *excessive action*.\nOtherwise, if he enacts too many regulations,\nissues too many decrees,\nmakes the people tremble at every step,\nthey will inevitably resort to deceit and fraud,\nand affairs will fall into disarray.\nThe world abounds in prohibitions,\nyet the people grow ever poorer.\n\nGold, jade, pearls, and jewels,\ncarriages, horses, fine garments—\nthe useful tools of the people multiply.\nBut when greed arises,\nand desires cannot be satisfied,\nhow could the spirit not grow dim,\nand the *qi* not grow turbid?\n\nHonesty and simplicity are forgotten,\nwhile deceit and cunning are esteemed.\nWhen those with skill appear,\npeople love and admire them,\nand all vie to imitate their ways—\nthus strange and bizarre things\nare all drawn to the fore.\n\nAh! In the flourishing times of the *Three Dynasties*,\nthe rulers were all *divine and sage*,\nand the people were all pure and virtuous.\nLaws were established yet not enforced,\nprecepts were set yet not applied—\nthus they were called *flourishing ages*.\n\nNow, however,\nthe legal nets are stretched high and thick,\nlike a fine mesh;\nthe *five grades of punishment* are severe,\nand offenders are not spared;\nthe *three codes of law* are strict,\nand violators are executed.\nYet why do crimes multiply as laws grow stricter,\nand thieves increase as decrees become more numerous?\nIt is because *virtue/power* is insufficient to win the hearts of the people,\nand the laws are not enough to awe their resolve.\nFrom ancient times, the people’s unrest has always stemmed from\nthese very *punishments and coercive measures*—\nthis is evident since the Qin and Han.\n\nThe ancient sages said:\n*\"Heaven is honored through non-action,\nwhile man is burdened by it.\"*\nIf I uphold solemnity and simplicity,\ndo not overwhelm the people with excessive regulations,\nnor confuse the state with constant changes,\nbut instead maintain composure at the highest echelons,\nand dwell in tranquil seclusion within the deepest palaces—\nthen the people will daily improve in virtue,\nyet remain unaware of the effort.»\n\n---\n[1] *Tang and Yu*: Refers to the legendary sage-kings *Emperor Shun (Yu)* and *Emperor Yao (Tang)* of the Xia Dynasty, known for their humility and virtuous rule.\n[2] *Shang and Wu*: Refers to *King Tang of Shang* and *King Wu of Zhou*, who overthrew the tyrannical *Xia Dynasty* and *Shang Dynasty* respectively through military conquest.\n[3] *Spirit of the sun*: Refers to the *yang* spirit or *sun essence* (日精) in Daoist alchemy, symbolizing the refined, luminous energy cultivated within.\n\n「Yet with a serene and tranquil mind, one preserves profound silence and self-cultivation—\nsolely attending to sincerity in intent and rectifying the heart—\nyet who would know that rectifying oneself rectifies the court,\nrectifying officials rectifies the people,\nall arising from this stillness and composure?\n\nWhen the people are thus rectified,\neach reveres their kin and honors their elders,\nnone transgress their proper station,\nand households endure in harmony.\nThen they till the fields for sustenance,\ndig wells for drink,\nrise with the sun and rest with the night,\ntheir granaries overflowing,\ntheir lives free of want—\nand the people grow rich without knowing how.\n\nFor this arises when the ruler follows nature,\nacts without contrivance,\nand lets things unfold of their own accord.\n\nHow much more so when one maintains stillness,\nguards emptiness,\nremains undisturbed and does without action,\nsettling into the true *hun-hun wū-wū* [1],\nthat the people, moved and transformed by it,\nwill not fail to cultivate loyalty and filial piety,\nand adopt a plain, unadorned way of life.\n\nThe *Shū* says:\n*“One man of perfect virtue,\nand the myriad states stand upright.”*\nIts mechanism lies hidden in subtlety,\nits effects manifest as vast as heaven and earth.\n\nI wish those who govern to take rectifying the sovereign’s heart as their priority,\nand those who cultivate themselves to first nourish the *Tiān Jūn* [2].\n\nThis principle is already clear—\nno need for further elaboration.\n\nI envision the moment of seated meditation:\nAt first, the *yang* qi sinks to the depths of the sea,\nlike the waning of winter’s end,\nall around in silent stillness.\nWith the divine light descending,\nit is as though at the winter solstice, *yang* begins to stir—\nyet the void remains soundless,\nthe walls stark and desolate,\nunchanged as before.\n\nFrom here, the vital forces gradually revolve,\nunaware, the Three *Yangs* unfold,\nand all things return to spring—\nflowers crimson, leaves verdant,\nwaters bright, mountains clear—\nthe peak of *yang* is already manifest.\n\nHeaven’s way is thus—\nhow much more so the human body?\n\nOnly when the head tilts slightly downward,\nthe gaze softly lowered,\ndoes *yin* reach its extreme and *yang* emerge anew.\n\nThis stage differs from the earlier practice—\nno longer clinging to a fixed intent,\ncounting breaths with deliberate effort.\nOne must abandon external fire,\nhalt the internal forge,\nletting nature take its course without interference—\nlest one fall back into old habits unknowingly.\n\nThis is the art of preserving the aware mind\nto nurture the *wuwei* nature.\n\nWhen enlightenment lingers long,\nand righteousness and benevolence mature—\nwhat need remains for preservation or cultivation?\nOnly the natural order suffices.\n\nOtherwise, at the outset, without exertion,\nthe mind may rage like a wild beast or untamed steed,\nand taming it may prove difficult at first.\n\nYet when the beast and steed return of their own accord,\nas Mencius said of releasing the pig into the marshes,\none must not pursue and bind it—\nlest the lively and free become constrained and uneasy.\n\nWhat then is the method?\nThe *Yì* says:\n*“Heaven and Earth in their weaving,\ntransform all things into purity.”* [3]»\n\n---\n[1] *Hun-hun wū-wū* (浑浑噩噩): A Daoist term describing the primordial, undifferentiated state of natural spontaneity, often linked to the *Zhōu Yì* (周易) concept of *Zhēn* (真, \"the Real\").\n[2] *Tiān Jūn* (天君): The \"Celestial Sovereign\" or \"Heavenly Ruler,\" a Daoist alchemical term referring to the refined spiritual essence governing the body.\n[3] *Yì* (易): The *Yì Jīng* (易经, *Classic of Changes*), here invoking the transformative power of heaven and earth.\n\nThis *embroidering-and-fuling* qi, within the human body, is like the inner fire stopping and the outer form remaining still—undisturbed, allowing the breath to flow naturally. For those whose practice is refined, at such times, one need not consciously direct the mind; if one has not yet reached this stage, the mind of awareness must not be forgotten. If forgotten, one risks slipping into unconsciousness, where thoughts arise and vanish in endless cycles, causing the original, pure nature to be submerged beneath the waves of birth and death.\n\nThe ancient Buddhas said:\n*“To know the source of arising is to know the source of cessation.”*\nThus, through such cultivation, over time one perceives the beginning of arising and cessation, and again, over time, the beginning of non-thought—then it is attained.\n\nAs for the teachings of the *Huángtíng* [Yellow Court], they lie in neither existence nor non-existence, neither within nor without; yet they are also within the colored body, yet not within the colored body. Where, then, is this wondrous secret?\n\nIt is what the ancients called *“concentrating the spirit in the void, merging the qi in the boundless.”*\nTo concentrate the spirit in the void and merge the qi in the boundless is like dwelling in the *dantian*, yet not fixating the gaze inward to stare, nor forcing the spirit-qi to cluster within. Only by concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài* [navel region], not far from the flesh and skin—this is the meaning of *“neither within nor without.”*\n\nWith intent focused here, one feels the breath at the nostrils cease, while the *dantian*’s qi rolls and churns at the juncture of inner and outer, knotting into a mass. One then sees the *embroidering-and-fuling*, the *hun-hun wū-wū*—the boundless, lively, and unrestrained movement, as it ebbs and flows, truly merging with Heaven’s primordial qi in seamless unity. Life’s essence, life’s qi, and life’s spirit all arise here, not far from Heaven.\n\nThis is the meaning of *“merging the qi in the boundless.”*\nThe ancients called it *“primordial qi,”* *“fetal breathing,”* *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels.”*—what else could it be?\n\nThis *primordial qi* is the undifferentiated, formless, nameless, and boundless *hun-hun wū-wū*—a single, pure breath. As for *fetal breathing*, when a person first receives breath in the womb, the body is nourished there before the mouth and nostrils open—how else could breath be taken? Only this *qìhài*’s qi, connecting with the mother’s navel-wheel, allows growth to unfold. When the child emerges with a cry, this qi then circulates through the nostrils, each establishing its own *qián-kūn* [heaven-earth]. My demonstration shows the *qìhài*’s qi interfacing with the external Heavenly breath—neither within nor without, *embroidering-and-fuling* in fusion, blending into one—this is returning to the initial moment of receiving breath, reconnecting with the mother’s qi. This is *fetal breathing*.\n\nAs for *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels,”* it means the True Person’s breath is stored deeply and extended subtly—unseen, unheard, untouchable, profound and sealed, like breath reaching the soles of the feet. Though the breath of the nostrils can be used, it must follow its natural course; one must not rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation. If one uses only this breath without concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài*—one inch and three *fēn* below the navel—failing to find this void within, to draw Heaven’s breath into the boundless, the clear and turbid will remain intermixed, and the elixir cannot be forged.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*“Heaven’s single true breath gives birth to man—\nthis breath is neither mouth nor nostril,\nnor the knowing, moving soul.”*\nThey also said:\n*“The Mysterious Female’s gate few know—\ndo not wastefully act through mouth and nostrils.\nThough you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand years,\nhow will you grasp the Golden Rooster and the Hare?”*\nFrom these words alone, it is clear: *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Female”*—this lies between the *dantian* and the flesh, one inch and three *fēn* below the navel, where the vapors condense into a unified whole.\n\nThose who study the Dao—whether during tea or meals, in speech or social exchange—should subtly focus a little intent on this void within, naturally merging the qi in the boundless. One will then perceive the true qi stirring, in a wonder beyond naming. Yet in this breath-work, awareness does not enter inward, and the *kǎn* [water] naturally clarifies.\n\nThis is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages. I now reveal it plainly—later scholars must not dismiss it as mere words.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Calamity and Fortune Intertwined**\n\nWhen governance is *mèn-mèn* [dim and indistinct],\nthe people are *chún-chún* [pure and sincere].\nWhen governance is *chá-chá* [sharp and scrutinizing],\nthe people are *quē-quē* [deficient and weary].\n\nCalamity and fortune lean upon each other;\nfortune and calamity lie hidden within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nPerhaps there is no fixed principle.\n\nWhat is upright becomes strange;\nwhat is good becomes ominous.\nThe people’s confusion has long endured.\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not pierce,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nHeaven and Earth act without intent yet transform and nourish;\nthe sovereign rules without action yet achieves harmony.\nThis is the Dao of *wuwei*—\nthe great principle and law by which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,\nharmonized the world, and ordered all things.\n\nThe ruler governs the myriad people,\nregulating all beneath Heaven—\nnothing surpasses this.\nIf one resorts to *youwei* [action],\ngovernance is not true governance,\nrule is not true rule.\nThough literature may flourish and achievements gleam,\none cannot achieve the *xīxī yùyù* [harmonious and radiant] age of shared joy and prosperity.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* [Supreme Sage] said:\n*“Governance is rectification”—*\nrectifying others through one’s own rectitude.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who ruled the people\nestablished human norms and ordered Heaven’s patterns,\nacting as if knowing yet not knowing,\nacting as if acting yet not acting—\nletting Heaven’s natural impulses move freely.\nThey never forced clever schemes,\ninvented measures, or promulgated laws.\nYet through a single virtue, they resonated in harmony,\ntransmitting meaning beyond words.\n\nThus its governance is dim and unassuming,\nas though simple and unknowing.\nYet the people’s trust and sincerity\nremain pure and unchanging,\nretaining the ancient virtue of old.\nThe ruler governs through non-action,\nthe people transform through non-action—\nruler and ruled alike rest in the tranquil Heaven,\noh, how splendid this peace!\n\nIf the ruler instead strives with vigor,\nexhausting effort to govern,\nrooting out wickedness while elevating the worthy,\nrecording even minor virtues and punishing grave offenses,\nwith rewards and punishments as clear as ice and mirror,\nand oversight as stern as divine judgment—\nthen governance becomes meticulous,\nno one escapes its scrutiny—\nyet is this not also worthy of weight?\n\nBut when the ruler demands excessive precision,\nthe people respond with cunning schemes,\nboasting their petty cleverness.\nThe ruler acts, the people imitate—\nhow difficult it is to govern the people’s hearts!\n\nIf the source is not purified above,\nthe root cannot be rectified below.\nNon-action is the pristine truth of the primal Heaven,\naction is the contrived artifice of later cultivation.\nThe effects of dimness and meticulousness are thus pure and mixed.\n\nThis is clear: one principle alone—\nto split it is error.\n\nBefore Heaven’s *Tàijí* divided,\nbefore purity was split,\nthere was no name for yin and yang,\nno distinction of good and evil.\nThe *Yì* says:\n*“Simple, thus easily known;\nfrugal, thus easily followed.”*\nThis is why such governance can endure.\n\nBut when the primal *Tàipú* is incomplete,\nwhen yin and yang span beginning to end,\nwhen misfortune and fortune alternate—\nmisfortune within fortune, fortune within misfortune—\nthis is how calamity and blessing cycle endlessly.\n\nThus action is not necessarily unvirtuous,\nbut when things reach their limit, they reverse.\nThe interplay of yin and yang is inherent.\nWho can know the ultimate end and preserve true governance?\n\nMoreover, when rectitude returns, it becomes eccentric;\nwhen virtue reverses, it becomes ominous.\nNon-action’s governance is pure as Heaven.\nAction’s governance is mixed with human contrivance.\nMixed with human contrivance—\nrectitude contains eccentricity, virtue contains ominousness.\nIts mechanisms arise from subtle beginnings,\nits responses unfold through influence,\nits momentum is relentless.\n\nNo wonder deceit and guile become habitual,\ningrained until none awaken.\nThis has been so for ages.\n\nThus the Sage governs the world,\nrooting governance in the Way of non-action,\nrectifying himself to transform others.\nThe square is square without knowing its squareness—\nperhaps it masters adaptability without rigid rules?\nThe austere is austere without knowing its austerity—\nperhaps it blends with the common, its light unbroken?\nAt times, uprightness is not blind compliance,\nnor is it unchecked indulgence.\nUpholding principle in action, never daring excess—\nits rigid yet revered norms are truly awe-inspiring.\n\nAs for transforming all beings,\nits benevolence extends to the four quarters,\nlike stars and clouds in radiant display,\nyet it hides itself, never flaunting its brilliance.\nHow does it vanish its traces and silence its voice?\n\nThis is non-action as essence,\nnaturalness as function—\ngoverning through desire, applying principle.\nWhen the winds of the four directions stir,\nwho could fail to join in harmonious transformation,\nto wander together in the ancient Heaven?\n\nIs this not so?\n\nThe Dao is called the Great Dao,\nthe elixir is called the Golden Elixir—\nboth are nameless, formless.\n\nIn Heaven, it is the clear and empty *qi*;\nin man, it is the void and natural.\nFrom beginning to end of cultivation,\nnothing transcends this.\n\nIf one knows the boundless and indistinct\nis the root of the Great Dao,\nthe origin of the Golden Elixir—\nand from the utmost stillness and sincerity,\nnurtures the undifferentiated, the unknowing,\nthe thoughtless and desireless true essence—\nthen one’s nature, emotions, vital essence, and spirit\nare all things of the primal *Tàihé* *qi*.\nWith this to cultivate the Dao, the Dao is complete;\nwith this to refine the elixir, the elixir is perfected—\nwhat strange danger or peril remains?\n\nBut if one ignores non-action as foundation,\nfixating only on action as achievement,\nthen knowledge never ceases,\ndisturbance only multiplies—\nhow could one avoid falling into the later, shaped, and chaotic?\n\nThe Supreme Sage likens governance to the Dao,\ncompares the people to the body.\nCultivating the Dao through primal non-action\nforges an unbreakable golden body;\ncultivating the Dao through later awareness\nhow could it avoid duality of spirit?\nEven if refined well,\nit is but a preserved corpse—\nhow could it transcend yin and yang,\nescape birth and death,\nand become an immortal for all ages?\n\nWorse still, if one falls into action,\nthe *Tàijí* divides and yin and yang arise,\nyin and yang separate and good and evil emerge—\nthen calamity and blessing alternate.\n\nWho knows that the ultimate attainment of cultivation,\nthough it may require some action,\nmust arise from action within non-action,\nfrom function within non-function,\nonly then avoiding extremes?\n\nMencius said: *“Act, yet do not force.”*\nThis is the essence of cultivation.\n\nThe human heart—\nwhen one aspect moves, another stirs;\nwhen one aspect is yin, another is yang.\nEvil and rectitude, good and bad—\nthey cycle and interweave without end.\nThus rectitude contains eccentricity,\nvirtue contains ominousness.\nOnly in undivided oblivion,\nwhere no distinction of rectitude and eccentricity exists,\ncan good and evil vanish.\nOtherwise, rectitude returns as eccentricity,\nvirtue reverses as ominousness.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*“Heaven honors non-action as supreme,\nman burdens himself with action.”*\nThus, when action arises,\nit must return to non-action\nto avoid the disaster of overturning the elixir.\n\nAlas, the common folk—\nspeak of the elixir, and they cling to the *dāntián*;\nfixate on the River Vehicle’s path,\nconfined within the body—\ntheir failure to awaken to non-action’s essence\nhas endured for ages.\n\nOnly the sage understands the Dao of cultivation.\nThough there are fire and timing, medicines and elixirs,\ndragon-tiger pairings, male-female unions,\ncauldrons, furnaces, zithers, and swords—\nall these names and forms are but the traps and snares for fish and rabbits:\nuse them to catch the fish and rabbits,\nbut once the fish and rabbits are in hand,\nforget the traps and snares.\nIf one clings to names and forms,\nthey are not the Dao.\n\nThus, square when square,\nhonest when honest,\nstraight when straight,\nbright when bright—\nyet all must return to non-action,\nto doing nothing while doing,\nto merging into the boundless void.\n\nLet the student take the Dao of natural non-action as essence.\nOnly when essence is established may action follow.\nEven with action, it remains non-action.\n\nDo you know?\nDo you believe?\n\n**Chapter 59: Eternal Life and Longevity**\nTo govern humanity and serve Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nOnly frugality is early cultivation.\nEarly cultivation is called accumulating virtue.\nAccumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.\nNothing unconquered means its limits are unknown;\nunknown limits mean one can possess a realm.\nPossessing a realm’s foundation means eternal life and longevity.\n\nThe way to govern humanity is the way to serve Heaven—\nHeaven and humanity are fundamentally one *qi*.\nThus, governing humanity is the means to serve Heaven,\nand serving Heaven does not go beyond governing humanity.\nDo not say Heaven’s Dao is distant—\nit dwells within humanity’s nearest path.\nIf you do not know Heaven’s Dao,\nfirst observe human nature.\nTo exhaust human affairs is to fulfill Heaven’s Dao.\nThough high and low may seem distant,\nif the people are settled, Heaven’s will is unified.\n\nIts essence lies in prioritizing agriculture and roots,\nteaching the people to till and sow first.\nFor the people are the foundation of the state,\nand food is the people’s Heaven.\nWhen frugality is practiced,\nclothing and food are abundant,\nand families are secure.\nAs Mencius said:\n*“Cultivate the five grains,\nand when the grains ripen, the people thrive.”*\nAgain he said:\n*“When the sage governs the world,\nmaking grain and fire as accessible as water,\nhow could the people fail to be benevolent?”*\nThus, those in power must urgently practice frugality,\nso the people may take joy in their work,\nlive in peace,\nand nurture life while honoring death.\n\nBefore they even see or hear,\ntheir hearts are already served,\nand they willingly turn toward it,\nas if feasting on the finest sacrifices.\nThis is virtue cultivated without speech,\nelevated without proclamation.\n\nEven with three years of labor and one of rest,\nor nine years of labor and three of rest,\nwith abundant millet and sorghum,\nbrewing wine and *li* for offerings,\nbestowing upon ancestors and conducting rites—\nvirtue accumulates layer upon layer.\nWho else but this could achieve it?\n\nThus, the enlightened Heaven is reopened,\nand boundless blessings are bestowed.\nNaturally, the weak are protected,\nthe ignorant guided,\nthe chaotic subdued,\nand the reckless preserved—\nnothing they confront is unconquered.\nTheir advance is unstoppable,\nno foe dares to resist.\nNot only neighboring states bow in awe,\nbut distant lands also send envoys with offerings.\nEastward and westward, northward and southward,\ntheir influence spreads without end—\nwho can fathom its limits?\n\nWithout limits, the Imperial Dao flourishes,\nthe realm is unshakable,\nand the state is secured.\nAs the *Han Shu* says:\n*“The Yellow River like a belt,\nTai Mountain like a whetstone.\nThe state endures in eternal peace,\nlove extending to descendants.”*\nThis is unerring truth.\n\nWhen a person governs a state,\nthey have the means to obtain it—\nand what is that means?\nThe *mother-qi* of the state.\nWithout mother-qi, how could one obtain the state?\nThis is the fundamental truth all should urgently discuss.\nBefore possessing a state, one must seek the mother;\nhaving possessed it, one must cherish the mother.\nA state’s mother is like a tree’s root,\nwater’s source—\nenduring and unceasing.\n\nThis is the way of governing the world,\nparallel to governing the self.\nThose who cultivate the Dao\ncan embrace unity, still the breath, and harmonize the spirit,\nfirst seeking the *mercury child* to find the *lead mother*,\nthen nurturing the *lead mother* with the *mercury child*,\nuntil lead and mercury merge,\nreturning to the original,\nreverting to the Primordial.\nThis is the way of deep roots and firm foundations—\neternal life and longevity.\n\nThus, the ordinary becomes sage,\nand humanity becomes Heaven.\n\nThe way to govern the self is no different from governing the world.\nThis is exhausting human affairs to fulfill Heaven’s Dao—\n*“Heaven and humanity are one *qi*,\nmutually responsive and unified.\nYang descends from the void,\nembracing me as master.”*\nIts Dao is not beyond emptiness,\nits function akin to tilling and sowing.\n\nFirst, nourish, preserve, and inspect.\nThen, use nature to govern emotions.\nWhen water and fire blend,\nkan and li unite,\npre-Heaven *qi* moves,\ncirculating the Microcosmic Orbit—\n*“When Heaven and Earth’s union ceases,\na single point descends to the Yellow Court.”*\n\nThis draws the *kan*’s overflow into *li*’s void,\nsecuring the foundation of life—\nthe work of human and immortal is complete.\n\nThis is like the frugal ruler clearing land and planting,\npruning and weeding before sowing the five grains.\nThen, taking the *li*’s yin essence,\nlowering it into the *kan*’s gate,\nmerging the *kan*’s yang *qi* with the *li*’s yin essence,\nforming a family within the *dāntián* as medicine—\n*“Where others lack, I possess;\nwhere others are empty, I am full.”*\n\nUntil true lead emerges within,\nusing yang lead to subdue yin mercury—\nits flighty nature no longer flees;\nthen using yin lead to nourish yang lead—\nits sinking nature no longer sinks.\nAs the *Awakening to Reality* says:\n*“The golden cauldron seeks to retain the cinnabar mercury,\nthe jade pool first descends the water-silver.”*\n\nWhen lead and gold float and rise,\nlike dust in sunlight scattering,\nthe residual yang outside *kan* is exhausted,\nreturned to *li*’s palace.\nThen the private mercury and recognition within *li*\nare both dissolved,\nrestoring the pure yang elixir—\ncapable of ascending to the Han,\nsoaring through the heavens,\nforming the divine embryo,\ncompleting the immortal child.\n\n「Although, its practice is not easily attained! At first, one must cultivate the will to nourish the *qi*—\nlike a farmer tilling the fields,\nwith no lack of toil and hardship.\nYet in the end, the spirit is tranquil and the *qi* is steady.\n\nWithin, the single principle is undivided and complete;\nwithout, one adapts to the times and remains centered.\nThis is not done by chance once,\nbut aligns with the Great Dao/Way.\n\nThrough its refining nature and cultivating life,\none has long prepared to serve as a guest to the later-born—\nthus severing all entanglements,\nleaving not a thread behind,\nfulfilling the human path to merge with the Heavenly *virtue/power*.\n\nLike a state’s foundation,\none preserves sincere integrity and profound benevolence,\ndeep compassion and abundant *virtue/power*,\nwhich enter the people’s hearts,\npenetrating to the marrow and permeating the flesh—\nthe accumulation of such *virtue/power*,\nits weight and depth,\nknow no bounds.\n\nFrom this point onward,\nnothing remains unremoved within oneself,\nnothing unmastered by oneself—\nHeaven’s embrace grows serene and settled,\nwalking the Five Phases with ease and composure.\n\nWhether facing change or constancy,\none naturally follows one’s inherent station,\nfinding fulfillment in every place—\n*\"No matter where one goes, one finds oneself at ease.\"*\n\nIf this is so,\nthen using it to refine nature exhausts nature,\nusing it to cultivate life establishes life.\n\nIn the boundless void where no traces remain,\nall phenomena stand complete and manifest—\ntruly, there is one whose depths are unknown.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* says:\n*\"Look inward to the heart—\nthe heart has no heart.\nLook outward to the body—\nthe body has no body.\nLook far to all things—\nthings have no things.\nThe emptiness of emptiness—\nemptiness is not emptiness.\nThe nothingness of nothingness—\nnothingness is not nothingness.\"*\nThose who can awaken to this\nmay transmit the sacred Dao/Way.\n\nThis is the *\"body transcends itself yet remains\"*—\nthe body is like a state.\nJust as a sovereign rules without action,\nand thus stands upright before the people\nto possess the state and the world,\nso too with the *yin* essence within oneself,\nlong mingled with the father’s essence and mother’s blood—\nwithout the *yang* *qi* of the Primordial Heaven,\nit cannot generate or grow of its own accord.\n\nIndeed, the *yin* essence of later birth\noriginally stems from the Primordial Heaven’s *yang*—\nyet the *yin* essence is hard to stabilize,\nand emotions/desires are easily unsettled.\nWithout the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s external, refined *yang*,\none cannot forge it into the elixir,\nnor achieve enduring life and deathlessness.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The mother of a lasting state,\ncan endure forever.\"*\nOnly the Sage,\nwith true *yin* and true *yang*,\nmerges the two *qi* into one,\nrefining a single grain of millet—\ncalled the *golden elixir*,\n*true lead*,\nor the *White Tiger’s First Scripture*—\nits essence is none other than the Primordial Heaven’s single *qi*.\n\nThrough ceaseless refining within the colored body—\nendless melting and washing,\ngradually extracting and condensing,\nsometimes simmering, sometimes refining—\nthe *golden elixir* is formed,\nits radiance clear and distinct—\nthose who *\"steal the *qi* of Heaven and Earth to use as elixir mother\"* are such.\n\nThis is the path of deep roots and firm foundations,\nof enduring life and prolonged vision.\n\nWhen the refined *yang* of Heaven and Earth\nis merged with one’s true *qi*,\nforming the sacred embryo,\nthe ancient immortals spoke of:\n*\"The Primordial Heaven’s single *yang* first moves,\nstirring a single drop of one’s own mercury to greet it.\"*\n\nThus, inner contact and outer stimulation yield form,\nouter contact and inner resonance yield spirit—\nlike a magnet drawing iron,\nnaturally aligning and joining.\n\nThe mercury child seeks the water palace\nto find the lead mother;\nonce the mother is obtained,\nit then relies on the child.\n\nChild and mother in harmony,\nclustered in the central palace,\nthe Great Elixir is formed,\nand the Sage-Immortal is realized.\n\nThe beginning and end of elixir refining,\nthe Great Dao/Way has already fully revealed.\nScholars must carefully ponder and discern—\nthough the traces and symbols may seem alike,\ntheir subtleties differ greatly.\n\nYet without the right time,\none cannot know;\nwithout a true teacher’s guidance,\none cannot understand.\n\nThis requires the convergence of\nHeaven’s *yuan* (缘),\nEarth’s *yuan* (缘),\nand human *yuan* (缘)—\nonly when the three *yuan* align\ncan one enter the chamber and begin the work.\n\nLater scholars must first\naccumulate sincerity and cultivate *virtue/power*,\nempty themselves to seek a teacher—\nthus may the three *yuan* converge and entry be made.\nDo not rejoice at mere attainment\nand lose the resolve to ascend.\n\nInstead, take a vow of unwavering devotion,\npress forward with single-minded effort—\nprogress may be slow,\nbut persistence is key.\n\nAt the very start,\nthere is no crack to enter,\nno opening to seize—\nit is like chewing on wax pills,\ntasteless and insipid.\n\nZhūzǐ says:\n*\"To study, one must be resolute and tireless,\nenduring hardship with patience.\"*\n\nLong toil, and eventually,\nthe bitter turns sweet,\nthe stifled yields to joy—\nthe Dao advances, and the heart finds its gain.\n\nAt this juncture,\nwhen *principle* and *desire* ride together,\nand Heaven and man wage war,\nit is most difficult to act.\n\nIts advance and retreat,\nlie at this critical pass.\nIf this pass is breached,\nthen the beauty of the ancestral temple,\nthe abundance of officials,\nand the endless enjoyment of rewards—\nas Confucius said—\nshall be attained.\n\nNever falter or grow weak,\nfor if one’s own spirit dwindles,\nthe gate of entry will forever remain closed.\n\nMost importantly,\nempty the heart,\nenlarge the will,\nstir the spirit,\nand cultivate *virtue/power* and achievement,\nrefine nature and establish life.\n\nKnow that this is\nthe greatest of all matters between Heaven and Earth—\nwithout immense strength,\nit cannot be accomplished.\n\nIn days past, there was a couplet:\n*\"Brace iron shoulders to bear the Dao’s duty,\nfree stiff hands to craft the words.\"*\n\nAh!\nEven in the world,\na single talent or skill—\nthe modest pursuit of scholarly fame—\nrequires toil and endurance,\nusing all one’s true spirit\nto achieve great deeds,\nbefore Heaven’s silent blessing can be earned—\nhow much more so for the Dao,\nthe greatest of all matters!\n\nThus the Buddha said:\n*\"I descended to this realm for the sake of the great *dharma* and great *yuan* (因缘),\nand so do I now.\"*\n\nScholars, upon meeting a true teacher,\nmust with true heart and sincere intent\nembody my words—\nonly then may they be counted\namong the great men of this world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**\nRuling a great state is like cooking fresh delicacies.\nApplying the Dao/Way to the world,\nits *ghosts* are not numinous.\nNot because its *ghosts* are not numinous,\nbut because its spirit does not harm others.\nNot because its spirit does not harm others,\nbut because the Sage also does not harm others.\n\nThus, when two do not harm each other,\n*virtue/power* naturally returns and merges.\n\nThe Dao/Way,\nis the shared principle of all under Heaven.\nUsing this principle to cultivate oneself,\nis the same as using it to govern the world.»\n\n「I too am thus. If scholars, having met a true teacher,\nmust with true heart and sincere intent\nembody my words—\nonly then may they be counted\namong the great men of this world.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: Two Do Not Harm Each Other**\n\nTo wish to establish oneself while establishing others,\nto wish to attain while attaining for others—\nwithout waiting for a shift in thought,\nwithout delay in time,\nhow easy and simple it is!\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* (太上) says:\n“Ruling a great state is like cooking fresh delicacies.”\n\nWhen a state is vast,\nits affairs must be complex,\nits people numerous.\nIf one does not grasp the Dao/Way,\nthen it will inevitably become chaotic and convoluted—\nlike trying to unravel disordered silk,\nthe more one attempts to govern,\nthe more tangled it grows.\n\nOnly by applying the Dao/Way,\nthe shared principle of all under Heaven,\nto cultivate one’s own person\nand guide the multitude—\nits logic flowing through all,\nits *qi* permeating universally—\ndoes one find the path most convenient.\n\nOtherwise, if one merely relies on\nlaws and decrees,\nprohibitions and schemes,\ntactics and calculations,\nand summons the world under such rules—\nthen in daylight, resentment festers among the people,\nand their hearts grow deceitful and multifarious;\nin darkness, the *ghosts* (鬼) are provoked,\nand calamities—disasters and plagues—\npile up without end.\n\nFor the people are the masters of *ghosts* and *spirits* (神).\nWhen rulers exact harsh levies,\nindulge in tyranny,\nand spread their venomous influence,\nleaving the people without refuge—\nthen *ghosts* and *spirits*,\ntoo, find no attachment,\nand must rise in rebellion,\nbringing ruin and sickness.\nThus did the *stone spirit* (石言) appear in *Jìn* (晉),\nthe *comet* (彗) in *Qí* (齐),\nthe *serpent battle* (蛇斗) in *Zhèng* (郑),\n*Bó Yǒu* (伯有) become a scourge,\n*Shēn Shēng* (申生) descend as a *ling* (灵) spirit,\nthe *Two Young Men* (二竖) fell into grave illness from dreams,\n*Yǒu Shēn* (有莘) descended and *Guó* (虢) perished—\nall these were acts of *ghosts* and *spirits*,\nyet they arose because the ruler lacked the Dao/Way.\n\nFor those who govern the people,\nif they truly cultivate the Dao/Way in themselves,\nand transform the people with the Dao/Way—\nthough the *ghosts* (鬼) are *yīn* (阴) *qi*,\nwhen they find their proper refuge,\neven the most stubborn *ghosts* (鬼) will willingly follow.\nThe people will have no grievances,\nand the *ghosts* will bring no calamities.\nMountains and rivers will not crumble,\nand crops will not be plagued by monstrous anomalies.\nIn harmony and brightness,\none may sit and bask in the blessings of peace.\n\nThe *Shū* (书) says:\n*“Our ancient sovereigns,\nwhen they diligently cultivated their virtue/power,\nthere were no celestial calamities,\nand the mountain rivers, ghosts and spirits,\nall remained tranquil.”*\n\nThis is not because the *ghosts* are not numinous!\nFor *jīnglì wāngliáng* (魑魅魍魉),\nas well as mountain spirits and water monsters,\nall depend on some foundation,\nand have their fixed offerings.\nWhen left to their natural course,\nthey meddle in nothing.\nThough they have spirit,\nthey have no means to act—\neven if they act,\nhow could they ever prevail?\n\nThus, *yīn* and *yáng* (阴阳),\npeople and *ghosts*,\nall frolic together\nbeneath the radiant Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth—\nhow could there be any harm to people?\n\nNor is it because the *spirits* do not harm others.\nIt is because the Sage,\nwith the Dao/Way in hand,\nlacks the scheming wisdom of the petty,\nnor the ostentatious benevolence of the self-aggrandizing.\nThey guard their own person with reverence,\ncherish the natural bonds of humanity,\nhold fast to respect,\nact with simplicity,\navoiding all unnecessary entanglements—\nnot a single particle\never harms another.\n\nIt lies in the harmony of *yīn* and *yáng*,\nwhereby people and things flourish,\nand in the grandeur of rites and sacrifices,\nwhereby *ghosts* and *spirits* find peace.\nIn the realm of the unseen,\nthe two do not encroach upon each other.\nThus the world naturally submits\nto the Sage’s virtue/power and returns to it.\n\nAh! The Dao/Way of *non-action* (無為),\nboth near and far—\ntaken from the self,\nextended to all things—\nis the way to rule the world,\nand also the way to refine\nthe *Great Elixir of Return* (大還之丹).\n\nIn a world of great peace,\nwhen governance reaches its highest principle,\nand the realm is flourishing—\nthe ruler acts without action,\nand the world transforms without coercion.\nAll *ghostly* mischief and *spiritual* malevolence\nvanish without trace,\nnot because they are destroyed,\nbut because they are naturally dissolved\nby the Dao/Way of *non-action*,\nand their schemes collapse\nwithout any means to act.\nDroughts, floods, plagues, and epidemics\nfind no foothold.\n\nIn the human body,\nthe *ghost* is the *yīn* (阴) aspect—\nstill, silent, and unaware.\nThe *spirit* is the *yáng* (阳) aspect—\ndynamic, active, and purposeful.\n\nThe great practitioner,\nwith a mind that encompasses all things yet remains without mind,\nand emotions that respond to all yet are without emotion—\n*yīn* within *yáng*,\n*yáng* within *yīn*—\nstillness without stillness,\nmovement without movement.\nMovement and stillness\ninteract in their functions;\n*yīn* and *yáng*\nmutually sustain each other.\n\nIt is not that awareness is utterly absent\nor that action is entirely non-existent.\nRather, within *non-awareness* (無覺),\nthere is true awareness;\nwithin *non-action* (無為),\nthere is true action.\n\nWhen it says *“its ghosts are not numinous”*,\nit does not mean they are dull and lifeless.\nFor the awareness within *non-awareness*\nis the true and equal awakening;\nthe action within *non-action*\nis but the natural unfolding\nof Heaven’s will.\nHow could it compare\nto the false pretenses of those with awareness,\nor the rigid adherence of those with action,\nwhich only harm the original elixir?\n\nWhen it says *“its spirit does not harm others”*,\nit is not that the *spirit* does not harm others,\nbut that the Dao/Way of *non-action*\nnurtures the innate purity of human life,\nthe ceaseless vitality of *yīn* and *yáng*,\nthe unending sincerity,\nand the complete embodiment of all things.\n\nThough there be creation and destruction,\nin truth there is no loss or gain;\nthough there be fullness and emptiness,\nin essence there is no increase or decrease.»\n\n「This is what is meant by *unperturbed and unalarmed*—\nfree from worry and care.\nHow could it harm others?\n\nIt is not that the Sage does not harm others,\nbut rather that with the *vital impulse* of life’s essence,\nthey restore the original purity of existence;\nthat with the *harmonious trance* of 三昧 (*sāṃdhi/samādhi*),\nthey cultivate the *free-flowing elixir* of self-mastery.\nOnce the *Divine Fire* refines,\nthe spirits wail and demons shriek,\nthe malevolent forces retreat in terror—\nthe True Person emerges.\nThis is called *“mutual non-injury”*—\nwho could say it is unfit?\n\nBoth Heaven and Earth\nreverence their virtue.\nAh! The interplay of *dark* and *bright* (*yīn* and *míng*),\nnot the *virtue/power* of spirits alone,\nhow could it reach such heights?\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One: The Great Should Descend**\nThe great realm descends to the lesser—\nthe *pivot of the world*, the *receptive mother* of the world.\nThe *receptive mother* ever takes the *vigorous* (*yáng*) through stillness,\nand stillness as its descent.\nThus, the great realm descends to the small realm,\nand the small realm is taken by the great;\neither descending to take,\nor descending while taken.\nThe great realm seeks only to *enfold* others,\nthe small realm seeks only to *submit* to others.\nWhen both attain their desires,\nthe great is rightly suited to descend.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* speaks of *cultivating the Dao/Way and refining the elixir*—\nall must be guided by *gentleness*,\nand anchored in *stillness*.\nThough it may be said that *gentleness* is useless weakness,\nand *seclusion* hard to achieve,\nyet at the outset of *meditative sitting*,\nmovement must arise from stillness,\nand *rigidity* from *gentleness*—\nonly then is the true Dao/Way revealed.\n\nThe analogy *“the great realm descends”* speaks of water,\nwhich has both ascent and descent—\nthe water above must flow downward\nbefore it finds its end.\nIf the great realm humbles itself,\nwithout a trace of arrogance or pretense,\nit will be revered by all under Heaven—\njust as the lowlands gather streams from every direction,\nso too its influence is inevitable.\n\nThus it is called *“the pivot of the world.”*\nWhen the world’s realms converge,\nit is because they can descend.\nDescending, their *qi* is most *gentle*—\nnot the utmost *rigidity*.\nWhat is more *vigorous* than the *vigorous* (*yáng*)?\nWhat is more *gentle* than the *receptive* (*yīn*)?\nThe *vigorous* is *yáng*, the *rigid*;\nthe *receptive* is *yīn*, the *gentle*.\nIt is fitting that the *vigorous* (*yáng*) should overcome the *gentle* (*yīn*).\nYet why does the *receptive* often prevail over the *vigorous*?\nIt is because the *receptive* possesses *stillness*.\n\nThe ancients said, *“Stillness governs movement”—*\ntheir words hold no flaw,\njust as descent follows ascent—\nits force is inevitable.\n\nMuch less so for the great realm,\nwhich lowers itself to *nurture* the lesser,\nand *virtues* itself to *uplift* others—\ncould there ever be a realm\nthat does not come to *revere* or *submit*?\n\nThe great realm is the model of *high virtue*,\nwhile *stillness* is the foundation of descent.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nthe great realm descends to the small realm—\nlike *Tāng* humbling *Gě Bó*,\nultimately gaining *Gě’s* land,\nsoothing and possessing it—\nor the small realm submits to the great—\nlike *Gōujī* humbling the *King of Wú*,\neventually gaining *Wú’s* dominion,\nencompassing and holding it—\nsometimes the great realm does not assert its greatness\nbut adopts the small realm’s posture,\nthus taking the small realm as easily as turning a palm—\nsometimes the small realm rests content in its smallness\nand serves the great realm,\nthus taking the great realm as effortlessly as picking up a blade of grass.\n\nDiscussing the mighty realms,\nthey truly serve as the standard for all nations,\nyet in *soothing and guiding* them there is method,\nand in *encompassing with kindness* there is strategy.\nThey do not seek to *annex* all under Heaven,\nto unify the mountains and rivers—\nrather, they seek to *enfold* the small realms,\nmaking the world one family.\nOnly those with *great virtue* surpassing others\ncan achieve such *tranquil inclusiveness*.\n\nIt is fitting that the world should converge in *Rén* (*benevolence/heart*),\nand all directions submit to *Mìng* (*command/ordain*).\nThe petty, insignificant realms—\nall equal in their *feudal apportionments*,\nas *vassal ministers* offering frequent tributes,\nrushing forward in fear of falling behind—\nthey do not desire to *elevate themselves* and *take humiliation*,\nnor to *preserve the ancestral temples* and *extend their longevity*—\nonly to *submit to others* and *ensure their own survival*,\nto prolong the *lasting breaths* of the people.\nYet even this requires *great wisdom* surpassing others,\nto *restrain themselves* and *descend*—\nonly then can they be *loved and revered* by the people,\nand *Mìng* (*command/ordain*) come to them.\n\nMoreover, humans must have *aspirations* and *desires*—\nnow the great realm desires to *enfold* others,\nthe small realm desires to *submit*—\nboth attain their desires,\none through *Rén* (*benevolence/heart*), one through *wisdom*,\nyet neither falls into the *private* pursuits of human desire—\nthis proves that great and small realms alike\nfollow their *natural course*,\nrest in their *allotted roles*,\nand none dare *transgress* their duties.\n\nThough the small realm descends by nature,\nits principle is fixed—\nthe great realm should *especially* descend,\nonly then does the *single person* stand erect,\nand the world find its *reliance*.\n\nThe governance of the age is thus—\nhow much more so in governing one’s body?\n*“The great realm”* is an analogy for *original spirit*—\n*“descending”* refers to *spirit-light* descending to illuminate the *elixir field*,\nwhile *yīn* essence also descends into the *elixir field*.\nWhen the *Divine Fire* refines,\nthe essence transforms into *qi*—\nthis is the *elixir field*, the *original pass*.\n\nThe human body’s *total support* (*zǒngchí*),\nthe *convergence* of the *Five Qi*,\nthe *condensation* of the *Three Flowers*—\nall refine into the *elixir embryo*,\nemerge as *spirit* and enter *sainthood*—\nnone of it occurs without this *single elixir field*.\n\nThus it is called *“the pivot of the world”*—\nlike all rivers converging at the sea,\nthis is where the *elixir* is refined.\nYet the *method of alchemy* values *gentle, yielding essence* as primary,\nso it takes its metaphor from the *receptive mother* of the world.\n\nThe *receptive mother* is *gentle* and *harmonious*—\nthis is the *Tàishàng*’s *Dao/Way*,\nalso called *“concentrating *qi* to achieve *gentleness*”*.\nSuch *utter gentleness* and *harmony* allow the *original essence*\nto dissolve and transform,\ngiving rise to *qi* and then to *spirit*.\n\nAnd the *original essence* within,\nwhen *stillness* is held to *nurture* the *kidney-qi*,\nuntil the *Divine Fire* refines,\nthe essence turns into *qi*—\nthen the *reverse cultivation* technique is applied,\nthe *inverted function* performed,\nraising and ascending it,\nconsuming and ingesting it,\nreturning it to the *earthen cauldron* to *lead govern mercury*,\nthus *using the vigorous to govern the receptive*—\nthis is the work after the *River Vehicle*.\n\nYet in the *beginning of meditation*,\nthe *heart* is *external yáng* and *internal yīn*,\nwhile the *kidneys* are *external yīn* and *internal yáng*».\n\n「When considering the post-natal body and its form,\nthe *external yáng* of the *heart* is the *sacrificial altar* (社),\nwhile the *external yīn* of the *kidneys* is the *receptive* (牝).\n\nNow, when *li* (離) is *empty* (虚) it becomes *yīn*,\nand when *kān* (坎) is *full* (满) it becomes *yáng*—\nthis is what *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) says:\n*“Though others are hosts, I am the guest”*;\nit is also said:\n*“Yáng is the male body, even in women;\nyīn is the female body, even in men.”*\nThis is the *inversion of Heaven and Earth*,\nwhere *li* reverses to become *male* (牡),\nand *kān* reverses to become *receptive* (牝).\n\nThe method of cultivation demands\nthat the *heart*’s rigid *qi* be transformed into *gentleness*,\nand its restless nature be made *still*;\nwhile the *kidneys*’ *gentle qi* becomes *rigid*,\nand its *stillness* turns *active*.\n\nThus, the *gentle and harmonious* nature of *li*\nnurtures the *vigorous and male* essence of *kān*—\nthis is the saying:\n*“Fire nourishes wood’s essence within,\nwater forges adamantine gold.”*\n\nOne must *use the heart to direct the qi*\nand *use nature to restrain emotions*.\nWhen emotions do not move recklessly,\nit is through *silent stillness* and *gentleness*,\nthrough *humility and forbearance*—\nthis refines the *heart-nature* (心性).\n\nTherefore, the *sweet nectar* (美液) of the *Upper Field* (上田)\nflows into the *Primordial Sea* (元海);\nthe *essence-liquid* (液) then transforms into *qi*\nand enters the *Elixir Field* (丹田).\n*“The Great State submits to the Small State”* (大国下小国)\nrefers to the descent from the *Upper Field* to the *Lower Field* (下田).\n\n*“Taking the Small State”* (取小国)\nmeans extracting the *kidney-yang* (金水) *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,\noperating the *River Vehicle* (河车) in reverse,\nand ascending it to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷).\n\n*“The Small State submits to the Great State”* (小国下大国)\nrefers again to ascending from the *Lower Field* (下田) to *Kūnlún* (昆仑),\nthen descending into the *Yellow Court* (黄庭).\n\nTo *“take the Great State”* (取大国)\nis to merge the *golden essence* (金液) of *Kūnlún*\nand direct it into the *Yellow Court*.\n\nI use the *sweet nectar* (甘液) of the *Upper Field*\nto flow into the *Lower Elixir Field* (下丹田) and generate *qi*,\nso when one extracts the *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,\nit is the *Great State* descending to take it.\nOr, when the *Elixir Field*’s *qi* ascends in reverse to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷) to generate *essence-liquid*,\nthen swallowing the *Heavenly Valley*’s *qi*\nis the *Small State* descending to take it.\n\nThis is the *golden essence* and *kidney-yang* ascending,\n*lead-qi* merging with marrow,\n*essence* condensing and *qi* harmonizing—\nin a moment’s breath, transforming into *sweet dew* (甘露) *divine water* (神水),\nflowing to the *upper palate* (上腭),\ndropping and returning to its source—\nthe moment when *essence-liquid* transforms into *qi*.\n\nWhen the *qi-mechanism* (气机) is fully robust,\nonce more the *River Vehicle* is operated,\ndirecting it upward to *Kūnlún*,\nswallowing the *marrow-essence* (髓精) of the *Brain Sea* (脑海),\nand descending it into the *Yellow Court*—\nthis is the moment when *qi* transforms into *essence-liquid*.\n\nYet the *Great State*’s *“descending flow”* (下流)\nis through *gentleness* and *stillness*,\nrestful and capacious—\ntruly possessing *virtue* beyond that of ordinary people,\nthis is the *spirit* transforming *qi* while *qi* refines *essence*,\nfilling the *Elixir Field* with abundance.\n\nThus, there is one who seeks to *accumulate the virtue of others* (畜人之德),\nand the *Small State* also has *inner clarity* (内朗) *wisdom* (之智),\nknowing its own *power* cannot rival the *Great*—\nwillingly submitting in homage and obedience,\ntruly possessing *magnanimity* beyond that of ordinary people.\nThis is when *essence* generates *qi*, *qi* generates *spirit*,\nand all returns in dependence to the *Yellow Court*.\n\nThus, there is also the *Dao* of *entering to serve others*.\nBoth seek the same goal without external attachment,\nso the *elixir* completes its *nine transformations* (九转),\nthe *Way* ascends to the *Nine Heavens* (九天),\nand one abides eternally with *Heaven and Earth* in shared longevity.\n\nHow does their *virtue* intermingle and return?\nThe supreme secret of refining the body\nlies nowhere beyond this—\nthose who attain it should treasure it,\nand not reveal it lightly.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Most Precious for All Under Heaven**\nThe *Dao* is the *mystery* of all things,\na treasure for the *virtuous* and a safeguard for the unvirtuous.\n*Beautiful speech* can be traded,\n*noble conduct* can elevate one’s standing.\nSince people are unvirtuous,\nwhy should they be abandoned?\n\nThus, the *sacrificial altar* (社) and the *three ministers* (三公) are established for the *Son of Heaven*,\nthough there are *arching walls* to precede the *four steeds* (先驷马),\nnothing compares to sitting and advancing this *Dao*.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this *Dao* as most precious?\nIs it not to *seek and obtain* it,\nto *avoid blame* through its practice?\n\nThus, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.\nThe *Great Dao* arises before *Heaven and Earth*,\nmingles within *emptiness and non-being*,\nfaint and obscure—\nunseen, unheard, untouched—\nyet truly the foundation upon which all things depend for their existence.\n\n*Master Zǐsī* (子思子) said:\n*“The *Way* of the *virtuous* is costly yet hidden.”*\nWithout *Dao*, there is no thing;\nwithout thing, there is no *Dao*.\nFrom the *Great Cycle* (大周) to the *sand boundary* (沙界),\ndown to the finest *dust-mote* (微尘),\nit cannot be sought through *traces or symbols*,\nnor exhausted through *words or speech*.\nTruly, it contains the *ultimate* without and the *ultimate* with,\nthe *ultimate* emptiness and the *ultimate* reality—\nvast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.\nNo mystery surpasses this.\n\nThe *virtuous* know this *Dao* is the most vital for the human body,\nso they cherish and conceal it,\ncultivate and treasure it,\nnever willing to part with it even for a moment.\nThe unvirtuous also know there is a *Dao*—\npracticing it preserves the body and brings *blessings* (福),\nwhile abandoning it shortens life and invites *calamity* (祸).\nNo better strategy exists for safeguarding the body.\n\nMoreover, when this *Dao* of *Middle Way* (中庸) is expressed in *speech*,\nit becomes *beautiful speech*—\nlike precious goods sold in the marketplace,\nall know to love and admire it,\nand wish to touch and possess it.\nWhen this *Dao* of *ordinary* (寻常) *Way* is seen in *conduct*,\nit becomes *noble conduct*—\nlike the *status* of a *great lord* or *eminent official*,\nall respect and honor it,\nand seek to elevate and exalt it.\nIf it cannot be expressed in *speech*,\nthen trading in it only invites *humiliation*;\nif it cannot be demonstrated in *conduct*,\nthen offering it only invites *slander*.\n\nThe *Classic of Poetry* (《诗》) says:\n*“Heaven nurtures the common people,\nendowing them with things and principles.\nThe people’s inherent nature,\nloves this *virtue* of *goodness* (懿德).”*\nThis shows that though *virtue* and *vice* differ,\nthe heart’s love for *virtue* remains the same.\n\nWhen I see one who is *virtuous*,\nI revere them.\nIf I see one who is unvirtuous,\nwhy should I despise them?\nIt is merely the *qi* and *nature* (气质) of their disposition\nor the *desires* (物欲) yet unrefined,\nthat cause them to stray from the *Dao*.\nYet their origin is ultimately no different.\n\nIf one can *transform* and *guide* them,\neven the most wicked person\nmay turn toward *virtue*.\nGreat indeed is the *Dao*’s power—\n*Heaven and Earth* abandon no thing,\nthe *sage* abandons no person.\n\nIf one abandons a person,\nit is self-abandonment—\nhow could the *Dao* permit such a thing?\n\n*Heaven* creates the people and establishes their *rulers*,\nmaking them *teachers* as well,\nso that they may govern all under Heaven\nand place the *three ministers* in order—\nthis is to *harmonize and guide* the *people*,\nto *transform and lead* the *multitudes*.\n\nTo *rectify* one’s own body\nis to *rectify* the court;\nto *rectify* the court\nis to *rectify* all under Heaven.»\n\n「Let all nations and regions be in harmony,\nand winds shall stir from all directions—\nthe *Son of Heaven* shall long preserve his reverence,\nthe *three ministers* shall long enjoy their honors,\nand only then shall the task be complete.\n\nIf one cannot uphold the *Dao* as *Heaven’s Way*,\nto renew and sustain the *people*,\nhow could one forever preserve *Heaven’s Mandate*,\nand enjoy boundless blessings?\n\nEven with the *nobility* of arched walls and treasures arrayed before,\nand the *wealth* of four-horse chariots racing behind,\none cannot rest in ease for a moment.\n\nHow much better to approach the *Dao* daily and nightly,\never vigilant, never forgetting,\nand thus naturally advance along the *Way*!\n\nThe *Chu Book* says:\n*\"The treasure of Chu is none other than virtue—*\n*virtue alone is its treasure.\"*\n\nThe *Shang Book* says:\n*\"Treasure only the worthy,*\n*and the people shall be near and at peace.\"*\n\nThis is the *Dao*—\nthe most prized by ancient emperors, kings, ministers, and officials alike.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this *Dao* in such esteem?\nBecause the *Dao* is the inherent *Way* of all people;\nseek it, and you shall find it—\nits pursuit is swift and effortless.\n\nIf one upholds this *Dao*,\nthey become a true *hero* among mortals;\nif one defies this *Dao*,\nthey become a great *offender* against *Heaven and Earth*.\n\nIs it merely a matter of having faults\nand yet failing to avoid the path of depravity?\n\n*Master Zisi* said:\n*\"The *Dao* must never be abandoned for an instant.\"*\n\nLet people strive earnestly!\nFor the *Dao* is a great matter in life—\nwhether *Son of Heaven*, *three ministers*, or all others,\none must cherish and guard it diligently.\n\nThough one may possess arched walls and four-horse chariots,\nit is better to sit and cultivate the *Dao*—\ndo not claim old age or depleted *qi* as excuses,\nfor self-deception is no defense.\n\nKnow this: even if one borrows *post-heaven* essence, *qi*, and spirit\nto forge *golden elixir* and *jade elixir*,\nand attain *transcendence* or *sainthood*,\nthis is but a trifling matter.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The *Dao* is the Great Harmony,\"*\nand also:\n*\"The *Dao* is the Void of Non-being.\"*\n\nThus, it is clear that those who study the *Dao*\nyet fail to grasp the principle of *Void* and *Non-being*,\neven if they refine essence and subdue *qi*,\nor meditate in *non-duality*,\nshall remain no different from the common folk.\n\nTherefore, in cultivating the *Dao* and forging the elixir,\none must take the *Original Spirit* as the master,\nthe *Original Qi* as the assistant to the spirit,\nand *True Breathing* as the means to refine the elixir.\n\nWithout the *Original Spirit*,\nthere is no foundation for the elixir;\nwithout the *Original Qi*,\nthere is no aid for the elixir.\n\nThis is like a womb containing an infant—\nwithout the union of the father’s essence and the mother’s blood,\nit remains empty and without substance.\n\nHaving obtained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,\nwithout *True Breathing* to govern them,\nthe spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in unity,\nmerge into one,\nand return to the pristine origin of *Great Simplicity*.\n\nI further impart this truth:\nWhen mortals cultivate and refine,\nhaving gained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,\nand mastered *True Breathing*,\nthey must gather the five into clusters of four,\nand merge the three into one—\nyet without *True Intent* as their guiding commander,\nthe *qi* and spirit shall scatter and disperse,\nand the elixir shall never form of its own accord.\n\nBut whence does *True Intent* arise?\nIt must emerge from the state of *Void* and *stillness*,\nof *ignorance* and *unawareness*—\nwhen suddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,\nand awareness begins,\nthis is the *True Intent*,\nnot the same as the ordinary mind or intent.\n\nThus the ancients said:\n*\"Sainthood is not attained by others—*\n*only by those who cultivate this true nature.\"*\n\nYet without drawing *qi* from *water* and *essence*,\nas resources and assistance,\neven the innate true nature shall hang suspended and empty,\nand risk falling into the *coarse void*.\n\nHaving known the birth of the *golden elixir*,\nwithout *True Breathing* to regulate and nurture it,\nhow could one gather and refine it into the elixir?\n\nThus, *True Breathing* is the essential tool for forging the elixir,\nand *True Intent* is the sovereign ruler of *True Breathing*.\n\nThose who study the *Dao* yet fail to unite spirit and *qi*,\nhow could they attain *stillness*?\n\nIf one attains the return of spirit and *qi*,\nthey must ferment and nurture deeply—\nonly then shall the *golden elixir* be fully realized.\n\nDo not stir the *Bright Awareness* of the ordinary mind,\nlest the *golden elixir* and *wood elixir* be separated,\nand the *Kan* and *Li* fail to interact.\n\nThrough this, I illuminate the mysteries of the *Dao*—\nlater scholars who gain insight from it\nmust treasure and guard it carefully!\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as Non-action, the Non-action as Action**\n\nThe great is *non-action*,\nthe *non-action* is action,\nthe *non-action* is flavorless.\n\nThe great and the small,\nthe many and the few,\nrepay resentment with *virtue*.\n\nPlan for difficulty in its ease,\nand achieve the great in its smallness.\n\nThe most difficult matters under *Heaven*\nmust be done in their simplicity;\nthe greatest matters under *Heaven*\nmust be done in their minutiae.\n\nTherefore, the *sage* never strives for the great,\nand thus achieves it.\n\nLight promises must be few,\nfor many shall be untrustworthy;\nmany undertakings must be few,\nfor many shall bring difficulty.\n\nThus the *sage* fears difficulty,\nand thus encounters none.\n\nThe *Dao* is inherently *Middle Way*—\nall may study it, all may attain it.\nYet because of *things* obscuring and *qi* constraining,\nwithout forceful pruning and removal,\nhow could one perceive the original face?\n\nLike washing clothes: though long stained by dust and filth,\none cannot clean them in a single step—\nthey must be slowly scrubbed,\ngently plucked,\nuntil the old rags are made new again.\n\nIf one uses too much force,\nnot only shall the filth not be removed,\nbut the clothes may be torn.\n\nThus, those who seek to penetrate the original truth\nmust not rush recklessly forward—\nat first, they must exert themselves,\nbut avoid hasty, unmeasured force;\nin time, they shall follow the *Middle Way*,\nand naturally see the original face.\n\nWhen their work reaches the stage of refining *Void* into the *Dao*,\nthey achieve *non-action*;\nwhen they respond to *Nature* without contrivance,\nthey achieve *actionless action*.\nPlain and unremarkable,\nwhat flavor could there be?\n\nHaving no flavor,\nwhat satiety could there be?\n\nAs for the great returning to the small,\nthe many yielding to the few,\nuntil the point of retribution—\nthis is not done through resentment,\nbut through *virtue*,\nall of which are the most wondrous transformations,\nthe most complete responses to conditions.\n\nYet in applying this,\nthere is no partiality—\n*virtue* is evenly bestowed;\nin repaying resentment with *virtue*,\nthere is no discordant sentiment—\nfor *virtue* is the common good of all people,\nand repaying with *virtue* is the natural expression of purity.»\n\n「To treat things by returning them to their nature,\nand to govern people by aligning with their own *Dao*,\nis to respond with greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity—\nall movements follow the natural order of Heaven,\neach action is the *Dao*,\neverywhere without distinction,\nyet never conflicting with oneself,\nnor ever clashing with others.\n\nAh, this is the *Dao* most difficult yet most simple,\nmost vast yet most minute.\n\nYet how many practitioners in the world\nseek quick results and immediate gains,\noften embracing what is difficult,\nand favoring what is grand,\nwithout knowing that difficulty arises from simplicity,\nand grandeur stems from the minute.\n\nThus, all great undertakings in the world\nmust begin with the small.\n\nSince the *Dao* is the root of all things,\nhow could one not proceed from ease to difficulty,\nfrom minute to vast?\n\nOtherwise, those who advance too swiftly\nshall retreat just as quickly—\nhow then could they hope to reach the realm of divine transformation?\n\nTherefore, the ancient sages knew\nthat the *Dao* has stages to traverse,\nand learning has steps to ascend,\nyet they did not ponder grand schemes,\nonly striving for the immediate essence.\nThey refined what was coarse,\nnurtured the fundamental source,\nlike water permeating plants—\nnaturally changing day by day,\ntransforming month by month,\nnot seen to grow yet ever growing.\n\nThus, from the subtle beginnings,\nfrom the crude to the refined,\nthey moved from *action* and *doing*\nto *non-action* and *actionless action*,\never more plain yet ever more profound,\never closer yet ever more distant,\nuntil they attained the realm of supreme beauty.\n\nThe sage never seeks the grand,\nand thus achieves the grand.\n\nNowadays, scholars at their outset\naspire to become immortals,\nthe more ambitious their hearts,\nthe more difficult their tasks—\nand so many falter halfway through.\n\nOnly through steadfast endurance,\nwith unwavering resolve,\ncan the difficult become easy,\nthe minute remain minute,\nand the grand be made small.\n\nI urge scholars to embrace difficulty in simplicity,\nto attain grandeur through the minute,\nto proceed with measured caution and maturity,\nand thus avoid recklessness and superficiality.\n\nOtherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the *Dao*’s profundity,\nbut they must cultivate sincerity and depth of heart to ever succeed—\nfor those who treat oaths lightly shall lack trust,\nand their regrets shall only deepen;\nthose who rush to inner cultivation,\nfavoring ease, shall often face great difficulty,\nand retreat shall follow swiftly.\n\nSuch is the inevitable course of things.\n\nThus, the sage’s initial cultivation,\nthough rooted in ease and the minute,\nis marked by ceaseless diligence,\nunceasing caution—\nfor the heart’s work is never truly finished.\n\nOnly by first confronting difficulty,\nthen guiding it like a boat on flowing water,\ndoing without *doing*,\ndoes one arrive at “no difficulty at all.”\n\nThese three lines on *“non-action”*\nare the essence of pure, natural effort.\nWhat follows—embracing difficulty in simplicity—\nis the intention of seeking profound refinement through gradual approach.\n\nAs for the *Dan* method,\nwhen speaking of *lead* and *mercury*,\nwhat are they truly?\n\nLet me clarify:\nThese substances are none other than the two poles of *yin* and *yang*.\nWhen *mercury* is paired with *lead*,\nit is as if *yin* is joined with *yang*—\nafter their union, primordial *qi* emerges,\nthen this *qi* is merged with *yin qi* in the central palace,\nand thus the *elixir* is formed.\n\nIn the *Post-Heaven* realm,\n*Li* is the pure *yang* of *Qian* (☰),\n*Kan* is the pure *yin* of *Kun* (☷).\nWith the movement of *qi*,\nthe *Qian*’s central line enters *Kun*,\nand the *Kun*’s central line enters *Qian*’s cavity—\n*Qian* then becomes *Void* as *Li*,\nand *Kun* becomes *full* as *Kan*.\n\nThus, though *Qian* is *yang* and contains *yin*,\nand *Kun* is *yin* yet holds *yang*,\nthey are no longer the pristine *yin-yang* of the *Taiji*’s undifferentiated unity.\nYet they remain fundamentally true.\n\nIn time, the *spirit* generates *jing*,\nand the *qi* transforms into *blood*—\nfrom here, the nature of *qi* and *blood*,\nand the destiny of *life-force* (*qi-shù*), emerge.\n\nFor those with thinking, perceiving minds,\nand bodies of *qi*, *blood*, and form,\nthey are unlike the original *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nThe adept uses method to draw forth\nthe *Li*’s single point of *self-mercury* (for *mercury* is the fluid of the heart,\nthough fluid belongs to *yin*,\nit arises from *Li*’s fire and carries its nature),\nand sends it down into the *Kan* palace,\nto warm the *Kan* palace’s single point of *yin blood* (for *blood* is the water of *Kan*,\nthough water belongs to *yang*,\nit is born from *Kan*’s water and is truly a cold substance)—\nas the ancients said:\n*“Fire enters the water domain,”*\n*“Spirit enters the realm of qi.”*\n\nJust as ice hardens when it meets fire,\nor as embers heat a pot,\nthe *yang qi* naturally warms,\ngiving rise to a pulsating *yin qi* current.\n\nAlthough, when fire enters water,\nit is like adding embers to a pot’s base,\nsteaming heat ascends vigorously—\nthis is the birth of true *lead*.\n\nThrough the adept’s *spirit*,\nthe *yang qi* rises upward to the *nirvana marrow* (for governance alone),\nas if baking wine in a heated pot—\nthe rising vapor is drawn by fire into the celestial vessel,\nthen condenses as dew dripping into the jar (this is what our teaching calls *“true mercury,”*\nand also *“the busy messenger from the Northern Sea’s first tide,\nnourishing the ancient tree’s roots in the Eastern Mountain”*—\nfor it is merely *qi* transformed into fluid).\n\nThen, returning to the furnace for warmth and cultivation,\nthe fluid again becomes *qi*,\ncycling endlessly—\nascending and descending,\nuntil the body’s *qi* and *blood* are exhausted,\nthe *yin qi* stripped away,\nand the mortal form is transmuted into a *golden body*,\nthe turbid essence into a *Qian* essence,\nreverting to the original *Taiji*’s *Void*—\nthe *Dharma-body* of neither birth nor death.\n\nJia Yuanxu once said:\n*“When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,\nthe *lead* and *mercury* within the body,\nare both ordinary *lead*—\nonly when *Kan* and *Li* unite,\ndo true *yin* and true *yang* converge,\nand a single point of true *yang* emerge,\ndoes one attain the primordial true *lead* seed.\n\nYet without a master’s oral instructions,\neven if one forcibly restrains it,\none can only solidify the *color-body* (*sèshēn*),\nand when the lower *dantian* is filled and strengthened,\nit shall inevitably leak and collapse.\n\nScholars who attain this *yang* generation\nhave only completed half the work—\nhow could they hope to form the embryo and achieve sainthood?\n\nOnly by drawing this *yang qi* upward,\nmerging it with the body’s *yin jing*,\nand further combining it with the *spirit marrow* (*shénsuí*)\nand *essence fluid* (*língyè*) of the *nirvana marrow* and *vermilion palace*—\nthis is truly *“the Eastern Neighbor’s daughter (wood-mercury),\nand the Western Neighbor’s son (gold-lead),\nuniting as husband and wife in the chamber.”*」\n\nThe Yellow Crone urges one to drink *gāotú* wine,\nand daily to intoxicate oneself with incense and vapor—\nthis is the union of *Heaven* and *Earth* to forge the elixir,\nwhile previously, only the *Kan-Li* union produced the medicine.\n\nWith this true *lead* and true *mercury* united,\none may then refine the *returned elixir*.\n*Lead* is the *gold* born from water,\n*mercury* is the *wood* born from fire.\nPreviously, these were but common *lead* and common *mercury*,\nbut now they are the true *lead* and true *mercury*.\n\nIf practitioners follow this method,\ncultivating the *spirit* (*shén*) without forcing the *qi*,\nthey shall not go astray.\n\n**Chapter 64: Non-Doing, Non-Clinging**\nThe unformed is easy to grasp,\nthe unmanifest is easy to plan,\nthe fragile is easy to shatter,\nthe subtle is easy to disperse.\nAct before it arises,\nregulate before disorder begins.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace,\ngrows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower,\nbegins with a single clod;\na thousand-*li* journey,\nstarts beneath one’s feet.\n\nThe doer brings defeat,\nthe clinger loses his way.\nThus, the Sage does not act,\nso he never fails;\ndoes not cling,\nso he never loses.\n\nThe people’s undertakings\noften falter just as completion nears.\nHeed the end as the beginning,\nand there shall be no failure.\n\nTherefore, the Sage\nwishes yet does not wish,\nvalues not the treasures that are hard to obtain;\nlearns yet does not learn,\nbut corrects the errors of others.\nHe aids the natural unfolding of all things,\nyet dares not interfere.\n\nThe *Dao* of refining one’s self\nbegins with restraining desire.\nThe key to restraining desire:\nto regulate it before it arises is easy,\nto regulate it as it arises is harder;\nto regulate it as it arises is still easier,\nbut to regulate it once formed is hardest.\n\nTherefore, the *Supreme Dao* says:\n*“The unformed is easy to grasp,\nthe unmanifest is easy to plan.”*\nWhen one dwells in quiet solitude,\nthe mind is not enslaved by affairs,\naffairs do not disturb the mind—\nstill and unmoving, settled in its place,\none’s grasp of self and preservation of nature\nis most effortless.\n\nMoreover, in silence and obscurity,\nwithout knowledge or perception,\nno trace or sign to seek,\nto then devise plans and ponder—\nto dispel idle thoughts and restore sincerity—\nits course is supremely smooth,\nits opportunity most favorable.\n\nSince the common *qi* is soft and fragile,\nand the common mind subtle and fleeting,\nbefore desires become entangled and relentless,\nbefore they twist and turn without end,\nto now break these impure thoughts,\nto scatter these lustful hearts,\nand restore the natural *Way* of Heaven,\nthe sincere and unerring—\nhow difficult would it be to sever these karmic ties,\nand instantly reveal one’s original nature of *Nirvana*?\n\nThis is not another act of doing—\nit is merely *“acting before it arises.”*\n\nThe ancient sage sought to prevent calamities before their sprouts,\nand discerned the opportunities at their nascent stirrings—\nthus all smoke and clouds were swept away,\nand thorns and brambles never took root.\n\nAgain, when the world is at great peace,\nand a rogue or petty tyrant seizes the moment to cause strife,\nit is no hardship for a lone horseman to emerge,\nand instantly witness their surrender—\nto govern before chaos arises,\nhow effortless the method must be!\n\nThis work of refining oneself is still easily achieved.\nBut to perfect the nine transformations,\ntime cannot be measured in mere years and months.\n\nHow many are the common, aimless folk\nwho fail to grasp the Dao as the grand Way of Heaven and Earth,\nand humanity as the true Sage of the cosmos!\nSome encounter a dharma assembly by chance\nand attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;\nothers lack the right conditions,\nand require countless lifetimes before success.\nSome repeatedly cultivate, meet fortunate circumstances,\nyet their virtue remains incomplete—\ntheir nature flawed, their disposition perverse—\nthey nearly attain but then fail,\nand fail so utterly that they never succeed.\n\nHow profound the mysteries of the Great Dao!\nFew truly comprehend its ways.\n\nLet us observe how things come to fruition:\nA tree of embrace,\nwhen first born, is but a slender sprout—\nthrough the gentle nurture of yin and yang,\nchanging daily and monthly,\nit grows into a mighty tree.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nwhen first raised,\nis merely a pile of earth—\nthrough human labor, gathering and refining,\never new and ever flourishing,\nit suddenly becomes a lofty tower.\nOr consider the unification of mountains and rivers,\nthe thousand-li journey to traverse a realm—\ncan one expect to reach their destination\nby merely lifting a foot or counting steps?\nNo—it begins with one step at a time,\nfrom near to far,\nuntil at last they arrive.\n\nThough called the \"Great Dao\",\nit truly encompasses the vast capacity of Heaven and Earth,\nthe nurturing power to birth and sustain all things—\nhow could it not be achieved through laborious layers,\nthrough winding, gradual progress?\n\nOnly those who deeply enter the Dao\ndo not seek swift results,\ndo not measure gains by proximity.\nThough gold and jade may be polished,\ntheir resolve remains unshaken;\nthough seasons may change,\ntheir diligence knows no variation.\nThus, from small to great,\nfrom low to high,\nfrom near to distant—\nlike the embrace of a mighty tree,\nthe rise of a nine-tiered tower,\na thousand-li journey—\nthey suddenly reveal wonders beyond compare.\n\nYet, the Dao is the natural Way,\nand its practice demands natural effort.\nMencius spoke of *\"gathering virtue and generating vital breath\"*—\nhis power lay in *\"non-action\"* and *\"non-forgetting.\"*\nAt first, he harmonized with the movement of Heaven and Earth,\nand the renewing of creation;\nlater, he aligned with the ceaseless passage of sun and moon,\nyet his radiance remained ever the same.\nIf one acts *with* intent to act,\nthen the actor is undone;\nif one grasps *with* intent to grasp,\nthen the grasper is lost.\n\nHeaven and Earth, the sun and moon,\nendlessly turning through ages—\ndo they not achieve transformation without contrivance?\n\nIf Heaven and Earth were to act *with* intent to move,\nif the sun and moon were to grasp *with* intent to shift,\nhow could they endure eternally without wear?\n\nThe saying goes:\n*\"If Heaven had emotions, Heaven too would age,\nBut since the sun has no will, it ever shines bright.\"*\nIs this not the truth?\n\nThus, the ancient sages\nrefined the supreme Dao,\nmarvelously following nature’s course.\nThey acted without acting—\nno failure in their deeds;\nthey grasped without grasping—\nno loss in their virtue.\n\nYet today’s seekers of the Dao\nmistake *non-action* for action,\nsometimes practicing, sometimes abandoning—\nthey do not know when to move or when to rest,\nwhen to align with the natural flow.\nTheir dynamic and stillness often falter,\nfar from the ancient path.\nSome nearly succeed but then collapse,\nand once fallen, never rise again.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Be cautious in its end,\nfor its beginning is all.\"*\nThus it endures through countless ages without replacement.\n\nAs for rare treasures,\nall men hold them dear—\nthe sage blends with the world,\nhis light undimmed,\nyet he seeks the Dao, not wealth.\nAt first, he does not know\nsuch preciousness exists in human affairs,\nso he does not value it—\nhis detachment is thus clear.\n\nIn matters of sight, hearing, speech, and movement,\nin daily actions and common affairs—\nthose who abandon restraint and stray beyond bounds\nneed not be spoken of.\nEven among those who seek the Dao,\nsome cling to emptiness, some to substance,\nsome grasp when they should not, some hold back when they should—\nall are errors.\n\nNow I alone follow the ancient path,\nembrace the old Way,\nand express my own views—\nnot to claim my words are lofty,\nbut to weigh the Dao’s measure.\n\nI think the Dao is *my* Dao,\nlearning is *my* learning—\nI attain what I attain by myself,\nso why speak of learning at all?\n\nMoreover, men often err in excess,\nwhile I alone act without contrivance.\nWith my Dao of *non-action*,\nI mend the errors of others—\nthis is to rectify myself and thereby rectify others.\nAnd with my Dao of *non-action*,\nI aid all things that fall short—\nthis is to order my own conduct and lead all things—\nhow dare I act otherwise?\n\nThe sage’s body is the Dao’s dwelling,\nthe people’s and all things’ reliance—\nhow could I for a moment cease to be?\n\nAt the outset, when I spoke of *\"its effortless grasp and preservation\"*,\nthose words referred to the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass—\nsilent and unmoving,\nyet responsive and thus harmonious.\n\nEven in the moments of not seeing, not hearing,\nthis realm holds the true essence—\nneither good nor evil.\nThe Buddha called it *\"that\"*;\nthe Confucian sage called it *\"the luminous harmony\"*—\nall speak of the same thing.\n\n---\n\nLike the morning sun upon lotus,\nthe dawn wind through willows—\ntender red and fresh green,\nradiant with loveliness.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Heaven and Earth in their primal union,\nAll things refined in their transformation.\nMale and female merge in essence,\nAll things born from this union.\"*\n\nIt speaks only of the initial *qi* in its gentleness,\nstill close to Heaven’s origin.\n\nZhu Xi’s verse declares:\n*\"A half-acre pond mirrors the sky—\nHeaven’s light and clouds drift by.\"*\n\nThis reveals the Dao-heart and human-heart,\ndistinct yet clear in an instant.\n\nHere, one steadies the will and nurtures the *qi*,\nestablishes teachings to sever entanglements,\nand thus ascends to the other shore.\n\n*The Rites* proclaim:\n*\"Man is born in stillness—\nThis is Heaven’s nature.\"*\n\nWhen stirred by things, he moves—\nThis is the nature of desire.\n\nLike Heaven and Earth at the first return of the cycle,\nall things revive in spring.\n\nThough things interact and stir desires,\nthese are still matters of Heaven’s nature,\nrooted in emptiness and stillness,\nnatural and unforced.\n\nOnly slight restraint is needed—\nno great schemes required—\nto curb desire and preserve sincerity,\nto quiet evil and return to right.\n\nLike tender shoots and fragile roots,\nhuman desire is easily severed,\nwhile Heaven’s principle may be restored.\n\nThe ancients called this the Mysterious Pass’s aperture,\nor the Gate of Life and Door of Death.\n\nWhen the human heart withdraws and hides,\nand the Heavenly heart shines forth,\nit is because, in the time before disturbance,\none acts and governs.\n\nYet once the first *yang* stirs,\nits mechanism is subtle,\nits momentum swift.\n\nBy the second and third *yang*,\nthe spirit condenses, *qi* gathers,\ntrue essence moves on its own—\nvast as tides, fluid as melting ice.\n\nAll arise from the subtle to the manifest,\nfrom small to great,\nfrom near to far.\n\nTo the alchemical stages—\nadvancing fire, advancing talismans,\nthe River Vehicle’s transport,\nrebirth of the male elixir,\nreunion of the female mercury—\nboiling, refining, gradually congealing,\nspirit complete, *qi* robust,\nthe pill perfected—\neven the six senses tremble,\nthe six powers fully manifest—\nall begin with the Mysterious Pass’s first movement.\n\nAt this initial stir,\nthe water’s source is purest.\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The White Tiger’s first passage—priceless treasure,\nThe Pool of Flowers—true gold in sacred water.\"*\n\nIf one awakens at this moment and acts,\nholding firm, one may then daily circulate one’s own mercury,\nenclosing the yin essence—\nlike the first crescent moon at the third day,\ngrowing to half at the upper arc,\nfull at the fifteenth.\n\nThus the sage knows all things under Heaven,\nfrom low to high, near to far,\nfollow their natural Dao.\n\nTo act without acting,\nto grasp without grasping—\nas Heaven speaks not yet all things move,\nhow unlike the people’s ruinous deeds,\ntheir failures called success!\n\nThis is all from a single piece of pristine clarity,\nundivided and whole.\n\nUnknowing what to desire,\none forgets even the thought of desire.\nThus it is said: *\"Desire not to desire.\"*\n\nAs for the value of millet and pearls,\nthere is no striving—\nfrom non-being to being,\nyet being remains non-being.\nThe Daoist’s inherent possession,\nneeding no external seeking.\n\nEven if one studies,\nit is still as if studying nothing.\nThus it is said: *\"Study not to study.\"*\n\nAs one’s own purity transforms the world’s杂,\nthe world’s杂 returns to one’s own purity—\nguiding and aiding all things,\nrooted in nature alone.\nHow unlike those who flaunt their private cleverness!\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 65: The Skillful Daoist**\n\nThe ancients skilled in the Dao\ndid not enlighten the people—\nthey sought to make them simple.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance\nlies in their excess of cleverness.\n\nThus, ruling with cleverness\nis a state’s ruin;\nruling without cleverness\nbrings the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two principles\nis called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Mysterious Virtue is profound,\nfar-reaching, contrary to things—\nonly then does one attain Great Harmony.\n\nUnder Heaven, all affairs rely on cleverness,\nyet the Dao does not rely on cleverness—\nit relies on simplicity.\nSimplicity is near to the Dao.\n\nThe Master’s lineage, passed down,\nwas grasped by the simpleminded Zengzi.\n\nThus the ancient sages\ngoverned under Heaven with the Dao.\nThey did not merely show the people the Dao—\nthey transformed them into the Dao,\nmysterious and indistinct,\nall returning to the pure stillness of Heaven—\nwhile the plowman and well-digger\nrise with the sun and rest with the moon,\nforgetting imperial might in their labor,\nfollowing Heaven without knowing it.\n\nAh! How pure their simplicity!\n\n「From the later generations onward,\nscholars and officials no longer valued *qu* (愚) but prized cleverness,\nthus giving rise to ever-more intricate schemes,\ncorrupting the hearts of men,\ndeepening their avarice and vulgarity daily,\nand rendering customs ever more deceitful.\n\nThe ruin of these people’s moral standards and rites,\ntheir lawbreaking and transgression of regulations,\ntheir disregard for death—\nsuch cases are countless and difficult to enumerate.\n\nAll stem from those who extol talent and favor acute intelligence,\nstriving to gain falsehood,\nwhile even the simple among the people indulge in guile.\nThe people’s innate purity has been pierced through,\ndeceit and cunning abound,\nyet in their ceaseless bustle,\none deceives while another fears,\nand those in authority find governance beyond their capacity.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To rule a nation with cleverness is to make it a thief;\nto rule without cleverness is to bring it fortune.\"*\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause when the people acquire knowledge,\ntheir primordial simplicity is already shattered.\nIf they remain in ignorance, unaware,\nthen their original purity endures intact.\n\nThese two paths—cleverness and simplicity—diverge,\nand their benefits and harms are starkly contrasted.\nRather than value cleverness and invite harm,\nwhy not embrace simplicity and reap its gains?\n\nUnderstanding these two principles\nis not only true for governing the world—\nit applies equally to cultivating oneself,\nserving as a model to follow.\n\nTo grasp this model\nis to approach the Dao.\n\nGreat cultivators,\neven when they see and hear nothing,\nreturn to the state of no thought, no care—\nthe divine essence of pure stillness.\nThis cannot be achieved\nby merely closing ears and eyes,\nor by suppressing acute intelligence,\nbut only through attaining true equanimity.\n\nIf even a single thread of calculation or scheming arises,\nthe original purity is lost,\nand the harmony of simplicity is ruined.\n\nKnowing that cleverness harms oneself,\nwhile simplicity benefits the body,\none should not flaunt their cleverness,\nbut delight in preserving their simplicity—\nthis is what is called the *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n\nAll that can be named is not the *Mysterious Virtue*;\nonly that which cannot be named,\nprofound and boundless,\nfar-reaching and unfathomable,\ncan be called the *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nThough it shares with flying and creeping things,\nand with the sluggish and dull,\nthe quality of having no desires, no knowledge,\nyet these creatures cannot grasp the threads of their origins,\nliving in perpetual darkness and confusion.\n\nMan alone,\nfrom coarse to refined,\nfrom origin to conclusion,\nmay reach the unity of the Three Primordials (三元),\nreturning the Great Ultimate (太极) to its original state (归真),\nand still attain divine transformation—\nhow could this not be contrary to things?\n\nIn governing a nation, cleverness is not valued,\nbut in cultivating the Dao, simplicity is all the more precious.\nFor cleverness is indeed the thief of a nation,\nwhile simplicity is the seed of the Dao.\n\nCan simplicity truly be the seed of the Dao?\nConsider the state of *Hun Dun* (混沌),\nwhere there is no thought, no care,\nno knowledge—\nis this not what is called simplicity?\n\nSuddenly, one awakens—\nthis is the unborn, unending essence of *I* (我).\nNone should claim to retain this awakening,\nto cultivate the supreme and perfect enlightenment (無上正等正覺),\nfor only then can one escape the cycle of rebirth,\navoid the forging of yin and yang (陰陽鼓鑄),\nand not be ensnared by ghosts and spirits (鬼神拘執).\n\nEven within the *Hun Dun* state,\nwhen one suddenly awakens—\nif I guard this true essence without letting it disperse,\nthis single awakening has already reached *Prajñāpāramitā* (般若波羅蜜).\n\nIf one steadfastly upholds and constantly guards it,\nthe seeds of rebirth will be severed here.\n\nIf another thought or perception arises,\nit is the post-natal *desire-knowledge* (後天識欲之神) mingling within,\nas the saying goes:\n*\"Countless movements bring forth the root of birth and death,\nThe foolish call it the original man.\"* (無量動來生死本，痴人唤作本来人)\n\nIn essence,\nthe divine essence is singular,\nbut desire makes it dual.\n\nDual thoughts and triple minds\nare the defiled roots and dust—\nthe cause of birth and death.\n\nOnly with one heart,\nno dual thoughts,\nhaving right awareness (正念),\nand no deluded mind (妄心),\nis the Dao found.\n\nIf one can dissolve even this single heart and right awareness,\nit is the Great Ultimate returning to the Non-Ultimate (太極還於無極),\nand the formation of the *Jin Xian* (金仙) lies within this refining of the void (炼虚).\n\nWhat is *refining of the void* (炼虚)?\nIt is like the state of *Hun Dun*,\nconfused and befuddled,\nas if in simplicity or drunkenness,\nhaving no knowledge, no awareness—\nthis is the void.\n\nWhen seated meditation reaches the stage of no person, no self,\nno place, no sky,\nthis too is refining of the void.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe essentials of learning the Dao\nbegin with forgetting the self,\nproceed to forgetting others,\nand end with forgetting the Dao itself—\nuntil one reaches the extreme of forgetting-forgetting,\nthis is the ultimate attainment.\n\nIf one can take this single moment as their master,\nand use true awakening as their means,\nthe Dao is not far.\n\nYet though the method of refining the void is thus,\nits practice must begin with refining the nature (炼性).\nThe ancients named refining the nature *casting the mirror* (鑄鏡).\n\nIf the mind is not refined,\none remains dim and unaware,\neven if the truth is right before their eyes—\nhow much more so for those who possess the Six Perfections (六通)?\n\nIf the heart is still clouded by private desires,\nit has not yet reached the void.\n\nAs in the state after true awakening,\none must not allow even a thread or speck of desire to remain in the chest—\nthen the *Ling Tai* (靈台) mirror’s treasure\nwill always shine brightly,\nthough not necessarily in full attainment,\nbut in a radiant gleam.\n\nEven within the *Hun Dun* state,\nwhen one suddenly knows—\nknowing nothing else—\nsuddenly awakens—\nawakening to nothing more—\nthis single moment reveals boundless clarity,\nilluminating all four directions without obstruction.\n\nHowever,\na student filled with private desires\ncannot suddenly become pure and transparent,\nlike jade or gold.\nHow could this be achieved\nby a mere moment of emptiness?\n\nOne must first forge the *female* and *male blades* (雌雄二劍),\nto eliminate both the visible and invisible demons (魔).\n\nIf these blades are not sharp,\nthe demons of desire (欲魔),\nform (色魔),\nheaven (天魔),\nand man (人魔)\ncannot be swept away and thoroughly purified,\nrevealing the true face of the Primordial (乾元).\n\nFor human desires and heavenly principles (天理)\nhave long been entangled;\nthough one seeks to stand alone in the stream,\nthe forces opposing them are too great.\n\nThus, though they know the truth,\nthey still tread upon it—\nfor those who lead them into human desires are many,\nwhile those who guide them toward heavenly principles are few.\n\nNow I tell the students:\nTo perfect the pure *Dharma-body* (法身),\none must first have a pure *divine essence* (神);\nTo obtain a pure *divine essence*,\none must cultivate boundless *qi* (氣).\n\nWhat is called *casting the blades* (鑄劍) has no other means—\nit is by nurturing the *qi* of the early morning (平旦之氣),\ndirect and unharmful,\nuntil it becomes vast and robust,\ngreat and firm.»\n\nOnce the divine sword is forged and its edge sharp,\nit can cleave demons and sever evil.\nAt that time—\nno longer will lewd sounds or ravishing beauty\ndisturb the mind upon sight,\nnor will even shared slumber with a fair woman\nrouse awareness;\nno longer will malevolent spirits or ominous omens\nshake the spirit,\nnor will the collapse of Tai Mountain before one’s eyes\ninspire fear.\n\nThis forging of the divine sword\ndepends on a will as resolute as the gods—\nyet alas, the practice is not deep-rooted,\nsometimes pursued, sometimes abandoned,\nunwilling to stand firm in the present moment.\n\nIf one can sever with a single stroke,\nand extinguish private desires the instant they arise,\nnever allowing them to regenerate—\nthis is the path to breaking the wheel of birth and death.\n\nThe Daoist student has no other secret—\nonly fear of failing to recognize\nthe mirror-like divine sword.\n\nIf recognized,\nthe mirror’s light shines universally in this instant,\nadmitting no evil or delusion,\nthe wisdom-sword hangs suspended—\ndesire-demons are instantly severed.\nFrom this moment, with a single thought held firm,\nthe divine chamber may be perfected,\nand the immortal elixir refined.\n\nThis mirror-like wisdom-sword\nis the essential task of the cultivator.\n\nIf the sword’s edge is dull,\nhow can it sever demonic forces?\nThus, the more one restrains the heart,\nthe more it grows disordered.\n\nIf the precious mirror lacks luminosity,\nhow can one distinguish principle from desire?\nThus, the more one strives to suppress,\nthe more they multiply.\n\nMencius spoke of nurturing *qi* but not of nurturing the heart—\ntruly, when *qi* is abundant, the heart naturally settles.\nThose who merely force the heart,\nwithout knowing that righteousness generates *qi*,\nare far from the Dao.\n\nLi Erqu said:\n*\"The human heart is naturally joyous,\nyet private desires bind it.\nWhen desire first stirs,\nthe true mind becomes aware.\nOnce aware, it vanishes—\nthe heart returns to its original joy.\"*\n\nThe humble old man said:\n*\"Luminous and silent, pervading the sands of the river,\nthe vulgar and the sage share the same home.\nWhen not a thought arises, the whole body manifests;\nthe six senses stir—clouds obscure the view.\nSevering vexation only deepens affliction,\nseeking true suchness is itself delusion.\nWorldly affairs follow their course without obstruction,\nnirvana and birth-death are but empty flowers.\"*\n\nLet those who study mind and nature\nmeditate deeply on these words.\n\n---\n**Chapter 66: On the King of All Valleys**\n\nThe reason the rivers and seas can be the sovereign of all valleys\nis that they excel in humility,\nand thus become the sovereign of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who wishes to surpass others\nmust first speak in a way that places himself below them;\nwho wishes to lead others\nmust first position himself behind them.\n\nThus, the Sage, though in the highest place,\ndoes not inspire awe,\nand though he moves forward,\nhe does not harm others.\nHence, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone can contend with him.\n\nAll desire others to submit to them,\nyet some, though not submitting, are submitted to,\nwhile others, though eager to submit, are ever more resisted—\nthis is because they exalt themselves,\nunwilling to lower their hearts or humble their *qi*.\n\nObserve how rivers and seas become the gathering place of all valleys—\nit is because they receive them from below,\nand thus become their sovereign.\nIf rivers and seas were to place themselves above the valleys,\nthough the valleys might still flow toward them,\nwhere would be their capacity to contain them?\n\nThus, the Sage perceives this early:\nto surpass others, he must speak from a lower place,\nas Yao consulted the Four Mountains,\nand Shun inquired of the Four Gates—\nall teachings, commands, and matters\nwere sought from ministers and neighbors,\nnever exalting his own wisdom.\nThis is why the more he humbles himself,\nthe more others elevate him.\n\nTo lead others, he must place himself behind them,\nas Yu, Gao, and Yi did—\nthough they were enlightened first,\nthey always yielded precedence to others,\nplacing themselves last.\nThis is why the more he retreats,\nthe more others advance.\n\nBecause he positions himself below and behind,\neven as emperor, he lacks the terror of authority,\nand thus is not feared.\nThough he governs the divine and human,\nhe lacks the harshness of domination,\nand thus does not harm others.\nTherefore, all under heaven willingly follow him as their leader,\nwith no resentment.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"There is no blame in him,\nnor in me any fault.\nMay we thus, night and day,\nperpetuate our good name.\"*\n\nWhat else is this but this?\nBecause he does not contend for superiority or precedence,\nothers naturally place him above and before him.\nThey submit to his teachings, revere his spirit,\nand endlessly receive his grace and virtue—\nhow could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,\nand rival the Sage in competition?\n\nThis is the analogy for elixir cultivation:\nfirst, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nand from the depths of the water, gold is born—\nonly then does the elixir of longevity begin to manifest.\n\nHumans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth to live,\noriginally complete and whole.\nYet after birth, *qi* and constitution constrain them,\nand desires obscure them,\nso that the original *qi* of Heaven\nis scattered and dissipated throughout the body’s stale *qi*,\nunable to gather in one place for long.\n\nNow, to converge the Five Phases,\nharmonize the Four Symbols,\nunite them in the central palace,\nand return them to the mysterious orifice—\none must first release all entanglements,\nallow no private thoughts to arise,\nclose the eyes and seal the mouth,\nso that the eyes see through the nose,\nthe nose faces the navel,\nand the heart-fire descends into the elixir field—\nin but a moment, the mysterious pass opens,\none *yang* revives,\nand the *qi* of the whole body\nnaturally gathers in the elixir field,\nfusing and flowing freely,\na joy beyond words.\n\nYet at the outset of observation,\nif the fire is not intense, the gold will not emerge from the ore;\nif the fire is too fierce, it will scorch the essence and blood,\nstifling the vital spark.\nOnly when it is neither clinging nor detached,\nneither present nor absent,\ndoes the *qi* of the elixir field leap with restless energy.\n\nThis is like the rivers and seas receiving all valleys—\nthus the valleys gather toward them.\nThe Sage receives all under heaven—\nthus all hearts turn to him.\n\nIn a single body,\nthe heart is the most noble and exalted,\nwhile all other limbs are small and lowly.\n\n---\n\nThe **Taoist Sage** thus likens the heart to the vastness of the rivers and seas,\nand all other limbs to the smallness of the valleys and the lowliness of the common folk—\nthis is the **elixir field** of the body.\n\nThose who cultivate the **Dao/Way** must likewise take the lowly as their foundation,\nthe humble as their root,\nyet not place themselves above the noble and exalted,\nso that they may descend to the common and ordinary—\nthen their attainment will be effortless.\n\nFor the ordinary man,\nthe spirit (*shen*) is the master,\nwhile *qi* follows its movements, rising and falling,\nthus giving birth to sons and daughters,\nand life and death.\n\nThe **Perfect Sage** (*Zhiren*) takes *qi* as the master,\nwhile the spirit listens and moves at its command.\nAs the *Wuzhen* says: *\"Though others act as master, I am the guest.\"*\n\nThe great adept,\nwhen *qi* moves,\ninverts the workings of **Nature** (*Zao*) and **Transformation** (*Hua*),\nupsets the **Heaven-Earth** (*Qiankun*) polarity,\nand simply follows its ascending and descending flow—\nreturning to the furnace to seal and refine,\nthen awaiting the **True Essence** (*Zhenxin*) to manifest,\ncycling and revolving in harmony,\nnever relying on the spirit for guidance.\n\nYet when one observes the **True Qi** (*Zhenqi*) surging and blending,\ninverting and reversing its course,\nand completes the ninefold transformation,\nthe **elixir** (*dantian*) matures and the **Pearl** (*zhuzhu*) awakens—\nis this not a lofty state,\nexalted above all,\nthe object of reverence for ten thousand men,\nthe spectacle of all under heaven?\n\nOnly when one abides in the lowly and follows behind in this manner,\ndoes the spirit of **lively detachment** (*huodantian*) arise—\na heart of humility and modesty,\nthus avoiding the calamities of **tilting the elixir field** (*qīdān dǎodìng*),\n**mercury fleeing** (*gǒngzǒu*),\nand **lead scattering** (*qiānfēi*).\n\nHence, when one remains in the lowly without striving,\nall under heaven cannot contend with him.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seventh**\nI possess the **Three Treasures** (*Sān Bǎo*),\nand all under heaven call me great—\nyet this seems unworthy.\n\nFor only the truly great can appear unworthy;\nif one seems worthy,\nit is long since one has been small.\n\nI possess the **Three Treasures**,\nand cling to them in safeguarding:\nthe first is **compassion** (*cí*),\nthe second is **frugality** (*jiǎn*),\nthe third is **not daring to lead all under heaven** (*bù gǎn wéi tiānxià xiān*).\n\nFor **compassion** brings forth **courage** (*yǒng*);\n**frugality** brings forth **breadth** (*guǎng*);\nand **not daring to lead all under heaven**,\nthus one can fulfill one’s role and endure.\n\nNow, if one abandons **compassion** for **courage**,\n**frugality** for **breadth**,\nand **not daring to lead** for **leading ahead**,\nthen one is already dead.\n\nFor **compassion**—\nwhen wielded in battle, it wins;\nwhen used in defense, it holds firm.\nWhen **Heaven** intends to save a man,\nit shields him with **compassion**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is fundamentally **Limitless** (*Wújí*), yet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).\nNeither great nor small,\nneither great nor small—\nit is both great and small at once.\n\nThere are indeed words that no thought or speculation can exhaust.\nIf one insists on calling it \"great,\"\nthen it is *\"the boundless and mighty **Harmonious Qi** (*Hàorán qì*),*\n*filling the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nIf one seeks to describe it as \"small,\"\nthen it is *\"the nameless **embryo** (*pǔ*),*\n*most subtle and minute,*\n*hidden in the boundless expanse.\"*\n\nIn man,\nits possession means life,\nits loss means death.\n\nAll arise from the **Limitless** yet take form,\nfrom the **invisible** yet manifest.\nTruly, the small is its origin,\nwhile the great is its unfolding.\n\nIt is better to speak of the small to reveal the **Dao/Way**,\nthan to speak of the great to explain it.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage** says:\n*\"All under heaven call me great.\"*\n\nFor **\"I\"** is the **Dao/Way** itself.\nThe **Dao/Way** has no fixed form or body;\nyet when called \"great,\"\nit seems to have a form and body that can be likened—\nthis does not truly resemble the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one wishes to embody **Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nand resemble the Sage’s form,\nfrom the opening of **Heaven** to the present day,\nthose who have established **Heaven’s polarity** (*Lìjí*) and expounded the **Dao/Way** and its teachings—\nfor ages now,\nthey have all relied on the **Limitless** as the **Ultimate**,\nthe **unmanifest** as the **manifest**,\nthe most subtle and minute as the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet how can one practice the **Dao/Way** when it is **soundless and odorless** (*wúshēng wúchòu*),\nflickering and indistinct?\nHow can the student begin?\n\nThe **Taoist Sage** says:\n*\"I possess the **Three Treasures**,\nand cling to them in safeguarding.\"*\n\nIf one holds them steadfastly without loss,\ntreasures them as precious,\nnever forgetting them in each thought,\nthen one may return to the origin\nand restore the **Primordial Sovereign** (*Wéihuáng*)’s descent.\n\nWhat are the **Three Treasures**?\nThe first is **compassion** (*cí*), which is **benevolence** (*rén*) itself.\n**Benevolence** and **compassion**, gentle and pervasive,\nare the **elemental principle** (*yuán*) of **Heaven**.\nThe gentleman embodies **benevolence**,\nand this suffices to nurture all men.\n\nMoreover, it encompasses the **Four Beginnings** (*Sì Duān*),\nand includes all **virtues** (*shàn*).\n**Benevolence** is within it—\nthen the **Dao/Way** is within it.\nFilling and exhausting it,\nit can embrace **Heaven and Earth**,\nand permeate **ancient and modern**.\n\nThis is the **foundation of the Golden Elixir** (*Jīndān zhī běn*),\nand the adept must cherish and remember it.\n\nYet its **Dao/Way** extends to the utmost greatness,\nwhile its **root** (*míng*) ascends from the utmost subtlety.\nIf one does not know to **forget all thoughts** (*wànniàn jū wàng*),\nand **illuminate the inner essence** (*yīlíng nèizhào*),\nbut instead merely pursues breadth and becomes dissipated,\nseeks vastness and wanders aimlessly,\nthen one will gain nothing of **benevolence**,\nand nothing of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nOnly when one **inverts and seeks within oneself** (*fǎnqiú*),\nand **steadfastly guards the heart** (*dǔshǒu zhū xīn*),\ndoes one establish oneself while also establishing others,\nand reach fulfillment while also fulfilling others.\nGuarding the narrow yet applying the broad—\nthis is what the ancients called **\"obtaining one, all things are accomplished\"** (*dé yī wànshì bì*),\nis it not the essence of **frugality** (*jiǎn*)?\n\nFor **frugality** is the means to seek **benevolence**,\nand the key to cultivating the **Dao/Way**.\nThe student, having known **compassion**,\nmust further nourish it with **frugality**,\nthen alone may he align with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet if one exalts himself in pride,\nand magnifies his own greatness,\nwithout the measure of humility and modesty,\nthen within he knows only himself,\nand without he scorns all others.\nHe boasts of his cleverness,\nand arrogantly proclaims his wisdom,\ntruly believing he is the first to awaken and harmonize—\noften he regards all under heaven as incapable of surpassing him.\n\nIn the end,\nhis nature is not **serene and tranquil** (*tiánjìng*),\nhis *qi* is not **harmonious and peaceful** (*héping*),\nand yet he hopes to complete the **Nine Turns of the Elixir** (*jiǔ zhuǎn dānchéng*),\nand reach the **Nine Heavens of the Dao/Way** (*jiǔ tiān dǎojí*)—\nthis is indeed difficult.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The essential key to refining the elixir*\n*is to take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the **Dao/Way’s body**,*\n*and **harmonious blending** (*chōnghé*) as the **Dao/Way’s function**—*\n*then, in all things and places,*\n*one must not dare to lead all under heaven.\"*\n\nMoreover, **compassion** (*cí*) is the **innate capacity** (*liángnéng*) of man’s heart.\nExhausting one’s own heart to establish the **fate** (*mìng*) of all things,\nwhat a vast **vow** (*shìyuàn*) this is!\nNurturing the **sincere and upright** (*cùnzhōng*) nature within,\nto seek the **peace** (*ān*) of all things,\nwhat a mighty **precision** (*jīnglì*) and **strength** (*liàng*) this is!\n\nThus the man who guards **compassion** is the same as the man who nourishes **courage**.\n**Zengzi** told **Zixiang**:\n*\"When reflecting upon oneself without shrinking,*\n*even if one is clad in coarse garments and broadcloth,*\n*I would not fear.\"*\n\n「If one reflects upon oneself and shrinks back,\neven if there are a thousand people,\nI would still go forward.\n\n*Is it not the man who casts aside all private thoughts of self-interest,*\n*who can possess such great courage?*\n\n**Courage** (*yǒng*) must be rooted in restraint (*yuē*) before it can be expressed broadly (*bó*).\nIf one does not restrain, how can one be broad?\n\nOnly when one can **prudently** (*shèn*) govern one’s actions,\n**sparingly** (*shěng*) consider one’s thoughts,\n**dedicate** (*zhì*) a single mind to the **rectifying field** (*fāngcùn*),\n**gather** (*shōu*) all the **hundreds of limbs** (*bǎitiǎn*) to the **elixir field** (*dāntián*),\n**unceasingly** (*miánmiánmìmì*) and **unflaggingly** (*bù'èrbùxī*), **continuously** (*jìjì*) and **purely** (*chúnchún*),\n**without slackness** (*wúdài*) or **neglect** (*wúhuāng*),\nthen **naturally** (*zìrán*) one’s **self-cultivation** (*xiūshēn*) will be complete,\nand **all under heaven** (*tiānxià*) will find **peace** (*píng*).\n\n*How else could one achieve such breadth if not through frugality?*\n\nAs for **not daring to lead all under heaven** (*bùgǎnwéitiānxiàxiān*),\nit is the **proper humility** (*qiānzūn*) and **radiant virtue** (*guāng*) of **steadfastness** (*ānzhēn*).\n**Gentleness** (*róushùn*) and **yielding** (*róushùn*) to all under heaven,\nwhile none under heaven dare to contend with him—\nthis is to **align with** (*shùnchéng*) the **Dao/Way’s unfolding** (*tiāndào*),\nand the **Dao/Way** will **silently** (*mò*) grant its completion (*chéng*).\n\n*Without the **virtue/power** (*dé*) of **harmonious blending** (*chōnghé*),*\n*how could one dare not to lead all under heaven,*\n*and still achieve a **great instrument’s** (*dàqì*) late fulfillment (*wǎnchéng*) like this?*\n\nThus, **compassion** (*cí*), **frugality** (*jiǎn*), and **yielding** (*hòu*)\nare all the **foundations** (*běnshǐ*) of seeking the **Dao/Way**.\n**Courage** (*yǒng*), **breadth** (*guǎng*), and **leading** (*xiān*)\nare all the **ultimate expressions** (*mòxiào*) of following the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet today’s scholars are otherwise:\n**Discarding compassion** (*shěcí*) yet **pursuing courage** (*qǐyǒng*), they will **nurture a cruel heart** (*shēngrényīnxīn*);\n**Discarding frugality** (*shějiǎn*) yet **seeking breadth** (*qǐguǎng*), they will **harbor greedy desires** (*xīn huái tānniàn*);\n**Discarding yielding** (*shěhòu*) yet **striving to lead** (*qǐxiān*), they will **engage in rivalry** (*bǔyǒuchéng*—*contesting competition*).\n\n*All are paths that lead to death.*\nEven if they **chance to survive** (*xìngcún*),\nthey are but **living corpses** (*xíngshī*), **wandering flesh** (*zǒuròu*),\n**mingling indiscriminately** (*làncè*) among the masses (*rénqún*),\n*what difference is there between them and the dead?*\n\nIn summary, **compassion** is the **natural principle** (*shēnglǐ*) of man,\na **shared essence** (*xìng suǒ tóngrán*) within all.\nOnly when one **guards it with restraint** (*shǒuzhīyǐyuē*) and **expresses it in harmony** (*chūzhīyǐhé*),\nwill **compassionate benevolence** (*cíhuì*) and **tender concern** (*cèdá*) flow forth from **true sincerity** (*zìchū zhēnchéng*),\nand **none under heaven** (*tiānxià*) will fail to **bow in submission** (*xīnzhé*) and **yield** (*qūshì*).\n\n*When benevolence suffices to benefit others,*\n*a **compassionate man** (*rénzhě*) is **unmatched** (*wúdí*),\n*how could there ever be defeat in battle,*\n*or failure in defense,*\n*bringing shame upon all under heaven?*\n\nThe *Book of Documents* (*Shū*) says:\n*\"Only the **Heavenly** (*wéitiān*) **obscures** (*yīn*) and **nourishes** (*bì*) the people below,\n**harmonizing** (*xiángxié*) their dwelling in **cooperation** (*xiángxié*).\"*\n*Granting them life and fulfillment* (*yǐshēngyǐsuì*),\nthey **endure** (*yǒngxiǎng*) the **eternal peace** (*wúshì*) of **Heaven** (*tiān*),\n*this is what is called the **Heaven’s intent to save** (*tiān jiāng jiùzhī*) them.*\n\nThe *Book of Odes* (*Shījīng*) says:\n*\"The **Heaven’s command** (*wéitiānzhīmìng*) is **profoundly harmonious** (*yúmù*) and **unceasing** (*bùyǐ*).\"*\n*It reveals the **clear and boundless qi** (*qīngkōngyīqì*),*\n**flowing and unending** (*liúxíngbùxī*), **nurturing and limitless** (*fāyùwújiāng*),\n*and it is said that **compassion alone** (*cíwèizhī*) suffices to **guard** (*wèi*) it.*\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is called the **Great Dao/Way** (*Dàdào*),\n*its essence is **boundless** (*wújí*) yet the **Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).*\nYet if one does not **trace its origin from the boundless** (*cóngwújízhīshǐ*),\n**searching** (*zhǐ*) for a **foothold** (*jīnyá*) in the **chaotic indistinctness** (*húnhúndùn*),\nhow could one **fathom** (*cè*) the **root of the Supreme Ultimate** (*Tàijízhīgēn*)?\nHow could one **measure** (*mì*) its **beginning and end** (*qǐzhǐ*)?\n\nScholars must first **clarify the Dao’s source** (*Dàoyuán*).\nIn the **unseen and unheard** (*bùshòubùwén*),\nthey must **seek out** (*zhǐ*) the **most subtle and profound essence** (*zhìyǐnzhìwēizhītǐ*),\n*this is what is called the **void yet responsive** (*xūérlíng*).*\n\nYet its **subtlety is already extreme** (*guǎnqíxiàyǐshèn*),\n*like a single grain of millet* (*shǔzhūyīlì*)—\n*and there is something that can be **imagined** (*xiàng*).*\n\nIn totality, it is **form without form** (*wúxíngzhīxíng*),\n**state without state** (*wúzhuàngzhīzhuàng*).\n**Approach it and one does not see its head** (*yíngzhībùjiànqíshǒu*),\n**follow it and one does not see its tail** (*suízhībùjiànqíhòu*).\n*This is the **warm and luminous compassion** (*ǎirán yīpiàn cíhuì*) within man’s heart.*\n\nEven the **most stubborn and base** (*suǒwéizhuānzuì*) of men,\n*does not **extinguish** (*mǐn*) the **compassion** (*cízhīxìng*) within them.*\nConfucius said:\n*\"If I seek **virtue/power** (*rén*), then **virtue/power** (*rén*) will **immediately** (*sī*) come to me.\"*\n\nThe cultivation of the elixir—what else is it?\nIt is nothing but nurturing this compassion.\n\nWhat is compassion?\nWhen the King of Qi sees a cow trembling and cannot bear it,\nWhen a villager sees a weak child fall into a well and feels distress—\nThese are the stirrings of the heart of virtue,\nThe return of the Heavenly heart.\n\nReflecting on this, such impulses and thoughts arise without ceasing—\nOnly fear that people fail to perceive them.\n\nThe scholar, from the spontaneous movement of true nature,\nExpands and acts, thereby establishing a foundation for elixir cultivation.\nYet one must not seek breadth at the cost of neglect,\nBut rather adhere to restraint and subtlety.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, wholehearted sincerity—\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The heart must dwell within the chest,\nLest thoughts stray through the gate of totality.\"*\n\nThus, the more restrained, the broader;\nThe more subtle, the more manifest.\nThe more precise the restraint,\nThe wider the unfolding.\n\nHow can the scholar not take frugality as the root?\nThough frugality is a virtue of the mind,\nIt is indeed a fine method to avoid excess through restraint.\nYet if not tempered with humility and gentleness,\nOne risks the violent nature igniting and harming the elixir.\nThus, restraint must be paired with utmost harmony—\nIn all things, humility and self-effacement,\nNever presuming to lead—\nThis is the way of emptying oneself for others.\n\nWhen the heart of virtue endures,\nThe Dao-qi endures as well.\n\nIf one values courage over compassion,\nSeeks abundance over frugality,\nAnd places oneself before others,\nThen the heart is merely ordinary.\nHow could one expect to hold the Three Treasures without loss?\n\nMoreover, when a person possesses compassion,\nIt is most effective in winning others’ favor—\nIn battle, victory is assured;\nIn defense, the city stands firm.\nThis is like tending the furnace with fire,\nBurning away the Three Vermin;\nOr guarding the city with ritual purity,\nThus preserving the embryo-spirit and original essence.\n\nThis gentle and harmonious heart\nIs the key to elixir cultivation and Dao-nurturing.\n\nHeaven, in creating man,\nEndows him with life and, without fail, with compassion.\nIf one can constantly reflect and return to virtue,\nThe elixir of eternal life is already within reach.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nA true warrior does not rely on brute force,\nA skilled fighter does not rage,\nOne who triumphs over enemies does not contend,\nAnd one who wields people places himself beneath them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called harnessing others’ strength,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n*\"Shì\"* (士) means teacher of the people.\nA teacher of the people wields armies,\nOriginally valuing martial prowess.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Firm yet yielding, advancing boldly yet following order,\nMighty yet without slaughter.\"*\nThis is wielding force without force—\nThe mark of a true teacher of the people.\n\nWhen facing a great enemy, armies clash,\nTwo forces stand arrayed—\nOne cannot avoid deploying troops,\nBrandishing weapons, charging like rivers,\nTheir roar shaking the heavens.\n\nYet in truth, with few soldiers,\nA sudden onslaught by a mighty foe—\nIt is no difficulty to play music and drive back the invaders,\nOr compose melodies to lift the siege.\nThis is the way of achieving might without anger.\n\nWhen the troops return in triumph, proclaiming victory,\nWhile others boast of their deeds,\nHe alone humbly withdraws—\nSuch a general can stand without shame.\n\nEven if honors are heaped upon him,\nHe remains modest, his face flushed—\nThis is how one who conquers without contention behaves.\n\nThe *Shujing* says:\n*\"You alone do not contend,\nAnd none in the world will contend with your ability.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nSuch men arise from promoting the old while establishing the new,\nGathering wisdom and broadening benefits,\nNot relying on their own talents,\nBut skillfully using others’ talents as their own;\nNot boasting of their own wisdom,\nBut skillfully using others’ wisdom as their own.\n\nThis is the way of humbling oneself to elevate others—\nIf not for heeding wise counsel,\nConsulting the good path,\nMaintaining an open heart like a valley,\nAnd practicing humble reverence—\nHow could one achieve such mastery of war and victory,\nTurning the world as easily as flipping one’s palm?\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nBy which one serves the people.\nThis is harnessing others’ strength,\nBy which one commands the world.\nThis is aligning with the people below,\nAnd harmonizing with Heaven above—\nBy which one serves the people’s hearts.\nThis is harnessing others’ strength,\nBy which one commands the world.\nThis is aligning with the people below,\nAnd harmonizing with Heaven above—\nStanding with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishing the ultimate of all ages.\n\nAlas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity and fulfillment of nature,\nHow could one, amid the chaos of war,\nConceal the winds of peace and courtesy,\nWield force without force,\nAct in anger without anger,\nContend without contention—\nAs described here?\n\nMoreover, ruling with broad tolerance,\nPlanning with deference to others,\nPlacing the worthy in office,\nAnd the capable in their posts—\nThen all under Heaven’s scholars\nWill offer loyalty and sincerity,\nEager to perform deeds and fulfill commands,\nAs if Heaven’s seasons flow without speech,\nAnd all things present their offerings—\nThis is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishes the ultimate.\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"Reflect on the virtuous Hou Ji,\nWho aligned with Heaven—\nNone but you could achieve this ultimate.\"*\nWithout such a man, to whom shall we turn?\n\nThis speaks of refining the medicine with fire—\nThough there are fierce methods of rapid distillation,\nYet one must act according to the time,\nFollow the natural course,\nWield force without force—\nThus avoiding the peril of overturning the elixir or toppling the cauldron.\n\nEven when the vital breath moves,\nAnd true yang arises—\nMost vast, most strong,\nFilling the two great vessels—\nWhat differs from a warrior’s fierce, overwhelming rage,\nSweeping all before him?\n\nMoreover, when gathering and refining the fire,\nIt is only because the浩然 (*hàorán*) breath expands—\nNot for the sake of strength itself.\nThus, after purification,\nOrdinary bones become jade bones,\nAnd the mortal body transforms into a golden body.\n\nIt is said: *\"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm,\nOr seizing the world as one picks up a feather.\"*\nOnly when the spirit is both concentrated and effortless,\nAnd breathing is both regulated and unrestrained,\nDoes one purely follow Heaven,\nWithout human interference.\n\nEven when Heaven and man contend,\nAnd reason and desire clash—\nOne must still uphold reason to restrain desire,\nAnd exhaust human effort to merge with Heaven.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches its utmost refinement—\nPrinciples profound, benevolence mature—\nNo trace remains of selfish ambition,\nNo striving for merit or prowess—\nThus the benevolent stand unmatched beneath Heaven.\n\nSuch is the way of humility and yielding,\nOf emptiness and submission to others,\nOf attuning to the ebb and flow of *qi*,\nAnd letting it guide one’s transformation.\n\nTherefore, the elixir’s completion\nHas its unseen yet manifest,\nIts motionless yet ever-changing,\nIts effortless yet inevitable fulfillment.\nWhat differs from a master’s skill in wielding others?\n\nIn cultivating the human *Dao*,\nIf one remains ever at peace,\nEver yielding and compliant,\nDesire needing no suppression to suppress itself,\nReason needing no invocation to arise naturally—\nThis is called the *virtue* of non-contention.\n\nWith a heart of non-contention,\nFollowing principle in action,\nAdapting to circumstances in movement—\nIt is as though using others’ strength\nTo achieve one’s own success,\nYet encompassing Heaven and Earth’s transformations\nWithout overreaching.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"What does Heaven speak?\nThe four seasons proceed therein,\nAll things take life therein.\"*\n\nThe Sage merges with the *Dao* in truth,\nStanding firm as the very threads of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishing the ultimate measure for all ages.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Victorious Through Compassion**\nIn warfare, it is said:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends,\nNor advance an inch only to retreat a foot.\"*\nThis is called:\nMoving without movement,\nPushing without arms,\nConquering without force,\nSeizing without weapons.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing what is most precious.\n\nThus, when armies clash,\nThe compassionate prevail.\n\nAncient strategists spoke of battle tactics:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends.\"*\nThe aggressor is like a sovereign—\nA sovereign’s decrees command absolute authority;\nThe defender is like a minister—\nA minister obeys the sovereign’s will,\nAs in *\"Let the other be the host, I the guest.\"*\n\nThus, if I am the aggressor,\nIt means my post-Heavenly human-heart takes command,\nWhile my pre-Heavenly *Dao*-heart retreats in submission.\nHow dare I let the post-Heavenly human-heart dominate,\nAnd treat it as the guest while relying on it utterly?\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch only to retreat a foot\"*—\nThis means:\nWhen victorious, even an inch gained must be firmly held;\nWhen defeated, not even a single step may be conceded.\nIf one advances with an inch’s gain\nYet retreats by a foot’s measure,\nIt is to gain little and lose much,\nDifficult to succeed and easy to fail.\n\nIn warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;\nIn cultivating the *Dao*, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.\nHow dare I?\n\nOnly by yielding to the other as host,\nAnd submitting myself as guest,\nDoes the enemy have no advantage to exploit,\nAnd I no vulnerability to attack—\nThus, controlling others without being controlled,\nAvoiding humiliation entirely.\n\nAdvance where opportunity allows,\nRetreat where difficulty arises.\nIn advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boundless momentum;\nIn retreating, one must not present an assailable posture.\nSuch caution, such vigilance—\nAlways yielding precedence to others,\nWhile placing oneself last.\n\nThus, in marching armies,\nIt appears as though others can move while I seem unable;\nYet when I press forward with resolve,\nStretching forth my arms,\nIt seems as though others have arms while I have none.\nWhen facing the enemy in battle,\nWith armies locked in struggle,\nIt seems as though others can resist while I cannot.\n\nThough drums thunder and flags billow,\nThe enemy wields weapons—\nHow could I alone be weaponless?\n\nThus, advancing without recklessness,\nRetreating without haste—\nTruly knowing that the fate of the state,\nThe rise or fall of the nation,\nHangs upon this single battle—\nHow could the enemy be treated lightly?\n\nObserve the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—\nThey often succeeded;\nThose who underestimated the enemy—\nThey invariably failed.\nAs seen in Guan Zi’s campaign against the Yanrong,\nOr Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.\n\nMoreover, the prosperity or decline of the court\nDepends on the success or failure of its generals.\nIf one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,\nBoasting of talent or relying on cunning,\nAnd claiming none can surpass them—\nLike Meng Ming’s reckless advance,\nOr Gao Gu’s overconfident charge—\nThere has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,\nDestruction to the family,\nAnd extinction to the ancestral line.\n\nThe Sage’s greatest treasure is *trust*—\nUnderestimating the enemy betrays the sovereign’s faith.\n\nWhen two armies confront,\nTwo forces clash—\nYet one remains weak and yielding,\nMost compassionate, most benevolent.\nAlways fearing that the *qi* of slaughter\nDisrupts the harmony of Heaven and Earth;\nNever rejoicing in the might of arms\nTo expand territory through conquest.\n\nWarfare on the battlefield\nIs but a last resort.\nThough no weeping follows the army’s retreat,\nThe heart of compassion and pity,\nThe anguish and urgency of grief,\nAlready permeate the encamped troops,\nAnd the three armies are nourished by it,\nWhile the common people respond with gratitude.\n\nThus, the virtuous either do not war,\nOr, if they do, they prevail.\nIs this not because the heart of compassion\nExtends to others,\nAnd enters their very souls?\n\nThis illustrates the birth of true *yang*,\nThe flourishing of *qi*—\nOnly then may the fire be refined and the work proceed.\n\nIf one does not quietly await the *yin* essence’s movement,\nAnd leisurely regulates the ascent and descent,\nThe advance and retreat,\nThe cyclical circulation of spirit—\nThere will be none who do not suffer from errant fire,\nAnd face great humiliation.\n\nAt the four critical junctures,\nOne must await the *kan* *qi*’s spontaneous motion,\nLest *li* presume to dominate.\nThus it is said:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends.\"*\n\nIn the *Dao* of cultivation,\nAdvancing brings stability,\nRetreating brings disaster.\nLike Heaven’s ceaseless motion,\nLike water’s unending flow—\nOnly then does one ascend daily without halt.\nIf one proceeds intermittently,\nNow pushing, now neglecting—\nOne step forward, ten steps back—\nGaining little, losing much—\nSuccess will never be attained in a lifetime.\n\nThis arises from ignorance of the *Dao* of returning to the root,\nOf restoring one’s true nature—\nA path of daily practice,\nNot to be seized by clever schemes,\nNor achieved through contrived actions.\n\n「Indeed, those who cultivate the *Dao* of the elixir in reverse—\nForcing the *Dao* against its natural flow—\nStudy as though they do not study,\nAnd labor though their efforts yield no fruit,\nYet follow the *Dao*’s unfolding,\nProceeding with ease and without hindrance,\nTaking nothing in hand—\nIt is like the Great Yu taming the waters,\nActing where there is no need to act.\n\nShould one instead advance fire and invoke talismans,\nLightly rushing forward or retreating,\nIt is like a soldier who scorns his enemy—\nNone have escaped fire rising to harm the elixir,\nOr the furnace crumbling while the cauldron fails,\nThus causing lead and mercury to scatter in ruin.\n\nAh! To trust nature purely,\nAnd to hold oneself in reverent caution—\nThis alone ensures the radiant brilliance of success.\n\nBut if one recklessly fancies cleverness,\nThe treasure of longevity will be slain by this very *post-heaven* thief of the corpse,\nAnd its harm will be without end—\nHow then can one hope for an elixir that is both great and enduring?\n\nOnly with boundless compassion,\nAnd profound sorrow for all things,\nDoes one then manifest in peace,\nAnd act with gentle compliance—\nThus does nature yield in all directions,\nAnd every battle is won without struggle.\n\nStudents of the *Dao* must be cautious:\nDo not let the *post-heaven* mind of knowledge dominate,\nWhile the *pre-heaven* primordial *qi* retreats in submission—\nThen perhaps will there be no deviation.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Humble Clothes the Precious Jade**\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\n\nWords have a *root* (*宗*),\nAffairs have a *master* (*君*).\nIt is only because of ignorance,\nThat none recognize me.\n\nFew know me—\nThus I am held in esteem.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse raiment,\nYet harbors the most precious jade.\n\nThe Great *Dao* is the inherent goodness of human nature,\nA matter of daily practice,\nEver near and close—\nOne cannot separate from it for even a moment.\n\nTo separate is to lose the *Dao*,\nTo lose the *Dao* is to lose humanity—\nThen what words are there?\n\nEven if my teachings were piled in millions,\nFilling chests and boxes beyond count,\nYet all are intimately tied to human nature,\nClose to daily practice—\nNone are difficult to know or practice.\n\nSo why is it that none under Heaven can know or practice them?\nIs it because my words are not easy to know or practice?\n\nNo—it is because words have a *root*,\nAnd affairs have a *master*—\nThe *root* being the innate knowledge one does not need to study,\nThe *master* being the innate ability one does not need to learn.\n\nIf one knows the *root* of words,\nThen one draws near from within oneself,\nAnd all words become virtuous speech.\n\nIf one knows the *master* of affairs,\nThen one silently observes their hidden essence,\nAnd all actions become virtuous deeds.\n\nThe *Dao* is like a great road—\nHow could it be difficult to know or practice?\n\nTo reflect inwardly and be sincere—\nNo greater joy is there.\n\nIf one does not know that words have a *root*,\nOr that affairs have a *master*,\nAnd instead seeks them in distant and lofty places,\nOr in broad and remote lands—\nThen one indulges in trifles and loses one’s resolve,\nPursues the vast and strays from the essential,\nMakes one’s form a burden,\nAnd one’s nature a chain of *qi*—\nThus does the original virtue of Heaven’s *Dao* grow dim?\n\nEven so,\nTheir knowing me adds nothing to me,\nTheir ignorance harms me not at all.\nFor my being is my own—\nIt does not depend on others’ knowing or ignorance.\n\nFew know me—\nThus my value remains unchanged to me.\n\nTherefore, the Sage dons the most humble rags,\nYet within holds the most noble jade—\nHe obscures his presence in the mountains and forests,\nHides himself in rocky caves—\nOnly to align with the principles of nature and life,\nTo harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s *Dao*,\nAnd to cultivate what lies within himself.\nWhether others recognize or deny him,\nHe cares not in the least.\n\nThis is why the wise grow ever wiser,\nAnd the foolish grow ever more foolish.\n\nThe words of the Supreme Sage (*太上*) are *Dao* in every line,\nAnd every character speaks to the self.\n\nTo speak of *Dao* is to speak of humanity,\nTo speak of humanity is to speak of the *Dao*—\nNothing could be easier than this.\n\nSo why are there those who find it difficult to know or practice?\n\nIt is because the ignorant seek the *Dao* afar,\nYet it lies near—\nThey seek what is easy as difficult,\nAnd what is simple as complex.\n\nThey do not attend to the true and constant *Dao*,\nBut instead chase after dross and remnants—\nLike the study of rhetoric, memorization, legal codes, or divination—\nThe more they learn, the more their minds stray,\nThe more affairs they handle, the more their nature deteriorates.\nNo wonder the words of the Supreme Sage\nAre understood by all in their time,\nYet only the Supreme Sage understands them in later ages.\n\nIt is because they fail to grasp\nThat words have a *root*,\nAnd affairs have a *master*.\n\nThis *root* and *master*—\nThey are the “**middle**” (*中*) of humanity itself.\n\nWhen Yao and Shun passed on the *Dao*,\nIt was nothing but “**Hold fast to this middle**” (*允执厥中*).\n\nLater, the teachings of Confucius on “**purity and unity**” (*纯一*),\nOf the *Zhongyong* on “**solitary vigilance**” (*慎独*),\nAnd of the *Kō* School on “**innate knowledge**” (*良知*),\nAre all but variations of the human “**middle**.”\n\nThis single character “**middle**” (*中*)\nEncompasses much.\n\nWithin humanity, it is twofold:\nOne guards the *middle* of form—\nZhu Xi says: “**Guard the middle to regulate the outside.**”\nTo guard the *middle* is to turn light inward,\nTo focus attention on what is central.\nAt the point one inch below the navel,\nNeither clinging nor rejecting—this is it.\n\nOne guards the *middle* of the formless—\nThe *Zhongyong* says: *“Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise, this is the **middle**.”*\nLuó Cóngyàn taught Lǐ Yánpíng:\n“Observe the *middle* in stillness,\nAnd the phenomena of joy, anger, sorrow, or delight—\nIn this unarisen state,\nNeither heard nor seen,\nWith reverent caution and fear—\nThen nature settles and the mind clears,\nAnd one sees the original face.\nThen human desires grow pure,\nAnd Heaven’s principle shines bright.\nFrom ancient times, sages, immortals, Buddhas,\nAll took this as the first step of practice.\nBut one must first guard the *middle* with strenuous effort,\nAnd finally attain the *middle* in pure nature.”\n\nThe three sages have different names,\nYet all take the “**middle**” (*中*) as their *root*,\nAs their *master*.\n\nEven as I teach,\nConcentrating the mind and harmonizing the breath—\nThen one turns inward to observe the original orifice,\nThe mind devoid of its own mind,\nThe *qi* devoid of its own *qi*—\nOnly then does one achieve peace of mind and harmony of breath.\nPeace of mind brings concentration,\nHarmony of breath brings regulation.\nThe essence lies only in the two words: *peace of mind*.\n\nWhen the mind does not stir—\nThis is *peace*.\nTo hold fast to the *middle*—\nThis is *peace*.\n*Peace* is within this *middle*.」\n\nThe heart abides here—this is the **mysterious orifice** (*玄關*) of the **elixir scriptures** (*丹經*).\nWhen **Dao/Way** (*神*) and **qi** (*氣*) become interdependent,\nThe essence of the **mysterious orifice** is established,\nThis is the *root* of the **Great Dao** (*大道*), the *origin* of the **golden elixir** (*金丹*).\n\nAs in **refining fire** (*進火*) and **withdrawing talismans** (*退符*),\n**Transporting and refining** (*搬運*) the **river vehicle** (*河車*),\nAll **actions** (*有為*) and **endeavors** (*有作*)\nUltimately value **modesty** (*謙*), **gentleness** (*和*), **softness** (*柔*), and **docility** (*順*).\n**Compose** (*以整*) and **rest** (*以暇*), neither **aiding** nor **forgetting**.\n**Essential matters** (*有要*) return to the **non-dual** (*無*),\nYet the **non-dual** (*無*) again gives rise to **duality** (*有*).\nWhen **duality** and **non-duality** cease to stand,\nOnly then does one align with the **natural Dao** (*天然道體*).\n\nThis is the attainment of **oneness** (*一*)—\nAll matters complete—\nThe **Way** of my teaching: **\"One penetrates all\"** (*一以貫之*).\n\nIf scholars understand this,\nThey may solve the **Laozi’s** (*太上*) **lightness** (*輕*),\nAnd avoid being misled by **heterodox paths** (*旁門左道*).\n\nIf one does not know the **root** (*有宗*) of speech,\nThe **master** (*有君*) of practice,\nOne may not be permitted to enter the hall—\nYet be lost in other pursuits.\n\nWhen one knows this and acts accordingly,\nNaturally there will be attainment within,\nNo longing for the external.\nLike the **sage** (*聖人*) **wearing coarse robes yet harboring jade** (*被褐怀玉*),\nYet **radiant and unrestrained** (*融融泄泄*) without end.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: The Superiority of Knowing the Unknown**\n*\"Knowing the unknown\"* (*知不知*), superior;\n\n「Not knowing what one knows is an affliction.\nOnly by recognizing this affliction—\nDoes one truly escape it.\n\nThe sage is free from affliction,\nFor he recognizes his affliction—\nThus, he is free from it.\n\nHis wisdom shines like a dustless mirror,\nStill waters without ripples—\nAll things reflected, none evading its light.\n\nThis divine clarity is innate,\nNaturally knowing through phenomena,\nAs the heart perceives them.\nNot conjecturing to claim insight,\nNor guessing to feign knowledge.\n\nHis knowing arises from the self-luminous nature,\nNot from preordained foresight,\nYet he discerns what others cannot.\n\nThis is the wisdom of the supreme sage—\nBeyond the reach of common men.\n\nOrdinary minds cannot penetrate truth,\nNor illuminate phenomena.\nThey speculate on others’ sincerity,\nAnticipate the rise and fall of affairs—\nIf by chance they guess correctly,\nMen praise their mirror-like clarity,\nAnd they boast of their divine discernment.\n\nSuch contrived knowledge is not divine illumination,\nBut forcing ignorance into knowledge:\nThough they claim understanding,\nTheir weary minds and labored thoughts\nAre already deeply afflicted—\nSelf-made cleverness,\nSelf-draining vital essence.\n\nOnly by recognizing forced knowledge as affliction,\nDoes one cure what ails them.\nThus, they investigate truth to fulfill their nature,\nCultivate their essence to await Heaven’s timing.\nWise yet unassuming,\nIntelligent yet appearing foolish,\nTheir minds become empty as water,\nTheir nature clear as ice,\nA single luminous spirit,\nPiercing through the Three Thousand Worlds—\nWhy endure the toil of scheming,\nThe labor of artifice, as burdens?\n\nThus, they are free from affliction.\n\nThe sage’s insight penetrates all affairs,\nHis wisdom encompasses all things.\nHe possesses innate enlightenment,\nLacks no conjectural guesswork.\n\nCommon men are afflicted,\nBut the sage is not—\nFor he afflicts his ignorance,\nAfflicts his obscurity,\nAnd thus, with wholehearted devotion,\nHe gathers all within the Mysterious Pass.\nWith time, his luminous spirit blazes forth,\nIlluminating without remainder—\nEver present, ever advantageous,\nNowhere hindered.\n\nBecause he afflicts his affliction,\nHe is free from affliction.\n\nThis is the knowing of enlightened wisdom—\nThe highest attainment.\nYet contrived knowledge is a grave peril.\nOnly by recognizing forced knowing as affliction,\nDoes one escape affliction entirely.\n\nThe sage’s freedom from peril lies in\nTreating this peril as peril—\nThus, he knows no peril.\n\nThe essence is now clear—\nNo further elaboration is needed.»\n\nNow let me unfold the subtleties of the Dao more fully:\n\nIn general, when seated in meditation, one must first depart from the mundane to cultivate *zhì* (定), striking a single resonant note before self-examining and self-verifying. If indeed there is nothing at all—empty and void—then the mind is clarified and nature is seen.\n\nThus I have often said: At the outset of seated stillness, this mind hangs suspended in the boundless void. Only when body and mind are settled, and intention and *qi* harmonized, may one gradually gather and reflect inward upon the original palace.\n\nWhen nothing remains within the chest, and one awakens to this luminous awareness, then the ten directions and three realms are all encompassed within this awakening perception.\n\nYet the nature of awakening neither arises nor perishes—it is simply clear and self-illuminating, as it ever was.\n\nIf one seeks the Mysterious through this, the source becomes utterly pure, and may serve as the foundation for my elixir’s formation.\n\nIn an instant, the innate light naturally manifests.\n\nHow does one recognize this? Within that former state of vague and indistinct perception—when suddenly awakening and moving, this marks the essential beginning of Dao cultivation.\n\nYet to govern emotions with nature—if one does not first uncover the true essence of nature itself, and instead plunges blindly into the watery depths seeking the Mysterious, how can one govern emotions when nature is already lost?\n\nFor there exists a primal, vibrant vitality of the spirit.\n\nKnow that *Lí* (離) does not belong to the mind: when one concentrates auditory resonance, contains visual radiance, restrains the senses of scent, taste, and touch—these are all the workings of divine fire, hence it is called *Lí*.\n\n*Kǎn* (坎) is not *qi*: wherever vital essence resides, that is *Kǎn*.\n\nEven if divine essence enters the blood, and fire heats the waters, this does not necessarily stir *qi*—one must lift from left and right, gathering the waves from the abyssal depths, guiding them upward to the elixir field. Through prolonged refinement, when the fire is sufficient, suddenly the celestial mechanism activates, and the body leaps in ecstasy, from fingertips to every limb, trembling ceaselessly.\n\nThe body stands rigid as a wall, the mind cold as ashes. When the elixir field’s *qi* grows warm, this is the balanced state—neither too hot nor too cool—of the fire’s union.\n\nIf this phenomenon does not appear, the fire is still too weak and must not be applied. If one persists in this state without igniting the fire, the *qi* will already have dissipated by the time one attempts it—this is the peril of aged, useless medicine. Students must discern this carefully.\n\nYet when the subtle yang first stirs, it may not yet produce such vigorous *qi*. As long as the mind is tranquil and intention at ease, and breathing harmonized, one may still practice the *Zi-Wu* (子午) River Vehicle.\n\nFor the body’s formed and substantial blood, unrefined by fire, remains murky and stagnant—a mass of lifeless sludge. Only when divine fire illuminates does a single point of true *qi* emerge within the blood.\n\nThis is as the Buddha said: *\"In this defiled and impure age, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe ancients also spoke of *\"taking treasure from the ghost’s nest, seeking lead beneath the black mountain\"*—all referring to the same process: within the turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines this single point of true *qi*.\n\nOnce *qi* moves, yang arises. One must then know the laws of *Zi* advancing yang and *Wu* retreating yin, along with the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* (卯酉) bathing, to extract this true yang and circulate it freely. Internally, it dispels the hidden yin of the viscera; externally, it attracts the celestial true yang’s vital *qi*.\n\nWith prolonged practice, even the substance of *qi* transforms.\n\nThis River Vehicle method holds boundless profundity.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"When the *qi* is clear, the Zi-Wu River is drawn and added\"*—drawing refers to extracting lead from the watery depths, adding refers to supplementing mercury from the *Lí* palace.\n\nMercury is the luminous fluid of the mind—the later heaven within the earlier heaven. From the colored body’s turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines it into sweet dew—this is lead, the *qi* within the blood.\n\nThis *qi* is what the ancients called *\"gold within the water\"*—it belongs to the later heaven within the earlier heaven, sufficient only to stabilize the mundane, not to generate the Dharma body.\n\nThis is the medicine produced by the union of *Kǎn* and *Lí*, yet it is still not the true elixir.\n\nOne must govern emotions with nature, return nature to nature, and when nature and emotions harmonize, refine them together in the *Kūn* (坤) furnace. Suddenly, true yang erupts—this is the union of *Qián* (乾) and *Kūn*, and only then does one forge the divine elixir into a true immortal.\n\nIn summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the ceaseless turning of the River Vehicle.\n\nAt the lower pass, the River must be forced;\nAt the middle pass, the River Vehicle arises from both human and celestial;\nAt the upper pass, the River Vehicle flows purely of its own accord, never failing in its timing.\n\nAs for the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* bathing, these are only for beginners lest their minds grow restless and the fire flare unchecked. When one reaches mastery, no methods are needed.\n\nIt all depends on the student’s divine illumination.\n\nChapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear the **Way**’s **威**\n\nThe people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.\n\nDo not confine their dwelling, do not weary of their birth.\n\nFor it is only through not wearying that one does not weary.\n\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself, loves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nHence, one discards that and embraces this.\n\nThe **威** spoken of is the grand framework of **纲常名教** (social norms and moral teachings), the most difficult transgression of **天理** (Heavenly Principle).\n\nLet them know to be cautious in solitude, even in bed and shadow,\nTo fear the **威** of Heaven in its hidden subtleties—\nThen naturally, Heaven’s blessings will be pure and abundant,\nAnd their longevity will know no bounds.\n\nThe *Shijing* (Book of Odes) says:\n*\"Fear the **威** of Heaven,\nAnd it will preserve you in due time.\"*\n\nIf the **威** of Heaven looms near like a foot’s length,\nYet one does not remain vigilant and clear each morning,\nIt will lead to the collapse of propriety and the extinction of rites—\nThen Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience) will vanish,\nHeaven’s **天罚** (retribution) will not be spared,\nAnd disasters will not be avoided,\nLife will not be preserved.\n\nThus, the people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.\n\nIf such is the case,\nIt is because they do not know that **知仁** (knowing virtue) is their secure abode,\nYet they abandon this abode and do not dwell within it;\nThat **义** (righteousness) is the source of **生气** (life force),\nYet they forsake this life force and bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nAlas! Those people are unfortunate,\nBorn not into the age of **太古** (Primordial Antiquity),\nWhere **德威** (virtue and awe) are feared,\nAnd **德明** (virtue and clarity) are held in reverence—\nThus they act with external transgressions and ignorance,\nHeaven’s signs are neglected,\nAnd drought, flood, pestilence, and famine arise—\nDisasters of all kinds flourish.\n\nOnly the ruler above should guide them with the vast dwelling of **天下** (the world),\nAnd let them wander in the realm of **太和** (Great Harmony),\nNot confining them in narrowness,\nYet daily treading upon the brink of peril and annihilation;\nShould draw them with **浩然** (boundless) **正气** (right qi),\nAnd let them nourish it in the **清虚** (pure and empty) **天** (Heaven),\nNot wearying of their birth,\nYet risking to fall into ruin and cessation.\n\nIt is only through cherishing the principle of their own life,\nAnd preserving Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience),\nWithout the slightest weariness or exhaustion,\nThat one attains the *Shijing*’s words:\n*\"Revere Heaven’s wrath,\nAnd do not dare trifle with it;\nRevere Heaven’s decrees,\nAnd do not dare neglect them.\"*\n\nHeaven observes their **德** (virtue),\nAnd grants them brilliance and prosperity,\nLongevity and preservation—\nIndeed, there exists one who shares in Heaven and Earth’s eternal duration.\nThus, it is through not wearying that this is achieved.\n\nWho but the sage could accomplish this?\n\nThe ancient emperors cultivated humility and non-action,\nIlluminated great **德** (virtue/power),\nDaily refining and monthly perfecting,\nPurifying their hearts and clearing their thoughts,\nPenetrating the marvels of **造化** (creation and transformation),\nPiercing the clarity of **本来之天** (the original Heaven),\nOnly knowing themselves in truth.\n\nAs for **德业文章** (virtuous deeds and literary attainments),\nThe external marks they bear—\nThe sage never uses them to display or reveal himself to others.\n\nMoreover, they revered the **乾** (Qian) at dawn and the **坤** (Kun) at dusk,\nHeavily upheld the **Dao/Way** and guarded their bodies,\nNever for a breath departing from **仁** (benevolence),\nAnd the world could not add anything to them.\n\nHow did they love themselves?—\nAs for fame, rank, reputation, and glory—\nThe things others hold in high regard,\nThe sage never considered them worthy of exaltation.\n\nThough the sage’s own self-knowledge and self-love\nAre the same as what all people know and love—\nIt is only that common people, knowing it, must make it manifest,\nLoving it, must hold it in high esteem;\nThe sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTheir caution in solitude is profound,\nYet they do not indulge in ostentation before the world;\nThey uphold self-nourishment,\nYet they do not dare to boast of it.\n\nHow could they be compared with common people?\n\nIt is said that by discarding desire and embracing principle,\nBy fulfilling humanity’s potential in harmony with Heaven,\nOne ascends to transcend the mortal and attain sainthood,\nTo sever resemblance and depart from the crowd,\nAnd become an immortal enduring millions of years—\nAll this arises from knowing the vast dwelling’s security,\nCherishing the eternal life’s joy,\nFocusing solely on this and not on that,\nAnd the people naturally move toward goodness, unaware of their own doing.\n\nAbandon this, how could such goodness be achieved?\n\nThese words mean:\nDo not confine their dwelling—then their dwelling will be grand.\nDo not weary of their birth—then their birth will be long.\n\nHowever, in the cultivation process,\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) must be understood.\n\nWhen a person first receives **气** (qi),\nAt the moment of union between father and mother,\nA single **黍珠** (millet-sized pearl) is formed—\nAt this time, it is **絪絪缊缊** (unformed and indistinct),\nA mere cluster of **太和** (Great Harmony) **气** (qi),\nWith no trace of knowledge.\n\nYet, it is the most divine and wondrous essence,\nExhausting all transformations and producing endless worldly affairs—\nAll from this single **含灵** (life-containing) **气** (qi) **神** (spirit),\nFrom **无知无识** (no knowledge, no perception) to **有知有识** (knowledge and perception),\nFrom **无作无为** (no action, no doing) to **有作有为** (action and doing),\nNone of which are not initiated here.\n\nAt this stage, **天人一理** (Heaven and humanity are one principle),\n**物我同源** (things and self share the same origin),\n**体用兼赅** (substance and function are inseparable),\nAnd **显微无间** (manifest and subtle are continuous)—\nThus, it is called the **元神** (Original Spirit).\n\nThis is what Heaven bestows.\n\nWhen the blood and flesh take form,\nTen months within the womb,\nA cry at birth—\nThe infant emerges, and the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) begins to manifest.\n\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) is the **元气** (Primordial Qi) of **先天** (pre-heaven),\nShared by Heaven, Earth, and all beings,\nHidden within the **太虚** (Great Void).\nOnce it enters the human body,\nIt is concealed in the **虚无窟子** (void-like cavity) within the person.\nThis is Heaven’s gift.\n\nThose who cultivate seek not to grasp at emptiness or color in their pursuit.\nOnly through **无所知** (no knowledge) and **无所有** (no possession),\nSweeping away all dust and turbidity,\nDoes the inner essence reveal itself,\nAnd the divine mystery arise.\n\nAs for the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit),\nIt is the **精灵** (refined essence) **鬼** (spirit) of the human body,\nThe seed of endless **轮回** (reincarnations).\nIt requires the five senses and the complete formation of the ten thousand limbs,\nOnly when the person is about to be born and descend to earth,\nDoes the refined essence’s **魂魄** (soul and vital force) find attachment.\n\nThe ancients called this the **后天识神** (post-heaven Perceptive Spirit),\nBecause it arises from the formed **魄** (vital force).\n\nThis is the fundamental distinction between **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).\n\nYet after birth,\nThe two spirits—**元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit)—\nMerge into one.\n\nSometimes the **元神** (Original Spirit) is active,\nAnd the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) recedes in silence—\nThough the **后天** (post-heaven) **意气** (intentions and emotions) may stir,\nThey all arise from **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom),\nAnd manifest as **喜怒哀乐** (joy, anger, sorrow, delight).\nThe **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) also transforms into the **元神** (Original Spirit).\n\nSometimes the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) is active,\nAnd the **元神** (Original Spirit) is concealed—\nThough traces of **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom) appear,\nThey all become **私恩、私爱、私憎、私嫌** (private favors, private affections, private hatreds, private suspicions).\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) also transforms into the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).\n\nThe **Perceptive Spirit** alone governs the body and senses—\nOnce it takes charge, how could there be purity and rectitude\nTo undertake deeds worthy of Heaven and Earth,\nOr confront the spirits of the numinous?\n\nOnly in the boundless void, when the Spirit stirs at a single impulse,\nDoes Heavenly Principle remain untainted—\nNo trace of post-heaven perception mingles within.\nIf one steadies the footing here and proceeds with unwavering resolve,\nThen one is purely Heavenly Principle,\nWith not a thread of human desire’s private schemes.\n\nThus I teach: when in ignorance and unawareness,\nSeek the single aperture of the **Mystic Pass**—\nFor then one is one with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd harmonized with the boundless void.\n\nIf one seizes this and presses forward,\nThen the generative flow of Heaven and Earth\nNeed not be borrowed—it arises from within.\nThe transformations of the void\nNeed not be borrowed—its mysteries unfold from within.\nThis awakening is truly the root of Heaven, Earth, and Man.\n\nIf cultivators do not begin here,\nWhere else shall they ascend to sagehood and transcendence?\n\nIn sum:\nWhat emerges without thought or deliberation—**Original Spirit**.\nWhat arises with schemes, judgments, and from the colored form—**Perceptive Spirit**.\nThe **Original Spirit** is formless; the **Perceptive Spirit** leaves traces.\nOne originates from the void; one emerges from the colored body—\nThese two are utterly dissimilar.\n\nOnce it is clear that the **Original Spirit** arises from the void,\nAnd the **Perceptive Spirit** from the colored form,\nThen I return to the root and clear the source,\nStriving to seal the inner and outer **Three Treasures**,\nNot permitting a single perception or thought\nTo emerge from form, image, deliberation, or awareness.\n\nIf one cultivates thus, if one nurtures thus,\nOver time, even the soul of the corpse will transmute into pure **Original Spirit**,\nAnd the eighty-four thousand hairs will become protective **Spiritual Warriors**.\nThis is what is meant by\n*\"Transforming Perception into Originality,\nConverting Yin into Yang.\"*\n\nThis lies in anchoring oneself in the void,\nNot allowing the colored body to dictate perception.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Three: Unsummoned, It Comes**\n\n*\"Bold in daring brings death;\nBold in restraint brings life.\"*\nThese two—sometimes advantageous, sometimes harmful.\nWhat Heaven abhors, who can fathom its reason?\nThus even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nThe **Dao of Heaven** conquers without striving,\nResponds without speaking,\nArrives without being summoned—\nOpen and yet masterfully plotting.\n*\"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread.\"*\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The Mandate of Heaven—\nAh, its solemnity never ceases!\"*\nHe who steals Heaven and Earth’s **qi** to forge the Elixir\nSteals from the solemn, unceasing Mandate of Heaven.\n\nThis Mandate, in Heaven, is the pure and void **qi**;\nIn Man, it is the **Great Harmony** of **Heavenly Principle**.\nOnly by direct cultivation from dawn’s first light,\nUntil the **Overflowing Virtue** fills the two extremes,\nDoes one return to the root and restore the Mandate—\nAscending and descending, flowing with Heaven and Earth alike.\n\nHow does one cultivate?\nFirst, in **killing false thoughts**—\nFalse thoughts must be firm,\nUnyielding to external things,\nSo that **Right Qi** may always expand.\nSecond, in **nurturing true thoughts**—\nTrue thoughts must be yielding,\nFor yielding can delight all hearts,\nSo that **Overflowing Virtue** may always congeal.\n\nThese two—\nThe relentless, daring force of *\"killing\"* is the **mechanism of death**.\nThe hesitant, weak submission of *\"not daring\"* is the **vitality of life**.\n*\"Bold in daring brings death\"*—this is the foundation of retreat as advance,\nOf defeat as the root of victory.\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"At high noon, the sun declines;\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes.\"*\nHeaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness move with the times—\nSometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful,\nOften contrary to the world’s expectations.\nThus what Man rejoices in, Heaven may abhor.\n\nMoreover, what does Heaven truly abhor?\nThe **Heavenly One’s** heart cherishes life,\nYet sometimes employs death;\nThe **Supreme Deity’s** intent upholds virtue,\nYet sometimes enforces punishment.\nThis is life within death, death within life—\nIts meaning profound, beyond mortal comprehension.\nWhat Heaven abhors, who can know its reason?\n\nThus the Sage, cultivating the **Dao**,\nKnows that fortune is the foundation of calamity,\nThat yielding is the substance of firmness,\nAnd balances extremes while holding to the mean.\nAbandoning self-interest, they guard the **Right Way**,\nNot contending with the vulgar over gain or loss,\nBut discerning only their own compliance or defiance.\n\nAs for bestowing calamity or blessing,\nGranting good fortune or misfortune—\nEven the Sage finds it difficult to divine,\nLet alone those beneath.\n\nThe **Dao of the Sage** is the **Dao of Heaven**.\nThe Sage acts purely in accordance with Nature,\nWhile advancement, retreat, ascent, and descent\nFlow within the body’s transformations.\nHeaven’s **Dao** acts without action, in accordance with Nature,\nWhile generation, growth, withdrawal, and storage\nEver circulate beyond the void—\nThus it does not contend with all things for dominance,\nYet life and death hover ever near,\nAnd none can defy its reach—\nThis is conquering without striving.\n\nIt does not speak of principle to the common folk,\nYet its blessings and calamities extend everywhere—\nNo place escapes its reach—\nThis is responding without speaking.\n\nThough its timing may vary—\nSwift or slow, heavy or light—\nThere is an unseen balance,\nA power beyond mortal design.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Unsummoned, it comes;\nOpen, yet masterfully plotting.\"*\n\nNo matter how brilliant one’s talent,\nOr how cunning one’s schemes,\nIf the heart is exposed, all pretense is futile.\n*\"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread.\"*\nThis is no falsehood.\n\nTo suppress desire requires decisiveness—\nWithout decisiveness, the heart runs wild,\nAnd human desires cling tenaciously—\nThus *\"bold in daring brings death\"*—\nThis is the killing of the human heart.\n\nTo preserve Principle requires yielding—\nWithout yielding, vulgar **qi** becomes violent,\nAnd **Original Qi** falters—\nThus *\"bold in restraint brings life\"*—\nThis is the vitality of the **Original Spirit**.\n\nYet the **mechanism of death** and the **vitality of life** mutually aid each other.\nThe human heart is easy to kill;\nThe **Dao-heart** is easy to nurture—\nYet within lies the **Dao of Heaven**.\n\nThe **Heavenly Dao** bestows both punishment and virtue, life and death in common use.\nThough some may grasp this, few comprehend how life’s potential lies within death’s grasp,\nOr vitality’s hidden within the **mechanism of death**—\nThe world struggles to perceive such subtleties.\n\nWho truly knows what Heaven abhors?\nThe Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nUnderstanding that what Heaven abhors must be what it loves—\nFor *\"without abhorrence, there can be no true love.\"*\nThis cyclic interplay of wondrous function,\nEven the Sage finds difficult to fathom.\n\nYet the Sage’s **Dao** is but Heaven’s **Dao**.\nHeaven does not dispute right and wrong with the common folk,\nBut nurtures all things—\nNone escape its warmth and favor,\nNor stray against its will.\n\nHeaven does not speak of **sensing and responding**,\nYet yin and yang alternate in motion—\nNone fail to harmonize in silent accord,\nNor stray against its will.\n\nTruly, **Heaven and humanity share the same Dao**—\nMotionless yet responsive,\nTransformative in its divine mystery!\nAll things spring from the same source,\nBoundless and impartial—\nWhen things come, it responds;\nHow could actions be more precise?\n\nThe **Perfect One** with **unthinking, unworried sincerity**,\nSilently wields **divine function** at the crossroads of life and death,\nStealthily seizes **Heaven’s mechanism** within the **Palace of Creation**,\nDescending into the **Watery Realm**,\nShaping the **Golden Land**,\nFollowing the **Hidden and the Strange**,\nSevering sight and sound—\nDeath becomes life, life becomes death;\nAt first, none know how they intermingle and respond,\nLike mother and child, husband and wife—\nThey come without summons, unite without scheme.\n\nIs this not the swiftness of **sensing and responding**,\nAnd the divine mystery?\n\nEven calamities and blessings are bestowed or taken away,\nFortune and misfortune are fixed or corrupt—\n*\"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread,\"*\nTruly, none can escape or evade it.\nFor **emptiness and space are the Dao**,\nAnd **Dao is Heaven**—\nOne cannot evade emptiness,\nNor escape the **Heavenly Net**.\n\nIf humanity does not defy the **Dao**, it does not defy Heaven—\nThen how could Heaven cease to nourish them?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can one frighten them with death?\n\nIf I made the people always fear death as something extraordinary,\nI could seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\nThere are always those who execute punishment and kill.\nTo substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,\nIs like substituting for the **Great Carpenter** to hew—\nTo substitute for the **Great Carpenter** to hew,\nFew would not harm their own hands.\n\nIn ancient times, those who governed the world\nMust have followed what easily moved the people’s emotions,\nAnd preemptively guarded against it.\nThey did not follow the ruler’s joys or sorrows,\nBut only observed the people’s likes and dislikes,\nGuiding them along their natural inclinations—\nThus their teachings succeeded without severity,\nAnd their governance thrived without excessive measures.\n\nIf the people abandoned moral norms and violated propriety,\nDaring to transgress the established order,\nYet held no fear of death,\nThen even with the **Five Punishments** displayed on the **Torture Stakes**,\nAnd proclaimed on auspicious days,\nIt would be in vain to establish them—\nOf no use to the state or the people—\nWould this not be a waste of effort?\n\nOnly by leveraging the people’s love of life and fear of death,\nAnd daring to act deceitfully or maliciously,\nWould I then follow and kill them—\nThis is what is meant by *\"strike one to warn a hundred,\"*\nAnd *\"inflict few punishments yet inspire great sincerity.\"*\n\nThus the people, from father to son, from elder to younger brother,\nWould not dare to act as stepping stones to chaos—\nThey would fear self-destruction and embrace death.\n\nYet though the killing is done by those above,\nThe reason for killing depends on the person.\nOnly the **most virtuous** kill the **most unvirtuous**,\nAnd the people themselves kill the unvirtuous without mercy,\nFinding death sweet.\n\nMencius said: *\"Only Heaven’s officers can be killed\"*—\nFor **Heaven’s officers** are those who may kill others.\n\nIf one is not a **Heaven’s officer**,\nYet kills with violent retribution,\nThis is to govern chaos with chaos—\nNot only does the people’s chaos worsen,\nBut to substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,\nIs like a mere craftsman wielding the axe to shape the wind,\nOr swinging the blade to carve wheels—\nCould such a one master the divine artistry and achieve perfection?\n\nObserving craftsmen and scholars of past and present,\nIf they cannot equal the **Great Carpenter**,\nYet substitute to hew,\nWho has not harmed their own hands?\n\nAlas, the people are unfortunate—\nNot born in an age of **Dao**,\nThus bandits and thieves, deceitful and treacherous,\nHave no restraint.\nAnd even more unfortunate,\nThey do not encounter those who execute punishment—\nThen where would they find guidance?\nIf the thin become even thinner,\nAnd the thick also thin,\nIs this not deeply lamentable?\n\n「Thus, using the fear of death to illustrate the caution of solitude—\nA person’s diligence in solitude is profound,\nThen the distinction between Heaven and man becomes clear,\nAnd the separation of desires and principles is manifest.\nThough desires are few and faults not yet committed,\nAnd one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—\nIn this, one is ever vigilant and earnest,\nDreading the slightest lapse,\nStriving to suppress falsehood and deceit,\nIt is not difficult to purify desires and refine principles,\nAnd instantly reveal the **original face of nature**.\n\nIf, in places unseen and unheard,\nOne lacks daily cultivation of moral restraint and self-nurturing,\nYet at moments when desires surge and emotions overwhelm,\nOne attempts to uproot evil and sudden sees **True Nature**,\nThen it is certain that evil will not be uprooted but will multiply,\nAnd the more one strives to cleanse the heart, the more it will be disturbed.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** said:\n*“If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death?”*\nReason and circumstance are thus interdependent—\nOnly by guarding against temptation in seclusion,\nHaving known the wrongness of desires,\nCan one restrain them in the moment,\nAnd thus return to the **natural order of the mind**.\n\nWhen one thought is swept away,\nAnd one thought is purified,\nEvil will not sprout anew from that moment.\nThis is why the people commonly fear death,\nYet those who act strangely—\nIf I seize them and execute them,\nWho would dare to rebel or disrespect,\nOr violate the **proper order of relationships**?\n\nIndeed, the **Dao/Way** drives out the lack of **Dao/Way**,\nJust as a ruler soothes and governs all subjects,\nCommanding the common folk,\nUsing supreme mercy to kill those without mercy,\nAnd great righteousness to punish the unrighteous—\nNaturally, none who submit will remain secure,\nNear ones will be pleased while distant ones will come,\nAnd none will turn their weapons against their rulers,\nOr strike back in rebellion,\nTo become enemies or cause harm.\n\nScholars who wish to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,\nTo return to their roots and restore their origin,\nMust suppress evil **gradually**,\nAnd maintain constancy **steadfastly**,\nSo that when one opening is illuminated,\nAll openings will be **vital and responsive**,\nAnd the **original spirit** will be at peace,\nObedient to its natural commands.\nAs it is said:\n*“If a person can remain ever pure and clear,\nThen all of Heaven and Earth will naturally return to them”*;\nAnd again:\n*“If a person can correct their spirit in one moment,\nThen all evils will not dare to intrude.”*\n\nThis is akin to how those who execute punishment\nCan kill without resentment,\nAnd the condemned will meet their fate with acceptance—\nThe same **natural Dao/Way**,\nA rare and wondrous effect.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: The Virtuous Excel in Not Valuing Life**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation,\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ meddling,\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ obsession with prolonging life,\nThus they treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their pursuit\nAre truly virtuous in excelling beyond valuing life.\nFrom ancient times, the people are the foundation of the state,\nAnd food is the **Heavenly necessity** for the people.\nA state without people is a state without support—\nWho will uphold it?\nThe people without food cannot survive—\nHow will they live?\nThus, for those who rule over others,\nThere must be those who open fields and cultivate land,\nDeepening the **roots of abundance** before the people have need;\nAnd those who establish rites and regulate changes,\nControlling the **flow of excess** after the people have eaten;\nAs well as those who reduce labor to fill shortages,\nAnd curtail waste to aid insufficiency—\nThen the people will naturally be well-fed and content,\nWithout the **cries of the starving** in the ninth month,\nOr the **lamentations of famine**.\n\nEven if droughts persist and famines recur,\nYet if the granaries are filled,\nThere will be no fear of calamity.\n\nBut in this world, rulers are often arrogant and licentious,\nTheir extravagance growing daily:\nSome indulge in rare delicacies and curiosities for amusement,\nOthers build jade towers and palaces to gratify their desires—\nOften the granaries are emptied,\nYet expenditures never decrease.\nEven basic provisions are lacking,\nAnd they impose additional levies:\nFirst, they add taxes and increase tolls,\nYet still the people fear their **oppressive burdens**;\nNext, they plunder and extort without restraint,\nIgnoring even **Heaven’s command**.\n\nTheir love for music and beauty is paramount,\nTheir luxury and excess ever escalating.\nThey drain the **vital essence** of all the people,\nTo satiate their own **licentiousness**.\nEven when the state’s treasury is exhausted,\nTheir demands for tribute never slacken.\n\nHeaven and Earth produce wealth,\nOnly in these limited amounts.\nIf such **harsh extortion** continues without end,\nAnd the people are taken without measure—\nEven if there are frequent **abundant harvests**,\nAnd years of **prosperity and blessing**,\nHow can one expect the people to not hunger?\n\nIn the age of **Zhuāng Lóng**,\nClothing was worn and food was eaten,\nHouses were dwelt in and fields were tilled,\nEach cherishing their own kin,\nEach nurturing their own elders.\nThe **noble ones** had no need to inquire about rites and propriety,\nYet naturally dwelled in **Ren** and followed **Yì**;\nThe **common folk** had no fondness for loyalty and sincerity,\nYet naturally found joy in their work and peace in their homes.\nIndeed, the rulers governed through **non-action**,\nAnd the people transformed themselves through **non-action**.\nCustoms were not artificially made pure, yet they were pure,\nAnd the **folkways** did not seek antiquity, yet they were ancient.\nHow harmonious and flourishing was that era!\n\nBut afterward, as **laws and regulations** multiplied,\nAnd the **folkways** grew ever more **deviant and subtle**,\nAs **statutes and decrees** were frequently proclaimed,\nAnd **bandits and thieves** became ever more rampant—\nNot only under tyrannical rulers,\nBut even among **wise and enlightened kings**,\nWho strove with vigor to govern,\nExerted their utmost in statecraft,\nAnd whose policies grew ever more complex—\nThe more elaborate the laws, the more deceit arose,\nThe stricter the decrees, the more cunning flourished.\nIs this not because **qi and techniques** cannot be reversed,\nOr **Heaven’s will** cannot be altered?\nOr because they **fail to grasp the roots and foundational principles**,\nYet seek only superficial results?\n\nNot only does this fail to benefit the people’s livelihood,\nBut it **burdens the Way of the world**.\n\nThe people’s hearts are naturally at ease,\nYet rulers disturb them with **policies and commands**.\nThe people’s emotions are naturally without excess,\nYet rulers disrupt them with **rules and systems**.\nEvery additional **edict** from the court\nMultiplies **deceit** among the common folk,\nAnd every new **regulation**\nEncourages **clever evasion** among them.\n\nNo wonder the **Way of the world** becomes ever more **perverse**,\nAnd the people’s **moral inclinations** grow ever more **erratic**,\nMaking governance ever more difficult!\n\nOnly when the ruler sits **upright and still**,\nAnd extends their **virtuous influence** without action,\nWill the people below **naturally settle into order and obedience**.\nThe ruler and the people will be at peace in **Heaven’s non-action**—\nIs this not joy indeed?\n\nMoreover, those who **overvalue life** within\nWill labor their hearts ever more,\nAnd exhaust their **vital essence** ever further—\nTheir **spirit and qi** will dissipate,\nAnd their **life and fate** will perish,\nThe more they cling to life, the faster they die.\n\nThus, the more one **obsesses over life**,\nThe more lightly one treats death.\nOnly those who do not **honor life**,\nNor **prioritize its preservation**,\nWho dress and eat according to **natural circumstances**,\nAnd whose expenditures **do not contend with the world’s resources**,\nWill find their hearts at ease and their bodies secure,\nTheir **original nature** restored and their **fate prolonged**,\nAnd **endless blessings** forever enjoyed.»\n\nNurture the **Great Harmony** within,\nAnd invite **Heaven’s favor** upon yourself—\nHow much more virtuous than those who prize **artificial action**?\nThe **spirit** is the ruler, the **vital essence** the people.\nFollow the **constant Dao** in its natural course,\nWith **spirit** as sovereign, and **vital essence** obeying its command.\nThus, when the **spirit** wanders, the **vital essence** leaks away.\nThe depletion of **vital essence** stems from the **spirit’s** flight—\nLike the people’s hunger arising from excessive taxation by the ruler.\nThough their forms differ, their principles are one.\n\nThe **heart** is the sovereign of the body;\nWhen the **Heavenly Sovereign** is at ease,\nAll limbs follow its decree.\nBut if the **Heavenly Sovereign** is disturbed,\nThen the **vital essence and qi** of the whole body are drained—\nHow much more so when the fields are laid waste!\n\nThus, **Immortal Adepts** possess the art of **returning to the origin**,\nTaking **qi** as sovereign, while the **spirit** obeys its command—\nJust as a ruler follows the people’s desires and yields to their sentiments,\nSo that **qi** is abundant, the **spirit** complete,\nAnd the people at peace, the nation prosperous.\nThis is the way of **serving above by nourishing below**,\nOf **abundance above** supplementing **deficiency below**—\nTo govern the world as one’s own affair,\nRather than making oneself the world’s burden.\n\nThough the **Alchemical Dao** speaks of **action**,\nIt must first arise from **non-action**,\nThen return to **non-action** once more—\nOnly then does one grasp the **original Heavenly spirit and qi**,\nAnd ascend to **sainthood**, transcending the mundane.\nIf one clings entirely to **action**,\nThe **spirit** grows restless, and the **qi** weakens—\nInevitably, the more one refines, the more the **qi** scatters,\nThe more one labors, the more the **qi** disperses.\nOnly by guiding its momentum and acting in accordance with the times,\nIn governing oneself and the people alike,\nShould one hold such a view.\n\nIf one fears wealth will fail and life will perish,\nThen one exhausts **vital essence** and **spirit** in vain,\nHoping to preserve **postnatal life**,\nDay and night in torment, restless in sleep—\nMany a **spirit and qi** is thus consumed.\nYet **life and fate** are Heaven’s decree, not man’s to seek.\nA ruler who fears for those who cling to life\nOnly hastens them toward death’s embrace.\nOnly by not valuing the **limited postnatal life**,\nAnd instead preserving the **boundless prenatal fate**,\nCan one safeguard **original nature** and **fate**,\nAnd thus honor the body truly.\n\n**Chapter LXXVI: The Soft and Weak Take Preeminence**\nWhen a man is whole, he is soft and weak;\nWhen he dies, he becomes rigid and strong.\nGrasses and trees, when alive, are tender and pliable;\nWhen dead, they wither and decay.\nThus, the rigid and strong are companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are companions of life.\nHence, the strong in arms do not conquer,\nAnd the rigid in wood bends and breaks.\nThe strong and great must yield to the lowly,\nWhile the soft and weak ascend above.\n\nWhen man receives the **Yang Harmony qi**, he lives;\nWhen he encounters the **Yin Cold qi**, he dies.\nWhen the **Yang Harmony qi** gathers,\nThe four limbs grow supple, the body soft as silk,\nAnd life’s vitality flows unceasing.\nBut when the **Yin Cold qi** congeals,\nThe flesh grows dry and parched, the skin withers and falls away—\nAnd the **qi of death** approaches.\n\nObserve the pot and steamer:\nWhen steaming, the **Yang qi** rises in mist,\nAnd all things dissolve and transform.\nBut in freezing cold, they harden and stiffen.\nObserve the earth in spring and summer:\nWhen **Yang qi** thrives, all things flourish and grow—\nNone fail to bloom and thrive.\nBut in autumn and winter, when **Yin qi** prevails,\nAll things wither and fall—\nNone escape decay.\n\nMan and all things share a single source;\nThere is no division between them.\nThus, in all things under Heaven,\nThe rigid and strong are companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are companions of life.\n\nTake warfare as an example:\nOften the strong are defeated, the weak victorious—\nAs when **Ziyou**’s overbearing strength led to ruin,\nAnd **Bibi**’s yielding tactics triumphed at **Rand**.\nWhy is this?\nBecause the strong grow exhausted in their vigor,\nWhile the weak harbor the seeds of revival—\nThus, they cannot prevail.\n\nObserve the trees:\nThough wood is strong, when **Yin qi** dominates and **Yang qi** wanes,\nIt is bound and broken—\nNo longer capable of growth.\nThe strong and great exhaust their **life qi**,\nAnd invite the **qi of death**—\nTruly the lowest of all things.\nThe soft and weak, however, see **Yin qi** dissipate and **Yang qi** flourish—\nThe highest of all things.\n\nHow can man not embrace weakness and reject strength,\nNor submit to lowliness while aspiring to preeminence?\n\nThe **Dao of Cultivation** most reveres the **Mysterious Pass**—\nThe **original qi** of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nThis **qi** is both supremely soft and hard,\nSupremely weak and strong,\nYet neither soft nor hard, neither weak nor strong can be seen.\nIn the dim and hazy void,\nSuddenly, **Yin** contains **Yang**, and **killing** gives birth to **life**—\nSeemingly present, yet absent;\nSeemingly real, yet empty.\nThis is the **silent, odorless**,\nThe **Heavenly mechanism** of **original beginning**.\nIf man can **steal this primordial void-qi**,\nThen the **original life-giving source** is obtained,\nAnd **ascension to Heavenly Immortality** is no longer difficult.\n\nEven if one steals the **original qi of the Mysterious Pass**\nAs the **precious elixir**,\nYet when gathering herbs in the **two critical seasons**,\nOne must still focus the **qi** to achieve softness—\nLike an infant, whose bones are soft, body weak, yet grip is firm—\nOnly then can the **original qi** be secured as the **elixir’s foundation**.\n\nIn the **four seasons of alchemical fire-refining**,\nOne must know the body’s softness, like silk, most exquisite—\nThis is the **original prenatal vitality**, bursting with life,\nThe **harmonious and lively** symbol.\nWith this **Yang qi**, one can forge the **Immortal Elixir**.\n\nThen, at the **retreat-and-seal stage**,\nWhen returning to the **furnace** for final refinement,\nOne must still be **soft and dense**,\n**Clear and lucid**, without slackness or neglect—\nLike one drunk or mad, the **spirit** lazy in thought,\nThe tongue lazy in speech—\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"Under Heaven, spring clouds are as lazy as I,\nWho knows I am even lazier than spring?\"*\n\nOnly such **softness and weakness** preserve the **original Yang qi**,\nEnduring without decay.\nIn summary, ten months in the womb,\nThree years at the breast,\nNine years in seclusion—\nAll are the **original soft and weak qi**,\nWhich, when perfected, yields the **elixir** and **Immortal attainment**.\n\nThe **Cultivator** must seek this **soft and tender qi**,\nLest he burn and refine in vain,\nWasting **spirit and vital essence**.\n\n**Chapter LXXVII: Act Without Relying**\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven—is it not like drawing a bow?\nThe high, it presses down; the low, it lifts up.\nThe excessive, it diminishes; the insufficient, it supplements.\nThe **Dao** of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the insufficient,\nBut the **Dao** of humankind does otherwise—it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can serve the excessive to benefit the world?\nOnly the one who holds the **Dao**.\n\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely,\nAccomplishes but does not dwell—\nDoes this not mean he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?\nThe **Dao** of Heaven flows and unfolds,\nNurturing all things,\nWith naught but **yin** and **yang**,\nComing and going, alternating in motion,\nGreat, central, and most upright,\nWithout favor or bias.\n\nHence, **yin** at its peak gives rise to **yang**,\nAnd **yang** at its peak gives rise to **yin**.\nWhen **yin** is excessive and **yang** declines,\nIt suppresses **yin** and aids **yang**;\nWhen **yang** is excessive and **yin** declines,\nIt suppresses **yang** and aids **yin**.\nEbb and flow, full and empty,\nMove in harmony with time,\nThus all things are born and transformed,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity,\nA Heaven enduring ten thousand years without decay.\nHow different is this from the archer’s art?\nGrasp the bow with steady resolve,\nThe inner will upright, the outer form aligned,\nEnsure the front and back arms,\nBalanced and smooth—\nThe high, it presses down; the low, it lifts up.\nThe excessive, it diminishes; the insufficient, it supplements.\nThen, in accord with the hand, it releases,\nFollowing the mark and striking true,\nWithout fear of missing.\n\nYet it does not compare to the **Dao** of Heaven—\nTaking the people’s **fat and marrow**,\nFilling its own **sacks of greed**,\nOften diminishing the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take the **excess of the sovereign**,\nAnd serve the **insufficient of the world**?\nOnly the **Dao**-holding Sage,\nWho follows the **Dao** of Heaven and aligns with human nature,\nDiminishes what is excessive, supplements what is insufficient,\nSo that the common people do not sigh in resentment.\nThough acting for oneself,\nIt is still in accordance with the **Dao** of Heaven—\nNever boasting of what is done;\nThough achievements come from sincerity,\nIt is but the utmost sincerity fulfilling one’s nature—\nNever claiming credit for them.\n\nSuch a Sage,\nNearly in harmony with Heaven’s effortless transformation,\nNot bound by natural course,\nNot desiring to show traces of action.\nThe **power** of nurturing things,\nBrilliant and evident to all,\nIs it not because the virtuous do not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThis is why Heaven has no limits,\nAnd only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt the beginning of life,\nOne is purely **yin** or purely **yang**,\nMost balanced and upright,\nWithout victory or defeat, without disparity.\nThus, the sun advances by day, the moon by night,\nWith tender bones and weak body yet flourishing.\nBut once life emerges,\nFire dwells above, water below,\nWater and fire not mingling—\nHence, **yin** is always excessive,\nAnd **yang** always insufficient.\nAs **yang** water is scorched by **yin** fire,\nHuman desires grow ever more,\nVulgar **qi** ever more fervent,\nWhile Heaven’s **true heart** is daily obscured,\nAnd **true qi** gradually fades,\nThe **mechanism of life** left without trace.\n\nIf the excessive **yin** fire were to descend,\nSupplementing the insufficient **yang** water;\nAnd once the **yang** water’s insufficiency is mended,\nStill restraining the excessive **yin** fire—\nLike the archer’s art,\nDiminishing the excessive, supplementing the insufficient,\nThen **yin** and **yang** are balanced.\nThis is all through water’s and fire’s own movement,\n**Yin** and **yang**’s own interplay,\nAnd Heaven itself does not know who does this.\n\nThe **Dao** of humankind is burdened by action,\nThe **Dao** of Heaven is honored by non-action.\nWhat else is cultivation but this?\nTo restore the **post-heaven yin and yang** to the **pre-heaven yin and yang**,\nFlowing without ceasing,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity.\n\n**Chapter LXXVIII: Receive the Filth of the Realm**\nUnder Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,\nYet none can overcome the firm and strong as water does.\nThere is nothing to replace it.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the strong,\nThe weak overcomes the rigid—\nAll know this, yet few can practice it.\nHence, the Sage says:\n*\"To receive the filth of the realm,\nIs to be its lord of soil and grain.\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes,\nIs to be its king under Heaven.\"*\n\nWords that seem reversed.\nIn the **Supreme Chapter**, it was said that the soft and weak are the followers of life,\nThe firm and strong are the followers of death—\nThus, the soft and weak occupy the high,\nThe firm and strong occupy the low,\nAnd it can be known that the utmost softness is the utmost rigidity,\nThe utmost weakness is the utmost strength.\n\nDaily, nightly, in all things,\nThe soft and weak are beneficial to all yet do not contend,\nEver in the humble low yet do not weary.\nThough but a drop’s worth,\nPeople may scorn it.\nThough but a ladle’s measure,\nPeople may slight it.\nYet when it accumulates into the deep,\nGathers into the sea,\nThen vast and boundless,\nIt can bear boats yet also overturn them;\nIt can nurture things yet also destroy them.\nNot only does it overcome all under Heaven,\nEven those skilled at attacking the firm and strong—\nNo firmness remains unbroken,\nNo strength remains unconquered—\nYet none can stand against it.\n\nThus, it is known:\nThe utmost softness under Heaven,\nCan govern the utmost rigidity under Heaven;\nThe utmost weakness under Heaven,\nCan repel the utmost strength under Heaven.\nWater, water!\nHow soft and weak it is,\nYet how strong and firm it becomes!\n\nMoreover, under Heaven, there is no task easier than attacking water,\nYet the firm and strong are ultimately unable to prevail.\nWhy do people not embrace softness while also embracing rigidity,\nNot adopt weakness while also adopting strength—\nEverywhere it is seen?\nDo they not know that softness overcomes rigidity,\nThat weakness overcomes strength?\n\nIt is because Heaven’s **true heart** moves,\nYet none know it,\nAnd once moved,\nIt is instantly stained by desires,\nDeflected by customs—\nThus, they bristle in arrogance,\nUnwilling to rest in softness and weakness.\nHence, as cleverness grows,\n**Virtue and principle** are lost;\nAs preferences become fixed,\n**True nature** is extinguished.\nSo that **Dao-heart** departs,\nHuman desires arise;\n**Guest-qi** flourishes,\n**True-qi** diminishes.\nLife’s **mechanism** gone,\nLife’s **mechanism** extinguished—\nTo make life flourish without end is difficult indeed.\n\nThe Sage says, *\"To receive the filth of the realm,\nIs to be its lord of soil and grain,\"*\nAs **Emperor Tang** of **Shang** spoke:\n*\"If my person has guilt,\nIt does not affect the myriad lands;\nIf the myriad lands have guilt,\nThe guilt lies upon my person.\"*\n\nStepping back is stepping forward—\nThus receiving the Mandate of Heaven from the boundless.\n\n*\"To bear the realm’s misfortunes,\nIs to become the sovereign of all under Heaven.\"*\nAs King Wu declared:\n*\"I received this victory—\nNot because my father, King Wen, had guilt,\nBut because I, his unworthy son, lacked virtue.\"*\n\nWhat follows is what precedes—\nThus bearing Heaven’s blessings without fail.\n\nHow could it compare to later ages’\nSleeping on wood, tasting gall,\nEnduring filth and accepting defilement?\nSuch efforts are mere speculation!\n\nThis is the eternal, unchanging principle,\nThe eternal, ungrounded scripture—\nThe true words for all under Heaven.\nYet the Sage seeks only within himself,\nNever demanding such of others.\n\nWater is the metaphor:\nWhen one *yang* first stirs, true essence begins to form.\nIts mechanism is most frail,\nIts force most yielding.\nYet gradually it gathers, condenses,\nDay by day, month by month,\nUntil it becomes the vast *qi*,\nMost great, most strong—\nFilling the two poles,\nEncompassing all things,\nAnd nothing is firm it cannot penetrate,\nNothing strong it cannot shatter.\n\n*The Awakening to Reality* says:\n*\"The White Tiger’s Head Scripture is supreme treasure,\nThe Hua Pool Divine Water Scripture is true scripture.\nThe highest goodness is like water—\nIts source profound, unlike common medicines.\"*\n\nThough *qi* is soft and weak,\nLike water:\nYet in its softness lies inherent strength,\nIn its weakness lies ultimate power—\nIt bears the weight of heaven and earth,\nHolds up the sun and moon,\nSummons wind and rain,\nDrives thunder and lightning.\nThis is the firmest strength under Heaven.\n\nThough called \"vast *qi*,\"\nIts essence is true essence.\nIt must be nourished with the utmost softness and weakness,\nAnd with *wuwei* as action,\nWith non-doing as doing—\nOnly then may one attain it.\n\nWhen it says,\n*\"To bear the realm’s filth,\nIs to become the lord of soil and grain;\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes,\nIs to become the sovereign of all under Heaven,\"*\nIt means:\nThe ancients turned inward to blame themselves,\nSaying, *\"Truly, I am without virtue—\nWhat guilt could the people have?\"*\n\nThe scholar who seeks virtue in others—\nWhy not first cultivate within oneself?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n*Constantly do good to others,*\n*And great grudges will have lingering grudges—*\nHow can this be called good?\n\nThus the Sage holds the left contract,\nYet does not blame others.\nTherefore, the virtuous govern contracts,\nThe unvirtuous govern disputes.\n\nHeaven’s Way has no favorites—\nIt always sides with the good.\nThe Way of cultivating oneself:\nOnly goodness is the treasure.\nThe Way of doing good:\nSelf-governance comes first.\n\nFor the Way lies within, not without;\nCultivation is in oneself, not in others.\nOnly by observing inwardly at all times,\nReflecting inwardly at all moments,\nCorrecting faults when they arise,\nAnd striving harder in goodness—\nMay one truly manifest goodness in body and mind,\nAnd forever be the perfect child of Heaven and Earth,\nThe complete Sage,\nWithout any deficiency.\n\nIt is clear that doing good\nOnly requires self-examination,\nNot others’ compliance.\nIf one blames others but not oneself,\nObserves outward but not inward,\nEven if one resolves a momentary anger,\nAnd though grudges may be dispersed,\nThey will not become enemies—\nYet without inward self-reproach,\nWithout restraining anger and desire,\nThough one may resolve it outwardly,\nOne cannot release it in the hidden depths.\nHow can one then be pure and unstained,\nFree and joyful,\nAnd return to the original, naturally good nature of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, reconciling great grudges will leave lingering grudges—\nHow can this be called good?\n\nOnly the Sage, in conduct and interaction,\nPrioritizes self-cultivation,\nAnd does not weigh others’ praise or blame, likes or dislikes.\nLike a contract split in two, each party holding one half,\nForever as evidence—\nClear that there is no deceit from me,\nNo deceit from you.\n\nThe Sage holds virtue as he holds the left contract—\nOnly cultivating within, never blaming others.\nThis is why he aligns with Heaven and Earth in greatness.\n\nThis is called *\"the virtuous govern contracts.\"*\nThe unvirtuous, however,\nValue the external over the internal,\nAnd take scrutiny as clarity,\nWhile weighing others’ grievances and grudges—\nThis is *\"the unvirtuous govern disputes.\"*\n\nThose who *\"govern disputes\"*:\nTake examining others as their task,\nNever reflecting on themselves,\nYet the people do not follow.\nHow can they compare to those who govern contracts,\nWho weigh their own faults heavily,\nAnd others’ lightly—\nYet all trust them in sincerity!\n\nIt is clear:\nThose who blame others lighten their own burden—\nTheir goodness cannot be complete.\nThose who blame themselves lighten others’ burden—\nTheir goodness is restored.\n\nWhen people turn to goodness,\nHeaven’s heart favors them—\nFor countless eons, without fail.\n\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Heaven has no favorites—\nIt aids only virtue.\"*\nIs this not the same as *\"The Supreme Way has no favorites—\nIt always sides with the good\"*?\n\nThe Sage’s learning:\nOnly lies in purifying the heart,\nRetreating and hiding in secrecy.\nFor outward goodness or evil,\nPraise or blame, compliance or defiance—\nAll are disregarded.\n\nThus, filtering thoughts, deepening reflection,\nConcentrating spirit, silent illumination—\nUntil the mind is clear, nature revealed,\nDesires purified, principles refined—\nAbove, aligning with Heaven in virtue,\nEnduring through all ages without erosion.\n\nIts practice begins with guarding the center,\nIts completion lies in fetal breathing.\nDo you understand this inwardly?\n\nThe ancients spoke of fetal breathing—\nNot to be taken as external breath or *qi*.\nWhen breath is suspended,\nThe true *yin* and true *yang* in the *dantian*,\nThe original spirit and original *qi*,\nMerge as one, blending into a single *qi*—\nMisty and vast, thriving and vigorous,\nOpening and closing, appearing and vanishing.\nVisible yet unseen, heard yet unheard—\nImagined yet leaving traces,\nFaint yet taking form—\nThis is perhaps the original breath of life.\n\nThe heart attains it and has substance,\nNature attains it and has use.\nWithout this *qi*, life cannot exist.\nTo become a high-grade immortal,\nOne cannot do without this *qi* as master.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The beginning of life—\nBecause of principle, there is *qi*;\nBecause of *qi*, there is form.\nThis is the natural order of Heaven and Earth in giving birth to man.\"*\n\nThe practitioner of reverse cultivation indeed slowly stirs the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming the form into a single *qi*. Further refining this *qi* allows it to condense into spirit.\n\nIf one steadfastly guards the void, nurturing the numinous *yang*, without returning to the origin of the *Wuji*, one may then manifest form when emerging and leave no trace when retreating. What difference is there between this and ordinary humanity?\n\nIn essence, this prenatal breath is the return to the moment when one’s parents’ mingled *qi* and blood first coalesced. If one cultivates this prenatal breath, day and night with the true intent of making the nonexistent into the existent, the formless into the formed, and the thoughtless into the thoughtful, preserving and gathering it, it will then form a spiritual embryo as the original spirit.\n\nWhen the ten months have passed and the form is complete, it sheds its shell and ascends through the crown, piercing the heavens, soaring among the *Luanhe* and *Xinghan*, riding the *luan* and *he* cranes, traversing the celestial realms, and ascending to the Jade Capital—all in the blink of an eye.\n\nYet this prenatal breath, though refined from the mortal’s colored form, is not the ordinary essence, *qi*, or spirit congealed. Though the alchemist cannot do without the postnatal, formed, and colored essence and *qi* as their foundation, they do not rely on them entirely. For postnatal essence and *qi* are all material and substantial, bound by fate—subject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth inevitable. Moreover, coarse essence and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish things—how could they be numinous?\n\nUltimately, one borrows the crude matter within the mortal’s colored form, refining it through countless forging and purifying processes, extracting that spotless, pure, and supremely numinous essence, *qi*, and spirit to become the true *Yi* breath, returning it to oneself to form the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir. The saying of \"extracting lead and adding mercury\" is but this.\n\nAll else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The embryo forms from the latent breath,\nThe breath rests within the embryo.\"*\n\nThus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body, one cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath. To gather the prenatal breath in the void within the *dantian*, one must first form the embryo—otherwise, it will not return.\n\nIf one remains purely still and active in harmony, with not a trace of mundane *qi* mingling or the mundane spirit straying outward, then the spirit will not scatter, and the *qi* will not dissipate—it will not disperse like a child from its mother or a husband from his wife. Do you understand?\n\n---\n**Chapter 80: The Small State with Few People**\n\nA small state with few people—\nLet there be ten or a hundred households’ worth of tools, yet unused.\nLet the people hold death in reverence and not wander far.\nThough they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them.\nThough they have armor and weapons, they do not display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyous.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of chickens and dogs heard—\nYet the people, from birth to death, do not visit one another.\n\nA small state with few people, remote and sparse—\nTo become a flourishing, grand realm,\nAnd cultivate the refined customs of antiquity,\nSeems indeed difficult.\n\nYet if one reduces wasteful expenditures,\nTrims superfluous formalities,\nAnd lets the tools of ten or a hundred households lie unused,\nThen waste diminishes while goods increase—\nThe wealth of the state can thus be achieved.\n\nMoreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly nor court death through private schemes,\nIf one does not flee to distant lands or dwell in foreign realms,\nBut clings only to parents and cherishes siblings,\nHolding death in reverence and not wandering far—\nThen an era of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.\n\nThus, *\"Charming is our sovereign, cherishing this land,\"*\nThough they have boats and carriages,\nThey do not venture far to strange lands,\nLeaving their ancestral homeland.\n\nWhen the court’s benevolence penetrates deeply,\nSoaking into the marrow and flesh,\nWith affection like that of parents and siblings,\nThen even rebellious and stubborn folk\nTransform into the virtuous.\nThough they have armor and weapons,\nThey have no need to display them.\n\nThus, with the ruler serene above and the people joyous below,\nThe people at ease and the state prosperous—\nIf one restores the governance of knotted cords,\nEnjoys the harmony of the *Taihe*,\nHonors kin and elders,\nDwells in proper abodes and tends proper fields,\nFinds delight in food and clothing,\nAnd takes joy in settled customs,\nWith sincerity fostering tradition—\nWhat fear is there that the state is small or the people few,\nThat it cannot achieve grandeur and abundance,\nOr that benevolence cannot prevail?\n\nWhen the people love their ruler as parents,\nAnd the ruler views them as children,\nWith loyal hearts and deep affection—\nEven a moment’s separation is unbearable.\n\nThough neighboring states are near,\nVisible at a glance and their chickens and dogs heard within earshot,\nThe people, from youth to old age, from birth to death,\nDo not once visit one another.\n\nThis is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,\nAre deeply bound to their ruler.\nThus, they rest in the governance of *Wuwei*,\nEnjoy the Dao’s celestial harmony,\nAnd do not dare to stray even a step.\n\nIn this way, how could the state fear being small,\nOr the people fear being few?\n\nNecessarily, their influence spreads to the four quarters,\nTheir reputation carried far—\nAnd the world submits to virtue,\nAll nations aligning in unity.\n\nThis is the method for those aged and weakened by declining essence.\n\nWhen a person grows old,\nTheir essence and *qi* scatter,\nLead and mercury diminish—\nTo cultivate the Great Elixir’s Dao seems indeed difficult.\n\nYet the matter of the Golden Elixir\nIs not of postnatal essence and *qi*,\nBut of the primordial lead and mercury.\nIf one attains the supreme unity’s method,\nExtracting and taking it,\nIngesting and consuming it—\nWhether old or young,\nOne may obtain the medicine in an instant,\nAchieving success in a thousand years or three months.\n\nThe only misfortune is failing to hear of the primordial *Yi* breath,\nAnd instead relying solely on the postnatal, formed essence—\nNot only will the aged achieve nothing,\nBut even the young and vigorous\nWill ultimately gain nothing.\n\nThe very first step must be endured with effort—\nkeeping the hands from straying,\nthe feet from moving lightly,\nthe eyes from gazing outward,\nthe ears from listening to extraneous sounds,\nthe mouth from speaking,\nthe mind from idle thoughts—\nfrom dawn till dusk,\ncleansing the mind of anxieties,\nnurturing the inner while restraining the outer,\nretiring into seclusion,\nso that not a single thread entangles,\nnor the slightest burden lingers.\nWith time, sincerity and clarity arise naturally—\nthe gaze turns inward, concentrated;\nthe tongue’s essence is held within;\nthe mind remains pure and preserved;\nthe limbs relax effortlessly,\nand every movement aligns with the Dao.\n\nThis is the meaning of *\"a hundred-bushel vessel unused\"*—\nthen, when used, it lacks nothing.\n*\"The people\"* are likened to the body.\n\nAs one grows old,\nwho does not fear death with utmost dread,\nor cherish life with profound longing?\nYet to fear death without seeking life\nis merely futile dread.\n\nOnly through careful solitude,\nconstant inward observation,\nand ceaseless self-reflection—\nnever straying from the mind’s core—\nwill one, over time, attain harmony within.\nThen even the heavens and earth may be ordered,\nand all things nurtured.\nHow much more so for what lies within oneself,\nyet remains unordered and uncultivated?\n\nThis is the way of establishing the Mysterious Transformation,\nnurturing the Spirit of the Valley:\nenduring like a thread unbroken,\nusing it without strain;\never-present like the waking mind,\nguarding it without failure;\nstill yet ever luminous,\nluminous yet ever still—\n*(that is, ever responsive yet ever tranquil,\nwithout force or artifice).*\n\nThis is what is meant by\n*\"moving yet unrestrained, still yet perfectly nourished.\"*\n\nIt does not involve the alchemical furnace’s revolutions,\nnor the celestial stem-and-branch’s shifts.\nNor does it require\nsuppressing chaos with martial might—\nthough warfare may befit the field,\ndefense suits the city,\nand ritual purity is paramount—\ntaking analogy from the alchemist’s fire,\nthe strategist’s victory over foes.\n\nThis is the method of pure cultivation,\nnot the craft of yin-yang supplementation.\nNot only can the aged, through practice,\nobtain the elixir and return to youth,\nbut even the young,\nif they adhere to this discipline,\nmay persist unceasingly, without division or pause,\nharmonizing with the serene and reverent Heaven.\n\nYet hasty progress yields no swift results,\nand impatience begets no great attainment.\nOnly through slow, leisurely cultivation—\nlike water’s gradual seepage,\nfire’s steady permeation—\nwill virtue mature and benevolence ripen,\nand the Dao be fulfilled.\n\nThus:\n*\"Though there be chariots and armor,\nthere is no use for them;\nThough there be arms and troops,\nthere is no place to deploy them.\"*\n\nThe movements of advance and retreat, ascent and descent—\nthe methods of morning *tūn* and evening *méng*—\nthe Supreme Sage has already spoken of them:\n*\"War is the last resort; it will surely bring years of calamity.\"*\n\nThis shows that the alchemical practice of refining at the furnace,\ngathering elixir through fire,\nis a method established for those whose post-natal *qi*\nis bound and obstructed by material entanglements—\nif one does not follow this path,\nthen common *qi* cannot transform,\nand true gold cannot be restored.\n\nIf one can make stillness and nourishment their practice,\nwithout resorting to the arts of boiling and frying,\nmerely abiding within the void and the tranquil,\nthen unknowingly and unawares,\nwithout action or thought,\none naturally becomes whole and undivided,\npure and upright,\nsilently harmonizing with Heaven,\nnot awaiting words or deliberation,\nyet flowing seamlessly with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis is the method of *\"making the people return to using knotted cords while governing them.\"*\nNo reliance on script or spoken exposition,\nyet *\"the Sage above does not need calculations or plans.\"*\n*\"Let them enjoy their food and adorn their clothing,\"*\nmeaning their essence permeates within,\ntheir *qi* circulates without.\nSweetness within and beauty without—\nthere is that which cannot be named or spoken of.\n\n*\"Let them dwell in peace, delight in their customs,\"*\nthen their hearts are settled in virtue and benevolence,\nand wherever they go,\nall is fitting.\n\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage,\nclarity is ever-present,\nsuchness is effortless,\none can meet all things with no mind—\nhow could they be stained by external objects?\nEven when there are sights and sounds,\nthey are as if unseen and unheard,\nnever stirred by color or sound.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Neighboring lands may gaze upon each other,\nyet they do not visit or communicate.\"*\n\nThis is the supreme and highest attainment,\nthe lowest and lowest is nonexistent—\nthe profoundest of profundities,\nthe most wondrous of wonders.\nAh!\n\nWhen cultivation reaches this stage, one finds great harmony with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of Daoist practice, there have been two ancient methods: those who cultivate through purity, and those who cultivate through yin-yang supplementation.\n\nCultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of the highest root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate nature is truly extraordinary, proceeding from this step onward follows the natural Way of Heaven and Earth, unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.\n\nWithin the human body, there exist the mechanisms of yin-yang (坎 *kǎn* and 离 *lí*), the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth (乾 *qián* and 坤 *kūn*), the movements of sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without thought or deliberation, without striving or planning. Then, the pure and empty *qi* flows boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth, the coming and going of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang—advancing and retreating thusly.\n\nThough there are stages of fire and heat, they amount to nothing more than calming the mind, reducing desires, and maintaining inner stillness, allowing true *qi* to circulate without ceasing. Though there are movements of ascent and descent, they are merely the constant rising of true water and the constant descending of true fire. Even in the practice of Daoist bathing, it is only a matter of restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and washing the heart, so that the Great Harmony may be embraced.\n\nThough there are elixirs and pills, they are but this: taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, the two entwined into one, merging without separation, giving birth to that primordial point of true soul—what is called the true essence of the Palace of Separation (離宮), or the true mercury of the human body. By refining one’s spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus is formed, and later, a sun-body emerges—organs, bones, blood vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair, flesh, and all awareness, none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*. All stems from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion producing this true mercury’s essence, which becomes the sun-body.\n\nYet this true mercury requires the condition of birth. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends with it. Its motion arises from the movement of true mercury; its stillness arises from its repose. In short, motion and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Way, and one must only follow its natural operation.\n\nYet few ancient immortals began their practice from this step. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation?\n\nFirst, one must recognize the foundation of the Supreme Ultimate (太極), the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang-*qi* into the dantian, just as parents unite—precision and blood merging into one within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the Palace of Mutual Sensation (交感宮), where lead and mercury are daily refined, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell, and the immortal of the naked embryo is born. Without this true seed, one’s practice is empty. Though there may be gains, they will only preserve the physical form and cannot produce the transcendent body.\n\nDo you understand? With this point of true yang-*qi* planted in the womb, one may then apply the illumination of spirit-light, and over time, the true yang will stir. It is permissible to draw the water of *kǎn* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin-dregs and corpse-*qi* of the physical body, extracting only the pure *qi*, blending it with the soul-yang, and forming it into an elixir to nourish the spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Way.\n\nOrdinary people, having fallen into the post-heavenly realm, have depleted their spirit and *qi*, and their years have aged them. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar, and thus must exert effort.\n\nSince spirit and *qi* are divided and not yet unified, during seated practice, one must use a portion of intention and *qi* to gather them both into the dantian, ensuring not a single thread escapes outward, not a breath leaves or enters. One need only follow the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation—from one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, to ten thousand—without constraint. Then, having tightly sealed the great gate, one stores the spirit at the dantian’s bolt, practicing thus for a while, before halting external breath and allowing true breath to move. One then nourishes it again, and soon the true yang-*qi* surges forth like a gale or billowing clouds. Quickly, one opens the pass and guides it upward.\n\nIn its ascent, one relies on spirit, not *qi*—only concentrating the spirit at the tailbone’s end is sufficient. When the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it for a moment before descending. In summary, when true yang first stirs, one must exert some effort before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the vulgar body’s turbid *qi* is too heavy, and it must be vigorously agitated to dispel its filth, revealing the pure and clear spirit-*qi* that will serve as the foundation for the elixir. Hence the ancients said: At first, one gathers the medicine, but without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore—this is why martial fire is called \"wild battle.\"\n\nOnce ascent and descent are complete, when the dantian is full and the heart and spirit are at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to complete the work.\n\n「This is indeed a strenuous effort, yet it is the natural way of things. One must follow this path in practice.\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One: Acting Without Striving**\n*\"True words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not true.\"*\n*\"The virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\"*\n*\"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.\"*\n*\"The sage does not hoard.*\n\nWhen one acts for others, the more one gives, the more one possesses.\nWhen one gives to others, the more one shares, the more one’s virtue grows.\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe Dao of the sage acts without striving.\n\nThis chapter concludes the entire text, showing that all sayings of the *Dàodé Jīng* are sincere and without deceit. One must not dismiss this scripture as unpolished in language and shelve it without discussion or reflection.\n\nKnow that the Dao has no name—it is only called *Dao* by force.\nThe Dao has no words—all words are obstructions.\nYet, to teach and transform beings, one must establish provisional names,\nas a bridge for later learners.\n\nOnce words are spoken, they must come from the heart,\nand their expression must be measured and true.\nThis is indeed a profound and genuine discourse,\nharmonizing with the ancient yet never erroneous,\nconforming to the present yet universally applicable.\nWithout embellishment or falsehood,\nit requires no ornate rhetoric—what need for excessive complexity?\nSimple transmission and direct pointing reveal the very nature of *xìngtiān* [性天, inherent nature of Heaven].\n\nTrue words need not be beautiful.\nIf one speaks of ornate literature and elegant prose,\nthat is the speech of scholars and literati,\nwho adorn themselves with superficial brilliance to please the world—\nsuch words are not to be trusted.\n\nIf their words are true yet virtuous, and they do not seek to deceive through contrivance,\nwhat need for argumentation?\nThose who argue are like the deaf and blind,\npretending to hear and see to fit in with others,\ncovering their ears while stealing the bell—\nsuch behavior is not virtuous.\n\nVirtue lies within oneself; wisdom lies within one’s heart—\nwhy must it be excessive?\nConfucius said, *\"My Way is one, and it runs through all things.\"*\nMencius said, *\"The Way is one and only one.\"*\nWhat need for vast learning?\n\nThose who seek vastness are like those who do not grasp the essence of the Dao,\nwhose words lack proper foundation.\nThey wander through the teachings of a hundred schools,\nmastering only the recitation of phrases and literary flourishes—\nthis is not the sage’s learning, which is profound and guided by the utmost harmony and rectitude.\n\nIn truth, the Dao is such that nothing exists outside of it.\nIt can be taken without restriction,\nused without exhaustion.\n\nThe sage is empty yet not empty,\nhas yet not has.\nLike a clear mirror suspended high,\nreflecting all without storing any—\nhow can there be accumulation?\n\nIf there were accumulation,\nthen the mirror would bear the stains of dust,\nthe water would be tainted by sand—\nthis is not the empty, luminous essence of the sage,\nwhich is vast and impartial.\n\nOnly when the sage’s nature is thus empty and luminous,\ndoes he respond to circumstances and follow the *yuan* [缘, conditions],\nthough the myriad people may be in chaos,\nvirtue cannot be universally applied—\nyet even one person wronged will be held as a burden of guilt,\nand his heart will always ache.\n\nIf the entire realm remains untouched by benevolence,\nhis heart will bear constant pain.\nIn giving to others, what need for excessive restraint?\nThus it is said:\nWhen one acts for others, his own merit increases;\nWhen one gives to others, his own virtue grows.\n\nIt is like the light of a mirror—\nwhen objects come, they are reflected;\nwhen objects depart, the reflection ceases—\nthere is no premeditation in between.\n\nThe sage’s heart is thus:\nThe sage’s heart is Heaven’s heart;\nThe sage’s Dao is Heaven’s Dao.\n\nHeaven acts through silent transformation,\nthough there may be waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness—\nall belong to the mechanism of nurturing life,\nbenefiting without harming.\n\nThe sage creates through effortless spontaneity,\nthough there may be loss and gain, granting and taking—\nall belong to the response of benevolence,\nalso acting without striving.\n\nIf Heaven and Earth were to benefit or harm,\nthen Heaven and Earth would also be partial and not impartial—\nhow could they endure for ten thousand years unchanged?\n\nIf the sage were to act with striving or contention,\nthen the sage would also hoard without dispersing—\nhow could his utmost sincerity persist without end?\n\nAlas!\nHeaven and Earth are vast;\nThe sage is vast.\nThough there are true words,\nthey arise from the heart’s intent—\nno borrowing, no pretense.\n\nBased on self and verified by the common people,\nit is the innate virtue of Heaven,\nthe shared essence of human hearts.\n\nTo act for others is to act for oneself;\nTo give to others is to give to oneself.\nThis is the unity of self and other,\nthe oneness of Heaven and humanity—\nhere lies the sage’s harmony with Heaven, revealed in his breadth.\n\nThis commentary concludes.\nThe teacher then calls his disciples and tells them:\n*\"The Great Dao today is as precarious as a pile of eggs.\nIt depends on you, those who study the Dao,\nto uphold Heaven and Earth,\nand rectify the balance of *qiánkūn* [乾坤, the cosmos].\n\nEven if you speak of wicked and rebellious men,\nthere may be conflict with arms—\nyet Heaven has its arrangements,\nand it will never leave you with unforeseen calamity.\n\nOnly fear that you may hold virtue too narrowly,\ntrust the Dao too lightly,\nwaver in resolve—\nsometimes acting, sometimes abandoning it—\nthus severing your connection with Heaven.\n\nUnable to align above with Heaven,\neven if Heaven has tenfold benevolence,\ndesiring to nurture you in a realm of rest and tranquility,\nhow can you receive Heaven’s grace if you cannot embrace it?\n\nYou have now seen the Dao clearly,\ngrasped its essence with strength—\nyour own foundation is firm.\nOnly in each word and action,\nbreath by breath, must you remain in harmony with Heaven—\nthen Heaven will cherish you,\nprotect you, and never forsake you.\n\nFor the Dao is Heaven, and to honor the Dao is to honor Heaven;\nTo love the Dao is to love Heaven.\n\nSuch silent accord and profound trust\nwill naturally lead to auspicious blessings.\nHeaven’s Dao is originally one with humanity’s Dao—\nexamine the ancients and the moderns:\nThere have been none who defied the Dao and escaped Heaven’s disdain,\nnor any who followed the Dao and failed to receive Heaven’s favor.\nYou may now awaken to this truth.\n\nIn summary, each must follow what is right,\nexhaust what is sincere—\nas for external judgments of right and wrong, misfortune and blessing,\nall are governed by Heaven’s will.\nYou must not fret over taking another’s place—\nleave such concerns to Heaven.\"*\n\nThe essence of the Great Dao lies solely in the two aspects of **shen** (神) and **qi** (氣)—\nyet there is a distinction between **pre-Heaven** (先天) and **post-Heaven** (後天).\nCultivators must never fail to grasp this.\n\nThe ancient scriptures state:\nPre-Heaven **yuan shen** (元神), the body;\nPost-Heaven **shi shen** (識神), the function.\nWithout pre-Heaven **yuan shen**, the Great Dao has no master;\nWithout post-Heaven **shi shen**, the Great Dao has no use.\n\nYou must diligently refine your practice—\nwhen in the **hunhun dun dun** (混混沌沌, profound chaos),\nthe state of **wuzhi wujue** (無知無覺, no awareness),\nnurture the pre-Heaven **yuan shen** to rule as sovereign.\nThen, with a sudden start and awakening,\nthe post-Heaven **shi shen** emerges.\n\nThis **shi shen** is not the fleeting, wandering thoughts of your ordinary mind,\nbut the **zhengdeng zhengjue** (正等正覺, true and pure awakened spirit),\nwhich, when activated, brings forth knowledge—\nthus it is called **shi shen**.\n\nYet once this **shi shen** arises,\nit may swirl with chaotic, deluded thoughts,\nendless distractions and desires—\nand you shall fall into private streams and sensual cravings,\nunable to forge the Elixir.\n\nOnly when the mind is **yīxīn liǎozhào** (一心了照, singularly illuminated)\nand steadfastly resolves to nothing else—\nwhen the will is unscattered,\nand the spirit is condensed—\nthen breath may be regulated,\nand the Elixir will form.\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"The mind fixed solely on the silken thread,\nno sight of white reeds or red banks beyond.*\nEven though called **shi shen**,\nits essence is the pre-Heaven **yuan shen**.\"\n\nThus the ancients proclaimed:\n*\"Heaven’s heart is the master, the **yuan shen** the function.\nSkillfully employ the thief’s trick,\nand return to the workings of Creation.\"*\nWhat need then to fear failing to ascend to the sacred?\n\nYou must also understand this, surely.\nWhen Heaven’s heart stirs,\nconstantly stabilize and contain it—\nno wandering thought,\nno breath of impurity—\nso that Heaven’s heart remains,\nand the Dao-heart is ever condensed.\nEven with **shi shen**, it is as though without.\n\nFor those who seek **true cultivation** (修真),\nat the very outset,\nthe precious task is to subdue the **mang zhì** (妄識, deluded perceptions)\nof the two eyes, ears, mouth, body, and mind.\nThen gather the spirit at the **Dan xióng** (丹扃, Elixir Gate),\nregulate the breath at the **Dan tián** (丹田, Elixir Field),\nand ensure that all ordinary breaths are extinguished—\nonly then does the **yuan qì** (元氣, Original Qi) begin to return in submission.\n\nOnce the **yuan qì** has gathered,\n**yīnyīn huópó** (氤氳活泼, vibrant and lively),\n**wǎnzhuǎn yōuyáng** (宛转悠扬, gently undulating),\nlike a living dragon in motion,\nfully invigorated—\nthis **yuan qì**’s vigor\ncan drive the **Hé chē** (河车, River Vehicle).\n\nYet if the **qi jī** (氣機, Qi mechanism) is too violently stirred,\nand the **Hé chē**’s work of **huà jīng wéi qì** (化精為氣, transforming essence into Qi)\nand **huà qì wéi shén** (化氣為神, transforming Qi into spirit)\nis not properly condensed at the **Dan dǐng** (丹鼎, Elixir Cauldron),\nthen the unrefined **yīn jīng** (陰精, yin essence) cannot be fixed,\nand will not long remain in the post-Heaven **Dan dǐng**.\nAt the slightest provocation of ordinary fire,\nit will stir the **yín gēn** (淫根, lustful roots),\nand spawn **yín shì** (淫事, lustful deeds)—\nand all will be lost.\n\nEven if you forcefully suppress it,\nnot letting it move—\nyet the post-Heaven **qì jīng** (精氣, essence and Qi)\nare all of pure **yīn** (陰),\nunrefined, and without constraint,\nthey must leak—\neven if constrained, they must leak.\n\nWith this method alone,\nyou can **duó tiān dì guǐ shén zhī quán** (奪天地鬼神之權, seize the authority of Heaven, Earth, and spirits),\nand participate in the **zào huà yīn yáng zhī fǎ** (造化陰陽之法, principles of Creation’s yin and yang),\nto **zì zhǔ zì duó** (自主自奪, command and restrain yourself):\n*\"My life is mine alone—\nnot Heaven’s to control.\"*\nTruly, you become an **immortal of eternal youth** (長生不老之仙),\nthe very **Yánluó lǎozi** (閻羅老子, Lord Yama) himself\nhas no power over you.\n\nThus the method must not be revealed to the unworthy,\nlest Heaven’s spirits lose their authority over **shàn è bào yìng** (善惡報應, reward and retribution).\n\nYou, who know the Dao,\nmust surely grasp its meaning.\nTightly seal your lips and tongue,\ndo not recklessly spill Heaven’s secrets,\nits hidden keys.\n\nOnce the **yuan qì** has gathered in the **Dan tián**,\nand you practice the **Hé chē** method,\nyou must further rely on post-Heaven ordinary **qì** (氣) as **yáng huǒ yīn fú** (陽火陰符, yang fire and yin talisman),\nurging and prompting it—\nmaking it rise and fall, come and go without end,\nstirring and refining it,\nso that it transforms the ordinary into the true,\nits changes unfathomable.\n\nThough the **yuan qì** of the Elixir is rooted in pre-Heaven **yuan qì**,\npost-Heaven ordinary **qì** is still indispensable for its function.\n\nAs for the Elixir itself,\nits success depends entirely on the **huǒ hòu** (火候, fire timing).\nThe ancients, standing before the furnace,\nwere supremely cautious—\nlest even a slight deviation in breath\ndisturb the **zào huà yīn yáng** (造化陰陽, workings of Creation’s yin and yang).\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Advancing fire and employing talismans\nis like cooking rice—\ntoo gentle, and it remains raw;\ntoo hasty, and it burns.\nHence the value of **chāngchāng** (惺惺, alertness) ever present,\nand **miánmián** (綿綿, gradual continuity) without cease.\"*\n\nFrom these two phrases,\nyou may discern the subtleties of fire use.\n\nWhen the **ground thunder rumbles** (地下雷鳴),\nand the fire presses the **jin** (金, metal),\nat that moment, if not for **wǔ huǒ** (武火, martial fire),\nhow could the **jin qì** (金氣, metal Qi) ascend?\n\nYet martial fire must be wielded skillfully—\nlet its flames surge ten thousand feet,\nits radiance shoot in all directions,\nbut I shall douse it with a single drop of cool water,\nspread across the ten directions—\nthis is the **qi zhàng ér xīn xiǎng** (氣壯而心享之道, power of Qi and the joy of the heart),\nthe **qīngjìng tiándàn** (清净恬淡為本之妙術, wondrous art of purity and tranquility).\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Dragon and tiger meet on the battlefield—\nin a flash, their fate is sealed.\nI urge you: when evil arises, act with virtue,\nFor strength gained through contention brings only harm.\"*\n\nIndeed, the power is to be feared,\nthe moment is perilous—\nyet the heart must never falter in its vigilance before the furnace.\n\nOnce you grasp this meaning,\nyou will never again face the threat of collapse.\n\nStill, the **Hé chē** method must be practiced as such.\nIf applied indiscriminately to **shǒu zhōng** (守中, Central Retention),\nbefore the **qi jī** is fully open,\nand the heart-spirit is at peace—\nif you simply follow the **zìrán** (自然, natural) method—\nhow can the spirit and Qi merge into one,\nor any **yào wù** (藥物, medicinal substance) be gathered?\n\nThis must be done\nwhen the **Xuān guān** (玄關, Mysterious Gate) first appears—\n**shèn qì** (腎氣, kidney Qi) ascending,\n**xīn yè** (心液, heart fluid) descending—\nusing the **shù qì** (數息, breath-counting) martial fire,\nno thought allowed to stray,\nno breath to rush.\n\nThus, with slow and steady urging,\nstimulating the **tǔolì jīguān** (橐龠機關, bellows mechanism),\nonly then do ordinary breaths cease,\nand **true breaths** (真息) emerge,\nthe human heart die,\nand the Dao-heart live.\n\nElse, let alone speak of *zìrán* (naturalness),\nthere will be no *zìrán* at all.\n\nHence it is said:\nEven the *shēng zhī* (生知, innate-knowing sage)\nmust still descend to *xià kùn zhī* (下困知, acquired knowledge through hardship),\nand only through diligent practice can mastery be attained.\n\nThe ancients spoke:\n*\"The Western Mountain’s White Tiger rages unchecked,\nThe Eastern Sea’s Green Dragon cannot be withstood.\nWith both hands seized, they battle to the death—\nForged into a single mass of purple gold frost.\"*\n\nAgain it is said:\n*\"To subdue the Dragon, one’s will must be as vast as heaven,\nTo tame the Tiger, one’s spirit must be fierce as smoke.\nEven the dullest fool who grasps this truth—\nShall surely become a transcendent sage upon the earth.\"*\n\nThis *wǔhuǒ* (武火, martial fire) method\nmay be applied when the Dragon and Tiger do not yet meet,\nwhen Water and Fire have not yet harmonized—\nbut if practicing the *hé chē* (河车, River Vehicle),\nwhen already the Dragon roars and the Tiger howls,\nwhen yin and yang respond in perfect accord,\nto still employ this method here\nwould only risk driving the true *qi* into chaos and dispersion.\nMencius warned:\n*\"Like chasing a released pig—*\n*once it has entered the thicket,*\n*to then call it back is a grave mistake.\"*\n\nI shall now reveal the complete technique—\nyou must strive with all your might to cultivate it,\nto fulfill the hopes of your teacher.\n\n**Do not recklessly disclose this—**\nlest you invite calamity upon yourself.",

Though the Dao is inherently plain and ordinary, many regard it as deceptive, strange, and bizarre. Thus, Confucianism becomes ever less Confucian, Buddhism ever less Buddhist, and Daoism ever less Daoist.\n\nIf we do not expose the root causes or pierce through the subtle mysteries, the Dao will grow ever more obscured and unmanifest, while human hearts will decay and become ever harder to govern—until, inevitably, we descend to the level of birds and beasts, and sages are no better than the ignorant masses. The Dao will then hang in peril like a fragile egg suspended between heaven and earth, with none to bear the responsibility of preserving civilization.\n\nFortune favors this age of peace, and the land enjoys tranquility. At this opportune moment, I encountered a Daoist friend among the sacred mountains, discussing profound truths and subtle mysteries. I listened in secret, and their words were no mere empty talk for idle ears—I gained true insight from their teachings.\n\nThe assembled revered me as a master, so day and night I lectured on the *Dao De Jing*, using it as proof for cultivating virtue and establishing moral power.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter One: The Gateway to All Mysteries**\n\nThe Dao/Way that can be spoken is not the constant Dao/Way;\nThe Name that can be named is not the constant Name.\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\nThus, without desire, one observes its subtlety,\nWith desire, one perceives its openings.\nThese two, though born from the same source and bearing different names,\nAre both rooted in the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious again and again—\nThis is the gateway to all mysteries.\n\nMaster Zhu [Zi] said: *\"The Dao/Way is like a path, which all people share.\"*\nIn truth, it is the principle that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things,\nHence it is called the Dao/Way.\nBefore Heaven and Earth were divided,\nThis Dao/Way hung suspended in the boundless void;\nAfter Heaven and Earth were opened,\nThis Dao/Way was entrusted to the heavens and the earth.\nWhat Dao/Way is this?\nBefore Heaven and Earth, it endured eternally;\nAfter Heaven and Earth, it does not decay.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nMingled within the formless,\nNeither visible nor audible.\nThus, the Sage of Highest Virtue said:\n*\"To speak of the Dao/Way is to exhaust and obscure it—\nIn truth, there is nothing to speak of;\nWhat can be spoken of are but the Dao/Way’s manifestations,\nNot the constant Dao/Way itself.*\n*To name the Name is to empty and void it—\nIn truth, there is nothing to name;\nWhat can be named are but the Dao/Way’s dross,\nNot the constant Name itself.*\n\nIf people do not know the Dao/Way,\nHow can they read the *Book of Poetry* and say:\n*\"The Heavenly carriage moves without sound or scent\"*—\nThe Dao/Way cannot be confined by words!\nAnd again:\n*\"The mandate of Heaven, serene and unceasing\"*—\nThe Dao/Way cannot be without designation.\n\nOne must know that within the utmost void,\nThe utmost reality resides;\nWithin the utmost emptiness,\nThe utmost substance dwells.\nThe Dao/Way’s truth cannot be measured by what is spoken of.\n\nThe Sage of Highest Virtue, in compassion and mercy,\nBroadly expounded the teachings for the world:\n*\"Before the primordial chaos had yet taken form,\nIt was but a boundless, undifferentiated unity—\nThough called Nameless, all things under Heaven and Earth, humans and nature,\nAre nurtured within it.\nThis is why it is called the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\nWhen stillness endured long,\nThe movement of *qi* arose,\nThen came the Named,\nA vast and harmonious *qi* of the Great Unity,\nFlowing through the cosmos,\nNourishing all life.\nThis is why it is called the mother of all things.\n\nThe beginning is the undivided *qi* before Heaven and Earth opened;\nThe mother is the transformation giving birth to all things after their division.\nFor the student at the outset,\nThere is no other method—\nOnly to sit upright with a single mind,\nDiscard all thoughts,\nAnd observe with a veiled gaze.\n\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nThere seems a void, a hollow space.\nSpirit meets spirit, breath returns to its source,\nFollowing its ebb and flow,\nBut the focus must be on the convergence of spirit and *qi* in the central palace.\nIn no time, spirit and *qi* merge into one.\n\nThen, one listens to its boundless chaos,\nWithout stirring a single conscious thought.\nAfter long stillness, a faint, indistinct awareness arises,\nEntering the realm of the Unknowable.\nAt this moment,\nOne does not know whether spirit enters *qi* or *qi* returns to spirit—\nAll is indistinct, neither self nor other, neither here nor there,\nYet not dull or lifeless—\nIf it were dull and lifeless, it would be but a withered tree, dead ashes.\nThe cultivator, reaching this stage,\nShould extinguish the stirring mind,\nYet preserve the observing mind.\nOnly then does one attain wisdom as if foolish,\nAnd insight without application.\n\nIn the midst of ignorance and unconsciousness,\nA sudden awakening stirs—\nThis is the foundation of the *Tai Ji*.\nOne must know that this awakening,\nArising naturally and not through external influence,\nIs the true awareness of my original nature.\n\nThe Daoists call this the Mysterious Gateway,\nFound within the space of a single breath.\nWhen inhaling, it is yin, stillness, void;\nWhen exhaling, it is yang, movement, presence.\nEven this fleeting breath contains mystery.\n\nIf one seeks to cultivate true awakening,\nAt the moment of this awakening—\nA genuine, unshakable, thoughtless, and pure original person emerges.\nThus it is said:\nHeaven and Earth awaken, giving birth to myriad things;\nHumans awaken, refining the Golden Elixir.\n\nBut this awakening is like a flash of lightning or a spark of stone fire—\nBefore one’s eyes, it is present;\nIn an instant, it vanishes—\nThe difference is but a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe scholar must discern it clearly in ordinary times,\nOnly then can they grasp it when the moment arrives.\nEven the ancient Great Awakened Ones,\nDid not attain otherwise than through this awakening’s accumulation.\n\nIf the cultivator begins their work\nWithout first mastering the stages of no-desire and desire,\nOf observing subtlety and perceiving openings,\nFrom where can they establish their foundation?\n\nThough no-desire and desire,\nSubtlety and openings,\nAre but yin-stillness and yang-movement—\nOne *qi* divided into two,\nTwo *qi*s still returning to one.\n\nWhen stillness endures and movement arises,\nThe void generates presence—\nThis is called *One Yang Emerges, the Child is Born*.\nWhen movement reaches its peak and stillness returns,\nPresence returns to void—\nThis is called *Restoring the Command, Returning to the Root*.\nBoth are but the yin and yang of the *Tai Ji*.\n\nThough they bear different names,\nThey spring from the same source—\nThe Sage of Highest Virtue calls this *One Mysterious*.\nThe Mysterious means profound and distant.\n\nThe scholar who seeks the Mysterious Dao/Way,\nMust still the mind again and again,\nAchieve steadiness once more—\nWithin, all is boundless and free,\nThis is observing subtlety without desire.\n\nThis is the first Mysterious.\nWhen the *qi* stirs,\nThough one knows,\nThey do not produce the perception of knowing;\nThough one moves,\nThey do not cling to the thought of movement.\nWith one mind,\nWithout dual thoughts—\nThis is perceiving openings with desire.\nThis is the second Mysterious.\n\nAs for the Mysterious again and again,\nIt is truly the realm of returning to the root—\nWhat else could it be but the gateway to all mysteries?\n\nWhat is regrettable is that ordinary people,\nThough possessing this mystery,\nDo not nurture it directly—\nThus it opens and closes in cycles,\nUntil it is exhausted without end.",

      "translated_text": "The True Person, when the Mysterious Gateway opens,\nFixes it with a single glance,\nSeizes it with a single hand,\nCultivates and nurtures it—\nNever allowing it to stray for an instant,\nThus directly attaining the supreme primordial source,\nAnd achieving the Great Awakening as a Golden Immortal.\n\nThe initial practice lies within the single Mysterious Gateway.\nThe Supreme Chapter first distinguishes the Nameless as Named,\nAnd perceiving subtlety without desire, with desire.\nThis clearly shows the essence of cultivation—\nBeyond this single Mysterious Gateway,\nThere is nothing else to progress toward.\n\nThus the opening four lines speak of the Great Dao’s root,\nWhich is truly formless and boundless,\nUnthinkable and inexhaustible.\nOnly at the dawn of Heaven and Earth,\nWhen all was indistinct and chaotic,\nWithout any trace or clue,\nIs it akin to when a person steadies themselves in stillness.\n\nAt the moment of Heaven and Earth’s sudden manifestation,\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and motion begins,\nAwareness dawns and clarity awakens—\nThis is when a person detects *qi* in movement,\nThe very foundation for refining the elixir.\n\nWithin this mere blink of an eye,\nWithout the wisdom-pearl or insight-sword,\nOne cannot grasp it.\nEssentially, the moment thoughts arise,\nThe Mysterious *yin* (womb) emerges—\nThe very beginning of Heaven’s opening and Earth’s splitting.\n\nSince ancient times, all divine immortals\nHave been born from this moment of awakening motion.\nIt is also said:\nPerceiving subtlety without desire,\nPerceiving openings with desire—\nThese two, one still and one moving,\nMutually forming their roots,\nThus differing in name though arising from the same source.\n\nAll things with form and appearance\nCan be pondered, measured, and divined.\nBut this subtle opening—\nIt is without yet present,\nPresent yet without—\nCannot be named or described by any fixed standard.\n\nEven if the tongue flows like a suspended river,\nIt cannot utter a single word of it—\nThus it is called the *Dao/Way* of *Dao/Way*.\n\nLearners also do not regard it as distant and obscure,\nNor do they exhaustively seek its concrete reality.\nIf one truly finds this definite place,\nWhere others see it as vague and elusive,\nIn me, it is solidly grasped.\nWith prolonged practice, vitality springs forth—\nEvery moment is the Dao itself.\n\n**Chapter Two: Achieving Merit Yet Not Claiming It**\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen wickedness already arises.\n\nThus the presence and absence of forms generate,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLength and shortness define one another,\nHeight and low incline toward one another,\nSounds harmonize with one another,\nFront and back follow one another.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts in affairs of non-doing,\nPractices teachings of no-speech,\nAll things arise yet they do not take credit,\nGive birth yet do not possess,\nAct yet do not rely—\nAchieving merit yet not claiming it;\nOnly by not claiming it,\nDoes it not depart.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"I urge you to exhaustively seek the origin of your vital body,\nReturning to the root and returning to the source is the Elixir King.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Exhaustively seek where your vital body receives its mandate,\nDo not blame Heaven’s *qi* for being fully revealed.\"*\n\nFrom this perspective, it is clear that at the very beginning of receiving one’s mandate,\nThe natural principles of Heaven are complete,\nWithout any flaw.\nThose who speak of beauty and ugliness,\nGoodness and deformity,\nAre all harming the Dao.\n\nWhat is the Great Dao’s nature?\nIn Confucianism, it is called *\"hidden and subtle\"*,\nWithin which lies the essence of unseen and unheard.\nIn Buddhism, it is called *\"that\"* (which is),\nWithin which lies the truth of neither good nor evil.\nIn Daoism, it is called *\"Mysterious Gateway\"*,\nWithin which lies the profound mystery of no-thought and no-contemplation.\n\nThe Great Dao’s root originates from here.\nOnce imagined or theorized,\nIt falls into the trap of duality;\nOnce discussed or deliberated,\nIt stumbles into the snare of words.\nThough immortals of old praised the Dao’s marvels,\nSaying it is beautiful and good,\nThey were all but dimly grasping its form—\nNot truly seeing its essence.\n\nFor when they say it is good,\nEvil already opposes it;\nWhen they say it is beautiful,\nDeformity already opposes it.\nMoreover, beauty exists here,\nYet ugliness also exists here;\nGoodness exists here,\nYet deformity also exists here.\nThis is doubtless the post-Heaven duality of *yin* and *yang*,\nWith their interplay of victory and defeat—\nNot the pre-Heaven unity of *qi*.\n\nThus the Supreme Chapter says:\n*\"All under Heaven know beauty as beauty—\nThen ugliness already exists;\nAll know goodness as goodness—\nThen wickedness already arises.\"*\n\nIt is known that if one does not seek the emptiness of *qi* beyond extremes,\nBut merely speaks of beauty as beauty and goodness as goodness,\nThis is abandoning the root for the branches.\n\nThe Supreme Chapter specifically instructs beginners:\nAt the start of seated practice,\nOne must cast aside all entanglements,\nHold nothing in mind—\nOnly then, lowering the curtain and sealing the *fu* (mouth),\nObserving the elixir field in emptiness,\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,\nRegulating the breath and concentrating the spirit—\nThus, with prolonged effort,\nSpirit and *qi* merge into one cluster,\nInstantly entering the distant and obscure realm—\nThis is non-doing.\n\nWhen emptiness reaches its utmost,\nSuddenly, a single awareness stirs—\nThis is doing.\nFrom this single thought arising within the rule,\nContinuous yet indistinct,\nUnceasing yet surging—\nSpirit relies on *qi* to stand,\n*Qi* relies on spirit to move,\nWithout knowing yet knowing,\nWithout awareness yet aware—\nThe Gateway of the Mysterious *yin* (womb) is already established.\n\nFrom this point, one must diligently uphold the rule,\nConcentrating the spirit beyond form.\nWith each inhalation and exhalation,\nEach advance and retreat,\nOne must ensure *qi* returns to the Mysterious opening.\nBreathing naturally as Heaven dictates—\nThis is the root of Heaven, Earth, and all beings,\nThe foundation of sages, immortals, and Buddhas—\nThe most profound secret of our Daoist school,\nNot to be carelessly revealed.\n\nFor cultivators’ practice,\nRather than seeking the boundless and unattainable,\nWhy not seek the *yin* and *yang* with tangible proof?\n\nThe generation of presence and absence,\nIs but movement and stillness,\nStillness and movement,\nEmerging from the Mysterious and entering the *yin* (womb),\nHarmonizing the principles of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nDifficulty and ease completing each other,\nIs but firmness and yielding,\nYielding and firmness,\nThe cauldron, furnace, lute, and sword—\nOne simmers, one warms.\n\nLength and shortness defining one another,\nIs the inhalation and exhalation,\nThe advance and retreat of the *Task* (governor) and *Du* (conceptor) vessels—\nThe forward movement is short,\nThe backward movement is long.\n\nHeight and low inclining toward one another,\nIs fire above yet making it descend,\nWater below yet making it ascend—\nThe wondrous reversal of above and below,\nThe transformation of *kan* and *li* (water and fire).",

the front—\n*Kan* and *Li* (water and fire) in union,\nA harmonious whole, clinging yet never parting.\n\nThese are all the return of *yin* and *yang* from the post-heaven realm\nTo the pre-heaven realm of *wuji* (non-extreme).\n\nThe sage understands the origin of the Dao/Way,\nVague and boundless, vast and traceable—\nIn their conduct, they esteem *wuwei* (non-action),\nAnd follow the manner of *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),\nWhereby they are revered without boast.\n\nIn their teaching, they uphold *buyan* (non-speech) as their principle,\nAnd illustrate the wondrous method of *guohua cunshen* (transcending transformation to preserve the spirit).\n\nThe sage acts, yet all things behold them—\nWhat difficulty could there be?\n\nEven in the tilling of fields and the digging of wells,\nThey are born to life yet forget their own practice;\nIn regulating the source and conserving the flow,\nThey diligently guide transformation yet conceal their own traces.\nThough their merit fills the heavens and earth,\nAnd their fame echoes across the land,\nThe sage regards it as shame—\nFor hollow titles are never matched with true accomplishment.\n\nHow could this be compared to the *Book of Documents* saying:\n*\"You alone do not boast, do not claim—*\n*None under heaven can contend with you in ability,*\n*None can contend with you in merit.\"*\nYet even this still harbors the thought of *miren zhangjing* (dispelling strife and competition)?\n\nThis is truly the realm of *shenhua* (spiritual transformation),\nThe *danding* (tranquil and settled) heaven,\nWhere one simply finds contentment in their own nature,\nAnd never forgets the true essence of self-realization.\n\nThe ancients spoke of viewing wealth and nobility as floating clouds,\nAnd discarding fame as worn-out footwear—\nWas this not their meaning?\n\nThough so, when the Dao is complete,\nVirtue/power establishes itself,\nAnd true attainment naturally brings renown.\n\nThe sage, though not dwelling on merit,\nIs praised by the world and posterity—\nTheir merit shines like the sun and moon,\nTheir fame weighs heavy in ancient and modern times.\nIt is only because they do not claim,\nThat it is never lost.\n\nStudents must cultivate from the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nNurturing forth the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,\nOnly then can their cultivation be said to have genuine roots.\n\nWhat is this Dao/Way?\nThe *xuan guan* (mysterious aperture)!\n\nAbandon this, and there is no life.\nFor those who cultivate the Dao/Way,\nAbandoning this mysterious aperture,\nThere is no other Dao/Way.\n\nIf one takes beauty and virtue/power as the Dao/Way,\nIt belongs to the dust of post-heaven concerns.\nThe *Taoist Canon* warns of this,\nHoping people will trace the flow back to its source.\nOtherwise, the praise of beauty and virtue/power\nIs also for the gentlemen of the Three Dynasties—\nHow could one blame them too harshly?\n\nThe *I Ching* says:\n*\"One *yin* and one *yang*, this is called the Dao/Way.\"*\nThus *yang* is not the Dao/Way,\nAnd *yin* is also not the Dao/Way—\nThe Dao/Way lies between *yin* and *yang*!\n\nMoreover, the Dao/Way is principle,\nWhile *yin* and *yang* are *qi*.\nPrinciple without *qi* cannot manifest,\nAnd *qi* without principle cannot move.\nTo speak of the Dao/Way alone is formless and elusive—\nOnly when observing where *yin* and *yang* emerge,\nCan one truly grasp its foundation.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the true essence of neither beauty nor virtue/power,\nDirectly piercing the root of the Great Dao/Way,\nUrging people to establish their foundation and extreme,\nAs the basis for cultivating the self and governing the world.\n\nThe phrases on presence and absence, ease and difficulty,\nTeach people to return from the duality of *yin* and *yang*\nTo the true unity of *qi*.\n\nWithin this, it also teaches people\nTo seek the mysterious aperture from the interplay of presence and absence,\nAs the fundamental root of alchemical refinement.\n\nAs for guarding the middle and nurturing the elixir,\nRevitalizing *yang* within the *Du* vessel,\nOperating the *heche* (river car),\nAll are progressively unraveled.\n\nOnly the sage points directly to its source,\nThus *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *wuwei* (non-action),\nSilent yet trusted—\nThough there be action and creation,\nIn themselves, there is no trace of virtue/power.\n\nWhen their work is complete and they retire,\nThey regard wealth and nobility as of no consequence—\nWho but the sage could attain this learning?\n\nStudents who ponder and gain insight,\nNot only have a basis for their practice,\nBut also a path to transcendence.\n\nOther commentaries say:\n*\"All under heaven know why beauty and virtue/power are beautiful and virtuous—*\n*Then they themselves will not be evil or unvirtuous.\"*\nThis explanation is also correct.\n\nBut the *Taoist Canon* often speaks from the source,\nWithout falling into the realm of the Two Vehicles.\n\n**Chapter Three** does not show what is desirable,\nDoes not exalt the worthy—\nSo the people do not contend;\nDoes not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nSo the people do not become thieves;\nDoes not show what is desirable,\nSo the heart does not become disordered.\n\nThus the sage’s governance,\nEmpties the heart, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones,\nEver keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,\nSo that even the wise dare not act.\n\nTo do *wuwei* (non-action),\nIs to have nothing left ungoverned.\nThe sage’s governance of the world,\nRather than having action,\nIs to prefer non-action—\nEven more, to not knowingly act while non-acting.\n\nIn transforming the people and establishing customs,\nRather than being able to influence,\nIt is better to be able to transform—\nEven more, to let them rest in harmony with the natural state of no affairs.\n\nThus Yao and Shun, with *gongji* (humble self-restraint) and *chuangshang* (hanging sleeves),\nBrought the four quarters to reverence and moved them by their example—\nWhat profound method of transformation is this?\n\nIt is merely:\nThe ruler’s own emptiness brings the people stillness,\nThe ruler’s own lack of partiality brings the people rectitude,\nThe ruler’s own lack of desire brings the people stability.\n\nOtherwise, in their bustling and meddling,\nThey believe they are bringing benefit and removing harm to the people,\nYet they do not realize that their disturbance of the people is indeed great.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe people originally have no contention,\nYet the ruler contends and seizes;\nThe people originally have no greed,\nYet the ruler is greedy and covetous;\nThe people originally have no thoughts or desires,\nYet the ruler leads them with strange arts, seductive cunning,\nGay attire, and delicious food.\n\nCould one then make the people free from contention, greed,\nAnd all cravings and partialities?\n\nIf the ruler can cultivate their own self,\nRectify their own heart,\nAnd remain serene and detached,\nWith no involvement in any affairs,\nAnd does not exalt the worthy and able,\nThen the people naturally settle and are at peace, without contention;\nIf the ruler does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,\nThen the people value modesty and shame,\nAnd do not become thieves.\n\nMoreover, the fields of sound, color, wealth, and profit are varied—\nIf the eyes are without sight and without desire,\nAnd the ruler and the people each find contentment in their own natural state,\nThen the spirit, which is *xu ling huo po* (empty, responsive, fluid, and lively),\nNaturally remains ever responsive and ever still, without disorder.",

      "translated_text": "「Is this matter one that only the extraordinary can achieve? Only the Sage can close off the ears and eyes, sever all crooked and private inclinations, and embrace *One* to empty their heart. When the heart is empty, the foundation for refining the elixir is established. Thus, they gather the *Daoist* **Lingyang** (精陽, the refined yang-qi of heaven and earth) to transform the **Yinjing** (陰精, primordial yin-essence), day by day, month by month. Naturally, the yin-essence diminishes and the yang-qi flourishes, filling the belly so that the form is preserved—this is what is called \"concentrating the *Dao* to solidify the body, employing techniques to prolong life,\" the very method of transcending birth and escaping death. Furthermore, through focused *qi* to achieve softness, one is like an infant whose strength is weak and cannot grasp objects. Though supremely soft, when moved, it becomes firm. Observing its vast and profound nature, its towering and surging essence, it truly encompasses heaven and earth with abundance. All the senses of knowledge and the inclinations of craving—where do they retreat and dissolve? The Sage cultivates themselves with this.\n\nTo govern the world, they must first be without knowledge or desire—\nNot only do the foolish wander in muddled confusion,\nBut even the clever and learned *Rujia* (儒, Confucian scholars),\nWho daily boast of their abilities and rely on their wisdom,\nFearful lest they fail to assert themselves,\nAt this point, having become serene and detached, their private thoughts of knowledge and cleverness\nAll merge into simplicity and purity.\nThis is the power to act yet not act—\nNot because they cannot, but because they dare not.\nNevertheless, humans cannot escape the *void* while alone transcending the material world;\nThey must follow the *Dao* of human relations and daily practice.\nYet how can they avoid action entirely?\nBut if they follow nature and act without contrivance,\nEven if they act, it remains as *non-action*—\nJust as Heaven speaks not yet transforms all things,\nAnd the seasons proclaim their teachings without words.\nThe Emperor governs without action, and the ministers administer the affairs.\nThe trace of action is in the *form* (迹), while the essence of non-action is in the *spirit* (神).\nThus, seated in state with hands clasped,\nThe whole realm rejoices in peace and harmony—\nAh, how magnificent!\n\nThe *Dao* is inherently plain and ordinary,\nNot seeking to display novelty or oddity,\nNor to exalt the strange and unusual.\nWhen a state honors the worthy and able,\nIt is indeed a good thing,\nBut if they boast and vie over this,\nThe truly worthy remain worthy,\nYet the unworthy will also feign virtue.\nEven worse, the worthy may condemn the unworthy as unworthy,\nWhile the unworthy condemn the worthy as unworthy—\nThus, contention arises.\nEach side mutually flaunts their merits,\nTaking turns to support factions,\nAnd from this, the world becomes embroiled in affairs.\nWhen a state manages finances,\nIt is also a common practice,\nBut if they prize rare goods and treasure distant commodities,\nThe people will climb mountains and cross seas,\nRisking peril and danger,\nUndeterred by the hardships of travel or the fear for their lives,\nTo gather and present them to the court.\nWhen they fail to obtain these,\nThey resort to every scheme imaginable—\nEven thieves and brigands will not hesitate to seize them.\nAs for clothing and food,\nThese are also daily necessities,\nYet if one insists on delicacies and rare dishes,\nAnd seeks only fine silks and embroidered garments,\nSeeing what is desirable and desiring it—\nWhen will this extravagant trend be corrected?\n\nThus, the Sage values the inner over the outer,\nNecessarily nurturing the *heart* (神) with emptiness,\nAnd filling the belly to nourish the *qi* (氣),\nSo that the *heart* and *qi* merge into one,\nFlowing harmoniously throughout the body—\nSmooth and integrated, soft and joyful,\nAnd the will becomes weak.\nMoreover, when the *heart* is still as a mountain,\nAnd the *qi* flows like a spring,\nThe bones grow strong.\nEver embracing *One* (抱一),\nAnd guarding the *Middle* (守中),\nNot only does one remain without desire or thought,\nBut even the clever and learned,\nFeeling the influence, are transformed within,\nDaring not to act arbitrarily.\nSome say, \"If one acts, it will lead to chaos and criticism;\nIf one does not act, it will invite ridicule for its purity.\"\nBetween action and non-action, the distinction is indeed subtle.\nYet to act in accordance with nature—\nThis is not reckless action;\nAction and non-action are equal in essence.\nThus, Confucius praised Shun (舜), saying:\n*\"Is it not Shun who governs without action?\"*\n**Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Common**\n\nThe *Dao* is boundless yet applied—\nSometimes it does not fill,\nProfound, like the source of all things.\nIt dulls the sharp, resolves the tangled,\nHarmonizes its brilliance,\nMerges with the dust.\nDeep and still, as if it existed—\nI know not whose child it is,\nResembling the Emperor before all beginnings.\nThe Emperor (帝) is the **Tian Di** (天帝, Heavenly Sovereign).\nThe *beginning* (先) is the beginningless beginning.\nWhat is the *Dao*?\nThe **Taihe** (太和, Great Harmony) of *One Qi* (一氣),\nFilling and permeating the heavens and earth,\nIts extent encompassing the universe,\nIts essence permeating past and present,\nIts *virtue/power* (德) reaching all nine regions and myriad lands.\nFrom the *taihuan* (胎卵, womb and egg) to the *shihua* (湿化, damp transformation),\nFrom the *feizhan* (飛潛, flying and burrowing) to the *dongzhi* (動植, moving and growing),\nNo place exists where it is not present.\nHow vast is the *Dao*?\nYet its substance is empty, void, and boundless—\nWithout form, yet overflowing.\nWhen it manifests and takes action,\nIt is vast and harmonious in its embrace,\nApplied here and there, yet always fitting.\nThe *Classic of Poetry* says:\n*\"Left and right, left and right—\nThere is nothing it does not suit;\nLeft and right, left and right—\nThere is nothing it does not possess.\"*\nTruly like rivers converging at the sea,\nYet the sea does not appear to be full—\nIs it not indeed the fundamental principle of all things?\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"The virtue/power (德) of ghosts and spirits\nNourishes all things without remainder.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Speak of small matters without breaking them,\nSpeak of great matters without exhausting them.\"*\nIts vast and profound nature is truly inexhaustible.\n\nThe *Dao* is so difficult to describe—\nHow then shall later generations cultivate it?\nThe **Taishang** (太上, Supreme Sage) out of compassion for ordinary people,\nPoints to its essence, saying:\n*\"The reason ordinary people cannot enter the *Dao*\nIs that those with cleverness and wisdom,\nRelying on their own abilities,\nAct arbitrarily and haphazardly,\nThus, their minds become obstructed,\nAnd the empty, responsive essence is not seen.\nNow, to cultivate the *Dao*,\nOne must know that cleverness and wisdom\nAre all demons that obstruct the *Dao*.\nFrom this point onward,\nOne must abandon cleverness and lose wisdom,\nSet aside the private inclinations of the ears and eyes,\nAnd return all to the undifferentiated chaos—\nAll the sharpness of boasting in ability,\nRelying on wisdom,\nArrogance toward things,\nAnd domineering over people,\nMust be completely blunted and extinguished,\nSo that the human heart dies and the *Dao* heart is born,\nKnowledge vanishes and *wisdom* (慧) shines forth.»",

      "translated_text": "The sages of old said: *\"Those with cleverness and wisdom are not to be feared,\nBut those who sink deeply into the *Dao*, purify the heart, and observe its principles—these are truly to be feared.\nIs this not the truth?*\n\nThe practitioner must take as primary\nSettling the spirit, refining thoughts,\nReducing desires, and clearing the heart.\nYet how can one know?\nThe spirit of perception, thought, and deliberation—\nThe turbulent, false, and impure thoughts—\nSwirl and disturb in ceaseless flux:\nThis thought not yet stilled, another arises;\nThis reflection not yet extinguished, another follows.\nI must exhort and encourage myself,\nGrant myself patience and release—\nAs tangled silk, I must trace its threads and unravel it;\nAs overgrown vines, I must uproot them and clear the ground.\nThus, all confusion dissolves,\nAnd the *Heavenly Sovereign* remains ever serene.\n\nYet this is but the practice of solitary stillness,\nStill not reaching the clamor of the world.\nIf one can be still but not move with the world,\nIt remains a rootless study.\nOne must examine oneself in stillness,\nBut when entering bustling scenes,\nOne must be all the more vigilant and cautious!\nIn all things, yield precedence to others,\nPlace yourself behind them,\nHold others above you,\nAnd willingly submit below them.\nThus, there will be no conflict with the world,\nNo strife with others.\n\nMoreover, men delight in the like and reject the unlike—\nThis is the common nature of the world.\nI must only follow the currents, conform to their kind,\nAnd harmonize with them.\nThough I possess a luminous and upright heart,\nI will not display its sharp edges.\nI must only silently recognize their ways,\nSubtly uphold their form,\nFavor those who align with me,\nAnd tolerate those who do not.\nThus, the people of Lu hunted hares,\nYet Confucius also hunted hares.\nIn ancient times, when the *Dao* was not yet illuminated,\nThe sages all mixed with the vulgar thus.\n\nAgain, observe the Sixth Patriarch:\nThough his *Dao*-fruit was complete after receiving the robe and bowl,\nIts subtlety was not yet exhausted.\nThus, he remained in the world, dwelling in Four Assemblies Mountain,\nLiving among hunters, unperturbed by their ways,\nAnd so escaped harm.\nHad he not blended with the dust and followed the light,\nHow could he have long preserved his life?\n\nThrough such dynamic and static cultivation,\nEver adapting with skill,\nThe originally pure, still, and luminous essence\nNaturally remains embraced—\nYet it is not a fixed attainment:\nIf it seems to be somewhere, to be stored,\nIt is not truly stored.\nA single radiant light flickers beneath the golden court.\nWhat *Dao* is this?\n\nIt arises before Heaven and Earth,\nMingles within the void.\nI do not know from whence it comes,\nNor to where it goes—\nWhose child is it, truly?\nThe *Classic* says: *\"There is a thing, mixed and complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\"*\nIs this not the profound mystery of the *Dao*?\n\nWhat form did the *Emperor* have before?\nIt was nothing but the undifferentiated chaos,\nThe indistinct *Hun-Meng*,\nA single breath of empty clarity.\nWhen the One Principle gave rise to myriad transformations,\nAnd all things returned to spring,\nThe *Dao* dispersed through Heaven, Earth, and all beings—\nYet it remains beyond measure.\nThe cultivator who seeks to illuminate the *Dao*-body\nMust observe the moment when Heaven and Earth are on the verge of opening,\nWhen the unopened suddenly opens,\nAnd thus discern the source of the *Dao*—\nThen the foundation for practice will not lack.\n\nThe *Most High* outlines the *Dao*-body for all to see,\nAnd teaches those who cultivate the Great *Dao*\nTo first recognize the *Dao*-source.\nTo seek the *Dao*-source,\nOne must first, within one’s own heart-nature,\nEliminate deceit and preserve sincerity,\nAnd through gradual study,\nEventually reach the realm of spiritual transformation,\nOnly then knowing that within one’s heart-nature\nLies the essence of the *Dao*,\nEver present, never leaving one’s embrace.\n\nOne must seek its beginnings in stillness,\nUsing cultivation, reflection, and preservation\nTo safeguard the original purity,\nNot overwhelming others with arrogance,\nNor confusing the mind with excess.\nThis is what Zhangzi called *\"liberation from private desires.\"*\n\nParting the clouds to reveal the blue sky,\nSevering the vines to expose the true face—\nWhen one moves among people,\nOne must not conceal one’s light while displaying it,\nNor blend with the dust while remaining in it.\nSome may flaunt their cleverness and wisdom,\nOthers their abilities,\nOr perhaps assume the guise of a recluse in mist and stone,\nDisplaying an air of lofty detachment.\nObserving history, many have invited disaster and calamity\nThrough such harm to the *Dao*.\n\nLike the Han dynasty’s imprisonment of Confucius,\nOr the *Qingliu* disasters of the Jin—\nThough rooted in the treachery of petty men,\nIt was also because they did not know the *Dao* of preserving life through wisdom.\n\nIf one blends with the world, follows the light,\nAnd mingles with the dust like the *lingzhi* among common grasses,\nOr the phoenix flying with ordinary birds—\nUnheard yet fragrant, unseen yet exalted—\nThus hiding one’s talents,\nThus nurturing oneself directly,\nThen the still and ever-present *Dao*\nWill hover between the eyebrows,\nExisting yet not existing,\nHaving form yet none.\n\nAs the *Zhongyong* says:\n*\"The carriage of Heaven moves without sound or scent.\"*\nWhat else could be before the *Emperor*?\n\n**Chapter Five: Not Knowing to Guard the Center**\n\nHeaven and Earth are not kind;\nThey treat all things as sacrificial dogs.\nThe sage is not kind;\nHe treats the people as sacrificial dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet not collapsing,\nMoving yet ever producing more.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nBetter to guard the center.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nThe ceaseless generation and transformation,\nThe unrestrained motion—\nAll depend on this original *qi*,\nSustaining all between them.\nIt props up Heaven above,\nSupports Earth below,\nAnd flows through all beings,\nExcluding none.\n\nWhen this *qi* is undifferentiated and boundless,\nIt governs all things in orderly harmony—this is *principle*.\nWhen it is vast and pervasive,\nEncompassing all things,\nFlowing and turning freely—this is *qi*.\nThe unity of *principle* and *qi* is *virtue*.\n\nThus, the sages of old said:\n*\"The virtuous one, with all human desires exhausted,\nAllows Heaven’s *principle* to flow freely,\nWithout a trace of artificiality.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "everness and wisdom\nAre all demons that obstruct the *Dao*.\nFrom this point onward,\nOne must abandon cleverness and lose wisdom,\nSet aside the private inclinations of the ears and eyes,\nAnd return all to the undifferentiated chaos—\nAll the sharpness of boasting in ability,\nRelying on wisdom,\nArrogance toward things,\nAnd domineering over people,\nMust be completely blunted and extinguished,\nSo that the human heart dies and the *Dao* heart is born,\nKnowledge vanishes and *wisdom* (慧) shines forth.»",

      "translated_text": "「”Further, it says: *“Generating and transforming is called *Dao/Way* (仁).”* In essence, *Dao/Way* (仁) is like the *Dao/Way* (仁) inherent in wood: its generative *principle* (理) and generative *qi* (气) are fully complete without exception.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, all things are born; the sages nourish all people—none of this is without the *principle* (理) and *qi* (气) permeating through it. How could it be so trifling as to be seen merely in outward actions?\n\nThus, the *Taoist Master* (太上) spoke to clarify the *Dao/Way* (道):\n*\"If Heaven and Earth lacked this vital generative *qi* (生气), relying only on the teachings of the four seasons and the alternations of cold, heat, warmth, and coolness—\nmerely passing through cycles of movement—\nthen all things would lack any foundation to draw upon.\nHow would *qi* be received?\nHow would form be established?\nIn their view, all things would be as light as straw dogs (刍狗),\nutterly unworthy of regard,\nand would only see their gradual decay.*\n\n*\"If the sages lacked this true primordial essence (真元心体), depending solely on ministers, officials, and the promulgation of decrees, laws, and regulations\nto instruct the common people,\nthen the rural masses would have no way to observe or be moved,\nand how would people be transformed?\nHow would households prosper?\nIt would be as if the sages regarded these people as lowly as straw dogs (刍狗),\ncompletely indifferent to their well-being,\nand would only see their ruin and destruction.*\n\n*\"Yet why does Heaven and Earth, though lacking conscious intent (无心),\nencompass all things—wind, cloud, rain, and dew—\nwithout a single being excluded?\nAnd why do the sages, though silent in speech (忘言),\nassist and perfect all beings,\nso that none fail to thrive within the world?\nThis clearly shows that Heaven, Earth, and the sages\nall rely on this original generative *qi* (一元真气),\npermeating and nourishing beings and things—\nthough there may be deprivation,\nthere is also creation;\nthough there may be coercive power (刑威),\nthere is also virtuous transformation (德化).\nThis so-called ‘lack of *Dao/Way* (仁)’ is precisely the ultimate expression of Heaven, Earth, and the sages’ *Dao/Way* (仁).*\n\n*\"If people do not know the *Dao/Way* (圣),\nlet them observe Heaven and Earth:\nThe upper *qi* (上浮) solidifies as Heaven,\nthe lower *qi* (下凝) condenses as Earth.\nBetween them, it is hollow yet luminous (空洞了明),\nboundless and without obstruction (浑浩流转),\nas vast as the unfathomable belly of a gourd (橐), yet freely communicating (龠之相通).\nWhen it is empty and contains nothing (虚而无物),\nit naturally follows the *qi*'s rise and fall (随气机之升沉),\nunbent and unyielding (不挠不屈).\nWhen it moves and becomes sound (动而为声),\nit also listens to the transformations of beings and things (听人物之变化),\never producing more that is strange and marvelous (愈出愈奇).\nObserving Heaven and Earth,\nit is no different from the gourd and its hollow (橐龠).\nThe sages are surely no different either.*\n\n*\"The scholar who guards the center (守中) and embraces the One (抱一),\nboundless and without trace (空空无迹),\nvast and without end (浩浩无垠),\nthe deeper the concealment (藏之愈深),\nthe broader the manifestation (发之愈溥).\nCompared to those who fill halls with words (言堂满堂) or rooms with speech (言室满室),\nthe difference is as vast as Heaven and Earth (相隔不啻天渊).\nThose who rely on words to set teachings (以言设教)\nand exhaust their teachings through words (以教有尽),\nhow can they compare to those who treasure their vital essence (宝吾之精),\nnourish their generative *qi* (裕吾之气),\nand wander spiritually beyond form (神游象外),\nwhile their *qi* permeates the rules of the world (气注规中),\nensuring nothing is left untransformed?\nTruly great is the study of guarding the center (守中之学),\nthe essential path for cultivating the self (修身之要道).*\n\n*\"This is the original generative *qi* (一元真气).\nCultivating the self lies here,\ngoverning the world also lies here.\nBeyond this, so-called institutions and laws (制度法则)\nare like traps and snares (筌蹄) for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔).\nFish and rabbits must rely on traps and snares to be obtained,\nyet saying that one cannot catch fish and rabbits without them is wrong,\nand saying that traps and snares *are* the fish and rabbits is also wrong.*\n\n*\"The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir (金丹大道) is like capturing Yang to supplement Yin (采阳补阴):\nthe forward path is short,\nthe backward path is long;\nthe small return of the Jade Nectar (玉液小还),\nthe great return of the Golden Nectar (金液大还)—\nall are methods for catching fish and rabbits (取鱼兔之筌蹄).\nIf one regards them as the source of the Dao (道源),\none errs by a hair’s breadth and strays a thousand miles.*\n\n*\"Only this original *qi* (元气)

brilliance (金之精者不精),\nand their excellence (玉之良者不良).\nThus, to restore their original form (复原形),\none must not rely solely on washing away impurities (淘汰之力),\nbut also on the work of polishing and refining (琢磨之功),\nto return to their initial essence (还乎初质).*\n\n*\"The *Taoist Master* (太上) shows the starting point for practice:\n“‘The immortal *Spirit* (谷神) does not die.’*\nWhat is meant by *Spirit* (谷神)?\nMountain caves are called *gǔ* (谷), speaking of their emptiness (虚);\nVariation and unrestraint are called *shén* (神), speaking of their responsiveness (灵).\nNot dying (不死) means the unceasing clarity of awareness (惺惺不昧).\nIf one can nourish the body of emptiness and responsiveness (虚灵不昧之体)\nas the foundation for the elixir (丹头),\nthen cultivation and refinement will be effortless.*\n\n*\"Yet this is formless and shadowless (无形无影),\nungraspable and elusive (不可捉摸).\nOne must seek its traces in things that have sound and color (有声有色者).\nThe ancients said:\n“‘To make

the root of Heaven and Earth?\n\nWhen the cultivator draws the curtain to observe and reflect, in the state of undifferentiated ignorance, the common heart dies.\nSuddenly awakened and stirred, the Dao-heart is born.\nThis is called: stillness as **Original Spirit**, movement as **True Intention**.\n\nWithin this, when the prenatal breath stirs—do not rigidly cling to the **dantian**;\nrather, in the space neither inside nor outside, observe its rising and falling, its coming and going—\neffortless, lively, and unrestrained—\nand thus the true prenatal breath is attained.\n\nThe ancients said, *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Mother”*—\nthis exit is not one’s original face,\nthis entry is not one’s original face either.\nOnly in this space of exit and entry lies the subtle truth,\nwhich is **emptiness and responsiveness**.\n\nThis is the **True Yin** and **True Yang**,\nmanifesting as the **True One Qi**.\n\nIs there anything beyond this as the root of Heaven and Earth?\n\nKnow that the **Valley Spirit** is the principle of the **Supreme Ultimate**;\nthe **Mysterious Mother** is the **Yin-Yang qi**.\n\nIn the **pre-heaven**, principle and qi were originally one;\nin the **post-heaven**, principle and qi cannot be spoken of together.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao must seek this subtle orifice—\nthey must not be hasty in their intent,\nnor negligent in their awareness.\nOnly by relying on the empty **Mysterious Mother**,\nnurturing the **Valley Spirit** of emptiness and responsiveness,\nneither clinging nor rejecting,\nforgetting yet not assisting,\ncan it be attained.\n\nThus it is said:\n*“Continuous as if it exists,\nyet used without strain.”*\n\nThe **Great Dao** is formless, giving birth to Heaven and Earth.\nThe **Great Dao** is nameless, nourishing all things.\nThe Sage, though having substance, appears formless;\nthough real, appears empty—\nrevealing this most hidden, most subtle essence as the **Valley Spirit**.\n\nThe **Valley Spirit** is the spirit of the empty valley—\nwhen questioned, it responds as if answering;\nwhen called, it echoes as if replying—\nthis is immortality.\n\nIn the human body, it is the unified **emptiness and responsiveness** of true clarity.\nSince humans lost their innate virtue, the **Valley Spirit** has long been submerged!\n\nLater cultivators, seeking the **Valley Spirit** to remain eternal,\nthe **emptiness and responsiveness** to be unobscured,\nas the foundation of the Golden Elixir and the root of the Dao,\nmust revolve in the void without grasping—\nonly by observing the **subtle orifice** through **non-desire and desire**,\nwhen the **having and non-having** align,\nwhen the **subtle orifice** fully opens,\ndoes the **Mysterious Mother** stand revealed.\n\nThus it is said:\n*“This orifice is no ordinary orifice,\nHeaven and Earth together form it.\nCalled the **Divine Qi Hole**,\nwithin it lies the **Kān-Lǐ essence**.”*\n\nOnly when **essence, qi, and spirit** are fused as one\ndoes it become the **orifice of having and non-having**,\nthe **gate of life and death**;\notherwise, it remains an ordinary orifice,\nwith no **True One Qi** dwelling within—\nif empty, it falls into coarse vacuity;\nif solid, it is bound by form—\nneither is the body of **emptiness and responsiveness**.\n\nOnly this **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**—\nneither empty nor solid,\nboth empty and solid—\nholds an ineffable truth:\nstill, it is formless;\nmoving, it takes shape.\nStillness is not the root of Heaven and Earth,\nmovement is not the origin of beings—\nonly at the juncture of stillness and movement\nlies the **Kān-Lǐ inversion**,\nthe realm where **sun and moon intersect**—\ntruly the **Heavenly Root and Earthly Cavern**.\n\nWhen the student attains the **True Mysterious** and **True Mother**,\neach ascent and descent—\nthe qi within this space,\ncondensed as **nature**,\nemanating as **emotion**—\nfrom the **extreme emptiness and profound stillness**,\nthe **Law-forms** arise.\n\nKnowing this orifice,\nthe Dao of immortality is exhausted here.\n\nWhen it says *“Continuous as if it exists”*,\nit means nourishment must be sustained long,\nbefore the prenatal breath can stir.\nWhen it says *“Used without strain”*,\nit means extraction and supplementation must be timed,\nso the **sympathetic fire** is neither recklessly added nor diminished.\n\nIf one follows the **natural Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\nthe Golden Elixir will be obtained.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Endures, Earth Persists**\n\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can endure and persist\nis that they do not **self-generate**—\nthus they attain eternal life.\n\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last,\nyet his body is first;\nsets his body aside,\nyet his body is preserved.\nIs this not because he is without selfishness?\nOnly because he is without selfishness\ncan he fulfill his selfishness.\n\nThe **qi** of Heaven and Earth flows boundlessly,\nenduring countless eons without exhaustion,\nall because the **True One Sovereign** silently governs within—\nthis is why Heaven and Earth endure without limit.\n\nEven as they give birth and nourish all things,\nendlessly sustaining life,\nHeaven and Earth are never depleted—\nthis is why the **mechanism of qi** remains unbroken through the ages.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** said, *“Heaven endures, Earth persists”*—\nis this not true?\n\nYet why can Heaven and Earth endure and persist?\nBecause they do not **self-generate**.\nIf they had a **self-generating** intent,\nHeaven and Earth would have emotions,\nand Heaven too would age.\n\nOnly by not possessing their own life,\nand instead taking all beings as their life,\ndoes the unceasing generation of all beings\nbecome the unceasing generation of Heaven and Earth—\nthus, **eternal life**.\n\nMost people are ignorant of this principle of generation:\nthey do not seek life but seek death,\ndo not seek eternal life but seek swift death.\nThey drown in wealth, honor, fame, and power;\nthey sink in sounds, colors, goods, and profits.\nThey constantly calculate, endlessly scheme—\nin just a few years, their essence is exhausted,\ntheir qi weakened,\ntheir spirit and vitality scattered—\nthey toil through countless hardships,\nyet barely enjoy one lifetime.\nPursuing life only to court death—\nhow can this be lamented enough!\n\nThus the Sage follows Heaven and models Earth:\nhe does not chase after the world’s gains,\nnor does he greedily seek techniques for prolonging life.\nOnly the **Great Dao** comes first—\nhe clears his mind’s field,\nrefines his **command root**,\nand in all matters of nourishing the body,\nhe never has time to scheme—\nas if he places his body last,\nyet his body is preserved.\n\nIn the end, his **virtue** is established,\nand none surpass him among his kind;\nhis **name** is fulfilled,\nand later generations still revere

      "translated_text": "「The **Perfect Adept** understands this **mysterious mother** as the root of heaven and earth. Thus, within each breath—one inhalation, one exhalation—when the subtle **yang** stirs, he fixes his gaze with one eye, grasps it with one hand, and directs a drop of his own **mercury** to meet it. With left rotation and right withdrawal, he draws it back to the **middle elixir field**, congealing it so that it does not scatter. Then, he carries the **soul** and returns, embraces **unity** and dwells within it, without pause. In this way, the **true yang** flourishes, and the **true qi** moves powerfully.\n\nFrom this, he operates the **River Vehicle**, igniting fire from the **empty perilous acupoint** and drawing it to the **tail end**. He strikes the **Ninefold Iron Drum**, mobilizing the **Three-Legged Golden Toad**, ascending it to the crown—all must be done with **one heart** focused, unerring and unceasing—until it reaches the **mud pellet**, where the **Muni’s treasure pearl** is obtained. If he does not then **nurture and temper** it for a moment, the **mud pellet’s yin essence** will not transform, and how could **lead and mercury** fuse harmoniously? How could it become **sweet dew divine water** to moisten the hundred **vessels** of the body?\n\nOnce the **mud pellet** is nurtured, he further guides it downward through the **lower ninefold palace** and into the **crimson palace**, which is the **retreat of yin at noon**. Yet when advancing the fire, he must take its **rigidity**, not the **virtue/power** of **pure health**—otherwise, the **true gold** cannot ascend. At the time of **yin’s retreat**, he must take its **gentleness**, not the **virtue/power** of compliance—otherwise, the **yang lead** remains scattered, unable to subdue the **mercury** into **elixir**. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one focus **qi** to achieve **gentleness** like a newborn infant?\"*\n\nIts meaning instructs that after **yin’s birth**, one must maintain a **one-hearted** clarity, allowing the **vital mechanisms** to descend naturally, as they are, as they are, without adding a single intention or exerting a single force. This is the **gentleness** of the **Kūn hexagram**, the **Way** of the **Noble Person**’s cultivation. When descending to the **palace** for nurturing, returning to the **earthen cauldron**, and sealing it firmly, one must only dwell in **serenity and tranquility**, blending and calming it. In a mere instant, the **qi** breathes as if nonexistent, and the **spirit’s mechanisms** seem extinguished—this is the attainment of **gentleness**.\n\nAfter nurturing for a while, the **spirit** and **qi** return to their roots, like a **fire seed** in the furnace, slowly congealing and refining. If one does not let it wander recklessly, the **true qi** will naturally flow and circulate throughout the body. With **one heart** at peace, the limbs become supple, as if the body of an infant—soft as cotton, delicate as silk—exhibiting a **gentleness** that cannot bear the weight of things. This is sufficient evidence that the **elixir** is congealing.\n\nFrom this point, **lead and mercury** merge, and **water and fire** are harmonized. One must then **purify the heart** and **cleanse the mind**, cultivating the **true lead** in solitude. If the mind wanders even slightly, the **elixir** will scatter wildly—it cannot be refined, nor will the **lead** from the **water realm** belong to you. The *Scripture of Purity* states:\n*\"The heart without its heart, things without their things.\nThe void lacks nothing to void, the none lacks nothing to none—\nserene and ever still,\nnaturally tranquil.\"*\n\nAnd what flaw could there be?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"Can one purify and perceive the **mysterious** without flaw?\"*\n\nEven if the **external elixir** is obtained, if the **internal illumination** is not strict, then **human desires** remain uncleansed and **heavenly principle** impure. How could one attain a single **grain of barley**—**void** yet forming the **embryo**?\n\nWhen the **elixir** is present in the body, one must still **preserve essence** and **abundantly nourish qi**, to form the **sage’s womb**. Yet even so, **preserving essence** must follow **nature’s spontaneity**, and **nourishing qi** must align with **effortless ease**. This **non-preservation** surpasses preservation, and this **non-nourishment** surpasses nourishment. Otherwise, if one clings to **treasure** and **value**, harm is inevitable.\n\nThe **elixir** is the **primordial essence** of the **first heaven**, formless and without trace—why must it be made? If one seeks it through **manifestation**, one risks **stirring fire** in the **later heaven**, and the **Great Dao** of the **first heaven** will be lost. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one govern the people and rule the land without action?\"*\nThe people are likened to **essence**, the land to **qi**. The key to governing lies in **love** for the people. To establish laws and rule the land is but a minor relief for the **tyrant**—far from the **sage’s** effortless governance.\n\nThe **auspicious and harmonious** reigns, the **vital mechanisms** in contention—all lies between **action** and **non-action**. The **Way** of cultivating the body is to **stabilize essence** as the people’s security and **abundant qi** as the land’s prosperity. Refining oneself **stabilizes essence**, while **direct nourishment** fills **qi**. At its utmost, the **vast and mighty** **yang** overflows the two realms—yet even then, it is seen as an ordinary possession, a mundane practice. One does not boast of **capabilities**, nor does one flaunt **wisdom**. In **primordial unity**, one forgets to forget what is **full and complete**—**non-action** yet **great action** emerges.\n\nWhen the **student** reaches this stage—**essence overflowing**, **qi abundant**—if he nurtures it long enough, the **crown will naturally split open**, and he may ride the clouds, roam the islands, far surpassing those who formerly **strictly adhered** to **circular breathing** and **focused qi to achieve gentleness**. Hence it is said:\n*\"Can one open and close the **heavenly gate** without **femininity**?\"*\nThis refers to the former days of **adjusting spirit** and **nurturing the womb**—one could not avoid **femininity**. But now, with the **yang spirit** fully robust, **detached from the mundane body**, it bursts through the **heavenly gate**, ascending toward the **celestial expanse**—truly a joy!\n\nHow could **qi** be so robust? At this point, the **heart** is like a **clear mirror**, the **nature** as **still water**—**clear as the sky**, **lively as the earth**. All **perceptions and cognitions** of the **spirit of knowledge** dissolve into the **void**, transforming into the **primordial spirit**. Formerly, one knew what came before and was aware of what followed; now, **illuminated and transparent**, one is **omniscient yet unobstructed**.\n\nYet **ever-serene** and **ever-illuminated**, there is no **heart of serenity or illumination**; **ever-clear** and **ever-aware**, there is no **thought of clarity or perception**. It is as if all things come and are **reflected**—like a **high-suspended mirror**, nothing can hide. And all this is rooted in **non-action**, with **action** as its application.\n\nWhen **yang** has not yet arisen, one **accumulates essence** and **nurtures qi** to generate it. Once **yang** has arisen, one **treasures essence** and **abundantly nourishes qi** to store it. When later, one **remains in form** and **transforms the world**, having **accumulated merit** and **amassed virtue**, even in birth, one does not boast of **nurturing**—even in action, one does not rely on **clinging to gentleness**—even in longevity, one does not depend on **forced subjugation**.»",

      "translated_text": "「The **heart** of one **kalpa**—the **heart** of ten thousand **kalpas**—truly may be called the **Celestial Sovereign**, wielding the authority to govern **creation and transformation**. Hence, it is termed **\"Mysterious Virtue/Power.\"**\n\nHere, the nine stages of **foundation-building to obtain the elixir**, **refining the self to return the elixir**, and **shedding the mortal coil to attain the Pearl** are expounded—yet all boil down to **ultimate emptiness and profound stillness**, **embracing the Three and holding the One**, **vague and indistinct, dim and obscure** as the essence. From **self-cultivation within** to **returning the elixir**, one cannot depart from **blending the manifest with the unmanifest**, **transforming action into non-action**.\n\nFor **Primordial One-Element True Qi** dwells hidden within **void and nothingness**, beyond the realm of sight and sound. If one **extinguishes awareness** and **abandons action**, this **One-Element True Qi** remains ever-present.\n\nThus, the **Most High** declares:\n*\"Faint and indistinct, yet within it lies form;\nIndistinct and faint, yet within it lies substance;\nDim and obscure, yet within it lies essence.\"*\nThis reveals that **life gives birth to Heaven and Earth**—originally **chaotic and formless**, beyond comparison. Only by **unifying the spirit-mind** and **obliterating perception** does the **Dao** reside therein.\n\nShould one awaken to **Great Clarity and Awareness**, then **post-heavenal consciousness** arises in response to thoughts—no longer the **Primordial Original Spirit**. Thus, one must seek in **vagueness and indistinctness**, attain in **dimness and obscurity**. Let the cultivator know whence to begin.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: Non-Action as Function**\n\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub—when the **hub is empty**, the **function of the cart** arises.\nClay is molded into vessels—when the **center is hollow**, the **function of the vessel** arises.\nDoors and windows are carved for a room—when the **space is empty**, the **function of the room** arises.\nThus, **having** is for **utility**, while **emptiness** is for **function**.\n\nThe **Dao** originates at the **Primordial Chaos**, merging within **void and nothingness**—invisible, inaudible. How then does the cultivator proceed?\n\nThe Sage knows the **substance of the Dao** is formless, yet its **function** manifests in forms. Thus, **manifesting the unmanifest**, **embodying the empty**, they **plunder qi from the Chaos** and **withdraw the spirit from the dim**, to complete the **Great Dao of True Unity** and eternally become **immortal and transcendent**.\n\nWhat is called **\"substantial and manifest\"**? The **True Yin and True Yang**, beings of the same kind.\nWhat is called **\"empty and unmanifest\"**? The **Primordial Dao’s root**, the **Dragon-Tiger Eight-Trigrams’ initial tension qi**.\n\nWhere there is **qi without substance**, the **Dao is manifest**.\nThus it is said: *\"When Yin and Yang unite, Primordial Qi appears; when Yin and Yang separate, Post-Heavenal form is complete.\"*\nThe *Classic of Change* states:\n*\"Above form, it is called the Dao; below form, it is called Qi.\"*\nIt is not that there is no vessel without the Dao, nor is it that there is no Dao without a vessel to bear it.\n\nThe **Most High** illustrates with the cart:\n*A cart has spokes and a hub—thirty spokes symbolize the movement of sun and moon, while the hub sits centrally, pierced by all axles. The hub is hollow within, the spokes converge without—thus it turns without hindrance. Were it not for this inner void, how could one be carried? How could things be stored?*\nHence, *\"When the hub is empty, the cart’s function arises.\"*\n\nAgain, like pottery:\n*Mixing water with clay, kneading into vessels—once fired, the exterior is solid, the interior hollow. Yet in all human utility, the value lies not in the clay’s substance but in the hollow’s emptiness. As with Tao Qian transporting bricks, were there not this empty space, how could they move freely?*\nHence, *\"When the center is empty, the vessel’s function arises.\"*\n\nSimilarly, in building a room:\n*One must carve doors and windows—only then does light radiate fully. Yet upon entering, the doors and windows seem unnecessary; it is the empty space that allows one to sit comfortably, though the room itself is formed. Hence, *\"When the space is empty, the room’s function arises.\"*\n\nFrom these three examples, **emptiness** manifests as **form** for the **cart, vessel, and room**; **emptiness** manifests as **void** for **carrying, storing, and dwelling**. Yet what pertains to **manifest forms** is the **utility of extension**; what pertains to **unmanifest void** is the **function of extension**.\n\nThus it is said: *\"Having is for utility; emptiness is for function. Having and lacking, lacking and having—each is the root of the other.\"*\n\nIn essence, the **Dao** originates from **void and nothingness**, yet without **Yin and Yang**, it cannot be seen. **Qi** belongs to **Yin and Yang**, yet without the **Dao**, it cannot arise. **Yin and Yang** emerge after **Heaven and Earth**, with defined shapes and locations—**they cannot be the elixir of longevity**. Only by seeking the **Dao** within **Yin and Yang**, returning through **Yin and Yang** to the **Primordial Pole**, can **before and after merge**, and the **Great Dao** be attained.\n\nLater **elixir cultivators**, serving only **manifest qi**, fail to refine the **unmanifest elixir**. To seek transcendence while doing so—is this not like driving a cart southward while heading north?\n\nThe **Dao** has no name; it is **named Dao** by force.\nThe **Dao** requires no cultivation; it is **called cultivation** by force.\nFor the **Dao** as a thing—**ultimately empty, ultimately nothing**—only then can it be **ultimately divine, ultimately sage**.\n\nObserve how **Heaven and Earth’s qi** is clear and void, containing nothing. Yet when suppressed for long, the **qi-machine stirs**, and **Yin and Yang** arise. Then **forms and colors** emerge, **patterned and vivid**, filling the four quarters. Who created them? Who gave them birth?",
      "overlap_context": "on.\n\nWhen **yang** has not yet arisen, one **accumulates essence** and **nurtures qi** to generate it.

depths, one does not neglect its hidden source,\nThus it is not obscure.\n\nFrom this, it extends endlessly and subtly,\nContinuously and inextricably,\nIndescribable in form,\nYet all things arise from this **Hun Dun (混沌)**—\nThe **Daoist** *Zhuangzi* says: *“Wash the heart and retreat to the hidden depths”*—\nThis is its essence!\n\nThus it returns to the **Void of No-Thing (无物)**.\nThough No-Thing, yet the **ten thousand affairs and things of the world**,\nAll emerge from this **Void**.\n\nThe **Taoist Sage (太上)** speaks of the **formless Form (无状之状)**,\nThe **imageless Image (无象之象)**—\nBut what **Form** or **Image** is there indeed?\nOnly a fleeting glimpse in the **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**.\n\nTruly **dim and indistinct (恍惚)**,\nThe **True Primordial Qi (真元)** is born.\nIf one **welcomes its opportunity and guides it (迎其机而导之)**,\nIt seems to arise from nowhere—**the beginning is unseen (前不见其首)**;\nIf one **follows its movement and draws it (随其气而引之)**,\nIt ends without trace—**the end is unseen (后不见其尾)**.\n\nSuch is the **vastness of the Dao (道之浩浩)**—\nThis is not the **great cycle of the mundane world (大周沙界)**,\nNor the **subtle penetration into the minutest things (毫芒)**,\nBut the **Dao itself (是道也)**—\nWhat **Dao** is this?\nIt is the **Primordial Qi of Origin (元始一气)**,\nThe **true sovereign of the human body and its organs (人身官骸真宰)**.\n\nTo **obtain it** is to **live**,\nTo **lose it** is to **die**;\nTo **preserve it fully** is to **be human**,\nTo **neglect it** is to **be mere things**—\nIts **manifestation is but a hair’s breadth apart**.\n\nA **student of the Dao** who **attains this Primordial Qi (元始之气)**,\nAnd **regulates and nurtures the five organs and hundred bones (调摄乎五官百骸)**,\nWill have **luminous hair and skin, smooth and refined flesh**—\nThis is the **embodiment of ancient Dao (执古之道)**,\nTo **command the present (以御今之有)**.\n\nIf a **student of the Dao** can **recognize this Primordial Qi (元始一气)**—\nThe **origin of heaven and earth (开天辟地)**, before the **ancient times (太古)**—\nAnd **hold it as the framework of one’s body (以为一身纲纪)**,\nThe **core of all affairs (万事主脑)**,\nThen **one’s foundation is upright (体立)**, and **all else follows naturally (用自行)**,\n**One’s root is pure (本正)**, and **the branches align (末自端)**.\n\nIf a **student of the Dao** does not **take this Primordial Qi (元始一气)** as the foundation,\nAnd **seeks to cultivate awakened awareness (修正觉)**,\nHe **falls into false paths (反堕旁门)**—\nThis is truly **pitiable**!\n\nTo **grasp the Dao’s essence (状道之体)**,\nA **student of the Dao** must **understand this body (会得此体)**.\nFor **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** is the **source of innate life and death (先天性命之源)**,\nNot to be compared with **postnatal essence, Qi, and spirit (后天精气神)**.\n\nTo **perceive the vital breath (命气)**,\nOne must **merge the innate True One (性真)** with it,\nOnly then will **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)** be attained.\n\nThough this **Qi is formless and boundless (浑浑沦沦，浩浩荡荡)**,\nWithout **image or shape (虽无可象可形)**,\nYet all **images and shapes in the world (天下之有象有形者)**,\nEmerge from this **formless and imageless (无形无象)**.\nTruly the **pivotal foundation of the Dao (大道纪纲)**,\nThe **root of heaven, earth, and all beings (天地人物之根本)**.\n\nThe **Daoists** speak of **holding the center (守中)**,\nThe **Buddhist** speak of **contemplating emptiness (观空)**,\nThe **Confucians** speak of **cultivating solitude with caution (慎独)**—\nAll share the **same fundamental practice**.\n\nTo the **outer eye**, it seems **neither seen nor heard (无睹无闻)**,\nYet **within oneself**, it is **utterly clear (至虚至实，至无至有)**.\nThus **Zi Si (子思)** says:\n*“Do not reveal what is hidden,\nDo not display what is subtle.”*\n\nThe **scholar’s practice of solitude (君子慎独之功)** is **unceasing**.\nIn the **hidden, subtle, and secluded realm (隐微幽独之地)**,\nThough there may be **what can be displayed or grasped (可显可据)**,\nThe **Dao’s root and source (大道根源)** is **only the most elusive and mysterious (希夷微妙)**—\n**Indescribable yet described (无可状而状)**,\n**Formless yet imaged (无可象而象)**,\n**Exalted in its pristine unity (极其浑穆)**.\n\nA **student of the Dao** must,\n**Before Yang arises**, await it in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**,\n**When Yang is born**, welcome it in **dim and indistinct**,\n**When Yang returns to the furnace and enters the cauldron (归炉入鼎)**,\n**Preserve and nurture it in dim and indistinct**—\n**Never awakening a great luminous mind (绝不起大明觉心)**),\nOnly then will one **constantly attain the Dao’s return (无时无处而不得大道归源)**.\n\nEarlier, it was said that when the **Yang Spirit appears (阳神出现)**,\n**Heaven and earth are illuminated (明天察地)**,\n**He penetrates the mysterious and reaches the subtle (通玄达微)**,\nAnd **upon enlightenment (及了悟之候)**,\nThe **radiant landscape (光明景界)** is **purely natural (纯任自然)**—\n**Awareness seems as if it were not (有知若无知)**,\n**Perception seems as if it were not (有觉若无觉)**—\n\n**How much more so at the very beginning of practice?**\nCan one not **kill the mundane heart (死人心)** to **generate the Daoist heart (生道心)** in **dim and indistinct (恍恍惚惚)**?\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Subtle and Mysterious Communication**\nThe **ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,\nWere **subtle and mysterious (微妙玄通)**,\n**Deep beyond recognition (深不可识)**.\n\nBecause they were **beyond recognition (唯不可识)**,\nThey **forced a semblance of form (故强为之容)**:\n**Serious (豫)**, as if **crossing a river in winter (若冬涉川)**;\n**Cautious (犹)**, as if **fearing the four neighbors (若畏四邻)**;\n**Solemn (俨)**, as if **a guest (若客)**;\n**Dissipated (涣)**, as if **ice about to melt (若冰之将释)**;\n**Unadorned (敦)**, as if **raw and simple (若朴)**;\n**Vast (旷)**, as if **a valley (若谷)**;\n**Turbulent (浑)**, as if **muddy waters (若浊)**.\n\nWho can **clarify what is turbulent (浊以澄静)**?\nOnly **gradually (徐清)**.\nWho can **establish what is tranquil (安以久动)**?\nOnly **gradually (徐生)**.\n\nThose who **preserve the Dao (保此道者)** do not **seek fullness (不欲盈)**,\nThus they **remain unspoiled though worn (敝不新成)**.\n\nThe **Taoist Sage (太上)** spoke earlier of the **Dao’s essence (道体)**,\nNow he speaks of **those who embody the Dao (体道之人)**.\n**Man and the Dao** are **two as one (二而一)**—\nThe **Dao is invisible (无可见)**,\nYet **through man, it becomes visible (因人可见)**.\n\nHow can **man become immortal (人何能仙)**?\nThrough **the Dao (以道而仙)**.\n\nWhat is the **Dao (道者何)**?\nIt is **True Primordial Qi (真一之气)**—\nThe **virtue/power (德)** of the *Zhongyong (中庸)*.\n\nTo **cultivate the Dao**, is there **any other way (岂有他哉)**?\n**King Wen (文王)** was **dutiful and reverent (小心翼翼)**,\nServing the **Celestial Sovereign (上帝)** with clarity.\n**Confucius (孔子)** was **modest and restrained (足缩缩)**,\nAs if **following a path (有循)**.\n\nThe **Dao as Dao** is **nothing more than reverence (不过一敬)**.\nIf **man can dwell in reverence (以敬居心)**,\nWith **no thought left unguarded (一念不苟)**,\nAnd **no deed taken lightly (一事不轻)**,\nIs not the **Dao itself (大道)** here?\n\nThough the **Dao is not strange (无奇怪)**,\nIt **depends on those who embody it (尤赖有体道者)**—\nOnly then does the **Dao not hang empty in heaven and earth (不虚悬于天壤)**.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:\n*“The ancient masters who excelled in Daoist cultivation (古之善为士者)**,\n**Their actions were not dualistic (其为物不二)**,\nThus their **generation of things was beyond measure (生物不测)**.\nHow **subtle and mysterious (至微至妙)** is this Dao!\n\n*“Stillness yet responsive (寂然不动，感而遂通)**—\nHow **profound and penetrating (至玄至通)** is this Dao!\n\nIt is **only their vastness of heart (心之浩浩)**,\nAnd **their boundless Qi (气之洋洋)**—\nLike the **depth of rivers and seas (不啻江河之深)**,\nMaking one **unfathomable (无从测识)**.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:\n*“Because it is beyond recognition (夫惟不识)**,\nThey force a semblance of form (故强为之容)**.”*",

      "translated_text": "**The Dao of the Most High in Cultivating the Body is the Dao of Governing the World—nothing more than the singular True.**\n\nThe True, when held within oneself, refines the self;\nThe True, when applied to all things, fulfills the world.\nThough there be distinctions of inner and outer, self and others,\nThe True of this heart remains ever unchanging.\n\nIf one attains **至诚** without ceasing,\nThen the people’s response to them shall also be unceasing.\nIf one attains **至诚** with interruption,\nThen the world’s response to them shall also be interrupted.\n\nFor all share this heart, this heart shares this principle:\nCultivate the body, and the world naturally finds peace;\nLose the True, and the world must fall into chaos.\n\nFrom the **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors** down to the present,\nThere has never been one who differed in this.\n\nThe Most High wishes people to cultivate themselves with **sincerity and trust**,\nAnd thus governs them with **sincerity and trust**.\nWithout being seen, yet manifest;\nWithout acting, yet transforming;\nWithout doing, yet achieving.\n\nTo oneself, the Dao of governance is unknown;\nTo the people, it is felt through **ease and sincerity**,\n**Solemn reverence in proclamation**,\nAnd yet they do not perceive its transformation—\nNor know its origin.\n\nThis was the pure wind of antiquity;\nI have long failed to see it again.\n\nThus the Most High says:\n*\"The Most High—unknown to be known.\"*\nSo that ruler and people alike rejoice in **光天化日** beneath the radiant heavens and earth.\n\nIf **sincerity and trust** were not deeply rooted,\nHow could such **divine transformation** exist?\n\nThe **restoring wind of the ancient emperors** has faded long ago,\nThe **Most High’s perfect governance** is unheard of today.\nThus the customs decline, the **Great Dao** grows distant,\nAnd there are things too dire for words or witness.\n\nIf the ancient ways are not yet lost,\nIf the Dao still lingers,\nIf **天性** has not yet been obscured,\nAnd **至诚** remains,\nThen though not as profound as the **Most High’s** sincerity,\nIt is still the **light and splendor** of the present age.\n\nAll are ways of governance—\nOne without thought yet naturally transforming,\nOne with intent yet applying **仁**.\n\nTo cherish the people as one cherishes an infant,\nTo love the people as one loves family—\nIn such times, the **revered and long-lived** are honored,\nAnd their words are answered as echoes.\n\nYet when **ease and sincerity** are not uniform,\n**Virtue and transformation** cannot be equal.\nOnly through **cherishing and loving** them,\n**Praising and rewarding** them,\nWithout adding **harsh words or punishments**,\nDo they harbor **gratitude and fear**.\n\nThough not reaching the Most High,\nThis still follows the Dao, the path—\nPraiseworthy indeed,\nAs the saying goes: *\"When the Great Dao is abandoned, there are仁 and義.\"*\n\nThus **Emperor降** became **Emperor**, and **Emperor** became **King**—\nAll were those who knew **virtue** and practiced the **Kingly Dao**.\n\nLater, when the ancient customs grew distant,\nThe Great Dao more obscure,\n**King**降 became **Conqueror**,\nUsing **仁 and義** as pretexts,\nEach with their own heart, their own perception—\nFar removed from the **single virtue** of the emperors and kings.\n\nThus though **rites and teachings** remain,\nThough **laws and decrees** persist,\nThough **institutions and prohibitions** are unchanged,\nThe **True** of their hearts differs greatly.\n\nOnly through **talent and brilliance** do they govern the world,\nRelying on **laws and measures** to guide the people.\nWhen their administration is fitting,\nAnd their policies lawful,\nThe people fear them and dare not break laws or transgress rules—\nThis is the **clever ruler**, the **greatly peaceful age**.\n\nAnd those below them—\nToo dire to speak of.\n\nThey **trust in cunning** to drive the people,\nThey **indulge in deceit** to rule the masses,\nWith **狐狸** and **虎豹** hearts,\nThey enact **狐狸** and **虎豹**-like governance.\n\nWhen they are **haughty and self-proclaimed**,\nWhen they are **boastful and self-satisfied**,\nThere is none who does not think them wiser than the **Three Kings**,\nOr more talented than the **Five Conquerors**—\nYet the people of this age,\nIn the end, **fearful and trembling** in their sleep,\nAre truly **insulted and oppressed**.\n\nThough the people dare not speak,\nTheir hearts are divided and estranged,\nAnd thus there is no **unceasingly harmonious governance**—\nHence, disaster follows swiftly upon their heels.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"When the ruler values trust, the people will use their emotions.\"*\nIf trust is insufficient within oneself,\nHow can one expect trust from the people?\n\nThis is why ruler and people **deceive and trick each other**.\n\nWhen **institutions, teachings, laws, and decrees** are issued,\nEven the **Sage** does not abandon them—\nYet **emotion and falsity** are divided,\nAnd **response and resonance** differ.\n\nOnly the **Emperor and King** set the example with their bodies,\n**Trusting and inspiring** the people.\nWhen laws are established, governance follows;\nWhen words are spoken, the people believe.\nUltimately, their **light shines to the four quarters**,\nTheir **work is complete and their matter fulfilled**,\nAs **Yao** did in the **Age of Change and Prosperity**,\nAnd **Shun** in his **self-cultivation and non-action**—\nAnd the people all say, *\"It was natural.\"*\n\nAlas!\nThe reach of **true trust** is vast—\nCompared to those who lack trust within,\nThe difference is as vast as heaven and earth.\n\n**Dao and Virtue** are all-encompassing,\nRefining the self here, governing the world here—\nExtending to all things under heaven,\nNothing lies beyond this scope.\n\nThus the words *\"Most High\"* in this chapter\nRefer to those of the highest rank,\nPossessing the highest **quality**—\nHence, *\"Most High.\"*\n\nThe **highest virtue** is **清净** and **无为**,\nWith the **六根** all settled.\nNext, they **reverence and love**, transforming the people—\nWhen moved, they respond.\nNext, they **fear and awe**, ruling the world.\nNext, they **guide the people with cunning**—\nThis is called **术**.\n\nYet the most wondrous of all is **trust**.\n**Trust** belongs to **土**,\nAnd its cultivation is **修炼始终**—\nIts purest essence lies in **意土**.\n\nThus the Most High says:\n*\"Its essence is supremely true,\nAnd within it lies trust\"*—\nThis is the **elixir foundation**.\n\n**Trust** is nothing else—\n**至诚** alone.\nIf one attains **至诚** without ceasing,\nThen the **elixir** is the **elixir** indeed.\n\nYet **trust** and **falsity** are nearly indistinguishable—\nA moment’s thought leads to **sainthood**,\nNeglect leads to **madness**.\nThe boundary between **man and beast**,\nThe threshold of **life and death**—\nAll that is contested lies in this **interval**.\n\nI wish the **later scholars** to seek **true trust**,\nFor the **constant Dao** can be found therein.\n\nWhere is **trust**?\nIt is the **玄关** of a single aperture—\nDo people truly know it?\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Abandoned**\n\nThe **Great Dao abandoned**,\nThere are **仁 and義**.\n**智慧** arises,\nThere is **great deception**.\nThe **六亲** are not harmonious,\nThere are **孝 and慈**.\nThe state is **昏乱**,\nThere are **loyal ministers**.\n\nI have observed the **Age of the Most High**—\nCustoms were **敦厚** and **朴实**,\nPeople were **浑朴** and sincere,\nEach **正其性**, **定其命**,\n**安其俗**, **乐其业**—\nLike things following **天** and moving,\nLike nature acting as it will,\nWithout need of artifice or contrivance,\nNot awaiting arrangement or command,\nIn accordance with **性**’s natural course—\nAnd yet there were those who **did not know its origin**.",

Dao**.\n\nYet alas, the **royal winds** decline,\nThe **Great Dao** grows ever feebler.\nThose in high station then speak of **仁 and義**,\nDiligently toiling, none daring to stray.\nTo dwell in **義** while upholding **仁**,\nIs indeed a praiseworthy deed of sages—\nNot wholly to be condemned;\nBut compared to ancient times of flourishing **Dao**,\nWhen hearts were **浑噩** and minds unspoiled,\nWhere **仁 and義** existed without need of speech—\nThe difference is vast.\n\nThus the **Most High** sighed:\n*\"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**.\"*\n\nFrom this point on,\nBoth high and low covet **仁 and義**,\nYet those who claim them practice deceit,\nThough **仁 and義** still appear,\nTheir actions have grown corrupt.\nIs this because **仁 and義** are flawed?\nOr because the **Dao** is pierced and hollowed,\nAnd those ensnared by **仁**, enslaved by **義**, bring harm to it?\n\nStill, they call it **仁 and義**,\nThough not as pure as the **Great Dao**,\nIt has not yet fallen into **great deception**.\n\nAfter this,\nCustoms grew ever more perverse,\nHearts grew ever more corrupted.\nEven where **仁 and義** were taught,\nLittle remained—\nFor in the halls of court and the common folk,\nBetween ruler and subject,\nAll flaunted their **智** and paraded their **慧**,\nWithin their cliques,\nDeceit and suspicion reigned supreme.\nHow could such a people hope to **harmonize the family** or **govern the state**?\n\nThus, sons and fathers grew estranged,\nBrothers turned against one another,\nEven husband and wife, friends and neighbors,\nRelatives and townsfolk—\nEach with their own heart,\nEach with their own view,\nAs distant as **Hu and Yue**,\nLet alone the rest!\n\nIf a son could show **孝**,\nThe court would single him out for praise;\nIf a father could show **慈**,\nThe village would acclaim him in unison.\nAlas!\n**孝** and **慈** were ever the **constant Dao** of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **proper path** of the family—\nWhy should they be so celebrated?\n\nYet when **三党六亲** were forgotten,\nAnd **逆** winds grew fierce,\nWhen **阋墙** strife was common,\nThose who could show **孝** or **慈**,\nThough few and far between,\nWere held in great reverence,\nAnd their deeds proclaimed to inspire the world.\n\nHow far this falls from the **Age of the Most High**,\nWhen **孝** was natural and **慈** unspoken—\nWhen even the **孝** and **慈** of today\nAre but **反**—a forced return to harmony,\nWhere men now but **粉饰** and **铺张**,\nClaiming **慈孝** while taking its name in vain—\nHow many such hypocrites could be counted?\n\nAnd after the **五霸**,\nWhen kin destroyed one another,\nWhen lords and ministers exchanged hostages,\nIt is no wonder\nThat **昏庸** rulers arose above,\nAnd **跋扈** ministers below—\nAnd the state has known no peace since then.\n\nFortunate are those with **忠肝义胆**,\nWho rise to **安邦定国**,\nThough success or failure may not be foreseen,\nTheir **尽瘁鞠躬** loyalty is clear.\nYet their strength cannot turn back the tide of fate,\nNor their resolve preserve the whole of the world—\nLike **Zhuge Liang**’s six campaigns at **Qishan**,\nOr **Jiang Banyao**’s nine assaults on the **Central Plains**.\n\nConsider the subject’s lot:\nTo serve a lord, they wish to be **良臣**,\nNot **忠臣**.\nIf fortune favors the land,\nThey may share in **同襄补衮**’s duties—\nYet if **强梁** wars rise again,\nEach must display their **济世** talents.\nWhen the world is **昏乱**,\nHeaven reveals the **忠臣**;\nWhen **忠臣** arise,\nHeaven sustains the **昏乱**.\n\nThough **忠臣** may emerge,\nEven if they could purge the **昏乱**,\nAnd turn the land from **干戈** to **礼义**—\nIt would still pale in comparison\nTo the **Age of the Most High**,\nWhen all was **无事** and distant from strife.\nAlas!\nThe **忠臣** would rather **终身埋没**,\nThan see their name proclaimed—\nFor one man’s **忠臣** title\nBrings the world’s share of **昏乱** woes—\nA sorrow too great to bear!\n\nThis is the **Most High**’s lament for the **Way** of the world,\nHis grief for the present, his thoughts for the past,\nDesiring men return to **朴** and embrace **真**,\nThat high and low alike be **无知**—\nTheir **virtue** unbroken,\nTheir **Way** ever sufficient,\n**熙熙皞皞**, all under Heaven at peace in **无事**,\nYet unaware of their own **Way**.\n\nEven **仁**, **義**, **智**, **慧**,\n**孝** sons, **忠** ministers—\nAll are seen as natural,\nUnknown as virtues,\nAnd to name them would be shameful—\nWhat greater **浑朴** could there be?\n\nThough this speaks of **治世**,\nIt applies no less to **修身**.\nThe opening line likens the **浑沦** customs,\nWhere **太朴** has yet to be carved,\nTo the **章贞** body,\nUnadorned yet perfect in its **Dao**’s mystery.\n\nIf one loses their **本来之天**,\nThen they must borrow from **先天阴阳** to restore it.\n**阴阳** are but **仁 and義**—\nAs the saying goes:\n*\"The **Great Dao** abandoned, there are **仁 and義**.\"*\n\nTo discern the **真** messages within the body’s **内外**,\nAnd to nurture with **智慧** as if plucked from emptiness—\nHere, purity is lost,\nAnd **后天**’s influences creep in,\nSo **伪妄** cannot be avoided.\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"**智慧** arises, there is **great deception**.\"*\n\nAs for **采阴补阳**,\nIt is the means to **和** the **六根**’s discord,\nAnd bring them to **大定**—\nThe metaphor of **孝 and慈**.\n\nAnd **猛烹急炼**,\nThe way to **靖** the **昏乱** within oneself,\nAnd ascend to **清明**—\nThe essence of **\"loyal

the people return to **孝** and **慈**.\n\nTo discard **巧** and abandon **利**, thieves and robbers vanish;\nThese three measures, though insufficient for **文**’s adornment,\nAre thus established to ensure their proper application:\n*\"Seeing the unadorned, embracing the unadulterated,\nFew private affairs, few desires,\nDiscarding learning, free from worry.\"*\n\nAmong all people and things under Heaven,\nThe wise and foolish, noble and humble—\nNone escape the fundamental principle of **理** and **氣**’s harmony.\n\nYet why do they remain divided and obstructed?\nWhy do passions clash and intentions stumble?\nIt is because those above lack what to inspire,\nAnd those below lack what to transform them.\n\nThe **至聖** sovereigns of old\nFollowed the **Dao/Way** of nature,\nPracticed the governance of **無為**,\nDid not delight in deeds for the sake of achievements,\nNor weary of duties and abandon governance.\n\nThough they possessed keen **聰明** and profound **睿智**,\nThey all entered the realm of **無為** governance,\nThe **清淨** domain of purity,\nWhere the people below, observing and transformed,\nNaturally honored their own kin,\nNurtured their own offspring,\nStabilized their customs,\nFound joy in their labors—\nWithout a single person failing to restore their **性**,\nWithout a single thing failing to fulfill its **生**,\nTheir benefit was indeed a hundredfold!\n\nAs for the **至仁** sovereigns,\nWho naturally embrace **慈善**’s essence,\nWho possess **恻隐** (*cìcè*) compassion—\nThey dedicate themselves entirely to benefiting others and nurturing all things.\n\n**浩浩荡荡**, **浑浑沦沦**,\nThey neither speak of right and wrong,\nNor of crooked and straight,\nBut instead let Heaven move them,\nAnd follow their **性** in action—\nNaturally without favor or bias,\nThey return to the realm of **大中至正**—\nThe Great Centrality of Rectitude.\n\nThe people, inspired and transformed by this,\nAs sons naturally become **孝** to their parents,\nAs fathers naturally become **慈** to their children.\nEven if there are those who are unfilial or unkind,\nWhose habits become rampant,\nThey too will gradually be transformed—\nHow splendid and flourishing this is!\n\nIn later ages, the most **聰明** and **敏捷** sovereigns,\nThough they govern the world and rule with skill,\nDo not comprehend the **Dao/Way**’s foundation of **無為**,\nAnd thus, if they follow it, it is easy;\nIf they oppose it, it becomes difficult.\n\nSome delight in constant change and disturb the people,\nCreating laws and regulations,\nOnly to bring calamity to the state,\nWhere the people barely survive.\nOthers love martial prowess and neglect governance,\nExhausting armies and waging wars,\nOnly to deplete the treasuries,\nWhere the people cannot endure—\nNo wonder then that the people grow impoverished,\nThe nation falls ill,\nAnd the winds of **攘窃劫奪** (*rǎngqièjiéduó*)—theft and plunder—rise,\nWhile thieves and robbers openly roam the land.\nSuch is the fate of those **至巧** sovereigns,\nWho do not know to apply their **巧** to the **無為** of Heaven,\nTo the **自在** of nature—\nWho seek to enrich the state through greed,\nOnly to weaken its strength,\nAnd unsettle the people’s customs.\n\nIf they could achieve **至巧無巧**—\nExpressing their hearts as they truly are,\nGuiding the **勢** in harmony,\nUpholding **義** without scheming for **利**,\nClarifying the **Dao/Way** without calculating **功**—\nThen the **德** of the **君子** would be the wind,\nAnd the **德** of the **小人** would be the grass—\nNaturally flowing downward like water,\nOr ascending like fire,\nWith an unstoppable force.\n\nWould there still be among the people\nThose who disregard **廉恥** (*liánchǐ*)—modesty and shame—\nWho become thieves and robbers,\nWho delight in wrongdoing?\nNone would.\n\nThis is the **大智若愚**—great wisdom as if foolishness—,\n**大仁若忍**—great virtue as if forbearance—,\n**大巧若拙**—great skill as if clumsiness—\nYet later generations view them as unfit to rule,\nUnfit to govern.\n\nHowever, the **聖德**’s pervasiveness,\nThe **仁恩**’s transformative power,\nThe **智巧**’s refined influence—\nThough lacking in outward **文**’s adornment,\nTheir **實質**—substance—is indeed profound.\n\n**理** and **欲** originally do not conspire,\nSufficiency in outward **文** breeds dissatisfaction within,\nReducing **文**’s excess enhances **實**’s abundance.\n\nThe **聖** discard **智**,\nThe **仁** discard **義**,\nThe **巧** discard **利**—\nAll to strengthen their **實**,\nAnd to remove **文**’s excess.\n\nThough the common people are **至愚**—utterly foolish—,\nThey always take the ruler’s actions as their guide for **去就**—departure and approach.\n\nThus, if one discards **華** (*huá*)—ornamentation—and upholds **實**,\nIt naturally unifies the **小民**’s hearts in the **本原**—origin—\nAnd leaves them **不雕不琢**—uncarved, unpolished.\n\nFor what they see is governance of **質實無文**—substance without adornment—\nAnd thus what they embrace\nIs the **太朴不凿** (*tàipǔbùzáo*)—unpierced Great Simplicity—of truth.\n\nIn such **浑完** naturalness,\nClothing and food are each in their **常**—proper measure—\nInteractions and exchanges\nFollow their **分**—natural roles.\n\nThough **氣禀** is limited,\nAnd private desires may occasionally sprout,\nThey are few and sparse.\n\nIn summary,\n**聖** and **仁** and **巧** are all **質**—substance—;\n**智** and **義** and **利** are all **文**—adornment.\n\nTo discard **聖** and abandon **智**,\nTo discard **仁** and abandon **義**,\nTo discard **巧** and abandon **利**—\nAll ensure **文** is insufficient,\nAnd **質** remains abundant,\nEach with its proper application.\n\nHow could the people, nourished by **德** and quenched by **和**,\nFail to benefit endlessly,\nTo see **孝** and **慈** flourish daily,\nAnd theft transformed into virtue?\nThis is the **隆盛** governance—\nA sight I have long failed to behold.\n\nThis metaphor illustrates the **修養** path—\nFirst, preserve the **心** and nurture the **性**;\nWhen **心** and **性** return to nature,\nThen the **後天**’s **精氣** also return to the **先天**’s **精氣**.\n\nIf one has not yet seen **性** and clarified **心**,\nAnd merely relies on **後天**’s **氣質**—constitution—\nAnd **知覺**—perception—of the **心** for use,\nThen the **精** belongs to the **凡精**—ordinary essence—,\nAnd the **氣** belongs to the **凡氣**—ordinary *qi*—,\nHow could one obtain the **真一**—true unity—of essence,\nThe **真一** of *qi* to forge the **丹**—elixir?\n\nThe practitioner must seek from the **本源**—original source—\nA **大本領**—great fundamental principle—,\nA **真頭腦**—true essence—\nTo serve as the master.\nThen, **煉精** (*liànjīng*) refining essence,\n**煉氣** (*liàngqì*) refining *qi*,\n**煉神** (*liàngshén*) refining spirit—\nAll become manifest.\n\nUnderstanding this meaning,\nOne not only comprehends the **《太上經》**—*Tàishàng Jīng* (Classic of the Most High)—,\nBut also grasps that governance and self-cultivation,\nIn every aspect, are a single thread—\nAnd that the **四書五經**—Four Books and Five Classics—\nAre none other than **丹經**—elixir scriptures.\n\nOther commentaries state that those in high positions,\nDiscarding **聖** and **智**,\nCause the people to

      "translated_text": "When it comes to the contradictions of clever profit, sagely wisdom, benevolence, and righteousness—\nIf one can discard and abandon them,\nThen where would thieves and robbers arise?\nThis is what must be discarded and abandoned—\nAnd such is its effect.\n\nThis teaching is truly **\"high\"** indeed.\n\nThe three levels below this state:\nGovernance of the people need not rely on decrees—\nOnly that commands must originate from what is rooted in one’s own practice.\nTo see the unadorned is to know constancy;\nTo embrace the uncarved is to preserve the spirit.\nWith few desires and little private gain,\nThis is what is meant by \"having the world yet not partaking of it\"—\nHow could one without excess and without action attain this?\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Distinct from Others**\n\nTo abandon learning is to have no worries.\nHow far apart are **\"yes\"** and **\"ah\"**?\nHow far apart are **good** and **evil**?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\n\nAh, its boundlessness knows no end!\n\nThe masses rejoice, feasting as if at a grand sacrifice,\nAscending as if to the Spring Terrace—\nYet I alone remain tranquil, unmarked,\nLike an infant yet unborn, still within the womb.\nBuoyant and unrestrained,\nAs if having nowhere to return—\nThe masses all have abundance,\nYet I alone seem forsaken.\n\nI alone possess the heart of the simple fool!\nMuddled, while the vulgar are clear—\nI alone am dim, while the vulgar are sharp.\nDull as the sea, unrestrained—\nLike the wind, without end.\n\nThe masses all have purpose,\nYet I alone am clumsy and crude.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I cherish the Mother’s nourishment.\n\nThe Sage’s attainment is supreme—\nCalled **\"Abandoning Learning\"**—\nPure and vital, flowing and unrestrained,\nWithout care, without thought.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The Most High watches over you—\nDo not let your heart be divided.\"*\n\nThus, one acts in one’s natural station,\nUnconcerned with poverty or wealth, gain or loss—\nNowhere does one not find self at ease,\nAnd so it is said: **\"No worries.\"**\n\nThis realm, compared to the unlearned and unskilled,\nIs as distant as heaven from an abyss—\nYet the gap is not so vast.\n\nLike an echo—\nThe same response—\nYet the direct **\"yes\"** and the flattering **\"ah\"** differ—\nThe response remains the same.\nBut the essence of the response—\nHow far apart can it truly be?\n\nFrom ancient times, the division between Sage and commoner\nLies only in good and evil—\nAnd the distinction between good and evil\nResides merely in reverence or insolence,\nA contest of but a single thought—\nHow far apart can they be?\n\nFor the human heart is perilous,\nAnd the **Dao**-heart is subtle—\nA hair’s breadth of difference leads to a thousand-li error.\nWhat people tremble to avoid,\nHow can I fail to fear what they fear?\n\nThus, from the very beginning,\nOne must gather the luminous spirit,\nReturning it to the undifferentiated—\nIn motion or stillness,\nAmidst change or constancy,\nAll as boundless as the primordial chaos,\nBefore Heaven and Earth were cleaved—\nVast and unrestrained,\nAs if the night had no end.\n\nThus, within there is a master,\nAnd external things do not disturb.\nWhen applied to governance and decrees,\nThe people naturally transform in joyous harmony.\n\nTo feed on the Sage’s virtue\nIs to feast as at a grand sacrifice;\nTo dwell in the Sage’s domain\nIs to ascend the Spring Terrace in delight.\nHow could this be compared to solitary cultivation in silent seclusion?\n\nThus, one’s merit fills the world yet knows no merit,\nOne’s actions fill the world yet knows no action.\nThe masses rejoice,\nYet I alone remain serene and undisturbed—\nFaint as an unborn babe,\nStill in the womb, a cluster of primordial *qi*,\nUndifferentiated and whole—\nAscending and descending, flowing without end,\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nYet unaware of its destination.\n\nWhile others act, I do not—\nThe masses have abundance to sustain them,\nYet I stand apart from the world, independent,\nFar beyond what others can attain.\n\nFrom their perspective, few would not call me foolish—\nYet when I reflect,\nI only feel my heart cleansed, hidden in secrecy,\nAt peace with Heaven, content with my fate—\nHow could this be the heart of a fool?\n\nIt is merely that great wisdom appears as folly,\nAnd great skill appears as clumsiness.\n\nOtherwise, how could one bring such joy to labor and contentment to residence,\nSo swiftly transforming hearts and spirits?\n\nThis is because the **Great Polarity** remains a boundless unity—\nMuddled as an unhatched egg,\nNo trace of yin or yang,\nNo knowledge at all.\n\nThe vulgar are clear in all things,\nYet I alone am dim, knowing nothing;\nThe vulgar are sharp in all things,\nYet I alone am confused, understanding nothing.\n\nAm I truly muddled and unaware,\nConfused and insensible?\nRather, it is to conceal one’s traces and dim one’s brilliance,\nNurturing clarity within profundity—\nDay by day, month by month,\nRefining the elixir through nine transformations,\nAttaining the Sage’s virtue,\nAnd becoming an immortal unchanging through the ages.\n\nIts grandeur in transformation\nIs like the obscurity of Heaven and Earth,\nEncompassing all phenomena within thought.\nIts subtlety and spirit\nAre like flowing clouds and water without end,\nNurturing all life within.\n\nFrom the outside, the masses all have purpose in the world,\nYet I alone am foolish and crude.\nWithin, the **Dao** is lofty and beautiful—\nA Sage who transcends the crowd, stands alone,\nAnd is unmatched by the world.\nThis is how I alone differ from others,\nAnd why I am beyond what others can attain.\n\nFor the commoner is scattered in external pursuits,\nLosing their original nature.\nThe Sage nurtures within,\nPreserving their inherent essence.\n\nThe Sage differs from the commoner—\nAll because they return to the **Primordial** from the **Later-Heaven**.\nFor the **Later-Heaven** is **emotion**—child *qi*;\nThe **Primordial** is **nature**—mother *qi*.\nReturning from emotion to nature,\nIt is as if the child clings to the mother,\nReluctant to part.\nThus it is said: **\"Cherish the Mother’s nourishment.\"**",

naturalness—\nnot like the world’s coarse and dull masses,\nwho mistake recklessness for non-action,\nand abandon for naturalness.\nYet, its essence is the Great **Dao** of perfect balance,\nconforming to Heaven’s principle and human nature,\nfollowing the sages’ **virtue** and the sovereign’s **Way**,\npreserving and reflecting inward,\nreturning to the root and restoring the origin—\nthus, aligning above with Heaven’s decree,\nit achieves non-action yet nothing remains undone,\nand naturalness without deviation.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Exhaust the principles, fulfill innate nature,\nand reach the realm of fate.\"*\nIs this not the ideal?\n\nExcess is a disease,\nand insufficiency is also a disease.\nThe *Shujing* states:\n*\"Without bias or faction,\nthe sovereign’s **Way** flows vast and unrestricted.\"*\nThis is exactly so.\n\nEven in human posture,\nthere exists an unchanging norm.\n*Standing on tiptoe* means two feet propped up—\nas the *Shijing* says:\n*\"I stand on tiptoe, gazing at you,\"*\nusing this posture to observe others allows one to survey the horizon,\nbut if one seeks to stand long,\nhow can it be sustained?\n*Striding* means two

traveler’s excessive labor—\nnot only is it unbeneficial,\nbut it also brings harm.\nThose who study must follow the **virtue/power** of Heaven without obstruction,\nconform to the natural principles of things,\nand not merely interject human contrivance—\neven the things themselves should be allowed their natural ease.\nAdjust their diet and rest,\nfor even slight imbalance beyond proper measure—\nwhether overfeeding or excessive asceticism—\nlike a dog’s overindulgence causing injury,\nor an ox’s overwork leading to exhaustion—\nthis only breeds internal unrest and self-detestation.\nHence it is said:\n*\"Others may detest this.\"*\n\nThose who twist and strain,\nseeking to stand or walk,\nto shine or be renowned,\nwhose merits stir the world\nand virtues

waves—\na boundless, luminous spirit,\nand this is **cleanness and purity**.\n\nYet if the world’s ordinary men and vulgar folk,\ndim-witted and oblivious,\nspend their days doing nothing,\nit is not **cleanness and purity**.\nTrue **cleanness** holds light,\ntrue **purity** reveals form—\nlike a clear pool reflecting the moon,\na single radiance of brilliance—\nonly then does one attain the reality of **cleanness and purity**.\nIf even a trace of self-visibility or self-righteousness remains,\nit becomes an obstruction.\nThus, those who study the **Way** must cultivate a heart vast and unrestrained,\nletting no matter or thing disturb their mind,\nor occupy their inner sanctum.\nThrough prolonged nurturing,\na single luminous spark illuminates all—\nas if the sun and moon hung in

in **nurturing qi**,\nfor when **qi** is undisturbed, the spirit naturally illuminates,\nand when the spirit is luminous, the heart finds peace—\nthus he did not say *\"nurture the heart\"* but

medicine**,\nFrom **postnatal** back to **prenatal**.\n\nLet me further elucidate:\nThe **Dao of birth** follows the **natural order**,\nThe **Dao of immortality** inverts and overcomes it—\nFor without overcoming, there is no birth,\nNor without overcoming can one attain attainment.\nThus the **River Diagram** and **Luo Scripture** employ both **generation** and **overcoming**.\n\nThe **Confucian** and **Buddhist** methods of cultivation differ from mine—\nThey generally follow the **natural order**,\nConforming to the **degree of spontaneity**;\n\nMy **Dao** alone inverts and refines,\nRequiring **diligent effort** in its practice.\nIf one fails to overcome,\nThere is no way to birth or attain.\n\nBut to cultivate in accordance with the **natural order** is easy,\nWhile to invert and refine is difficult.\nWithout a **true master**,\nUnclear of the **correct method**,\nAnd recklessly gathering or refining—\nFew escape harm.\n\nOnce the **true master** is obtained,\nAnd

will entangle—\nThere will surely be those who nearly attain but fail,\nWhose **elixir collapses**, **cauldron tips over**,\nAnd whose **life and essence are both lost**—\nThis is truly something to be cautious about.\n\nHow does one **invert and overcome**?\nFirst, one follows the **natural order**,\nImitating the **method of husband and wife**,\nWith **fire entering the domain of water**—\nThis is **spirit entering qi**,\nThe **common folk’s father and mother** uniting to produce **medicine**.\n\nWhen fire steams and water boils,\nGold is born from the depths of water—\nAt this moment, the **mystic orifice opens**,\nAnd **true faith** arrives—\nThis is the **true yang** birthing,\nAnd the **medicine-child** is produced—\nThis is **external medicine**.\n\nOnce the **golden-qi** is born,\n**True lead** is sufficient—\nI, with **fire urging water to ascend**,\n**Wood bearing gold aloft**,\nUrge it gently, guide it carefully,\nLifting it to the **Heavenly Cauldron**,\nTo pair **true lead** with **true mercury**,\nTo use **true fire** and **true intent** to draw it,\nLowering it into the **elixir field**,\nEntering the **Earth’s womb**—\nRefining the **medicine** with the **cauldron and furnace**,\nThis is **returning to Kan as male**,\nAnd **restoring Li as female**.\n\nInverting male and female,\nSelecting them as **host and guest**,\nDrawing them back into the **furnace**,\nRefining them for a **morning’s watch**,\nThen awaiting the **true yang fire’s movement**,\nTo form the **great medicinal fire**—\nThis is the **birth of internal medicine**,\nAlso called **the great medicine’s production**.\n\nThis is the **sage-father and holy-mother** uniting to nurture.\n\nMoreover, the **small medicine’s** birth,\nIts movement lies outside the **kidney passage**,\nIts **qi** is weak—\nThus it is called **small medicine, external medicine**;\n\nThis one’s movement lies within the **qi’s root**,\nWhen born, there are **heavenly response stars**,\n**Earthly response tides**,\nAnd the **six senses tremble**—\nThus it is called **internal medicine, great medicine**,\nAlso called **gold elixir**.\n\nAgain, with this **gold elixir**,\nOne **stirs the River Vehicle**,\n**Stirs the gentle winds**,\nApplies the **Earth’s fire**,\nAnd refines the **true essence of the Li Palace**.\n\nWhen **true qi** merges with **true essence**,\nIt is the **prenatal yang qi** subduing the **postnatal yin essence**,\nAnd the **yin essence** also merges with **true qi**,\nTransforming into the **holy fetus**.\n\nFor **true qi** is born from **true essence**,\nAs **child-qi**—\nWhen **qi** returns to **essence**,\nIt is likened to **child entering the mother’s womb**.\n\nIt is said: *\"The child clings to the mother and comes,\nThe mother clings to the child and remains—\nChild and mother embrace,\nSpirit and qi depend on each other.\"*\n\nIt is the **internal true fire**,\nThe **external application of yin-symbol yang-fire**—\nWhen **internal and external** refining occurs,\nThe **holy fetus** is formed—\nAs in the saying: *\"When lead is nearly exhausted, mercury also dries,\nTransformed into one piece of purple gold frost.\"*\n\nThe **great Dao of gold elixir** differs from the **Dao of birth**—\nOnly in this inversion of **nature’s transformations**,\nAnd overturning of **Heaven and Earth**.\n\nAll those with **merit and virtue**,\nWith **opportunity and Dao**—\nUpon encountering my **explanation**,\nMay all apply the **function**,\nWithout fear of **heterodox calamities**.\n\nYet the **Heavenly

body’s peace and security,\nA hundred years of vigor and strength—\nYet how can they know to **induce transformations**,\nTo **arouse emotions** and **generate life**,\nWhile **lightly expending** their bodies in the world?\n\nThis **qi** is **hollow and floating**, thus **losing qi**;\nThis **spirit** is **agitated and restless**, thus **losing spirit**—\nIf the body’s survival is already scarce,\nHow much more so the **Dao of gold elixir**?\n\nThis **explanation** has already laid out\nThe **principles** of **foundation-building**, **self-refinement**, **forming the elixir**, **returning the elixir**, **jade nectar**, and the **small and great cosmic cycles**—\nDetailed and clarified.\nThose who follow the **Way of life**,\nWho are **scholars and officials**,\nShould cherish and never forget it—\nThus knowing its truth and practicing it to perfection.\n\nThrough this, **achievement and Dao** are attained,\nAnd one becomes forever a **celestial immortal**,\nFree from the **sufferings of the mortal world**—\nIs this not most fortunate?\nAll should strive accordingly!\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seventh: Constantly Do Good to Save Others**\n**Good deeds** leave no **traces** to be followed,\n**Good words** bear no **flaws** to be censured,\n**Good instruction** requires no **plans or strategies**,\n**Good concealment** has no **locks or keys** yet cannot be opened,\n**Good binding** has no **ropes or knots** yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the **sage** constantly does good to save others,\nAnd so **never abandons anyone**;\nConstantly does good to save all things,\nAnd so **never discards anything**.\n\nThis is called **\"inheriting clarity.\"**\n\nTherefore, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good**,\nAnd the **not-good** is the **resource** of the **good**.\nIf one does not **honor their teacher**,\nAnd does not **cherish their resource**,\nEven great wisdom may lead to **great confusion**.\n\nThis is called **\"the essential subtlety.\"**\n\nThe **sage’s heart** seeks only within themselves,\nNot in others.\n\nIn their **application to affairs and things**,\nThey act without **non-action**—\nWhatever arises, they respond accordingly,\nWith no **deficiency within**,\nAnd no **harm done to others without**.\n\nAs the *Yijing* says:\n*\"When the time is to stop, one stops;\nWhen the time is to act, one acts—\nIn **motion and stillness**, one does not lose the **proper timing**,\nTheir **Dao** is **radiant and clear**.\"*\nIs this not such a person?\n\nIn their **conduct**, when the time is right to act,\nThey simply act—\nNo **trace** of their origin before,\nNo **path** of their destination behind—\nHow could **traces** possibly remain?\n\nTheir **conduct’s goodness** is such.\n\nIn their **words**, when the time is right to speak,\nThey simply speak—\nNo **humiliation** seen within themselves,\nNo **shame** left for others—\nHow could **flaws** possibly persist?\n\nTheir **words’ goodness** is such.\n\nAs for **matters requiring calculation**,\nAnd **affairs needing strategy**—\nMeasured by **reason**,\nJudged by **sentiment**,\nFollowing **reason** to apply,\nConforming to **sentiment** to halt—\nWhen much is fitting, much is done;\nWhen little is fitting, little is done—\nWhy bother with **planning and scheming**?\nThis **responsive action without deliberation**,\nWhere **self and others dissolve**—\nIs this not the **good calculation**?\n\nFurther, there are **matters requiring closure and binding**—\nFor others, if not **closed**, there is **chaos**;\nIf not **bound**, there is **dispersion**—\nYet the **sage** cuts off all **external connections**,\nAnd **no internal thoughts** arise—\n**Perfect and complete**, is this not the **good concealment**?\n\nThough there are no **ropes or knots** to constrain,\nNo **locks or keys** to guard—\nYet there is no **gap** for others to exploit,\nAs if **sealed tightly and unassailable**,\nTheir **impenetrability** is such.\nIs this not the **sincere unity of Heavenly principle**,\nWith **no vulnerabilities** to be seized?\n\nThis **number** of ways—\nThey follow **natural Heaven**, untainted by human **artifice**,\nAnd so their effects are such.\n\nEssentially, **internal cultivation** and **external emulation**,\n**Self-correction** without **other demands**—\nThis is how one **establishes themselves and others**,\nWith **no one left behind**;\nThis is how one **perfects themselves and things**,\nWith **no talent wasted**.\n\nTheir **benevolence in saving and benefiting others**—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nThis is all from **self-illuminating virtue**,\nAnd **extending it** to **govern people and things**—\nIs this not **reiterating their clarity**?\n\nYet the **good person** initially does not **know themselves**—\nThe **good person** **forgets** **self and others**,\nThus the **not-good** are **moved** and **revere them as teacher**.\nThe **good person** is also not **self-satisfied**—\nSeeing the **not-good**, the **good person** takes them as **resource**,\nFollowing what is **good** and correcting what is **not**—\nThus the **good person** **advances in goodness**,\nUntil they reach the **domain of supreme transformation and divine change**.\n\nIf **common folk** **rely on their own abilities**,\n**Boast of their own skills**—\nSeeing the **good**, they **ignore** them as if nothing,\nNot knowing to **revere them as models**;\nSeeing the **not-good**, they **discard** them as if they were trash,\nEven **despising** them and deeming them unworthy—\nNot knowing *\"to see the virtuous and strive to equal them,\nTo see the unvirtuous and reflect inward\"*—\nThough **good and evil** differ,\nTheir **teachers and resources** for **self** remain the same.\n\nSuch as this—\nNot **honoring their teacher**,\nNot **cherishing their resource**—\nAre they not the **foolish and self-indulgent**,\nThe **lowly and self-absorbed**?\nAre they not truly the **bewildered**?\n\n**Goodness** is **learned from teachers**,\n**Evil** is **warned against**—\nWhatever arises is **beneficial to oneself**,\nNo person lacks **benefit to the body**.\n\nThis is truly the **essential method of self-cultivation**,\nThe **wonderful Dao of bodily governance**—\nAll should **strive** accordingly!\n\nThis **understanding of the sage’s words** is **universally applicable**.\nThe **principles of affairs and things**,\nAre the **Dao of life and death**—\n**Substance and function** are inherently **unified**,\n**Root and branch** originally **inseparable**.\n\nAs said, **good conduct** leaves no **traces**—\nExtended to the **flow of spiritual qi**,\nThe **River Vehicle** moving **on its own**—\nThis is also so.\n\nIf there are **traces or signs**,\nIt belongs to **forced manipulation and deliberate meditation**—\nNot the **free movement of the River Vehicle**,\nNor the

Teachers from the West.\"*\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"How does Heaven speak?\nThe **four seasons** move in their course,\nThe **ten thousand things** come to life.\"*\n\nIf there are **flaws to be

words**,\nYet people have **spoken it into ruin**.\"*\nThis is its meaning.\n\nIt says *\"good calculation requires no scheming\"*—\nThe **numbers of the cosmic cycle**,\nAre merely **symbolic names** for **three hundred transformations**,\nIn truth, there are no **hexagrams or strategies** to calculate;\nIf there are, they are not **natural fire and timing**.\n\nIt says *\"good concealment has no

unaware, as if ignorant—\nJust as Shun dwelt in the deep mountains,\nNo different from a wild man of the hills.\nThis is the **honor of the perfected human**,\nThe **humiliation of the perfected sage**.\n\nWithout this, one cannot **nourish the void** and **align with the Dao**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Speak, and the spirit-qi scatters;\nThe mind in turmoil, the fire of cultivation grows cold.\nHe who knows the **Law of Return**—\nHis golden treasure weighs like mountains.\"*\n\nIf one speaks recklessly, if one harbors a single thought,\nIt is like fleeing the elixir.\nThe **Dao grows higher, the path grows more perilous**.\nAt this stage of elixir refinement, it is the most dangerous ground—\nHence, ancient sages, after attaining fruition,\nFeigned deafness and madness, acted as fools and lunatics—\nAll for the sake of **nourishing the void** and **aligning with the Dao**.\nWhy else would they endure such suffering?\n\nThus, the mind must hold nothing—\nThis is the **valley of the world**.\nAs the **valley of the world**, it must be colder than ice,\nClearer than water,\nAnd only then will the **eternal mysterious virtue** be fully realized.\n\nYet **true emptiness is not emptiness, subtle being is not being**.\nFirst, from **non-being to being**,\nThen from **being back to non-being**,\nFinally, where **being and non-being stand not at all**.\nThis is the **Dao of returning to the Primordial Simplicity** from the **Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,\nThe **Way of restoring the origin and returning to the root**.\n\nThough it **converges into one**, it **disperses into ten thousand**.\nThus, **endless generation**, **endless transformation**—\nWhere is not the **vessel** present?\nWhere is not the **Primordial Simplicity** dispersed?\nThis is the **saying of the Primordial Simplicity dispersing into vessels**.\n\nThe sage employs this—\nNot valuing the vessel but dispersing the Primordial Simplicity—\nFor **emptiness and stillness** are the **master of the body**,\nThe **total holder of all transformations**,\nLike the sole authority in the world of men.\nIt is also said, *\"The great measure does not cut\"*—\nFor the **Dao in its wholeness** encompasses all without omission,\nFulfills all without excess—\nSufficient for governance.\nIf one were to **cut into it**, it would be artificial contrivance,\nNot the original **nature of Heaven**.\nThe sage does not cut—\nOnly returns to the **Primordial Chaos of Heaven**.\n\nDo the students understand?\nWhen viewed alongside the **chapter on Confucius’ virtue**, one sees\nThe essence of **refining essence, refining qi, refining spirit** is all here.\n\nStill, its subtleties must be further explained:\n*\"In days past, the master’s oral instruction:\nOnly **concentrate the spirit** and enter the **qi-cavity**.\"*\n\nIf one does not **return the light and illuminate the elixir field (Dan Tian)**,\nThe **golden water** will surely become turbid.\nOnce one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the Kūn Palace (the lower elixir field)**,\nYet sometimes **halts and does not persist**,\nThe **water and fire** will scatter—\nWhere then will the **true-one qi of the Primordial Heaven** arise?\n\nThough **concentrating the spirit** is essential,\n**Regulating the breath** must not be neglected.\nIf one knows to **concentrate the spirit in the qi-cavity**\nBut does not know to **adjust the inhalation and exhalation**,\nDescending into the **Yin-latch orifice (Yin Kēi)**,\nThough the spirit may dwell, the breath will not flow freely—\nWithout **fanning the wind and stirring the fire**,\nThe **common breath** will stagnate while the **true breath** emerges,\nThe **common mind** will die while the **true mind** is born.\n\nMoreover, the **true fire** depends entirely on the **true breath**—\nWithout the **true breath** to fan it,\nNot only will the **water and fire** remain unclean,\nBut the **golden embryo** will fail to refine.\n\nOnce the **spirit is concentrated** and the **breath is regulated**,\nOne knows where to **return**—\nAt the moment when the **spirit is harmonized** and the **qi is unobstructed**,\nAs if **Heaven has not yet opened**,\nDark and indistinct—\nOnly then can all **wandering thoughts and turbid qi** be gathered and purified,\nLike the **eclipse of the sun and moon**, revealing a new vitality.\nThus, **thread by thread, weave by weave**,\nAt the moment of **no awareness**,\nSuddenly there is **awareness**—\nThis is the **foundation of the Great Polarization (Tai Ji)**,\nThe **manifestation of the Mysterious Pass (Xuàn Guān)**,\nThe **first stir of the Primordial Yang**.\nAt this moment, if one can **grasp it firmly, hold it steadily**,\nThis is the **technique of seizing mist and catching clouds**.\n\nThe **Dan Jing** says, *\"When the time arrives, the spirit knows,\"*\nAnd again, *\"The true child is alive\"*—\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nAt this moment, one must **seize it immediately**—\nIf even a moment is delayed,\nThe **post-heaven awareness** will arise again,\nAnd it will no longer be fit for the **golden elixir**.\n\nThis **critical juncture** must be grasped\nWhen all **affiliations are abandoned** and **not a single thought arises**—\nOnly then can the **true intention** find it,\nAnd the **true pure medicine** be obtained.\n\nIt must be **stillness upon stillness,沉沉沉沉 (sinking deeper and deeper)**—\nAt the moment of **no awareness, no perception**,\nOne seeks **awareness and perception**—\nOnly then may it be attained.\n\nIf it is said, *\"Not a single thought arises,\"*\nThen why seek with the **intention**?\nIs it not that **intentionally seeking** falls into **post-heaven awareness and spirit**?\n\nYet the **true intention** is like **hidden fire**—\nThough unseen, the fire is present.\nIt is merely **triggered by the mechanism**, and the spirit follows naturally—\nSuch is the **spontaneous response**.\n\nIf one says the **true intention is indeed intentional**,\nIt falls into **rigidity**.\nIf one says the **true intention is truly without intention**,\nIt falls into **empty vacuity**.\n\nBetween **intention and no intention**, the student must **understand it naturally**.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Motionless and still,\nYet responsive and penetrating.\"*\nOnly then is it **true knowing, true awareness**—\nAll done by the **true intention**.\n\nThough the **true intention** arises from the **true heart**,\nThe heart must be **empty, luminous, and responsive**—\nNeither increased by **having** nor decreased by **lacking**.\nWith this **true heart**, there is **true intention**.\nWith this **true intention**, there is **true breath**.\n\nOne must possess **enlightened illumination**,\nNever missing the **opportune moment**—\nThen each refinement will bring its own **growth and benefit**.\n\nAt this stage, if one **constantly seizes the moment**,\nThe **true yang** will naturally arise—\nStill, one must **refine oneself and await the time**,\nNot daring to harbor even a **trace of seeking movement**,\nLest the **post-heaven awareness and spirit** intrude—\nThen the **Primordial Heaven’s utmost yang essence**,\nThe **true-one qi**,\nWill, through **long-term cultivation and accumulation**,\nNaturally produce the **great medicine**—\nCapable of **returning youth and reversing aging.**»",

rectify customs**—\nTo **cultivate inner virtue** is the only foundation for reception.\n\nThe common saying goes:\n*\"One fears not the single act, but the accumulation;\nOne fears not the sudden, but the forced combination.\"*\nTruly, these words are profound.\n\nStudents who wish to grasp the **Dao/Way’s purpose** must not merely listen to the claim that **\"nature alone suffices.\"**\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Ninth: Removing Excess and Extremity**\n*\"If one seeks to take the world and act to do so,\nI see it as a matter of necessity, not choice.*\n*The world is a **divine instrument**—\nIt cannot be **willed** nor **grasped**.\nTo **will** it is to **undermine** it;\nTo **grasp** it is to **lose** it.\nThus, things either **act** or **follow**, **draw in** or **expel**, **strengthen** or **weaken**.\nTherefore, the **Sage** removes the **excessive**, the **luxurious**, the **extreme**—\nThe **Dao/Way** is inherently **soundless and odorless**, pure and serene by nature.\nThose who cultivate the **Dao/Way** must also **not know and not perceive**,\nPurely yielding to **nature**—\nThis is the **mind-seal** of all ancestors, from the **Primordial Beginning** to this day,\nUnalterable and beyond deviation.\n\nYet, how unlike the **heterodox sects and false schools** of the world!\nThey mock our **Dao/Way**, calling it **solitary cultivation of emptiness and refinement**,\nUltimately leading to **barren voidness and uselessness**—\nHow could I not ponder this?\n*\"If one seeks to take the world and enforce **artificial governance**,\nI see it as a matter of necessity, not choice—\nThe more one enforces, the more one is driven to necessity.\"*\nIndeed, though the world be vast,\nIts **divine framework** is what precedes it.\nThe **Primordial Dao/Way** is the **silent natural**—\nThe world is the **divine instrument’s** boundary;\nThe **divine instrument** is the **world’s sovereign**—\nThe world may be **willed**, but the **divine instrument** may not.\n\nIf one **wills** it,\nAt first, there will be **chaos and many affairs**,\nAnd in the end, **moral collapse and transgression**,\nWhile **Heaven’s virtue** is utterly abandoned—\nThis is precisely how **willing** leads to **undermining**.\n\nConsider: **Artificial governance** brings ruin,\nBut **non-action** achieves success—\n**Grasping** disrupts the **constant**,\nYet **non-grasping** attains the **Dao/Way**—\nHow much more so, since the **Dao/Way** originates from **Heaven**,\nAnd **Heaven’s Dao/Way** is **non-action**,\nWhile **spontaneous transformation** arises within it—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nObserve the time of birth:\nThe **Primordial Yang** (*乾元*) initiates creation—\nSometimes **yang** departs and **action** precedes;\nSometimes **yin** arrives and **following** comes after.\n**Motion** and **stillness** mutually root each other,\nWith **inevitability** in their nature.\n\nAs for **qi**—\nWhen it **expands**, it naturally **contracts**;\nWhen it **draws in**, it naturally **expels**—\n**吸** then **呴** arises effortlessly;\n**呼** then **吹** unfolds serenely.\nThus, **vital breath** flows freely,\nAnd **life-force** endures eternally.\n\nYet, **endowments and receptions** differ—\n**Strength** and **softness** are not the same—\nSome receive **abundant qi** and possess **vigorous essence**,\nOthers receive **sparse qi** and have **weakened essence**—\nAll these are **post-heaven disparities**.\n\nSince things are born with their own distinctions,\nSometimes they **ascend**, their **qi-machinery** flourishing upward,\nSometimes they **descend**, their **qi-machinery** naturally collapsing downward—\nAll these are the **natural workings of Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nNot something **human effort** can force.\n\nThough at the **initial stage** there may be traces of **coercion**,\nYet one must follow its **momentum** and **timing**—\n**Act** when it can be done,\n**Cease** when it must be stopped—\n**Coercion** within **yielding to nature**,\nWhich remains **unfailing** over the long term.\n\nThis is also what the **Sage** knows when **harvesting medicine and refining elixir**—\nIn all things, **remove the already excessive**,\n**Remove the too luxurious**,\n**Remove the too extreme**—\nAlways returning to **moderation**,\nAlways maintaining **harmony**.\n\nThough it may be said **\"artificial governance\" exists**,\nIt is also the same as **\"non-action\"**;\nThough it may be said **\"action occurs\"**, it is also the same as **\"non-action\"**.\n\nThus, **having and not-having mutually generate**,\nOnly then can one speak of the **Great Dao/Way**.\n\nThis is the **Great Dao/Way of non-action**—\n**Non-action** refers to the **study of nurturing the Primordial** (*先天养性*);\nYet it is also **action**—\n**Action** refers to the **craft of refining the post-heaven** (*后天炼命*).\n\nOne must know that **action and non-action**,\nThough their **cultivation methods** differ,\nThe **sovereign principle** within them must never be **disturbed**—\nIf **disturbed**, it is **not moderation**.\nWhether **action** or **non-action**,\nBoth are **not** the **Dao/Way**.\n\nOnly when the **sovereign principle** remains **unshaken and undisturbed**,\nKnowing **timing and discerning momentum**,\nAdvancing when **opportunity** presents,\nRetreating when **difficulty** arises—\nThen **non-action** is achieved,\nAnd **action** is also attained.\n\nWhat is the **sovereign principle**?\nIt is the **divine instrument of the world**.\n\nIf humans can **grasp its origin**,\nAnd **return** to the **undifferentiated and unfathomable**,\n**Empty and luminous** without **obscurity**—\nAt first, **action** is **action**,\nAnd at the end, **non-action** is **non-action**.\n\nOtherwise, if one **universally claims** that **\"non-action is natural\"**, then why did **Confucius** bother to speak of **Dao/Way**?\nWhy did he speak of **necessity’s diligent practice**?\nWhy did he speak of **choosing virtue and firmly holding it**?\n\nKnowing the **method of self-cultivation**,\nIts **foundation** lies in **nurturing life and essence**—\nThe **cultivation of life and essence** requires **rest and effort**,\nNot **forcibly distinguishing** between them—\nAll depends on **human discernment** of its **virtue/power**.\n\nAs in **governing the state**:\n**Peace** is maintained through **ritual and music**,\n**Chaos** is suppressed through **arms and warfare**—\n**Responding to seasons** and **acting in accordance with Heaven**,\nThen **success** will surely come—\n**Left and right** will **flow like a source**,\nAnd in all things, **fitness** will be found.\n\nThis is the **Dao/Way** that can be spoken to the **wise**,\nBut is **difficult** for the **rigid and dull-witted** to grasp.\n\n**Chapter Thirtieth: The Fruit of Virtue**\n*\"Aiding a ruler with the **Dao/Way**,\nOne does not **coerce the world with arms**—\nSuch **endeavors** tend to **return in kind**:\nWhere the **teacher** abides, **briers and thorns** grow—\nAfter great **military campaigns**, **harsh years** must

glory!\nIf victory comes, do not boast—\nBoasting breeds a love of war;\nDo not self-praise—\nSelf-praise harbors martial arrogance.\nEven if he subdues tyrants with ease,\nElevates the people to

leads to chaos,\nPlunging the people into fire and water,\nYet if the heart harbors threefold deceit,\nThough no killing occurs, the seed of slaughter lies within—\nThis is not the **Dao/Way**.\n\nKnow this: war is a last resort for the sage,\nEven if no soldiers are lost, no generals fallen,\nNo civilians harmed, no creatures slain,\nIt is still not the path of lasting peace.\nHow much less so for those unworthy of the sage’s approval?\nThus, if war must be waged, let it be without excess.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Exhort the ruler not to seek the path of feudal lords,\nFor every general’s triumph rests on ten thousand bones.\"*\n\nReflect on this: war is perilous, battle is a dire omen,\nNot the **Dao/Way** of nurturing life.\n\nWhat of prolonged hostilities, where guest and host clash,\nDragging on endlessly, exhausting troops and treasury,\nAlienating subjects and inciting grievance?\nIf it can be stopped but is not, how can it benefit the state?\n\nOr when armies face entrenched defenses,\nYears pass in supply lines,\nA single moment of negligence—\nThe enemy seizes the pass,\nCuts off provisions—\nSoldiers flee at the first rumor,\nTroops scatter at the first sign,\nOnce mighty forces now reduced to ashes—\nWhat wonder is there in this?\nFor *\"when things reach their peak, they grow old,\"*\nSuch is the inevitable course.\n\nWar is used to punish the **Dao/Way**-less with **Dao/Way**.\nYet if one delights in war and strife,\nClaiming to pacify the people only to harm them,\nTo suppress rebellion only to breed it—\nThis is the ultimate **non-Dao/Way**.\n\nTo punish the **Dao/Way**-less while acting without **Dao/Way**—\nHow is this better than cultivating fields to repel bandits,\nResting arms and fostering goodwill among neighbors?\nEarly prevention is far superior.\n\nAs when **Shun** subdued the **Three Miao**—\nThe Miao people resisted stubbornly,\nYet Shun did not rely on arms but on **virtue/power**,\nDancing the *Ganyu* at the hall’s steps,\nAnd in seventy days, the Miao submitted in harmony.\nThis was **威** without coercion, **武** without force—\nFar surpassing mere coercion and arms.\nDo those in high station know this?\n\nThis speaks of the **Dao/Way** of **fire-refinement**,\nOf **symbolic talismans**, **gathering**, and **alchemical transformation**—\nAll deliberate action.\nCompared to waging war and defeating the enemy,\nThis is a far graver matter, not to be taken lightly.\n\nAs when **Zengzi** tempered himself in battle,\nOr **Zisi** warned of strict discipline in war—\nOnly thus can one transform **qi** and **spirit**,\nRestoring the original, pristine state.\nLike the unbroken purity of youth,\nUnbroken, unharmed,\nOne may act in accordance with the times,\nFollow the **Dao/Way** without partiality,\nFree from peril or danger,\nAscending to the realm of **spiritual transformation**.\n\nBut for those already broken or aged,\nWhen **post-heaven** lead and mercury are exhausted,\nWhere does life depend?\nThen must one resort to **enchanting the tortoise** or **summoning the phoenix**—\nStriking the bamboo flute, plucking the

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: *\"Those who aid the sovereign with the Dao/Way do not rely on arms to subdue the world.\"* Even if one attains perfect refinement, yet after the fire-alchemical tempering, when all coarse *qi* has been purged and true *qi* has yet to accumulate, the result will be indeterminate—neither fully present nor fully absent, subtle and difficult to discern. Moreover, there are those who, without cultivation, scatter their *qi*, and the more they refine, the more their *qi* disperses—all due to the mind’s restless fluctuations, like creeping vines that resist eradication. Hence it is said: *\"Where the master treads, brambles spring up.\"* How much more so when the divine fire is applied, for yin *qi* resists retention, and long-standing ailments or childhood infirmities are driven forth—some exiting through sweat, turbid urine, or waste, while others manifest as external sores or toxins, varying in form. The cultivator must not mistake these for illness; only a tranquil mind can transmute *qi*.\n\nThus, the Dao of self-cultivation must transform the common body into a jade-like one, the turbid form into a golden one. Never be alarmed—for alarm stirs the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire and gravely injures the primordial *qi*. Hence it is said: *\"After a great campaign, there will surely be years of calamity.\"* Those skilled in warfare value decisiveness; those skilled in fire-alchemy value swiftness and subtlety. Hence it is said: *\"Decisive and complete.\"* When the cultivator reaches the stage of pure *yang* transformation, they must not rely on their attainment, supposing themselves unfettered by hunger or thirst, able to move like the wind, requiring no stove in winter or fan in summer, displaying marvelous feats beyond ordinary men, and thus deeming themselves strong. To boast of such strength is to again agitate the posterior-heaven’s vulgar fire; if not met with external censure, the internal elixir will surely falter. Worse still, if one harbors a self-aggrandizing spirit—even if they complete ten months of gestation and three years of nurturing, fulfilling every task with precision, yet still pride themselves and boast, arrogantly overbearing others—they are far from the vessel of the Dao. Even if successful in their endeavors, they will surely meet ruin in their debts. The peril of collapse is beyond reckoning!\n\nWhat then of those who, relying on their strength, fail to cultivate humility and sincerity? Though they may practice virtue and concentrate on the Dao, they remain like rigid trees—strong yet lifeless—while the supple and fragile retain vitality. Day by day, year by year, as time passes, their vital essence wanes. How could they long enjoy the joys of mortal life? Hence it is said: *\"When things are at their peak, decay begins.\"* By this reasoning, those who exalt themselves only bring themselves low; those who boast invite peril. How un-Dao!\n\nBetter to discard the rigid heart, maintaining simplicity and steadiness, adhering to principle while letting go of contrivance, yielding to Heaven’s arrangement—thus achieving strength without force, the Dao without effort. Here lies the peril of the initial fire-alchemical stages; let the scholar beware.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-One: Tranquility and Simplicity as Supreme**\n\nWarfare is an inauspicious instrument; men detest it, and thus those who follow the Dao avoid it. The noble man, at home, values the left; in war, the right. Warfare is an inauspicious instrument, not the tool of the noble. Used only when unavoidable, tranquility and simplicity are paramount. To triumph yet take no pleasure in it—those who do are but lovers of killing. He who delights in killing cannot prevail under Heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious matters are honored on the left; inauspicious on the right. Hence the left general is stationed left, the right general right, and funeral rites are observed. Many lives lost are mourned with tears; victory is treated with funeral solemnity. The sage governs Heaven and Earth with virtue and morality as supreme, law and teaching secondary. Only when forced to raise armies, wield arms, and send eldest sons to war—where younger sons bear the dead—does the *Yijing* warn: *\"This is ominous, this is perilous.\"*\n\nHow much worse for those who revel in the tiger’s gaze, the eagle’s fierceness, who display arms on the battlefield and wield might in the barracks, who see conquest as gain and warfare as skill! Such warfare is not merely chaotic—it is the finest of arms. For the finest arms are inauspicious instruments. The ancients called halting the blade *wu* (martial virtue); these men call exhausting warfare skill—hardly the tool of the sage.\n\nThe noble’s true instruments are the Dao, virtue, and the love of life while abhorring death. To speak of arms is to speak of slaughter. When the sounds of killing resound and the land trembles, even chickens and dogs are unsettled—what then of the horror inflicted? Even earthworms cling to life, ants fear death; the most insignificant creatures recoil. How much more so for men? Thus, those who follow the Dao avoid such places.\n\nAll things value *yang* over *yin*—the left is *yang*, the breath of life; the right is *yin*, the seed of slaughter. Hence the noble, in ordinary times, honors the left. Only in war does he abandon the left for the right, revealing how little he esteems arms.\n\nEven if one eliminates tyrants, punishes the wicked, and raises righteous banners in orderly ranks, warfare remains an inauspicious instrument, one the sage avoids. In times of peace, a state needs no martial preparations. When borders cry out in alarm and rebellions flare, and only then must arms be raised, the discipline must be strict, rewards and punishments unyielding. Where the army passes, the people offer wine and grain; where the soldiers march, the fields remain undisturbed. Thus does one conquer the rigid with flexibility, the fierce with virtue—evident in such conduct.\n\nLet there be no display of martial might, no boasting of strategy. Only tranquility and non-action, ease and naturalness, suffice.",

      "translated_text": "「From the very moment the **Yin-Yang** energies intermingle,\na single point settles within the **Yellow Court** (黃庭).\nThen one must cease its movement and remain steadfast,\nsettle its dwelling and remain unshaken—\nthus the **Great Dao** endures perpetually.\n\nHaving known where to halt,\nthere is an inherent master that does not change,\nso why would it suffer the humiliation of birth and death?\n\nThus, it is seen that the Dao disperses outward,\nvast and boundless, unfathomable and indistinct.\nWhen gathered inward,\nit becomes indistinct and chaotic,\nretiring and concealing itself in profound mystery.\n\nIf scholars do not grasp the **root principle** (統宗),\nthey lack a foundation to return to,\nand thus scatter without measure.\nEven establishing oneself proves impossible,\nhow then could one reach others?\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the ocean.\"*\n\nOnly by attaining the **root principle** does one achieve greatness.\n\nZi Si (子思) spoke of the **Way** of the **Junzi** (君子) as costly yet hidden—\nthis is the **one source** giving rise to myriad transformations,\nwhere myriad transformations return to the **one source** of the **Way**.\n\nIn this chapter, the **sweet dew** (甘露) is the **True Lead** (**Kan**) and **True Mercury** (**Li**) merging before descending.\n**\"Knowing the halt\"** (知止) is the **divine qi** gathering in the **Yellow Court** (中宫).\n\nThe **Taoist Canon** (太上) speaks of **perfect unity** (俱浑),\nbut I shall elaborate further:\nThose who wish to cultivate **life and death** (性命),\nmust first clarify **True Lead** and **True Mercury**.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"Mercury is the inherent substance of my family,\nLead is the elixir of immortality from another.\"*\n\nIf one speaks only of **heart-nature** (心性),\nthere is no way to grasp it,\nso the ancient **true immortals** (真仙) and **true ones** (真人) borrowed the name **Mercury**.\n\nThis **Mercury** is not the other—\nit is the **heart’s essence**, the **soul’s elixir**—\nborne from **nasal mucus, saliva, seminal fluid, vital essences, blood, and fluids**,\nfrom the **postnatal turbid residues** (後天阴滓物),\nilluminated by **divine fire** (神火) descending for a long time,\nrefined into the most **sublime essence**.\n\nThis **sublime essence** is the **host of original nature** (元性所寄).\nFor **original nature** is inherently pure and clear,\nuntainted by the slightest dust,\nequal to the **Great Void**.\n\nIt is not the **postnatal essence** (後天之精) of the physical body,\nnor the **vital breath** (氣) produced by **civilized and martial fires** (文武火),\nnor the **divine light** (神光) that illuminates it—\notherwise, the **sublime essence** would not refine,\nand the **sublime nature** would lack its foundation.\n\nThus, those who forge the **elixir** (丹),\nmust first **refine essence into breath** (炼精化气),\nas said:\n*\"This essence is not the common man’s essence,\nbut the **Jade Emperor’s** (玉皇) saliva from within his mouth.\"*\n\nThe **Jade Emperor** is likened to the **heart**,\nand this **sublime essence** is the **saliva**.\n\nOnce **essence is refined into Mercury** (精生汞化),\nthe **sublime essence** descends into the **Kan palace** (坎宫),\nand the **True Yang** (真陽) ascends as well,\nuniting within the **Yellow Court’s** (黃庭) **inner cauldron** (內釜).\nI condense my **divine qi** (神气) here,\nand over time, **True Lead** emerges, flourishing and manifesting—\nthis is what is called **\"obtaining the medicine\"** (得藥).\n\nYet the **sublime essence** is **True Water** (真水),\nand the **True Yang** is **True Qi** (真氣),\n**True Qi** being **True Lead** (鉛).\n\n**Mercury** is **essence**,\n**Lead** is **common**—\nboth are **postnatal substances** (後天) with form and appearance,\ncapable only of **nurturing vitality** (順而生男育女),\nnot of **eternal life’s** great medicine.\n\nOnly when **Mercury** descends and **Lead** ascends,\nuniting in the **Yellow Court**,\ncondensing **divine qi** and regulating **breath**,\ndoes one feel, in an instant,\na **boiling, surging** sensation—\nlike mist and smoke,\nlike tides and waves—\nthen does it become **True Lead**,\nworthy as the foundation for **elixir forging** (炼丹之本),\nas said:\n*\"Kan and Li unite to obtain the medicine.\"*\n\nThen, **Yang fire** (陽火) and **Yin elixir** (陰符) are stirred,\nascending from the **tail vein** (尾闾) to the **muddy pellet** (泥丸).\nThe **muddy pellet**, long storing **Yin essence** (陰精),\ncombines with this **True Lead qi** (真鉛之氣),\nforming a single entity—\nthis is what is called:\n*\"**Qian and Kun** unite to forge the **elixir** (結丹).\"*\n\nWhen **Yang qi** ascends to the **muddy pellet**,\nwhat manifestation does it show?\nA **refreshing clarity** in the head and eyes,\nunlike the usual **dullness and dizziness**,\nas if the wind disperses clouds and the sky clears—\na distinct transformation,\nthis is **True Mercury**.\n\nThe **Mercury** of before was still **common Mercury**,\nunfit to nourish the **embryo of immortality** (仙胎).\n\nWhen **Lead** and **Mercury** meet in the **muddy pellet**,\nthe **postnatal essence** and **postnatal qi** (凡精凡氣)\nmerge and transform,\nno longer seen as **Lead** or **Mercury**,\nbut as a **pure, cool, and tranquil** taste—\nrefined into **sweet dew divine water** (甘露神水),\nfragrant and sweet to the palate,\nunlike the usual **coarse essence and turbid qi**,\nthis is what the ancients called:\n*\"**Amrita** (醍醐) anointing the **crown\"** (灌顶).*\n\nSwallowed from the **upper palate** (上腭),\nit enters the **Yellow Court** to be **nurtured in warmth** (溫養),\nand is then **sealed and secured** (封固).\n\nThis **True Essence**,

unshaken—\nnaturally attaining **stillness** (安所止) and **halt** (得所止),\nwhat peril could there be?\n\nThis realm requires **Great Stillness and Great Clarity** (大静大定).\nIf one **harvests** (采取) with

one step’s effects.\nIf there is no **true foundation** (真实处),\nthe practice remains incomplete.\n\nWhen **heavenly mechanisms** (天机) are fully revealed,\none may **attain verification** (取证) by oneself.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: Knowing Others is Wisdom**\nWisdom in knowing others is wisdom,\nself-awareness is clarity.\n\nOvercoming others requires strength,\nself-mastery is

**essence melts** (精融) and the **qi transforms** (气化).\n\nHow do I know this is **refining essence into qi** (炼精化气)?\nBefore, I did not draw in **external qi** (外来之气),\nbut relied solely on my **inner heart-spirit** (吾心内之神),\nthe two harmonizing as one, blending into a unified whole.\nThen, the **yin-ascending qi** (坎离) and the **kidney essence** (阴精)\nwere each scattered, utterly independent,\nand even my breathing was not in accord.\n\nWhen I begin to **retrieve external qi** (收回外气)\nto regulate my **internal kidney essence** (制内里阴精),\nupon its arrival, the **yin-ascending qi** (阴精) naturally transforms.\nThe **qi of the heart and kidneys** (上下心肾之气)\nthen merges into one, naturally settling the **palace-of-the-cinnabar-field** (绛宫) in tranquility,\nand the **kidney storehouse** (肾府) in ease.\n\nThe **external breath** (外之呼吸)\nand the **internal true breath** (内之真息)\nmerge as one **qi** (合为一气),\nlike a husband and wife in perfect union—\ngathered yet never dispersing.\nDay fills, month overflows,\nand the **true yang** (真阳) begins to manifest its forms.\n\nThis is the clear sign of **transforming qi** (化气).\n\nOnce **qi is transformed** (既已化气),\nI proceed to **ascend upward** (向上之事).\nWhat is **ascending upward** (向上之事)?\nAt this time, when **breathing unites** (呼吸合)\nand **spirit and qi exchange** (神气交),\nit condenses in the **alchemical field** (丹田),\nswirling and rising, like a living dragon swimming—\nendless transformations occur in a single day.\n\nI merely **concentrate the spirit within** (凝神于中),\n**direct the breath outward** (注息于外),\nand **listen to its natural course** (听其天然).\nNaturally, it reaches **ultimate stillness** (静极)\nand then **spontaneous motion** (动),\nthen **ultimate motion** (动极)\nand then **spontaneous stillness** (静)—\nthis is **refining qi into spirit** (炼气化神).\n\nWhen **stillness is firmly established** (静定久久),\nmy **qi becomes more regulated** (我气益调),\nand the **swirling essence** (宛转流行于丹田者)\nnow refined to perfection, feels **both present and absent** (似有似无),\n**both moving and still** (若动若静).\nThe **essence is imperceptible** (精看不觉),\nbut the **subtle convergence is known** (细会始知).\n\nAt this juncture, I must **extinguish all awareness** (务将知觉之心),\n**dissolve all thoughts** (百想无存),\n**dispel all illusions** (万虚全消).\nThe **spirit and qi of the alchemical field** (丹田交会之神气)\nare then left to **self-stir and self-regulate** (自鼓自调),\n**self-warm and self-fortify** (自温自煅).\nI merely **maintain emptiness and stillness** (致虚守寂),\n**entirely yielding to nature** (纯任自然).\nThe **spirit enters the qi** (神入气中) yet is unaware,\nthe **qi surrounds the spirit** (气周神外) yet is unnoticed.\n\nAfter such a **refinement** (烹炼),\na **fragrant breeze** (香风) naturally arises,\nrising to **penetrate the hundred meridians**

**single mind** (一心),\nonly a **single breath** (一息) arises from the **alchemical field** (规中),\npure and subtle, refined like jade.\n\nThis is called **qi giving birth to spirit** (气生神).\n\nThus, **spirit and qi nourish and generate each other** (神气交养, 两两相生).\nAt this stage, it is most fitting to **release all grasping and return to emptiness** (撒手成空),\n**neither clinging nor detaching** (不粘不脱),\n**as if the spirit exists yet the mind does not** (若有心, 若无意).\nThis is the **practical essence of refining spirit back to emptiness** (炼神还虚之实际).\n\nThese **three practices** (此三件功夫),\nthough requiring time, can be **attained simultaneously** (一时可行可到).\nThe **student must follow the Dao** (遵道而行),\nnot merely reaching **coarse convergence of spirit and qi** (神气粗交)\nbefore abandoning the seat—\nnor **leaving upon achieving great union** (神气大交),\nwhen the two are indistinct, **before attaining the realm of effortless, pure, and free stillness** (虚无清净自在之境).\n\nOne must **persist in this cultivation** (照此行持),\nbeginning with **refining essence** (炼精),\nuntil over time the **qi grows strong** (气长) and the **spirit flourishes** (神旺),\ntransforming into **pure, natural ease** (清净自然).\nThen, applying the **refining furnace techniques** (归炉工法),\none aligns with the **Heavenly cycle of filling and emptying** (天地盈虚消息),\nand the **four seasons’ qi manifestations** (一年春夏秋冬气象).\nOnly then is the **great cycle fully complete** (始完全一周).\n\nBy **diligently cultivating thus** (工夫照此修持),\nmy **qi becomes ever more refined** (我气益调),\nmy **spirit ever more still** (我神益静).\nWithin, there are **endless transformations** (无穷变化)\nand **inexhaustible vitality** (不尽生机).\nThrough **unceasing, day-and-night practice** (日夜行工),\n**continuous and meticulous**

(自然而通).\n\nI merely **follow its course** (顺其所通)\nand **slightly guide it** (略微引起足矣).\nUnlike **errant external methods** (旁门左道),\nwhich **forcefully manipulate** (以自家私意空空去运)\nor **rigidly control** (死死去行),\nI do not **artificially stir or halt** (为之起止)\nbut **observe its own spontaneous motion and stillness** (观他自动自静).\n\nOver time, the **cinnabar is perfected** (丹成) and the **Dao is

      "translated_text": "「Though the Dao has no fixed place or form, it is difficult to conceive and even harder to grasp. Hence it is said: *\"It cannot be seen, yet cannot be exhausted; it cannot be heard, yet cannot be drained.\"* Such is its nature—**encompassing heaven and earth without excess**, **conforming to all things without omission**. This is why the Dao is called great.\n\n**A scholar must know where to aspire!**\n\nThis speaks of how a person must first **align with the harmonious exchange of heaven and earth** (天地交泰) before they can **fuse and disperse** (融融泄泄) in such a way—**not merely like refined music that lingers in the heart or fragrant baits that tempt the senses**, but rather to evoke **sighs of admiration without end**.\n\nYet such a realm is not easily attained. If one is in the throes of **private desires raging** (私欲甚炽) and **vital qi fading** (血氣將衰), and does not first **proceed from the realm of intense motion** (极动之处) to **gradually reach the state of stillness** (静地), then **the mundane heart will not perish** (人心不死), **the Dao-heart will not arise** (道心不生), **the ordinary breath will not cease** (凡息不停), and **the true breath will not manifest** (真息不見).\n\nOnly when **stillness follows extreme motion** (动极而静之际), must one **avoid letting true intention** (真意) dominate. This intention is **yin in nature**, belonging to **the category of *ji* earth** (己土).\n\nSoon, one will feel **dimly vague and indistinct** (恍恍惚惚), as **yin and yang intermingle** (阴阳交媾). Then, one enters **the boundless realm of profound obscurity** (杳冥之境)—**like a dream yet not a dream**, **like waking yet not fully awake**.\n\nWithin this settled stillness, **suddenly a thread of warm qi arises** (一缕热气), **mingling and flowing continuously** (混混续续). As **the qi flows freely and the spirit harmonizes** (气畅神融), the two **converge within the Yellow Palace** (黄房之间)—**on the verge of distinction yet indistinct**, **indistinct yet suddenly distinct**. This is the **manifestation of true *yan* lead** (真铅现象).\n\nThen, **the heart’s blossoms surge forth** (心花怒发), **warm qi fuses** (暖气融融), **the primordial spirit leaps** (元神跃跃)—**not through external provocation**, but **naturally arising**. Thus, **the signs of the Mysterious Pass** (玄关兆象) and **the foundation of the Great Ultimate** (太极开基) are realized.\n\nAt this moment, one must **employ a single point of true heart** (一点真心), **issuing true intention** (发真意) to **contain and gather** (收摄之). This intention is **yang in nature**, belonging to **the category of *wu* earth** (戊土).\n\nIn essence, it is **one intention**, merely **dividing the foundation of motion and stillness** (动静之基) into **the earths of *wu* and *ji*** (戊己之土).\n\nFor when **the Mysterious Gate** (玄牝) remains unopened and **chaos prevails** (混沌之中), **true intention** (真意) as the master is **the intention of boundless wonder** (无欲观妙)—**called *yin* earth**. But when **the Mysterious Gate opens and true essence manifests** (玄牝开而真机现), **one observes desire through its aperture** (有欲以观其窍)—**called *yang* earth**.\n\n**One is the nameless origin of heaven and earth;**\n**the other is the named mother of all things.**\n**Generating heaven, earth, humans, and beings,**\n**all arise from this single point of true intention** (真意), **flowing through them like a thread**.\n\n**A cultivator who can master and govern this true intention** (真意主宰运行) will **not be swayed by sensation into thought**, nor **driven by motion into distraction**. As it is said:\n*\"The Celestial Pass is under my control;*\n*the Earthly Axis is in my heart.*\n**The cosmos resides within the body;**\n**all transformations spring from the mind**—\n**all these are the operations of this moment’s luminous awareness** (灵觉), **to be mastered and sustained**.\"\n\nHence it is said:\n*\"If one lingers too early in the breath,*\n**the true essence does not yet appear** (真机未现), **and gathering it is futile** (采之无益);\n*if one lingers too late,*\n**mundane thoughts have already arisen** (凡念已起), **and gathering it will be mixed with impurities** (夹杂), **unfit as medicine for refining one’s essence** (不堪为我炼功大药).\n**This requires great wisdom and great strength**—\nonly then can one **recognize it clearly and hold it firmly** (认得清、把得定) in this single breath, **as the foundation for attaining immortality and sainthood** (成仙证圣之本).\n\nThough this **Mysterious Pass** (玄关) begins with **soft and delicate qi** (柔脆之气), **one feels only a faint warmth rising from the lower *dan*** (下元), yet over time it **surges through the body** (踊跃周身), **as if unstoppable**. A student must **discern it clearly at its subtlest stage**, **sustaining it with true intention** (以我真意主持) **without the slightest dispersion**. With time, the **qi-essence grows mighty** (气机大有力量), **allowing it to rise naturally, unchecked and unrestrained** (兀兀腾腾). One must **follow its course without added intention or interference** (不加一意，不参一见)—**then it is obtained**.\n\nWhen the **qi-essence is robust and flourishing** (气机壮旺), **a single moment of stillness triggers the Celestial Essence’s motion** (天机发动), **rapid as lightning**. Even in **the midst of all clamor**, it cannot be restrained.\n\n**One must have a heart of luminous awareness** (灵觉之心) to **master it**—**then there will be no flaw**.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The State’s Sharpest Tools**\n*\"When one is about to close them, they must first be fully extended;*\n*when one is about to weaken them, they must first be fully fortified;*\n*when one is about to discard them, they must first be fully employed;*\n*when one is about to seize them, they must first be fully granted.\"*\nThis is called **the subtle art of *wei* clarity** (微明).\n\n**Softness overcomes hardness;**\n**weakness overcomes strength.**\n**A fish cannot survive outside the depths.**\n**The state’s sharpest tools must not be displayed to the people.**\n**Heaven has its ebb and flow, wax and wane;**\n**humans have their lifespans, fortunes, and paths of fulfillment.**\nThis too is the **ordinary course of qi and fate** (气数之常).\n\nYet this **applies only to the common masses** (凡夫), **not to the sages** (圣人). For **the sages possess the power to reverse heaven and earth** (挽回天地之能) and **the virtue to invert the *qian* and *kun*** (扭转乾坤之德)—**nothing more than inverting yin and yang** (颠倒阴阳) and **counteracting the workings of *dao* creation** (逆施造化).\n\nFor instance, **when autumn arrives**, **all things withdraw**, yet **one struggles to close and weaken** (欲歙弱而难整). The sages **then extend the vital breath of heaven and earth** (张天地之气运) and **strengthen the functional capacity of the vital qi** (强血气之功能).\n\n**When winter comes**, **all things decay**, yet **one seeks to wither and seize** (欲槁夺而难生). The sages **then revive the cosmic essence** (气象之重兴) and **grant the years and months as their own** (岁月之我与者).\n\nThis is **both the subtlest and the clearest** (至微而至明), **both the most ordinary and the most extraordinary** (实常而实异)—**a truth only the sages can fathom**.\n\n**To transform danger into safety,**\n**to reverse chaos into order,**\n**requires not mere mortal courage but divine transformation** (神化).\n\nYet **the essence of their return-and-restoration technique** (返还之术) is simply **softness** (柔) and **weakness** (弱).\n**Only because they are soft do they overcome hardness;**\n**only because they are weak do they overcome strength.**\n\nWhat is their method?\n*\"If humans lack precision, they perish;*\n**if fish lack water, they die.**\n**Once a fish is removed from the depths,**\n**the waters dry and life’s essence fades** (水涸而生机息矣).\n\n**Humans and fish share the same dependency on water.**\nBut it is not **the water of heaven’s dew** (天露之水),\nnor is it **the water of the Dao’s profound depths** (造道渊深),\n**the primordial water of unity** (一元之水).\n\n**It flows ceaselessly** (汩汩乎来), **frequently nourishing** (频相灌溉).\n**Zhuangzi once said:**\n*\"They moisten each other with dew;*\n**they breathe on each other with vapor—*\n**yet better still is to forget each other in the rivers and lakes.\"*\nThis is his meaning.\n\n**Later generations of heterodox schools** (旁门) **mistake tangible, material essence** (有形有质之精) for **the foundation of cultivation and longevity** (修炼长生之本), **utterly failing to grasp the Dao as a substance**—**vigorous, upright, and pure**, **its essence arising from profound obscurity, boundless void, and spontaneous naturalness** (恍惚杳冥、虚无自然而生者).»",

      "translated_text": "The secrets of alchemical fire and the essence of culinary mastery are not imparted to the unworthy—only to the **sage-teacher** (聖師) does one reveal them, only to the **utterly sincere** (至誠) does one approach them, and only to those who have **deeds and virtue**, who **seek the Way with humility** (虚心访道), and who **sincerely pursue a master** (竭誠求師) can the **chance of Daoist attainment** (仙緣) be forged.\n\nFor the **heavenly mechanisms** (天機) are profound and hidden, the **weight of heaven and earth** (天地至重) is supreme, and the **ghosts and spirits** (鬼神) hold them in reverence. To recklessly transmit these to the unworthy invites **calamity upon the Nine Ancestors** (殃遺九祖). It is like the **state’s most vital implements** (國家利用之密器)—they cannot be casually revealed to others.\n\nThus, the **noble person** (君子) keeps them **meticulously concealed** (缜密而不出), and the **seeker** (學者)—does he grasp this truth?\n\nThis speaks of those who cultivate the Dao: they truly hold **the cosmos in their grasp** (宇宙在手), and **all transformations arise from their mind** (萬化生心). Yet still, they need only **observe the Dao of Heaven** (天之道) and **grasp its operation** (执天之行), following it to take and opposing it to act—this suffices.\n\nIt is not a matter of **harboring vital force within lethal force** (寓生機於殺機之中), but rather what is called **the supreme yin, resplendent** (至陰赫赫), and **the supreme yang, austere** (至陽肃肃). The resplendent arises from Heaven, the austere from Earth. To take the supreme yang from the supreme yin—this is the **seizing of opportunity** (資機).\n\nIf a person can **plunder yang from the black mountain’s cavern** (黑山窟), or **extract treasure from the demon’s lair** (鬼窩里), then they are **stealing vital force from lethal force**. Yet all this is done within the **void of heaven and earth**, or **plucked from the stillness of the human body**—this is the **true essence** (真精), not the **common essence of the world** (世之凡精).\n\nIf one can **plunder it without losing the moment**, and **apply it with a single effort**, then there will be **progress in proportion to the work**. I urge the seeker to **yield with softness** (以柔), to **weaken with humility** (以弱), to **establish virtue and deeds** (立德立功), so as to **earn the favor of the divine and heavenly** (神天之佑), and thus receive the **transmitted incantations of the immortals** (仙人傳授口訣).\n\nOtherwise, even the greatest matters—those that **stir heaven and earth and move ghosts and spirits**—though even the immortals **rarely transmit them**. For the **heavenly mechanisms are most secret** (天機至密), the **heavenly laws are most strict** (天律最嚴), and they **cannot be defied**.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"If the Dao could be offered to others, then all would offer it to their lords.\nIf the Dao could be advanced to others, then all would advance it to their kin.\nIf the Dao could be given to others, then all would give it to their siblings.\nIf the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their descendants.\"*\nYet none of these are possible—why? Because **without inner virtue, the Dao cannot stand**, and **without inner mastery, the Dao cannot move**.\n\nWhen we combine the words of the sages, we see that **the state’s most vital implements cannot be lightly shown to others**.\n\nLater generations of cultivators must not treat the **Great Dao as a public matter**, imparting it indiscriminately to all, lest they **invite heavenly retribution** (天譴) and **regret it forever**. This is the meaning of **\"public yet not public, not public yet public\"** (有公而不公，不公而公)—a subtlety beyond the grasp of the unenlightened. Let them take heed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Dao Ever Does Without Doing**\n\nThe Dao ever does without doing, yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could **guard this**, all things would **transform of themselves**.\nWhen transformation is about to arise, I shall **restrain it with the nameless Primordial** (無名之朴).\nThe nameless Primordial—**it too will not desire**.\nThrough **non-desire, stillness** (不欲以靜), the world will **settle of itself**.\n\nThough the Dao is naturally without doing, yet to **fixate on non-doing** becomes the **doctrine of stubborn emptiness** (顽空之學). One must **root oneself in non-doing** (無為植其本) while **beginning action** (有為端其用)—**non-doing within doing**, **doing yet still non-doing**. Thus the **essence stands firm** (體立) and the **Dao moves** (道行), the **Dao is complete** (道全) and **virtue is fulfilled** (德備).\n\nThis is the **\"ever-responsive yet ever-still\"** (常應常靜), the **\"ever-quiet yet ever-alert\"** (常寂常惺). When released, it **fills all six directions**; when withdrawn, it **hides in the central void**. Even in this **boundless, formless moment** (沖漠無蹤), there is the **probity of seated illumination, leaving nothing unobserved** (坐照無遺之概).\n\nThough it is called **non-doing**, yet **doing is contained within it**; though it is called **doing**, yet **non-doing encompasses it**. Thus the **Great Dao is within me**, the **Great Root ever endures**.\n\nEven the most exalted lords and kings—if they lack this Dao as their foundation, then **all things are severed and difficult to transform**. Only by **holding fast to this Dao** can **all under heaven—people and things—harmonize in their natures**, **resonate in their breath**, and **transform silently and imperceptibly**, until **great peace takes form**.\n\nYet in times of prolonged tranquility, the **ancient Dao is hard to uphold**. This is the **inevitable course of human inclination** (情所必至) and the **fixed principle of things** (理有固然)—there is no cause for wonder.\n\nWhen **creation and destruction recur frequently**, and **luxury arises**, then **human hearts grow more treacherous**, and **calamities multiply**. This too is the **fate of heaven and earth**, from which **no one can escape**.\n\nOnly the **sage possesses the methods of enduring prosperity** (保泰持盈之法) and the **strategies of lasting governance** (久安長治之謀). In the age when **culture first emerges**, they **refine the nameless, undifferentiated Primordial** (浑然無名之太朴)—**without doing, without action, without thought, without deliberation**—and **apply it to themselves and to others**, **guiding those before and leading those behind**, **purely in accordance with Heaven**, unmixed with human contrivance. Thus they **stabilize the court within** and **pacify the world without**.\n\nThe **first line of the *Hexagram of Array*** (屯之初九) says: *\"The sun lingers, beneficially residing in the upright\"*—this is the **first stabilization of the unenlightened age**.\n\nJust as **stone contains jade and the mountain gleams**, and **water cradles pearls and the river enchants**, even the **primordial and undifferentiated** (凡朴) has such power—how much more so the **nameless Primordial**? To **unify all people and things under its governance**?\n\nIf it is not **restored to its original, undivided state** (不歸浑穆), then it is **impossible to make the extremes converge** (會極歸極) or **ensure all attain the ease of the mat and cushion** (咸登衽席之安).\n\nOnly by **not knowing yet knowing**, by **following the pattern of the Emperor** (順帝之則), by **forgetting morality and the Dao**, by **not recognizing the unity of Heaven and humanity**—only thus does one **truly attain it**.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The nameless Primordial—it too will not desire.\nThrough non-desire, stillness—then the world **sets itself aright** (天下自正).\"*\nThis is the **tranquil and undemanding governance** (恬淡無為), the **natural order without contrivance** (郅治無為), where **the ruler does not know what he transforms**, and **the people do not know what they respond to**. The ruler and the people **both rest in the Dao of non-doing**, and there is **an unknowing yet natural harmony**.\n\nThus **Shun governed without doing**, and so **he alone was revered through the ages**.\n\nFor those who rule over the people, can they not take **non-doing as their foundation**?\n\nThis discourse on **governing the age** holds **non-doing as its root**. The **principles of self-cultivation** are no different.\n\nLords and kings are like **the human body**—**most exalted and noble**.

forgotten.\n\nWhen one is **without knowing, without desiring**,\nserene and unadorned,\nthe mortal form undergoes transformation,\nreturning naturally to the **primordial One-Qi of Before-Heaven**—\nthus the Dao of the Transcendent is fulfilled.\n\nAs it is said:\n*\"By stillness without desire, the world will naturally align itself.\"*\n\nThis is the **single thread** that unifies the **Way of the Sovereign’s governance and self-cultivation**—\nthe thirty-eighth chapter:\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest is not virtue/power.\"*\n\nThe virtue/power of the Highest is not virtue/power,\nand thus it has virtue/power.\nThe virtue/power of the Lowest does not lose virtue/power,\nand thus it has no virtue/power.\n\nThe Highest acts without doing yet accomplishes nothing;\nthe Lowest acts and yet accomplishes something.\n\nThe Highest in benevolence acts yet accomplishes nothing;\nthe Highest in righteousness acts and yet accomplishes something.\n\nThe Highest in ritual acts yet none respond,\nso it raises its arm and forces compliance.\n\nThus, when the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nwhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\n\nRitual is but the **thinnest veneer of sincerity and trust**,\nyet it is the **beginning of chaos**.\n\nPrescience is the **flower of the Way**,\nyet it is the **origin of folly**.\n\nThus, the **true person** abides in substance, not in form;\ndwells in reality, not in ornament.\nHence, one discards the latter to take the former.\n\nIn the **ancient age**, the winds were vast and untrammelled,\neach following its natural course;\nthe waters deep and boundless,\neach resting in its own nature.\nAbove and below acted without contrivance,\nrulers and people shared in joy.\nSincerity and thickness became the custom,\nand disputes did not arise.\n\nHow profound and complete was the Way in those times!\nIt was because they abided in the **non-action of heaven**,\nfollowing nature’s spontaneous course.\n\nIn those days, the old were cherished as old,\nthe young as young,\nthe wise as wise,\nthe kind as kind.\nThey tilled the land with ease, took joy in their labor,\nfed on virtue and drank in harmony,\nknowing nothing of the names *virtue/power* or *Dao*,\nnor hearing of *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.\n\nYet they preserved their **primordial purity and integrity**,\nallowed their *qi* to move naturally,\nand harmonized with the flow of heaven and earth—\nas if untaught yet transformed,\nachieving without action,\nunited with virtue/power and the Dao,\nwithout conflict with *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*.\n\nWhen *virtue/power* and *Dao* are spoken together,\n*Dao* is the **substance**, *virtue/power* the **function**.\nWhen *virtue/power, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are discussed as a whole,\nthen *virtue/power* and *Dao* are again the **substance**,\nwhile *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* are the **functions**.\n\nLater sages, though establishing these for the transformation of the people,\nnamed *virtue/power* and divided them into *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*—\nyet within *virtue/power* are *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom*,\nand within *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* is *virtue/power*.\nThere is no separation, no lack.\n\nBut in later ages, *virtue/power* was divided.\nFurther still, *benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom* became fixated on one-sidedness.\nThis arose from the **shift of cosmic *qi*** and the **deceit of human hearts**.\n\nThe Transcendent One wished to return people to their roots,\nrestore them to their origin,\nand thus sighed:\n*\"The person of Highest virtue/power acts without doing,\nfollowing their nature without knowing of virtue/power—\nthus their virtue/power endures.\nThe person of Lowest virtue/power, knowing virtue/power’s excellence,\nloves its name and delights in its practice,\nfearing to lose it and thus their reputation.\nThese two minds—one divided, one consumed—\nshatter the singular sincerity of the Highest,\nwhere no duality remains, no thought lingers.\nFrom having virtue/power, they return to being without it.\"*\n\nMoreover, when the Highest acts without doing,\nthe people of the world align in one Way, one custom,\nall abiding in a world of non-action.\nWhen the Lowest acts with doing,\namid the rise of flourishing customs and varied governance,\nthey take joy in the constant of action.\n\nIs it not so?\nThose who forget contrivance **still the world’s machinations**,\nwhile those who delight in affairs **stir the world’s strife**?\n\nYet when times are exhausted, they return;\nwhen things are exhausted, they transform;\nwhen people are exhausted, they revert.\n\nIn this age of many affairs,\nwhen customs grow corrupt and hearts deceive,\nthe natural purity is long lost.\nThere must be a ruler who loves benevolence,\ngoverning with virtue/power, purifying the source, rectifying the root,\nturning chaos into order, peril into safety.\n\nThough forced to act,\nyet even in action, they adapt to the times,\nfollowing principle in their conduct—\naction remains non-action,\nthus the world is governed with ease.\n\nThen there are those who love righteousness,\nin times of disorder seeking to restore peace,\ntaking pride in sweeping away the old,\nyet unable to return to stillness.\nThough they may briefly pacify the world,\nrenewing people and things,\nyet those above and below emulate them,\nand the strife and contention among the people cannot cease.\n\nAs for the ruler of Highest Ritual,\nthe hearts of people grow ever more corrupt.\nThey practice the etiquette of reciprocity,\ndiscussing the ways of giving and receiving—\nsome generous in giving yet stingy in return,\nothers kind in granting favors yet vengeful in response—\nand cannot rest in tranquility.\nMorning brings changes, customs shift,\nyet they cannot harmonize near and far, great and small.\nThe slightest discord provokes raised arms and conflict,\nand war erupts anew.\nThey cannot dwell together in peace.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Way is lost, virtue/power arises;\nwhen virtue/power is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\"*\n\nDown to this day,\nas people grow more corrupt and affairs more complex,\nsincerity and trust have reached

ritual to bind the hearts of people\nhave not considered that outward compliance does not stem from the heart—\nit must end in disaster and estrangement,\nseeking safety only to invite danger.\n\nThus

      "translated_text": "*\"As for wisdom, it is not some extraordinary strategy or foresightful scrutiny—it arises from sincerity and clarity, achieved without deliberation, without study, and without effort. It is as naturally luminous as a mirror; how could it compare to deceit or baseless trust?\n\nYet the superficial trappings of the Way are not the Way itself. Moreover, excessive scrutiny under the guise of clarity will inevitably lead to emptiness, deceit, and falsehood without one’s awareness. In oneself, one may pridefully claim exceptional insight, but this is merely the beginning of folly.\n\nThus, a true man of virtue possesses steadfast discernment and resolve. He knows that sincerity and depth are the essence of ritual, so he embraces substance over superficiality; he recognizes that empty ornamentation is not true wisdom, so he seeks the real over the illusory. When discernment in selection is proper, the Great Way is not difficult to restore.\n\nThis explains why, as morality decays, benevolence and righteousness emerge; when benevolence and righteousness decay, ritual and wisdom take their place—ever descending, a natural consequence of human nature and custom, nothing to marvel at.\n\nAs for cultivation, when swallowing saliva and breathing *qi* appeared, the Way shifted; when herbal alchemy and elixir refining emerged, the Way shifted again. Down to today, myriad false paths abound—beyond reckoning! Who still understands that the *xuanguan* (玄关)—that single orifice—is the essence of cultivation?\n\nI now reveal it to people: To perceive this *xuanguan*, one must wait after great toil and great rest before its nature becomes clear. It is also said: *'When thoughts arise, that is the ailment; not clinging is the remedy.'* And again: *'Lay down the butcher’s cleaver, and you become a Buddha in this instant.'* Ultimately, it is about ceasing the tumult of worldly desires and杂念 (*zaonian*), awakening from the chaos—this is the *xuanguan*, the 'bank' one returns to.\n\nIt is also said: *'The other shore is not distant; the return of light and reflection is the shore itself.'* Yet fear arises: before the *xuanguan* opens, one may forcefully seek it; after it opens, one may obsessively guard it. Such fixations only stir confusion—like the sky, originally cloudless, yet when the clouds disperse, the vast, wondrous expanse appears. But if, after the clouds vanish, one reintroduces smoke and dust, the once-clear sky becomes constricted, murky, and unrecognizable.\n\nThe Buddha said: *'Dwell thus, subdue the mind thus.'* Such profound truths cannot be articulated in words—words only distort them. Nor can they be grasped through thought—thought only errs.\n\nAt the moment before the *xuanguan* opens, I simply follow its natural illumination. Once it opens, I rest in its effortless clarity. If thoughts scatter, I withdraw them—that is all. If the mind grows dim, I steady it—that is all. How simple and direct!\n\nYet people complicate matters by layering bed upon bed, seeking motion in motion, stillness in stillness—only to fall into contrivance. The *xuanguan* lies plain before them, yet they obscure it with later-day intellect.\n\nI reveal a key principle: Let the thoughts churn endlessly, unresolved. The moment you awaken to their nature, they vanish instantly—that *is* the *xuanguan*. Thus, cultivation depends on this awakened awareness, like the unobstructed sun in an endless sky, ever luminous. The slightest shadow plunges one into the darkness of hellish defilement. If you dispel the clouds, the blue sky and white sun stand revealed.\n\nBut if worldly thoughts arise, you remain trapped in the ordinary. This is not the foundation of the immortals.\n\nIn truth, the Daoists have no secret beyond *mingxin jianxing* (明心见性)—enlightening the mind, realizing true nature—this is the essence of cultivation.\n\nIf asked what the elixir is, it is the primordial *qi* of the *dantian* (丹田), the unborn essence. Yet this essence, when united with the innate divine spirit (*yuanshen*), becomes the preheaven *taiji* and *wujji* (太极、无极), the primordial command before parents were born.\n\nIf one establishes one’s nature as one’s fate and fulfills one’s fate through nature, then eternal life is attained.\n\nBut those who seek the *xuanguan* of the watery realm, desiring to forge the golden elixir, must first harness the preheaven breath (*shenxi*). Without it, they cannot refine, temper, or nurture—preheaven nature and preheaven fate cannot unite, and the five and six energies cannot coalesce into the golden elixir.\n\nEven so, once preheaven nature and fate are attained, without true *taixi* (胎息), it is like a man and woman unable to wed—no union, no offspring. Thus the *Danjing* says: *'True intent is the matchmaker.'* Now it is said: *'True breath is the matchmaker'*—does this not contradict the ancient texts?\n\nThe unenlightened mistake *zhanyi* (真意) as the divine essence of elixir refinement and union; *zhanyi* (真息) as the means. Yet both are merely the convergence of spirit and *qi*.\n\nWithout true breath, true *qi* cannot ascend and descend, unite, or nurture the formation of the primordial pearl. With true breath but no true intent to command, guide, and seal it, the breath cannot flow freely, advancing and retreating as it will.\n\nThus, true intent is the key to elixir refinement.\n\nYet true intent, without the original divine spirit, originates from where? Only when the *xuanguan* first opens does one recognize this true intent. Then, one must hold it fast, as Yanzi (颜子) revered his principles with unwavering devotion—thus it is attained.\n\nMoreover, the divine spirit’s manifestation *is* true intent, *is* a single good deed, *is* the way of attaining all things through one.\n\nIf students recognize this clearly, the foundation of the Great Elixir is established.\n\nChiuzu (邱祖) once said: *'If the breath is even a hair’s breadth undetermined, the fate is not your own.'* I tell students: To seek longevity, first subdue the breath.\"",

All things arise from *wújí* and take shape, truly the root of the world, thus called *tàijí*. This is the Dao.\n\nThe sage, unable to name it, yet naming it, thus says *One*.\nWithout *One*, there are no things; without things, there is no *One*.\nTo possess it is to live; to lose it is to perish.\nFrom the beginning of *yuánshǐ* onward, those who obtain *One* and manifest form and likeness—endless, unceasing, generating without end—whether vast as the *zhōusha* sands or fine as dust, none can escape it.\n\nAs the *Zhōngyōng* says:\n*\"To see it, you cannot see it;\nTo hear it, you cannot hear it;\nTo embody it, you cannot abandon it.\"*\nWhat else could this be?\n\nThus, in summary:\nThe heavens’ clarity comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe earth’s tranquility comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe spirit’s luminosity comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe valley’s resonance comes from obtaining *One*;\nAll things’ vitality comes from obtaining *One*;\nThe sovereign’s rectification of self and the world comes from nothing but obtaining *One* to uphold it.\n\nThough great and small differ in form,\nNoble and base diverge in path,\nExterior and interior vary in refinement,\nDark and bright divide in kind,\nGhosts and humans span the unseen—\nHow could anything transcend this *One* as its embrace?\n\nEven the heavens, most exalted, would fear collapse without *One*;\nThe earth, most vast, would fear upheaval without *One*;\nThe spirit, most subtle, would lose its luminosity without *One*;\nThe valley’s echo, full of *qi*, would falter without *One*;\nAll things, bearing form, would perish without *One*;\nThe sovereign, most high and noble, without *One* to uphold the world, would face peril in lofty rank and ruin in exalted name—\nHow could *One* be disregarded?\n\nIf one can disperse from *One* to the myriad things—vast, boundless, unfathomably deep—\nThen heaven, earth, spirit, valleys, all things, and sovereigns\nAll rely on this *One* as their sovereign,\nCoiling through the heavens, weaving the earth, without gaps or exhaustion, filling all without end…\nThus, its extremity is such:\nNothing is higher than the Dao,\nNothing is nobler than *One*.\n\nYet, from non-being to being—what is there to exalt?\nFrom subtlety to manifestation—what is there to prize?\nEven if nobility surpasses the capital,\nIt arises from *qi* emerging from the obscure to the manifest,\nThus it is said: *\"The noble relies on humility as its foundation.\"*\nEven if height reaches the boundless,\nIt arises from *qi* ascending from low to high,\nThus it is said: *\"The exalted relies on lowliness as its base.\"*\n\nAs for those in the world—\nThough their rank is high like a marquis,\nThough their honor is noble like a king,\nThey know the Dao arises from low to high,\nFrom humble to noble,\nThus they call themselves *\"gu\"* (lone), *\"guǎ\"* (few), *\"bùgǔ\"* (unworthy)—\nIs this not relying on humility as the foundation?\n\nIf one does not reside in humility,\nBut places oneself too high,\nThen the mind lacks mastery, the Dao cannot stand,\nThe heart becomes scattered, the spirit cannot coalesce.\nTo harmonize all things in great centrality and rectitude,\nReturning to the Dao—\nFew indeed can achieve this.\n\nEven those who drive many chariots cannot govern both center and periphery,\nYet those who drive but one chariot still hold sway within—\nThus, having chariots is like having none;\nGreed for many is not as good as embracing *One*.\n\nLike jade, if it gleams and multiplies,\nExcess breeds devaluation;\nLike stone, if it layers and piles,\nExcess breeds peril—\nThese are what the *Tàishàng* does not desire.\n\nBetter to embrace *One* in humility and lowliness,\nOnly then to ascend to heights beyond reach,\nTo nobility beyond speech—\nThis is the path of cultivating the Dao to true perfection,\nWhere there is only *One*, no second.\n\nConfucius said: *\"My Dao is one and penetrates all.\"*\nMencius said: *\"The Dao is but one.\"*\nYet—what is this *One*?\n\nThe ancients spoke of the *hónghóng-mèngmèng* state,\nWhere there is no thought, no dross—\nA single, empty yet luminous, still yet alert essence.\nThis essence, when vast, contains the *dharma-realm*;\nWhen narrow, not even a speck of dust can stand.\nWhen manifest, it reaches the eight *yí* and eight *huāng* without obstruction;\nWhen hidden, it scrutinizes even the finest dust.\nThis is the *extreme of wújí*,\nThe *non-divine divine*,\nTrue beyond naming, beyond imagination.\nThe Dao of nature and life—this is all.\n\nThe *Tàishàng* likens the sovereign to the human heart:\nIf the heart can constantly hold and preserve *One*,\nWithout forgetting or aiding it,\nMoment by moment reflecting inward,\nEver internally illuminating,\nThen it will not lose *One*.\n*One* is also *du* (solitary).\n\nSolitary as the realm of *dujue* (solitary awakening),\nWith awe and vigilance,\nThis is the originally most high and noble—\nPerhaps it can be long preserved.\nYet this is the study of cultivating nature,\nThus *shèn dān dú* (one mind in solitude) suffices.\n\nBut cultivating life involves action and effort—\nIf not beginning from the lowly,\nFrom the humble and impure,\nHow could the medicine be obtained?\nMuch less the *jīndān* (elixir)?\n\nThe lower refers to the lower *dāntián*;\nThe humble refers to the filthy lower realm.\nThe scholar, seeking *yīng lái fù* (the return of *yang*),\nWith *qi* surging upward,\nMust ascend from below to the apex—\nHow else could one obtain the pure and strong *qi*\nAs the treasure of eternal life?\n\nIf not from the lower *dāntián*, the turbid realm,\nWith divine fire descending to refine,\nHow could one forge the supreme *yang qi* as medicine?\nThe ancients said: *\"Seeking yang within yin, stealing treasure from the ghost’s lair\"*—\nTruly not false!\n\nAbove all, one must have a single heart, no dual thoughts—\nThis is the way of guarding *One*.\n\nWhen arriving at naturalness,\nForgetting self and others,\nThen *One* is obtained.\n\nWhen the cultivator reaches this state,\nAll things and matters under heaven\nAre handled with ease and appropriateness—\n*\"Obtaining One, all matters are complete.\"*\nIs this not

cease, ever entangled,\nThen one is far removed from the Dao.\n\nDo not claim that external things are too manifold to speak of the Dao;\nEven matters like nurturing the mind and cultivating the nature,\nRefining the Dao and concocting elixirs,\nAdvancing fire and withdrawing talismans,\nGathering and sealing [the essence]—\nAll these categories are but empty constructs of their forms,\nEstablished as guidelines for later scholars.\n\nIf the cultivator’s heart retains even a thread of impurity,\nIt becomes an obstacle to the Dao.\nHence the *Tàishàng* says: *\"Make ten chariots vanish without chariots\"*—\nNot wishing to be polished like jade,\nOr rigid like stone,\nBut fluid and natural.\n\nFor the Dao is but one Dao;\nWhy should the scholar seek anything else?\n\n**Chapter 40: The Emergence of Existence from Non-Existence**\nThe reversal is the Dao’s movement,\nThe yielding is the Dao’s application.\nAll things under heaven arise from existence,\nExistence from non-existence.\nThe great Dao is inherent in all—\nWhole and complete in each,\nSo why seek further?\n\nYet one knows not that since the birth of humanity,\n*Qi* is constrained by form,\nThe mind is veiled by matter,\nAnd desires are stirred by knowledge—\nThus the Dao is drowned and lost in myriad ways.\n\nUnless one expels all external disturbances within,\nAnd disperses all outer agitations without,\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath,\nSevering thoughts and forgetting artifice,\nHow could the primordial *yang qi* arise,\nAnd the Dao’s *qi* return?\n\nHence it is said: *\"The reversal is the Dao’s movement.\"*\nThis is the foundation of elixir refinement.\n\nWhen the medicine is returned to the furnace,\nAnd the elixir begins to form,\nMercury and lead merge as one—\nDay and night, one must observe internally,\nAnd the golden elixir shall manifest.\n\nFrom this point onward, with proper gathering,\nContinuous and unbroken,\nClear and ever-present,\nUsing humility to descend,\nAnd gentleness to refine—\nThis is the marvel of returning the elixir.\n\nYet it is not only in returning the elixir that this applies;\nFrom the initial practice to the completion of the elixir,\nOne must always focus the mind inwardly,\nAnd concentrate *qi* to achieve softness.\n\nFor the elixir is refined from the *Tàihé*’s singular *qi*;\nThe cultivator must treat it with humility and harmony.\nIf even a trace of roughness arises,\nThe mundane fire will stir,\nAnd harm the Dao.\n\nHence it is said: *\"The yielding is the Dao’s application.\"*\nAll matters under heaven,\nThough beginning with tangible forms and rules,\nDid not originate from existence itself.\nThe sage, when the great Dao is fulfilled,\nThough capable of infinite transformations and completeness,\nMust first gather and refine from the utmost emptiness and non-existence,\nThen the grand application flows,\nAnd boundless *qi* permeates the two extremes [of *yin* and *yang*].\n\nIf one does not refine from non-existence,\nHow could one achieve such boundless suffusion?\nHence it is said: *\"Existence arises from non-existence.\"*\n\nThe scholar’s essential cultivation:\nAt first, from non-existence to existence,\nRefining subtle *yang* from stillness;\nThen, from existence to non-existence,\nReturning to tranquility from the flourishing within;\nAnd finally, again from non-existence to existence—\nA blurred chaos, self and others forgotten—\nOver time, refining the three-inch *yang* spirit,\nAnd the six-foot golden body.\n\nThus, existence and non-existence cycle eternally,\nIterating without end.\nThe scholar must adhere to this principle,\nOr risk deviation.\n\nThis speaks of the great Dao of the golden elixir;\nIt is not something external,\nBut the true *qi* flowing through the body.\nIn stillness, it is deep as the abyss;\nIn motion, it surges like the tide.\nOnly those who cultivate with purity,\nFocus inwardly with clarity,\nCan reflect and verify it themselves—\nBeyond what words can exhaust.\n\nIf one understands that the motive of movement is the source of life’s origin,\nThen the elixir of eternal youth—\nCould it be anything else?\n\nMoreover, what is shared by all humanity,\nUnchanged, without deficiency—\nOnly when the body moves does the essence not flourish,\nWhen the mind moves does the *qi* not settle.\nThus arise birth, aging, sickness, and death,\nEndless cycles of suffering,\nUnceasing rounds of rebirth.\nTo escape all this,\nOne must first attain stillness in cultivation—\nOnly then can one grasp the motive of movement,\nAnd restore the original *qi* of life’s beginning.\n\nBut this motive of movement is subtle in force,\nTender in *qi*—\nA moment’s carelessness,\nAnd the *guǐ* water [of impurity] arises,\nTransforming the primordial flow into the coarse, post-heaven form,\nUnusable for the Dao.\n\nHence it is said: *\"See it, yet cannot use; use it, yet cannot see.\"*\nFrom this single movement onward,\nIf gathering is not lost to time,\nThen eternal life has its foundation,\nAnd the great elixir its root.\n\nIf one clings to existence and strives forcefully,\nOr holds fast to what one favors and guards rigidly,\nThough one may obtain the medicine at times,\nAnd await the elixir’s completion,\nIt cannot compare to the harmonious surge of *qi*—\nAnd because of later improper gathering,\nOr flawed refinement,\nThe singular *Tàihé qi* is injured by hasty, vulgar fire,\nThe Dao’s supreme *yang* vitality must endure humiliation and softness,\nOnly then can the elixir’s path be cultivated.\n\nHence the *Tàishàng* teaches:\n*\"Dull its sharpness, resolve its chaos,\nHarmonize its brilliance, align it with dust.\"*\n\nYet though the Dao moves through *qi*,\nIt remains non-existence giving rise to existence;\nIf existence is not nurtured with yielding,\nIt cannot return to the empty non-existence of Heaven,\nAnd how then could the Dao be fulfilled?\n\nOne may know that the return of the primordial *yang*\nIs the Dao’s motive,\nYet fail to understand that all forms must return to formlessness—\nFor form is the Dao’s trace,\nFormlessness its truth.\n\nUnderstanding this,\nOne’s cultivation and refinement will not lack a foundation.\n\n**Chapter 41: Great Vessels Take Time to

effortless,\nIts form vague and elusive.\nIf I can attain ultimate emptiness and profound stillness,\nThen without sound, the Great Sound emerges,\nWithout form, the Great Form takes shape!\n\nApplied to the four seas, it remains ever true,\nTransmitted through ten thousand generations, it knows no end—\nHow could it merely be revered in one age,\nAnd fail to shine brightly across all ages?\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"In that place, there is no evil,\nIn this place, there is no decay.\"*\nThe Dao’s establishment and practice\nTruly possess such divine and wondrous qualities.\n\nWho is it that acts for the Dao?\nWho is it that receives from the Dao?\nIt is also said:\n*\"To practice the Dao is to lend it and see it fulfilled.\"*\nThis speaks of those who embrace the Dao in the world—\nTheir use is never insufficient,\nThey nourish all things without depletion,\nThey encompass the dusty realm with abundance,\nAnd yet bring about the Great Transformation—\nTruly, they are the highest of scholars.\n\nThe Supreme Sage speaks of those in the world\nWho do not conceal their light or cultivate obscurity,\nWho establish virtue and refine themselves—\nYet when they gain even a little,\nThey boast and exalt themselves.\n\nThe Five Aggregates are not yet emptied,\nThe Six Dusts remain impure—\nLike a house roofed with thatch,\nFire depends on something to burn.\n\nIf one only cultivates oneself without seeking others,\nAnd merges indistinctly into the realm of *wuheyou* [non-existence],\nThe boundless wilderness—\nEven if external harm comes,\nIt is like lighting a fire in empty

are harmed by gain.\nWhat people revere, I also teach:\n*\"The arrogant and violent shall not meet a natural end.\"*\nI shall take this as my lesson.\n\nThe Daoist path, from beginning to end,\nHolds emptiness and nothingness as its essence.\nThe Primordial Heavenly Sovereign,\nCalled *Xuwu Ziran* [Emptiness-Naturalness],\nIs the very meaning of this.\n\nFrom emptiness comes reality—\nThis is called true reality.\nFrom nothingness comes existence—\nThis is called true existence.\n\nIf one does not embrace emptiness and nothingness,\nNot only are the Seven Emotions and Six Desires\nStifled, blocking the true spirit’s essence,\nLeaving no capacity to respond to all things and transform the yang spirit—\nEven in observing emptiness and enlightenment,\nIf one clings with even a trace of forced restraint,\nIt is but the mind controlling the mind,\nDirectly obscuring the original face beyond recognition.\n\nIn summary: emptiness and nothingness are the Dao’s substance,\nHarmonious balance is the Dao’s function.\nIf people can attain this, the Dao is nearly realized.\n\nThe Supreme Sage says, *\"The Dao gives birth to One\"*—\nWhat does the Dao possess?\nOnly emptiness.\n\nYet within ultimate emptiness,\nA breath of *qi* stirs—\nAnd thus heaven and earth are born.\nHence it is said:\n*\"There was a primal chaos, born before heaven and earth.\"*\n\nBefore the Boundless,\nIt was indistinct and formless—\nOnly this emptiness.\nWhen it moves, it becomes yang;\nWhen it stirs, it becomes yin—\nThus, *\"The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate,\nWhich gives rise to the Two Principles.\"*\n\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"The Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two.\"*\n\nIn the human body,\nWithin the subtle and obscure,\nA single awakening splits—\nHeaven and earth open and close,\n*Qi* flows in cycles—\nStillness and condensation form yin and essence;\nMotion and circulation form yang and *qi*.\n\nIf there is no true intention to govern them,\nThen yin and yang scatter chaotically,\nAnd there is no way to generate life and attain the Dao.\nThus, between yin and yang,\nThe Primordial Spirit and true intention are vital to their balance—\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Two gives birth to Three.\"*\n\nFrom this,\nOne yin and one yang,\nOne motion and one stillness,\n*Qi* flows and transforms,\nIts mastery remains unchanged—\nAnd thus all things generate endlessly—\nThis is what is meant by:\n*\"Three gives birth to all things.\"*\n\nSome say:\n*\"Heaven One generates water—metal generates water;\nEarth Two generates fire—wood generates fire;\nHeaven Three generates wood—water generates wood;\nEarth Four generates metal—earth generates metal.\"*\nUsing the Five Phases’ generation to explain\nThe Supreme Sage’s meaning of *\"One, Two, Three, all things\"*\nIs overly strained—\nBetter to say the Dao is the Boundless,\nOne is the Supreme Ultimate,\nTwo is yin and yang,\nHeaven One and Earth Two combine to form Three—\nThis is the clearest explanation.\n\n*\"All things carry yin upon their backs and embrace yang,\nTheir harmonizing *qi* is the essence of balance,\"*\nIllustrating that the Dao is the Primordial Emptiness-Naturalness *qi*,\nTransforming into yin and yang—\nAll things’ generation comes from yin and yang.\n\n*\"Suong\"* (harmonizing) means central—\nIf yin and yang lack this central harmony,\nThe center has no master, and the master is unsettled.\nEven things struggle to be born—\nHow much more so for cultivating the Dao?\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Heaven and earth blend their threads,\nAll things refine their essence.\"*\nThus, the three—*jing* (essence), *qi* (breath), *shen* (spirit)—\nMust be complete,\nSo that yin and yang merge with the Supreme Ultimate and cannot be separated.\n\nIf yin and yang exist separately\nAnd the Supreme Ultimate vanishes,\nThen the creative power is lost,\nAnd the vital force of all things is extinguished.\n\nIn general, cultivating the Dao and refining the elixir\nCannot do without true yin and true yang,\nBut without the Primordial Harmonious *qi*,\nThe elixir cannot form,\nAnd the Dao cannot be fulfilled—\nFor the Dao is

prone to loss—\nLike lightning beneath the sun,\nSwift thunder follows.\n\nOnly he who does not rely upon his height,\nWho does not boast of his nobility,\nBut instead dwells in humility and gentleness—\nSuch may long preserve his wealth and honor,\nAnd his kin shall not fall into ruin.\n\nThus, *\"gū\"*, *\"guǎ\"*, *\"bùgù\"*—\nWhat common folk abhor,\nAre the very titles by which kings and nobles refer to themselves.\n\nThen, if the Dao is the supreme treasure of Heaven and Earth,\nHow can those who cultivate it ignore the meaning of humility and gentleness?\n\n*The Shū* says:\n*\"Fullness invites loss,\nHumility invites gain.\"*\n\nThis is without exception.\n\nGain does not begin with gain,\nIt must first undergo loss before gain;\nLoss does not begin with loss,\nIt must first undergo gain before loss.\n\nThus, wealth and poverty,\nIndigence and prosperity,\nGain and loss—\nWhen extremes bend, they rise;\nWhen heights rise, they must bend—\nThis is the Dao’s cyclical flow,\nNature’s immutable course.\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot escape it,\nHow much less can mortals?\n\nAlas, the human Way is such—\nWhat difference is there from the Great Way?\n\nSeekers

suffer loss—\nThis is the general rule of all things under Heaven,\nNot merely in the cultivation of the Dao.\n\nAs for all worldly affairs,\nThey are but illusions,\nNot worth fixation—\nYet mortals still cling to them as if they were the teachings of the next generation.\n\nKnow well: the Great Dao of Alchemy\nIs for the present moment,\nYet its consequences last through all ages—\nHow can it not be taken as law?\n\nThe *Tàishàng* (太上) says:\n*\"What mortals teach, I also teach—*\n*Gentleness alone.\"*\n\nIf one does not employ gentleness but instead relies on rigidity,\nHe shall be like the tyrants of the world,\nWho ravage and plunder,\nYet none escape the law’s net\nAnd meet a good end.\n\nThus, the proud and fierce meet death,\nWhile gentleness and weakness are the path to life—\nThis is the very essence of Daoist cultivation.\n\nMy teaching of others\nEmphasizes gentleness and weakness first—\nSeekers of the Dao must not neglect this!\n\n*The Wùzhēn* (悟真)

awake.\n\nThis is the undifferentiated *qi* of *Hóngmēng* (鸿蒙),\nThe very image of the Dao.\nSuddenly, a spark of awareness stirs,\nAnd the void is pierced by clarity.\n\nAfter this stirring,\nI perceive all phenomena as void,\nA single spirit alone in motion—\nEmbracing the Primordial, guarding the One—\nSome call it *true intention*,\nSome call it *right mindfulness*,\nSome call it *the Buddha’s perfect and equal enlightenment*.\n\nAt this moment, there is but one mind,\nNo duality of thought.\n\nWhen observing the yang’s emergence and the formation of elixir,\nIf it thrives and flourishes like the blending of threads,\nThen apply the two stages of forward practice:\nThe first stage is *taking and returning to the palace*,\nThe second stage is *returning to the furnace and sealing firmly*—\nThis is the stirring as yang, yang governing ascent;\nThe stillness as yin, yin governing descent.\n\nAgain, examine the strength of the *qi*’s movement:\nIf it is now fully robust,\nBegin the *river vehicle’s* circulation,\nThe four stages of taking and refining—\nCooking and consuming the elixir,\nDrying the self’s mercury.\n\nThis is the taking of yang to pair with yin,\nBoth arising from the One.\n\nAs for each inhalation and exhalation,\nEach opening and closing—\nNone are without the One *qi* dividing into two *qi*.\nYet the heart’s essence and kidney’s *qi*,\nThe heart’s yin and kidney’s yang—\nAll depend upon the true intention\nFor their taking, refining, union, and harmonization.\n\nThis is the yin and yang two *qi*,\nCombined with the true intention as three substances—\nAll unfolding naturally,\nWithout contrivance or manipulation.\n\nThe key lies in humility and yielding,\nThe slightest trace of self-exaltation or rigidity—\nSmall, it may topple the elixir;\nGreat, it may destroy life itself.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The rigid and fierce shall not meet their death,\nI shall take them as my teachers.\"*\n\nLearners must know:\nBefore attaining the elixir,\nRely upon the heart of emptiness and stillness;\nAfter attaining the elixir,\nNurture it with the intention of gentleness and harmony—\nBeware of excessive thought and worry,\nOf self-aggrandizement and rigidity.\n\nThis is the supreme key within the supreme key—\nLearners, take heed!\n\nOtherwise, with a heart brimming with delusion,\nWhere shall the Dao reside?\n\nSuch refining is blind refining—\nA single piece of rigidity,\nThough attained, it shall be lost;\nSuch cultivation is blind cultivation—\nWithout elixir or Dao,\nYet rushing to take and refine,\nTo circulate and transform—\nNot only is it wasted effort,\nBut it shall surely harm the emotions and deplete the essence.\n\nThe damage to body and mind is not slight,\nYet they still refuse to blame themselves,\nInstead blaming the Great Dao as false,\nThe Alchemical Elixir as untrustworthy—\nSuch are they who truly do not know the Dao as the Way!\n\nOnly in perfect emptiness and perfect gentleness,\nBy preserving the heart in stillness,\nAnd nourishing the *qi* in harmony—\nShall the Dao never fail to manifest.\n\nThis is to say:\nDaoist cultivation, healing disease, prolonging life,\nAscending to immortality, becoming a sage—\nIt depends upon nothing other than the three treasures: essence, *qi*, and spirit.\n\nYet essence is not the essence of copulation,\nBut the Primordial Beginning’s true suchness,\nThe radiant singular spirit—\nAs earlier said:\n*\"Dim and vague, yet within it lies an image.\"*",

weakness into strength,\nso that one may attain immortality and verify sainthood,\nforever free from generation and annihilation.\n\nInitially, it teaches one to cultivate emptiness and foster stillness,\nbeginning from the state of no knowledge, no awareness,\nand seeking the realm of knowledge and awareness.\nThe *Yijing* speaks:\n*\"Silent and unmoving, yet responsive and thus in harmony—*\nthis is it.\"\n\nThe essence of post-heavenly cultivation has form,\nwhile the essence of pre-heavenly cultivation leaves no trace—\nin that vague, indistinct state,\nthere is yet something within.\nThis is called *the opening of the Mysterious Pass*,\n*the foundation of the Great Ultimate*—\nfrom here, one must focus the spirit upon emptiness,\nunify the *qi* with the void,\nilluminate

the Sage;\nthough it is the utmost nothingness,\nit can rule all things.\nThe ancients likened it to medicine,\nfor it can cure old age and disease,\nnurture the immortal embryo.\nThus it is called *\"the Elixir of Longevity\"* and *\"the Nectar of Rebirth,\"*\nand also *\"the True Person’s Root of Immortality\"—*\ntruly the world’s greatest treasure.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"A thousand taels

and wealth\nall believe that name can exalt their body,\nand wealth can enrich their body—\nif the body lacks name, it will be obscured and unnoticed;\nif the body lacks wealth, it will be destitute and unbearable.\n\nThus, the greedy for name\nforsake their body without hesitation;\nthe covetous of wealth\nlose their body without regret.\nThe *Guozi* says:\n*\"The avaricious man sells himself for riches,\nthe valiant man sells himself for name.\"*\n\nHuman nature is such,\nand this lament has been the same from ancient to modern times.\n\nYet consider: which is closer—name or body?\nName is external,\nbody is internal.\nPeople seek name for the sake of their body—\nwhy then, through name, do they lose their body?\nIs it that name is truly close,\nwhile the body is truly distant?\n\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nThe body is precious,\nwealth is base.\nAll seek wealth for the sake of their body—\nwhy then, through wealth, do they lose their body?\nIs it that

deeply\nemploy deceitful schemes,\ninjure their body and mind—\ntheir hoarding thus brings great loss.\n\nTo be held in high regard is to be feared by the state,\nto accumulate wealth is to be censured by Nature.\nFrom ancient times onward,\nhow many have been mighty yet met with misfortune,\nrich yet faced execution!\n\nAll because they failed to restrain themselves,\ndid not retreat and

ignorance.\n\nWords are plain, yet their meaning profound;\nspeech is concise, yet its logic subtle.\nSpeaking only when necessary,\nuttering only when the time is right—\nhow could eloquence be so vast?\nYet one only feels stammering,\nas if unable to speak at all.\n\nBecause of this—\nthis bending, this clumsiness, this stammering—\nthe heart aligns with emptiness,\nthe will aligns with humility,\nvirtue aligns with breadth,\nand deeds grow ever more exalted.\n\nThis is truly the Dao’s return to voidness,\nlearning’s return to spontaneity.\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth’s turning,\nunaware of the sun and moon’s passage—\nthus its greatness endures.\n\nIf one follows the *Taiji*’s principle,\naligns with the constant of yin and yang,\nand endures prolonged cultivation—\nwhen lead and fire are fully charged,\nwithstanding nine colds without faltering;\nwhen the elixir is refined and settled,\nforgotten after three cycles—\nis this not what the *Taishang* meant by:\n*\"Agitation overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat\"*?\n\nWhen clarity and purity reside within,\nvoid yet luminous, unencumbered—\nreturning to the boundless heaven,\nembracing the harmonious symbol—\nwhat agitation, what cold, what stillness, what heat remains?\n\nThe scholar, possessing a serene and tranquil mind,\ntransforming the seasons of cold and heat,\nconcentrates the body’s true *qi*—\nthus the true Dao of the world stands firm.\nWhat fear is there of errant paths emerging?\n\nThis is the ultimate plainness, the ultimate commonality,\nthe ultimate emptiness, the ultimate nothingness.\nBefore one attains the realm of voidness and commonality,\none only perceives fullness, not deficiency;\nonly perceives advantage, not disadvantage.\nThus the *Taishang* said:\n*\"The less one has, the more one gains.\nThe more one has, the more confused one becomes.\"*\nThe proverb states:\n*\"A great bell makes no sound,\na full jar makes no echo.\"*\nTruly not false.\n\nThe great virtue is non-virtue—\nthus it has virtue.\nGreat action is non-action—\nthus it has action.\nNot empty words.\n\nThe Dao originates as voidness, one *qi*.\nBecause of its attainment,\nit is without attainment;\nbecause of its lack of attainment,\nit is true attainment.\nThus, the higher the Dao,\nthe lower the heart;\nthe greater the virtue,\nthe more humble the will—\nthis aligns perfectly with the Dao.\n\nIf one has any excess,\none boasts arrogantly, swells with pride,\ndespises others, domineers—\nits lack of Dao and virtue is then evident.\n\nThus the *Taishang* said:\n*\"In learning, one gains daily;\nin the Dao, one loses daily—\nlose again, lose again,\nuntil reaching nothingness\"—\nonly then is attainment achieved.\n\nThe scholar must not view cultivating the Dao or refining the elixir\nlike the crafts of a hundred artisans,\ndeeming progress as personal gain.\nIf cultivation centers on voidness as its essence,\nand reaches the stage of forgetting—\nthis is progress.\nWhen forgetting is forgotten,\none has entered the realm of transformation.\n\nFor the Dao-seeker,\nretreat is advancement,\nweakness is strength.\nEmpty becomes full,\nnothing becomes something,\nreverse becomes upright,\nsubtraction becomes addition.\nThus, the scholar’s progress or stagnation\ndepends solely on whether the heart forgets or not.\n\n---\n**Chapter 46: When the World Has the Dao**\n\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nwarhorses are driven out to manure fields.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo

the Dao,\ntheir proliferation is because of its absence,\nand their fate is tied to the world’s great affairs.\n\nAlas!\nHow could we have rulers who rule,\nministers who minister,\nfathers who father,\nsons who son,\nupholding benevolence, discussing righteousness,\nreviving poetry, explaining ritual—\na time when the capital embodies the Dao?\n\nYet prolonged peace and indulgence\nbreed

If a person is in accord with the Dao, their vital essence is full and their qi abundant—why then refine elixirs? To follow and preserve this naturally is sufficient.\n\nIf one lacks the Dao, however, their essence wanes and their qi scatters, forcing them to rely on the primal spirit and true breath to cultivate body and mind. Yet at the outset of practice, they must first nourish the external fields, hence the saying: *\"Warhorses are born in the wilderness.\"* Only when yang vitality arises and medicinal herbs flourish may they proceed with the alchemical methods of advancing fire and withdrawing talismans, the tactics of field battles and fortress defense—until all impurities are purged and pure radiance emerges, as when the world is at peace and the state at ease, and the horses are returned to Hua Mountain, hence the saying: *\"Drive the horses back to manure.\"* Yet the chaos of the world and the peril to one’s self all stem from a single thought of desire. If unchecked, it festers unseen, until essence and marrow are exhausted, and life itself cannot be preserved—how tragic is this?\n\nWhen desire arises in mortals, they must seek its fulfillment to find satisfaction. Even if all wishes are granted, the abyss of desire is unfathomable, greed insatiable—coveting the next hill after gaining one, endlessly turning without rest. Those who possess the world lose it, and those who possess life—how could they not lose both?\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"Without schemes or grasping, where could they go without thriving?\"*\nOnly those who know contentment may dwell in tranquility, ever abiding in the Dao’s realm. No need for meritous deeds to mend deficiencies—only follow nature, and merge with Heaven.\n\nThe *Tao Te Ching* warns: *\"No fault is greater than the desire for desire\"*—these words teach one to cut off encroaching desires at their root, to guard against subtle transgressions, and to discipline the craft of covetousness, just as Confucius spoke of *\"caution in solitude\"* and the Buddha taught *\"right awareness.\"* All are one in the Dao.\n\nHave scholars ever glimpsed this truth?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven**\n*\"What is not wrought is perfected.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Way lies unseen within the home—\nyet one may know the world.\nNo need to peer through windows—\nyet one may perceive the Dao.\n\nThe farther one roams,\nthe less one knows.\nThus the Sage acts without striving yet knows,\nsees without gazing yet names,\ndoes without doing yet achieves.\n\nThe virtuous one possesses all things within,\nyet refines the self without stepping beyond the courtyard.\nYet the shifts of the world’s order,\nthe changes of human hearts,\nand the principles of preserving life while averting ruin,\nof reversing chaos into harmony—\nall are clearly understood within the mind’s breadth.\n\nIs this mere craft or calculation?\nTruly, all things share the same source—\nto exhaust the logic of one’s self\nis to grasp the logic of all under Heaven.\nThus, without leaving home, one knows the world.\n\nAncients shaped creation through the mind—\nno need to conceal light behind windows—\nyet the silent Emperor’s mandate,\nthe unceasing decree of Heaven,\nand the mysteries of growth, decline, and transformation,\nof yin and yang’s creative work—\nall are fully illuminated within the heart.\n\nIs this mere conjecture?\nIt is because Heaven and humanity are one continuum—\nto cultivate one’s own life\nis to align with the Emperor’s decree.\nThus, without gazing through windows, one sees the Dao.\n\nIf one wanders abroad, inquiring into the world’s affairs,\nor consorts with wise friends, probing the subtleties of Heaven’s will—\none may gain some knowledge.\nBut if one seeks it not within but without,\nnot in the self but in externals,\neven what is learned will be less than what lies near.\n\nThe Way is plain before one’s very door—\nwhy abandon the near for the distant?\n\nMencius said:\n*\"Speaking near yet pointing far is good speech,\nand guarding brevity while applying broadly is the good Way.\"*\nBy this reasoning, learning grows ever nearer yet farther,\never more concise yet expansive.\nHow can the near and the concise be neglected?\n\nThus the Sage embraces unity to encompass the three,\nobserves emptiness to cultivate stillness,\nnever stepping beyond the door or hut,\nnever treading the dusty markets,\ndwelling among trees and stones,\nroaming with deer and swine,\nmoving not a step,\nconsorting with no one—\nseemingly lonely and secluded.\nYet when the spirit is steadied, wisdom arises—\nthough not walking, one surpasses those who do;\nthough lacking knowledge, one surpasses those who know.\n\nCommon folk take what they see as their aim,\nbut the Sage does not seek what is seen—\nthus, all day long, in the unseen and unheard,\none rests from thought and discards artifice;\nin what is unseen and unmanifest,\none guards against deceit and covetousness.\n\nWith only inner knowing,\nand no outward perception—\nseemingly obscure and void—\nyet the boundless gives rise to life.\nThough unseen, it is ever more manifest;\nthough unnamed, it is ever more established.\n\nAs for the myriad beings of the world,\nthe mysteries of hidden spirits and ghosts—\nall are wrought by this Way of non-action.\n\nWith order and essentials,\nbeginning and ending are fulfilled.\nWhat is feared is being ensnared by perception,\nfixated on names and forms,\nboasting of achievements,\nand clinging to opinions—\nthus the mind is scattered, unable to unite in virtue,\nthe heart is mixed, not like the Great Void.\nHence the Way fails to manifest, and virtue does not transform.\n\nNo wonder one exhausts a lifetime’s spirit\nyet gains nothing.\n\nIf applied to governing the world,\none cannot follow principle to perfection—\nwithout action, yet all under Heaven aligns of its own accord.\nIf applied to cultivating the self,\none cannot refine the void and merge with the Way—\nwithout action, yet the self attains true perfection.\nWhat use is mere external seeking?\n\nThus the virtuous one must be cautious in solitude,\nfor the essence of humanity and the origin of Heaven’s decree\nare known without seeking.\n\nThis speaks of the Way’s foundation in non-action,\nand its key in caution in solitude—\nthus, without action, there is no failure to act;\nwithout knowing, there is no failure to know.\n\nYet this is not the lifeless non-action of withered wood and ash.\nEarlier, I spoke of *\"all phenomena emptied, one spirit alone illuminated\"*—\nthis is the true meaning.\nAgain, *\"one awareness moves, one yang arises\"*—\nthis is the primal qi.\n\nGathering herbs or refining elixirs\nis but the cultivation of these two—nature and life.\nWithout true meaning, where would nature depend?\nWithout true qi, how could life be refined?\nTo gather true meaning with true qi,\nwhen the two merge into one,\nit returns to the origin of the Great Polarity—\nthis is called the Elixir.\n\nThus, within non-action, there must also be action;\nwithin non-knowing, there must also be knowing and awareness—\nonly then does one not fall into emptiness or cling to form.\nWhen practice deepens, emptiness becomes form,\nand form becomes emptiness.\nIn time, both are forgotten,\nand all things merge in harmony—\nthus one attains perfect alignment with the Dao.\n\nIf one does not know the Way of humanity,\none may still perceive the Way of Heaven.\nConfucius said:\n*\"Heaven speaks not—\nthe four seasons proceed, and all things are born.\"*\nThis is the essence of non-action.\n\nNon-action is Heaven’s nature,\naction is Heaven’s decree;\nnon-knowing is the original spirit,\nawareness is the original qi.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nwithout the two, there is no transformation;\nwithout the one, there is no mystery.\nMysterious yet not mysterious,\nnot mysterious yet mysterious—\nthus one attains the marvel of unity within duality,\nof mystery within transformation.\n\nThis cannot be fully expressed in words.\nIt lies with you, the cultivator—\nnurture the void and the still,\nconstantly guard the empty and the luminous,\nand thus nature and life will endure,\nwhile the Great Way may be fulfilled.\n\nDo not confuse non-action with action,\nnor cling to one side—\nthough it be the true path,\ndivergent roads will open.\nConsider this well.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nTo practice the Way is to daily diminish,\nto study is to daily increase.\nTo practice the Way is to daily diminish—\ndiminish again and again,\nuntil one reaches non-action.\nIn non-action, there is no failure to act.\n\nThus, those who take the world\nmust act with non-interference.\nWhen interference arises,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n\nScholars memorize words and chapters,\nand artisans seek teachers and friends,\ngathering much knowledge and hearing much—\nonly then do talent and wisdom emerge,\nand skill and cleverness arise.",

reflect,\nto guard the heart with singular focus—\nthen though one gathers knowledge and multiplies insights,\nthe mind will scatter and the spirit will falter.\nThough learning grows, the Dao recedes,\nuntil at last one is lost in the boundless *Tai Ji*,\ndrowned without trace.\n\nThus, those who cultivate the Dao must strip away like peeling a banana leaf,\ndraw out like unraveling silk—\nthe more one strips, the less remains;\nthe more one draws, the more empty it becomes,\nuntil one reaches the realm of *wu-wu* (non-nonbeing).\nOnly then has one attained it.\n\nWhen

heart and virtue,\nand devise strategies in seclusion.\nThen the mind will not scatter,\nand wise counsel will emerge.\n\nThus, commanders issue strict orders:\nears hear nothing external,\neyes see nothing external,\nthe heart wanders not to external schemes—\nonly then can one adapt to circumstances,\nand take the world as easily as turning the palm.\nOtherwise, in endless agitation,\nthe more affairs, the more disordered the mind;\nthe more disordered the mind, the more dimmed the spirit.\nBefore the enemy even arrives, one cannot remain composed,\nand at the first clash of arms, the ranks dissolve in chaos.\nTo hope for victory in such a battle—\nhow difficult is it not to be?\n\nWhat of when the eastern barbarians are not yet pacified,\nand the western nomads rise anew—\none crisis not yet resolved, another erupts—\nif one does not master stillness to govern movement,\nor ease to await exhaustion,\nfew escape defeat and ruin.\nIn antiquity, those who fled in defeat,\nwhose cities fell in ruin,\nall succumbed to the perils of *you-shì* (affairs).\n\nThus, military strategy employs tactics of deception and ambush.\nWhen the enemy sees banners filling the horizon,\ntrees trembling like soldiers,\neven facing a great foe, they are struck with dread,\nand few dare not flee at first sight of the wind’s warning.\n\nOnly by treating affairs as if they were nonexistent,\nabandoning all entanglements,\nand focusing the heart inward—\nlike Zhuge Liang amid a million troops,\nhis hair unbound, fan in hand, effortlessly composed—\ncould he secure the survival of Shu,\nand prolong the Han dynasty in its hour of peril.\nBut if one’s heart is entangled in affairs,\nthen the mind is already disordered,\nthe spirit masterless—\nlike Xu Shu, who could no longer offer counsel\nwhen his mother returned to Cao Cao,\nand thus failed to aid the First Emperor in restoring the realm.\nHow could such a one ever take the world?\n\nThis speaks to those who cultivate the Dao:\nif they see only increase, not diminution,\nthen their mind grows dim and the Dao fails to coalesce.\nThus it is said: *\"Virtue is singular;\ntwo or three, and it grows dim.\"*\nOnly by refining and forgetting in turn,\nforgetting and refining in turn,\ndoes one not become an obstacle to the Dao.\nIf memory clings without release,\nchattering endlessly—\nthis is indeed the Dao’s greatest concern.\nThus, one must gradually dissolve and extinguish\nuntil there is nothing left at all.\nOnly then is nature fully realized.\n\nThen, from nonbeing arises being,\nand one can move unseen among spirits,\ntransformations beyond measure.\nThe scriptures say that *\"the world\"* symbolizes the Dao,\n*\"taking the world\"* symbolizes cultivating the Dao,\n*\"affairs and non-affairs\"* symbolize *you-wu* (action and non-action).\nIf one can remain pure and non-acting,\none is purely *xiantiān* (primordial) *qi*—\nhow difficult is it then to attain the Dao?\nThis is the essence of taking the world.\n\nBut if one clings to forced action,\nit is all *hou-tian* (later-heaven) contrivance,\nand one falls into a side path.\nThis is the opposite of taking the world.\n\nSome may ask: *\"How can alchemy and elixirs be non-action?\"*\nKnow this: one follows the ascent as it ascends,\nnot forcing it to rise;\none follows the descent as it descends,\nnot forcing it to fall.\nEven if gathering is endless,\nand refining methods are manifold—\nit is all pure spontaneity,\nwithout a trace of contrivance.\nThough there is action, it remains *wu-wéi*

under heaven as one family,\nunites the realm as one person—\nhis benevolence and compassion embrace all,\nas one with the people in this way.\nThus the people submit to his virtue/power and cherish his benevolence,\nloving him as their parents,\nrevering him as gods,\nlooking up to him like teachers and guardians.\nWhatever they hear or see,\nthey always measure it against the sage’s words and bearing—\nnone know anything beyond this.\nHence it is said: *\"The people fix their ears and eyes upon the sage.\"*\n\nThe people’s expectation of the sage is such—\nyet what other way does the sage

on words and laws!\n\nIn the scriptures, **\"the sage\"** is a metaphor for the heart,\n**\"all under heaven\"** for the body.\nThe sage’s cultivation of the self\nis nothing but nurturing the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi.\nYet since humans have fundamental spirit, they also have ordinary spirit;\nsince they have fundamental qi, they also have ordinary qi.\nAt the outset of practice,\nhow could one not summon other thoughts,\nor fail to stir ordinary breath?\nOnly those who understand the Dao and cultivate it for long\nwill see the fundamental spirit arise.\nIf I treat it with an even mind,\neven if other thoughts remain unbanished,\nI still treat it with an even mind.\nIf the fundamental spirit has any who cannot see it,\nsuch do not exist.\nOnce the fundamental spirit is born,\ncultivation of the Dao has a foundation—\none must then quietly guard the elixir field,\nand regulate and nourish the fundamental qi.\nIf, at this time, the fundamental qi moves on its own,\nI must treat it with harmonious qi—\neven if ordinary qi has not yet ceased,\nI must still treat it with harmonious qi.\nIf the fundamental qi has any who cannot make it arise,\nsuch do not exist.\n\nOne must know:\nthe fundamental spirit is obscured by ordinary spirit,\nlike a bright mirror long sealed by dust—\nif not quickly polished and washed,\nhow could it suddenly become clear?\nThe fundamental qi is drowned by ordinary qi,\nlike white silk stained by oil—\nif not well cleansed and rinsed,\nhow could it return to its original state?\n\nAt this point, if one generates a single restless thought,\nor stirs a single harmful intention,\nit is as if seeking the fundamental spirit as one’s true self,\nwhile the ordinary spirit only grows stronger.\nTo seek to see one’s true nature—\nis this not difficult?\nTo seek to restore one’s fundamental qi—\nis this not a great challenge?\n\nOnly the sage’s governance of all under heaven\ndoes not distinguish between goodness and evil, sincerity or falsehood—\nhe treats all with a heart of benevolence and loyal simplicity:\nthe good he treats as good,\nthe unvirtuous he also treats as good;\nthe faithful he treats as faithful,\nthe unbelieving he also treats as faithful.\nA sphere of pristine simplicity,\nblended in his embrace.\nThis is emptiness—\nthis is the Dao.\nEmptiness naturally gives rise to spirit,\nthe Dao naturally gives rise to qi.\nThere is nothing that does not come naturally in response.\n\nOtherwise,\nif the heart is not emptied,\nthere is no Dao from the start—\nand if one seeks to conquer the spirit’s obscurity,\nor make the Dao’s qi endure,\nhow could this be attained?\n\nThe cultivation of the self and governance of the world\nshare the same Dao,\nand the principles are one without division—\nto know how to govern the world is to know how to cultivate the self,\nto understand external causes is to understand internal principles.\nThus, to illustrate this principle,\nits teaching to the learner is most profound and intimate.\n\nThe student must diligently guard the true constant,\nand skillfully nourish the emptiness—\nthen the fundamental spirit and fundamental qi\nwill naturally return to their original state.\nIf one generates even a single extraneous thought,\nor stirs a single extraneous breath,\none may fear that without cultivation, the Dao cannot be attained,\nand the more one cultivates, the further the Dao recedes.\nLet the student be cautious and warned!\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Profound Nurturing of Generation**\nBirth and death.\nThose who

formless can master the formed—\nnever the formed compel the formless!\n\nAlas, all things with form have life and death,\nbut the Sage, formless, transcends them.\nThey govern the source of life and death—\nall things see them as life and death,\nyet what calamity or harm can they inflict?\nThis is the tenfold *Dao* of Heaven and Earth’s completeness,\nthe threefold interplay of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nHumans draw upon the *yang* of *Buqian* (乾) for birth,\nand meet the *yin* of *Bunkun* (坤) to die.\nThis is the fundamental principle of *Taiji*—\nthe interplay of *yin* and *yang*,\nflexing and extending,\ncycling endlessly in cause and effect.\n\nWithout *yin*, *yang* cannot manifest;\nwithout death, life has no meaning.\nThus, retreat and repose are but ways\nto nurture the profound *virtue/power* of life’s continuity.\n\nYet in their abandon to passion and desire,\nwhere reason perishes and humanity is lost,\ntheir death differs from others.\nFor those who follow *yin* and *yang* in life and death\nare truly embraced by *Taiji*’s boundless essence,\ntheir *true qi* flowing in harmony with the two principles.\n\nBut those who defy Nature’s *yin-yang* cycle\nhave lost their original *yuan qi* (元气),\nand are overwhelmed by excessive *yin* and malevolent forces.\n\nHence, they are said to be *“ten with three”* (十有三).\nThe ten represents completeness—*Dao* encompassing Heaven and Earth;\nthe three comes from Heaven’s *One* (天一) generating Water,\nEarth’s *Two* (地二) generating Fire,\nand the union of Heaven’s *One* and Earth’s *Two* forming Water and Fire’s threefold harmony.\n\nMoreover, Heaven’s *One* generates Water,\nand Metal also generates Water;\nEarth’s *Two* generates Fire,\nand Wood also generates Fire—\nthus the four symbols are complete.\n\nThe Earth has no fixed position,\nwandering through the four symbols,\nand in its purest, most refined essence—\nthe *Dao*’s ultimate substance—\nit governs *yin-yang qi*,\ndrives the mechanisms of creation,\nand in Heaven and Earth becomes *Wujiji* (无极).\n\nYet *Taiji*’s principle in the human body:\nstillness brings forth the *yuan shen* (元神) of soundless purity,\nunity without duality;\nmovement manifests *liang zhi liang neng* (良知良能) in timely action—\n*true intent*.\nTogether, they form the Five Phases.\n\nThis is the shared *virtue/power* of life’s continuity\nfor Heaven, Earth, and all beings—\npresent in all things,\nor returning to the boundless *Taixu* (太虚),\nunchanged by life and death’s rise and fall.\n\nThus, those who skillfully cultivate life\nenter their chambers in quietude,\nobserving the *One yang*’s return and renewal,\nand drawing it upward, downward,\nor back to the alchemical furnace for nourishment.\nWith ninefold transformations complete,\nthe fire’s essence is fully refined.\n\nThis is the *Dao*’s height—\nwhere dragons and tigers submit,\nand the *virtue/power* is so profound\nthat even ghosts and spirits yield.\nWhat harm then from rhinoceros, tiger, or blade?\n\nConsider the ancients:\ndwelling in secluded mountains,\nwith rhinoceros and tigers in throngs,\nand wolves as companions,\nyet willingly tamed,\ncontent in their own boundless freedom—\nmany such examples exist.\n\nOr single-riding warriors\nwho command the loyalty of warlords,\nwho abandon armor and weapons,\nrevered as divine,\nloved as kin—\nsuch devotion arises from *Dao*’s profound *virtue/power*.\n\nAnd when filial piety moves Heaven,\nor bandits surrender in sincerity;\nwhen chastity and righteousness stand firm,\nand deceitful hearts are stilled—\nall these stem from the *virtue/power* of utmost sincerity.\n\nObserve again:\nthe rhinoceros cannot strike with its horn,\nthe tiger cannot grasp with its claws,\nthe weapons cannot find purchase—\ntruly, this is no falsehood.\n\nEssentially, the *One yuan*’s *li qi* (理气)\nis not the *yin-yang* of creation.\nI can remain serene and bright,\nformless yet luminous—\nwhat then of life and death?\n\nThose who know life and death\nare bound by its traces,\nbut I can erase those traces,\nreturning to the undivided *ming* (命),\nthe *Taihe* (太和) of Heaven.\nThough traces of life and death may appear,\nthe principle endures unobstructed—\nwhy then rejoice in life,\nor dread death?\n\nThe ancient Sages chose *yi* (义) over life,\nsacrificed their bodies for *ren* (仁).\nThey saw knives and saws as commonplace,\nand boiling cauldrons as trifles—\nwhy was this so?\nBecause they found *Dao* within,\nand knew no fear without.\n\nHence it is said: *“the realm of no death.”*\n\nAnd the sevenfold completion of Water,\nunited with the tenfold, makes thirteen.\n\n**Chapter 51: Reverence for the Dao and Esteem for Virtue/Power**\nThe *Dao* gives

(泥丸),\nmingling with long-accumulated *yin* karma and dissolving,\ndescending to the upper palate,\ntransforming into sweet dew—\nthis is the *yin* essence, also called *ziqi* (子气).\n\nFrom this point, it descends to the *Chónglóu* (重楼),\npouring into the divine chamber,\nto be ingested and swallowed,\nnurturing the gentle divine fire,\nadjusting and nourishing this primordial *Dao*’s *yang* essence and ultimate *yin* essence.\nThus, the *Tàishàng* (太上) says:\n*\"Once the mother is obtained, the child is known;\nOnce the child is known, return to guard the mother.\"*\nAt first, the mother clings to the child and comes,\nthen the child clings to the mother and dwells,\nand finally, the child and mother unite in harmony and mutually nurture,\nas *yin* and *yang* reverse and merge in oneness—\nthough the body perishes, no harm befalls.\n\nFrom this moment, firmly adhere to the central rule:\none soul internally contained,\nensuring that internal thoughts do not stray outward,\nexternal thoughts do not intrude inward,\nkeeping silent and sealing the six gates,\nsoftly and subtly, unchanging and unceasing,\nneither helping nor forgetting,\nacting or not acting as if diligent or not.\nThus throughout life, the *Jīnxiān* (金仙) attainment is realized.\n\nOtherwise, if one seeks external gains,\none has already lost the internal treasure.\nAs it is said:\n*\"When the mouth opens, the divine *qi* scatters;\nWhen the mind is disordered, the fire’s power wanes.\"*\nHeeding the external while neglecting the internal—\nthe life’s essence is already spent,\nwhere then is the life’s root?\nThus, it is unsalvageable throughout one’s life.\n\nIf a person can close the *duì* (兑) and seal the gates,\npreserving the essence and abundance of *qi*,\nmerging the mother *qi* and child *qi* into the elixir,\nthe ancients said:\n*\"The Primordial Emperor of the *Yuánshǐ* (元始) suspended a single millet-seed pearl in the void,\nseemingly present yet not present,\nseemingly empty yet not empty—\nonly those who silently recognize and merge their hearts can perceive it.\nNone are smaller than this elixir;\nthose who can see it are truly wise.\"*\n\nWhen the *yang* essence

it will naturally give rise to vast, surging *qi*,\npiercing the heavens and passing through the sun.\nThus, *\"Guarding softness is called strength.\"*\n\nHowever, at the outset,\nthe divine light descends to illuminate the *qìhǎi* (气海),\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nthe golden essence radiantly manifests,\nlike tides, like flames,\nlike mist, like smoke—\nthen I must withdraw my sight and return my hearing,\nprotecting its brilliance,\nguiding it back to the earthen cauldron,\nrestoring it to my primordial *yīqì* (一气).\nIf small, it repels illness and prolongs life;\nif great, it achieves immortality and sainthood—\nwhat harm can the body suffer then?\nOtherwise, old age, sickness, and death,\ncome swiftly—\nhow can one not grieve?\nAll this is self-made;\nthe heavens do not predestine such limits.\n\nIf a person does not cherish the *Dao*,\ndo they not at least cherish their body?\nDo not abandon your body to calamity—\nregret will come too late.\n\nThis is the *Dao* of True Constancy,\nonly the Sage can follow its constancy,\nwithout defying its way.\nThus, day by day, month by month,\nthey reach the divine and boundless,\nthe ever-changing and unfathomable.\nThe saying goes:\n*\"Steadfastness is the foundation for sainthood;\na vacant heart is the vessel for the *Dao*.\"\nHow can one neglect this?*\n\nThis refers to the true *yang* essence,\nwhich originates from the moment one receives *qi* and forms the body.\nLife arises from *qi*;\nhow can *qi* be trifled with?\nConsider before birth—\nwas there not already this *qi*?\nAfter death—\nthis *qi* is not necessarily extinguished.\nThe primordial *yīqì* (一气) hangs suspended in the great void,\nwherever there is form, *qi* is within it,\nwherever there is no form, *qi* returns to the great void.\nAll things within heaven and earth,\nwith tangible manifestations,\nhave birth and death to speak of,\nbut this *qi* neither generates nor perishes,\nneither defiles nor purifies,\nneither increases nor decreases—\nempty yet not empty,\nnot empty yet empty,\nmost divine and most wondrous—\nthus it is the initial *qi* for all things under heaven to sustain life ceaselessly.\nIf a practitioner of the *Dao* knows this initial *qi*,\nthen the way of longevity can be attained,\nand the station of the Immortals can be realized.\n\nThe Immortals have no other marvel,\nmerely clinging to the *yang* essence and nurturing the *yin* essence,\nrefining them endlessly—\nthen the *yin* essence transforms into *yang* essence,\nand the *yang* essence returns to

perception when seeing a child fall into a well,\nthat moment of shock and compassionate distress.\nMy *Dao* speaks of knowledge arising from utter ignorance—\nthis is true *liángzhī* (良知, innate true-knowing).\n\nThe stirrings of such true-knowing are not difficult to recognize,\nbut to act upon them and sustain them eternally—\nthis is no simple task.\n\nWhen it moves, it is right before one’s eyes,\nyet in an instant, the lure of external things arises,\ndesires well up, emotions take shape—\nunaware, it slips into the private knowledge of Postheaven.\n\nThis is why it must be tempered and applied,\nand why it is so formidable.\n\nOnly when the eyes hold the *smart pearl* (智珠),\nand the chest wields the *wisdom blade* (慧剑),\ncan one pierce through demons,\nsever the threads of desire—\nfrom refining elixirs to attaining the *still point* (还丹),\nall are true-knowing unfolding into true abilities,\na straightforward path with no oddity—\nthis is why the Great *Dao* is so level and easy.\n\nAlas, the Great *Dao* is plain and ordinary,\nyet those who rush forward in haste to seek results\noften fail to follow the broad and straight way,\nstraying into narrow, twisted paths,\nmistaking themselves for those who have attained the *Dao*,\nyet never awakening in their entire lives—\nhow lamentable this is!\n\n*\"Zhōu yù\"* (朝喻) is the body;\nthe body wishes to be refined, not destroyed,\nso one must suppress evil and preserve sincerity—\nonly then can human desires begin to be purified,\nand Heavenly principle fully realized.\n\nWith time, the luminous light shines forth,\nhow could the field of the heart ever be overgrown?\nWith spirit unified, how could the storehouse ever be empty?\nWithout embroidered adornment, one’s honor is self-fulfilled;\nwithout ointments or grains, one’s hunger is satisfied—\nwhy cling to outward embellishments,\nor weary of food and drink?\n\nThe *wisdom blade* is sharp indeed—\nexternal weapons are of no use.\nThe Three Treasures fully attained—\ninternal wealth is inexhaustible.\n\nIf one attains this,\nthey truly steal Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* (灵阳) *qi* to make the elixir.\n\nYet today’s practitioners,\nnot following *Zhōngyōng* (中庸, the Middle Way),\ndaily incline toward perverse paths—\na body encrusted with dust,\nits filth too vast to cleanse.\nMoreover, they recklessly provoke misfortune,\nlosing the primordial *yáng* (元阳) *qi*.\n\nThus, distractions come thick and fast,\nleaving no trace of an empty, transcendent spirit.\nWhen desolation reaches its peak,\nare not the orifices fully sealed?\nWhen strength is exhausted and spirit weary,\nwhat sign of fullness remains?\nPoverty is cause for sighing—\nhas not the vital *qi* been fully drained?\n\nThey boast of outward brilliance,\nyet their adornments are but superficial.\nThey praise the blade’s edge,\nyet their belts are mere symbols of status—\nthis is already the end!\n\nYet they persist: disdaining food to indulge in rare delicacies,\ncoveting wealth to seek abundance—\nwhy not ponder how practitioners cleverly manipulate techniques,\nstealing back primordial *qi*,\nseeking what lies within rather than without?\nThe *Yì* (《易》, *Book of Changes*) says:\n*“The one who composes the *Yì* knows the art of thievery.”*\nThis is exactly what it means.\n\nIf one abandons this to seek other paths,\nhow fragmented can it be—\ndare one call it the Great *Dao*?\n\nOthers comment that the phrase *“Jièrán”* (介然)\nand the following sentences speak of a fleeting moment\nwhen a single thread of light appears—\nhow could this not be knowledge?\nYet when tested in actual practice,\none often falters in execution,\nso it is called formidable.\nThis reveals the difficulty of understanding the Great *Dao*.\n\nThe next section discusses scholars\nwho fail to grasp the fundamental source,\nmerely priding themselves on outward refinement,\nwho do not seek true traces\nbut only chase empty fame—\nlike standing a staff and seeing its shadow,\ngrasping its likeness but not its truth,\nso they are called *thieves of the staff* (盗竿).\n\nThis critique is also apt.\nFrom ancient times, all who practiced the *Dao*,\ntheir skin supple and radiant,\ntheir hair lustrous and bright—\nthese effects, though common to all,\ncannot yet be taken as definitive proof.\n\nWhat of refining the *jīng* (精, essence) and *qì* (气, *qi*)?\nWhen the *yáng* (阳) light touches,\nhow could the *yīn* (阴) gloom endure?\nLike frost and snow melting in the sun.\n\nThus, even chronic ailments and old diseases\ntransform into festering sores and pus,\ndischarged through the large and small intestines—\nnot only novices suffer this,\neven at the stage of the *Great Elixir* (大丹) attainment,\nchanges still occur.\nThe Three Corpses and Six Bandits (三尸六贼),\nbleeding and oozing pus,\ntheir stench unbearable—\nonly those whose mind is settled and intent\ncan truly trust in the principles,\nand deeply verify the scriptures.\n\nOne must know that suppressing desire and preserving sincerity,\nremoving turbidity and retaining clarity,\neach layer reveals *yīn* *qi* dispelled\nand *yáng* *qi* subtly growing—\npractitioners of the *Dao* must not overlook these inner transformations.\n\nDo not fixate on a radiant body,\nor swift, light steps—\nthese are not reliable signs.\nNor trust in levitating through clouds,\nappearing and vanishing like ghosts and spirits,\ninstantaneous transformations of *yáng* *qi*,\nor traversing ten thousand miles in a moment—\nthese too are not to be taken as the *Dao*.\n\nFor marvels and oddities,\nheterodox and perverse teachings,\nmust lead one astray,\ncreating deviant forms.\nWhat a pity that one’s entire life’s energy\nis wasted in left-handed paths and false gates!\nTo seek transcendence yet fall into the Three Paths and Six Realms (三途六道),\nis this not deeply regrettable?\n\nThe essence of this chapter from the *Tàishàng* (太上, Supreme Venerable)\nteaches that only by recognizing true-knowing\ncan one avoid error.\n\nYet today’s practitioners of the *Dao*,\nonly seek delicate complexions,\nand robust physiques—\nthey do not realize that external labor\nwears the mind,\nwhile the inner fields lie fallow,\nthe treasure-houses empty.\nMany are harmed by Heaven’s *qi* before they even begin.\n\nPostheavenly treasures, though present,\nare of what use?\nTruly, when the Three Treasures unite,\nthe outer form naturally glows.\nThose who chase external effects,\nboasting of food and clothing—\nwhy not seek within,\nand first enrich the inner wealth?\nWhen the inner wealth is abundant,\nthe outer wealth will follow naturally.\nIs this not unlike thieves,\nwho steal not Heaven and Earth’s luminous *yáng* *qi*,\nbut only the fame of sages’ cultivation?\n\n**Chapter 54: Cultivating the Body**\nThose who build well do not topple,\nthose who embrace well do not fall away—\ntheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\nCultivating the body,\nits *virtue* (德) is complete;\nCultivating the family,\nits *virtue* is abundant;\nCultivating the village,\nits *virtue* grows long;\nCultivating the state,\nits

ever new.\n\nThis Dao established within oneself,\ntransforming and harmonizing all people,\nnaturally brings deep benevolence and abundant grace,\npenetrating to the marrow and flesh,\nso the people love and revere them,\nclinging in devotion without separation—\nnot even for a breath’s parting.\nThough bound like glue and lacquer, it may be firm;\nthough mingled like water and milk, it may be harmonious—\nyet gathering and scattering are transient,\nchange and transformation swift,\nand in a moment, discord appears.\nBut benevolent heart and benevolent reputation—\nthose touched by its grace love without forgetting,\nthose who hear its wind cherish without abandoning.\nHow different from children depending on their parents,\nor limbs obeying the heart—\nno separation, no

feast.\nIt is said:\n*“He who has *virtue* for ten generations\nshall have descendants to preserve it for ten generations.\nHe who has *virtue* for a hundred generations\nshall have descendants to preserve it for a hundred generations.”*\nAnd for those whose *virtue* endures eternally—\nthough billions of years pass,\ntheir descendants, generation upon generation,\ngrow ever more numerous and

If one harmonizes nature and life, blending spirit and *qi*, then they embrace the Primordial and preserve the One. My life is determined by me, not by Heaven—what escape is there? Thus, spirit depends upon spirit, *qi* upon *qi*, a single pulse transmitted, a single truth permeating—one can then undergo myriad transformations, vanishing as ghosts and emerging as gods, manifesting countless, boundless forms, enjoying countless, boundless years. How could it be otherwise than: *\"a child begets a grandson, who again begets a child, child upon child, grandson upon grandson—roots deep and leaves flourishing, source distant and flow enduring, with unbroken ancestral rites across ten thousand generations?\"*\n\nYet it is no more than using primordial *qi* as medicine and primordial spirit as the alchemical fire. For primordial *qi* is no-*qi*, primordial spirit is no-spirit. Refining *qi* with spirit to attain the *Dao* is like refining medicine with fire to forge the elixir. Common elixirs may succeed or fail, but the divine elixir knows no end nor beginning—thus it is said: *\"The Great Elixir Dao endures ten thousand years without erosion.\"* It is nothing but cultivating one’s own virtue and perfecting one’s own body, not relying on later acquisitions or external sources—thus its virtue is true.\n\nThough Heaven and Earth give birth to humanity, clean and turbid differing, the wise and unwise varied, yet when the august and sacred descend—from the family to the world—each possesses an inherent constancy. Thus, a single heart can permeate myriad households, a single virtue can inspire myriad people. Cultivating the self to harmonize the family leaves virtue in abundance; cultivating the self to transform the village extends virtue’s reach. As for governing the state and pacifying the world, it is nothing but *\"sitting in ease while the world transforms\"*—there is no external cultivation of the self that can universally attain such success. This is the constant *Dao* of the age.\n\nConversely, if one cultivates the self, how could it differ? Discussing the state and the world, it is fundamentally a matter of progressing from near to far, layer by layer. When the three—refined essence (*jīng*), *qi*, and spirit—are all present, it is not a step-by-step process. Speaking of initial practice: *\"refining essence,\"* yet *qi* and spirit are also involved. The second step: *\"refining qi,\"* yet spirit and essence are also present. The third step: *\"refining spirit,\"* yet essence and *qi* are also there. Returning to emptiness and merging with the *Dao*, the *Dao* merging with nature—from beginning to end, they never depart. To depart is to lose the *Dao*.\n\nThe body is like essence, but essence is not the essence of mutual resonance—it is the primordial essence received from the void’s five elements at birth. Cultivating the body is refining essence into *qi*. The practitioner, at the outset, obtains this essence to live and grow with it. Cultivating with essence is no different from cultivating the body itself—how true is this! Speaking of *qi*, essence is closer to the body, while *qi* is slightly more distant. *\"Cultivating the family, its virtue is abundant\"*—for gathering external true yang *qi* to refine internal true yin essence is like harmonizing the self to govern the family. What surplus does one not possess from what is inherently one’s own?\n\nThe village, when viewed from the body, is even more distant, yet closer than the family—just as spirit is. Spirit, like fire, belongs to *qi* in its heat and to spirit in its light—thus, two yet one. Cultivating the village is refining spirit back to emptiness. Hence it is said: *\"Its virtue is enduring,\"* for longevity and vast duration. As for the state, compared to the village it is nearer, yet more distant than the body—its breadth and width cannot be seen at a glance. The state is like the void; cultivating the state is refining the void to merge with the *Dao*. When refining reaches the void, it becomes one with pure emptiness, illuminating the great thousand—how much more so the world! Thus it is said: *\"Its virtue is universal.\"*\n\nAs for observing the body through the body, the family through the family, the village through the village, the state through the state, and the world through the world—it is nothing but using one’s own self and family as the model for the world’s self and family, taking the highest as an analogy. The intent is profound, the meaning subtle. The Great *Dao* has no other path—refined to its utmost, reaching the natural void. Exhausted!\n\nThose who study the Great *Dao* have no other way than *\"reducing again and again, until non-action is natural.\"* Non-action yet nothing remains undone—exhausted!\n\nYet internal elixirs and external elixirs, internal *dan* and external *dan*—filling the *kàn* with *lì*, extracting lead and adding mercury—various metaphors and names, ultimately no more than cultivating the essence, *qi*, and spirit inherent in the body, received from Heaven and Earth at birth. Since they come with life, they are inherently possessed, yet they become enmeshed in the fleshly shell—thus they are called *\"yin essence, yin qi, yin spirit.\"* Since they come with life, they are called *\"internal medicine.\"*\n\nWhen the practitioner begins their work, they must first close the senses and concentrate within, regulating their breath, merging the three primals into one cauldron, and refining the three primals within that single cauldron—named *\"refining essence,\"* yet in truth, spirit and *qi* all return to one orifice. Only when spirit is harmonized and *qi* flows freely, blending into one, does the *qi*-mechanism activate, steaming and floating—this is called *\"qi-transformation,\"* or *\"gold born from water’s depths,\"* or *\"the common parents unite to produce the medicine.\"* This is the way of the world’s men and women, requiring the method of procreation. If one does not know the reverse cultivation, the essence will instantly transform into tangible, post-heavenly *qi*, leaking through the kidney passage. Hence: *\"Consolidate the *qi*, preserve the essence—this is the decisive path to longevity.\"*\n\nIf one seeks longevity, the transformation of essence into *qi* is the wondrous elixir of life.",

      "translated_text": "「When conflicts arise, one must urgently summon the *Tian Gang* (天罡) to subdue within, thrust the *Dou Bing* (斗柄) outward, advance and retreat the *He Che* (河车), and draw back the *Zhong Gong* (中宫) to forge anew. This is the refining of the inner elixir, where essence, *qi*, and spirit merge into one—how could it be merely *qi-transformation*?\n\nThe interplay of inner and outer, of *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (离), begins with the body’s inherent capacities, converging in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), nurturing for a moment, and thus *qi* is born—this is the infusion of spirit into *qi*, whereby the essence within the body refines the *Ling Yang* (灵阳, \"heavenly earthly *qi*\") drawn from the cosmos, achieving *essence-refining into *qi-transformation***.\n\nNext, this *qi* is drawn and ascended, guided and descended, returning to the *Tu Fu* (土釜, \"earthly cauldron\") for repeated steaming and refining—this is the method of *\"leads smelting mercury\"* (铅制汞), where the *yang qi* submits to the *yin essence*. The essence is originally what the body inherently possesses, hence it is called *\"Li ji yin jing\"* (离己阴精, \"separate from oneself *yin essence*\"*). The *qi*, born from essence-transformation, is thus termed *\"Kan wu yang qi\"* (坎戊阳气, \"Kan’s *wu* phase *yang qi*\"*).\n\nNot all *qi* belongs to the heart, nor is it generated within the kidneys. From *Yong Quan* (涌泉) to *Qi Hai* (气海) all belong to *yang*—*yang* is *Kan*. From *Ni Wan* (泥丸) to *Xuan Guan* (玄关) all belong to *yin*—*yin* is *Li*. Thus, the *qi* of water and fire is *Kan* and *Li*, not the heart and kidneys themselves, which is now clear.\n\nAgain, when *Kan* contains *qi*, it is called *Di Po* (地魄)—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎, \"White Tiger\") of external elixir, and the *Jin Dan* (金丹, \"Golden Elixir\") of the inner. This elixir arises from extracting *lead* (铅) and adding *mercury* (汞), merging into one—both belong to the *Shui Fu* (水府, \"Water Palace\") *Xuan Zhu* (玄珠, \"Mysterious Pearl\").\n\nThe distinction between inner and outer is but layer upon layer, not truly separate. When the *Li Gong* (离宫, \"Abode of *Li*\") contains essence, it is called *Tian Hun* (天魂, \"Heavenly Soul\")—this is the *Qing Long* (青龙, \"Green Dragon\") of external elixir, but the true essence of oneself in the inner. *\"Jin born from water\"* (水中金生) is the *qi* transforming within essence—this is the *Bai Hu* (白虎) *initial crescent qi* (初弦之气) of external elixir, and the *silver within lead* (铅中之银) of the inner.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Jin Dan* (金丹) is the supreme elixir of longevity.\" Only when this *Qian Yuan* (乾元, \"Primordial *Qian*\") *qi* sinks into the human body, and is not smelted by the *Shen Huo* (神火, \"spiritual fire\"), will it remain submerged and inert. And even when it moves and inclines, this is like the oil in a lamp—without oil, the lamp extinguishes; without *qi*, the person perishes. Life arises from this, hence it is the supreme elixir of longevity.\n\nFor it originally falls into *Kan* (坎) from *Qian* (乾), yet now returns from *Kan* to *Qian*—this is the origin of the *Jin Dan* doctrine.\n\nIf one seeks longevity, apart from this *Shui Xiang* (水乡, \"Water Domain\") *lead* (铅) essence, there is no other path. Though this *Jin Dan* is said to be inherent in all, without the *Shen Huo* (神火) to temper and refine it, there is no way to produce it.\n\nOnce the true *gold* (真金) is born, one must again subdue the *Bai Hu* (白虎) and tame the *Long* (龙), causing the *Qing Long* (青龙) to submit to the *Hu* (虎). The *Long* (龙) and *Hu* (虎) *qi* reconverge in the *Huang Fang* (黄房), their *qi* devouring and consuming each other to form *Jin Dan*.\n\nWhen the *qi* returns to the *Tu Fu* (土釜) and meets with true essence, it is nurtured by the *Shen Huo* (神火) to form the *Sheng Tai* (圣胎, \"Sacred Embryo\"). Once the embryo is formed, internally one employs the natural spiritual fire, softly permeating the *Shen Fang* (神房, \"Spiritual Chamber\"), while externally adding the drawn and tempered mundane fire, flowing throughout the body. This is the daily practice of *\"packaging one’s own mercury to consolidate true essence\"* (运己汞包固真精); over time, the embryo dissolves and one transcends.\n\nAscending to the *Ni Wan* (泥丸), refining all voids, one strives to return to the original, natural state. It is neither the three treasures of essence, *qi*, and spirit being distinct, nor the inner and outer elixirs being separate. If one does not sit until the meditation cushion is worn through, nor grind until the knees are calloused, enduring self-suffering and self-refinement—how could one ever penetrate the profound truth?\n\nI now briefly record the general principles, merely pointing the way for later students. The Dao is inherently ordinary, nothing extraordinary—yet the more one refines, the more ordinary it becomes.\n\nOther transformations are unfathomable; in the eyes of the world, they seem unattainable heights, mysteries beyond comprehension. Yet, as the *Taoist Canon of the Supreme Dao* (太上道德一经) reveals, even the Three Pure Ones (三清) and the Supreme Venerable (太上) are but ordinary mortals transformed.\n\nFor the mortal clings to life and death as joys and sorrows, while the sage views them as day and night. Life and death are like waking and sleeping—one must follow them naturally, without disturbance. Those who say longevity and immortality are the delight of the sage are mistaken.\n\nThe mortal takes pride in longevity, but the sage finds joy in *Xu Li* (须理, \"following the natural order\"). Even if one sacrifices life for virtue (*Sha Sheng Cheng Ren* 杀生成仁) or discards life for righteousness (*She Sheng Qu Yi* 舍生取义), it is something the sage has always willingly embraced. Otherwise, who would not fear the horrors of the guillotine and the saw?\n\nFrom ancient times, noble and virtuous souls have often regarded the cauldron and the furnace as joyous realms, and death as a peaceful path—because they have seen the truth clearly and believed in the fate of life. Their life and death are but the operation of this heart. To live in unease is worse than to die swiftly, just as to cling to pain while awake is worse than to rest in eternal slumber.\n\nSo long as spirit remains and principle is complete, what is life to be honored, or death to be shamed? One who listens to the operations of *Zao Hua* (造化, \"Creation and Transformation\") will never cling to life in the mortal world.\n\nIf one loves life and fears death, they are but vulgar and common folk, not the study of sages who follow the natural order in all things. Otherwise, why did Confucius die at seventy, and Yanzi at thirty? They acted according to Heaven’s will, daring not to defy it.\n\nThis is something no ordinary mortal could ever comprehend.»",

      "translated_text": "This *embroidering-and-fuling* qi, within the human body, is like the inner fire stopping and the outer form remaining still—undisturbed, allowing the breath to flow naturally. For those whose practice is refined, at such times, one need not consciously direct the mind; if one has not yet reached this stage, the mind of awareness must not be forgotten. If forgotten, one risks slipping into unconsciousness, where thoughts arise and vanish in endless cycles, causing the original, pure nature to be submerged beneath the waves of birth and death.\n\nThe ancient Buddhas said:\n*“To know the source of arising is to know the source of cessation.”*\nThus, through such cultivation, over time one perceives the beginning of arising and cessation, and again, over time, the beginning of non-thought—then it is attained.\n\nAs for the teachings of the *Huángtíng* [Yellow Court], they lie in neither existence nor non-existence, neither within nor without; yet they are also within the colored body, yet not within the colored body. Where, then, is this wondrous secret?\n\nIt is what the ancients called *“concentrating the spirit in the void, merging the qi in the boundless.”*\nTo concentrate the spirit in the void and merge the qi in the boundless is like dwelling in the *dantian*, yet not fixating the gaze inward to stare, nor forcing the spirit-qi to cluster within. Only by concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài* [navel region], not far from the flesh and skin—this is the meaning of *“neither within nor without.”*\n\nWith intent focused here, one feels the breath at the nostrils cease, while the *dantian*’s qi rolls and churns at the juncture of inner and outer, knotting into a mass. One then sees the *embroidering-and-fuling*, the *hun-hun wū-wū*—the boundless, lively, and unrestrained movement, as it ebbs and flows, truly merging with Heaven’s primordial qi in seamless unity. Life’s essence, life’s qi, and life’s spirit all arise here, not far from Heaven.\n\nThis is the meaning of *“merging the qi in the boundless.”*\nThe ancients called it *“primordial qi,”* *“fetal breathing,”* *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels.”*—what else could it be?\n\nThis *primordial qi* is the undifferentiated, formless, nameless, and boundless *hun-hun wū-wū*—a single, pure breath. As for *fetal breathing*, when a person first receives breath in the womb, the body is nourished there before the mouth and nostrils open—how else could breath be taken? Only this *qìhài*’s qi, connecting with the mother’s navel-wheel, allows growth to unfold. When the child emerges with a cry, this qi then circulates through the nostrils, each establishing its own *qián-kūn* [heaven-earth]. My demonstration shows the *qìhài*’s qi interfacing with the external Heavenly breath—neither within nor without, *embroidering-and-fuling* in fusion, blending into one—this is returning to the initial moment of receiving breath, reconnecting with the mother’s qi. This is *fetal breathing*.\n\nAs for *“the True Person’s breath reaching the heels,”* it means the True Person’s breath is stored deeply and extended subtly—unseen, unheard, untouchable, profound and sealed, like breath reaching the soles of the feet. Though the breath of the nostrils can be used, it must follow its natural course; one must not rely solely on it for inhalation and exhalation. If one uses only this breath without concentrating the spirit at the *qìhài*—one inch and three *fēn* below the navel—failing to find this void within, to draw Heaven’s breath into the boundless, the clear and turbid will remain intermixed, and the elixir cannot be forged.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*“Heaven’s single true breath gives birth to man—\nthis breath is neither mouth nor nostril,\nnor the knowing, moving soul.”*\nThey also said:\n*“The Mysterious Female’s gate few know—\ndo not wastefully act through mouth and nostrils.\nThough you practice inhalation and exhalation for a thousand years,\nhow will you grasp the Golden Rooster and the Hare?”*\nFrom these words alone, it is clear: *“Exit through the Mysterious, enter through the Female”*—this lies between the *dantian* and the flesh, one inch and three *fēn* below the navel, where the vapors condense into a unified whole.\n\nThose who study the Dao—whether during tea or meals, in speech or social exchange—should subtly focus a little intent on this void within, naturally merging the qi in the boundless. One will then perceive the true qi stirring, in a wonder beyond naming. Yet in this breath-work, awareness does not enter inward, and the *kǎn* [water] naturally clarifies.\n\nThis is the unspoken secret of generations of immortals and sages. I now reveal it plainly—later scholars must not dismiss it as mere words.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight: Calamity and Fortune Intertwined**\n\nWhen governance is *mèn-mèn* [dim and indistinct],\nthe people are *chún-chún* [pure and sincere].\nWhen governance is *chá-chá* [sharp and scrutinizing],\nthe people are *quē-quē* [deficient and weary].\n\nCalamity and fortune lean upon each other;\nfortune and calamity lie hidden within.\nWho knows their ultimate end?\nPerhaps there is no fixed principle.\n\nWhat is upright becomes strange;\nwhat is good becomes ominous.\nThe people’s confusion has long endured.\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not pierce,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nHeaven and Earth act without intent yet transform and nourish;\nthe sovereign rules without action yet achieves harmony.\nThis is the Dao of *wuwei*—\nthe great principle and law by which the sage opened Heaven and Earth,\nharmonized the world, and ordered all things.\n\nThe ruler governs the myriad people,\nregulating all beneath Heaven—\nnothing surpasses this.\nIf one resorts to *youwei* [action],\ngovernance is not true governance,\nrule is not true rule.\nThough literature may flourish and achievements gleam,\none cannot achieve the *xīxī yùyù* [harmonious and radiant] age of shared joy and prosperity.\n\nThus the *Tàishàng* [Supreme Sage] said:\n*“Governance is rectification”—*\nrectifying others through one’s own rectitude.\n\nFrom ancient times, those who ruled the people\nestablished human norms and ordered Heaven’s patterns,\nacting as if knowing yet not knowing,\nacting as if acting yet not acting—\nletting Heaven’s natural impulses move freely.\nThey never forced clever schemes,\ninvented measures, or promulgated laws.\nYet through a single virtue, they resonated in harmony,\ntransmitting meaning beyond words.",

momentum is relentless.\n\nNo wonder deceit and guile become habitual,\ningrained until none awaken.\nThis has been so for ages.\n\nThus the Sage governs the world,\nrooting governance in the Way of non-action,\nrectifying himself to transform others.\nThe square is square without knowing its squareness—\nperhaps it masters adaptability without rigid rules?\nThe austere is austere without knowing its austerity—\nperhaps it blends with the common, its light unbroken?\nAt times, uprightness is not blind compliance,\nnor is it unchecked indulgence.\nUpholding principle in action, never daring excess—\nits rigid yet revered norms are truly awe-inspiring.\n\nAs for transforming all beings,\nits benevolence extends to the four quarters,\nlike stars and clouds in radiant display,\nyet it hides itself, never flaunting its brilliance.\nHow does it vanish its traces and silence its voice?\n\nThis is non-action as essence,\nnaturalness as function—\ngoverning through desire, applying principle.\nWhen the winds of the four directions stir,\nwho could fail to join in harmonious transformation,\nto wander together in the ancient Heaven?\n\nIs this not so?\n\nThe Dao is called the Great Dao,\nthe elixir is called the Golden Elixir—\nboth are nameless, formless.\n\nIn Heaven, it is the clear and empty *qi*;\nin man, it is the void and natural.\nFrom beginning to end of cultivation,\nnothing transcends this.\n\nIf one knows the boundless and indistinct\nis the root of the Great Dao,\nthe origin of the Golden Elixir—\nand from the utmost stillness and sincerity,\nnurtures the undifferentiated, the unknowing,\nthe thoughtless and desireless true essence—\nthen one’s nature, emotions, vital essence, and spirit\nare all things of the primal *Tàihé* *qi*.\nWith this to cultivate the Dao, the Dao is complete;\nwith this to refine the elixir, the elixir is perfected—\nwhat strange danger or peril remains?\n\nBut if one ignores non-action as foundation,\nfixating only on action as achievement,\nthen knowledge never ceases,\ndisturbance only multiplies—\nhow could one avoid falling into the later, shaped, and chaotic?\n\nThe Supreme Sage likens governance to the Dao,\ncompares the people to the body.\nCultivating the Dao through primal non-action\nforges an unbreakable golden body;\ncultivating the Dao through later awareness\nhow could it avoid duality of spirit?\nEven if refined well,\nit is but a preserved corpse—\nhow could it transcend yin and yang,\nescape birth and death,\nand become an immortal for all ages?\n\nWorse still, if one falls into action,\nthe *Tàijí* divides and yin and yang arise,\nyin and yang separate and good and evil emerge—\nthen calamity and blessing alternate.\n\nWho knows that the ultimate attainment of cultivation,\nthough it may require some action,\nmust arise from action within non-action,\nfrom function within non-function,\nonly then avoiding extremes?\n\nMencius said: *“Act, yet do not force.”*\nThis is the essence of cultivation.\n\nThe human heart—\nwhen one aspect moves, another stirs;\nwhen one aspect is yin, another is yang.\nEvil and rectitude, good and bad—\nthey cycle and interweave without end.\nThus rectitude contains eccentricity,\nvirtue contains ominousness.\nOnly in undivided oblivion,\nwhere no distinction of rectitude and eccentricity exists,\ncan good and evil vanish.\nOtherwise, rectitude returns as eccentricity,\nvirtue reverses as ominousness.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*“Heaven honors non-action as supreme,\nman burdens himself with action.”*\nThus, when action arises,\nit must return to non-action\nto avoid the disaster of overturning the elixir.\n\nAlas, the common folk—\nspeak of the elixir, and they cling to the *dāntián*;\nfixate on the River

frugality.\nOnly frugality is early cultivation.\nEarly cultivation is called accumulating virtue.\nAccumulating virtue ensures nothing is unconquered.\nNothing unconquered means its limits are unknown;\nunknown limits mean one can possess a realm.\nPossessing a realm’s foundation means eternal life and longevity.\n\nThe way to govern humanity is the way to serve Heaven—\nHeaven and humanity are fundamentally one *qi*.\nThus, governing humanity is the means to serve Heaven,\nand serving Heaven does not go beyond governing humanity.\nDo not say Heaven’s Dao is distant—\nit dwells within humanity’s nearest path.\nIf you do not know Heaven’s Dao,\nfirst observe human nature.\nTo exhaust human affairs is to fulfill Heaven’s Dao.\nThough high and low may seem distant,\nif the people are settled, Heaven’s will is unified.\n\nIts essence lies in prioritizing agriculture and roots,\nteaching the people to till and sow first.\nFor the people are the foundation of the state,\nand food is the people’s Heaven.\nWhen frugality is practiced,\nclothing and food are abundant,\nand families are secure.\nAs Mencius said:\n*“Cultivate the five grains,\nand when the grains ripen, the people thrive.”*\nAgain he said:\n*“When the sage governs the world,\nmaking grain and fire as accessible as water,\nhow could the people fail to be benevolent?”*\nThus, those in power must urgently practice frugality,\nso the people may take joy in their work,\nlive in peace,\nand nurture life while honoring death.\n\nBefore they even see or hear,\ntheir hearts are already served,\nand they willingly turn toward it,\nas if feasting on the finest sacrifices.\nThis is virtue cultivated without speech,\nelevated without proclamation.\n\nEven with three years of labor and one of rest,\nor nine years of labor and three of rest,\nwith abundant millet and sorghum,\nbrewing wine and *li* for offerings,\nbestowing upon ancestors and conducting rites—\nvirtue accumulates layer upon layer.\nWho else but this could achieve it?\n\nThus, the enlightened Heaven is reopened,\nand boundless blessings are bestowed.\nNaturally, the weak are protected,\nthe ignorant guided,\nthe chaotic subdued,\nand the reckless preserved—\nnothing they confront is unconquered.\nTheir advance is unstoppable,\nno foe dares to resist.\nNot only neighboring states bow in awe,\nbut distant lands also send envoys with offerings.\nEastward and westward, northward and southward,\ntheir influence spreads without end—\nwho can fathom its limits?\n\nWithout limits, the Imperial Dao flourishes,\nthe realm is

descendants.”*\nThis is unerring truth.\n\nWhen a person governs a state,\nthey have the means to obtain it—\nand what is that means?\nThe *mother-qi* of the state.\nWithout mother-qi, how could one obtain the state?\nThis is the fundamental truth all should urgently discuss.\nBefore possessing a state, one must seek the mother;\nhaving possessed it, one must cherish the mother.\nA state’s mother is like a tree’s root,\nwater’s source—\nenduring and unceasing.\n\nThis is the way of governing the world,\nparallel to governing the self.\nThose who cultivate the Dao\ncan embrace unity, still the breath, and harmonize the spirit,\nfirst seeking the *mercury child* to find the *lead mother*,\nthen nurturing the *lead mother* with the *mercury child*,\nuntil lead and mercury merge,\nreturning to the original,\nreverting to the Primordial.\nThis is the way of deep roots and firm foundations—\neternal life and longevity.\n\nThus, the ordinary becomes sage,\nand humanity becomes Heaven.\n\nThe way to govern the self is no different from governing the world.\nThis is exhausting human affairs to fulfill Heaven’s Dao—\n*“Heaven and humanity are one *qi*,\nmutually responsive and unified.\nYang descends from the void,\nembracing me as master.”*\nIts Dao is not beyond emptiness,\nits function akin to tilling and sowing.\n\nFirst, nourish, preserve, and inspect.\nThen, use nature to govern emotions.\nWhen water and fire blend,\nkan and li unite,\npre-Heaven *qi* moves,\ncirculating the Microcosmic Orbit—\n*“When Heaven and Earth’s union ceases,\na single point descends to the Yellow Court.”*\n\nThis draws the *kan*’s overflow into *li*’s void,\nsecuring the foundation of life—\nthe work of human and immortal is complete.\n\nThis is like the frugal ruler clearing land and planting,\npruning and weeding before sowing the five grains.\nThen, taking the *li*’s yin essence,\nlowering it into the *kan*’s gate,\nmerging the *kan*’s yang *qi* with the *li*’s yin

the elixir*—\nall must be guided by *gentleness*,\nand anchored in *stillness*.\nThough it may be said that *gentleness* is useless weakness,\nand *seclusion* hard to achieve,\nyet at the outset of *meditative sitting*,\nmovement must arise from stillness,\nand *rigidity* from *gentleness*—\nonly then is the true Dao/Way revealed.\n\nThe analogy *“the great realm descends”* speaks of water,\nwhich has both ascent and descent—\nthe water above must flow downward\nbefore it finds its end.\nIf the great realm humbles itself,\nwithout a trace of arrogance or pretense,\nit will be revered by all under Heaven—\njust as the lowlands gather streams from every direction,\nso too its influence is inevitable.\n\nThus it is called *“the pivot of the world.”*\nWhen the world’s realms converge,\nit is because they can descend.\nDescending, their *qi* is most *gentle*—\nnot the utmost *rigidity*.\nWhat is more *vigorous* than the *vigorous* (*yáng*)?\nWhat is more *gentle* than the

virtue* surpassing others\ncan achieve such *tranquil inclusiveness*.\n\nIt is fitting that the world should converge in *Rén* (*benevolence/heart*),\nand all directions submit to *Mìng* (*command/ordain*).\nThe petty, insignificant realms—\nall equal in their *feudal apportionments*,\nas *vassal ministers* offering frequent tributes,\nrushing forward in fear of falling behind—\nthey

people,\nand *Mìng* (*command/ordain*) come to them.\n\nMoreover, humans must have *aspirations* and *desires*—\nnow the great realm desires to *enfold* others,\nthe small realm desires to

*receptive* (牝).\n\nNow, when *li* (離) is *empty* (虚) it becomes *yīn*,\nand when *kān* (坎) is *full* (满) it becomes *yáng*—\nthis is what *The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) says:\n*“Though others are hosts, I am the guest”*;\nit is also said:\n*“Yáng is the male body, even in women;\nyīn is the female body, even in men.”*\nThis is the *inversion of Heaven and Earth*,\nwhere *li* reverses to become *male* (牡),\nand *kān* reverses to become *receptive* (牝).\n\nThe method of cultivation demands\nthat the *heart*’s rigid *qi* be transformed into *gentleness*,\nand its restless nature be made *still*;\nwhile the *kidneys*’ *gentle qi* becomes *rigid*,\nand its *stillness* turns *active*.\n\nThus, the *gentle and harmonious* nature of *li*\nnurtures the *vigorous and male* essence of *kān*—\nthis is the saying:\n*“Fire nourishes wood’s essence within,\nwater forges adamantine gold.”*\n\nOne must *use the heart to direct the qi*\nand *use nature to restrain emotions*.\nWhen emotions do not move recklessly,\nit is through *silent stillness* and *gentleness*,\nthrough *humility and forbearance*—\nthis refines the *heart-nature* (心性).\n\nTherefore, the *sweet nectar* (美液) of the *Upper Field* (上田)\nflows into the *Primordial Sea* (元海);\nthe *essence-liquid* (液) then transforms into *qi*\nand enters the *Elixir Field* (丹田).\n*“The Great State submits to the Small State”* (大国下小国)\nrefers to the descent from the *Upper Field* to the *Lower Field* (下田).\n\n*“Taking the Small State”* (取小国)\nmeans extracting the *kidney-yang* (金水) *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,\noperating the *River Vehicle* (河车) in reverse,\nand ascending it to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷).\n\n*“The Small State submits to the Great State”* (小国下大国)\nrefers again to ascending from the *Lower Field* (下田) to *Kūnlún* (昆仑),\nthen descending into the *Yellow Court* (黄庭).\n\nTo *“take the Great State”* (取大国)\nis to merge the *golden essence* (金液) of *Kūnlún*\nand direct it into the *Yellow Court*.\n\nI use the *sweet nectar* (甘液) of the *Upper Field*\nto flow into the *Lower Elixir Field* (下丹田) and generate *qi*,\nso when one extracts the *qi* of the *Elixir Field*,\nit is the *Great State* descending to take it.\nOr, when the *Elixir Field*’s *qi* ascends in reverse to the *Heavenly Valley* (天谷) to generate *essence-liquid*,\nthen swallowing the *Heavenly Valley*’s *qi*\nis the *Small State* descending to take it.\n\nThis is the *golden essence* and *kidney-yang* ascending,\n*lead-qi* merging with marrow,\n*essence* condensing and *qi* harmonizing—\nin a moment’s breath, transforming into *sweet dew* (甘露) *divine water* (神水),\nflowing to the *upper palate* (上腭),\ndropping and returning to its source—\nthe moment when *essence-liquid* transforms into *qi*.\n\nWhen the *qi-mechanism* (气机) is fully robust,\nonce more the *River Vehicle* is operated,\ndirecting it upward to *Kūnlún*,\nswallowing the *marrow-essence* (髓精) of the *Brain Sea* (脑海),\nand descending it into the *Yellow Court*—\nthis is the moment when *qi* transforms into *essence-liquid*.\n\nYet the *Great State*’s *“descending flow”* (下流)\nis through *gentleness* and *stillness*,\nrestful and capacious—\ntruly possessing *virtue* beyond that of ordinary people,\nthis is the *spirit* transforming *qi* while *qi* refines *essence*,\nfilling the *Elixir Field* with abundance.\n\nThus, there is one who seeks to *accumulate the virtue of others* (畜人之德),\nand the *Small State* also has *inner clarity* (内朗) *wisdom* (之智),\nknowing its own *power* cannot rival the *Great*—\nwillingly submitting in homage and obedience,\ntruly possessing *magnanimity* beyond that of ordinary people.\nThis is when *essence* generates *qi*, *qi* generates *spirit*,\nand all returns in dependence to the *Yellow Court*.\n\nThus, there is also the *Dao* of *entering to serve others*.\nBoth seek the same goal without external attachment,\nso the *elixir* completes its *nine transformations* (九转),\nthe *Way* ascends to the *Nine Heavens* (九天),\nand one abides eternally with *Heaven and Earth* in shared longevity.\n\nHow does their *virtue* intermingle and return?\nThe supreme secret of refining the body\nlies nowhere beyond this—\nthose who attain it should treasure it,\nand not reveal it lightly.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two: The Dao as the Most Precious for All Under Heaven**\nThe *Dao* is the *mystery* of all things,\na treasure for the *virtuous* and a safeguard for the unvirtuous.\n*Beautiful speech* can be traded,\n*noble conduct* can elevate one’s standing.\nSince people are unvirtuous,\nwhy should they be abandoned?\n\nThus, the *sacrificial altar* (社) and the *three ministers* (三公) are established for the *Son of Heaven*,\nthough there are *arching walls* to precede the *four steeds* (先驷马),\nnothing compares to sitting and advancing this *Dao*.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this *Dao* as most precious?\nIs it not to *seek and obtain* it,\nto *avoid blame* through its practice?\n\nThus, it is the most precious for all under Heaven.\nThe *Great Dao* arises before *Heaven and Earth*,\nmingles within *emptiness and non-being*,\nfaint and obscure—\nunseen, unheard, untouched—\nyet truly the foundation upon which all things depend for their existence.\n\n*Master Zǐsī* (子思子) said:\n*“The *Way* of the *virtuous* is costly yet hidden.”*\nWithout *Dao*, there is no thing;\nwithout thing, there is no *Dao*.\nFrom the *Great Cycle* (大周) to the *sand boundary* (沙界),\ndown to the finest *dust-mote* (微尘),\nit cannot be sought through *traces or symbols*,\nnor exhausted through *words or speech*.\nTruly, it contains the *ultimate* without and the *ultimate* with,\nthe *ultimate* emptiness and the *ultimate* reality—\nvast and boundless, profound and unfathomable.\nNo mystery surpasses this.\n\nThe *virtuous* know this *Dao* is the most vital for the human body,\nso they cherish and conceal it,\ncultivate and treasure it,\nnever willing to part with it even for a moment.\nThe unvirtuous also know there is a *Dao*—\npracticing it preserves the body and brings *blessings* (福),\nwhile abandoning it shortens life and invites *calamity* (祸).\nNo better strategy exists for safeguarding the body.\n\nMoreover, when this *Dao* of *Middle Way* (中庸) is expressed in *speech*,\nit becomes *beautiful speech*—\nlike precious goods sold in the marketplace,\nall know to love and admire it,\nand wish to touch and possess it.\nWhen this *Dao* of *ordinary* (寻常) *Way* is seen in *conduct*,\nit becomes *noble conduct*—\nlike the *status* of a *great lord* or *eminent official*,\nall respect and honor it,\nand seek to elevate and exalt it.\nIf it cannot be expressed in *speech*,\nthen trading in it only invites *humiliation*;\nif it cannot be demonstrated in *conduct*,\nthen offering it only invites *slander*.\n\nThe *Classic of Poetry* (《诗》) says:\n*“Heaven nurtures the common people,\nendowing them with things and principles.\nThe people’s inherent nature,\nloves this *virtue* of *goodness* (懿德).”*\nThis shows that though *virtue* and *vice* differ,\nthe heart’s love for *virtue* remains the same.\n\nWhen I see one who is *virtuous*,\nI revere them.\nIf I see one who is unvirtuous,\nwhy should I despise them?\nIt is merely the *qi* and *nature* (气质) of their disposition\nor the *desires* (物欲) yet unrefined,\nthat cause them to stray from the *Dao*.\nYet their origin is ultimately no different.\n\nIf one can *transform* and *guide* them,\neven the most wicked person\nmay turn toward *virtue*.\nGreat indeed is the *Dao*’s power—\n*Heaven and Earth* abandon no thing,\nthe *sage* abandons no person.\n\nIf one abandons a person,\nit is self-abandonment—\nhow could the *Dao* permit such a thing?\n\n*Heaven* creates the people and establishes their *rulers*,\nmaking them *teachers* as well,\nso that they may govern all under Heaven\nand place the *three ministers* in order—\nthis is to *harmonize and guide* the *people*,\nto *transform and lead* the *multitudes*.\n\nTo *rectify* one’s own body\nis to *rectify* the court;\nto *rectify* the court\nis to *rectify* all under

the Great Harmony,\"*\nand also:\n*\"The *Dao* is the Void of Non-being.\"*\n\nThus, it is clear that those who study the *Dao*\nyet fail to grasp the principle of *Void* and *Non-being*,\neven if they refine essence and subdue *qi*,\nor meditate in *non-duality*,\nshall remain no different from the common folk.\n\nTherefore, in cultivating the *Dao* and forging the elixir,\none must take the *Original Spirit* as the master,\nthe *Original Qi* as the assistant to the spirit,\nand *True Breathing* as the means to refine the elixir.\n\nWithout the *Original Spirit*,\nthere is no foundation for the elixir;\nwithout the *Original Qi*,\nthere is no aid for the elixir.\n\nThis is like a womb containing an infant—\nwithout the union of the father’s essence and the mother’s blood,\nit remains empty and without substance.\n\nHaving obtained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,\nwithout *True Breathing* to govern them,\nthe spirit and *qi* cannot coalesce in unity,\nmerge into one,\nand return to the pristine origin of *Great Simplicity*.\n\nI further impart this truth:\nWhen mortals cultivate and refine,\nhaving gained the *Original Spirit* and *Original Qi*,\nand mastered *True Breathing*,\nthey must gather the five into clusters of four,\nand merge the three into one—\nyet without *True Intent* as their guiding commander,\nthe *qi* and spirit shall scatter and disperse,\nand the elixir shall never form of its own accord.\n\nBut whence does *True Intent* arise?\nIt must emerge from the state of *Void* and *stillness*,\nof *ignorance* and *unawareness*—\nwhen suddenly, the *qi*-mechanism is touched,\nand awareness begins,\nthis is the *True Intent*,\nnot the same as the ordinary mind or intent.\n\nThus the ancients said:\n*\"Sainthood is not attained by others—*\n*only by those who cultivate this true nature.\"*\n\nYet without drawing *qi* from *water* and *essence*,\nas resources and assistance,\neven the innate true nature shall hang suspended and empty,\nand risk falling into the *coarse void*.\n\nHaving known the birth of the *golden elixir*,\nwithout *True Breathing* to regulate and nurture it,\nhow could one gather and refine it into the elixir?\n\nThus, *True Breathing* is the essential tool for forging the elixir,\nand *True Intent* is the sovereign ruler of *True Breathing*.\n\nThose who study the *Dao* yet fail to unite spirit and *qi*,\nhow could they attain *stillness*?\n\nIf one attains the return of spirit and *qi*,\nthey must ferment and nurture deeply—\nonly then shall the *golden elixir* be fully realized.\n\nDo not stir the *Bright Awareness* of the ordinary mind,\nlest the *golden elixir* and *wood elixir* be separated,\nand the *Kan* and *Li* fail to interact.\n\nThrough this, I illuminate the mysteries of the *Dao*—\nlater scholars who gain insight from it\nmust treasure and guard it carefully!\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three: The Great as Non-action, the Non-action as Action**\n\nThe great is *non-action*,\nthe

      "translated_text": "「To treat things by returning them to their nature,\nand to govern people by aligning with their own *Dao*,\nis to respond with greatness and smallness, abundance and scarcity—\nall movements follow the natural order of Heaven,\neach action is the *Dao*,\neverywhere without distinction,\nyet never conflicting with oneself,\nnor ever clashing with others.\n\nAh, this is the *Dao* most difficult yet most simple,\nmost vast yet most minute.\n\nYet how many practitioners in the world\nseek quick results and immediate gains,\noften embracing what is difficult,\nand favoring what is grand,\nwithout knowing that difficulty arises from simplicity,\nand grandeur stems from the minute.\n\nThus, all great undertakings in the world\nmust begin with the small.\n\nSince the *Dao* is the root of all things,\nhow could one not proceed from ease to difficulty,\nfrom minute to vast?\n\nOtherwise, those who advance too swiftly\nshall retreat just as quickly—\nhow then could they hope to reach the realm of divine transformation?\n\nTherefore, the ancient sages knew\nthat the *Dao* has stages to traverse,\nand learning has steps to ascend,\nyet they did not ponder grand schemes,\nonly striving for the immediate essence.\nThey refined what was coarse,\nnurtured the fundamental source,\nlike water permeating plants—\nnaturally changing day by day,\ntransforming month by month,\nnot seen to grow yet ever growing.\n\nThus, from the subtle beginnings,\nfrom the crude to the refined,\nthey moved from *action* and *doing*\nto *non-action* and *actionless action*,\never more plain yet ever more profound,\never closer yet ever more distant,\nuntil they attained the realm of supreme beauty.\n\nThe sage never seeks the grand,\nand thus achieves the grand.\n\nNowadays, scholars at their outset\naspire to become immortals,\nthe more ambitious their hearts,\nthe more difficult their tasks—\nand so many falter halfway through.\n\nOnly through steadfast endurance,\nwith unwavering resolve,\ncan the difficult become easy,\nthe minute remain minute,\nand the grand be made small.\n\nI urge scholars to embrace difficulty in simplicity,\nto attain grandeur through the minute,\nto proceed with measured caution and maturity,\nand thus avoid recklessness and superficiality.\n\nOtherwise, not only will they fail to grasp the *Dao*’s profundity,\nbut they must cultivate sincerity and depth of heart to ever succeed—\nfor those who treat oaths lightly shall lack trust,\nand their regrets shall only deepen;\nthose who rush to inner cultivation,\nfavoring ease, shall often face great difficulty,\nand retreat shall follow swiftly.\n\nSuch is the inevitable course of things.\n\nThus, the sage’s initial cultivation,\nthough rooted in ease and the minute,\nis marked by ceaseless diligence,\nunceasing caution—\nfor the heart’s work is never truly finished.\n\nOnly by first confronting difficulty,\nthen guiding it like a boat on flowing water,\ndoing without *doing*,\ndoes one arrive at “no difficulty at all.”\n\nThese three lines on *“non-action”*\nare the essence of pure, natural effort.\nWhat follows—embracing difficulty in simplicity—\nis the intention of seeking profound refinement through gradual approach.\n\nAs for the *Dan* method,\nwhen speaking of *lead* and *mercury*,\nwhat are they truly?\n\nLet me clarify:\nThese substances are none other than the two poles of *yin* and *yang*.\nWhen *mercury* is paired with *lead*,\nit is as if *yin* is joined with *yang*—\nafter their union, primordial *qi* emerges,\nthen this *qi* is merged with *yin qi* in the central palace,\nand thus the *elixir* is formed.\n\nIn the *Post-Heaven* realm,\n*Li* is the pure *yang* of *Qian* (☰),\n*Kan* is the pure *yin* of *Kun* (☷).\nWith the movement of *qi*,\nthe *Qian*’s central line enters *Kun*,\nand the *Kun*’s central line enters *Qian*’s cavity—\n*Qian* then becomes *Void* as *Li*,\nand *Kun* becomes *full* as *Kan*.\n\nThus, though *Qian* is *yang* and contains *yin*,\nand *Kun* is *yin* yet holds *yang*,\nthey are no longer the pristine *yin-yang* of the *Taiji*’s undifferentiated unity.\nYet they remain fundamentally true.\n\nIn time, the *spirit* generates *jing*,\nand the *qi* transforms into *blood*—\nfrom here, the nature of *qi* and *blood*,\nand the destiny of *life-force* (*qi-shù*), emerge.\n\nFor those with thinking, perceiving minds,\nand bodies of *qi*, *blood*, and form,\nthey are unlike the original *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nThe adept uses method to draw forth\nthe *Li*’s single point of *self-mercury* (for *mercury* is the fluid of the heart,\nthough fluid belongs to *yin*,\nit arises from *Li*’s fire and carries its nature),\nand sends it down into the *Kan* palace,\nto warm the *Kan* palace’s single point of *yin blood* (for *blood* is the water of *Kan*,\nthough water belongs to *yang*,\nit is born from *Kan*’s water and is truly a cold substance)—\nas the ancients said:\n*“Fire enters the water domain,”*\n*“Spirit enters the realm of qi.”*\n\nJust as ice hardens when it meets fire,\nor as embers heat a pot,\nthe *yang qi* naturally warms,\ngiving rise to a pulsating *yin qi* current.\n\nAlthough, when fire enters water,\nit is like adding embers to a pot’s base,\nsteaming heat ascends vigorously—\nthis is the birth of true *lead*.\n\nThrough the adept’s *spirit*,\nthe *yang qi* rises upward to the *nirvana marrow* (for governance alone),\nas if baking wine in a heated pot—\nthe rising vapor is drawn by fire into the celestial vessel,\nthen condenses as dew dripping into the jar (this is what our teaching calls *“true mercury,”*\nand also *“the busy messenger from the Northern Sea’s first tide,\nnourishing the ancient tree’s roots in the Eastern Mountain”*—\nfor it is merely *qi* transformed into fluid).\n\nThen, returning to the furnace for warmth and cultivation,\nthe fluid again becomes *qi*,\ncycling endlessly—\nascending and descending,\nuntil the body’s *qi* and *blood* are exhausted,\nthe *yin qi* stripped away,\nand the mortal form is transmuted into a *golden body*,\nthe turbid essence into a *Qian* essence,\nreverting to the original *Taiji*’s *Void*—\nthe *Dharma-body* of neither birth nor death.\n\nJia Yuanxu once said:\n*“When speaking of *Kan* and *Li*,\nthe *lead* and *mercury* within the body,\nare both ordinary *lead*—\nonly when *Kan* and *Li* unite,\ndo true *yin* and true *yang* converge,\nand a single point of true *yang* emerge,\ndoes one attain the primordial true *lead* seed.\n\nYet without a master’s oral instructions,\neven if one forcibly restrains it,\none can only solidify the *color-body* (*sèshēn*),\nand when the lower *dantian* is filled and strengthened,\nit shall inevitably leak and collapse.\n\nScholars who attain this *yang* generation\nhave only completed half the work—\nhow could they hope to form the embryo and achieve sainthood?\n\nOnly by drawing this *yang qi* upward,\nmerging it with the body’s *yin jing*,\nand further combining it with the *spirit marrow* (*shénsuí*)\nand *essence fluid* (*língyè*) of the *nirvana marrow* and *vermilion palace*—\nthis is truly *“the Eastern Neighbor’s daughter (wood-mercury),\nand the Western Neighbor’s son (gold-lead),\nuniting as husband and wife in the chamber.”*」",

emerge,\nand instantly witness their surrender—\nto govern before chaos arises,\nhow effortless the method must be!\n\nThis work of refining oneself is still easily achieved.\nBut to perfect the nine transformations,\ntime cannot be measured in mere years and months.\n\nHow many are the common, aimless folk\nwho fail to grasp the Dao as the grand Way of Heaven and Earth,\nand humanity as the true Sage of the cosmos!\nSome encounter a dharma assembly by chance\nand attain fulfillment in a single lifetime;\nothers lack the right conditions,\nand require countless lifetimes before success.\nSome repeatedly cultivate, meet fortunate circumstances,\nyet their virtue remains incomplete—\ntheir nature flawed, their disposition perverse—\nthey nearly attain but then fail,\nand fail so utterly that they never succeed.\n\nHow profound the mysteries of the Great Dao!\nFew truly comprehend its ways.\n\nLet us observe how things come to fruition:\nA tree of embrace,\nwhen first born, is but a slender sprout—\nthrough the gentle nurture of yin and yang,\nchanging daily and monthly,\nit grows into a mighty tree.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nwhen first raised,\nis merely a pile of earth—\nthrough human labor, gathering and refining,\never new and ever flourishing,\nit suddenly becomes a lofty tower.\nOr consider the unification of mountains and rivers,\nthe thousand-li journey to traverse a

unshaken;\nthough seasons may change,\ntheir diligence knows no variation.\nThus, from small to great,\nfrom low to high,\nfrom near to distant—\nlike the embrace of a mighty tree,\nthe rise of a

age,\nBut since the sun has no will, it ever shines bright.\"*\nIs this not the truth?\n\nThus, the ancient sages\nrefined the supreme Dao,\nmarvelously following nature’s course.\nThey acted without acting—\nno failure in their deeds;\nthey grasped without grasping—\nno loss in their virtue.\n\nYet today’s seekers of the Dao\nmistake *non-action* for action,\nsometimes practicing, sometimes abandoning—\nthey do not know when to move or when to rest,\nwhen to align with the natural flow.\nTheir dynamic and stillness often falter,\nfar from the ancient path.\nSome nearly succeed but then collapse,\nand once fallen, never rise again.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Be cautious in its end,\nfor its beginning is all.\"*\nThus it endures through countless ages without replacement.\n\nAs for rare treasures,\nall men hold them dear—\nthe sage blends with the world,\nhis light undimmed,\nyet he seeks the Dao, not wealth.\nAt first, he does not know\nsuch preciousness exists in human affairs,\nso he does not value it—\nhis detachment is thus clear.\n\nIn matters of sight, hearing, speech, and movement,\nin daily actions and common affairs—\nthose who abandon restraint and stray beyond bounds\nneed not be spoken of.\nEven among those who seek the Dao,\nsome cling to emptiness, some to substance,\nsome grasp when they should not, some hold back when they should—\nall are errors.\n\nNow I alone follow the ancient path,\nembrace the old Way,\nand express my own views—\nnot to claim my words are lofty,\nbut to weigh the Dao’s measure.\n\nI think the Dao

hearts of men,\ndeepening their avarice and vulgarity daily,\nand rendering customs ever more deceitful.\n\nThe ruin of these people’s moral standards and rites,\ntheir lawbreaking and transgression of regulations,\ntheir disregard for death—\nsuch cases are countless and difficult to enumerate.\n\nAll stem from those who extol talent and favor acute intelligence,\nstriving to gain falsehood,\nwhile even the simple among the people indulge in guile.\nThe people’s innate purity has been pierced through,\ndeceit and cunning abound,\nyet in their ceaseless bustle,\none deceives while another fears,\nand those in authority find governance beyond their capacity.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"To rule a nation with cleverness is to make it a thief;\nto rule without cleverness is to bring it fortune.\"*\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause when the people acquire knowledge,\ntheir primordial simplicity is already shattered.\nIf they remain in ignorance, unaware,\nthen their original purity endures intact.\n\nThese two paths—cleverness and simplicity—diverge,\nand their benefits and harms are starkly contrasted.\nRather than value cleverness and invite harm,\nwhy not embrace simplicity and reap its gains?\n\nUnderstanding these two principles\nis not only true for governing the world—\nit applies equally to cultivating oneself,\nserving as a model to follow.\n\nTo grasp this model\nis to approach the Dao.\n\nGreat cultivators,\neven when they see and hear nothing,\nreturn to the state of no thought, no care—\nthe divine essence of pure stillness.\nThis cannot be achieved\nby merely closing ears and eyes,\nor by suppressing acute intelligence,\nbut only through attaining true equanimity.\n\nIf even a single thread of calculation or scheming arises,\nthe original purity is lost,\nand the harmony of simplicity is ruined.\n\nKnowing that cleverness harms oneself,\nwhile simplicity benefits the body,\none should not flaunt their cleverness,\nbut delight in preserving their simplicity—\nthis is what is called the *Mysterious Virtue* (玄德).\n\nAll that can be named is not the *Mysterious Virtue*;\nonly that which cannot be named,\nprofound and boundless,\nfar-reaching and unfathomable,\ncan be called the *Mysterious Virtue*.\n\nThough it shares with flying and creeping things,\nand with the sluggish and dull,\nthe quality of having no desires, no knowledge,\nyet these creatures cannot grasp the threads of their origins,\nliving in perpetual darkness and confusion.\n\nMan alone,\nfrom coarse to refined,\nfrom origin to conclusion,\nmay reach the unity of the Three Primordials (三元),\nreturning the Great Ultimate (太极) to its original state (归真),\nand still attain divine transformation—\nhow could this not be contrary to things?\n\nIn governing a nation, cleverness is not valued,\nbut in cultivating the Dao, simplicity is all the more precious.\nFor cleverness is indeed the thief of a nation,\nwhile simplicity is the seed of the Dao.\n\nCan simplicity truly be the seed of the Dao?\nConsider the state of *Hun Dun* (混沌),\nwhere there is no thought, no care,\nno knowledge—\nis this not what is called simplicity?\n\nSuddenly, one awakens—\nthis is the unborn, unending essence of *I* (我).\nNone should claim to retain this awakening,\nto cultivate the supreme and perfect enlightenment (無上正等正覺),\nfor only then can one escape the cycle of rebirth,\navoid the forging of yin and yang (陰陽鼓鑄),\nand not be ensnared by ghosts and spirits (鬼神拘執).\n\nEven within the *Hun Dun* state,\nwhen one suddenly awakens—\nif I guard this true essence without letting it disperse,\nthis single awakening has already reached *Prajñāpāramitā* (般若波羅蜜).\n\nIf one steadfastly upholds and constantly guards it,\nthe seeds of rebirth will be severed here.\n\nIf another thought or perception arises,\nit is the post-natal *desire-knowledge* (後天識欲之神) mingling within,\nas the saying goes:\n*\"Countless movements bring forth the root of birth and death,\nThe foolish call it the original man.\"* (無量動來生死本，痴人唤作本来人)\n\nIn essence,\nthe divine essence is singular,\nbut desire makes it dual.\n\nDual thoughts and triple minds\nare the defiled roots and dust—\nthe cause of birth and death.\n\nOnly with one heart,\nno dual thoughts,\nhaving right awareness (正念),\nand no deluded mind (妄心),\nis the Dao found.\n\nIf one can dissolve even this single heart and right awareness,\nit is the Great Ultimate returning to the Non-Ultimate (太極還於無極),\nand the formation of the *Jin Xian* (金仙) lies within this refining of the void (炼虚).\n\nWhat is *refining of the void* (炼虚)?\nIt is like the state of *Hun Dun*,\nconfused and befuddled,\nas if in simplicity or drunkenness,\nhaving no knowledge, no awareness—\nthis is the void.\n\nWhen seated meditation reaches the stage of no person, no self,\nno place, no sky,\nthis too is refining of the void.\n\nIt is also said:\nThe essentials of learning the Dao\nbegin with forgetting the self,\nproceed to forgetting others,\nand end with forgetting the Dao itself—\nuntil one reaches the extreme of forgetting-forgetting,\nthis is the ultimate attainment.\n\nIf one can take this single moment as their master,\nand use true awakening as their means,\nthe Dao is not far.\n\nYet though the method of refining the void is thus,\nits practice must begin with refining the nature (炼性).\nThe ancients named refining the nature *casting the mirror* (鑄鏡).\n\nIf the mind is not refined,\none remains dim and unaware,\neven if the truth is right before their eyes—\nhow much more so for those who possess the Six Perfections (六通)?\n\nIf the heart is still clouded by private desires,\nit has not yet reached the void.\n\nAs in the state after true awakening,\none must not allow even a thread or speck of desire to remain in the chest—\nthen the *Ling Tai* (靈台) mirror’s treasure\nwill always shine brightly,\nthough not necessarily in full attainment,\nbut in a radiant gleam.\n\nEven within the *Hun Dun* state,\nwhen one suddenly knows—\nknowing nothing else—\nsuddenly awakens—\nawakening to nothing more—\nthis single moment reveals boundless clarity,\nilluminating all four directions without obstruction.\n\nHowever,\na student filled with private desires\ncannot suddenly become pure and transparent,\nlike jade or gold.\nHow could this be achieved\nby a mere moment of emptiness?\n\nOne must first forge the *female* and *male blades* (雌雄二劍),\nto eliminate both the visible and invisible demons (魔).\n\nIf these blades are not sharp,\nthe demons of desire (欲魔),\nform (色魔),\nheaven (天魔),\nand man (人魔)\ncannot be swept away and thoroughly purified,\nrevealing the true face of the Primordial (乾元).\n\nFor human desires and heavenly principles (天理)\nhave long been entangled;\nthough one seeks to stand alone in the stream,\nthe forces opposing them are too great.\n\nThus, though they know the truth,\nthey still tread upon it—\nfor those who lead them into human desires are many,\nwhile those who guide them toward heavenly principles are few.\n\nNow I tell the students:\nTo perfect the pure *Dharma-body* (法身),\none must first have a pure *divine essence* (神);\nTo obtain a pure *divine essence*,\none must cultivate boundless *qi* (氣).\n\nWhat is called *casting the blades* (鑄劍) has no other means—\nit is by nurturing the *qi* of the early

teachings, commands, and matters\nwere sought from ministers and neighbors,\nnever exalting his own wisdom.\nThis is why the more he humbles himself,\nthe more others elevate him.\n\nTo lead others, he must place himself behind them,\nas Yu, Gao, and Yi did—\nthough they were enlightened first,\nthey always yielded precedence to others,\nplacing themselves last.\nThis is why the more he retreats,\nthe more others advance.\n\nBecause he positions himself below and behind,\neven as emperor, he lacks the terror of authority,\nand thus is not feared.\nThough he governs the divine and human,\nhe lacks the harshness of domination,\nand thus does not harm others.\nTherefore, all under heaven willingly follow him as their leader,\nwith no resentment.\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"There is no blame in him,\nnor in me any fault.\nMay we thus, night and day,\nperpetuate our good name.\"*\n\nWhat else is this but this?\nBecause he does not contend for superiority or precedence,\nothers naturally place him above and before him.\nThey submit to his teachings, revere his spirit,\nand endlessly receive his grace and virtue—\nhow could they then dare to contend for superiority or precedence,\nand rival the Sage in competition?\n\nThis is the analogy for elixir cultivation:\nfirst, the divine fire descends into the elixir field,\nthen the fire steams and the water boils,\nand from the depths of the water, gold is born—\nonly then does the elixir of longevity begin to manifest.\n\nHumans receive the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth to live,\noriginally complete and whole.\nYet after birth, *qi* and constitution constrain them,\nand desires obscure them,\nso that the original *qi* of Heaven\nis scattered and dissipated throughout the body’s stale *qi*,\nunable to gather in one place for long.\n\nNow, to converge the Five Phases,\nharmonize the Four Symbols,\nunite them in the central palace,\nand return them to the mysterious orifice—\none must first release all entanglements,\nallow no private thoughts to arise,\nclose the eyes and seal the mouth,\nso that the eyes see through the nose,\nthe nose faces the navel,\nand the heart-fire descends into the elixir field—\nin but a moment, the mysterious pass opens,\none *yang* revives,\nand the *qi* of the whole body\nnaturally gathers in the elixir field,\nfusing and flowing freely,\na joy beyond words.\n\nYet at the outset of observation,\nif the fire is not intense, the gold will not emerge from the ore;\nif the fire is too fierce, it will scorch the essence and blood,\nstifling the vital spark.\nOnly when it is neither clinging nor detached,\nneither present nor absent,\ndoes the *qi* of the elixir field leap with restless energy.\n\nThis is like the rivers and seas receiving all

endure.\n\nNow, if one abandons **compassion** for **courage**,\n**frugality** for **breadth**,\nand **not daring to lead** for **leading ahead**,\nthen one is already dead.\n\nFor **compassion**—\nwhen wielded in battle, it wins;\nwhen used in defense, it holds firm.\nWhen **Heaven** intends to save a man,\nit shields him with **compassion**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is fundamentally **Limitless** (*Wújí*), yet it is also the **Great Ultimate** (*Tàijí*).\nNeither great nor small,\nneither great nor small—\nit is both great and small at once.\n\nThere are indeed words that no thought or speculation can exhaust.\nIf one insists on calling it \"great,\"\nthen it is *\"the boundless and mighty **Harmonious Qi** (*Hàorán qì*),*\n*filling the space between Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nIf one seeks to describe it as \"small,\"\nthen it is *\"the nameless **embryo** (*pǔ*),*\n*most subtle and minute,*\n*hidden in the boundless expanse.\"*\n\nIn man,\nits possession means life,\nits loss means death.\n\nAll arise from the **Limitless** yet take form,\nfrom the **invisible** yet manifest.\nTruly, the small is its origin,\nwhile the great is its unfolding.\n\nIt is better to speak of the small to reveal the **Dao/Way**,\nthan to speak of the great to explain it.\n\nThus the **Taoist Sage** says:\n*\"All under heaven call me great.\"*\n\nFor **\"I\"** is the **Dao/Way** itself.\nThe **Dao/Way** has no fixed form or body;\nyet when called \"great,\"\nit seems to have a form and body that can be likened—\nthis does not truly resemble the **Dao/Way**.\n\nIf one wishes to embody **Heaven’s Dao/Way**,\nand resemble the Sage’s form,\nfrom the opening of **Heaven** to the present day,\nthose who have established **Heaven’s polarity** (*Lìjí*) and expounded the **Dao/Way** and its teachings—\nfor ages now,\nthey have all relied on the **Limitless** as the **Ultimate**,\nthe **unmanifest** as the **manifest**,\nthe most subtle and minute as the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet how can one practice the **Dao/Way** when it is **soundless and odorless** (*wúshēng wúchòu*),\nflickering and indistinct?\nHow can the student begin?\n\nThe **Taoist Sage** says:\n*\"I possess the **Three Treasures**,\nand cling to them in safeguarding.\"*\n\nIf one holds them steadfastly without loss,\ntreasures them as precious,\nnever forgetting them in each

**benevolence** (*rén*) itself.\n**Benevolence** and **compassion**, gentle and pervasive,\nare the **elemental principle** (*yuán*) of **Heaven**.\nThe gentleman embodies **benevolence**,\nand this suffices to nurture all men.\n\nMoreover, it encompasses the **Four Beginnings** (*Sì Duān*),\nand includes all **virtues** (*shàn*).\n**Benevolence** is within it—\nthen the **Dao/Way** is within it.\nFilling and exhausting it,\nit can embrace **Heaven and Earth**,\nand permeate **ancient and modern**.\n\nThis is the **foundation of the Golden Elixir** (*Jīndān zhī běn*),\nand the adept must cherish and remember it.\n\nYet its **Dao/Way** extends to the utmost greatness,\nwhile its **root** (*míng*) ascends from the utmost subtlety.\nIf one does not know to **forget all thoughts** (*wànniàn jū wàng*),\nand **illuminate the inner essence** (*yīlíng nèizhào*),\nbut instead merely pursues breadth and becomes dissipated,\nseeks vastness and wanders aimlessly,\nthen one will gain nothing of **benevolence**,\nand nothing of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nOnly when one **inverts and seeks within oneself** (*fǎnqiú*),\nand **steadfastly guards the heart** (*dǔshǒu zhū xīn*),\ndoes one establish oneself while also establishing others,\nand reach fulfillment while also fulfilling others.\nGuarding the narrow yet applying the broad—\nthis is what the ancients called **\"obtaining one, all things are accomplished\"** (*dé yī wànshì bì*),\nis it not the essence of **frugality** (*jiǎn*)?\n\nFor **frugality** is the means to seek **benevolence**,\nand the key to cultivating the **Dao/Way**.\nThe student, having known **compassion**,\nmust further nourish it with **frugality**,\nthen alone may he align with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nYet if one exalts himself in pride,\nand magnifies his own greatness,\nwithout the measure of humility and modesty,\nthen within he knows only himself,\nand without he scorns all others.\nHe boasts of his cleverness,\nand arrogantly proclaims his wisdom,\ntruly believing he is the first to awaken and harmonize—\noften he regards all under heaven as incapable of surpassing him.\n\nIn the end,\nhis nature is not **serene and

of the Dao/Way** (*jiǔ tiān dǎojí*)—\nthis is indeed difficult.\n\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The essential key to refining the elixir*\n*is to take **awakened awareness** (*língjué*) as the **Dao/Way’s

      "translated_text": "The cultivation of the elixir—what else is it?\nIt is nothing but nurturing this compassion.\n\nWhat is compassion?\nWhen the King of Qi sees a cow trembling and cannot bear it,\nWhen a villager sees a weak child fall into a well and feels distress—\nThese are the stirrings of the heart of virtue,\nThe return of the Heavenly heart.\n\nReflecting on this, such impulses and thoughts arise without ceasing—\nOnly fear that people fail to perceive them.\n\nThe scholar, from the spontaneous movement of true nature,\nExpands and acts, thereby establishing a foundation for elixir cultivation.\nYet one must not seek breadth at the cost of neglect,\nBut rather adhere to restraint and subtlety.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, wholehearted sincerity—\nThe ancients said:\n*\"The heart must dwell within the chest,\nLest thoughts stray through the gate of totality.\"*\n\nThus, the more restrained, the broader;\nThe more subtle, the more manifest.\nThe more precise the restraint,\nThe wider the unfolding.\n\nHow can the scholar not take frugality as the root?\nThough frugality is a virtue of the mind,\nIt is indeed a fine method to avoid excess through restraint.\nYet if not tempered with humility and gentleness,\nOne risks the violent nature igniting and harming the elixir.\nThus, restraint must be paired with utmost harmony—\nIn all things, humility and self-effacement,\nNever presuming to lead—\nThis is the way of emptying oneself for others.\n\nWhen the heart of virtue endures,\nThe Dao-qi endures as well.\n\nIf one values courage over compassion,\nSeeks abundance over frugality,\nAnd places oneself before others,\nThen the heart is merely ordinary.\nHow could one expect to hold the Three Treasures without loss?\n\nMoreover, when a person possesses compassion,\nIt is most effective in winning others’ favor—\nIn battle, victory is assured;\nIn defense, the city stands firm.\nThis is like tending the furnace with fire,\nBurning away the Three Vermin;\nOr guarding the city with ritual purity,\nThus preserving the embryo-spirit and original essence.\n\nThis gentle and harmonious heart\nIs the key to elixir cultivation and Dao-nurturing.\n\nHeaven, in creating man,\nEndows him with life and, without fail, with compassion.\nIf one can constantly reflect and return to virtue,\nThe elixir of eternal life is already within reach.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtue of Non-Contention**\nA true warrior does not rely on brute force,\nA skilled fighter does not rage,\nOne who triumphs over enemies does not contend,\nAnd one who wields people places himself beneath them.\n\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called harnessing others’ strength,\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nThe ultimate of the ancients.\n\n*\"Shì\"* (士) means teacher of the people.\nA teacher of the people wields armies,\nOriginally valuing martial prowess.\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Firm yet yielding, advancing boldly yet following order,\nMighty yet without slaughter.\"*\nThis is wielding force without force—\nThe mark of a true teacher of the people.\n\nWhen facing a great enemy, armies clash,\nTwo forces stand arrayed—\nOne cannot avoid deploying troops,\nBrandishing weapons, charging like rivers,\nTheir roar shaking the heavens.\n\nYet in truth, with few soldiers,\nA sudden onslaught by a mighty foe—\nIt is no difficulty to play music and drive back the invaders,\nOr compose melodies to lift the siege.\nThis is the way of achieving might without anger.\n\nWhen the troops return in triumph, proclaiming victory,\nWhile others boast of their deeds,\nHe alone humbly withdraws—\nSuch a general can stand without shame.\n\nEven if honors are heaped upon him,\nHe remains modest, his face flushed—\nThis is how one who conquers without contention behaves.\n\nThe *Shujing* says:\n*\"You alone do not contend,\nAnd none in the world will contend with your ability.\"*\nIs this not what is meant?\n\nSuch men arise from promoting the old while establishing the new,\nGathering wisdom and broadening benefits,\nNot relying on their own talents,\nBut skillfully using others’ talents as their own;\nNot boasting of their own wisdom,\nBut skillfully using others’ wisdom as their own.\n\nThis is the way of humbling oneself to elevate others—\nIf not for heeding wise counsel,\nConsulting the good path,\nMaintaining an open heart like a valley,\nAnd practicing humble reverence—\nHow could one achieve such mastery of war and victory,\nTurning the world as easily as flipping one’s palm?\n\nThis is the virtue of non-contention,\nBy which one serves the people.\nThis is harnessing others’ strength,\nBy which one commands the world.\nThis is aligning with the people below,\nAnd harmonizing with Heaven above—\nBy which one serves the people’s hearts.\nThis is harnessing others’ strength,\nBy which one commands the world.\nThis is aligning with the people below,\nAnd harmonizing with Heaven above—\nStanding with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishing the ultimate of all ages.\n\nAlas! Without the saint’s utmost sincerity and fulfillment of nature,\nHow could one, amid the chaos of war,\nConceal the winds of peace and courtesy,\nWield force without force,\nAct in anger without anger,\nContend without contention—\nAs described here?\n\nMoreover, ruling with broad tolerance,\nPlanning with deference to others,\nPlacing the worthy in office,\nAnd the capable in their posts—\nThen all under Heaven’s scholars\nWill offer loyalty and sincerity,\nEager to perform deeds and fulfill commands,\nAs if Heaven’s seasons flow without speech,\nAnd all things present their offerings—\nThis is how one aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishes the ultimate.\n\nThe *Shijing* says:\n*\"Reflect on the virtuous Hou Ji,\nWho aligned with Heaven—\nNone but you could achieve this ultimate.\"*\nWithout such a man, to whom shall we turn?\n\nThis speaks of refining the medicine with fire—\nThough there are fierce methods of rapid distillation,\nYet one must act according to the time,\nFollow the natural course,\nWield force without force—\nThus avoiding the peril of overturning the elixir or toppling the cauldron.\n\nEven when the vital breath moves,\nAnd true yang arises—\nMost vast, most strong,\nFilling the two great vessels—\nWhat differs from a warrior’s fierce, overwhelming rage,\nSweeping all before him?\n\nMoreover, when gathering and refining the fire,\nIt is only because the浩然 (*hàorán*) breath expands—\nNot for the sake of strength itself.\nThus, after purification,\nOrdinary bones become jade bones,\nAnd the mortal body transforms into a golden body.\n\nIt is said: *\"Taking the Golden Elixir in the palm,\nOr seizing the world as one picks up a feather.\"*\nOnly when the spirit is both concentrated and effortless,\nAnd breathing is both regulated and unrestrained,\nDoes one purely follow Heaven,\nWithout human interference.\n\nEven when Heaven and man contend,\nAnd reason and desire clash—\nOne must still uphold reason to restrain desire,\nAnd exhaust human effort to merge with Heaven.",

benevolent stand unmatched beneath Heaven.\n\nSuch is the way of humility and yielding,\nOf emptiness and submission to others,\nOf attuning to the ebb and flow of *qi*,\nAnd letting it guide one’s transformation.\n\nTherefore, the elixir’s completion\nHas its unseen yet manifest,\nIts motionless yet ever-changing,\nIts effortless yet inevitable fulfillment.\nWhat differs from a master’s skill in wielding others?\n\nIn cultivating the human *Dao*,\nIf one remains ever at peace,\nEver yielding and compliant,\nDesire needing no suppression to suppress itself,\nReason needing no invocation to arise naturally—\nThis is called the *virtue* of non-contention.\n\nWith a heart of non-contention,\nFollowing principle in action,\nAdapting to circumstances in movement—\nIt is as though using others’ strength\nTo achieve one’s own success,\nYet encompassing Heaven and Earth’s transformations\nWithout overreaching.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"What does Heaven speak?\nThe four seasons proceed therein,\nAll things take life therein.\"*\n\nThe Sage merges with the *Dao* in truth,\nStanding firm as the very threads of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd establishing the ultimate measure for all ages.\n\n**Chapter 69: The Victorious Through Compassion**\nIn warfare, it is said:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends,\nNor advance an inch only to retreat a foot.\"*\nThis is called:\nMoving without movement,\nPushing without arms,\nConquering without force,\nSeizing without weapons.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy risks losing what is most precious.\n\nThus, when armies clash,\nThe compassionate prevail.\n\nAncient strategists spoke of battle tactics:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends.\"*\nThe aggressor is like a sovereign—\nA sovereign’s decrees command absolute authority;\nThe defender is like a minister—\nA minister obeys the sovereign’s will,\nAs in *\"Let the other be the host, I the guest.\"*\n\nThus, if I am the aggressor,\nIt means my post-Heavenly human-heart takes command,\nWhile my pre-Heavenly *Dao*-heart retreats in submission.\nHow dare I let the post-Heavenly human-heart dominate,\nAnd treat it as the guest while relying on it utterly?\n\n*\"I dare not advance an inch only to retreat a foot\"*—\nThis means:\nWhen victorious, even an inch gained must be firmly held;\nWhen defeated, not even a single step may be conceded.\nIf one advances with an inch’s gain\nYet retreats by a foot’s measure,\nIt is to gain little and lose much,\nDifficult to succeed and easy to fail.\n\nIn warfare, this is the mark of an incompetent general;\nIn cultivating the *Dao*, this is the fate of one who achieves nothing.\nHow dare I?\n\nOnly by yielding to the other as host,\nAnd submitting myself as guest,\nDoes the enemy have no advantage to exploit,\nAnd I no vulnerability to attack—\nThus, controlling others without being controlled,\nAvoiding humiliation entirely.\n\nAdvance where opportunity allows,\nRetreat where difficulty arises.\nIn advancing, one must rouse the spirit of boundless momentum;\nIn retreating, one must not present an assailable posture.\nSuch caution, such vigilance—\nAlways yielding precedence to others,\nWhile placing oneself last.\n\nThus, in marching armies,\nIt appears as though others can move while I seem unable;\nYet when I press forward with resolve,\nStretching forth my arms,\nIt seems as though others have arms while I have none.\nWhen facing the enemy in battle,\nWith armies locked in struggle,\nIt seems as though others can resist while I cannot.\n\nThough drums thunder and flags billow,\nThe enemy wields weapons—\nHow could I alone be weaponless?\n\nThus, advancing without recklessness,\nRetreating without haste—\nTruly knowing that the fate of the state,\nThe rise or fall of the nation,\nHangs upon this single battle—\nHow could the enemy be treated lightly?\n\nObserve the ancients who treated the enemy with caution—\nThey often succeeded;\nThose who underestimated the enemy—\nThey invariably failed.\nAs seen in Guan Zi’s campaign against the Yanrong,\nOr Zi Yu’s battle at Chengpu.\n\nMoreover, the prosperity or decline of the court\nDepends on the success or failure of its generals.\nIf one does not approach matters with utmost prudence,\nBoasting of talent or relying on cunning,\nAnd claiming none can surpass them—\nLike Meng Ming’s reckless advance,\nOr Gao Gu’s overconfident charge—\nThere has never been one who did not bring ruin to the state,\nDestruction to the family,\nAnd extinction to the ancestral line.\n\nThe Sage’s greatest treasure is *trust*—\nUnderestimating the enemy betrays the sovereign’s faith.\n\nWhen two armies confront,\nTwo forces clash—\nYet one remains weak and yielding,\nMost compassionate, most benevolent.\nAlways fearing that the *qi* of slaughter\nDisrupts the harmony of Heaven and Earth;\nNever rejoicing in the might of arms\nTo expand territory through conquest.\n\nWarfare on the battlefield\nIs but a last resort.\nThough no weeping follows the army’s retreat,\nThe heart of compassion and pity,\nThe anguish and urgency of grief,\nAlready permeate the encamped troops,\nAnd the three armies are nourished by it,\nWhile the common people respond with gratitude.\n\nThus, the virtuous either do not war,\nOr, if they do, they prevail.\nIs this not because the heart of compassion\nExtends to others,\nAnd enters their very souls?\n\nThis illustrates the birth of true *yang*,\nThe flourishing of *qi*—\nOnly then may the fire be refined and the work proceed.\n\nIf one does not quietly await the *yin* essence’s movement,\nAnd leisurely regulates the ascent and descent,\nThe advance and retreat,\nThe cyclical circulation of spirit—\nThere will be none who do not suffer from errant fire,\nAnd face great humiliation.\n\nAt the four critical junctures,\nOne must await the *kan* *qi*’s spontaneous motion,\nLest *li* presume to dominate.\nThus it is said:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor while the other defends.\"*\n\nIn the *Dao* of cultivation,\nAdvancing brings stability,\nRetreating brings disaster.\nLike Heaven’s ceaseless motion,\nLike water’s unending flow—\nOnly then does one ascend daily without halt.\nIf one proceeds intermittently,\nNow pushing, now neglecting—\nOne step forward, ten steps back—\nGaining little, losing much—\nSuccess will never be attained in a lifetime.\n\nThis arises from ignorance of the *Dao* of returning to the root,\nOf restoring one’s true nature—\nA path of daily practice,\nNot to be seized by clever schemes,\nNor achieved through contrived actions.",

profound sorrow for all things,\nDoes one then manifest in peace,\nAnd act with gentle compliance—\nThus does nature yield in all directions,\nAnd every battle is won without struggle.\n\nStudents of the *Dao* must be cautious:\nDo not let the *post-heaven* mind of knowledge dominate,\nWhile the *pre-heaven* primordial *qi* retreats in submission—\nThen perhaps will there be no deviation.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Humble Clothes the Precious Jade**\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet none under Heaven can know them,\nNone can practice them.\n\nWords have a *root* (*宗*),\nAffairs have a *master* (*君*).\nIt is only because of ignorance,\nThat none recognize me.\n\nFew know me—\nThus I am held in esteem.\n\nTherefore, the Sage wears coarse raiment,\nYet harbors the most precious jade.\n\nThe Great *Dao* is the inherent goodness of human nature,\nA matter of daily practice,\nEver near and close—\nOne cannot separate from it for even a moment.\n\nTo separate is to lose the *Dao*,\nTo lose the *Dao* is to lose humanity—\nThen what words are there?\n\nEven if my teachings were piled in millions,\nFilling chests and boxes beyond count,\nYet all are intimately tied to human nature,\nClose to daily practice—\nNone are difficult to know or practice.\n\nSo why is it that none under Heaven can know or practice them?\nIs it because my words are not easy to know or practice?\n\nNo—it is because words have a *root*,\nAnd affairs have a *master*—\nThe *root* being the innate knowledge one does not need to study,\nThe *master* being the innate ability one does not need to learn.\n\nIf one knows the *root* of words,\nThen one draws near from within oneself,\nAnd all words become virtuous speech.\n\nIf one knows the *master* of affairs,\nThen one silently observes their hidden essence,\nAnd all actions become virtuous deeds.\n\nThe *Dao* is like a great road—\nHow could it be difficult to know or practice?\n\nTo reflect inwardly and be sincere—\nNo greater joy is there.\n\nIf one does not know that words have a *root*,\nOr that affairs have a *master*,\nAnd instead seeks them in distant and lofty places,\nOr in broad and remote lands—\nThen one indulges in trifles and loses one’s resolve,\nPursues the vast and strays from the essential,\nMakes one’s form a burden,\nAnd one’s nature a chain of *qi*—\nThus does the original virtue of Heaven’s *Dao* grow dim?\n\nEven so,\nTheir knowing me adds nothing to me,\nTheir ignorance harms me not at all.\nFor my being is my own—\nIt does not depend on others’ knowing or ignorance.\n\nFew know me—\nThus my value remains unchanged to me.\n\nTherefore, the Sage dons the most humble rags,\nYet within holds the most noble jade—\nHe obscures his presence in the mountains and forests,\nHides himself in rocky caves—\nOnly to align with the principles of nature and life,\nTo harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s *Dao*,\nAnd to cultivate what lies within himself.\nWhether others recognize or deny him,\nHe cares not in the least.\n\nThis is why the wise grow ever wiser,\nAnd the foolish grow ever more foolish.\n\nThe words of the Supreme Sage (*太上*) are *Dao* in every line,\nAnd every character speaks to the self.\n\nTo speak of *Dao* is to speak of humanity,\nTo speak of humanity is to speak of the *Dao*—\nNothing could be easier than this.\n\nSo why are there those who find it difficult to know or practice?\n\nIt is because the ignorant seek the *Dao* afar,\nYet it lies near—\nThey seek what is easy as difficult,\nAnd what is simple as complex.\n\nThey do not attend to the true and constant *Dao*,\nBut instead chase after dross and remnants—\nLike the study of rhetoric, memorization, legal codes, or divination—\nThe more they learn, the more their minds stray,\nThe more affairs they handle, the more their nature deteriorates.\nNo wonder the words of the Supreme Sage\nAre understood by all in their time,\nYet only the Supreme Sage understands them in later ages.\n\nIt is because they fail to grasp\nThat words have a *root*,\nAnd affairs have a *master*.\n\nThis *root* and *master*—\nThey are the “**middle**” (*中*) of humanity itself.\n\nWhen Yao and Shun passed on the *Dao*,\nIt was nothing but “**Hold fast to this middle**” (*允执厥中*).\n\nLater, the teachings of Confucius on “**purity and unity**” (*纯一*),\nOf the *Zhongyong* on “**solitary vigilance**” (*慎独*),\nAnd of the *Kō* School on “**innate knowledge**” (*良知*),\nAre all but variations of the human “**middle**.”\n\nThis single character “**middle**” (*中*)\nEncompasses much.\n\nWithin humanity, it is twofold:\nOne guards the *middle* of form—\nZhu Xi says: “**Guard the middle to regulate the outside.**”\nTo guard the *middle* is to turn light inward,\nTo focus attention on what is central.\nAt the point one inch below the navel,\nNeither clinging nor rejecting—this is it.\n\nOne guards the *middle* of the formless—\nThe *Zhongyong* says: *“Before joy, anger, sorrow, or delight arise, this is the **middle**.”*\nLuó Cóngyàn taught Lǐ Yánpíng:\n“Observe the *middle* in stillness,\nAnd the phenomena of joy, anger, sorrow, or delight—\nIn this unarisen state,\nNeither heard nor seen,\nWith reverent caution and fear—\nThen nature settles and the mind clears,\nAnd one sees the original face.\nThen human desires grow pure,\nAnd Heaven’s principle shines bright.\nFrom ancient times, sages, immortals, Buddhas,\nAll took this as the first step of practice.\nBut one must first guard the *middle* with strenuous effort,\nAnd finally attain the *middle* in pure nature.”\n\nThe three sages have different names,\nYet all take the “**middle**” (*中*) as their *root*,\nAs their *master*.\n\nEven as I teach,\nConcentrating the mind and harmonizing the breath—\nThen one turns inward to observe the original orifice,\nThe mind devoid of its own mind,\nThe *qi* devoid of its own *qi*—\nOnly then does one achieve peace of mind and harmony of breath.\nPeace of mind brings concentration,\nHarmony of breath brings regulation.\nThe essence lies only in the two words: *peace of mind*.\n\nWhen the mind does not stir—\nThis is *peace*.\nTo hold fast to the *middle*—\nThis is *peace*.\n*Peace* is within this *middle*.」",

      "translated_text": "Now let me unfold the subtleties of the Dao more fully:\n\nIn general, when seated in meditation, one must first depart from the mundane to cultivate *zhì* (定), striking a single resonant note before self-examining and self-verifying. If indeed there is nothing at all—empty and void—then the mind is clarified and nature is seen.\n\nThus I have often said: At the outset of seated stillness, this mind hangs suspended in the boundless void. Only when body and mind are settled, and intention and *qi* harmonized, may one gradually gather and reflect inward upon the original palace.\n\nWhen nothing remains within the chest, and one awakens to this luminous awareness, then the ten directions and three realms are all encompassed within this awakening perception.\n\nYet the nature of awakening neither arises nor perishes—it is simply clear and self-illuminating, as it ever was.\n\nIf one seeks the Mysterious through this, the source becomes utterly pure, and may serve as the foundation for my elixir’s formation.\n\nIn an instant, the innate light naturally manifests.\n\nHow does one recognize this? Within that former state of vague and indistinct perception—when suddenly awakening and moving, this marks the essential beginning of Dao cultivation.\n\nYet to govern emotions with nature—if one does not first uncover the true essence of nature itself, and instead plunges blindly into the watery depths seeking the Mysterious, how can one govern emotions when nature is already lost?\n\nFor there exists a primal, vibrant vitality of the spirit.\n\nKnow that *Lí* (離) does not belong to the mind: when one concentrates auditory resonance, contains visual radiance, restrains the senses of scent, taste, and touch—these are all the workings of divine fire, hence it is called *Lí*.\n\n*Kǎn* (坎) is not *qi*: wherever vital essence resides, that is *Kǎn*.\n\nEven if divine essence enters the blood, and fire heats the waters, this does not necessarily stir *qi*—one must lift from left and right, gathering the waves from the abyssal depths, guiding them upward to the elixir field. Through prolonged refinement, when the fire is sufficient, suddenly the celestial mechanism activates, and the body leaps in ecstasy, from fingertips to every limb, trembling ceaselessly.\n\nThe body stands rigid as a wall, the mind cold as ashes. When the elixir field’s *qi* grows warm, this is the balanced state—neither too hot nor too cool—of the fire’s union.\n\nIf this phenomenon does not appear, the fire is still too weak and must not be applied. If one persists in this state without igniting the fire, the *qi* will already have dissipated by the time one attempts it—this is the peril of aged, useless medicine. Students must discern this carefully.\n\nYet when the subtle yang first stirs, it may not yet produce such vigorous *qi*. As long as the mind is tranquil and intention at ease, and breathing harmonized, one may still practice the *Zi-Wu* (子午) River Vehicle.\n\nFor the body’s formed and substantial blood, unrefined by fire, remains murky and stagnant—a mass of lifeless sludge. Only when divine fire illuminates does a single point of true *qi* emerge within the blood.\n\nThis is as the Buddha said: *\"In this defiled and impure age, I cultivated and attained the fruit of the Dao.\"*\n\nThe ancients also spoke of *\"taking treasure from the ghost’s nest, seeking lead beneath the black mountain\"*—all referring to the same process: within the turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines this single point of true *qi*.\n\nOnce *qi* moves, yang arises. One must then know the laws of *Zi* advancing yang and *Wu* retreating yin, along with the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* (卯酉) bathing, to extract this true yang and circulate it freely. Internally, it dispels the hidden yin of the viscera; externally, it attracts the celestial true yang’s vital *qi*.\n\nWith prolonged practice, even the substance of *qi* transforms.\n\nThis River Vehicle method holds boundless profundity.\n\nThe ancients said, *\"When the *qi* is clear, the Zi-Wu River is drawn and added\"*—drawing refers to extracting lead from the watery depths, adding refers to supplementing mercury from the *Lí* palace.\n\nMercury is the luminous fluid of the mind—the later heaven within the earlier heaven. From the colored body’s turbid essence and decayed blood, divine fire refines it into sweet dew—this is lead, the *qi* within the blood.\n\nThis *qi* is what the ancients called *\"gold within the water\"*—it belongs to the later heaven within the earlier heaven, sufficient only to stabilize the mundane, not to generate the Dharma body.\n\nThis is the medicine produced by the union of *Kǎn* and *Lí*, yet it is still not the true elixir.\n\nOne must govern emotions with nature, return nature to nature, and when nature and emotions harmonize, refine them together in the *Kūn* (坤) furnace. Suddenly, true yang erupts—this is the union of *Qián* (乾) and *Kūn*, and only then does one forge the divine elixir into a true immortal.\n\nIn summary, there is no other method of cultivation—only the ceaseless turning of the River Vehicle.\n\nAt the lower pass, the River must be forced;\nAt the middle pass, the River Vehicle arises from both human and celestial;\nAt the upper pass, the River Vehicle flows purely of its own accord, never failing in its timing.\n\nAs for the methods of *Mǎo-Yǒu* bathing, these are only for beginners lest their minds grow restless and the fire flare unchecked. When one reaches mastery, no methods are needed.\n\nIt all depends on the student’s divine illumination.",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear the **Way**’s **威**\n\nThe people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.\n\nDo not confine their dwelling, do not weary of their birth.\n\nFor it is only through not wearying that one does not weary.\n\nThus, the sage knows himself but does not display himself, loves himself but does not exalt himself.\n\nHence, one discards that and embraces this.\n\nThe **威** spoken of is the grand framework of **纲常名教** (social norms and moral teachings), the most difficult transgression of **天理** (Heavenly Principle).\n\nLet them know to be cautious in solitude, even in bed and shadow,\nTo fear the **威** of Heaven in its hidden subtleties—\nThen naturally, Heaven’s blessings will be pure and abundant,\nAnd their longevity will know no bounds.\n\nThe *Shijing* (Book of Odes) says:\n*\"Fear the **威** of Heaven,\nAnd it will preserve you in due time.\"*\n\nIf the **威** of Heaven looms near like a foot’s length,\nYet one does not remain vigilant and clear each morning,\nIt will lead to the collapse of propriety and the extinction of rites—\nThen Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience) will vanish,\nHeaven’s **天罚** (retribution) will not be spared,\nAnd disasters will not be avoided,\nLife will not be preserved.\n\nThus, the people do not fear the **威**—the **威** has reached its peak.\n\nIf such is the case,\nIt is because they do not know that **知仁** (knowing virtue) is their secure abode,\nYet they abandon this abode and do not dwell within it;\nThat **义** (righteousness) is the source of **生气** (life force),\nYet they forsake this life force and bring ruin upon themselves.\n\nAlas! Those people are unfortunate,\nBorn not into the age of **太古** (Primordial Antiquity),\nWhere **德威** (virtue and awe) are feared,\nAnd **德明** (virtue and clarity) are held in reverence—\nThus they act with external transgressions and ignorance,\nHeaven’s signs are neglected,\nAnd drought, flood, pestilence, and famine arise—\nDisasters of all kinds flourish.\n\nOnly the ruler above should guide them with the vast dwelling of **天下** (the world),\nAnd let them wander in the realm of **太和** (Great Harmony),\nNot confining them in narrowness,\nYet daily treading upon the brink of peril and annihilation;\nShould draw them with **浩然** (boundless) **正气** (right qi),\nAnd let them nourish it in the **清虚** (pure and empty) **天** (Heaven),\nNot wearying of their birth,\nYet risking to fall into ruin and cessation.\n\nIt is only through cherishing the principle of their own life,\nAnd preserving Heaven’s **天良** (natural conscience),\nWithout the slightest weariness or exhaustion,\nThat one attains the *Shijing*’s words:\n*\"Revere Heaven’s wrath,\nAnd do not dare trifle with it;\nRevere Heaven’s decrees,\nAnd do not dare neglect them.\"*\n\nHeaven observes their **德** (virtue),\nAnd grants them brilliance and prosperity,\nLongevity and preservation—\nIndeed, there exists one who shares in Heaven and Earth’s eternal duration.\nThus, it is through not wearying that this is achieved.\n\nWho but the sage could accomplish this?\n\nThe ancient emperors cultivated humility and non-action,\nIlluminated great **德** (virtue/power),\nDaily refining and monthly perfecting,\nPurifying their hearts and clearing their thoughts,\nPenetrating the marvels of **造化** (creation and transformation),\nPiercing the clarity of **本来之天** (the original Heaven),\nOnly knowing themselves in truth.\n\nAs for **德业文章** (virtuous deeds and literary attainments),\nThe external marks they bear—\nThe sage never uses them to display or reveal himself to others.\n\nMoreover, they revered the **乾** (Qian) at dawn and the **坤** (Kun) at dusk,\nHeavily upheld the **Dao/Way** and guarded their bodies,\nNever for a breath departing from **仁** (benevolence),\nAnd the world could not add anything to them.\n\nHow did they love themselves?—\nAs for fame, rank, reputation, and glory—\nThe things others hold in high regard,\nThe sage never considered them worthy of exaltation.\n\nThough the sage’s own self-knowledge and self-love\nAre the same as what all people know and love—\nIt is only that common people, knowing it, must make it manifest,\nLoving it, must hold it in high esteem;\nThe sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTheir caution in solitude is profound,\nYet they do not indulge in ostentation before the world;\nThey uphold self-nourishment,\nYet they do not dare to boast of it.\n\nHow could they be compared with common people?\n\nIt is said that by discarding desire and embracing principle,\nBy fulfilling humanity’s potential in harmony with Heaven,\nOne ascends to transcend the mortal and attain sainthood,\nTo sever resemblance and depart from the crowd,\nAnd become an immortal enduring millions of years—\nAll this arises from knowing the vast dwelling’s security,\nCherishing the eternal life’s joy,\nFocusing solely on this and not on that,\nAnd the people naturally move toward goodness, unaware of their own doing.\n\nAbandon this, how could such goodness be achieved?\n\nThese words mean:\nDo not confine their dwelling—then their dwelling will be grand.\nDo not weary of their birth—then their birth will be long.\n\nHowever, in the cultivation process,\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) must be understood.\n\nWhen a person first receives **气** (qi),\nAt the moment of union between father and mother,\nA single **黍珠** (millet-sized pearl) is formed—\nAt this time, it is **絪絪缊缊** (unformed and indistinct),\nA mere cluster of **太和** (Great Harmony) **气** (qi),\nWith no trace of knowledge.\n\nYet, it is the most divine and wondrous essence,\nExhausting all transformations and producing endless worldly affairs—\nAll from this single **含灵** (life-containing) **气** (qi) **神** (spirit),\nFrom **无知无识** (no knowledge, no perception) to **有知有识** (knowledge and perception),\nFrom **无作无为** (no action, no doing) to **有作有为** (action and doing),\nNone of which are not initiated here.\n\nAt this stage, **天人一理** (Heaven and humanity are one principle),\n**物我同源** (things and self share the same origin),\n**体用兼赅** (substance and function are inseparable),\nAnd **显微无间** (manifest and subtle are continuous)—\nThus, it is called the **元神** (Original Spirit).\n\nThis is what Heaven bestows.\n\nWhen the blood and flesh take form,\nTen months within the womb,\nA cry at birth—\nThe infant emerges, and the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) begins to manifest.\n\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) is the **元气** (Primordial Qi) of **先天** (pre-heaven),\nShared by Heaven, Earth, and all beings,\nHidden within the **太虚** (Great Void).\nOnce it enters the human body,\nIt is concealed in the **虚无窟子** (void-like cavity) within the person.\nThis is Heaven’s gift.\n\nThose who cultivate seek not to grasp at emptiness or color in their pursuit.\nOnly through **无所知** (no knowledge) and **无所有** (no possession),\nSweeping away all dust and turbidity,\nDoes the inner essence reveal itself,\nAnd the divine mystery arise.\n\nAs for the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit),\nIt is the **精灵** (refined essence) **鬼** (spirit) of the human body,\nThe seed of endless **轮回** (reincarnations).\nIt requires the five senses and the complete formation of the ten thousand limbs,\nOnly when the person is about to be born and descend to earth,\nDoes the refined essence’s **魂魄** (soul and vital force) find attachment.\n\nThe ancients called this the **后天识神** (post-heaven Perceptive Spirit),\nBecause it arises from the formed **魄** (vital force).\n\nThis is the fundamental distinction between **元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).\n\nYet after birth,\nThe two spirits—**元神** (Original Spirit) and **识神** (Perceptive Spirit)—\nMerge into one.\n\nSometimes the **元神** (Original Spirit) is active,\nAnd the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) recedes in silence—\nThough the **后天** (post-heaven) **意气** (intentions and emotions) may stir,\nThey all arise from **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom),\nAnd manifest as **喜怒哀乐** (joy, anger, sorrow, delight).\nThe **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) also transforms into the **元神** (Original Spirit).\n\nSometimes the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit) is active,\nAnd the **元神** (Original Spirit) is concealed—\nThough traces of **仁义礼智** (benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom) appear,\nThey all become **私恩、私爱、私憎、私嫌** (private favors, private affections, private hatreds, private suspicions).\nThe **元神** (Original Spirit) also transforms into the **识神** (Perceptive Spirit).",

I teach: when in ignorance and unawareness,\nSeek the single aperture of the **Mystic Pass**—\nFor then one is one with Heaven and Earth,\nAnd harmonized with the boundless void.\n\nIf one seizes this

Earth,\nUnderstanding that what Heaven abhors must be what it loves—\nFor *\"without abhorrence, there can be no true love.\"*\nThis cyclic interplay of wondrous function,\nEven the Sage finds difficult to fathom.\n\nYet the Sage’s **Dao** is but Heaven’s **Dao**.\nHeaven does not dispute right and wrong with the common folk,\nBut nurtures all things—\nNone escape its warmth and favor,\nNor stray against its will.\n\nHeaven does not speak of **sensing and responding**,\nYet yin and yang alternate in motion—\nNone fail to harmonize in silent accord,\nNor stray against its will.\n\nTruly, **Heaven and humanity share the same Dao**—\nMotionless yet responsive,\nTransformative in its divine mystery!\nAll things spring from the same source,\nBoundless and impartial—\nWhen things come, it responds;\nHow could actions be more precise?\n\nThe **Perfect One** with **unthinking, unworried sincerity**,\nSilently wields **divine function** at the crossroads of life and death,\nStealthily seizes **Heaven’s mechanism** within the **Palace of Creation**,\nDescending into the **Watery Realm**,\nShaping the **Golden Land**,\nFollowing the **Hidden and the Strange**,\nSevering sight and sound—\nDeath becomes life, life becomes death;\nAt first, none know how they intermingle and respond,\nLike mother and child, husband and wife—\nThey come without summons, unite without scheme.\n\nIs this not the swiftness of **sensing and responding**,\nAnd the divine mystery?\n\nEven calamities and blessings are bestowed or taken away,\nFortune and misfortune are fixed or corrupt—\n*\"The Heavenly Net is vast, wide yet not missing a thread,\"*\nTruly, none can escape or evade it.\nFor **emptiness and space are the Dao**,\nAnd **Dao is Heaven**—\nOne cannot evade emptiness,\nNor escape the **Heavenly Net**.\n\nIf humanity does not defy the **Dao**, it does not defy Heaven—\nThen how could Heaven cease to nourish them?\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can one frighten them with death?\n\nIf I made the people always fear death as something extraordinary,\nI could seize and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\nThere are always those who execute punishment and kill.\nTo substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,\nIs like substituting for the **Great Carpenter** to hew—\nTo substitute for the **Great Carpenter** to hew,\nFew would not harm their own hands.\n\nIn ancient times, those who governed the world\nMust have followed what easily moved the people’s emotions,\nAnd preemptively guarded against it.\nThey did not follow the ruler’s joys or sorrows,\nBut only observed the people’s likes and dislikes,\nGuiding them along their natural inclinations—\nThus their teachings succeeded without severity,\nAnd their governance thrived without excessive measures.\n\nIf the people abandoned moral norms and violated propriety,\nDaring to transgress the established order,\nYet held no fear of death,\nThen even with the **Five Punishments** displayed on the **Torture Stakes**,\nAnd proclaimed on auspicious days,\nIt would be in vain to establish them—\nOf no use to the state or the people—\nWould this not be a waste of effort?\n\nOnly by leveraging the people’s love of life and fear of death,\nAnd daring to act deceitfully or maliciously,\nWould I then follow and kill them—\nThis is what is meant by *\"strike one to warn a hundred,\"*\nAnd *\"inflict few punishments yet inspire great sincerity.\"*\n\nThus the people, from father to son, from elder to younger brother,\nWould not dare to act as stepping stones to chaos—\nThey would fear self-destruction and embrace death.\n\nYet though the killing is done by those above,\nThe reason for killing depends on the person.\nOnly the **most virtuous** kill the **most unvirtuous**,\nAnd the people themselves kill the unvirtuous without mercy,\nFinding death sweet.\n\nMencius said: *\"Only Heaven’s officers can be killed\"*—\nFor **Heaven’s officers** are those who may kill others.\n\nIf one is not a **Heaven’s officer**,\nYet kills with violent retribution,\nThis is to govern chaos with chaos—\nNot only does the people’s chaos worsen,\nBut to substitute for those who execute punishment and kill,\nIs like a mere craftsman wielding the axe to shape the wind,\nOr swinging the blade to carve wheels—\nCould such a one master the divine artistry and achieve perfection?\n\nObserving craftsmen and scholars of past and present,\nIf they cannot equal the **Great Carpenter**,\nYet substitute to hew,\nWho has not harmed their own hands?\n\nAlas, the people are unfortunate—\nNot born in an age of **Dao**,\nThus bandits and thieves, deceitful and treacherous,\nHave no restraint.\nAnd even more unfortunate,\nThey do not encounter those who execute punishment—\nThen where would they find guidance?\nIf the thin become even thinner,\nAnd the thick also thin,\nIs this not deeply lamentable?",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, using the fear of death to illustrate the caution of solitude—\nA person’s diligence in solitude is profound,\nThen the distinction between Heaven and man becomes clear,\nAnd the separation of desires and principles is manifest.\nThough desires are few and faults not yet committed,\nAnd one strives to avoid transgressions yet cannot—\nIn this, one is ever vigilant and earnest,\nDreading the slightest lapse,\nStriving to suppress falsehood and deceit,\nIt is not difficult to purify desires and refine principles,\nAnd instantly reveal the **original face of nature**.\n\nIf, in places unseen and unheard,\nOne lacks daily cultivation of moral restraint and self-nurturing,\nYet at moments when desires surge and emotions overwhelm,\nOne attempts to uproot evil and sudden sees **True Nature**,\nThen it is certain that evil will not be uprooted but will multiply,\nAnd the more one strives to cleanse the heart, the more it will be disturbed.\n\nThe **Supreme Sage** said:\n*“If the people do not fear death, how can one frighten them with death?”*\nReason and circumstance are thus interdependent—\nOnly by guarding against temptation in seclusion,\nHaving known the wrongness of desires,\nCan one restrain them in the moment,\nAnd thus return to the **natural order of the mind**.\n\nWhen one thought is swept away,\nAnd one thought is purified,\nEvil will not sprout anew from that moment.\nThis is why the people commonly fear death,\nYet those who act strangely—\nIf I seize them and execute them,\nWho would dare to rebel or disrespect,\nOr violate the **proper order of relationships**?\n\nIndeed, the **Dao/Way** drives out the lack of **Dao/Way**,\nJust as a ruler soothes and governs all subjects,\nCommanding the common folk,\nUsing supreme mercy to kill those without mercy,\nAnd great righteousness to punish the unrighteous—\nNaturally, none who submit will remain secure,\nNear ones will be pleased while distant ones will come,\nAnd none will turn their weapons against their rulers,\nOr strike back in rebellion,\nTo become enemies or cause harm.\n\nScholars who wish to discard falsehood and preserve sincerity,\nTo return to their roots and restore their origin,\nMust suppress evil **gradually**,\nAnd maintain constancy **steadfastly**,\nSo that when one opening is illuminated,\nAll openings will be **vital and responsive**,\nAnd the **original spirit** will be at peace,\nObedient to its natural commands.\nAs it is said:\n*“If a person can remain ever pure and clear,\nThen all of Heaven and Earth will naturally return to them”*;\nAnd again:\n*“If a person can correct their spirit in one moment,\nThen all evils will not dare to intrude.”*\n\nThis is akin to how those who execute punishment\nCan kill without resentment,\nAnd the condemned will meet their fate with acceptance—\nThe same **natural Dao/Way**,\nA rare and wondrous effect.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: The Virtuous Excel in Not Valuing Life**\nThe people’s hunger arises from their rulers’ excessive taxation,\nThus they hunger.\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their rulers’ meddling,\nThus they are difficult to govern.\nThe people’s indifference to death comes from their rulers’ obsession with prolonging life,\nThus they treat death lightly.\n\nOnly those who do not make life their pursuit\nAre truly virtuous in excelling beyond valuing life.\nFrom ancient times, the people are the foundation of the state,\nAnd food is the **Heavenly necessity** for the people.\nA state without people is a state without support—\nWho will uphold it?\nThe people without food cannot survive—\nHow will they live?\nThus, for those who rule over others,\nThere must be those who open fields and cultivate land,\nDeepening the **roots of abundance** before the people have need;\nAnd those who establish rites and regulate changes,\nControlling the **flow of excess** after the people have eaten;\nAs well as those who reduce labor to fill shortages,\nAnd curtail waste to aid insufficiency—\nThen the people will naturally be well-fed and content,\nWithout the **cries of the starving** in the ninth month,\nOr the **lamentations of famine**.\n\nEven if droughts persist and famines recur,\nYet if the granaries are filled,\nThere will be no fear of calamity.\n\nBut in this world, rulers are often arrogant and licentious,\nTheir extravagance growing daily:\nSome indulge in rare delicacies and curiosities for amusement,\nOthers build jade towers and palaces to gratify their desires—\nOften the granaries are emptied,\nYet expenditures never decrease.\nEven basic provisions are lacking,\nAnd they impose additional levies:\nFirst, they add taxes and increase tolls,\nYet still the people fear their **oppressive burdens**;\nNext, they plunder and extort without restraint,\nIgnoring even **Heaven’s command**.\n\nTheir love for music and beauty is paramount,\nTheir luxury and excess ever escalating.\nThey drain the **vital essence** of all the people,\nTo satiate their own **licentiousness**.\nEven when the state’s treasury is exhausted,\nTheir demands for tribute never slacken.\n\nHeaven and Earth produce wealth,\nOnly in these limited amounts.\nIf such **harsh extortion** continues without end,\nAnd the people are taken without measure—\nEven if there are frequent **abundant harvests**,\nAnd years of **prosperity and blessing**,\nHow can one expect the people to not hunger?\n\nIn the age of **Zhuāng Lóng**,\nClothing was worn and food was eaten,\nHouses were dwelt in and fields were tilled,\nEach cherishing their own kin,\nEach nurturing their own elders.\nThe **noble ones** had no need to inquire about rites and propriety,\nYet naturally dwelled in **Ren** and followed **Yì**;\nThe **common folk** had no fondness for loyalty and sincerity,\nYet naturally found joy in their work and peace in their homes.\nIndeed, the rulers governed through **non-action**,\nAnd the people transformed themselves through **non-action**.\nCustoms were not artificially made pure, yet they were pure,\nAnd the **folkways** did not seek antiquity, yet they were ancient.\nHow harmonious and flourishing was that era!\n\nBut afterward, as **laws and regulations** multiplied,\nAnd the **folkways** grew ever more **deviant and subtle**,\nAs **statutes and decrees** were frequently proclaimed,\nAnd **bandits and thieves** became ever more rampant—\nNot only under tyrannical rulers,\nBut even among **wise and enlightened kings**,\nWho strove with vigor to govern,\nExerted their utmost in statecraft,\nAnd whose policies grew ever more complex—\nThe more elaborate the laws, the more deceit arose,\nThe stricter the decrees, the more cunning flourished.\nIs this not because **qi and techniques** cannot be reversed,\nOr **Heaven’s will** cannot be altered?\nOr because they **fail to grasp the roots and foundational principles**,\nYet seek only superficial results?\n\nNot only does this fail to benefit the people’s livelihood,\nBut it **burdens the Way of the world**.\n\nThe people’s hearts are naturally at ease,\nYet rulers disturb them with **policies and commands**.\nThe people’s emotions are naturally without excess,\nYet rulers disrupt them with **rules and systems**.\nEvery additional **edict** from the court\nMultiplies **deceit** among the common folk,\nAnd every new **regulation**\nEncourages **clever evasion** among them.\n\nNo wonder the **Way of the world** becomes ever more **perverse**,\nAnd the people’s **moral inclinations** grow ever more **erratic**,\nMaking governance ever more difficult!\n\nOnly when the ruler sits **upright and still**,\nAnd extends their **virtuous influence** without action,\nWill the people below **naturally settle into order and obedience**.\nThe ruler and the people will be at peace in **Heaven’s non-action**—\nIs this not joy indeed?\n\nMoreover, those who **overvalue life** within\nWill labor their hearts ever more,\nAnd exhaust their **vital essence** ever further—\nTheir **spirit and qi** will dissipate,\nAnd their **life and fate** will perish,\nThe more they cling to life, the faster they die.\n\nThus, the more one **obsesses over life**,\nThe more lightly one treats death.\nOnly those who do not **honor life**,\nNor **prioritize its preservation**,\nWho dress and eat according to **natural circumstances**,\nAnd whose expenditures **do not contend with the world’s resources**,\nWill find their hearts at ease and their bodies secure,\nTheir **original nature** restored and their **fate prolonged**,\nAnd **endless blessings** forever enjoyed.»",

ruler, the **vital essence** the people.\nFollow the **constant Dao** in its natural course,\nWith **spirit** as sovereign, and **vital essence** obeying its command.\nThus, when the **spirit** wanders, the **vital essence** leaks away.\nThe depletion of **vital essence** stems from the **spirit’s** flight—\nLike the people’s hunger arising from excessive taxation by the ruler.\nThough their forms differ, their principles are one.\n\nThe **heart** is the sovereign of the body;\nWhen the **Heavenly Sovereign** is at ease,\nAll limbs follow its decree.\nBut if the **Heavenly Sovereign** is disturbed,\nThen the **vital essence and qi** of the whole body are drained—\nHow much more so when the fields are laid waste!\n\nThus, **Immortal Adepts** possess the art of **returning to the origin**,\nTaking **qi** as sovereign, while the **spirit** obeys its command—\nJust as a ruler follows the people’s desires and yields to their sentiments,\nSo that **qi** is abundant, the **spirit** complete,\nAnd the people at peace, the nation prosperous.\nThis is the way of **serving above by nourishing below**,\nOf **abundance above** supplementing **deficiency below**—\nTo govern the world as one’s own affair,\nRather than making oneself the world’s burden.\n\nThough the **Alchemical Dao** speaks of **action**,\nIt must first arise from **non-action**,\nThen return to **non-action** once more—\nOnly then does one grasp the **original Heavenly spirit and qi**,\nAnd ascend to **sainthood**, transcending the mundane.\nIf one clings entirely to **action**,\nThe **spirit** grows restless, and the **qi** weakens—\nInevitably, the more one refines, the more the **qi** scatters,\nThe more one labors, the more the **qi** disperses.\nOnly by guiding its momentum and acting in accordance with the times,\nIn governing oneself and the people alike,\nShould one hold such a view.\n\nIf one fears wealth will fail and life will perish,\nThen one exhausts **vital essence** and **spirit** in vain,\nHoping to preserve **postnatal life**,\nDay and night in torment, restless in sleep—\nMany a **spirit and qi** is thus consumed.\nYet **life and fate** are Heaven’s decree, not man’s to seek.\nA ruler who fears for those who cling to life\nOnly hastens them toward death’s embrace.\nOnly by not valuing the **limited postnatal life**,\nAnd instead preserving the **boundless prenatal fate**,\nCan one safeguard **original nature** and **fate**,\nAnd thus honor the body truly.\n\n**Chapter LXXVI: The Soft and Weak Take Preeminence**\nWhen a man is whole, he is soft and weak;\nWhen he dies, he becomes rigid and strong.\nGrasses and trees, when alive, are tender and pliable;\nWhen dead, they wither and decay.\nThus, the rigid and strong are companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are companions of life.\nHence, the strong in arms do not conquer,\nAnd the rigid in wood bends and breaks.\nThe strong and great must yield to the lowly,\nWhile the soft and weak ascend above.\n\nWhen man receives the **Yang Harmony qi**, he lives;\nWhen he encounters the **Yin Cold qi**, he dies.\nWhen the **Yang Harmony qi** gathers,\nThe four limbs grow supple, the body soft as silk,\nAnd life’s vitality flows unceasing.\nBut when the **Yin Cold qi** congeals,\nThe flesh grows dry and parched, the skin withers and falls away—\nAnd the **qi of death** approaches.\n\nObserve the pot and steamer:\nWhen steaming, the **Yang qi** rises in mist,\nAnd all things dissolve and transform.\nBut in freezing cold, they harden and stiffen.\nObserve the earth in spring and summer:\nWhen **Yang qi** thrives, all things flourish and grow—\nNone fail to bloom and thrive.\nBut in autumn and winter, when **Yin qi** prevails,\nAll things wither and fall—\nNone escape decay.\n\nMan and all things share a single source;\nThere is no division between them.\nThus, in all things under Heaven,\nThe rigid and strong are companions of death,\nWhile the soft and weak are companions of life.\n\nTake warfare as an example:\nOften the strong are defeated, the weak victorious—\nAs when **Ziyou**’s overbearing strength led to ruin,\nAnd **Bibi**’s yielding tactics triumphed at **Rand**.\nWhy is this?\nBecause the strong grow exhausted in their vigor,\nWhile the weak harbor the seeds of revival—\nThus, they cannot prevail.\n\nObserve the trees:\nThough wood is strong, when **Yin qi** dominates and **Yang qi** wanes,\nIt is bound and broken—\nNo longer capable of growth.\nThe strong and great exhaust their **life qi**,\nAnd invite the **qi of death**—\nTruly the lowest of all things.\nThe soft and weak, however, see **Yin qi** dissipate and **Yang qi** flourish—\nThe highest of all things.\n\nHow can man not embrace weakness and reject strength,\nNor submit to lowliness while aspiring to preeminence?\n\nThe **Dao of Cultivation** most reveres the **Mysterious Pass**—\nThe **original qi** of Heaven, Earth, and all things.\nThis **qi** is both supremely soft and hard,\nSupremely weak and strong,\nYet neither soft nor hard, neither weak nor strong can be seen.\nIn the dim and hazy void,\nSuddenly, **Yin** contains **Yang**, and **killing** gives birth to **life**—\nSeemingly present, yet absent;\nSeemingly real, yet empty.\nThis is the **silent, odorless**,\nThe **Heavenly mechanism** of **original beginning**.\nIf man can **steal this

**Dao** of Heaven diminishes the excessive to supplement the insufficient,\nBut the **Dao** of humankind does otherwise—it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can serve the excessive to benefit the world?\nOnly the one who holds the **Dao**.\n\nThus, the Sage acts but does not rely,\nAccomplishes but does not dwell—\nDoes this not mean he does not desire to be seen as virtuous?\nThe **Dao** of Heaven flows and unfolds,\nNurturing all things,\nWith naught but **yin** and **yang**,\nComing and going, alternating in motion,\nGreat, central, and most upright,\nWithout favor or bias.\n\nHence, **yin** at its peak gives rise to **yang**,\nAnd **yang** at its peak gives rise to **yin**.\nWhen **yin** is excessive and **yang** declines,\nIt suppresses **yin** and aids **yang**;\nWhen **yang** is excessive and **yin** declines,\nIt suppresses **yang** and aids **yin**.\nEbb and flow, full and empty,\nMove in harmony with time,\nThus all things are born and transformed,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity,\nA Heaven enduring ten thousand years without decay.\nHow different is this from the archer’s art?\nGrasp the bow with steady resolve,\nThe inner will upright, the outer form aligned,\nEnsure the front and back arms,\nBalanced and smooth—\nThe high, it presses down; the low, it lifts up.\nThe excessive, it diminishes; the insufficient, it supplements.\nThen, in accord with the hand, it releases,\nFollowing the mark and striking true,\nWithout fear of missing.\n\nYet it does not compare to the **Dao** of Heaven—\nTaking the people’s **fat and marrow**,\nFilling its own **sacks of greed**,\nOften diminishing the insufficient to serve the excessive.\nWho can take the **excess of the sovereign**,\nAnd serve the **insufficient of the world**?\nOnly the **Dao**-holding Sage,\nWho follows the **Dao** of Heaven and aligns with human nature,\nDiminishes what is excessive, supplements what is insufficient,\nSo that the common people do not sigh in resentment.\nThough acting for oneself,\nIt is still in accordance with the **Dao** of Heaven—\nNever boasting of what is done;\nThough achievements come from sincerity,\nIt is but the utmost sincerity fulfilling one’s nature—\nNever claiming credit for them.\n\nSuch a Sage,\nNearly in harmony with Heaven’s effortless transformation,\nNot bound by natural course,\nNot desiring to show traces of action.\nThe **power** of nurturing things,\nBrilliant and evident to all,\nIs it not because the virtuous do not wish to be seen as virtuous?\nThis is why Heaven has no limits,\nAnd only the Sage unites Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt the beginning of life,\nOne is purely **yin** or purely **yang**,\nMost balanced and upright,\nWithout victory or defeat, without disparity.\nThus, the sun advances by day, the moon by night,\nWith tender bones and weak body yet flourishing.\nBut once life emerges,\nFire dwells above, water below,\nWater and fire not mingling—\nHence, **yin** is always excessive,\nAnd **yang** always insufficient.\nAs **yang** water is scorched by **yin** fire,\nHuman desires grow ever more,\nVulgar **qi** ever more fervent,\nWhile Heaven’s **true heart** is daily obscured,\nAnd **true qi** gradually fades,\nThe **mechanism of life** left without trace.\n\nIf the excessive **yin** fire were to descend,\nSupplementing the insufficient **yang** water;\nAnd once the **yang** water’s insufficiency is mended,\nStill restraining the excessive **yin** fire—\nLike the archer’s art,\nDiminishing the excessive, supplementing the insufficient,\nThen **yin** and **yang** are balanced.\nThis is all through water’s and fire’s own movement,\n**Yin** and **yang**’s own interplay,\nAnd Heaven itself does not know who does this.\n\nThe **Dao** of humankind is burdened by action,\nThe **Dao** of Heaven is honored by non-action.\nWhat else is cultivation but this?\nTo restore the **post-heaven yin and yang** to the **pre-heaven yin and yang**,\nFlowing without ceasing,\nAchieving effortless spontaneity.\n\n**Chapter LXXVIII: Receive the Filth of the Realm**\nUnder Heaven, none are as soft and weak as water,\nYet none can overcome the firm and strong as water does.\nThere is nothing to replace it.\n\nThus, the soft overcomes the strong,\nThe weak overcomes the rigid—\nAll know this, yet few can practice it.\nHence, the Sage says:\n*\"To receive the filth of the realm,\nIs to be its lord of soil and grain.\nTo bear the realm’s misfortunes,\nIs to be its king under Heaven.\"*\n\nWords that seem reversed.\nIn the **Supreme Chapter**, it was said that the soft and weak are the followers of life,\nThe firm and strong are the followers of death—\nThus, the soft and weak occupy the high,\nThe firm and strong occupy the low,\nAnd it can be known that the utmost softness is the utmost rigidity,\nThe utmost weakness is the utmost strength.\n\nDaily, nightly, in all things,\nThe soft and weak are beneficial to all yet do not contend,\nEver in the humble low yet do not weary.\nThough but a drop’s worth,\nPeople may scorn it.\nThough but a ladle’s measure,\nPeople may slight it.\nYet when it accumulates into the deep,\nGathers into the sea,\nThen vast and boundless,\nIt can bear boats yet also overturn them;\nIt can nurture things yet also destroy them.\nNot only does it overcome all under Heaven,\nEven those skilled at attacking the firm and strong—\nNo firmness remains unbroken,\nNo strength remains unconquered—\nYet none can stand against it.\n\nThus, it is known:\nThe utmost softness under Heaven,\nCan govern the utmost rigidity under Heaven;\nThe utmost weakness under Heaven,\nCan repel the utmost strength under Heaven.\nWater, water!\nHow soft and weak it is,\nYet how strong and firm it becomes!\n\nMoreover, under Heaven, there is no task easier than attacking water,\nYet the firm and strong are ultimately unable to prevail.\nWhy do people not embrace softness while also embracing rigidity,\nNot adopt weakness while also adopting strength—\nEverywhere it is seen?\nDo they not know that softness overcomes rigidity,\nThat weakness overcomes strength?\n\nIt is because Heaven’s **true heart** moves,\nYet none know it,\nAnd once moved,\nIt is instantly stained by desires,\nDeflected by customs—\nThus, they bristle in arrogance,\nUnwilling to rest in softness and weakness.\nHence, as cleverness grows,\n**Virtue and principle** are lost;\nAs preferences become fixed,\n**True nature** is extinguished.\nSo that **Dao-heart** departs,\nHuman desires arise;\n**Guest-qi** flourishes,\n**True-qi** diminishes.\nLife’s **mechanism** gone,\nLife’s **mechanism** extinguished—\nTo make life flourish without end is difficult indeed.\n\nThe Sage says, *\"To receive the filth of the realm,\nIs to be

moments,\nCorrecting faults when they arise,\nAnd striving harder in goodness—\nMay one truly manifest goodness in body and mind,\nAnd forever be the perfect child of Heaven and Earth,\nThe complete Sage,\nWithout any deficiency.\n\nIt is clear that doing good\nOnly requires self-examination,\nNot others’ compliance.\nIf one blames others but not oneself,\nObserves outward but not inward,\nEven if one resolves a momentary anger,\nAnd though grudges may be dispersed,\nThey will not become enemies—\nYet without inward self-reproach,\nWithout restraining anger and desire,\nThough one may resolve it outwardly,\nOne cannot release it in the hidden depths.\nHow can one then be pure and unstained,\nFree and joyful,\nAnd return to the original, naturally good nature of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, reconciling great grudges will leave lingering grudges—\nHow can this be called good?\n\nOnly the Sage, in conduct and interaction,\nPrioritizes self-cultivation,\nAnd does not weigh others’ praise or blame, likes or dislikes.\nLike a contract split in two, each party holding one half,\nForever as evidence—\nClear that there is no deceit from me,\nNo deceit from you.\n\nThe Sage holds virtue as he holds the left contract—\nOnly cultivating within, never blaming others.\nThis is why he aligns with Heaven and Earth in greatness.\n\nThis is called *\"the virtuous govern

complete.\nThose who blame themselves lighten others’ burden—\nTheir goodness is restored.\n\nWhen people turn to goodness,\nHeaven’s heart favors them—\nFor countless eons, without fail.\n\n*The Book of Documents* says:\n*\"Heaven has no favorites—\nIt aids only virtue.\"*\nIs this not the same as *\"The Supreme Way has no favorites—\nIt always sides with the good\"*?\n\nThe Sage’s learning:\nOnly

      "translated_text": "The practitioner of reverse cultivation indeed slowly stirs the *yang* fire and *yin* talisman from the myriad forms and colors, drawing them back into the Five Bright Palaces. With the primordial *Taiyi* ancestral *qi* and the natural divine fire, one refines them—thus transforming the form into a single *qi*. Further refining this *qi* allows it to condense into spirit.\n\nIf one steadfastly guards the void, nurturing the numinous *yang*, without returning to the origin of the *Wuji*, one may then manifest form when emerging and leave no trace when retreating. What difference is there between this and ordinary humanity?\n\nIn essence, this prenatal breath is the return to the moment when one’s parents’ mingled *qi* and blood first coalesced. If one cultivates this prenatal breath, day and night with the true intent of making the nonexistent into the existent, the formless into the formed, and the thoughtless into the thoughtful, preserving and gathering it, it will then form a spiritual embryo as the original spirit.\n\nWhen the ten months have passed and the form is complete, it sheds its shell and ascends through the crown, piercing the heavens, soaring among the *Luanhe* and *Xinghan*, riding the *luan* and *he* cranes, traversing the celestial realms, and ascending to the Jade Capital—all in the blink of an eye.\n\nYet this prenatal breath, though refined from the mortal’s colored form, is not the ordinary essence, *qi*, or spirit congealed. Though the alchemist cannot do without the postnatal, formed, and colored essence and *qi* as their foundation, they do not rely on them entirely. For postnatal essence and *qi* are all material and substantial, bound by fate—subject to birth and death, the wheel of rebirth inevitable. Moreover, coarse essence and coarse *qi* are all dull and sluggish things—how could they be numinous?\n\nUltimately, one borrows the crude matter within the mortal’s colored form, refining it through countless forging and purifying processes, extracting that spotless, pure, and supremely numinous essence, *qi*, and spirit to become the true *Yi* breath, returning it to oneself to form the immortal embryo and spiritual elixir. The saying of \"extracting lead and adding mercury\" is but this.\n\nAll else that clings to form and color is not the true Dao.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The embryo forms from the latent breath,\nThe breath rests within the embryo.\"*\n\nThus, to forge the spiritual elixir and achieve an ageless body, one cannot do without nurturing the prenatal breath. To gather the prenatal breath in the void within the *dantian*, one must first form the embryo—otherwise, it will not return.\n\nIf one remains purely still and active in harmony, with not a trace of mundane *qi* mingling or the mundane spirit straying outward, then the spirit will not scatter, and the *qi* will not dissipate—it will not disperse like a child from its mother or a husband from his wife. Do you understand?\n\n---\n**Chapter 80: The Small State with Few People**\n\nA small state with few people—\nLet there be ten or a hundred households’ worth of tools, yet unused.\nLet the people hold death in reverence and not wander far.\nThough they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them.\nThough they have armor and weapons, they do not display them.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\nLet their food be sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyous.\nNeighboring states are visible, the sounds of chickens and dogs heard—\nYet the people, from birth to death, do not visit one another.\n\nA small state with few people, remote and sparse—\nTo become a flourishing, grand realm,\nAnd cultivate the refined customs of antiquity,\nSeems indeed difficult.\n\nYet if one reduces wasteful expenditures,\nTrims superfluous formalities,\nAnd lets the tools of ten or a hundred households lie unused,\nThen waste diminishes while goods increase—\nThe wealth of the state can thus be achieved.\n\nMoreover, if one does not indulge desires lightly nor court death through private schemes,\nIf one does not flee to distant lands or dwell in foreign realms,\nBut clings only to parents and cherishes siblings,\nHolding death in reverence and not wandering far—\nThen an era of tranquility, harmony, and kinship can be attained.\n\nThus, *\"Charming is our sovereign, cherishing this land,\"*\nThough they have boats and carriages,\nThey do not venture far to strange lands,\nLeaving their ancestral homeland.\n\nWhen the court’s benevolence penetrates deeply,\nSoaking into the marrow and flesh,\nWith affection like that of parents and siblings,\nThen even rebellious and stubborn folk\nTransform into the virtuous.\nThough they have armor and weapons,\nThey have no need to display them.\n\nThus, with the ruler serene above and the people joyous below,\nThe people at ease and the state prosperous—\nIf one restores the governance of knotted cords,\nEnjoys the harmony of the *Taihe*,\nHonors kin and elders,\nDwells in proper abodes and tends proper fields,\nFinds delight in food and clothing,\nAnd takes joy in settled customs,\nWith sincerity fostering tradition—\nWhat fear is there that the state is small or the people few,\nThat it cannot achieve grandeur and abundance,\nOr that benevolence cannot prevail?\n\nWhen the people love their ruler as parents,\nAnd the ruler views them as children,\nWith loyal hearts and deep affection—\nEven a moment’s separation is unbearable.\n\nThough neighboring states are near,\nVisible at a glance and their chickens and dogs heard within earshot,\nThe people, from youth to old age, from birth to death,\nDo not once visit one another.\n\nThis is because the people, moved by gratitude and transformed by virtue,\nAre deeply bound to their ruler.\nThus, they rest in the governance of *Wuwei*,\nEnjoy the Dao’s celestial harmony,\nAnd do not dare to stray even a step.\n\nIn this way, how could the state fear being small,\nOr the people fear being few?\n\nNecessarily, their influence spreads to the four quarters,\nTheir reputation carried far—\nAnd the world submits to virtue,\nAll nations aligning in unity.\n\nThis is the method for those aged and weakened by declining essence.\n\nWhen a person grows old,\nTheir essence and *qi* scatter,\nLead and mercury diminish—\nTo cultivate the Great Elixir’s Dao seems indeed difficult.\n\nYet the matter of the Golden Elixir\nIs not of postnatal essence and *qi*,\nBut of the primordial lead and mercury.\nIf one attains the supreme unity’s method,\nExtracting and taking it,\nIngesting and consuming it—\nWhether old or young,\nOne may obtain the medicine in an instant,\nAchieving success in a thousand years or three months.\n\nThe only misfortune is failing to hear of the primordial *Yi* breath,\nAnd instead relying solely on the postnatal, formed essence—\nNot only will the aged achieve nothing,\nBut even the young and vigorous\nWill ultimately gain nothing.",

      "translated_text": "When cultivation reaches this stage, one finds great harmony with the Dao.\n\nSpeaking of Daoist practice, there have been two ancient methods: those who cultivate through purity, and those who cultivate through yin-yang supplementation.\n\nCultivation through purity means refining the void and unity—no need to refine essence or *qi*. Yet this is not for the ordinary practitioner; only those of the highest root and capacity can speak of it. If one’s innate nature is truly extraordinary, proceeding from this step onward follows the natural Way of Heaven and Earth, unlike the teachings of my master today, which still involve contrivance.\n\nWithin the human body, there exist the mechanisms of yin-yang (坎 *kǎn* and 离 *lí*), the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth (乾 *qián* and 坤 *kūn*), the movements of sun and moon, water and fire, ascent and descent, advance and retreat—just as the heavens move in their courses, all naturally, without need of artificial manipulation. One need only rectify the original spirit, letting it act without thought or deliberation, without striving or planning. Then, the pure and empty *qi* flows boundlessly, naturally inhaling and exhaling, rising and falling like the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth, the coming and going of sun and moon, the ascent of water and descent of fire, the ebb and flow of yin and yang—advancing and retreating thusly.\n\nThough there are stages of fire and heat, they amount to nothing more than calming the mind, reducing desires, and maintaining inner stillness, allowing true *qi* to circulate without ceasing. Though there are movements of ascent and descent, they are merely the constant rising of true water and the constant descending of true fire. Even in the practice of Daoist bathing, it is only a matter of restraining anger, suppressing desires, purifying thoughts, and washing the heart, so that the Great Harmony may be embraced.\n\nThough there are elixirs and pills, they are but this: taking spirit as father and *qi* as mother, the two entwined into one, merging without separation, giving birth to that primordial point of true soul—what is called the true essence of the Palace of Separation (離宮), or the true mercury of the human body. By refining one’s spirit-*qi* into this true mercury, a fetus is formed, and later, a sun-body emerges—organs, bones, blood vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, hair, flesh, and all awareness, none of which differ from the human form. Divided, it can manifest as myriad bodies; united, it returns to one *qi*. All stems from the union of spirit-father and *qi*-mother, their fusion producing this true mercury’s essence, which becomes the sun-body.\n\nYet this true mercury requires the condition of birth. The heart governs the *qi* of the five viscera; when the central *qi* ascends, the *qi* of the five viscera ascends with it; when the central *qi* descends, the *qi* of the five viscera descends with it. Its motion arises from the movement of true mercury; its stillness arises from its repose. In short, motion and stillness, ascent and descent—all belong to the natural Way, and one must only follow its natural operation.\n\nYet few ancient immortals began their practice from this step. What is meant by yin-yang supplementation?\n\nFirst, one must recognize the foundation of the Supreme Ultimate (太極), the emergence of primordial yang, and then invest this point of true yang-*qi* into the dantian, just as parents unite—precision and blood merging into one within the womb. This is the primordial true seed, planted in the Palace of Mutual Sensation (交感宮), where lead and mercury are daily refined, gradually growing until, one day, it emerges from the shell, and the immortal of the naked embryo is born. Without this true seed, one’s practice is empty. Though there may be gains, they will only preserve the physical form and cannot produce the transcendent body.\n\nDo you understand? With this point of true yang-*qi* planted in the womb, one may then apply the illumination of spirit-light, and over time, the true yang will stir. It is permissible to draw the water of *kǎn* upward and guide the fire of *lí* downward, refining all the turbid yin-dregs and corpse-*qi* of the physical body, extracting only the pure *qi*, blending it with the soul-yang, and forming it into an elixir to nourish the spirit—thus achieving flight and transformation. Yet even this is the natural Way.\n\nOrdinary people, having fallen into the post-heavenly realm, have depleted their spirit and *qi*, and their years have aged them. Like travelers far from home, they must return from afar, and thus must exert effort.\n\nSince spirit and *qi* are divided and not yet unified, during seated practice, one must use a portion of intention and *qi* to gather them both into the dantian, ensuring not a single thread escapes outward, not a breath leaves or enters. One need only follow the rhythm of inhalation and exhalation—from one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, to ten thousand—without constraint. Then, having tightly sealed the great gate, one stores the spirit at the dantian’s bolt, practicing thus for a while, before halting external breath and allowing true breath to move. One then nourishes it again, and soon the true yang-*qi* surges forth like a gale or billowing clouds. Quickly, one opens the pass and guides it upward.\n\nIn its ascent, one relies on spirit, not *qi*—only concentrating the spirit at the tailbone’s end is sufficient. When the true *qi* rushes forth, one nourishes it for a moment before descending. In summary, when true yang first stirs, one must exert some effort before ascent or descent becomes possible. For the vulgar body’s turbid *qi* is too heavy, and it must be vigorously agitated to dispel its filth, revealing the pure and clear spirit-*qi* that will serve as the foundation for the elixir. Hence the ancients said: At first, one gathers the medicine, but without fierce, martial fire and urgent refining, true gold cannot be extracted from the ore—this is why martial fire is called \"wild battle.\"\n\nOnce ascent and descent are complete, when the dantian is full and the heart and spirit are at ease, one may then employ the method of refining the void, following the *qi*’s natural movements to complete the work.",

shen**, it is as though without.\n\nFor those who seek **true cultivation** (修真),\nat the very outset,\nthe precious task is to subdue the **mang zhì** (妄識, deluded perceptions)\nof the two eyes, ears, mouth, body, and mind.\nThen gather the spirit at the **Dan xióng** (丹扃, Elixir Gate),\nregulate the breath at the **Dan tián** (丹田, Elixir Field),\nand ensure that all ordinary breaths are extinguished—\nonly then does the **yuan qì** (元氣, Original Qi) begin to return in submission.\n\nOnce the **yuan qì** has gathered,\n**yīnyīn huópó** (氤氳活泼, vibrant and lively),\n**wǎnzhuǎn yōuyáng**

very **Yánluó lǎozi** (閻羅老子, Lord Yama) himself\nhas no power over you.\n\nThus the method must not be revealed to the unworthy,\nlest Heaven’s spirits lose their authority over **shàn è bào yìng** (善惡報應, reward and retribution).\n\nYou, who know the Dao,\nmust surely grasp its meaning.\nTightly seal your lips and tongue,\ndo not recklessly spill Heaven’s secrets,\nits hidden keys.\n\nOnce the

talisman),\nurging and prompting it—\nmaking it rise and fall, come and go without end,\nstirring and refining it,\nso that it transforms the ordinary into the true,\nits changes
