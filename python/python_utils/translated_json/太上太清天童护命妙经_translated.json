The author is unknown, likely composed during the Tang dynasty. It falsely attributes to the Most High Lord Lao the methods of reciting scriptures and swallowing talismans to dispel disasters and cure illnesses. An appended postscript by Master Chuanxiao of Mount Mao from the *jiāzǐ* year of the Shaoxing era (1144) claims that in the third year of the Daguan era (1109), the Most High bestowed the *Augmented Heavenly Youth Life-Protecting Scripture* upon the Daoist Liang Wuzhen.

Wear them as you go.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Highest and Most Pure Heavenly Youth Life-Protecting Wondrous Scripture*\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Daye era of the Sui dynasty, Lord Lao dispatched the spirit of Mount Huo to foretell the mandate of the Tang to Li Yuan. On the twenty-third day of the second month in the first year of the Wude era of Emperor Gaozu, an elderly man with hoary hair and beard, clad in white robes and a black cap, riding a white horse with red mane, tail, and hooves, appeared on Yangjiao Mountain in Jinzhou. He said to Ji Shanxing of Jiang: *\"Tell the Son of Heaven of the Great Tang that he has now attained sagely rule, and the altars of soil and grain will endure.\"* With these words, he soared into the sky.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month of the same year, he reappeared as before, though Shanxing was unsure what sign to present. The elderly man said: *\"When you reach the capital, someone will offer a stone tortoise as proof.\"* With that, he vanished.\n\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, Shanxing met He Xiaoyi, the Chief Administrator of Jinzhou, and recounted the event. Xiaoyi brought Shanxing to meet the Prince of Qin, who was stationed in Jin to suppress rebels. The prince then dispatched Commander Du Ang and Shanxing to the site of the apparition to perform sacrifices. The elderly man reappeared, just as Shanxing had described. The Prince of Qin ordered Ang and Shanxing to rush to the capital by post-horse to report the matter. They arrived on the nineteenth day of the fifth month and, at the gate of the audience hall, saw Zhang Da, the Administrator of Qiongzhou, presenting a stone tortoise inscribed with the words: *\"The realm is at peace, descendants flourish, for a thousand myriad generations, for a thousand myriad years.\"*\n\nThey entered together to report, and the prophecy was confirmed. Emperor Gaozu was overjoyed and decreed the construction of a temple at the site of the apparition.\n\nShanxing again saw the elderly man, who asked: *\"What does the Son of Heaven doubt of me?\"*\nShanxing replied: *\"He does not know your sagely name.\"*\nThe elderly man said: *\"I am the Supreme Divine Immortal, known as Lord Lao, the sagely ancestor of the emperor. In Bozhou, a withered cypress has revived as a sign of the realm’s great peace.\"*\n\nShanxing immediately informed Xiaoyi, who reported it to the throne. On the seventh day of the twelfth month of the same year, Lord Lao reappeared at the temple and said to Shanxing: *\"The withered cypress in my temple in Bozhou has revived. The Tang has attained sagely rule, and its descendants shall enjoy an enduring reign. I have dispatched a million divine soldiers to assist the state in suppressing Liu Heita by the fourth month.\"*\n\nHe rushed to report this, and on the twenty-first day of the fourth month of the following year, Liu Heita was indeed pacified. Thus, the realm was greatly stabilized, and the withered cypress revived as foretold. Yangjiao Mountain was renamed Longjiao Mountain, and the temple was renamed Qingtang Abbey.\n\nDuring the *Longshuo* era of the High Ancestor’s reign, Lord Lao reappeared, and his likeness was depicted according to his appearance, thereafter known as the Auspicious Image.\n\nThis abbey now stands as the foremost *Difei* blessed land under heaven. In the time of Gao Xin, Zhan Shanggong attained the Dao and ascended as an immortal. During the Jin dynasty, Magistrate Xu explored this site, built a dwelling to cultivate the truth, and both father and son achieved the Dao, ascending together as immortals; the cinnabar well remains to this day. In the Liang dynasty, Tao Yinju sought out these traces and erected the Zhaozhen Terrace, where he compiled the sacred texts of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements.\n\nDuring the *Kaiyuan* era of the Tang, Master Li Xuanjing, the Daoist preceptor of Emperor Xuanzong, petitioned the court and was granted gold and silk. On the foundation of the Zhaozhen Terrace, he built the Hall of the Auspicious Image. Nearly five hundred years have passed since then, and the hall and its Auspicious Image were both constructed by the Tang people, making this an ancient Daoist sanctuary, unmatched on Mount Mao.\n\nIn the third year of the *Daguan* era of the present dynasty, on the thirteenth day of the fourth month, a kitchen-attendant Daoist named Liang Wuzhen drew water from the Nurturing Dragon Pond before the hall at dawn. Suddenly, a purple cloud enveloped the area, and in an instant, a feather-robed figure appeared—his bushy brows and hoary head framed a long, snow-white beard. Riding a white horse, he descended from the sky. Liang gazed in astonishment, for his appearance matched the hall’s refined image exactly. Liang hastily prostrated himself in reverence. The Most High said: *\"I dwell in the Supreme Clarity realm, but have descended to this numinous altar. Moved by your diligent service and devotion to the Dao, though you have yet to encounter its truth, I now bestow upon you the* Jiaju Tian Tong Huming Miaojing *(‘Augmented Scripture of the Heavenly Youth’s Wondrous Protection of Life’). Recite it with single-minded focus, perform meritorious deeds in the world, and the Dao shall be yours to attain.\"*\n\nLiang bowed to receive the compassionate instruction. As he looked up, the sagely immortal remounted his horse, which neighed as it soared into the void. That year, the land yielded lingzhi mushrooms, a single root with many stems. From then on, Liang abstained from grains, his spirit and countenance transformed. Once an ordinary, unlettered man, he could now recite and write scriptures, understanding all with clarity. He foretold fortune and misfortune with divine accuracy. Three days before his ascension, he inscribed twenty-four talismans and cast them into the pond. Thereafter, those afflicted with illness who entered the mountain to seek its water were cured in countless numbers. Devotees of the Dao venerated him morning and night, and whatever they sought through sincere prayer was granted without fail.\n\nI have once read the *Annals of the Primordial Sage* and thus recorded the origins of this image and the traces of its divine responses, to enlighten those who come after.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Fu Xiao, Grand Master of Illuminating Truth and Abbot of Mount Mao, in the *Shaoxing Jiazi* year.",
