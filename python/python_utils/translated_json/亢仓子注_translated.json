  "full_translation": "The Kangxi Emperor’s *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Annotations on Master Kàngcāng*\nBy Hé Càn of the Tang Dynasty\n*Chapter One: \"The All-Encompassing Dao\"*\n[\"The heart merges with emptiness’s utmost, virtue penetrates the mysterious; achievements align with the four seasons, and the common people transform of themselves.\"]\n\nMaster Kàngcāng [the character *cāng* (倉) derives from *chuān* (川) atop *fā* (發), as glossed by Shǐ Gǔ: *zǐ* (子) is an honorific for a person] dwelled at the foot of Mount Yǔ [the character *sān* (叁) is an ancient form of *sān* (三), a numeral] for three years [the character *nián* (年) combines *hé* (禾) and *qiān* (千), signifying grain’s ripening, hence a harvest cycle; commonly written as *nián* (年). Mount Yǔ, as recorded in the *Yǔ Gòng* of the *Book of Documents*, lies in Xúzhōu. The *Canon of Shùn* states that Gǔn was executed at Mount Yǔ, which lies in the eastern marches, later part of the state of Lǔ, south of Mount Yán. Zhuāngzǐ cites this passage as \"dwelling north at Mount Léilěi,\" referring to this same mountain].\n\nThe local customs knew no plague or pestilence, and the harvests were repeatedly abundant [where sages and worthies reside, Heaven bestows its blessings, sparing the people from disease and ensuring bumper crops; *réng* (仍) denotes frequent repetition]. The people whispered among themselves: \"When Kàngcāng first arrived, we thought little of him [the character *xiān* (鲜) derives from *huǒ* (火) and *rán* (肰), meaning \"to burn,\" here used as a grammatical particle akin to *rán* (然), though not identical]. Now we find him strange indeed [they marveled at his empty heart and tranquil demeanor, devoid of worldly concerns]. Daily, we find ourselves lacking, yet yearly, we have surplus. Could he be a sage?\" [Having witnessed his beneficence, they suspected him of sagacity.] \"Why not enthrone him as our lord, erect ancestral temples, and establish altars for the gods of soil and grain?\" [The character *hū* (虖) is commonly written as *hū* (乎), a grammatical particle; *hé* (盍) means \"why not.\" They wished to elevate him as ruler, build ancestral shrines, and establish altars for the gods of soil and grain, offering sacrifices and serving him as their sovereign.]\n\nHearing this, Kàngcāng’s countenance showed displeasure. His disciples Yǎn and Chuò approached to inquire [Yǎn and Chuò were Kàngcāng’s followers; wishing to understand his thoughts, they sought his counsel]. Kàngcāng said: \"I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a humble abode, while the people, wild and unrestrained, know not where to turn [the character *rú* (如) is an ancient form of *wǎng* (往). The perfected person’s heart is free of cares, akin to a corpse, living in quiet solitude within a humble dwelling. The people, admiring him, turn toward him, yet their devotion arises not from true understanding].\"\n\n\"Now, the people of Yǔ, fathers and sons, whisper among themselves, offering me sacrificial vessels—are they not making me their target?\" [They secretly discussed honoring him with sacrificial vessels, turning him into a mark for veneration.] \"This is why I am displeased, for it contradicts the words of Lǎo Dān [Lǎo Dān said: 'I do nothing, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people prosper; I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves.' Now, the opposite has occurred, hence his displeasure].\"\n\nYǎn and Chuò replied: \"Not so. A shallow puddle, though vast, cannot restore its body to a fish, while the newt arrogates its domain [the character *wéi* (□) is pronounced *wéi* (为). Eight *chǐ* make a *xún*; twice a *xún* make a *cháng*. A *wū* (污) is a pool; *huán* (还) means \"to return.\" The *ní* (鲵) is a small fish with legs; *zhì* (制) means \"to dominate\"]. A mound of six or seven *chǐ* cannot shelter a great beast, while the fox claims its auspices [six *chǐ* make a *bù*; seven *chǐ* make a *rèn*. *Fāng* (防) means \"ominous\"; *xiáng* (祥) means \"auspicious.\" Just as shallow waters cannot contain a great fish, nor a small mound hide a large beast, so too must one of Kàngcāng’s virtue be granted ample emolument].\"\n\n\"Moreover, to honor the worthy and employ the capable, to incline toward goodness and pursue benefit—this has been the practice since the time of Yáo and Shùn. How much more so for the people of Yǔ? Master, you should accept their offerings.\"\n\nKàngcāng exclaimed: \"Ah! Come here! [The exclamation *xī* (嘻) expresses surprise; dismayed by their failure to grasp his intent, he sighed and called them closer, wishing to instruct them on loftier matters.] You two—do you understand? [Referring to Yáo and Shùn—do they truly comprehend?] The beast that fits in a carriage, once isolated from the mountains, is ensnared by nets and traps. The fish that swallows a boat, once adrift from the waters, is tormented by ants and mole crickets. Thus, birds and beasts seek the heights, while fish and turtles crave the depths [the character *tū* (突) in *shēn* (湥) is an ancient form of *shēn* (深), the opposite of *qiǎn* (浅)]. For one who preserves his form and life, to conceal himself is to desire nothing more than profound obscurity.\" [The character *hán* (函) means \"to contain\"; *jiè* (介) means \"isolated.\"]\n\n\"[The character *yuǎn* () means 'profound obscurity.'] I shall tell you this: the root of great chaos lies precisely in the space between Yáo and Shùn. Even if it persists for a thousand generations, there will surely come a time when men devour one another. [Events may begin in success but end in failure, start with fortune but conclude in misfortune—how can one be certain? Thus, Yáo and Shùn’s abdication in favor of virtue became a fleeting glory, yet their legacy gave rise to usurpation and regicide in later ages. As Zhuāngzǐ said: Yáo and Shùn’s abdication led to Dì Kuài’s abdication and ruin; Tāng and Wǔ’s contention for the throne brought kingship, while Bái Gōng’s contention brought annihilation—such are the consequences. Only those who do not establish a reputation for virtue leave no trace for others to emulate or covet.]\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Nánzǐ Róngzhī’s expression changed abruptly; he shifted his knees on the mat and said, \"I, Chū, have lived long under the turning of the heavens—how should I entrust my legacy to these words?\" [Róngzhī, also called Chū, is the Nányōng Chǔ of Zhuāngzǐ. Having heard such lofty principles, he suddenly altered his countenance, drew his knees closer on the mat, and begged for instruction with reverence.]\n\nKàng Cāngfáng replied, \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not rebel against the Way. [The character *bèi* () is an ancient form of *bèi* (悖), meaning 'disorder' or 'perversity.'] If your thoughts and cares churn ceaselessly like this, you may reach the end of your years without attaining this truth. [To 'churn ceaselessly' is to move without rest. Preserving one’s form and embracing life without engaging in restless thought, abiding in emptiness and stillness—this is how the Dao naturally dwells within. By such means, one may reach this truth before the end of one’s years.] Though my talent is slight and insufficient to transform the age, why do you not journey south to consult my teacher, Dān? [Dān is the given name of Lǎozǐ.]\"\n\nKàng Cāngfáng then dismissed Róngzhī Chū, shedding the customs of the vulgar world and ascending like a dragon, transforming amidst the heavens. [To 'dismiss' is to send away. Shedding the customs of the vulgar world, he withdrew and wandered like a dragon, ascending and descending with the times.]\n\nWater’s nature is clarity, yet when mud disturbs it, it cannot remain clear. Man’s nature is longevity, yet when external things agitate it, it cannot endure. [To 'disturb' is to disrupt. Human nature is to live long, but when external things disturb it, one cannot fulfill one’s natural lifespan.] External things exist to nourish one’s nature, yet the deluded of this age often use their nature to nourish external things, unaware of what is light and what is heavy. [Clothing and food nourish one’s nature and cannot be lacking for even a day, yet the deluded harm their nature in pursuit of external things. The more they accumulate, the more their nature is injured, not realizing that nature is weighty while external things are light—a complete inversion.]\n\nThus, the sage’s approach to sounds, colors, and flavors is this: if they benefit one’s nature, he takes them; if they harm one’s nature, he discards them—this is the way to preserve one’s nature. [The character *wàn* (防) is an ancient form of *wàn* (万), meaning 'ten thousand' or 'myriad.'] A man who takes up a bow and shoots at a single target never fails to hit it, yet when myriad things are clearly arrayed before him, he never fails to wound his life. [To 'discard' is to cast away. To 'take up' is to grasp. A 'target' is the mark one shoots at.]\"\n\nThus, when myriad things are in tumultuous disarray, the sage’s regulation of them preserves their Heavenly nature. [The sage restrains the myriad things to prevent injury to one’s nature and preserve the celestial truth.] When Heaven is preserved, the spirit is preserved; one whose spirit is preserved moves without deliberation yet penetrates all, plans without contrivance yet accords with all. His essence illumines without bound, his will congeals throughout the cosmos, his virtue resembles that of Heaven and Earth. [The character *dì* () is an ancient form of *dì* (地), ‘earth,’ composed of ** (soil) and *tuàn* (phonetic, identical to *fáng* 埅).] Above, he is a sovereign yet remains unarrogant; below, he is a commoner yet feels no distress—this is called the man of complete Dao. [One whose spirit is whole overflows with wisdom and resolve; his will and qi congeal throughout the cosmos, his virtue of encompassing and sustaining equal to that of Heaven and Earth. Though noble as the Son of Heaven or humble as a commoner, he does not alter his resolve with changes in fortune.]\n\nHis mind is level and upright, undisturbed by external things—this is called purity, and purity endures. [The character *zé* (□) is an ancient form of *zé* (则), ‘principle,’ composed of *dǐng* (鼎) and *dāo* (刀).] His clarity is luminous and enduring; his emptiness is empty, and the Dao is complete within him. Qin Yi died, and Kanggeng Fang wept for him. [Qin Yi was an ancient man of the Dao, likely a friend of Laozi.] His disciple asked, “Everyone in the world dies—why do you weep, Master?” [The disciple acted as a servant. Death and life are the constant Way of ancient and modern times; the enlightened man rests in this and does not weep—this would be proper.] Kanggeng Fang replied, “Everyone in the world weeps—how could I not weep?” [He wept in accord with things, yet though he wept, it was not true weeping.] His disciple asked, “Those who weep must feel sorrow—why do you show no grief, Master?” [未始 means ‘never yet.’ Ordinary people weep with sorrow and pain; though the Master wept, no sorrow was visible—dare I ask the reason?] Kanggeng Fang said, “In all beneath Heaven, I have no one with whom to share joy—where would I find sorrow? [Where there is joy, there must be sorrow—this is the common human condition. The enlightened man, seeing the great view, has no distinctions of near or far; since he does not share in joy, he has no cause for sorrow.]”\n\nTo shed the earth is to become water; to shed water is to become qi; to shed qi is to become emptiness; to shed emptiness is to become the Dao. [蜕 means ‘to molt’ or ‘shed.’ To shed the earth is to become water; to shed water is to become qi; to shed qi is to become emptiness; to shed emptiness is to become the Dao—this is like the perfected man who is not bound by emotions of sorrow or joy, thus attaining the ultimate.] Emptiness is the body of the Dao; stillness is the foundation of the Dao; principle is the warp of the Dao; discernment is the weft of the Dao. [The perfected man who can be empty and still, who possesses principle and discernment, can thereby unite with the form and body of the Dao, knowing its warp and weft.] The Dao preserves the spirit; virtue expands one’s capacity; ritual equalizes all; the myriad things nourish the body. [These four all sustain the body and cannot be lacking even for a moment.]\n\nThose who favor white things soil them with black; those who favor black things soil them with white—how then can I know what in the world is truly pure or defiled? Thus, I do not adhere to the purity or defilement of things. [The character *hēi* (□) means ‘black.’] The dim-sighted see yellow as red and green as black—how can I, who am now called one who knows white from black, know what in the world is the true color? Thus, I do not flee from the colors of things. [瞀 means ‘blurred vision’; 黈 means ‘yellow’; 赪 means ‘red.’ Those with blurred vision cannot see clearly, mistaking yellow for red and green for black—just as ordinary people cling to purity and defilement. Even a great sage cannot correct this, so one does not generate notions of purity or defilement or flow with the colors of the multitude.]\n\nThose who love wealth excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love horses excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love books excessively do not see other things as lovable—how then can I know what in the world is truly lovable or detestable? Thus, I do not see things as worthy of attachment. Nothing can disturb my true nature. [The character *zhēn* (真) means ‘true’ or ‘authentic.’]\n\nChen Huai-Jun Liu dispatched his grandee Dao to conduct a diplomatic visit to Lu. [Chen Huai-Jun is the posthumous name; Liu is the given name. Dao is the name of the grandee.] Shu Sun Qing said privately, [Shu Sun is his clan name, which had long served as a minister of Lu,] “Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?” [The sage refers to Confucius.] The grandee of Chen asked, “How can one clearly demonstrate his sagacity?” Shu Sun Qing replied, “He can set aside the mind and employ the form.” [The sagely realm transcends the ordinary and cannot be fathomed by common sentiment. One merely sees him handling worldly affairs with ease and thus mistakenly deems him a sage—how could they know the source of his sagacity?]\n\nThe grandee of Chen said, “Though my humble state is small, it too has a sage, different from the one of whom you have heard.” “Who is this sage?” asked Shu Sun Qing. The grandee of Chen replied, “There is one named Kang Cang-Pi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan.” [Among his disciples, he was most eminent, hence it is said he ‘fully attained.’] “Can he use his ears to see and his eyes to hear?” [The ancient character for *see* is composed of *eye* and *show* as phonetic. The ancient character for *hear* is composed of *ear* and *ren* as phonetic.]\n\nDuke Ding heard of this and found it extraordinary. He sent the Shu Sun clan to return the visit and to present Kang Cang-Pi with the rites due to a high minister. When Kang Cang-Pi arrived, he was received as a guest in the secondary hall. [The secondary hall was the next chamber to the duke’s main hall.] The Duke of Lu spoke humbly to inquire of him. Kang Cang-Pi said, “I can see without using my ears and hear without using my eyes. It is not that I can alter the functions of ears and eyes; rather, what they report is excessive.”\n\nThe Duke said, “How can this be? You have greatly astonished me. What is your Way? I truly wish to learn it.” Kang Cang-Pi replied, “My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind harmonizes with my qi, my qi harmonizes with my spirit, and my spirit harmonizes with nothingness. There is no intermediary between them. Though distant as the eight wilds beyond, it is as near as the space between my eyebrows and eyelashes. Whatever comes to me, I must know it, yet I know it not. This is not what my seven apertures, hands, and feet perceive, nor what my six viscera, five organs, and heart contemplate—it is self-knowing alone.” [When mind and form dissolve into union, spirit and qi merge in profound accord, utterly forgetting and becoming one with the Dao. Only then does the mind become still and the will ever more far-reaching; the spirit grows ever more silent, yet its illumination ever more radiant. Principles reach their utmost and naturally become clear; without thought, one attains profound insight. Who but the utmost sage and utmost spirit could achieve this? This is indeed the essential mystery of the numinous and true, the subtlest wonder of the profound Dao.]\n\n**Chapter Two: Employing the Dao**\n\nEarth cannot be trusted; people cannot be trusted; the mind cannot be trusted—only the Dao can be trusted. How could worthy rulers and outstanding scholars know this?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted spirits and his ministers, yet he neglected the Dao. Spirits seized his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou also trusted spirits and his ministers, yet he did not reverently follow the Dao. Spirits seized his state and bestowed it upon Zhou. [The character *yu* means ‘to rely upon.’ *Zu* means ‘ancestral lord.’ Xia Jie and Yin Zhou indulged in excess and arrogance, believing themselves to possess the people and mandate from Heaven above. They acted with utter cruelty, wantonly giving free rein to their violence without cultivating the Dao. Thus, Heaven seized their states and granted them to Tang and Wu.]\n\nNow, the indolent farmer trusts the earth to truly produce the hundred grains, yet if he does not exert effort in the Dao of farming, the earth will pilfer his harvest, leaving his fields overgrown and barren. [The indolent farmer trusts the earth to yield grain but does not diligently plow and weed, allowing weeds to overrun the fields, so he cannot reap the fruits of his labor.]\n\nThe Marquis of Qi trusted human nature, yet his sense of deference and yielding was unclear regarding the Dao. He entrusted his entire domain to others, who in truth were rapacious and seized his state. [Duke Jian of Qi trusted human nature but lacked clarity in deference and yielding, and was assassinated by Chen Heng. Others took his state, their rapacity likened to the owl’s greed.]\n\nGenerally, those who do not cultivate the Dao and instead follow their own minds as teachers, pursuing desires with fervor, will invite calamities and illnesses, inciting strife that harms the body and shortens life—thus the mind becomes the enemy of the self. [When people follow their own minds without adhering to sagely teachings, desires blaze fiercely, and a hundred misfortunes gather. This is the mind harming the body, for *peng* means ‘to gather,’ and *xin* means ‘to move.’ *Qiang* means ‘to harm.’]\n\nThus it is said: only the Dao can be trusted. [The Dao is vast and unobstructed, serene and untroubled, free from defilement. If one can empty the mind and return to the Dao, body and life will be secure.]\n\nWithout the Dao, the earth and its boundaries cannot endure for long. [Heaven attains unity and becomes clear; earth attains unity and becomes tranquil.]\n\nThe common people cannot be pacified without the worthy; the myriad affairs cannot be harmonized without talent. [The worthy and talented all employ the Dao to order things.]\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not display their use of it. Their blessings spread abundantly, and their achievements return to nothingness. [Silently they accomplish and subtly they aid the people, who say, \"It is natural.\"]\n\nTheir spirit flows freely, their undertakings flourish, their virtue is excellent, and their blessings endure. [Flowing freely means the spirit and principle are unimpeded; virtue and undertakings flourish; accumulated goodness is profound, and blessings flow to later generations.]\n\nTo know and distinguish is called *shì*; to know without distinguishing is called the Dao. *Shì* is for ordering people; the Dao is for pacifying them. [To analyze and discern things, guiding people to abandon evil and pursue goodness, is how one orders them. To embrace harmony, emptiness, and tranquility, without praise or blame, is how one pacifies and stabilizes the restless.]\n\nThe way of the farmer is to rise at cockcrow, bear the sun’s burden, toil and sweat, and only rest at midnight. [Cockcrow is the dawn when the rooster crows. Midnight is the middle of the night. Bearing the sun means laboring under its exposure. *Jǐn* means \"barely.\"]\n\nTo stoop and gather, to reach and grasp, to sharpen one’s intent like an awl, to strain one’s thoughts like a rope, to concentrate one’s essence in pursuit of profit—this is the way of the merchant and shopkeeper.\n\nTo swallow qi, to nourish the spirit, to govern one’s thoughts, to cast off cares, to transcend the distant, to ascend lightly, to refine the essence of the sun, and to forge one’s nature into immortality—this is the way of the lofty scholar. [Swallowing qi refers to embryonic breathing and the fivefold regulation of the teeth. *Gǔ* means \"to nourish.\" *Zǎi* means \"to govern.\" *Rì jīng* means \"to absorb the essence of the sun.\" *Liàn* means \"to refine and ascend as an immortal.\"]\n\nTo master one’s emotions and correct one’s intentions, to devote one’s will entirely to one’s lord, to measure and weigh affairs, to forget sleep in pursuit of plans, and to render service in one’s office—this is the way of the minister. [To focus one’s emotions and rectify one’s thoughts, to dedicate one’s will to the lord one serves, to follow principle in measuring and weighing, and to render merit in the office one holds—this is the way of the minister.]\n\nTo purify the heart, to reduce desires, to examine and verify one’s closest attendants, and to seek worthy and good men in order to pacify the people—this is the way of the king. [To purify the heart is to diminish cravings. To reduce desires is to be without selfishness. *Jìn xí* refers to close ministers.]\n\nIf each follows the way appropriate to their station and aligns with its principles, neither abandoning their aspirations nor neglecting their duties, and if they tread their paths with steadfastness, this is called \"the realm below possessing the Dao.\" [Farmers and merchants each preserve their occupations; enlightened rulers and worthy ministers each cultivate their ways. Thus, the world is ordered, and all undertakings are stable and secure.]\n\nTo guide the sinews and bones is to preserve the integrity of the body; to cut off emotions and desires is to preserve the spirit; to still one’s speech is to preserve good fortune; to be capable is to preserve one’s capacity. To safeguard these three preservations is called \"the pure and worthy aligning with the Dao.\" The spirit aids those who embody trust and righteousness; the noble man perfects ritual propriety; the petty man harbors knowledge. Those with understanding naturally affirm themselves, and even those without understanding also affirm themselves. Those with the Dao remain serene and silent, and even the dull and slow also remain serene and silent. Things inherently may resemble right yet be wrong, or resemble wrong yet be right. First weeping, then laughter; beginning auspiciously, ending in misfortune. A person may be endearing, yet their talents not so; talents may command respect, yet the person may not be worthy of it. Excessive respect leads to estrangement; excessive closeness leads to disrespect. To be close yet distant, or distant yet close; to show great kindness yet breed resentment. [The character *fǎng* is an ancient form of *ài*, meaning \"love,\" from the heart and the phonetic *wú*.] Too much leads to hatred; some use flattery, some use delay, some use bluntness, some use indirectness—among the hundred affairs, their origins are subtle and must not be unknown. Thus, the wise approach them with caution.\n\nSerenity unites the spirit; emptiness exhausts the mind; silence unites speech; wealth unites the body; understanding the principles of circumstances enables one to harmonize with the Dao. Those of the same Dao support one another; those of the same art envy one another—this is the nature of human feelings. [When emotions are in harmony and there are no demands, people love one another; when there is competition for ability and a desire to excel, they envy one another. Such is the force of circumstances.]\n\nTo be talented yet humble, poor and lowly yet not obsequious, to endure toil without shame, to be wealthy and noble yet respectful and diligent—this may be called possessing virtue.\n\n**Section Three: The Way of Governance**\n\n[To follow Heaven’s decree and issue commands without regard for closeness or distance, all lands converge as one, and all turn to admire and submit.]\n\nPeople have no means to know the ruler except through the movements of the four seasons—cold and heat—and the courses of the sun, moon, and stars. If the ruler is like the movements of the four seasons—cold and heat—and the courses of the sun, moon, and stars, then all living beings, with their blood and qi, will find their proper places and rest in their positions.\n\nMinisters likewise have no means to know their lord except through the lord’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments. If the lord’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments is impartial toward close and distant, worthy and unworthy, then all will exert their strength and be employed according to their abilities.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the realm below is at peace; when trust is lost, the realm below is in peril. When the people toil and exhaust their resources, when their minds are filled with contention and they no longer trust one another—this arises from the government’s lack of impartiality.\n\nThe government’s lack of impartiality is the fault of the officials. The officials’ faults lie in the inconsistency of punishments and rewards. The inconsistency of punishments and rewards stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity. When the ruler is diligent and clear, punishments and rewards are unified; when punishments and rewards are unified, officials uphold the law; when officials uphold the law, governance is proclaimed below; when governance is proclaimed below, each person finds their place and mutual trust is established.\n\nThus, the lack of trust in the realm below stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nKang Cangzi dwelled at Xirang for five years. [Xirang was a place in Zhou.] King Ling dispatched Minister Ji to present a basket of silk and threaded jade. [King Ling was a Zhou king. Minister Ji was a high official of Zhou. *Lù* refers to fine jade. King Ling admired Kang Cangzi’s virtue and sent Minister Ji with gifts of jade and silk to invite him. *Fěi* was the basket used to hold the silk. *Rèn* was the thread used to string the jade.]\n\nHe said, \"I am a shallow and insignificant man, unworthy of my position. Floods and droughts have come unseasonably, and the people suffer hunger and hardship. As the ruler of men, by what means may I avert this?\" [King Ling said, \"I am a shallow and insignificant man, unworthy of my exalted position, and have brought about untimely floods and droughts, causing the people to suffer hunger and hardship. I humbly ask for the method to avert this.\" *Ráng* means \"to ward off.\"]\n\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Floods are the disorder of yin. Yin corresponds to the state’s governance of punishments and the people’s private affairs. [Disorder (*lì*) means chaos. Water is a yin symbol, and yin governs punishments. Water also flows secretly, symbolizing private and hidden matters. If punishments are unjust and private affairs are numerous, then there will be disasters from human affairs.] Drought is the excess of yang. Yang corresponds to the state’s governance of virtue and the people’s excesses. [Drought is a yang symbol, and yang governs virtue. Yang represents brightness and abundance. If the ruler does not cultivate virtue and the people are excessive, then there will be great drought.] You, sir, have encountered floods and droughts. Heaven’s principle is to rectify punishments and cultivate virtue, for officials to be impartial and eliminate private interests, and to be vigilant against excess—thus, the hundred misfortunes will naturally dissipate, and the blessings of the sun will arrive.\" [Kang Cangzi’s name was *Chǔ*. The rest follows this example. This passage is reasonable.]\n\nIn Zheng, there was the *fēngguī* jade tablet of Hu and the *rónggōng* bow of the Rong. [Hu was a state. *Fēngguī* was a large jade tablet.]\n\nThe *rónggōng* bow was also a renowned object. These two items originally belonged to the state of Hu and were later obtained by Zheng.\n\nAt another time, Zheng failed to attend the assembly with Jing. [At other times, the feudal lords of the Yin dynasty called their gatherings *tóng*. Jing was the former name of Chu. At that time, Chu was a major state, and the feudal lords jointly attended the assembly in Chu as the appointed time. Zheng arrived late.] Jing, relying on its strength, demanded, \"You must yield the *fēngguī* jade tablet and the *rónggōng* bow; otherwise, we will bring our troops against you.\" The lord of Zheng was troubled by this and sought an audience with Kang Cangzi, saying, \"The *fēngguī* jade tablet and the *rónggōng* bow were obtained from Hu by our former lord, passed down through generations as treasured heirlooms to display the glory of our lineage. [He was distressed. *Mián* means 'continuous.' *Yì sì* refers to descendants. Our former lord acquired these two items and reverently preserved them, intending to transmit them to posterity as treasures symbolizing our meritorious legacy.] Now, Jing, relying on its might, insists on taking them and threatens military action. Our state is in peril. I wish to offer other jade tablets and bows in their place—what should I do?\" [Other *fēngguī* refers to different jade tablets.]\n\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Let Your Lordship remain calm for now. [He advised the lord to remain composed and not be overwhelmed by fear.] As things stand, [This means 'under the present circumstances.'] Chu also possesses a treasure here. [Kang Cangzi regarded integrity and righteousness as treasures.] If you adorn Chu’s treasure to absolve its guilt, Chu will be unable to do so. [To *shì* means to borrow or defer. If you deceive a great state with counterfeit jade, seeking to temporarily evade punishment through deception, you may delay retribution for a time, but ultimately, you will bring calamity upon yourself, implicate your lord in wrongdoing, and undermine our integrity. Thus, I cannot act in this way.] You must present the genuine items. [He advised the lord of Zheng not to offer substitute jade.]\n\nNow, Jing, on account of a minor transgression, wields its might and punishment, indulging in aggression without justification, thereby exhausting and plundering its allies. Jing will lose the support of the feudal lords in this matter. When the feudal lords hear of this, they will be alarmed and take heed. [The character *bèi* may be superfluous.] They will emulate one another in diligence and clarity, uniting in righteousness at assemblies and shared gatherings. The foundation of Zheng’s survival lies in this. Your Lordship, simply wait—could this not bring fortune?\" [*Qiǎnxiǎn* describes something small in appearance. *Fù* means to rely on. *Chěng* means to indulge.]\n\nThe term *lúnbǐ* means \"to emulate one another,\" while *gū* means \"simply wait.\" Zheng’s delayed tribute was indeed a minor transgression, yet Jing, relying on its strength, sought to indulge its might and punishment, coercing [Zheng] with threats of jade and bows, plundering its allies without virtue. Such greed will surely cost Jing the support of the feudal lords.\n\nAt this juncture, [Zheng] presented the Hu jade and Rong bow, but before they reached Ying [Jing’s capital], the people of Jing heard of [Zheng’s] resolute counsel. They said, \"They heed the teachings of the sage, and their words leave us no grounds to seize these [gifts]. To persist would be unjust before the feudal lords and stir discontent among them.\" Thus, they hastily returned the tribute and treated [Zheng] with greater kindness.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, seeks security and shuns peril, craves honor and detests disgrace. When the people’s desires are fulfilled, they rejoice in peace; when unfulfilled, they suffer in hardship and danger. If a ruler indulges his own desires, the myriad officials and esteemed ministers will all restrain them. When the officials and esteemed ministers restrain their desires, the people—whether poor, exhausting their strength, or rich, exhausting their wealth—lose their proper order. The four classes [scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants] fall into disorder, and none attain their desires. When the people cannot fulfill their desires, they join hands, cling together, flee, hide, drift on the waters, and glean wild fruits to sustain their lives. The officials then pursue and capture them, leading to unbearable hardship and peril, which gives rise to thoughts of rebellion. The state is no longer truly theirs.\n\nDo not covet the populace’s numbers; if you drive them, they will scatter. Do not fortify cities; if you exhaust them, they will grow weary. If taxes are excessive, the impoverished will grow ever poorer. If punishments are inconsistent, the fearful will grow ever more anxious. Prohibitions and laws will proliferate, and the state will tilt toward collapse. If officials are unworthy, leniency and severity will be misapplied. If they contend with the people for profit, deceitful hearts will arise. Thus, the realm becomes rife with deceit, and the ruler’s understanding grows dim. When the ruler is dim, the people are confused. When the people are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to deter. The state becomes volatile and difficult to pacify—all because officials are not properly selected.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully assessing men of talent. If a man’s conduct is esteemed in a village, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in a county, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in a province, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in the state, entrust him with its governance. Only then will there be no hidden talents.\n\nIf a man commits wrongdoing in a village, admonish him. If he does not reform, send him to the county for punishment. If he still does not reform, send him to the state for execution. Thus, no rebellious conduct will persist. If this is done, the people will revere and submit, and no seeds of defiance or disrespect will sprout. This is called \"pacifying the people.\"\n\nOf all the affairs under heaven, none is greater than seeking men of talent. The best way to attract them is through sound governance, and the best governance is that which pacifies the people. Yet when assessing such men by their literary compositions, scarcely four or five in a hundred prove genuine. When judging by their words, perhaps one or two in ten are sincere. But when examining their demeanor, spirit, and bearing, eight or nine in ten will be found true. This is what enlightened kings of successive ages have been able to discern and select.\n\nIf a ruler selects men by their literary skill, ornate and clever compositions will flourish, while plain and sincere ones will vanish. If he selects by eloquence, glib and embellished speech will prevail, while forthright and upright counsel will fade. If he selects by demeanor, those who appear upright but are inwardly corrupt will rise, while those of true integrity will be overlooked. If such errors persist, the more \"worthy\" men are appointed, the more governance will stray; the more decrees are issued, the more the people will be thrown into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest vessel, and the throne the most weighty position. With worthy men, the state is pacified; without them, it falls into chaos. Thus, a ruler must labor to seek the worthy and rest in their employment. Alas! How can one who guards the state and gathers the people not carefully test men of talent?\n\nThe greatest loss of human sentiment lies in the ruler’s failure to attend to it, and nothing is more grievous than miscarriages of justice. A discerning judge may employ various means to resolve disputes: deceit to lure, threats to coerce, empathy to persuade, or punishment to press. Though methods may differ, justice must prevail.\n\nThus, the people will have no cause for gratitude in life or resentment in death. One who governs, appoints officials, and administers justice in this way holds the highest office. In such an age, the people’s sentiments are harmonized, all occupations are respected, and interactions between superiors and inferiors are orderly and stable. The state stands firm as a single household; how could it be shaken? If even one act defies this principle, disorder will arise—how could stability endure?\n\nWhen King [Ping] returned to rectitude and settled in the capital, he made it his duty to seek out the worthy and good. Upon hearing even a single instance of virtue, he would rejoice for days on end. [King Ping succeeded the reigns of You and Li, when the realm was in turmoil and all discipline had collapsed. Thereupon, he restored order, reverted to the right Way, and moved east to Luoyi, where he reformed past errors and devoted himself to seeking wise men. Whenever he heard of even one good deed, his delight would last for days, as he dwelt in the royal city—Luoyi. \"等\" here means \"to obtain.\"]\n\nHis attendants and servants, seeing the king’s joy, repeatedly spoke of great ministers who were exceptionally worthy. Thus passed more than a year. [The attendants and servants were minor officials close to the king. Observing his delight, they flattered him to curry favor.]\n\nThe king said: \"I, alone, am not enlightened in virtue and have made it my duty to seek the worthy and exceptional. Yet I fear that those hidden in the mountains and marshes remain unrecognized. How could I take pleasure in hearing of virtue only to shut myself off from it? In the past, sycophantic servants repeatedly praised those in power, gradually elevating them through the favor of my attendants. I, weak and dull, was unable to discern clearly and could only follow in harmonious compliance. Thus, self-regard and the corruption of virtue grew unchecked, and no timely correction was made. This led to entrenched factions.\" [\"仄媚\" means \"flattery\" or \"obsequiousness.\" \"权任\" refers to powerful ministers. \"阶\" means \"to ascend.\"]\n\nThe king’s weakness and indecision allowed sycophantic underlings to praise powerful ministers, who ascended through the collusion of attendants, collectively shielding one another—claiming I was dim-witted and incapable of discernment. Had I not curbed this, factional entrenchment would have deepened.\n\nThereupon, he cast out three of his closest attendants in the marketplace, [executed and exposed their corpses for all to see, as in ancient times when criminals were punished in the market to be collectively rejected by the people]. He demoted five of the high-ranking officials, [referring to the powerful ministers]. He declared: \"Let no minister ally with inferiors to deceive superiors, cling to office, or flatter to curry favor.\"\n\nWhen the realm heard of this, they praised it as impartial and enlightened. From the west of the Southern Sea, seven states submitted in allegiance. In this era of supreme governance, carriages and robes were plain white, [the color of undyed silk]. Statutes were lenient, prohibitions simple, and the net of laws sparse and broad.\n\nWhen carriages and robes were plain white, people no longer coveted excess. [They did not envy one another.] When statutes were lenient and prohibitions simple, customs knew no taboos. When the net of laws was sparse and broad, offenses were easy to avoid and difficult to commit. Thus, desires became few and subtle, and service [this character combines \"person\" with \"carrying a weapon\" and \"marching,\" conveying the sense of fulfilling duties] was willingly performed. The people delighted in their work, [submitting to and embracing their appointed tasks].\n\nWhen customs knew no taboos, restraint and closure gave way to openness and ease, and joyful exchange flourished. For all that was restrained or closed arose from taboos; when taboos were absent, all could open and expand.\n\nWhen offenses were easy to avoid and difficult to commit, likes and dislikes became distinct, and people guarded virtue and knew shame. To value virtue is to avoid transgression; to know shame is to shun offense.\n\nTo willingly perform service and delight in one’s work is called *shun* (harmonious compliance). To rejoice in exchange and connection is called *he* (harmony). To guard virtue and know shame is called *zheng* (rectitude). The indolent and dissolute cannot surpass the *shun*; the rebellious and unruly cannot surpass the *he*; the deceitful and perverse cannot surpass the *zheng*. *Shun*, *he*, and *zheng*—these three are the foundation of governing a state.\n\nIn the degenerate age of *shuai* (衰), carriages and robes became ornate and cunning, statutes and decrees turned to superstitious prayers, and the net of laws grew biased and perverse. When carriages and robes were ornate and cunning, admiration and emulation spread like wildfire. When statutes and decrees relied on superstitious prayers, taboos multiplied. When the net of laws was biased and perverse, none knew how to escape it.\n\nThus, when admiration and emulation spread like wildfire, people abandoned loyalty and purity, shamed simplicity, and prized ostentation. When taboos multiplied, emotions became obstructed, and superiors and inferiors grew estranged and contentious. When none knew how to escape, slander and flattery flourished, and the masses feared not death.\n\nTo shame simplicity and prize ostentation is called *fu* (frivolity). For superiors and inferiors to grow estranged and contentious is called *se* (obstruction). For the masses to fear not death is called *mao* (recklessness). The truly upright would not serve in a *fu* state; the impartial and forthright would not serve in a *se* state; the capable and talented would not serve in a *mao* state. *Fu*, *se*, and *mao*—these three are the ladder to a state’s ruin.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing (荆) asked about floods, droughts, order, and chaos. Kang Cangzi replied: “Floods and droughts arise from Heaven; order and chaos arise from man. If men are harmonious and the state well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot harm it—such were the cases of Yao and Tang. Thus, the *Zhou’s Rites of Office* states: ‘Man’s strength prevails over the land.’ But if men bring ruin and chaos, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble and collapse—such was the fall of Jie and Zhou. Their destruction was not due to floods or droughts alone.”\n\nThe King of Jing faced north, followed in reverence, and bowed deeply, saying: “Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, allowing me to hear these words.” He then presented Kang Cangzi with ten pairs of fine jade disks as a gift for longevity and bowed to him as *Ya Yin* (Vice Minister), saying: “May my state yet recover?”\n\nKang Cangzi, unable to refuse, spent the night in contemplation, then departed in plain clothes for another land.\n\nIn an era of supreme governance, mountains harbored no false beasts, markets offered no deceptive profits, courts granted no stipends to flatterers, and the state’s resources were managed by men of integrity. Zichan (子产, a minister of Zheng) asked: “How does one obtain such people and foster such pure customs?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “When governance is harsh and oppressive, people grow cunning and deceitful. When governance is simple and unified, people remain pure and honest. Customs follow the shape of state governance as a looper caterpillar conforms to the leaf it clings to. Eat yellow, and the body turns yellow; eat green, and the body turns green. How could it be otherwise?\n\n“When people grow wealthy: levy taxes in due season, and officials remain pure and frugal. When taxes are levied without restraint and officials grow extravagant and indulgent, people grow poor.\n\n“The arrows of Gou Yue, tipped with refined metal and fletched with the feathers of hawks and falcons, strike with the force of a cudgel—yet they differ not from a crude wooden shaft when all choice is absent.”\n\nThe talons of hawks and falcons, the beaks of eagles and owls—these are for striking. As the *Erya* states: “Among the finest products of the southeast is the arrow of Kuaiji.” The land of Gou Yue forges arrowheads from refined metal and fletches them with the feathers of falcons, yet when used for striking, they differ not from a crude wooden shaft—no choice remains.\n\nWhen it comes to sweeping away bandits, contending in battle, displaying martial prowess, and deciding victory, if such arrows are fitted to a powerful crossbow, then at three hundred paces no enemy will stand. The sword *Feijing*, whose might seizes the radiance of the white sun and whose qi surges like purple rainbows—when used to reap grain, it differs not from a sickle blade. Yet when malevolent forces spread their poison, seething like boiling waters, and the sword is wielded in the palm, then within a thousand *li* no evil will linger. Thus, materials have their proper divisions, and uses have their fitting applications; one must simply follow the times in their employment.\n\nIn ancient times, enlightened kings and sagely emperors brought harmony below and peace to all, allowing the myriad things to flourish and all natures to reach their fullest. They followed the times without disturbance. But in later ages, the world below teemed with deceit and villainy, while the upright were few; the frivolous and profit-seeking were many, while those who withdrew in tranquility were rare. The wicked spoke words equal to those of the loyal, their cunning and falsehood confounding truth, making governance untenable.\n\nThus, the people below deceived one another in turn—how lamentable! Laws are made easy to observe yet hard to violate; abuses are remedied by simplifying and unifying commands, eradicating tyranny so that officials dare not pursue private gain. When officials do not pursue private gain, the people grow wealthy. As the *Shi Xing* states: “Calamities are pardoned; amnesties are granted.” But amnesties should not be frequent, for frequent pardons allow the wicked to scheme, and the common people to grow restless. Then the worthy and good become obstructed.\n\nWhen a great criminal is captured, officials, seeking to expand their case, falsely implicate the innocent, dragging in distant connections and forcing confessions out of sequence. By the time an amnesty arrives, the true criminals have already escaped unscathed, leaving only the self-inflicted suffering of the falsely accused. Thus, people devise schemes in turn, officials toil in harsh governance, and none can bring it to an end—all due to the excess of amnesties.\n\nPeople turn to evil and abandon the Way because they know there will be no punishment; they are encouraged to follow the Way and act with righteousness because they know there will be reward. Now, those who abandon the Way and act unrighteously are pardoned, while those who follow the Way and act with righteousness are harmed and go unrewarded. Is it not difficult, then, to guide people toward goodness?\n\nThrough the ages, worthy rulers and outstanding scholars who have examined this discourse have found that those who incur the resentment of the people do not fail to engage with them, nor do those who provoke the wrath of the spirits fail to offer sacrifices. Yet the more cunning and flattery abound, the more the people resent them; the more lavish the sacrifices, the more the spirits grow angry.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Way of the Ruler**\n\nThat which gives birth to things is Heaven; that which nurtures them is man. To nurture what Heaven has given birth to, so that things come to submit—this is called the Son of Heaven. In ancient times, Shun, possessing great virtue, thrice moved and established capitals—this was such a case. The movements of the Son of Heaven serve to preserve the qi of Heaven; this is why officials exist to assist him. Officials exist to preserve life.\n\nHeaven does not govern itself, so the sage acts on Heaven’s behalf to order things. The sage cannot govern alone, so he establishes officials to assist him. The purpose of establishing officials is to nurture things, valuing the preservation of Heaven’s qi and preventing harm. Yet later rulers, deluded, have multiplied offices only to harm life, losing the original purpose of their establishment.\n\nGrass grows dense and rots; trees grow dense and decay; people grow dense and sicken; the state grows dense, and a hundred evils arise together, leading to unrest that cannot be suppressed. This is what is meant by a “dense state”: the ruler’s virtue is not proclaimed below, and the people’s desires do not reach above. Thus, sagely kings employ loyal ministers and upright scholars, ensuring they dare to speak frankly and dispel obstructions.\n\nBy restraining oneself and returning to ritual, the worthy and good will come of their own accord. When the ruler plows and the queen weaves, the common people will naturally transform. From this, it is clear: the worthy and good can be awaited, not sought; those sought are not truly worthy. The common people can be transformed, not punished; punishment without principle is not the Way.\n\nYao was without the toil of rulers, yet the world was at peace; he was without the desires of rulers, yet the people each fulfilled their desires. He was without the position of rulers, yet the world was well-ordered; he was without the heart of rulers, yet the people each followed their hearts. There are those whom the people below love while the ruler does not, and those whom the ruler alone loves while the people below do not. Employing those whom the people below love brings peace to the realm; employing those whom the ruler alone loves brings peril. How can a ruler dare to indulge his own preferences? Alas!\n\nThus, those who value the people below must restrain their emotions—when the sage takes the realm’s peace and peril as their own, desiring the realm’s stability, the ruler must not indulge his loves and hates but curb his private passions. What is meant by \"the people below\"? It is that they possess the power to nurture all things. What is meant by \"possessing states and kingdoms\"? It is that they comprise the multitudes. The state takes the people as its root; when the people are at peace, the state is at peace. Hence, the ruler’s foremost duty is to seek the art of governing the people.\n\nThe world holds myriad things, yet the state’s wealth lies in its multitudes—thus, one must employ the worthy to assist oneself. Jade is difficult to discern because of strange stones; gold is difficult to discern because of brass. Strange stones resemble jade, and brass resembles gold—just as the treacherous appear upright externally but harbor wickedness within, making them hard to distinguish.\n\nNow, if one covers a sparrow’s wings with those of a falcon, the vision of the clear-sighted becomes obscured. Only when the keen-eyed observe closely do they recognize it as a sparrow.\n\nNow, petty persons often recite the classics and medical texts, or study strange arts and persuasive rhetoric, and are then clad in blue and purple robes of office. The foolish, gazing upon them, see only the robes; but the discerning, gazing upon them, recognize them as petty persons.\n\nThus, when a ruler is truly enlightened, to judge men by their words is order; to judge men by their talents is order; to judge men by their conduct is order. When a ruler is benighted, to judge men by their words is chaos; to judge men by their talents is chaos; to judge men by their conduct is chaos. The enlightened ruler, judging men by both words and conduct, achieves perfect order; the benighted ruler, judging men by both words and conduct, achieves only chaos.\n\nThe sage in employing men guards against the merit of what is heard, the merit of what is seen, and the merit of what can be spoken. Then the people flourish and govern themselves. In an age of worthies, names are not displayed, merits are not proclaimed, abilities are not vaunted—yet hidden achievements and subtle aid bring about a profound and unobstructed order. Traces of fame do not arise, and none vie for eminence; thus the sage values such an age.\n\nIf a ruler prizes the merit of what is heard, then petty men below will traffic in goods and chase profit to buy reputation. If he prizes the merit of what is seen, then petty men below will exaggerate their forms and flaunt strange arts to vie for advancement. If he prizes the merit of what can be spoken, then petty men below will practice glibness and polish their words to adorn their speech. When petty men below buy reputation, vie for advancement, and adorn their speech to gain access, governance collapses.\n\nAll rulers know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest the man who clarifies their faults. A mirror clarifies their appearance—its merit is slight; a man clarifies their faults—his merit is great. To know the slight and lose the great is to be utterly deluded.\n\nAlas! If a ruler purifies his heart and reduces his affairs, his ministers will be reverent and frugal, guarding their duties, and great peace will naturally arise. Yet some find this difficult to accept—how can I fathom why? If the ruler’s heart, that inch of ground, is benighted and indecisive, then the myriad things within the four seas, both moving and still, will all lose their proper Way.\n\nThose who judge men by ear and eye have many officials and chaotic governance. Those who judge men by heart and thought have few officials and clear governance. Thus, in an age that follows the Way, the ruler seeks talents unseen and unheard; in a perilous and degenerate age, the ruler prizes talents seen and heard. Alas! How can rulers know this? When men are judged by ear and eye, all vie to snatch reputation; when men are judged by heart and thought, all remain tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue. When officials are tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue, they transform without speaking; when officials vie to snatch reputation, punishments fail to deter them. Does the ruler not know this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to flourish, the hundred officials of the court, though some are short and some tall, some ugly and some fair, some gentle and some stern, some upright and some flawed—though their words and appearances may seem at odds—when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all serve the state with forthrightness unmarred by resentment, demotion unmarred by alarm, and counsel that hits the mark without deviating from principle. Thus, Heaven is not confounded in its seasons, Earth does not fail in its bounty, the people do not disorder their affairs, spirits and gods lend their aid, and the barbarians are pacified, all things harmonized and nurtured.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish, the hundred officials of the court, though their appearances are fair, their complexions harmonious, their words suave, their movements refined—though their words and appearances may seem cordial—when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are bent on competing for position. Hearing of the strange, they are startled; seeing the unusual, they are alarmed; they scheme and envy, slander and obstruct the Way. Thus, Heaven sends forth calamities, Earth brings forth monstrosities, men commit violent deeds, spirits sow misfortune, the Rong and Di invade, and chaos multiplies. The myriad things fail to transform, human effort is not diminished, yet officials achieve success and governance flourishes—such are the loyal and worthy ministers.\n\nThose who squander wealth, harass the people, endanger offices, and hastily produce fleeting gains to curry favor with the ruler, heedless of the disasters they leave for the state—such are the treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, offices are filled by the right men; in an age without governance, men fill the offices. Zilu asked Confucius, saying, \"One who is honored in death yet serves men—what is in his heart?\" The Master replied, \"Let his heart be nothing if not impartial. Let his appearance be nothing if not harmonious. Let his words be nothing if not upright. Impartiality does not seek to be revealed; harmony does not seek to be mixed; uprightness does not seek to offend.\" The ancients, in their pure diligence, ordered the state and rectified governance; today, in their pure diligence, they cultivate themselves and polish their names. Those who order the state and rectify governance arrange affairs with clarity, each in its proper place, moving in accord with the times and conforming to the greater whole. Those who cultivate themselves and polish their names arrange affairs with clarity, yet remain distant and unconnected, bound by petty details. Thus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, it aligns things to their proper place; when the heart takes mere affairs as its master, it misaligns things from their proper place.\n\nWhen affairs become the master, it is private sentiment. \"To align\" means to clash. Ministers in high positions do not admonish; those in low positions are not impartial and do not merit their emoluments. When the ruler lacks solemn reverence, great ministers cannot manifest trustworthiness, and lesser ministers do not fulfill their offices. In such a court, the talented are not necessarily loyal, and the loyal are not necessarily talented. Ministers need not worry about disloyalty—it is fitting that they be loyal, yet the ruler does not trust them. They need not worry about distrust—it is fitting that they be trusted, yet they cannot act.\n\nThe highest type of person attains their nature and governs below with principle. The middling type of person attains their nature and governs below with clarity. The enlightened ruler employs the highest type of person by entrusting them with authority and granting them the freedom to act as they deem fit. The highest type of person refers to the worthy and good—impartial, upright, and free from private bias. When placed in office, they are trusted and delighted in, correcting and assisting. Though they may exercise authority with flexibility, they always return to rectitude.\n\nWhen employing the middling type of person, one must set standards for their achievements and demonstrate rewards and punishments. The middling type refers to those with skills and abilities—when they see goodness, they emulate it; when they see evil, they are stained by it. Thus, the ruler uses rewards and punishments to control them.\n\n**Virtuous Way, Chapter Six**\n*\"Restrain the self and return to ritual, and the worthy and good will come of their own accord.\"*\n\nThe reason the worthy and good are frequently sought yet seldom arrive, difficult to advance yet easy to retreat, is not that they guard their lives and avoid death, nor that they are loyal yet the ruler does not trust them. Those who know themselves to be talented and discerning are outwardly cautious yet inwardly free from anxiety. Among the multitude, they are harmonious and upright without undue familiarity; the more they are respected, the more distant they become. They depart without resentment, and when impoverished or distressed, they accept it as fate and console themselves. When honored or successful, they restrain themselves by the Dao. Some judge them by their appearance and deem them worthy; others judge them by their voice and deem them worthy. Yet when examining their spirit and discernment, one may find them falling short of expectations. When the worthy are employed...\n\nWhen they enter court, they offer subtle remonstrance and praise; when they withdraw, they maintain reverent silence. In their duties, they are diligent and discerning; in their households, they are frugal and guarded. (Subtle remonstrance refers to admonishing the ruler’s faults; praise refers to extolling the ruler’s virtues. Reverent silence denotes quiet prudence. Discerning means managing affairs. Guarded refers to vigilance.)\n\nWhen they remain unappointed, they conceal their persons to the end, hide their knowledge in their gaze, and seal their words in their mouths. They eat their fill, walk at ease, and cultivate their own goodness alone. They remain steadfast without resentment, and the wise do not doubt them, nor do those of keen perception doubt others. Among those who recognize them are men of insight: though their conduct is perilous, their countenance remains unaltered; though their words are modest, their principles cannot be uprooted. (This describes those who, in a corrupt age, do not waver in their resolve—though their conduct is endangered, their demeanor remains composed; though their words are humble, their reasoning stands firm.)\n\nGenerally, the worthy do not declare themselves worthy. (Those who boast of their own merits achieve nothing and are not truly worthy.) Their efficacy is seen in office; their merit is evident in governance. (By examining their official conduct and observing their actions, the worthy and the unworthy can be distinguished.)\n\nIn times of great peace, men of the highest caliber apply their discernment; those of middling ability exhaust their endurance; and the petty exert their strength. There was once a man of Qi named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, and whose conduct could have stood alone. (Revitalizing refers to strengthening Qi. Standing alone denotes a virtue so lofty and unshakable that none can topple it.) He was filial and respectful to his parents, reverent and dutiful in his village. Though he lived in poverty with nothing to support them, he traveled far on the strength of his trustworthiness and integrity—yet for a long time, wherever he went, he found few who harmonized with him. Some were deceived by those who flattered and fawned in their time. (Wherever he went, he found little accord. Few harmonized with him.)\n\nHere the man, staff in hand and feet weary, inquired of Kang Cangfang, saying: “I have heard that the perfected forget emotion—(the perfected empty their hearts and unite with the Dao in embodiment, thus forgetting emotion)—while the common folk do not employ emotion—(the common folk, dull in wisdom and strength, cannot rightly use emotion). Those who preserve emotion devote themselves to instruction and revere trustworthiness and integrity. (This refers to the middling sort. Those who preserve emotion hold trustworthiness and integrity in highest esteem.) Yet I know not what I can accomplish. (What can one do? To practice trustworthiness and integrity in person yet find little accord wherever one goes—one knows not what one’s ability may achieve.)\n\nSome accept what is untrustworthy as trustworthy; (the world contains those who take others’ untrustworthiness for trustworthiness.) some, though trustworthy, are not seen as trustworthy; (some possess true trustworthiness yet are not perceived as trustworthy—yet still they deem themselves trustworthy.) some diligently admire integrity and are called men of integrity—though integrity is not their nature. (There are those whose nature is not integrity, yet who are praised as men of integrity for their admiration of it.)\n\nMen of trustworthiness and integrity often stand alone in adversity, retreating in obscurity. How can one guard against the times and the prevailing principles of instruction?”\n\nKang Cangfang lowered his head and smoothed his lapel, then raised his face with a sigh and leapt up in song: “When the times are bright, trustworthiness and integrity flourish—(the times are bright when the ruler embodies the Dao. When the ruler embodies the Dao, trustworthiness and integrity flourish.) When the times are dark, trustworthiness and integrity lie hidden—(the times are dark when the ruler is benighted. When the ruler is benighted, ritual and integrity withdraw into concealment.)\n\nBrightness and darkness, flourishing and concealment—all rush in confusion. Whom would I favor? How fleeting, how inscrutable the drift of things! (All is in tumult. How could I show partiality? The times know order and disorder, thus the proper course knows action and withdrawal. When bright, one flourishes with the times; when dark, one withdraws with the times. Flowing with the current, following fate—how could there be partiality? Yet now you ask me, so I know not what you mean.)\n\nTo move with one’s true nature and find no response in things—this is true failure. When the true fails to move, the Dao is obstructed. (Trustworthiness and integrity are the function of the true nature; the true is the root of the true nature.) When the Dao is obstructed, the superior man then retreats in obscurity, awaiting the moment when integrity may yet be put into practice. (There are times when action is possible.) Yet when no such moment comes, there is nothing to be done.”\n\nWhen times are prosperous or adverse, none endure forever—there are moments for action, and moments when action is impossible. When action knows its course and withdrawal, none can be employed forever.\n\nDuke Ji asked, \"From where do worthy talents fail to arrive?\" Kang Cang replied, \"Virtue and uprightness may be awaited, not sought; talent lies in seeking, not in absence. If the ruler is tranquil and great ministers enforce the law without shielding favorites, nor blocking the path of those below, then worthy men will come of themselves, seeking employment. When worthy men are employed, within the Four Seas all see clearly with bright eyes, hear keenly with clear ears, and rest with open hearts, free from gloom. The ruler achieves completion, the land attains peace, all things refine and transform, and spirits lose their numinous power. Thus it is said: virtue and uprightness may be awaited, not sought.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and enlightened, and great ministers seek scholars with harmony and reason, then men of magnanimous conduct, vast integrity, impartiality, and steadfastness will arrive. If the ruler is harsh and exacting, and great ministers seek scholars with impatience and haste, then men of crooked hearts, cunning responses, who destroy integrity and break the Dao, will arrive. If the ruler is suspicious and jealous, and great ministers seek scholars with artful compliance, then men of strange lineages, unusual names, obsequious flattery, and bizarre arts will arrive. If the ruler esteems himself as worthy, and great ministers seek scholars to secure their positions, then men of excessive ornamentation, chasing reputation, greed, impurity, and superficial elegance will arrive. If the ruler is indecisive, and great ministers seek scholars with devious flattery, then men of inner loyalty and outer perversity, with venomous natures and harmonious words, will arrive. Thus it is said: talent lies in seeking, not in absence.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor obtained Chang Xian, Feng Hou, and Rong Qi—three ministers of the Yellow Emperor. King Tang of Shang obtained Yi Yin, and King Xuan of Zhou, in his revival, obtained Fu Shen and Shen Bo. Duke Huan of Qi obtained Ning Qi. All these rulers embodied the Dao, advanced with benevolence, spread luminous sagacity, martial virtue, thoughtful harmony, radiant brilliance, magnanimity, and flourishing uprightness, so that the multitude of worthies sought employment—not obtained through meticulous selection.\"\n\n---\n\nThe term \"meticulous selection\" refers to scrutiny. Duke Ji said: \"It is said that worthies do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord—yet are there not also the unworthy who do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Indeed, those who are unworthy and do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord are certainly many. When the ruler embodies the Dao, worthies do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord; when the ruler lacks the Dao, the unworthy do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord. Rulers who embody the Dao are few, while those who lack the Dao are many; worthies under heaven are few, while the unworthy are many. Thus it is known that those who are unworthy and do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji said: \"Worthies alone can save the state, but men of talent can also save the state. If both save the state, how then do worthies and men of talent differ?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Ah, how pressing is this question! To achieve merit and complete tasks without pursuing fame, to remain reverent, frugal, unadorned, and restrained—this is what defines a worthy. To achieve merit and complete tasks with glory in emoluments, fame in reputation, and satisfaction in ambition—this is what defines a man of talent. Worthies can pacify the state; men of talent can govern it. What is meant by 'pacification'? It is harmony and tranquility, where none know the source of their strength. What is meant by 'governance'? It is diligent leadership, where all acknowledge the virtue of their ruler. One worthy can command a multitude of talents with ease; a multitude of talents, when measured against one worthy, still fall short. Thus, worthies and men of talent occupy distinct realms.\n\nThere are those who dwell in mountains and forests yet clamor, and those who live among the common folk yet remain serene. There are those who clamor yet act rightly, and those who are serene yet act perversely. Generally, when observing their appearance: those of coarse and vulgar bearing who possess worthiness are not few; those of refined and elegant bearing who are in fact petty men number nine out of ten. Without testing their words, one knows their culture; without demanding their demeanor, one discerns their measure; without heeding their praise, one recognizes their goodness; without following slander, one judges their truth. This is what is called having discernment.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Instruction of the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius: \"How far apart are the Dao and filial piety?\" Confucius replied: \"The Dao is the wondrous function of self-so-ness; filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. The Dao exhausts the root and origin, while filial piety perfects human conduct. The Dao, though it encompasses heaven and earth, nurtures the myriad things, and brings all categories to completion, does not seek long life or inherent nature. Its work is most substantial yet does not occupy the storehouse of things; it does not claim office yet holds no idle position; it does not usurp merit. Though one may seek it by touch or sight, it cannot be grasped—thus it is named the Dao. When applied to humanity, it is named filial piety. Filial piety is the proper name for serving one’s parents well.\n\nTo serve one’s parents well is to respect and comply with their fundamental intent, to follow their countenance in all things. In uttering a single word or forming a single thought, one does not forget one’s parents; in moving a hand or taking a step, one does not forget one’s parents. Serving one’s lord, one does not forget loyalty; dealing with friends, one does not forget trust; facing subordinates, one does not forget respect; pursuing goodness, one does not forget diligence. Even in the seclusion of a humble chamber, one does not relax one’s sincerity. This is what is called perfect filial piety. Thus, utmost sincerity reaches the spiritual realm, its radiance extending to the four seas—where there is resonance, there is response. This is the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nOf old, Shun’s filial piety was great indeed. His stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly resented and hated him, yet Shun’s reverence and caution only deepened, without resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well and then buried him beneath the earth, at that moment, auspicious omens shook the land, and divine brilliance guided him out through a hidden passage. His devotion to their care grew ever more meticulous. Thereby, his profound virtue flourished, and he became the lord of all under heaven. This is the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nKing Wen’s service to his father, King Tai, was also exemplary. His father was advanced in years...\"\n\nEach morning and evening, he would invariably arrive outside the bedchamber gate to inquire of the eunuch, saying, “How is he today? Is he at peace?” The eunuch, who attended the lord at his side, would reply, “He is at peace.” Then King Tai’s countenance would glow with warmth and joy. If there was the slightest discomfort, King Tai’s expression would fill with concern. At every morning and evening meal, when the attendants presented the food, King Tai would examine its temperature. After the meal was served, he would know precisely what delicacies had been offered and how much had been consumed. When the eunuch reported illness, King Wen would don solemn robes and fast, emptying his heart and concentrating his will to pray to the spirits for his father’s recovery. The steward’s dishes were always inspected with reverence, and the medicinal broths were personally tasted. If the food was good, King Tai would also eat well; if the food was meager, King Tai would likewise not eat his fill. When his father recovered, King Wen would also return to his usual state.\n\nWhen King Tai later erred, King Wen would use a gentle voice to offer subtle remonstrance. Even for the smallest things his father cherished, King Wen treated them with utmost care. Thus, his virtue was perfected in his person, and the Dao harmonized all under heaven. As the *Elegantiae* says, “King Wen ascends and descends at the Emperor’s side,” meaning that King Wen’s conduct was such that Heaven itself aided him. King Wen’s composure, actions, advances, and retreats were all assisted by Heaven, so that even the tyrannical King Zhou of Yin could not harm him. His life was as long as the dream of awakening: King Wu dreamed that the Emperor granted him nine lives, and King Wen said, “What do you make of this?” King Wu replied, “In the west, there are nine lands whose lords will ultimately submit to you.” King Wen said, “Not so. I have a hundred, and ninety of them are yours; three are mine.” King Wen lived to ninety-seven, and King Wu to ninety-three—this was the mandate of Heaven. This is the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nMin Ziqian said, “The Dao of serving one’s parents well—I have been fortunate indeed to hear of it.”\n\nA certain disciple asked about the meaning of teaching and nurturing. Confucius said, \"In all cases, the Three Kings’ teaching and nurturing must be guided by ritual and music. Music is that by which the inner self is cultivated; ritual is that by which the outer self is cultivated. When ritual and music are cultivated in tandem, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s countenance, and thus one’s demeanor becomes warm and civilized.\n\nNow, if a minister would sacrifice his life for the benefit of his lord, how much more should one who benefits himself also bring goodness to his lord? For this reason, one selects and appoints loyal, upright, steadfast, and incorruptible scholars as teachers and mentors, so that they may understand the Dao of serving one’s father and the principles of lord and minister, elder and younger. Only after one knows how to serve as a son can one serve as a father; only after one knows how to serve as a minister can one serve as a lord; only after one knows how to serve others can one employ others. This is the meaning of the Three Kings’ teaching and nurturing.\"\n\nMin Ziqian withdrew and practiced this in his household for three years. No one could find fault with his words toward his parents or his younger brothers. His interactions with friends were marked by trustworthiness, his conduct in the village by benevolence, and his relations with his clan by fraternal duty. The reputation of his virtuous conduct spread throughout the land—this was the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nThe Grand Master of Qi sat upon the Pure Terrace, while Duke Zhuang of Yan and the other...\n\nThe character \"Zhuang\" may also be written as \"Wallace.\" Clad in a tall cap and a stern countenance, he wore a jade-encrusted sword at his left and pendants of jade at his right, their radiance casting leftward and rightward in mutual illumination. The Grand Master was reading without looking up when Duke Zhuang of Yan asked him, \"Does the state of Qi possess any treasures?\" The Grand Master replied, \"When the lord is trustworthy and his ministers loyal, when the hundred clans uphold their superiors—these are the treasures of the state of Qi.\" Upon hearing this, Duke Zhuang removed his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! There are those who, biased and obscured, pass their entire lives without self-awareness. The worthy, upon seeing such, are tolerant and say nothing; the petty, upon seeing such, mock and speak excessively. Relatives, moved by pity or envy, speak with divided intent. How detestable is this bias and obscurity, that one remains unaware of it! Thus, the lord examines himself as though he were always in error: when he dons his robes, when he takes his meals, he recognizes his faults yet fails to correct them—this the lord finds shameful. When he wishes to speak, if he knows his words cannot be put into practice, the lord seldom speaks. When reproaching others for their faults, let him first regard his own goodness; when reproaching others for their depravity, let him first regard his own rectitude. This is called \"turning toward clarity.\"\n\nThe conduct of the elder of Zhai Xi was most cautious and circumspect. Zhai Xi, pitying his elder’s nature, favored reckless and rash speech. One morning, Zhai Xi departed and returned by evening, saying, \"Jia is dead!\" His elder believed him. Later, Jia was found alive. Another evening, he said, \"Yi is about to harm me!\" His elder kept watch, but Yi showed no sign of enmity. Another evening, he said, \"Ding is ill!\" His elder observed him, and Ding was indeed unharmed. Such instances were numerous. Though the elder maintained his caution over the years, and though his admonitions grew ever more earnest, the people of his village and state resented his fault-finding. They plotted to kill him. Zhai Xi, hearing of this, fled in fear and informed his elder. The elder did not fully believe him, yet soon after, Zhai Xi was indeed killed.\n\nThose who speak excessively may appear open and forthright, yet there are also those whose words are measured but not discreet. Those who are frivolous may seem unsettled, yet there are also those whose demeanor is composed but whose hearts are restless. Those who are meddlesome may appear petty, yet there are also those whose outward conduct is proper but whose inner selves are impure. Such cases, if enumerated, would be without end. Without thorough understanding, how could one discern them fully? There are matters one cannot simply respond to as they arise.\n\nSome are inwardly still yet outwardly active; their activity makes stillness difficult. There are times when one cannot seek fulfillment. Some are inwardly desirous yet outwardly patient; they wait for fulfillment before finding joy. Thus, those who are outwardly still yet inwardly restless disturb their thoughts and harm their nature. Those who run about chasing profit exhaust their strength and lose their good name. Only by being indifferent and free of desire, unenticed by fame or position, can one preserve one’s body and keep one’s nature whole.\n\nPeople are born into their era; some, failing to realize their aspirations, declare that they have not met their time. This is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson-necked crime, awaiting the moment of execution—how perilous! Those who do not conduct themselves with caution and speak with restraint, who offend the lord of their time, differ not from those bearing the guilt of decapitation, awaiting their punishment.\n\nThose of vast talent and comprehensive understanding who yet go unrecognized and unappointed may rightly say that the times are not pure and their mandate has not been granted—how could this be wrong? Those skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of those they counsel, pruning and shaping the emotions from which they arise. Thus, mutual openness and progress flourish, and reverence and sincerity deepen. Those unskilled in remonstrance assail the nature of those they counsel, blind to the origins of their emotions. Thus, mutual suspicion and estrangement grow daily, and what children dismiss becomes what the aged condemn. What pleases the eye becomes what troubles the mind.\n\nThose who harshly reproach the foolishness of their inferiors have not yet perfected their own virtue; those who harshly reproach the delusion of their inferiors have not yet attained their own clarity. The virtuous and enlightened should pardon the foolish and deluded; they should not reproach them. To reproach the multitude for their foolishness when one has not yet perfected one’s own virtue is to invite ruin; to reproach the multitude for their delusion when one has not yet attained clarity is to invite harm. The foolish and deluded suffer no loss, but those who harshly reproach them only harm themselves.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Guarding the Dao**\n\nNow, the Dao is the heavenly principle of humanity and the way of the state; agriculture is its foundation. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, decrees cannot be unified. When decrees are not unified, the state cannot be defended nor can it wage war. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, great wealth dwindles. When great wealth dwindles, people lightly drift away. When people lightly drift away, the state frequently suffers disasters, and all foster distant ambitions, no longer settling their hearts. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, they favor cunning; when they favor cunning, deceit multiplies; when deceit multiplies, laws and decrees become artful; when laws and decrees become artful, they obstruct cultivation and sow disorder. This is not the way of guarding; this is not cultivation.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings governed the people by first prioritizing cultivation. Cultivation is not merely tilling the land; it is cultivating the will. When the will is cultivated, people are simple; when people are simple, they are easy to employ; when they are easy to employ, the borders are secure; when the borders are secure, the ruler’s position is exalted. When people cultivate like children, they have few private interests; when they have few private interests, public laws are established. When strength is devoted to cultivation, great wealth returns. When great wealth returns, drifting is restrained; when drifting is restrained, people die where they live, without divided thoughts, and the realm is of one mind. When the realm is of one mind, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and Qi nearly comes to pass.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings flourished in plowing and weaving because they taught the root. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords in plowing the sacred field, and the ranks of officials were graded by merit to encourage people to honor the land’s produce. The empress and consorts led the palace women in silkworm raising at the suburban mulberry fields to encourage women’s work and weaving. Men did not weave yet had clothing; women did not plow yet had food. Men and women exchanged their labors and supported one another’s work—this was the system of the sage-kings.\n\nThus, they revered the seasons and the days, measured the harvest, and assessed merit. They did not rest unless old, nor cease unless ill. One person’s toil fed ten. At such times, earthworks were not undertaken, armies were not mustered, men did not leave their posts, and women did not marry outside, all to align with the agricultural seasons.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The irregularity of the four seasons concerns only the five grains.\" Now, those who sow and plant are people; those who give life are the seasons; those who nourish are the earth. Thus, in cultivation, the furrows must accommodate the foot; in hoeing, they must accommodate the hoe; in weeding, they must accommodate the hand—this is called the Dao of plowing. Farmers produce food, artisans produce tools, and merchants produce goods. If the seasons are not revered and the times are wasted on earthworks, this is called the path of great misfortune.\n\nIn planting, those who sow early do so ahead of time; those who sow late do so behind time. When cold and heat are unbalanced, disasters befall the crops. After the winter solstice, fifty-seven days pass, and life flourishes. At this time, the beginning of plowing, the Dao of cultivation appears: one plants at the sign of life and harvests at the sign of death.\n\n---\n\nWhen the seasons awaken, wealth and resources arise, yet they are not shared with those who lack; this is called *jue* [音期]. There are years of abundance and years of famine; one makes offerings to the earth in abundant years but not in lean ones. [Abundant years are years of plenty; lean years are years of scarcity. Offerings to the earth refer to sacrifices to the soil and grain. In spring, one prays for a bountiful harvest; in autumn, one gives thanks for ripened crops. If there is abundance, one offers sacrifice; if there is none, one does not—thus honoring the earth’s bounty and valuing human life.] Do not lose the proper time for labor; begin when the season arrives and cease when it passes. Even the strength of the old and weak may be fully employed. [To *dai* [迨] is to seize the moment. Though old and weak, they may be made to exhaust their efforts in plowing—this is the way of urgency.]\n\nThose who do not know the seasons act before their time, [meaning they rush into farming too early,] or long for them after they have passed, [having missed the proper moment and yearning for it in vain,] or, though acting at the right time, do so with insufficient effort. [Even if the timing is correct, scant labor yields little harvest.] These three are the lowest in the Dao of cultivation. [Though these three engage in farming, they fail to grasp the seasons, hence are deemed inferior.]\n\nWhen weeding, one must do so early, for this enriches the soil and loosens its texture. [Weeding must be done in dry conditions; when dry, weeds die easily, and the soil becomes fertile and soft.] Crops thrive in fine soil but grow best in firm earth. [To *zhi* [殖] is to grow. Sowing requires soil as fine as dust, so the earth is porous and roots run deep, allowing seedlings to grow strong. When rain comes, the soil firms, and the stalks stand steady.]\n\nBe careful with the seeds: do not sow them too densely or too sparsely. [Dense sowing is called *shu* [数].] When covering them with soil, neither stint nor overdo it. [Covering seeds with soil is called *shi tu* [施土]. If too little soil is used, the seeds are too sparse, wasting land; if too much, they are too crowded, harming the grain. Neither excess nor deficiency—seek the mean.]\n\nFurrows should be deep and straight; ridges should be level and fine. [Straight and true are called *duan* [端]. Deep, straight furrows allow water to flow swiftly; level, fine ridges ensure even moisture.] Below, they receive the yin; above, they receive the yang. Thereafter, growth flourishes. [Below, yin refers to moisture; above, yang refers to sunlight. Together, they foster life.]\n\nWhen seedlings grow in rows, they grow swiftly; when the strong do not oppress the weak, they all grow large. [Orderly rows promote rapid growth; when the strong do not harm the weak, all thrive.] Align the rows and ensure they are open in the center to allow cool winds. [Wind is written as the ancient character *feng* [风]. Arrange the seedlings in rows to permit airflow.]\n\nIf the harvest is poor despite much labor, the yield appears meager, as if stolen—this is the theft of cultivation. [Due to barren soil. The seedlings lack vigor, as if robbed.] If weeds are not removed, the field becomes overgrown; removing them too late leaves the seedlings weak—this is the harm of cultivation. [To *chu* [除] is to clear. Weeds allowed to flourish will later, when removed, leave the seedlings feeble—this is the damage wrought by human error.]\n\nWhen seedlings are weak, they should stand alone; [they should grow one by one, not clustered together.] when tender, they should grow together; [they should shelter one another.] when ripe, they should support one another. [To prevent lodging.] These three, like a clan, ensure abundant grain. [Like a human clan, mutual support yields a rich harvest.]\n\nThe danger for seedlings is that they do not sprout together and do not die together. [Uneven sprouting leads to poor growth.] In cultivation, those that sprout early yield grain; those that sprout late yield chaff. [The strong overpower the weak, so latecomers do not bear fruit.] Thus, in weeding, favor the elder and remove the younger. [Using the analogy of siblings, favor the earlier and remove the later.]\n\nIn fertile soil, do not allow overcrowding; in barren soil, do not permit solitary growth. [Barren soil is called *qiao* [硗]. Solitary growth cannot withstand early drought.] Overcrowding in fertile soil yields much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil yields much death.\n\nThose who do not know how to weed remove the elder and nurture the younger, gathering chaff instead of grain. When neither above nor below is at peace, the crops die in great numbers. Timely grain grows tall, with dense stalks and large ears, round kernels and thin husks, fragrant and glossy rice that is easy to hull and strong to eat. [Grain is called *he su* [禾粟]. Dense stalks are called *tong* [稠]. Round is *yuan* [圜].]\n\nSweet in flavor is called *xiang* [香].]\n\nGrain that misses its season grows deep awns with slender stalks, sharp ears, much chaff, and greenish kernels. [Deep awns are called *shen mang* [深芒]; sharp means fine. Greenish kernels are called *qing ling* [青蘦].]\n\nMillet that ripens in season bears ears without awns, its grains plump and husks few. [Plump grains refer to those rubbed out by hand.]\n\nMillet that misses its season grows thick roots, flowering stems, lush leaves, and short ears. [Roots are called *ben* [本]. Flowering stems refer to stems with flowers at their sides; lush means thick and large.]\n\nRice that ripens in season has sturdy stalks, dense growth, and ears like a horse’s tail. [Sturdy means large; \"horse’s tail\" describes their length.]\n\nRice that misses its season has slender stalks that do not thrive, thick husks, and often dies prematurely.\n\nHemp that ripens in season has sparse nodes, bright color, strong fibers, and small roots. [Bright means radiant; strong refers to the toughness of its bark.]\n\nHemp that misses its season grows many branches, short stems, prominent nodes, and leaves prone to pests. [Many branches are called *fan ke* [蕃柯]; prominent nodes mean raised nodes.]\n\nBeans that ripen in season have sturdy, short stems, their pods in clusters of fourteen, growing in dense clusters, with numerous branches, close nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, plentiful seeds that satisfy when eaten. [Beans are called *shu* [菽]; clusters mean gathered together; \"satisfy\" means abundance.]\n\nBeans that miss their season grow weak and vining, with floating leaves, sparse roots, distant nodes, and small pods.\n\nWheat that ripens in season is dense and clustered, its ears in groups of fourteen, its husks thin and wings pale yellow. [Thin husks are called *bo yi* [薄翼]; pale yellow is *fang se* [防色].] Eating it makes one robust and strong.\n\nWheat that misses its season swells with disease, is weak, and grows sparse with sharp-eared spikes. [Swelling means roots and stems thicken and attract pests; sharp-eared spikes have many awns.]\n\nThus, crops that ripen in season yield abundance; those that miss their season yield scarcity. When all grains are cultivated in season and eaten, the four defenses of the body grow strong: ears and eyes become sharp, *qi* does not invade the body, no afflictions arise, and one fulfills the words of Master Kong: \"In winter, fullness brings warmth to the body; in summer, fullness brings coolness.\" When warmth and coolness align with the seasons, people remain free from illness. [Illness is pronounced *zhen* [疹].] When people are free from illness, epidemics do not spread. When epidemics do not spread, all may live out their natural lifespan. Therefore, it is said: \"Grain is the foundation of the people. When a king flourishes, he must prioritize grain; a king who does not prioritize grain abandons his people. A king who abandons his people—what kingdom can he rule?\"\n\n**Military Dao, Chapter Nine**\n[The military is an inauspicious tool, used only when unavoidable.]\n\nKing Jing of Qin sought to display his military strength to the world. [During the Qin era, the terrain of Yao and Han was perilous and secure, its troops strong and warriors brave, so he sought to display his military strength to the world, leaving none敢 to oppose him. *Shi* [视] means to demonstrate.]\n\nThe Elder of the Multitude, Bao Rong, was ordered to summon Kang Cangzi. [Elder of the Multitude was a Qin rank; Bao Rong was a person’s name.]\n\nHe awaited him in twelve fortified towns along the border. [The plan was secret; wishing to consult Kang Cangzi’s strategy, he stationed troops in twelve towns to await him, fearing he might not come. He secretly sent Bao Rong to press him, ensuring his arrival.]\n\nKang Cangzi arrived from Rongquan and was lodged in the upper guesthouse. [Rongquan was a place name in Qin.]\n\nKing Jing waited three days without receiving his counsel. He descended from his seat, faced north, and struck his jade tablet, saying: \"Have you truly no intention to aid this orphaned ruler?\"\n\nKang Cangzi, with a swaying motion and sidelong glance, replied: \"This humble servant has heard that the lord’s inquiry is extraordinary—why trouble yourself so?\" He then drew his sword and slashed at the mat. [Swaying describes his movement; *kui* [亏] means to turn aside; *xi* [盻] means to glance.]\n\n\"Dzhen\" means \"I.\" King Jing’s inquiry is extraordinary—what does \"troubled so\" refer to? Does it mean King Jing takes warfare, slashing, and stabbing as his purpose? His question is base indeed.\"\n\nYet, if one follows where it leads and finds correctness therein, what more could be desired? [King Jing has asked me about the Way of arms, so I, in turn, follow his intent to correct it—this is not the ultimate principle.]\n\nKing Jing bowed once, raised his hands twice, gathered his embroidered robe, straightened his jade tablet, lowered his head, and sat, saying: \"It is truly as Heaven commands; I await your decree.\" [The *fǔrèn* is an embroidered lapel; *yì* means to lower the head. He wishes Heaven’s mandate to be bestowed.]\n\nKang Cangzi raised his gaze to the rafters and sighed, then lowered his head and composed his expression, saying: \"The origin of arms—where did it begin? It arose together with man. [The *cuī* are rafters; *xū* is a sigh. He laments that the question does not concern the ultimate Dao, so he raises his head to the rafters and sighs. The rise of arms began with man’s birth—it has existed from the very beginning, not only now.]\n\nNow, arms are the manifestation of man’s might. Man’s possession of might is an innate nature bestowed by Heaven. [Man has the nature of joy and anger, originally received from Heaven. Anger gives rise to might; might gives rise to arms—this is their origin.]\n\nThus, the origin of arms is ancient indeed. There has never been a moment, however brief, when they were not employed. [A *shàoxuǎn* is a short while. The passions of joy and anger are used without constancy, so there is no brief moment when they are not in use.]\n\nWhether base or noble, wise or foolish, all observe this together. [Together they observe the stirring of angry *qi* and thus know the origin of arms.]\n\nThe omen of arms lies in the heart: harboring resentment before it is expressed. Arms are swift glances and fierce countenances; arms are haughty words and violent shoving; arms are extravagant quarrels and assaults in battle. These four are disputes great and small. [Resentment is anger; *zuòsè* is a stern countenance; *zūn* means to push; it refers to mutual shoving. Though these four differ in scale, all arise from anger and thus become arms.]\n\nBefore the time of Chiyou, men truly wielded timber to fight. [Chiyou was a feudal lord of the Yellow Emperor’s time, with eighty-one brothers, all copper-headed and iron-browed. He battled the Yellow Emperor at Zhuolu and was the first to forge weapons, later destroyed by the Yellow Emperor.]\n\nThe Yellow Emperor employed water and fire. [Some diverted water to flood cities; others set fires to burn them.]\n\nGonggong raised waves. [Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the realm.]\n\nThe Five Emperors contended with one another. With each rise and fall, the victorious one employed arms. [The Way of arms has its rises and falls; all who follow Heaven and prevail may use them.]\n\nNow, if some die from taking medicine, should we forbid all under Heaven from practicing medicine? No. If some die from boarding boats, should we forbid all under Heaven from sailing? No. If some lose their states through arms, should we forbid all under Heaven from bearing arms? No.\n\nArms cannot be abolished, just as water and fire cannot. When well used, they bring great fortune; when misused, they bring great calamity. Thus, anger and corporal punishment cannot be abolished in the household; punishments cannot be abolished in the state; and campaigns cannot be abolished under Heaven. [Corporal punishment refers to caning; *yǎn* means to cease.]\n\nThe sage kings of antiquity had righteous arms but no abolished arms. [Righteous arms follow Heaven and respond to man, used to punish the violent and disorderly.]\n\nArms, when truly righteous, punish violent rulers and rescue the suffering people, who rejoice as if a starving orphan meets a loving parent or a famished beggar encounters fine food, crying out and rushing forward like a powerful crossbow loosed into a deep valley. [To rescue is to save; *pú* means a servant; a powerful crossbow shooting into a deep valley describes swift and eager movement.]\n\nVictory or defeat is not determined elsewhere but must return to human nature. Man’s nature desires life and abhors death, desires honor and abhors disgrace. Death and life, honor and disgrace share a single path—thus the three armies’ warriors can be united in heart. [If the ruler shares life and death, honor and disgrace with the three armies, though they be many, they can be made of one heart.]\n\nGenerally, an army desires numbers, but its heart desires unity. When the three armies are of one heart, they can be made invincible. The ancients who excelled in arms valued this above all. [The most excellent ancient users of arms valued caution in their commands.]\n\nThus, the stronger their commands, the weaker their enemies; the more trustworthy their commands, the more their enemies yield. Victory is first secured here, then achieved there. [Assessing the enemy and securing victory must begin with self-assessment. If one shares life and death with the multitude and unites the three armies in heart, victory is assured.]\n\nIf this is truly so, what enemy could be overcome? Generally, when enemies come, it is to seek advantage.\"\n\nIf they come now and find death acceptable, reckoning flight as advantage, then blades need not meet. This is called the \"ultimate army\"—arrogant, cruel, treacherous, and contrary to righteousness and principle. [Such treacherous armies stand in opposition to the principles of righteous warfare.]\n\nTheir forces cannot both prevail nor coexist. [Righteous armies triumph; treacherous ones fall.] Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know where to seek refuge. When its troops reach the outskirts of cities and towns, they do not trample crops, desecrate graves, plunder granaries, or burn homes. They capture prisoners and return them, merely setting a time to meet the enemy, providing resources to distinguish good from evil, and demonstrating right from wrong. If, despite this, there remain those who are obstinate, cruel, and defiant, then the use of force is justified. [Obstinate and cruel mean perverse and rebellious; defiant means unruly. Even after demonstrating righteousness, if some remain perverse and disobedient, military punishment may be applied.]\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: \"Our army comes to avenge the people’s wrongs and uphold the Dao of harmony. Thus, though we conquer the state, we do not massacre its people; we execute only those who must be executed.\" [Only the tyrant is punished.] Then, they select the worthy and virtuous and honor them, seeking out the orphaned, the sick, the widowed, and the elderly to aid and respect them. [They assist the orphaned and infirm, showing reverence to the elderly.] They open the treasuries, distribute the stored grain, [The *Shuowen* says \"accumulated\"; Mao’s commentary says \"depicted as grain, from *shi* phonetic.\" Originally referring to regrown rice, here used for \"order.\"] and do not hoard goods, bestowing gifts with utmost courtesy. [They do not claim spoils for themselves but share with all, extending courtesy to seek the worthy.]\n\nNow, if someone here could revive one dead person, the people of the world would vie to serve him. [To restore life is to save; if one revives a single person through righteousness, all under heaven would flock to him.] How much more does a righteous army revive many? Who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, neighboring states submit as if to flowing water, and people of other lands gaze upon them as upon parents. The farther they advance, the more people join them; before their words are even finished, the people flock in droves.\n\nAt these words, King Jing rose from his seat, [bowing his head in thought, then lifting it in realization,] saying, \"I have heard your teachings, Master, and unknowingly, my spirit fills the cosmos, my will knows its path, and my heart swells with ever greater reverence.\" [Having heard the Dao of righteous warfare, he cast aside his arrogant and treacherous heart, his resolve brimming to fill the universe, his purpose clear.]\n\nHe stepped forward, raised a cup in toast to Kang Cangzi’s longevity, [advancing to offer a toast, honoring the Way with solemnity,] then bowed and took his place among the ranks of disciples, his demeanor as solemn as in a sacred chamber. For a month, [or \"ten days,\" or \"a full cycle,\"] at dawn’s first light, he practiced the Way, [the \"Celestial Gate\" refers to the hour of *chen*; \"practicing the Way\" means observing the rites of a disciple.]\n\n*Kang Cangzi Zhu* [Postscript to *Kang Cangzi Zhu*]\n\nThe nine chapters of *Kang Cangzi* to the right belong to Daoist texts, yet their language draws heavily from the works of Zhuangzi, [lacuna], the *Lüshi Chunqiu*, *Shuo Yuan*, *Dai’s Rituals*, and *Gao You’s* annotations—though they are often broad without focus, excessive without substance. Liu Zongyuan dismissed them as empty words, [lacuna], and many have not seen this book. Those who have often criticize it, some even claiming it to be a Tang forgery composed from Tang-era texts. Yet when the state of Qin attacked Ying, [lacuna], upon examining its [lacuna] as recorded by later scholars, it appears to date to the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras, when Daoist teachings were revered. The recluse Wang Bao remarked that Zhuangzi’s principles were like mulberry and catalpa trees, while Kang Cangzi’s were like the *wu* and *tong* trees—Kang Cangzi borrowed their phrasing and meaning to supplement what was lost. His intent must have been to preserve the old while compiling anew, or perhaps he followed [lacuna] characters to embellish its [lacuna] as an ancient text. Apart from the Six Classics and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, few works are truly profound—how much rarer still is this one? Yet within it, one or two passages may be worth adopting, and it is not merely a Daoist text that can stand alone. I sought this book for a long time without success until Master Wu, the Sacrificial Wine of the Nanjing Directorate of Astronomy, sent me this copy and urged me to carve blocks for its transmission to fellow scholars. [lacuna] I thus added phonetic annotations, re-copied it, and had it printed. Here, I append these words as a postscript.\n\nInscribed by the Orchid Creek Daoist, Huang Jian of Jincheng.",

      "translated_text": "The Kangxi Emperor’s *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Annotations on Master Kàngcāng*\nBy Hé Càn of the Tang Dynasty\n*Chapter One: \"The All-Encompassing Dao\"*\n[\"The heart merges with emptiness’s utmost, virtue penetrates the mysterious; achievements align with the four seasons, and the common people transform of themselves.\"]\n\nMaster Kàngcāng [the character *cāng* (倉) derives from *chuān* (川) atop *fā* (發), as glossed by Shǐ Gǔ: *zǐ* (子) is an honorific for a person] dwelled at the foot of Mount Yǔ [the character *sān* (叁) is an ancient form of *sān* (三), a numeral] for three years [the character *nián* (年) combines *hé* (禾) and *qiān* (千), signifying grain’s ripening, hence a harvest cycle; commonly written as *nián* (年). Mount Yǔ, as recorded in the *Yǔ Gòng* of the *Book of Documents*, lies in Xúzhōu. The *Canon of Shùn* states that Gǔn was executed at Mount Yǔ, which lies in the eastern marches, later part of the state of Lǔ, south of Mount Yán. Zhuāngzǐ cites this passage as \"dwelling north at Mount Léilěi,\" referring to this same mountain].\n\nThe local customs knew no plague or pestilence, and the harvests were repeatedly abundant [where sages and worthies reside, Heaven bestows its blessings, sparing the people from disease and ensuring bumper crops; *réng* (仍) denotes frequent repetition]. The people whispered among themselves: \"When Kàngcāng first arrived, we thought little of him [the character *xiān* (鲜) derives from *huǒ* (火) and *rán* (肰), meaning \"to burn,\" here used as a grammatical particle akin to *rán* (然), though not identical]. Now we find him strange indeed [they marveled at his empty heart and tranquil demeanor, devoid of worldly concerns]. Daily, we find ourselves lacking, yet yearly, we have surplus. Could he be a sage?\" [Having witnessed his beneficence, they suspected him of sagacity.] \"Why not enthrone him as our lord, erect ancestral temples, and establish altars for the gods of soil and grain?\" [The character *hū* (虖) is commonly written as *hū* (乎), a grammatical particle; *hé* (盍) means \"why not.\" They wished to elevate him as ruler, build ancestral shrines, and establish altars for the gods of soil and grain, offering sacrifices and serving him as their sovereign.]\n\nHearing this, Kàngcāng’s countenance showed displeasure. His disciples Yǎn and Chuò approached to inquire [Yǎn and Chuò were Kàngcāng’s followers; wishing to understand his thoughts, they sought his counsel]. Kàngcāng said: \"I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse in a humble abode, while the people, wild and unrestrained, know not where to turn [the character *rú* (如) is an ancient form of *wǎng* (往). The perfected person’s heart is free of cares, akin to a corpse, living in quiet solitude within a humble dwelling. The people, admiring him, turn toward him, yet their devotion arises not from true understanding].\"\n\n\"Now, the people of Yǔ, fathers and sons, whisper among themselves, offering me sacrificial vessels—are they not making me their target?\" [They secretly discussed honoring him with sacrificial vessels, turning him into a mark for veneration.] \"This is why I am displeased, for it contradicts the words of Lǎo Dān [Lǎo Dān said: 'I do nothing, and the people transform themselves; I am without affairs, and the people prosper; I value stillness, and the people rectify themselves.' Now, the opposite has occurred, hence his displeasure].\"\n\nYǎn and Chuò replied: \"Not so. A shallow puddle, though vast, cannot restore its body to a fish, while the newt arrogates its domain [the character *wéi* (□) is pronounced *wéi* (为). Eight *chǐ* make a *xún*; twice a *xún* make a *cháng*. A *wū* (污) is a pool; *huán* (还) means \"to return.\" The *ní* (鲵) is a small fish with legs; *zhì* (制) means \"to dominate\"]. A mound of six or seven *chǐ* cannot shelter a great beast, while the fox claims its auspices [six *chǐ* make a *bù*; seven *chǐ* make a *rèn*. *Fāng* (防) means \"ominous\"; *xiáng* (祥) means \"auspicious.\" Just as shallow waters cannot contain a great fish, nor a small mound hide a large beast, so too must one of Kàngcāng’s virtue be granted ample emolument].\"\n\n\"Moreover, to honor the worthy and employ the capable, to incline toward goodness and pursue benefit—this has been the practice since the time of Yáo and Shùn. How much more so for the people of Yǔ? Master, you should accept their offerings.\"\n\nKàngcāng exclaimed: \"Ah! Come here! [The exclamation *xī* (嘻) expresses surprise; dismayed by their failure to grasp his intent, he sighed and called them closer, wishing to instruct them on loftier matters.] You two—do you understand? [Referring to Yáo and Shùn—do they truly comprehend?] The beast that fits in a carriage, once isolated from the mountains, is ensnared by nets and traps. The fish that swallows a boat, once adrift from the waters, is tormented by ants and mole crickets. Thus, birds and beasts seek the heights, while fish and turtles crave the depths [the character *tū* (突) in *shēn* (湥) is an ancient form of *shēn* (深), the opposite of *qiǎn* (浅)]. For one who preserves his form and life, to conceal himself is to desire nothing more than profound obscurity.\" [The character *hán* (函) means \"to contain\"; *jiè* (介) means \"isolated.\"]",

      "translated_text": "\"[The character *yuǎn* () means 'profound obscurity.'] I shall tell you this: the root of great chaos lies precisely in the space between Yáo and Shùn. Even if it persists for a thousand generations, there will surely come a time when men devour one another. [Events may begin in success but end in failure, start with fortune but conclude in misfortune—how can one be certain? Thus, Yáo and Shùn’s abdication in favor of virtue became a fleeting glory, yet their legacy gave rise to usurpation and regicide in later ages. As Zhuāngzǐ said: Yáo and Shùn’s abdication led to Dì Kuài’s abdication and ruin; Tāng and Wǔ’s contention for the throne brought kingship, while Bái Gōng’s contention brought annihilation—such are the consequences. Only those who do not establish a reputation for virtue leave no trace for others to emulate or covet.]\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Nánzǐ Róngzhī’s expression changed abruptly; he shifted his knees on the mat and said, \"I, Chū, have lived long under the turning of the heavens—how should I entrust my legacy to these words?\" [Róngzhī, also called Chū, is the Nányōng Chǔ of Zhuāngzǐ. Having heard such lofty principles, he suddenly altered his countenance, drew his knees closer on the mat, and begged for instruction with reverence.]\n\nKàng Cāngfáng replied, \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not rebel against the Way. [The character *bèi* () is an ancient form of *bèi* (悖), meaning 'disorder' or 'perversity.'] If your thoughts and cares churn ceaselessly like this, you may reach the end of your years without attaining this truth. [To 'churn ceaselessly' is to move without rest. Preserving one’s form and embracing life without engaging in restless thought, abiding in emptiness and stillness—this is how the Dao naturally dwells within. By such means, one may reach this truth before the end of one’s years.] Though my talent is slight and insufficient to transform the age, why do you not journey south to consult my teacher, Dān? [Dān is the given name of Lǎozǐ.]\"\n\nKàng Cāngfáng then dismissed Róngzhī Chū, shedding the customs of the vulgar world and ascending like a dragon, transforming amidst the heavens. [To 'dismiss' is to send away. Shedding the customs of the vulgar world, he withdrew and wandered like a dragon, ascending and descending with the times.]\n\nWater’s nature is clarity, yet when mud disturbs it, it cannot remain clear. Man’s nature is longevity, yet when external things agitate it, it cannot endure. [To 'disturb' is to disrupt. Human nature is to live long, but when external things disturb it, one cannot fulfill one’s natural lifespan.] External things exist to nourish one’s nature, yet the deluded of this age often use their nature to nourish external things, unaware of what is light and what is heavy. [Clothing and food nourish one’s nature and cannot be lacking for even a day, yet the deluded harm their nature in pursuit of external things. The more they accumulate, the more their nature is injured, not realizing that nature is weighty while external things are light—a complete inversion.]\n\nThus, the sage’s approach to sounds, colors, and flavors is this: if they benefit one’s nature, he takes them; if they harm one’s nature, he discards them—this is the way to preserve one’s nature. [The character *wàn* (防) is an ancient form of *wàn* (万), meaning 'ten thousand' or 'myriad.'] A man who takes up a bow and shoots at a single target never fails to hit it, yet when myriad things are clearly arrayed before him, he never fails to wound his life. [To 'discard' is to cast away. To 'take up' is to grasp. A 'target' is the mark one shoots at.]\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when myriad things are in tumultuous disarray, the sage’s regulation of them preserves their Heavenly nature. [The sage restrains the myriad things to prevent injury to one’s nature and preserve the celestial truth.] When Heaven is preserved, the spirit is preserved; one whose spirit is preserved moves without deliberation yet penetrates all, plans without contrivance yet accords with all. His essence illumines without bound, his will congeals throughout the cosmos, his virtue resembles that of Heaven and Earth. [The character *dì* () is an ancient form of *dì* (地), ‘earth,’ composed of ** (soil) and *tuàn* (phonetic, identical to *fáng* 埅).] Above, he is a sovereign yet remains unarrogant; below, he is a commoner yet feels no distress—this is called the man of complete Dao. [One whose spirit is whole overflows with wisdom and resolve; his will and qi congeal throughout the cosmos, his virtue of encompassing and sustaining equal to that of Heaven and Earth. Though noble as the Son of Heaven or humble as a commoner, he does not alter his resolve with changes in fortune.]\n\nHis mind is level and upright, undisturbed by external things—this is called purity, and purity endures. [The character *zé* (□) is an ancient form of *zé* (则), ‘principle,’ composed of *dǐng* (鼎) and *dāo* (刀).] His clarity is luminous and enduring; his emptiness is empty, and the Dao is complete within him. Qin Yi died, and Kanggeng Fang wept for him. [Qin Yi was an ancient man of the Dao, likely a friend of Laozi.] His disciple asked, “Everyone in the world dies—why do you weep, Master?” [The disciple acted as a servant. Death and life are the constant Way of ancient and modern times; the enlightened man rests in this and does not weep—this would be proper.] Kanggeng Fang replied, “Everyone in the world weeps—how could I not weep?” [He wept in accord with things, yet though he wept, it was not true weeping.] His disciple asked, “Those who weep must feel sorrow—why do you show no grief, Master?” [未始 means ‘never yet.’ Ordinary people weep with sorrow and pain; though the Master wept, no sorrow was visible—dare I ask the reason?] Kanggeng Fang said, “In all beneath Heaven, I have no one with whom to share joy—where would I find sorrow? [Where there is joy, there must be sorrow—this is the common human condition. The enlightened man, seeing the great view, has no distinctions of near or far; since he does not share in joy, he has no cause for sorrow.]”\n\nTo shed the earth is to become water; to shed water is to become qi; to shed qi is to become emptiness; to shed emptiness is to become the Dao. [蜕 means ‘to molt’ or ‘shed.’ To shed the earth is to become water; to shed water is to become qi; to shed qi is to become emptiness; to shed emptiness is to become the Dao—this is like the perfected man who is not bound by emotions of sorrow or joy, thus attaining the ultimate.] Emptiness is the body of the Dao; stillness is the foundation of the Dao; principle is the warp of the Dao; discernment is the weft of the Dao. [The perfected man who can be empty and still, who possesses principle and discernment, can thereby unite with the form and body of the Dao, knowing its warp and weft.] The Dao preserves the spirit; virtue expands one’s capacity; ritual equalizes all; the myriad things nourish the body. [These four all sustain the body and cannot be lacking even for a moment.]\n\nThose who favor white things soil them with black; those who favor black things soil them with white—how then can I know what in the world is truly pure or defiled? Thus, I do not adhere to the purity or defilement of things. [The character *hēi* (□) means ‘black.’] The dim-sighted see yellow as red and green as black—how can I, who am now called one who knows white from black, know what in the world is the true color? Thus, I do not flee from the colors of things. [瞀 means ‘blurred vision’; 黈 means ‘yellow’; 赪 means ‘red.’ Those with blurred vision cannot see clearly, mistaking yellow for red and green for black—just as ordinary people cling to purity and defilement. Even a great sage cannot correct this, so one does not generate notions of purity or defilement or flow with the colors of the multitude.]\n\nThose who love wealth excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love horses excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love books excessively do not see other things as lovable—how then can I know what in the world is truly lovable or detestable? Thus, I do not see things as worthy of attachment. Nothing can disturb my true nature. [The character *zhēn* (真) means ‘true’ or ‘authentic.’]",

      "translated_text": "Chen Huai-Jun Liu dispatched his grandee Dao to conduct a diplomatic visit to Lu. [Chen Huai-Jun is the posthumous name; Liu is the given name. Dao is the name of the grandee.] Shu Sun Qing said privately, [Shu Sun is his clan name, which had long served as a minister of Lu,] “Does your state have a sage? Do you know of him?” [The sage refers to Confucius.] The grandee of Chen asked, “How can one clearly demonstrate his sagacity?” Shu Sun Qing replied, “He can set aside the mind and employ the form.” [The sagely realm transcends the ordinary and cannot be fathomed by common sentiment. One merely sees him handling worldly affairs with ease and thus mistakenly deems him a sage—how could they know the source of his sagacity?]\n\nThe grandee of Chen said, “Though my humble state is small, it too has a sage, different from the one of whom you have heard.” “Who is this sage?” asked Shu Sun Qing. The grandee of Chen replied, “There is one named Kang Cang-Pi, who has fully attained the Dao of Lao Dan.” [Among his disciples, he was most eminent, hence it is said he ‘fully attained.’] “Can he use his ears to see and his eyes to hear?” [The ancient character for *see* is composed of *eye* and *show* as phonetic. The ancient character for *hear* is composed of *ear* and *ren* as phonetic.]\n\nDuke Ding heard of this and found it extraordinary. He sent the Shu Sun clan to return the visit and to present Kang Cang-Pi with the rites due to a high minister. When Kang Cang-Pi arrived, he was received as a guest in the secondary hall. [The secondary hall was the next chamber to the duke’s main hall.] The Duke of Lu spoke humbly to inquire of him. Kang Cang-Pi said, “I can see without using my ears and hear without using my eyes. It is not that I can alter the functions of ears and eyes; rather, what they report is excessive.”\n\nThe Duke said, “How can this be? You have greatly astonished me. What is your Way? I truly wish to learn it.” Kang Cang-Pi replied, “My body harmonizes with my mind, my mind harmonizes with my qi, my qi harmonizes with my spirit, and my spirit harmonizes with nothingness. There is no intermediary between them. Though distant as the eight wilds beyond, it is as near as the space between my eyebrows and eyelashes. Whatever comes to me, I must know it, yet I know it not. This is not what my seven apertures, hands, and feet perceive, nor what my six viscera, five organs, and heart contemplate—it is self-knowing alone.” [When mind and form dissolve into union, spirit and qi merge in profound accord, utterly forgetting and becoming one with the Dao. Only then does the mind become still and the will ever more far-reaching; the spirit grows ever more silent, yet its illumination ever more radiant. Principles reach their utmost and naturally become clear; without thought, one attains profound insight. Who but the utmost sage and utmost spirit could achieve this? This is indeed the essential mystery of the numinous and true, the subtlest wonder of the profound Dao.]\n\n**Chapter Two: Employing the Dao**\n\nEarth cannot be trusted; people cannot be trusted; the mind cannot be trusted—only the Dao can be trusted. How could worthy rulers and outstanding scholars know this?\n\nIn ancient times, Jie trusted spirits and his ministers, yet he neglected the Dao. Spirits seized his state and bestowed it upon Yin. Zhou also trusted spirits and his ministers, yet he did not reverently follow the Dao. Spirits seized his state and bestowed it upon Zhou. [The character *yu* means ‘to rely upon.’ *Zu* means ‘ancestral lord.’ Xia Jie and Yin Zhou indulged in excess and arrogance, believing themselves to possess the people and mandate from Heaven above. They acted with utter cruelty, wantonly giving free rein to their violence without cultivating the Dao. Thus, Heaven seized their states and granted them to Tang and Wu.]\n\nNow, the indolent farmer trusts the earth to truly produce the hundred grains, yet if he does not exert effort in the Dao of farming, the earth will pilfer his harvest, leaving his fields overgrown and barren. [The indolent farmer trusts the earth to yield grain but does not diligently plow and weed, allowing weeds to overrun the fields, so he cannot reap the fruits of his labor.]\n\nThe Marquis of Qi trusted human nature, yet his sense of deference and yielding was unclear regarding the Dao. He entrusted his entire domain to others, who in truth were rapacious and seized his state. [Duke Jian of Qi trusted human nature but lacked clarity in deference and yielding, and was assassinated by Chen Heng. Others took his state, their rapacity likened to the owl’s greed.]\n\nGenerally, those who do not cultivate the Dao and instead follow their own minds as teachers, pursuing desires with fervor, will invite calamities and illnesses, inciting strife that harms the body and shortens life—thus the mind becomes the enemy of the self. [When people follow their own minds without adhering to sagely teachings, desires blaze fiercely, and a hundred misfortunes gather. This is the mind harming the body, for *peng* means ‘to gather,’ and *xin* means ‘to move.’ *Qiang* means ‘to harm.’]",
      "overlap_context": "ate notions of purity or defilement or flow with the colors of the multitude.]\n\nThose who love wealth excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love horses excessively do not see other things as lovable; those who love books excessively do not see other things as lovable—how then can I know what in the world is truly lovable or detestable? Thus, I do not see things as worthy of attachment. Nothing can disturb my true nature. [The character *zhēn* (真) means ‘true’ or ‘authentic.’]",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: only the Dao can be trusted. [The Dao is vast and unobstructed, serene and untroubled, free from defilement. If one can empty the mind and return to the Dao, body and life will be secure.]\n\nWithout the Dao, the earth and its boundaries cannot endure for long.

[The worthy and talented all employ the Dao to order things.]\n\nThose who employ the Dao do not display their use of it. Their blessings spread abundantly, and their achievements return to nothingness. [Silently they accomplish and subtly they aid the people, who say, \"It is natural.\"]\n\nTheir spirit flows freely, their undertakings flourish, their virtue is excellent, and their blessings endure. [Flowing freely means the spirit and principle are unimpeded; virtue and undertakings flourish; accumulated goodness is profound, and blessings flow to later generations.]\n\nTo know and distinguish is called *shì*; to know without distinguishing is called the Dao. *Shì* is for ordering people; the Dao is for pacifying them. [To analyze and discern things, guiding people to abandon evil and pursue goodness, is how one orders them. To embrace harmony, emptiness, and tranquility, without praise or blame, is how one pacifies and stabilizes the restless.]\n\nThe way of the farmer is to rise at cockcrow, bear the sun’s burden, toil and sweat, and only rest at midnight.

      "translated_text": "To stoop and gather, to reach and grasp, to sharpen one’s intent like an awl, to strain one’s thoughts like a rope, to concentrate one’s essence in pursuit of profit—this is the way of the merchant and shopkeeper.\n\nTo swallow qi, to nourish the spirit, to govern one’s thoughts, to cast off cares, to transcend the distant, to ascend lightly, to refine the essence of the sun, and to forge one’s nature into immortality—this is the way of the lofty scholar. [Swallowing qi refers to embryonic breathing and the fivefold regulation of the teeth. *Gǔ* means \"to nourish.\" *Zǎi* means \"to govern.\" *Rì jīng* means \"to absorb the essence of the sun.\" *Liàn* means \"to refine and ascend as an immortal.\"]\n\nTo master one’s emotions and correct one’s intentions, to devote one’s will entirely to one’s lord, to measure and weigh affairs, to forget sleep in pursuit of plans, and to render service in one’s office—this is the way of the minister. [To focus one’s emotions and rectify one’s thoughts, to dedicate one’s will to the lord one serves, to follow principle in measuring and weighing, and to render merit in the office one holds—this is the way of the minister.]\n\nTo purify the heart, to reduce desires, to examine and verify one’s closest attendants, and to seek worthy and good men in order to pacify the people—this is the way of the king. [To purify the heart is to diminish cravings. To reduce desires is to be without selfishness. *Jìn xí* refers to close ministers.]\n\nIf each follows the way appropriate to their station and aligns with its principles, neither abandoning their aspirations nor neglecting their duties, and if they tread their paths with steadfastness, this is called \"the realm below possessing the Dao.\" [Farmers and merchants each preserve their occupations; enlightened rulers and worthy ministers each cultivate their ways. Thus, the world is ordered, and all undertakings are stable and secure.]\n\nTo guide the sinews and bones is to preserve the integrity of the body; to cut off emotions and desires is to preserve the spirit; to still one’s speech is to preserve good fortune; to be capable is to preserve one’s capacity. To safeguard these three preservations is called \"the pure and worthy aligning with the Dao.\" The spirit aids those who embody trust and righteousness; the noble man perfects ritual propriety; the petty man harbors knowledge. Those with understanding naturally affirm themselves, and even those without understanding also affirm themselves. Those with the Dao remain serene and silent, and even the dull and slow also remain serene and silent. Things inherently may resemble right yet be wrong, or resemble wrong yet be right. First weeping, then laughter; beginning auspiciously, ending in misfortune. A person may be endearing, yet their talents not so; talents may command respect, yet the person may not be worthy of it. Excessive respect leads to estrangement; excessive closeness leads to disrespect. To be close yet distant, or distant yet close; to show great kindness yet breed resentment. [The character *fǎng* is an ancient form of *ài*, meaning \"love,\" from the heart and the phonetic *wú*.] Too much leads to hatred; some use flattery, some use delay, some use bluntness, some use indirectness—among the hundred affairs, their origins are subtle and must not be unknown. Thus, the wise approach them with caution.\n\nSerenity unites the spirit; emptiness exhausts the mind; silence unites speech; wealth unites the body; understanding the principles of circumstances enables one to harmonize with the Dao. Those of the same Dao support one another; those of the same art envy one another—this is the nature of human feelings. [When emotions are in harmony and there are no demands, people love one another; when there is competition for ability and a desire to excel, they envy one another. Such is the force of circumstances.]\n\nTo be talented yet humble, poor and lowly yet not obsequious, to endure toil without shame, to be wealthy and noble yet respectful and diligent—this may be called possessing virtue.\n\n**Section Three: The Way of Governance**\n\n[To follow Heaven’s decree and issue commands without regard for closeness or distance, all lands converge as one, and all turn to admire and submit.]\n\nPeople have no means to know the ruler except through the movements of the four seasons—cold and heat—and the courses of the sun, moon, and stars. If the ruler is like the movements of the four seasons—cold and heat—and the courses of the sun, moon, and stars, then all living beings, with their blood and qi, will find their proper places and rest in their positions.\n\nMinisters likewise have no means to know their lord except through the lord’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments. If the lord’s bestowal of rewards, punishments, ranks, and emoluments is impartial toward close and distant, worthy and unworthy, then all will exert their strength and be employed according to their abilities.\n\nWhen trust is complete, the realm below is at peace; when trust is lost, the realm below is in peril. When the people toil and exhaust their resources, when their minds are filled with contention and they no longer trust one another—this arises from the government’s lack of impartiality.\n\nThe government’s lack of impartiality is the fault of the officials. The officials’ faults lie in the inconsistency of punishments and rewards. The inconsistency of punishments and rewards stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity. When the ruler is diligent and clear, punishments and rewards are unified; when punishments and rewards are unified, officials uphold the law; when officials uphold the law, governance is proclaimed below; when governance is proclaimed below, each person finds their place and mutual trust is established.\n\nThus, the lack of trust in the realm below stems from the ruler’s lack of diligence and clarity.\n\nKang Cangzi dwelled at Xirang for five years. [Xirang was a place in Zhou.] King Ling dispatched Minister Ji to present a basket of silk and threaded jade. [King Ling was a Zhou king. Minister Ji was a high official of Zhou. *Lù* refers to fine jade. King Ling admired Kang Cangzi’s virtue and sent Minister Ji with gifts of jade and silk to invite him. *Fěi* was the basket used to hold the silk. *Rèn* was the thread used to string the jade.]\n\nHe said, \"I am a shallow and insignificant man, unworthy of my position. Floods and droughts have come unseasonably, and the people suffer hunger and hardship. As the ruler of men, by what means may I avert this?\" [King Ling said, \"I am a shallow and insignificant man, unworthy of my exalted position, and have brought about untimely floods and droughts, causing the people to suffer hunger and hardship. I humbly ask for the method to avert this.\" *Ráng* means \"to ward off.\"]\n\nKang Cangzi replied, \"Floods are the disorder of yin. Yin corresponds to the state’s governance of punishments and the people’s private affairs. [Disorder (*lì*) means chaos. Water is a yin symbol, and yin governs punishments. Water also flows secretly, symbolizing private and hidden matters. If punishments are unjust and private affairs are numerous, then there will be disasters from human affairs.] Drought is the excess of yang. Yang corresponds to the state’s governance of virtue and the people’s excesses. [Drought is a yang symbol, and yang governs virtue. Yang represents brightness and abundance. If the ruler does not cultivate virtue and the people are excessive, then there will be great drought.] You, sir, have encountered floods and droughts. Heaven’s principle is to rectify punishments and cultivate virtue, for officials to be impartial and eliminate private interests, and to be vigilant against excess—thus, the hundred misfortunes will naturally dissipate, and the blessings of the sun will arrive.\" [Kang Cangzi’s name was *Chǔ*. The rest follows this example. This passage is reasonable.]\n\nIn Zheng, there was the *fēngguī* jade tablet of Hu and the *rónggōng* bow of the Rong.

These two items originally belonged to the state of Hu and were later obtained by Zheng.\n\nAt another time, Zheng failed to attend the assembly with Jing. [At other times, the feudal lords of the Yin dynasty called their gatherings *tóng*. Jing was the former name of Chu. At that time, Chu was a major state, and the feudal lords jointly attended the assembly in Chu as the appointed time. Zheng arrived late.] Jing, relying on its strength, demanded, \"You must yield the *fēngguī* jade tablet and the *rónggōng* bow; otherwise, we will bring our troops against you.\" The lord of Zheng was troubled by this and sought an audience with Kang Cangzi, saying, \"The *fēngguī* jade tablet and the *rónggōng* bow were obtained from Hu by our former lord, passed down through generations as treasured heirlooms to display the glory of our lineage. [He was distressed. *Mián* means 'continuous.' *Yì sì* refers to descendants.

[Kang Cangzi regarded integrity and righteousness as treasures.] If you adorn Chu’s treasure to absolve its guilt, Chu will be unable to do so. [To *shì* means to borrow or defer. If you deceive a great state with counterfeit jade, seeking to temporarily evade punishment through deception, you may delay retribution for a time, but ultimately, you will bring calamity upon yourself, implicate your lord in wrongdoing, and undermine our integrity. Thus, I cannot act in this way.] You must present the genuine items. [He advised the lord of Zheng not to offer substitute jade.]\n\nNow, Jing, on account of a minor transgression, wields its might and punishment, indulging in aggression without justification, thereby exhausting and plundering its allies. Jing will lose the support of the feudal lords in this matter. When the feudal lords hear of this, they will be alarmed and take heed.

      "translated_text": "The term *lúnbǐ* means \"to emulate one another,\" while *gū* means \"simply wait.\" Zheng’s delayed tribute was indeed a minor transgression, yet Jing, relying on its strength, sought to indulge its might and punishment, coercing [Zheng] with threats of jade and bows, plundering its allies without virtue. Such greed will surely cost Jing the support of the feudal lords.\n\nAt this juncture, [Zheng] presented the Hu jade and Rong bow, but before they reached Ying [Jing’s capital], the people of Jing heard of [Zheng’s] resolute counsel. They said, \"They heed the teachings of the sage, and their words leave us no grounds to seize these [gifts]. To persist would be unjust before the feudal lords and stir discontent among them.\" Thus, they hastily returned the tribute and treated [Zheng] with greater kindness.\n\nHuman nature desires life and abhors death, seeks security and shuns peril, craves honor and detests disgrace. When the people’s desires are fulfilled, they rejoice in peace; when unfulfilled, they suffer in hardship and danger. If a ruler indulges his own desires, the myriad officials and esteemed ministers will all restrain them. When the officials and esteemed ministers restrain their desires, the people—whether poor, exhausting their strength, or rich, exhausting their wealth—lose their proper order. The four classes [scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants] fall into disorder, and none attain their desires. When the people cannot fulfill their desires, they join hands, cling together, flee, hide, drift on the waters, and glean wild fruits to sustain their lives. The officials then pursue and capture them, leading to unbearable hardship and peril, which gives rise to thoughts of rebellion. The state is no longer truly theirs.\n\nDo not covet the populace’s numbers; if you drive them, they will scatter. Do not fortify cities; if you exhaust them, they will grow weary. If taxes are excessive, the impoverished will grow ever poorer. If punishments are inconsistent, the fearful will grow ever more anxious. Prohibitions and laws will proliferate, and the state will tilt toward collapse. If officials are unworthy, leniency and severity will be misapplied. If they contend with the people for profit, deceitful hearts will arise. Thus, the realm becomes rife with deceit, and the ruler’s understanding grows dim. When the ruler is dim, the people are confused. When the people are confused, officials toil in vain. When officials toil in vain, rewards fail to encourage, and punishments fail to deter. The state becomes volatile and difficult to pacify—all because officials are not properly selected.\n\nThe essence of governance lies in carefully assessing men of talent. If a man’s conduct is esteemed in a village, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in a county, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in a province, entrust him with its affairs. If his conduct is esteemed in the state, entrust him with its governance. Only then will there be no hidden talents.\n\nIf a man commits wrongdoing in a village, admonish him. If he does not reform, send him to the county for punishment. If he still does not reform, send him to the state for execution. Thus, no rebellious conduct will persist. If this is done, the people will revere and submit, and no seeds of defiance or disrespect will sprout. This is called \"pacifying the people.\"\n\nOf all the affairs under heaven, none is greater than seeking men of talent. The best way to attract them is through sound governance, and the best governance is that which pacifies the people. Yet when assessing such men by their literary compositions, scarcely four or five in a hundred prove genuine. When judging by their words, perhaps one or two in ten are sincere. But when examining their demeanor, spirit, and bearing, eight or nine in ten will be found true. This is what enlightened kings of successive ages have been able to discern and select.\n\nIf a ruler selects men by their literary skill, ornate and clever compositions will flourish, while plain and sincere ones will vanish. If he selects by eloquence, glib and embellished speech will prevail, while forthright and upright counsel will fade. If he selects by demeanor, those who appear upright but are inwardly corrupt will rise, while those of true integrity will be overlooked. If such errors persist, the more \"worthy\" men are appointed, the more governance will stray; the more decrees are issued, the more the people will be thrown into chaos.\n\nThe realm is the greatest vessel, and the throne the most weighty position. With worthy men, the state is pacified; without them, it falls into chaos. Thus, a ruler must labor to seek the worthy and rest in their employment. Alas! How can one who guards the state and gathers the people not carefully test men of talent?\n\nThe greatest loss of human sentiment lies in the ruler’s failure to attend to it, and nothing is more grievous than miscarriages of justice. A discerning judge may employ various means to resolve disputes: deceit to lure, threats to coerce, empathy to persuade, or punishment to press. Though methods may differ, justice must prevail.\n\nThus, the people will have no cause for gratitude in life or resentment in death. One who governs, appoints officials, and administers justice in this way holds the highest office. In such an age, the people’s sentiments are harmonized, all occupations are respected, and interactions between superiors and inferiors are orderly and stable. The state stands firm as a single household; how could it be shaken? If even one act defies this principle, disorder will arise—how could stability endure?",

Upon hearing even a single instance of virtue, he would rejoice for days on end. [King Ping succeeded the reigns of You and Li, when the realm was in turmoil and all discipline had collapsed. Thereupon, he restored order, reverted to the right Way, and moved east to Luoyi, where he reformed past errors and devoted himself to seeking wise men. Whenever he heard of even one good deed, his delight would last for days, as he dwelt in the royal city—Luoyi. \"等\" here means \"to obtain.\"]\n\nHis attendants and servants, seeing the king’s joy, repeatedly spoke of great ministers who were exceptionally worthy. Thus passed more than a year. [The attendants and servants were minor officials close to the king. Observing his delight, they flattered him to curry favor.]\n\nThe king said: \"I, alone, am not enlightened in virtue and have made it my duty to seek the worthy and exceptional.

In the past, sycophantic servants repeatedly praised those in power, gradually elevating them through the favor of my attendants.

      "translated_text": "When customs knew no taboos, restraint and closure gave way to openness and ease, and joyful exchange flourished. For all that was restrained or closed arose from taboos; when taboos were absent, all could open and expand.\n\nWhen offenses were easy to avoid and difficult to commit, likes and dislikes became distinct, and people guarded virtue and knew shame. To value virtue is to avoid transgression; to know shame is to shun offense.\n\nTo willingly perform service and delight in one’s work is called *shun* (harmonious compliance). To rejoice in exchange and connection is called *he* (harmony). To guard virtue and know shame is called *zheng* (rectitude). The indolent and dissolute cannot surpass the *shun*; the rebellious and unruly cannot surpass the *he*; the deceitful and perverse cannot surpass the *zheng*. *Shun*, *he*, and *zheng*—these three are the foundation of governing a state.\n\nIn the degenerate age of *shuai* (衰), carriages and robes became ornate and cunning, statutes and decrees turned to superstitious prayers, and the net of laws grew biased and perverse. When carriages and robes were ornate and cunning, admiration and emulation spread like wildfire. When statutes and decrees relied on superstitious prayers, taboos multiplied. When the net of laws was biased and perverse, none knew how to escape it.\n\nThus, when admiration and emulation spread like wildfire, people abandoned loyalty and purity, shamed simplicity, and prized ostentation. When taboos multiplied, emotions became obstructed, and superiors and inferiors grew estranged and contentious. When none knew how to escape, slander and flattery flourished, and the masses feared not death.\n\nTo shame simplicity and prize ostentation is called *fu* (frivolity). For superiors and inferiors to grow estranged and contentious is called *se* (obstruction). For the masses to fear not death is called *mao* (recklessness). The truly upright would not serve in a *fu* state; the impartial and forthright would not serve in a *se* state; the capable and talented would not serve in a *mao* state. *Fu*, *se*, and *mao*—these three are the ladder to a state’s ruin.\n\nKing Xiong Yu of Jing (荆) asked about floods, droughts, order, and chaos. Kang Cangzi replied: “Floods and droughts arise from Heaven; order and chaos arise from man. If men are harmonious and the state well-governed, even floods and droughts cannot harm it—such were the cases of Yao and Tang. Thus, the *Zhou’s Rites of Office* states: ‘Man’s strength prevails over the land.’ But if men bring ruin and chaos, even without floods or droughts, the state will daily crumble and collapse—such was the fall of Jie and Zhou. Their destruction was not due to floods or droughts alone.”\n\nThe King of Jing faced north, followed in reverence, and bowed deeply, saying: “Heaven has not abandoned this unworthy one, allowing me to hear these words.” He then presented Kang Cangzi with ten pairs of fine jade disks as a gift for longevity and bowed to him as *Ya Yin* (Vice Minister), saying: “May my state yet recover?”\n\nKang Cangzi, unable to refuse, spent the night in contemplation, then departed in plain clothes for another land.\n\nIn an era of supreme governance, mountains harbored no false beasts, markets offered no deceptive profits, courts granted no stipends to flatterers, and the state’s resources were managed by men of integrity. Zichan (子产, a minister of Zheng) asked: “How does one obtain such people and foster such pure customs?”\n\nKang Cangzi replied: “When governance is harsh and oppressive, people grow cunning and deceitful. When governance is simple and unified, people remain pure and honest. Customs follow the shape of state governance as a looper caterpillar conforms to the leaf it clings to. Eat yellow, and the body turns yellow; eat green, and the body turns green. How could it be otherwise?\n\n“When people grow wealthy: levy taxes in due season, and officials remain pure and frugal. When taxes are levied without restraint and officials grow extravagant and indulgent, people grow poor.\n\n“The arrows of Gou Yue, tipped with refined metal and fletched with the feathers of hawks and falcons, strike with the force of a cudgel—yet they differ not from a crude wooden shaft when all choice is absent.”",

      "translated_text": "The talons of hawks and falcons, the beaks of eagles and owls—these are for striking. As the *Erya* states: “Among the finest products of the southeast is the arrow of Kuaiji.” The land of Gou Yue forges arrowheads from refined metal and fletches them with the feathers of falcons, yet when used for striking, they differ not from a crude wooden shaft—no choice remains.\n\nWhen it comes to sweeping away bandits, contending in battle, displaying martial prowess, and deciding victory, if such arrows are fitted to a powerful crossbow, then at three hundred paces no enemy will stand. The sword *Feijing*, whose might seizes the radiance of the white sun and whose qi surges like purple rainbows—when used to reap grain, it differs not from a sickle blade. Yet when malevolent forces spread their poison, seething like boiling waters, and the sword is wielded in the palm, then within a thousand *li* no evil will linger. Thus, materials have their proper divisions, and uses have their fitting applications; one must simply follow the times in their employment.\n\nIn ancient times, enlightened kings and sagely emperors brought harmony below and peace to all, allowing the myriad things to flourish and all natures to reach their fullest. They followed the times without disturbance. But in later ages, the world below teemed with deceit and villainy, while the upright were few; the frivolous and profit-seeking were many, while those who withdrew in tranquility were rare. The wicked spoke words equal to those of the loyal, their cunning and falsehood confounding truth, making governance untenable.\n\nThus, the people below deceived one another in turn—how lamentable! Laws are made easy to observe yet hard to violate; abuses are remedied by simplifying and unifying commands, eradicating tyranny so that officials dare not pursue private gain. When officials do not pursue private gain, the people grow wealthy. As the *Shi Xing* states: “Calamities are pardoned; amnesties are granted.” But amnesties should not be frequent, for frequent pardons allow the wicked to scheme, and the common people to grow restless. Then the worthy and good become obstructed.\n\nWhen a great criminal is captured, officials, seeking to expand their case, falsely implicate the innocent, dragging in distant connections and forcing confessions out of sequence. By the time an amnesty arrives, the true criminals have already escaped unscathed, leaving only the self-inflicted suffering of the falsely accused. Thus, people devise schemes in turn, officials toil in harsh governance, and none can bring it to an end—all due to the excess of amnesties.\n\nPeople turn to evil and abandon the Way because they know there will be no punishment; they are encouraged to follow the Way and act with righteousness because they know there will be reward. Now, those who abandon the Way and act unrighteously are pardoned, while those who follow the Way and act with righteousness are harmed and go unrewarded. Is it not difficult, then, to guide people toward goodness?\n\nThrough the ages, worthy rulers and outstanding scholars who have examined this discourse have found that those who incur the resentment of the people do not fail to engage with them, nor do those who provoke the wrath of the spirits fail to offer sacrifices. Yet the more cunning and flattery abound, the more the people resent them; the more lavish the sacrifices, the more the spirits grow angry.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Way of the Ruler**\n\nThat which gives birth to things is Heaven; that which nurtures them is man. To nurture what Heaven has given birth to, so that things come to submit—this is called the Son of Heaven. In ancient times, Shun, possessing great virtue, thrice moved and established capitals—this was such a case. The movements of the Son of Heaven serve to preserve the qi of Heaven; this is why officials exist to assist him. Officials exist to preserve life.\n\nHeaven does not govern itself, so the sage acts on Heaven’s behalf to order things. The sage cannot govern alone, so he establishes officials to assist him. The purpose of establishing officials is to nurture things, valuing the preservation of Heaven’s qi and preventing harm. Yet later rulers, deluded, have multiplied offices only to harm life, losing the original purpose of their establishment.\n\nGrass grows dense and rots; trees grow dense and decay; people grow dense and sicken; the state grows dense, and a hundred evils arise together, leading to unrest that cannot be suppressed. This is what is meant by a “dense state”: the ruler’s virtue is not proclaimed below, and the people’s desires do not reach above. Thus, sagely kings employ loyal ministers and upright scholars, ensuring they dare to speak frankly and dispel obstructions.\n\nBy restraining oneself and returning to ritual, the worthy and good will come of their own accord. When the ruler plows and the queen weaves, the common people will naturally transform. From this, it is clear: the worthy and good can be awaited, not sought; those sought are not truly worthy. The common people can be transformed, not punished; punishment without principle is not the Way.\n\nYao was without the toil of rulers, yet the world was at peace; he was without the desires of rulers, yet the people each fulfilled their desires. He was without the position of rulers, yet the world was well-ordered; he was without the heart of rulers, yet the people each followed their hearts. There are those whom the people below love while the ruler does not, and those whom the ruler alone loves while the people below do not. Employing those whom the people below love brings peace to the realm; employing those whom the ruler alone loves brings peril. How can a ruler dare to indulge his own preferences? Alas!",
      "overlap_context": ", and the body turns yellow; eat green, and the body turns green. How could it be otherwise?\n\n“When people grow wealthy: levy taxes in due season, and officials remain pure and frugal. When taxes are levied without restraint and officials grow extravagant and indulgent, people grow poor.\n\n“The arrows of Gou Yue, tipped with refined metal and fletched with the feathers of hawks and falcons, strike with the force of a cudgel—yet they differ not from a crude wooden shaft when all choice is absent.”",

      "translated_text": "Now, petty persons often recite the classics and medical texts, or study strange arts and persuasive rhetoric, and are then clad in blue and purple robes of office. The foolish, gazing upon them, see only the robes; but the discerning, gazing upon them, recognize them as petty persons.\n\nThus, when a ruler is truly enlightened, to judge men by their words is order; to judge men by their talents is order; to judge men by their conduct is order. When a ruler is benighted, to judge men by their words is chaos; to judge men by their talents is chaos; to judge men by their conduct is chaos. The enlightened ruler, judging men by both words and conduct, achieves perfect order; the benighted ruler, judging men by both words and conduct, achieves only chaos.\n\nThe sage in employing men guards against the merit of what is heard, the merit of what is seen, and the merit of what can be spoken. Then the people flourish and govern themselves. In an age of worthies, names are not displayed, merits are not proclaimed, abilities are not vaunted—yet hidden achievements and subtle aid bring about a profound and unobstructed order. Traces of fame do not arise, and none vie for eminence; thus the sage values such an age.\n\nIf a ruler prizes the merit of what is heard, then petty men below will traffic in goods and chase profit to buy reputation. If he prizes the merit of what is seen, then petty men below will exaggerate their forms and flaunt strange arts to vie for advancement. If he prizes the merit of what can be spoken, then petty men below will practice glibness and polish their words to adorn their speech. When petty men below buy reputation, vie for advancement, and adorn their speech to gain access, governance collapses.\n\nAll rulers know that a mirror clarifies their appearance, yet they detest the man who clarifies their faults. A mirror clarifies their appearance—its merit is slight; a man clarifies their faults—his merit is great. To know the slight and lose the great is to be utterly deluded.\n\nAlas! If a ruler purifies his heart and reduces his affairs, his ministers will be reverent and frugal, guarding their duties, and great peace will naturally arise. Yet some find this difficult to accept—how can I fathom why? If the ruler’s heart, that inch of ground, is benighted and indecisive, then the myriad things within the four seas, both moving and still, will all lose their proper Way.\n\nThose who judge men by ear and eye have many officials and chaotic governance. Those who judge men by heart and thought have few officials and clear governance. Thus, in an age that follows the Way, the ruler seeks talents unseen and unheard; in a perilous and degenerate age, the ruler prizes talents seen and heard. Alas! How can rulers know this? When men are judged by ear and eye, all vie to snatch reputation; when men are judged by heart and thought, all remain tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue. When officials are tranquil and upright, diligent in virtue, they transform without speaking; when officials vie to snatch reputation, punishments fail to deter them. Does the ruler not know this?\n\n**On the Way of Ministers (Chapter Five)**\n\nWhen a state is about to flourish, the hundred officials of the court, though some are short and some tall, some ugly and some fair, some gentle and some stern, some upright and some flawed—though their words and appearances may seem at odds—when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all serve the state with forthrightness unmarred by resentment, demotion unmarred by alarm, and counsel that hits the mark without deviating from principle. Thus, Heaven is not confounded in its seasons, Earth does not fail in its bounty, the people do not disorder their affairs, spirits and gods lend their aid, and the barbarians are pacified, all things harmonized and nurtured.\n\nWhen a state is about to perish, the hundred officials of the court, though their appearances are fair, their complexions harmonious, their words suave, their movements refined—though their words and appearances may seem cordial—when one examines their aspirations and tests their hearts, all are bent on competing for position. Hearing of the strange, they are startled; seeing the unusual, they are alarmed; they scheme and envy, slander and obstruct the Way. Thus, Heaven sends forth calamities, Earth brings forth monstrosities, men commit violent deeds, spirits sow misfortune, the Rong and Di invade, and chaos multiplies. The myriad things fail to transform, human effort is not diminished, yet officials achieve success and governance flourishes—such are the loyal and worthy ministers.\n\nThose who squander wealth, harass the people, endanger offices, and hastily produce fleeting gains to curry favor with the ruler, heedless of the disasters they leave for the state—such are the treacherous ministers.\n\nIn an age of perfect governance, offices are filled by the right men; in an age without governance, men fill the offices. Zilu asked Confucius, saying, \"One who is honored in death yet serves men—what is in his heart?\" The Master replied, \"Let his heart be nothing if not impartial. Let his appearance be nothing if not harmonious. Let his words be nothing if not upright. Impartiality does not seek to be revealed; harmony does not seek to be mixed; uprightness does not seek to offend.\" The ancients, in their pure diligence, ordered the state and rectified governance; today, in their pure diligence, they cultivate themselves and polish their names. Those who order the state and rectify governance arrange affairs with clarity, each in its proper place, moving in accord with the times and conforming to the greater whole. Those who cultivate themselves and polish their names arrange affairs with clarity, yet remain distant and unconnected, bound by petty details. Thus, when the heart takes the Dao as its master, it aligns things to their proper place; when the heart takes mere affairs as its master, it misaligns things from their proper place.",

Ministers in high positions do not admonish; those in low positions are not impartial and do not merit their emoluments. When the ruler lacks solemn reverence, great ministers cannot manifest trustworthiness, and lesser ministers do not fulfill their offices. In such a court, the talented are not necessarily loyal, and the loyal are not necessarily talented. Ministers need not worry about disloyalty—it is fitting that they be loyal, yet the ruler does not trust them. They need not worry about distrust—it is fitting that they be trusted, yet they cannot act.\n\nThe highest type of person attains their nature and governs below with principle. The middling type of person attains their nature and governs below with clarity. The enlightened ruler employs the highest type of person by entrusting them with authority and granting them the freedom to act as they deem fit. The highest type of person refers to the worthy and good—impartial, upright, and free from private bias. When placed in office, they are trusted and delighted in, correcting and assisting. Though they may exercise authority with flexibility, they always return to rectitude.\n\nWhen employing the middling type of person, one must set standards for their achievements and demonstrate rewards and punishments. The middling type refers to those with skills and abilities—when they see goodness, they emulate it; when they see evil, they are stained by it.

Among the multitude, they are harmonious and upright without undue familiarity; the more they are respected, the more distant they become.

In their duties, they are diligent and discerning; in their households, they are frugal and guarded. (Subtle remonstrance refers to admonishing the ruler’s faults; praise refers to extolling the ruler’s virtues. Reverent silence denotes quiet prudence. Discerning means managing affairs. Guarded refers to vigilance.)\n\nWhen they remain unappointed, they conceal their persons to the end, hide their knowledge in their gaze, and seal their words in their mouths. They eat their fill, walk at ease, and cultivate their own goodness alone. They remain steadfast without resentment, and the wise do not doubt them, nor do those of keen perception doubt others. Among those who recognize them are men of insight: though their conduct is perilous, their countenance remains unaltered; though their words are modest, their principles cannot be uprooted. (This describes those who, in a corrupt age, do not waver in their resolve—though their conduct is endangered, their demeanor remains composed; though their words are humble, their reasoning stands firm.)\n\nGenerally, the worthy do not declare themselves worthy. (Those who boast of their own merits achieve nothing and are not truly worthy.) Their efficacy is seen in office; their merit is evident in governance. (By examining their official conduct and observing their actions, the worthy and the unworthy can be distinguished.)\n\nIn times of great peace, men of the highest caliber apply their discernment; those of middling ability exhaust their endurance; and the petty exert their strength. There was once a man of Qi named Pouzi, whose talents could have revitalized the state, and whose conduct could have stood alone. (Revitalizing refers to strengthening Qi. Standing alone denotes a virtue so lofty and unshakable that none can topple it.) He was filial and respectful to his parents, reverent and dutiful in his village. Though he lived in poverty with nothing to support them, he traveled far on the strength of his trustworthiness and integrity—yet for a long time, wherever he went, he found few who harmonized with him.

      "translated_text": "Here the man, staff in hand and feet weary, inquired of Kang Cangfang, saying: “I have heard that the perfected forget emotion—(the perfected empty their hearts and unite with the Dao in embodiment, thus forgetting emotion)—while the common folk do not employ emotion—(the common folk, dull in wisdom and strength, cannot rightly use emotion). Those who preserve emotion devote themselves to instruction and revere trustworthiness and integrity. (This refers to the middling sort. Those who preserve emotion hold trustworthiness and integrity in highest esteem.) Yet I know not what I can accomplish. (What can one do? To practice trustworthiness and integrity in person yet find little accord wherever one goes—one knows not what one’s ability may achieve.)\n\nSome accept what is untrustworthy as trustworthy; (the world contains those who take others’ untrustworthiness for trustworthiness.) some, though trustworthy, are not seen as trustworthy; (some possess true trustworthiness yet are not perceived as trustworthy—yet still they deem themselves trustworthy.) some diligently admire integrity and are called men of integrity—though integrity is not their nature. (There are those whose nature is not integrity, yet who are praised as men of integrity for their admiration of it.)\n\nMen of trustworthiness and integrity often stand alone in adversity, retreating in obscurity. How can one guard against the times and the prevailing principles of instruction?”\n\nKang Cangfang lowered his head and smoothed his lapel, then raised his face with a sigh and leapt up in song: “When the times are bright, trustworthiness and integrity flourish—(the times are bright when the ruler embodies the Dao. When the ruler embodies the Dao, trustworthiness and integrity flourish.) When the times are dark, trustworthiness and integrity lie hidden—(the times are dark when the ruler is benighted. When the ruler is benighted, ritual and integrity withdraw into concealment.)\n\nBrightness and darkness, flourishing and concealment—all rush in confusion. Whom would I favor? How fleeting, how inscrutable the drift of things! (All is in tumult. How could I show partiality? The times know order and disorder, thus the proper course knows action and withdrawal. When bright, one flourishes with the times; when dark, one withdraws with the times. Flowing with the current, following fate—how could there be partiality? Yet now you ask me, so I know not what you mean.)\n\nTo move with one’s true nature and find no response in things—this is true failure. When the true fails to move, the Dao is obstructed. (Trustworthiness and integrity are the function of the true nature; the true is the root of the true nature.)

If the ruler is tranquil and great ministers enforce the law without shielding favorites, nor blocking the path of those below, then worthy men will come of themselves, seeking employment.

The ruler achieves completion, the land attains peace, all things refine and transform, and spirits lose their numinous power. Thus it is said: virtue and uprightness may be awaited, not sought.\n\nIf the ruler is diligent and enlightened, and great ministers seek scholars with harmony and reason, then men of magnanimous conduct, vast integrity, impartiality, and steadfastness will arrive. If the ruler is harsh and exacting, and great ministers seek scholars with impatience and haste, then men of crooked hearts, cunning responses, who destroy integrity and break the Dao, will arrive. If the ruler is suspicious and jealous, and great ministers seek scholars with artful compliance, then men of strange lineages, unusual names, obsequious flattery, and bizarre arts will arrive. If the ruler esteems himself as worthy, and great ministers seek scholars to secure their positions, then men of excessive ornamentation, chasing reputation, greed, impurity, and superficial elegance will arrive. If the ruler is indecisive, and great ministers seek scholars with devious flattery, then men of inner loyalty and outer perversity, with venomous natures and harmonious words, will arrive. Thus it is said: talent lies in seeking, not in absence.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor obtained Chang Xian, Feng Hou, and Rong Qi—three ministers of the Yellow Emperor. King Tang of Shang obtained Yi Yin, and King Xuan of Zhou, in his revival, obtained Fu Shen and Shen Bo. Duke Huan of Qi obtained Ning Qi.

      "translated_text": "---\n\nThe term \"meticulous selection\" refers to scrutiny. Duke Ji said: \"It is said that worthies do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord—yet are there not also the unworthy who do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Indeed, those who are unworthy and do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord are certainly many. When the ruler embodies the Dao, worthies do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord; when the ruler lacks the Dao, the unworthy do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord. Rulers who embody the Dao are few, while those who lack the Dao are many; worthies under heaven are few, while the unworthy are many. Thus it is known that those who are unworthy and do not seek employment but arrive of their own accord are many.\"\n\nDuke Ji said: \"Worthies alone can save the state, but men of talent can also save the state. If both save the state, how then do worthies and men of talent differ?\" Kang Cangzi replied: \"Ah, how pressing is this question! To achieve merit and complete tasks without pursuing fame, to remain reverent, frugal, unadorned, and restrained—this is what defines a worthy. To achieve merit and complete tasks with glory in emoluments, fame in reputation, and satisfaction in ambition—this is what defines a man of talent. Worthies can pacify the state; men of talent can govern it. What is meant by 'pacification'? It is harmony and tranquility, where none know the source of their strength. What is meant by 'governance'? It is diligent leadership, where all acknowledge the virtue of their ruler. One worthy can command a multitude of talents with ease; a multitude of talents, when measured against one worthy, still fall short. Thus, worthies and men of talent occupy distinct realms.\n\nThere are those who dwell in mountains and forests yet clamor, and those who live among the common folk yet remain serene. There are those who clamor yet act rightly, and those who are serene yet act perversely. Generally, when observing their appearance: those of coarse and vulgar bearing who possess worthiness are not few; those of refined and elegant bearing who are in fact petty men number nine out of ten. Without testing their words, one knows their culture; without demanding their demeanor, one discerns their measure; without heeding their praise, one recognizes their goodness; without following slander, one judges their truth. This is what is called having discernment.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Instruction of the Dao**\n\nMin Ziqian asked Confucius: \"How far apart are the Dao and filial piety?\" Confucius replied: \"The Dao is the wondrous function of self-so-ness; filial piety is the supreme virtue of human relations. The Dao exhausts the root and origin, while filial piety perfects human conduct. The Dao, though it encompasses heaven and earth, nurtures the myriad things, and brings all categories to completion, does not seek long life or inherent nature. Its work is most substantial yet does not occupy the storehouse of things; it does not claim office yet holds no idle position; it does not usurp merit. Though one may seek it by touch or sight, it cannot be grasped—thus it is named the Dao. When applied to humanity, it is named filial piety. Filial piety is the proper name for serving one’s parents well.\n\nTo serve one’s parents well is to respect and comply with their fundamental intent, to follow their countenance in all things. In uttering a single word or forming a single thought, one does not forget one’s parents; in moving a hand or taking a step, one does not forget one’s parents. Serving one’s lord, one does not forget loyalty; dealing with friends, one does not forget trust; facing subordinates, one does not forget respect; pursuing goodness, one does not forget diligence. Even in the seclusion of a humble chamber, one does not relax one’s sincerity. This is what is called perfect filial piety. Thus, utmost sincerity reaches the spiritual realm, its radiance extending to the four seas—where there is resonance, there is response. This is the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nOf old, Shun’s filial piety was great indeed. His stepmother deceived his father, who repeatedly resented and hated him, yet Shun’s reverence and caution only deepened, without resentment. When they schemed to have him dredge a well and then buried him beneath the earth, at that moment, auspicious omens shook the land, and divine brilliance guided him out through a hidden passage. His devotion to their care grew ever more meticulous. Thereby, his profound virtue flourished, and he became the lord of all under heaven. This is the effect of serving one’s parents well.\n\nKing Wen’s service to his father, King Tai, was also exemplary. His father was advanced in years...\"",

      "translated_text": "Each morning and evening, he would invariably arrive outside the bedchamber gate to inquire of the eunuch, saying, “How is he today? Is he at peace?” The eunuch, who attended the lord at his side, would reply, “He is at peace.” Then King Tai’s countenance would glow with warmth and joy. If there was the slightest discomfort, King Tai’s expression would fill with concern. At every morning and evening meal, when the attendants presented the food, King Tai would examine its temperature. After the meal was served, he would know precisely what delicacies had been offered and how much had been consumed. When the eunuch reported illness, King Wen would don solemn robes and fast, emptying his heart and concentrating his will to pray to the spirits for his father’s recovery. The steward’s dishes were always inspected with reverence, and the medicinal broths were personally tasted. If the food was good, King Tai would also eat well; if the food was meager, King Tai would likewise not eat his fill. When his father recovered, King Wen would also return to his usual state.\n\nWhen King Tai later erred, King Wen would use a gentle voice to offer subtle remonstrance. Even for the smallest things his father cherished, King Wen treated them with utmost care. Thus, his virtue was perfected in his person, and the Dao harmonized all under heaven. As the *Elegantiae* says, “King Wen ascends and descends at the Emperor’s side,” meaning that King Wen’s conduct was such that Heaven itself aided him. King Wen’s composure, actions, advances, and retreats were all assisted by Heaven, so that even the tyrannical King Zhou of Yin could not harm him. His life was as long as the dream of awakening: King Wu dreamed that the Emperor granted him nine lives, and King Wen said, “What do you make of this?” King Wu replied, “In the west, there are nine lands whose lords will ultimately submit to you.” King Wen said, “Not so. I have a hundred, and ninety of them are yours; three are mine.” King Wen lived to ninety-seven, and King Wu to ninety-three—this was the mandate of Heaven.

      "translated_text": "A certain disciple asked about the meaning of teaching and nurturing. Confucius said, \"In all cases, the Three Kings’ teaching and nurturing must be guided by ritual and music. Music is that by which the inner self is cultivated; ritual is that by which the outer self is cultivated. When ritual and music are cultivated in tandem, virtue and bearing shine forth in one’s countenance, and thus one’s demeanor becomes warm and civilized.\n\nNow, if a minister would sacrifice his life for the benefit of his lord, how much more should one who benefits himself also bring goodness to his lord? For this reason, one selects and appoints loyal, upright, steadfast, and incorruptible scholars as teachers and mentors, so that they may understand the Dao of serving one’s father and the principles of lord and minister, elder and younger.

      "translated_text": "The character \"Zhuang\" may also be written as \"Wallace.\" Clad in a tall cap and a stern countenance, he wore a jade-encrusted sword at his left and pendants of jade at his right, their radiance casting leftward and rightward in mutual illumination. The Grand Master was reading without looking up when Duke Zhuang of Yan asked him, \"Does the state of Qi possess any treasures?\" The Grand Master replied, \"When the lord is trustworthy and his ministers loyal, when the hundred clans uphold their superiors—these are the treasures of the state of Qi.\" Upon hearing this, Duke Zhuang removed his sword and departed.\n\nAlas! There are those who, biased and obscured, pass their entire lives without self-awareness. The worthy, upon seeing such, are tolerant and say nothing; the petty, upon seeing such, mock and speak excessively. Relatives, moved by pity or envy, speak with divided intent. How detestable is this bias and obscurity, that one remains unaware of it! Thus, the lord examines himself as though he were always in error: when he dons his robes, when he takes his meals, he recognizes his faults yet fails to correct them—this the lord finds shameful. When he wishes to speak, if he knows his words cannot be put into practice, the lord seldom speaks. When reproaching others for their faults, let him first regard his own goodness; when reproaching others for their depravity, let him first regard his own rectitude. This is called \"turning toward clarity.\"\n\nThe conduct of the elder of Zhai Xi was most cautious and circumspect. Zhai Xi, pitying his elder’s nature, favored reckless and rash speech. One morning, Zhai Xi departed and returned by evening, saying, \"Jia is dead!\" His elder believed him. Later, Jia was found alive. Another evening, he said, \"Yi is about to harm me!\" His elder kept watch, but Yi showed no sign of enmity. Another evening, he said, \"Ding is ill!\" His elder observed him, and Ding was indeed unharmed. Such instances were numerous. Though the elder maintained his caution over the years, and though his admonitions grew ever more earnest, the people of his village and state resented his fault-finding. They plotted to kill him. Zhai Xi, hearing of this, fled in fear and informed his elder. The elder did not fully believe him, yet soon after, Zhai Xi was indeed killed.\n\nThose who speak excessively may appear open and forthright, yet there are also those whose words are measured but not discreet. Those who are frivolous may seem unsettled, yet there are also those whose demeanor is composed but whose hearts are restless. Those who are meddlesome may appear petty, yet there are also those whose outward conduct is proper but whose inner selves are impure. Such cases, if enumerated, would be without end. Without thorough understanding, how could one discern them fully? There are matters one cannot simply respond to as they arise.\n\nSome are inwardly still yet outwardly active; their activity makes stillness difficult. There are times when one cannot seek fulfillment. Some are inwardly desirous yet outwardly patient; they wait for fulfillment before finding joy. Thus, those who are outwardly still yet inwardly restless disturb their thoughts and harm their nature. Those who run about chasing profit exhaust their strength and lose their good name. Only by being indifferent and free of desire, unenticed by fame or position, can one preserve one’s body and keep one’s nature whole.\n\nPeople are born into their era; some, failing to realize their aspirations, declare that they have not met their time. This is no different from bearing the guilt of a crimson-necked crime, awaiting the moment of execution—how perilous! Those who do not conduct themselves with caution and speak with restraint, who offend the lord of their time, differ not from those bearing the guilt of decapitation, awaiting their punishment.",

      "translated_text": "Those of vast talent and comprehensive understanding who yet go unrecognized and unappointed may rightly say that the times are not pure and their mandate has not been granted—how could this be wrong? Those skilled in remonstrance strive to preserve the nature of those they counsel, pruning and shaping the emotions from which they arise. Thus, mutual openness and progress flourish, and reverence and sincerity deepen. Those unskilled in remonstrance assail the nature of those they counsel, blind to the origins of their emotions. Thus, mutual suspicion and estrangement grow daily, and what children dismiss becomes what the aged condemn. What pleases the eye becomes what troubles the mind.\n\nThose who harshly reproach the foolishness of their inferiors have not yet perfected their own virtue; those who harshly reproach the delusion of their inferiors have not yet attained their own clarity. The virtuous and enlightened should pardon the foolish and deluded; they should not reproach them. To reproach the multitude for their foolishness when one has not yet perfected one’s own virtue is to invite ruin; to reproach the multitude for their delusion when one has not yet attained clarity is to invite harm. The foolish and deluded suffer no loss, but those who harshly reproach them only harm themselves.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Guarding the Dao**\n\nNow, the Dao is the heavenly principle of humanity and the way of the state; agriculture is its foundation. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, decrees cannot be unified. When decrees are not unified, the state cannot be defended nor can it wage war. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, great wealth dwindles. When great wealth dwindles, people lightly drift away. When people lightly drift away, the state frequently suffers disasters, and all foster distant ambitions, no longer settling their hearts. When people abandon the root to pursue the branches, they favor cunning; when they favor cunning, deceit multiplies; when deceit multiplies, laws and decrees become artful; when laws and decrees become artful, they obstruct cultivation and sow disorder. This is not the way of guarding; this is not cultivation.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings governed the people by first prioritizing cultivation. Cultivation is not merely tilling the land; it is cultivating the will. When the will is cultivated, people are simple; when people are simple, they are easy to employ; when they are easy to employ, the borders are secure; when the borders are secure, the ruler’s position is exalted. When people cultivate like children, they have few private interests; when they have few private interests, public laws are established. When strength is devoted to cultivation, great wealth returns. When great wealth returns, drifting is restrained; when drifting is restrained, people die where they live, without divided thoughts, and the realm is of one mind. When the realm is of one mind, the governance of the Yellow Emperor and Qi nearly comes to pass.\n\nThe ancient sage-kings flourished in plowing and weaving because they taught the root. Thus, the Son of Heaven personally led the feudal lords in plowing the sacred field, and the ranks of officials were graded by merit to encourage people to honor the land’s produce. The empress and consorts led the palace women in silkworm raising at the suburban mulberry fields to encourage women’s work and weaving. Men did not weave yet had clothing; women did not plow yet had food. Men and women exchanged their labors and supported one another’s work—this was the system of the sage-kings.\n\nThus, they revered the seasons and the days, measured the harvest, and assessed merit. They did not rest unless old, nor cease unless ill. One person’s toil fed ten. At such times, earthworks were not undertaken, armies were not mustered, men did not leave their posts, and women did not marry outside, all to align with the agricultural seasons.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"The irregularity of the four seasons concerns only the five grains.\" Now, those who sow and plant are people; those who give life are the seasons; those who nourish are the earth. Thus, in cultivation, the furrows must accommodate the foot; in hoeing, they must accommodate the hoe; in weeding, they must accommodate the hand—this is called the Dao of plowing. Farmers produce food, artisans produce tools, and merchants produce goods. If the seasons are not revered and the times are wasted on earthworks, this is called the path of great misfortune.\n\nIn planting, those who sow early do so ahead of time; those who sow late do so behind time. When cold and heat are unbalanced, disasters befall the crops. After the winter solstice, fifty-seven days pass, and life flourishes. At this time, the beginning of plowing, the Dao of cultivation appears: one plants at the sign of life and harvests at the sign of death.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nWhen the seasons awaken, wealth and resources arise, yet they are not shared with those who lack; this is called *jue* [音期]. There are years of abundance and years of famine; one makes offerings to the earth in abundant years but not in lean ones. [Abundant years are years of plenty; lean years are years of scarcity. Offerings to the earth refer to sacrifices to the soil and grain. In spring, one prays for a bountiful harvest; in autumn, one gives thanks for ripened crops. If there is abundance, one offers sacrifice; if there is none, one does not—thus honoring the earth’s bounty and valuing human life.] Do not lose the proper time for labor; begin when the season arrives and cease when it passes. Even the strength of the old and weak may be fully employed. [To *dai* [迨] is to seize the moment. Though old and weak, they may be made to exhaust their efforts in plowing—this is the way of urgency.]\n\nThose who do not know the seasons act before their time, [meaning they rush into farming too early,] or long for them after they have passed, [having missed the proper moment and yearning for it in vain,] or, though acting at the right time, do so with insufficient effort. [Even if the timing is correct, scant labor yields little harvest.] These three are the lowest in the Dao of cultivation. [Though these three engage in farming, they fail to grasp the seasons, hence are deemed inferior.]\n\nWhen weeding, one must do so early, for this enriches the soil and loosens its texture. [Weeding must be done in dry conditions; when dry, weeds die easily, and the soil becomes fertile and soft.] Crops thrive in fine soil but grow best in firm earth. [To *zhi* [殖] is to grow. Sowing requires soil as fine as dust, so the earth is porous and roots run deep, allowing seedlings to grow strong. When rain comes, the soil firms, and the stalks stand steady.]\n\nBe careful with the seeds: do not sow them too densely or too sparsely. [Dense sowing is called *shu* [数].] When covering them with soil, neither stint nor overdo it. [Covering seeds with soil is called *shi tu* [施土]. If too little soil is used, the seeds are too sparse, wasting land; if too much, they are too crowded, harming the grain. Neither excess nor deficiency—seek the mean.]\n\nFurrows should be deep and straight; ridges should be level and fine. [Straight and true are called *duan* [端]. Deep, straight furrows allow water to flow swiftly; level, fine ridges ensure even moisture.] Below, they receive the yin; above, they receive the yang. Thereafter, growth flourishes. [Below, yin refers to moisture; above, yang refers to sunlight. Together, they foster life.]\n\nWhen seedlings grow in rows, they grow swiftly; when the strong do not oppress the weak, they all grow large. [Orderly rows promote rapid growth; when the strong do not harm the weak, all thrive.] Align the rows and ensure they are open in the center to allow cool winds. [Wind is written as the ancient character *feng* [风]. Arrange the seedlings in rows to permit airflow.]\n\nIf the harvest is poor despite much labor, the yield appears meager, as if stolen—this is the theft of cultivation. [Due to barren soil. The seedlings lack vigor, as if robbed.] If weeds are not removed, the field becomes overgrown; removing them too late leaves the seedlings weak—this is the harm of cultivation. [To *chu* [除] is to clear. Weeds allowed to flourish will later, when removed, leave the seedlings feeble—this is the damage wrought by human error.]\n\nWhen seedlings are weak, they should stand alone; [they should grow one by one, not clustered together.] when tender, they should grow together; [they should shelter one another.] when ripe, they should support one another. [To prevent lodging.] These three, like a clan, ensure abundant grain. [Like a human clan, mutual support yields a rich harvest.]\n\nThe danger for seedlings is that they do not sprout together and do not die together. [Uneven sprouting leads to poor growth.] In cultivation, those that sprout early yield grain; those that sprout late yield chaff. [The strong overpower the weak, so latecomers do not bear fruit.] Thus, in weeding, favor the elder and remove the younger. [Using the analogy of siblings, favor the earlier and remove the later.]\n\nIn fertile soil, do not allow overcrowding; in barren soil, do not permit solitary growth. [Barren soil is called *qiao* [硗]. Solitary growth cannot withstand early drought.] Overcrowding in fertile soil yields much chaff; solitary growth in barren soil yields much death.\n\nThose who do not know how to weed remove the elder and nurture the younger, gathering chaff instead of grain. When neither above nor below is at peace, the crops die in great numbers. Timely grain grows tall, with dense stalks and large ears, round kernels and thin husks, fragrant and glossy rice that is easy to hull and strong to eat. [Grain is called *he su* [禾粟]. Dense stalks are called *tong* [稠]. Round is *yuan* [圜].]",

      "translated_text": "Sweet in flavor is called *xiang* [香].]\n\nGrain that misses its season grows deep awns with slender stalks, sharp ears, much chaff, and greenish kernels. [Deep awns are called *shen mang* [深芒]; sharp means fine. Greenish kernels are called *qing ling* [青蘦].]\n\nMillet that ripens in season bears ears without awns, its grains plump and husks few. [Plump grains refer to those rubbed out by hand.]\n\nMillet that misses its season grows thick roots, flowering stems, lush leaves, and short ears. [Roots are called *ben* [本]. Flowering stems refer to stems with flowers at their sides; lush means thick and large.]\n\nRice that ripens in season has sturdy stalks, dense growth, and ears like a horse’s tail. [Sturdy means large; \"horse’s tail\" describes their length.]\n\nRice that misses its season has slender stalks that do not thrive, thick husks, and often dies prematurely.\n\nHemp that ripens in season has sparse nodes, bright color, strong fibers, and small roots. [Bright means radiant; strong refers to the toughness of its bark.]\n\nHemp that misses its season grows many branches, short stems, prominent nodes, and leaves prone to pests. [Many branches are called *fan ke* [蕃柯]; prominent nodes mean raised nodes.]\n\nBeans that ripen in season have sturdy, short stems, their pods in clusters of fourteen, growing in dense clusters, with numerous branches, close nodes, lush leaves, and heavy, plentiful seeds that satisfy when eaten. [Beans are called *shu* [菽]; clusters mean gathered together; \"satisfy\" means abundance.]\n\nBeans that miss their season grow weak and vining, with floating leaves, sparse roots, distant nodes, and small pods.\n\nWheat that ripens in season is dense and clustered, its ears in groups of fourteen, its husks thin and wings pale yellow. [Thin husks are called *bo yi* [薄翼]; pale yellow is *fang se* [防色].] Eating it makes one robust and strong.\n\nWheat that misses its season swells with disease, is weak, and grows sparse with sharp-eared spikes. [Swelling means roots and stems thicken and attract pests; sharp-eared spikes have many awns.]\n\nThus, crops that ripen in season yield abundance; those that miss their season yield scarcity. When all grains are cultivated in season and eaten, the four defenses of the body grow strong: ears and eyes become sharp, *qi* does not invade the body, no afflictions arise, and one fulfills the words of Master Kong: \"In winter, fullness brings warmth to the body; in summer, fullness brings coolness.\" When warmth and coolness align with the seasons, people remain free from illness. [Illness is pronounced *zhen* [疹].] When people are free from illness, epidemics do not spread. When epidemics do not spread, all may live out their natural lifespan. Therefore, it is said: \"Grain is the foundation of the people. When a king flourishes, he must prioritize grain; a king who does not prioritize grain abandons his people. A king who abandons his people—what kingdom can he rule?\"\n\n**Military Dao, Chapter Nine**\n[The military is an inauspicious tool, used only when unavoidable.]\n\nKing Jing of Qin sought to display his military strength to the world. [During the Qin era, the terrain of Yao and Han was perilous and secure, its troops strong and warriors brave, so he sought to display his military strength to the world, leaving none敢 to oppose him. *Shi* [视] means to demonstrate.]\n\nThe Elder of the Multitude, Bao Rong, was ordered to summon Kang Cangzi. [Elder of the Multitude was a Qin rank; Bao Rong was a person’s name.]\n\nHe awaited him in twelve fortified towns along the border. [The plan was secret; wishing to consult Kang Cangzi’s strategy, he stationed troops in twelve towns to await him, fearing he might not come. He secretly sent Bao Rong to press him, ensuring his arrival.]\n\nKang Cangzi arrived from Rongquan and was lodged in the upper guesthouse. [Rongquan was a place name in Qin.]\n\nKing Jing waited three days without receiving his counsel. He descended from his seat, faced north, and struck his jade tablet, saying: \"Have you truly no intention to aid this orphaned ruler?\"\n\nKang Cangzi, with a swaying motion and sidelong glance, replied: \"This humble servant has heard that the lord’s inquiry is extraordinary—why trouble yourself so?\" He then drew his sword and slashed at the mat.

      "translated_text": "\"Dzhen\" means \"I.\" King Jing’s inquiry is extraordinary—what does \"troubled so\" refer to? Does it mean King Jing takes warfare, slashing, and stabbing as his purpose? His question is base indeed.\"\n\nYet, if one follows where it leads and finds correctness therein, what more could be desired? [King Jing has asked me about the Way of arms, so I, in turn, follow his intent to correct it—this is not the ultimate principle.]\n\nKing Jing bowed once, raised his hands twice, gathered his embroidered robe, straightened his jade tablet, lowered his head, and sat, saying: \"It is truly as Heaven commands; I await your decree.\" [The *fǔrèn* is an embroidered lapel; *yì* means to lower the head. He wishes Heaven’s mandate to be bestowed.]\n\nKang Cangzi raised his gaze to the rafters and sighed, then lowered his head and composed his expression, saying: \"The origin of arms—where did it begin? It arose together with man. [The *cuī* are rafters; *xū* is a sigh. He laments that the question does not concern the ultimate Dao, so he raises his head to the rafters and sighs. The rise of arms began with man’s birth—it has existed from the very beginning, not only now.]\n\nNow, arms are the manifestation of man’s might. Man’s possession of might is an innate nature bestowed by Heaven. [Man has the nature of joy and anger, originally received from Heaven. Anger gives rise to might; might gives rise to arms—this is their origin.]\n\nThus, the origin of arms is ancient indeed. There has never been a moment, however brief, when they were not employed. [A *shàoxuǎn* is a short while. The passions of joy and anger are used without constancy, so there is no brief moment when they are not in use.]\n\nWhether base or noble, wise or foolish, all observe this together. [Together they observe the stirring of angry *qi* and thus know the origin of arms.]\n\nThe omen of arms lies in the heart: harboring resentment before it is expressed. Arms are swift glances and fierce countenances; arms are haughty words and violent shoving; arms are extravagant quarrels and assaults in battle. These four are disputes great and small. [Resentment is anger; *zuòsè* is a stern countenance; *zūn* means to push; it refers to mutual shoving. Though these four differ in scale, all arise from anger and thus become arms.]\n\nBefore the time of Chiyou, men truly wielded timber to fight. [Chiyou was a feudal lord of the Yellow Emperor’s time, with eighty-one brothers, all copper-headed and iron-browed. He battled the Yellow Emperor at Zhuolu and was the first to forge weapons, later destroyed by the Yellow Emperor.]\n\nThe Yellow Emperor employed water and fire. [Some diverted water to flood cities; others set fires to burn them.]\n\nGonggong raised waves. [Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the realm.]\n\nThe Five Emperors contended with one another. With each rise and fall, the victorious one employed arms. [The Way of arms has its rises and falls; all who follow Heaven and prevail may use them.]\n\nNow, if some die from taking medicine, should we forbid all under Heaven from practicing medicine? No. If some die from boarding boats, should we forbid all under Heaven from sailing? No. If some lose their states through arms, should we forbid all under Heaven from bearing arms? No.\n\nArms cannot be abolished, just as water and fire cannot. When well used, they bring great fortune; when misused, they bring great calamity. Thus, anger and corporal punishment cannot be abolished in the household; punishments cannot be abolished in the state; and campaigns cannot be abolished under Heaven. [Corporal punishment refers to caning; *yǎn* means to cease.]\n\nThe sage kings of antiquity had righteous arms but no abolished arms. [Righteous arms follow Heaven and respond to man, used to punish the violent and disorderly.]\n\nArms, when truly righteous, punish violent rulers and rescue the suffering people, who rejoice as if a starving orphan meets a loving parent or a famished beggar encounters fine food, crying out and rushing forward like a powerful crossbow loosed into a deep valley. [To rescue is to save; *pú* means a servant; a powerful crossbow shooting into a deep valley describes swift and eager movement.]\n\nVictory or defeat is not determined elsewhere but must return to human nature. Man’s nature desires life and abhors death, desires honor and abhors disgrace. Death and life, honor and disgrace share a single path—thus the three armies’ warriors can be united in heart. [If the ruler shares life and death, honor and disgrace with the three armies, though they be many, they can be made of one heart.]\n\nGenerally, an army desires numbers, but its heart desires unity. When the three armies are of one heart, they can be made invincible. The ancients who excelled in arms valued this above all. [The most excellent ancient users of arms valued caution in their commands.]\n\nThus, the stronger their commands, the weaker their enemies; the more trustworthy their commands, the more their enemies yield. Victory is first secured here, then achieved there. [Assessing the enemy and securing victory must begin with self-assessment. If one shares life and death with the multitude and unites the three armies in heart, victory is assured.]\n\nIf this is truly so, what enemy could be overcome? Generally, when enemies come, it is to seek advantage.\"",

      "translated_text": "If they come now and find death acceptable, reckoning flight as advantage, then blades need not meet. This is called the \"ultimate army\"—arrogant, cruel, treacherous, and contrary to righteousness and principle. [Such treacherous armies stand in opposition to the principles of righteous warfare.]\n\nTheir forces cannot both prevail nor coexist. [Righteous armies triumph; treacherous ones fall.] Thus, when a righteous army enters enemy territory, the people know where to seek refuge. When its troops reach the outskirts of cities and towns, they do not trample crops, desecrate graves, plunder granaries, or burn homes. They capture prisoners and return them, merely setting a time to meet the enemy, providing resources to distinguish good from evil, and demonstrating right from wrong. If, despite this, there remain those who are obstinate, cruel, and defiant, then the use of force is justified. [Obstinate and cruel mean perverse and rebellious; defiant means unruly. Even after demonstrating righteousness, if some remain perverse and disobedient, military punishment may be applied.]\n\nFirst, a proclamation is issued: \"Our army comes to avenge the people’s wrongs and uphold the Dao of harmony. Thus, though we conquer the state, we do not massacre its people; we execute only those who must be executed.\" [Only the tyrant is punished.] Then, they select the worthy and virtuous and honor them, seeking out the orphaned, the sick, the widowed, and the elderly to aid and respect them. [They assist the orphaned and infirm, showing reverence to the elderly.] They open the treasuries, distribute the stored grain, [The *Shuowen* says \"accumulated\"; Mao’s commentary says \"depicted as grain, from *shi* phonetic.\" Originally referring to regrown rice, here used for \"order.\"] and do not hoard goods, bestowing gifts with utmost courtesy. [They do not claim spoils for themselves but share with all, extending courtesy to seek the worthy.]\n\nNow, if someone here could revive one dead person, the people of the world would vie to serve him. [To restore life is to save; if one revives a single person through righteousness, all under heaven would flock to him.] How much more does a righteous army revive many? Who would not rejoice? Thus, when a righteous army arrives, neighboring states submit as if to flowing water, and people of other lands gaze upon them as upon parents. The farther they advance, the more people join them; before their words are even finished, the people flock in droves.\n\nAt these words, King Jing rose from his seat, [bowing his head in thought, then lifting it in realization,] saying, \"I have heard your teachings, Master, and unknowingly, my spirit fills the cosmos, my will knows its path, and my heart swells with ever greater reverence.\" [Having heard the Dao of righteous warfare, he cast aside his arrogant and treacherous heart, his resolve brimming to fill the universe, his purpose clear.]\n\nHe stepped forward, raised a cup in toast to Kang Cangzi’s longevity, [advancing to offer a toast, honoring the Way with solemnity,] then bowed and took his place among the ranks of disciples, his demeanor as solemn as in a sacred chamber.

Liu Zongyuan dismissed them as empty words, [lacuna], and many have not seen this book. Those who have often criticize it, some even claiming it to be a Tang forgery composed from Tang-era texts. Yet when the state of Qin attacked Ying, [lacuna], upon examining its [lacuna] as recorded by later scholars, it appears to date to the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras, when Daoist teachings were revered. The recluse Wang Bao remarked that Zhuangzi’s principles were like mulberry and catalpa trees, while Kang Cangzi’s were like the *wu* and *tong* trees—Kang Cangzi borrowed their phrasing and meaning to supplement what was lost. His intent must have been to preserve the old while compiling anew, or perhaps he followed [lacuna] characters to embellish its [lacuna] as an ancient text. Apart from the Six Classics and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, few works are truly profound—how much rarer still is this one? Yet within it, one or two passages may be worth adopting, and it is not merely a Daoist text that can stand alone. I sought this book for a long time without success until Master Wu, the Sacrificial Wine of the Nanjing Directorate of Astronomy, sent me this copy and urged me to carve blocks for its transmission to fellow scholars.
