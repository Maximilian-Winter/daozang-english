  "full_translation": "**Orthodox Unity Ritual Text for Conferring the Rank of Capital Merit (Dugong Ban Yi)**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Orthodox Unity Ritual Text for Conferring the Rank of Capital Merit (Zhengyi Fawen Chuan Dugong Ban Yi)*\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One of the surviving fragments of the early Celestial Master Daoist classic *Orthodox Unity Ritual Texts (Zhengyi Fawen)*. One scroll. Base text from *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (Zhengtong Daozang)*, Orthodox Unity Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n### **Orthodox Unity Ritual Text for Conferring the Rank of Capital Merit**\n\nThe Celestial Master states: Orthodox Unity Daoists who serve the Dao with merit shall be appointed and promoted according to their achievements, without presumption or deceit. Upon reaching Yangping, their virtue and practice gradually ascend, their teachings and transformations grow ever more expansive. They wear talismanic cords day and night, diligently cultivating the Dao, commanding spirit-officers and soldiers, and delivering salvation with proven efficacy. With unwavering sincerity, they uphold the precepts from beginning to end, maintaining pure reverence for their masters through the coldest seasons without fail. Thus, ghosts and spirits stand in awe, and humans and heavens place their trust in them. Worthy of leading transformation, they may serve as masters for all generations. They may be appointed as *Capital Merit (Dugong)* and entrusted with the essentials of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n### **Document for Conferring Capital Merit**\n\nIn such-and-such a commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the Orthodox Unity disciple Wang Ding, aged so many years (if already ordained, state the name of the abbey).\n\nBy predestined affinity with the Dao, their profound name aligns with the True. Endowed with a humble and harmonious nature, their mind comprehends the subtle principles. From youth, they have diligently pursued the Daoist practice, widely propagating the mysterious wind of the Dao. Their teachings have borne fruit, and their faith and sincerity remain unbroken. Truly, they are approved by both humans and spirits, their fame heard near and far. Their virtue aids all beings, and their merit stands foremost among the multitude. They are fit to be appointed as *Great Capital Merit* under the Yangping Abbey. Upon assuming this office, after a thousand days, if there are loyal and worthy successors among later generations, they may be freely appointed from the Cloud Terrace Abbey downward, to be received and practiced according to the Dharma.\n\nIn the reign of such-and-such a sovereign, in the year of the *Tai Sui* (Jupiter cycle), on such-and-such a month and day, at such-and-such a commandery, county, village, and hamlet, within the abbey, this white document is issued by so-and-so, the thousandth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master.\n\nLu Xiujing states: The *Capital Merit Document* of Yangping Abbey is not conferred upon those outside the lineage of the Celestial Master. Hence, it is said to be issued by the so-manyeth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master. For those of different surnames, it should state: issued by the Celestial Master’s disciple Wang Ding, the master’s name.\n\n---\n\nThis document shall be made of silverwood, nine *cun* in length and five *cun* in width, divided into seven lines, written in cinnabar, and stored in a yellow silk bag, kept together with the abbey’s register. If silverwood is unavailable, locust or catalpa wood may also be used.\n\n---\n\nIn such-and-such a commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the Orthodox Unity disciple Wang Ding, aged so many years, submits this ink petition:\n\nHaving inherited generations of Daoist devotion, as descendants of the withered-bone lineage, they have worn the abbey’s register and practiced cultivation and offerings without interruption, continuing to this day. Since receiving the Dao from their master, they have labored diligently day and night, wholeheartedly devoted, never idle or negligent. In propagating and delivering salvation, they have never faltered. Though they have not yet fully penetrated the realms of the hidden and manifest, their merits and effects, though modest, are evident near and far. Day and night, they aspire toward the Dharma, wishing to see their efforts come to fruition. They humbly request the conferral of *Capital Merit*. Upon examining their nearness of heart, they are deemed worthy to serve as a model for others. They are fit to be appointed as *Great Capital Merit* under the Celestial Master, with this document recording their office. From Yangping Abbey downward, they may freely transmit the teachings to worthy disciples of later generations, to be practiced according to the Dharma.\n\nIn the reign of such-and-such a sovereign, in the year of the *Tai Sui*, on such-and-such a month and day, at such-and-such a commandery, county, village, and hamlet, within the abbey, this white document is issued by so-and-so, the so-manyeth-generation descendant of the Celestial Master. For those not of the Celestial Master’s lineage, it shall state: issued by such-and-such abbey’s so-and-so.\n\n---\n\n### **Petition for Receiving Capital Merit**\n\nIn such-and-such a commandery, county, village, and hamlet, the Orthodox Unity disciple Wang Ding, aged so many years, bows his head and prostrates, presenting this petition for grace:\n\nHaving entered the Dao for many years and worn the Dharma for a long time, I humbly received the essential teachings from my venerable master. I have cultivated and practiced diligently, never daring to slacken or neglect my duties. In propagating the Dao and delivering salvation to men and women, though my efforts have not yet widely encompassed all, my merits and effects from Yangping Abbey downward have been duly received and upheld. Reflecting on the transmission to later generations and the circulation of the Daoist teachings, the office of *Capital Merit* oversees all abbeys. Without this document, the transmission would be severed, and later seekers of the True would find the path obstructed. The Dharma lies in attracting and guiding, and the Dao values completeness and adaptability. I beseech my Dharma master to grant me this accomplishment.\n\nIn the reign of such-and-such a sovereign, in the year of the *Tai Sui*, on the first day of such-and-such a month, Wang Ding prostrates and presents this petition at the gate of the Dharma master of such-and-such surname.\n\n[Marginal note:] *Cìcè*\n\nOf such-and-such commandery, county, township, and village, Wang Ding, aged so-and-so years.\n\nThe above is based on Wang Ding’s written petition and the joint recommendation of the male and female officials of such-and-such Grotto. He has come before your servant to seek appointment to\n\n[Marginal note:] *Cìcè*\n\nMay the pardon of your servant and Wang Ding’s thousand sins and myriad transgressions be granted. Humbly beseeching the twenty-four Grotto-Heavens’ *zhijun* officers, generals, soldiers, and the divine officials of heaven and earth, sun and moon, mountains and rivers, seas, and local deities—may all simultaneously bear witness. Today, Wang Ding receives from your servant the Great *Dugong* Register and Seal under the Celestial Master’s lineage, to preside over the immortal officials of the twenty-four Grotto-Heavens, serving as a master for future generations. Should he practice the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality, traverse the world, deliver beings and aid all things, assist the emperor, and heal the hundred clans—may all prove efficacious.\n\nWith reverence to the Most High, your servant humbly presents this petition on behalf of Wang Ding, bowing to the immortal officials, officers, generals, soldiers, and the *Dugong* Register and Seal document, submitting it to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Awaiting the proclamation in response, your servant is filled with awe and trepidation, prostrating in utmost reverence.\n\n[Your servant’s surname], of the Great Clarity, respectfully follows the statutes of the Great Mystery Capital. The disciple bows again, offering salutations to the ten directions, each with a single bow. The master then completes the incense ritual.\n\nThe scripture states: \"Without receiving the *Dugong* Register, one may not transmit the Grotto-Heavens to others. Violators shall incur the punishment of their seven generations, condemned to labor in Deng Mountain, filling the river’s service. For nine years, they shall suffer calamities of water and fire in this world. Beware.\"\n\nThe rites for transmitting the *Dugong* Register of the Orthodox Unity scriptures are hereby concluded.\n#1 Originally appended to *The Ten Summons Rites of the Orthodox Unity Scriptures*, now extracted as a separate text.",
