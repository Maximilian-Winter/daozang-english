  "full_translation": "**The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey*\n*Compiler unknown. Seven fascicles.*\n*Source edition:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Unity Section, First Subsection.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey***\n\nIn a dream, the messenger once spoke, foretelling that after five hundred years, blessings would extend to all living beings. Upon examining the chronicles, we find that from the *xinwei* year of the Kaiyuan era to the present, precisely five hundred years have passed.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong established a shrine to honor him, and the messenger’s name became illustrious. Successive sagely sovereigns of our dynasty have revered him: Emperor Shenzong devoutly bestowed a sacred title, and Emperor Huizong further conferred a precious register, elevating the messenger’s rank, exalting his sacrificial rites, and deepening the reverence of his worship. Auspicious omens and wondrous responses have followed in abundance—could this not be the fulfillment of that prophecy?\n\nWhen I, Yiwen, arrived in Jiujiang, I encountered the prefect, the Grand Master Hu Gongfang, who governed the commandery with purity and tranquility, harmonizing the people and the spirits. In the spring of the *jiaxu* year, the ancient rites were revived, and I was entrusted with overseeing the sacrifices at Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey. After the ceremonies concluded, I beheld the sublime landscape of the mountains and rivers—towering, vast, and layered in grandeur, beyond description. Truly, this is a place the lofty Perfected Ones would carefully select.\n\nAmong the abbey’s Daoists was Master Xiang Shishang, who cultivated himself with discipline and harbored a sincere desire to propagate the ancestral teachings. Observing that the transformative manifestations of the messenger had nearly faded from memory, he entreated me to compile these records. Though I dared not refuse on grounds of my own inadequacy, I have humbly arranged them as follows.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Ye Yiwen, Left Court Gentleman for Ceremonials, Vice Prefect of Jiangzhou Commandery, concurrently Commissioner of Agriculture and Farmland Reclamation, and recipient of the Fish-Bag Decoration, on the Day of Universal Offerings in the twenty-fourth year of the Shaoxing era.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey*: Origins and Founding of the Perfected One’s Manifestations**\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey*: Origins and Founding of the Perfected One’s Manifestations**\n\n**Tracing the Origins**\n\nAccording to *The Orthodox Scripture of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Dao*, the Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King both emerged before the inception of the Primordial Black. When the celestial radiance had yet to dawn and the murky vapors remained unclarified, the Great Void was a boundless expanse of swirling darkness. For over seven thousand kalpas, the primal luminosity first divided, and the Nine Blacks took form, each separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years. The Azure Youth Lord annotates: \"At that time, there were no years or months. Once the Nine Blacks existed, each was separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety *li* of dark years.\" The pure black ascended and clarified, while the turbid black descended and spread.\n\nThe Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King received the natural black, hence their designation as the Nine Heavens. The Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens is the true sovereign over all things that receive life. The Venerable Lord of the Nine Heavens is the ancestral master of the radiant virtues of all Perfected Ones. The Messenger of the Nine Heavens is the noble spirit who oversees and governs the myriad numina, the supreme authority who patrols the Three Realms to reward the good and punish the evil.\n\nFurthermore, *The True Book of the Phoenix Black of the Primordial Mound of the Nine Heavens* states that the Supreme Venerable Lord bestowed upon the Lords of the Five Marchmounts the power to avert calamities and dispel misfortunes. Within it is written: \"The Nine Heavens Perfected King subdues the thousand spirits and commands the multitude of numina.\"\n\n*The Record of the True Charts Descended in the Southern Tang* also declares that the Perfected Lord Messenger holds five titles: first, the Nine Heavens Perfected King; second, the August Thearch of Vermilion Numinosity; third, the Perfected of Fire Refinement; fourth, the Perfected Lord of the Southern Summit; and fifth, the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe August Thearch conferred upon him:\n- A ninefold luminous moon-shaped crown of golden dawn and jade,\n- A nine-rayed vermilion aurora robe of flying-cloud golden gauze,\n- A trailing azure sea-and-mountain skirt of vermilion aurora,\n- A single-layered feathered cloak with a vermilion aurora sash,\n- A red-jade aurora skirt,\n- A six-flowered gossamer robe,\n- Shoes of primordial vermilion light,\n- A tablet of supreme primal azure jasper,\n- Jade and kingfisher hairpins,\n- A golden tally of the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens and Perfected Lord of the Southern Summit,\n- The Sword of the Nine Primes,\n- The Seal of the Five Thearchs for Subduing Demons,\n- The Seal of the Nine Heavens Perfected King,\n- The Seal of the Numinous Might of the Inspector for Quelling Deviance.\n\nHe was also granted:\n- The seals of the Northern Culmen Heavenly Thearch, the Five Numinous Honored Spirits, the Celestial Soldiers and Officers,\n- The seals of the five hundred numinous officials, the Five Thearchs, the Three Officials, the Three Rivers, the Four Seas, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Watercourses, the Nine Yangtze Rivers, the Five Lakes, the twelve river-source nymphs, and their attendant soldiers and officers.\n\nWhite cranes and lions bore his carriage, Azure Dragons and White Tigers guarded his flanks, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits stood in attendance at his left and right, and the immortal maidens of the Nine Heavens and the twelve stream Perfected Ones formed his musical retinue. The Great Thearch of Fusang, the Spirit King of Yang Valley, and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate served as his attendants.\n\nDuring the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Messenger of the Nine Dragons; in the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Messenger of the Nine Capitals; and in the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Messenger of the Primordial Capital. In the time of the Yellow Thearch, he was the Messenger of the True Prime; under Emperor Yao, the Messenger of the Supreme Clarity; under Emperor Shun, the Messenger of the Nine Doubts; under Great Yu, the Messenger of the Primordial Yi and Azure Waters, aiding Yu in successfully regulating the floods. In the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he was the Messenger of Celestial Numinosity; and in the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Nine Heavens lie above the thirty-two heavens, governing the nine hundred million myriad heavens, earths, and beings. They correspond to the numbers of the Nine Palaces of the Middle Kingdom, the Nine Provinces, the Nine Stars, and the celestial divisions of the Great Unity, thereby determining fortune and misfortune. The great and minor cycles of *qi*, the disasters of the yang’s ninety-six, descend upon these divisions, each presided over by celestial thearchs and numinous officials.\n\nThe generation and transformation of beings are of vast and numerous reckoning. By aligning the Nine Heavens with the sun, moon, and stellar lodgings, they illuminate and oversee the myriad states of the world, the Nine Provinces and Eight Extremities, the ten directions and all realms, the allotted lifespans and destinies of heaven and humanity, and the noble and base.\n\nThe one who can stabilize the source of generation and transformation is none other than the August Supreme Thearch of the Jade Clarity, the Great Dao of the Primordial Ultimate. The Supreme Venerable Lord, dwelling exalted in the Nine Heavens, oversees the true transformations below. Thus, he commanded the Nine Heavens Perfected King to receive the August Thearch of Vermilion Numinosity as his messenger, whose majesty and virtue encompass the laws of the Three Clarities and whose honor ranks second only to the Heavenly Thearchs.\n\nThe authority of the Inspector is numinously responsive and perceptive; all that is heard and seen may be verified. Thus, we know that the Perfected King is a noble spirit of the heavens, who divides his true self to dwell in numinous abodes and descends to guard the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, benefiting the states and households. Embodying the August Void to propagate compassion, he acts as the agent of the Vast Heaven to manifest transformations. Through successive dynasties, he has been revered and worshipped; scholar-officials and commoners alike hold him in awe. His numinous efficacy is manifest—how could he be compared to the mere licentious sacrifices of lesser cults?\n\n**Auspicious Manifestation**\n\nIn the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, on the fifteenth day of the second month, the emperor dreamed in the Numinous Talisman Hall that a divine being with an imposing celestial retinue addressed him, saying: \"I am the Messenger of the Nine Heavens. By the mandate of the August Supreme Jade Thearch of the Primordial True Unity and the Supreme Venerable Lord, I inspect the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the myriad states and Nine Provinces, and the Eight Extremities within and without. I observe and patrol, assessing the allotted lifespans and destinies of heaven and humanity, the sins and blessings of living beings, and establish the General Bureau of Inspection. The Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens opened his sanctuary on Mount Qian in Shuzhou; the Venerable Lord of the Nine Heavens opened his sanctuary on Mount Qingcheng in Shu Commandery; and I now open my sanctuary on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. You should establish temples on these three mountains, and after five hundred years, blessings will extend to all living beings.\"\n\nWith these words, the emperor awoke. The following day, Xuanzong summoned his ministers and recounted the dream.\n\nAt that time, the chief minister Zhang Yue presented a memorial, saying: \"Your Majesty’s dream occurred in the spring, and perhaps its details remain unclear.\" The emperor then set up an altar, lit incense, and prayed with utmost sincerity. In an instant, clouds and cranes filled the air before the Hall of Embracing Primordiality, and an array of celestial attendants appeared. The messenger arrived in a chariot drawn by a green dragon, his divine countenance refined and radiant, his auspicious bearing flawless. The emperor bowed in reverence, and the messenger restrained him with his left hand. At that moment, five hundred spirit officials, the Water Deities of the Nine Rivers, the Twelve Stream Perfected, and the Twenty-Four Perfected of Supreme Purity stood in solemn formation. The assembled officials gazed in awe, and the emperor commanded Wu Daozi to capture the likeness. Within the reign, the imperial attendant Zhang Fenguo and the Dharma Master Zhang Pinggong were tasked with conveying the sacred image to Jiangzhou. He ordered Prefect Dugu Zheng and Magistrate Wei Chang to construct a temple on the northern slope of Mount Lu.\n\nThe abode of the numinous, the original palace, was personally chosen by the Perfected Lord as an auspicious site, situated in the northwest corner of Mount Lu. Earlier, Emperor Minghuang had dispatched envoys to search for fine landscapes among the mountains and waters, but none knew where to proceed. According to an old tradition, a resident named Chen lived on level ground when suddenly a Daoist arrived at his door and said: \"This land is fitting for the foundation of the messenger’s temple. Why not yield it? You shall receive divine protection.\" Chen replied: \"I would gladly do so, but my family is poor and cannot relocate swiftly.\" The Daoist said: \"I shall relocate you. Take care not to incur expenses. After your passing, you shall become the local earth deity of this region.\" With these words, he vanished, leaving Chen astonished. That night, a great storm of wind and thunder arose, and by dawn, Chen’s home had been moved to the southern slope of the mountain. Today, to the left of the palace stands the Earth Lord’s shrine, where offerings are made and its numinous efficacy shines brightly. The Chen clan of Yimen in Deyang are his descendants.\n\nThe palace’s foundation is situated before the peak of Sagely Governance. Extending to the intersecting ridges, it aligns with the direction of the Celestial Healer in the southeast. From the northeast facing the east, it embraces the return of the Greedy Wolf star.\n\nThe Black Hare’s birth signifies it, for the Celestial Healer governs the salvation of living beings, and the qi of generation presides over the nurturing of all things. The Daoist arts regard the restoration of bones to life as merit and the deliverance of people and salvation of creatures as practice. The Perfected Lord’s dwelling here is thus fitting. Seated at *yi* and facing *xin*, all aligns with the celestial will. To left and right, the dragon and tiger coil and crouch, bowing in mutual embrace—twelvefold in all, corresponding to the twelve earthly branches.\n\nThe great stream enters from *xun* and turns toward *qian*, then circles back to the *kun* quadrant. A separate brook, rising from Sagely Governance Peak, flows through *wu* and *wei* before merging with the larger waters. On all four sides, the currents circulate without cease, never drying in winter or summer.\n\nBefore the palace stands the anvil mountain, named *Ascending Fish*, which rises alone in reverent attendance. The outer anvil ranges from Ruichang County to the prefectures of Xin and Huang, stretching for hundreds of li in layered ranks like a screen. Girdled by rivers and lakes, they bow in homage to this palace.\n\nSagely Governance Peak towers above the rest, flanked by countless ridges in a thousandfold array, as if in service. To the south, it adjoins the blessed land of Tiger Brook, the sanctuary of Perfected Lord Kang, and the well where Master Ge refined his elixir. To the north, it spans the grotto-heaven of *Ode to Perfection*, where Perfected Lord Dong ascended amid the planting of dates. Behind it lie the ruins of Lü’s alchemical furnace and the remnants of his cinnabar crucible.\n\nAt its back, the Five Elders Peak presses close, its azure cliffs standing like a celestial rampart. That immortals and divine beings should dwell here—how could this be mere chance? It accords with the truth.\n\nAt the outset, Emperor Yuanzong dreamed of a messenger who declared that the site for the shrine’s construction already bore its own timber—requiring only labor to shape it. When the imperial envoy arrived, he selected a site before Sagely Governance Peak, where a spur of Mount Heng stretched forth, its contours rolling and swelling like ten thousand reined-in steeds. No sooner had the foundation been laid than tens of thousands of massive logs drifted down the water chamber, arriving just as they were needed, never falling short. Throughout the construction, divine radiance illuminated the worksite as if it were day. The laborers toiled without fatigue, and within months, the shrine was complete.\n\nThe envoy later dreamed of a divine being who said: “The pigments for whitewash and cinnabar-green lie here already—no need to seek elsewhere. Dig north of the shrine, and all five colors will be found.” Some say this timber was once prepared by the Prince of Jiujiang for palace construction, only to be sunk in the depths of Mipu, awaiting this very day. Ah, how extraordinary!\n\nTo the west of the shrine stretches a long gallery, perched above a deep ravine where torrents roar, their thunderous echoes resounding underground. The shrine was named the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger, and Emperor Yuanzong personally inscribed the six characters for its hall: *Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger*. In the second year of Shengyuan during the Southern Tang, the shrine was expanded into the Tongyuan Prefecture. Today, a market still stands before the mountain, known as the Prefecture Front Market.\n\nIn the second year of Taiping Xingguo under Emperor Taizong, the temple was renamed the Taiping Xingguo Abbey. In the sixth year of Xuanhe, Emperor Huizong further elevated it to the status of a palace with his own brush.\n\nPan Guan, the magistrate of Pengze, recorded its auspicious signs in *Records of Verifications*, summarizing five wonders at the shrine’s founding:\n1. Without rain or wind, the waters suddenly surged, shifting the ravine closer to the mountain—only to recede as before.\n2. Pigments of cinnabar and mixed hues emerged from crevices in the cliffs. Those who sought them for private use lost their way, while materials for the shrine’s needs were always obtained.\n3. On the night of the earth-pacifying ritual, wind and clouds raged for days. Yet when incense was burned and prayers offered, the skies cleared instantly. On the day of the ceremony, the heavens were serene, and at this propitious hour, distant \"immortal lamps\" shone forth.\n4. At the ferry crossing of Pengli’s waves, hundreds of passengers would sometimes appear, saying: “We journey to Mount Lu to pay homage at the Messenger’s shrine. Carry us, and we will reward you.” After crossing, each left five coins—only to find them turned to paper by dawn. Thus did spirits from afar come to revere the shrine, manifesting these auspicious signs for mortals.\n5. The Messenger’s entourage—dragons, lords, tiger officials, carved charioteers, some of clay, some of wood—would, upon entering the shrine, suddenly drip with sweat like a summer downpour, their faces glistening. The labor of divine beings left their perspiration flowing, a verification still preserved. Here, the distinction between human and spirit blurred.\n\nThese five marvels, rarely heard of in past ages, were carved into stone to be passed down to future generations.\n\n**Halls and Statues**\nThe *Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Investigator, Responding to the Dao, Guardian of Fate, Perfected Lord* was inscribed by Emperor Shenzong, though it later perished in flames. The present calligraphy is by Wang Guan.\n\nAt its center stands a statue of the Investigator, flanked by two golden youths and two jade maidens, with two spirit officials on either side. The Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, six each, stand in attendance. The inner walls of the hall depict the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Supreme Clarity and Grand Tenuity, while the outer walls feature the Twelve Perfected of the Streams on the left and the Water Lords of the Nine Rivers and Three Rivers Kings on the right. All were modeled after Wu Daozi’s originals, their appearances archaic and striking, their spirits vividly animated.\n\nBefore the hall, to the left stands the Guardian of the Dao, and to the right, the Protector of the Dharma. Beneath the pavilion are the Dragon and Tiger Generals. To the hall’s left wing is the Hall of the Three Officials, and to its right, the Hall of the Four Saintly Lords.\n\nOn the left side of the main corridor lies the Daoist Canon Repository, inscribed *Chamber of Jade Chapters* in the hand of Zhang Xiaoxiang of Huzhou. It houses 528 cases of scriptures, totaling 5,287 scrolls, with an additional 99 cases of esoteric texts never disseminated, donated by the Prince of Yang’s estate.\n\nTo the right stands the Hall of the Heavenly Master, inscribed *Hall of the Orthodox Unity*. In the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year of Shaoxing, by special decree of Emperor Gaozong, a grand hall was constructed behind the Investigator’s Hall to enshrine the emperor’s portrait and life-star, named the *Hall of Extended Blessings*.\n\nTo its right is the *Hall of the Merciful Salvation Perfected Lord of Zhang and Quan*; to its left, the *Hall of the Dragon King of the Three Mountains’ Streams and Numinous Blessings*. The latter was enfeoffed in the fourth year of Jiatai, as detailed later.\n\nIn the fifth year of Shaoding, the Three Clarities Precious Pavilion was built, housing the nine imperial thrones at its center. The left auxiliary tower enshrines the image of the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Venerable; the right, the image of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. In the intercalary twelfth month of the fourth year of Jiaxi, Emperor Lizong bestowed the three characters *Three Clarities Pavilion* in his own hand.\n\nThe side corridors each extend twenty-five bays: the left depicts the Investigator’s manifestations under various titles from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the present; the right illustrates the Investigator’s deeds since the shrine’s founding—rewarding good, punishing evil, and the verified miracles of cultivating immortality and praying for heirs.\n\nThe winding corridors each have five bays, adorned with images of five hundred spirit officials in celestial crowns and crimson robes, arrayed as if in audience, their faces distinct and arranged in order. These were modeled after Tang dynasty paintings from the Imperial Academy, a masterpiece of recent times.\n\nAt the center of the corridors stand three tiers of stone altars. To the left rises a five-story brick pavilion, atop which hangs a great bell inscribed *Scenic Sun*. To the right stands another five-story brick pavilion, housing a statue of the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, inscribed *Vermilion Mound*.\n\nBetween the two winding corridors lie the Inner Three Gates, inscribed *Gates of Purple Prime and Radiant Brilliance* in the hand of Zhang Zihu. Within stands a pavilion inscribed *Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection* by Zhang Lingliao.\n\nAccording to old records, the adept Liu Deben encountered an immortal who guided him into the *Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection*, whence this name derives. There, the Investigator examines the merits and demerits of mortals before departing.\n\nBeneath the steps lies a single stone, said in old records to mark the passage of Liu Yue, who entered and exited here. When Perfected Lord Kang Fu visited Liu by appointment, he knocked upon this stone to enter the grotto palace. Today, a pavilion stands over it, named *Liu the Immortal’s Stone*.\n\nBeyond this lie the Outer Three Gates, inscribed *Palace of Grand Peace and Prosperous Nation*. The original calligraphy was an imperial gift from Emperor Huizong, later lost to the flames of war. The present inscription is by Prefect Jiang Can. The gates adjoin the *Bridge of Transcendent Crossing*, where pines and cedars grow dense and lush, and the paths are paved with stone. A pavilion overlooks the post road, its plaque reading *Grand Peace Under Heaven*, also in the hand of Zhang Lingliao.\n\nBehind the main hall stand the *Hall of Daoist Records*, the *Lotus Pond Assembly of Wu Shuobian*, the *Hall of Embracing the One*, the *Empty Chamber of Yi Mountain* inscribed by Zi Xi the Recluse, the *Cloudless Heart Hall of Bubbling Spring*—so named because the Perfected Lord Qingxu Huangfu once dwelled here, its plaque in clerical script. The name derives from Emperor Gaozong’s edict, which spoke of *\"white clouds without intent in the imperial realm.\"* Later, Huangfu moved to the *Alms-Bowl Peak* within this palace, though the hall remains. Nearby are the *Pavilion of Listening to the Rain*, inscribed by Li Pingshan, and the *Jade Bridge*, inscribed by He Shiyin. The *Imperial Calligraphy Stele Pavilion* houses stone engravings of imperial brushwork, including portraits of *The Yellow Court Scribe*, *The Star of Longevity*, and *Guanyin*. Adjoining it are steles by eminent officials and nobles.\n\nTo the left and right, the mountain slopes hold over thirty Daoist cloisters, nestled by water and clinging to the hills, their windows delicate and bright, the sound of chanting resonant. Among them is the *Hall of Subtle Mystery*—now known as *Baoging*—where Master Lianxi left an inscription. The *Ink Immortal Spring*, named after Lü Dongbin; the *Celestial Harmony Hall*, where Su Dongpo’s inscription of *\"withered trees and strange stones\"* adorns the walls, with a postscript by Hong Chu; the *Old Gardener’s Hall*, commemorating Huang Tingjian’s travels; and *Baozhen Hermitage*. The *Fanghu Pavilion* is secluded among plum and bamboo, its vistas clear and serene. Zhang Lingliao’s plaques and inscriptions by renowned scholars abound.\n\nOther sites include *Zhenyi Hermitage*, the *Mirror Spring and Cold Jade Pavilion*, *Retaining Clouds Pavilion*, *Jade Green Pavilion*, and *Emerald Verdure Pavilion*—all celebrated in poetry collections for their scenic beauty and calligraphic treasures. Behind the palace lies the *Divine Blessing Dragon Pool*, with its upper, middle, and lower ponds. The uppermost lies within sheer cliffs, perilous and inaccessible, while the middle and lower ponds allow pilgrims to come and go for prayers. Woodcutters often witness dragons playing with pearls. When clouds arise, those before the mountain see the dragons ascend with them.\n\nThe *Immortal’s Scripture-Reciting Platform* features a stone jutting forth like an altar, its edges folded in layered stone patterns resembling curtains. In times of rain, woodcutters hear the sound of scriptures being chanted. The *Flying Cloud Cavern* can seat twenty or thirty people. Within, a hidden passage leads inward, nearly blocked by a newly formed stone. Though impassable, when clouds gather, rain follows; when thunder rumbles, skies clear. The locals use this to foretell the weather.\n\nBefore the palace lie the *Longevity Prayer and Life-Release Pond* and the *Golden Accumulation Pond*. Flanked by dragon and tiger formations, with pines sighing in the wind and moonlit vines, clear streams and strange rocks, the site is secluded from the mortal world—a true land of scenic blessing under heaven.\n\n**The Lotus Assembly**\nAfter the founding of the shrine in the Tang dynasty, Daoists Cai Xianjue, Meng Xianzhen, Wu Taiqing, Ouyang Faming, and Suan Zhiyin were selected to tend the incense and flames. The following year, on the first day of the eighth month, the jiao offering was completed. On that day, commoners and elders from the Jiang-Huai region, along with monastics and laypeople—thousands who had gathered unbidden—celebrated the consecration with unceasing day-and-night rituals. As lotuses bloomed in abundance, worshippers each plucked a flower as an offering, placing them upon the palace steps. Overjoyed, they declared, *\"This assembly is most auspicious—let us name it the Lotus Assembly!\"* They vowed to gather here annually on this day to pray for abundant harvests and to ward off pestilence. *\"May the divine envoys bestow their protection and grant us blessings!\"* With one voice, the multitude of ten thousand bowed twice and departed. *(From old records.)*\n\n**An Account of the Imperial Visitation**\n*Composed by Zhou Yanzhi of Jiangdong Circuit*\n\nBehold—\nIn the Kaiyuan era, when the Son of Heaven reigned in fullest glory,\nHe sat in lofty repose, radiant and unbound, dwelling in nonaction.\nPeople and spirits harmonized, Heaven’s will was fulfilled;\nThe Grand Astrologer, consulting the auguries, inscribed felicitous omens.\nThe Six Ministries gleamed deep into the vernal night,\nWhile the crescent moon, veiled in mist, bathed pavilions in light.\nGolden bells hung still in the palace’s quiet halls;\nThe imperial mind, serene and clear, abounded in leisure.\n\nWithin the vermilion walls of Zhaoyang Palace, the night watch stood guard,\nTheir ears attuned to the forbidden drums echoing through the halls.\nSuddenly, in a dream, the Emperor beheld a divine presence—\nA thousand banners, ten thousand canopies, descending from the empty sky.\nDark clouds dispersed, revealing azure celestial thoroughfares;\nThe Wind Lord and Rain Master dutifully attended their posts.\nDeities of Heaven, Earth, and the Watery Realms followed in procession,\nEscorting with reverence, front and rear, in perfect array.\nA golden chariot, drawn by dragons, stood amid the clouds,\nIts august form as stately as a jade tablet held in ceremony.\nRainbow banners and phoenix canopies cast their radiant shadows,\nWhile the faint chime of jade pendants rang clear and resonant.\nThen, from the azure heights, a voice resounded—\nThe divine host descended to the sacred capital, halting its celestial retinue.\nIt declared: *\"By imperial decree, I am charged with a mission,\nTo traverse the Nine Heavens and personally seek out the Way.\"*\n\n*\"I have heard of the secluded purity of Mount Lu’s peaks—\nI wish to claim but a single acre to establish a palace for the Dao.\nFor five hundred years, the rites of supplication have flourished here,\nBestowing boundless blessings upon all living beings.\"*\nThe silver arrow marked the swift passage of spring’s fleeting nights,\nAnd the Emperor’s tranquil slumber was broken by the cock’s crow.\nAwakening amid the fragrant halls,\nHis eyes beheld a world of blossoms, scattered and wild.\n\nAt dawn, the imperial cortege proceeded to the Hall of Bright Radiance,\nWhere, seated before his assembled ministers, he spoke of the auspicious dream.\nNone dared to deceive the imperial ear;\nThey pointed to the six dreams as signs for earnest prayer.\nAfter days of fasting and purification within the deepest halls,\nThe ritual procession emerged in the clarity of day.\nFive-colored clouds shimmered, more vivid than in the dream,\nNo longer a fleeting vision of Zhaoyang Palace.\n\nThe assembled officials bowed in unison, their voices rising in acclamation.\nSwiftly, the court painters were summoned to capture the scene in vermilion and azure.\nSealed decrees, bound in clay, were dispatched to the lands south of the Yangtze—\nA thousand gates and ten thousand households complied in an instant.\nThe imperial envoys surveyed the winding paths to Mount Lu,\nAs couriers, spring and autumn, bore the Emperor’s prayers.\nHeavenly incense and sacred petitions ascended to the Ninefold Palace,\nEach yellow wrapper and seal bearing the imperial insignia.\nDragon towers and phoenix pavilions soared amid clouds and mist,\nAnd by day, immortals were said to nest within their eaves.\nThough the years of construction stretched long,\nOnly the towering cypress and wutong trees bore witness to the passage of time.\n\nEach year, on the eighth month’s Lotus Assembly,\nThe people of Jiang and Huai hastened to offer gold and cowrie.\nNot merely to suppress malevolent vapors with upright virtue,\nNor solely to pray for bountiful harvests—\nThe jade-green ravine roared with ten-thousand-zhang waves,\nWhile emerald cliffs, layered like screens, stood sentinel against the flames.\nSpring thunder unleashed its fury, transforming dragons and serpents;\nNightly rites summoned the stars and constellations to pay homage.\n\nAlas! The chroniclers’ accounts are not without embellishment,\nFor fear of exaggeration, they may have subtly altered their brush.\nThus, the wondrous and the subtle have faded from record,\nScattered and lost, these marvels and traces of the extraordinary.\nYet we have heard of Master Xuan’s dream of the Celestial Music,\nWhere, holding his breath for seven days, he at last spoke of its wonders.\nAnd of Emperor Wu of Han, who dabbled in esoteric arts,\nSummoning fair maidens to his orchid-scented chambers on clear nights.\nTheir methods and schemes, though recorded in nearby annals,\nRemain vividly clear through the ages.\n\nHow could such auspicious signs be mere coincidence?\nFive hundred years have passed since that reckoning.\nThe supreme virtue of the Upper Realm rivals that of Tang and Yu,\nWhile the diligence of Gao, Kui, Ji, and Qi earned the sovereign’s praise.\nThe Nine Yi and Hundred Yue tribes heed his every command,\nAs the myriad transformations turn upon the pivot of the divine.\nAuspicious omens and felicitous portents arise without cease,\nAnd the harmonious qi pervades the vast expanse of the realm.\nIts ripples extend even to the lowliest creatures,\nFor the divine words were no empty boast—truly, they were not false.\n\nThis humble servant, narrow and unworthy, offers no grand counsel,\nBut having witnessed these wondrous responses, can only sigh in awe.\nI pray that the historians’ brushes record this faithfully,\nLeaving for ten thousand generations an eternal symbol of fortune.\n\n*From the old records of the abbey*\n*Concluded: First Scroll of the Verified Facts of the Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey*\n*Second Scroll of the Verified Facts of the Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Imperial Visitation*\n*Song Dynasty: Records of Veneration, State Rites for Spring and Autumn*\n\nIn the third year of Taiping Xingguo, on the ninth day of the fourth month, it was decreed by the Nine Heavens Investigating Envoy of Jiangzhou that on the fifteenth day of the second and eighth months each year—corresponding to the spring and autumn festivals—offerings shall be made without fail. On the tenth day of the seventh month of that same year, Jiangzhou submitted a memorial detailing the ritual implements and offerings, establishing a three-day Daoist retreat that concluded with dispersal, and setting forth three hundred and sixty altar stations. The blue petitions and vermilion memorials were issued by the Academy of Scholarly Worthies. Henceforth, this shall be the permanent standard for the prefecture.\n\nFollowing the triennial suburban sacrifices, an imperial emissary was dispatched bearing blue petitions and vermilion memorials inscribed with the emperor’s name, to conduct a five-day Daoist retreat and establish altar stations in gratitude. The intent of the altar stations and the text of the blue petition are as follows:\n\nOn the day of [year, month, day], the heir of Heaven, the Emperor [imperial name], respectfully observes the arrival of mid-spring and mid-autumn. He dispatches [official’s title] to Jiangzhou’s Mount Lu Taiping Xingguo Abbey to inaugurate the spring and autumn sacrifices—a three-day, two-night Lingbao Daoist retreat concluding with dispersal—dedicating three hundred and sixty altar stations to the Nine Heavens Investigating, Responding-to-Primordial, Preserving-Fate, Wondrously-Transforming, Assisting-Conformity Perfected Lord. These rites are performed to harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, to safeguard the state and secure the realm, and humbly to supplicate for the welfare of all living beings, averting calamity and invoking blessings.\n\nWe reverently address the Nine Heavens Investigating, Responding-to-Primordial, Preserving-Fate, Wondrously-Transforming, Assisting-Conformity Perfected Lord: Your true realm is pure and pristine, lofty and boundless in azure vastness. If our sincerity remains unflagging, we trust your divine gaze is not far removed. With this humble servant, who has received the radiant mandate...\n\nEach time I reflect upon my frozen virtue, I tremble in succession to the grand design. Now, as I encounter this era of flourishing prosperity, I am ever more indebted to your exalted luminosity. Gazing upon this blessed land, where the singular court has long stood, and as the seasons reach the mid-point of spring and autumn, we duly present the customary rites. Moreover, with the grand opening of the jade palace, we humbly hope for the descent of your swift chariot. May you perceive our reverent sincerity and accept these offerings of purity and refinement. Turn your vast creation toward us, and bestow upon us auspicious blessings. Thereafter, may the altars of state and the granaries overflow with abundance, may the realm be unified under one script and one rule, may the people ascend to wealth and longevity, and may the era be suffused with profound peace.\n\nWe look up to the lofty heavens, praying for your universal and perfect grace. Our earnest supplications cannot be fully expressed.\n\n**Rite of Full Dispersal: Prayer Text**\n\nMay the realm enjoy great peace, and may the black-haired people abound in wealth and longevity. We bear the descending gaze of the lofty heavens and present offerings of pure silk. As the season reaches the mid-point of spring, we extend our rites with solemn music. Thus, we concentrate our spirit upon the azure vault, directing our thoughts to the immortal capital, dwelling in fasting for three days to present our morning petitions in due time. Now, as the jade prayers are concluded and the golden chimes fall silent, we once more reveal our sincere devotion and solemnly proceed with the pure rites. We humbly pray that you bestow blessings upon all things, grant abundance to the ancestral altars, dispel pestilence and disease, and unify the realm under one script and one rule. May the hundred grains attain their perfect ripening, and may the four seasons be free from drought or excessive rain. May we forever rely upon your true blessings and long depend upon your radiant grace. Our earnest supplications cannot be fully expressed.\n\n**Prayer After the Concluding Rites of the Suburban Sacrifice**\n\nOn this auspicious day, we prepare the rites, presenting luminous offerings to the Emperor; profound grace is bestowed, and pure silk is distributed to benefit the people. As the seasonal rites are duly performed, we rely entirely upon the perfect grace of the host of spirits. With solemnity, we present the pure rites, offering our utmost sincerity. We humbly hope that the divine intelligence will deign to bestow its profound gaze.\n\n**Vermilion Memorial After the Concluding Rites of the Suburban Sacrifice**\n\nThe luminous suburban sacrifice has received the Emperor’s blessings, and through the divine assistance, the solemn rites have been accomplished. In harmony with the rites, we have prepared the fragrant offerings with utmost reverence, adhering to the true teachings and hoping that our sincere devotion will silently reach and move the spirits. May the divine power grant great protection. We humbly present the moist incense.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month in the first year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, by imperial decree: Upon inquiry, it was learned that the Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou lacks sufficient fine incense for daily offerings. The Hanlin Academy shall annually allocate three hundred catties of moist incense to the abbey, to be burned daily in its halls, corridors, and side chambers for devotional offerings.\n\n**Exemption from Taxation**\nOn the sixteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, by decree of the Central Secretariat and Chancellery: The petition from the Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou regarding the payment of summer and autumn taxes has been reviewed. By special grace, these taxes are hereby exempted, and the funds shall be retained by the abbey as permanent endowment. The prefecture is instructed to supervise and ensure proper allocation and use.\n\n**Bestowal of the Golden Treasure Tablet**\nOn a day in the ninth month of the first year of the Tianxi era, by imperial decree: Upon the completion of the Jade Purity Radiant Response Palace, a Golden Treasure Tablet inscribed with the divine transformation of the Sacred Ancestor, the Heavenly Worthy, and Great Emperor was specially bestowed for enshrinement and veneration at the Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. One Daoist priest shall be annually ordained to oversee its care.\n\n**Conferral of the Title \"Responding to the Primordial, Protecting the Mandate\"**\nOn an auspicious day in the first month of the fourth year of the Yuanfeng era, by imperial edict:\nIts wondrous workings span the Great Void,\nSoaring to the heights of the nine heavens,\nExtending to the farthest reaches of the eight directions.\nIt traverses above and below,\nIts gaze all-pervading, its scrutiny vast.\n\nThus is the Nine Heavens Investigating Envoy of Jiangzhou’s Mount Lu Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey—a noble spirit of Heaven, bestowing fortune upon the world. Yet its exalted title, though long established, has remained unaddressed through the ages, which is hardly fitting to repay the intent of the divine luminaries. Let its title be elevated to \"True Lord of the Nine Heavens Investigating, Responding to the Primordial, Protecting the Mandate.\" May this serve to guide wondrous omens, attract auspicious qi, and shelter the people beneath its grace.\n\nBy this edict, it is hereby proclaimed—let all take heed.\n\nPreviously, in the second year of the Yuanfeng era, the abbey’s Daoist priest Tao Zhixian, while repairing the foundations, unearthed an earthen jar from the ground, sealed most securely. Upon breaking it open, all within was five-colored soil, and a single bronze coin bearing the inscription: \"Responding to the Primordial, Protecting the Mandate.\" At the time, its meaning remained unfathomed. By the fourth year, when the eunuch Liao Weibao was dispatched bearing an imperial edict and a plaque inscribed with the emperor’s calligraphy, the coin’s inscription matched perfectly. At that time, Xiong Ben, Drafter of Edicts and Supervisor of the Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey, summoned the abbey’s superiors to investigate and verify the facts. The coin was then entrusted to Liao Wei, who presented it with a memorial to welcome the tablet.\n\nOn the evening of its arrival at the abbey, the Daoist priests Hu Youzhong and others on duty in the hall heard the strains of celestial music. Startled, they rushed to close the hall doors—only for the sound to cease. Such were its numinous wonders.\n\n**Prayer Tablet Inscription:**\nDescending and ascending between heaven and earth,\nIts height reaches the ninefold skies;\nIts circuits traverse the eight directions,\nSurveying all with measured gaze—\nGood and evil never err.\nYet fair recompense remains unfulfilled,\nAnd glorious names long absent.\nThus, with purified intent,\nWe reverently offer these hallowed titles,\nThat all the people may forever receive blessings and grace.\n\n**Jiao Rite Prayer for the Bestowal of a Sacred Title (Green Petition):**\nThe Dao’s mystery pervades the Great Void,\nIts transformations coursing through the eight poles.\nIn reverence, we receive its sheltering power,\nEver gazing upon its numinous radiance.\nHoping to exalt the Perfected Ones on high,\nWe now confer upon them a resplendent title.\nBrilliant as sacred script, it shines beneath the layered eaves.\nAt the purified altar, we solemnly array the offerings,\nInviting the celestial chariots to descend\nAnd grace this jade-like abbey.\n\n**Red Memorial (as before):**\nYour servant [Name] humbly states:\nIn offering titles to the exalted Perfected,\nInscribing them upon the sacred hall,\nAnd presenting purified offerings,\nAll is made immaculate—\nHow dare I conceal my sincerity?\nIn former times, the Divine Ancestor,\nSolemn and reverent, held the sacred in awe,\nIlluminating virtue and cherishing sacrifice.\nThus, the imperial will was established,\nThe hundred spirits received their duties,\nTheir majesty flourished,\nAnd the conferral of hallowed titles began.\n\nFor its manifestation of benevolence and utility arises at the very inception of form, thus it is called \"Responding to the Origin.\" Bestowing blessings and descending peace, it perfects boundless felicity, thus it is called \"Preserving the Mandate.\" The inscribed boards and hanging plaques gleam like the stars of Kui and Bi; the cloud-like robes and embroidered banners shimmer in gold and azure. Yet the canonical records remain incomplete, left to later generations to fulfill.\n\nNow, with my humble virtue, I inherit the sacred legacy. Alas! The great Dao alone flourishes, and the glorious deeds of the past alone endure. We expand and illuminate its splendor, engraving fine jade with its praise. All rites are duly performed, continuing the aspirations of our forebears.\n\nMay the resonance of our utmost sincerity evoke a luminous response; may trust and blessings attend my humble self, granting me abundant fortune. May it assist our realm, enduring for a hundred million years. As we record these events in their time, may they forever remain unsung in lament.\n\n**Memorial in Petition:**\nThe Perfected transcend proximity, and the great Dao defies naming. Thus, we adopt the old titles and inscribe new records. Envoys are dispatched afar to reverently announce this to the true palaces. Choosing an auspicious day through divination, we command the officials to prepare the rites. We look up, entreating the divine gaze, and bow down, reflecting our sincere devotion. May the long-neglected ceremony be fulfilled, and boundless blessings be bestowed.\n\n**Sacrificial Announcement:**\nThe wondrous Dao reaches the heavens, and its beneficent works extend to all things. Its radiance shines as divine brilliance, though its form eludes description. We reverently uphold its glorious titles, solemnly performing the rites of gratitude. Our sincere devotion is present, and its illumination is timely.\n\n**Rite of Presentation:**\nIn our office, we revere and exalt, daring not to neglect the duty of spiritual reverence. With utmost sincerity, we offer this sacrifice, fittingly adorned with words of luminous gratitude. Thus, we initiate the conferral of illustrious titles, devoutly extending our solemn veneration. We look up, entreating a gracious response, and pray for enduring auspicious blessings.\n\n**Dissolution Rite:**\nThe supreme spirits are formless, though beyond naming, their profound virtue resides in humanity. Following the signs given, we unify in reverent display, initiating the presentation of illustrious titles. May they accept our praise and exaltation, and may felicity and blessings endure forever.\n\n**Red Memorial for the Dissolution Rite:**\nWe reverently serve the exalted Perfected, initiating the proclamation of their illustrious records. Gazing toward the celestial vault, we extend our devotion within the sacred precincts. The blessings they bestow bring fortune to the people, and the pure felicity they confer extends the prosperity of our glorious reign.\n\n**Opening Memorial for the Installation of the Jade Records:**\nThe Lu Peak stands majestically, a true shrine of immortals and sages. The jade records are newly inscribed, illuminating the grand ceremony of this auspicious day. As the rites conclude in celebration, we dare to present wondrous offerings. May the sentiments of all be universally fulfilled, and our sincere prayers be extended.\n\nWe humbly pray: May the supreme spirits manifest their presence, their divine insight aligning with our devotion. May the emperor’s longevity be boundless, expanding the vastness of his imperial legacy; may the three seasons bring no harm, and the people and all things flourish in peace and abundance.\n\n**Dissolution Rite:**\nThis famed peak of Mount Lu is indeed the sacred abode of celestial immortals. Though its dreamlike appearance by day was first recorded in the Kaiyuan era, its renown has long resounded near and far, evoking the distant origins of the True King. In the world, he serves as an aide to emperors; in heaven, he oversees the functions of ears and eyes. A thousand years ago, his name was first inscribed in the Yuanfeng era, and four characters were initially added to his illustrious title. Now, as this felicitous time arrives, we perform these rites of veneration. Jade is engraved and inlaid with gold, its brilliance forming constellations in the heavens; from the imperial balcony, the records are proclaimed, enhancing the grandeur of rivers and mountains. As this splendid occasion unfolds, we choose an auspicious day to offer our prayers.\n\nWe humbly pray: May the divine majesty descend and manifest, its luminous gaze attending our offerings. With fragrant smoke rising in devotion, we together gaze upon the profound depths of the nine heavens. May vast blessings be proclaimed, and the era of boundless longevity be forever declared. May these blessings be bestowed upon all people, bringing shared joy in a hundred delights.\n\n**Renaming the Temple as a Palace:**\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month in the sixth year of Xuanhe, by imperial brush, the temple was renamed a palace. The Grand Master of Remonstrance, Wang Yijian, memorialized, requesting that an imperial plaque be bestowed. Thus, the emperor inscribed it as \"Palace of Great Peace and Flourishing Nation.\"\n\nAt that time, as the imperial plaque was conveyed by river to Xie Family Bay in Taiping Prefecture, the Dragon King of Shunji appeared upon the boat, his golden scales and jade claws over a foot long, coiling around the floral branches. He escorted the vessel to Qingxi in Chizhou, where three or four aquatic creatures raised their heads and roared. The Dragon King, from within the boat, turned his head to regard them. The officials and people of Chizhou gazed in reverence, and suddenly, he vanished.\n\n**Record of Marvels:**\nAt the outset of the journey, a divination foretold: \"The ritual at the original palace will be delayed by headwinds, risking the loss of the appointed time.\" Yet, at Zhenzhou, a favorable wind arose, shortening a half-month’s journey to a few days. Upon reaching the shore, the wind turned contrary as before. The prediction was precise, and all marveled at it.\n\n**Prayer Tablets for Protection and Exorcism**\n\nIn the year *Gengsi* of the *Shaoxing* reign, the thirtieth year of the cycle, on the seventeenth day of the twelfth month, the first day of which was *Jihai* (the day of the *yin-water* and *pig*), the filial Son of Heaven, your subject [Name], in light of the recent turmoil at the borderlands and the deployment of imperial troops, humbly beseeches the unseen aid of the divine to sweep away the demonic scourge and swiftly restore absolute security.\n\nThus, the Right *Chengyilang* and concurrent Military and Civil Administrator of Jiangzhou, your subject Zheng Jianzhong, is respectfully dispatched to solemnly declare before the **True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Investigation, Response to the Primordial, and Protection of the Mandate (Jiutian Caifang Yingyuan Baoyun Zhenjun)**:\n\nIt is held that the state reverently serves the gods, as recorded in the sacred rites, offering seasonal sacrifices in spring and autumn without fail, ever mindful of the luminous and mysterious protection bestowed by the divine.\n\nYet now, this vile demonic force has violated our frontiers. The royal armies have been marshaled, and we earnestly seek the aid of the gods to purge the borderlands of this miasma, swiftly restoring peace and prosperity, that all living beings may ascend to benevolence and longevity.\n\nMay the offering be accepted.\n\n---\n\n**Altar for the Empress Dowager Wei’s Ritual**\n**First Invocation**\n\nThe Empress Dowager, your humble consort Wei, respectfully presents multicolored silks from the ten directions and the *benming* talismanic brocade, proceeding to the **Hall of the True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Investigation, Response to the Primordial, and Protection of the Mandate** at the **Taiping Xingguo Abbey** in Jiangzhou. A full altar of Daoist priests is assembled, and on the seventh day of the eighth month, the **Supreme Altar of the Celestial Compliance and Prosperity of the Nation (Taishang Shuntian Xingguo Baotan)** is established after an overnight vigil. The **Threefold Jade Register Ritual of the Primordial, Supreme Great Net, Mystic Capital, Jade Metropolis, and Purple Tenuity Upper Palace (Yuanshang Tailuo Xuandu Yujing Ziwei Shanggong Sanyuan Yulu Daochang)** is conducted for three days and nights, culminating in its dispersal. A **Grand Universal Offering of Three Thousand Six Hundred Parts (Putian Dajiao Sanqian Liubai Fen)** is performed, invoking the exalted perfected ones to pray for the boundless longevity of the sovereign, the eternal stability of the imperial domain, the prosperity of the people, and the abundance of the five grains.\n\nFurthermore, it is hoped that your humble consort may enjoy firm teeth, clear eyes, and a strong, healthy body; and that the Empress, née Wu, may see her palace flourish with blessings, her lineage prospering like luxuriant branches and leaves.\n\n**First Petition for the Offering**\n\nWith reverence, I inherit the shelter of the Dao’s grace—how could I forget the devout heart of service? Humbly knocking upon the gate of Heaven, I dare to lay bare my earnest plea.\n\nI reflect that your humble consort was born to a sagely sovereign, her blessings gathered in the Empress’s chambers. Though her years have reached the prime of middle age, each day she cultivates the nurturing of filial devotion. Favored by the August Emperor’s regard, she trembles in awe before her own small self. Thus, she offers the remnants of her adornments and cosmetics, reverently approaching the profound depths of the jade palace. Carefully following the sacred rites, she seeks to repay her modest sincerity.\n\nMay the three thousand six hundred parts of the universal offering ascend as incense to the scrutiny of the heavens above; may the one thousand two hundred years of brow-longevity extend the cultivated lifespan of the Most High. May the Empress’s palace receive the fullest of blessings, her sacred sons and divine grandsons numbering in the thousands and millions. May my aged body enjoy the fortune of health and peace, my eyes seeing clearly and my ears hearing keenly.\n\nFurthermore, may the surplus of this grace overflow to moisten all within the Four Seas. May each year bring the auspiciousness of abundant harvests, and may the people know no fear of plague or pestilence. In this single chant, I lay bare my crimson devotion—might you deign to bestow your vast protection?\n\n**Second Petition (Intent as Before)**\n\n**Second Petition for the Offering**\n\nWith a heart of pure sincerity, I do not shrink from making my plea again and again. Though the vault of Heaven spans ten thousand miles, surely it will bestow its luminous regard.\n\nI reflect that your humble consort, having given birth to the sacred person of the Son of Heaven, dwells in honor within the palace chambers. Nurtured by the joyful devotion of the myriad realms, she has indeed been favored by the private grace of the Nine Heavens. Thus, she offers the surplus of her robes and ornaments, reverently approaching the secret halls of the immortals. Presuming to extend this humble offering, she seeks in small measure to repay the gifts of life and growth.\n\nReverently performing the true rites for the ten cycles of the celestial realms, she prays to augment the sovereign’s years, that the divine and the human may join in the threefold acclamation of Mount Song. May the Empress’s palace receive the auspiciousness of the sun’s dream, and may her later years flow on like a river’s endless course.\n\nMoreover, may the shelter of the Dao’s grace widely extend to all beings. May those who follow the Primordial Unity swiftly attain the wonders of ascension; may those who delight in the Buddha’s teachings swiftly enter the gate of perfect enlightenment. May the four seasons be harmonious as the jade candle, and may the hundred grains bear the golden signs of abundance.\n\nOnly by the great perfection’s compliance with desire do I dare to present these humble words. Overwhelmed by my reliance upon your grace, I trust you will deign to bestow your luminous regard.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for Border Protection**\n\nIn the second year of the Longxing reign, cyclical year *jiashen*, the eleventh month, on the day *renwu* marking the new moon, the twenty-eighth day *jiyou*, your subject, the heir to the throne, humbly petitions for the pacification of the borderlands, as the court deploys troops, and beseeches the granting of unseen assistance.\n\nRespectfully dispatching the Left Court Gentleman for Dispersing Culture, Academician of the Hall for the Diffusion of Literature, and Acting Prefect of Jiangzhou Prefecture, bestowed with the Purple Gold Fish Bag, your subject Tang Wenruo, I dare to solemnly present this offering at the Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses, the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate, within the Taiping Xingguo Abbey.\n\nI reflect that the demonic rebels encroach upon the borders, still wantonly wreaking their cruel ravages; the armies encamp in the wilds, yet have not achieved the merit of repelling them. Daring to lay forth my sincere devotion, I look up to your heroic scrutiny, hoping for the assistance of your numinous might, that no demonic visions may coil and fester.\n\nMay the offering be enjoyed.\n\n---\n\n**Bestowal of the Title \"Divine Grace\" upon the Dragon Shrine**\n\nIn the fourth year of the Jiatai reign, the first month, in accordance with a document from the Ministry of Rites, itself following a report from the Department of State Affairs, which had received a petition from the Jiangxi Circuit Transport Commission, based on an application from Jiangzhou Prefecture, which cited a memorial from Dehua County, submitted by the local scholar Liu Kui and others:\n\nThey observed that behind the Taiping Xingguo Abbey, at the Dragon Pool in the ravine of Three Mountains, the dragon’s response to prayers for rain from nearby clans and distant families has been manifestly efficacious. During the two years that Prefect Wang Rong served in office, whenever drought occurred, he prayed for rain, and the rains fell in answer. In the first year of the Jiatai reign, when no rain had fallen by the sixth month, the prefecture dispatched the Acting County Magistrate Chang Quan to personally visit the Dragon Pool, where he welcomed the sacred water and installed it in the hall for the offering. Before the rites were completed, a great rain began to fall, reviving the withered seedlings, and the year yielded a bountiful harvest. The prefecture then constructed a shrine at the Dragon Pool to honor and worship the dragon.\n\nThey petitioned for the bestowal of a noble title and shrine plaque.\n\nThe commission dispatched Shangguan Shiji, Vice-Magistrate of Yongxing County in Xingguo Prefecture, to personally investigate, and subsequently assigned Sun Ren, Vice-Magistrate of Fengxin County in Longxing Prefecture, to verify the matter. The aforementioned numinous traces indeed bestow grace and favor upon the people.\n\nAfter confirming the facts, they awaited the imperial decree.\n\nLater, the matter was referred to the Ministry of Rites for deliberation and submitted to the Department of State Affairs. Shortly thereafter, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices was instructed to deliberate. Following their report, it was noted that in accordance with the directive issued on the sixth day of the first month of the third year of the Jianyan reign, shrines demonstrating numinous efficacy were to be granted plaques first; and in accordance with the directive issued on the nineteenth day of the sixth month of the fourteenth year of the Chunxi reign, henceforth, shrines where prayers had been answered were to be reported by the circuit transport commissions in accordance with regulations, and imperial decrees were to be sought for their ennoblement.\n\nThe Court of Imperial Sacrifices noted that the transport commission of this circuit had already dispatched officials to investigate, verify, and report in accordance with regulations, and that the proper procedures for ennoblement had been followed.\n\nUpon deliberation, it was determined that, in accordance with the aforementioned directives, the shrine should first be granted a plaque, and the appropriate decree should be issued.\n\nHumbly requesting that the Ministry of Rites submit this to the court for an imperial decree to be issued for its implementation.\n\nAfter the Ministry of Rites deliberated, it was determined that the matter should proceed in accordance with the Court of Imperial Sacrifices’ findings.\n\nAwaiting the decree.\n\nBy imperial decree, the plaque shall be bestowed with the title **\"Divine Grace Shrine.\"**\n\n---\n\n**Jade Tablet for Protecting the State and Praying for an Heir**\n\nIn the first year of the Jiaxi reign, cyclical year *dingyou*, the tenth month, on the day *jimao* marking the new moon, the fifteenth day *guisi*, your subject, the heir to the throne, humbly petitions to safeguard the continuation of the imperial line and reverently prays for the blessing of an heir. Respectfully offering incense and gifts, I have solemnly established the subtle rites, commanding twenty-one Daoist priests to perform a one-day-and-two-night **Lingbao Ritual** at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou, culminating in the dispersal of an offering of three hundred sixty parts. I have pledged alliance with Heaven and Earth, invoking the manifestation of auspicious omens.\n\nCarefully following the ancient forms, I approach the presence of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses, the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate. I present a **golden dragon and jade tablet**, hoping that the Most Sagely and Most Perfected may deign to regard this crimson offering. I beseech that it be transcribed and submitted, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\n\nI reflect that the position of crown prince remains vacant, and the auspicious dream of the bear has not yet unfolded; the borderlands are divided by encampments, and the tiger tallies of military command are still deployed. Within, I desire to strengthen the foundation of the state; without, I seek to pacify the miasma of war. Gazing up, I recall the arduous accumulation of our ancestors’ legacy, and am deeply moved by the daily fear of failing in its succession.\n\nThus, I humbly offer grand sacrifices to the Supreme Thearch and earnestly pray at the renowned mountains. May the Most Sagely extend the benevolence of sheltering grace and generously bestow the power of sustaining aid. Should a son be granted in answer to the augury of *Zhen* and *Suo*, may the dynasty flourish for a hundred generations. Should arms be laid down to usher in great peace, may the four quarters be settled in governance. May the foundation of the state be secured in firmness, and the people and all beings be placed in tranquil repose. Reverently drawing near to the numinous blessings, I forever rely upon the Great Dao.\n\nYour servant [Name] is utterly consumed by the utmost sincerity of his prayers.\n\n**Memorial Requesting Additional Enfeoffment**\nYour servant Xiong Shouzhong respectfully pours forth his foolish sincerity, lifting his plea to the celestial hearing. In retrospect, I fear my presumption and willingly submit to the standard punishments.\n\nI reflect that your servant is but a withered remnant of the mountains and forests, a wanderer of clouds and waters subsisting on bamboo bowl and gourd ladle. My person drifts with the world, while my resolve is stirred by the times. I have witnessed the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses at Mount Lu in Jiangzhou—from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of antiquity down to the Tang, through successive dynasties, his name has changed, yet his manifest numinosity has descended with blessings. He governs the celestial and terrestrial mandate of the state and oversees the sacred charts of ancestral heirs.\n\nIn former times, imperial plaques were bestowed, lands granted, and enfeoffments and prayers established as enduring precedents. As for dispelling drought and flood, quelling the scourge of war—his responsive efficacy has twice been proven, as recorded in steles and annals. At the inception of the Perfected Lord’s manifestations, he declared that after five hundred years, blessings would extend to the living and the state’s destiny would be safeguarded. Now, five hundred and eight years have passed, yet none have penetrated the depths of his celestial hearing.\n\nI further reflect that your servant, though born of a Confucian family, was commanded by his father to enter the mountains. By grace, I donned the feathered robes and have tended the incense and flame of the Perfected Lord for over fifty years. Since my mistaken appointment as abbot, I have eradicated corruption, reformed abuses, and renewed the sacred precincts, leading the ranks of the Daoist clergy in prayers for the prolongation of the sagely emperor’s life. For every year’s abundance or scarcity, for the people’s sufferings and hardships, I have purified my heart day and night, offering sincere prayers in pursuit of responsive efficacy, aspiring to assist this enlightened age.\n\nThough I am not one bound by official duty or burdened with the responsibility of speech, my devotion to the state and love for the sovereign arise from innate nature. Thus, I dare to present this plea with reverent urgency, ever cherishing my longing for the imperial court.\n\nHaving collated the ancient steles and records of Mount Lu that document the manifest and widely witnessed efficacies of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Envoy for Safeguarding the Realm and Responding to Destiny—Perfected Lord of the Present Dynasty—I have arranged them into six sections: first, the origins and lineage of his founding; second, the inception and unfolding of his numinous abode; third, the enduring norms of his veneration; fourth, the ennobling precedents of imperial favor; fifth, the ritual forms of his iconography; and sixth, the wondrous signs of his responsive efficacy. This compilation has been transcribed into a single volume, sealed in a yellow silk pouch, and submitted herewith for Your Majesty’s perusal.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Majesty to deign to peruse it, thereby honoring the intent of our imperial ancestors in their reverence for the Dao, and devising measures for the enduring stability of the altars of soil and grain. May the precedents of former times be upheld, and the long-neglected rites revived in this day. Through the Perfected Lord’s intercession, may the winds of peace and prosperity of the *Taiping Xingguo* era be restored; through his safeguarding power, may the prayers for longevity, abundance, and male heirs be ceaselessly fulfilled. May the imperial domain stand firm, and the frontiers be pacified.\n\nUndeterred by the peril of the cauldron’s punishment, I dare to present this memorial in all reverence. Prostrate before the imperial court, I humbly implore Your Sagely Compassion to issue a decree, instructing the Ministry of Rites to examine past regulations, bestow an honorific title upon the Perfected Lord, and dispatch incense to the *Taiping Xingguo* Palace on Mount Lu. Let a grand jiao offering be conducted with solemn prayers to avert warfare and quell banditry, thereby fulfilling the five-hundred-year destiny of blessings for all living beings, and perpetuating boundless prosperity for myriad generations.\n\nI have presumptuously offended the celestial majesty and deserve death a myriad times over. With trepidation, I submit this memorial and await Your Majesty’s decree.\n\n*Submitted on a day in the eighth month of the second year of the Jiaxi era*\n*By Xiong Shouzhong, former abbot and superintendent of the Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, with reverence*\n\n*By the grace of the Mandate of Heaven, the heir-son of the Son of Heaven, Your Subject [Name], humbly petitions for the sake of the realm’s fragile peace and the incursions at the frontiers...*\n\nThe master and disciples have long been stationed at the front, yet no success in repelling the invaders has been achieved; the nightly cries of distress know no rest, how dare we cease our prayers and supplications. With reverence, we dispatch the Daoist of the *Shangqing Dadong Jinglu*, Xiong Shouzhong, bearing precious incense and offerings to the Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu, to open the altar and conduct rites, prostrate before the sacred writ, and ascend prayers to the Celestial Pole, thereby averting warfare and quelling banditry to safeguard the state and pacify the realm.\n\nWe reverently recall that when the Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, and Originator of Mount Lu’s governance first established his rule, he preordained the stability of the imperial throne. Five hundred years of blessings bestowed upon all living beings now coincide with this destined number; ten thousand generations of boundless prosperity for the ancestral altars shall be preserved for posterity. We humbly pray that the Nine Heavens grant their favor, the Three Realms shine their presence; dispelling calamities to bring peace to the times, and stilling the weapons of war without battle. May we further hope for timely rains and sunshine, abundant harvests of grain; may the myriad people be free from pestilence, and the four seas delight in the transformative blessings of peace.\n\n**Supplication to the Supreme Emperor**\nHeaven is impartial, for it aids only those of virtue; the Supreme Dao has its essentials, and only through sincerity can it be accessed. Thus, we command the feathered followers to reverently present these vermilion petitions. The frontiers are alarmed and disturbed, with beacon fires still ablaze in succession. Within, we are burdened by nightly anxieties; without, we are weighed down by the horrors of war. Our repeated offerings and prayers are bound to this plea, gazing upon the vast heavens with utmost sincerity. We humbly pray that the Way of Heaven be restored, and the hearts of the people follow their desires; may the great creation turn its favor downward, universally bestowing benevolence; may the Perfected Offices be commanded to fully extend the virtue of cherishing life.\n\n**Supplication to the Perfected Lord**\nInheriting the grand enterprise, we have been remiss in our duties; now, amidst these troubled times, we are startled by the clarity of ancient precedents. Thus, we command the feathered followers to swiftly renew the sacrificial rites. The thirteen emperors’ reverence for the Perfected Lord’s rituals—how magnificent! Five hundred years of blessings bestowed upon all living beings—now is the time. We vow to uphold the incense and flame eternally, in perpetual gratitude for the divine favor.\n\nWarfare encroaches upon the borders, and the master and disciples remain encamped in the wilds. The cruelty of the long battles along the Sichuan and Huai frontiers pierces this heart; the majesty of the nine provinces and all lands beneath heaven should rightfully return to the Middle Kingdom. We reverently recall the Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate: he manifested his supreme numen in ancient times, and his illustrious title was exalted in our dynasty; at the appointed time of auspicious destiny, he fulfilled the long-held hopes of all living beings. His thunderous commands swiftly sweep away evil vapors; his sunlit auspicious winds shall soon pacify the goodly multitudes.\n\n**Petition for the Conferral of Title**\n\nMemorial from the Ministry of Rites under the Secretariat-Chancellery, in accordance with the *Steadfast Integrity Document* dated the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the fourth year of Jiaxi (1240), transmitted from the Ministry of Rites via the Ministry of State Affairs, which received the petition forwarded by the General Secretariat. The petition, originally submitted by Xiong Shouzhong, former Supervising Abbot and Custodian of Jiangzhou’s Temple of Supreme Peace and National Prosperity, requests the conferral of an augmented title upon the Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, along with the performance of a jiao offering-rite, and the imperial bestowal of the three characters \"Three Clarities Pavilion\" for the sacred edifice. Following deliberation, the petition and accompanying register were forwarded to the Ministry of Rites for review and submitted to the Ministry of State Affairs. This ministry subsequently transmitted them to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices for assessment.\n\nAccording to the Court’s memorial, it is evident that the affairs of the Perfected Lord, as presented by Xiong Shouzhong, have long been marked by numinous efficacy. Since the Tang dynasty, manifold miracles have been recorded, and in our dynasty, during the reign of the Divine Emperor, he was first granted the title *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*. Successive sagely sovereigns have revered him with ever-increasing devotion, never diminishing their veneration. Upon careful examination of the submitted register, the six categories of evidence are fully expounded. His manifestations of radiant auspiciousness and the manifest signs of his responsive efficacy are indeed unparalleled by other divine shrines.\n\nWhen disasters of flood, drought, pestilence, or calamities of banditry and warfare arise, wherever earnest prayers are offered, swift responses follow like echoes and shadows. Truly, he aids the state and benefits the people. To augment his illustrious title is to fittingly expand this singular honor.\n\nRegarding the matter of additional enfeoffment, as petitioned, it shall be referred for implementation to facilitate deliberation. A formal review shall be conducted and submitted for approval. May the Ministry and Department duly memorialize the throne, and if the petition of Xiong Shouzhong is granted as now presented, await the imperial rescript. Upon receipt of this document, the Court shall issue instructions to the Bureau of Sacrifices to proceed with the enfeoffment. Further directives shall be sought for implementation, and the submitted register shall be returned with the department’s endorsement.\n\nThe Ministry has noted the Bureau of Sacrifices’ report, as previously recorded. Should the throne approve the enfeoffment of the Perfected Lord as petitioned by Xiong Shouzhong, upon receipt of the rescript, the Ministry shall instruct the Bureau of Sacrifices to proceed accordingly, awaiting further directives.\n\nThe rescript and register were forwarded to the Ministry of Rites for assessment. The Ministry then transmitted them to the Bureau of Sacrifices, which, complying with the directives of the Department of State Affairs, now reports: in accordance with the Department’s rescript, it is proposed to add two characters to the title *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*, thus designating him *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation*. A formal edict shall be issued. May the Ministry and Department duly memorialize the throne for approval and implementation. The Ministry has noted the Bureau of Sacrifices’ report, as previously recorded, and petitions the throne for directives, awaiting the imperial command.\n\nOn the eighth day of the fourth month, by imperial decree, the Ministry’s proposal, as transmitted by the Bureau of Sacrifices, was approved. The throne is petitioned to issue the edict and confer the title, awaiting the imperial command.\n\nWe revere the Supreme Emperor and cherish the myriad spirits. Among the exalted ranks of immortals, the secrets of the Daoist canon have long been recorded. Though the Three Mountains stand as pillars, their traces began in the Tang; the primordial qi, encompassing all, has ever stored its numen since the Great Beginning. Mountains and rivers alike submit to his governance, and the state rightly relies on his protection and pacification. Gazing afar at the Perfected One’s influence, We bestow this splendid appellation:\n\n*Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*.\nEmbodying the Dao in function, he enters existence and exits non-existence, preceding even the Lord of Heaven. None know his origin, yet his discourse on riding the darkness traverses the boundless. Once charged with his mission in the ethereal realms, he came to dwell in the numinous precincts of Mount Lu. Among the nine celestial offices, none surpass the dignity of the Surveyor; gathering the three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity, all fall under his vast oversight.\n\nFrom the reign of Emperor Taizong, when the *Taiping Xingguo* era saw the renaming of the temple, to the Divine Emperor’s time, when the title *Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate* was conferred and the palace named accordingly, his radiance illumines the Milky Way, and his majesty gleams in the Vermilion Palace of the Nine Heavens. Thus, We, in reverent adherence, follow the established precedents. The spring and autumn sacrifices are solemnly observed, and prayers for relief from flood and drought invariably meet with response. Perusing the reports of feathered-robed envoys, We envision the crane-borne chariot’s swift passage. To elevate his honorific title is to fittingly manifest his wondrous transformation.\n\nAt the dawn of the seven thousand kalpas, the primordial light first divided—hard to name with precision. For five hundred years, his blessings have flowed to the living, now fortuitously converging in this felicitous moment. Surely, the heavens’ repentance of calamity draws near, and the cessation of warfare across the four seas may be anticipated. May he protect Our grand enterprise and eternally secure Our august fortune.\n\nLet it be decreed: *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation* shall be his special title.\n\n*Records of the Perfected Lord, Surveyor of Responses, of Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu, Scroll the Second (concluded)*\n*Records of the Perfected Lord, Surveyor of Responses, of Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu, Scroll the Third*\n*Category: Veneration in the Song Dynasty*\n*Imperial Decree*\n\nBy imperial decree, the honorific title of *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation* shall be conferred. The Daoist overseer Xiong Shouzhong, under jurisdiction, is to proceed to Taiping Xingguo Palace in Jiangzhou, where he shall conduct a grand jiao ritual of one thousand two hundred altar stations, spanning five days and nights, presenting sacred memorials in reverent supplication. At Shousheng Guangfu Abbey and Dazhong Xiangfu Abbey, he shall likewise conduct jiao rituals of one hundred twenty altar stations each. All offerings and arrangements must be executed with meticulous adherence to ritual propriety, accompanied by solemn invocations. Should the Perfected Lord respond in manifestation, an imperial inscription shall be bestowed. A detailed receipt of all items shall be prepared and submitted in report.\n\nBy imperial decree, the Pacification and Governance Commissioner and Minister is hereby notified: Daoist overseer Xiong Shouzhong of Taiping Xingguo Palace in Jiangzhou, custodian of the Three Clarities Pavilion, is to conduct the jiao ritual at the palace, where the imperial inscription, incense, and other sacred items shall be reverently enshrined, along with the conferred mandate. The Minister is to inscribe the imperial name upon the blue-green memorial and prayer tablet, and to dispatch an official subordinate to the palace to preside over the incense offering. The designated dates shall be reported by Xiong Shouzhong, and the name, rank, and office of the appointed official shall be duly recorded and submitted in report.\n\nRespectfully endorsed on the intercalary twelfth month of the fourth year of the Jiaxi reign [1240], by Zhang Yanqing, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Pacification Commissioner of Baokang Prefecture, and Vice Director of the Palace Domestic Service.\n\n**Prayer Tablet for the Perfected Lord**\nIn the first year of the Chunyou reign [1241], cyclical year *xinchou*, second month, the first day of which is *jisi*, the sixth day being *jiazi*, the Emperor [Name] respectfully dispatches Daoist overseer Xiong Shouzhong of Taiping Xingguo Palace, who humbly presents a libation of pure wine and a feast of myriad delicacies, and dares to make solemn declaration before the *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation*...\n\nCrowned in the immortal capital, his Dao towers above past and present.\nHe pacifies and gathers the living, his blessings flowing to the earth below.\nThe unfolding of destiny is prolonged, truly returning to the Lord of the Origin.\n\nMeasuring against the hundred spirits, his numinous glory excels all. The exaltation of his august title is a grand undertaking. With special reverence and praise, in accordance with the Emperor’s sincere intent, we hereby make this solemn declaration before the divine intelligence, offering a libation of wine and sacrificial viands in grateful reciprocity. May the spirits partake.\n\n**Purpose of the Jiao Ritual**\nThe heir to the Heavenly Son, your subject [Name], prostrates himself in reflection: inheriting the great mandate, he aspires to illuminate the glorious deeds of his predecessors; flourishing the branches and roots of the lineage, he strives to secure the state and the family. Gazing upon the abundance of this felicitous connection, he recognizes that it is truly sustained by the protective power of the divine.\n\nWe reverently recall the *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation*—a deity of celestial nobility, the sovereign of the realm. For a thousand myriad years, he has bestowed blessings upon the ancestral temples; for five hundred years, he has showered fortune upon the living. His transcendent wanderings resplendent, it is fitting that his august title be exalted.\n\nWith due preparation of pure and modest rites, we extend our reverent praise. We have chosen the sixth day of the second month to proceed to Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, where we shall command all the palace’s Daoist officials to establish a five-day-and-night *Qi Gu* (Prayer for Grain) and *Fu Shi* (Fortune and Time) altar. In due order, we shall present precious petitions, consecrate the *Zhou Tian* (Circumpolar) star lanterns and the *Jia Zi* (Long-Life) lanterns of the sexagenary cycle, and conduct a grand *she jiao* (scattering jiao) ritual with one thousand two hundred altar stations. There, we shall invite and guide the arrival of the supreme perfected ones, ushering in the radiant solar essence.\n\nWe humbly beseech that the divine glory secretly protect and assist the sagely enterprise; that the three frontiers be pacified and the myriad realms secured.\n\nMay all witness the signs of purity and tranquility;\nmay the auspicious omens of heirship unfold early;\nmay eternal peace be bestowed, and abundant harvests be entreated.\n\n*Qingci* to the Supreme Emperor:\nIn the inaugural year of Chunyou, as we tread the auspicious threshold of royal spring,\nwithin the sacred precincts of Taiping,\nwe humbly hope to receive the private blessings of imperial favor.\nWith meager offerings, we inherit this glorious legacy.\nHeaven, knowing remorse for calamity, has fortunately eased frontier defenses;\nthe people, fearing famine, ponder the still-meager state granaries.\nEver inscribing our anxieties upon vermilion tablets,\nwe beseech the azure vault for succor.\nThus, we command the feathered ranks to solemnly invite the perfected ones’ arrival,\nto unfold the secrets of medicinal arts,\nand to renew our reverent offerings with refined devotion.\n\nWe humbly pray that harmonious qi may suffuse and transform,\nthat malevolent vapors be cleansed and dispersed;\nthat the blessings of a thousand fortunes and a hundred felicities unfold like wings;\nthat the circulation of grain and goods flow as smoothly as fish in formation.\n\n*Qingci* to the Perfected Lord:\nResponding to the mandate to safeguard destiny,\nyou prolong the world’s allotted span;\nmanifesting virtue and establishing merit,\nyou are revered by the imperial court.\nSince your sacred traces were glorified on Mount Lu,\nyour illustrious titles have been bestowed by former dynasties.\nNow, following the time-honored rites of exaltation,\nwe seek to manifest the wondrous transformation of the true Dao.\nThus, we present our petition to the Supreme Emperor,\noffering celebration and praise to the divine glory.\nWith solemn offerings of orchids and reeds,\nwe invoke the perfected ones’ arrival upon the mushroom chariots.\n\nWe humbly pray that the nine heavens’ wondrous creation may descend,\nblessing and averting misfortune;\nthat the four seas’ living beings be pacified,\nand the realm attain supreme stability;\nthat the wolf-smoke of war be stilled,\nand the auspicious dream of the bear be early fulfilled.\n\n*Jiao Intent for the Shousheng Guangfu Abbey and Dazhong Xiangfu Abbey:*\nIn the first year of Chunyou, cyclical year *xinchou*, on the eighteenth day of the second month (day *bingzi*), the heir to the Son of Heaven, your subject [Name], reverently considers:\nThe Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Inquiry, Responding to the Mandate and Safeguarding Destiny, Wondrous Transformation,\nwhose Daoist attainments are the wellspring of the tradition,\nwhose blessings overflow like a river,\nwho governs the sacred peaks and is the august spirit of the imperial court—\nhis divine strategies long renowned,\nhis illustrious titles ever augmented.\nFollowing the conclusion of the jiao rites of gratitude,\nas the hundred spirits converge in celebration,\nwe unfold the profound liturgy,\ncontinuing this grand occasion.\nThus, on the eighteenth day of this month,\nat the Shousheng Guangfu Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou,\nwe shall establish a one-day-and-night *Lingbao* Daoist sanctuary,\nreciting scriptures and performing the ritual circumambulation,\nconsecrating the star lanterns,\nand conducting a grand *qingjiao* (pure jiao) with one hundred twenty altar stations.\nWe shall invite and guide the arrival of the supreme perfected ones,\nreverently praying for the radiant solar essence.\n\nWe humbly beseech that the divine glory harmoniously assist,\nfulfilling the era of people’s peace and the realm’s prosperity;\nthat the frontiers be free from peril,\nand the signs of heaven’s clarity and earth’s tranquility be witnessed.\n\n**Green Petition**\n\nExtolling the wondrous transformation of the august title, the hundred spirits converge in celebration; facing the Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Heavens, a single thought flows forth. Not merely to amplify the brilliance of the sacred rites, but also to manifest the majesty of divine favor. Thus, we perform the rites of purity and reverence, jointly expressing our private veneration.\n\nWe humbly pray that the sagely enterprise be upheld, jointly preserving the grand design for eternity; that the frontiers be tranquil and serene, guiding the people toward great peace; that the imperial heir inherit blessings, and all under heaven enjoy clarity, harmony, and prosperity.\n\n**Memorial from the Prefecture Requesting Imperial Incense**\n\nYour servant Li Wenfang, on behalf of Li Shouhao, the abbot and supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, respectfully submits: This abode is the sacred site of the Divine Inspector’s residence, where the emperor is revered in the Benming Shenfu Hall. Each year, during the spring and autumn state *jiao* rituals, the local governor writes the imperial name on the memorial tablets. The decree states: *\"To pray for the well-being of all living beings and dispel calamities.\"*\n\nIn the first year of Xiangfu, it was decreed that imperial incense be bestowed upon the halls of this abbey. However, the abbey has not since petitioned for this privilege. We reflect that the incense offerings in the hall of blessings have been revered by successive sages; the bestowal of imperial incense and the establishment of *jiao* rituals to protect the state and pacify the realm have yielded manifest efficacy. The edicts and documents attesting to this are too numerous to count.\n\nRecently, when the prefectural authorities, concerned by the delayed auspicious snow, performed a *jiao* ritual, the response was immediate: a hundred thousand households were suffused with harmonious *qi*, and five centuries of blessings flowed as foretold. From Xiangfu to Jiaxi, whenever imperial incense was bestowed and *jiao* rituals held, divine responses followed. The throne once bestowed the honorific title *\"Miaohua\"* upon the Perfected Lord and conferred the imperial calligraphy *\"Sanqing Pavilion\"*, along with ordination certificates, aloeswood, camphor, altar consecrations, and silks for the *jiao* rituals to protect the frontiers and pray for an heir. The texts of these decrees remain preserved.\n\nYet, all previous bestowals of incense and *jiao* rituals were initiated by the prefectural authorities. Now, we humbly request that, in accordance with precedent, the prefecture memorialize the throne to revive these ancient rites. The details of the foregoing memorial must be submitted for imperial consideration.\n\nYour servant respectfully notes: The Taiping Xingguo Abbey is the seat of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Inspector, and from the Kaiyuan era of the Tang to the present dynasty, over five hundred years have passed, during which the deity’s responses have been manifold and imperial honors repeatedly bestowed. Since the founding of the dynasty, imperial incense has been granted annually as a regular observance. However, by the Longxing era, this practice fell into neglect.\n\nIn the second and fourth years of Jiaxi, the abbey’s supervisor, Xiong Shouzhong, petitioned, and the throne graciously bestowed the honorific *\"Miaohua\"* upon the Perfected Lord, along with imperial incense. Since then, no one from the abbey has petitioned, nor has the prefecture submitted memorials, thereby contravening the intent of successive dynasties to honor these rites and constituting a grave omission.\n\nRecently, when the auspicious snow was delayed last winter, your servant personally visited the shrine to pray for the people, and the response was immediate, as if echoing our pleas. The triple whiteness heralded a bountiful year. Given such manifest efficacy, it is fitting to report this in accordance with established protocol to glorify the divine favor.\n\nWe humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to issue a decree reviving the ancient rites of the dynasty, granting imperial incense to this abbey each year, and instructing that the *jiao* rituals be conducted in accordance with the directives issued in the gengzi year of Jiaxi. This memorial is respectfully submitted for imperial consideration, awaiting your sagely decree.\n\n**Fourth Year of Baoyou, First Month**\n\n**Imperial Incense Decree**\n\nBy order of the Ministry of Rites, in accordance with the memorial from Li Wenweng, Prefect of Jiangzhou, submitted on the eighth day of the second month of the fourth year of Baoyou, requesting the revival of the dynasty’s ancient rites by granting imperial incense annually to the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou for the performance of *jiao* rituals:\n\nThe matter was subsequently referred to the Ministry of Rites for verification of precedent and submitted to the Secretariat. Upon review, the Secretariat forwarded the matter to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices for thorough examination and clarification before reporting back to the ministry.\n\nThereafter, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices submitted: *\"Regarding the request in the memorial to revive the directives issued in the gengzi year of Jiaxi for the performance of *jiao* rituals, we now propose that the ministry report to the throne, instructing Jiangzhou to implement the directives in accordance with the precedents of the gengzi year of Jiaxi.\"*\n\nThe original memorial was forwarded to the ministry for submission to the throne. Upon review, the judgment was issued: *\"In accordance with the Court of Imperial Sacrifices’ submission, Jiangzhou is to implement the directives as originally decreed and report on their execution, with a copy to the Secretariat for reference.\"*\n\nThe ministry has reported this to the throne for consideration. The prefecture is to act accordingly, implementing the directives as originally decreed. The prefectural authorities have complied and reported back, and the abbey has acted in accordance with the directives.\n\nThereafter, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey submitted a report detailing the dates and precedents of the throne’s bestowals of incense and *jiao* rituals, requesting the prefecture to report to the ministry for verification of past examples and issuance of the appropriate directives:\n\n- **Third Year of Taiping Xingguo**: Spring and autumn *jiao* rituals; ordination certificates.\n- **Third Year of Taiping Xingguo**: Spring and autumn *jiao* rituals; ministry documents; three volumes of vegetarian feast accounts.\n- **Thirty-First Year of Shaoxing**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and prayer tablets.\n- **Second Year of Longxing**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and prayer tablets.\n- **Third Year of Duanping**: Memorial from the Ministry of Rites for *jiao* rituals to pray for harvests and dispel warfare; seven volumes of decrees and texts.\n- **First Year of Jiaxi**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and jade tablets to protect the frontiers and pray for an heir.\n- **Second Year of Jiaxi**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals to dispel warfare; decrees, silver, paper money, silks, and other items in three volumes and four pieces.\n- **First Year of Chunyou**: Bestowal of the honorific title for the Perfected Lord; decrees, prayer tablets, incense, abbey documents, silver, silks, and imperial edicts in four volumes and five pieces.\n\nHaving submitted the foregoing documents to the ministry for verification and issuance, the prefecture affirms their accuracy and humbly requests the issuance of directives for implementation.\n\nAwaiting the imperial directive, it is noted that Li Wenweng of Jiangzhou has submitted a petition requesting the revival of the former dynastic rites, the bestowal of imperial incense, and the performance of a *jiao* ritual at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. Upon review, it is found that in previous reigns, imperial incense, calligraphic scrolls, ordination certificates, and silks were indeed bestowed. Now, in accordance with the petition of Li Shouhao, the abbey’s acting superintendent, and upon verification of the original imperial decree, this prefecture has directly submitted the request as per precedent. On the ninth day of the sixth month, the Three Departments jointly received the imperial edict, ordering that incense be bestowed upon Jiangzhou as before, to be delivered to the abbey for the *jiao* ritual, with the same provisions as those granted in the gengzi year of Jiaxi. The Imperial Pharmacy, the Palace Eunuch Directorate, the Hanlin Academy, and the Jiangzhou abbey are each to act accordingly.\n\nThe above is hereby issued to the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu.\n\nDated this day of the sixth month, the fourth year of Baoyou.\n\nBy imperial decree, Vice-Minister Li of the Bureau of Military Affairs is instructed: On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou shall conduct the state *jiao* ritual. Herewith are bestowed thirty taels of aloeswood, ten catties each of *jian* sandalwood and *jiangzhen* incense, to be used for the ritual offerings. For future prayers, any further bestowals shall be duly recorded and reported.\n\nDated this day of the seventh month, the fourth year of Baoyou.\n\nPrepared by the Eunuch Directorate of the Inner Palace, the Palace Attendant of the Ruidian Hall, the Acting Supervisor of the Dragon Diagram and Celestial Chapters Pavilions, and the Acting Supervisor of the Imperial Treasury and Hanlin Bureau, Mao Cungong.\n\n**Memorial on the Bestowal of Imperial Incense**\n\nYour subject, Li Wenpu, humbly submits: Upon assuming my post in the borderlands, my prayers for divine favor were answered. Mindful of the abbey where the Perfected Lord stores blessings and recalling the longstanding dynastic custom of bestowing imperial incense, I found that the abbey had failed to petition for its renewal, nor had the local authorities taken the initiative to request it. I thus urgently memorialized the throne and was graciously favored with an imperial response. By imperial decree, it is ordered that each year, thirty taels of aloeswood and ten catties each of *jian* sandalwood and *jiangzhen* incense be bestowed upon the Taiping Xingguo Abbey for the autumn *jiao* ritual on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. For future bestowals, these offerings shall serve to pray for the eternal mandate of Heaven, the protection of the state, the pacification of the frontiers, and the universal well-being of all living beings, that all may ascend to benevolence and longevity.\n\nNow, as the sacred precincts are prepared and the vermilion memorials laid forth, I humbly beseech the radiant imperial gaze to witness the sincerity of the Ninefold Palace. May the imperial favor be bestowed anew, upholding the annual rites. Through these meritorious acts, may abundant blessings be secured.\n\nTo His Imperial Majesty:\nMay your grand designs expand boundlessly, and your legacy endure through generations. May the seasons prove fruitful, the people content in their labors; may the Central Kingdom know peace, the four barbarians submit, and the frontiers remain undisturbed by dust.\n\nUpon the initial bestowal of imperial incense for the State-Founding Jiao, a separate memorial in blue-green script was presented:\n\nWe have sought the numinous presence of the Golden Portals, where the earth’s majesty rises at Mount Lu; and the precious fumigations of the expiatory rites, annually dispatched from the imperial court. Yet owing to the provinces’ delayed petitions, the august observances of this sacred era have fallen into neglect.\n\nWith reverence, we recall how Your Imperial Majesty, ever steadfast in devotion, pursues goodness with unflagging diligence; how dew-drenched prayers ascend from the inner palace, where morning and evening rites are observed with scrupulous care; how the sun’s gaze alights upon the central realm, where solicitude for all within and beyond is earnestly expressed. Embracing the reverent hearts of successive dynasties, You have elevated the most wondrous transformations with exalted titles. Thus, in upholding these enduring rituals, we lodge our devotion in the offering of fragrant incense.\n\nMay the Perfected One, who surveys the Nine Heavens, grant that Your luminous scrutiny be justly reflected upon the throne. Yet now, the afflictions of Shu and Guang have deepened, and the wounds of Huai and Xiang fester. Flood and drought alternate, while troops and treasuries grow ever depleted.\n\nThis humble servant, entrusted with office and indebted to sovereign grace, gazes toward the vermilion steps to offer loyalty, and toward the Crimson Mound to beseech blessings. We humbly pray that the Emperor’s person enjoy longevity and joy, that the foundation of the state remain secure and strong; that the four seasons’ qi harmonize, bringing abundant harvests of grain; that the three frontiers stand firm, forever free from the peril of beacon fires; and that all the realm’s subjects equally partake in the Dao’s responsive grace.\n\n---\n\n**Respectfully Receiving the Court’s Bestowal of Funds for the Universal Salvation Jiao: A Secret Edict**\n\nRespectfully receiving the imperial decree: Since the warfare of last year, many loyal and valiant men have died in battle, and countless displaced souls have perished in untimely deaths. These orphaned spirits, without refuge, truly evoke our deepest concern. A Universal Salvation Jiao shall be conducted to enable their transcendence.\n\nIn Sichuan, the rites shall be held at Chongqing; in the Two Guangs, at Mount Heng; and in Jiangnan and Jiangxi, at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou. At each of these three sites, a Jiao of 1,200 offerings shall be performed. For each location, the following shall be bestowed: 100 taels of aloeswood, 10 taels of borneol, 300 catties of *jiangzhen* incense, 100 catties of yellow wax, and 100,000 strings of official currency. Designated personnel and soldiers shall be dispatched to oversee the delivery, ensuring strict accountability and meticulous preparation. The rites shall commence within the eighth month, spanning three days and nights.\n\nDecrees have been issued to the Sichuan Military Commission, the Guangdong Pacification and Defense Commission, the Guangxi Pacification and Defense Commission, the Hunan Pacification Commission, and the Jing-Hu Military Commission.\n\n*Fifth year of Jingding, sixth month.*\n\n---\n\nFormerly, the Tartar barbarians, devoid of the Dao, advanced insatiably. Yet relying on our people’s readiness for war, we prevailed in every battle. Some wielded shields and spears in defense, others seized poisoned bows to scale the heights. Never did they face the enemy with thoughts of survival; all sought to annihilate them before taking sustenance. Their loyalty was spent to the utmost, viewing death as a return home. The killing energy pierced the heavens, reeking of carnage, while their heroic souls, though cast upon the dew, grew only more resolute.\n\nYet we grieve that their forms have perished, and their sacrifice remains etched in our hearts. Therefore, on the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou, a Great Universal Salvation Jiao of 1,200 offerings shall be conducted, invoking the power of the Dao to enable their transcendence.\n\n**Blue-Green Memorial:**\n\nThrough a hundred battles, they met peril with their lives...\n\nThe fervor of their loyalty burned so fiercely that though dead, they yet live. Only the brave, who never forgot the loss of their heads, could strike such terror into the enemy’s qi. We recall the profound evil of the barbarian scourge, which brought such hardship to the nation’s steps. Unwavering in heart, how could they dwell under the same sky as such foes? They exerted every effort, for only in true peril could survival be found. Weightier than life was their righteous cause; though bound by the same service, their fates diverged in an instant. Such grief wells up, piercing the depths of our hearts. The words of their sword-bearing farewells remain fresh—how could we forget the fields of Chu? The sorrow of their repeated vows is beyond recall, leaving only empty lament for Linlou.\n\nIn reverence, we perform the rites of deliverance, seeking to express the extremity of our sorrow. We humbly beseech Your boundless compassion to lift them from the desolate path. Their unyielding valor, though tested, shall endure in the annals of heaven; their heroic souls, though departed, may yet serve in the winds and thunder.\n\n**Memorial by Shi Dazi, Requesting the Conferral of Honors and a Sacred Register**\n\nAt the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in this prefecture, we revere the incense and flame of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, and Wondrous Transformer, the Perfected Lord. According to records and gazetteers, during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, Emperor Minghuang, moved by a dream, was instructed by the Perfected Spirit to establish a shrine on Mount Lu. Five hundred years later, blessings would extend to all living beings. Thus, the Nine Heavens’ Envoy Temple was built in Jiangzhou. The sagely emperors of our dynasty have held this deity in the highest esteem: Taizong bestowed a new plaque upon the abbey; Shenzong elevated the title to *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Perfected Lord*; Huizong presented a jade register, transforming the abbey into a palace. The emperors Gaozong and Xiaozong frequently dispatched officials to offer prayers for border security and the repulsion of warfare. Since His Majesty’s ascension, he has bestowed calligraphic works and imperial incense, honoring the deity with even greater reverence.\n\nLast autumn, when I was stationed here, the barbarian horses stealthily crossed the border. I received an edict to advance with the Yellow Banner to reinforce Hubei. Upon receiving the command, I set forth at once. Yet my authority in Fujian was inherently weak, and Jiangzhou, deemed an interior region, faced the enemy without generals or troops. To retreat and defend the central river would mean a city with low walls and shallow moats; to dispatch naval forces to Hubei would be thwarted by contrary winds; to reinforce Huangzhou with reinforcements would invite swift disaster. The people were restless, the soldiers’ morale low. The fate of the ancestral altars hung in the balance, and success was uncertain. Thus, I beseeched the Perfected Shrine to conduct a Great Universal Salvation Jiao of 3,600 offerings, praying for the nation’s protection and the repulsion of war. Thereupon, the winds shifted, and reinforcements arrived without incident. The deity’s manifest power demands our gratitude and repayment.\n\nI personally visited the abbey to fulfill the vow. Perusing the steles, I learned that the Perfected Spirit is also titled the Supreme Emperor of the Vermilion Mound, Inspector of the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, who determines the destinies, fortunes, and misfortunes of heaven and humanity. His dignity rivals that of the Heavenly Emperor. He governs the Nine Palaces, the Nine Provinces, and the celestial divisions of the Nine Stars. The cycles of 108 years are tied to the world’s fortunes, influencing its rise and fall—and our dynasty has received abundant blessings. When the rebel Zhang Yu of the Jianyan era attacked Jiangzhou, the city’s soldiers and civilians witnessed the Perfected Lord’s true form manifest in the clouds, assuming the shape of a dragon-horse. The rebels were swiftly annihilated. During the Kaixi era, when Wu Xi rebelled in Shu, General Jiang Jie of Kuizhou received a divine visitation, declaring that the Inspector had petitioned the Heavenly Emperor, and the rebels would face extermination. Now, as the reckless barbarians defy righteousness, we rely on unseen aid: the river’s surface is once more calm, and the southeast rests secure.\n\nToday marks the year *xinwei* of the Kaiyuan era, precisely five hundred years later, and the deity’s numinous efficacy shines as brightly as ever. Yet I humbly reflect: when the Divine Emperor Shenzong bestowed the title *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune*, it was by imperial edict. Later, Emperor Huizong, honoring his predecessor’s intent, inscribed it upon a jade register. All subsequent sagely emperors prefaced their blue-green memorials with “Your Majesty’s servant so-and-so.” During the Jiaxi era, the title was augmented with the characters *Wondrous Transformer*, but the Ministry of Rites, in a moment of oversight, issued only a decree of investiture, deviating from the precedents of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe eras. This may not fully reflect the enlightened age’s reverence for the sacred.\n\nI have appended copies of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe imperial edicts and registers for reference. I respectfully petition the court to submit this matter for deliberation by the relevant authorities, to add an eight-character honorific above the current title *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, to confer a sacred register, to inscribe it upon fine jade, to revoke the original decree, and to deposit it in the Ministry of Rites’ archives. This would not only dispel the scourge of war and inaugurate an era of prosperity, securing the nation’s destiny for eternity and extending the emperor’s longevity without end, but also ensure that the sagely emperors’ venerable rites remain unbroken—a boon beyond measure for the ancestral altars and all living beings.\n\nOn the __ day of the fifth month of the first year of Jingding (1260), Vice Minister Lu respectfully submits a second memorial petitioning for the conferral of an imperial investiture register.\n\nYour servant Jing Si has ascertained that the *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer* of the Nine Heavens’ Inspection Bureau at Taiping Xingguo Abbey in this prefecture—when examined against historical records—first manifested numinous signs in a dream during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, with a prophecy that its blessings would extend to all living beings five hundred years hence. When cross-referenced with stele inscriptions, it bears the title *Vermilion Numinous Supreme Emperor*, charged with inspecting the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, governing the Nine Palaces, Nine Provinces, and the celestial divisions, as well as the cycles of yang’s ninefold and hundred-sixfold reckonings. According to ritual canons, since the Taizong Emperor bestowed the present abbey’s name, the Shenzong Emperor issued a decree advancing its title to *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune*, and the Huizong Emperor presented a jade register, elevating the abbey to a palace. The Gaozong and Xiaozong courts both dispatched officials to offer prayers for frontier affairs. Since Your Majesty’s ascension, the honorific *Wondrous Transformer* has been added, an imperial inscription from the Three Clarities Pavilion bestowed, incense offerings made, and jiao rites conducted with vermilion memorials and blue-green prayers. The reverence accorded it stems from its most exalted and substantiated efficacy.\n\nDuring the Jianyan era, when Zhang Yu besieged the city, the deity manifested clouds to annihilate the rebels. In the Kaixi reign, when Wu Xi rebelled in Shu, a descending brush executed the traitor. This year, when northern raiders entered the borders of Ruichang County in this prefecture, they were as if restrained and could not advance. Its unseen protection of the region has preserved countless lives. Moreover, like timely sweet rains and seasonable snows, it dispels epidemics, relieves famine, safeguards the frontiers, averts warfare, shields the state, and succors the people—its blessings are most abundant.\n\nYour servant Jing reflects that now, as the great fortune turns anew and august rites are fully revived, even minor deities receive universal veneration. How much more should the highest spirits be exalted, that the *Inspecting Perfected* may extend their blessings to the farthest reaches of the realm? From the Xinwei year of Kaiyuan (711) to the present, the five-hundred-year cycle has come full circle. Though the transformations of fortune bear no name, how could the deity’s manifest or hidden responses differ in the completeness of its titles and registers?\n\nThe two previous courts’ decrees and registers accorded it the rites due a celestial spirit; the successive sagely emperors’ memorials prefaced its name with “Your Majesty’s servant.” In the Jiaxi reign, though an honorific was added, the Ministry of Rites failed to verify precedents, merely issuing a decree by edict, which fell short of former standards. Since imperial incense has been bestowed and state jiao rites solemnly conducted each spring and autumn, when the military commissioner presents prayers, the response has been insufficient to fulfill the people’s devotion.\n\nIt is humbly hoped that Your Sagely Compassion will command the Ministry of State Affairs to add an eight-character honorific above the current title *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, and to consult the memorial submitted by former prefect, Academician Shi Yan, which appended copies of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe imperial edicts and registers. Let the relevant authorities examine ritual precedents, confer a sacred register, inscribe it upon fine jade, so as to fulfill the successive courts’ reverent devotion and approach the Nine Heavens’ august bestowal of grace.\n\nThis matter requires Your Majesty’s attention.\n\nRespectfully submitted on the __ day of the ninth month of the first year of Jingding (1260).\n\n**Memorial on the Petition for the Conferral of an Augmented Honorific Title**\n\nWhen Acting Prefect Yin Leirui was temporarily assigned to this post, he conducted sacrifices to the mountains and rivers within the prefecture’s bounds. Searching the ritual canons and consulting the elders, he learned that the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence*, who appeared in a dream to the Radiant Emperor, established a shrine in this land—upright and unified, bestowing blessings upon the people below. For five hundred years, his presence has endured: in the Shaoxing era, clouds manifested and Zhang Yu was extinguished; in the Kaixi era, a divine brush descended and Hao Xi was executed. When barbarian scouts filled the riverbanks and the prefecture clung to its isolated walls in desperate defense, the enemy, upon nearing the borders, fled in panic and disarray. These are recent and undeniable proofs of his efficacy.\n\nUpon examination, we find that successive sagely emperors of our dynasty have bestowed the highest honors with utmost sincerity. Though the god’s beneficence endures to this day, his title remains unchanged from old—perhaps this is not in accord with ritual propriety. Former prefects, Academician Shi and Academician Lu, both previously memorialized, petitioning for the conferral of an honorific to accord with the people’s wishes, yet no imperial response was received.\n\nNow, as the era of Great Fortune unfolds and the earth mirrors the heavens, the hundred spirits receive their mandates, and their divine merits shine forth—how can their exaltation be delayed? It is hoped that the court will review and deliberate upon this matter.\n\n**Fifth day of the fifth month, second year of Jingding (1261)**\n*Memorandum from the Jiangzhou Provincial Surveillance Commission*\n*To the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangxi and Prefect of Jiangzhou:*\n\nOn the fifth day of this month, we received a dispatch from the Ministry of Rites at the imperial court, transmitting a document dated the fourth day of the eighth month of the second year of Jingding, approved by the Secretariat and forwarded from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. The document cites a memorial from Yin Leirui, newly appointed Gentleman for Thorough Service and concurrently Academician of the Hall of Illustrious Strategy, now Prefect of Jiangzhou.\n\nUpon arriving in the prefecture, I found the local gentry and commoners united in petition, declaring that in the previous year, when the Tartar bandits secretly crossed the river and infiltrated Jiangxi, the entire prefecture was preserved in peace—all due to the blessings of the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, whose shrine on Mount Lu bestows grace. They beseech that this be made known and that his honorific title be augmented. Furthermore, former officials, Grand Academician Shi and Academician Lu, had previously memorialized the throne; their original petitions are hereby resubmitted. It is hoped that the court will review these repeated appeals and deign to add two characters to the existing six-character title, while also consulting the ritual precedents of the Zhenghe era and conferring a jade register.\n\nThis matter has been forwarded for judgment. The Court of Imperial Sacrifices, upon investigation, notes that in the sixth month of the first year of Jingding, it received a memorial from Jiangzhou, petitioning for the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, enshrined at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou, to have an eight-character honorific appended to his title. In that same month, this court proposed the title *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer, Assistant in Upholding Rightness*, to be honored with a jade register, in accordance with the previously issued imperial decree. The matter was duly memorialized to the Secretariat in the sixth month of that year. We now respectfully submit this to the Ministry of State Affairs, humbly requesting that the court issue instructions in accordance with the aforementioned memorial for implementation in this prefecture.\n\nThe matter was subsequently endorsed and forwarded to the Ministry of Rites, which issued orders to this prefecture for compliance. Accordingly, this directive is hereby transmitted to the prefecture. You are to carefully review the contents of this document and act in accordance with the instructions therein. The approved directives are to be presented to the prefectural authorities for deliberation. It is proposed that a notice be issued to the Taiping Abbey, and a copy be forwarded to the Surveillance Commission for record, to ensure proper execution.\n\n**Eighteenth day of the eleventh month, second year of Jingding (1261)**\n*Decree on the Conferral of an Augmented Honorific*\n\nThe essence of the Supreme Dao is profound and obscure, transcending all things and moving amidst the Nine Heavens. Its name and rank are exalted, its transformative power wondrous—it is simply called the True One. The Nine Heavens’ Investigator of Primordial Qi, Guardian of Fortune, and Wondrous Transformer of Jiangzhou’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey roams in serene harmony with the Creator and transforms in concert with yin and yang. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all arise from the principle of silent resonance and response. When Heaven’s wrath fell upon the lawless foe, it was the True One who aided the royal army in purifying the Jiang’s surface.\n\nThough named \"Investigator,\" as if some entity presided over its domain, the True One is not bound by things, yet nothing can escape its influence. The conferral of its rank reaches the pinnacle, and its title spans eight characters—its honor is supreme. It is hereby specially enfeoffed as the Nine Heavens’ Investigator of Primordial Qi, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer, and Assistant of Righteousness, True Lord.\n\nThis prefecture, in reverent observance of the enfeoffment decree, holds a jiao offering to celebrate the imperial intent.\n\nIn the year *jiwei* (1259), warhorses invaded the Jiang. Through the subtle efficacy of the Investigator’s power, the royal army secured victory. The barbarians were swept away, and the land was pacified. Rightly does such hidden merit warrant solemn recompense. Thus, the True Lord’s title is augmented by eight characters, bestowing blessings upon the Nine Rivers. The phoenix-edict is grandly proclaimed, and the jade palace takes on a new splendor.\n\nI, unworthy as I am, serve as this region’s governor and have personally received the imperial grace, fortunate to rely upon the blessings of the Assistant of Righteousness. Therefore, I humbly perform the rites of reverence, praying for the eternal flourishing of the state and the enduring protection of the realm.\n\n**Jiao Offering Prayer:**\nO radiant and mighty spirit, who aided the royal army’s righteous cause—\nWith solemn proclamation, we manifest the splendor of the state’s rites.\nThough the True One’s transcendence requires no praise,\nThe court must duly honor its debt of gratitude.\n\nLooking back to those years of peril, when strife first arose—\nThe Jiang and Han rivers surged, startling the Tartar steeds as they forded;\nThe borders, once desolate, at last revived, like fish escaping a dried cauldron.\nThrough its subtle aid, the army’s might was strengthened, and the people’s lives preserved.\nThus, the eight-character title was bestowed, answering the grand favor of the Nine Heavens.\nMay it share the state’s prosperity, dispelling demonic vapors from the frontier;\nMay it, in its boundless benevolence, enhance the auspicious radiance of mountains and rivers.\n\n*Record of the Facts Concerning the Investigator True Lord of Lushan’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey, Scroll Three* (Concluded)\n*(Note: \"透\" originally written as \"偷,\" emended per later text *Jiangzhou Beizuo Shengge*; \"致\" originally written as \"至,\" emended per context; \"干\" originally written as \"于,\" emended per context.)*\n\n*Record of the Facts Concerning the Investigator True Lord of Lushan’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey, Scroll Four: Yuan Dynasty Veneration*\n\nBy the Imperial Edict of the Emperor, under the power of the Eternal Heaven and the great fortune of the protective spirits:\n\nAn Imperial Edict to the *darughachi* officials, traveling envoys, military commanders, soldiers, masters of all teachings, and the common people in cities and villages:\n\nThe edicts of Genghis Khan and Qa’an the Emperor decree: Daoist monks, Christians (*Yelikewen*), masters (*xiansheng*), and Muslim clerics (*dashman*) shall be exempt from all corvée and taxes, that they may pray to Heaven and invoke blessings for Us. As before, let this be observed.\n\nThus, in accordance with the teachings of the Most High Lord Lao, Daoist monks, Christians, masters, and Muslim clerics shall remain free from all corvée and taxes, that they may pray to Heaven and invoke blessings for Us. By this decree, the Imperial Edict is hereby conferred upon Zhang the Heavenly Master, Abbot of the Supreme Clarity Orthodox Unity Abbey at Dragon-Tiger Mountain in Xinzhou. Furthermore, the Heavenly Master’s own household, the Yanshuaiguan, shall serve as the principal site for ritual practice.\n\nIn all abbeys and monasteries, envoys shall not be quartered. No one, regardless of status, may forcibly occupy them by force, adjudicate official matters within them, store grain, impose any levies, or demand post-horses and requisitions. No commercial taxes shall be collected. All lands, waters, bamboo groves, mills, boats, gardens, pawnshops, warehouses, bathhouses, inns, and breweries belonging to the abbeys shall be exempt from all corvée and taxes. Let no one evade this by citing other edicts.\n\nFrom all categories of appanage holders, nothing shall be exacted from the masters, nor shall the masters yield to such demands. Furthermore, in all official matters, the masters shall adhere to the words of Zhang the Heavenly Master and the teachings of the Most High Lord Lao, acting in accordance with principle without deviation. They shall not adjudicate disputes among the laity.\n\nIf disputes arise between masters and the laity, the appointed leaders of the masters and the city officials shall jointly investigate and resolve them. Should any master violate the established norms—engaging in fraud, theft, or other misconduct—they shall be handed over to the *darughachi* officials of the city for disposition.\n\nThis Imperial Edict, held by Zhang the Heavenly Master, must be obeyed. Let no improper official matters be conducted. If any are, they shall be reported to Us. We shall recognize the truth of it.\n\nIssued on the tenth day of the second month in the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for the Sacred Festival Ritual**\n\nThe *Darughachi* and Pacification Bureau of Jiangzhou Prefecture, together with the local Supervisor of Daoist Registries, respectfully submit:\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of this month, in observance of the Sacred Festival of the Emperor’s Longevity, we humbly commission officials to conduct a grand Golden Register Ritual at the blessed site of Taiping Xingguo Abbey. Preparations shall commence on the twenty-sixth day with the recitation of sacred scriptures, the establishment of the fasting altar, and the display of talismanic clouds. On the twenty-seventh day, morning, noon, and evening audiences shall be held, with rites of repentance and memorials presented. At dawn on the twenty-eighth day, the ritual banquet shall be prepared, and the Supreme Emperor of the Dao invoked, that the full offerings may be dispersed.\n\nWe reverently pray that His Imperial Majesty’s sacred longevity be boundless, the imperial domain secure, the people prosperous, all things abundant, and the seas and rivers tranquil.\n\n*Green Memorial*\n\nHeaven, in its gracious mandate, has bestowed a divine and martial countenance; the Southern Culmen has manifested its auspicious signs, and the propitious dawn of the imperial birthday swiftly arrives. With reverence, we approach the gates of the jade palace and devoutly follow the rites of the sacred peak. We pray that the sagely longevity be extended boundlessly, coeval with Heaven, and that the jasper chart be upheld forever, ever ascending like the sun.\n\n*Memorial for the Shangyuan Ritual*\nThe Darughachi Administration and the Daoist Registry Office of Jiangzhou Circuit, on the occasion of the Shangyuan Festival—the day when the Celestial Official bestows blessings—humbly conduct at the blessed site of Taiping Xingguo Abbey, within the Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Investigating Perfected Lord, a sacred Lingbao Qingjiao Ritual. We recite the true scriptures, establish the fasting altar, display talismanic clouds, hold audiences at the three periods of the day, and present rites of repentance with memorials. One hundred and twenty portions of the ritual banquet shall be prepared and dispersed, that the accumulated extraordinary merits may ascend to offer prayers for His Imperial Majesty. We reverently wish that the sacred longevity be boundless, the imperial domain secure, the people prosperous, and all things abundant; that calamities of pestilence be forever dispelled; that the seasons be harmonious and the years bountiful, and that all rejoice in the governance of Great Peace.\n\n*Green Memorial*\nAs the year’s cycle begins anew, we solemnly observe the day of audience with the Primordial; with the Sage on high, we devoutly perform the rites of longevity. The palace halls are cleansed by gentle winds, and incense, lamps, and dew offerings ascend. We draw near to the Perfected in the azure vault and gaze upon the celestial signs in the Pure Capital. Through sincere offering, may abundant blessings be conferred upon His Imperial Majesty. We reverently pray that the imperial domain be as vast as Heaven, that he rule the myriad states with awe; that sagely reverence daily ascend, and that his mandate extend over the nine regions. May prosperity and abundance be fully attained, and all rejoice in Great Peace.\n\n*Memorial for the Incense-Offering Ritual*\nThe Taiping Xingguo Abbey of Jiangzhou Circuit, by imperial commission, receives the specially dispatched envoy Yaonan, together with the Imperial Preceptor of the Mysterious Teaching, Grand Director of Daoism for the Two Huai, Jing, and Xiang Circuits, and General Director of Daoism for the Jiangnan Circuits, Zhang Liusun. Bearing the sacred edict and holding the imperial incense, they proceed to the Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Investigating Perfected Lord to kindle the incense burner and open the blessed court. In humble obedience, this abbey respectfully conducts on the twenty-seventh day of this month a Qingjiao Ritual of Thanksgiving. The accumulated extraordinary merits are offered in prayer for His Imperial Majesty, that his sacred longevity be boundless, the imperial domain secure, the people prosperous, and all things abundant, and that the seas and rivers be tranquil.\n\n*Memorial for the Ritual Conducted by the Imperial Preceptor*\nThe Imperial Preceptor of the Mysterious Teaching, Grand Director of Daoism for the Two Huai, Jing, and Xiang Circuits, and General Director of Daoism for the Jiangnan Circuits, Zhang Liusun, together with the imperial envoy Yaonan, reverently receive the august decree of the Empress and the edict of the Crown Prince. They descend with imperial incense to the Hall of the Investigating Perfected Lord at Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, where it is offered in sacrifice. This is specially for the prayer that the sacred longevity of the Emperor be eternally secure, and secondarily that the empress and crown prince be blessed with auspicious harmony, that the myriad people enjoy their livelihoods, and that the four seas share a common wind.\n\n*Edict of the Fifth Year of Yanyou, Bestowing an Honorific Title upon the Perfected Lord*\nBy Heaven’s gracious mandate, the sacred edict of the Emperor: We have heard that Heaven and Earth, coeval with its creation, wondrously unite in the work of generation; mountains and rivers bear its divine qi and truly hold the office of surveillance and governance. Thus, consulting the eternal statutes, We bestow an honorific title. The Nine Heavens’ Investigating Envoy of Taiping Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou Circuit, the Perfected Lord Who Assists the Dao and Upholds the Mandate, Whose Marvelous Transformations Aid Compliance—his Dao transcends the vastness, and his merits encompass all. He governs the myriad spirits, revealing the subtle and illuminating the obscure; he patrols the Three Realms, manifesting blessings for the good and calamities for the licentious.\n\nHolding the tally in place of the Vast Azure, embodying the transformations of the August Void, he first appeared in a dream during the Tang dynasty and naturally made his numinous abode upon Mount Kuang. Since he inaugurated the auspicious omen of the tripod’s destiny to protect the state, it is fitting to amplify his honorific title and proclaim the imperial favor in the court.\n\nAh! Striding across the Nine Empyreans and spanning the Eight Extremities, his wondrous efficacy knows no bounds; gathering the Five Fortunes and bestowing them upon the common people, he safeguards the Great Harmony forever.\n\nLet the title of Nine Heavens’ Investigating Envoy, the Perfected Lord Who Responds to the Origin, Preserves the Mandate, Enacts Wondrous Transformations, Assists Compliance, and Embodies Supreme Virtue, Benevolence, and Sanctity be specially conferred.\n\nLet the responsible officials implement this.\n\nFifth day of the fifth month, fifth year of the Yanyou era.\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the Veritable Records of the Investigating Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey*\n\n---\n\n*Scroll Five of the Veritable Records of the Investigating Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey*\n*Category: Encounters with Immortals*\n\n**Master Kang Meets Liu Yue**\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, Master Kang and his six brothers cultivated true qi upon Mount Lu, delighting in reclusion among the forests and springs. One day, a youth dressed in flowing robes and a *zhangfu* cap came to visit. His discourse was refined, and he delighted in discussing antiquity, the present age, and the learning of immortals. Master Kang found him extraordinary and treated him with increasing warmth. Thus passed several years, yet his name remained unknown. After prolonged association, Master Kang remarked, “I have long been familiar with your noble bearing, yet dare not inquire your name, nor do I know your dwelling.”\n\nThe youth replied, “I am Liu Yue, residing to the left of this mountain. If you do not disdain my humble abode, I hope you will visit.” He added, “At the mountain’s base lies a stone about three feet high; knock upon it, and we shall meet.”\n\nMaster Kang followed his instructions and, arriving at the mountain’s base, saw the stone. Upon knocking, it suddenly opened, revealing double doors to a grotto. A young servant welcomed him, and after ten-odd steps, two azure-clad attendants bearing crimson staffs led the way. Gradually, pavilions and terraces came into view, their gold and jade hues intermingling, while rare birds and strange beasts, exotic flowers and trees, filled the scene. A Perfected One, crowned with a jade diadem and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, came forth to greet him.\n\nMaster Kang, realizing this was no mortal realm, wished to take up residence. The Perfected One, divining his intent, said, “Your hidden merits are not yet complete; a future meeting may be expected. One day, you shall follow me to the Turtle Palace of Penglai or the Crimson Towers of Red City—it will not be late.” They drank three cups of jade wine and a sip of the Elixir of Longevity before he departed. Turning back, the great stone appeared as before.\n\nOn another day, he knocked again, but there was no response. A pavilion was later built upon the stone, named “Immortal Stone.” The characters “Liu the Immortal” naturally appeared upon it, and the remains of the abbey’s triple gate may still be seen today.\n\n*From the* Record of Liu’s Immortal Stone.\n\n**Zhang Yunsou’s** *Southern Exile Record* **states:**\nThere was a Master Kang of the Zhou who built his hut upon this mountain, hence the name “Kang’s Hut.” Located thirty *li* south of the prefecture, one passes Sweet Pear Lake and follows the banks of the Mi River for about ten *li*, ascending and descending. A mountain stream flows north, emerging from the Qianxi Academy. After several more *li*, one reaches New Bridge, where forests flank both sides, the sound of water delightfully clear, and the peaks rise steeply. Crossing Snake Ridge, one arrives at Taiping Xingguo Abbey, the former temple of the Tang dynasty’s Nine Heavens’ Investigating Envoy. During the Xining era, the Perfected Lord Who Responds to the Origin and Preserves the Mandate was enfeoffed, and the temple was expanded into an abbey. Its scale is grand, stretching across valleys and streams, with kitchens, refectories, and blessings flowing in a circuit of water. The hall bears the imperial calligraphy of Emperor Yuan Zong, lacquered plaques, and ink inscriptions. There is also a life-sized bronze statue of the imperial visage, bestowed by the imperial brother Feng, with a hall plaque in gold characters and a vermilion inscription. The golden doors are sealed, and it is seldom seen. Additionally, three sets of golden-painted immortal robes were bestowed. Outside the hall, at the base of the steps, stands a stone called “Liu’s Immortal Stone,” where Master Kang knocked to keep his appointment with Liu the Immortal.\n\n**Hu Chongzhen Meets Lü Dongbin**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Hu Yongzong, styled Chongzhenzi, renounced the world in his youth and devoted himself to cultivation. During the Xining era, a Daoist in tattered robes and worn shoes, who called himself Hui, abruptly entered the treasury hall as if no one were present. Other Daoists ignored him, but Hu alone bowed and seated him in a small chamber, treating him with courteous regard, astonished by his transcendent demeanor. After requesting wine and drinking twice, Hui invited Hu to drink at an inn, but Hu declined due to the lateness of the hour. Hui stroked his beard, laughed, and departed.\n\nThe next morning, Hu entered the city to pay respects to the prefect. Arriving at the gate before it opened, he saw the Daoist emerging from the city, smiling as he looked back. The gatekeepers remarked, “Before the third watch, a Daoist named Hui waited here for the gate to open—we know not who he is.” Hu found this strange.\n\nYears later, a man with a hempen belt and two gourds, calling himself “Guest of the Great Song,” visited Hu at the abbey. Their conversation was refined. Hu asked, “What are these gourds for?” He replied, “My luggage.” Upon pouring them out, they contained gold and silver. He asked if Hu desired them, but Hu answered that he wished only for the Way of longevity. The guest took out fragments of silver to buy wine, and as they drank, he orally transmitted the supreme Dao.\n\nAt dusk, he cut into the earth with a knife, poured wine to rinse his mouth, mixed the spittle with soil, and exhaled upon it to form ink. Tossing it onto the table, it rang with a metallic sound. He told Hu, “Consuming this will cure illness and lead to immortality.” After drinking again, Hu became drunk and collapsed. When he awoke, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and where the earth had been cut, a spring welled forth. The guest had vanished.\n\nHu ground the ink into wine and drank it, and his chronic ailments were instantly cured. Though over seventy, his appearance was like a maiden’s, and his capacity for wine remained unchanged. Gradually, he grew weary of the mortal world. One day, he left a poem, shed his form, and departed.\n\nToday, the abbey’s “Ink Immortal Spring” may be cupped and drunk; its taste is sweet, and it never runs dry in winter or summer. Minister Wang of the Left, Song, and Vice Minister Song, Boyou, along with other renowned scholars, all composed matching verses and left inscriptions, recorded in the *Collected Poems of the Abbey’s Eminent Worthies*.\n\nThe *Account of Hu’s Encounter with Immortals* is excerpted from the *Old Records of the Abbey* and its stele inscriptions.\n\n**Qi Wuzhi’s Transcendence in Meditation**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Qi Wuzhi would, each morning after completing his audience with the Perfected, shut his door and sit in meditation, disengaged from worldly affairs. He recited the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of All*, entering profound stillness to grasp its essence. During the Chongning era, he suddenly drank water without cease for days, then said to his fellow Daoist Lü Shizhong: “The mortal world is not worth clinging to—I shall soon depart.” Lü took it as a jest. At midnight, Qi sat cross-legged, raised his hand toward the candle, and said: “Let this serve as witness. Yet this matter is arduous indeed.” Lü remained uncomprehending and went to sleep soundly. When he awoke, Qi had already passed away in meditation.\n\nExcerpted from the *Old Records of the Abbey*.\n\n**Bi Yangsu’s Encounter with a Mysterious Figure**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Bi Daoning, styled Kangshu, was precocious from childhood, his appearance refined and striking. He could recite any classic or scripture after a single reading. During the Shaosheng era, while traveling through Jiangsu and Zhejiang, he arrived at Mount Qian and met a fangshi of imposing bearing who refused to disclose his name. They roamed the mountains together. Bi sensed his extraordinary nature and wished to become his disciple. The fangshi silently understood his intent and said: “In cultivating the Dao, refining the spirit and nurturing qi is paramount; alchemical texts are but stepping stones to enter the Way. If you sever worldly distractions and refine your spirit and qi with precision, you will naturally commune with the Perfected and attain numinous insight.” He then stood by a stream, pointed at the water, and told Bi: “When water is still, its form is straight; when the mind is tranquil, the spirit is at peace. You must take this as your mirror.” He then bestowed upon Bi an elixir, saying: “One day, we shall meet again at the foot of Shengzhi Peak.” With a bow, he departed, vanishing without a trace. Bi returned to the mountain that very day and, by chance, found the position of vice-abbot vacant. The prefectural authorities appointed him to fill the post.\n\nNot long after, Bi sought leisure to construct a Daoist abbey to the right of the monastery, where he excavated a pond to store water, naming it \"Pure Reflection.\" Each day, he shut his door to preserve spirit, reciting one fascicle of the *Scripture of Salvation*. On the third day of the first month in the year Yisi of the Xuanhe reign, a mountain recluse clad in armor came to visit and reminisce. He bestowed upon Bi a *Qin Garden Spring* lyric, which read:\n\nA grain of golden elixir,\nlarge as a millet seed,\ndescends in stillness to gestate,\ngoverning the root of yin and yang.\nBind the dragon and tiger to the west,\ncongeal the golden water,\nchoose the ground with utmost care.\nNine years without flaw,\nthe Three Fields’ work complete,\nthe hexagram’s qi cycles full,\nthe furnace and cauldron open.\nStealing the primal transformation,\nrelying on the natural ancestral source,\nall lies within the numinous terrace.\n\nTrue talent, do not cling to the dust;\nhow much more, if keen insight pierces emptiness,\nyet the infant remains unborn?\nFortunate our meeting by the Huai’s banks—\nthe numinous elixir entrusted,\nthe profound decree personally left,\nhoping to ascend the immortal’s steps.\nWhen shall we meet again?\nA lofty gathering of water and clouds,\nfurther up the misty paths of the sky?\nIn this world of men,\nlet kings and lords, noble and eminent,\nall return to the wilds and weeds.\n\nFour days after receiving this lyric, Bi straightened his robes, sat upright, and passed away. To this day, the Abbey’s *Hall of Nurturing Simplicity* retains a pavilion to the right, its plaque inscribed *Pure Reflection*, where the pond still remains. Recorded from the *Old Annals of This Abbey*, engraved on stele by Wang Sanyi, Master of Golden Flower Grotto.\n\nThe Daoist of this abbey, Wang Bingwen, styled Yanheng, journeyed to the capital after attaining the Dao. At that time, the imperial court was constructing the Divine Empyrean Longevity Abbey and bestowed upon him a purple robe, appointing him as Master of Ceremonies. Suddenly, a fangshi arrived for a visit and, seeing a copy of the *Zhouyi* on his desk, cast divinations, saying: \"This place shall face military calamity. You are not among those fated for it—best to avoid it.\" Thereupon, he imparted the essentials of *storing the Three and guarding the One*, along with the secrets of the Yellow Emperor and Bian Que. Wang then resigned his post and returned to the mountains.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Jianyan era, this abbey was destroyed by rebel troops. The following year, after the bandits retreated, none took responsibility for its restoration. Wang thus assumed the vice-abbot’s duties and, amid the ashes, oversaw its reconstruction for several years. The halls were adorned in gold and azure, gleaming anew. He then resigned from abbey affairs and secluded himself at home for over thirty years. His residence was named the *Hall of the Three Ones*, and he styled himself *Master of the Three Ones*. Daily, he studied the Daoist canon, delved into esoteric secrets, and devoted himself to medicine, harboring no other passions.\n\nOn the night of the Lantern Festival in the bingxu year of the Qiandao era, he dreamed of a divine messenger who declared: \"The Supreme Emperor commands you to preside over the Great Cleansing Grotto of Golden Flower. He bestows upon you a *returning-soul elixir* to restore your spirit and replenish your primordial qi. You shall be escorted into the grotto by divine radiance, a white steed, and all the officials of the celestial bureaus.\" With these words, he awoke.\n\nThe next morning, he told his disciples: \"The mortal world is no longer fit to dwell in—I shall depart.\" He then entrusted his works—fourteen fascicles of the *Collected Manifestations of Sagely Rule*, the *Divine Resolutions of the Perfected Lord of West Mountain* (the very divinations now consulted in the Inquiry Hall, renowned for their extraordinary efficacy), the *Pulse Secrets of Perfect Wholeness*, and the *Purple Court Secrets of the Morning Star*—to his dharma-heirs, Qin Zhixiang and others.\n\nOn the first day of the second month, after burning incense and changing into fresh robes, he passed away in serene composure. The prefect of this prefecture, Tang Fuwen (styled Wenruo), composed a eulogy in his honor:\n\n*\"I have heard that true persons sleep without dreams.\nThose who dream are suspect of false transmission.\nYet to dismiss dreams as mere delusion may not be so—\nfor in dreams, one may be charged to find a worthy minister,\nor awaken to the strains of celestial music in the Emperor’s presence.\nHuman life is like a dream—truly, it defies words.\nWithin dreams, there are yet deeper dreams.\nMaster of the Three Ones, your celestial mandate was fulfilled.\nAs you departed, your dream dissolved into transformation,\nsilently aligning with the true essence.\nThe Emperor commanded, bestowing upon you\nthe golden grotto’s return to the origin.\nI would ask you: what was the cause?\nTruth and illusion converge—\na hundred years pass in the blink of an eye.\nTranscendent, you departed,\na white steed soaring lightly.\"*\n\nLao Pu Qikuan praised his spirit in verse:\n\n*\"Unseen to the eye, unheard to the ear,\nyet within, an image—strikingly like you.\nForced depictions, labored and strained,\nfall short in capturing even a fraction.\nEver present at the brows and lashes,\nbound yet unbound,\nlike still water, like drifting clouds.\"*\n\nFrom the *Stele Record of This Abbey*\n*Huang the Perfected One’s Release by Means of the Corpse*\n\nThe abbey’s Daoist Huang Zhiwei, styled Mingdao, was of a serene and unadorned nature, his form tall and imposing. During the Yuanfeng era, he served as an attendant in the Hall of Enlightenment, tending the incense and flame. One day, Master Cui of Mount Qian, the Embodied Dao, came to visit and spoke of the wonders of the Mud-Pill Palace of Ten Thousand Spirits and the single grain of the elixir knife. Thereupon, he transmitted to him the Way of the Nine Grains of Divine Nourishment and the principles of the Golden Liquid’s descent into the radiant realm. From that time onward, Huang wandered as if in a daze, his conduct unconstrained and erratic. The people of the time called him \"Huang the Windblown.\" He then composed the *Song of Huang’s Madness*, which is recorded in his collected works.\n\nBy nature, he loved wine; whenever drunk, he would sing loudly, and after singing, he would fall into wild abandon. Often, he stood on the Bridge of Morning Audience before the abbey, shouting vehemently as if rebuking someone. His sleeves were patched a hundred times, and he paid no heed to modesty, remaining indifferent to the cold of deep winter or the heat of midsummer. When scholars or officials offered him gifts, he would scatter them at once. Sometimes he dwelled in the mountains, sometimes he wandered through the cities. He always carried two cloth sacks, into which he haphazardly stuffed cakes, medicines, and the like, yet they emitted no foul odor—he called them his \"brocade fragrance.\"\n\nOnce, a great snow fell, turning the forests and valleys white, yet the roof of the master’s dwelling alone remained free of snow. He would often point to the altar by the wall of his chamber and tell people, \"This is the path by which I traveled to Shu.\" Though he had never studied books, his conversations often touched upon historical records. Though untrained in literary arts, his utterances were always lofty and wondrous. He associated with Cai Zigao of Monkey Creek, Sima Zhibai, Cui Fengzi, and Gao Chijiao.\n\nThe master was fond of sighing deeply, and when he sighed, the sound would continue without pause. In the late Chongning era, though he was over ninety years old, his appearance was like that of a maiden, his skin smooth as jade, and his mad demeanor unchanged. His capacity for wine had not diminished. At the end of the Xuanhe era, an imperial summons was issued, but he refused to answer. When officials pressed him, he reached Jiujiang and said, \"Now there are two emperors—why should I go?\" Soon after, when Emperor Qinsheng ascended the throne, an amnesty was proclaimed, and the decree reached the abbey.\n\nBefore the day of the conflagration, the master, in the Hall of Visitation, planted mugwort and reeds, singing, *\"Next year it will end, next year it will end.\"* The following year, when the rebel Han Shiqing’s cavalry indeed burned the abbey, it was on the very day he had planted the mugwort. His predictions of fortune and misfortune were all borne out with precision.\n\nThe master ascended in feathered transformation, seated beside the abbey.\n\nSeveral years later, a traveler returned from Shu and said: \"Huang Fengzi is now in Shu. We met in Chengdu, and he entrusted me with this letter for his family.\" The assembly was skeptical. Upon opening the letter, it bore the name of a Daoist mother who had perished in the chaos of war. They then opened the coffin to inspect it, finding only his garments and shoes.\n\n---\n\nFrom *Records of the Yellow Perfected One*\n\n**Liu Xugu’s Seated Transformation**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Liu Lie, styled Xuguzi, was born under an auspicious dream his mother had received. As he grew, he harbored lofty aspirations, studying in the mountains and keeping his associations pure. Nobles and officials marveled at his countenance, which bore the unspoiled air of high antiquity, and declared him a vessel of the Dao for future generations.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Shaoxing era, he built a thatched hermitage and named it *Zhenyi* (\"True Unity\"). Daily, he sat in meditation, perusing the Daoist canon and histories, committing all to memory at a glance. Scholars and officials sought his acquaintance. Master Zhu of Hui’an (Zhu Xi) discussed the *Book of Changes* with him, debating the principles of returning elixirs. A poem reads:\n\n*Carefully reading the hundred chapters on returning elixirs,*\n*The master’s brush, too, spoke at length.*\n*The primal mechanism lies hidden in scriptures’ search,*\n*Yet the supreme principle dwells in the space between eye and lash.*\n*One horse may yet be harnessed for my journey,*\n*Five sprouts should grow from my own garden.*\n*Tomorrow, sober, I descend the mountain—*\n*With whom shall I discuss these words again?*\n\nZhang Xiaoxiao (Zhang Jiucheng) left a poem upon their first meeting. Other verses praised his retreat:\n\n*A blessed land conceals a lesser grotto-heaven,*\n*Where immortals refine their spirits in seclusion.*\n*Only Xugu finds delight in this realm,*\n*Mastering the fire’s timing in perfect accord with nature.*\n\nMinisters Luo Dian, Wang Yan, Cao Xun, Zhou Shun of Fengxi, and Yue Fu of the Ministry of Rites—all renowned figures—visited to discuss the *Book of Changes* and exchanged fine verses. These are recorded in *Anthology of Eminent Worthies of This Abbey, Vol. 2*.\n\nBy the first year of the Longxing era, he had completed commentaries on the *Zhouyi* and *Liuren*, distilling their mechanisms into a single work. He journeyed to the capital to present it. The emperor summoned him for audience, inquired about the Dao, and hosted a banquet in his honor. His poems—*At the Imperial Command at Sanmao Abbey*, *Giving Thanks for the Gift of Wine*, and *Petitioning to Return to the Mountains*—are preserved in his collected works.\n\nLater, he dwelled in the mountains for over a decade. In the ninth year of the Qiandao era, in the sixth month, he abstained from food for over forty days, drinking only jade-like water. On the fourteenth day of the seventh month, he personally delivered twenty-five volumes of *Dengzhen Yinjue* and nine volumes of *Shangjing* to the wooden repository of the abbey’s records. The next day, on the Zhongyuan Festival, he left a final poem and ode in his own hand, which read:\n\n*Xuguzi, about to shed his form and abandon the world,*\n*Sweeps away worldly ties to hasten toward the vast expanse of mist and clouds,*\n*There to merge with the Dao in profound unity.*\n\nOn the sixteenth night, he walked under the moon to the summit of Mount Lu’s Keniu Cave, sat in meditation, and transformed.\n\nHis works—*A Hundred Chapters on Returning Elixirs*, miscellaneous writings, poetry, *Exegesis of the Zhouyi*, and *Preface to the Mountain Studio’s Edition of the Book of Changes* by Shangshu—along with *Comprehensive Diagrams of Successive Dynasties’ Rulers and Ministers*—circulated widely. An inscription by Jiang Yongshe in the hall’s stele records this, drawn from *Biographies of the Xugu Father and Son* and *Records of This Abbey*.\n\n---\n\n**The Founding Master Liu’s Transformation**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Liu Dazhang, styled Kaizu, was a native of Hukou in Jiangzhou, born in the *guihai* year of the Yuanfeng era. From childhood, he studied in the mountains. During Emperor Huizong’s reign, he was tested on the scriptures and ordained as a Daoist, taking Yang Yiyi as his master.\n\nWhen the Jianyan era’s warfare erupted, he fled to Poyang. Later, returning home to visit his parents, he heard that the abbey had been entirely consumed by flames. Unable to advance or retreat, he settled with his disciple Luo Shouming in a deserted house in the southeastern corner of Chaoyi. There, they reverently maintained the incense and offerings of the Visitation Hall, weeping as they recounted their plight and vowing to propagate the Daoist teachings and restore its profound merit.\n\nLiu was a man of pure integrity, owning no excess possessions, and keeping his associations unsullied. The villagers praised him. His Way flourished as he aided others and benefited all things. He tore down the thatched hut and rebuilt it anew, naming it *Longde Hermitage*—the present-day Xihu Daoist Abbey. Scholars and commoners turned to him in devotion, and the incense offerings grew daily.\n\nBy then, Liu was already advanced in years, yet his appearance remained as youthful as a maiden’s.\n\nOne morning, he rose at dawn, bathed, changed his robes, and recited the *Scripture of Salvation for All*. When he finished, he summoned his disciple to his side and spoke to him of the Dao of transcending life and death. Then, with composure, he said: \"Tend to the incense and offerings.\" He stood, and in that moment, transformed. His countenance remained as though alive, and those who witnessed it gathered like a wall.\n\n*From the Annals of the Original Abbey: The Seated Transcendence of Patriarch Luo*\n\nDaoist Luo Shouming of the Original Abbey, styled Deguang, was the foremost disciple of Liu Dazhang. Born in the Jiawu year of the Zhenghe era in Pengze of Jiangzhou, he followed his master in fleeing to Poyang during the Jianyan period, returning with him to their hometown. Upon hearing that the Original Abbey had been reduced to ashes, he and his master took residence in Longde Hermitage. His Dao was the familial transmission of the robe and bowl. Daily, he purchased creatures of flight and fin to set them free, never faltering in this practice.\n\nOne day, gravely ill, he summoned his five disciples—Yu Huaide, Yang Huaiyu, Li Huaizhi, Pan Huaixin, and Liu Huainen—and took up his brush to write a verse. Continuing, he said: \"When I am sick, it is not inauspicious; when I speak of death, it is not death. If you encounter the Perfected Lü, then it is my good fortune.\" The original manuscript remains preserved in the Original Abbey.\n\nBefore long, his illness abated, and he returned to the abbey. There, on the former site of the Yellow Perfected’s sanctuary, he established a new Daoist cloister, naming it *Yangzheng Hermitage*. Taking the Yellow Perfected’s Daoist title, it was later renamed *Yellow Immortal Abbey*.\n\nPatriarch Luo lived to a great age. Each day, he burned incense and recited scriptures, never engaging in frivolous associations. One day, he entered the hall, arranged his robe, and sat in full-lotus posture. As the assembly began their meal, he remained motionless. Upon closer inspection, he had already transcended in seated meditation. Truly, this fulfilled his words of \"inauspicious sickness and auspicious death.\" How extraordinary!\n\nThe following day, a resident of West Lake dreamed of the Patriarch clad in purple, preceded by two azure-clad attendants bearing ceremonial staffs. He recognized the inscription above: \"Immortal Official of Huotong Grotto-Heaven.\" Patriarch Luo was interred to the left of the abbey. The abbey’s overseer, Hu Baoqing, lifted the coffin and declared: \"Do not disturb his truth with chaos, nor obstruct his Dao with wealth and honor.\" Though he left no miraculous form to abide in the world, he achieved the merit of liberation through seated transcendence.\n\nThe former hermitage at West Lake flourished with incense offerings, surpassing all former days.\n\n*From the Annals of the Original Abbey: Record of Facts Concerning the Visitation Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey, Scroll Five—End.*\n\n**Stele Inscription for the Temple of the Nine Heavens Envoys, with Preface**\n\n*Composed by Li Chi, a humble scholar of the Eastern Mountains of Huangmei County in Qizhou*\n\nAccording to the *Record of Facts* sent by Wang Ruan, Prefect of Fuzhou and former resident of De’an County in Jiangzhou: During the Kaiyuan era, the Tang Emperor Minghuang dreamed of a divine being who called himself the \"Envoy of Mount Lu\" and requested the establishment of a temple. Imperial edicts were issued to prefectures, commanding local scholars to compose stele inscriptions for the Envoy. Of the 681 authors, only this text was selected for use. Yet when summoned, the author did not attend. The original inscription in the abbey’s records contained only 551 characters. In the fifth year of the Chunyou reign (1315), Minister Cheng Cangzhou of the Secretariat recovered the full text—1,772 characters in total. However, the character *chi* (沘) here differs from the original, so both versions are preserved. For further details, see Minister Cheng’s postscript.\n\nWe reverently examine the classics: The *Book of Changes* states, *\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao; the unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the divine.\"* The Dao gives birth to the Three, blending and evolving in profound transformation. The divine, attaining unity, mysteriously abides in tranquil obscurity. How majestic is the Great Origin, its distant subtleties transcending all! It governs the utmost of creation and transformation—how could it not be supremely venerated?\n\nIn the Later Tang, successive sagely emperors radiated great brilliance from beginning to end. At the noon of Lu Xi’s yang, their light illuminated the jade capital; wielding the mandate of primal destiny, they inscribed prosperity upon the tripod’s tally. White clouds stood solitary in lofty peaks, while purple auroras spanned a thousand ages, and the sun soared through the Han Valley.\n\nOur Emperor of Divine Martiality in the Kaiyuan era, encompassing the heavens and receiving the celestial mandate, held the profound mystery of the Dark Pearl and cast aside treasured riches. He expounded the supreme Dao in the realm of the formless and untraceable, dissolving the stagnation of miscellaneous doctrines—this is the first mark of sageliness. In the reverent rituals of the ancestral temple, he purified teachings, his filial piety and fraternal love shining brightly, so that heaven and earth looked up in emulation—this is the second mark of divinity. He returned the instruments of war to the three agricultural seasons, and with the might of bow and arrow, the divine judged the six directions—this is the third mark of martial prowess. Discerning the changes of the times through celestial patterns, while common people remained mired in mediocrity, none could ascend to his sagely insight—this is the fourth mark of civil wisdom.\n\nThus, his spirit soared beyond forms, his gaze fixed upon lofty renown. He exhorted offerings to the *River Chart*, and the numinous paid homage to the Sea Lord. The heart of Yao was illuminated, as if perceiving the subtle signs of the lotus stalk; the eyes of the Xuanyuan Emperor governed brightness, bending the banner to the thatched courtyard. Therefore, Yu expanded the land, and Xia received jade from heaven. He received the rare treasures of the Queen Mother of the West and presented his accomplishments to the Eastern Empress. The Five Dragons advanced the calendar, surpassing the lofty lineage of Liangfu; the Eight Steeds roamed in majesty, shaming the crudeness of Kunlun’s peaks. The celestial vault revolved above, mountains and hills surged below, while the successive sages dwelled in communion with the immortals, their blessings converging.\n\nEmperor Wen embodied righteousness, Emperor Wu bore the celestial chart—the flourishing of the supreme Dao has a long and venerable history. Since the blessings of the Hua region were offered, sagely virtue has endured through the ages. Golden tablets transmitted scriptures, and pearls flowed with the essence of nectar. The princess, through heavenly compassion, entered the Dao, embracing transformation like the lotus; the imperial librarian, as a royal prince, left the household, cultivating the fragrant zhi and mu herbs. The Northern Mystery inspired thoughts of the immortal ranks, while the Southern Elixir sought the causes of supreme attainment. The sagely lineage, though devoted to non-action, found its expression here, gathering the sacred peaks. The abodes of the Perfected Lords and the palaces of the Dao shone forth, their temples established to secretly assist the divine lineage.\n\nAmong the two mountains, Qingcheng and Mount Lu, stand as the foremost of the peaks that aid the mandate. The *Records of the Immortal Elder* and the *Secret Teachings of the Perfected Lord*, the numinous offices of the Envoys, are clearly discerned in the unseen. Their names inscribed in the Five Methods, they rise above the Three Demons. Though the towering peaks may suffer erosion, they do not falter in their abundance; though the valleys endure cold and heat, they invariably align with the seasons of humanity.\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the eighth month in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era (731), a resplendent edict was issued: *\"The Temple of the Elder of Qingcheng Mountain and the Temple of the Envoy of Mount Lu shall follow the precedent of the Five Sacred Peaks’ Perfected Lords’ Temples. Five virtuous Daoist priests shall be selected to perform rituals and offerings. The local authorities shall choose those of evident Daoist attainment to serve in perpetuity. Their names shall be reported through the proper channels, and temple envoys shall be appointed. Within the temples, the true portraits of the Envoys shall be established, and rituals of memorial, jiao offerings, and fasting shall be conducted, ensuring grand observances in the Daoist abbeys.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang Pinggong, hailing from the Qin capital, proclaimed the Dao’s principles in the Jiang region. His temple was adorned with resplendent colors, and he was bestowed with the rites of dark tablets. Arriving in a four-horse carriage, his light illuminated the cloudy cliffs.\n\nDu Hu Zheng, Military Commissioner of Jiangzhou and Prefect of the region, governed Chaisang with steadfast virtue, his reputation long established. Observing the armory of the times, he inherited the firmness of literary tradition. He began the construction of the fortress city, his efforts ever more vigorous, his grand designs surpassing all in elegance, his ambitions flourishing in abundance.\n\nYang Chuyu, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Acting Prefectural Administrator; Huangfu Chuyu, Acting Prefectural Marshal; and Wei Chang, Magistrate of Xunyang County—all revered the sagely goodness and deliberated upon the sacred precinct. Daoists and laypeople alike devoted themselves with utmost sincerity, their hidden blessings gathering in marvel.\n\nAt the outset of the earthworks, a rain of dust and haze arose, yet in an instant, the skies cleared, and rosy clouds adorned the horizon. When the auspicious tortoise was set to establish the foundation, and the golden rainbow spanned the journey, the gloom of yin dissipated, and the remnants of darkness were dispelled. Gazing into the mysterious void, they reverently contemplated the imperial Dao. Fragrance filled the air, purity prevailed, and the rituals of memorial and jiao offerings lifted their spirits. The six directions were profound and obscure, yet in a single night, all became radiant.\n\nSuddenly, from the midst of the empty sky, a divine radiance burst forth, its brilliance adorning the ninefold streams and illuminating the thousand-fathom heights. The officials prostrated themselves, and the people and clerks all beheld the spectacle. In ancient times, when the celestial spirits descended upon Zhou, they were greeted with the *Cloud Gate* dance; when the divine light shone upon Han, the *Great Unity* ascended the inner chamber. Yet here, as the qi of the northern lands converged, the southern realm transformed in splendor. Though frost and sleet weighed upon the land, and the people lamented the bitter cold...\n\nThus the Master of the Law, with earnest devotion, ascended the immortal courts, wielding the authority of the state’s mandate. Thereupon, the depths of winter grew mild, and the crimson sun shone bright in a cloudless sky, harmonizing the hidden and the manifest, and bestowing ease upon those who toiled unto exhaustion. All things turned to advantage, and all rejoiced in the advent of blessings.\n\nThey then divined a propitious site in the sacred outskirts and forthwith established a numinous precinct. The peaks rose and fell like undulating ridges, their verdant pines and cliffs steeped in emerald hues. They summoned timber from the gates of Ying and drew fine wood from the Jing Mountains’ ravines. They hewed the towering cliffs and encircled the grounds with long walls. Vermilion walls stood in ordered rows like strings of coins, while cinnabar pillars rested upon embroidered plinths. Three chambers and four boundaries were adorned with resplendent paintings and carved beams; the eight directions and nine corners bore suspended bells and intricately wrought balustrades. Rainbow beams spanned the halls, and wind-borne windows supported the lintels. Inverted well-tiles bore patterns of moss, and fragrant altars were swept clean by bamboo brooms. Silver knockers gleamed in the moonlight, and jade hooks opened with the frost. As for the divine principle in its full mystery and the true countenance rarely glimpsed—such secret forms, far removed from mortal governance, were transmitted to the officiating bureau. For even when consulting the charts of the Three Immortals, one finds no likeness in the Nine Cauldrons of the provinces. Their radiant forms, painted in white and powdered hues, embodied both substance and luminous beauty. Suddenly, as if in a vision of the unseen, the divine companions manifested auspicious signs, and the artisans, their thoughts exhausted, were moved by communion with the numinous. Within the oratory and the altar of covenant, the presence of the spirits was so vivid that it seemed they were truly there. Lightning banners and mist-sifted rays displayed their feathered regalia. Arrayed upon the sacred mountains, their rites equaled those of the wandering streams. Extending their reverence to the Purple Ultimate, they made offerings to the Yellow-Crowned. Jade cauldrons ever simmered, and golden censers perpetually burned. Sacrificial beasts were tethered, and grass offerings prepared, while simurghs and phoenixes took flight. Dew embraced the divine elders, and stars shone upon the Weaving Maiden. Pure flutes and resonant chants echoed across the celestial isles of the gourd’s ford; the waters of the divine palace mirrored the isles of Penglai in the sea’s curve. Dragon-brewed nectar and crane-harmonized drafts wafted through the courtyards of pure precepts; lions and apotropaic beasts danced and leapt in the realms of concentrated devotion. Pearl banners guarded the repasts, and jade canopies sheltered the palanquins. The offerings of the celestial kitchens were presented in the six periods of the day; the true scriptures within cloud-like canopies were recited through ten thousand kalpas of cultivation. Unlike the thatched huts of old, whose frugality long shone in the illustrious age, the craftsmanship of carpenters and artisans exalted the divine principle, far surpassing the splendor of mere favor. The sacred grace filled the halls, and the spirits dwelled in their cavernous abodes. To come before them and invoke blessings—was this not most fitting?\n\nIn the twelfth month of winter, the overseers completed their measurements with plumb lines and cords. The Daoist adepts Zhang Chongji and others, embracing the Five Thousand Characters of the Teachings, united the multitudes in countless numbers. Ascending the immortal ranks, they gazed upward in reverence, and grasping the sagely calculations, they drove forth their sincerity. The celestial envoys wished to honor the carved and chiseled work, their hearts dwelling upon the imperial court; the assembly of the Law hoped to rely upon the splendor of the jade-like edifice, their Dao resting upon the august peaks. Peach blossoms upon spring waters obscured the source, leading one ever farther, while the secluded groves and apricot dells lay not far from this blessed site. Prostrating in celebration of the celestial favor, they dared to compose this eulogy:\n\nThe Dao is profound and deeply mysterious,\nThe divine abides in the court of blessings.\nThe Three Luminaries govern the extremes,\nThe Five Peaks cradle the spirits.\nIts truth is a thing unto itself,\nIts subtlety formless.\nIts principle is elusive,\nIts merit supreme tranquility.\nO majestic imperial ultimate,\nIlluminating and harmonizing creation!\nThe sagely grasp the Dark Pearl,\nAuspicious and grand, the Great Treasure.\nThe azure expanse gathers in completion,\nThe purple clouds honor the Dao.\nOffering to the hundred spirits,\nDelving into the origins of the Five Elders.\nThus they unrolled the sacred mountains,\nThe secrets of the mountain spirits.\nThe Three Images float in essence,\nThe Ten Flowers speak from immortal mouths.\nTheir might shakes the clouds and rain,\nTheir spirit pervades heaven and earth.\nThe dharma-image shines in clarity,\nThe true chart gleams in purity.\nFortunate in the auspicious era of bright virtue,\nThey descend in honor upon the hidden shrine.\nEscorting the immortal rites with solemnity,\nResplendent in auspicious splendor!\nThe evening glow of the jade palace glows,\nThe divine light of the gem trees brushes.\nCarved radiance in emerald ranks,\nJade cauldrons blend their fragrance.\nPlucking the five sacred herbs from verdant peaks,\nGathering the eight cassia boughs from soaring beams.\nDragons chant and phoenixes dance along the long celestial path,\nClad in robes of azure clouds and white rainbows.\nStriking the jade chimes in empty song,\nArriving at the feathered truths with nectar fine.\nMysteriously stirring the abode of blessings,\nIn subtle hues ascending the divine ultimate.\nDrawing the flowing waters of the Matching Stream,\nGazing upon the brocade colors of the incense burners.\nLeaving the cranes’ words for a thousand years,\nThe simurghs’ adornments gathered in a single breath.\nThe True Mother of the Crimson River is seldom met,\nThe Immortal Maidens of the Azure Sea are fathomless in their majesty.\nRevering the perfect Dao of the Three and Five,\nOffering the symbols of fortune in countless myriads.\nInscribing the true stone upon the famous mountains,\nMagnifying the grand design through imperial power.\n\nIn the twentieth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the cyclical year *renshen*, on the twenty-fifth day of the first month, the first day of which was *yisi*, the stele was erected.\n\n**Postscript to the Stele of the Tang Envoys of the Nine Heavens**\n\nAbove, the vault of heaven arches in its true azure hue, and through the gathering and dispersing of the single *qi*, the myriad beings are born and transformed, none knowing how or why. Who governs this? Who binds it together? According to the Confucians, the physical form is called \"Heaven,\" and the ruling power is called \"Emperor,\" a distinction finely parsed. The Daoist texts, however, explicitly declare that the sovereign power is the August Thearch, who dwells on high in the celestial pole, governing the Three Realms, apportioning duties, and ruling—much like the emperors and kings of the world. Within, they have ministers and a hundred officials; without, they have regional lords and feudal vassals. Bound by silken threads and corded ties, they wield life and death, reward and punishment, each leading their subordinates to establish the ultimate standard for the people. The hidden and the manifest follow a single Dao, and this can indeed be inferred by analogy. Yet the Confucians, reluctant to speak of it, find it difficult to articulate.\n\nThe True Lords of Mount Qingcheng, Mount Qian, and Mount Lu descended in numinous manifestations during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang. Tracing their origins, they share the same primordial essence with the Limitless Dao Ancestor, governing the transformations of the myriad beings, responding to the times to rule the world, and protecting the state and its people. Can one truly gauge their duration by the length of dynasties, or their prominence by the obscurity or clarity of their appearances?\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, Ye Yiwen, the Prefect of Jiujiang, compiled the *Records of Responses*, which included the Tang stele of Li Pi’s temple. In recent years, Daoist adepts have sought to restore lost texts, beginning with a single sheet of recorded facts sent by Wang Ruan, the former Prefect of Linchuan. It states that upon the completion of the Kaiyuan temple, an edict was issued to the Prefect Du Guzheng to seek out the artisans and record their measurements for the inscription of a stele, which was then presented to the throne. Among the 681 scholars, Li Pi’s text was deemed most fitting, and he was summoned, though he firmly declined. Wang Ruan’s account seems well-founded. Yet Li Pi’s courtesy name was *Yi*—could the old records be in error? The eulogy’s florid prose is indeed impressive, suggesting that its author, though dwelling in the Dao and not in office, once delved deeply into the true teachings.\n\nIn the founding of Our August Dynasty, as the celestial mandate unfolded and the realm ascended to profound peace, the ancestral temples were transformed into Daoist abbeys and halls, where seasonal rites were solemnly observed with reverence. Since the restoration and southward crossing, the divine aid of the Perfected Lord in upholding righteousness and blessing the virtuous has manifested in wondrous responses. Upon ascending the throne, His Majesty has emulated the wisdom of antiquity, embodying sacred frugality and diligence. When the cosmic cycles converged and border disturbances arose, his heart was deeply moved, and for the sake of the people’s salvation, he secretly inscribed his name in supplication with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe former overseer of the Supreme Clarity, Master Xiong Shouzhong, having received the imperial decree to attend to these matters, prostrated himself at the palace gates, entreating that an honorific title be bestowed upon the Perfected Lord. Thereupon, His Majesty personally inscribed the three characters *Three Clarities Pavilion* as a gift. An edict was issued, adding the two characters *Wondrous Transformation* beneath *Exploring the Nine Heavens, Responding to the Primordial, Preserving the Mandate*.\n\nYour servant, Xu, entrusted with the brush in the Western Bureau, though unworthy of such a task, feared he could not adequately convey the imperial intent. Master Shouzhong then presented Li Pi’s text, and upon examining its origins, I have humbly expanded upon the imperial bestowal. Amid the dire calamities of the Rong and Di rebellions, when the two blessed lands of Min and Qian were shrouded in ominous vapors, only Mount Lu stood majestic and serene—this is why His Majesty has so earnestly upheld the rites of veneration and the offerings of exorcism, thereby securing the nation’s stability and relieving the people’s suffering. How can this be compared to the extravagant displays of those who dwell in towering pavilions or erect palatial halls, vainly seeking transcendence while indulging their desires?\n\nAlas! The cycles of fortune—nine calamities in a hundred and six—are ordained by destiny, even the most prosperous of emperors cannot escape them. Yet the Dao of Heaven cherishes life; how could it bear to see its children slaughtered by the sword? The sovereign, acting as Heaven’s deputy to nurture the myriad people, must embody Heaven’s generative, nourishing, and sustaining virtues. Thus, the scourge of war may be quelled, and harmonious qi may be summoned. Otherwise, how could the preservation of the kalpa’s destiny and the salvation of all beings be revealed in the sacred scriptures of the Dragon Han and Crimson Brilliance eras? Yet in recent times, such decrees have emanated from Heaven itself, seeking to prolong the celestial mandate. The sacred teachings have been transmitted—how could they align so perfectly with the unseen will of Heaven?\n\nNow, His Majesty, diligent in governance and ever mindful of order, communes with the mind of Heaven. As adversity gives way to prosperity, the signs of renewal are manifest. Shall not the celestial ladders and towering peaks be swept clean of all obstructions? Shall not the Five Elders and Mount Song stand as eternal guardians along the river’s course? Under the vast canopy of Heaven, all—whether ruler or subject—shall be encompassed, with the sacred mountains anchoring the four directions and the central realm. The divine tripod shall be established upon the Rong and Wen rivers; the chariots and script shall extend for ten thousand li, and the hundred barbarians shall be adorned in courtly attire. The sacrifices to the Zhou shall be matched with those to Heaven, and the dynasty’s legacy shall endure for a thousand myriad generations.\n\nThis humble servant, though unworthy, holds office in the realm of letters. Following the elegance of *The Chariot’s Advance* and *Lofty Mount Song*, I have inscribed this stele to commemorate the era of primordial peace. Though my talents are ill-suited to the task, I have taken up the brush in emulation of Li Pi, awaiting further instruction.\n\nIn the first year of the Chunyou reign, the year *xinchou*, on the Double Ninth Festival, Cheng Xu, Gentleman for Court Audiences, Guardian of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and Academician of the Institute of Academicians, bows in reverence and respectfully appends this postscript.\n\n*Stele Inscription for the Renovation of This Abbey in the Second Year of the Jingde Reign of the August Dynasty*\nComposed by Zhou Qi\n\nWhen the Two Modes first divided and the Three Powers took their places, the vast and luminous expanse unfolded with celestial bodies arrayed in their celestial paths, while the boundless and profound earth set its mountains and rivers within their bounds. Cold and heat interwove to order the year’s labors, yin and yang intermingled to give rise to the numinous. Such is the authority of transformation, and thus there must be those who govern, to harmonize the decrees of the Supreme Emperor and bestow blessings upon the people below.\n\nOf old, the sages established the imperial standard, instituting sacrificial rites, examining the sacred texts, exorcising misfortune through ritual and teaching to manifest sincerity, and distinguishing ranks through chariots, robes, and emblems. They spread instruction without limit and guided with wondrous efficacy as their foundation. The veneration of virtue and the repayment of merit have ever been esteemed.\n\nThe Abbey of Great Peace Flourishing Under Heaven on Mount Lu is the temple of the Messenger of the Nine Heavens. In the Tang dynasty, during the Kaiyuan reign, the throne first received mysterious inspiration and was favored with the bestowal of the Most Real. Seeking to commune with the silence of the Pure Capital, the emperor consulted the masters of the esoteric arts. Relying on this sacred mountain, they first established the abode of immortals.\n\nAs the celestial mandate shifted and the realm was thrown into turmoil, the abbey’s numinous heart awaited its time, aligning with the hidden destiny of a flourishing dynasty. Our August Ancestor, the Emperor, soared to the heavens upon the Five Movements, governing the myriad states and ascending the throne. His civilizing influence extended beyond all bounds, and his radiant governance reached to the farthest limits. This sacred land, a profound and secluded realm, stood at the convergence of the Nine Provinces, where the hundred spirits received their offices.\n\nOur Emperor Taizong, grasping the celestial tally and ascending the great treasure, transformed customs and brought peace to the people. He revived neglected rites, ordered all matters without omission, fulfilled the duties of emperors and kings, and extended his profound benevolence in nurturing all life. Turning his gaze to this abbey of assembled spirits, a place of grand supplication for blessings, he specially issued a rescript in purple, bestowing its rightful name, reaffirming the solemnity of the rites as if the spirits were present, and granting it an era name.\n\nOur present Emperor, having received the true record, nurtures the black-haired masses, upholds the grand designs of his sagely predecessors, and inaugurates an everlasting imperial legacy. In governing the state and the family, he reverts to the unadorned virtues of antiquity; amidst the myriad affairs of state, he labors diligently for the people’s welfare. Moreover, his sagely virtue daily renews, endowed by heaven with manifold talents. His imperial compositions shine brilliantly in the heavens, and his sagacious strategies embrace even distant lands. He humbly remains receptive to counsel and solemnly fulfills his filial piety.\n\nAs for the manifold auspicious signs and the abundant blessings that have accrued—though unrecorded in earlier annals and unknown even to the most learned—these have long been embedded in the people’s songs and familiar to all ears. Those who dig wells and till fields know not the emperor’s power, yet those who gaze at the clouds and look toward the palace gates find their deeds ceaselessly inscribed in history. Thus, from within and without, the realm hastens to the celestial court, and peoples from afar gather to present their local marvels, offering them as tokens of the Primordial Mandate and responses to the numinous decree. This is indeed a great ritual, one that heaven itself can scarcely match. Though it originates in the emperor’s assent, it ultimately defers to the people’s desires.\n\nThereupon, the procession of laws and the solemnity of the guards were arrayed; the sealed peaks were opened for inspection, and the grand rites were fully displayed. Jade seats were set upon the Fen River, and the great repayment to heaven and earth was solemnly performed. The glorious achievements of the ancestral emperors were illuminated, and the utmost sincerity was offered to heaven and earth. The grand principles of past ages were surpassed, and the splendor of this accomplished ritual was made manifest. Was this merely the gathering of auspicious light at the bamboo palace or the embrace of the pure and vast at the paulownia ridge? The celestial celebration was already complete, and the vast grace already pervasive.\n\nAs for the shrines nestled in cliffs and valleys and the heroic deeds left by history, offerings were still made and firewood-gathering was forbidden. How much more so for the chief ministers of the Supreme Emperor and the separate retinues of the assembled perfected? Calculating the days, there was no need for reconstruction, nor was there any reason to alter what had been done before. Thus, the emperor commanded his attendants to seek skilled artisans and stoneworkers, with expenses provided by the court, so that the work might be joyfully completed.\n\nPillars and beams were raised in grand design, and paintings and decorations were renewed in splendor. Banners and sacred seats gleamed within the inner precincts, while rosy clouds and starry crowns circled among the attendants. When the wind ceased and the feathered guests arrived for their morning devotions, the star altars were illuminated by crimson light at night, and the cloud chariots of the many sages were heard from afar.\n\nDuring the auspicious seasons of the Three Primes, when the Six Qi harmonized, all reverently upheld the ritual codes, solemnly arraying the offerings. They prayed for the sagacious longevity of the imperial enterprise and for the people’s blessings in abundant life. Auspicious omens gathered like chess pieces, and all attained wealth and longevity.\n\nThis splendid edifice, now reopened to manifest its numinous power, is embraced by mountains and rivers on all sides, its sashes and belts intersecting at the eight thoroughfares. Truly, it is the dwelling of immortals and the gateway of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, to record its numinous traces and inscribe its steadfast stone, to make manifest the trustworthy record—this follows the old model. I, though unworthy, have been allowed to linger among the near ranks, possessing not an inch of talent. Yet, favored by the radiant grace, I respectfully compose this inscription:\n\nThe August Emperor receives the chart,\nAnd heaven’s bright mandate is bestowed.\nHe governs the eight directions,\nAnd orders all affairs of state.\nHis grace soaks all living things,\nHis commands spread like the wind.\nHe follows the Dao of heaven,\nAnd brings blessings to the myriad people.\n\nHe appoints the many officials,\nAnd establishes the people’s standard.\nHe venerates and exalts the bright sacrifices,\nIlluminating his illustrious virtue.\nFor the people he prays for blessings,\nThat they may live without harm.\n\nThe officials hold their posts,\nAnd the spirits too receive their offices.\nHere upon this sacred peak,\nTowering in the great void,\nThe perfected ones gather,\nAnd immortals make their abode.\nMountains and rivers embrace,\nWaters and trees flourish.\nRites expel yin’s darkness,\nAnd the seasons turn in harmony.\n\nThe Dao has its rises and falls,\nBut the era meets with flourishing.\nBlessings fill the realm,\nAnd teachings are honored beyond its borders.\nThe feathered guests refine their practice,\nRevering the true texts and exorcising misfortune.\nThough the hidden destiny has its time,\nIt reveals the communion of spirits and men.\n\nThe star of the envoy hastens south,\nAnd the river’s edge is marked by the traces of the perfected.\nOrnamentation enhances the solemnity of the images,\nAnd vermilion steps glow with layered brilliance.\nOverlooking the great road from soaring eaves,\nThe layered towers cast shade upon the splendid halls.\n\nCompleted in no time,\nYet how could the people’s labor be known?\nSolemn are the perfected ones above,\nAs the jade halls are renewed.\n\nVermilion clouds drift like sifted silk,\nAnd the bright moon halts its wheel.\n\nThe abode of the numinous heart shines in response,\nAnd customs flourish in harmony and purity.\nMay the imperial reign endure ten thousand years,\nAnd all beings bask in eternal spring.\n\n*Record of the Hall of Imperial Visitation*\nComposed by Gentleman for Court Audiences, Supervisor of the Temple of Great Peace and National Revival, Commandant, and Purple-Gold Fish-Bag Bearer, Your Servant Xiong Ben\nInscribed by Gentleman for Court Audiences, Drafter of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion, Prefect of Hongzhou, Commissioner of Jiangxi, and Baron of Nanyang County, Your Servant Cai Yanqing\n\nIn the first month of the fourth Yuanfeng year, on the day *yimao*, an edict was issued to the Central Secretariat and Chancellery: The Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor of the Temple of Great Peace and National Revival on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou may be advanced in title to *Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor, Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny, Perfected Lord*.\n\nOn the same day, the Central Secretariat issued the decree to the relevant authorities. On the third day, *jihai*, Your Servant Jiao Zhi, Provisional Administrator of the Jiangnan Eastern Circuit Transport Bureau, reverently presented imperial incense and sacrificial prayers to make the announcement. On the day *wuchen* of the fourth month, Your Servant Liao Wei, Gentleman of the Interior for Court Service in the Palace Domestic Service, escorted the imperial calligraphy, hall plaque, immortal robes, and ritual banners and staffs to their shrine for installation. Furthermore, green memorials and yellow silk petitions were bestowed, and a jiao offering was conducted at the altar hall for two days and nights. The imperial edict and immortal robes were stored in jeweled caskets, lined with embroidered silk, and wrapped in crimson robes adorned with cloud-cranes in gold leaf. The plaque’s characters were gilded, flanked by dragons, simurghs, and blossoming flowers in flight, while the colored banners, auspicious staffs, and ornaments—all of unparalleled splendor—were bestowed from the imperial treasury, the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nThereupon, the assembled multitude of the Temple of Great Peace, along with officials great and small from within and beyond Jiujiang, monks and Daoists, young and old, all leapt and hastened forth, their faces alight with joy. Together, they purified themselves and conducted a jiao ceremony of celebration beneath the shrine, lasting eight days and nights. And they spoke among themselves, saying: \"This mountain’s temples were first established in the *xinshi* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, three hundred and fifty-one years ago. Since then, blessings have overflowed, and responses have been clear and manifest. In our dynasty’s statutes, local officials have offered sacrifices in spring and autumn, and every three years at the suburban rites, envoys have been dispatched to announce and offer sacrifices. Yet never before have there been gifts of jeweled crowns, cloud robes, ceremonial tablets, shoes, or stockings—such bounty in gratitude for the gods’ favor is already profound. Now, however, heaven has initiated this auspicious convergence, subtly aiding the sagely will, reviving ancient rites, elevating titles, and enriching ceremonies with splendid adornments—surpassing all that has come before in generations. The intent of this exaltation is fully set forth in the imperial edict. As for the specifics of the bestowed gifts and the order of the sacrificial rites, if not engraved in metal and stone, we fear they will not dazzle the eyes of the realm or endure for ten thousand generations. Your servant, having once served in the imperial secretariat and now overseeing this sacred temple, ought to record this momentous occasion.\"\n\nI humbly reflect that our sagely emperor, with great virtue, illuminates his ancestors and, with filial piety, communes with the divine. Reverent and diligent day and night, he seeks to respond to the blessings of the Three Spirits. Thus, he examines ritual texts, rectifies sacrificial canons, and consults the deliberations of ministers and scholars before issuing his decrees. As for the mountain and river spirits who descend to dwell among men, regardless of past or present, near or far, none are not accorded their proper rank, and their altars and jade offerings are all adorned with care. How much more so for this capital of the perfected, this court of fortune’s dispensation, whose name was established by the Yellow Emperor and whose office was conferred by the Most High? Its illustrious and resplendent titles have long awaited their full manifestation. It is fitting that the emperor’s heart, like timely rain, has issued this virtuous decree, and that the imperial edict below has proclaimed its extraordinary distinction. Thus, where sincerity is directed, responses duly arrive: when the imperial envoy turned south, numinous radiance touched the heavens; when the immortal hall was lit at night, divine music startled the ear. All felicitous omens and auspicious signs shall henceforth unfold in succession. Soon, the emperor will ascend Mount Tai, inscribe the Central Peak, and compose odes to the vastness of the great marshes, celebrating boundless blessings without precedent.\n\nThough I dwell far from the capital, I am like the farmer of old, singing the praises of great virtue. Now, having been honored to partake in this glorious occasion, it is my duty to compose this text in eulogy—I dare not refuse.\n\nWith bowed head and reverent obeisance, I offer this poem:\n\nO radiant and boundless heavens above the Middle Kingdom,\nThe Song dynasty perpetuates its luminous virtue.\nResplendent in sagely wisdom, it inherits the supreme throne,\nEndowed by heaven with civil and martial prowess, courage and insight.\nSerene in the Hall of Law, it consults the charts and records,\nRectifying all affairs and illuminating the obscure.\nLike wind and thunder, its beneficent influence spreads,\nAnd distant barbarians hasten to submit.\nThe qi harmonizes, the seasons prosper, and the people multiply,\nWhile gods and spirits all receive their offices.\nMajestic mountains house the immortal abodes,\nWhere five hundred numinous officials hold sway.\nRoaming and descending through the profound and silent,\nThey reward the good and punish the wicked, their depths unfathomable.\nResplendent jade texts emerge from the celestial brush,\nAdvancing its illustrious title to surpass past and present.\nLibations of peppered wine and cassia ale array the jade mats,\nPhoenix carriages and wind-drawn steeds arrive in endless procession.\nThe perfected ones rejoice, and the hundred spirits gather,\nAuspicious blessings pile high like mountains.\nMay the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years in blessed peace,\nAnd his inscriptions on Mount Tai gleam upon metal and stone.\nMay his descendants flourish in unbroken succession,\nAnd the common people dwell in peace and longevity.\n\n*Installation of the Jade Register*\nIn the fourth year of Yuanfeng, the Emperor Shenzong decreed: \"The Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor of the Temple of Great Peace and National Revival on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou is a noble spirit of heaven, bestowing blessings upon the world. Yet its exalted name and illustrious titles have been neglected through the ages, which is no way to repay the gods’ favor. Let it be advanced in title to *Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor, Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny, Perfected Lord*.\" The Gentleman of the Interior for Court Service in the Palace Domestic Service, Liao Wei, was dispatched to escort the golden calligraphy. The hall plaque and edict of commendation were bestowed accordingly.\n\nPreviously, the Daoist priest Tao Zhixian of this abbey had cleared the brambles and raised its halls. Upon breaking ground, he unearthed a single vertebra, which he split open and filled with earth—there, the soil bore five colors. He also discovered a bronze spring, its inscription reading *Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny*. At the time, none knew what auspicious sign this portended. Two years later, the imperial edict conferred honor, matching the inscription on the spring. Liao Wei then retrieved the spring and presented it to the court.\n\nWith reverence, we reflect: as the August Emperor faces south, the hundred spirits receive their offices. Heaven stirs his heart, and the unseen world aligns in harmony—is this not magnificent? In the fifth year of Zhenghe, the present Emperor, in his sixteenth year upon the throne, inherited the will of his predecessor and communed with the Dao to honor the gods. The divine ancestors and forebears rejoiced, gazing upon the four directions, where no spirit failed to pay homage. Turning his gaze southward, he beheld the Perfected Lord *Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny* descending to the palace courtyard, standing at the Emperor’s side. It was our divine predecessor who first established this grand title, yet the ritual registers remained incomplete. Now, in succession, those who follow are commanded to prepare the rites and confer the jade register.\n\nThe court dispatched Huang Jing, Gentleman of Valor of the Palace Domestic Service, to deliver the jade register. The register’s text bore the Emperor’s name, and it read: *\"With utmost reverence, we bow twice and declare...\"*—such was its solemnity. The local officials, magistrates, and temple officers knelt and rose in presentation with the utmost care. The register was carved from fine jade, bound with golden clasps, wrapped in brocade, and encased in a vermilion chest adorned with forest patterns and gilded fittings, its radiance dazzling, its craftsmanship exquisite beyond description. The assembled Daoists, their eyes gleaming with pride, cheered and danced, their faces alight with joy. Thereafter, the register was enshrined in a separate hall.\n\nThe following year, the temple officer Chai Chu arrived bearing incense and offerings. Some two hundred Daoists in feathered robes and yellow crowns advanced on horseback, declaring: *\"The sovereign cherishes the intent of the Dao and virtue, venerates the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, reverently serves the radiant deities, and diligently upholds the grand rites—honoring the flourishing of culture, surpassing the past and illuminating the future. Yet the inscriptions on metal and stone, being indelible, must proclaim the majesty of the imperial spirit and manifest it for posterity. Who, if not one well-versed in literature, is fit for this task?\"*\n\nOfficer Chai replied: *\"The Daoists speak truly.\"*\n\n*\"Carefully consulting the* Record of Marvels*, in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the August Emperor dreamed of a divine being clad in crimson robes and a golden crown, descending in a chariot and saying: ‘I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Investigation; lodge me on the northwest slope of Mount Lu.’ The next day, the deity appeared again in the palace courtyard, and the emperor commanded Wu Daozi to paint his likeness. An inner palace attendant was dispatched bearing the true portrait of the envoy, and a temple was erected on the northern side of the mountain. The August Emperor personally inscribed the殿额 in seal script and bestowed it, its text reading: ‘Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy.’ Yet the title ‘Envoy of Investigation’ was omitted, though the plaque itself remains. When the temple was first built, auspicious omens abounded, as recorded in the stele of Li Bi’s temple, Pan Guan’s* Record of Auspicious Verifications*, Zhang Jing’s* Continuation of Deyang Records*, and Chen Shun’s* Yu’s Record of Mount Lu*. Thus, the world came to know the envoy’s title. The temple on Mount Lu traces its origins to the Tang and its flourishing to the August Emperor.\"*\n\nOfficer Chai demurred: *\"This is not so. According to the* True Forms of the Five Peaks*, it is said: ‘The Five Peaks each have auxiliary mountains: Mount Song, Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, and Mount Heng are assisted by Shaoshi, Wudang, Luofu, Kuocang, Difei, Nüfan, Hefeng, and Baodu, which govern the four sacred peaks. Only Mount Heng stands solitary, without support.’ Thus, when the Yellow Emperor toured the realm and reached the south by the Yangtze, he petitioned the Supreme Emperor to establish Mount Qian and Mount Huo as the reserve lords of the Southern Peak. He further honored Mount Qingcheng as the ‘Elder’ and Mount Lu as the ‘Envoy.’ The title ‘Envoy’ thus predates the Tang. Though the* True Forms *emerged in the middle ages, it was compiled in the Eastern Jin from a lineage of transmitted teachings by generations of fangshi; it cannot be dismissed as false. During the Kaiyuan era, Sima Zimei of Tiantai asserted that the Five Peaks each had an Upper Clarity Perfected One appointed to their office, and he urged that each peak establish a shrine to its True Lord—this doctrine derived from the* True Forms*. The Kaiyuan edicts then designated the Elder Temple of Qingcheng and the Envoy Temple of Mount Lu, selecting Daoists to tend the incense and offerings, treating them on par with the True Lord shrines of the Five Peaks. Thus, the intent to honor the temple on Mount Lu originated with Sima Zimei. Whether the deity’s appearance in dreams was a divine revelation or mere illusion remains unknowable. Examining the records in detail, the Envoy’s spirit is likely a lofty Perfected One who stabilizes virtue, an auxiliary to Zhu Rong. This account predates the Eastern Jin, while the title ‘Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Investigation’ was a later addition. The temple on the northern slope of Mount Lu, however, began with the Tang’s August Emperor. In the Southern Tang, it was renamed the ‘Tongyuan Prefecture,’ and in the second year of the Taiping Xingguo era of our dynasty, it received its present name by imperial favor. The world, misled by vulgar and superficial steles and tales of the strange, has failed to investigate deeply, losing sight of the facts. Thus, I have set forth its origins and developments to dispel the confusion of future generations.\"*\n\nErected on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the first year of the Chonghe era.\n\nComposed by Hong Chu, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Palace, granted the rank of *Paiyu Dai*.\nThe plaque inscription was written by the humble scholar Shi Qidao.\nErected on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the first year of the Chonghe era by the Daoist disciples Chen Sigong, Tao Zhichang, Zhang Anzhu, Shen Jibin, Li Zhonggong, Xiao Minxiu, and Gao Zhidao.\n\n*Record of the Three Clarities Hall*\nBy the Grand Master for Court Audiences, concurrently Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, Da Zhong Dafu\n\nHerein lies the composition of Minister Wu Yu, Concurrent Academician of the Institute of Scholarly Worthies, Earl of De’an Prefecture with a fief of nine hundred households. The imperial nephew, Bearer of the Office of the Military Commissioner of Qingyuan, Duke of Tianshui Prefecture with a fief of two thousand households and a true seal of two hundred, Minister Yu, inscribed the calligraphy.\n\nSolemn is the August Supreme Thearch, who has established the great foundation of our Song. The sagely Son of Heaven, inheriting the grand calendar, reveres the Mandate of Heaven with awe. He has erected a terrace for worshipping Heaven, arrayed the celestial charts in due order, and stationed attendants on all sides—nowhere is Heaven not present. Yet, in this hallowed place of reverence, he has not failed to turn his sagely mind to all that may serve the people in beseeching Heaven. His luminous virtue and compassionate sacrifices have caused the hundred spirits to receive their offices.\n\nFormerly, the Nine Heavens’ Investigator of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou manifested numinous efficacy so resplendent that successive sages bestowed praise, ennobling him as the Perfected Lord of Response and Protection of the Mandate. Now, an edict has augmented his title with two more characters, calling him the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Transformation, and the Emperor himself has brushed three grand characters—*Three Clarities Hall*—to bestow upon him. Dragon-script adorns the void; phoenix-edicts illumine the age. Gazing upon them, reciting them, their renown resounds across the four seas. Ah, how splendid!\n\nFor Heaven attains clarity through the One—soundless, scentless, utterly transcendent. The teachings of the Daoist school speak of the Jade Clarity of the Upper Palace, the Supreme Clarity of the Middle Palace, and the Grand Clarity of the Lower Palace. Is it not that the Dao, originally of one origin, divides its qi into three realms, and within the nebulous and indistinct, this image arises? All Daoist temples throughout the world revere and serve these Two Clarities. The abbey lies on the northern slope of Mount Lu, where prayers are offered for deliverance from banditry, calamities, and portents. The rites of incense and official appointment grow ever more solemn; no petition goes unanswered, and its responses are as swift as an echo.\n\nI have long pondered this: Heaven is all-hearing and all-seeing, its majesty ever manifest below. It blesses the good and punishes the licentious, diminishes the full and augments the modest. There must be those who serve as Heaven’s eyes and ears—surely this is the office of the Investigator. The Supreme Thearch commands them to scrutinize the four quarters, just as the sovereign commands his ministers to survey the realm. The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things come to fruition—all to succor our people. Heaven’s succor of the people is boundless, and the sovereign’s prayers for them spare no effort. This is why the three grand characters were bestowed.\n\nThe hall was completed in the summer, the sixth month, the *jiazi* day of the Shaoding *renchen* year. The imperial gift was conferred in the winter, the intercalary twelfth month, the *jiazi* day of the Jiaxi *gengzi* year. From the era of Kaiyuan in the Tang to our Song, all abbeys serving as Investigator temples have evolved from shrines to monasteries, from monasteries to palaces—jade halls and gem chambers arrayed like clouds and stars. Their illustrious names and honorific titles, bestowed in due order, have made them the grandest sights under Heaven. Yet, the Three Clarities had no hall of their own. Minister Xiong Shouzhong, who oversees the abbey’s affairs, deemed this contrary to the principle of repaying the origin and returning to the beginning. Thus, before the Perfected Lord’s hall, he erected a grand pavilion to enshrine them. The project spanned eight years before its completion. Magnificent and towering, it befits the teachings and laws. The Thearch precedes, the ministers follow; the divine ranks are solemn and reverent. The rites are complete, and the Dao is in harmony.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s numinous power is renowned throughout the world. Since our imperial house crossed the river southward, Mount Lu has been esteemed alongside the Five Peaks. For all matters of the two frontiers, prayers are offered here; in years of flood or drought, none fail to dance in supplication. We wish to inscribe this in metal and stone, to exalt the Supreme Thearch’s glory, to extol the Son of Heaven’s beneficence, and to proclaim it for ten thousand generations.\n\nMy family has dwelt at the foot of Mount Lu for generations. Now, by fortune, I serve in the forbidden forest, and it is my duty to take up my brush in song and praise. With bowed head and reverent obeisance, I record these events and offer a poem:\n\nThe splendor of Mount Lu,\nRises beside the Dipper,\nVies with Mount Heng,\nAnd guards the southeast.\nThe people gaze upon it,\nThe gods and Heaven dwell there.\nAuspicious dreams of old,\nArose in ancient days.\n\nSolemn is Heaven, all-hearing,\nCompassionate to the people below.\nFearing some may go unheard,\nIt seeks those who serve as its ears.\nThe gods govern this,\nClouds harnessed, winds bridled.\nThey survey and investigate,\nTraversing the world.\nSwift without haste,\nClear without scrutiny.\nHeaven speaks not,\nYet the people groan not—\nThis is the court of blessings.\n\nSuccessive sages revered and worshipped,\nBestowing abundant grace.\nResponse follows feeling,\nOur sagely lord shines bright.\nWith one heart,\nHe is present though unseen.\nWho dares not revere?\nThe precious painting, the golden plaque,\nThe illustrious title, the luminous edict.\nSun and moon are its banners,\nMountains and rivers gleam.\n\nThe profound hall stands behind,\nThe new pavilion before,\nAs the lord presides and ministers look up.\nWith timely robes and sashes,\nThey gather at the imperial court.\nConveying the people’s sentiments,\nThey succor our sagely lord.\nThe people revere our lord,\nBoundless as Heaven.\nHeaven protects our Song,\nWith descendants a thousandfold.\nThe people bow in reverence,\nWishing the canon to endure.\nThe attending ministers inscribe these words,\nTo perpetuate its glorious renown.\n\n*Record of the Abbey*\nIn the year *jiayin* of the Jiading era, on the Clear and Bright Festival, the Feathered Being Bai Yuchan of the Linghuo Cave Heaven in Fuzhou, having burned incense, respectfully presented himself beneath the Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Censorate. Shortly after, Prefect Chen Zhihe offered him sweet wine. When I arrived at Yuhua, drunk and disheveled, I departed without delay. The Daoist ministers Chen Shoumo and Chen Ruyi were dispatched to request a composition to record the abbey. How could I refuse?\n\nThe text reads:\nJiangzhou, an ancient prefecture,\nMount Lu, eternal,\nIs a grotto-heaven where immortals chant truths,\nA divine palace where purple radiance shines.\nJade courts and gem chambers\nLie hidden amid crimson cliffs and emerald walls;\nFeathered robes and rainbow skirts\nBlend with the black ox and white deer.\nGibbons cry in jade ravines,\nCranes call in

banquets of Weiyu and Kuocang.\nJade flowers bloom in full,\nCrimson phoenixes alight on the Five Elders’ Peak;\nThe jade well runs deep and cold,\nWhite dragons surge from the Three Gorges’ waters.\nPines are ancient, stones strange,\nGirding the Nine Bends and embracing Luofou;\nBamboo is old, grasses numinous,\nHub to the Three Maos and nave to Great Di.\n\nGazing northward to Purple Ultimate,\nWestward twining with Green City.\nThis realm converges Chu and Hao,\nIts stars aligned with Han and Jiao.\nSpirits profit, ghosts carve—\nThree hundred sixty peaks in all;\nMountains gaunt, streams chill—\nEighty-four thousand sighs in one night.\n\nIn Zhou times, Kangzi wore the thunder-seal amid the woods;\nIn Jin dynasty, Xu Jingyang sailed his iron boat atop the trees.\nLiu Yue concealed Red City within stone,\nIts double gates congealing purple gold;\nDong Feng planted crimson apricots east of the stream,\nA thousand dawns ascending to the azure vault.\nCai and Li

traces of ancient sages.\nClearing silver-cinnabar webs of snails,\nGathering moss-covered steles of grass and stone.\n\nI long to wield the oak-branch brush,\nTo inscribe the jade palace’s chronicle.\n\nIn the nineteenth year of Kaiyuan under Illustrious August,\nOn the twenty-first day of mid-autumn,\nA specially dispatched envoy of earnest devotion\nRenewed the temple of visitation and inquiry.\nTracing its origins,\nHe laid its true foundation.\n\nThe Zhaoyang Treasure Precinct—\nGolden echoes startled the waking dream;\nThe Divine Empyrean Heavenly Lord—\nJade steeds bore him home as dawn neared.\nWithin the Numinous Talisman Palace,\nAt early court he leaned on his desk to address the ministers;\nBefore the Hanyuan Hall,\nCloud-cranes wheeled in the sky, illuminating the eight directions.\n\nA thousand banners, ten thousand pennants—\nRainbow standards and phoenix canopies unfurled in crystalline mist;\nThree crowns, nine streamers—\nWind-horses and cloud-chariots scattered flower-rain.\nThe Five Hundred Pearl Clerks of Supreme Clarity\nGrasped the Azure Dragon’s tally of martial oversight;\nThe Four-Six Jade Immortals of Grand Tenuity\nHeld the Golden Tiger’s seal of flying clouds.\n\nTwelve Stream Maidens rode jade turtles and mounted golden whales;\nEighteen River Spirits guided brocade dragons and sat on emerald conches.\nThe Three Officials wielded registers,\nCollating the charts of heaven, earth, mountains, and seas;\nThe Six Dings brandished halberds,\nGuarding the records of sun, moon, and stars.\n\nTo the left, the Dharma-Protecting Abbey; to the right, the Law-Guarding Hall—\nFrost-crossed blades of gold and iron;\nBefore, flying Liaos; behind, extending essences—\nSun-glinting tusked banners.\nThe Four Marshals flourished their batons,\nDriving the hosts of Thunder Lords and Lightning Mothers;\nThe Five Peaks unfurled their standards,\nRousing the ranks of Wind Earls and Rain Masters.\n\nThe Nine Provinces’ Community Lords bore the books of altars and city gods;\nThe Eight Seas’ Dragon Lords presented the canons of dragons, serpents, fish, and turtles.\nThe Registrar of Destiny flanked the imperial carriage,\nAttending the forbidden chariot.\nFlutes and drums resounded in the void—\nNine suites of the Celestial Hook’s coiffed maidens;\nReed pipes and jade flutes, kingfisher plumes—\nThe third watch of the palace’s sinking clepsydra.\n\nWind carried the pipa’s notes—\nPalace maidens leaned by hibiscus, straining to hear;\nDew chilled the chestnut’s rustle—\nImmortal consorts danced with peonies, offering toasts.\nDrifting mists and rosy clouds\nComposed melodies beyond the strange and dark;\nFaintly, the imperial sash’s tassels—\nVoices carried before the kingfisher canopies.\n\nCompared to ascending the Great Clarity’s Primal Heaven,\nTo receive the kalpa from the Five Numinous Emperors in person—\nThe Elder stabilizes Shu,\nThe Dark Mandate governs its unfolding.\n\nHere, at the northwest corner of Kanglu,\nI establish the Court of the Nine Heavens’ Investigation.\nAfter seventeen generations,\nThe valley’s slaughter will be profound;\nWithin a day or two,\nThe foundation’s nanmu will be

mountain,\nand in the Tang, Lü Dongbin passed through the mountain, met Zhongli, and received the transmission of the elixir spoon—\nlater, they ascended together as immortals.\n\nDuring the Shaosheng era, the wheel-bound Master Du Kuang composed *The Encounter with the Immortal: The Tale of Master Hu of the Primordial Perfected*.\nMaster Hu was a Daoist of the Palace of Great Peace and Prosperous Nation—\nthe palace being the Bureau of Inspection for the Nine Heavens,\nresiding on the northern slope of Mount Lu.\nSaints and sages dwelled together,\nconcealment and manifestation unfathomable.\n\nMaster Hu’s name was Yongzong.\nOnce, when he served as the mountain’s Daoist overseer,\na Daoist named Hui arrived,\nwearing a Huayang azure silk cap,\ndressed in Kaiyuan-era Chongxuan robes,\na sash of flying-cloud dark damask,\nshoes of winter-snow white silk,\nhandsome brows and beard, a plump face,\ngreen temples and a high nose bridge,\nblue eyes and a square jaw,\nhis bearing majestic, his spirit radiant.\nHe passed through the palace—\nnone invited him in.\nOnly Master Hu welcomed him with a cup of tea.\nThereafter, they conversed and laughed freely.\nThe Daoist pointed to his gourd and tapped his chest,\nasking for wine to pour—\na single gourd never emptied,\na hundred cups still remained.\nFrom dawn to dusk,\nthey drank without becoming drunk.\nHe then invited Master Hu to drink at his lodging,\npreparing fresh sugar and minced delicacies.\nMaster Hu declined, citing the lateness of the hour,\nwhereupon the Daoist Hui lifted his beard in a long laugh and departed.\n\nThe palace lay a league from the city.\nThe next day, Master Hu paid a visit to the prefect,\nbut the city gates remained locked.\nThe Daoist Hui emerged from the city,\nlaughing as he exchanged glances with Master Hu before leaving.\nThe assembled officials said:\n\"At midnight, Daoist Hui had already waited at the gate for some time.\"\nMaster Hu’s heart marveled at the man.\n\nYears later, clad in tattered robes and a broken hat,\na hemp belt and straw sandals,\nhe called himself a \"guest of the Great Song,\"\nknocking at Master Hu’s secluded courtyard,\nshouldering two jugs of wine.\nHe showed Master Hu—\nboth were yellow and white substances.\nHe took broken silver to buy wine and food.\nThey drank until the sun’s rays slanted,\nthen used an iron knife to scrape the earth,\ndraining the dregs to rinse his mouth,\nmixing the soil into ink.\nHe cast it onto the table—\nit rang with a clear sound.\nMaster Hu, drunk, reclined on his couch,\nwhile the guest brushed his sleeves and vanished.\n\nThe chamber filled with an extraordinary fragrance, rich and lingering for days. The knife turned golden in hue, and people rushed to purchase it. He ground the ink with wine and consumed half of it, whereupon his long-standing ailments vanished at once. Master Hu, though nearing seventy, bore the complexion of a maiden, and his capacity for wine remained boundless—truly an extraordinary encounter with the Eight Immortals.\n\nAs for the two characters \"Great Song,\" when pronounced swiftly, they form the word *Dong*; the two scenes (*er chang*) compose the character *Lü*; and the \"guest\" (*ke*) signifies \"guest\" (*bin*). Thus, the meeting with Lü Dongbin becomes clear.\n\nFrom that time onward, Master Hu gradually wearied of the mortal world. One day, he left behind a poem and shed his earthly form, departing. Where once he had mixed ink, five springs suddenly welled forth. Left Minister Wang, passing by, named it *Ink Immortal Spring*. Vice Minister Song Bofu and the Left Minister both composed verses in response, with lines such as:\n\n*\"Green ointment exchanged for a youthful face returned,\nWhite hair needs no yellow essence to brush away.\"*\n\nGrand Preceptor Cao Xun of Qiao Commandery and the Perfected Man of Pure Emptiness, Huangfu Tan, reported these events to the Hall of Virtuous Longevity, where Emperor Gaozong marveled deeply at them.\n\nMaster Hu’s former residence, once called *Hall of the Encounter with Immortals*, was renamed *Ink Bestowal Hall*. Its storied pavilions and layered eaves teemed with an auspicious aura. An ancient well and cold spring gleamed jade-green in all seasons. Wondrous indeed—the strange affair of Mount Lu! Thus, it is recorded here to supplement the annals of immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Local Deity’s Ancestral Hall**\n\nThe Chen clan traces its origins to the lofty Gao, its branches flowing like a spring. The Marquis of Qu Ni assisted the Duke of Pei in pacifying the Guanzhong region, ultimately achieving the office of Chancellor. From then on, their generations flourished, their descendants shining brightly, ennobled in life and venerated in death through ancestral halls for generations.\n\nIn ancient times, a branch of the clan migrated from Yingyang to Fujian and Guangdong, becoming a great lineage. The Marquis of Meichuan, surnamed Chen, was a man of the Jin dynasty, with his temple established in the Plum Blossom Forest of South Mountain. He once ceded land to form the Grotto Palace of Immortal Origins. The Marquis of Putian in the ancient Wurong Commandery, also surnamed Chen and of the Jin dynasty, had his temple at the Phoenix Pavilion Post in Hu Mountain, likewise ceding land to establish the Grotto Palace of Pure Origins. Others, such as the Marquis of Gaizhu in Fusha and the Spiritually Manifest Marquis of Linzhang, were also of the Chen clan. The number of their ancestral halls in famous mountains and great rivers is beyond reckoning.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, the Reclusive Lord of the Temple, surnamed Chen (his given name unknown, though some say it was Boshi), lived in seclusion on Kang Mountain, annotating the *Records of the Grand Historian* and circulating it throughout the world. Though summoned by imperial decree, he refused to appear, and was later appointed Gentleman for Literary Composition. His family produced scholars and officials for generations. After settling before the Peak of Sagely Rule, during the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang once spent the night at Zhaoyang Palace. At dawn, he ascended the Hall of Numinous Radiance and twice beheld the envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Inspectors. Receiving the emperor’s decree, he instructed the Chen family to establish a temple in the northwest corner of Mount Lu, entrusting the prefect of Jiangzhou, Du Gu Zhengshu, with its oversight. Five individuals, including Meng Xianzhen, were appointed to tend its incense and flame.\n\nBefore this, the site had been neglected, unknown to all. One day, a figure robed in starry splendor and trailing rosy clouds arrived at Chen’s gate, declaring: *\"The Primordial August Emperor has dispatched Yuan Yi, Envoy of the Azure Waters, bearing the banner of the Nine Standards and Five Spirits, to inspect the registers of life and death, withering and flourishing across the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths. Today, the Son of Heaven has personally sought the envoy’s counsel, desiring to build the Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Censor on Mount Lu, that its blessings may extend to the common people five hundred years hence. I deem your dwelling—a jade ravine cradling the moon, a celestial abyss mirroring the sky—a truly sublime site. You should cede this land to lay the temple’s foundation. In your next life, you shall serve as an attendant of the terrace, presiding over this mountain and receiving offerings in perpetuity.\"*\n\nChen assented. The Daoist left, vanishing in an instant. Later, a sudden thunderclap and violent wind relocated Chen’s dwelling to the left of the palace, where its site became the temple. After its completion, Chen shed his mortal form and became the eternal local deity of this place.\n\nThereafter, his descendants moved to Changle Village in De’an County. Over time, they branched out to a separate estate on Ding Mountain, twice receiving the imperial commendation of *Righteous Household* during our dynasty. Thus, the former residence to the left of the palace became the site of the local deity’s incense and flame.\n\nThe state temple was later renamed a palace, and among the Chen clan, some rode turtles to ascend the isles of immortals, others plucked orchids, entered the Hanlin Academy, or aged by the fishing platform. The sound of recitation rang clear, the jingle of hairpins and girdle ornaments resounded, their gates and halls stood grandly, and their banners and inscriptions shone resplendently—magnificent indeed!\n\nTheir descendant Chen Zhuo, riding a blue steed and spurring a yellow crane, entrusted the annual duties of the palace gate to the Daoist Xiang Dexin. He gathered funds, casting them into a cauldron to mold ten divine statues and construct a six-bay temple hall with two gates and two passageways. Green eaves congealed with mist, vermilion corridors bathed in moonlight. Wind chimes beneath the eaves echoed in succession, while lamps shone brightly even at noon. Flowers wove a brocade across the earth, and jade foundations bore moss.\n\nCanopied jewel-enshrined curtains draped the pavilions, jade censers wafted fragrance through the halls. Gold and azure dazzled the eye, vermilion and purple startled the beholder. The radiance of their majestic power seemed as though they could speak, so keen and upright were they—unchanged from ancient times to the present.\n\nThis was all initiated by Du Daoshu of Shuxi, former supervisor of the palace. In former times, Master Jin of Xiaoyao Mountain had yielded his dwelling to Xu Jingsun in retreat; Master Sun of Tongwu Mountain had yielded his dwelling to Ge Taiji; and the two Chens of Min had likewise ceded their land to establish a grotto-palace. In this, the Recluse Chen of Kang Mountain was no different. Though the Recluse has passed, his spirit endures through the ages. Surely he could refine the lead of the nine heavens and six earths, gather the mercury of the three shocks and four marshlands, and cultivate the Dao of flight and transformation. If he does not become a pure and numinous soul, then his ascent to immortality is not far—how could he be merely a god?\n\nFor the term \"god,\" the *Book of Changes* states: \"That which is vast and unfathomable is called *shen* (spirit).\" The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: \"It is not spirit, yet its spirit is what makes it spirit.\" The *Book of Transformation* further states: \"The myriad spirits are one spirit.\" If the Recluse can attain this spirit, then he may tread the realm of Yuan Yi, ascend the homeland of Yuan Shi, and share the same breath and dwelling as the Perfected Lord of Visitation—how could mere temple offerings confine such a Recluse? The Recluse is a divine being. This is my humble declaration.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Reconstruction of the Local Deity’s Shrine**\n\nWhen the Perfected Lord was dispatched on his visitation mission, he stationed his banner at Mount Lu—this is well-documented. Yet the origins of the local deity, Master Chen, who donated his residence to establish the palace, are even more divine.\n\nTracing ancient accounts: since the imperial numen manifested in broad daylight during the Kaiyuan era, the Son of Heaven sought a fitting place to honor the spirits, but none met his approval. At the foot of the sacred mountain, the Recluse Chen had made his home—a land of fine mountains and waters. One day, a fangshi knocked at his gate, subtly suggesting he relocate. Chen assented without hesitation, and though his strength was insufficient, that very night a storm raged like thunder, yet his house stood unshaken. At dawn, his entire household had already moved south. Thus, the divine office bestowed treasures, and laborers flocked to toil. They channeled the streams to form ponds, raised beams like clouds and rainbows. From shrine to mansion, mansion to abbey, abbey to palace, the halls of the Perfected multiplied daily, and wondrous realms expanded beyond human design.\n\nIn truth, though this grand vision may seem as though heaven and earth had opened it, it was all conceived within the Recluse’s own mind. Ordinary people, confined to their doors and windows, know nothing beyond their walls. Unable to bear their own discomfort, how could they care for the welfare of future generations? Yet the Recluse relinquished his ancestral estate to plead for the lives of the people, sacrificing his beloved home to secure blessings for the next five hundred years. His lofty vision and noble resolve soar beyond the clouds. If even rustic elders were to witness this, could they not but be struck with awe? He is truly worthy to preside over this mountain, and his incense fire shall endure as long as the palace’s.\n\nIn the year *qimeng* of the *Dayuanxian* cycle, the Daoist abbey was destroyed by war, and the calamity extended to the deity’s shrine. Once order was restored, reconstruction began, and the following year, it was completed. Zhou Deyi, supervisor of the palace, and Zhou Chengyuan, deputy director, requested a record of its rise and fall.\n\nI have heard that since the Recluse moved his family, his lineage has been passed down without clear records. Those fond of such matters often append genealogies to his name, but only an ancient stele, inscribed by Lü Zhixin (supervisor of the palace), depicts the first descent of the image. The inscription notes: \"This is the present *qianbu*.\" Later generations have claimed him as part of my clan. Yet wars and fires have repeatedly ravaged our family, leaving no intact records. I dare not presume to exalt him as the Duke of Fengyang, but even without my ancestors’ testimony, the Recluse’s virtue should still be recorded—how much more so with Lü’s stele as evidence? Thus, I write this.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era of the *Dingchou* year, recorded by Chen Youzong, a mountain dweller of Shidian. The colophon was inscribed by Wu Meng, the Mountain Spring Recluse.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer Tablet for the Reconstruction of the Local Deity’s Shrine**\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, the year *bingzi*, on the third day of the third lunar month (the day *wuchen* of the first month), the following were respectfully announced to the Enlightened Prefecture and the Great King of Manifest Response, the Local Deity Chen:\n\nThe Perfected Lord, dispatched to inspect Mount Lu, arrived in person and declared: \"By yielding this land, you shall receive divine protection.\" With these words, he vanished.\n\nPresiding over the palace: Zhou Deyi, supervisor and overseer; Zhou Chengyuan, deputy director; Wu Yonghuai, co-supervisor and manager; along with the gatekeepers and the Daoist assembly.\n\nAmidst the nocturnal rush of thunder and lightning, the spring slumber remained undisturbed, and the divine workings of the deity’s abode at the southern foothills continued unbroken. Here, the shrine received its due offerings, and blessings extended near and far. From the Tang through the Song, five hundred years passed in succession. Yet when the Jianyan rebels surged along the river and the *yang*-nine calamity struck, the palace halls were reduced to ashes, and weeds choked the ruins.\n\nSoon after, the dynasty revived, restoring what had collapsed and reviving what had been abandoned. Baskets and trowels renewed the shrine, and incense and flame returned as before. Since the Southern Crossing, the temple halls have been rebuilt time and again, their morning rites as constant as the plow’s labor—all through the deity’s aid.\n\nWho could have foreseen that in the year *yihai*, the shrine would again suffer ruin? The appointed time drew near, and without the deity’s power, all would wither. Heaven and earth upended, the suffering grew unbearable: granaries lay empty, all means exhausted, grain scarce, lives hanging by a thread. A hundred wounds, a thousand gashes—far beyond the trials of years past. Old debts remained unpaid, and new ones mounted. Day and night, there was no respite, no place to honor the divine presence.\n\nUndeterred by our own inadequacy, we resolved to prop up the void with empty hands. By good fortune, the *dānapati* generously offered their joyful alms, and the new shrine took shape, restored to its former site. As completion nears, we rely wholly on the deity’s protection. On this auspicious day, coinciding with the Spring Purification, we present oxen, sheep, and wine, reverently fulfilling our original vow. Young and old gather as one to celebrate the deity’s settled abode.\n\nMay the deity’s transformative power extend to the ten directions, filling the treasuries to abundance. May the tonsured and the laity dwell together in harmony, and landlords and tenants live in mutual peace. May incense and flowers flourish—how could we forget the deity’s gifts? Partake, O Spirit, and accept our offering.\n\nIn the sixteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, the cyclical year *jimao*, on the first day of the seventh month, *bingwu*, and the sixth day, *xinhai*, the Venerable Master Tongmiao Chongzhen, Commissioner of Daoist Affairs for Jiangzhou Prefecture and Supervisor of All Palaces and Observatories, along with the Abbot of Taiping Xingguo Palace, Zhou Deyi; the Venerable Master Mingsu Ninghe, Registrar of Daoist Affairs for Jiangzhou Prefecture and Director of Taiping Xingguo Palace, Zhou Chengyuan; the Venerable Master Mingbudao, Vice-Director of Jiangzhou Prefecture and Deputy Director of Taiping Xingguo Palace, Liu Zongchuan; and the gatekeepers, administrators, and Daoist assembly of the palace, now reverently proclaim to the Enlightened Court:\n\nLord Chen of the Earth, the Great King of Manifest Response—\nThe deity, bearing numinous power upon this mountain, has long bestowed protection upon the palace halls. From afar and near, all rejoice, and blessings extend to the people’s livelihood. Since the sacred revolution of the Shengyuan era, the ancestral shrine has undergone transformations. With measured timber and rebuilt structures, completion was achieved after five years. How splendid the soaring halls, resplendent in vermilion and azure! The steps and terraces stand solemn, the gates and paths laid smooth. The scale is vast and unmatched—none can rival it. All this arises from the deity’s transformation; how could mere mortals achieve it?\n\nOn this auspicious day and hour, we reverently install the deity’s presence. With fragrant tea, sacrificial beasts, and fine wine, we present offerings in vessels of wood and bronze. May the deity, present as if in person, witness our humble sincerity. May the true spirit’s incense and flame aid the revival of the Dao. May the tonsured and the laity dwell together in peace, each safeguarding their well-being. May pestilence vanish and granaries overflow. In seasonal rites, how dare we forget to repay the deity’s grace? Partake, O Spirit, and accept our offering.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Traveling Palace of the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Investigative Authority**\n\nThose who speak well of the Way of Heaven stop at spontaneity. Yet its oversight is called \"Heaven’s Surveillance,\" its regard \"Heaven’s Favor,\" its perception and judgment \"Heaven’s Order.\" What Heaven returns to is this: non-action yet nothing left undone, silence yet nothing left unsaid. Spontaneity, in truth, encompasses both substance and function—it merely acts without contrivance.\n\nThe ancients understood this and revered the Way, aligning their hearts with it, assisting in its nurturing transformations, and perpetuating its blessed mandate. If one were to dismiss the Way of Heaven as distant and unattainable, consigning it to remoteness and calling it mere spontaneity, how could this be right?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and the sage-kings Yao and Shun governed the world with ease, becoming one with Heaven. Yet they never ceased inquiring of the common people, consulting the feudal lords, sharpening their vision and hearing, banishing obscurity and illuminating clarity. How could they have forgotten the world for even a day?\n\nWhen virtue declined, rulers still feared their ears and eyes were insufficiently broad. Thus, they appointed inspectors within and without, so that even distant frontiers could not escape the gates of oversight. This Investigative Palace, then, is Heaven’s own institution, and the establishment of traveling palaces is a matter of human affairs that cannot be neglected.\n\nThe Perfected Lord first manifested auspicious signs at the foot of Mount Shengzhi during the Kaiyuan era, taking residence in the former abode of the Chen clan. Thereafter, in the outskirts of Xunyang, arose the Western Slope Hermitage and the Temple of Longevity. From the shallow shoals of Zhuan to the soaring Kunlun, from the Dragon’s Ascent of Bao Creek to the Purple Yang, all were extensions of the Lord’s shrines. Along the river, rare halls and precious pavilions stood in succession.\n\nThis is not mere busyness. The shrine is called \"Investigative,\" for it serves as Heaven’s supervisory office. The hidden and remote must be illuminated, good and evil meticulously distinguished. Thus, those entrusted with governance under the Investigative Authority must not fail in their duty of benevolent nurture; those who propagate the teachings must not fail in their care for the people. As subjects and children, they must fulfill their loyalty to rulers and filial piety to parents, lest they betray the covering and bearing of Heaven. Only then may they face the divine and avoid transgression.\n\nOtherwise, with Heaven’s luminous gaze above, not even a hair’s breadth escapes scrutiny. Fortune and misfortune are decided here—how dare we not revere?\n\nThe significance of this Daoist institution far surpasses that of ordinary temples and incense offerings. Reflecting upon the twin-zhong prefecture—though distant by a hundred li from the sagely governance—its sole branch shrine appears meager compared to those of other regions. The Zhou clan of Cui Lu stands as the foremost family of the prefecture. Among them, Zhou Shu, styled Gongshu, is himself a paragon of the lineage. Having once suffered the ravages of war, his household was left with no survivors. Though he sought an heir far and wide, none was found.\n\nHe pondered: even those who fulfill the common duties of human relationships may lament that not all descendants are worthy. Should misfortune leave one without posterity, the choice of an heir must still prioritize virtue—yet such decisions often remain unresolved for years, difficult to settle. How much more so in my case, where upheaval has left me an impoverished elder, each day uncertain? To seek some infant merely to secure my own survival would be a grave miscalculation. All that my ancestors have painstakingly accumulated—every ounce and inch—would be cast aside lightly. How could my heart find solace in this?\n\nI must inwardly examine my conscience: if my actions can be established before Heaven and Earth, attested to by spirits and gods, and thus align with the aspirations of my ancestors, then even if the matter bends to necessity, how dare I demand it fully conform to worldly conventions? Now, the Investigative Traveling Shrine remains an absent institution in our prefecture. I wish to expand its scope so that my family’s ancestral rites may rely upon the sacred incense of the divine, enduring without end—thus ensuring my ancestors are not left without support.\n\nHaving consulted with Zhou Deyi, Supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey affairs on Mount Lu, and Zhou Chengyuan, the Abbey’s Director and Daoist Registrar, I now pledge several qing of fields, along with the estate and its structures; several mu of land, where the ancestral graves lie. I shall name the estate \"Cui Lu,\" erect an Investigative Traveling Hall, and construct beside it a Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel and images of the various sages. The Zhou clan’s ancestral shrine will be adjoined to its eastern side.\n\nEach year, officials shall appoint a Daoist of upright and pure conduct from the abbey to oversee its affairs. In the highest sense, this will allow the offering of splendid prayers to serve as the sagely lord and parent of the people, beseeching Heaven for an enduring mandate. Next, it will emulate the odes of Lu, aiding the worthy ministers who assist the age and guide the people, gathering blessings and prolonging years. The sacred title \"Responsive to the Primordial, Guardian of Destiny, Divine Transformation Manifesting Harmony\" serves as its proof. Further, it will provide a means for my ancestors from the generations of my great-grandfather onward to listen to the Dharma and hear the scriptures, ascending the steps from the mundane to the sagely. Still further, it will enable the villages and communities of my prefecture to daily cultivate meritorious deeds and annually secure abundant harvests. The sacred prophecy that \"five hundred years hence, blessings shall extend to all living beings\" likewise reflects this purpose. If my ancestors possess awareness, how could they not feel profound solace and exultant joy in the unseen realm?\n\nAll who heard this approved, and it was reported to the prefectural and county authorities, who issued written deeds. This occurred on a day in the sixth month of the thirteenth year of the Zhiyuan era. The income from that year’s rent was set aside to fund the shrine’s construction. Before its completion, my uncle passed away from illness at the age of seventy-five. He had previously recounted these events in full and left instructions requesting a record. Though I, Youzong, was not yet well-acquainted with my uncle, I am familiar with his affairs, and so I inscribe this broad outline, declaring to all: the origins of this estate’s dedication are as stated above.\n\nObserving his own account, one sees that within a single text, he repeatedly expressed concern for ancestral rites, the provision of blessings to the departed, and the care of graves. Entrusting the continuation of his aspirations and the fulfillment of his undertakings to those beyond the secular world is no light matter. A single word uttered carries weight across both seen and unseen realms, greatly influencing the living. Having entrusted this to such a person in life, in death he will likewise petition the divine. If the petition is granted, then he will have not only fulfilled my uncle’s commission but also borne the charge of the Supreme Perfected. How should one who values solemn promises plan and act?\n\nThe management must be thorough and meticulous, and the entrusted must be chosen for their prudence and integrity. Following the abbey’s established regulations, they shall oversee the Zhou clan’s ancestral rites, ensuring the sacred incense endures without end—thus rendering my uncle immortal in spirit.\n\nRecorded and inscribed on the Clear and Bright Festival of the seventeenth year of the Zhiyuan era by Layman Chen Youzong of Shidiao. Prefectural Governor and Prefect of Jiangzhou Circuit, Yang Renfeng of Yamen, affixed the seal.\n\n**Record of the Construction of Taiping Xingguo Abbey**\n\nXunyang stands as a key stronghold of Jiangnan, while Mount Lu is the famed mountain of Deyang. It was once ascended by the Great Yu, who carved his inscriptions upon its stone; the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han likewise commemorated their achievements there. The records of these events are clear and abundant—no other mountain can compare.\n\nWithin its peaks, the abodes of Daoists and Buddhists are too numerous to count, yet Taiping Xingguo Abbey alone has gained renown through the numinous dream of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Perfected Lords. Since the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, when the emperor received an oracular revelation and bestowed the utmost reverence, he commanded Wu Daozi to paint the deity’s likeness and ordered Du Guzheng to erect a shrine. Miraculously, the timber required for construction replenished itself as it was used—an event that struck all who heard of it as extraordinary.\n\nFrom the Tang dynasty onward, through countless dynastic changes and the shifting of forests and valleys, the site has transformed from a prefectural temple to an abbey. Though it has known rise and decline, the numinosity of the Perfected Lord has endured unwaning. The higher its veneration has grown, the deeper the devotion of the people below—how could any other deity compare?\n\nIn the year *yihai*, as the realm was unified under one rule, the markets of Jiujiang thrived unaltered, and all lived in peace. Yet the abbey lay somewhat distant from the city, and its distance did not spare it from disturbances. The abbey’s overseer, Zhou Deyi, and his deputy, Zhou Chengyuan, were moved by sorrow at the sight of its ruined halls and overgrown fields. They longed to restore it but lacked the means.\n\nAt that time, Left Minister Lü Gongshi held high office. When they brought their plight to him, he promptly provided grain and lent oxen for plowing, enabling them to gather Daoist followers and revive the old estate. Within three years, the rent income gradually recovered. Thus, what had fallen was raised, what had collapsed was rebuilt, and halls, corridors, and chambers were all renewed at once.\n\nThere was a gentleman of Huxi named Zhou Shushu who devoted his entire family fortune to the upkeep of the sacred incense. Some of the abbey’s front fields had been seized by powerful families, but these too were reclaimed. From then on, the abbey’s resources grew abundant, its Daoist community expanded, and the sound of bells and chimes rang daily. When envoys from the ninefold court descended to offer incense from east and west, all who passed by raised their hands to their brows in reverence. The abbey’s transformation delighted both gods and men.\n\nThis was surely the result of the single-minded devotion of the two Zhou gentlemen. Yet had Minister Lü not shown compassion at the outset, how could they have accomplished such a feat?\n\nIn the early years of the Jianyan era, the abbey was once destroyed. The Great Master of the Dao, Zhou Fuxian, swept its ruins and restored it anew. The two gentlemen today are his close descendants, and their connection to this mountain runs deep. As I travel the four quarters, I often lament the countless grand undertakings that have crumbled into ruin, beyond hope of revival. Is it truly that their circumstances made restoration impossible?\n\nFor the most part, those above and below drift heedlessly, without a thought of compassion. Consider Mount Qian and Mount Qingcheng—both, like the Perfected Lord, once manifested numinous power in the same era. Yet in the aftermath of war, neither has been restored to its former state. How could one not feel moved by this?\n\nFor nine years, my prayers in exile have never failed to find response. Though lingering delays have kept me from returning to my former retreat, I come to the abbey each year to prepare incense and pay my respects. When the two gentlemen asked me to record these events, I could not refuse. Here, then, is a brief account for future generations to consult. As for the mundane details of construction, they are not noted here.\n\nIn the eighteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, cyclical year *xinsi*, eighth month, day *jiazi*, written with reverence by Nian Rong, Gentleman for Fulfilling Service and Director of the Jiangnan Zixi Academy. The title inscription was engraved by Li Bingyi, Grand Master for Consultation and Prefect of Changde Circuit, concurrently serving as Prefect.\n\n*Record of the New Estate of Taiping Abbey*\nThis stele for the Hall of the Perfected Lord was composed based on the materials he provided. Later, when illness compelled his return, he remained at the abbey for a month. Some details, as told secondhand, differed from what he had witnessed himself, so corrections were made. Yet even after the inscription was carved in red and set into stone, one omission remained: originally, the fields measured no more than three thousand *mu*; now, they exceed ten thousand. If one were to combine the old and new holdings, the total would be otherwise—but under the supervision of Master Tang, the *Chongjing Zhenchang Ningmiao* Daoist, who oversees the abbey and records Daoist affairs for Jiangzhou Circuit, the current holdings alone amount to eleven thousand *mu*.\n\nThe abbey’s resources derive from three sources: commercial exchange, donations, and manual labor. I marvel at the steadfastness of their purpose and the extent of their personal toil. Lacking the means to make their deeds known to the world, I offer this record.\n\nAlas, how could one know? Let us survey the abbeys’ manors and their lands in their respective locations, and trace the names of those who made donations—from the most generous to the least. Now, the greatest income from commercial exchange amounts to three thousand six hundred and fifty *mu*, with Shimen alone contributing one thousand two hundred and eighty as the largest share. Those falling short of this are: Qishi, two hundred and eighty; Jinxī, seven hundred and fifty; Shitang, nine hundred and ten; Longgang, nine hundred and sixty; and Shanglongxī, one thousand two hundred and thirty. Of these, only Qishi lies in Xingguo’s Daye, while the rest belong to Jiang’s Dehua.\n\nThe most generous donors number five thousand three hundred and fifty, with Cuilu contributing two thousand two hundred as the largest. Gao’an follows with half that amount, Yuanshan with one thousand two hundred, Wan’an with one thousand seven hundred, Fuxing with one thousand seven hundred and forty, and Zhao Chen with two thousand one hundred. Of these, only Gao’an lies in Yongxing of Xingguo, and Yuanshan in Huangmei of Xin; their former patrons were Li Jiansun and Xiang Zhida. The rest belong to Jiang’s subordinate counties: Cuilu to Hukou, Wan’an to Dean, Fuxing to Pengze, and Zhao Chen to Ruichang. Their patrons—Zhou Shu, Hu Rong, and Lü Shishan—are the same as those recorded on the stele of the Assistant Prefect of Fuzhou Circuit, alongside Qi Yongnian.\n\nAs for manual labor, four tea terraces were opened in Dehua County, named Yixing Manor, comprising forty-two levels in all. Additionally, two thousand *mu* of fields were reclaimed. Five hermitages were first established: three before the abbey—East Taiping, West Taiping, and Ziyuan—and two behind—Yongcui and Gufeng. Initially, all were overgrown with reeds and brambles, grazing grounds for the common folk. Workers were hired to clear the land with axes and hoes, and from the heights, pines, cedars, parasol trees, and tea plants were gathered by seed and sapling, then transplanted in orderly rows. Ginger and taro were planted, along with yams and water chestnuts where rice could not grow. The profits from these were granted to the workers to encourage those who had not yet joined. Having heard of this, I traveled by sedan chair to see for myself. The earliest projects began five years ago, the most recent just a year past. Yet already, the trees spread across the hills, and though the undergrowth is dense, new life sprouts vigorously. The oldest trees now stand tall as men, soon to number in the tens of thousands. Those still in rows, undivided, fill the fields. Bamboo shoots are pruned without harming their roots, and baskets of soil, carried from other mountains, are beyond counting—doubly so, one might imagine. Beneath them, bamboo shoots already cluster, though the groves are not yet fully grown.\n\nMaster Tang ascended a high mound and pointed to the abbey’s groves, saying: “I have heard that the mountains of old were once as overgrown as this. The timber we use now was laid down by our predecessors. There are still several *li* of untamed mountains that could be cleared. If Heaven grants me years enough to persist, perhaps all may yet be opened. In a hundred years, the trees will grow thick as a man’s embrace, providing future generations with the means to maintain the abbey. Then my life in this world will not have been in vain.”\n\nI replied: “Ah! Your words echo the ancient adage, ‘What others discard, I take’—the essence of true wealth. With such a heart, what task cannot be accomplished, what merit cannot be gathered? It is no wonder people are stirred to action, offering what they love, fearing only that their donations may come too late. Otherwise, those fields belong to their own households, on which the people depend for their livelihood. Even a foot of cloth or a peck of rice, given as alms, would be clung to for a time, accepted with reluctance and gratitude before parting. How much more so for fields stretching across *qian* and *mo*, worth perhaps a thousand gold, with no expectation of repayment, cast aside like goose down? Only one who has truly won their hearts could achieve this.”\n\nHaving dwelt on this for some time, I further learned of his plans to propagate the abbey’s teachings among the masses.\n\nThe Daoist followers never entered the homes of common folk without cause. Those who brought money to gather firewood or charcoal from the mountains were all issued vouchers. Regularly, strong laborers were dispatched to patrol the forests with staves, and those who stole timber were punished. The inflow and outflow of money and grain were meticulously recorded, and even the finest details of milling—down to the last husk—were not overlooked.\n\nThe great kitchen of the public abbey daily steamed ten *hu* of rice, enough to feed a thousand people. All its disciples took their meals in the main hall, arriving always in Daoist robes to show reverence. Those who held official duties each had their own subsidiary cloisters, equipped with cauldrons and tripods, though they prepared no meals themselves, only boiling water for tea as needed. For the young servants who guarded the lodgings and those in remote hermitages several *li* away, meals were distributed daily.\n\nNo painted or sculpted images were permitted in the subsidiary cloisters; each day at dusk, the residents would go to the main abbey to pay their respects. When I asked why this was so, they replied: \"If the subsidiary cloisters grow strong, the public abbey weakens. As they daily accumulate wealth, the public abbey becomes increasingly impoverished. In its need, it will inevitably turn to the subsidiary cloisters for aid. The first request may be met, the second delayed, and by the third, the compliant may appease with kind words, while the unyielding will refuse outright. Thus, the bond between above and below gradually dissolves. Better to share both hardship and abundance, sustaining all through the public abbey’s resources—this is the only enduring way.\"\n\nAlas! Could followers of other Daoist traditions plan so far ahead? Once, in private discussion with a few confidants, we assessed him: his white beard and piercing eyes gave him the bearing of a bear or leopard, revealing strength enough to shoulder great tasks. Combined with his depth of thought, strategic mind, trustworthiness despite few words, authority tempered by harmony, sincerity, and reverence—he governed hundreds of disciples, young and old alike, with uniform discipline. Were he not devoted to the Daoist teachings, he could have served in the world as a general, commanding armies, achieving feats across ten thousand *li*. Yet now, he is but\n\nIn the ninth year of the *Dade* reign, the cyclical year *yisi*, on the day of the winter solstice, this was recorded, inscribed, and titled by Yao Sui, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel and Participant in Determining Governmental Affairs of the Jiangxi Branch Secretariat.\n\n*Record of the Facts of the Perfected Lord of Inquiry at Mount Lu’s Temple of Great Peace and National Prosperity, Scroll Six* concludes.\n\n---\n\nIn the seventh scroll, *Responsive Manifestations: Categories of Correspondence*, the text reads:\n\nThe original character in position #1 is unclear, likely *shi* (使). #2: *zai* (宰) was originally written as *xing* (幸), amended according to context. #3: *pei* (配) was originally a missing character, amended according to context. #4: *ya* (雅) was originally *zhui* (椎), amended according to context. #5: *nian* (年) was originally *ping* (平), amended according to context. #6: *gu* (顾) was originally *tou* (头), amended according to context. #7: *ci* (玼) was originally *ci* (此), amended according to context. #8: *ri* (日) was originally *mu* (目), amended according to context. #9: *yi* (邑) was originally *se* (色), amended according to context. #10: *li* (罹) was originally *wei* (惟), amended according to context. #11: *xi* (昔) was originally *zhe* (者), amended according to context. #12: *gai* (盖) was originally *he* (盍), amended according to context. #13: *jun* (君) was originally *jun* (均), amended according to Yao Sui’s *Mu’an Collection*. #14: *bei* (碑) is suspected to be redundant, deleted according to Yao Sui’s *Mu’an Collection*. #15: *ju* (举) was originally a missing character, amended according to context. #16: *qi* (耆) was originally *zhe* (者), amended according to context.\n\nYang Taiming resigned from office to study the Dao on Mount Lu. Taiming, originally a county magistrate of Chang’an, was a scholar by birth, filial to his parents, and was known as \"Filial Yang.\" He once served in Guo Ziyi’s幕府, by nature serene and indifferent to official advancement. He often advised Ziyi, saying: \"Though military governance values strictness, human life is of utmost weight—one must not kill lightly.\" Ziyi commanded troops for over twenty years, ruling with leniency and refraining from indiscriminate executions. His soldiers cherished him as a father or elder brother, all due to Taiming’s subtle counsel.\n\nIn the first year of Yongtai (765 CE), he resigned his post and came to the peaks of Mount Lu, where he built a hut. He prepared *qingjing* rice and consumed it to practice *bigu* (grain avoidance). Burning incense, he prayed to the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy, seeking the Dao of immortality. For fourteen years, he persisted. One autumn evening, the sky cleared after rain. Suddenly, at his place of morning worship, he saw a divine being in a golden crown and crimson robe, adorned with white pearl strands. Beside him stood one holding a jade axe and another bearing a jade casket.\n\nThe divine being said: \"I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy, sent to inspect human good and evil. For your lifelong merits toward the people, your pure and arduous heart, and your steadfast cultivation of the Dao, your sincerity has reached the Nine Heavens. The Three Primordial Lords of Jade Purity and Great Simplicity have commanded me to bestow upon you the *Scripture of the Great Perfected Dao of the Nine Heavens*.\" Taiming prostrated himself, kowtowing in gratitude. He slowly opened the jade casket and received the sacred text. The divine being admonished him, saying: \"Persist in diligent practice without fail. On the day your Dao is perfected, I shall summon you.\" With these words, winds and clouds surged, and the divine being vanished. Upon opening the scripture, he found it to be the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Cavern*, in thirty-nine chapters.\n\nFrom then on, Taiming followed the scripture’s practices, withdrawing from the world. For thirty-six years, he remained secluded. In the eighth year of Yuanhe (813 CE), on the first day of the first lunar month at noon, auspicious clouds descended to welcome him. Taiming ascended upon the clouds.\n\n*From* Records of Encounters with Perfected Immortals\n\nLi Yunxiang’s Merits in Medicine and the Dao\nYunxiang was a recluse of the Tang. He often said that lofty immortals and perfected beings must accumulate hidden merits to aid others and uphold precepts with precision. Thus, he devoted himself to medicine. Gifted with keen insight, he never harmed living creatures in his prescriptions, using only minerals, herbs, and plants. He transmitted ancient immortal formulas to later generations. When his methods required insects or fish as medicine, he refrained from hasty action, taking this as a caution. Later, he came to reside on Mount Lu.\n\nPatients from several prefectures filled his door, yet he accepted no gifts of silk or wealth. He abstained from desires and meat, living near the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy. Each morning, he burned incense and prayed: \"Yunxiang uses medicine to relieve the people’s suffering, seeking no profit. May I never waver in this resolve for all future lives. May the divine and numinous grant me protection.\" He lived on the mountain for over sixty years, his complexion golden and lustrous, his gaze piercing. Those who knew him attributed this to his hidden virtues.\n\nOne day, while following herb-gatherers into the depths of the mountains, he suddenly saw a man in a round cap and purple robe, his face like carved jade, his bearing majestic, his beard and brows as if painted. Yunxiang, struck by his extraordinary appearance, visited him the next morning and inquired. The man said: \"I am Gong Qingchang. My family is from Luoyang. In my youth, I met Sima Yinyuan at the foot of Mount Minggao. Yinyuan claimed to be a spirit official of the Weiyu Grotto-Heaven. Each of the Five Peaks, Four Seas, and grotto-heavens has spirit officials who assess merits and transgressions, reporting good and evil to the Court of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy. Yinyuan told me: 'In a past life, you held an important post and labored to redress grievances and exonerate the wrongfully killed. The people silently benefited from you. When Zhu Ci usurped the throne, you died for loyalty, your righteous indignation unwavering. Thus, you were reborn as a human. In time, you will awaken and recall these memories.' The Nine Heavens’ Envoy recorded your merits and commanded me to transmit to you the methods of the *Stone Essence and Golden Light Concealing Form Sword*, the *Silent Audience of the Central Yellow Great One*, by which you may transcend the world. Recently, I ascended Purple Cloud Peak to observe the *qi*, and saw demonic vapors beyond the ridge. I intended to exorcise them but passed by the mountain shrine, so I came to pay respects.\"\n\nYunxiang treated him with reverence. Qingchang instructed his attendant to fetch a zither and played melodies such as *Golden Whale Leaping the Sea*, *Raindrops on Autumn Lotuses*, *Drunken Panning the Moon*, and *White Snow Prelude*. The tones were pure and transcendent, unlike ordinary sounds. After several days of companionship, at parting, Yunxiang bowed and said: \"Fortunate to have met you, may I follow you on a southern journey?\" Qingchang replied: \"Not yet. You must still pursue an official career. In eighteen years, we shall meet at Mount Zhongtiao.\"\n\n*From* Comprehensive Records of Divine Medicines\n\nXiang Ziwen’s Encounter with Gong Qingchang\nZiwen was from Changsha. In the second year of Baoli (826 CE), he was appointed to Hengzhou but was too poor to return home. Enamored of the scenic mountains and rivers, one day, during the height of summer, he visited the Yue Temple and stayed for over ten days. Suddenly, he saw a man in a black cloth robe lined with purple, his face like polished jade, his demeanor dignified, his beard and brows as if drawn. Ziwen marveled at his extraordinary appearance. The next morning, he visited and inquired. The man said: \"I am Gong Qingchang. My family is from Luoyang. In my youth, I met Sima Yinyuan at the foot of Mount Minggao. Yinyuan claimed to be a spirit official of the Weiyu Grotto-Heaven.

The tones were pure and transcendent, unlike ordinary sounds.

You must still pursue an official career. In eighteen years, we shall meet at Mount Zhongtiao.\"\n\nZiwen bowed again, entreating instruction. Qingchang said: \"To study the Dao, first cultivate merit and conduct. When you encounter the right time and fulfill your aspirations, you must strive diligently. As for breath cultivation and alchemical ingestion, these are secondary matters.\" Ziwen pleaded repeatedly, but Qingchang replied: \"We must wait until our next meeting.\" Ziwen said: \"If there is further teaching or admonition, I vow to uphold it.\" After a long silence, Qingchang said: \"Your father and grandfather lie in temporary burial at a monastic abode, much afflicted by ghostly servitude. You should promptly select an auspicious site to complete this great matter.\" Ziwen wept and bowed in gratitude, then departed with light steps.\n\n*From* The Southern Journey of Minister Li Wen\n\n**Xu the Remonstrator Repairs the Temple with Private Funds**\nThe Remonstrator, appointed as Jiangxi Military Commissioner in the second year of the Dahe era of the Tang, used thirty thousand *min* of his own money to renovate the Lushan Temple of the Divine Envoy, commissioning artisans to apply cinnabar and bright pigments. The magistrate of Xunyang dispatched an official to oversee the work. The official entered the city to summon a painter, then returned with him, the artisan bearing pigments on his back. As they left the city gate, the official suddenly stripped off his robe and belt and cast them to the ground. The painter, suspecting drunkenness, retrieved them and followed. Soon after, the official discarded his clothes and hat. After traveling thirty *li*, he was barely clothed. Nearing the temple, a figure like a sturdy soldier, clad in black with a white leather apron, emerged from the ravine and seized the official, dragging him away. The painter cried out: \"He is merely drunk—pardon him!\" The soldier only glared, dragging the official to sit in the water. The painter then realized he was a ghost and fled in terror to alert those at the temple. When they returned together, the black-clad figure had vanished, and the official sat as before—dead. Upon reviewing the accounts, they found that half the funds had been embezzled.\n\n*From* Remnants of the Taiping Era\n\n**Liu Deben Donates Wealth to Relieve Famine**\nDeben, styled Xiaoshu, was a native of Ezhou. Skilled in many arts and fond of antiquity, he sought no official position but traveled as a merchant on the great river. In the tenth month of the sixth year of the Qianfu era of the Tang, Huang Chao captured Ezhou, causing panic along the Yangtze. Judging himself unable to return home, Deben distributed ten thousand *shi* of grain to the starving poor and took refuge on Mount Lu. One day, a Daoist with disheveled hair and a deerskin robe visited, declining to give his name. They roamed the mountain together for a year. One day, wandering to the foot of the Five Elders Peak to admire the scenery, they lost track of time until dusk. Hand in hand, they entered a ravine and saw an old man leaning on a staff within a stone gate. Deben bowed and recounted his journey. The old man said joyfully: \"Come with me to the rear courtyard.\" After walking four or five *li*, they saw a gate, resplendent in cinnabar and azure, inscribed in golden seal script: *Gate of Purple Radiance*. Upon entering, they beheld tiered pavilions and interconnected halls, guarded by stern sentinels. Deben trembled, not daring to lift his gaze. The old man said: \"This is the Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection. The True King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, surveys the mortal realm. You have donated vast family wealth to relieve the starving—your virtuous deed is commendable, and thus you are permitted to visit this divine abode. Your name shall be inscribed in the *Register of Immortals of the Nine Heavens*, and you shall transcend death.\" Deben bowed again and asked: \"Where does the True King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, reside?\" The old man replied: \"You have been reborn four times in this human form, burdened by deep karmic obstructions from past lives. Your bone structure is not yet purified—such matters are not for you to inquire. You should strictly uphold precepts, clarify your spirit, aid others, benefit beings, and advance without slack. The True King perceives even the subtlest deeds; in time, he will surely grant you deliverance.\" Deben bowed in thanks, and the old man led him out the gate.\n\nSuddenly, the scene between Min and Yu faded away, and Deben found himself back at his original dwelling. He asked the Daoist: \"Who was that old immortal?\" The Daoist replied: \"He is the Divine Officer of this Grotto-Heaven, a subordinate of the True King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens. Since you have already visited the divine palace and received his solemn instructions in person, I shall now take my leave of you.\" With that, he bowed and departed.\n\n*From the* Record of the Great Divine Proximity\n\n**Zhang Huaiwu’s Hidden Merit in Aiding Beings**\nDuring the early Tianyou era of the Tang, Nanping Prince Zhong, the military governor of Jiangxi, dispatched the Daoist Shen Taixu to perform a jiao offering at the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy. After the rite, Taixu seemed to dream and saw a figure before the statue bow, saying: \"I am Zhang Huaiwu. Once a military officer, I accrued slight hidden merit by aiding others, and the Celestial Envoy appointed me as a Divine Officer.\" Upon waking, he inquired about Zhang Huaiwu’s name, but none could provide an answer. Returning home, he recounted this to the scholar Shen Bin. Twenty years later, Bin traveled to Liling, where the county magistrate Lu and his guests were dining. A military clerk, Xu, arrived late and mentioned Zhang Huaiwu. Bin asked about him, and Xu replied: \"Huaiwu was a deputy general under Cai. During the great famine of the jiachen year, he learned that Yuzhang alone had a good harvest and led his troops there. En route, tensions arose between the two armies. By the time they reached Wuchang, hostilities had escalated, and battle seemed imminent despite all attempts to stop it. Huaiwu then drew his sword and addressed his men: ‘Our journey today has no other purpose but to save lives. Why, then, do you allow petty grievances to drive you to mutual slaughter? If you fight, the strong will be wounded, the weak will perish—why abandon your homeland and die on the road?’ He continued: ‘The conflict exists because of me. Today, I shall die for you all, and the two armies will face no further hardship.’ With that, he slit his own throat. The soldiers wept bitterly, reconciled, and by the time they reached Yuzhang, none had perished.\"\n\n*From the* Record of Divine Officer Zhang\n\n**Wang Lin’s Release of Life and Burial of the Dead**\nLin was a native of Jingzhao. In the second year of Dashun of the Tang, he served as the magistrate of Yaoshan County in Xingzhou. At the time, war was raging, and countless innocents perished by the sword. Lin lamented: \"How pitiable that these guiltless people lie with their brains and entrails spilled upon the earth!\" He then donated his family’s wealth to procure coffins. Over the course of several years, the number of those he buried was beyond count.\n\nWhen his colleague Gao Yingcheng of Jinling died in office, his aged mother and numerous dependents, impoverished, could not return home. Lin exhausted his resources to aid them, sending his son Gangyin to escort them across the ferries back to their native place, an act praised by all scholars.\n\nJinling bordered the river, and whenever Lin passed through the market, he would invariably purchase fish and turtles to release. One day, a fisherman cast his net and drew in a fish with crimson scales and golden eyes, over a *zhang* in length. Lin said, \"This is a wondrous creature.\" He bought it and sent it back into the river, whereupon wind and waves arose.\n\nThat night, he dreamed of a martial officer, imposing in robes and cap, who addressed him: \"You have released life and buried the dead in great number. The Envoys of the Nine Heavens have recorded your meritorious deeds, and you shall enjoy the blessing of long life.\" Lin asked, \"Who are the Envoys of the Nine Heavens?\" The officer replied, \"They are the noble spirits of Heaven, commissioned by the Supreme Emperor to traverse the world, investigating good and evil to mete out punishment and reward. They dwell on the northern slopes of Mount Lu—surely you know this?\" Lin awoke, struck with wonder, and thereafter daily offered incense and prayers.\n\nHe lived to over a hundred years before passing away. His two sons and six grandsons likewise all reached venerable old age.\n\nThe capital called them the \"Long-Life Wang Family.\" Chancellor Xue Juzheng wrote a poem that read:\n\n*\"The crimson fish repays blessings through three generations,\nThe white bones bear gratitude even to the Nine Heavens.\"*\n\nTheir family inscribed this on stone to record it.\n*From* **Zheshen’s Records of Verified Accounts**\n\n**The Prohibition Against Eating Beef and Entering Daoist Observatories**\nIn the first year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, a butcher followed sightseers into an observatory during spring. Suddenly, as if seized by some force, he was hurled to the ground. Panicked, he fled outside and dashed into an empty chamber, where he collapsed, bellowing like an ox. After several days, he died, his eyes bulging. To this day, those who have eaten beef dare not enter the palace gates.\n*From* **Records of Luminous Warnings**\n\n**The Retribution for Adulterating Lamp Oil in Ritual Offerings**\nAt the foot of Mount Lu lived an oil merchant who was exceptionally filial to his mother. One day, he was struck dead by a violent thunderbolt. His mother, believing her son innocent, wept daily before the shrine of the Envoys, beseeching to know the reason. One night, she dreamed of a divine figure in vermilion robes who told her: \"Your son mixed fish fat with oil, passing off the false as genuine to deceive others and profit thereby. The lamp oil used in our shrine’s rituals was tainted with its foul stench, which the transcendent spirits abhor. His death by thunder was long overdue.\"\n*From* **The Unforgotten Matters of the Great Dao**\n\n**He Jixu’s Sincere Devotion Restores His Sight**\nJixu, styled Daofu, was a native of Huangzhou. In the second year of the Tianxi reign, he served as registrar of Yanshi County in Henan Prefecture. Stricken with blindness, he resigned his post. A Daoist from Mount Lu informed him: \"The Nine Heavens’ Envoys of this abbey respond to utmost sincerity in prayer.\" Jixu sent his son, Zhonghe, to the mountain to present ritual offerings and returned with a painted image of the deity. Abstaining from desire and meat, he burned incense and prayed daily, washing his eyes with the consecrated water. After nearly two years, one eye began to perceive objects as though gazing through gauze. He then returned to the mountain to offer thanksgiving rites in gratitude for the divine favor. Several months later, both eyes regained their sight. Moved by this miracle, Jixu observed the precepts and devoted himself to the Dao with even greater diligence. He lived to ninety-seven years of age. He composed *The Vow of Audience with the True* and *Rhapsody on Washing the Eyes with Divine Water*. The *Eulogy and Account of the Nine Heavens’ Envoys, True Kings* records these events in detail.\n*From* **Records of Credible Accounts from the Gentry**\n\n**Zhang Xinli’s Devotion to the Painted Image Spares Him from Wind and Waves**\nXinli, styled Chengzhi, was a native of Heyang. In the second year of the Tiansheng reign, he was appointed judicial officer of Nanxiong Prefecture. While passing Mount Lu’s Taiping Abbey to perform ritual offerings, he commissioned and enshrined a painted image of the Nine Heavens’ Envoys. Upon completing his term and returning to the capital, his boat neared Little Orphan Isle when a violent storm arose, nearly capsizing the vessel. His entire household wept in despair. Yet as he prayed before the incense burner, a great gust tore through the cabin and snatched away the painted image. In an instant, the wind subsided and the rain cleared—the image was found hanging from the mast. All aboard gazed upward in awe and wonder.\n*From* **Records of Rivers and Lakes**\n\n**Hu Yuanbi’s Dream-Warning Against Killing Leads to a Son**\nYuanbi, a native of Jiangzhou, served as wine officer in the first year of the Jingyou reign. Though both his parents had reached seventy-seven, he himself was often ill, and though he had fathered several children, none survived. He adopted a son of another surname, but that child too died young. His entire household observed vegetarian fasts and performed rites at the shrine. That night, lodging in a Daoist abbey, he dreamed a young attendant in embroidered robes admonished him: “You have long taken lives without restraint to gratify your appetite, and thus your line is cut off. If you cease killing, you shall receive good recompense.” Yuanbi awoke in a cold sweat. He performed further rites to receive the gods’ instruction, and vowed to abstain from killing to atone for past transgressions. The following year, a son was born to him, and later his family prospered.\n\n*From* **Records of Luminous Admonitions**\n\n**Ma Zijian’s Retribution for Official Cruelty**\nZijian, a native of the capital, resigned his post as recorder of Hongzhou in the first year of the Zhiping reign and returned home. His father, Cuncheng, fell gravely ill on the road, and by the time they reached West Grove Temple on Mount Lu, he had lost consciousness. Zijian sent for a physician in Jiangzhou, but before the man arrived, he heard of the divine efficacy of the Nine Heavens’ Envoys at Taiping Abbey. He went to the abbey to perform rites, but as he was about to ascend the altar, he was suddenly struck with vertigo and could not complete the ceremony. Meanwhile, his father Cuncheng, burning with fever, fell into a frenzy. As if seeing visions, he cried out: “Zijian, in office, gave free rein to his temper, beating and killing many—now their grievances clamor for redress!” Several days later, Cuncheng broke into a sweat and recovered, but Zijian, consumed with distress, died soon after reaching the capital.\n\n*From* **Records of Luminous Admonitions**\n\n**The Filial Son Wen Who Cut Out His Liver to Save His Father**\n\nWen Biao, styled Zhongbing, was the son of a farming family from Dehua County in Jiangzhou. Diligent in study and profoundly filial, at sixteen he traveled to the Imperial Academy. In the seventh year of the Yuanfeng era, his father fell gravely ill. Biao hastened to the Hall of Visitation, prayed for leave to return home, then slit open his abdomen and excised his liver, from which he prepared twenty-four medicinal pellets. These he mixed with other herbs and administered to his father, whose illness immediately abated. When the prefecture and county learned of the matter, they sought to report it to the imperial court. Biao wept and said, “This is but the ordinary duty of a son—why make it known?” Thus his reputation grew even greater. His father lived another twenty-four years before passing away, the same number as the liver pellets. When Biao first cut out his liver, he mistakenly incised his right flank, whereupon he suddenly heard a voice from the void say, “It is on the left.” He swiftly withdrew the blade, then cut into his left side and obtained it. Blood flowed across the ground, and his spirit dimmed into darkness. In a daze, he saw a Daoist offer him a red bird to eat, and he revived. Later, Biao journeyed again to the capital but died en route. His family established a shrine beside the palace. Cai Songxi of Mount Song inscribed a poem:\n\n*I hear that in those days he carved out his liver,*\n*Ten thousand spirits in the Nine Heavens’ halls looked on.*\n*The blood still stains the blade that plucked the blossom,*\n*While the father, swallowing the medicine, rests at ease within.*\n*His lofty conduct reached the ears of the Supreme Emperor,*\n*Yet fine renown was never sought, nor high office.*\n*Where has that peerless purity of jade now gone?*\n*Surely to the Three Mountains, riding a rainbow phoenix.*\n\nIn the fifth year of the Qiandao era, Biao’s nephew Wen Jie likewise cut flesh from his thigh to cure his mother’s illness. At the time, Sima Zhibai composed *Records of the Filial Sons Wen*. From *Prefectural Gazetteer of Filial Conduct*\n\nGao Yunju Reads the *Great Cavern Scripture*\nYunju was a recluse from Qiantang. Devoted to the Dao, he delighted in reading the *Great Cavern Scripture*, his every movement guided by its precepts. One day, a cloud chariot descended from the heavens in a blaze of radiance. A figure alighted, his crown and robes shimmering with rosy light, his countenance gleaming like jade. Yunju bowed deeply in reverence. The immortal asked, “Do you read this scripture—do you also comprehend its essence?” Yunju replied, “I have heard it is the exalted text of thirty-nine chapters. Yet though I study it privately, I have not yet grasped its profound meaning.” The immortal smiled and said, “I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Visitation. Hearing of your tireless reading of the *Cavern Scripture*, I came to observe. If you persist without ceasing, in time you will naturally attain its mysteries. You must strive diligently.” Before the words were finished, he suddenly ascended into the void and vanished.\n\nFrom *Li Wenzheng Gong’s Southern Journey Records*\n\n**Zhou Ju Receives the Ten-Character Scripture by Divine Transmission**\n\nZhou Ju was a native of Wu. In the first year of the Jianyan era, he returned to his hometown from the capital. At that time, false rebels and bandits arose on all sides. Suddenly, a figure in a star-crowned cap and feathered robes appeared, saying, “Tomorrow you will perish in the calamity of war. If you recite the Ten-Character Scripture, you may escape death, resolve grievances, and prolong your life.” Zhou knelt to the ground and entreated him. The feathered-robed one said, “The *Nine Heavens Responding to Primal Thunder, Universally Transforming Heavenly Worthy*—this is the Ten-Character Scripture.” Having bowed to receive it, Zhou looked up, but the figure had vanished. He suspected it was a divine transmission and steadfastly committed the words to memory.\n\nThe next day, he indeed encountered bandits who pursued him into the woods. In his distress and fear, he urgently recited the invocation. Before the sound had left his lips, thunder crashed violently. The bandits, terrified, fled, and he thus escaped disaster.\n\nFrom *Zhao Xuelao’s Records*\n\n**Retreat of Zhang’s Bandits in the Jianyan Era**\n\nIn the winter of the first year of the Jianyan era, the rebel Zhang Yu gathered tens of thousands of followers, crossed the Huai River, and seized Chizhou. On the tenth day of the twelfth month, they advanced upon Jiangzhou. At the time, the prefect, Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion and Grand Master for Court Audiences Chen Yanwen, donned armor himself, led the people, and ascended the city walls, vowing to defend to the death. The bandits besieged the city for three days, and the situation grew perilous. The people of the prefecture wailed and prayed, prostrating toward the mountains in supplication.\n\nSuddenly, banners appeared above the clouds, and a halo of radiance spread across the fields. A true form emerged, seated upon a lion, resembling a dragon-horse, with an entourage of riders arrayed in the misty qi. The entire city beheld it. Moments later, a great snowfall began, and the bandits, unable to endure the open air, suffered heavy casualties. A thousand-strong cavalry unit entered the palace grounds, setting fires everywhere, yet even bamboo huts and paper curtains would not ignite. Glancing at the palace gates, they seemed to perceive something, and in panic, they fled.\n\nAfter the bandits retreated, the prefect and the people of the prefecture held a thanksgiving jiao ritual for over a month. To this day, the scholars and commoners of Jiangcheng hold an assembly and perform a jiao ritual on the seventh day of the fourth month each year, a tradition originating from this event.\n\nFrom *Old Records of the Prefectural Palace*\n\n**Prefect Chen Yanwen’s Thanksgiving Jiao Ritual Address:**\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of Jade Clarity, resplendent in numinous power, has long guarded this famed mountain. The True King of the Golden Portal, bestowing blessings, first established his foundation in this land of fortune. Such matters are known in ancient times, and the rites are revered in our present dynasty. Recently, the Huai bandits have run rampant, and violent rebels have raged with insolence. Advancing by both land and water, they sought to seize our river city.\n\nAmidst the crossfire of arrows and stones, the city’s people faced imminent slaughter. Gazing toward the Jade Palace, we pleaded for deliverance, exhausting our sincerest offerings in desperate supplication. Then, banners of divine might appeared, qi coalescing into dragon-horses, auspicious clouds gathering on all sides—we knew the numinous hosts had come to our defense. For days, heavy snow fell, and the enemy’s advance was silently broken. With reverence for the Dao’s power, how could we fail to purify our hearts? Now, in humble observance of the profound rites, we seek to repay this boundless grace.\n\nMay the rainbow banners and feathered canopies descend briefly from the celestial heights; may the wind-borne steeds and cloud chariots deign to visit this grotto-palace. We pray for the ultimate bestowal of blessings, that all living beings may be eternally preserved.\n\nThis is the purpose behind the annual assembly of Jiangcheng’s scholars and commoners, who perform the jiao ritual on the seventh day of the fourth month.\n\nDuring the Jianyan era, when bandits invaded Jiujiang, the entire city’s populace teetered on the brink of massacre. At that time, the Nine Heavens’ Investigating Perfected Lord deigned to extend his protection from the clouds, granting the people of the prefecture a new lease on life. Thereafter, the scholars and commoners of the region reverently journeyed to this blessed site to perform the jiao ritual in thanksgiving.\n\nLater, during the Jiading era, when war reached the outskirts of Ezhou and disaster spread across several prefectures, the crisis pressed upon Jiujiang’s borders. The people, fearing death’s approach, wept as they beseeched the Perfected Lords—only to witness their prayers answered with deliverance, the demonic forces instantly dispelled. Recalling past mercies, how could our gratitude ever be repaid?\n\nThus, we gather in assembly to conduct a grand thanksgiving jiao ritual of one hundred and twenty altar stations. We humbly pray that weapons of war may forever fall silent and the entire region enjoy enduring peace. May every household be blessed with a hundredfold prosperity.\n\nThe Zhou Clan’s Tragedy on a Timber Raft\nThe Zhou family of Ruichang County, wealthy and influential in their region, traded extensively along the rivers and lakes. In the third year of the Shaoxing era, they purchased a large raft of upper-river cedar, valued at over one hundred thousand strings of cash, intending to transport it to Jiankang for sale. They entrusted the journey to a man of the same surname from Jiujiang, who had long prepared for the voyage. This man visited the Hall of the Perfected Lord of Lushan’s Celestial Inspection and drew a divination slip, which read:\n\n*Looking around, whence comes the one?*\n*Holding doubt, you harbor a second mind.*\n*If you cannot turn back now,*\n*How will you avoid sinking?*\n\nThe Zhou clansman, however, insisted the preparations were complete and refused to halt the journey. As soon as the raft reached the mouth of the Mi River, it indeed capsized.\n\n*From the Yijian Chronicles, Bing Volume*\n\nThe Execution of the Traitorous Xi in the Kaixi Era\nIn the twelfth month of the second year of the Kaixi era, Wu Xi, Vice-Commissioner of the Sichuan Pacification Office and Commander of Xingzhou, rebelled. On the eighteenth day of the first month of the following year, he usurped the title of King of Shu and dispatched his false general, Lu Xi, to garrison Kui Gate. The regional commander, Jiang Jie, surrendered his seal to him. Lu Xi arrived at Kui on the nineteenth day of the second month. Jiang Jie fled downriver and, on the twenty-fourth day, moored at Wanzhou. Among his retainers was a man named Zhao Tan, skilled in summoning spirits. That evening, Jiang ordered Zhao to perform a divination regarding his course of action and the fortunes of good or ill. The planchette pen moved with extraordinary speed, suddenly inscribing:\n\n*Wu Xi, having received the nation’s favor for generations, dares to plot treason and usurpation, threatening to deliver the four regions of Shu to barbarian rule. The Celestial Inspector of the Nine Heavens has memorialized his crimes, and the Supreme Emperor, enraged, has decreed the extermination of his clan. This shall come to pass within three months—keep it secret.*\n\nFearing that the revelation of the divine words would bring disaster, Jiang sealed the message tightly. On the tenth day of the third month, he reached Zhongzhou, where he encountered an official bulletin announcing that Wu Xi had indeed been executed on the twenty-ninth day of the second month. Jiang gathered a dozen or so retainers to open the seal, and all marveled in astonishment. Wanzhou lay over two thousand *li* from Xingzhou, yet the spirit’s pronouncement had preceded Wu Xi’s death by five days. Truly extraordinary!\n\nIn the fourth day of the last summer month of that year, Xue Fu, Gentleman for Announcing Teaching of the Sichuan Pacification Office, respectfully recorded this account. The inscription remains preserved in this palace.\n\nQian Fangping’s Divine Transmission of the *Yunsheng Chapter*\nFangping, a native of Huaihai, was resting at his desk on the Lantern Festival of the fourth year of the Chunyou era, the sun lingering at its zenith, when his spirit grew faint and he dozed off. In his dream, a Daoist with a topknot addressed him, saying, “I am Lord Yingyuan.” Before Fangping could respond, the Daoist reached into his robe and produced a scroll bearing written instructions. Fangping read aloud:\n\n*The Dao’s traces aid the mysterious transformation,*\n*Clouds and mist solemnly awe the spirits.*\n*In the purity of the numinous cavern,*\n*A myriad realms follow the circling flow.*\n\n*With reverence, the radiant Perfected assemble,*\n*Their light illumining the floating world.*\n*They bow and summon the Emperor’s household,*\n*Turning the images to brighten the flying palanquin.*\n\n*When the turning of fate is thus raised,*\n*Its distant depths cannot be sought.*\n*The forest of Peng soars with its lingering shade,*\n*The phoenix’s nature defies reckoning.*\n\n*Jade medicines bloom with perching fragrance,*\n*The forbidden palace unfurls divine schemes.*\n*The secret writ cherishes the veiled communion,*\n*As the six revolutions journey toward the primordial.*\n\n*Feathered transcendents transcend the kalpas’ wheel,*\n*Timely aiding the void and the yielding.*\n*The stripping away reveals the six depths,*\n*As islands gather upon the mountain’s peak.*\n\n*Jade leaves cling to the treasure phoenix,*\n*Scrutiny and elevation dissolve into empty seclusion.*\n*The rainbow banner marks the assistant’s presence,*\n*Attending and ministering to the worthy companions.*\n\n*Great is the midst of the primordial chaos,*\n*Where all beings cast their victorious qi.*\n*The Yellow Chamber feasts the steed’s honor,*\n*The nine canopies vie with the sovereign’s retinue.*\n\n*Descending and turning, you attain the subtlest,*\n*Opening the teaching at the Three Towers.*\n*You evade and again submit to fate,*\n*As the royal tally halts for a thousand autumns.*\n\nWhen he finished, the Daoist said, “This is the *Yunsheng Chapter of the Nine Heavens*. Commit it to memory, and one day come to the Taiping Palace to seek me.” Fangping recited it rapidly, memorizing it all, and wished to inquire further into its origins. Suddenly, his family startled him awake, leaving the matter utterly inexplicable.\n\nAfter five years had passed, he journeyed along the Gan River to the west, passing through Mipu, where he learned that Mount Lu’s Taiping Palace had been established by the Investigating Censor. Then he realized that the Lord Yingyuan of former days was none other than the True Lord Censor. He burned incense in his sleeves and paid reverence, carefully transcribing the previous text and inscribing it upon the hall’s lintel to manifest the divine transmission before departing.\n\n**Zhao Jiage’s Dream of the Divine Transmission of the Pinellia Decoction**\n\nZhao Jiage, styled Shisui, a Gentleman for Instruction, was serving as an administrator in Jiangxi during the second year of the Jingding era when he suddenly fell ill with a qi disorder. One night, he dreamed of an immortal in rosy clouds personally bestowing upon him the recipe for Pinellia Decoction. The next morning, he followed the prescription and took the medicine, recovering immediately. Later, when he was dispatched to recruit soldiers and entered the mountains to burn incense, he received another extraordinary dream. After sixty days, he had recruited a full complement of troops and returned to the bureau to perform a jiao ritual at the mountain. The words of his prayer went thus:\n\n*Formerly, on a day of the past year when the Great Year-star was in ascendance, a qi disorder suddenly arose, and official duties were entirely neglected. In a nighttime dream, an immortal in numinous robes personally transmitted the Pinellia Decoction. The next morning, I consulted a physician and followed the prescription, taking the medicine. No sooner had the cup touched my lips in drowsy vertigo than my body and viscera instantly felt cool and refreshed. How could a humble servant of the lower realm presume to move the manifest manifestations of the heavens above? Since then, as I have circled like an ant in the king’s service, I have barely escaped the jaws of death—* and so on.\n\nWe humbly pray that the imperial virtue, ever inclined toward life, and the heavenly Dao, ever blessing the good, may look upon this life of unblemished conduct and grant that long-held prayers ascend above. May the green glow of incense and flame mark this worldly existence as that of an immortal clerk in service to the Jade Emperor; may unflagging devotion ensure constant companionship beneath the Azure Splendor of the Great One.\n\n**The Strange Case of Liu’s Death While Worshipping at the Court of the Perfected**\n\nIn the fifth year of the Jingding era, on the seventh day of the first month, a resident of Jiangzhou named Liu, holding an official placard and lodging among the common folk, joined the crowd in paying homage to the Investigating Perfected Lord. As her servant burned paper money beneath the hall, she feared the flames might damage the sacred stone and hastily stopped him. Liu then rushed onto the dais, shouting and clamoring, fists raised as if to strike. Suddenly, the lamps and candles in the hall dimmed. In an instant, a divine figure seized Liu and dragged her down from the dais, spinning her three times before she collapsed to the ground, blood streaming down her face.\n\nThe worshippers pleaded with the Perfected Lord, begging for special mercy. After some time, Liu revived and was helped home. Upon reaching the New Bridge, she fainted again, murmuring as if in a drunken stupor: *\"Why do the Investigating Six Ding Spirits punish me so severely?\"* She returned home in this dazed state and died a li from her house.\n\nWord from her family revealed that three days earlier, she had consumed forbidden food, which was why the spirits had meted out punishment. From then on, those who came to pay homage did so with even greater reverence.\n\n*Record of the Investigating Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey, Scroll Seven* (End)",

Seven fascicles.*\n*Source edition:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Unity Section, First Subsection.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey***\n\nIn a dream, the messenger once spoke, foretelling that after five hundred years, blessings would extend to all living beings. Upon examining the chronicles, we find that from the *xinwei* year of the Kaiyuan era to the present, precisely five hundred years have passed.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong established a shrine to honor him, and the messenger’s name became illustrious. Successive sagely sovereigns of our dynasty have revered him: Emperor Shenzong devoutly bestowed a sacred title, and Emperor Huizong further conferred a precious register, elevating the messenger’s rank, exalting his sacrificial rites, and deepening the reverence of his worship. Auspicious omens and wondrous responses have followed in abundance—could this not be the fulfillment of that prophecy?\n\nWhen I, Yiwen, arrived in Jiujiang, I encountered the prefect, the Grand Master Hu Gongfang, who governed the commandery with purity and tranquility, harmonizing the people and the spirits. In the spring of the *jiaxu* year, the ancient rites were revived, and I was entrusted with overseeing the sacrifices at Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey. After the ceremonies concluded, I beheld the sublime landscape of the mountains and rivers—towering, vast, and layered in grandeur, beyond description. Truly, this is a place the lofty Perfected Ones would carefully select.\n\nAmong the abbey’s Daoists was Master Xiang Shishang, who cultivated himself with discipline and harbored a sincere desire to propagate the ancestral teachings. Observing that the transformative manifestations of the messenger had nearly faded from memory, he entreated me to compile these records. Though I dared not refuse on grounds of my own inadequacy, I have humbly arranged them as follows.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Ye Yiwen, Left Court Gentleman for Ceremonials, Vice Prefect of Jiangzhou Commandery, concurrently Commissioner of Agriculture and Farmland Reclamation, and recipient of the Fish-Bag Decoration, on the Day of Universal Offerings in the twenty-fourth year of the Shaoxing era.\n\n---\n\n**Fascicle One of *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey*: Origins and Founding of the Perfected One’s Manifestations**",

      "translated_text": "**Fascicle One of *The Veritable Records of the Perfected Lord Inspector of Mount Lu’s Tai Ping Xing Guo Abbey*: Origins and Founding of the Perfected One’s Manifestations**\n\n**Tracing the Origins**\n\nAccording to *The Orthodox Scripture of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Dao*, the Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King both emerged before the inception of the Primordial Black. When the celestial radiance had yet to dawn and the murky vapors remained unclarified, the Great Void was a boundless expanse of swirling darkness. For over seven thousand kalpas, the primal luminosity first divided, and the Nine Blacks took form, each separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years. The Azure Youth Lord annotates: \"At that time, there were no years or months. Once the Nine Blacks existed, each was separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety *li* of dark years.\" The pure black ascended and clarified, while the turbid black descended and spread.\n\nThe Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Primordial Beginning Heavenly King received the natural black, hence their designation as the Nine Heavens. The Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens is the true sovereign over all things that receive life. The Venerable Lord of the Nine Heavens is the ancestral master of the radiant virtues of all Perfected Ones. The Messenger of the Nine Heavens is the noble spirit who oversees and governs the myriad numina, the supreme authority who patrols the Three Realms to reward the good and punish the evil.\n\nFurthermore, *The True Book of the Phoenix Black of the Primordial Mound of the Nine Heavens* states that the Supreme Venerable Lord bestowed upon the Lords of the Five Marchmounts the power to avert calamities and dispel misfortunes. Within it is written: \"The Nine Heavens Perfected King subdues the thousand spirits and commands the multitude of numina.\"\n\n*The Record of the True Charts Descended in the Southern Tang* also declares that the Perfected Lord Messenger holds five titles: first, the Nine Heavens Perfected King; second, the August Thearch of Vermilion Numinosity; third, the Perfected of Fire Refinement; fourth, the Perfected Lord of the Southern Summit; and fifth, the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe August Thearch conferred upon him:\n- A ninefold luminous moon-shaped crown of golden dawn and jade,\n- A nine-rayed vermilion aurora robe of flying-cloud golden gauze,\n- A trailing azure sea-and-mountain skirt of vermilion aurora,\n- A single-layered feathered cloak with a vermilion aurora sash,\n- A red-jade aurora skirt,\n- A six-flowered gossamer robe,\n- Shoes of primordial vermilion light,\n- A tablet of supreme primal azure jasper,\n- Jade and kingfisher hairpins,\n- A golden tally of the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens and Perfected Lord of the Southern Summit,\n- The Sword of the Nine Primes,\n- The Seal of the Five Thearchs for Subduing Demons,\n- The Seal of the Nine Heavens Perfected King,\n- The Seal of the Numinous Might of the Inspector for Quelling Deviance.\n\nHe was also granted:\n- The seals of the Northern Culmen Heavenly Thearch, the Five Numinous Honored Spirits, the Celestial Soldiers and Officers,\n- The seals of the five hundred numinous officials, the Five Thearchs, the Three Officials, the Three Rivers, the Four Seas, the Five Marchmounts, the Four Watercourses, the Nine Yangtze Rivers, the Five Lakes, the twelve river-source nymphs, and their attendant soldiers and officers.\n\nWhite cranes and lions bore his carriage, Azure Dragons and White Tigers guarded his flanks, the Six Ding and Six Jia spirits stood in attendance at his left and right, and the immortal maidens of the Nine Heavens and the twelve stream Perfected Ones formed his musical retinue. The Great Thearch of Fusang, the Spirit King of Yang Valley, and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate served as his attendants.\n\nDuring the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Messenger of the Nine Dragons; in the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Messenger of the Nine Capitals; and in the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Messenger of the Primordial Capital. In the time of the Yellow Thearch, he was the Messenger of the True Prime; under Emperor Yao, the Messenger of the Supreme Clarity; under Emperor Shun, the Messenger of the Nine Doubts; under Great Yu, the Messenger of the Primordial Yi and Azure Waters, aiding Yu in successfully regulating the floods. In the reign of King Mu of Zhou, he was the Messenger of Celestial Numinosity; and in the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Messenger Inspector of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThe Nine Heavens lie above the thirty-two heavens, governing the nine hundred million myriad heavens, earths, and beings. They correspond to the numbers of the Nine Palaces of the Middle Kingdom, the Nine Provinces, the Nine Stars, and the celestial divisions of the Great Unity, thereby determining fortune and misfortune. The great and minor cycles of *qi*, the disasters of the yang’s ninety-six, descend upon these divisions, each presided over by celestial thearchs and numinous officials.\n\nThe generation and transformation of beings are of vast and numerous reckoning. By aligning the Nine Heavens with the sun, moon, and stellar lodgings, they illuminate and oversee the myriad states of the world, the Nine Provinces and Eight Extremities, the ten directions and all realms, the allotted lifespans and destinies of heaven and humanity, and the noble and base.\n\nThe one who can stabilize the source of generation and transformation is none other than the August Supreme Thearch of the Jade Clarity, the Great Dao of the Primordial Ultimate. The Supreme Venerable Lord, dwelling exalted in the Nine Heavens, oversees the true transformations below. Thus, he commanded the Nine Heavens Perfected King to receive the August Thearch of Vermilion Numinosity as his messenger, whose majesty and virtue encompass the laws of the Three Clarities and whose honor ranks second only to the Heavenly Thearchs.\n\nThe authority of the Inspector is numinously responsive and perceptive; all that is heard and seen may be verified. Thus, we know that the Perfected King is a noble spirit of the heavens, who divides his true self to dwell in numinous abodes and descends to guard the grotto-heavens and blessed lands, benefiting the states and households. Embodying the August Void to propagate compassion, he acts as the agent of the Vast Heaven to manifest transformations. Through successive dynasties, he has been revered and worshipped; scholar-officials and commoners alike hold him in awe. His numinous efficacy is manifest—how could he be compared to the mere licentious sacrifices of lesser cults?\n\n**Auspicious Manifestation**\n\nIn the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong, on the fifteenth day of the second month, the emperor dreamed in the Numinous Talisman Hall that a divine being with an imposing celestial retinue addressed him, saying: \"I am the Messenger of the Nine Heavens. By the mandate of the August Supreme Jade Thearch of the Primordial True Unity and the Supreme Venerable Lord, I inspect the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, the Three Realms and Ten Directions, the myriad states and Nine Provinces, and the Eight Extremities within and without. I observe and patrol, assessing the allotted lifespans and destinies of heaven and humanity, the sins and blessings of living beings, and establish the General Bureau of Inspection. The Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens opened his sanctuary on Mount Qian in Shuzhou; the Venerable Lord of the Nine Heavens opened his sanctuary on Mount Qingcheng in Shu Commandery; and I now open my sanctuary on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. You should establish temples on these three mountains, and after five hundred years, blessings will extend to all living beings.\"\n\nWith these words, the emperor awoke. The following day, Xuanzong summoned his ministers and recounted the dream.",

In an instant, clouds and cranes filled the air before the Hall of Embracing Primordiality, and an array of celestial attendants appeared. The messenger arrived in a chariot drawn by a green dragon, his divine countenance refined and radiant, his auspicious bearing flawless. The emperor bowed in reverence, and the messenger restrained him with his left hand. At that moment, five hundred spirit officials, the Water Deities of the Nine Rivers, the Twelve Stream Perfected, and the Twenty-Four Perfected of Supreme Purity stood in solemn formation. The assembled officials gazed in awe, and the emperor commanded Wu Daozi to capture the likeness. Within the reign, the imperial attendant Zhang Fenguo and the Dharma Master Zhang Pinggong were tasked with conveying the sacred image to Jiangzhou. He ordered Prefect Dugu Zheng and Magistrate Wei Chang to construct a temple on the northern slope of Mount Lu.\n\nThe abode of the numinous, the original palace, was personally chosen by the Perfected Lord as an auspicious site, situated in the northwest corner of Mount Lu. Earlier, Emperor Minghuang had dispatched envoys to search for fine landscapes among the mountains and waters, but none knew where to proceed. According to an old tradition, a resident named Chen lived on level ground when suddenly a Daoist arrived at his door and said: \"This land is fitting for the foundation of the messenger’s temple. Why not yield it? You shall receive divine protection.\" Chen replied: \"I would gladly do so, but my family is poor and cannot relocate swiftly.\" The Daoist said: \"I shall relocate you. Take care not to incur expenses. After your passing, you shall become the local earth deity of this region.\" With these words, he vanished, leaving Chen astonished. That night, a great storm of wind and thunder arose, and by dawn, Chen’s home had been moved to the southern slope of the mountain. Today, to the left of the palace stands the Earth Lord’s shrine, where offerings are made and its numinous efficacy shines brightly. The Chen clan of Yimen in Deyang are his descendants.\n\nThe palace’s foundation is situated before the peak of Sagely Governance. Extending to the intersecting ridges, it aligns with the direction of the Celestial Healer in the southeast. From the northeast facing the east, it embraces the return of the Greedy Wolf star.",

      "translated_text": "At the outset, Emperor Yuanzong dreamed of a messenger who declared that the site for the shrine’s construction already bore its own timber—requiring only labor to shape it. When the imperial envoy arrived, he selected a site before Sagely Governance Peak, where a spur of Mount Heng stretched forth, its contours rolling and swelling like ten thousand reined-in steeds. No sooner had the foundation been laid than tens of thousands of massive logs drifted down the water chamber, arriving just as they were needed, never falling short. Throughout the construction, divine radiance illuminated the worksite as if it were day. The laborers toiled without fatigue, and within months, the shrine was complete.\n\nThe envoy later dreamed of a divine being who said: “The pigments for whitewash and cinnabar-green lie here already—no need to seek elsewhere. Dig north of the shrine, and all five colors will be found.” Some say this timber was once prepared by the Prince of Jiujiang for palace construction, only to be sunk in the depths of Mipu, awaiting this very day. Ah, how extraordinary!\n\nTo the west of the shrine stretches a long gallery, perched above a deep ravine where torrents roar, their thunderous echoes resounding underground. The shrine was named the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger, and Emperor Yuanzong personally inscribed the six characters for its hall: *Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger*. In the second year of Shengyuan during the Southern Tang, the shrine was expanded into the Tongyuan Prefecture. Today, a market still stands before the mountain, known as the Prefecture Front Market.\n\nIn the second year of Taiping Xingguo under Emperor Taizong, the temple was renamed the Taiping Xingguo Abbey. In the sixth year of Xuanhe, Emperor Huizong further elevated it to the status of a palace with his own brush.\n\nPan Guan, the magistrate of Pengze, recorded its auspicious signs in *Records of Verifications*, summarizing five wonders at the shrine’s founding:\n1. Without rain or wind, the waters suddenly surged, shifting the ravine closer to the mountain—only to recede as before.\n2. Pigments of cinnabar and mixed hues emerged from crevices in the cliffs. Those who sought them for private use lost their way, while materials for the shrine’s needs were always obtained.\n3. On the night of the earth-pacifying ritual, wind and clouds raged for days. Yet when incense was burned and prayers offered, the skies cleared instantly. On the day of the ceremony, the heavens were serene, and at this propitious hour, distant \"immortal lamps\" shone forth.\n4. At the ferry crossing of Pengli’s waves, hundreds of passengers would sometimes appear, saying: “We journey to Mount Lu to pay homage at the Messenger’s shrine. Carry us, and we will reward you.” After crossing, each left five coins—only to find them turned to paper by dawn. Thus did spirits from afar come to revere the shrine, manifesting these auspicious signs for mortals.\n5. The Messenger’s entourage—dragons, lords, tiger officials, carved charioteers, some of clay, some of wood—would, upon entering the shrine, suddenly drip with sweat like a summer downpour, their faces glistening. The labor of divine beings left their perspiration flowing, a verification still preserved. Here, the distinction between human and spirit blurred.\n\nThese five marvels, rarely heard of in past ages, were carved into stone to be passed down to future generations.\n\n**Halls and Statues**\nThe *Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Investigator, Responding to the Dao, Guardian of Fate, Perfected Lord* was inscribed by Emperor Shenzong, though it later perished in flames. The present calligraphy is by Wang Guan.\n\nAt its center stands a statue of the Investigator, flanked by two golden youths and two jade maidens, with two spirit officials on either side. The Six Ding and Six Jia spirits, six each, stand in attendance. The inner walls of the hall depict the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Supreme Clarity and Grand Tenuity, while the outer walls feature the Twelve Perfected of the Streams on the left and the Water Lords of the Nine Rivers and Three Rivers Kings on the right. All were modeled after Wu Daozi’s originals, their appearances archaic and striking, their spirits vividly animated.\n\nBefore the hall, to the left stands the Guardian of the Dao, and to the right, the Protector of the Dharma. Beneath the pavilion are the Dragon and Tiger Generals. To the hall’s left wing is the Hall of the Three Officials, and to its right, the Hall of the Four Saintly Lords.\n\nOn the left side of the main corridor lies the Daoist Canon Repository, inscribed *Chamber of Jade Chapters* in the hand of Zhang Xiaoxiang of Huzhou. It houses 528 cases of scriptures, totaling 5,287 scrolls, with an additional 99 cases of esoteric texts never disseminated, donated by the Prince of Yang’s estate.\n\nTo the right stands the Hall of the Heavenly Master, inscribed *Hall of the Orthodox Unity*. In the tenth month of the twenty-eighth year of Shaoxing, by special decree of Emperor Gaozong, a grand hall was constructed behind the Investigator’s Hall to enshrine the emperor’s portrait and life-star, named the *Hall of Extended Blessings*.\n\nTo its right is the *Hall of the Merciful Salvation Perfected Lord of Zhang and Quan*; to its left, the *Hall of the Dragon King of the Three Mountains’ Streams and Numinous Blessings*. The latter was enfeoffed in the fourth year of Jiatai, as detailed later.\n\nIn the fifth year of Shaoding, the Three Clarities Precious Pavilion was built, housing the nine imperial thrones at its center. The left auxiliary tower enshrines the image of the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Venerable; the right, the image of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. In the intercalary twelfth month of the fourth year of Jiaxi, Emperor Lizong bestowed the three characters *Three Clarities Pavilion* in his own hand.\n\nThe side corridors each extend twenty-five bays: the left depicts the Investigator’s manifestations under various titles from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the present; the right illustrates the Investigator’s deeds since the shrine’s founding—rewarding good, punishing evil, and the verified miracles of cultivating immortality and praying for heirs.\n\nThe winding corridors each have five bays, adorned with images of five hundred spirit officials in celestial crowns and crimson robes, arrayed as if in audience, their faces distinct and arranged in order. These were modeled after Tang dynasty paintings from the Imperial Academy, a masterpiece of recent times.\n\nAt the center of the corridors stand three tiers of stone altars. To the left rises a five-story brick pavilion, atop which hangs a great bell inscribed *Scenic Sun*. To the right stands another five-story brick pavilion, housing a statue of the Great Emperor of Vermilion Mound, inscribed *Vermilion Mound*.\n\nBetween the two winding corridors lie the Inner Three Gates, inscribed *Gates of Purple Prime and Radiant Brilliance* in the hand of Zhang Zihu. Within stands a pavilion inscribed *Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection* by Zhang Lingliao.\n\nAccording to old records, the adept Liu Deben encountered an immortal who guided him into the *Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection*, whence this name derives. There, the Investigator examines the merits and demerits of mortals before departing.\n\nBeneath the steps lies a single stone, said in old records to mark the passage of Liu Yue, who entered and exited here. When Perfected Lord Kang Fu visited Liu by appointment, he knocked upon this stone to enter the grotto palace. Today, a pavilion stands over it, named *Liu the Immortal’s Stone*.",

      "translated_text": "Beyond this lie the Outer Three Gates, inscribed *Palace of Grand Peace and Prosperous Nation*. The original calligraphy was an imperial gift from Emperor Huizong, later lost to the flames of war. The present inscription is by Prefect Jiang Can. The gates adjoin the *Bridge of Transcendent Crossing*, where pines and cedars grow dense and lush, and the paths are paved with stone. A pavilion overlooks the post road, its plaque reading *Grand Peace Under Heaven*, also in the hand of Zhang Lingliao.\n\nBehind the main hall stand the *Hall of Daoist Records*, the *Lotus Pond Assembly of Wu Shuobian*, the *Hall of Embracing the One*, the *Empty Chamber of Yi Mountain* inscribed by Zi Xi the Recluse, the *Cloudless Heart Hall of Bubbling Spring*—so named because the Perfected Lord Qingxu Huangfu once dwelled here, its plaque in clerical script. The name derives from Emperor Gaozong’s edict, which spoke of *\"white clouds without intent in the imperial realm.\"* Later, Huangfu moved to the *Alms-Bowl Peak* within this palace, though the hall remains. Nearby are the *Pavilion of Listening to the Rain*, inscribed by Li Pingshan, and the *Jade Bridge*, inscribed by He Shiyin. The *Imperial Calligraphy Stele Pavilion* houses stone engravings of imperial brushwork, including portraits of *The Yellow Court Scribe*, *The Star of Longevity*, and *Guanyin*. Adjoining it are steles by eminent officials and nobles.\n\nTo the left and right, the mountain slopes hold over thirty Daoist cloisters, nestled by water and clinging to the hills, their windows delicate and bright, the sound of chanting resonant. Among them is the *Hall of Subtle Mystery*—now known as *Baoging*—where Master Lianxi left an inscription. The *Ink Immortal Spring*, named after Lü Dongbin; the *Celestial Harmony Hall*, where Su Dongpo’s inscription of *\"withered trees and strange stones\"* adorns the walls, with a postscript by Hong Chu; the *Old Gardener’s Hall*, commemorating Huang Tingjian’s travels; and *Baozhen Hermitage*. The *Fanghu Pavilion* is secluded among plum and bamboo, its vistas clear and serene. Zhang Lingliao’s plaques and inscriptions by renowned scholars abound.\n\nOther sites include *Zhenyi Hermitage*, the *Mirror Spring and Cold Jade Pavilion*, *Retaining Clouds Pavilion*, *Jade Green Pavilion*, and *Emerald Verdure Pavilion*—all celebrated in poetry collections for their scenic beauty and calligraphic treasures. Behind the palace lies the *Divine Blessing Dragon Pool*, with its upper, middle, and lower ponds. The uppermost lies within sheer cliffs, perilous and inaccessible, while the middle and lower ponds allow pilgrims to come and go for prayers. Woodcutters often witness dragons playing with pearls. When clouds arise, those before the mountain see the dragons ascend with them.\n\nThe *Immortal’s Scripture-Reciting Platform* features a stone jutting forth like an altar, its edges folded in layered stone patterns resembling curtains. In times of rain, woodcutters hear the sound of scriptures being chanted. The *Flying Cloud Cavern* can seat twenty or thirty people. Within, a hidden passage leads inward, nearly blocked by a newly formed stone. Though impassable, when clouds gather, rain follows; when thunder rumbles, skies clear. The locals use this to foretell the weather.\n\nBefore the palace lie the *Longevity Prayer and Life-Release Pond* and the *Golden Accumulation Pond*. Flanked by dragon and tiger formations, with pines sighing in the wind and moonlit vines, clear streams and strange rocks, the site is secluded from the mortal world—a true land of scenic blessing under heaven.\n\n**The Lotus Assembly**\nAfter the founding of the shrine in the Tang dynasty, Daoists Cai Xianjue, Meng Xianzhen, Wu Taiqing, Ouyang Faming, and Suan Zhiyin were selected to tend the incense and flames. The following year, on the first day of the eighth month, the jiao offering was completed. On that day, commoners and elders from the Jiang-Huai region, along with monastics and laypeople—thousands who had gathered unbidden—celebrated the consecration with unceasing day-and-night rituals. As lotuses bloomed in abundance, worshippers each plucked a flower as an offering, placing them upon the palace steps. Overjoyed, they declared, *\"This assembly is most auspicious—let us name it the Lotus Assembly!\"* They vowed to gather here annually on this day to pray for abundant harvests and to ward off pestilence. *\"May the divine envoys bestow their protection and grant us blessings!\"* With one voice, the multitude of ten thousand bowed twice and departed. *(From old records.)*",

All rites are duly performed, continuing the aspirations of our forebears.\n\nMay the resonance of our utmost sincerity evoke a luminous response; may trust and blessings attend my humble self, granting me abundant fortune. May it assist our realm, enduring for a hundred million years. As we record these events in their time, may they forever remain unsung in lament.\n\n**Memorial in Petition:**\nThe Perfected transcend proximity, and the great Dao defies naming. Thus, we adopt the old titles and inscribe new records. Envoys are dispatched afar to reverently announce this to the true palaces. Choosing an auspicious day through divination, we command the officials to prepare the rites. We look up, entreating the divine gaze, and bow down, reflecting our sincere devotion. May the long-neglected ceremony be fulfilled, and boundless blessings be bestowed.\n\n**Sacrificial Announcement:**\nThe wondrous Dao reaches the heavens, and its beneficent works extend to all things.

Our sincere devotion is present, and its illumination is timely.\n\n**Rite of Presentation:**\nIn our office, we revere and exalt, daring not to neglect the duty of spiritual reverence. With utmost sincerity, we offer this sacrifice, fittingly adorned with words of luminous gratitude. Thus, we initiate the conferral of illustrious titles, devoutly extending our solemn veneration. We look up, entreating a gracious response, and pray for enduring auspicious blessings.\n\n**Dissolution Rite:**\nThe supreme spirits are formless, though beyond naming, their profound virtue resides in humanity. Following the signs given, we unify in reverent display, initiating the presentation of illustrious titles. May they accept our praise and exaltation, and may felicity and blessings endure forever.\n\n**Red Memorial for the Dissolution Rite:**\nWe reverently serve the exalted Perfected, initiating the proclamation of their illustrious records. Gazing toward the celestial vault, we extend our devotion within the sacred precincts. The blessings they bestow bring fortune to the people, and the pure felicity they confer extends the prosperity of our glorious reign.\n\n**Opening Memorial for the Installation of the Jade Records:**\nThe Lu Peak stands majestically, a true shrine of immortals and sages. The jade records are newly inscribed, illuminating the grand ceremony of this auspicious day. As the rites conclude in celebration, we dare to present wondrous offerings. May the sentiments of all be universally fulfilled, and our sincere prayers be extended.\n\nWe humbly pray: May the supreme spirits manifest their presence, their divine insight aligning with our devotion. May the emperor’s longevity be boundless, expanding the vastness of his imperial legacy; may the three seasons bring no harm, and the people and all things flourish in peace and abundance.\n\n**Dissolution Rite:**\nThis famed peak of Mount Lu is indeed the sacred abode of celestial immortals. Though its dreamlike appearance by day was first recorded in the Kaiyuan era, its renown has long resounded near and far, evoking the distant origins of the True King. In the world, he serves as an aide to emperors; in heaven, he oversees the functions of ears and eyes. A thousand years ago, his name was first inscribed in the Yuanfeng era, and four characters were initially added to his illustrious title. Now, as this felicitous time arrives, we perform these rites of veneration. Jade is engraved and inlaid with gold, its brilliance forming constellations in the heavens; from the imperial balcony, the records are proclaimed, enhancing the grandeur of rivers and mountains. As this splendid occasion unfolds, we choose an auspicious day to offer our prayers.\n\nWe humbly pray: May the divine majesty descend and manifest, its luminous gaze attending our offerings. With fragrant smoke rising in devotion, we together gaze upon the profound depths of the nine heavens. May vast blessings be proclaimed, and the era of boundless longevity be forever declared. May these blessings be bestowed upon all people, bringing shared joy in a hundred delights.\n\n**Renaming the Temple as a Palace:**\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month in the sixth year of Xuanhe, by imperial brush, the temple was renamed a palace. The Grand Master of Remonstrance, Wang Yijian, memorialized, requesting that an imperial plaque be bestowed. Thus, the emperor inscribed it as \"Palace of Great Peace and Flourishing Nation.\"\n\nAt that time, as the imperial plaque was conveyed by river to Xie Family Bay in Taiping Prefecture, the Dragon King of Shunji appeared upon the boat, his golden scales and jade claws over a foot long, coiling around the floral branches. He escorted the vessel to Qingxi in Chizhou, where three or four aquatic creatures raised their heads and roared. The Dragon King, from within the boat, turned his head to regard them. The officials and people of Chizhou gazed in reverence, and suddenly, he vanished.\n\n**Record of Marvels:**\nAt the outset of the journey, a divination foretold: \"The ritual at the original palace will be delayed by headwinds, risking the loss of the appointed time.\" Yet, at Zhenzhou, a favorable wind arose, shortening a half-month’s journey to a few days. Upon reaching the shore, the wind turned contrary as before. The prediction was precise, and all marveled at it.",

      "translated_text": "**First Petition for the Offering**\n\nWith reverence, I inherit the shelter of the Dao’s grace—how could I forget the devout heart of service? Humbly knocking upon the gate of Heaven, I dare to lay bare my earnest plea.\n\nI reflect that your humble consort was born to a sagely sovereign, her blessings gathered in the Empress’s chambers. Though her years have reached the prime of middle age, each day she cultivates the nurturing of filial devotion. Favored by the August Emperor’s regard, she trembles in awe before her own small self. Thus, she offers the remnants of her adornments and cosmetics, reverently approaching the profound depths of the jade palace. Carefully following the sacred rites, she seeks to repay her modest sincerity.\n\nMay the three thousand six hundred parts of the universal offering ascend as incense to the scrutiny of the heavens above; may the one thousand two hundred years of brow-longevity extend the cultivated lifespan of the Most High. May the Empress’s palace receive the fullest of blessings, her sacred sons and divine grandsons numbering in the thousands and millions. May my aged body enjoy the fortune of health and peace, my eyes seeing clearly and my ears hearing keenly.\n\nFurthermore, may the surplus of this grace overflow to moisten all within the Four Seas. May each year bring the auspiciousness of abundant harvests, and may the people know no fear of plague or pestilence. In this single chant, I lay bare my crimson devotion—might you deign to bestow your vast protection?\n\n**Second Petition (Intent as Before)**\n\n**Second Petition for the Offering**\n\nWith a heart of pure sincerity, I do not shrink from making my plea again and again. Though the vault of Heaven spans ten thousand miles, surely it will bestow its luminous regard.\n\nI reflect that your humble consort, having given birth to the sacred person of the Son of Heaven, dwells in honor within the palace chambers. Nurtured by the joyful devotion of the myriad realms, she has indeed been favored by the private grace of the Nine Heavens. Thus, she offers the surplus of her robes and ornaments, reverently approaching the secret halls of the immortals. Presuming to extend this humble offering, she seeks in small measure to repay the gifts of life and growth.\n\nReverently performing the true rites for the ten cycles of the celestial realms, she prays to augment the sovereign’s years, that the divine and the human may join in the threefold acclamation of Mount Song. May the Empress’s palace receive the auspiciousness of the sun’s dream, and may her later years flow on like a river’s endless course.\n\nMoreover, may the shelter of the Dao’s grace widely extend to all beings. May those who follow the Primordial Unity swiftly attain the wonders of ascension; may those who delight in the Buddha’s teachings swiftly enter the gate of perfect enlightenment. May the four seasons be harmonious as the jade candle, and may the hundred grains bear the golden signs of abundance.\n\nOnly by the great perfection’s compliance with desire do I dare to present these humble words. Overwhelmed by my reliance upon your grace, I trust you will deign to bestow your luminous regard.\n\n---\n\n**Memorial for Border Protection**\n\nIn the second year of the Longxing reign, cyclical year *jiashen*, the eleventh month, on the day *renwu* marking the new moon, the twenty-eighth day *jiyou*, your subject, the heir to the throne, humbly petitions for the pacification of the borderlands, as the court deploys troops, and beseeches the granting of unseen assistance.\n\nRespectfully dispatching the Left Court Gentleman for Dispersing Culture, Academician of the Hall for the Diffusion of Literature, and Acting Prefect of Jiangzhou Prefecture, bestowed with the Purple Gold Fish Bag, your subject Tang Wenruo, I dare to solemnly present this offering at the Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses, the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate, within the Taiping Xingguo Abbey.\n\nI reflect that the demonic rebels encroach upon the borders, still wantonly wreaking their cruel ravages; the armies encamp in the wilds, yet have not achieved the merit of repelling them. Daring to lay forth my sincere devotion, I look up to your heroic scrutiny, hoping for the assistance of your numinous might, that no demonic visions may coil and fester.\n\nMay the offering be enjoyed.\n\n---\n\n**Bestowal of the Title \"Divine Grace\" upon the Dragon Shrine**\n\nIn the fourth year of the Jiatai reign, the first month, in accordance with a document from the Ministry of Rites, itself following a report from the Department of State Affairs, which had received a petition from the Jiangxi Circuit Transport Commission, based on an application from Jiangzhou Prefecture, which cited a memorial from Dehua County, submitted by the local scholar Liu Kui and others:\n\nThey observed that behind the Taiping Xingguo Abbey, at the Dragon Pool in the ravine of Three Mountains, the dragon’s response to prayers for rain from nearby clans and distant families has been manifestly efficacious. During the two years that Prefect Wang Rong served in office, whenever drought occurred, he prayed for rain, and the rains fell in answer. In the first year of the Jiatai reign, when no rain had fallen by the sixth month, the prefecture dispatched the Acting County Magistrate Chang Quan to personally visit the Dragon Pool, where he welcomed the sacred water and installed it in the hall for the offering. Before the rites were completed, a great rain began to fall, reviving the withered seedlings, and the year yielded a bountiful harvest. The prefecture then constructed a shrine at the Dragon Pool to honor and worship the dragon.\n\nThey petitioned for the bestowal of a noble title and shrine plaque.\n\nThe commission dispatched Shangguan Shiji, Vice-Magistrate of Yongxing County in Xingguo Prefecture, to personally investigate, and subsequently assigned Sun Ren, Vice-Magistrate of Fengxin County in Longxing Prefecture, to verify the matter. The aforementioned numinous traces indeed bestow grace and favor upon the people.\n\nAfter confirming the facts, they awaited the imperial decree.\n\nLater, the matter was referred to the Ministry of Rites for deliberation and submitted to the Department of State Affairs. Shortly thereafter, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices was instructed to deliberate. Following their report, it was noted that in accordance with the directive issued on the sixth day of the first month of the third year of the Jianyan reign, shrines demonstrating numinous efficacy were to be granted plaques first; and in accordance with the directive issued on the nineteenth day of the sixth month of the fourteenth year of the Chunxi reign, henceforth, shrines where prayers had been answered were to be reported by the circuit transport commissions in accordance with regulations, and imperial decrees were to be sought for their ennoblement.\n\nThe Court of Imperial Sacrifices noted that the transport commission of this circuit had already dispatched officials to investigate, verify, and report in accordance with regulations, and that the proper procedures for ennoblement had been followed.\n\nUpon deliberation, it was determined that, in accordance with the aforementioned directives, the shrine should first be granted a plaque, and the appropriate decree should be issued.\n\nHumbly requesting that the Ministry of Rites submit this to the court for an imperial decree to be issued for its implementation.\n\nAfter the Ministry of Rites deliberated, it was determined that the matter should proceed in accordance with the Court of Imperial Sacrifices’ findings.\n\nAwaiting the decree.\n\nBy imperial decree, the plaque shall be bestowed with the title **\"Divine Grace Shrine.\"**\n\n---\n\n**Jade Tablet for Protecting the State and Praying for an Heir**\n\nIn the first year of the Jiaxi reign, cyclical year *dingyou*, the tenth month, on the day *jimao* marking the new moon, the fifteenth day *guisi*, your subject, the heir to the throne, humbly petitions to safeguard the continuation of the imperial line and reverently prays for the blessing of an heir. Respectfully offering incense and gifts, I have solemnly established the subtle rites, commanding twenty-one Daoist priests to perform a one-day-and-two-night **Lingbao Ritual** at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou, culminating in the dispersal of an offering of three hundred sixty parts. I have pledged alliance with Heaven and Earth, invoking the manifestation of auspicious omens.\n\nCarefully following the ancient forms, I approach the presence of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses, the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate. I present a **golden dragon and jade tablet**, hoping that the Most Sagely and Most Perfected may deign to regard this crimson offering. I beseech that it be transcribed and submitted, ascending to the Nine Heavens.\n\nI reflect that the position of crown prince remains vacant, and the auspicious dream of the bear has not yet unfolded; the borderlands are divided by encampments, and the tiger tallies of military command are still deployed. Within, I desire to strengthen the foundation of the state; without, I seek to pacify the miasma of war. Gazing up, I recall the arduous accumulation of our ancestors’ legacy, and am deeply moved by the daily fear of failing in its succession.",

In retrospect, I fear my presumption and willingly submit to the standard punishments.\n\nI reflect that your servant is but a withered remnant of the mountains and forests, a wanderer of clouds and waters subsisting on bamboo bowl and gourd ladle. My person drifts with the world, while my resolve is stirred by the times. I have witnessed the Perfected Lord Who Protects and Upholds the Mandate of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Responses at Mount Lu in Jiangzhou—from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors of antiquity down to the Tang, through successive dynasties, his name has changed, yet his manifest numinosity has descended with blessings. He governs the celestial and terrestrial mandate of the state and oversees the sacred charts of ancestral heirs.\n\nIn former times, imperial plaques were bestowed, lands granted, and enfeoffments and prayers established as enduring precedents. As for dispelling drought and flood, quelling the scourge of war—his responsive efficacy has twice been proven, as recorded in steles and annals. At the inception of the Perfected Lord’s manifestations, he declared that after five hundred years, blessings would extend to the living and the state’s destiny would be safeguarded. Now, five hundred and eight years have passed, yet none have penetrated the depths of his celestial hearing.\n\nI further reflect that your servant, though born of a Confucian family, was commanded by his father to enter the mountains. By grace, I donned the feathered robes and have tended the incense and flame of the Perfected Lord for over fifty years. Since my mistaken appointment as abbot, I have eradicated corruption, reformed abuses, and renewed the sacred precincts, leading the ranks of the Daoist clergy in prayers for the prolongation of the sagely emperor’s life. For every year’s abundance or scarcity, for the people’s sufferings and hardships, I have purified my heart day and night, offering sincere prayers in pursuit of responsive efficacy, aspiring to assist this enlightened age.\n\nThough I am not one bound by official duty or burdened with the responsibility of speech, my devotion to the state and love for the sovereign arise from innate nature.

Five hundred years of blessings bestowed upon all living beings now coincide with this destined number; ten thousand generations of boundless prosperity for the ancestral altars shall be preserved for posterity. We humbly pray that the Nine Heavens grant their favor, the Three Realms shine their presence; dispelling calamities to bring peace to the times, and stilling the weapons of war without battle. May we further hope for timely rains and sunshine, abundant harvests of grain; may the myriad people be free from pestilence, and the four seas delight in the transformative blessings of peace.\n\n**Supplication to the Supreme Emperor**\nHeaven is impartial, for it aids only those of virtue; the Supreme Dao has its essentials, and only through sincerity can it be accessed.

Within, we are burdened by nightly anxieties; without, we are weighed down by the horrors of war. Our repeated offerings and prayers are bound to this plea, gazing upon the vast heavens with utmost sincerity. We humbly pray that the Way of Heaven be restored, and the hearts of the people follow their desires; may the great creation turn its favor downward, universally bestowing benevolence; may the Perfected Offices be commanded to fully extend the virtue of cherishing life.\n\n**Supplication to the Perfected Lord**\nInheriting the grand enterprise, we have been remiss in our duties; now, amidst these troubled times, we are startled by the clarity of ancient precedents. Thus, we command the feathered followers to swiftly renew the sacrificial rites. The thirteen emperors’ reverence for the Perfected Lord’s rituals—how magnificent!

The petition, originally submitted by Xiong Shouzhong, former Supervising Abbot and Custodian of Jiangzhou’s Temple of Supreme Peace and National Prosperity, requests the conferral of an augmented title upon the Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, along with the performance of a jiao offering-rite, and the imperial bestowal of the three characters \"Three Clarities Pavilion\" for the sacred edifice. Following deliberation, the petition and accompanying register were forwarded to the Ministry of Rites for review and submitted to the Ministry of State Affairs. This ministry subsequently transmitted them to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices for assessment.\n\nAccording to the Court’s memorial, it is evident that the affairs of the Perfected Lord, as presented by Xiong Shouzhong, have long been marked by numinous efficacy. Since the Tang dynasty, manifold miracles have been recorded, and in our dynasty, during the reign of the Divine Emperor, he was first granted the title *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*. Successive sagely sovereigns have revered him with ever-increasing devotion, never diminishing their veneration. Upon careful examination of the submitted register, the six categories of evidence are fully expounded.

Should the throne approve the enfeoffment of the Perfected Lord as petitioned by Xiong Shouzhong, upon receipt of the rescript, the Ministry shall instruct the Bureau of Sacrifices to proceed accordingly, awaiting further directives.\n\nThe rescript and register were forwarded to the Ministry of Rites for assessment. The Ministry then transmitted them to the Bureau of Sacrifices, which, complying with the directives of the Department of State Affairs, now reports: in accordance with the Department’s rescript, it is proposed to add two characters to the title *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*, thus designating him *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation*. A formal edict shall be issued. May the Ministry and Department duly memorialize the throne for approval and implementation. The Ministry has noted the Bureau of Sacrifices’ report, as previously recorded, and petitions the throne for directives, awaiting the imperial command.\n\nOn the eighth day of the fourth month, by imperial decree, the Ministry’s proposal, as transmitted by the Bureau of Sacrifices, was approved. The throne is petitioned to issue the edict and confer the title, awaiting the imperial command.\n\nWe revere the Supreme Emperor and cherish the myriad spirits. Among the exalted ranks of immortals, the secrets of the Daoist canon have long been recorded. Though the Three Mountains stand as pillars, their traces began in the Tang; the primordial qi, encompassing all, has ever stored its numen since the Great Beginning. Mountains and rivers alike submit to his governance, and the state rightly relies on his protection and pacification. Gazing afar at the Perfected One’s influence, We bestow this splendid appellation:\n\n*Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate*.\nEmbodying the Dao in function, he enters existence and exits non-existence, preceding even the Lord of Heaven. None know his origin, yet his discourse on riding the darkness traverses the boundless. Once charged with his mission in the ethereal realms, he came to dwell in the numinous precincts of Mount Lu. Among the nine celestial offices, none surpass the dignity of the Surveyor; gathering the three realms of heaven, earth, and humanity, all fall under his vast oversight.\n\nFrom the reign of Emperor Taizong, when the *Taiping Xingguo* era saw the renaming of the temple, to the Divine Emperor’s time, when the title *Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate* was conferred and the palace named accordingly, his radiance illumines the Milky Way, and his majesty gleams in the Vermilion Palace of the Nine Heavens. Thus, We, in reverent adherence, follow the established precedents. The spring and autumn sacrifices are solemnly observed, and prayers for relief from flood and drought invariably meet with response. Perusing the reports of feathered-robed envoys, We envision the crane-borne chariot’s swift passage. To elevate his honorific title is to fittingly manifest his wondrous transformation.\n\nAt the dawn of the seven thousand kalpas, the primordial light first divided—hard to name with precision. For five hundred years, his blessings have flowed to the living, now fortuitously converging in this felicitous moment. Surely, the heavens’ repentance of calamity draws near, and the cessation of warfare across the four seas may be anticipated. May he protect Our grand enterprise and eternally secure Our august fortune.\n\nLet it be decreed: *Perfected Lord of Nine Heavens, Surveyor of Responses, Protector of the Mandate, Wondrous Transformation* shall be his special title.\n\n*Records of the Perfected Lord, Surveyor of Responses, of Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu, Scroll the Second (concluded)*\n*Records of the Perfected Lord, Surveyor of Responses, of Taiping Xingguo Palace on Mount Lu, Scroll the Third*\n*Category: Veneration in the Song Dynasty*\n*Imperial Decree*",

      "translated_text": "**Green Petition**\n\nExtolling the wondrous transformation of the august title, the hundred spirits converge in celebration; facing the Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Heavens, a single thought flows forth. Not merely to amplify the brilliance of the sacred rites, but also to manifest the majesty of divine favor. Thus, we perform the rites of purity and reverence, jointly expressing our private veneration.\n\nWe humbly pray that the sagely enterprise be upheld, jointly preserving the grand design for eternity; that the frontiers be tranquil and serene, guiding the people toward great peace; that the imperial heir inherit blessings, and all under heaven enjoy clarity, harmony, and prosperity.\n\n**Memorial from the Prefecture Requesting Imperial Incense**\n\nYour servant Li Wenfang, on behalf of Li Shouhao, the abbot and supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou, respectfully submits: This abode is the sacred site of the Divine Inspector’s residence, where the emperor is revered in the Benming Shenfu Hall. Each year, during the spring and autumn state *jiao* rituals, the local governor writes the imperial name on the memorial tablets. The decree states: *\"To pray for the well-being of all living beings and dispel calamities.\"*\n\nIn the first year of Xiangfu, it was decreed that imperial incense be bestowed upon the halls of this abbey. However, the abbey has not since petitioned for this privilege. We reflect that the incense offerings in the hall of blessings have been revered by successive sages; the bestowal of imperial incense and the establishment of *jiao* rituals to protect the state and pacify the realm have yielded manifest efficacy. The edicts and documents attesting to this are too numerous to count.\n\nRecently, when the prefectural authorities, concerned by the delayed auspicious snow, performed a *jiao* ritual, the response was immediate: a hundred thousand households were suffused with harmonious *qi*, and five centuries of blessings flowed as foretold. From Xiangfu to Jiaxi, whenever imperial incense was bestowed and *jiao* rituals held, divine responses followed. The throne once bestowed the honorific title *\"Miaohua\"* upon the Perfected Lord and conferred the imperial calligraphy *\"Sanqing Pavilion\"*, along with ordination certificates, aloeswood, camphor, altar consecrations, and silks for the *jiao* rituals to protect the frontiers and pray for an heir. The texts of these decrees remain preserved.\n\nYet, all previous bestowals of incense and *jiao* rituals were initiated by the prefectural authorities. Now, we humbly request that, in accordance with precedent, the prefecture memorialize the throne to revive these ancient rites. The details of the foregoing memorial must be submitted for imperial consideration.\n\nYour servant respectfully notes: The Taiping Xingguo Abbey is the seat of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Inspector, and from the Kaiyuan era of the Tang to the present dynasty, over five hundred years have passed, during which the deity’s responses have been manifold and imperial honors repeatedly bestowed. Since the founding of the dynasty, imperial incense has been granted annually as a regular observance. However, by the Longxing era, this practice fell into neglect.\n\nIn the second and fourth years of Jiaxi, the abbey’s supervisor, Xiong Shouzhong, petitioned, and the throne graciously bestowed the honorific *\"Miaohua\"* upon the Perfected Lord, along with imperial incense. Since then, no one from the abbey has petitioned, nor has the prefecture submitted memorials, thereby contravening the intent of successive dynasties to honor these rites and constituting a grave omission.\n\nRecently, when the auspicious snow was delayed last winter, your servant personally visited the shrine to pray for the people, and the response was immediate, as if echoing our pleas. The triple whiteness heralded a bountiful year. Given such manifest efficacy, it is fitting to report this in accordance with established protocol to glorify the divine favor.\n\nWe humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to issue a decree reviving the ancient rites of the dynasty, granting imperial incense to this abbey each year, and instructing that the *jiao* rituals be conducted in accordance with the directives issued in the gengzi year of Jiaxi. This memorial is respectfully submitted for imperial consideration, awaiting your sagely decree.\n\n**Fourth Year of Baoyou, First Month**\n\n**Imperial Incense Decree**\n\nBy order of the Ministry of Rites, in accordance with the memorial from Li Wenweng, Prefect of Jiangzhou, submitted on the eighth day of the second month of the fourth year of Baoyou, requesting the revival of the dynasty’s ancient rites by granting imperial incense annually to the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou for the performance of *jiao* rituals:\n\nThe matter was subsequently referred to the Ministry of Rites for verification of precedent and submitted to the Secretariat. Upon review, the Secretariat forwarded the matter to the Court of Imperial Sacrifices for thorough examination and clarification before reporting back to the ministry.\n\nThereafter, the Court of Imperial Sacrifices submitted: *\"Regarding the request in the memorial to revive the directives issued in the gengzi year of Jiaxi for the performance of *jiao* rituals, we now propose that the ministry report to the throne, instructing Jiangzhou to implement the directives in accordance with the precedents of the gengzi year of Jiaxi.\"*\n\nThe original memorial was forwarded to the ministry for submission to the throne. Upon review, the judgment was issued: *\"In accordance with the Court of Imperial Sacrifices’ submission, Jiangzhou is to implement the directives as originally decreed and report on their execution, with a copy to the Secretariat for reference.\"*\n\nThe ministry has reported this to the throne for consideration. The prefecture is to act accordingly, implementing the directives as originally decreed. The prefectural authorities have complied and reported back, and the abbey has acted in accordance with the directives.\n\nThereafter, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey submitted a report detailing the dates and precedents of the throne’s bestowals of incense and *jiao* rituals, requesting the prefecture to report to the ministry for verification of past examples and issuance of the appropriate directives:\n\n- **Third Year of Taiping Xingguo**: Spring and autumn *jiao* rituals; ordination certificates.\n- **Third Year of Taiping Xingguo**: Spring and autumn *jiao* rituals; ministry documents; three volumes of vegetarian feast accounts.\n- **Thirty-First Year of Shaoxing**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and prayer tablets.\n- **Second Year of Longxing**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and prayer tablets.\n- **Third Year of Duanping**: Memorial from the Ministry of Rites for *jiao* rituals to pray for harvests and dispel warfare; seven volumes of decrees and texts.\n- **First Year of Jiaxi**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals, and jade tablets to protect the frontiers and pray for an heir.\n- **Second Year of Jiaxi**: Bestowal of incense, *jiao* rituals to dispel warfare; decrees, silver, paper money, silks, and other items in three volumes and four pieces.\n- **First Year of Chunyou**: Bestowal of the honorific title for the Perfected Lord; decrees, prayer tablets, incense, abbey documents, silver, silks, and imperial edicts in four volumes and five pieces.\n\nHaving submitted the foregoing documents to the ministry for verification and issuance, the prefecture affirms their accuracy and humbly requests the issuance of directives for implementation.",

      "translated_text": "Awaiting the imperial directive, it is noted that Li Wenweng of Jiangzhou has submitted a petition requesting the revival of the former dynastic rites, the bestowal of imperial incense, and the performance of a *jiao* ritual at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou. Upon review, it is found that in previous reigns, imperial incense, calligraphic scrolls, ordination certificates, and silks were indeed bestowed. Now, in accordance with the petition of Li Shouhao, the abbey’s acting superintendent, and upon verification of the original imperial decree, this prefecture has directly submitted the request as per precedent. On the ninth day of the sixth month, the Three Departments jointly received the imperial edict, ordering that incense be bestowed upon Jiangzhou as before, to be delivered to the abbey for the *jiao* ritual, with the same provisions as those granted in the gengzi year of Jiaxi. The Imperial Pharmacy, the Palace Eunuch Directorate, the Hanlin Academy, and the Jiangzhou abbey are each to act accordingly.\n\nThe above is hereby issued to the Taiping Xingguo Abbey on Mount Lu.\n\nDated this day of the sixth month, the fourth year of Baoyou.\n\nBy imperial decree, Vice-Minister Li of the Bureau of Military Affairs is instructed: On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou shall conduct the state *jiao* ritual. Herewith are bestowed thirty taels of aloeswood, ten catties each of *jian* sandalwood and *jiangzhen* incense, to be used for the ritual offerings.

Mindful of the abbey where the Perfected Lord stores blessings and recalling the longstanding dynastic custom of bestowing imperial incense, I found that the abbey had failed to petition for its renewal, nor had the local authorities taken the initiative to request it. I thus urgently memorialized the throne and was graciously favored with an imperial response. By imperial decree, it is ordered that each year, thirty taels of aloeswood and ten catties each of *jian* sandalwood and *jiangzhen* incense be bestowed upon the Taiping Xingguo Abbey for the autumn *jiao* ritual on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. For future bestowals, these offerings shall serve to pray for the eternal mandate of Heaven, the protection of the state, the pacification of the frontiers, and the universal well-being of all living beings, that all may ascend to benevolence and longevity.\n\nNow, as the sacred precincts are prepared and the vermilion memorials laid forth, I humbly beseech the radiant imperial gaze to witness the sincerity of the Ninefold Palace. May the imperial favor be bestowed anew, upholding the annual rites. Through these meritorious acts, may abundant blessings be secured.\n\nTo His Imperial Majesty:\nMay your grand designs expand boundlessly, and your legacy endure through generations.

Yet owing to the provinces’ delayed petitions, the august observances of this sacred era have fallen into neglect.\n\nWith reverence, we recall how Your Imperial Majesty, ever steadfast in devotion, pursues goodness with unflagging diligence; how dew-drenched prayers ascend from the inner palace, where morning and evening rites are observed with scrupulous care; how the sun’s gaze alights upon the central realm, where solicitude for all within and beyond is earnestly expressed. Embracing the reverent hearts of successive dynasties, You have elevated the most wondrous transformations with exalted titles. Thus, in upholding these enduring rituals, we lodge our devotion in the offering of fragrant incense.\n\nMay the Perfected One, who surveys the Nine Heavens, grant that Your luminous scrutiny be justly reflected upon the throne. Yet now, the afflictions of Shu and Guang have deepened, and the wounds of Huai and Xiang fester. Flood and drought alternate, while troops and treasuries grow ever depleted.\n\nThis humble servant, entrusted with office and indebted to sovereign grace, gazes toward the vermilion steps to offer loyalty, and toward the Crimson Mound to beseech blessings. We humbly pray that the Emperor’s person enjoy longevity and joy, that the foundation of the state remain secure and strong; that the four seasons’ qi harmonize, bringing abundant harvests of grain; that the three frontiers stand firm, forever free from the peril of beacon fires; and that all the realm’s subjects equally partake in the Dao’s responsive grace.\n\n---\n\n**Respectfully Receiving the Court’s Bestowal of Funds for the Universal Salvation Jiao: A Secret Edict**\n\nRespectfully receiving the imperial decree: Since the warfare of last year, many loyal and valiant men have died in battle, and countless displaced souls have perished in untimely deaths.

A Universal Salvation Jiao shall be conducted to enable their transcendence.\n\nIn Sichuan, the rites shall be held at Chongqing; in the Two Guangs, at Mount Heng; and in Jiangnan and Jiangxi, at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou. At each of these three sites, a Jiao of 1,200 offerings shall be performed. For each location, the following shall be bestowed: 100 taels of aloeswood, 10 taels of borneol, 300 catties of *jiangzhen* incense, 100 catties of yellow wax, and 100,000 strings of official currency. Designated personnel and soldiers shall be dispatched to oversee the delivery, ensuring strict accountability and meticulous preparation.

The killing energy pierced the heavens, reeking of carnage, while their heroic souls, though cast upon the dew, grew only more resolute.\n\nYet we grieve that their forms have perished, and their sacrifice remains etched in our hearts.

Five hundred years later, blessings would extend to all living beings. Thus, the Nine Heavens’ Envoy Temple was built in Jiangzhou. The sagely emperors of our dynasty have held this deity in the highest esteem: Taizong bestowed a new plaque upon the abbey; Shenzong elevated the title to *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Perfected Lord*; Huizong presented a jade register, transforming the abbey into a palace. The emperors Gaozong and Xiaozong frequently dispatched officials to offer prayers for border security and the repulsion of warfare. Since His Majesty’s ascension, he has bestowed calligraphic works and imperial incense, honoring the deity with even greater reverence.\n\nLast autumn, when I was stationed here, the barbarian horses stealthily crossed the border. I received an edict to advance with the Yellow Banner to reinforce Hubei. Upon receiving the command, I set forth at once. Yet my authority in Fujian was inherently weak, and Jiangzhou, deemed an interior region, faced the enemy without generals or troops. To retreat and defend the central river would mean a city with low walls and shallow moats; to dispatch naval forces to Hubei would be thwarted by contrary winds; to reinforce Huangzhou with reinforcements would invite swift disaster. The people were restless, the soldiers’ morale low. The fate of the ancestral altars hung in the balance, and success was uncertain. Thus, I beseeched the Perfected Shrine to conduct a Great Universal Salvation Jiao of 3,600 offerings, praying for the nation’s protection and the repulsion of war. Thereupon, the winds shifted, and reinforcements arrived without incident. The deity’s manifest power demands our gratitude and repayment.\n\nI personally visited the abbey to fulfill the vow. Perusing the steles, I learned that the Perfected Spirit is also titled the Supreme Emperor of the Vermilion Mound, Inspector of the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, who determines the destinies, fortunes, and misfortunes of heaven and humanity. His dignity rivals that of the Heavenly Emperor. He governs the Nine Palaces, the Nine Provinces, and the celestial divisions of the Nine Stars. The cycles of 108 years are tied to the world’s fortunes, influencing its rise and fall—and our dynasty has received abundant blessings. When the rebel Zhang Yu of the Jianyan era attacked Jiangzhou, the city’s soldiers and civilians witnessed the Perfected Lord’s true form manifest in the clouds, assuming the shape of a dragon-horse. The rebels were swiftly annihilated. During the Kaixi era, when Wu Xi rebelled in Shu, General Jiang Jie of Kuizhou received a divine visitation, declaring that the Inspector had petitioned the Heavenly Emperor, and the rebels would face extermination. Now, as the reckless barbarians defy righteousness, we rely on unseen aid: the river’s surface is once more calm, and the southeast rests secure.\n\nToday marks the year *xinwei* of the Kaiyuan era, precisely five hundred years later, and the deity’s numinous efficacy shines as brightly as ever. Yet I humbly reflect: when the Divine Emperor Shenzong bestowed the title *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune*, it was by imperial edict. Later, Emperor Huizong, honoring his predecessor’s intent, inscribed it upon a jade register. All subsequent sagely emperors prefaced their blue-green memorials with “Your Majesty’s servant so-and-so.” During the Jiaxi era, the title was augmented with the characters *Wondrous Transformer*, but the Ministry of Rites, in a moment of oversight, issued only a decree of investiture, deviating from the precedents of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe eras. This may not fully reflect the enlightened age’s reverence for the sacred.\n\nI have appended copies of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe imperial edicts and registers for reference. I respectfully petition the court to submit this matter for deliberation by the relevant authorities, to add an eight-character honorific above the current title *Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, to confer a sacred register, to inscribe it upon fine jade, to revoke the original decree, and to deposit it in the Ministry of Rites’ archives. This would not only dispel the scourge of war and inaugurate an era of prosperity, securing the nation’s destiny for eternity and extending the emperor’s longevity without end, but also ensure that the sagely emperors’ venerable rites remain unbroken—a boon beyond measure for the ancestral altars and all living beings.",

      "translated_text": "On the __ day of the fifth month of the first year of Jingding (1260), Vice Minister Lu respectfully submits a second memorial petitioning for the conferral of an imperial investiture register.\n\nYour servant Jing Si has ascertained that the *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer* of the Nine Heavens’ Inspection Bureau at Taiping Xingguo Abbey in this prefecture—when examined against historical records—first manifested numinous signs in a dream during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, with a prophecy that its blessings would extend to all living beings five hundred years hence. When cross-referenced with stele inscriptions, it bears the title *Vermilion Numinous Supreme Emperor*, charged with inspecting the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths, governing the Nine Palaces, Nine Provinces, and the celestial divisions, as well as the cycles of yang’s ninefold and hundred-sixfold reckonings. According to ritual canons, since the Taizong Emperor bestowed the present abbey’s name, the Shenzong Emperor issued a decree advancing its title to *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune*, and the Huizong Emperor presented a jade register, elevating the abbey to a palace. The Gaozong and Xiaozong courts both dispatched officials to offer prayers for frontier affairs. Since Your Majesty’s ascension, the honorific *Wondrous Transformer* has been added, an imperial inscription from the Three Clarities Pavilion bestowed, incense offerings made, and jiao rites conducted with vermilion memorials and blue-green prayers. The reverence accorded it stems from its most exalted and substantiated efficacy.\n\nDuring the Jianyan era, when Zhang Yu besieged the city, the deity manifested clouds to annihilate the rebels. In the Kaixi reign, when Wu Xi rebelled in Shu, a descending brush executed the traitor. This year, when northern raiders entered the borders of Ruichang County in this prefecture, they were as if restrained and could not advance. Its unseen protection of the region has preserved countless lives. Moreover, like timely sweet rains and seasonable snows, it dispels epidemics, relieves famine, safeguards the frontiers, averts warfare, shields the state, and succors the people—its blessings are most abundant.\n\nYour servant Jing reflects that now, as the great fortune turns anew and august rites are fully revived, even minor deities receive universal veneration. How much more should the highest spirits be exalted, that the *Inspecting Perfected* may extend their blessings to the farthest reaches of the realm? From the Xinwei year of Kaiyuan (711) to the present, the five-hundred-year cycle has come full circle. Though the transformations of fortune bear no name, how could the deity’s manifest or hidden responses differ in the completeness of its titles and registers?\n\nThe two previous courts’ decrees and registers accorded it the rites due a celestial spirit; the successive sagely emperors’ memorials prefaced its name with “Your Majesty’s servant.” In the Jiaxi reign, though an honorific was added, the Ministry of Rites failed to verify precedents, merely issuing a decree by edict, which fell short of former standards. Since imperial incense has been bestowed and state jiao rites solemnly conducted each spring and autumn, when the military commissioner presents prayers, the response has been insufficient to fulfill the people’s devotion.\n\nIt is humbly hoped that Your Sagely Compassion will command the Ministry of State Affairs to add an eight-character honorific above the current title *True Lord Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, and to consult the memorial submitted by former prefect, Academician Shi Yan, which appended copies of the Yuanfeng and Zhenghe imperial edicts and registers. Let the relevant authorities examine ritual precedents, confer a sacred register, inscribe it upon fine jade, so as to fulfill the successive courts’ reverent devotion and approach the Nine Heavens’ august bestowal of grace.\n\nThis matter requires Your Majesty’s attention.\n\nRespectfully submitted on the __ day of the ninth month of the first year of Jingding (1260).",

      "translated_text": "**Memorial on the Petition for the Conferral of an Augmented Honorific Title**\n\nWhen Acting Prefect Yin Leirui was temporarily assigned to this post, he conducted sacrifices to the mountains and rivers within the prefecture’s bounds. Searching the ritual canons and consulting the elders, he learned that the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence*, who appeared in a dream to the Radiant Emperor, established a shrine in this land—upright and unified, bestowing blessings upon the people below. For five hundred years, his presence has endured: in the Shaoxing era, clouds manifested and Zhang Yu was extinguished; in the Kaixi era, a divine brush descended and Hao Xi was executed. When barbarian scouts filled the riverbanks and the prefecture clung to its isolated walls in desperate defense, the enemy, upon nearing the borders, fled in panic and disarray. These are recent and undeniable proofs of his efficacy.\n\nUpon examination, we find that successive sagely emperors of our dynasty have bestowed the highest honors with utmost sincerity. Though the god’s beneficence endures to this day, his title remains unchanged from old—perhaps this is not in accord with ritual propriety. Former prefects, Academician Shi and Academician Lu, both previously memorialized, petitioning for the conferral of an honorific to accord with the people’s wishes, yet no imperial response was received.\n\nNow, as the era of Great Fortune unfolds and the earth mirrors the heavens, the hundred spirits receive their mandates, and their divine merits shine forth—how can their exaltation be delayed? It is hoped that the court will review and deliberate upon this matter.\n\n**Fifth day of the fifth month, second year of Jingding (1261)**\n*Memorandum from the Jiangzhou Provincial Surveillance Commission*\n*To the Pacification Commissioner of Jiangxi and Prefect of Jiangzhou:*\n\nOn the fifth day of this month, we received a dispatch from the Ministry of Rites at the imperial court, transmitting a document dated the fourth day of the eighth month of the second year of Jingding, approved by the Secretariat and forwarded from the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. The document cites a memorial from Yin Leirui, newly appointed Gentleman for Thorough Service and concurrently Academician of the Hall of Illustrious Strategy, now Prefect of Jiangzhou.\n\nUpon arriving in the prefecture, I found the local gentry and commoners united in petition, declaring that in the previous year, when the Tartar bandits secretly crossed the river and infiltrated Jiangxi, the entire prefecture was preserved in peace—all due to the blessings of the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, whose shrine on Mount Lu bestows grace. They beseech that this be made known and that his honorific title be augmented. Furthermore, former officials, Grand Academician Shi and Academician Lu, had previously memorialized the throne; their original petitions are hereby resubmitted. It is hoped that the court will review these repeated appeals and deign to add two characters to the existing six-character title, while also consulting the ritual precedents of the Zhenghe era and conferring a jade register.\n\nThis matter has been forwarded for judgment. The Court of Imperial Sacrifices, upon investigation, notes that in the sixth month of the first year of Jingding, it received a memorial from Jiangzhou, petitioning for the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer*, enshrined at the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou, to have an eight-character honorific appended to his title. In that same month, this court proposed the title *True Lord of the Nine Heavens Who Gathers Intelligence, Responsive to the Dao, Guardian of Fortune, Wondrous Transformer, Assistant in Upholding Rightness*, to be honored with a jade register, in accordance with the previously issued imperial decree. The matter was duly memorialized to the Secretariat in the sixth month of that year. We now respectfully submit this to the Ministry of State Affairs, humbly requesting that the court issue instructions in accordance with the aforementioned memorial for implementation in this prefecture.\n\nThe matter was subsequently endorsed and forwarded to the Ministry of Rites, which issued orders to this prefecture for compliance. Accordingly, this directive is hereby transmitted to the prefecture. You are to carefully review the contents of this document and act in accordance with the instructions therein. The approved directives are to be presented to the prefectural authorities for deliberation. It is proposed that a notice be issued to the Taiping Abbey, and a copy be forwarded to the Surveillance Commission for record, to ensure proper execution.\n\n**Eighteenth day of the eleventh month, second year of Jingding (1261)**\n*Decree on the Conferral of an Augmented Honorific*",

One day, a youth dressed in flowing robes and a *zhangfu* cap came to visit. His discourse was refined, and he delighted in discussing antiquity, the present age, and the learning of immortals. Master Kang found him extraordinary and treated him with increasing warmth. Thus passed several years, yet his name remained unknown. After prolonged association, Master Kang remarked, “I have long been familiar with your noble bearing, yet dare not inquire your name, nor do I know your dwelling.”\n\nThe youth replied, “I am Liu Yue, residing to the left of this mountain. If you do not disdain my humble abode, I hope you will visit.” He added, “At the mountain’s base lies a stone about three feet high; knock upon it, and we shall meet.”\n\nMaster Kang followed his instructions and, arriving at the mountain’s base, saw the stone. Upon knocking, it suddenly opened, revealing double doors to a grotto. A young servant welcomed him, and after ten-odd steps, two azure-clad attendants bearing crimson staffs led the way. Gradually, pavilions and terraces came into view, their gold and jade hues intermingling, while rare birds and strange beasts, exotic flowers and trees, filled the scene. A Perfected One, crowned with a jade diadem and girded with a vermilion sash and sword, came forth to greet him.\n\nMaster Kang, realizing this was no mortal realm, wished to take up residence. The Perfected One, divining his intent, said, “Your hidden merits are not yet complete; a future meeting may be expected. One day, you shall follow me to the Turtle Palace of Penglai or the Crimson Towers of Red City—it will not be late.” They drank three cups of jade wine and a sip of the Elixir of Longevity before he departed. Turning back, the great stone appeared as before.\n\nOn another day, he knocked again, but there was no response. A pavilion was later built upon the stone, named “Immortal Stone.” The characters “Liu the Immortal” naturally appeared upon it, and the remains of the abbey’s triple gate may still be seen today.\n\n*From the* Record of Liu’s Immortal Stone.\n\n**Zhang Yunsou’s** *Southern Exile Record* **states:**\nThere was a Master Kang of the Zhou who built his hut upon this mountain, hence the name “Kang’s Hut.” Located thirty *li* south of the prefecture, one passes Sweet Pear Lake and follows the banks of the Mi River for about ten *li*, ascending and descending. A mountain stream flows north, emerging from the Qianxi Academy. After several more *li*, one reaches New Bridge, where forests flank both sides, the sound of water delightfully clear, and the peaks rise steeply. Crossing Snake Ridge, one arrives at Taiping Xingguo Abbey, the former temple of the Tang dynasty’s Nine Heavens’ Investigating Envoy. During the Xining era, the Perfected Lord Who Responds to the Origin and Preserves the Mandate was enfeoffed, and the temple was expanded into an abbey. Its scale is grand, stretching across valleys and streams, with kitchens, refectories, and blessings flowing in a circuit of water. The hall bears the imperial calligraphy of Emperor Yuan Zong, lacquered plaques, and ink inscriptions. There is also a life-sized bronze statue of the imperial visage, bestowed by the imperial brother Feng, with a hall plaque in gold characters and a vermilion inscription. The golden doors are sealed, and it is seldom seen. Additionally, three sets of golden-painted immortal robes were bestowed. Outside the hall, at the base of the steps, stands a stone called “Liu’s Immortal Stone,” where Master Kang knocked to keep his appointment with Liu the Immortal.\n\n**Hu Chongzhen Meets Lü Dongbin**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Hu Yongzong, styled Chongzhenzi, renounced the world in his youth and devoted himself to cultivation. During the Xining era, a Daoist in tattered robes and worn shoes, who called himself Hui, abruptly entered the treasury hall as if no one were present. Other Daoists ignored him, but Hu alone bowed and seated him in a small chamber, treating him with courteous regard, astonished by his transcendent demeanor. After requesting wine and drinking twice, Hui invited Hu to drink at an inn, but Hu declined due to the lateness of the hour. Hui stroked his beard, laughed, and departed.\n\nThe next morning, Hu entered the city to pay respects to the prefect. Arriving at the gate before it opened, he saw the Daoist emerging from the city, smiling as he looked back. The gatekeepers remarked, “Before the third watch, a Daoist named Hui waited here for the gate to open—we know not who he is.” Hu found this strange.\n\nYears later, a man with a hempen belt and two gourds, calling himself “Guest of the Great Song,” visited Hu at the abbey. Their conversation was refined. Hu asked, “What are these gourds for?” He replied, “My luggage.” Upon pouring them out, they contained gold and silver. He asked if Hu desired them, but Hu answered that he wished only for the Way of longevity. The guest took out fragments of silver to buy wine, and as they drank, he orally transmitted the supreme Dao.\n\nAt dusk, he cut into the earth with a knife, poured wine to rinse his mouth, mixed the spittle with soil, and exhaled upon it to form ink. Tossing it onto the table, it rang with a metallic sound. He told Hu, “Consuming this will cure illness and lead to immortality.” After drinking again, Hu became drunk and collapsed. When he awoke, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and where the earth had been cut, a spring welled forth. The guest had vanished.\n\nHu ground the ink into wine and drank it, and his chronic ailments were instantly cured. Though over seventy, his appearance was like a maiden’s, and his capacity for wine remained unchanged. Gradually, he grew weary of the mortal world. One day, he left a poem, shed his form, and departed.\n\nToday, the abbey’s “Ink Immortal Spring” may be cupped and drunk; its taste is sweet, and it never runs dry in winter or summer.

He recited the *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure for Salvation of All*, entering profound stillness to grasp its essence. During the Chongning era, he suddenly drank water without cease for days, then said to his fellow Daoist Lü Shizhong: “The mortal world is not worth clinging to—I shall soon depart.” Lü took it as a jest. At midnight, Qi sat cross-legged, raised his hand toward the candle, and said: “Let this serve as witness. Yet this matter is arduous indeed.” Lü remained uncomprehending and went to sleep soundly.

They roamed the mountains together. Bi sensed his extraordinary nature and wished to become his disciple. The fangshi silently understood his intent and said: “In cultivating the Dao, refining the spirit and nurturing qi is paramount; alchemical texts are but stepping stones to enter the Way. If you sever worldly distractions and refine your spirit and qi with precision, you will naturally commune with the Perfected and attain numinous insight.” He then stood by a stream, pointed at the water, and told Bi: “When water is still, its form is straight; when the mind is tranquil, the spirit is at peace. You must take this as your mirror.” He then bestowed upon Bi an elixir, saying: “One day, we shall meet again at the foot of Shengzhi Peak.” With a bow, he departed, vanishing without a trace. Bi returned to the mountain that very day and, by chance, found the position of vice-abbot vacant. The prefectural authorities appointed him to fill the post.",

      "translated_text": "The Daoist of this abbey, Wang Bingwen, styled Yanheng, journeyed to the capital after attaining the Dao. At that time, the imperial court was constructing the Divine Empyrean Longevity Abbey and bestowed upon him a purple robe, appointing him as Master of Ceremonies. Suddenly, a fangshi arrived for a visit and, seeing a copy of the *Zhouyi* on his desk, cast divinations, saying: \"This place shall face military calamity. You are not among those fated for it—best to avoid it.\" Thereupon, he imparted the essentials of *storing the Three and guarding the One*, along with the secrets of the Yellow Emperor and Bian Que. Wang then resigned his post and returned to the mountains.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Jianyan era, this abbey was destroyed by rebel troops. The following year, after the bandits retreated, none took responsibility for its restoration. Wang thus assumed the vice-abbot’s duties and, amid the ashes, oversaw its reconstruction for several years. The halls were adorned in gold and azure, gleaming anew. He then resigned from abbey affairs and secluded himself at home for over thirty years. His residence was named the *Hall of the Three Ones*, and he styled himself *Master of the Three Ones*. Daily, he studied the Daoist canon, delved into esoteric secrets, and devoted himself to medicine, harboring no other passions.\n\nOn the night of the Lantern Festival in the bingxu year of the Qiandao era, he dreamed of a divine messenger who declared: \"The Supreme Emperor commands you to preside over the Great Cleansing Grotto of Golden Flower. He bestows upon you a *returning-soul elixir* to restore your spirit and replenish your primordial qi. You shall be escorted into the grotto by divine radiance, a white steed, and all the officials of the celestial bureaus.\" With these words, he awoke.\n\nThe next morning, he told his disciples: \"The mortal world is no longer fit to dwell in—I shall depart.\" He then entrusted his works—fourteen fascicles of the *Collected Manifestations of Sagely Rule*, the *Divine Resolutions of the Perfected Lord of West Mountain* (the very divinations now consulted in the Inquiry Hall, renowned for their extraordinary efficacy), the *Pulse Secrets of Perfect Wholeness*, and the *Purple Court Secrets of the Morning Star*—to his dharma-heirs, Qin Zhixiang and others.\n\nOn the first day of the second month, after burning incense and changing into fresh robes, he passed away in serene composure. The prefect of this prefecture, Tang Fuwen (styled Wenruo), composed a eulogy in his honor:\n\n*\"I have heard that true persons sleep without dreams.\nThose who dream are suspect of false transmission.\nYet to dismiss dreams as mere delusion may not be so—\nfor in dreams, one may be charged to find a worthy minister,\nor awaken to the strains of celestial music in the Emperor’s presence.\nHuman life is like a dream—truly, it defies words.\nWithin dreams, there are yet deeper dreams.\nMaster of the Three Ones, your celestial mandate was fulfilled.\nAs you departed, your dream dissolved into transformation,\nsilently aligning with the true essence.\nThe Emperor commanded, bestowing upon you\nthe golden grotto’s return to the origin.\nI would ask you: what was the cause?\nTruth and illusion converge—\na hundred years pass in the blink of an eye.\nTranscendent, you departed,\na white steed soaring lightly.\"*\n\nLao Pu Qikuan praised his spirit in verse:\n\n*\"Unseen to the eye, unheard to the ear,\nyet within, an image—strikingly like you.\nForced depictions, labored and strained,\nfall short in capturing even a fraction.\nEver present at the brows and lashes,\nbound yet unbound,\nlike still water, like drifting clouds.\"*\n\nFrom the *Stele Record of This Abbey*\n*Huang the Perfected One’s Release by Means of the Corpse*",

      "translated_text": "The abbey’s Daoist Huang Zhiwei, styled Mingdao, was of a serene and unadorned nature, his form tall and imposing. During the Yuanfeng era, he served as an attendant in the Hall of Enlightenment, tending the incense and flame. One day, Master Cui of Mount Qian, the Embodied Dao, came to visit and spoke of the wonders of the Mud-Pill Palace of Ten Thousand Spirits and the single grain of the elixir knife. Thereupon, he transmitted to him the Way of the Nine Grains of Divine Nourishment and the principles of the Golden Liquid’s descent into the radiant realm. From that time onward, Huang wandered as if in a daze, his conduct unconstrained and erratic. The people of the time called him \"Huang the Windblown.\" He then composed the *Song of Huang’s Madness*, which is recorded in his collected works.\n\nBy nature, he loved wine; whenever drunk, he would sing loudly, and after singing, he would fall into wild abandon. Often, he stood on the Bridge of Morning Audience before the abbey, shouting vehemently as if rebuking someone. His sleeves were patched a hundred times, and he paid no heed to modesty, remaining indifferent to the cold of deep winter or the heat of midsummer. When scholars or officials offered him gifts, he would scatter them at once. Sometimes he dwelled in the mountains, sometimes he wandered through the cities. He always carried two cloth sacks, into which he haphazardly stuffed cakes, medicines, and the like, yet they emitted no foul odor—he called them his \"brocade fragrance.\"\n\nOnce, a great snow fell, turning the forests and valleys white, yet the roof of the master’s dwelling alone remained free of snow. He would often point to the altar by the wall of his chamber and tell people, \"This is the path by which I traveled to Shu.\" Though he had never studied books, his conversations often touched upon historical records. Though untrained in literary arts, his utterances were always lofty and wondrous. He associated with Cai Zigao of Monkey Creek, Sima Zhibai, Cui Fengzi, and Gao Chijiao.\n\nThe master was fond of sighing deeply, and when he sighed, the sound would continue without pause. In the late Chongning era, though he was over ninety years old, his appearance was like that of a maiden, his skin smooth as jade, and his mad demeanor unchanged. His capacity for wine had not diminished. At the end of the Xuanhe era, an imperial summons was issued, but he refused to answer. When officials pressed him, he reached Jiujiang and said, \"Now there are two emperors—why should I go?\" Soon after, when Emperor Qinsheng ascended the throne, an amnesty was proclaimed, and the decree reached the abbey.\n\nBefore the day of the conflagration, the master, in the Hall of Visitation, planted mugwort and reeds, singing, *\"Next year it will end, next year it will end.\"* The following year, when the rebel Han Shiqing’s cavalry indeed burned the abbey, it was on the very day he had planted the mugwort. His predictions of fortune and misfortune were all borne out with precision.\n\nThe master ascended in feathered transformation, seated beside the abbey.",

      "translated_text": "Several years later, a traveler returned from Shu and said: \"Huang Fengzi is now in Shu. We met in Chengdu, and he entrusted me with this letter for his family.\" The assembly was skeptical. Upon opening the letter, it bore the name of a Daoist mother who had perished in the chaos of war. They then opened the coffin to inspect it, finding only his garments and shoes.\n\n---\n\nFrom *Records of the Yellow Perfected One*\n\n**Liu Xugu’s Seated Transformation**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Liu Lie, styled Xuguzi, was born under an auspicious dream his mother had received. As he grew, he harbored lofty aspirations, studying in the mountains and keeping his associations pure. Nobles and officials marveled at his countenance, which bore the unspoiled air of high antiquity, and declared him a vessel of the Dao for future generations.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Shaoxing era, he built a thatched hermitage and named it *Zhenyi* (\"True Unity\"). Daily, he sat in meditation, perusing the Daoist canon and histories, committing all to memory at a glance. Scholars and officials sought his acquaintance. Master Zhu of Hui’an (Zhu Xi) discussed the *Book of Changes* with him, debating the principles of returning elixirs. A poem reads:\n\n*Carefully reading the hundred chapters on returning elixirs,*\n*The master’s brush, too, spoke at length.*\n*The primal mechanism lies hidden in scriptures’ search,*\n*Yet the supreme principle dwells in the space between eye and lash.*\n*One horse may yet be harnessed for my journey,*\n*Five sprouts should grow from my own garden.*\n*Tomorrow, sober, I descend the mountain—*\n*With whom shall I discuss these words again?*\n\nZhang Xiaoxiao (Zhang Jiucheng) left a poem upon their first meeting. Other verses praised his retreat:\n\n*A blessed land conceals a lesser grotto-heaven,*\n*Where immortals refine their spirits in seclusion.*\n*Only Xugu finds delight in this realm,*\n*Mastering the fire’s timing in perfect accord with nature.*\n\nMinisters Luo Dian, Wang Yan, Cao Xun, Zhou Shun of Fengxi, and Yue Fu of the Ministry of Rites—all renowned figures—visited to discuss the *Book of Changes* and exchanged fine verses. These are recorded in *Anthology of Eminent Worthies of This Abbey, Vol. 2*.\n\nBy the first year of the Longxing era, he had completed commentaries on the *Zhouyi* and *Liuren*, distilling their mechanisms into a single work. He journeyed to the capital to present it. The emperor summoned him for audience, inquired about the Dao, and hosted a banquet in his honor. His poems—*At the Imperial Command at Sanmao Abbey*, *Giving Thanks for the Gift of Wine*, and *Petitioning to Return to the Mountains*—are preserved in his collected works.\n\nLater, he dwelled in the mountains for over a decade. In the ninth year of the Qiandao era, in the sixth month, he abstained from food for over forty days, drinking only jade-like water. On the fourteenth day of the seventh month, he personally delivered twenty-five volumes of *Dengzhen Yinjue* and nine volumes of *Shangjing* to the wooden repository of the abbey’s records. The next day, on the Zhongyuan Festival, he left a final poem and ode in his own hand, which read:\n\n*Xuguzi, about to shed his form and abandon the world,*\n*Sweeps away worldly ties to hasten toward the vast expanse of mist and clouds,*\n*There to merge with the Dao in profound unity.*\n\nOn the sixteenth night, he walked under the moon to the summit of Mount Lu’s Keniu Cave, sat in meditation, and transformed.\n\nHis works—*A Hundred Chapters on Returning Elixirs*, miscellaneous writings, poetry, *Exegesis of the Zhouyi*, and *Preface to the Mountain Studio’s Edition of the Book of Changes* by Shangshu—along with *Comprehensive Diagrams of Successive Dynasties’ Rulers and Ministers*—circulated widely. An inscription by Jiang Yongshe in the hall’s stele records this, drawn from *Biographies of the Xugu Father and Son* and *Records of This Abbey*.\n\n---\n\n**The Founding Master Liu’s Transformation**\nThe abbey’s Daoist Liu Dazhang, styled Kaizu, was a native of Hukou in Jiangzhou, born in the *guihai* year of the Yuanfeng era. From childhood, he studied in the mountains. During Emperor Huizong’s reign, he was tested on the scriptures and ordained as a Daoist, taking Yang Yiyi as his master.\n\nWhen the Jianyan era’s warfare erupted, he fled to Poyang. Later, returning home to visit his parents, he heard that the abbey had been entirely consumed by flames. Unable to advance or retreat, he settled with his disciple Luo Shouming in a deserted house in the southeastern corner of Chaoyi. There, they reverently maintained the incense and offerings of the Visitation Hall, weeping as they recounted their plight and vowing to propagate the Daoist teachings and restore its profound merit.\n\nLiu was a man of pure integrity, owning no excess possessions, and keeping his associations unsullied. The villagers praised him. His Way flourished as he aided others and benefited all things. He tore down the thatched hut and rebuilt it anew, naming it *Longde Hermitage*—the present-day Xihu Daoist Abbey.

When he finished, he summoned his disciple to his side and spoke to him of the Dao of transcending life and death. Then, with composure, he said: \"Tend to the incense and offerings.\" He stood, and in that moment, transformed. His countenance remained as though alive, and those who witnessed it gathered like a wall.\n\n*From the Annals of the Original Abbey: The Seated Transcendence of Patriarch Luo*\n\nDaoist Luo Shouming of the Original Abbey, styled Deguang, was the foremost disciple of Liu Dazhang. Born in the Jiawu year of the Zhenghe era in Pengze of Jiangzhou, he followed his master in fleeing to Poyang during the Jianyan period, returning with him to their hometown. Upon hearing that the Original Abbey had been reduced to ashes, he and his master took residence in Longde Hermitage. His Dao was the familial transmission of the robe and bowl. Daily, he purchased creatures of flight and fin to set them free, never faltering in this practice.\n\nOne day, gravely ill, he summoned his five disciples—Yu Huaide, Yang Huaiyu, Li Huaizhi, Pan Huaixin, and Liu Huainen—and took up his brush to write a verse. Continuing, he said: \"When I am sick, it is not inauspicious; when I speak of death, it is not death. If you encounter the Perfected Lü, then it is my good fortune.\" The original manuscript remains preserved in the Original Abbey.\n\nBefore long, his illness abated, and he returned to the abbey. There, on the former site of the Yellow Perfected’s sanctuary, he established a new Daoist cloister, naming it *Yangzheng Hermitage*. Taking the Yellow Perfected’s Daoist title, it was later renamed *Yellow Immortal Abbey*.\n\nPatriarch Luo lived to a great age. Each day, he burned incense and recited scriptures, never engaging in frivolous associations. One day, he entered the hall, arranged his robe, and sat in full-lotus posture. As the assembly began their meal, he remained motionless. Upon closer inspection, he had already transcended in seated meditation. Truly, this fulfilled his words of \"inauspicious sickness and auspicious death.\" How extraordinary!\n\nThe following day, a resident of West Lake dreamed of the Patriarch clad in purple, preceded by two azure-clad attendants bearing ceremonial staffs. He recognized the inscription above: \"Immortal Official of Huotong Grotto-Heaven.\" Patriarch Luo was interred to the left of the abbey. The abbey’s overseer, Hu Baoqing, lifted the coffin and declared: \"Do not disturb his truth with chaos, nor obstruct his Dao with wealth and honor.\" Though he left no miraculous form to abide in the world, he achieved the merit of liberation through seated transcendence.\n\nThe former hermitage at West Lake flourished with incense offerings, surpassing all former days.\n\n*From the Annals of the Original Abbey: Record of Facts Concerning the Visitation Perfected Lord of Mount Lu’s Taiping Xingguo Abbey, Scroll Five—End.*",

      "translated_text": "**Stele Inscription for the Temple of the Nine Heavens Envoys, with Preface**\n\n*Composed by Li Chi, a humble scholar of the Eastern Mountains of Huangmei County in Qizhou*\n\nAccording to the *Record of Facts* sent by Wang Ruan, Prefect of Fuzhou and former resident of De’an County in Jiangzhou: During the Kaiyuan era, the Tang Emperor Minghuang dreamed of a divine being who called himself the \"Envoy of Mount Lu\" and requested the establishment of a temple. Imperial edicts were issued to prefectures, commanding local scholars to compose stele inscriptions for the Envoy. Of the 681 authors, only this text was selected for use. Yet when summoned, the author did not attend. The original inscription in the abbey’s records contained only 551 characters. In the fifth year of the Chunyou reign (1315), Minister Cheng Cangzhou of the Secretariat recovered the full text—1,772 characters in total. However, the character *chi* (沘) here differs from the original, so both versions are preserved. For further details, see Minister Cheng’s postscript.\n\nWe reverently examine the classics: The *Book of Changes* states, *\"The interplay of yin and yang is called the Dao; the unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the divine.\"* The Dao gives birth to the Three, blending and evolving in profound transformation. The divine, attaining unity, mysteriously abides in tranquil obscurity. How majestic is the Great Origin, its distant subtleties transcending all! It governs the utmost of creation and transformation—how could it not be supremely venerated?\n\nIn the Later Tang, successive sagely emperors radiated great brilliance from beginning to end. At the noon of Lu Xi’s yang, their light illuminated the jade capital; wielding the mandate of primal destiny, they inscribed prosperity upon the tripod’s tally. White clouds stood solitary in lofty peaks, while purple auroras spanned a thousand ages, and the sun soared through the Han Valley.\n\nOur Emperor of Divine Martiality in the Kaiyuan era, encompassing the heavens and receiving the celestial mandate, held the profound mystery of the Dark Pearl and cast aside treasured riches. He expounded the supreme Dao in the realm of the formless and untraceable, dissolving the stagnation of miscellaneous doctrines—this is the first mark of sageliness. In the reverent rituals of the ancestral temple, he purified teachings, his filial piety and fraternal love shining brightly, so that heaven and earth looked up in emulation—this is the second mark of divinity. He returned the instruments of war to the three agricultural seasons, and with the might of bow and arrow, the divine judged the six directions—this is the third mark of martial prowess. Discerning the changes of the times through celestial patterns, while common people remained mired in mediocrity, none could ascend to his sagely insight—this is the fourth mark of civil wisdom.\n\nThus, his spirit soared beyond forms, his gaze fixed upon lofty renown. He exhorted offerings to the *River Chart*, and the numinous paid homage to the Sea Lord. The heart of Yao was illuminated, as if perceiving the subtle signs of the lotus stalk; the eyes of the Xuanyuan Emperor governed brightness, bending the banner to the thatched courtyard. Therefore, Yu expanded the land, and Xia received jade from heaven. He received the rare treasures of the Queen Mother of the West and presented his accomplishments to the Eastern Empress. The Five Dragons advanced the calendar, surpassing the lofty lineage of Liangfu; the Eight Steeds roamed in majesty, shaming the crudeness of Kunlun’s peaks. The celestial vault revolved above, mountains and hills surged below, while the successive sages dwelled in communion with the immortals, their blessings converging.\n\nEmperor Wen embodied righteousness, Emperor Wu bore the celestial chart—the flourishing of the supreme Dao has a long and venerable history. Since the blessings of the Hua region were offered, sagely virtue has endured through the ages. Golden tablets transmitted scriptures, and pearls flowed with the essence of nectar. The princess, through heavenly compassion, entered the Dao, embracing transformation like the lotus; the imperial librarian, as a royal prince, left the household, cultivating the fragrant zhi and mu herbs. The Northern Mystery inspired thoughts of the immortal ranks, while the Southern Elixir sought the causes of supreme attainment. The sagely lineage, though devoted to non-action, found its expression here, gathering the sacred peaks. The abodes of the Perfected Lords and the palaces of the Dao shone forth, their temples established to secretly assist the divine lineage.\n\nAmong the two mountains, Qingcheng and Mount Lu, stand as the foremost of the peaks that aid the mandate. The *Records of the Immortal Elder* and the *Secret Teachings of the Perfected Lord*, the numinous offices of the Envoys, are clearly discerned in the unseen. Their names inscribed in the Five Methods, they rise above the Three Demons. Though the towering peaks may suffer erosion, they do not falter in their abundance; though the valleys endure cold and heat, they invariably align with the seasons of humanity.\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the eighth month in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era (731), a resplendent edict was issued: *\"The Temple of the Elder of Qingcheng Mountain and the Temple of the Envoy of Mount Lu shall follow the precedent of the Five Sacred Peaks’ Perfected Lords’ Temples. Five virtuous Daoist priests shall be selected to perform rituals and offerings. The local authorities shall choose those of evident Daoist attainment to serve in perpetuity. Their names shall be reported through the proper channels, and temple envoys shall be appointed. Within the temples, the true portraits of the Envoys shall be established, and rituals of memorial, jiao offerings, and fasting shall be conducted, ensuring grand observances in the Daoist abbeys.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang Pinggong, hailing from the Qin capital, proclaimed the Dao’s principles in the Jiang region. His temple was adorned with resplendent colors, and he was bestowed with the rites of dark tablets. Arriving in a four-horse carriage, his light illuminated the cloudy cliffs.\n\nDu Hu Zheng, Military Commissioner of Jiangzhou and Prefect of the region, governed Chaisang with steadfast virtue, his reputation long established. Observing the armory of the times, he inherited the firmness of literary tradition. He began the construction of the fortress city, his efforts ever more vigorous, his grand designs surpassing all in elegance, his ambitions flourishing in abundance.\n\nYang Chuyu, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Acting Prefectural Administrator; Huangfu Chuyu, Acting Prefectural Marshal; and Wei Chang, Magistrate of Xunyang County—all revered the sagely goodness and deliberated upon the sacred precinct. Daoists and laypeople alike devoted themselves with utmost sincerity, their hidden blessings gathering in marvel.\n\nAt the outset of the earthworks, a rain of dust and haze arose, yet in an instant, the skies cleared, and rosy clouds adorned the horizon. When the auspicious tortoise was set to establish the foundation, and the golden rainbow spanned the journey, the gloom of yin dissipated, and the remnants of darkness were dispelled. Gazing into the mysterious void, they reverently contemplated the imperial Dao. Fragrance filled the air, purity prevailed, and the rituals of memorial and jiao offerings lifted their spirits. The six directions were profound and obscure, yet in a single night, all became radiant.\n\nSuddenly, from the midst of the empty sky, a divine radiance burst forth, its brilliance adorning the ninefold streams and illuminating the thousand-fathom heights. The officials prostrated themselves, and the people and clerks all beheld the spectacle. In ancient times, when the celestial spirits descended upon Zhou, they were greeted with the *Cloud Gate* dance; when the divine light shone upon Han, the *Great Unity* ascended the inner chamber. Yet here, as the qi of the northern lands converged, the southern realm transformed in splendor. Though frost and sleet weighed upon the land, and the people lamented the bitter cold...",

      "translated_text": "Thus the Master of the Law, with earnest devotion, ascended the immortal courts, wielding the authority of the state’s mandate. Thereupon, the depths of winter grew mild, and the crimson sun shone bright in a cloudless sky, harmonizing the hidden and the manifest, and bestowing ease upon those who toiled unto exhaustion. All things turned to advantage, and all rejoiced in the advent of blessings.\n\nThey then divined a propitious site in the sacred outskirts and forthwith established a numinous precinct. The peaks rose and fell like undulating ridges, their verdant pines and cliffs steeped in emerald hues. They summoned timber from the gates of Ying and drew fine wood from the Jing Mountains’ ravines. They hewed the towering cliffs and encircled the grounds with long walls. Vermilion walls stood in ordered rows like strings of coins, while cinnabar pillars rested upon embroidered plinths. Three chambers and four boundaries were adorned with resplendent paintings and carved beams; the eight directions and nine corners bore suspended bells and intricately wrought balustrades. Rainbow beams spanned the halls, and wind-borne windows supported the lintels. Inverted well-tiles bore patterns of moss, and fragrant altars were swept clean by bamboo brooms. Silver knockers gleamed in the moonlight, and jade hooks opened with the frost. As for the divine principle in its full mystery and the true countenance rarely glimpsed—such secret forms, far removed from mortal governance, were transmitted to the officiating bureau. For even when consulting the charts of the Three Immortals, one finds no likeness in the Nine Cauldrons of the provinces. Their radiant forms, painted in white and powdered hues, embodied both substance and luminous beauty. Suddenly, as if in a vision of the unseen, the divine companions manifested auspicious signs, and the artisans, their thoughts exhausted, were moved by communion with the numinous. Within the oratory and the altar of covenant, the presence of the spirits was so vivid that it seemed they were truly there. Lightning banners and mist-sifted rays displayed their feathered regalia. Arrayed upon the sacred mountains, their rites equaled those of the wandering streams. Extending their reverence to the Purple Ultimate, they made offerings to the Yellow-Crowned. Jade cauldrons ever simmered, and golden censers perpetually burned. Sacrificial beasts were tethered, and grass offerings prepared, while simurghs and phoenixes took flight. Dew embraced the divine elders, and stars shone upon the Weaving Maiden. Pure flutes and resonant chants echoed across the celestial isles of the gourd’s ford; the waters of the divine palace mirrored the isles of Penglai in the sea’s curve. Dragon-brewed nectar and crane-harmonized drafts wafted through the courtyards of pure precepts; lions and apotropaic beasts danced and leapt in the realms of concentrated devotion. Pearl banners guarded the repasts, and jade canopies sheltered the palanquins. The offerings of the celestial kitchens were presented in the six periods of the day; the true scriptures within cloud-like canopies were recited through ten thousand kalpas of cultivation. Unlike the thatched huts of old, whose frugality long shone in the illustrious age, the craftsmanship of carpenters and artisans exalted the divine principle, far surpassing the splendor of mere favor. The sacred grace filled the halls, and the spirits dwelled in their cavernous abodes. To come before them and invoke blessings—was this not most fitting?\n\nIn the twelfth month of winter, the overseers completed their measurements with plumb lines and cords. The Daoist adepts Zhang Chongji and others, embracing the Five Thousand Characters of the Teachings, united the multitudes in countless numbers. Ascending the immortal ranks, they gazed upward in reverence, and grasping the sagely calculations, they drove forth their sincerity. The celestial envoys wished to honor the carved and chiseled work, their hearts dwelling upon the imperial court; the assembly of the Law hoped to rely upon the splendor of the jade-like edifice, their Dao resting upon the august peaks. Peach blossoms upon spring waters obscured the source, leading one ever farther, while the secluded groves and apricot dells lay not far from this blessed site. Prostrating in celebration of the celestial favor, they dared to compose this eulogy:\n\nThe Dao is profound and deeply mysterious,\nThe divine abides in the court of blessings.\nThe Three Luminaries govern the extremes,\nThe Five Peaks cradle the spirits.\nIts truth is a thing unto itself,\nIts subtlety formless.\nIts principle is elusive,\nIts merit supreme tranquility.\nO majestic imperial ultimate,\nIlluminating and harmonizing creation!\nThe sagely grasp the Dark Pearl,\nAuspicious and grand, the Great Treasure.\nThe azure expanse gathers in completion,\nThe purple clouds honor the Dao.\nOffering to the hundred spirits,\nDelving into the origins of the Five Elders.\nThus they unrolled the sacred mountains,\nThe secrets of the mountain spirits.\nThe Three Images float in essence,\nThe Ten Flowers speak from immortal mouths.\nTheir might shakes the clouds and rain,\nTheir spirit pervades heaven and earth.\nThe dharma-image shines in clarity,\nThe true chart gleams in purity.\nFortunate in the auspicious era of bright virtue,\nThey descend in honor upon the hidden shrine.\nEscorting the immortal rites with solemnity,\nResplendent in auspicious splendor!\nThe evening glow of the jade palace glows,\nThe divine light of the gem trees brushes.\nCarved radiance in emerald ranks,\nJade cauldrons blend their fragrance.\nPlucking the five sacred herbs from verdant peaks,\nGathering the eight cassia boughs from soaring beams.\nDragons chant and phoenixes dance along the long celestial path,\nClad in robes of azure clouds and white rainbows.\nStriking the jade chimes in empty song,\nArriving at the feathered truths with nectar fine.\nMysteriously stirring the abode of blessings,\nIn subtle hues ascending the divine ultimate.\nDrawing the flowing waters of the Matching Stream,\nGazing upon the brocade colors of the incense burners.\nLeaving the cranes’ words for a thousand years,\nThe simurghs’ adornments gathered in a single breath.\nThe True Mother of the Crimson River is seldom met,\nThe Immortal Maidens of the Azure Sea are fathomless in their majesty.\nRevering the perfect Dao of the Three and Five,\nOffering the symbols of fortune in countless myriads.\nInscribing the true stone upon the famous mountains,\nMagnifying the grand design through imperial power.\n\nIn the twentieth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the cyclical year *renshen*, on the twenty-fifth day of the first month, the first day of which was *yisi*, the stele was erected.\n\n**Postscript to the Stele of the Tang Envoys of the Nine Heavens**\n\nAbove, the vault of heaven arches in its true azure hue, and through the gathering and dispersing of the single *qi*, the myriad beings are born and transformed, none knowing how or why. Who governs this? Who binds it together? According to the Confucians, the physical form is called \"Heaven,\" and the ruling power is called \"Emperor,\" a distinction finely parsed. The Daoist texts, however, explicitly declare that the sovereign power is the August Thearch, who dwells on high in the celestial pole, governing the Three Realms, apportioning duties, and ruling—much like the emperors and kings of the world. Within, they have ministers and a hundred officials; without, they have regional lords and feudal vassals. Bound by silken threads and corded ties, they wield life and death, reward and punishment, each leading their subordinates to establish the ultimate standard for the people. The hidden and the manifest follow a single Dao, and this can indeed be inferred by analogy. Yet the Confucians, reluctant to speak of it, find it difficult to articulate.\n\nThe True Lords of Mount Qingcheng, Mount Qian, and Mount Lu descended in numinous manifestations during the Kaiyuan era of the Tang. Tracing their origins, they share the same primordial essence with the Limitless Dao Ancestor, governing the transformations of the myriad beings, responding to the times to rule the world, and protecting the state and its people. Can one truly gauge their duration by the length of dynasties, or their prominence by the obscurity or clarity of their appearances?\n\nDuring the Shaoxing era, Ye Yiwen, the Prefect of Jiujiang, compiled the *Records of Responses*, which included the Tang stele of Li Pi’s temple. In recent years, Daoist adepts have sought to restore lost texts, beginning with a single sheet of recorded facts sent by Wang Ruan, the former Prefect of Linchuan. It states that upon the completion of the Kaiyuan temple, an edict was issued to the Prefect Du Guzheng to seek out the artisans and record their measurements for the inscription of a stele, which was then presented to the throne. Among the 681 scholars, Li Pi’s text was deemed most fitting, and he was summoned, though he firmly declined. Wang Ruan’s account seems well-founded. Yet Li Pi’s courtesy name was *Yi*—could the old records be in error? The eulogy’s florid prose is indeed impressive, suggesting that its author, though dwelling in the Dao and not in office, once delved deeply into the true teachings.",

      "translated_text": "In the founding of Our August Dynasty, as the celestial mandate unfolded and the realm ascended to profound peace, the ancestral temples were transformed into Daoist abbeys and halls, where seasonal rites were solemnly observed with reverence. Since the restoration and southward crossing, the divine aid of the Perfected Lord in upholding righteousness and blessing the virtuous has manifested in wondrous responses. Upon ascending the throne, His Majesty has emulated the wisdom of antiquity, embodying sacred frugality and diligence. When the cosmic cycles converged and border disturbances arose, his heart was deeply moved, and for the sake of the people’s salvation, he secretly inscribed his name in supplication with utmost sincerity.\n\nThe former overseer of the Supreme Clarity, Master Xiong Shouzhong, having received the imperial decree to attend to these matters, prostrated himself at the palace gates, entreating that an honorific title be bestowed upon the Perfected Lord. Thereupon, His Majesty personally inscribed the three characters *Three Clarities Pavilion* as a gift. An edict was issued, adding the two characters *Wondrous Transformation* beneath *Exploring the Nine Heavens, Responding to the Primordial, Preserving the Mandate*.\n\nYour servant, Xu, entrusted with the brush in the Western Bureau, though unworthy of such a task, feared he could not adequately convey the imperial intent. Master Shouzhong then presented Li Pi’s text, and upon examining its origins, I have humbly expanded upon the imperial bestowal. Amid the dire calamities of the Rong and Di rebellions, when the two blessed lands of Min and Qian were shrouded in ominous vapors, only Mount Lu stood majestic and serene—this is why His Majesty has so earnestly upheld the rites of veneration and the offerings of exorcism, thereby securing the nation’s stability and relieving the people’s suffering. How can this be compared to the extravagant displays of those who dwell in towering pavilions or erect palatial halls, vainly seeking transcendence while indulging their desires?\n\nAlas! The cycles of fortune—nine calamities in a hundred and six—are ordained by destiny, even the most prosperous of emperors cannot escape them. Yet the Dao of Heaven cherishes life; how could it bear to see its children slaughtered by the sword? The sovereign, acting as Heaven’s deputy to nurture the myriad people, must embody Heaven’s generative, nourishing, and sustaining virtues. Thus, the scourge of war may be quelled, and harmonious qi may be summoned. Otherwise, how could the preservation of the kalpa’s destiny and the salvation of all beings be revealed in the sacred scriptures of the Dragon Han and Crimson Brilliance eras? Yet in recent times, such decrees have emanated from Heaven itself, seeking to prolong the celestial mandate. The sacred teachings have been transmitted—how could they align so perfectly with the unseen will of Heaven?\n\nNow, His Majesty, diligent in governance and ever mindful of order, communes with the mind of Heaven. As adversity gives way to prosperity, the signs of renewal are manifest. Shall not the celestial ladders and towering peaks be swept clean of all obstructions? Shall not the Five Elders and Mount Song stand as eternal guardians along the river’s course? Under the vast canopy of Heaven, all—whether ruler or subject—shall be encompassed, with the sacred mountains anchoring the four directions and the central realm. The divine tripod shall be established upon the Rong and Wen rivers; the chariots and script shall extend for ten thousand li, and the hundred barbarians shall be adorned in courtly attire. The sacrifices to the Zhou shall be matched with those to Heaven, and the dynasty’s legacy shall endure for a thousand myriad generations.\n\nThis humble servant, though unworthy, holds office in the realm of letters. Following the elegance of *The Chariot’s Advance* and *Lofty Mount Song*, I have inscribed this stele to commemorate the era of primordial peace. Though my talents are ill-suited to the task, I have taken up the brush in emulation of Li Pi, awaiting further instruction.\n\nIn the first year of the Chunyou reign, the year *xinchou*, on the Double Ninth Festival, Cheng Xu, Gentleman for Court Audiences, Guardian of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and Academician of the Institute of Academicians, bows in reverence and respectfully appends this postscript.\n\n*Stele Inscription for the Renovation of This Abbey in the Second Year of the Jingde Reign of the August Dynasty*\nComposed by Zhou Qi",

      "translated_text": "When the Two Modes first divided and the Three Powers took their places, the vast and luminous expanse unfolded with celestial bodies arrayed in their celestial paths, while the boundless and profound earth set its mountains and rivers within their bounds. Cold and heat interwove to order the year’s labors, yin and yang intermingled to give rise to the numinous. Such is the authority of transformation, and thus there must be those who govern, to harmonize the decrees of the Supreme Emperor and bestow blessings upon the people below.\n\nOf old, the sages established the imperial standard, instituting sacrificial rites, examining the sacred texts, exorcising misfortune through ritual and teaching to manifest sincerity, and distinguishing ranks through chariots, robes, and emblems. They spread instruction without limit and guided with wondrous efficacy as their foundation. The veneration of virtue and the repayment of merit have ever been esteemed.\n\nThe Abbey of Great Peace Flourishing Under Heaven on Mount Lu is the temple of the Messenger of the Nine Heavens. In the Tang dynasty, during the Kaiyuan reign, the throne first received mysterious inspiration and was favored with the bestowal of the Most Real. Seeking to commune with the silence of the Pure Capital, the emperor consulted the masters of the esoteric arts. Relying on this sacred mountain, they first established the abode of immortals.\n\nAs the celestial mandate shifted and the realm was thrown into turmoil, the abbey’s numinous heart awaited its time, aligning with the hidden destiny of a flourishing dynasty. Our August Ancestor, the Emperor, soared to the heavens upon the Five Movements, governing the myriad states and ascending the throne. His civilizing influence extended beyond all bounds, and his radiant governance reached to the farthest limits. This sacred land, a profound and secluded realm, stood at the convergence of the Nine Provinces, where the hundred spirits received their offices.\n\nOur Emperor Taizong, grasping the celestial tally and ascending the great treasure, transformed customs and brought peace to the people. He revived neglected rites, ordered all matters without omission, fulfilled the duties of emperors and kings, and extended his profound benevolence in nurturing all life. Turning his gaze to this abbey of assembled spirits, a place of grand supplication for blessings, he specially issued a rescript in purple, bestowing its rightful name, reaffirming the solemnity of the rites as if the spirits were present, and granting it an era name.\n\nOur present Emperor, having received the true record, nurtures the black-haired masses, upholds the grand designs of his sagely predecessors, and inaugurates an everlasting imperial legacy. In governing the state and the family, he reverts to the unadorned virtues of antiquity; amidst the myriad affairs of state, he labors diligently for the people’s welfare. Moreover, his sagely virtue daily renews, endowed by heaven with manifold talents. His imperial compositions shine brilliantly in the heavens, and his sagacious strategies embrace even distant lands. He humbly remains receptive to counsel and solemnly fulfills his filial piety.\n\nAs for the manifold auspicious signs and the abundant blessings that have accrued—though unrecorded in earlier annals and unknown even to the most learned—these have long been embedded in the people’s songs and familiar to all ears. Those who dig wells and till fields know not the emperor’s power, yet those who gaze at the clouds and look toward the palace gates find their deeds ceaselessly inscribed in history. Thus, from within and without, the realm hastens to the celestial court, and peoples from afar gather to present their local marvels, offering them as tokens of the Primordial Mandate and responses to the numinous decree. This is indeed a great ritual, one that heaven itself can scarcely match. Though it originates in the emperor’s assent, it ultimately defers to the people’s desires.\n\nThereupon, the procession of laws and the solemnity of the guards were arrayed; the sealed peaks were opened for inspection, and the grand rites were fully displayed. Jade seats were set upon the Fen River, and the great repayment to heaven and earth was solemnly performed. The glorious achievements of the ancestral emperors were illuminated, and the utmost sincerity was offered to heaven and earth. The grand principles of past ages were surpassed, and the splendor of this accomplished ritual was made manifest. Was this merely the gathering of auspicious light at the bamboo palace or the embrace of the pure and vast at the paulownia ridge? The celestial celebration was already complete, and the vast grace already pervasive.\n\nAs for the shrines nestled in cliffs and valleys and the heroic deeds left by history, offerings were still made and firewood-gathering was forbidden. How much more so for the chief ministers of the Supreme Emperor and the separate retinues of the assembled perfected? Calculating the days, there was no need for reconstruction, nor was there any reason to alter what had been done before. Thus, the emperor commanded his attendants to seek skilled artisans and stoneworkers, with expenses provided by the court, so that the work might be joyfully completed.\n\nPillars and beams were raised in grand design, and paintings and decorations were renewed in splendor. Banners and sacred seats gleamed within the inner precincts, while rosy clouds and starry crowns circled among the attendants. When the wind ceased and the feathered guests arrived for their morning devotions, the star altars were illuminated by crimson light at night, and the cloud chariots of the many sages were heard from afar.\n\nDuring the auspicious seasons of the Three Primes, when the Six Qi harmonized, all reverently upheld the ritual codes, solemnly arraying the offerings. They prayed for the sagacious longevity of the imperial enterprise and for the people’s blessings in abundant life. Auspicious omens gathered like chess pieces, and all attained wealth and longevity.\n\nThis splendid edifice, now reopened to manifest its numinous power, is embraced by mountains and rivers on all sides, its sashes and belts intersecting at the eight thoroughfares. Truly, it is the dwelling of immortals and the gateway of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, to record its numinous traces and inscribe its steadfast stone, to make manifest the trustworthy record—this follows the old model. I, though unworthy, have been allowed to linger among the near ranks, possessing not an inch of talent. Yet, favored by the radiant grace, I respectfully compose this inscription:\n\nThe August Emperor receives the chart,\nAnd heaven’s bright mandate is bestowed.\nHe governs the eight directions,\nAnd orders all affairs of state.\nHis grace soaks all living things,\nHis commands spread like the wind.\nHe follows the Dao of heaven,\nAnd brings blessings to the myriad people.\n\nHe appoints the many officials,\nAnd establishes the people’s standard.\nHe venerates and exalts the bright sacrifices,\nIlluminating his illustrious virtue.\nFor the people he prays for blessings,\nThat they may live without harm.\n\nThe officials hold their posts,\nAnd the spirits too receive their offices.\nHere upon this sacred peak,\nTowering in the great void,\nThe perfected ones gather,\nAnd immortals make their abode.\nMountains and rivers embrace,\nWaters and trees flourish.\nRites expel yin’s darkness,\nAnd the seasons turn in harmony.\n\nThe Dao has its rises and falls,\nBut the era meets with flourishing.\nBlessings fill the realm,\nAnd teachings are honored beyond its borders.\nThe feathered guests refine their practice,\nRevering the true texts and exorcising misfortune.\nThough the hidden destiny has its time,\nIt reveals the communion of spirits and men.\n\nThe star of the envoy hastens south,\nAnd the river’s edge is marked by the traces of the perfected.\nOrnamentation enhances the solemnity of the images,\nAnd vermilion steps glow with layered brilliance.\nOverlooking the great road from soaring eaves,\nThe layered towers cast shade upon the splendid halls.\n\nCompleted in no time,\nYet how could the people’s labor be known?\nSolemn are the perfected ones above,\nAs the jade halls are renewed.",

On the third day, *jihai*, Your Servant Jiao Zhi, Provisional Administrator of the Jiangnan Eastern Circuit Transport Bureau, reverently presented imperial incense and sacrificial prayers to make the announcement. On the day *wuchen* of the fourth month, Your Servant Liao Wei, Gentleman of the Interior for Court Service in the Palace Domestic Service, escorted the imperial calligraphy, hall plaque, immortal robes, and ritual banners and staffs to their shrine for installation. Furthermore, green memorials and yellow silk petitions were bestowed, and a jiao offering was conducted at the altar hall for two days and nights. The imperial edict and immortal robes were stored in jeweled caskets, lined with embroidered silk, and wrapped in crimson robes adorned with cloud-cranes in gold leaf. The plaque’s characters were gilded, flanked by dragons, simurghs, and blossoming flowers in flight, while the colored banners, auspicious staffs, and ornaments—all of unparalleled splendor—were bestowed from the imperial treasury, the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nThereupon, the assembled multitude of the Temple of Great Peace, along with officials great and small from within and beyond Jiujiang, monks and Daoists, young and old, all leapt and hastened forth, their faces alight with joy. Together, they purified themselves and conducted a jiao ceremony of celebration beneath the shrine, lasting eight days and nights. And they spoke among themselves, saying: \"This mountain’s temples were first established in the *xinshi* year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, three hundred and fifty-one years ago. Since then, blessings have overflowed, and responses have been clear and manifest. In our dynasty’s statutes, local officials have offered sacrifices in spring and autumn, and every three years at the suburban rites, envoys have been dispatched to announce and offer sacrifices. Yet never before have there been gifts of jeweled crowns, cloud robes, ceremonial tablets, shoes, or stockings—such bounty in gratitude for the gods’ favor is already profound. Now, however, heaven has initiated this auspicious convergence, subtly aiding the sagely will, reviving ancient rites, elevating titles, and enriching ceremonies with splendid adornments—surpassing all that has come before in generations. The intent of this exaltation is fully set forth in the imperial edict. As for the specifics of the bestowed gifts and the order of the sacrificial rites, if not engraved in metal and stone, we fear they will not dazzle the eyes of the realm or endure for ten thousand generations. Your servant, having once served in the imperial secretariat and now overseeing this sacred temple, ought to record this momentous occasion.\"\n\nI humbly reflect that our sagely emperor, with great virtue, illuminates his ancestors and, with filial piety, communes with the divine. Reverent and diligent day and night, he seeks to respond to the blessings of the Three Spirits. Thus, he examines ritual texts, rectifies sacrificial canons, and consults the deliberations of ministers and scholars before issuing his decrees. As for the mountain and river spirits who descend to dwell among men, regardless of past or present, near or far, none are not accorded their proper rank, and their altars and jade offerings are all adorned with care. How much more so for this capital of the perfected, this court of fortune’s dispensation, whose name was established by the Yellow Emperor and whose office was conferred by the Most High? Its illustrious and resplendent titles have long awaited their full manifestation. It is fitting that the emperor’s heart, like timely rain, has issued this virtuous decree, and that the imperial edict below has proclaimed its extraordinary distinction. Thus, where sincerity is directed, responses duly arrive: when the imperial envoy turned south, numinous radiance touched the heavens; when the immortal hall was lit at night, divine music startled the ear. All felicitous omens and auspicious signs shall henceforth unfold in succession. Soon, the emperor will ascend Mount Tai, inscribe the Central Peak, and compose odes to the vastness of the great marshes, celebrating boundless blessings without precedent.\n\nThough I dwell far from the capital, I am like the farmer of old, singing the praises of great virtue. Now, having been honored to partake in this glorious occasion, it is my duty to compose this text in eulogy—I dare not refuse.\n\nWith bowed head and reverent obeisance, I offer this poem:\n\nO radiant and boundless heavens above the Middle Kingdom,\nThe Song dynasty perpetuates its luminous virtue.\nResplendent in sagely wisdom, it inherits the supreme throne,\nEndowed by heaven with civil and martial prowess, courage and insight.\nSerene in the Hall of Law, it consults the charts and records,\nRectifying all affairs and illuminating the obscure.\nLike wind and thunder, its beneficent influence spreads,\nAnd distant barbarians hasten to submit.\nThe qi harmonizes, the seasons prosper, and the people multiply,\nWhile gods and spirits all receive their offices.\nMajestic mountains house the immortal abodes,\nWhere five hundred numinous officials hold sway.\nRoaming and descending through the profound and silent,\nThey reward the good and punish the wicked, their depths unfathomable.\nResplendent jade texts emerge from the celestial brush,\nAdvancing its illustrious title to surpass past and present.\nLibations of peppered wine and cassia ale array the jade mats,\nPhoenix carriages and wind-drawn steeds arrive in endless procession.\nThe perfected ones rejoice, and the hundred spirits gather,\nAuspicious blessings pile high like mountains.\nMay the Son of Heaven live ten thousand years in blessed peace,\nAnd his inscriptions on Mount Tai gleam upon metal and stone.\nMay his descendants flourish in unbroken succession,\nAnd the common people dwell in peace and longevity.\n\n*Installation of the Jade Register*\nIn the fourth year of Yuanfeng, the Emperor Shenzong decreed: \"The Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor of the Temple of Great Peace and National Revival on Mount Lu in Jiangzhou is a noble spirit of heaven, bestowing blessings upon the world. Yet its exalted name and illustrious titles have been neglected through the ages, which is no way to repay the gods’ favor. Let it be advanced in title to *Nine Heavens Imperial Visitor, Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny, Perfected Lord*.\" The Gentleman of the Interior for Court Service in the Palace Domestic Service, Liao Wei, was dispatched to escort the golden calligraphy. The hall plaque and edict of commendation were bestowed accordingly.",

      "translated_text": "Previously, the Daoist priest Tao Zhixian of this abbey had cleared the brambles and raised its halls. Upon breaking ground, he unearthed a single vertebra, which he split open and filled with earth—there, the soil bore five colors. He also discovered a bronze spring, its inscription reading *Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny*. At the time, none knew what auspicious sign this portended. Two years later, the imperial edict conferred honor, matching the inscription on the spring. Liao Wei then retrieved the spring and presented it to the court.\n\nWith reverence, we reflect: as the August Emperor faces south, the hundred spirits receive their offices. Heaven stirs his heart, and the unseen world aligns in harmony—is this not magnificent? In the fifth year of Zhenghe, the present Emperor, in his sixteenth year upon the throne, inherited the will of his predecessor and communed with the Dao to honor the gods. The divine ancestors and forebears rejoiced, gazing upon the four directions, where no spirit failed to pay homage. Turning his gaze southward, he beheld the Perfected Lord *Responding to the Origin and Preserving the Destiny* descending to the palace courtyard, standing at the Emperor’s side. It was our divine predecessor who first established this grand title, yet the ritual registers remained incomplete.

The register’s text bore the Emperor’s name, and it read: *\"With utmost reverence, we bow twice and declare...\"*—such was its solemnity. The local officials, magistrates, and temple officers knelt and rose in presentation with the utmost care. The register was carved from fine jade, bound with golden clasps, wrapped in brocade, and encased in a vermilion chest adorned with forest patterns and gilded fittings, its radiance dazzling, its craftsmanship exquisite beyond description.

      "translated_text": "The following year, the temple officer Chai Chu arrived bearing incense and offerings. Some two hundred Daoists in feathered robes and yellow crowns advanced on horseback, declaring: *\"The sovereign cherishes the intent of the Dao and virtue, venerates the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, reverently serves the radiant deities, and diligently upholds the grand rites—honoring the flourishing of culture, surpassing the past and illuminating the future. Yet the inscriptions on metal and stone, being indelible, must proclaim the majesty of the imperial spirit and manifest it for posterity. Who, if not one well-versed in literature, is fit for this task?\"*\n\nOfficer Chai replied: *\"The Daoists speak truly.\"*\n\n*\"Carefully consulting the* Record of Marvels*, in the nineteenth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, the August Emperor dreamed of a divine being clad in crimson robes and a golden crown, descending in a chariot and saying: ‘I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Investigation; lodge me on the northwest slope of Mount Lu.’ The next day, the deity appeared again in the palace courtyard, and the emperor commanded Wu Daozi to paint his likeness. An inner palace attendant was dispatched bearing the true portrait of the envoy, and a temple was erected on the northern side of the mountain. The August Emperor personally inscribed the殿额 in seal script and bestowed it, its text reading: ‘Hall of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy.’ Yet the title ‘Envoy of Investigation’ was omitted, though the plaque itself remains. When the temple was first built, auspicious omens abounded, as recorded in the stele of Li Bi’s temple, Pan Guan’s* Record of Auspicious Verifications*, Zhang Jing’s* Continuation of Deyang Records*, and Chen Shun’s* Yu’s Record of Mount Lu*. Thus, the world came to know the envoy’s title. The temple on Mount Lu traces its origins to the Tang and its flourishing to the August Emperor.\"*\n\nOfficer Chai demurred: *\"This is not so. According to the* True Forms of the Five Peaks*, it is said: ‘The Five Peaks each have auxiliary mountains: Mount Song, Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, and Mount Heng are assisted by Shaoshi, Wudang, Luofu, Kuocang, Difei, Nüfan, Hefeng, and Baodu, which govern the four sacred peaks. Only Mount Heng stands solitary, without support.’ Thus, when the Yellow Emperor toured the realm and reached the south by the Yangtze, he petitioned the Supreme Emperor to establish Mount Qian and Mount Huo as the reserve lords of the Southern Peak. He further honored Mount Qingcheng as the ‘Elder’ and Mount Lu as the ‘Envoy.’ The title ‘Envoy’ thus predates the Tang. Though the* True Forms *emerged in the middle ages, it was compiled in the Eastern Jin from a lineage of transmitted teachings by generations of fangshi; it cannot be dismissed as false. During the Kaiyuan era, Sima Zimei of Tiantai asserted that the Five Peaks each had an Upper Clarity Perfected One appointed to their office, and he urged that each peak establish a shrine to its True Lord—this doctrine derived from the* True Forms*. The Kaiyuan edicts then designated the Elder Temple of Qingcheng and the Envoy Temple of Mount Lu, selecting Daoists to tend the incense and offerings, treating them on par with the True Lord shrines of the Five Peaks. Thus, the intent to honor the temple on Mount Lu originated with Sima Zimei. Whether the deity’s appearance in dreams was a divine revelation or mere illusion remains unknowable. Examining the records in detail, the Envoy’s spirit is likely a lofty Perfected One who stabilizes virtue, an auxiliary to Zhu Rong. This account predates the Eastern Jin, while the title ‘Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Investigation’ was a later addition. The temple on the northern slope of Mount Lu, however, began with the Tang’s August Emperor. In the Southern Tang, it was renamed the ‘Tongyuan Prefecture,’ and in the second year of the Taiping Xingguo era of our dynasty, it received its present name by imperial favor. The world, misled by vulgar and superficial steles and tales of the strange, has failed to investigate deeply, losing sight of the facts. Thus, I have set forth its origins and developments to dispel the confusion of future generations.\"*\n\nErected on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the first year of the Chonghe era.\n\nComposed by Hong Chu, Gentleman for Court Audiences and Supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Palace, granted the rank of *Paiyu Dai*.\nThe plaque inscription was written by the humble scholar Shi Qidao.\nErected on the tenth day of the eleventh month of the first year of the Chonghe era by the Daoist disciples Chen Sigong, Tao Zhichang, Zhang Anzhu, Shen Jibin, Li Zhonggong, Xiao Minxiu, and Gao Zhidao.\n\n*Record of the Three Clarities Hall*\nBy the Grand Master for Court Audiences, concurrently Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, Da Zhong Dafu",

      "translated_text": "Herein lies the composition of Minister Wu Yu, Concurrent Academician of the Institute of Scholarly Worthies, Earl of De’an Prefecture with a fief of nine hundred households. The imperial nephew, Bearer of the Office of the Military Commissioner of Qingyuan, Duke of Tianshui Prefecture with a fief of two thousand households and a true seal of two hundred, Minister Yu, inscribed the calligraphy.\n\nSolemn is the August Supreme Thearch, who has established the great foundation of our Song. The sagely Son of Heaven, inheriting the grand calendar, reveres the Mandate of Heaven with awe. He has erected a terrace for worshipping Heaven, arrayed the celestial charts in due order, and stationed attendants on all sides—nowhere is Heaven not present. Yet, in this hallowed place of reverence, he has not failed to turn his sagely mind to all that may serve the people in beseeching Heaven. His luminous virtue and compassionate sacrifices have caused the hundred spirits to receive their offices.\n\nFormerly, the Nine Heavens’ Investigator of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey in Jiangzhou manifested numinous efficacy so resplendent that successive sages bestowed praise, ennobling him as the Perfected Lord of Response and Protection of the Mandate. Now, an edict has augmented his title with two more characters, calling him the Perfected Lord of Wondrous Transformation, and the Emperor himself has brushed three grand characters—*Three Clarities Hall*—to bestow upon him. Dragon-script adorns the void; phoenix-edicts illumine the age. Gazing upon them, reciting them, their renown resounds across the four seas. Ah, how splendid!\n\nFor Heaven attains clarity through the One—soundless, scentless, utterly transcendent. The teachings of the Daoist school speak of the Jade Clarity of the Upper Palace, the Supreme Clarity of the Middle Palace, and the Grand Clarity of the Lower Palace. Is it not that the Dao, originally of one origin, divides its qi into three realms, and within the nebulous and indistinct, this image arises? All Daoist temples throughout the world revere and serve these Two Clarities. The abbey lies on the northern slope of Mount Lu, where prayers are offered for deliverance from banditry, calamities, and portents. The rites of incense and official appointment grow ever more solemn; no petition goes unanswered, and its responses are as swift as an echo.\n\nI have long pondered this: Heaven is all-hearing and all-seeing, its majesty ever manifest below. It blesses the good and punishes the licentious, diminishes the full and augments the modest. There must be those who serve as Heaven’s eyes and ears—surely this is the office of the Investigator. The Supreme Thearch commands them to scrutinize the four quarters, just as the sovereign commands his ministers to survey the realm. The four seasons proceed, and the myriad things come to fruition—all to succor our people. Heaven’s succor of the people is boundless, and the sovereign’s prayers for them spare no effort. This is why the three grand characters were bestowed.\n\nThe hall was completed in the summer, the sixth month, the *jiazi* day of the Shaoding *renchen* year. The imperial gift was conferred in the winter, the intercalary twelfth month, the *jiazi* day of the Jiaxi *gengzi* year. From the era of Kaiyuan in the Tang to our Song, all abbeys serving as Investigator temples have evolved from shrines to monasteries, from monasteries to palaces—jade halls and gem chambers arrayed like clouds and stars. Their illustrious names and honorific titles, bestowed in due order, have made them the grandest sights under Heaven. Yet, the Three Clarities had no hall of their own. Minister Xiong Shouzhong, who oversees the abbey’s affairs, deemed this contrary to the principle of repaying the origin and returning to the beginning. Thus, before the Perfected Lord’s hall, he erected a grand pavilion to enshrine them. The project spanned eight years before its completion. Magnificent and towering, it befits the teachings and laws. The Thearch precedes, the ministers follow; the divine ranks are solemn and reverent. The rites are complete, and the Dao is in harmony.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s numinous power is renowned throughout the world. Since our imperial house crossed the river southward, Mount Lu has been esteemed alongside the Five Peaks. For all matters of the two frontiers, prayers are offered here; in years of flood or drought, none fail to dance in supplication. We wish to inscribe this in metal and stone, to exalt the Supreme Thearch’s glory, to extol the Son of Heaven’s beneficence, and to proclaim it for ten thousand generations.\n\nMy family has dwelt at the foot of Mount Lu for generations. Now, by fortune, I serve in the forbidden forest, and it is my duty to take up my brush in song and praise. With bowed head and reverent obeisance, I record these events and offer a poem:\n\nThe splendor of Mount Lu,\nRises beside the Dipper,\nVies with Mount Heng,\nAnd guards the southeast.\nThe people gaze upon it,\nThe gods and Heaven dwell there.\nAuspicious dreams of old,\nArose in ancient days.\n\nSolemn is Heaven, all-hearing,\nCompassionate to the people below.\nFearing some may go unheard,\nIt seeks those who serve as its ears.\nThe gods govern this,\nClouds harnessed, winds bridled.\nThey survey and investigate,\nTraversing the world.\nSwift without haste,\nClear without scrutiny.\nHeaven speaks not,\nYet the people groan not—\nThis is the court of blessings.\n\nSuccessive sages revered and worshipped,\nBestowing abundant grace.\nResponse follows feeling,\nOur sagely lord shines bright.\nWith one heart,\nHe is present though unseen.\nWho dares not revere?\nThe precious painting, the golden plaque,\nThe illustrious title, the luminous edict.\nSun and moon are its banners,\nMountains and rivers gleam.\n\nThe profound hall stands behind,\nThe new pavilion before,\nAs the lord presides and ministers look up.\nWith timely robes and sashes,\nThey gather at the imperial court.\nConveying the people’s sentiments,\nThey succor our sagely lord.\nThe people revere our lord,\nBoundless as Heaven.\nHeaven protects our Song,\nWith descendants a thousandfold.\nThe people bow in reverence,\nWishing the canon to endure.\nThe attending ministers inscribe these words,\nTo perpetuate its glorious renown.\n\n*Record of the Abbey*\nIn the year *jiayin* of the Jiading era, on the Clear and Bright Festival, the Feathered Being Bai Yuchan of the Linghuo Cave Heaven in Fuzhou, having burned incense, respectfully presented himself beneath the Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Censorate. Shortly after, Prefect Chen Zhihe offered him sweet wine. When I arrived at Yuhua, drunk and disheveled, I departed without delay. The Daoist ministers Chen Shoumo and Chen Ruyi were dispatched to request a composition to record the abbey. How could I refuse?\n\nThe text reads:\nJiangzhou, an ancient prefecture,\nMount Lu, eternal,\nIs a grotto-heaven where immortals chant truths,\nA divine palace where purple radiance shines.\nJade courts and gem chambers\nLie hidden amid crimson cliffs and emerald walls;\nFeathered robes and rainbow skirts\nBlend with the black ox and white deer.\nGibbons cry in jade ravines,\nCranes call in herb fields.\nThe land borders fiery Heng,\nClouds link to hidden Wan.\nGolden lads bear the moon,\nDelivering the scriptures of Magu and Hezao;\nJewel-staffed envoys ride the wind,\nAttending the banquets of Weiyu and Kuocang.\nJade flowers bloom in full,\nCrimson phoenixes alight on the Five Elders’ Peak;\nThe jade well runs deep and cold,\nWhite dragons surge from the Three Gorges’ waters.\nPines are ancient, stones strange,\nGirding the Nine Bends and embracing Luofou;\nBamboo is old, grasses numinous,\nHub to the Three Maos and nave to Great Di.",

      "translated_text": "The chamber filled with an extraordinary fragrance, rich and lingering for days. The knife turned golden in hue, and people rushed to purchase it. He ground the ink with wine and consumed half of it, whereupon his long-standing ailments vanished at once. Master Hu, though nearing seventy, bore the complexion of a maiden, and his capacity for wine remained boundless—truly an extraordinary encounter with the Eight Immortals.\n\nAs for the two characters \"Great Song,\" when pronounced swiftly, they form the word *Dong*; the two scenes (*er chang*) compose the character *Lü*; and the \"guest\" (*ke*) signifies \"guest\" (*bin*). Thus, the meeting with Lü Dongbin becomes clear.\n\nFrom that time onward, Master Hu gradually wearied of the mortal world. One day, he left behind a poem and shed his earthly form, departing. Where once he had mixed ink, five springs suddenly welled forth. Left Minister Wang, passing by, named it *Ink Immortal Spring*. Vice Minister Song Bofu and the Left Minister both composed verses in response, with lines such as:\n\n*\"Green ointment exchanged for a youthful face returned,\nWhite hair needs no yellow essence to brush away.\"*\n\nGrand Preceptor Cao Xun of Qiao Commandery and the Perfected Man of Pure Emptiness, Huangfu Tan, reported these events to the Hall of Virtuous Longevity, where Emperor Gaozong marveled deeply at them.\n\nMaster Hu’s former residence, once called *Hall of the Encounter with Immortals*, was renamed *Ink Bestowal Hall*. Its storied pavilions and layered eaves teemed with an auspicious aura. An ancient well and cold spring gleamed jade-green in all seasons. Wondrous indeed—the strange affair of Mount Lu! Thus, it is recorded here to supplement the annals of immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Local Deity’s Ancestral Hall**\n\nThe Chen clan traces its origins to the lofty Gao, its branches flowing like a spring. The Marquis of Qu Ni assisted the Duke of Pei in pacifying the Guanzhong region, ultimately achieving the office of Chancellor. From then on, their generations flourished, their descendants shining brightly, ennobled in life and venerated in death through ancestral halls for generations.\n\nIn ancient times, a branch of the clan migrated from Yingyang to Fujian and Guangdong, becoming a great lineage. The Marquis of Meichuan, surnamed Chen, was a man of the Jin dynasty, with his temple established in the Plum Blossom Forest of South Mountain. He once ceded land to form the Grotto Palace of Immortal Origins. The Marquis of Putian in the ancient Wurong Commandery, also surnamed Chen and of the Jin dynasty, had his temple at the Phoenix Pavilion Post in Hu Mountain, likewise ceding land to establish the Grotto Palace of Pure Origins. Others, such as the Marquis of Gaizhu in Fusha and the Spiritually Manifest Marquis of Linzhang, were also of the Chen clan. The number of their ancestral halls in famous mountains and great rivers is beyond reckoning.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, the Reclusive Lord of the Temple, surnamed Chen (his given name unknown, though some say it was Boshi), lived in seclusion on Kang Mountain, annotating the *Records of the Grand Historian* and circulating it throughout the world. Though summoned by imperial decree, he refused to appear, and was later appointed Gentleman for Literary Composition. His family produced scholars and officials for generations. After settling before the Peak of Sagely Rule, during the Kaiyuan era, Emperor Minghuang once spent the night at Zhaoyang Palace. At dawn, he ascended the Hall of Numinous Radiance and twice beheld the envoys of the Nine Heavens’ Inspectors. Receiving the emperor’s decree, he instructed the Chen family to establish a temple in the northwest corner of Mount Lu, entrusting the prefect of Jiangzhou, Du Gu Zhengshu, with its oversight. Five individuals, including Meng Xianzhen, were appointed to tend its incense and flame.\n\nBefore this, the site had been neglected, unknown to all. One day, a figure robed in starry splendor and trailing rosy clouds arrived at Chen’s gate, declaring: *\"The Primordial August Emperor has dispatched Yuan Yi, Envoy of the Azure Waters, bearing the banner of the Nine Standards and Five Spirits, to inspect the registers of life and death, withering and flourishing across the Nine Heavens and Nine Earths. Today, the Son of Heaven has personally sought the envoy’s counsel, desiring to build the Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Censor on Mount Lu, that its blessings may extend to the common people five hundred years hence. I deem your dwelling—a jade ravine cradling the moon, a celestial abyss mirroring the sky—a truly sublime site. You should cede this land to lay the temple’s foundation. In your next life, you shall serve as an attendant of the terrace, presiding over this mountain and receiving offerings in perpetuity.\"*\n\nChen assented. The Daoist left, vanishing in an instant. Later, a sudden thunderclap and violent wind relocated Chen’s dwelling to the left of the palace, where its site became the temple. After its completion, Chen shed his mortal form and became the eternal local deity of this place.\n\nThereafter, his descendants moved to Changle Village in De’an County. Over time, they branched out to a separate estate on Ding Mountain, twice receiving the imperial commendation of *Righteous Household* during our dynasty. Thus, the former residence to the left of the palace became the site of the local deity’s incense and flame.\n\nThe state temple was later renamed a palace, and among the Chen clan, some rode turtles to ascend the isles of immortals, others plucked orchids, entered the Hanlin Academy, or aged by the fishing platform. The sound of recitation rang clear, the jingle of hairpins and girdle ornaments resounded, their gates and halls stood grandly, and their banners and inscriptions shone resplendently—magnificent indeed!\n\nTheir descendant Chen Zhuo, riding a blue steed and spurring a yellow crane, entrusted the annual duties of the palace gate to the Daoist Xiang Dexin. He gathered funds, casting them into a cauldron to mold ten divine statues and construct a six-bay temple hall with two gates and two passageways. Green eaves congealed with mist, vermilion corridors bathed in moonlight. Wind chimes beneath the eaves echoed in succession, while lamps shone brightly even at noon. Flowers wove a brocade across the earth, and jade foundations bore moss.",

      "translated_text": "Canopied jewel-enshrined curtains draped the pavilions, jade censers wafted fragrance through the halls. Gold and azure dazzled the eye, vermilion and purple startled the beholder. The radiance of their majestic power seemed as though they could speak, so keen and upright were they—unchanged from ancient times to the present.\n\nThis was all initiated by Du Daoshu of Shuxi, former supervisor of the palace. In former times, Master Jin of Xiaoyao Mountain had yielded his dwelling to Xu Jingsun in retreat; Master Sun of Tongwu Mountain had yielded his dwelling to Ge Taiji; and the two Chens of Min had likewise ceded their land to establish a grotto-palace. In this, the Recluse Chen of Kang Mountain was no different. Though the Recluse has passed, his spirit endures through the ages. Surely he could refine the lead of the nine heavens and six earths, gather the mercury of the three shocks and four marshlands, and cultivate the Dao of flight and transformation. If he does not become a pure and numinous soul, then his ascent to immortality is not far—how could he be merely a god?\n\nFor the term \"god,\" the *Book of Changes* states: \"That which is vast and unfathomable is called *shen* (spirit).\" The *Classic of the Unseen Correspondence* says: \"It is not spirit, yet its spirit is what makes it spirit.\" The *Book of Transformation* further states: \"The myriad spirits are one spirit.\" If the Recluse can attain this spirit, then he may tread the realm of Yuan Yi, ascend the homeland of Yuan Shi, and share the same breath and dwelling as the Perfected Lord of Visitation—how could mere temple offerings confine such a Recluse? The Recluse is a divine being. This is my humble declaration.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Reconstruction of the Local Deity’s Shrine**\n\nWhen the Perfected Lord was dispatched on his visitation mission, he stationed his banner at Mount Lu—this is well-documented. Yet the origins of the local deity, Master Chen, who donated his residence to establish the palace, are even more divine.\n\nTracing ancient accounts: since the imperial numen manifested in broad daylight during the Kaiyuan era, the Son of Heaven sought a fitting place to honor the spirits, but none met his approval. At the foot of the sacred mountain, the Recluse Chen had made his home—a land of fine mountains and waters. One day, a fangshi knocked at his gate, subtly suggesting he relocate. Chen assented without hesitation, and though his strength was insufficient, that very night a storm raged like thunder, yet his house stood unshaken. At dawn, his entire household had already moved south. Thus, the divine office bestowed treasures, and laborers flocked to toil. They channeled the streams to form ponds, raised beams like clouds and rainbows. From shrine to mansion, mansion to abbey, abbey to palace, the halls of the Perfected multiplied daily, and wondrous realms expanded beyond human design.\n\nIn truth, though this grand vision may seem as though heaven and earth had opened it, it was all conceived within the Recluse’s own mind. Ordinary people, confined to their doors and windows, know nothing beyond their walls. Unable to bear their own discomfort, how could they care for the welfare of future generations? Yet the Recluse relinquished his ancestral estate to plead for the lives of the people, sacrificing his beloved home to secure blessings for the next five hundred years. His lofty vision and noble resolve soar beyond the clouds. If even rustic elders were to witness this, could they not but be struck with awe? He is truly worthy to preside over this mountain, and his incense fire shall endure as long as the palace’s.\n\nIn the year *qimeng* of the *Dayuanxian* cycle, the Daoist abbey was destroyed by war, and the calamity extended to the deity’s shrine. Once order was restored, reconstruction began, and the following year, it was completed. Zhou Deyi, supervisor of the palace, and Zhou Chengyuan, deputy director, requested a record of its rise and fall.\n\nI have heard that since the Recluse moved his family, his lineage has been passed down without clear records. Those fond of such matters often append genealogies to his name, but only an ancient stele, inscribed by Lü Zhixin (supervisor of the palace), depicts the first descent of the image. The inscription notes: \"This is the present *qianbu*.\" Later generations have claimed him as part of my clan. Yet wars and fires have repeatedly ravaged our family, leaving no intact records. I dare not presume to exalt him as the Duke of Fengyang, but even without my ancestors’ testimony, the Recluse’s virtue should still be recorded—how much more so with Lü’s stele as evidence? Thus, I write this.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the fourteenth year of the Zhiyuan era of the *Dingchou* year, recorded by Chen Youzong, a mountain dweller of Shidian. The colophon was inscribed by Wu Meng, the Mountain Spring Recluse.\n\n---\n\n**Prayer Tablet for the Reconstruction of the Local Deity’s Shrine**\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the Zhiyuan era, the year *bingzi*, on the third day of the third lunar month (the day *wuchen* of the first month), the following were respectfully announced to the Enlightened Prefecture and the Great King of Manifest Response, the Local Deity Chen:\n\nThe Perfected Lord, dispatched to inspect Mount Lu, arrived in person and declared: \"By yielding this land, you shall receive divine protection.\" With these words, he vanished.\n\nPresiding over the palace: Zhou Deyi, supervisor and overseer; Zhou Chengyuan, deputy director; Wu Yonghuai, co-supervisor and manager; along with the gatekeepers and the Daoist assembly.",

      "translated_text": "Amidst the nocturnal rush of thunder and lightning, the spring slumber remained undisturbed, and the divine workings of the deity’s abode at the southern foothills continued unbroken. Here, the shrine received its due offerings, and blessings extended near and far. From the Tang through the Song, five hundred years passed in succession. Yet when the Jianyan rebels surged along the river and the *yang*-nine calamity struck, the palace halls were reduced to ashes, and weeds choked the ruins.\n\nSoon after, the dynasty revived, restoring what had collapsed and reviving what had been abandoned. Baskets and trowels renewed the shrine, and incense and flame returned as before. Since the Southern Crossing, the temple halls have been rebuilt time and again, their morning rites as constant as the plow’s labor—all through the deity’s aid.\n\nWho could have foreseen that in the year *yihai*, the shrine would again suffer ruin? The appointed time drew near, and without the deity’s power, all would wither. Heaven and earth upended, the suffering grew unbearable: granaries lay empty, all means exhausted, grain scarce, lives hanging by a thread. A hundred wounds, a thousand gashes—far beyond the trials of years past. Old debts remained unpaid, and new ones mounted. Day and night, there was no respite, no place to honor the divine presence.\n\nUndeterred by our own inadequacy, we resolved to prop up the void with empty hands. By good fortune, the *dānapati* generously offered their joyful alms, and the new shrine took shape, restored to its former site. As completion nears, we rely wholly on the deity’s protection. On this auspicious day, coinciding with the Spring Purification, we present oxen, sheep, and wine, reverently fulfilling our original vow. Young and old gather as one to celebrate the deity’s settled abode.\n\nMay the deity’s transformative power extend to the ten directions, filling the treasuries to abundance. May the tonsured and the laity dwell together in harmony, and landlords and tenants live in mutual peace. May incense and flowers flourish—how could we forget the deity’s gifts?

With measured timber and rebuilt structures, completion was achieved after five years. How splendid the soaring halls, resplendent in vermilion and azure!

May pestilence vanish and granaries overflow. In seasonal rites, how dare we forget to repay the deity’s grace? Partake, O Spirit, and accept our offering.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Traveling Palace of the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Investigative Authority**\n\nThose who speak well of the Way of Heaven stop at spontaneity. Yet its oversight is called \"Heaven’s Surveillance,\" its regard \"Heaven’s Favor,\" its perception and judgment \"Heaven’s Order.\" What Heaven returns to is this: non-action yet nothing left undone, silence yet nothing left unsaid. Spontaneity, in truth, encompasses both substance and function—it merely acts without contrivance.\n\nThe ancients understood this and revered the Way, aligning their hearts with it, assisting in its nurturing transformations, and perpetuating its blessed mandate. If one were to dismiss the Way of Heaven as distant and unattainable, consigning it to remoteness and calling it mere spontaneity, how could this be right?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor and the sage-kings Yao and Shun governed the world with ease, becoming one with Heaven. Yet they never ceased inquiring of the common people, consulting the feudal lords, sharpening their vision and hearing, banishing obscurity and illuminating clarity. How could they have forgotten the world for even a day?\n\nWhen virtue declined, rulers still feared their ears and eyes were insufficiently broad. Thus, they appointed inspectors within and without, so that even distant frontiers could not escape the gates of oversight. This Investigative Palace, then, is Heaven’s own institution, and the establishment of traveling palaces is a matter of human affairs that cannot be neglected.\n\nThe Perfected Lord first manifested auspicious signs at the foot of Mount Shengzhi during the Kaiyuan era, taking residence in the former abode of the Chen clan. Thereafter, in the outskirts of Xunyang, arose the Western Slope Hermitage and the Temple of Longevity. From the shallow shoals of Zhuan to the soaring Kunlun, from the Dragon’s Ascent of Bao Creek to the Purple Yang, all were extensions of the Lord’s shrines. Along the river, rare halls and precious pavilions stood in succession.\n\nThis is not mere busyness. The shrine is called \"Investigative,\" for it serves as Heaven’s supervisory office. The hidden and remote must be illuminated, good and evil meticulously distinguished. Thus, those entrusted with governance under the Investigative Authority must not fail in their duty of benevolent nurture; those who propagate the teachings must not fail in their care for the people. As subjects and children, they must fulfill their loyalty to rulers and filial piety to parents, lest they betray the covering and bearing of Heaven.

      "translated_text": "The significance of this Daoist institution far surpasses that of ordinary temples and incense offerings. Reflecting upon the twin-zhong prefecture—though distant by a hundred li from the sagely governance—its sole branch shrine appears meager compared to those of other regions. The Zhou clan of Cui Lu stands as the foremost family of the prefecture. Among them, Zhou Shu, styled Gongshu, is himself a paragon of the lineage. Having once suffered the ravages of war, his household was left with no survivors. Though he sought an heir far and wide, none was found.\n\nHe pondered: even those who fulfill the common duties of human relationships may lament that not all descendants are worthy. Should misfortune leave one without posterity, the choice of an heir must still prioritize virtue—yet such decisions often remain unresolved for years, difficult to settle. How much more so in my case, where upheaval has left me an impoverished elder, each day uncertain? To seek some infant merely to secure my own survival would be a grave miscalculation. All that my ancestors have painstakingly accumulated—every ounce and inch—would be cast aside lightly. How could my heart find solace in this?\n\nI must inwardly examine my conscience: if my actions can be established before Heaven and Earth, attested to by spirits and gods, and thus align with the aspirations of my ancestors, then even if the matter bends to necessity, how dare I demand it fully conform to worldly conventions? Now, the Investigative Traveling Shrine remains an absent institution in our prefecture. I wish to expand its scope so that my family’s ancestral rites may rely upon the sacred incense of the divine, enduring without end—thus ensuring my ancestors are not left without support.\n\nHaving consulted with Zhou Deyi, Supervisor of the Taiping Xingguo Abbey affairs on Mount Lu, and Zhou Chengyuan, the Abbey’s Director and Daoist Registrar, I now pledge several qing of fields, along with the estate and its structures; several mu of land, where the ancestral graves lie.

In the highest sense, this will allow the offering of splendid prayers to serve as the sagely lord and parent of the people, beseeching Heaven for an enduring mandate. Next, it will emulate the odes of Lu, aiding the worthy ministers who assist the age and guide the people, gathering blessings and prolonging years. The sacred title \"Responsive to the Primordial, Guardian of Destiny, Divine Transformation Manifesting Harmony\" serves as its proof. Further, it will provide a means for my ancestors from the generations of my great-grandfather onward to listen to the Dharma and hear the scriptures, ascending the steps from the mundane to the sagely. Still further, it will enable the villages and communities of my prefecture to daily cultivate meritorious deeds and annually secure abundant harvests.

Before its completion, my uncle passed away from illness at the age of seventy-five. He had previously recounted these events in full and left instructions requesting a record.

Entrusting the continuation of his aspirations and the fulfillment of his undertakings to those beyond the secular world is no light matter. A single word uttered carries weight across both seen and unseen realms, greatly influencing the living. Having entrusted this to such a person in life, in death he will likewise petition the divine. If the petition is granted, then he will have not only fulfilled my uncle’s commission but also borne the charge of the Supreme Perfected.

      "translated_text": "**Record of the Construction of Taiping Xingguo Abbey**\n\nXunyang stands as a key stronghold of Jiangnan, while Mount Lu is the famed mountain of Deyang. It was once ascended by the Great Yu, who carved his inscriptions upon its stone; the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han likewise commemorated their achievements there. The records of these events are clear and abundant—no other mountain can compare.\n\nWithin its peaks, the abodes of Daoists and Buddhists are too numerous to count, yet Taiping Xingguo Abbey alone has gained renown through the numinous dream of the Nine Heavens’ Inspector of Perfected Lords. Since the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, when the emperor received an oracular revelation and bestowed the utmost reverence, he commanded Wu Daozi to paint the deity’s likeness and ordered Du Guzheng to erect a shrine. Miraculously, the timber required for construction replenished itself as it was used—an event that struck all who heard of it as extraordinary.\n\nFrom the Tang dynasty onward, through countless dynastic changes and the shifting of forests and valleys, the site has transformed from a prefectural temple to an abbey. Though it has known rise and decline, the numinosity of the Perfected Lord has endured unwaning. The higher its veneration has grown, the deeper the devotion of the people below—how could any other deity compare?\n\nIn the year *yihai*, as the realm was unified under one rule, the markets of Jiujiang thrived unaltered, and all lived in peace. Yet the abbey lay somewhat distant from the city, and its distance did not spare it from disturbances. The abbey’s overseer, Zhou Deyi, and his deputy, Zhou Chengyuan, were moved by sorrow at the sight of its ruined halls and overgrown fields. They longed to restore it but lacked the means.\n\nAt that time, Left Minister Lü Gongshi held high office. When they brought their plight to him, he promptly provided grain and lent oxen for plowing, enabling them to gather Daoist followers and revive the old estate. Within three years, the rent income gradually recovered. Thus, what had fallen was raised, what had collapsed was rebuilt, and halls, corridors, and chambers were all renewed at once.\n\nThere was a gentleman of Huxi named Zhou Shushu who devoted his entire family fortune to the upkeep of the sacred incense. Some of the abbey’s front fields had been seized by powerful families, but these too were reclaimed. From then on, the abbey’s resources grew abundant, its Daoist community expanded, and the sound of bells and chimes rang daily. When envoys from the ninefold court descended to offer incense from east and west, all who passed by raised their hands to their brows in reverence. The abbey’s transformation delighted both gods and men.\n\nThis was surely the result of the single-minded devotion of the two Zhou gentlemen. Yet had Minister Lü not shown compassion at the outset, how could they have accomplished such a feat?\n\nIn the early years of the Jianyan era, the abbey was once destroyed. The Great Master of the Dao, Zhou Fuxian, swept its ruins and restored it anew. The two gentlemen today are his close descendants, and their connection to this mountain runs deep. As I travel the four quarters, I often lament the countless grand undertakings that have crumbled into ruin, beyond hope of revival. Is it truly that their circumstances made restoration impossible?",

      "translated_text": "Alas, how could one know? Let us survey the abbeys’ manors and their lands in their respective locations, and trace the names of those who made donations—from the most generous to the least. Now, the greatest income from commercial exchange amounts to three thousand six hundred and fifty *mu*, with Shimen alone contributing one thousand two hundred and eighty as the largest share. Those falling short of this are: Qishi, two hundred and eighty; Jinxī, seven hundred and fifty; Shitang, nine hundred and ten; Longgang, nine hundred and sixty; and Shanglongxī, one thousand two hundred and thirty. Of these, only Qishi lies in Xingguo’s Daye, while the rest belong to Jiang’s Dehua.\n\nThe most generous donors number five thousand three hundred and fifty, with Cuilu contributing two thousand two hundred as the largest. Gao’an follows with half that amount, Yuanshan with one thousand two hundred, Wan’an with one thousand seven hundred, Fuxing with one thousand seven hundred and forty, and Zhao Chen with two thousand one hundred. Of these, only Gao’an lies in Yongxing of Xingguo, and Yuanshan in Huangmei of Xin; their former patrons were Li Jiansun and Xiang Zhida. The rest belong to Jiang’s subordinate counties: Cuilu to Hukou, Wan’an to Dean, Fuxing to Pengze, and Zhao Chen to Ruichang. Their patrons—Zhou Shu, Hu Rong, and Lü Shishan—are the same as those recorded on the stele of the Assistant Prefect of Fuzhou Circuit, alongside Qi Yongnian.\n\nAs for manual labor, four tea terraces were opened in Dehua County, named Yixing Manor, comprising forty-two levels in all. Additionally, two thousand *mu* of fields were reclaimed. Five hermitages were first established: three before the abbey—East Taiping, West Taiping, and Ziyuan—and two behind—Yongcui and Gufeng. Initially, all were overgrown with reeds and brambles, grazing grounds for the common folk. Workers were hired to clear the land with axes and hoes, and from the heights, pines, cedars, parasol trees, and tea plants were gathered by seed and sapling, then transplanted in orderly rows. Ginger and taro were planted, along with yams and water chestnuts where rice could not grow. The profits from these were granted to the workers to encourage those who had not yet joined. Having heard of this, I traveled by sedan chair to see for myself. The earliest projects began five years ago, the most recent just a year past. Yet already, the trees spread across the hills, and though the undergrowth is dense, new life sprouts vigorously. The oldest trees now stand tall as men, soon to number in the tens of thousands. Those still in rows, undivided, fill the fields. Bamboo shoots are pruned without harming their roots, and baskets of soil, carried from other mountains, are beyond counting—doubly so, one might imagine. Beneath them, bamboo shoots already cluster, though the groves are not yet fully grown.\n\nMaster Tang ascended a high mound and pointed to the abbey’s groves, saying: “I have heard that the mountains of old were once as overgrown as this. The timber we use now was laid down by our predecessors. There are still several *li* of untamed mountains that could be cleared. If Heaven grants me years enough to persist, perhaps all may yet be opened. In a hundred years, the trees will grow thick as a man’s embrace, providing future generations with the means to maintain the abbey. Then my life in this world will not have been in vain.”\n\nI replied: “Ah! Your words echo the ancient adage, ‘What others discard, I take’—the essence of true wealth. With such a heart, what task cannot be accomplished, what merit cannot be gathered? It is no wonder people are stirred to action, offering what they love, fearing only that their donations may come too late. Otherwise, those fields belong to their own households, on which the people depend for their livelihood. Even a foot of cloth or a peck of rice, given as alms, would be clung to for a time, accepted with reluctance and gratitude before parting.

Those who brought money to gather firewood or charcoal from the mountains were all issued vouchers. Regularly, strong laborers were dispatched to patrol the forests with staves, and those who stole timber were punished. The inflow and outflow of money and grain were meticulously recorded, and even the finest details of milling—down to the last husk—were not overlooked.\n\nThe great kitchen of the public abbey daily steamed ten *hu* of rice, enough to feed a thousand people. All its disciples took their meals in the main hall, arriving always in Daoist robes to show reverence.

In its need, it will inevitably turn to the subsidiary cloisters for aid. The first request may be met, the second delayed, and by the third, the compliant may appease with kind words, while the unyielding will refuse outright.

      "translated_text": "Yang Taiming resigned from office to study the Dao on Mount Lu. Taiming, originally a county magistrate of Chang’an, was a scholar by birth, filial to his parents, and was known as \"Filial Yang.\" He once served in Guo Ziyi’s幕府, by nature serene and indifferent to official advancement. He often advised Ziyi, saying: \"Though military governance values strictness, human life is of utmost weight—one must not kill lightly.\" Ziyi commanded troops for over twenty years, ruling with leniency and refraining from indiscriminate executions. His soldiers cherished him as a father or elder brother, all due to Taiming’s subtle counsel.\n\nIn the first year of Yongtai (765 CE), he resigned his post and came to the peaks of Mount Lu, where he built a hut. He prepared *qingjing* rice and consumed it to practice *bigu* (grain avoidance). Burning incense, he prayed to the Perfected King of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy, seeking the Dao of immortality. For fourteen years, he persisted. One autumn evening, the sky cleared after rain. Suddenly, at his place of morning worship, he saw a divine being in a golden crown and crimson robe, adorned with white pearl strands. Beside him stood one holding a jade axe and another bearing a jade casket.\n\nThe divine being said: \"I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy, sent to inspect human good and evil. For your lifelong merits toward the people, your pure and arduous heart, and your steadfast cultivation of the Dao, your sincerity has reached the Nine Heavens. The Three Primordial Lords of Jade Purity and Great Simplicity have commanded me to bestow upon you the *Scripture of the Great Perfected Dao of the Nine Heavens*.\" Taiming prostrated himself, kowtowing in gratitude. He slowly opened the jade casket and received the sacred text. The divine being admonished him, saying: \"Persist in diligent practice without fail. On the day your Dao is perfected, I shall summon you.\" With these words, winds and clouds surged, and the divine being vanished. Upon opening the scripture, he found it to be the *Supreme Scripture of the Great Cavern*, in thirty-nine chapters.\n\nFrom then on, Taiming followed the scripture’s practices, withdrawing from the world. For thirty-six years, he remained secluded. In the eighth year of Yuanhe (813 CE), on the first day of the first lunar month at noon, auspicious clouds descended to welcome him. Taiming ascended upon the clouds.\n\n*From* Records of Encounters with Perfected Immortals\n\nLi Yunxiang’s Merits in Medicine and the Dao\nYunxiang was a recluse of the Tang. He often said that lofty immortals and perfected beings must accumulate hidden merits to aid others and uphold precepts with precision. Thus, he devoted himself to medicine. Gifted with keen insight, he never harmed living creatures in his prescriptions, using only minerals, herbs, and plants. He transmitted ancient immortal formulas to later generations. When his methods required insects or fish as medicine, he refrained from hasty action, taking this as a caution. Later, he came to reside on Mount Lu.\n\nPatients from several prefectures filled his door, yet he accepted no gifts of silk or wealth. He abstained from desires and meat, living near the Temple of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy. Each morning, he burned incense and prayed: \"Yunxiang uses medicine to relieve the people’s suffering, seeking no profit. May I never waver in this resolve for all future lives. May the divine and numinous grant me protection.\" He lived on the mountain for over sixty years, his complexion golden and lustrous, his gaze piercing. Those who knew him attributed this to his hidden virtues.\n\nOne day, while following herb-gatherers into the depths of the mountains, he suddenly saw a man in a round cap and purple robe, his face like carved jade, his bearing majestic, his beard and brows as if painted. Yunxiang, struck by his extraordinary appearance, visited him the next morning and inquired. The man said: \"I am Gong Qingchang. My family is from Luoyang. In my youth, I met Sima Yinyuan at the foot of Mount Minggao. Yinyuan claimed to be a spirit official of the Weiyu Grotto-Heaven. Each of the Five Peaks, Four Seas, and grotto-heavens has spirit officials who assess merits and transgressions, reporting good and evil to the Court of the Nine Heavens’ Envoy. Yinyuan told me: 'In a past life, you held an important post and labored to redress grievances and exonerate the wrongfully killed. The people silently benefited from you. When Zhu Ci usurped the throne, you died for loyalty, your righteous indignation unwavering. Thus, you were reborn as a human. In time, you will awaken and recall these memories.' The Nine Heavens’ Envoy recorded your merits and commanded me to transmit to you the methods of the *Stone Essence and Golden Light Concealing Form Sword*, the *Silent Audience of the Central Yellow Great One*, by which you may transcend the world. Recently, I ascended Purple Cloud Peak to observe the *qi*, and saw demonic vapors beyond the ridge. I intended to exorcise them but passed by the mountain shrine, so I came to pay respects.\"\n\nYunxiang treated him with reverence. Qingchang instructed his attendant to fetch a zither and played melodies such as *Golden Whale Leaping the Sea*, *Raindrops on Autumn Lotuses*, *Drunken Panning the Moon*, and *White Snow Prelude*. The tones were pure and transcendent, unlike ordinary sounds. After several days of companionship, at parting, Yunxiang bowed and said: \"Fortunate to have met you, may I follow you on a southern journey?\" Qingchang replied: \"Not yet. You must still pursue an official career. In eighteen years, we shall meet at Mount Zhongtiao.\"\n\n*From* Comprehensive Records of Divine Medicines\n\nXiang Ziwen’s Encounter with Gong Qingchang\nZiwen was from Changsha. In the second year of Baoli (826 CE), he was appointed to Hengzhou but was too poor to return home. Enamored of the scenic mountains and rivers, one day, during the height of summer, he visited the Yue Temple and stayed for over ten days. Suddenly, he saw a man in a black cloth robe lined with purple, his face like polished jade, his demeanor dignified, his beard and brows as if drawn. Ziwen marveled at his extraordinary appearance. The next morning, he visited and inquired. The man said: \"I am Gong Qingchang. My family is from Luoyang. In my youth, I met Sima Yinyuan at the foot of Mount Minggao. Yinyuan claimed to be a spirit official of the Weiyu Grotto-Heaven.

You should promptly select an auspicious site to complete this great matter.\" Ziwen wept and bowed in gratitude, then departed with light steps.\n\n*From* The Southern Journey of Minister Li Wen\n\n**Xu the Remonstrator Repairs the Temple with Private Funds**\nThe Remonstrator, appointed as Jiangxi Military Commissioner in the second year of the Dahe era of the Tang, used thirty thousand *min* of his own money to renovate the Lushan Temple of the Divine Envoy, commissioning artisans to apply cinnabar and bright pigments. The magistrate of Xunyang dispatched an official to oversee the work. The official entered the city to summon a painter, then returned with him, the artisan bearing pigments on his back. As they left the city gate, the official suddenly stripped off his robe and belt and cast them to the ground. The painter, suspecting drunkenness, retrieved them and followed. Soon after, the official discarded his clothes and hat. After traveling thirty *li*, he was barely clothed. Nearing the temple, a figure like a sturdy soldier, clad in black with a white leather apron, emerged from the ravine and seized the official, dragging him away. The painter cried out: \"He is merely drunk—pardon him!\" The soldier only glared, dragging the official to sit in the water. The painter then realized he was a ghost and fled in terror to alert those at the temple. When they returned together, the black-clad figure had vanished, and the official sat as before—dead. Upon reviewing the accounts, they found that half the funds had been embezzled.\n\n*From* Remnants of the Taiping Era\n\n**Liu Deben Donates Wealth to Relieve Famine**\nDeben, styled Xiaoshu, was a native of Ezhou. Skilled in many arts and fond of antiquity, he sought no official position but traveled as a merchant on the great river. In the tenth month of the sixth year of the Qianfu era of the Tang, Huang Chao captured Ezhou, causing panic along the Yangtze. Judging himself unable to return home, Deben distributed ten thousand *shi* of grain to the starving poor and took refuge on Mount Lu. One day, a Daoist with disheveled hair and a deerskin robe visited, declining to give his name. They roamed the mountain together for a year. One day, wandering to the foot of the Five Elders Peak to admire the scenery, they lost track of time until dusk. Hand in hand, they entered a ravine and saw an old man leaning on a staff within a stone gate. Deben bowed and recounted his journey. The old man said joyfully: \"Come with me to the rear courtyard.\" After walking four or five *li*, they saw a gate, resplendent in cinnabar and azure, inscribed in golden seal script: *Gate of Purple Radiance*. Upon entering, they beheld tiered pavilions and interconnected halls, guarded by stern sentinels. Deben trembled, not daring to lift his gaze. The old man said: \"This is the Grotto-Heaven of Chanting Perfection. The True King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, surveys the mortal realm. You have donated vast family wealth to relieve the starving—your virtuous deed is commendable, and thus you are permitted to visit this divine abode. Your name shall be inscribed in the *Register of Immortals of the Nine Heavens*, and you shall transcend death.\" Deben bowed again and asked: \"Where does the True King, Envoy of the Nine Heavens, reside?\" The old man replied: \"You have been reborn four times in this human form, burdened by deep karmic obstructions from past lives.

During the great famine of the jiachen year, he learned that Yuzhang alone had a good harvest and led his troops there. En route, tensions arose between the two armies. By the time they reached Wuchang, hostilities had escalated, and battle seemed imminent despite all attempts to stop it. Huaiwu then drew his sword and addressed his men: ‘Our journey today has no other purpose but to save lives. Why, then, do you allow petty grievances to drive you to mutual slaughter? If you fight, the strong will be wounded, the weak will perish—why abandon your homeland and die on the road?’ He continued: ‘The conflict exists because of me.

      "translated_text": "Wen Biao, styled Zhongbing, was the son of a farming family from Dehua County in Jiangzhou. Diligent in study and profoundly filial, at sixteen he traveled to the Imperial Academy. In the seventh year of the Yuanfeng era, his father fell gravely ill. Biao hastened to the Hall of Visitation, prayed for leave to return home, then slit open his abdomen and excised his liver, from which he prepared twenty-four medicinal pellets. These he mixed with other herbs and administered to his father, whose illness immediately abated. When the prefecture and county learned of the matter, they sought to report it to the imperial court. Biao wept and said, “This is but the ordinary duty of a son—why make it known?” Thus his reputation grew even greater. His father lived another twenty-four years before passing away, the same number as the liver pellets. When Biao first cut out his liver, he mistakenly incised his right flank, whereupon he suddenly heard a voice from the void say, “It is on the left.” He swiftly withdrew the blade, then cut into his left side and obtained it. Blood flowed across the ground, and his spirit dimmed into darkness. In a daze, he saw a Daoist offer him a red bird to eat, and he revived. Later, Biao journeyed again to the capital but died en route. His family established a shrine beside the palace. Cai Songxi of Mount Song inscribed a poem:\n\n*I hear that in those days he carved out his liver,*\n*Ten thousand spirits in the Nine Heavens’ halls looked on.*\n*The blood still stains the blade that plucked the blossom,*\n*While the father, swallowing the medicine, rests at ease within.*\n*His lofty conduct reached the ears of the Supreme Emperor,*\n*Yet fine renown was never sought, nor high office.*\n*Where has that peerless purity of jade now gone?*\n*Surely to the Three Mountains, riding a rainbow phoenix.*\n\nIn the fifth year of the Qiandao era, Biao’s nephew Wen Jie likewise cut flesh from his thigh to cure his mother’s illness. At the time, Sima Zhibai composed *Records of the Filial Sons Wen*. From *Prefectural Gazetteer of Filial Conduct*\n\nGao Yunju Reads the *Great Cavern Scripture*\nYunju was a recluse from Qiantang. Devoted to the Dao, he delighted in reading the *Great Cavern Scripture*, his every movement guided by its precepts. One day, a cloud chariot descended from the heavens in a blaze of radiance. A figure alighted, his crown and robes shimmering with rosy light, his countenance gleaming like jade. Yunju bowed deeply in reverence. The immortal asked, “Do you read this scripture—do you also comprehend its essence?” Yunju replied, “I have heard it is the exalted text of thirty-nine chapters. Yet though I study it privately, I have not yet grasped its profound meaning.” The immortal smiled and said, “I am the Nine Heavens’ Envoy of Visitation. Hearing of your tireless reading of the *Cavern Scripture*, I came to observe. If you persist without ceasing, in time you will naturally attain its mysteries. You must strive diligently.” Before the words were finished, he suddenly ascended into the void and vanished.",

      "translated_text": "From *Li Wenzheng Gong’s Southern Journey Records*\n\n**Zhou Ju Receives the Ten-Character Scripture by Divine Transmission**\n\nZhou Ju was a native of Wu. In the first year of the Jianyan era, he returned to his hometown from the capital. At that time, false rebels and bandits arose on all sides. Suddenly, a figure in a star-crowned cap and feathered robes appeared, saying, “Tomorrow you will perish in the calamity of war. If you recite the Ten-Character Scripture, you may escape death, resolve grievances, and prolong your life.” Zhou knelt to the ground and entreated him. The feathered-robed one said, “The *Nine Heavens Responding to Primal Thunder, Universally Transforming Heavenly Worthy*—this is the Ten-Character Scripture.” Having bowed to receive it, Zhou looked up, but the figure had vanished. He suspected it was a divine transmission and steadfastly committed the words to memory.\n\nThe next day, he indeed encountered bandits who pursued him into the woods. In his distress and fear, he urgently recited the invocation. Before the sound had left his lips, thunder crashed violently. The bandits, terrified, fled, and he thus escaped disaster.\n\nFrom *Zhao Xuelao’s Records*\n\n**Retreat of Zhang’s Bandits in the Jianyan Era**\n\nIn the winter of the first year of the Jianyan era, the rebel Zhang Yu gathered tens of thousands of followers, crossed the Huai River, and seized Chizhou. On the tenth day of the twelfth month, they advanced upon Jiangzhou. At the time, the prefect, Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion and Grand Master for Court Audiences Chen Yanwen, donned armor himself, led the people, and ascended the city walls, vowing to defend to the death. The bandits besieged the city for three days, and the situation grew perilous. The people of the prefecture wailed and prayed, prostrating toward the mountains in supplication.\n\nSuddenly, banners appeared above the clouds, and a halo of radiance spread across the fields. A true form emerged, seated upon a lion, resembling a dragon-horse, with an entourage of riders arrayed in the misty qi. The entire city beheld it. Moments later, a great snowfall began, and the bandits, unable to endure the open air, suffered heavy casualties. A thousand-strong cavalry unit entered the palace grounds, setting fires everywhere, yet even bamboo huts and paper curtains would not ignite. Glancing at the palace gates, they seemed to perceive something, and in panic, they fled.\n\nAfter the bandits retreated, the prefect and the people of the prefecture held a thanksgiving jiao ritual for over a month. To this day, the scholars and commoners of Jiangcheng hold an assembly and perform a jiao ritual on the seventh day of the fourth month each year, a tradition originating from this event.\n\nFrom *Old Records of the Prefectural Palace*\n\n**Prefect Chen Yanwen’s Thanksgiving Jiao Ritual Address:**\n\nThe Vermilion Emperor of Jade Clarity, resplendent in numinous power, has long guarded this famed mountain. The True King of the Golden Portal, bestowing blessings, first established his foundation in this land of fortune. Such matters are known in ancient times, and the rites are revered in our present dynasty. Recently, the Huai bandits have run rampant, and violent rebels have raged with insolence.

Gazing toward the Jade Palace, we pleaded for deliverance, exhausting our sincerest offerings in desperate supplication. Then, banners of divine might appeared, qi coalescing into dragon-horses, auspicious clouds gathering on all sides—we knew the numinous hosts had come to our defense. For days, heavy snow fell, and the enemy’s advance was silently broken. With reverence for the Dao’s power, how could we fail to purify our hearts? Now, in humble observance of the profound rites, we seek to repay this boundless grace.\n\nMay the rainbow banners and feathered canopies descend briefly from the celestial heights; may the wind-borne steeds and cloud chariots deign to visit this grotto-palace.

At that time, the Nine Heavens’ Investigating Perfected Lord deigned to extend his protection from the clouds, granting the people of the prefecture a new lease on life. Thereafter, the scholars and commoners of the region reverently journeyed to this blessed site to perform the jiao ritual in thanksgiving.\n\nLater, during the Jiading era, when war reached the outskirts of Ezhou and disaster spread across several prefectures, the crisis pressed upon Jiujiang’s borders. The people, fearing death’s approach, wept as they beseeched the Perfected Lords—only to witness their prayers answered with deliverance, the demonic forces instantly dispelled. Recalling past mercies, how could our gratitude ever be repaid?\n\nThus, we gather in assembly to conduct a grand thanksgiving jiao ritual of one hundred and twenty altar stations. We humbly pray that weapons of war may forever fall silent and the entire region enjoy enduring peace. May every household be blessed with a hundredfold prosperity.",

      "translated_text": "The Zhou Clan’s Tragedy on a Timber Raft\nThe Zhou family of Ruichang County, wealthy and influential in their region, traded extensively along the rivers and lakes. In the third year of the Shaoxing era, they purchased a large raft of upper-river cedar, valued at over one hundred thousand strings of cash, intending to transport it to Jiankang for sale. They entrusted the journey to a man of the same surname from Jiujiang, who had long prepared for the voyage. This man visited the Hall of the Perfected Lord of Lushan’s Celestial Inspection and drew a divination slip, which read:\n\n*Looking around, whence comes the one?*\n*Holding doubt, you harbor a second mind.*\n*If you cannot turn back now,*\n*How will you avoid sinking?*\n\nThe Zhou clansman, however, insisted the preparations were complete and refused to halt the journey. As soon as the raft reached the mouth of the Mi River, it indeed capsized.\n\n*From the Yijian Chronicles, Bing Volume*\n\nThe Execution of the Traitorous Xi in the Kaixi Era\nIn the twelfth month of the second year of the Kaixi era, Wu Xi, Vice-Commissioner of the Sichuan Pacification Office and Commander of Xingzhou, rebelled. On the eighteenth day of the first month of the following year, he usurped the title of King of Shu and dispatched his false general, Lu Xi, to garrison Kui Gate. The regional commander, Jiang Jie, surrendered his seal to him. Lu Xi arrived at Kui on the nineteenth day of the second month. Jiang Jie fled downriver and, on the twenty-fourth day, moored at Wanzhou. Among his retainers was a man named Zhao Tan, skilled in summoning spirits. That evening, Jiang ordered Zhao to perform a divination regarding his course of action and the fortunes of good or ill. The planchette pen moved with extraordinary speed, suddenly inscribing:\n\n*Wu Xi, having received the nation’s favor for generations, dares to plot treason and usurpation, threatening to deliver the four regions of Shu to barbarian rule. The Celestial Inspector of the Nine Heavens has memorialized his crimes, and the Supreme Emperor, enraged, has decreed the extermination of his clan. This shall come to pass within three months—keep it secret.*\n\nFearing that the revelation of the divine words would bring disaster, Jiang sealed the message tightly. On the tenth day of the third month, he reached Zhongzhou, where he encountered an official bulletin announcing that Wu Xi had indeed been executed on the twenty-ninth day of the second month. Jiang gathered a dozen or so retainers to open the seal, and all marveled in astonishment. Wanzhou lay over two thousand *li* from Xingzhou, yet the spirit’s pronouncement had preceded Wu Xi’s death by five days. Truly extraordinary!\n\nIn the fourth day of the last summer month of that year, Xue Fu, Gentleman for Announcing Teaching of the Sichuan Pacification Office, respectfully recorded this account. The inscription remains preserved in this palace.\n\nQian Fangping’s Divine Transmission of the *Yunsheng Chapter*\nFangping, a native of Huaihai, was resting at his desk on the Lantern Festival of the fourth year of the Chunyou era, the sun lingering at its zenith, when his spirit grew faint and he dozed off. In his dream, a Daoist with a topknot addressed him, saying, “I am Lord Yingyuan.” Before Fangping could respond, the Daoist reached into his robe and produced a scroll bearing written instructions. Fangping read aloud:\n\n*The Dao’s traces aid the mysterious transformation,*\n*Clouds and mist solemnly awe the spirits.*\n*In the purity of the numinous cavern,*\n*A myriad realms follow the circling flow.*\n\n*With reverence, the radiant Perfected assemble,*\n*Their light illumining the floating world.*\n*They bow and summon the Emperor’s household,*\n*Turning the images to brighten the flying palanquin.*\n\n*When the turning of fate is thus raised,*\n*Its distant depths cannot be sought.*\n*The forest of Peng soars with its lingering shade,*\n*The phoenix’s nature defies reckoning.*\n\n*Jade medicines bloom with perching fragrance,*\n*The forbidden palace unfurls divine schemes.*\n*The secret writ cherishes the veiled communion,*\n*As the six revolutions journey toward the primordial.*\n\n*Feathered transcendents transcend the kalpas’ wheel,*\n*Timely aiding the void and the yielding.*\n*The stripping away reveals the six depths,*\n*As islands gather upon the mountain’s peak.*\n\n*Jade leaves cling to the treasure phoenix,*\n*Scrutiny and elevation dissolve into empty seclusion.*\n*The rainbow banner marks the assistant’s presence,*\n*Attending and ministering to the worthy companions.*\n\n*Great is the midst of the primordial chaos,*\n*Where all beings cast their victorious qi.*\n*The Yellow Chamber feasts the steed’s honor,*\n*The nine canopies vie with the sovereign’s retinue.*\n\n*Descending and turning, you attain the subtlest,*\n*Opening the teaching at the Three Towers.*\n*You evade and again submit to fate,*\n*As the royal tally halts for a thousand autumns.*\n\nWhen he finished, the Daoist said, “This is the *Yunsheng Chapter of the Nine Heavens*. Commit it to memory, and one day come to the Taiping Palace to seek me.” Fangping recited it rapidly, memorizing it all, and wished to inquire further into its origins. Suddenly, his family startled him awake, leaving the matter utterly inexplicable.",
