  "full_translation": "**Record of Perfected Wang of Panshan Dwelling in Clouds**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Record of Perfected Wang of Panshan Dwelling in Clouds*\nCompiled by Jin Wangzhi with reverence.\nArranged by disciple Lun Zhihuan.\nOne fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to the Record of Perfected Wang of Panshan Dwelling in Clouds**\n\nThe blind cannot discern the colors of blue and yellow; the deaf cannot perceive the sounds of pipes and flutes. Yet is this only so for the physical form? The mind and intellect are likewise afflicted. Though the original, Heaven-endowed true nature is complete in all people, it is obscured by accumulated dust, leaving the correct vision unclear. Chasing after forms and sounds, seeking traces and tracks, one sinks into the evil paths, drifting through a thousand kalpas of rebirth—mistaking a bamboo tube for sunlight, striking a bronze plate for the radiance of day. Without encountering a true master, how can black and white be distinguished? Clinging to hollow phrases and rigid texts only deepens confusion.\n\nThus, Master Dwelling in Clouds, unable to bear this, administered medicine to cure the affliction: prying open deaf ears, scraping away the film from dimmed eyes, hoping that all might see clearly, each awaken their hearing, and in every act of seeing and hearing, become free and unburdened, returning to the correct Way without chasing the lost sheep.\n\nMaster Liu, a gentleman among the disciples, having followed the teacher for years, secretly recorded the master’s admonitions and gathered them into a collection of over a hundred entries. Truly, this serves as a guide for beginners on the path of the Dao. Now, it is entrusted to craftsmen for printing, that its transmission may be broadened.\n\nThe Recluse of Solitary Peak, having also been counted among the least of the disciples, rejoiced upon seeing this work. He purified himself with fasting and ablutions, then respectfully composed a preface for it.\n\nWritten on the first day of the first lunar month in the year *dingwei*, by disciple Lun Zhihuan.\n\n*Recorded Sayings of Perfected Wang of Dwelling-in-Clouds on Mount Pan*\nCompiled by disciple Lun Zhihuan\n\nAt that time, the master was on Mount Pan and expounded widely, saying:\nFor beginners on the path of the Dao, if you immediately try to comprehend where words fail, you will find no grounding, no support, and doubt will surely arise. If the mind lacks cultivation, faith will be insufficient; without sufficient faith, practice cannot proceed. Without proper practice, one strays into disorderly learning, and over time, grows lax and retreats.\n\nNow, let me speak to you of what lies before your eyes and within your ears—where faith is sufficient, proceed in practice. Starting from the coarse and entering the subtle will not lead you astray. Even in sounds and forms, the functioning of the Dao is present.\n\nWhat is meant by \"where faith is sufficient\"?\nDo you not see the vast emptiness, the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, wind and clouds? These are all clearly before your eyes—this is the model for cultivation, the gateway to entering the Dao.\n\nConsider how clouds emerge from mountains: they come and go without intent, drifting freely and at ease, untethered by circumstances or objects. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr observe how wind stirs and animates the ten thousand things: it rushes forth and returns, utterly without obstruction, leaving no trace. Grass and trees, thickets and forests cannot hinder it—it passes through with effortless clarity. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr consider the great mountains: towering and majestic, steadfast and unshaken, unmoved by anything that touches them. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr water, which by nature is yielding and flows downward, nourishing grasses and plants, never contending with things. It adapts to square or round, its essence clear and still. When it gathers into rivers and seas, it embraces the hundred streams without distinction, encompassing fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs alike. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the sun and moon, which illuminate all within their radiance, impartial and without favor, shining in all directions day and night, boundless and luminous. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the heavens above, whose essence is ever pure, pure yet all-embracing, covering all without exception. Toward the ten thousand beings, they bring benefit without harm. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the tranquility of the great earth: still and unmoving, bearing the weight of the ten thousand things, without partiality or bias. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the vastness of empty space, boundless and without limit, containing all, embracing all—whether sentient or insentient, covering heaven and supporting earth. It neither distinguishes nor rejects, neither moves nor rests, neither exists nor does not exist, neither clings to nor departs from the ten thousand things. It holds the clarity of heaven, the stillness of earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, and the transformations of the ten thousand things—yet empty space remains undivided. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nThe Dao is one with heaven and earth, and its functioning is thus. Its essence resides within; when cultivation matures, comprehension arises naturally. In movement and action, one harmonizes with the Dao, and there is always a master within. If you seek beyond where words and thoughts cease, you will lose it.\n\nHaving entered the gate of the mysterious, each of you should strive diligently.\n\nSomeone asked: How does a beginner in cultivation enter the gate of refining the mind-ground?\nThe master replied: Sever in one stroke the mind that clings to love and attachment, schemes and calculations, premeditations and regrets, the mind that entraps and ensnares others. Abandon entirely the attachments to wine, sensuality, wealth, and temper; to right and wrong, self and others; to clinging, affection, and desire; to private motives, perverse thoughts, profit-seeking, and craving. Free from external burdens, the body becomes light and unencumbered. Free from internal defilements, the mind becomes light and unburdened. With long and thorough practice, delusive thoughts naturally cease. Constantly guard and attend to it: be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, reduce sleep, and harmonize inner and outer. When the dust and grime are entirely cleansed and not a single thing remains, your original life-spirit will naturally manifest, and you will enjoy effortless mastery—this is the supreme Daoist.\n\nSomeone asked: How does one who cultivates attain purity and stillness?\nThe master replied: When the mind does not chase after things, it is at peace. When the mind does not cling to things, it is empty. A mind that is both at peace and empty is pure and still. Purity and stillness are the Dao itself.\n\nSomeone asked: Those who cultivate often speak of eliminating emotions and desires—is there anything beyond this?\nThe master replied: When emotions are eliminated, one reaches non-emotion; when desires are eliminated, one attains non-desire. What, then, is this state of non-emotion and non-desire?\n\nSomeone asked: Those who cultivate insist on not being deluded—how can one avoid delusion?\nThe master replied: In the beginning, before the mind is refined, one does not know how to enter or exit, how to gather or release. When encountering circumstances or things, one clings to them entirely, muddled and confused, only ceasing when exhausted. Failing to recognize oneself is delusion. It is like being reborn without awareness, unknowingly slipping into another shell, only to return when the karma is exhausted—this is the result of delusion. If one relies solely on knowledge or awareness, one is deluded by knowledge and awareness.\n\nFor those who cultivate, if in every moment of the twelve double-hours they examine themselves and are not stained by anything, passing lightly through circumstances and objects, this is not being deluded.\n\nSomeone asked: How should one safeguard the matters of nature and life?\nThe master replied: Even when moving amidst the myriad dusty realms, though one may respond and harmonize, one must remain the master. Do not blindly follow things. Let affairs not hinder the mind, and let the mind not hinder affairs.\n\nGuard it as you would your eyes, so that even the finest speck of dust cannot enter when they are closed. If you protect it thus, in time you will see its efficacy. But if the mind admits anything, it will be led away by external things and lose mastery.\n\nSomeone asked: My thoughts flow ceaselessly, and I cannot sweep them all away—what then?\nThe master replied: Sweeping the mind-ground daily only stirs up more restlessness. If you wish the mind-ground to be still, lay down the broom’s handle.\n\nThe questioner bowed in gratitude.\n\nSomeone asked: Those who cultivate from the beginning must first establish resolve. How should one establish resolve?\nThe master replied: In every moment—whether in movement or stillness, amid all circumstances, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—keep the mind on the Dao. When encountering demons, do not waver; when facing harm, do not falter. Be thus in safety, be thus in peril. Stake this body without hesitation, with no backward glance. Advance with unflagging diligence, fearing neither life nor death—such is a person of resolve. Thus the scripture says: *\"The strong in practice are those of resolve.\"*\n\nLater, the master arrived at Nangong. At Changzhen Abbey, he sat in meditation through the night and addressed the assembly: Those who first leave the household life cannot yet stand alone and must rely on the monastic community. Whether forming bonds with fellow cultivators or traveling with companions, they should support one another to avoid bias. Yet there are three kinds of companions:\n\nSome are *cloud companions and mist friends*—those who share the same aspirations, refine the mind-ground, investigate karma, sever worldly attachments, and wander beyond the dusty realm. Seeking like-minded souls, they become friends. These are called *cloud companions and mist friends*, for their minds resemble clouds and mist, untouched by worldly affairs.\n\nOthers study scriptures and teachings, play the qin, recite poetry, engage in lofty discussions, and debate right and wrong. These are called *good companions and wise friends*, for though they do not refine the mind, they at least refrain from evil.\n\nThen there are those who neither cultivate the mind-ground nor study scriptures, who disregard karma, speak perversely, act recklessly, and at the slightest provocation stir up conflict. They boast of their strength, flaunt their prowess, bully the good, and form cliques. These are called *wild companions and strange friends*.\n\nAfter the death of these three kinds of people, each is placed according to their deeds and receives their due retribution. The *cloud companions and mist friends* ascend into the formless, roaming the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or celestial officials. The *good companions and wise friends*, their worldly minds not yet exhausted, remain within the human realm, cycling through rebirth. The *wild companions and strange friends*, having received offerings from all directions yet lacking merit to repay their karmic debts, may fall into the Dark Prison or sink into the animal realm, returning to the paths of suffering. When it comes to this, regret is too late. Those of wisdom and discernment should ponder this carefully and seek the most advantageous path.\n\nIf someone asks, *\"How does one recognize the awakened nature?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"Pointing east while drawing west—such empty gestures are best abandoned. Better to apply real effort instead. For instance, when the heart harbors passions, desires, afflictions, or the delusions of self and others, it is like standing before a vast, slippery well of glass. If you fail to watch even the slightest misstep, you will fall in and remain trapped for ten thousand kalpas. Only when you first perceive the danger and prepare to step forward—then swiftly retreat—does this act of vigilant retreat reveal your awakened nature. If you have already fallen into the pit of self and others, yet still gesture at emptiness and prattle about transcendent matters, how does this concern awakening?\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"What is the settled nature?\"*\nThe master shifts his seat, moves closer, and sits upright in silence for a long while.\nHe says: *\"What settled nature do you ask about?\"*\nThe questioner does not understand. A nearby elder rises, bows deeply, and expresses gratitude.\nThe master says: *\"Zhang drinks the wine, but Li becomes drunk.\"*\nThe questioner laughs heartily and says no more.\n\nIf someone asks, *\"I left the household life to resolve the great matter of birth and death, yet my seeking remains unclear, and I drift in reckless abandon. What is the meaning of this?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"A single thought of non-arising is non-dying. Those who cannot grasp this do so because the heart clings to emotions while the nature gathers dust. As emotions and dust play their games, birth and death never cease. To seek liberation, relinquish whatever arises—relinquish again and again until not even a trace remains, and the original source is pristine. Do not chase sounds, do not chase forms. In every place, be at ease, empty and carefree. Through heaven’s duration and earth’s endurance, the true sovereign will become self-evident. When the heart is upright, all things are upright; when the heart is crooked, all things are crooked. With an inner master established, even beloved things cannot disturb the six senses. Once the true essence is ever-still, what birth and death remain to fear? Yet when one reaches this state, there may arise an uncontrollable restlessness—like a demon’s possession—where the spirit scatters outward in wild abandon, unable to govern itself. Taking this as true joy or true bliss, one fails to recognize that joy without joy is true joy, bliss without bliss is true bliss, and knowledge without knowledge is true knowledge. Now, deluded by the discriminating mind and invaded by perverse qi, one drifts in reckless abandon, beyond any remedy. Some imitate the ancients by singing and dancing in their practice, unaware that even then, such acts were but means to loosen bonds and find release—ways of self-delight, not license to indulge the senses and deceive the world.\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"When the eyes are open, there are dusty realms; when closed, there are dream realms; in crowds, there are realms of adversity and favor. How can one remain at peace?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"For the practitioner, gathering the heart is fundamental. When adversity arises, pass through it with joy; when favor arises, pass through it without attachment. What concern are dusty realms to you? Among others, even a three-year-old child should not be opposed or offended. Always yield. When others oppose or offend you, always endure. In enduring and yielding, merit naturally accrues. When all people show respect, bear all difficulties yourself. Over time, as these responses become habitual, the heart grows pure and stable. In every realm, pass through with equanimity, without the slightest disturbance. Amidst the ten thousand conditions, the heart finds peace, untouched by even a speck of dust—pure and untainted, awake day and night. This accords with the heart of the sages.\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"‘To know the One is to complete all things.’ It is also said, ‘Embrace the primordial and guard the One.’ What, then, is this One?\"*\nThe master says: *\"It is the undifferentiated nature, the state before distinctions arise. Once you know of its existence, you fall into enumeration and can no longer be One. One gives rise to two, two to three, three to the ten thousand things—how can you guard it? Better to be without even the One. Thus, the patriarchs say: ‘Embracing the primordial and guarding the One is effort—yet through heaven’s duration and earth’s endurance, even the One is absent.’ In this absence of the One, the clarity of your own original portion emerges—yet it is not nothing. As the sutra says: ‘To know emptiness as not empty, to know form as not form—this is called illumination.’\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"Some monastics study the ancients’ gong’an, others study scriptures. Is it true that the ancient teachings illuminate the heart?\"*\nThe master says: *\"The practitioner refines their own heart to ascend from the ordinary to the sagely. Yet since leaving the household, they refuse to take the heart as their task, instead rummaging through the words of the ancients, making a living from ink on paper, counting lines and tallying characters, entangling themselves in vines of discourse. They exhaust all effort—yet what does it avail? When King Yama comes to call, not a single phrase or word will serve. They would have been better off passing their days in ignorance, for that bears some resemblance to the truth. Instead of chasing such efforts, turn to your own original task. Then you will not waste time in vain.\"*\n\nSomeone asks, *\"What is one’s own original task?\"*\n*\"It is that luminous spark which governs the body, received from the Dao, ever-present from ancient times to the present—what could be lacking? When you verify this principle clearly, it becomes the proof of transcending the ordinary and entering the sagely. If you trust this, begin your practice at once. You already possess such a gong’an—why count others’ treasures as your own? Quickly turn to your own use, and from now on, you will not be deceived by others.\"*\n\nOnce, while engaged in labor, the master gave a general discourse:\n*\"Long ago, beneath the Eastern Hall, there was a carpenter named Zhang the Immortal. He never opposed others, always humble and yielding, never showing anger in his expression.\"*\n\nThe assembly all approved and constantly praised him, and word of this reached the Perfected One. The Perfected One said, *\"Not yet. Let him be tested further, and then it may be so.\"* It is like gold: until it has been refined, its authenticity cannot be known. One day, the Perfected One ordered him to make a meditation bench. The man responded at once and set to work. Before he had finished, he was told to make doors and windows, and though he complied for the moment, a hint of impatience arose. Before half the work was done, he was ordered to make several small boxes, whereupon he refused outright. He argued before the Perfected One, saying he wished to finish one task before beginning another. The Perfected One then said, *\"Formerly, the assembly praised you for being able to respond to others without resistance and without stirring your mind. Today, however, you have failed the test.\"*\n\n*\"For one who cultivates the Way, tempering the mind in response to affairs, there must first be a master within—calm, at ease, and harmonious. Externally, one responds to matters with perfect accuracy. What is to be done first, and what later? Respond to what is most pressing. Even if bones are ground to powder and the body shattered, the mind must not stir. What does it matter whether this task or that is done first? All are but provisional things, without any fixed substance. The mind must die; the mechanism must be alive. Simply respond to what is most pressing in the moment, steadily and securely, without agitation or delusion. This is what is meant by 'constantly responding, constantly still.' \"*\n\nSomeone asked, *\"It is said that karmic connections span three lifetimes. Is this truly so?\"*\nThe master replied, *\"Have you not heard the words of the ancients: 'When delusion is ended, karmic obstructions are fundamentally empty. While delusion remains, one must repay past debts.' Once, a man bore a malignant sore on his back, the pain unbearable, pus and blood flowing unceasingly. Seeking a secluded place, he hanged himself to die. Such a person, having neither understood his own nature nor been willing to bear the debt of pus and blood from a past life, though he brought about his own death, must still repay it in his next existence. How do we know this was a past-life debt? During the reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the former dynasty, there was an imperial son-in-law who was appointed governor of Zhangde Prefecture. Cruel and tyrannical by nature, he would beat and flog his servants without cause whenever he took displeasure. One day, he developed an itch on his buttocks; when he scratched it, the skin came away, and gradually flesh and blood separated, as if he had been freshly tortured. The pain was unbearable, and he died as a result. From this, we know that debts of pus and blood must inevitably be repaid.\"*\n\n*\"Not only this, but even great or small matters of joy and anger, slander and praise, beating and scolding, right and wrong, aversion upon meeting—all are old karmic entanglements from past causes, to be repaid in this life. One must accept them gladly and without resistance. To endure with patience is to repay the debt in full. But if one disputes and contends, it is like refusing to repay a debt, and the burden only grows deeper. Karmic bonds become ever more entangled, with no end in sight. Moreover, Heaven favors repayment. Even when people harm one another out of enmity, it is nothing but the settling of karmic debts.\"*\n\n*\"Recently, I heard that when the Perfected One of Eternal Spring first dwelt in the north, a great general returned from the north. One of his attendants happened to meet a hereditary military commissioner from Shandong whose wife had been taken captive. Since his family had practiced the Dao for generations, he wished to ransom her and allow her to leave the household. He asked the Perfected One for his opinion. The Perfected One calmly refused. Before the matter could be fully discussed, the general had already departed for the north. The attendant then asked the reason for his refusal.\"*\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"This person and her master had a three-year karmic debt between them. Now that they have met, it is precisely time to repay it. Three years later, she indeed obtained her hairpin and robes to leave the household, and came to the Eternal Spring Palace to pay her respects to the Perfected One. Because her family had long practiced goodness, she received this recompense. The assembly then believed and bowed in gratitude.\"\n\nThe Master, on account of a Daoist practitioner who was ill, gave a general discourse: \"Those who cultivate the Way must regulate their diet and maintain regularity in movement and rest. When the heart and spirit are at peace, with no reckless actions, if illness should arise, it is Heaven’s decree—how could one dare not accept it? It is also the unfolding of one’s own destiny, or perhaps a karmic affliction from past causes. First, one must see through this *sì dà* (four great elements)—each is but illusion. If illness comes, let it be illness; if death comes, let it be death. With a composed mind, allow transformations to unfold. If the heart is not fixated on illness, even severe sickness becomes light, and minor ailments resolve on their own. When the true nature is at peace, turbid and foul *qi* disperses. This is also the settling of a karmic debt for illness, or the surmounting of a barrier. If one does not understand this, the heart will not be at ease. At the slightest affliction, the mind becomes frantic, wailing without cease, crying out in pain, cursing Heaven and resenting Earth. One blames others for not supporting them, resents others for not seeking physicians, rages at others for not providing comfort, and reproaches others for not inquiring after them. All the while, one gives free rein to the darkness of ignorance, revealing the depths of karmic consciousness—utterly without merit. They do not realize that life and death are already determined; even if one panics, can it be avoided? With a mind in turmoil, one cannot find peace. They do not know that the heart is the master of the body—when the master is not at ease, the whole body falls into chaos. Have they not heard the ancients say: *When the heart is scattered and the mind is disordered, it is the gate to hell*? Such misguided thoughts invite transgressions. With such an attitude, minor illnesses become severe, and severe illnesses lead to death—all because one has defiled and disturbed their true nature. If one indulges without restraint and falls ill through excess, the illness is self-inflicted, and one must bear it themselves—who else can they blame? Those who cultivate the foundation of the heart do not act in this way. Each of you should reflect on this.\"\n\nThe Master, seeing that a practitioner’s illness had reached its extremity and they could not depart, gave another general discourse: \"Those who cultivate the Way must first see through the emptiness of all phenomena, and next recognize that this bodily form is but a heap of dust. In daily affairs, one should be detached; at the time of departure, one will surely attain freedom. Formerly, in Shandong, there was an abbot who, at the end of his life, lingered and could not be liberated. He sent someone to ask the Perfected One of Eternal Spring. The Perfected One said: 'In the past, you were attached to external conditions and objects, and did not engage in cultivation. Thus, you are now entangled and cannot be liberated.' He sent a message: *'The body is not yours; the nature is fundamentally empty. With not a single thought arising, let the whole body go.'* Upon hearing these words, the abbot seemed to awaken. He instructed his fellow practitioners: 'I was deluded by external conditions, and thus my heart’s foundation remained uncultivated. At the time of departure, I could not be free. Now I urge you all to cultivate diligently, refining body and mind, to resolve the great matter of life and death.' With these words, he passed away.\n\nThere was another Daoist practitioner who, at the point of death, could not depart. He asked those around him: 'How can I go?' Some said: 'Visualize the Perfected.' He meditated for several days but still could not depart. Others said: 'Visualize emptiness.' Again, he could not depart. An old immortal heard of this and came to see him. The practitioner recounted his previous attempts, saying he still could not depart. The old immortal rebuked him: 'What did you bring when you came? What are you trying to visualize as you go? Simply await your fate—when the time comes, you will depart.' Upon hearing these words, the practitioner bowed in gratitude and passed away.\n\nGenerally, those who cultivate the Way must regard all external conditions as provisional tools for the present moment, while their own original true nature requires sincere cultivation. If one can be detached in worldly affairs, how can one not be detached at the time of departure? If one is attached and stained by external things, how can one be detached at the time of departure? Cultivate diligently—life and death are unpredictable, and the day will come when external conditions are of no avail. Each of you should reflect on this.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way must establish resolve and discipline. Yet when they have resolve and discipline, they often become rigid. Rigidity makes one inflexible in matters and affairs. When one becomes flexible in matters and affairs, they may instead fall into procrastination. Thus, among learners, those who are numerous as ox hairs are few, while those who attain the Way are as rare as qilin horns. Some establish resolve but do not know what to do; some know but cannot act; some act but do not persevere. Generally, those who study the Dao must first return to the ancestral source, then establish resolve and discipline. They must understand adaptability, focus single-mindedly, and practice diligently without cease—then there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the *true and constant Dao*?\"\nHe replied: \"Set aside the *true and constant* for now. In the twelve hours of day and night, examine your own heart. Observe what it is before thoughts arise. When thoughts arise, discern whether they are deviant or upright. If they are deviant, extinguish them; if they are upright, employ them. What is a deviant thought? Whenever, in moments of leisure, one engages in premature speculation—all of this is delusion. What is an upright thought? When there are matters at hand, such as receiving others, benefiting beings, respecting superiors, and comforting the assembly—all good intentions that are not for one’s own sake—these are upright thoughts. In stillness, the body is at peace; in activity, one acts with correctness. Neither indulgent nor constrained, neither day nor night, not a single thread obscured, constantly responsive yet constantly still, steady and stable—this is the *true and constant Dao*.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way are hindered by this stubborn heart. From beginningless time, it has revolved through the cycle of rebirth, piling up bones like mountains, dying and being born ten thousand times. Only now do they awaken to past errors and seek liberation.\"\n\nThus, one dares not eat by day nor sleep by night, refining this stubborn heart until it is utterly overturned and inverted with the mundane—only then may it be of use. Without tempering the heart, one merely sees others as sleepless.\n\nSuch forced effort scatters the mind like hairs, and at the slightest touch, the flames of passion flare. Even if one were to remain sleepless for a hundred years, what good would it serve? If the stubborn heart is not exhausted, the cycle of rebirth continues unbroken. To transform this heart, one must, without distinction of day or night, in every moment of movement and stillness, shatter this stubborn heart to pieces—only then may it be of use. The original true spirit, akin to heaven and earth, then abides in stillness. This Dao moves, this Dao speaks, this Dao falls silent—what else is there to seek? This is the Daoist who has awakened from the wine of delusion.\n\nThe Master often said: \"Those who cultivate the Way must apply effort and vigor to forge the deeply ingrained habits and biased thoughts that have long clung to their own minds. What is difficult to relinquish must be let go, even as the body reaches its limit—then, one may relinquish at will. As for what lies in the heart, all is illusion; when every trace is eradicated, there are no afflictions or obstacles. External matters and things need not occupy the mind, for they come and go like mosquitoes—brushed away, they vanish. Yet what is difficult to dispel from the heart is the very seed of rebirth.\n\nWhen the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring dwelled at Pan Brook, tigers and leopards roamed by night, coming and going at dusk. At first, he felt fear and wished to build a fence at dawn. But he reflected: *In such a realm, if fear arises and one seeks to shield oneself, can birth and death truly be avoided?* He then ceased his efforts, remaining carefree and unconcerned, accepting life and death as they came. His fear dissolved, and amid the realm of birth and death, he stood unmoved, all bonds instantly untied. This is the practice of what is most difficult to practice.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way and delve into the great matter of birth and death must apply effort themselves. Undivided by day or night, with a single-minded clarity and the six senses purified, when encountering the realms of sound and form, one sees as if not seeing, hears as if not hearing, and the inner heart remains untainted. The bustle of others is no concern of one’s own, like the wind passing before one’s eyes. If it concerns oneself, one responds only when unavoidable. Through such practice over time, the merit will naturally manifest.\"\n\nThe Master further said: \"Those who cultivate the Way should observe the good in others’ actions and emulate it, but must not fixate on their faults, lest they lose themselves. Nor should they engage in mutual fault-finding. To harbor judgments is to have an unrectified heart, and progress will be long delayed. The upright can conceal the crooked, while the crooked constantly slander the upright. Those who cling to the self and habitually slander others do not understand themselves—they belong to heterodox and deviant sects. Those with true knowledge and right vision must examine their own hearts for bias and error, searching out their own faults. To concern oneself with the faults of others is not the way of the upright.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What are *gong* (merit) and *xing* (practice)?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Silence is *gong*; speech is *xing*.\"\n\n\"What is silence as *gong*?\"\n\"To attain it in stillness, without thought or worry, sealing the mouth and forgetting words, seeking no recognition, concealing one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—this is silence as *gong*.\"\n\n\"What is speech as *xing*?\"\n\"To offer expedient means, teach others to practice, benefit living beings, and point the way to the true Dao—this is speech as *xing*.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Are seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, grasping with the hands, walking with the feet, and thinking with the mind—are these the nature?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The nature of the Dao is not these, yet it is not apart from these. Movement and stillness, speech and silence, are the functions of nature, not its essence. The essence of nature is neither movement nor stillness, neither speech nor silence. An ancient said: *To know the ancestral source of the Great Dao, one must not depart from movement and stillness, speech and silence.* If one takes movement and stillness, speech and silence as the nature, it is like mistaking the servant for the master. The master commands the servant—how could the servant be the master? All actions—raising the hand, moving the foot, speaking, seeing, hearing, and the myriad forms they take, even prolonged stillness—are but servants, not the master. The master abides in the hall and cannot be clearly revealed externally. Yet when one attains its use, one naturally assumes the role of master.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If I devote three years of diligent effort, can I escape the cycle of rebirth?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Those who cultivate the Way must establish firm resolve, advancing with vigor in every moment to refine the heart. How can one presume to predict the future or harbor the conceit of transcending rebirth? There was once a Daoist who, upon first leaving the household life, boasted: *The cycle of rebirth is a trifling matter—with a little effort, I shall be freed from it.* Though he applied himself with determination, an unexpected grave illness befell him, lingering for years and gradually eroding his resolve. How could such an outcome arise from arrogance?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"When I walk or sit alone in the mountains, I personally witness mountain spirits foretelling future events. Is this real?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The hearts of ordinary people cling to the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, obscured and unclear. When beginners leave the household life and refine their dust-laden hearts, they may, by chance, attain stillness and suddenly perceive tranquil realms, giving rise to strange visions—phantasmal apparitions they mistake for the ground of the heart, rejoicing and dancing without cease. Some may seem to foresee future events, or hear voices in the void predicting what is to come, with occasional confirmations. Others may directly encounter past masters, true immortals, or divine beings who appear before them to impart teachings on the heart. If one clings to these experiences, it is a sign of deviation. If not abandoned, they become a sickness of the heart, incurable by any method.\"\n\nHave you not heard the ancients say: \"Perception, awareness, and cognition are themselves afflictions\"? How much more so when what the eyes see, the ears hear, and the mind contemplates all belong to the realm of sound and form. Have you not heard the sutra declare: \"That which can be seen is not to be seen; that which can be heard is not to be heard. Words cannot reach it; thought cannot attain it.\" Now, if one mistakes what arises in the realm of sound and form for the truth, one has already fallen into the deviant path.\n\nOnce, a Daoist practitioner in deep meditation suddenly tasted wine in his mouth, and later dreamed of someone delivering wine. The next day, someone indeed brought wine. This was merely the spirit responding to an empty mind—nothing extraordinary. To cling to such an experience is to fall into deviation.\n\nAnother practitioner, while seated in meditation, suddenly felt his spirit wander outside, traveling several hundred paces before returning, only to find his original form still seated upright. This, too, was nothing extraordinary—no different from ordinary thoughts drifting outward, save for a slight increase in clarity. To regard this as an achievement is to fall into deviation.\n\nAs the common saying goes: \"A thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; only equanimity and tranquility accord with the Dao.\"\n\nWhen the master discussed the opening of wisdom’s treasury, he said: For those who begin the path, leaving behind the external world is like a mirror suddenly polished clear. When wisdom’s treasury opens, thoughts flow into coherent expression—but one must not cling to this. If the mind becomes fixed and functions without stimulus, it turns into wild wisdom, devoid of true merit. This is merely the activity of spirit, not the essence of the Dao. One must not boast of such abilities but should instead cultivate and nurture them.\n\nWhen the master addressed the topic of dwelling in the mountains, he said: The practitioner must see through whatever arises and respond appropriately to each situation. Each time one responds, it is like lifting a single burden. Once lifted, it is left behind.\n\nOnce, a Daoist lived in the mountains, wearing clothes of grass and eating wild plants, vowing never to descend, believing he had shed all worldly entanglements. One day, two men arrived, each carrying weapons, demanding food and drink. The master quickly cooked mountain fruits to offer them. Before the fruit had softened, one of the men reached into the pot, tasted it, and angrily declared: \"To serve such food to others—you deserve to have your pot smashed!\" The master remained silent, observing their anger and harsh words. Secretly, he devised a plan: stepping outside under some pretext, he retrieved a hidden staff, gripped it tightly, and shouted: \"Come out, both of you! You won’t get near me!\" The two men emerged, laughing: \"Living in the mountains has nurtured such arrogance in you—you’d be better off descending to become an ordinary man.\" They then departed, vanishing from sight. The master realized they were sages testing him and could only regret his failure.\n\nThis is what it means to fail a trial in the realm of circumstances.\n\nWhen the master discussed the topic of an unmoving mind, he said: Once, in Shandong, a practitioner boasted to his master that he had refined away the fire of ignorance. The master replied: \"If the fire of ignorance is extinguished, the mind does not move—then you are a worthy person.\" Later, the master secretly sent someone to test him. At dusk, the visitor arrived to find the hut’s door already closed. He loudly struck the door with his staff. The practitioner inside responded, his voice already strained, and reluctantly opened the door. The visitor appeared agitated and violent. Upon entering the hall, he did not remove his shoes but leapt onto the meditation seat, displaying no manners. The master grew furious and reached out to reprimand him. The visitor clasped his hands and smiled: \"I dared not act this way—your master sent me to test whether your mind truly remains unmoved. Before the test even began, it was already evident. No further trial is needed.\" The practitioner was deeply ashamed, unable to respond.\n\nGenerally, even those with some skill in cultivation should not boast. If one is unaware, the test will expose one’s true state. Only when the heart is ashen and the form withered does the thought of self-praise vanish. Once boasting arises, the test has already exposed the flaw. Even if one attains an unmoving state, there is still more beyond.\n\nWhen the master discussed dwelling in seclusion and guarding stillness, he said: Once, a practitioner had sat in seclusion for years. One day, others invited him out, and he moved about freely. An old friend saw him and asked: \"Brother, what you gained in stillness—can it be applied amid distraction? Have you truly attained the state of perfect immovability?\" The practitioner remained haughtily silent for a long time. The friend then said: \"I have a touchstone to distinguish truth from falsehood. Try describing what you gained in your years of stillness—let’s see what it is.\" The practitioner replied: \"What is there to say about stillness?\" The friend said: \"If that’s the case, you might as well grow fur and horns and repay your karmic debts with your mouth.\" The practitioner flew into a rage, hurling insults. The friend laughed: \"This is what you gained in seclusion—it’s been tested and revealed.\" The practitioner became resentful and severed the friendship for life.\n\nThis person had never tempered his mind amid circumstances. Even if he sat in stillness for a hundred years, it would be of no use. It is like tying a horse to keep it still—once the rope is loosened, it gallops as before.\n\nThe master often said: The practitioner is like a master carpenter cutting wood. First, one must align the heart’s inked line. Then, at the places where the wood is crooked, gradually apply the axe and adze to shape it into proper material, suitable for any use. One must not disturb the inked line. If the line is lost, there will be no standard to follow. When the crooked parts are fully trimmed away and the inked line stands true, it will naturally align with others, and all manner of vessels can be crafted.\n\nThe master also said: The practitioner should always keep the mind free of affairs, upright and proper. Every day, hour by hour, moment by moment, one must examine the true abode of one’s original spirit, clearly and without obscurity, merging with the vast emptiness. Only then is this the heart of a Daoist. Through accumulated days and accumulated effort, spiritual verification will naturally arise. Thus, rather than chasing after all manner of activities, it is better to rest and examine oneself.\n\nIf one constantly directs the mind toward external things, drifting through days by habit, this is no different from the mundane heart.\n\nThe master, addressing the assembly’s discussion on assuming the abbot’s seat, said: A practitioner who takes up residence in a monastery must measure their strength and act accordingly, passing each day with simplicity, lightness, and ease. One must not, like the worldly, contend for fame and profit, thereby losing the original heart and forgetting the great cause of life and destiny—this is the true principle. If one can temper and refine the mind in this way, willingly going where one is unwilling, facing hardship where it must be faced, and attaining a heart that is stable and unshaken, then in receiving guests from all directions, one benefits both self and others, settling the mind and accumulating practice, thus fulfilling both merit and conduct. If one does not refine the heart but mistakes external things for the self, one will be endlessly greedy and covetous, narrow in habit and disposition, following the faults of the vulgar and ruining one’s future path.\n\nThe master, exhorting the assembly to reside in the monastic community, said: Master Danyang has a lyric that goes: *To learn the Dao and dwell in the monastic community, measure shallow and deep, explore and seek; choose the good as one’s intimate friend. If one cannot yet grasp the ultimate principle, take hold of the essentials and lift them clear.* In the monastic community, all should instruct one another in turn, lifting the guiding threads and shaking the main cords, together cultivating the supreme Dharma-gate of the mind-ground—this is no small matter. Yet there are those without insight or inclination who neither seek wise companions nor dwell in the monastic community, nor discuss the mind-ground. They wander south and north, across a thousand mountains and ten thousand streams, wearing out their straw sandals in vain. They only seek places of convenience and ease, and at the slightest touch or bump, they flee at once. When they wish to settle, they seek a fine dwelling and look for favorable conditions, not knowing what is most pressing for themselves, nor how to pass the days—only pursuing ease. Little do they know that ahead lies the decisive arrival of birth and death. What will you rely on then? How can one drift through days, wasting time in vain? For what purpose did one originally leave the household life? Clear-minded gentlemen, ponder this carefully.\n\nThe master, addressing those engaged in labor who became unsettled, said: Though external conditions are provisional, a practitioner cannot fail to respond. Yet in responding, one must be without self, the mind’s substance empty and open. When matters arise, there is no obstruction, for emptiness does not hinder the myriad affairs, nor do the myriad affairs hinder emptiness. Like the space between heaven and earth, the ten thousand images and things all move of themselves, without any hindrance. If the mind harbors the mark of self, when matters arise, one must oppose them, and thus there will be friction. One cannot pass through swiftly, and when bumped or struck, the self-mind is stirred. Once the self-mind is stirred, one cannot remain steady. Though one toils all day, it is labor without achievement. Living among the great assembly and engaging in labor, one must specially guard the self-mind, not allowing it to be easily moved. Constantly examine one’s own faults, never mind those of others—this is merit and conduct. When matters come to hand, one must take them up. In the face of the ten thousand conditions and dusts, do not follow after them. Let the self-mind be clear and bright, and do not discriminate anything. Passing days in this way, the beginner’s resolve will not retreat, and merit will naturally be attained.\n\nThe master said: If a practitioner has one part of effort, one part of a superior mind arises. If one has ten parts of effort, ten parts of a superior mind arise. Once there is a superior mind, then there is the mark of self. The mark of self and the superior mind create great obstructions. How can one attain the state where the mind is empty and the realm is extinguished? One must add even greater intensity, pressing one’s own body and mind beneath the ten thousand things, always placing oneself after others. Reflect that in a thousand, in ten thousand ways, one is not as good as others, and only then can one dispel the mind that seeks to surpass others. When the mind is the same as the great emptiness, then there is no self. With no self, one accords with the Dao.\n\nThe master said: In the stillness of cultivation, the realms that appear are manifold, all transformations of one’s own discriminating spirit, arising in stillness to lure the sovereign mind. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows*? When the mind seeks to dispel the discriminating spirit, if the spirit still remains, it transforms into forms and images—spirit-heads and ghost-faces—confusing and disturbing the sovereign mind. If the sovereign remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, its substance the same as emptiness, with no place to abide, the transformations will naturally disperse. There will be no realm to become a demon, nothing that can be harmed.\n\nOnce there was a Daoist who had attained rest for the mind. One day, while sitting, he suddenly saw countless evil spirits arriving through the air. The man stabilized his mind, his substance like emptiness, darkly undiscriminating. He abandoned this body, allowing life and death to take their course. The demons dispersed of themselves. Because the sovereign was present, utterly still and unmoving, how could there be demonic illusions? It was also because the mind was not yet fully extinguished, and thus these appearances manifested. When the nature and substance are profoundly still, they naturally vanish.\n\nSomeone asked: What of the merit of those who practice seated meditation?\n\nThe master replied: Once, when True Man Changchun was in Shandong, he came to a monastery where a practitioner was in seated meditation, and the assembly was holding a vegetarian feast. Later, someone informed the True Man that the master in meditation wished to speak with him. The True Man instructed that they meet after the feast. Without waiting to be asked, the True Man went outside, found the meditation chamber, and struck its door loudly several times with his staff. The master inside, thinking it was an ordinary person, responded in anger. The True Man then left. After the feast, the assembly again requested that they meet. The True Man said: I have already tested him. This person still harbors the mind of self and others—he is not yet ready for discourse. And so he departed.\n\nGenerally, dwelling in stillness is fundamentally for the great matter of nature and life—consolidating and securing, with nurturing as the practice. When encountering circumstances without disturbance, this is the verification. Now, the sound of knocking at the door is a circumstance; the response is the mind. If the mind forgets the self, it is like cold ashes extinguished—stirred, there is clarity, yet no flame. Unmoved by circumstances, calmly passing through, this is where the mind has cultivated skill. Now, hearing a slight empty sound, the mind is already stirred—how can one pass through all adverse circumstances? Though dwelling in seclusion, what benefit is there? Receiving others’ offerings, how can one not repay the debt of the mouth? It would be better to turn toward the realm of activity, in matters and things, single-mindedly tempering this mind—this is a person with insight and interest.\n\nSomeone asked: Practitioners speak of knowing and awareness, yet also call it an illness—what is the meaning?\n\nThe master replied: True knowing is the knowing of not-knowing; true awareness is the awareness of no-awareness. The original true spirit, obscured for ten thousand kalpas, has only now awakened—this is called awareness. All knowledge and perception arise from this. If one speaks of having knowing and awareness, and insists on constant knowing and constant awareness, this is self-entanglement and self-binding, like cauterizing oneself without illness. If one is entirely without knowing or awareness, one entirely enters another shell. Having awakened to the original source, knowing and awareness are both tools—use them when needed, but do not make them constant.\n\nThe master said: When a practitioner’s dusty mind suddenly ceases and worldly concerns vanish, the original true source of the self stands revealed alone—this is the primordial master from before heaven. Once one assumes this, one is carefree and at ease, and all dharma realms are penetrated at once. If one reaches this state, one must conceal one’s light and hide one’s traces, protecting and nurturing it—more effort yields more merit. If one raises the intention to display it, one unknowingly dims the radiance.\n\nThe master said: Practitioners differ in their natures, some sharp, some dull. Those of dull nature should not cling rigidly; they ought to dwell in the monastic community, humbly cultivating the mind, and form affinities with those who understand principle and illuminate the mind. When the affinity ripens, they will naturally be guided into the Dao and gradually awaken. If one’s nature is dull and stagnant, and one lacks insight or interest, spending each day with those of the same kind, associating with worldly dust, the dusty circumstances will ripen, and one will surely retreat from the Dao. Perhaps encountering demonic states, seeing hellish visions, with no one to save them, one sinks and falls—deeply lamentable.\n\nThe master said: Once there was a recluse who heard people speak of the \"ground.\" Upon entering seclusion, he wished to see the ground. This thought persisted, and as the thought arose, it manifested—yet he did not know it was false. What the ears hear belongs to sound; what the eyes see belongs to form; what the mind imagines belongs to delusion. Thus, he saw golden youths and jade maidens, true immortals and sages appearing in form, seen clearly in broad daylight—yet these were all illusory realms, fabricated by deluded thoughts. Taking them as the ground, unable to break through, he muddled through his life, attaching to the demonic and the possessed. He did not know that the \"ground\" is where the ancients’ minds and actions reached a stable and restful state—hence the name. Like a person’s dwelling place, clearing away brambles, sweeping aside rubble, the ground is leveled, suitable for residence—this is called the \"ground.\" For practitioners, when the mind-ground is stable and nothing disturbs it alone, this is the \"unmoving ground\"; when the myriad dusts cannot stain it, this is the \"pure ground\"; when one’s original dharma-body is revealed, fully and clearly assumed—this is the \"luminous ground.\" Generally, the \"ground\" has boundaries and locations. If one reaches the state of no ground, no direction, beyond names and words—this is what is called \"mysterious and again mysterious.\" How could one claim to have attained it merely through what the eyes see, the ears hear, or the mind imagines?\n\nThe master said: Non-action is the Dao of heaven; action is the Dao of humans. Non-action aligns with heaven; action aligns with humans. Like a person carrying a load, if both ends are balanced, it is steady; if one end is dropped, it becomes lopsided. If both ends are released, even the carrying pole is gone—one returns to the original state.\n\nThe master said: Once, at the Eastern Hall, it rained, and the manager called for general labor, regardless of age, to move the bricks. Everyone rushed to respond, except for one old immortal who sat calmly without going out. When the task was done, the assembly gathered, and someone spoke to True Man Changchun about it. The True Man rebuked them, saying: How much are a few broken bricks worth? One person tempering the mind has truly reached the place of rest—like a priceless pearl, it depends on each person’s mind-ground and how they act. Generally, in the teaching gate, valuing the attainment of people is paramount.\n\nThe master said: Once, beneath True Man Changchun’s hall, there was a kitchen attendant. Everyone praised his gentleness and humility, never having seen him disturbed. The True Man, knowing this, secretly sent someone to test him. In the morning, they moved the kitchen utensils to another place. When the attendant prepared congee, soaking the rice and filling the pot, he searched in vain for the ladle and spoon, until the pot overflowed—then his mind was greatly disturbed. Seeing this, the True Man taught him: Even if it all overflowed, it is merely an external thing—why let it harm the mind? The attendant then realized, bowed in gratitude, and that was all.\n\nA physician asked: I practice medicine and have revived over a hundred people from death—what is the result?\n\nThe master replied: Even if you saved all the people in the world, it would not compare to saving yourself from life and death. Worldly blessings have limits, but if you cultivate yourself to the state beyond life and death, this blessing is boundless.\n\nA craftsman asked: I built a great hall without charging for labor—with such sincerity, what is the corresponding fruit?\n\nThe master replied: It is not as good as a person of purity sitting in silence for an hour. For the blessings of action decay, but the blessings of non-action do not decay.\n\nThe Master often addressed the assembly, saying: \"In this human life, all that one does and accomplishes will inevitably meet with retribution. Thus, those who embody the Dao attain the Dao; those who perform blessings receive blessings; those who commit transgressions incur transgressions. Those who love others are loved in return; those who despise others are despised. Those who respect others are respected; those who slight others are slighted. The humble are uplifted by others; the trustworthy are trusted. Those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed. The self-exalting are humbled by others; those who seek precedence are contested. The self-assertive meet with resistance. As it is said: plant orchids and you reap fragrance; sow millet and you harvest grain—such is the principle of retribution. If one harbors a mind of profit, acting with deceit to win others’ hearts, one loses the true Way.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"For those who cultivate the Way, the greatest taboo is to speak of others’ strengths and weaknesses, or to discuss matters of rise and fall—all worldly affairs that do not concern oneself. Such things must not be spoken of with the mouth nor pondered in the heart. To engage in gossip is to obscure one’s own clarity. If one focuses solely on refining the mind and constantly examining one’s own faults, how can there be time to meddle in others’ affairs? In all dealings with others, one should emulate their virtues and avoid their vices, never concerning oneself with them, gradually attaining stillness.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The assembly speaks of cultivators: to cease dwelling in the village is to attain the Dao; to cease consuming wine and meat is to ascend in flight; to cease attachment to family is to become an immortal. Cease craving the love of others, cease resenting their faults. Let nothing be taken as oneself—recognize nothing as truly belonging to you. Even in sleep, do not seek the Dao. Do not associate with unworthy companions; do not speak useless words. When things go well, do not rejoice; when they go ill, do not grieve. Learn from those superior to yourself; teach those who are not. When others wrong you, it is your fortune; when you wrong others, it is your misfortune. Words that exceed deeds are empty; deeds that surpass words are solid. Those with desires belong to the human realm; those with a mind free of dust belong to the immortal path. The willing humble are exalted; the willing poor are enriched. Returning to the constant accords with the Dao; following principle accords with others. The true Way should be practiced; the deviant path must not be entered. Penetrate the Dao, illuminate virtue, and embody the perfect integration of essence and function. This is called the Perfected Whole.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The ancients who sought the Dao, if their minds were not yet enlightened, would travel a thousand miles to seek a teacher and inquire deeply. If their connection was as precise as a needle meeting a magnet, their minds became clear, and all doubts vanished. Then, whether dwelling in a walled garden, retiring to forests and springs, begging in the marketplace, or establishing a temple, they settled their minds and guarded the Dao, never wavering—such were the superior cultivators of truth. There are those who leave the household life yet remain ignorant in nature, too lazy to seek instruction, arrogant and competitive, clinging to their own views, feigning the appearance of a high adept. They neglect their practice and lose their conduct, failing in both worlds. They accept offerings from others without considering whether their own virtue is sufficient to repay them. Such people are unfit to dwell in gardens or beg for alms. When the hour of life and death arrives, they are of no use, for they have refused to cultivate at the root. Even after a hundred years, they achieve nothing.\"\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner of cultivation gathers and settles the mind as one would a carved wooden sacred image seated in the hall. Whether no one is present all day or servants and maids crowd around, whether offered incense and flowers or met with slander and defamation—it remains thus. Yet unlike the wooden image, it is spiritually awakened and sagely responsive, alive and luminous, illuminating the Dao and virtue. In all matters and things, however, it does not cling.\n\nThe Master said: The Daoist refines the heart as one casts gold to make a rooster. Though its form and color resemble a rooster’s, its heart remains unmoved, standing alone among the flock. Though roosters are combative, none dare approach. The one who embodies the Dao has a heart like cold ashes and a form like withered wood. Though the world may be full of those who love contention, none can contend with them. Thus the scripture says: \"Only because they do not contend does the world find none to contend with them.\"\n\nThe Master said: This has substance and function, transcends self and other, and is the upright and true heart, received since before the primordial chaos when there was neither heaven nor earth. It cannot be called existent, nor can it be called nonexistent. All sages and worthies of past and present, all Daoist adepts under heaven, have attained this and then put it to use. The thousands of scriptures and ten thousand treatises, even the entire canon, speak only of this. Heaven operates by this, earth operates by this, and even the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, the boundless expanse of emptiness, are governed by this subtle workings. Those who comprehend it are not led astray by any circumstance, not manipulated by any thought or worry, not deceived by the six senses. This is the daily practice of immortals, the conduct of sages and worthies, and the path of the adept.\n\nThe Master said: When dwelling in a monastic community, people gather from all directions—how could they all be of one kind, identical in nature? It is like a great mountain, where grasses and trees are fully arrayed: some are useless timber, some become fine wood, some stand alone, some cling to others. There are auspicious sprouts and rare herbs, and there are wild thickets and brambles. All differ according to their nature, following their own course, each in its proper place. The mountain’s body stands majestically, making no distinctions, yet embracing all. Flowing water and piled stones, lush forests and abundant grasses, beasts that run and birds that sing—all manifest wondrous function and spiritual efficacy. They mutually sustain one another, like hemp supporting the mallow, which stands straight without support. Over time, each attains its fulfillment. If one sought to cut the long to patch the short, or change blue to yellow, not only would none find peace, but their original nature would be lost.\n\nThe Master said: In former days, when I resided as abbot in Shandong, I shut my door all day and avoided worldly affairs for over ten years, taking stillness as my heart’s disposition. Yet I accomplished nothing in practice or conduct. Sitting alone where no one came, untouched by others, unmet by circumstances or things—how could this heart reveal its growth or decay? It was merely passing time in emptiness. If heaven does not benefit things, the four seasons do not turn; if earth does not benefit things, the ten thousand things do not grow. If one cannot benefit oneself and others, what merit is there? Thus the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring said: \"To act is to pacify people and benefit things, aligning with the Dao of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe Master said: If the practitioner’s mysterious pass remains unopened and the mind-ground is unclear, if they are constantly driven by karmic consciousness and cannot abide in non-action, it is because they lack good fortune and virtue. They should then apply effort within the teachings according to their capacity, establishing merit and deeds, welcoming and attending to newcomers, humbling the mind, revering teachers and companions, constantly practicing kindness, and casting aside selfishness and deceit. Over time, as conditions ripen and progress is made day by day, there will naturally be breakthroughs. Do not merely carry the burden of emptiness at both ends, unable to engage in non-action or action, drifting through days without merit or conduct. Rest where it is stable, taste where it is sweet, idly meddle in worldly affairs, intrude where unwelcome, indulge body and mind, and show no fear of the divine—yet the day of reckoning will come. Have you not heard the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring say: \"To cultivate the mind-ground, wholly abandon worldly affairs; to apply effort in the teachings, fully engage in worldly toil\"? If you lack the work of the mind-ground and do not apply effort in the teachings, drifting through days—consider for yourself, what kind of person are you?\n\nThe Master said: Conditions and causes have their number, not subject to human effort. One must follow nature, peacefully awaiting destiny. Inner cultivation and outer conduct depend entirely on the self. If one can apply effort, one will have merit. Whether one practices or not, each attains accordingly. If the teachings are not open, one should withdraw and conceal oneself, harmonizing the heart with heaven. When the teachings are open, outer conduct should also respond, aligning with heaven and meeting others. Merit is not嫌多, conduct is not嫌广. Only with a steadfast heart can one attain accomplishment.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao is present everywhere, in every situation, and all forms are real. It depends only on how one applies it in the moment—what else could there be? Yet people’s hearts are heavily obscured by worldly dust and karmic ties. They do not understand the root, plucking leaves and seeking branches, chasing waves, and few turn back. Even if they delve deeply, they do not seek truth, twisting and fabricating, seeing spirits and ghosts, piling heads upon heads, turning back and forth in confusion. They do not realize that this illusory body is limited, that time is fleeting, and that with one breath gone, what then?\n\nThe Master said: In daily life, let the heart be free of杂念, the mind not wander outward. Release without dissipation, restrain without constraint. Illuminate the mind and recognize the dharma, transcend wisdom and leave emptiness. In the twelve hours of the day, let each thought be present. If one clings to the present, it is not in accord with principle; if one departs from the present, there is no such place. Comprehend movement and stillness, know going and coming, let go of everything, be without entanglement or obstruction—this is the person of carefree ease. Yet all words fall short; one must discern for oneself.\n\nThe Master said: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without fail. How could they distinguish this as good or that as evil? Their covering and bearing are the same, their illumination and oversight are the same. Thus, those who stand above are placed there by the Mandate of Heaven. They ought to emulate Heaven’s all-covering embrace, nurturing and cherishing all those below, making no distinction between my nobility and your humility. Those who stand below are likewise ordained by the Mandate of Heaven to be there. They ought to emulate Earth’s bearing of Heaven, revering and obeying those above, never daring the slightest negligence.\n\nExisting between Heaven and Earth, one must align with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, acting beyond one’s proper place invites misfortune, calamity, punishment, and retribution.\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner of cultivation, in their fundamental nature, suffers no deficiency. In conduct and deeds, they apply intention; in the face of external phenomena, they pass swiftly by; in human affairs, they remain unattached. Private and wayward thoughts do not arise; not even the finest speck is established, nor the tiniest dust clings. Bright, clear, and empty—neither clinging to emptiness nor to existence, neither grasping at dharma-appearances nor at the view of self. Merging with the light of all beings, over time they mutually sustain one another, fusing inner and outer, and thus attain the station of the sage. What further doubt could there be?\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner of cultivation acts or withdraws according to their lot, takes or leaves as circumstances allow, humbles the heart, and takes impartiality as their rule. They examine the source of movement and stillness, regulate the use of seeing and hearing. Cutting off all entanglements, they focus the mind on the true and constant. Through endless kalpas, they remain unchanging and indestructible.\n\nThe Master said: In daily life, the Daoist embodies Heaven and models Earth, ever pure and ever still, luminous yet not obscured, aiding beings and benefiting life. Though immersed in the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, the true source remains serene and undisturbed, without interruption. They naturally attain liberation from the bonds of birth and death—this is the great matter of karmic causation. Yet how many, failing to awaken, lack inner mastery? Desires assail them from within, the senses and their objects lure them from without, and they cannot attain freedom. From this, the four kinds of birth revolve, the six paths of existence turn, and the skin of the head is changed—how different from today!\n\nThe Master said: Those who pursue the Dao embrace simplicity and hold fast to purity, subtly penetrating and silently enacting. They eliminate emotions and abandon desires, diminishing and preserving, acting without self-interest, conducting affairs with clarity. They yield to others and cultivate benevolence, accumulating virtue. The slightest fault they must remove; the most minute merit they must accumulate. Right and wrong both dissolved, mind and dharma both forgotten, the mechanism of the highest truth naturally becomes clear.\n\nThe Master said: Those who cultivate the Dao, having originally left the household life, do so because the great matter of life and destiny presses upon them. Yet with the passage of years, unawares, they are swayed by external things, learning instead the tricks of the tongue, a hundred kinds of skill—all mere servile labor. How can one know this? Simply observe: whenever one relies on such arts, one inevitably desires to display them before others. This is to be enslaved by others—how could it be the work of one who is pure, still, and free? Thus it is said: The wise are not used by the wise, but by the foolish. The skillful are not employed by the skillful, but by the clumsy. For example, the eloquent speak, while the silent listen. Examine this closely—who is busy, and who is at ease? If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, the mind-ground must be clear, yet one guards simplicity and clumsiness. Then all the wisdom and skill under Heaven will be at one’s service.\n\nThe Master said: The essential subtleties transmitted by the true teachers of the highest truth align with the hidden will of Heaven in all actions. How could clinging to one aspect alone constitute the Dao? Observing their traces, the methods of the ancients differed in each case, yet the wondrous root-source was never distinct. It is like the functioning of the human mind: in the eye, it sees; in the ear, it hears; in the mouth, it speaks; in the mind, it thinks; in the hand, it grasps; in the foot, it walks. Though its functions vary, the essence of the mind remains unchanged. Moreover, the secret teachings of the true masters—what is called \"transmission beyond the teachings\"—lie beyond the reach of words and thoughts. Those who awaken attain it for themselves; this is the wondrous secret of the true teacher’s transmission.\n\nThe Master said: My Dao is secretly transmitted. It cannot be sought with intention, nor attained without intention. It is known through not-knowing, attained through not-attaining. The deluded of the world seek the Dao through attire and appearance, through speech and discourse, through solemn demeanor, through dharma-appearances—none grasp its wholeness. Little do they realize that the Dao leaves no traces. To seek it through traces is not the Dao. Instead, investigate the origin of these traces. Knowing whence they arise, one finds that what abides within is neither sound nor form, neither contrivance nor solemnity, neither dharma-appearance nor self-view. It is beyond all knowing and knowledge. Simply this: the original completeness, utterly real, in accord with Heaven and Earth, with sages and worthies, with spirits and the myriad things. Such is the great matter of karmic causation—how could the dust and defilement of the voice-hearers’ traces ever perceive it? The Perfected One of Danyang said: \"True joy, true leisure—beyond all discussion. Utterly subtle, utterly wondrous—beyond all reckoning. Where reckoning ends, nearness begins.\"\n\nThe Master said: Even those who have long dwelt in the monastic community, receiving instruction and discipline day and night, may yet grow negligent, procrastinate, and fail to advance. The mind of the Dao gradually wanes, worldly affairs increase daily, and they become reckless and unruly, unable to attain emptiness and stillness. How much more so for those who, living in the world, act alone and independently? The dust of worldly passions lingers, love and attachment entangle, and obstacles to the Dao arise at every turn—yet they remain unaware. Though they encounter sages and worthies, they cannot be transformed. They fabricate a hundred deceptions, deluding the common folk, gradually sinking into ruin. Their blessings diminish, their karma grows, and their burden deepens. If they would but turn back, they could still be saved. But if they cling to the dust and turn from the Dao, there is nothing to be done—hell is not far off.\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao do not tire of inquiry and questioning. It is like one traveling a road: by asking diligently, one does not go astray.\n\nThose who seek minor skills cannot master them without a teacher—how much more so for this great Dao, which cannot be seen or heard? Without encountering a guide at the outset, by what means can one attain it? Of all suffering, none is greater than birth and death; without drawing near to a perfected one, how can one escape it? Thus it is said: \"The ancients did not study the Dao lightly—they served true masters until old age.\" If one does not know where to begin, nor draws near to those who have attained, even with resolve and discipline, one will err a thousand times over.\n\nThe Master said: From the beginning, those who study the Dao must only endure hardship for themselves while benefiting others, silently accumulating merit and conduct. If one indulges the mind in improper actions, not only does one disgrace the teaching, but one also invites calamity upon oneself. To live and speak without purity or restraint is no different from the common world. To enjoy the sweat and blood of the ten directions in this way is no small matter—what is taken in ease will be repaid in suffering. When birth and death arrive at last, there will be no escape.\n\nIf one dwells within the gate, why not refine the heart?\n\nSomeone asked: What is the meaning of a Dao student remaining sleepless through the night?\nThe answer: The student who does not sleep does so to refine the heart. If the mind is not gathered, what use is it? Consider those who gamble, play chess, weave, spin, or grind—if they stay awake all night, are they all enlightened? Such people are driven by profit at every hour, their minds restless as mosquitoes biting the skin, and so they cannot sleep. The practitioner is not like this. Sleep is but one desire; if it is not transformed, it breeds delusion, darkening the mind and belonging to the yin realm. It is like one guarding against thieves, sitting upright in vigil—the thieves will retreat of their own accord. To focus solely on refining the heart is to fear dissipation. This heart has no fixed form: in yang it is bright, in yin it is dark. When familiar states do not arise, and non-action brings clarity, the luminous pearl of nature shines forth—this is why one remains sleepless day and night.\n\nSomeone asked: Why do Dao students willingly endure poverty and hardship?\nThe answer: If one merely takes poverty, hunger, and cold as virtue, then the destitute and struggling in the streets would all be immortals. The practitioner takes the Dao and virtue as the heart, purity as the mind, cutting away deceit, greed, and reckless action, casting them all aside. Forgetting form and self, one does not fix the mind on external things. Thus it is said: \"A robe of cloth covers the skin and flesh—what need to choose fine or coarse? Food fills the belly—what need to select refined or rough?\" Only liberation from birth and death and the refinement of the heart matter, so one does not dwell on the suffering of the body.\n\nSomeone asked: Are there future rewards and punishments, or not?\nThe answer: Let us not speak of the future—consider the present. When you kindle a good thought, wishing to burn incense and bow before a sacred teacher, taking the incense in hand and vowing, \"May my family be safe, may blessings and longevity increase,\" this is not a mind that performs good, yet you expect reward. Even if reward comes, you will not know it. Those who cultivate good do so openly but receive hidden recompense, so they are never aware of it. But if you harbor an evil thought, raising a knife to kill, the moment the thought arises, you must repay with your life. This cannot be done in the clear and impartial light—it is in the obscure and unfathomable that one creates it, and before long, it will be exposed, and you will repay with your life. This is not seeking punishment and receiving it—this punishment is known. Those who do evil act in secret but are repaid openly. This is a matter of present human action, and it is inevitably clear. Moreover, heaven observes what people do not—where can one flee? One cannot but be cautious.\n\nSomeone asked: There have long been teachings of heaven and hell—are they real?\nThe answer: Heaven is the yang realm, governing good and blessing. Hell is the yin realm, governing evil and misfortune. The ancients established these teachings, but heaven and hell arise from the human heart. The heart’s actions respond in darkness. To be constantly pure and still, benefiting all, practicing all virtues with clarity and without obscurity—this belongs to the yang realm. All manner of evil, deceit, and injustice, straying into perverse paths—this belongs to ignorance and darkness, growing in cycles, accumulating filth and defilement, all recorded in the black ledger. Neither gods nor humans tolerate it; the lord of the heart is tormented, suffering assails from all sides, and no one comes to the rescue—this is hell. The ancients said: \"A clear heart and tranquil mind are the path to heaven; a distracted heart and chaotic mind are the gate to hell.\" It is like a mountain path where rumors speak of bandits ambushing travelers and harming them. If one believes and turns back, one will avoid harm. If one does not believe and stumbles forward drunk, one may pass unharmed—or if bandits are truly there, one will fall into their trap, and regret will come too late. The teaching of hell is of this nature. In short, doing evil is not like doing good. Good brings no blame—what fault is there? But forcing one’s way in evil paths will bring misfortune. If one does not repent even when the consequences are clear before one’s eyes, how much less can one know the hidden and obscure?\n\nSomeone asked: It is said that the supreme matter is inherent in everyone—why refine it further?\nThe answer: An unrefined mind is like gold in ore—before smelting, it is but a stubborn stone. Placed in a great furnace, the dross is burned away, and the true substance is separated. Once refined into gold, it is no longer ore. The practitioner is the same. The mind, long obscured by delusion and attachment, is like crude ore. With resolve as the great bellows and wisdom as the craftsman, one refines it diligently, leaving not a trace, smelting forth the originally unimpeded true heart.\n\nOnce true, it is no longer false—guard it well, secure and preserve it, and it will serve you of its own accord. This is the everlasting, perfectly luminous, boundless treasure-jewel of old.\n\nSomeone asked: When one reaches the state of purity and non-action, has one penetrated to the end?\nThe answer: Spoken in terms of essence, this seems so but is not. As for the true and exact point, it cannot be spoken, cannot be thought, cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing. Only when names and words are utterly transcended does one begin to correspond with it. It is neither identical with movement and stillness nor separate from them—how could it be defined as non-action and purity?\n\nSomeone asked: I once heard that Master Danyang attained the Dao swiftly through awakening to death—what is the meaning of this?\nThe answer: The practitioner should regard this body as a condemned prisoner being dragged to the execution ground, each step bringing one closer to death. With death as one’s constant thought, one severs and abandons everything. Though sounds and sights, the splendor of the world’s objects, surround one on every side, the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing. Thought after thought is extinguished, and even this body is relinquished—how much more all else. Refining the mind in this way, one sees swift progress, attaining life within death, neither born nor dying. Those newly embarking on the Dao, seeking to escape birth and death, should hold this thought. Human life lasts but an instant; if a single breath fails to come, one is already in the realm of death. Be urgent in applying the mind, diligent in cultivation and advancement. Dispel the ordinary mind entirely, benefit yourself and others, and rescue one another in turn—do not procrastinate.\n\nSomeone asked: If the mind is free from defilement and attachment, and one lives freely and follows conditions, does this accord with the Dao?\nThe answer: To intend freedom from attachment is already to be attached; to intend freedom from defilement is still to be attached to non-defilement. The moment one seeks stillness and concentration, one has already fallen into the root of thought. To indulge freely in dependence on others is also to form heterodox views. Freedom from defilement and attachment are but medicines—when there is no illness, the medicine is removed. If the illness departs but the medicine remains, it ultimately becomes a medicinal illness. Only when the paths of speech and thought are cut off does one truly arrive home. Cease asking about the journey.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao cannot be spoken of—only good and evil can be pointed out. Goodness establishes the unsurpassed cause of transcending the world, where there is heaven but no hell. Evil leads to falling into boundless suffering, where there is hell but no heaven. These two paths arise from delusion and awakening. Awakening brings instantaneous sagehood; delusion brings eternal sinking. Having attained a human body, how can one not reflect on this?\n\nThe Master said: The paths of the ordinary and the sage are the same—only clarity and obscurity set them apart. Clarity makes one a sage; obscurity makes one ordinary. The mind of the ordinary person is unwilling to sever emotions and relinquish attachments, to abandon falsity and remove evil. Drifting with circumstances, turning with passions, one seeks momentary pleasure and accumulates eons of calamity, never reflecting, never awakening.\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner must first understand one’s own fundamental task, then master teaching and transformation. If one does not comprehend one’s own tradition, one is like a person without eyes—unable to distinguish the path, every step is mistaken. If one does not understand teaching and transformation, one is like a sighted person sitting in darkness—prone to partiality and self-view. One must master both to respond perfectly. If one masters neither, one is like a person sitting in great darkness who also has no eyes—when will one ever emerge?\n\nSomeone asked: Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir—what is it truly?\nThe answer: It is one’s original true nature. Because it is swift, sharp, bright, and clear, transforming and melting, it is called \"gold.\" Having undergone refinement, perfectly complete and indestructible for ten thousand kalpas, it is named \"elixir.\" Its substance is like empty space, inwardly and outwardly radiant and transparent, not a single thread clinging, not a speck of dust defiling. Glittering and shining, it illumines all without limit. Thus the ancestral master said:\n*The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir,\nThe four temporal states are the furnace that refines it into a mass.\nFree from defilement, without thought, cast out delusion,\nNaturally, in a single manifestation, it ascends the immortal’s altar.*\n\nPeople of the world who speak of the Golden Elixir, making it in tangible forms and relating it to passions and desires, hold views of hell—these are the deeds of the licentious and perverse. Their understanding deviates from the human path, and they enter the realm of beasts.\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao should thoroughly investigate and realize the point where one is uninvolved in all affairs, undefiled by any dust, and in communion with heaven and earth. Then one precedes heaven and heaven does not oppose, follows heaven and accords with its timing. If even heaven does not oppose, how much less do people, how much less ghosts and spirits.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the mysterious and wondrous?\nThe answer: Who taught you to ask this?\nThe person joined their hands and said: This disciple conceived the question myself.\nThe answer: If so, then you already understand.\nThe person laughed and bowed.\n\nSomeone asked: What is past is not pursued, what is to come is not anticipated—what of the present?\nThe answer: Extinguish movement but not illumination—further, one must realize who it is that extinguishes movement. Once attained, the power is in your hands: to extinguish or not to extinguish is up to you.\n\nSomeone asked: I do not ask about the mind of the past or future—what is the mind of the present?\nThe Master looked straight ahead and said: This is not the present.\nThen lowered his head and said: This is not the present.\nHe then asked in return: Do you understand?\nThe person laughed and said: I do not.\nThe Master said: With eyes wide open, you do not even understand the present—what more is there to say of past and future?\n\nSomeone asked: What are fortune and misfortune?\nThe answer: Piled wood becomes a forest, piled stones become a mountain, piled water becomes a sea. Piled goodness becomes fortune, piled evil becomes misfortune. The source of fortune and misfortune lies in the mind itself. Only through accumulation do they form—how can one not be cautious?\n\nSomeone asked: What are good and evil?\nThe answer: Every kind thought is good; every unbalanced thought is evil. Goodness unknown to others is great goodness; evil unknown to others is great evil.\n\nTo neither think of good nor evil—beyond this lies the higher matter.\n\nSomeone asked: Both Daoists and ordinary people fall ill—how are they different?\nThe answer: Long ago, Master Danyang fell ill, yet physicians could not read his pulse. Master Huqiu sat in stillness, yet diviners could not discern his true nature. Why? When the mind is not attached to things, creation cannot alter it; when nature does not stray from its source, even spirits cannot fathom it. How much less can physicians or fortune-tellers? This is the difference from ordinary people.\n\nThe Master said: If a cultivator’s true eye remains unopened and their perfect mechanism unactivated, merely seeking in others’ footprints or measuring by words and phrases, they will never find the Way. It is like a blind man hearing others speak of the sun and moon’s light—though he imagines it, he never sees it for himself. This is because he has not worked on his own mind.\n\nSomeone asked: In the midst of movement and stillness, how can one be thus?\nThe answer: When the mind is pure and still, even amid bustling crowds and clamor, if matters do not concern you, let the world stir as it will—it is no different from an empty chamber where nothing exists. Yet if you sit alone in a quiet room, as if standing at a crossroads before sages and truths, you dare not entertain the slightest false thought. Thus, neither movement nor stillness hinders you. What further confusion could there be?\n\nSomeone asked: If one harmonizes with the world yet does not cling to things, how is this so?\nThe answer: Heaven is heaven, earth is earth, mountains are mountains, waters are waters, things are things, and I am I. Though mingling with the world, how can they truly cling?\n\nSomeone asked: All forms and shapes differ—how can they be seen as one?\nThe answer: Heaven is the Dao, earth is the Dao, and all things are the Dao. That is the Dao, and this is the Dao. Though forms vary, the Dao is everywhere—how can they not be one?\n\nSomeone asked: People seek joy, yet Daoists embrace hardship—why?\nThe answer: Worldly people know not true joy; they mistake what pleases the heart for joy, led by desire into suffering, taking bitterness for delight. Daily scheming for worldly pleasures, when they fail, sorrow and turmoil afflict the spirit, never at ease—this is true suffering. Those who cultivate the Dao seek no joy; their minds abide in the Dao. Encountering hardship, they do not suffer; without suffering, they are ever joyful, their minds free. Where there is joy, there is suffering; without joy, there is no suffering. A mind beyond joy and suffering—this is true joy.\n\nSomeone asked: How can one escape the cycle of sin and fortune, cause and effect?\nThe answer: Sin and fortune, cause and effect, belong to the shell of yin and yang. If you break free from this shell, they naturally cease to bind you. What is the shell of yin and yang? The moment a trace of selfish desire or malevolence arises in the mind, it belongs to the yin shell; the moment a trace of good intention arises, it belongs to the yang shell. In yin, there is evil retribution; in yang, there is good retribution. But if you refine the mind until it is like empty space—neither good nor evil, with no attachment to govern—then fortune and misfortune cannot touch you, cause and effect cannot grasp you. This is one who has transcended the shell of yin and yang. The layperson, never harboring a single good thought, spends all twelve hours scheming for wealth and gain, living at others’ expense, deceiving and entrapping them, their mind shrouded in ignorance and darkness—how can they escape the shell of yin and yang? They cannot even tread the yang path—how could they break free? To seek freedom from sin and fortune, from cause and effect, is nearly impossible. You have forged your own fate—how can you evade it? Bow your head, close your eyes, and leave it to King Yama to judge.\n\nSomeone asked: What of future rebirth—how does it truly work?\nThe answer: In this life, each person shapes the mold for their next existence. Those who do good forge a good mold; those who do evil forge an evil one. When this body’s allotted time ends and the nature departs its shell, like molten iron poured into a crucible, the Creator casts it into the self-made mold—whether as a human or another being, you reap what you have sown. Does the Creator intend for you to become an animal? Does it intend for you to enter the six realms? No—it is the shell you have crafted in life, from which you cannot escape. This nature gives rise to that form. The cruel become serpents, the miserly become dogs, the lustful and murderous become swine, the greedy and violent become wolves—all such transformations follow this pattern. Between heaven and earth, myriad forms and shapes are endless, all self-created and self-endured. Thus the ancients said: *Become like metal or stone, and you transform into metal or stone; become like water or fire, and you transform into water or fire.* These are trustworthy words. A moment’s lapse in losing the human form may take ten thousand kalpas to recover—why not reflect on this?\n\nSomeone asked: I am now old and cannot study much—pray, speak a word on the supreme, most profound, and wondrous truth.\nThe answer: Let go of your seeking for the supreme, most profound, and wondrous—then you will have it.\n\nSomeone asked: The world’s teachings diverge, each claiming truth and denouncing others. Who is right, and who is heretical?\nThe answer: There are two paths: those who cultivate and those who engage the world. To cultivate the mind until it is as clear as heaven and earth, as bright as the sun and moon, as ceaselessly transforming as the four seasons—able to respond to affairs yet returning to the root—is to ask no further of the higher truth. This is the functioning of the true Dao, achievable only by those who cultivate.\n\nIf one merely recites with the mouth—adorning the Dharma-body like decorations, crafting appearances one by one to be admired, delighting all who see them—this is but the world-engaging branch and flower of the teaching, what has it to do with cultivation, what has it to do with the true Dao? Such is but a provisional expedient; moreover, the heart still contends over self and others, over wealth and gain, no different from the common folk—how then can one claim to be of the true teaching? Let those with clear eyes discern this.\n\n*Record of Master Wang, Cloud-Dweller of Mount Pan, concludes.*",

Yet is this only so for the physical form? The mind and intellect are likewise afflicted. Though the original, Heaven-endowed true nature is complete in all people, it is obscured by accumulated dust, leaving the correct vision unclear.

      "translated_text": "The Recluse of Solitary Peak, having also been counted among the least of the disciples, rejoiced upon seeing this work. He purified himself with fasting and ablutions, then respectfully composed a preface for it.\n\nWritten on the first day of the first lunar month in the year *dingwei*, by disciple Lun Zhihuan.\n\n*Recorded Sayings of Perfected Wang of Dwelling-in-Clouds on Mount Pan*\nCompiled by disciple Lun Zhihuan\n\nAt that time, the master was on Mount Pan and expounded widely, saying:\nFor beginners on the path of the Dao, if you immediately try to comprehend where words fail, you will find no grounding, no support, and doubt will surely arise. If the mind lacks cultivation, faith will be insufficient; without sufficient faith, practice cannot proceed. Without proper practice, one strays into disorderly learning, and over time, grows lax and retreats.\n\nNow, let me speak to you of what lies before your eyes and within your ears—where faith is sufficient, proceed in practice. Starting from the coarse and entering the subtle will not lead you astray. Even in sounds and forms, the functioning of the Dao is present.\n\nWhat is meant by \"where faith is sufficient\"?\nDo you not see the vast emptiness, the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, mountains and rivers, wind and clouds? These are all clearly before your eyes—this is the model for cultivation, the gateway to entering the Dao.\n\nConsider how clouds emerge from mountains: they come and go without intent, drifting freely and at ease, untethered by circumstances or objects. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr observe how wind stirs and animates the ten thousand things: it rushes forth and returns, utterly without obstruction, leaving no trace. Grass and trees, thickets and forests cannot hinder it—it passes through with effortless clarity. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr consider the great mountains: towering and majestic, steadfast and unshaken, unmoved by anything that touches them. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr water, which by nature is yielding and flows downward, nourishing grasses and plants, never contending with things. It adapts to square or round, its essence clear and still. When it gathers into rivers and seas, it embraces the hundred streams without distinction, encompassing fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs alike. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the sun and moon, which illuminate all within their radiance, impartial and without favor, shining in all directions day and night, boundless and luminous. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the heavens above, whose essence is ever pure, pure yet all-embracing, covering all without exception. Toward the ten thousand beings, they bring benefit without harm. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the tranquility of the great earth: still and unmoving, bearing the weight of the ten thousand things, without partiality or bias. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nOr the vastness of empty space, boundless and without limit, containing all, embracing all—whether sentient or insentient, covering heaven and supporting earth. It neither distinguishes nor rejects, neither moves nor rests, neither exists nor does not exist, neither clings to nor departs from the ten thousand things. It holds the clarity of heaven, the stillness of earth, the brightness of the sun and moon, and the transformations of the ten thousand things—yet empty space remains undivided. The mind of one who walks the Dao should be like this.\n\nThe Dao is one with heaven and earth, and its functioning is thus. Its essence resides within; when cultivation matures, comprehension arises naturally. In movement and action, one harmonizes with the Dao, and there is always a master within. If you seek beyond where words and thoughts cease, you will lose it.\n\nHaving entered the gate of the mysterious, each of you should strive diligently.\n\nSomeone asked: How does a beginner in cultivation enter the gate of refining the mind-ground?\nThe master replied: Sever in one stroke the mind that clings to love and attachment, schemes and calculations, premeditations and regrets, the mind that entraps and ensnares others. Abandon entirely the attachments to wine, sensuality, wealth, and temper; to right and wrong, self and others; to clinging, affection, and desire; to private motives, perverse thoughts, profit-seeking, and craving. Free from external burdens, the body becomes light and unencumbered. Free from internal defilements, the mind becomes light and unburdened. With long and thorough practice, delusive thoughts naturally cease. Constantly guard and attend to it: be cautious in speech, moderate in diet, reduce sleep, and harmonize inner and outer. When the dust and grime are entirely cleansed and not a single thing remains, your original life-spirit will naturally manifest, and you will enjoy effortless mastery—this is the supreme Daoist.\n\nSomeone asked: How does one who cultivates attain purity and stillness?\nThe master replied: When the mind does not chase after things, it is at peace. When the mind does not cling to things, it is empty. A mind that is both at peace and empty is pure and still. Purity and stillness are the Dao itself.\n\nSomeone asked: Those who cultivate often speak of eliminating emotions and desires—is there anything beyond this?\nThe master replied: When emotions are eliminated, one reaches non-emotion; when desires are eliminated, one attains non-desire. What, then, is this state of non-emotion and non-desire?\n\nSomeone asked: Those who cultivate insist on not being deluded—how can one avoid delusion?\nThe master replied: In the beginning, before the mind is refined, one does not know how to enter or exit, how to gather or release. When encountering circumstances or things, one clings to them entirely, muddled and confused, only ceasing when exhausted. Failing to recognize oneself is delusion. It is like being reborn without awareness, unknowingly slipping into another shell, only to return when the karma is exhausted—this is the result of delusion. If one relies solely on knowledge or awareness, one is deluded by knowledge and awareness.\n\nFor those who cultivate, if in every moment of the twelve double-hours they examine themselves and are not stained by anything, passing lightly through circumstances and objects, this is not being deluded.\n\nSomeone asked: How should one safeguard the matters of nature and life?\nThe master replied: Even when moving amidst the myriad dusty realms, though one may respond and harmonize, one must remain the master. Do not blindly follow things. Let affairs not hinder the mind, and let the mind not hinder affairs.",

When encountering demons, do not waver; when facing harm, do not falter. Be thus in safety, be thus in peril. Stake this body without hesitation, with no backward glance.

Seeking like-minded souls, they become friends. These are called *cloud companions and mist friends*, for their minds resemble clouds and mist, untouched by worldly affairs.\n\nOthers study scriptures and teachings, play the qin, recite poetry, engage in lofty discussions, and debate right and wrong. These are called *good companions and wise friends*, for though they do not refine the mind, they at least refrain from evil.\n\nThen there are those who neither cultivate the mind-ground nor study scriptures, who disregard karma, speak perversely, act recklessly, and at the slightest provocation stir up conflict. They boast of their strength, flaunt their prowess, bully the good, and form cliques. These are called *wild companions and strange friends*.\n\nAfter the death of these three kinds of people, each is placed according to their deeds and receives their due retribution. The *cloud companions and mist friends* ascend into the formless, roaming the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or celestial officials. The *good companions and wise friends*, their worldly minds not yet exhausted, remain within the human realm, cycling through rebirth. The *wild companions and strange friends*, having received offerings from all directions yet lacking merit to repay their karmic debts, may fall into the Dark Prison or sink into the animal realm, returning to the paths of suffering.

      "translated_text": "If someone asks, *\"How does one recognize the awakened nature?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"Pointing east while drawing west—such empty gestures are best abandoned. Better to apply real effort instead. For instance, when the heart harbors passions, desires, afflictions, or the delusions of self and others, it is like standing before a vast, slippery well of glass. If you fail to watch even the slightest misstep, you will fall in and remain trapped for ten thousand kalpas. Only when you first perceive the danger and prepare to step forward—then swiftly retreat—does this act of vigilant retreat reveal your awakened nature. If you have already fallen into the pit of self and others, yet still gesture at emptiness and prattle about transcendent matters, how does this concern awakening?\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"What is the settled nature?\"*\nThe master shifts his seat, moves closer, and sits upright in silence for a long while.\nHe says: *\"What settled nature do you ask about?\"*\nThe questioner does not understand. A nearby elder rises, bows deeply, and expresses gratitude.\nThe master says: *\"Zhang drinks the wine, but Li becomes drunk.\"*\nThe questioner laughs heartily and says no more.\n\nIf someone asks, *\"I left the household life to resolve the great matter of birth and death, yet my seeking remains unclear, and I drift in reckless abandon. What is the meaning of this?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"A single thought of non-arising is non-dying. Those who cannot grasp this do so because the heart clings to emotions while the nature gathers dust. As emotions and dust play their games, birth and death never cease. To seek liberation, relinquish whatever arises—relinquish again and again until not even a trace remains, and the original source is pristine. Do not chase sounds, do not chase forms. In every place, be at ease, empty and carefree. Through heaven’s duration and earth’s endurance, the true sovereign will become self-evident. When the heart is upright, all things are upright; when the heart is crooked, all things are crooked. With an inner master established, even beloved things cannot disturb the six senses. Once the true essence is ever-still, what birth and death remain to fear? Yet when one reaches this state, there may arise an uncontrollable restlessness—like a demon’s possession—where the spirit scatters outward in wild abandon, unable to govern itself. Taking this as true joy or true bliss, one fails to recognize that joy without joy is true joy, bliss without bliss is true bliss, and knowledge without knowledge is true knowledge. Now, deluded by the discriminating mind and invaded by perverse qi, one drifts in reckless abandon, beyond any remedy. Some imitate the ancients by singing and dancing in their practice, unaware that even then, such acts were but means to loosen bonds and find release—ways of self-delight, not license to indulge the senses and deceive the world.\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"When the eyes are open, there are dusty realms; when closed, there are dream realms; in crowds, there are realms of adversity and favor. How can one remain at peace?\"*\nThe master replies: *\"For the practitioner, gathering the heart is fundamental. When adversity arises, pass through it with joy; when favor arises, pass through it without attachment. What concern are dusty realms to you? Among others, even a three-year-old child should not be opposed or offended. Always yield. When others oppose or offend you, always endure. In enduring and yielding, merit naturally accrues. When all people show respect, bear all difficulties yourself. Over time, as these responses become habitual, the heart grows pure and stable. In every realm, pass through with equanimity, without the slightest disturbance. Amidst the ten thousand conditions, the heart finds peace, untouched by even a speck of dust—pure and untainted, awake day and night. This accords with the heart of the sages.\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"‘To know the One is to complete all things.’ It is also said, ‘Embrace the primordial and guard the One.’ What, then, is this One?\"*\nThe master says: *\"It is the undifferentiated nature, the state before distinctions arise. Once you know of its existence, you fall into enumeration and can no longer be One. One gives rise to two, two to three, three to the ten thousand things—how can you guard it? Better to be without even the One. Thus, the patriarchs say: ‘Embracing the primordial and guarding the One is effort—yet through heaven’s duration and earth’s endurance, even the One is absent.’ In this absence of the One, the clarity of your own original portion emerges—yet it is not nothing. As the sutra says: ‘To know emptiness as not empty, to know form as not form—this is called illumination.’\"*\n\nIf someone asks, *\"Some monastics study the ancients’ gong’an, others study scriptures. Is it true that the ancient teachings illuminate the heart?\"*\nThe master says: *\"The practitioner refines their own heart to ascend from the ordinary to the sagely. Yet since leaving the household, they refuse to take the heart as their task, instead rummaging through the words of the ancients, making a living from ink on paper, counting lines and tallying characters, entangling themselves in vines of discourse. They exhaust all effort—yet what does it avail? When King Yama comes to call, not a single phrase or word will serve. They would have been better off passing their days in ignorance, for that bears some resemblance to the truth. Instead of chasing such efforts, turn to your own original task. Then you will not waste time in vain.\"*\n\nSomeone asks, *\"What is one’s own original task?\"*\n*\"It is that luminous spark which governs the body, received from the Dao, ever-present from ancient times to the present—what could be lacking? When you verify this principle clearly, it becomes the proof of transcending the ordinary and entering the sagely. If you trust this, begin your practice at once. You already possess such a gong’an—why count others’ treasures as your own? Quickly turn to your own use, and from now on, you will not be deceived by others.\"*\n\nOnce, while engaged in labor, the master gave a general discourse:\n*\"Long ago, beneath the Eastern Hall, there was a carpenter named Zhang the Immortal.

      "translated_text": "The assembly all approved and constantly praised him, and word of this reached the Perfected One. The Perfected One said, *\"Not yet. Let him be tested further, and then it may be so.\"* It is like gold: until it has been refined, its authenticity cannot be known. One day, the Perfected One ordered him to make a meditation bench. The man responded at once and set to work. Before he had finished, he was told to make doors and windows, and though he complied for the moment, a hint of impatience arose. Before half the work was done, he was ordered to make several small boxes, whereupon he refused outright. He argued before the Perfected One, saying he wished to finish one task before beginning another. The Perfected One then said, *\"Formerly, the assembly praised you for being able to respond to others without resistance and without stirring your mind. Today, however, you have failed the test.\"*\n\n*\"For one who cultivates the Way, tempering the mind in response to affairs, there must first be a master within—calm, at ease, and harmonious. Externally, one responds to matters with perfect accuracy. What is to be done first, and what later? Respond to what is most pressing. Even if bones are ground to powder and the body shattered, the mind must not stir. What does it matter whether this task or that is done first? All are but provisional things, without any fixed substance. The mind must die; the mechanism must be alive. Simply respond to what is most pressing in the moment, steadily and securely, without agitation or delusion. This is what is meant by 'constantly responding, constantly still.' \"*\n\nSomeone asked, *\"It is said that karmic connections span three lifetimes. Is this truly so?\"*\nThe master replied, *\"Have you not heard the words of the ancients: 'When delusion is ended, karmic obstructions are fundamentally empty. While delusion remains, one must repay past debts.' Once, a man bore a malignant sore on his back, the pain unbearable, pus and blood flowing unceasingly. Seeking a secluded place, he hanged himself to die. Such a person, having neither understood his own nature nor been willing to bear the debt of pus and blood from a past life, though he brought about his own death, must still repay it in his next existence. How do we know this was a past-life debt? During the reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the former dynasty, there was an imperial son-in-law who was appointed governor of Zhangde Prefecture. Cruel and tyrannical by nature, he would beat and flog his servants without cause whenever he took displeasure. One day, he developed an itch on his buttocks; when he scratched it, the skin came away, and gradually flesh and blood separated, as if he had been freshly tortured. The pain was unbearable, and he died as a result. From this, we know that debts of pus and blood must inevitably be repaid.\"*\n\n*\"Not only this, but even great or small matters of joy and anger, slander and praise, beating and scolding, right and wrong, aversion upon meeting—all are old karmic entanglements from past causes, to be repaid in this life. One must accept them gladly and without resistance. To endure with patience is to repay the debt in full. But if one disputes and contends, it is like refusing to repay a debt, and the burden only grows deeper. Karmic bonds become ever more entangled, with no end in sight. Moreover, Heaven favors repayment. Even when people harm one another out of enmity, it is nothing but the settling of karmic debts.\"*\n\n*\"Recently, I heard that when the Perfected One of Eternal Spring first dwelt in the north, a great general returned from the north. One of his attendants happened to meet a hereditary military commissioner from Shandong whose wife had been taken captive. Since his family had practiced the Dao for generations, he wished to ransom her and allow her to leave the household. He asked the Perfected One for his opinion. The Perfected One calmly refused. Before the matter could be fully discussed, the general had already departed for the north. The attendant then asked the reason for his refusal.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One said: \"This person and her master had a three-year karmic debt between them. Now that they have met, it is precisely time to repay it. Three years later, she indeed obtained her hairpin and robes to leave the household, and came to the Eternal Spring Palace to pay her respects to the Perfected One. Because her family had long practiced goodness, she received this recompense. The assembly then believed and bowed in gratitude.\"\n\nThe Master, on account of a Daoist practitioner who was ill, gave a general discourse: \"Those who cultivate the Way must regulate their diet and maintain regularity in movement and rest. When the heart and spirit are at peace, with no reckless actions, if illness should arise, it is Heaven’s decree—how could one dare not accept it? It is also the unfolding of one’s own destiny, or perhaps a karmic affliction from past causes. First, one must see through this *sì dà* (four great elements)—each is but illusion. If illness comes, let it be illness; if death comes, let it be death. With a composed mind, allow transformations to unfold. If the heart is not fixated on illness, even severe sickness becomes light, and minor ailments resolve on their own. When the true nature is at peace, turbid and foul *qi* disperses. This is also the settling of a karmic debt for illness, or the surmounting of a barrier. If one does not understand this, the heart will not be at ease. At the slightest affliction, the mind becomes frantic, wailing without cease, crying out in pain, cursing Heaven and resenting Earth. One blames others for not supporting them, resents others for not seeking physicians, rages at others for not providing comfort, and reproaches others for not inquiring after them. All the while, one gives free rein to the darkness of ignorance, revealing the depths of karmic consciousness—utterly without merit. They do not realize that life and death are already determined; even if one panics, can it be avoided? With a mind in turmoil, one cannot find peace. They do not know that the heart is the master of the body—when the master is not at ease, the whole body falls into chaos. Have they not heard the ancients say: *When the heart is scattered and the mind is disordered, it is the gate to hell*? Such misguided thoughts invite transgressions. With such an attitude, minor illnesses become severe, and severe illnesses lead to death—all because one has defiled and disturbed their true nature. If one indulges without restraint and falls ill through excess, the illness is self-inflicted, and one must bear it themselves—who else can they blame? Those who cultivate the foundation of the heart do not act in this way. Each of you should reflect on this.\"\n\nThe Master, seeing that a practitioner’s illness had reached its extremity and they could not depart, gave another general discourse: \"Those who cultivate the Way must first see through the emptiness of all phenomena, and next recognize that this bodily form is but a heap of dust. In daily affairs, one should be detached; at the time of departure, one will surely attain freedom. Formerly, in Shandong, there was an abbot who, at the end of his life, lingered and could not be liberated. He sent someone to ask the Perfected One of Eternal Spring. The Perfected One said: 'In the past, you were attached to external conditions and objects, and did not engage in cultivation. Thus, you are now entangled and cannot be liberated.' He sent a message: *'The body is not yours; the nature is fundamentally empty. With not a single thought arising, let the whole body go.'* Upon hearing these words, the abbot seemed to awaken. He instructed his fellow practitioners: 'I was deluded by external conditions, and thus my heart’s foundation remained uncultivated. At the time of departure, I could not be free. Now I urge you all to cultivate diligently, refining body and mind, to resolve the great matter of life and death.' With these words, he passed away.\n\nThere was another Daoist practitioner who, at the point of death, could not depart. He asked those around him: 'How can I go?' Some said: 'Visualize the Perfected.' He meditated for several days but still could not depart. Others said: 'Visualize emptiness.' Again, he could not depart. An old immortal heard of this and came to see him. The practitioner recounted his previous attempts, saying he still could not depart. The old immortal rebuked him: 'What did you bring when you came? What are you trying to visualize as you go? Simply await your fate—when the time comes, you will depart.' Upon hearing these words, the practitioner bowed in gratitude and passed away.\n\nGenerally, those who cultivate the Way must regard all external conditions as provisional tools for the present moment, while their own original true nature requires sincere cultivation. If one can be detached in worldly affairs, how can one not be detached at the time of departure? If one is attached and stained by external things, how can one be detached at the time of departure? Cultivate diligently—life and death are unpredictable, and the day will come when external conditions are of no avail. Each of you should reflect on this.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way must establish resolve and discipline. Yet when they have resolve and discipline, they often become rigid. Rigidity makes one inflexible in matters and affairs. When one becomes flexible in matters and affairs, they may instead fall into procrastination. Thus, among learners, those who are numerous as ox hairs are few, while those who attain the Way are as rare as qilin horns. Some establish resolve but do not know what to do; some know but cannot act; some act but do not persevere. Generally, those who study the Dao must first return to the ancestral source, then establish resolve and discipline. They must understand adaptability, focus single-mindedly, and practice diligently without cease—then there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the *true and constant Dao*?\"\nHe replied: \"Set aside the *true and constant* for now. In the twelve hours of day and night, examine your own heart. Observe what it is before thoughts arise. When thoughts arise, discern whether they are deviant or upright. If they are deviant, extinguish them; if they are upright, employ them. What is a deviant thought? Whenever, in moments of leisure, one engages in premature speculation—all of this is delusion. What is an upright thought? When there are matters at hand, such as receiving others, benefiting beings, respecting superiors, and comforting the assembly—all good intentions that are not for one’s own sake—these are upright thoughts. In stillness, the body is at peace; in activity, one acts with correctness. Neither indulgent nor constrained, neither day nor night, not a single thread obscured, constantly responsive yet constantly still, steady and stable—this is the *true and constant Dao*.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way are hindered by this stubborn heart. From beginningless time, it has revolved through the cycle of rebirth, piling up bones like mountains, dying and being born ten thousand times. Only now do they awaken to past errors and seek liberation.\"",

Since his family had practiced the Dao for generations, he wished to ransom her and allow her to leave the household. He asked the Perfected One for his opinion. The Perfected One calmly refused. Before the matter could be fully discussed, the general had already departed for the north. The attendant then asked the reason for his refusal.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, one dares not eat by day nor sleep by night, refining this stubborn heart until it is utterly overturned and inverted with the mundane—only then may it be of use. Without tempering the heart, one merely sees others as sleepless.\n\nSuch forced effort scatters the mind like hairs, and at the slightest touch, the flames of passion flare. Even if one were to remain sleepless for a hundred years, what good would it serve? If the stubborn heart is not exhausted, the cycle of rebirth continues unbroken. To transform this heart, one must, without distinction of day or night, in every moment of movement and stillness, shatter this stubborn heart to pieces—only then may it be of use. The original true spirit, akin to heaven and earth, then abides in stillness. This Dao moves, this Dao speaks, this Dao falls silent—what else is there to seek? This is the Daoist who has awakened from the wine of delusion.\n\nThe Master often said: \"Those who cultivate the Way must apply effort and vigor to forge the deeply ingrained habits and biased thoughts that have long clung to their own minds. What is difficult to relinquish must be let go, even as the body reaches its limit—then, one may relinquish at will. As for what lies in the heart, all is illusion; when every trace is eradicated, there are no afflictions or obstacles. External matters and things need not occupy the mind, for they come and go like mosquitoes—brushed away, they vanish. Yet what is difficult to dispel from the heart is the very seed of rebirth.\n\nWhen the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring dwelled at Pan Brook, tigers and leopards roamed by night, coming and going at dusk. At first, he felt fear and wished to build a fence at dawn. But he reflected: *In such a realm, if fear arises and one seeks to shield oneself, can birth and death truly be avoided?* He then ceased his efforts, remaining carefree and unconcerned, accepting life and death as they came. His fear dissolved, and amid the realm of birth and death, he stood unmoved, all bonds instantly untied. This is the practice of what is most difficult to practice.\"\n\nThe Master also said: \"Those who cultivate the Way and delve into the great matter of birth and death must apply effort themselves. Undivided by day or night, with a single-minded clarity and the six senses purified, when encountering the realms of sound and form, one sees as if not seeing, hears as if not hearing, and the inner heart remains untainted. The bustle of others is no concern of one’s own, like the wind passing before one’s eyes. If it concerns oneself, one responds only when unavoidable. Through such practice over time, the merit will naturally manifest.\"\n\nThe Master further said: \"Those who cultivate the Way should observe the good in others’ actions and emulate it, but must not fixate on their faults, lest they lose themselves. Nor should they engage in mutual fault-finding. To harbor judgments is to have an unrectified heart, and progress will be long delayed. The upright can conceal the crooked, while the crooked constantly slander the upright. Those who cling to the self and habitually slander others do not understand themselves—they belong to heterodox and deviant sects. Those with true knowledge and right vision must examine their own hearts for bias and error, searching out their own faults. To concern oneself with the faults of others is not the way of the upright.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What are *gong* (merit) and *xing* (practice)?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Silence is *gong*; speech is *xing*.\"\n\n\"What is silence as *gong*?\"\n\"To attain it in stillness, without thought or worry, sealing the mouth and forgetting words, seeking no recognition, concealing one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—this is silence as *gong*.\"\n\n\"What is speech as *xing*?\"\n\"To offer expedient means, teach others to practice, benefit living beings, and point the way to the true Dao—this is speech as *xing*.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Are seeing, hearing, eating, breathing, grasping with the hands, walking with the feet, and thinking with the mind—are these the nature?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The nature of the Dao is not these, yet it is not apart from these. Movement and stillness, speech and silence, are the functions of nature, not its essence. The essence of nature is neither movement nor stillness, neither speech nor silence. An ancient said: *To know the ancestral source of the Great Dao, one must not depart from movement and stillness, speech and silence.* If one takes movement and stillness, speech and silence as the nature, it is like mistaking the servant for the master. The master commands the servant—how could the servant be the master? All actions—raising the hand, moving the foot, speaking, seeing, hearing, and the myriad forms they take, even prolonged stillness—are but servants, not the master. The master abides in the hall and cannot be clearly revealed externally. Yet when one attains its use, one naturally assumes the role of master.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If I devote three years of diligent effort, can I escape the cycle of rebirth?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Those who cultivate the Way must establish firm resolve, advancing with vigor in every moment to refine the heart. How can one presume to predict the future or harbor the conceit of transcending rebirth? There was once a Daoist who, upon first leaving the household life, boasted: *The cycle of rebirth is a trifling matter—with a little effort, I shall be freed from it.* Though he applied himself with determination, an unexpected grave illness befell him, lingering for years and gradually eroding his resolve. How could such an outcome arise from arrogance?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"When I walk or sit alone in the mountains, I personally witness mountain spirits foretelling future events. Is this real?\"\n\nHe replied: \"The hearts of ordinary people cling to the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, obscured and unclear. When beginners leave the household life and refine their dust-laden hearts, they may, by chance, attain stillness and suddenly perceive tranquil realms, giving rise to strange visions—phantasmal apparitions they mistake for the ground of the heart, rejoicing and dancing without cease. Some may seem to foresee future events, or hear voices in the void predicting what is to come, with occasional confirmations. Others may directly encounter past masters, true immortals, or divine beings who appear before them to impart teachings on the heart. If one clings to these experiences, it is a sign of deviation. If not abandoned, they become a sickness of the heart, incurable by any method.\"",

      "translated_text": "Have you not heard the ancients say: \"Perception, awareness, and cognition are themselves afflictions\"? How much more so when what the eyes see, the ears hear, and the mind contemplates all belong to the realm of sound and form. Have you not heard the sutra declare: \"That which can be seen is not to be seen; that which can be heard is not to be heard. Words cannot reach it; thought cannot attain it.\" Now, if one mistakes what arises in the realm of sound and form for the truth, one has already fallen into the deviant path.\n\nOnce, a Daoist practitioner in deep meditation suddenly tasted wine in his mouth, and later dreamed of someone delivering wine. The next day, someone indeed brought wine. This was merely the spirit responding to an empty mind—nothing extraordinary. To cling to such an experience is to fall into deviation.\n\nAnother practitioner, while seated in meditation, suddenly felt his spirit wander outside, traveling several hundred paces before returning, only to find his original form still seated upright. This, too, was nothing extraordinary—no different from ordinary thoughts drifting outward, save for a slight increase in clarity. To regard this as an achievement is to fall into deviation.\n\nAs the common saying goes: \"A thousand auspicious signs are not as good as none; only equanimity and tranquility accord with the Dao.\"\n\nWhen the master discussed the opening of wisdom’s treasury, he said: For those who begin the path, leaving behind the external world is like a mirror suddenly polished clear. When wisdom’s treasury opens, thoughts flow into coherent expression—but one must not cling to this. If the mind becomes fixed and functions without stimulus, it turns into wild wisdom, devoid of true merit. This is merely the activity of spirit, not the essence of the Dao. One must not boast of such abilities but should instead cultivate and nurture them.\n\nWhen the master addressed the topic of dwelling in the mountains, he said: The practitioner must see through whatever arises and respond appropriately to each situation. Each time one responds, it is like lifting a single burden. Once lifted, it is left behind.\n\nOnce, a Daoist lived in the mountains, wearing clothes of grass and eating wild plants, vowing never to descend, believing he had shed all worldly entanglements. One day, two men arrived, each carrying weapons, demanding food and drink. The master quickly cooked mountain fruits to offer them. Before the fruit had softened, one of the men reached into the pot, tasted it, and angrily declared: \"To serve such food to others—you deserve to have your pot smashed!\" The master remained silent, observing their anger and harsh words. Secretly, he devised a plan: stepping outside under some pretext, he retrieved a hidden staff, gripped it tightly, and shouted: \"Come out, both of you! You won’t get near me!\" The two men emerged, laughing: \"Living in the mountains has nurtured such arrogance in you—you’d be better off descending to become an ordinary man.\" They then departed, vanishing from sight. The master realized they were sages testing him and could only regret his failure.\n\nThis is what it means to fail a trial in the realm of circumstances.\n\nWhen the master discussed the topic of an unmoving mind, he said: Once, in Shandong, a practitioner boasted to his master that he had refined away the fire of ignorance. The master replied: \"If the fire of ignorance is extinguished, the mind does not move—then you are a worthy person.\" Later, the master secretly sent someone to test him. At dusk, the visitor arrived to find the hut’s door already closed. He loudly struck the door with his staff. The practitioner inside responded, his voice already strained, and reluctantly opened the door. The visitor appeared agitated and violent. Upon entering the hall, he did not remove his shoes but leapt onto the meditation seat, displaying no manners. The master grew furious and reached out to reprimand him. The visitor clasped his hands and smiled: \"I dared not act this way—your master sent me to test whether your mind truly remains unmoved. Before the test even began, it was already evident. No further trial is needed.\" The practitioner was deeply ashamed, unable to respond.\n\nGenerally, even those with some skill in cultivation should not boast. If one is unaware, the test will expose one’s true state. Only when the heart is ashen and the form withered does the thought of self-praise vanish. Once boasting arises, the test has already exposed the flaw. Even if one attains an unmoving state, there is still more beyond.\n\nWhen the master discussed dwelling in seclusion and guarding stillness, he said: Once, a practitioner had sat in seclusion for years. One day, others invited him out, and he moved about freely. An old friend saw him and asked: \"Brother, what you gained in stillness—can it be applied amid distraction? Have you truly attained the state of perfect immovability?\" The practitioner remained haughtily silent for a long time. The friend then said: \"I have a touchstone to distinguish truth from falsehood. Try describing what you gained in your years of stillness—let’s see what it is.\" The practitioner replied: \"What is there to say about stillness?\" The friend said: \"If that’s the case, you might as well grow fur and horns and repay your karmic debts with your mouth.\" The practitioner flew into a rage, hurling insults. The friend laughed: \"This is what you gained in seclusion—it’s been tested and revealed.\" The practitioner became resentful and severed the friendship for life.\n\nThis person had never tempered his mind amid circumstances. Even if he sat in stillness for a hundred years, it would be of no use. It is like tying a horse to keep it still—once the rope is loosened, it gallops as before.\n\nThe master often said: The practitioner is like a master carpenter cutting wood. First, one must align the heart’s inked line. Then, at the places where the wood is crooked, gradually apply the axe and adze to shape it into proper material, suitable for any use. One must not disturb the inked line. If the line is lost, there will be no standard to follow. When the crooked parts are fully trimmed away and the inked line stands true, it will naturally align with others, and all manner of vessels can be crafted.\n\nThe master also said: The practitioner should always keep the mind free of affairs, upright and proper. Every day, hour by hour, moment by moment, one must examine the true abode of one’s original spirit, clearly and without obscurity, merging with the vast emptiness. Only then is this the heart of a Daoist. Through accumulated days and accumulated effort, spiritual verification will naturally arise. Thus, rather than chasing after all manner of activities, it is better to rest and examine oneself.",

      "translated_text": "If one constantly directs the mind toward external things, drifting through days by habit, this is no different from the mundane heart.\n\nThe master, addressing the assembly’s discussion on assuming the abbot’s seat, said: A practitioner who takes up residence in a monastery must measure their strength and act accordingly, passing each day with simplicity, lightness, and ease. One must not, like the worldly, contend for fame and profit, thereby losing the original heart and forgetting the great cause of life and destiny—this is the true principle. If one can temper and refine the mind in this way, willingly going where one is unwilling, facing hardship where it must be faced, and attaining a heart that is stable and unshaken, then in receiving guests from all directions, one benefits both self and others, settling the mind and accumulating practice, thus fulfilling both merit and conduct. If one does not refine the heart but mistakes external things for the self, one will be endlessly greedy and covetous, narrow in habit and disposition, following the faults of the vulgar and ruining one’s future path.\n\nThe master, exhorting the assembly to reside in the monastic community, said: Master Danyang has a lyric that goes: *To learn the Dao and dwell in the monastic community, measure shallow and deep, explore and seek; choose the good as one’s intimate friend. If one cannot yet grasp the ultimate principle, take hold of the essentials and lift them clear.* In the monastic community, all should instruct one another in turn, lifting the guiding threads and shaking the main cords, together cultivating the supreme Dharma-gate of the mind-ground—this is no small matter. Yet there are those without insight or inclination who neither seek wise companions nor dwell in the monastic community, nor discuss the mind-ground. They wander south and north, across a thousand mountains and ten thousand streams, wearing out their straw sandals in vain. They only seek places of convenience and ease, and at the slightest touch or bump, they flee at once. When they wish to settle, they seek a fine dwelling and look for favorable conditions, not knowing what is most pressing for themselves, nor how to pass the days—only pursuing ease. Little do they know that ahead lies the decisive arrival of birth and death. What will you rely on then? How can one drift through days, wasting time in vain? For what purpose did one originally leave the household life? Clear-minded gentlemen, ponder this carefully.\n\nThe master, addressing those engaged in labor who became unsettled, said: Though external conditions are provisional, a practitioner cannot fail to respond. Yet in responding, one must be without self, the mind’s substance empty and open. When matters arise, there is no obstruction, for emptiness does not hinder the myriad affairs, nor do the myriad affairs hinder emptiness. Like the space between heaven and earth, the ten thousand images and things all move of themselves, without any hindrance. If the mind harbors the mark of self, when matters arise, one must oppose them, and thus there will be friction. One cannot pass through swiftly, and when bumped or struck, the self-mind is stirred. Once the self-mind is stirred, one cannot remain steady. Though one toils all day, it is labor without achievement. Living among the great assembly and engaging in labor, one must specially guard the self-mind, not allowing it to be easily moved. Constantly examine one’s own faults, never mind those of others—this is merit and conduct. When matters come to hand, one must take them up. In the face of the ten thousand conditions and dusts, do not follow after them. Let the self-mind be clear and bright, and do not discriminate anything. Passing days in this way, the beginner’s resolve will not retreat, and merit will naturally be attained.\n\nThe master said: If a practitioner has one part of effort, one part of a superior mind arises. If one has ten parts of effort, ten parts of a superior mind arise. Once there is a superior mind, then there is the mark of self. The mark of self and the superior mind create great obstructions. How can one attain the state where the mind is empty and the realm is extinguished? One must add even greater intensity, pressing one’s own body and mind beneath the ten thousand things, always placing oneself after others. Reflect that in a thousand, in ten thousand ways, one is not as good as others, and only then can one dispel the mind that seeks to surpass others. When the mind is the same as the great emptiness, then there is no self. With no self, one accords with the Dao.\n\nThe master said: In the stillness of cultivation, the realms that appear are manifold, all transformations of one’s own discriminating spirit, arising in stillness to lure the sovereign mind. Have you not heard the ancient saying: *All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows*? When the mind seeks to dispel the discriminating spirit, if the spirit still remains, it transforms into forms and images—spirit-heads and ghost-faces—confusing and disturbing the sovereign mind. If the sovereign remains unmoved, seeing as if not seeing, its substance the same as emptiness, with no place to abide, the transformations will naturally disperse. There will be no realm to become a demon, nothing that can be harmed.\n\nOnce there was a Daoist who had attained rest for the mind. One day, while sitting, he suddenly saw countless evil spirits arriving through the air. The man stabilized his mind, his substance like emptiness, darkly undiscriminating. He abandoned this body, allowing life and death to take their course. The demons dispersed of themselves. Because the sovereign was present, utterly still and unmoving, how could there be demonic illusions? It was also because the mind was not yet fully extinguished, and thus these appearances manifested. When the nature and substance are profoundly still, they naturally vanish.\n\nSomeone asked: What of the merit of those who practice seated meditation?\n\nThe master replied: Once, when True Man Changchun was in Shandong, he came to a monastery where a practitioner was in seated meditation, and the assembly was holding a vegetarian feast. Later, someone informed the True Man that the master in meditation wished to speak with him. The True Man instructed that they meet after the feast. Without waiting to be asked, the True Man went outside, found the meditation chamber, and struck its door loudly several times with his staff. The master inside, thinking it was an ordinary person, responded in anger. The True Man then left. After the feast, the assembly again requested that they meet. The True Man said: I have already tested him. This person still harbors the mind of self and others—he is not yet ready for discourse. And so he departed.",

      "translated_text": "Generally, dwelling in stillness is fundamentally for the great matter of nature and life—consolidating and securing, with nurturing as the practice. When encountering circumstances without disturbance, this is the verification. Now, the sound of knocking at the door is a circumstance; the response is the mind. If the mind forgets the self, it is like cold ashes extinguished—stirred, there is clarity, yet no flame. Unmoved by circumstances, calmly passing through, this is where the mind has cultivated skill. Now, hearing a slight empty sound, the mind is already stirred—how can one pass through all adverse circumstances? Though dwelling in seclusion, what benefit is there? Receiving others’ offerings, how can one not repay the debt of the mouth? It would be better to turn toward the realm of activity, in matters and things, single-mindedly tempering this mind—this is a person with insight and interest.\n\nSomeone asked: Practitioners speak of knowing and awareness, yet also call it an illness—what is the meaning?\n\nThe master replied: True knowing is the knowing of not-knowing; true awareness is the awareness of no-awareness. The original true spirit, obscured for ten thousand kalpas, has only now awakened—this is called awareness. All knowledge and perception arise from this. If one speaks of having knowing and awareness, and insists on constant knowing and constant awareness, this is self-entanglement and self-binding, like cauterizing oneself without illness. If one is entirely without knowing or awareness, one entirely enters another shell. Having awakened to the original source, knowing and awareness are both tools—use them when needed, but do not make them constant.\n\nThe master said: When a practitioner’s dusty mind suddenly ceases and worldly concerns vanish, the original true source of the self stands revealed alone—this is the primordial master from before heaven. Once one assumes this, one is carefree and at ease, and all dharma realms are penetrated at once. If one reaches this state, one must conceal one’s light and hide one’s traces, protecting and nurturing it—more effort yields more merit. If one raises the intention to display it, one unknowingly dims the radiance.\n\nThe master said: Practitioners differ in their natures, some sharp, some dull. Those of dull nature should not cling rigidly; they ought to dwell in the monastic community, humbly cultivating the mind, and form affinities with those who understand principle and illuminate the mind. When the affinity ripens, they will naturally be guided into the Dao and gradually awaken. If one’s nature is dull and stagnant, and one lacks insight or interest, spending each day with those of the same kind, associating with worldly dust, the dusty circumstances will ripen, and one will surely retreat from the Dao. Perhaps encountering demonic states, seeing hellish visions, with no one to save them, one sinks and falls—deeply lamentable.\n\nThe master said: Once there was a recluse who heard people speak of the \"ground.\" Upon entering seclusion, he wished to see the ground. This thought persisted, and as the thought arose, it manifested—yet he did not know it was false. What the ears hear belongs to sound; what the eyes see belongs to form; what the mind imagines belongs to delusion. Thus, he saw golden youths and jade maidens, true immortals and sages appearing in form, seen clearly in broad daylight—yet these were all illusory realms, fabricated by deluded thoughts. Taking them as the ground, unable to break through, he muddled through his life, attaching to the demonic and the possessed. He did not know that the \"ground\" is where the ancients’ minds and actions reached a stable and restful state—hence the name. Like a person’s dwelling place, clearing away brambles, sweeping aside rubble, the ground is leveled, suitable for residence—this is called the \"ground.\" For practitioners, when the mind-ground is stable and nothing disturbs it alone, this is the \"unmoving ground\"; when the myriad dusts cannot stain it, this is the \"pure ground\"; when one’s original dharma-body is revealed, fully and clearly assumed—this is the \"luminous ground.\" Generally, the \"ground\" has boundaries and locations. If one reaches the state of no ground, no direction, beyond names and words—this is what is called \"mysterious and again mysterious.\" How could one claim to have attained it merely through what the eyes see, the ears hear, or the mind imagines?\n\nThe master said: Non-action is the Dao of heaven; action is the Dao of humans. Non-action aligns with heaven; action aligns with humans. Like a person carrying a load, if both ends are balanced, it is steady; if one end is dropped, it becomes lopsided. If both ends are released, even the carrying pole is gone—one returns to the original state.\n\nThe master said: Once, at the Eastern Hall, it rained, and the manager called for general labor, regardless of age, to move the bricks. Everyone rushed to respond, except for one old immortal who sat calmly without going out. When the task was done, the assembly gathered, and someone spoke to True Man Changchun about it. The True Man rebuked them, saying: How much are a few broken bricks worth? One person tempering the mind has truly reached the place of rest—like a priceless pearl, it depends on each person’s mind-ground and how they act. Generally, in the teaching gate, valuing the attainment of people is paramount.\n\nThe master said: Once, beneath True Man Changchun’s hall, there was a kitchen attendant. Everyone praised his gentleness and humility, never having seen him disturbed. The True Man, knowing this, secretly sent someone to test him. In the morning, they moved the kitchen utensils to another place. When the attendant prepared congee, soaking the rice and filling the pot, he searched in vain for the ladle and spoon, until the pot overflowed—then his mind was greatly disturbed. Seeing this, the True Man taught him: Even if it all overflowed, it is merely an external thing—why let it harm the mind? The attendant then realized, bowed in gratitude, and that was all.\n\nA physician asked: I practice medicine and have revived over a hundred people from death—what is the result?\n\nThe master replied: Even if you saved all the people in the world, it would not compare to saving yourself from life and death. Worldly blessings have limits, but if you cultivate yourself to the state beyond life and death, this blessing is boundless.\n\nA craftsman asked: I built a great hall without charging for labor—with such sincerity, what is the corresponding fruit?\n\nThe master replied: It is not as good as a person of purity sitting in silence for an hour. For the blessings of action decay, but the blessings of non-action do not decay.",

      "translated_text": "The Master often addressed the assembly, saying: \"In this human life, all that one does and accomplishes will inevitably meet with retribution. Thus, those who embody the Dao attain the Dao; those who perform blessings receive blessings; those who commit transgressions incur transgressions. Those who love others are loved in return; those who despise others are despised. Those who respect others are respected; those who slight others are slighted. The humble are uplifted by others; the trustworthy are trusted. Those who benefit others are benefited; those who harm others are harmed. The self-exalting are humbled by others; those who seek precedence are contested. The self-assertive meet with resistance. As it is said: plant orchids and you reap fragrance; sow millet and you harvest grain—such is the principle of retribution. If one harbors a mind of profit, acting with deceit to win others’ hearts, one loses the true Way.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"For those who cultivate the Way, the greatest taboo is to speak of others’ strengths and weaknesses, or to discuss matters of rise and fall—all worldly affairs that do not concern oneself. Such things must not be spoken of with the mouth nor pondered in the heart. To engage in gossip is to obscure one’s own clarity. If one focuses solely on refining the mind and constantly examining one’s own faults, how can there be time to meddle in others’ affairs? In all dealings with others, one should emulate their virtues and avoid their vices, never concerning oneself with them, gradually attaining stillness.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The assembly speaks of cultivators: to cease dwelling in the village is to attain the Dao; to cease consuming wine and meat is to ascend in flight; to cease attachment to family is to become an immortal. Cease craving the love of others, cease resenting their faults. Let nothing be taken as oneself—recognize nothing as truly belonging to you. Even in sleep, do not seek the Dao. Do not associate with unworthy companions; do not speak useless words. When things go well, do not rejoice; when they go ill, do not grieve. Learn from those superior to yourself; teach those who are not. When others wrong you, it is your fortune; when you wrong others, it is your misfortune. Words that exceed deeds are empty; deeds that surpass words are solid. Those with desires belong to the human realm; those with a mind free of dust belong to the immortal path. The willing humble are exalted; the willing poor are enriched. Returning to the constant accords with the Dao; following principle accords with others. The true Way should be practiced; the deviant path must not be entered. Penetrate the Dao, illuminate virtue, and embody the perfect integration of essence and function. This is called the Perfected Whole.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The ancients who sought the Dao, if their minds were not yet enlightened, would travel a thousand miles to seek a teacher and inquire deeply. If their connection was as precise as a needle meeting a magnet, their minds became clear, and all doubts vanished. Then, whether dwelling in a walled garden, retiring to forests and springs, begging in the marketplace, or establishing a temple, they settled their minds and guarded the Dao, never wavering—such were the superior cultivators of truth. There are those who leave the household life yet remain ignorant in nature, too lazy to seek instruction, arrogant and competitive, clinging to their own views, feigning the appearance of a high adept. They neglect their practice and lose their conduct, failing in both worlds. They accept offerings from others without considering whether their own virtue is sufficient to repay them. Such people are unfit to dwell in gardens or beg for alms. When the hour of life and death arrives, they are of no use, for they have refused to cultivate at the root. Even after a hundred years, they achieve nothing.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: The practitioner of cultivation gathers and settles the mind as one would a carved wooden sacred image seated in the hall. Whether no one is present all day or servants and maids crowd around, whether offered incense and flowers or met with slander and defamation—it remains thus. Yet unlike the wooden image, it is spiritually awakened and sagely responsive, alive and luminous, illuminating the Dao and virtue. In all matters and things, however, it does not cling.\n\nThe Master said: The Daoist refines the heart as one casts gold to make a rooster. Though its form and color resemble a rooster’s, its heart remains unmoved, standing alone among the flock. Though roosters are combative, none dare approach. The one who embodies the Dao has a heart like cold ashes and a form like withered wood. Though the world may be full of those who love contention, none can contend with them. Thus the scripture says: \"Only because they do not contend does the world find none to contend with them.\"\n\nThe Master said: This has substance and function, transcends self and other, and is the upright and true heart, received since before the primordial chaos when there was neither heaven nor earth. It cannot be called existent, nor can it be called nonexistent. All sages and worthies of past and present, all Daoist adepts under heaven, have attained this and then put it to use. The thousands of scriptures and ten thousand treatises, even the entire canon, speak only of this. Heaven operates by this, earth operates by this, and even the ten thousand things of heaven and earth, the boundless expanse of emptiness, are governed by this subtle workings. Those who comprehend it are not led astray by any circumstance, not manipulated by any thought or worry, not deceived by the six senses. This is the daily practice of immortals, the conduct of sages and worthies, and the path of the adept.\n\nThe Master said: When dwelling in a monastic community, people gather from all directions—how could they all be of one kind, identical in nature? It is like a great mountain, where grasses and trees are fully arrayed: some are useless timber, some become fine wood, some stand alone, some cling to others. There are auspicious sprouts and rare herbs, and there are wild thickets and brambles. All differ according to their nature, following their own course, each in its proper place. The mountain’s body stands majestically, making no distinctions, yet embracing all. Flowing water and piled stones, lush forests and abundant grasses, beasts that run and birds that sing—all manifest wondrous function and spiritual efficacy. They mutually sustain one another, like hemp supporting the mallow, which stands straight without support. Over time, each attains its fulfillment. If one sought to cut the long to patch the short, or change blue to yellow, not only would none find peace, but their original nature would be lost.\n\nThe Master said: In former days, when I resided as abbot in Shandong, I shut my door all day and avoided worldly affairs for over ten years, taking stillness as my heart’s disposition. Yet I accomplished nothing in practice or conduct. Sitting alone where no one came, untouched by others, unmet by circumstances or things—how could this heart reveal its growth or decay? It was merely passing time in emptiness. If heaven does not benefit things, the four seasons do not turn; if earth does not benefit things, the ten thousand things do not grow. If one cannot benefit oneself and others, what merit is there? Thus the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring said: \"To act is to pacify people and benefit things, aligning with the Dao of heaven and earth.\"\n\nThe Master said: If the practitioner’s mysterious pass remains unopened and the mind-ground is unclear, if they are constantly driven by karmic consciousness and cannot abide in non-action, it is because they lack good fortune and virtue. They should then apply effort within the teachings according to their capacity, establishing merit and deeds, welcoming and attending to newcomers, humbling the mind, revering teachers and companions, constantly practicing kindness, and casting aside selfishness and deceit. Over time, as conditions ripen and progress is made day by day, there will naturally be breakthroughs. Do not merely carry the burden of emptiness at both ends, unable to engage in non-action or action, drifting through days without merit or conduct. Rest where it is stable, taste where it is sweet, idly meddle in worldly affairs, intrude where unwelcome, indulge body and mind, and show no fear of the divine—yet the day of reckoning will come. Have you not heard the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring say: \"To cultivate the mind-ground, wholly abandon worldly affairs; to apply effort in the teachings, fully engage in worldly toil\"? If you lack the work of the mind-ground and do not apply effort in the teachings, drifting through days—consider for yourself, what kind of person are you?\n\nThe Master said: Conditions and causes have their number, not subject to human effort. One must follow nature, peacefully awaiting destiny. Inner cultivation and outer conduct depend entirely on the self. If one can apply effort, one will have merit. Whether one practices or not, each attains accordingly. If the teachings are not open, one should withdraw and conceal oneself, harmonizing the heart with heaven. When the teachings are open, outer conduct should also respond, aligning with heaven and meeting others. Merit is not嫌多, conduct is not嫌广. Only with a steadfast heart can one attain accomplishment.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao is present everywhere, in every situation, and all forms are real. It depends only on how one applies it in the moment—what else could there be? Yet people’s hearts are heavily obscured by worldly dust and karmic ties. They do not understand the root, plucking leaves and seeking branches, chasing waves, and few turn back. Even if they delve deeply, they do not seek truth, twisting and fabricating, seeing spirits and ghosts, piling heads upon heads, turning back and forth in confusion. They do not realize that this illusory body is limited, that time is fleeting, and that with one breath gone, what then?\n\nThe Master said: In daily life, let the heart be free of杂念, the mind not wander outward. Release without dissipation, restrain without constraint. Illuminate the mind and recognize the dharma, transcend wisdom and leave emptiness. In the twelve hours of the day, let each thought be present. If one clings to the present, it is not in accord with principle; if one departs from the present, there is no such place. Comprehend movement and stillness, know going and coming, let go of everything, be without entanglement or obstruction—this is the person of carefree ease. Yet all words fall short; one must discern for oneself.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without fail. How could they distinguish this as good or that as evil? Their covering and bearing are the same, their illumination and oversight are the same. Thus, those who stand above are placed there by the Mandate of Heaven. They ought to emulate Heaven’s all-covering embrace, nurturing and cherishing all those below, making no distinction between my nobility and your humility. Those who stand below are likewise ordained by the Mandate of Heaven to be there. They ought to emulate Earth’s bearing of Heaven, revering and obeying those above, never daring the slightest negligence.\n\nExisting between Heaven and Earth, one must align with the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Otherwise, acting beyond one’s proper place invites misfortune, calamity, punishment, and retribution.\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner of cultivation, in their fundamental nature, suffers no deficiency. In conduct and deeds, they apply intention; in the face of external phenomena, they pass swiftly by; in human affairs, they remain unattached. Private and wayward thoughts do not arise; not even the finest speck is established, nor the tiniest dust clings. Bright, clear, and empty—neither clinging to emptiness nor to existence, neither grasping at dharma-appearances nor at the view of self. Merging with the light of all beings, over time they mutually sustain one another, fusing inner and outer, and thus attain the station of the sage. What further doubt could there be?\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner of cultivation acts or withdraws according to their lot, takes or leaves as circumstances allow, humbles the heart, and takes impartiality as their rule. They examine the source of movement and stillness, regulate the use of seeing and hearing. Cutting off all entanglements, they focus the mind on the true and constant. Through endless kalpas, they remain unchanging and indestructible.\n\nThe Master said: In daily life, the Daoist embodies Heaven and models Earth, ever pure and ever still, luminous yet not obscured, aiding beings and benefiting life. Though immersed in the dust of the ten thousand phenomena, the true source remains serene and undisturbed, without interruption. They naturally attain liberation from the bonds of birth and death—this is the great matter of karmic causation. Yet how many, failing to awaken, lack inner mastery? Desires assail them from within, the senses and their objects lure them from without, and they cannot attain freedom. From this, the four kinds of birth revolve, the six paths of existence turn, and the skin of the head is changed—how different from today!\n\nThe Master said: Those who pursue the Dao embrace simplicity and hold fast to purity, subtly penetrating and silently enacting. They eliminate emotions and abandon desires, diminishing and preserving, acting without self-interest, conducting affairs with clarity. They yield to others and cultivate benevolence, accumulating virtue. The slightest fault they must remove; the most minute merit they must accumulate. Right and wrong both dissolved, mind and dharma both forgotten, the mechanism of the highest truth naturally becomes clear.\n\nThe Master said: Those who cultivate the Dao, having originally left the household life, do so because the great matter of life and destiny presses upon them. Yet with the passage of years, unawares, they are swayed by external things, learning instead the tricks of the tongue, a hundred kinds of skill—all mere servile labor. How can one know this? Simply observe: whenever one relies on such arts, one inevitably desires to display them before others. This is to be enslaved by others—how could it be the work of one who is pure, still, and free? Thus it is said: The wise are not used by the wise, but by the foolish. The skillful are not employed by the skillful, but by the clumsy. For example, the eloquent speak, while the silent listen. Examine this closely—who is busy, and who is at ease? If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, the mind-ground must be clear, yet one guards simplicity and clumsiness. Then all the wisdom and skill under Heaven will be at one’s service.\n\nThe Master said: The essential subtleties transmitted by the true teachers of the highest truth align with the hidden will of Heaven in all actions. How could clinging to one aspect alone constitute the Dao? Observing their traces, the methods of the ancients differed in each case, yet the wondrous root-source was never distinct. It is like the functioning of the human mind: in the eye, it sees; in the ear, it hears; in the mouth, it speaks; in the mind, it thinks; in the hand, it grasps; in the foot, it walks. Though its functions vary, the essence of the mind remains unchanged. Moreover, the secret teachings of the true masters—what is called \"transmission beyond the teachings\"—lie beyond the reach of words and thoughts. Those who awaken attain it for themselves; this is the wondrous secret of the true teacher’s transmission.\n\nThe Master said: My Dao is secretly transmitted. It cannot be sought with intention, nor attained without intention. It is known through not-knowing, attained through not-attaining. The deluded of the world seek the Dao through attire and appearance, through speech and discourse, through solemn demeanor, through dharma-appearances—none grasp its wholeness. Little do they realize that the Dao leaves no traces. To seek it through traces is not the Dao. Instead, investigate the origin of these traces. Knowing whence they arise, one finds that what abides within is neither sound nor form, neither contrivance nor solemnity, neither dharma-appearance nor self-view. It is beyond all knowing and knowledge. Simply this: the original completeness, utterly real, in accord with Heaven and Earth, with sages and worthies, with spirits and the myriad things. Such is the great matter of karmic causation—how could the dust and defilement of the voice-hearers’ traces ever perceive it? The Perfected One of Danyang said: \"True joy, true leisure—beyond all discussion. Utterly subtle, utterly wondrous—beyond all reckoning. Where reckoning ends, nearness begins.\"\n\nThe Master said: Even those who have long dwelt in the monastic community, receiving instruction and discipline day and night, may yet grow negligent, procrastinate, and fail to advance. The mind of the Dao gradually wanes, worldly affairs increase daily, and they become reckless and unruly, unable to attain emptiness and stillness. How much more so for those who, living in the world, act alone and independently? The dust of worldly passions lingers, love and attachment entangle, and obstacles to the Dao arise at every turn—yet they remain unaware. Though they encounter sages and worthies, they cannot be transformed. They fabricate a hundred deceptions, deluding the common folk, gradually sinking into ruin. Their blessings diminish, their karma grows, and their burden deepens. If they would but turn back, they could still be saved. But if they cling to the dust and turn from the Dao, there is nothing to be done—hell is not far off.\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao do not tire of inquiry and questioning. It is like one traveling a road: by asking diligently, one does not go astray.",

Without encountering a guide at the outset, by what means can one attain it? Of all suffering, none is greater than birth and death; without drawing near to a perfected one, how can one escape it? Thus it is said: \"The ancients did not study the Dao lightly—they served true masters until old age.\" If one does not know where to begin, nor draws near to those who have attained, even with resolve and discipline, one will err a thousand times over.\n\nThe Master said: From the beginning, those who study the Dao must only endure hardship for themselves while benefiting others, silently accumulating merit and conduct. If one indulges the mind in improper actions, not only does one disgrace the teaching, but one also invites calamity upon oneself. To live and speak without purity or restraint is no different from the common world. To enjoy the sweat and blood of the ten directions in this way is no small matter—what is taken in ease will be repaid in suffering.

If the mind is not gathered, what use is it? Consider those who gamble, play chess, weave, spin, or grind—if they stay awake all night, are they all enlightened? Such people are driven by profit at every hour, their minds restless as mosquitoes biting the skin, and so they cannot sleep. The practitioner is not like this. Sleep is but one desire; if it is not transformed, it breeds delusion, darkening the mind and belonging to the yin realm. It is like one guarding against thieves, sitting upright in vigil—the thieves will retreat of their own accord. To focus solely on refining the heart is to fear dissipation. This heart has no fixed form: in yang it is bright, in yin it is dark. When familiar states do not arise, and non-action brings clarity, the luminous pearl of nature shines forth—this is why one remains sleepless day and night.\n\nSomeone asked: Why do Dao students willingly endure poverty and hardship?\nThe answer: If one merely takes poverty, hunger, and cold as virtue, then the destitute and struggling in the streets would all be immortals. The practitioner takes the Dao and virtue as the heart, purity as the mind, cutting away deceit, greed, and reckless action, casting them all aside. Forgetting form and self, one does not fix the mind on external things. Thus it is said: \"A robe of cloth covers the skin and flesh—what need to choose fine or coarse? Food fills the belly—what need to select refined or rough?\" Only liberation from birth and death and the refinement of the heart matter, so one does not dwell on the suffering of the body.\n\nSomeone asked: Are there future rewards and punishments, or not?\nThe answer: Let us not speak of the future—consider the present. When you kindle a good thought, wishing to burn incense and bow before a sacred teacher, taking the incense in hand and vowing, \"May my family be safe, may blessings and longevity increase,\" this is not a mind that performs good, yet you expect reward. Even if reward comes, you will not know it. Those who cultivate good do so openly but receive hidden recompense, so they are never aware of it. But if you harbor an evil thought, raising a knife to kill, the moment the thought arises, you must repay with your life. This cannot be done in the clear and impartial light—it is in the obscure and unfathomable that one creates it, and before long, it will be exposed, and you will repay with your life. This is not seeking punishment and receiving it—this punishment is known. Those who do evil act in secret but are repaid openly. This is a matter of present human action, and it is inevitably clear. Moreover, heaven observes what people do not—where can one flee? One cannot but be cautious.\n\nSomeone asked: There have long been teachings of heaven and hell—are they real?\nThe answer: Heaven is the yang realm, governing good and blessing. Hell is the yin realm, governing evil and misfortune. The ancients established these teachings, but heaven and hell arise from the human heart. The heart’s actions respond in darkness. To be constantly pure and still, benefiting all, practicing all virtues with clarity and without obscurity—this belongs to the yang realm. All manner of evil, deceit, and injustice, straying into perverse paths—this belongs to ignorance and darkness, growing in cycles, accumulating filth and defilement, all recorded in the black ledger. Neither gods nor humans tolerate it; the lord of the heart is tormented, suffering assails from all sides, and no one comes to the rescue—this is hell. The ancients said: \"A clear heart and tranquil mind are the path to heaven; a distracted heart and chaotic mind are the gate to hell.\" It is like a mountain path where rumors speak of bandits ambushing travelers and harming them. If one believes and turns back, one will avoid harm. If one does not believe and stumbles forward drunk, one may pass unharmed—or if bandits are truly there, one will fall into their trap, and regret will come too late. The teaching of hell is of this nature. In short, doing evil is not like doing good. Good brings no blame—what fault is there? But forcing one’s way in evil paths will bring misfortune. If one does not repent even when the consequences are clear before one’s eyes, how much less can one know the hidden and obscure?\n\nSomeone asked: It is said that the supreme matter is inherent in everyone—why refine it further?\nThe answer: An unrefined mind is like gold in ore—before smelting, it is but a stubborn stone. Placed in a great furnace, the dross is burned away, and the true substance is separated. Once refined into gold, it is no longer ore. The practitioner is the same. The mind, long obscured by delusion and attachment, is like crude ore. With resolve as the great bellows and wisdom as the craftsman, one refines it diligently, leaving not a trace, smelting forth the originally unimpeded true heart.",

Their blessings diminish, their karma grows, and their burden deepens. If they would but turn back, they could still be saved.

It is like one traveling a road: by asking diligently, one does not go astray.",

      "translated_text": "Once true, it is no longer false—guard it well, secure and preserve it, and it will serve you of its own accord. This is the everlasting, perfectly luminous, boundless treasure-jewel of old.\n\nSomeone asked: When one reaches the state of purity and non-action, has one penetrated to the end?\nThe answer: Spoken in terms of essence, this seems so but is not. As for the true and exact point, it cannot be spoken, cannot be thought, cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing. Only when names and words are utterly transcended does one begin to correspond with it. It is neither identical with movement and stillness nor separate from them—how could it be defined as non-action and purity?\n\nSomeone asked: I once heard that Master Danyang attained the Dao swiftly through awakening to death—what is the meaning of this?\nThe answer: The practitioner should regard this body as a condemned prisoner being dragged to the execution ground, each step bringing one closer to death. With death as one’s constant thought, one severs and abandons everything. Though sounds and sights, the splendor of the world’s objects, surround one on every side, the eyes see nothing, the ears hear nothing. Thought after thought is extinguished, and even this body is relinquished—how much more all else. Refining the mind in this way, one sees swift progress, attaining life within death, neither born nor dying. Those newly embarking on the Dao, seeking to escape birth and death, should hold this thought. Human life lasts but an instant; if a single breath fails to come, one is already in the realm of death. Be urgent in applying the mind, diligent in cultivation and advancement. Dispel the ordinary mind entirely, benefit yourself and others, and rescue one another in turn—do not procrastinate.\n\nSomeone asked: If the mind is free from defilement and attachment, and one lives freely and follows conditions, does this accord with the Dao?\nThe answer: To intend freedom from attachment is already to be attached; to intend freedom from defilement is still to be attached to non-defilement. The moment one seeks stillness and concentration, one has already fallen into the root of thought. To indulge freely in dependence on others is also to form heterodox views. Freedom from defilement and attachment are but medicines—when there is no illness, the medicine is removed. If the illness departs but the medicine remains, it ultimately becomes a medicinal illness. Only when the paths of speech and thought are cut off does one truly arrive home. Cease asking about the journey.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao cannot be spoken of—only good and evil can be pointed out. Goodness establishes the unsurpassed cause of transcending the world, where there is heaven but no hell. Evil leads to falling into boundless suffering, where there is hell but no heaven. These two paths arise from delusion and awakening. Awakening brings instantaneous sagehood; delusion brings eternal sinking. Having attained a human body, how can one not reflect on this?\n\nThe Master said: The paths of the ordinary and the sage are the same—only clarity and obscurity set them apart. Clarity makes one a sage; obscurity makes one ordinary. The mind of the ordinary person is unwilling to sever emotions and relinquish attachments, to abandon falsity and remove evil. Drifting with circumstances, turning with passions, one seeks momentary pleasure and accumulates eons of calamity, never reflecting, never awakening.\n\nThe Master said: The practitioner must first understand one’s own fundamental task, then master teaching and transformation. If one does not comprehend one’s own tradition, one is like a person without eyes—unable to distinguish the path, every step is mistaken. If one does not understand teaching and transformation, one is like a sighted person sitting in darkness—prone to partiality and self-view. One must master both to respond perfectly. If one masters neither, one is like a person sitting in great darkness who also has no eyes—when will one ever emerge?\n\nSomeone asked: Daoists often speak of the Golden Elixir—what is it truly?\nThe answer: It is one’s original true nature. Because it is swift, sharp, bright, and clear, transforming and melting, it is called \"gold.\" Having undergone refinement, perfectly complete and indestructible for ten thousand kalpas, it is named \"elixir.\" Its substance is like empty space, inwardly and outwardly radiant and transparent, not a single thread clinging, not a speck of dust defiling. Glittering and shining, it illumines all without limit. Thus the ancestral master said:\n*The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir,\nThe four temporal states are the furnace that refines it into a mass.\nFree from defilement, without thought, cast out delusion,\nNaturally, in a single manifestation, it ascends the immortal’s altar.*\n\nPeople of the world who speak of the Golden Elixir, making it in tangible forms and relating it to passions and desires, hold views of hell—these are the deeds of the licentious and perverse. Their understanding deviates from the human path, and they enter the realm of beasts.\n\nThe Master said: Those who study the Dao should thoroughly investigate and realize the point where one is uninvolved in all affairs, undefiled by any dust, and in communion with heaven and earth. Then one precedes heaven and heaven does not oppose, follows heaven and accords with its timing. If even heaven does not oppose, how much less do people, how much less ghosts and spirits.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the mysterious and wondrous?\nThe answer: Who taught you to ask this?\nThe person joined their hands and said: This disciple conceived the question myself.\nThe answer: If so, then you already understand.\nThe person laughed and bowed.\n\nSomeone asked: What is past is not pursued, what is to come is not anticipated—what of the present?\nThe answer: Extinguish movement but not illumination—further, one must realize who it is that extinguishes movement. Once attained, the power is in your hands: to extinguish or not to extinguish is up to you.\n\nSomeone asked: I do not ask about the mind of the past or future—what is the mind of the present?\nThe Master looked straight ahead and said: This is not the present.\nThen lowered his head and said: This is not the present.\nHe then asked in return: Do you understand?\nThe person laughed and said: I do not.\nThe Master said: With eyes wide open, you do not even understand the present—what more is there to say of past and future?\n\nSomeone asked: What are fortune and misfortune?\nThe answer: Piled wood becomes a forest, piled stones become a mountain, piled water becomes a sea. Piled goodness becomes fortune, piled evil becomes misfortune. The source of fortune and misfortune lies in the mind itself. Only through accumulation do they form—how can one not be cautious?\n\nSomeone asked: What are good and evil?\nThe answer: Every kind thought is good; every unbalanced thought is evil. Goodness unknown to others is great goodness; evil unknown to others is great evil.",

      "translated_text": "To neither think of good nor evil—beyond this lies the higher matter.\n\nSomeone asked: Both Daoists and ordinary people fall ill—how are they different?\nThe answer: Long ago, Master Danyang fell ill, yet physicians could not read his pulse. Master Huqiu sat in stillness, yet diviners could not discern his true nature. Why? When the mind is not attached to things, creation cannot alter it; when nature does not stray from its source, even spirits cannot fathom it. How much less can physicians or fortune-tellers? This is the difference from ordinary people.\n\nThe Master said: If a cultivator’s true eye remains unopened and their perfect mechanism unactivated, merely seeking in others’ footprints or measuring by words and phrases, they will never find the Way. It is like a blind man hearing others speak of the sun and moon’s light—though he imagines it, he never sees it for himself. This is because he has not worked on his own mind.\n\nSomeone asked: In the midst of movement and stillness, how can one be thus?\nThe answer: When the mind is pure and still, even amid bustling crowds and clamor, if matters do not concern you, let the world stir as it will—it is no different from an empty chamber where nothing exists. Yet if you sit alone in a quiet room, as if standing at a crossroads before sages and truths, you dare not entertain the slightest false thought. Thus, neither movement nor stillness hinders you. What further confusion could there be?\n\nSomeone asked: If one harmonizes with the world yet does not cling to things, how is this so?\nThe answer: Heaven is heaven, earth is earth, mountains are mountains, waters are waters, things are things, and I am I. Though mingling with the world, how can they truly cling?\n\nSomeone asked: All forms and shapes differ—how can they be seen as one?\nThe answer: Heaven is the Dao, earth is the Dao, and all things are the Dao. That is the Dao, and this is the Dao. Though forms vary, the Dao is everywhere—how can they not be one?\n\nSomeone asked: People seek joy, yet Daoists embrace hardship—why?\nThe answer: Worldly people know not true joy; they mistake what pleases the heart for joy, led by desire into suffering, taking bitterness for delight. Daily scheming for worldly pleasures, when they fail, sorrow and turmoil afflict the spirit, never at ease—this is true suffering. Those who cultivate the Dao seek no joy; their minds abide in the Dao. Encountering hardship, they do not suffer; without suffering, they are ever joyful, their minds free. Where there is joy, there is suffering; without joy, there is no suffering. A mind beyond joy and suffering—this is true joy.\n\nSomeone asked: How can one escape the cycle of sin and fortune, cause and effect?\nThe answer: Sin and fortune, cause and effect, belong to the shell of yin and yang. If you break free from this shell, they naturally cease to bind you. What is the shell of yin and yang? The moment a trace of selfish desire or malevolence arises in the mind, it belongs to the yin shell; the moment a trace of good intention arises, it belongs to the yang shell. In yin, there is evil retribution; in yang, there is good retribution. But if you refine the mind until it is like empty space—neither good nor evil, with no attachment to govern—then fortune and misfortune cannot touch you, cause and effect cannot grasp you. This is one who has transcended the shell of yin and yang. The layperson, never harboring a single good thought, spends all twelve hours scheming for wealth and gain, living at others’ expense, deceiving and entrapping them, their mind shrouded in ignorance and darkness—how can they escape the shell of yin and yang? They cannot even tread the yang path—how could they break free? To seek freedom from sin and fortune, from cause and effect, is nearly impossible. You have forged your own fate—how can you evade it? Bow your head, close your eyes, and leave it to King Yama to judge.\n\nSomeone asked: What of future rebirth—how does it truly work?\nThe answer: In this life, each person shapes the mold for their next existence. Those who do good forge a good mold; those who do evil forge an evil one. When this body’s allotted time ends and the nature departs its shell, like molten iron poured into a crucible, the Creator casts it into the self-made mold—whether as a human or another being, you reap what you have sown. Does the Creator intend for you to become an animal? Does it intend for you to enter the six realms? No—it is the shell you have crafted in life, from which you cannot escape. This nature gives rise to that form. The cruel become serpents, the miserly become dogs, the lustful and murderous become swine, the greedy and violent become wolves—all such transformations follow this pattern. Between heaven and earth, myriad forms and shapes are endless, all self-created and self-endured. Thus the ancients said: *Become like metal or stone, and you transform into metal or stone; become like water or fire, and you transform into water or fire.* These are trustworthy words. A moment’s lapse in losing the human form may take ten thousand kalpas to recover—why not reflect on this?\n\nSomeone asked: I am now old and cannot study much—pray, speak a word on the supreme, most profound, and wondrous truth.\nThe answer: Let go of your seeking for the supreme, most profound, and wondrous—then you will have it.\n\nSomeone asked: The world’s teachings diverge, each claiming truth and denouncing others. Who is right, and who is heretical?\nThe answer: There are two paths: those who cultivate and those who engage the world. To cultivate the mind until it is as clear as heaven and earth, as bright as the sun and moon, as ceaselessly transforming as the four seasons—able to respond to affairs yet returning to the root—is to ask no further of the higher truth.
