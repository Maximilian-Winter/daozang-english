Seven fascicles.*\n*Source edition: Orthodox Daoist Canon, Supreme Mystery Section.*\n\n---\n\n**Direct Pointers to the Myriad Dharmas Returning to One Source, Fascicle One**\n*Composed by Muchang Chao of Yangshan Daoist Abbey, Jian’an*\n*Compiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren*\n\n### **Wuji (Non-Ultimate)**\nThis is the pure essence of inherent nature—namely, the **Taiji (Supreme Ultimate)**.\nThe true void within being, the nameless origin of heaven and earth.\n\n### **Taiji (Supreme Ultimate)**\nThis is the undifferentiated state of principle and qi—namely, the **Yuanji (Primal Ultimate)**.\nThe wondrous being within non-being, the named mother of the myriad things.\n\n### **Preface to the Wuji-Taiji Diagram**\n**Wuji** signifies that which is \"ultimately without ultimate,\" the true void within non-being.\nBefore the One Origin manifested form, before the Two Qi emerged, there was only emptiness, profound and vacant, still and unmoving.\nThis is the nameless beginning of heaven and earth.\nLater generations forcibly named it *Wuji* or *Taiyi (Great Simplicity)*.\n\nFrom the extremity of stillness, movement arises; from ceaseless movement, qi is born.\nWhen qi and principle intermingle in chaos, the Three Powers (heaven, earth, humanity) take shape, and the Way of transformation is born.\nThis is the named mother of the myriad things—hence, the **Taiji**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* states: *\"The Changes possess the Taiji, which generates the Two Modes.\"*\nThe *Changes* refer to the **Wuji**.\nFrom the Wuji arises the Taiji; from the Taiji arise Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth).\nQian separates into Li (Fire), giving birth to the sun; Kun divides into Kan (Water), giving birth to the moon.\nThe Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams arrayed; yin and yang unite, and male and female are born—thus begins human ethics.\nFrom Li and Zhen (Thunder) to Kan and Dui (Lake), day and night are distinguished, and the four seasons revolve.\nThus, in heaven, images are formed; on earth, shapes take substance.\nThat which congeals without dispersing becomes mountains and peaks; that which flows without stagnation becomes rivers and streams.\nThat which sprouts from the land becomes grasses and trees; that which lurks in marshes and deeps becomes scaled and shelled creatures.\nCrawling things are called \"fur\"; flying things, \"feather.\"\nFrom this, cold and heat alternate, dampness and dryness interact; emotions and artifices intertwine, essences and qi converge.\nAll creatures—whether sentient or insentient—proliferate endlessly.\n\n### **On the Wondrous Being of Wuji**\n**Wuji** is the true void of the **Taiji**.\n**Taiji** is the wondrous being of the **Wuji**.\nThe true void is the origin of inherent nature.\nThe wondrous being is the origin of qi.\nWhen wondrous being first coalesces in chaos, the image of Qian (Heaven) is formed.\nTwo Qian become Kun (Earth); once Qian and Kun are established, human ethics and the myriad things arise—thus is the Way of nature and destiny founded.\nAs for the balancing of the Four Images, the arrangement of the Five Phases, the circulation of the Eight Trigrams, the guidance of the Three Origins, the succession of decline and renewal, the alternation of prosperity and decay—these are merely the flowing and revolving of the two qi of yin and yang.\nYet the fundamental void of the Wuji remains unchanged.\nAbove the Taiji, it is quiescent and formless; below the Two Modes, it does not shift with things.\nThough named *Taiyi (Great Simplicity)*, *Taichu (Great Beginning)*, *Taisu (Great Simplicity)*, or *Taishi (Great Commencement)*, their designations differ, but their Way is one.\n\nHowever, the Taiji receives its mandate from the Wuji; Qian and Kun receive theirs from the Taiji; humans and things receive theirs from Qian and Kun—this is the unbroken continuity.\nIt is not that the Taiji is born outside the Wuji, or that Qian and Kun are born outside the Taiji, or that humans and things are born outside Qian and Kun.\nIt begins with the true void of principle and culminates in the wondrous being of qi.\n\n### **On Wuji and Taiji as Principle and Qi**\n**Wuji** refers to pure principle.\nOnly with this principle does qi arise; when principle and qi intermingle in chaos, this is called the **Taiji**—the named mother of the myriad things.\nWhen the Three Powers are established and the myriad things are born:\nThe principle that equalizes things is called *nature*.\nThe qi that endows things is called *destiny*.\nThe nature and destiny of humans and things are none other than the principle and qi within heaven and earth.\nThe principle and qi within heaven and earth are what humans and things receive as their nature and destiny.\nAt the beginning, principle and qi are indistinct in the Taiji; in the end, heaven and earth are replete with principle and qi.\nPrinciple does not exist alone apart from qi; qi does not stand uniquely apart from principle.\nThat which endures with the Three Powers and the myriad things without end is principle and qi.\nYet the substance of principle is still and formless; the mechanism of qi is dynamic yet formless.\nThat which is still and formless is the **Dao**.\nThat which moves and takes form is the *instrument*.\nIt begins with the Wuji, culminates in the Taiji, divides into the Two Modes, and disperses into the myriad kinds.\nYet principle and qi have never been separate, never ceased, and never increased or diminished.\n\n### **The Source of Nature and Destiny**\nThe Taiji is formless; it first generates the One.\nThe One divides into the numbers of water and fire.\nWhen One and Two pair, the body of Qian is completed—this is the primordial origin of nature and destiny, the wellspring of human ethics and the myriad things.\nThus, Qian is split to form Kun; the Two Modes are established, and the Four Images stand.\nThe Eight Trigrams are arrayed, and day and night alternate.\nFrom the initial division of Qian, nature and destiny diverge.\nThe *Classic of Changes* states: *\"The Way of Qian transforms, each rectifying its nature and destiny.\"*\nBefore the Way of Qian divided, water and fire were inherently complete.\nWhen the Way of Qian transforms and divides to form Kun, the myriad things receive the qi apportioned by Qian and Kun, each rectifying its nature and destiny to be born.\nThis is the descent of Qian’s origin, the flowing of forms into the myriad things.\nThus, that which is complete in Qian is yang; that which is divided in Kun is yin.\nThe establishment of yin enables the myriad things to rely upon it for birth.\nThat which possesses the completeness of Qian is called *nature*; that which receives the division of Kun is called *destiny*.\nReceiving the One of water is *essence*; receiving the Two of fire is *spirit*.\nThat which possesses the completeness of nature, destiny, essence, and spirit is called the **Dao**.\n\n○ Water (One) and fire (Two) combine to form Qian—this is the wondrous self-possession of water and fire within Qian’s origin.\nThe origin of destiny is the beginning of inherent nature.\nWhen One divides into Two, the one body ceases to exist, and the two bodies come into being.\nWhen they unite as One, the one body exists, and the two bodies cease to be.\n\nThis is the mutual transformation of being and non-being. Thus, the Great Dao takes non-being as its essence and being as its function. Therefore, the true non-being of *Wuji* is the *Taiji*, and the wondrous being of *Taiji* is the *Wuji*.\n\nThe inception of Qian was originally non-being, yet through the establishment of the One, an image is formed. The inception of Kun was originally non-being, yet through the division of Qian, a form is shaped. The interplay of division and union, being and non-being—this is the great root of yin, yang, and the myriad things.\n\n○ The primordial Qian, water and fire, yin and yang, nature and destiny, essence and spirit—these are self-contained. Thus, Qian’s nature aligns with the Dao; human nature aligns with Qian. By uniting with Qian and following Kun, nature is perfected and destiny is restored.\n\nQian divides to become Kun; Kun unites to return to Qian. Through the division and union of these two bodies, nature and destiny are made complete. Thus, when Boyang cultivated immortality, the *Cantong Qi* took the *Yi* as its model, declaring that nature and destiny are nothing more than Qian and Kun, and essence and spirit are nothing more than Kan and Li. Yet Qian and Kun, Kan and Li are nothing more than the One. The One is nothing more than the *Taiji*. The *Taiji* is nothing more than the *Wuji*.\n\nBefore the One took form, it was the beginningless beginning of the *Taiji*. Once the One was established, it became the beginning of the *Taiji*. The beginningless is the inception of nature; the beginning is the inception of destiny. When these two beginnings unite, the Dao of Qian is fulfilled.\n\nNature begins in non-being, whence arises the empty and numinous awareness. Destiny begins in being, whence arises the flowing cycle of generation and decay. The opposition of being and non-being, the interplay of movement and stillness—thus is the Dao of transformation established.\n\nYet the one body encompasses two: the body of Qian encompasses Kun. Without awaiting transformation, water and fire, yin and yang are already complete. To unify the *Taiji* and preserve the primordial Qian, to embrace the formless and encompass the two beginnings—this is the work of the sagely origin. To unite form and the origin, encompassing the two beginnings—this is the enterprise of the sage.\n\n**Sequence of Nature, Principle, Spirit, Qi, and Destiny**\nThe Dao precedes the *Taiji* and is called *nature*; nature exists between heaven and earth and is called *principle*; the wondrous awareness of principle is called *spirit*; the empty and numinous spirit unites with *qi*; *qi* bestowed upon things is called *destiny*.\n\nThe *Yi* states: \"That which is quiescent and unmoving is the essence of nature. That which responds and thereby penetrates is the function of spirit.\" Nature extends to all things without exception; principle is impartial toward all things; spirit responds to all things without fail; *qi* accomplishes all things without omission.\n\nThat which is inherently non-active is *nature*; that which is universally possessed by things is *principle*; that which is mysteriously penetrating and wondrously aware is *spirit*; that which ceaselessly moves and flows is *qi*. Rooted in nature, following principle, preserved in spirit, and generated by *qi*—this is *destiny*.\n\n**Diagram of the Ten Thousand Dharmas Returning to the One**\nThe One is the mother of the ten thousand dharmas. Thus, two Ones make Two; two Twos make Four; doubling Four makes Eight; doubling Eight makes Sixteen; combining these yields Thirty-Two; doubling Thirty-Two makes Sixty-Four. Sixty-Four forms Three Hundred Eighty-Four. Excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, the twenty-four remaining yield Three Hundred Sixty, corresponding to one cycle.\n\nThus, Qian’s tally is two hundred sixteen; Kun’s tally is one hundred forty-four. Combined, the tallies of Qian and Kun number fifteen thousand one hundred twenty. Therefore, one number gives rise to one thing; one thing possesses one dharma; within one dharma, further dharmas arise. In sum, they are called the ten thousand.\n\nIn the beginning, names are established upon the One; meanings are established upon names; affairs are established upon meanings; capacities are established upon affairs; offices are established upon capacities; functions are established upon offices; achievements are established upon functions; distinctions are established upon achievements; marvels are established upon distinctions; rightness is established upon marvels; wrongness is established upon rightness.\n\nOnce right and wrong are established, the foolish are distinguished from the wise; obstruction from penetration; excess from scarcity; scarcity from multitude; sameness from difference; equality from gradation; centrality from bias; uprightness from deviance; greatness from smallness; refinement from coarseness. Accumulating and layering these, multiplying them further—from this point onward, even the most skillful reckoning cannot fathom them.\n\nThirty thousand eight hundred names arise according to circumstances, all entangled in the interplay of things and the adaptability of the human mind. How could the beginning of *Wuji* possess such distinctions?\n\nThe wise must gather the ten thousand dharmas into the One, returning to their origin and reverting to their root. Once the One is restored, the ten thousand dharmas revolve back to their source. Thus, the sage unifies them with the One. It is said: though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one. Without unifying them with the One, they would merely be ten thousand upon ten thousand.\n\n**Unifying the Ten Thousand Dharmas**\nAs for the ten thousand dharmas in the world: if the vast ocean were a mouth and the Yellow River a tongue, they could not fully distinguish their right and wrong. If Kunlun were a brush and the azure sky paper, they could not fully describe their conditions.\n\nThe baser the age, the more dharmas mutate; the more cunning people become, the more the Dao diverges. Thus, as soon as the one source stirs, the ten thousand dharmas rush forth in chaos—like rain lashing a thicket, like wind howling through a hundred hollows—tumultuous and clamorous, none knowing how to restrain them.\n\nEven if Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor were to re-establish the laws, or Confucius and Laozi were to discourse again on the profound, they could not suppress the source once set in motion. The multitude of the ten thousand dharmas, their vastness—those who seek to exhaust them with clever schemes only render them unequal, and thus they remain unequal.\n\nWhat unifies them? The One alone. What is the One? It is the convergence of their ultimate and the return to their ultimate. Yet the ten thousand dharmas are empty and illusory; the One, too, arises from delusion. If the One does not move, the ten thousand dharmas do not arise. I shall unify them with the One.\n\nThe ten thousand dharmas are the same as self and other, equal to heaven and earth—how could they not be unified? Those who claim the One cannot be reverted to, or the dharmas cannot be unified, have not awakened to the principle of unification.\n\n**Diagram of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin**\nThe Three Vehicles and Four Fruits of the Buddhist path; the hundred schools and various masters of the Confucian path; the Three Realms and multitude of immortals of the Daoist path—\n\nBuddhism, Confucianism, Daoism: A Parable of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin.\n\nTo govern the world by exhausting principle, none surpasses Confucianism. To transcend life and death, none surpasses Buddhism. To revert to destiny and master the Three Powers, none surpasses Daoism. These three traditions share the same Supreme Ultimate, the same nature and principle, standing like a tripod between China and the barbarian lands, each with education as its core. Their origin is one, their contemplation is one, their embrace of all principles is one—like a city embracing its people, the sea embracing all rivers, a cauldron embracing all flavors, the body embracing its nine orifices, or heaven and earth embracing the ten thousand things.\n\nWhat is prized is stillness, not movement; clarity, not turbidity. In stillness, the ten thousand thoughts do not arise; in movement, the ten thousand mechanisms all activate. In clarity, spirit and illumination gather; in turbidity, stupidity and darkness congeal.\n\nTo govern heaven and earth, to store the ten thousand things, to unite spirit and essence, to harmonize the six qi—all depend on the functioning of the heart-mind. The ancients could not name it, so they gave it a word. With this, they symbolized the Three Powers and the ten thousand dharmas.\n\n*\"Fufu\"*—to be complete within the Infinite is called *nature*; to be divided from the Supreme Ultimate is called *destiny*; what the Dao deems so is called *principle*; to encompass all principles is called the *heart-mind*. The heart-mind, when spoken of in relation to the ten thousand dharmas, is vast in form and empty in substance, wondrously aware and mysteriously penetrating, containing all existence. Originally, it has no names such as good or evil, small or great—it is how humans and things put it to use. That their later applications differ is why later ages differ.\n\nIt is like three brothers born of the same parents who, by misfortune, lose their parents early and drift apart to foreign lands. When they grow up, each inherits a different house and changes his surname. If the lords of these three houses should dispute over land and people, and the three brothers, each wielding absolute wisdom, devise strategies, deploy troops, and command armies, meet on the plains of the Central Kingdom—some attacking from the left, some from the right, some from the center—though their arrows clash and blades cross, none can ultimately subdue the others. Why? Because their strength and wisdom are equal, and victory or defeat is hard to determine.\n\nA discerning person says: \"Once born of the same parents, now they are enemies—what is to be done?\" Though they wish to disband their armies, release their grievances, blend their light, and share the dust, they exhaust their hearts and minds. The heart-mind in heaven is the heart-mind of heaven; on earth, the heart-mind of humanity; in the world, the heart-mind of the world; in the ten thousand things, the heart-mind of the ten thousand things—yet it is but one heart-mind. Abandon the thing, and you grasp its name.\n\nThe heart-mind is originally without constancy, yet by use it becomes constant. The heart-mind is originally without measure, yet by use it takes measure. The heart-mind is originally without movement, yet by use it moves. The heart-mind is originally without thought, yet by use it thinks. Using its goodness makes a good heart-mind; using its evil makes an evil heart-mind; using its smallness makes a small heart-mind; using its greatness makes a great heart-mind. With this heart-mind, one models the enclosing city walls. Thus, we know the heart-mind governs all principles.\n\n**Diagram of Nature, Destiny, and Body in Union: An Explanation**\nNature is the wonder of the primordial spirit. All things equally receive it—its substance is utterly still, utterly empty, utterly mysterious. In the sage it does not increase; in the fool it does not decrease. In antiquity it does not change; in the present it does not shift. The world’s movements cannot move its movement; the world’s ultimacy cannot reach its ultimacy—this is what we call *nature*.\n\nDestiny is the correctness of primordial qi. Qi, in relation to things, is called *destiny* or *command*. The command is for humans to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions. In things, it resides in prosperity or adversity; in principle, it is originally without life or death. The ten thousand things are impermanent—this refers to the division and limits of their physical forms. Yet the primordial destiny never breaks or continues; it moves without being summoned—this is what we call *destiny*.\n\nThe body is the root of the command. It begins without form, takes shape through the causes and conditions of parents, and truly receives heaven and earth’s correct qi. Thus, it models itself on heaven and earth to form its shape: eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue speaks, mind knows, emotions recognize, hands grasp, feet walk—this is what we call the *body*. Without the body, nature and destiny have no place to reside; without nature and destiny, the body has no master. Blended and united, they are called *human*; one who illuminates nature is called *Daoist*.\n\nThose who treasure the body and destiny but not their nature merely lodge their breath in a single thing. Some say: \"The body is impermanent, destiny is limited. If body and destiny do not endure, where does spirit reside?\" I say: This body is a borrowed thing, and in the end it must return. This destiny flows and circulates. Things arise and perish—with a body, they unite to become human; when qi scatters, they return to the Dao. The sage sets the body aside, yet the body remains; the primordial spirit and primordial destiny have never been lost. To seek destiny and nature apart from the body is like seeking fish and dragons outside water, or sun and moon outside heaven.\n\n**The Parable of the Ox-Cart and Treasure: An Explanation of Body, Nature, and Destiny**\nNature is what humans are endowed with—no thing lacks it. The body is humanity’s foundation, the lodging place of nature and destiny. Destiny is the sequence of qi, the source of all arising. Receiving the mandate of heaven to become human is to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions.\n\nWithout destiny, the body cannot establish its root; without the body, destiny has no way to preserve its life. Without body and destiny, nature cannot lodge its numinosity, nor be perfected in goodness. These three cannot be separated from their root even for an instant.\n\nNow, let us borrow a treasure to represent nature, a cart to represent the body, and an ox to represent destiny. The treasure is a precious object; the cart is a vessel for bearing loads; the ox is a creature that carries and moves. If you place the treasure on the cart and then harness the ox to it, as the ox moves, the cart moves, and the treasure is carried upon it. The ox can move but cannot bear loads; the cart can bear loads but cannot move. Though the treasure is precious, without the ox and cart, it cannot be carried.\n\nThus, without the cart, the ox has nothing to transport; without the treasure, the cart has nothing to bear. Therefore, the treasure remains at ease while the ox and cart labor. The cart is a composite thing: it moves along the Way by means of the ox and carries its load by means of the treasure. Without such composition, they cannot serve their functions together. Yet all composites must eventually part, and all that is followed must eventually decay. Like the ox that must die and the cart that must break, they come to their end. Only the treasure, not being composite, endures alone.\n\nFrom this we see that the body’s demise is the constant of all that lives, and destiny’s exhaustion is the constant of all that flows. That which does not perish with body and destiny is only the principle of nature. Failing to illuminate one’s nature is to abandon the treasure and not take it. Ignorant of destiny is to abandon the ox and not harness it. Neglecting the body is to abandon the cart and not use it—until the ox dies, the cart breaks, and the treasure is lost. How lamentable!\n\n**Yin and Yang Take Stillness as Their Master**\n\nThat yang moves and yin is still, that yang is clear and yin is turbid, is known to all. But that stillness is their master is unknown to the world. The substance of the Great Ultimate is fundamentally still; its movement depends on stillness, and only after stillness can it move. Without stillness first, movement cannot follow. Thus, in the Way of the Three Powers, stillness is the master of movement.\n\nMoreover, stillness gives rise to nature, movement gives rise to *qi*; stillness gives rise to benevolence, movement gives rise to wisdom. All things under heaven arise from what movement thus generates. Now, yang moves, but its root must be still; yin is turbid, but its root must be clear. Stillness is the substance of movement, movement the function of stillness. From this we see that stillness is at ease while movement labors, stillness is noble while movement is base. Without stillness, how could the movements of the world be unified? Without clarity, how could the turbidity of the world be illuminated?\n\nThus, the sage takes perfect stillness as the Dao—not because yang is debased and yin exalted, but because it is the beginning of the Great Ultimate. Though heaven moves, it contains stillness within movement; though earth is still, it contains movement within stillness. Without stillness, heaven could not respond to the conditions of the myriad things; without movement, earth could not bring forth the life of the myriad things. Thus, within *qian*, yin at its center forms *li*, the image of the sun; within *kun*, yang at its center forms *kan*, the image of the moon. This shows that yang must take stillness as its substance, and yin must take movement as its foundation.\n\nThe stillness of heaven’s body is why it is ever more firm and strong; the movement of earth’s body is why it ceaselessly generates. Thus, the marvel of heaven and earth lies in their constant response and constant stillness. Yang moving and yin still is the true substance of heaven and earth; yang clear and yin turbid is their true form; yang firm and yin soft is their true principle; yang noble and yin base is their true position.\n\nTheir rising and falling is the ascent and descent of yin and yang; their staying and coming is the alternation of yin and yang; day and night are the brightness and obscurity of yin and yang; cold and heat are the shifting of yin and yang. As for that which fills the space between heaven and earth without change, that which pervades the six directions without alteration, whose end cannot be seen when exhausted, whose beginning cannot be seen when traced, which is utterly still and fundamentally so—this transcends the forms of yin and yang and the *qi* of cold and heat.\n\n**The *Wan* Character and the Wheel Diagram: A Buddhist Explanation**\n\nChen Dunzhai says: This diagram is most wondrous, bridging the profound mysteries of Buddhism to the gateway of Confucianism—something no great spiritual master of the past has ever expounded. The Buddhists inscribe the character *wan* (卍) upon the heart as a symbolic teaching. They call it a wheel, with its two parts intersecting and balancing the four images, aligning with the eight trigrams. Its intersections form warp and weft, beginning and end. At its center, it unites the five phases, the five constants, the five *qi*, and the five precepts. In the sutras, it is the four phrases; in humans, it is the four great elements.\n\nThe mysteries of yin and yang, nature and destiny, Dao and virtue, benevolence and righteousness, spirit and soul, mercury and lead, dragon and tiger, *qian* and *li*, *kun* and *kan*—all are equally contained within it. Its advance is level, its retreat is level; it can proceed forward or backward, accommodate four or five, eight or nine. Vertically it is boundless, horizontally it is boundless; the principles of heaven and humanity are all encompassed within it. Thus, the Buddhists inscribe it upon the heart, symbolizing the Dharma Wheel within, turning without cease.\n\nIts sound is *wan* (万, \"ten thousand\"), signifying that the myriad things arise from this Way. Tracing its root, it is the character *shi* (十, \"ten\"). It begins with one, is completed in five, made whole in ten, and embraces the ten thousand. The *wan* character is the sinuous form of *shi*, embodying the meaning of both curved and straight paths. Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly employs the number ten from beginning to end, signifying the equality of above and below, the interchange of substance and function, with nothing lacking or in excess, nothing high or low—like the wheel-treasure of the wish-fulfilling gem, adorned all around, from which all principles and meanings derive. Its significance is profound, beyond words.\n\n**The Mean, the True Constant, and the Eternal**\n\nThat which neither exceeds nor falls short is called the Mean; that which neither changes nor deviates is called the Constant. The Mean is the supreme norm between the two modes, the supreme principle within the human heart. The Constant is the ultimate existence under heaven, the unchanging norm through all ages.\n\nIn Buddhism, this is called the Eternal; in the teachings of the Most High, it is called the True Constant. The Eternal does not change, embodying the meaning of unceasing flow. The True Constant means no delusion, no alteration. Yao and Shun practiced it in their abdication; Confucius and Mencius transmitted it in their teachings; the Buddha used it to transform the myriad kinds; the Most High employed it to govern the Three Powers—this is the Way.\n\nThe Mean is the ultimate Way of the Confucians; the Eternal is the ultimate Way of the Buddhists; the True Constant is the ultimate Way of the Most High.\n\nThough times differ between ancient and modern, and the Dao rises and falls, its essence remains the same while its applications vary—this is not because the principles ordained by the sages differ. The sages merely employ different teachings to convey the Way of the Supreme Ultimate, which begins in nature and ends in destiny. The establishment of the Three Powers is encompassed by nothing beyond this, and the birth of the myriad things does not exceed it.\n\nThough the Two Modes are vast, the winds and soils vary, and the multitude of beings differ, each receives its nature and destiny to come into being. Though their kinds differ, the Supreme Ultimate has never been other than the same. Thus, the Buddhists employ it to transform the world and return to original nature; the Daoists employ it to transform the world and return to primordial qi; the Confucians employ it to transform the world and return to original destiny. Without nature, the subtlety of the great Dao cannot be illuminated; without qi, the origin of the Supreme Ultimate cannot be manifested; without destiny, the great work of teaching and transformation cannot be carried out. These three—transcending form and instrument, the mother of qi, the rectification of the great ethical order—are the root of heaven and humanity. The Three Powers cannot depart from them even for an instant.\n\nThus, in grasping them, there is essence and function; in attaining them, there is before and after. This is not a matter of excess or deficiency. Tracing their beginning and end, Buddhism is the Dao; the Dao is Confucianism. Yet today, some say that Buddhism’s quiescent extinction is far from human sentiment, that the Dao’s purity and emptiness are insufficient to govern the world, and that Confucianism’s names and principles are insufficient to transcend life and death. These are but partial views, each clinging to one side amid gains and losses. The principle of the sages is one and the same—there is no distinction of depth or shallowness. When applied to the world, it is merely that their teachings differ.\n\nIf one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return to the Constant. The Constant means unchanging; purity is the nature of heaven, and stillness is the nature of earth. The principle of heaven and earth values constancy, and thus it is taken as the One Dao. If heaven were not pure, it could not reach its utmost height and suspend the myriad images. If earth were not still, it could not thicken its depths and bear the myriad things. If its virtue were not constant, heaven could collapse, earth could sink, the sun could grow cold, the moon could turn hot, the four seasons could reverse, and the myriad things could fall into chaos. Only because of its constancy can it remain unchanged through the myriad things, past and present.\n\nMoreover, humans are shaped in the image of heaven and earth, their destiny formed by the union of yin and yang. They receive the subtlety of the one numinous spirit, and should naturally abide in purity and stillness. Yet they are drowned by the turmoil of cares at dawn, entangled by the confusion of love and desire, and thus their constancy is disturbed, their purity muddied, and their stillness set in motion. Therefore, they cannot endure as long as heaven and earth or unite with the great Dao in its truth. If one can truly accord with constancy, unite with purity and stillness, how could heaven and earth not return all their subtlety to them?\n\n*Scripture on Salvation: The Primordial Treasure Pearl of the Origin*\n\nThe Origin is the head of the Great Void and Emptiness. It emerges above the Supreme Ultimate and dwells before the Nine Qi. Its qi descends to become Qian, divides to become Kun, and unites to become humanity. The Three Luminaries, the Five Phases, the Four Seasons, and the Eight Trigrams—none are not established by the mysterious Primordial Three Qi.\n\nAs the *Book of Changes* says: \"Great indeed is the Primal Power of Qian, from which all things receive their beginning.\" This is its source. The Primordial One Qi is utterly pure, utterly still, utterly non-action, utterly refined and unified. It is the ancestor of the myriad ways, the root of the myriad spirits, the head of the myriad transformations, and the foundation of the myriad things. It is originally without name or speech, so the Heavenly Worthy borrows names and words to name and speak of it.\n\nThe Scripture says: The Heavenly Worthy of the Origin suspended a treasure pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the emptiness of the mysterious void, silent and without lingering resonance. This passage of the Scripture is the Heavenly Worthy’s expedient means to guide and transform all beings, each expression having its significance.\n\nThe treasure pearl is the one aperture of the Mysterious Female, the wondrous existence of True Emptiness, the root of water, fire, and the Primal Power of Qian, and the nature and wisdom of the myriad spirits. It dwells within the empty mystery. \"Empty\" signifies that the source has no origin; \"mysterious\" signifies that being arises from non-being. That it is five feet above the earth signifies the round number of the great reckoning of the Five Phases—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—unified as one. Earth, belonging to the center, governs the Four Images of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui. This pearl must be five feet above the earth, neither too high nor too low, signifying that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female first emerges at the head of the Five Phases and finally resides within the Five Qi.\n\nThe Origin ascends and leads the perfected celestial spirits into the treasure pearl, signifying that the subtlety of the One Qi contains and emits the Ten Voids, encompasses the Three Ultimates, enters the minute without fail, and embraces the vast without omission. When humans and celestials look up, they see only a surging movement entering the mouth of the pearl—this signifies that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is the gate of the myriad wonders. The Origin draws all beings with the wondrousness of the One True, entering through this wondrous gate.\n\nOnce within the mouth of the pearl, none know where they are—this signifies that all beings return through this wondrous gate. Thus, their wisdom roams in the formless, and their nature unites with the Great Void, hence the saying \"none know where they are.\" Therefore, when the people of the kingdom beheld the wondrousness of the treasure pearl, they all awakened to the Dao of the Origin. Thus, the toils of the dusty world scattered, and the ground of their minds was wholly restored to levelness.\n\nThe pearl of the mind is vast and great, empty and without form, and the Three Powers and the myriad things all enter it equally. Once the pearl enters into principle, what more is there to say? Thus, it is said, \"The explanation of the Scripture is complete.\" The Origin speaks without speaking, and the assembled perfected ones hear without hearing. Each awakens to the true principle, returns to the root, and reverts to the source—thus it is said, \"The heavens return to their positions.\" Wisdom and nature are subtle and mysterious, neither sound nor form. Those who awaken see the entire Dharma Realm manifest; those who are deluded see not even the tip of a hair. Thus, it is said, \"silent and without lingering resonance.\"\n\nTherefore, the Most High first revealed the subtlety of the treasure pearl to show the traces of the mind, and finally united with the silence without lingering resonance to merge with the emptiness of the void.\n\nThis is the complete embodiment of wondrous existence and true emptiness, the full mechanism of non-non-being. The sages’ intent is profound and subtle, difficult to fathom; they must employ expedient means to reveal it to sentient beings, enabling them to seek and attain it for themselves. Thus, they first enter through the \"pearl-mouth\" in this manner, and the assembled perfected ones, awakening with them, guide humans and devas—all must enter through this gate.\n\nYet sentient beings, though their bodies bear this treasure from ancient times to the present, have never altered; it is not that only the Origin possesses this pearl. Bearing the treasure, they remain lost in their realm, and few find the gate. Moreover, though the myriad dharmas are vast and the myriad teachings extensive, a single pearl suffices to encompass them all. Beyond the pearl, what need is there for scriptures?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Origin enters the pearl, the pearl is the Origin;\nOrigin and pearl are one and the same.\nThe explanation of the Scripture is complete,\nthe myriad dharmas return to the One.\nSight and sound are not alike,\nmerged in the chaos of the Great Ultimate.\n\n**Confucian Four-Line Verse:**\n*The human mind is perilous.*\nFloating and false, never still,\nsusceptible to thoughts that race,\ndrawn into the clamor of desire,\npursuing emotions and things,\never restless and hard to pacify—\nthis is called the human mind.\n\n*The Dao-mind is subtle.*\nEmbodied in perfect stillness,\nprofound and obscure, difficult to discern,\npresent when principle is awakened,\nbeyond the grasp of emotions and measures,\nunattainable by sight or hearing—\nthis is called the Dao-mind.\n\n*Be refined, be unified.*\nFrom peril to subtlety,\nstill the movement, return to quiescence,\nthe human mind and Dao-mind\nreach utmost purity,\nwithout the slightest taint of selfish desire—\nthis is called refinement and unity.\n\n*Hold fast to the center.*\nThe perilous and subtle mind,\nperfected in refinement and unity,\nheld as the daily practice,\naccords with principle in all things,\nfree from the ills of bias or deviation—\nthis is called holding to the center.\n\n**Daoist Four-Line Verse:**\n*Seeing does not perceive the self.*\nInwardly observe the mind—\nthe mind has no mind;\noutwardly observe the form—\nthe form has no form.\nMerged in wondrous emptiness and stillness,\nbeyond the reach of emotions, knowledge, or consciousness—\nthis is called seeing without perceiving the self.\n\n*Hearing does not attain sound.*\nTurn the hearing inward to the self-mind,\nprofoundly empty and still,\nutterly devoid of sound or form,\nas when the Origin, within the treasure pearl,\ncompleted the explanation of the Scripture,\nin an instant—silent, without lingering resonance—\nthis is called hearing without attaining sound.\n\n*Depart from all extremes.*\nFree from heterodox views,\nnot falling into partiality or attachment,\nwithout the ills of excess or deficiency,\ndeparting from all extremes,\nabiding in the center of the utmost center—\nthis is called departing from all extremes.\n\n*Named the wondrous Dao.*\nNo self, no sound,\nno edge, no interior,\nbeyond description,\nuntouched by sound or form,\ntranscending the realm of sight and hearing—\nthis is named the wondrous Dao.\n\n**Buddhist Four-Line Verse:**\n*No reliance on written words.*\nThe mind awakens of itself;\nwords are not the source.\nThe Dao is inherently complete,\nprinciple requires no cultivation or verification—\nhow could it be expressed by teachings?\nThus, it is said: no reliance on written words.\n\n*Direct transmission outside the teachings.*\nLearning from the unlearnable,\nmind to mind, heart to heart,\ngrasping meaning, forgetting words,\ntaking awakening as the rule,\nbeyond the realm of language—\nthis is called direct transmission outside the teachings.\n\n*Directly pointing to the human mind.*\nOnly this mind-essence,\nmost simple, most easy,\nnot by paths or scriptures,\na single awakening instantly reveals the origin—\nthis is called directly pointing to the human mind.\n\n*Seeing nature and becoming Buddha.*\nAwakening to the true nature,\nutterly empty and still,\npenetrating the essence of the original mind,\nwondrously attaining the ultimate principle.\nPrinciple becomes clear and thoroughly understood—\nthus, it is said: seeing nature and becoming Buddha.\n\nAs the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: \"If one were to give away as many bodies as the sands of the Ganges in charity, it would not compare to upholding the four-line verse of this sūtra.\" This means that without realizing the Buddha’s principle, even giving away one’s body and life in charity only yields conditioned merit, whereas receiving and upholding the sūtra’s wondrous teaching leads to seeing nature and becoming Buddha. The \"four lines\" signify the minimal essence. If one penetrates this, there are no more scriptures to read, no more books to study in the world. Thus, for the Three Teachings, these verses distill their essentials, following the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* in naming them the \"Four-Line Verses.\"\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Daoist School: The Myriad Dharmas Return to the One, Fascicle One* – Complete\n*Direct Pointers to the Daoist School: The Myriad Dharmas Return to the One, Fascicle Two*\n\nThe *Yangshan Daoist Abbey of Jian’an*, compiled by Mu Changchao, edited by disciple Yishan Huang Benren, with explanations by Changying and Changjing.\n\nThe celestial body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with sun, moon, clouds, and mist. The earthly body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with rivers, mountains, and the myriad things. The four seasons are fundamentally quiescent, responding with spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The human heart is fundamentally quiescent, responding with joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. Wherever there is quiescence, there is a corresponding response. Quiescence is the host; response is the guest. Quiescence is the lord; response is the minister. Quiescence is the inner substance; response is the outer function. Thus, the heart of the sage is ever unchanging yet responds to the conditions of the myriad things, ever unmoving yet responds to the transformations of the myriad things. Though engaging and responding with the myriad things, this heart never follows them in shifting or moving, and so it becomes the master of the myriad things. Though daily responding to ten thousand affairs, it suffers not the slightest loss—this is how the Most High governs the Three Powers and the myriad things. Constant response and constant quiescence: is this not the supreme virtue of the sage, the true heart of Heaven and Earth? For the scholar, this is the crucial matter of daily practice, and it must not be neglected.\n\n**Explanation of the Chapter \"The Valley Spirit Never Dies\"**\nThe Non-Ultimate is the valley of the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is the valley of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the valley of the myriad things; the human heart is the valley of the host of principles. A valley receives things without ever filling, echoes sound without effort—this is the image of the human heart. *Shen* (spirit) is the supreme principle within Heaven and Earth, the supreme subtlety within the human heart. This spirit, knowing and aware, empty and numinous, responds to the heart as a valley echoes sound. Though the Three Powers may flourish or decline, this spirit never ceases or perishes—hence it is said to \"never die.\" This is called the *Xuanpin* (Mysterious Female). *Xuan* is the primordial image of Heaven and Earth; *pin* is the true quiescent substance. Before the Three Powers were established, before the Four Images arose, the Dao was already complete. It is said, \"There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth\"—this is it. Whether called the Great Ultimate, nature and life, lead and mercury, or water and fire, all are wondrous names for the *Xuanpin*. The gate of the *Xuanpin* is the root of Heaven and Earth. The single aperture of the *Xuanpin* is the root and stem of Qian and Kun. All Dao issues forth from this; the Three Powers are born from this. Some explain it as the coming and going of breath through mouth and nose, the clear and the turbid—this too is the Dao, but it does not grasp the subtlety of the valley spirit.\n\n\"Subtly, subtly existing, its use is never exhausted.\" \"Subtly\" means without end. The valley possesses spirit, unbroken and undying; though the fire of kalpas burns fiercely, it remains unharmed; though the Two Modes transform, it abides forever. If one can employ it without haste or neglect, one may become infinite with the Dao.\n\n**On the Nature School and the Life School as One Body**\nThe world calls Chan learning the Nature School. *Chan* is the Sanskrit *dhyāna*, here translated as \"quiescent contemplation.\" Its foundation is purifying the heart and clarifying the spirit, stilling thoughts and ceasing concerns; its essence is forgetting form and shedding burdens, halting desires and departing from greed. In the body, it is precepts; in the heart, it is concentration; in nature, it is wisdom. The Chan School takes precepts, concentration, and wisdom as its foremost principle.\n\n*Ming* (life) is the primordial life within the chaotic Great Ultimate. Its foundation is non-action and naturalness, wondrous being and pure emptiness; its essence is concentrating qi to attain softness, embracing the origin and guarding the One. In the kidneys, it is essence; in the body, it is qi; in the heart, it is spirit. The Life School takes essence, qi, and spirit as its foremost principle.\n\nPrecepts, concentration, and wisdom are none other than essence, qi, and spirit. Precepts nurture essence; concentration nurtures qi; wisdom nurtures spirit. Without precepts, concentration cannot arise; without concentration, wisdom cannot arise. Without precepts, essence is lost; without concentration, qi scatters; without wisdom, spirit withers. Thus, precepts, concentration, and wisdom are established through essence, qi, and spirit, while essence, qi, and spirit are perfected through precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The sages of the Three Teachings could not depart from these six words to accomplish the Dao.\n\nNow, those who study Buddhism say, \"Originally, there is not a single thing—what use are essence, qi, and spirit?\" Those who study Daoism say, \"I preserve essence, qi, and spirit—why need precepts, concentration, and wisdom?\" Both fail to understand the root, making reckless distinctions. Thus, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who succeed are as rare as unicorn horns. How lamentable!\n\n**Explication of the *Vajracchedikā-sūtra*: The Principle of the One Composite Phenomenon**\n\nThat which possesses composite phenomena comprises the myriad things of Heaven and Earth. The composite of the formless is the nature and principle of the Tathāgata. The myriad composites cannot escape the bounds of bodily life. The composite of yin-yang and nature-principle does not transcend True Emptiness and Wondrous Being.\n\nWhat is called the principle of the one composite phenomenon: *phenomena* (相) refers to affairs and things; *principle* (理) refers to nature and principle. All things—whether in form, appearance, qi, or substance—abiding between Heaven and Earth, are without exception bound by number and accord with principle. Even the creatures that fly and crawl, the sentient and the insensate—what can escape the one composite phenomenon?\n\nThus, the Tathāgata’s teachings necessarily proceed from the phenomenal to the formless. All sentient beings must first grasp phenomena before principle is revealed. Without phenomena, the principle of True Emptiness cannot be illuminated; without principle, the mechanism of Wondrous Being cannot be activated. Therefore, phenomena elucidate principle, and principle unites with phenomena, so that beings may realize \"form is emptiness\" and \"mind is Buddha.\"\n\nThe sūtra states: \"The Tathāgata speaks of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds as not truly worlds, yet names them worlds.\" The explication: This describes Heaven and Earth as one composite phenomenon, vast as the world itself. Before the Great Ultimate took form, there was no such world; after the primordial mass divided, it was named \"world.\"\n\nThe sūtra states: \"If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon.\" The explication: In the beginning, there was no composite form; the present world’s existence is but a composite phenomenon. For Heaven and Earth unite, sun and moon unite, yin and yang unite, male and female unite—what need to speak of the rest? This is called the one composite phenomenon.\n\nThe explication: The Tathāgata’s true nature is originally without name or form; it merely employs provisional means to approach reality, borrowing the existent to reveal the nonexistent, and in accord with the world, names it the one composite phenomenon. Yet this one composite phenomenon is inexpressible.\n\nThe explication: This one composite is the union of True Emptiness and Wondrous Being, the union of sentient beings and Buddha-nature. Laozi’s \"spirit and form both wondrous\" refers to this. A thousand sages do not transmit it, hence it is called \"inexpressible.\"\n\nBut ordinary beings cling to its phenomenal aspect. Failing to comprehend Buddha-nature, they unite only with the world’s dust, toil, and afflictions, insatiably craving and clinging to phenomena, deludedly attached to every affair. Unable to awaken, they cause the single numinous true nature to drift through birth and death, entering and emerging, veiling and returning—all due to clinging to phenomena.\n\nThe explications of various sūtras differ from the Tathāgata’s intent, leading to errors. The sūtra clearly states: \"If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon,\" revealing the union of form and qi. Yet it also refutes this, saying: \"It is not truly a composite phenomenon,\" thereby illuminating the union of nature and principle. This humble explication of half a chapter is offered to clarify the matter for later learners.\n\n---\n\n**Explication of Laozi’s \"Valuing Life\" Chapter**\n\nThe sūtra states: \"Emerging into life, entering death. Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen. As people live, their actions lead them to the realm of death—also thirteen.\"\n\nThe explication: Life is like the sun’s rising; death, like its setting. Zhuangzi said: \"Death and life are like night and day\"—this is the meaning. The \"thirteen\" comprise the twelve stages of long life, bathing, crowning, approaching office, imperial flourishing, decline, illness, death, the grave, the womb, the embryo, and nurturing—together with one’s own body, making thirteen.\n\nAll things follow the Way of beginning and ending, the principle of yin and yang’s ebb and return. The cycles of flourishing, decline, death, and rebirth in beings and things are represented in the *Book of Changes* by *Fu* (Return) in the Kun hexagram and *Gou* (Encounter) in the Qian hexagram. The waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of cold and heat, the endless transformations of creation—all follow this pattern.\n\nAll who follow life must proceed through these stages to live, and through them to die. Now, those whose actions lead them to the realm of death—even the traces of their flourishing, decline, preservation, and demise—cannot escape these thirteen stages. Who can escape this number? Only the sage, perhaps. The Buddhist \"birth, aging, sickness, death\" also derive from this. Is not the \"veiling and returning\" of which they speak these thirteen stages?\n\nThe sūtra asks: \"Why is this so?\" Because of the thickness of their attachment to life.\n\nThe explanation: All things are without birth, and thus attain freedom from death. Once there is birth, there must be death; once there is death, there must be birth—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven and Earth. Those who cannot escape the afflictions of these thirteen stages do so because the desire for life among the myriad things never ceases. Having deeply attached themselves to existence, how can they avoid death?\n\nThe Venerable Lord, fearing that the world would not understand the principle of emerging into life and entering into death, posed the question: \"Why is this so?\" He then answered himself: \"Because their pursuit of the Way of life is too fervent, and they cannot reach the realm beyond death, thus remaining bound to the thirteen stages of birth and death.\" If one wishes to no longer associate with these stages, one must step beyond the cycles of the Five Phases and the bounds of life and death.\n\nThe sūtra states: Those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without avoiding rhinoceroses or tigers; they enter battle without shunning armor or weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to set its claws, and weapons no place to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they dwell in no realm of death.\n\nThe exposition states: Since one is deeply devoted to the preservation of life, one should master the arts of nurturing and safeguarding life, follow the natural cycles of vitality, flourishing, decline, and decay, and comprehend the mechanism of emerging into life and entering into death. Cultivate the body, nourish the qi, secure the essence, preserve the spirit, diminish worldly cleverness, and cast aside cravings and desires. Thus, the seven emotions will not stir within, nor will the six sensory realms disturb without. One does not rush about in the arena of fame and profit—hence, when traveling on land, one does not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers. One does not enter perilous states nor dwell in chaotic realms; one does not indulge bodily desires nor invite misfortune—thus, when entering battle, one does not shun armor or weapons. Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life must purify the mind and conceal its depths, forgetting both things and form. This ensures that the rhinoceroses and tigers of the six desires find no place to thrust their horns or set their claws, and the blades of the three poisons have no ground to lodge their edges. When both spirit and form attain subtlety and merge with the Dao in truth, it is said there is no realm of death.\n\nIt is further said: The sage can transcend the physical form and does not consort with the thirteen stages, so external things cannot harm them, nor can the world bring them affliction. Laozi said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would there be?\" Precisely because one has no attachment to the body can one dwell in no realm of death. Various schools interpret the thirteen stages differently—some as the nine orifices and four limbs, the seven emotions and six desires, others as the six waters and seven fires, or the six senses, four great elements, and three poisons—yet these do not align with the purport of the scripture. Here, this is specifically explicated to illuminate the path for later learners. It is like an infant who has not yet learned to smile...\n\nThe infant is one who has not yet emerged from the womb. Emerging from the womb is called \"child.\" While in the mother’s belly, the infant embraces only a single mass of harmonious *qi*. The emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen; the faculties of perception, hearing, knowing, and awareness have not yet sprouted. Upon leaving the mother’s womb, these emotions and faculties awaken—thus, they are no longer fit to serve as metaphors for the Dao.\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"nurturing the pearl of the child\" and \"preserving the great harmony.\" They also spoke of the \"sacred embryo,\" the \"embryo of the Dao,\" \"embryonic breathing,\" and \"embryonic immortality\"—never once did they speak of emerging from the womb. Among the cultivation methods of the Three Teachings’ sages and worthies, none surpass this. Laozi embraced the origin and guarded the One, concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness. The quietude of Śākyamuni and Yanzi’s \"sitting in forgetfulness\" are but the state of the infant.\n\nWithin the Two Poles, the \"Non-Pole\" is the center within the centerless, while the \"Great Pole\" is the ultimate center. Motionless and quiescent, it is the primordial *qi* that governs all creatures. It cannot be described in form, for it knows no bias, no excess, no deficiency—it is the inception of the *qi* of Qian, the root of the myriad things. Though the names of the poles differ, their center remains the same. The Three Powers and the ten thousand things cannot depart from this center even for an instant. As for the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this center—in Confucianism, is called \"refining essence and unifying\"; it is also called \"preserving spirit.\" In Daoism, it is called \"embracing the origin\" or \"guarding the One.\" In Buddhism, it is called \"dhyāna\" or \"quiescent contemplation.\" All are the inherent center of the human heart.\n\nWhen one’s inherent center aligns with the natural center of the Two Poles, heaven, earth, things, and self become one body. Once things and self share the same origin, and the center is quiescent, there is no arising or ceasing, no flowing or stagnation, no coming or going, no bias or deviation. Thus, one may equalize the myriad things, unify life and death, and stand in the ultimate center.\n\n**On Sitting in Forgetfulness**\n\"Sitting\" means halting movement; \"forgetting\" means stilling thoughts. Without sitting, one cannot cease activity; without forgetting, one cannot quiet contemplation. If activity does not cease, the spirit cannot be tranquil. If thoughts do not still, the heart cannot be at peace. Without halting bodily action and quieting mental activity, this Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThus, the ancients established the two methods of *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation) to remedy the illnesses of distraction and dullness. *Zhi* halts distraction, returning it to samādhi. *Guan* observes dullness, restoring it to wisdom. Without the power of samādhi, one cannot halt distraction; without introspection, one cannot illuminate dullness. The superior practitioners of old all sought the Dao through this path. Thus, Yan Hui relaxed his limbs, subdued his brilliance, departed from form, and abandoned knowledge to await the great penetration. Ziqin leaned on his armrest and sat, losing his sense of self. Mingdao sat as still as a clay statue. Master Xu said: \"Abide in quiescent concentration, free from stray thoughts.\" Guangchengzi said: \"See not, hear not—embrace the spirit in stillness.\" The Queen Mother of the West said: \"Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence.\" On Spirit Mountain for six years, in Shaoshi for nine—some never rested their ribs on the mat, never rose from their seat, their bodies and minds unmoving, entering the great quiescence. In the Buddhist tradition, such examples are countless, yet all involve halting distraction and illuminating dullness.\n\nWithout the cultivation of sitting, how can the sacred embryo be perfected? Only when the great matter of samādhi and wisdom is clarified can one roam freely at will. If the matter remains unclear, sitting should not be abandoned. Yet mere dull sitting, like a block of wood, is called the \"ghostly cave of black mountains\"—outward stillness concealing inner agitation, termed \"sitting in distraction.\" This is not what is meant by sitting in forgetfulness.\n\n**On Subduing the Heart-Mind**\nThe human heart-mind is most cunning and perilous, easily swayed. In an instant, it traverses the ten thousand things. Its greed is like that of tigers, wolves, eagles, and hawks; its venom like that of vipers, scorpions, and serpents. If unleashed, it gallops like ten thousand steeds in the wind; if indulged, it leaps like a troop of monkeys in the trees. Its weapons are like spears, swords, and halberds; its schemes like nets, hooks, and awls. It finds no satisfaction in a thousand measures of wealth and rank, no glory in dwelling in nine-tiered pavilions. The hearts of all things may be fathomed, but the human heart-mind cannot.\n\nHow, then, is it to be subdued? First, one must know contentment; then, apply restraint like poison. Curb its indulgence, rein in its dissipation. Disperse its weapons, cast aside its nets. Forget riches and honor, unify its scattered impulses. Quiet its thoughts, sever its attachments and resentments. Let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight lie dormant, unexpressed. Still the dreams of delusion, distance them in silence. Let the six desires not arise, the seven emotions not entangle. Let all worldly principles, affairs, and realms pass without clinging—like the moon resting on still water, clouds dispersing in the vast sky, effortless and natural, thus and unmoving.\n\nOnly then can it be subdued—like external enemies surrendering to the Middle Kingdom, like ministers submitting to their sovereign. Thereafter, danger and safety are secured, armor is cast aside, weapons laid down. The six desires do not arise, the three poisons vanish—this heart-mind is the great peace of the world.\n\n**Inscription on the Right of Yangshan’s Meditation Chamber**\nThe dark clouds disperse...\n\nThen prajñā—compassion saves all beings.\nDeluded, it is ignorance; awakened, the moon of wisdom flows through empty space.\nCompassion and loving-kindness,\nthroughout the twelve

true Dao is not transmitted.\nThe arts of the world may be transmitted, but the Dao cannot.\nTechniques may be spoken, but the Dao cannot be spoken.\nLao Jun said: “The Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the enduring name.”\nThe Dao is originally without pattern—what words can speak it?\nThe Dao is originally empty and still—what thing can transmit it?\nOne must first realize it in the heart,\nthen use the master’s teachings to verify one’s awakening.\nWhen words and deeds align, the master has guided me.\nThe master is a signpost.\nIf the multitude do not follow the Way, it is not the signpost’s fault.\nThe master can affirm right and wrong,\nbut cannot make others attain the Dao.\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says:\n“If one claims the Tathāgata liberates sentient beings,\nthen one clings to the marks of self, person, sentient being, and lifespan.”\nThe nature of sentient beings is originally complete and perfect;\nI merely awaken them,\nenabling them to understand the principle and liberate themselves.\nIf one claims, “I can liberate them,”\nthen one is attached to worldly names and forms.\n\nLao Jun also said:\n“The true and constant Dao is realized by those who awaken to it.”\nHe never claimed to be able to liberate others.\n\nModern scholars chase the strange and admire the bizarre,\nclaiming this one can project spirit, that one can commune with sages,\nsome see hell, others roam heaven,\nsome say spirits converse with them, others dream of ghostly omens.\nThey delude people with fortune and misfortune,\ndeceive them with auspice and calamity.\nFasting is called “observing the night,”\ndrinking wine and eating meat “nurturing essence,”\nhunching the back and drooping the head “sitting in the circle.”\nDelusion is called “meditation,”\ninversion is called “Buddhahood.”\nCounting breaths is called “life,”\nrecognizing spirit is called “nature.”\nThere are even those who go naked, bare their bodies,\npractice qi-ingestion, harvest yin and yang,\nplay with the primordial womb, indulge in filth and debauchery,\nor engage in depravity—\ncalling what cannot be questioned “secret.”\nThey bow and kowtow, calling themselves disciples.\nThe list is endless.\n\nGood teachers do not indulge the strange.\nThey meet such things without reverence,\nspeak of them without affection,\npoint out flaws and reject impurities,\npublicly exposing and refuting them.\nAlas! Is the world one that favors falsehood over truth?\n\nWhat can be transmitted of the Dao is merely technique.\nWhat can be grasped of the heart is also delusion.\nThose who do not realize it within but seek it outside\ndo not attain the true Dao.\nThus it is said: techniques may be transmitted.\n\n**On Uprightness and Domestication**\n\nHumans are born—\ntheir form must be upright.\nDomesticated animals are born—\ntheir form must be horizontal.\nThe upright resemble the form of Heaven and Earth.\nThe horizontal reverse the form of Heaven and Earth.\nThose who resemble Heaven and Earth in form\nfollow the nature and disposition of Heaven and Earth.\nThose who reverse the form of Heaven and Earth\nserve the uses of human ways.\n\nAll creatures with feathers, scales, or shells\nare horizontal in body.\nThose horizontal in body are horizontal in nature.\nWolves, tigers, eagles, owls, vipers, pythons, and dragons—\nthese are the fierce, greedy, and wrathful kinds in the world.\n\nHumans, however, stand with heads upright and feet square,\nbacks broad and bellies ample,\nadorned with virtue and power,\ngirded with benevolence and righteousness,\nthus honored above all creatures.\nTo stand upright in body is to stand upright in the Dao.\nThus they govern the heart with uprightness,\ngovern the people with uprightness,\nserve the ruler with uprightness.\nAmong the Three Powers, the upright are sovereign.\n\nIn the word “three,” the upright stroke is paramount.\nConfucius said: “Humans are born upright.”\nAll who stand upright in body and heart are human.\nAll who are horizontal in body and heart are beasts.\nFew in the world do not make their bodies and hearts horizontal.\n\n**On Grafting Trees**\n\nThere are countless trees with flowers and fruits,\nyet their colors cannot delight the eye,\ntheir flavors cannot please the mouth—\nthese are ordinary trees.\nYet even they may be transformed through grafting.\n\nWhen the first buds sprout,\nthe skilled artisan prunes away the common shoots,\ngrafts on fine branches,\nbinds them with grass,\nsecures them with mud,\nthen lets the seasonal winds blow upon them,\nand the nourishing rains moisten them.\nNew shoots then grow from the old stems.\nWhat was once sour and bitter becomes sweet and fragrant.\nOrdinary wood becomes extraordinary blossoms—\ncolors to delight the eye, flavors to please the mouth.\nAll rejoice in their beauty and savor their fruits.\n\nFrom this we see: to say human nature cannot be changed is wrong.\nWhen the first stirrings of thought arise,\nprune away the evil impulses,\nreplace them with fine intentions,\nshield them with the grass of patience,\nsecure them with the soil of trust,\nlet the harmonious winds blow upon them,\nbathe them in the rains of wisdom.\nThen good plans will grow,\nevil thoughts will cease.\nWhat was once perverse and obsequious becomes upright and just.\nWhat was false and deceptive becomes sincere and trustworthy.\nWisdom’s flowers bloom,\ntrue fruits ripen.\nAll admire their ability and praise their resolve.\n\nTo say nature cannot be changed,\nevil cannot be turned—\nare these not the words of beasts?\n\nObserving grafting, I grasped the principle of cutting away evil and cultivating goodness,\nthus I wrote *On Grafting Trees*.\n\n**Diagram of the Three Bodies Sharing One Root**\n\nThe Dao divides into the functions of the three bodies.\n\nThe Principle Unites in the One True Origin: An Explanation of the Three Bodies Sharing One Root\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One, the One pairs into Two, which is named Qian. Thus the Three Powers begin. The ancients established images necessarily embodying the primordial Qian.\n\nThe Dao has Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Great Clarity; Buddhism has the Dharma Body, the Reward Body, and the Transformation Body; Śākyamuni has Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra; Amitābha has Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. This is the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate containing the Three.\n\nThe Three are the primordial Qian. Qian corresponds to Metal, thus the Dao speaks of the Golden Elixir, the Golden Tripod, the Golden Duke. Buddhism speaks of the Vajra, the Golden Immortal, the Golden Form. All that is called \"gold\" symbolizes Qian.\n\nLet us take one Buddha as an example—other principles may be inferred without being stated. Amitābha’s Avalokiteśvara wears white, while Mahāsthāmaprāpta wears blue-green. Blue-green is the color of the eastern dawn; white is the color of the West. Blue-green corresponds to Wood, symbolizing the image of compassionate teaching and nurturing sentient beings. White corresponds to Metal, symbolizing the image of wisdom and awakening sentient beings.\n\nThe Buddha stands at the center, hands empty and raised high and low, symbolizing virtue uniting with Heaven and Earth in non-action. The two attendants each hold something, symbolizing the meaning of transformative action. They stand upon lotus flowers, symbolizing purity and unstainedness. Their fingers necessarily hold to the center, symbolizing that holding to the center is the Dao. Their robes are necessarily pure red, symbolizing Yang. Their forms are necessarily firm as gold, symbolizing hardness. Their feet are necessarily bare, symbolizing departure from the dust.\n\nThe rest may be known without being spoken.\n\nThe body of the Dao is empty and quiescent, originally without form or color—seen but not visible, heard but not audible. Yet both Buddhism and Daoism show people these limited images. In principle, is this not mistaken?\n\nAlas! The sages have grown distant, and the source and flow have diverged ever further.\n\nShould images not be employed, how could later generations be guided toward what is to come? This was the ancients’ expedient, born of necessity. Truly, to behold a borrowed form and thereby contemplate the ancient Dao is one gateway to faith.\n\nYet while establishing images and instituting teachings inevitably involves artifice, the heart of the sage has never differed. The true essence lies beyond form, and thus is not easily spoken of. When unified, the ten thousand differences share a single root; when dispersed, the single root becomes ten thousand differences. In awakening, one body encompasses the Three; in delusion, the Three bodies remain divided.\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* speaks of the three minds that cannot be attained:\nThe past mind cannot be attained,\nthe present mind cannot be attained,\nthe future mind cannot be attained.\n\nThese three minds—when applied to what has gone before, they are the past; when applied to the present, they are the now; when applied to what comes after, they are the future. Or again: the thought just extinguished is the past, the thought now arising is the present, the thought yet to arise is the future. Though the times of the three realms differ, the principle underlying them remains unchanged.\n\nThe mind of the sage is eternally one. It does not age with the passing of high antiquity, nor does it grow weary in the present, nor vanish in the time to come. It is not altered by affairs or things, nor does it shift with past or present. Employed to govern the world, to teach and nurture all beings, and to harmonize with the four seasons—though it may manifest in emotion and take form in action—it never clings to anything.\n\nObserve its beginning: still and unmoving.\nExamine it now: vast and without action.\nGaze upon its end: boundless and without limit.\n\nWhen it transforms the multitude of beings, none know its virtue. When it is applied to the world, none reward its merit. It does not seek fame in the past, form in the present, or dharma in the future. Thus it is said to be unattainable.\n\nThe Diagram of Six Correspondences\nThe Meaning of the Six Correspondences\n\nWisdom stands opposite ignorance: when awakened, ignorance becomes wisdom; when deluded, wisdom becomes ignorance. Buddha-nature stands opposite sentient beings: when deluded, Buddha-nature becomes sentient beings; when awakened, sentient beings become Buddha-nature. Afflictions stand opposite bodhi: when awakened, afflictions become bodhi; when deluded, bodhi becomes afflictions. Joy stands opposite anger: when awakened, anger becomes joy; when deluded, joy becomes anger. Self-interest stands opposite benevolence and righteousness: when awakened, self-interest becomes benevolence and righteousness; when deluded, benevolence and righteousness become self-interest. Delusion stands opposite truth: when awakened, delusion becomes truth; when deluded, truth becomes delusion.\n\nThe meanings of all these pairings above are rooted in mutual transformation—body and function interchange, beginning and end alternate. From the utmost sagely to the utmost foolish, none are without this shared essence. These six pairings are like water and boiling water: fundamentally the same yet functionally distinct. When boiling water cools, it returns to water; when water heats, it becomes boiling water again. The two interpenetrate, indistinguishable, differing only in cold and heat.\n\nNow, boiling water is but water transformed—just as ignorance is but the presence of wisdom. Now, water is but boiling water transformed—just as Buddha-nature is but the presence of sentient beings. Boiling water does not depart from water, nor water from boiling water—just as the six pairings do not depart from their opposites. Thus, when ignorance arises, wisdom is extinguished; when sentient beings are deluded, Buddha-nature is extinguished; when delusion arises, truth is extinguished; when anger arises, joy is extinguished; when afflictions arise, bodhi is extinguished; when self-interest arises, benevolence and righteousness are extinguished. It is like when boiling water arises, the nature of water is extinguished, and when water arises, the nature of boiling water is extinguished. Though they mutually give rise to and extinguish one another, their fundamental nature was never different.\n\nAnger and joy are not two separate natures—anger does not depart so that joy may arise again. The two are but a single principle. It is like a single rod: one end is anger, the other joy—used as one’s hand turns it. Just as water, when heated, becomes boiling water, and boiling water, when cooled, returns to water, so too are the six pairings of the same principle. To seek Buddha-nature apart from sentient beings, to seek wisdom apart from ignorance, to seek bodhi apart from afflictions—this is fundamentally impossible.\n\n**On the Golden Elixir and Nature-Life**\n\nSomeone asked about the categories of the Golden Elixir and nature-life.\n\nQuestion: The alchemical classics abound with metaphors—thousands of chapters and ten thousand discourses. As a beginner, I cannot fathom their direct meaning. I beg for a single word of instruction.\n\nAnswer: When the five qi are not errant, the five emotions do not arise, the five flavors are not coveted, desires do not taint, the six roots are purified, and the square inch of the heart is limpid and clear—this is the true elixir. This method is the most direct.\n\nQuestion: What is the method for refining the two true elixirs?\n\nAnswer: Cut off worldly affairs, sit in silent meditation, subdue the Azure Dragon, tame the White Tiger, extinguish the Vermilion Bird, still the Dark Warrior, guard the Curved Array, keep the five weapons unused, and pacify the eight directions—such is the elixir method.\n\nQuestion: Is this something everyone can achieve?\n\nAnswer: Though it is so, one must first reach this state to call it \"readily available.\" Without attaining this essential point, one cannot speak of it as \"readily available.\"\n\nQuestion: Are true lead, true mercury, true water, and true fire actual substances, or are they metaphors among ten thousand words?\n\nAnswer: The Dao is not sought from without; seeking it externally is not the great Dao. True lead and mercury are the root and origin of heaven and earth. True water and fire are the fundamental ancestors of yin and yang. Mercury and lead within humans are nature and life; water and fire within humans are spirit and qi—not actual substances in the world. The ancients did not wish to reveal it directly, so they spoke of it in ten thousand words through things, guiding people to seek afar and near, to match the yin and yang beyond forms with the spirit and qi within the body. Apart from one’s original destiny and primordial spirit, all else—crucibles, vessels, medicines, dragons, tigers, tortoises, snakes, and all things with form in the world—are but metaphors.\n\nQuestion: It is said that one sets up altars and oratories, establishes furnaces and crucibles, models the patterns of yin and yang, refines worldly medicines, and upon completion of the elixir, consumes it to ascend and attain longevity. Is this true or not?\n\nAnswer: In the Returning Elixir, the body is the furnace, the heart is the crucible, non-thought is the method, gathering emptiness is the medicine, refining it with the fire of spirit, tempering it with the water of nature, and merging them in an instant—this is the wonder of ingestion. Persisting thus over time, one firmly attains immortality. Refining worldly, common medicines wastes wealth and exhausts strength. Many emperors and heroes of past ages were deceived by alchemists—ten thousand times none succeeded.\n\nQuestion: Yet in famous mountains and grottoes, there remain furnaces and crucibles for elixirs. Were the ancients all mistaken?\n\nAnswer: The perfected ones established furnaces and crucibles externally to refine common medicines and internally to refine the elixir of the heart. They followed the hours of day and night, practicing civil and martial methods, adding and withdrawing, borrowing the work of the external furnace to regulate the movements of the inner heart. If the inner heart does not slacken, the external fire does not err; if the inner heart slackens, the external work is lost. Externally, they guarded the furnace and crucible; internally, they circulated Kan and Li. When the inner elixir was achieved, the external medicine also formed—consuming it, how could one not ascend?\n\nToday, people know only how to refine external medicines but do not understand the inner elixir. The six roots are not purified, the three poisons are not extinguished, concentration and wisdom do not arise, deluded thoughts are not eliminated, Kan and Li do not merge, mercury and lead do not congeal. Even with external medicine, the immortal path remains but a dream.\n\nQuestion: Having understood the medicine, one must clarify the firing process. How does the medicine congeal? How is the firing process applied?\n\nAnswer: When essence, qi, and spirit interact, and the heart, intent, and consciousness are unmoving—this is the congealing of the elixir. The silent circulation of Kan and Li through the twelve hours, without stray thoughts—this is the firing process. If one does not apply effort at the proper time, the firing process is lost. If one’s spirit and qi are agitated at the proper time, the great medicine is without effect.\n\nShould one know the medicine yet remain ignorant of the firing process, all effort is in vain.\n\n**Question:** In the practice of refinement, must one follow the seasonal nodes, align with the hexagrams’ qi, and adhere to the hours?\n**Answer:** True fire has no fixed timing; the great medicine has no set method. The ancients established seasonal nodes and hexagram qi merely to clarify yin and yang, recognize their images and numbers, and verify the hours—so that one might then act accordingly, ensuring that this essence, this qi, this spirit, this heart align with the celestial mechanism, correspond to the hexagram images, and do not contradict them. If the celestial Way’s timing is lost, yin and yang fall into disorder, and wind and rain lose their season. If the human heart stirs recklessly at the proper hour, the firing process is lost, and the elixir path remains unfulfilled. One must align moment by moment with the workings of creation, harmonizing the Five Phases. Thus, hexagrams and hours are established as a standard for the human heart.\n\n**Question:** May I hear of the civil and martial firing methods—advancing and withdrawing the fire?\n**Answer:** The firing process is most wondrous, a secret not transmitted even by a thousand sages. Speaking roughly, it is nothing more than harmonizing metal and fire. Metal is lead; fire is mercury. Lead is the dark; mercury is spirit. Spirit is nature; qi is life. When nature and life merge, metal and fire blend their radiance, and the elixir path is achieved. If the fire is too martial, it scorches; if too civil, it overflows. The key is neither to scorch with martial fire nor to overflow with civil fire. When behind, withdraw; when ahead, add. At the beginning, advance; at the end, retreat. Maintain it as if ceaselessly present, warm and balanced. It is like tuning a zither: if the strings are too tight, they snap; if too loose, they do not sound. Neither tight nor loose, they respond to the touch and produce music. The firing process is no different.\n\n**Question:** After the ten-month gestation of the sacred embryo, should one continue to apply fire?\n**Answer:** It is like smelting gold ore: once refined into gold, it is not returned to the ore. Firm, luminous, and pure, its nature does not change—this is called the indestructible vajra body. At this stage, one rests in great stillness. Though no fire is added, neither is it withdrawn. Abiding in silent radiance, ceaselessly present yet effortless in application—like a fish drinking water, one knows its warmth or coolness for oneself.\n\n**Question:** Is the completion of the sacred embryo the final attainment?\n**Answer:** When the embryo is perfected in ten months, it is like forging a single whole. To reach final attainment, one must shatter that whole, ascend into formlessness, and depart from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.\n\n**Question:** The *Cantong Qi* of Boyang and the *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* were composed in accordance with the *Book of Changes*, their language archaic and meaning profound, making their ultimate purport difficult to fathom. Are there simpler teachings beyond these?\n**Answer:** The immortals feared that if the world obtained the Way too easily, they would lose it just as easily. Thus, they borrowed the images of the *Changes* to elucidate it. Humans, shaped in the likeness of heaven and earth, follow the Way of heaven and earth. If one understands the *Changes*, then the Way of heaven and earth resides in one’s heart. The simplest of all is nature and life. Nature is the true non-being of the Supreme Ultimate; life is the wondrous being of the Ultimateless. The Confucians’ five carts of texts, the Buddhists’ three treasuries, and the hundreds of thousands of alchemical scriptures cannot surpass this.\n\n**Question:** Beyond nature and life, is there a further mystery?\n**Answer:** The heart. The heart is the palace of spirit, the lord of essence, the commander of qi. When the heart is still, spirit abides; when the heart is unified, essence is unified; when the heart is settled, qi is settled. When the heart stirs, a hundred thoughts arise; when the heart is still, ten thousand conditions cease. In its vastness, it fills the Two Modes; in its contraction, it harmonizes the Four Images. It gathers the Five Phases, unites the Eight Trigrams, fuses lead and mercury, water and fire, and returns spirit, essence, hun, and po to tranquility. Whether becoming an immortal, a buddha, a master, or a scholar, all is accomplished through the heart.\n\n**Question:** In the Way of the Golden Elixir, which comes first—nature or life?\n**Answer:** Those who enter through the school of nature make nature primary and life responsive. Those who enter through the school of life make life primary and nature responsive. Nature cannot exist without life—without life, it is mere dry wisdom. Life cannot exist without nature—without nature, it is withered yang. These two emerge together yet differ in function; one cannot cling to just one.\n\n**Question:** Humans take form, qi, spirit, nature, and life as their foundation. Where do they ultimately begin and end?\n**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate blends into qi; the singularity of qi is called essence; the wondrous aspect of essence is called spirit; the wondrous aspect of spirit is called nature. When qi descends into humans, it becomes life. In humans, qi governs form. When qi is sufficient, essence is sufficient; when essence is sufficient, spirit is luminous; when spirit is luminous, nature reaches its apex. Nature is the beginning; life is the end. The ultimate lies therein.\n\n**Question:** If one can embrace the origin and guard the One, the rest—hexagrams, yin and yang—are merely metaphors. Why trouble oneself with abstruse studies, needlessly burdening the mind?\n**Answer:** The Way of the immortals is not for those of dull perception. If one does not clearly understand the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate and the root of heaven and earth, and does not recognize hexagram images, qi numbers, Kan and Li, lead and mercury, one is not a master of principle. If one merely embraces the origin without change or guards the One without comprehension, remaining ignorant of the Dao’s whereabouts, how can this be called the wondrous mystery? The Way of the immortals is not for the obstinate or the unlearned.\n\n**Question:** The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Is the Mysterious Female not a physical entity?\n**Answer:** The Mysterious Female is the ancestor of the primordial Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things are born from it; the myriad principles and ten thousand methods return to it. In things, it is nature and life; in medicine, it is lead and mercury; in humans, it is spirit and essence; in hexagrams, it is Kan and Li; in the *Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is the original nature; in Daoism, it is the Mysterious Pass. This single aperture encompasses wondrous principles and subtle workings beyond words. One who attains it may share the years of heaven and earth.\n\nThe Mysterious Female is not a thing of form or substance.\n\n**Question:** If the refinement of elixirs and ingestion of medicinal substances cannot be relied upon, then what *can* be relied upon?\n**Answer:** Lead is one’s own lead; mercury is one’s own mercury; essence is one’s own essence; spirit is one’s own spirit; the crucible and vessel are one’s own; the medicinal ingredients are one’s own; dragon and tiger are one’s own; Kan and Li correspond to one’s own system. All these metaphors refer to what one already possesses and employs—only then can they align with the Great Elixir. Seeking cinnabar in the world while abandoning the treasures within one’s own home is like trying to steam sand into rice or grasp leaves as gold—merely a waste of spirit.\n\n**Question:** Pengzu said:\n*\"To dismiss one’s wife is to vainly sever yin and yang;\nTo cease eating is but to empty the bowels and stomach.\"*\nDoes this mean that the Golden Elixir need not obstruct one’s family life, diet, fame, or profit?\n**Answer:** Immortals observe that worldly people assume abandoning one’s wife and fasting alone constitute the Great Way, without ever seeking their own original life and primordial spirit. If one can remain in the world without being of it, dwell in dust without being stained by it, then there is no need to forsake gratitude and righteousness, abandon food, or leave one’s spouse—no need to stand apart in eccentric isolation to cultivate the Dao. But those who cling to the words of ancients, believing that the pursuit of immortality does not hinder family, diet, fame, or profit, are destined for hell.\n\n**Question:** The ancients required an encounter with a master to attain the Dao—were there any who succeeded without one?\n**Answer:** Before awakening, one must meet a teacher; after awakening, one becomes one’s own heart-master. As Zhuangzi said: *\"If the Dao could be given to others, none would fail to pass it to their descendants.\"* In general, one must awaken through one’s own heart. Seeking externally from others is but a futile endeavor.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of* **Direct Pointers to the Mysteries of the Dao: All Methods Return to the Same Source**\n\n*Scroll Three of* **Direct Pointers to the Mysteries of the Dao: All Methods Return to the Same Source**\n*Composed by Mu Changchao of Yangshan Daoist Abbey, Jian’an*\n*Compiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren*\n\nShould one inquire about the elixir of gold, essence, and life—\n\n**Question:** Is it permissible in principle to proceed without a master’s transmission?\n**Answer:** Those who awaken without a teacher are not unknown in the world. As Zhuangzi said: *\"Follow the sincerity of your heart and take it as your teacher—who alone is without one?\"* The Buddha declared: *\"In past lives, I had countless teachers. Now, by the natural radiance of my spirit, I attain the Dao—this is to be without a teacher.\"* Yet it is not that there is no teacher; rather, seeking from others is not as reliable as seeking from oneself. If the lineage is impure, one may instead be led into confusion—how easily does one meet a true master?\n\n**Question:** The ingredients are easy to recognize, but the firing times are most difficult. How should one practice to get it right?\n**Answer:** From ancient times to the present, no elixir manual has spoken of the initial work of firing times. Only the illustrated diagrams of the Perfected Zhang and Bai Yuchan reveal it with utmost clarity. The *Lotus Sutra* calls it *\"the one great causal condition\"*—it is no small matter. One must awaken to it with perfect clarity, so that in all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, one remains like an infant cradled in the arms. Spirit and qi harmonize; Kan and Li circulate in secret. Inner visions do not arise; external thoughts do not stir. If thoughts move, the fire scatters; if notions arise, the timing is lost. Warm as the sun in a cold land, bright as the full moon in autumn’s sky. Like a hen brooding her eggs, like a young dragon nurturing its pearl. As in the primal chaos of the Two Modes, as at the beginning of the undifferentiated qi. The Confucians speak of *\"joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure before they arise\"*; the Buddhists speak of *\"emptiness of sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness.\"* If one refines in this way, the elixir path may be accomplished; otherwise, I know not what will become of it.\n\n**Question:** What are the two arcs?\n**Answer:** The human body naturally possesses two arcs. Speaking in terms of the celestial Dao: at the new moon, Kun begins as *Fu*, resembling the moon’s first crescent. By the eighth day, Kun transforms into *Lin*, resembling the first quarter. On the fifteenth, Kun becomes *Tai*, resembling the full moon. On the sixteenth, Qian begins as *Gou*, resembling the moon’s waning. By the twenty-third, Qian transforms into *Dun*, resembling the last quarter. On the thirtieth day, Qian is exhausted and transforms into Kun, resembling the dark moon. From this point onward, Kun again gives rise to Zhen; darkness again gives birth to brightness. Thus it cycles endlessly, without cease. From the eighth to the twenty-third day, exactly sixteen days pass—this is called *\"one catty.\"* Yin and yang are evenly balanced, hence the term *\"two arcs.\"* The elixir path takes its model from this, serving as the standard for the inner symbolism of the human body.\n\n**Question:** May we hear of the inner symbolism of the two arcs?\n**Answer:** Half a catty of gold, half a catty of silver—upper and lower unite in harmony, like the full moon. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir path will not succeed. This Dao is profound and wondrous; it cannot be transmitted except by the heart.\n\n**Question:** What are the two solstices?\n**Answer:** To speak of what is near: the day has its two solstices, the hour has its two solstices, the moment has its two solstices. Kan and Li, midnight and noon—these interactions never leave our bodies, so one need not seek the winter and summer solstices.\n\n**Question:** Are the heart and the intent one thing or two?\n**Answer:** The heart is awareness; intent is that which follows. The heart is aware and knows; thought follows accordingly. The heart’s mechanism operates through intent; intent is bound to the heart. The two cannot be separated. The spleen governs intent; intent delights in sound, hence the character for *\"sound\"* (音) is placed under *\"heart\"* (心) to form *\"intent\"* (意). The spleen belongs to earth; the spleen delights in thought, hence the character for *\"field\"* (田) is added to *\"heart\"* (心) to form *\"thought\"* (思). All terms such as intent, thought, will, reflection, gratitude, and resentment—those derived from the heart—are written with the *\"heart\"* radical. Thus we know that intent depends on the heart as its master. Hence it is said: *\"All things are created by the heart alone.\"*\n\n**Question:** May we hear of the wondrous harmony of the five spirits?\n**Answer:** The hun emerges from the liver and corresponds to the eyes. The po emerges from the lungs and corresponds to the nose. Essence emerges from the kidneys and corresponds to the ears. Spirit emerges from the heart and corresponds to the tongue. Intent emerges from the spleen and corresponds to the four limbs. The heart’s spirit, hun, and po—through their seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—enable the eye’s root to discern colors, the ear’s root to hear sounds, the nose’s root to detect fragrances, and the tongue’s root to know tastes. Without intent, these four could not exercise their functions. Thus, if intent does not think, the hun does not rise; if intent does not ponder, essence does not move; if intent does not imagine, the po does not scatter; if intent does not conceive, the spirit does not waver. Internally, spirit, essence, hun, and po gather in intent; externally, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue submit to the spleen. In symbolism, metal, wood, water, and fire harmonize with earth. Governing the five qi and blending the hundred spirits—all depend on the spleen’s intent. As the ancients said: *\"When not a single thought arises, the entire body is revealed; when the six roots stir, clouds obscure it.\"* This is also the subtlety of elixir refinement.\n\n**Question:** What are the similarities and differences between nature, spirit, and heart?\n**Answer:** Nature is the true emptiness that is utterly still. Spirit is the wondrous, numinous presence within true emptiness. It is through spirit that nature responds and communicates. The heart is the pivot of nature and the mechanism of spirit. When the pivot and mechanism are still, nature and spirit are at peace; when they move, nature and spirit waver. Though they have two functions, they do not depart from one body. Nature does not illuminate itself—spirit illuminates it. Nature does not communicate itself—spirit communicates it. To pacify nature and preserve spirit is the work of the heart. All methods arise from the heart.\n\n**Question:** What is wisdom?\n**Answer:** Wisdom is not of the human heart; it cannot be possessed. Wisdom is Kan; insight is Li. Water governs wisdom, flowing without cease. Fire governs insight, shining without cease. Wisdom-water and insight-fire circulate endlessly, and in all things, they are impartial. Wisdom is all-pervading; insight is all-illuminating. To be penetrating and illuminating is called wisdom. In Buddhism, it is wisdom; in Daoism, it is spirit and essence. To awaken to it is to embody the great void; to be deluded by it is to grope in the darkest night.\n\nAll beings, whether ordinary or enlightened, share the same essence—only awakening separates them.\n\n**Question:** What of fasting?\n**Answer:** The ancients, with their spirit, qi, and essence complete, practiced long and naturally ceased to eat without needing to fast. People today, not grasping the principle, forcibly abstain for five or seven days, mistaking starvation for discipline. They grow gaunt, their faces grimy, their essence withered, their hearts weak and trembling—yet they deem this the Way. They torment themselves in ascetic practice, hoping for blissful reward. How foolish!\n\n**Question:** Some claim that supplementing essence and strengthening yang through diet forms the foundation of the elixir. Is this correct?\n**Answer:** Humans rely on food to live, but enough to sustain the body suffices. To indulge the palate, nourishing the Three Corpses and feeding the Five Ghosts, is a method that harms the spirit and depletes qi—how can it be the path to longevity? Without abstinence and precepts, how can one be called pure? No sage or immortal ever spoke of drunkenness and gluttony as the way to transcendence.\n\n**Question:** Those in the world who lack understanding merely seek to preserve their form and avoid death. If one’s practice does not reach this goal, what then?\n**Answer:** This question is like a lotus in snow—rare in ancient or modern times. Most who study the Dao only learn to preserve their form and gather qi, treasuring their bodily shell in hopes of longevity, unaware that the great matter of life and death looms. When the final hour arrives, they scramble in panic, rushing toward the six destinies. As the scripture says: \"The ghostly path is ever perilous.\" Seekers must thoroughly investigate the final step—do not treat it lightly.\n\n**Question:** The great matter of life and death—pray, enlighten me on this final step.\n**Answer:** Humans receive their bodies from their parents, modeled after heaven and earth, sustained by the five qi, and established through myriad conditions. From head to toe, all is impermanent. Thus, Maitreya’s verse says: \"Though you endure for eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, you fall into emptiness.\" Only the primordial beginning of the Great Void, the original yang, remains unscathed even when the kalpa-fire rages. All else is borrowed—how can it not die? Laozi said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body.\" And again: \"The sage sets the body aside, yet the body endures.\" Thus, this body is ultimately an affliction; only the Dao can exist alone. The ancients practiced the Dao, not for the body. If one can embody the unborn and undying, attain the stillness of cessation, and reach the state beyond death and birth—what concern remains for the final step?\n\n**Question:** All things are impermanent—this is an unchanging truth across past and present. Is there truly a path beyond death?\n**Answer:** The ancients said:\n*There is a thing before heaven and earth,\nIts form originally still and vast.\nIt masters the ten thousand images,\nUnchanging through the four seasons’ decay.*\nLaozi spoke of the \"valley spirit that does not die\"—this is it. Things are impermanent, but our Dao alone endures. Things cannot escape death, yet we alone do not die. Is this not the path beyond death?\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists focus entirely on the final step, even to the point of sacrificing their bodies for the Dao or giving their lives to benefit beings. Why?\n**Answer:** The Buddhists see that before heaven and earth took form, the ten thousand things had no names or appearances. What we call names and appearances now are merely illusory combinations arising from conditions, mistaken for true principle. If one awakens to true principle, this body and life are seen as impermanent, destined to vanish—cast them aside like rotting wood. The wish is only to benefit all beings; the Dao is practiced, not the body. Thus, they exhaust life to its end, for this one matter is crucial at the moment of death.\n\n**Question:** By your reasoning, then, the path to longevity is unnecessary?\n**Answer:** The unborn and undying are the true heart of heaven and earth. Many sages of antiquity attained this. To deny it is to slander the Dao; to affirm it is to find it rare. I fear that people cannot avoid death, so I urge early awakening to the final step—lest at the last moment they enter another womb. I do not dare say it does not exist, only that beings seldom attain it.\n\n**Question:** If one does not know tomorrow’s life today, how can one know death?\n**Answer:** The tradition says: \"Only the sage knows existence and extinction.\" The principle of life and death is not something ordinary people can grasp. But if you understand your origin, you understand your return. If you understand birth, you understand death. Yin and yang share a single principle; life and death are one path. Without realizing this essential point, how can one speak of the Dao?\n\n**Question:** After the four great elements dissolve, where does this final step ultimately rest?\n**Answer:** Few past masters have discussed this. When the illusory body’s four great elements dissolve, the four great elements of true emptiness endure forever. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Originally pure and all-pervading, it fills the dharma-realm.\" A moment’s delusion at the final hour, and one creates the causes of rebirth, falling once more into a womb. This final step is truly inconceivable—difficult to fathom.\n\n**Question:** Does the true emptiness of the four great elements possess awareness?\n**Answer:** It cannot be seen by sight or heard by sound. Wondrous! The Three Caverns echo in emptiness—how resonant! Yet it is said: \"If there is sound and resonance, how can it be called true emptiness?\"\n**Answer:** Foolish as wood and stone! How can you speak of the Dao without grasping the sage’s subtlety?\n\n**Question:** You first practiced Chan, then later studied immortality. May I ask whom you studied under, and might I hear of your circumstances?\n**Answer:** In my youth, I saw Master Zihu weep over a dog, then return to his quarters and close the door. There, I awakened to the nature school. Later, in *The Awakening to Reality*, I grasped the meaning of the \"millet pearl\" and awakened to the life school. After twenty-odd years of war, though I endured hardships, I never neglected my practice. Once, on the road, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted the marvel of the firing times. Following it, I achieved verification within the expected time.\n\nAlas! The world lacks true discernment and cannot together propagate the great Dao—how lamentable!\n\n**Question:** The Complete Reality Teaching greatly resembles Buddhism. Why is this?\n**Answer:** The emptiness and spontaneity of Laozi’s *Dao*, its non-action and purity, are not unlike those of Buddhism. The arts of preserving form and nurturing life were but a reluctant concession by the sages—a secondary gate pressed open to guide those of gradual cultivation. The supreme vehicle flows in a single current; who but the sages could partake of it? The Complete Reality path is one of sudden cultivation, hence its resemblance to Buddhism.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by *sudden cultivation*?\n**Answer:** *Sudden* means *directly through*. Without traversing side-paths, without entering the gate of the fence, one seizes the supreme vehicle—this is the way of the golden immortals. To proceed by path to gate, by gate to hall, by hall to chamber: this is called *gradual*. As the *Classic of Purity* says, “Gradually enter the true Dao.”\n\n**Question:** Among ascension, immortality, and postmortem liberation, which is superior?\n**Answer:** When spirit and form are both perfected, one may ascend; when spirit is preserved and *qi* nurtured, one may achieve immortality; when form perishes but spirit remains, one may attain postmortem liberation. Ascension and immortality are not of this world, yet those who sit in death and leave their bodies behind—how can any age lack them? Superiority or inferiority lies in what one verifies; it cannot lightly be debated.\n\n**Question:** Is every case of postmortem liberation necessarily the Dao?\n**Answer:** Those who sit in death or stand in release must have cultivated and verified in life. Their conduct aligns within, their words manifest without. If they truly know the root of the great Dao, then at the moment of departure, with wind clear and moon bright, it may be called the Dao. But if their understanding of the mysterious principle is shallow, and they leave no words for the world, merely sitting in transformation like ordinary folk—what is extraordinary about that?\n\n**Question:** Why did Śākyamuni lie on his right side to enter *nirvāṇa*?\n**Answer:** *Nir* means quiescence and non-arising; *vāṇa* means eternal life and non-death. To reach the realm of neither arising nor ceasing—this is called the Dao. His lying on the right side and being encoffined with solemnity were to demonstrate conformity with worldly law, not differing from the multitude, so as to set an example for later generations and prevent reckless displays of the strange. When a person of the Dao departs, what need is there for any particular posture?\n\n**Question:** All scriptures say the Dao is not apart from the body, yet they also say that tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and the four great elements constituting the body are all yin—hence subject to aging and death. Then where is the Dao to be found?\n**Answer:** Before father and mother were born, this body did not exist. Once form arose, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mind, spirit, *hun*, *po*, intent, old age, sickness, death, suffering, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness gathered and were named “one body”; divided, they were called the “four great elements.” Borrowed and conjoined, they are named “human”—hence they are called *yin*. Only the original true nature, that single spark of primordial yang, is called the Valley Spirit or the Mysterious Female. Within our body, this is the Dao—this is what achieves eternal life and non-death.\n\n**Question:** If so, can form be discarded and not taken up, and the Dao exist apart from the body?\n**Answer:** The body is the root, the mind the sovereign. Without the root, life has no foundation; without the sovereign, the Dao has no home. Only with body and mind can this Dao be realized. Without understanding the interplay of movement and stillness, without recognizing the master’s presence or absence, stubbornly clinging to the form of this born body—whether you discard it or cherish it, neither brings benefit. This Dao is not outside the body, nor within it; to separate from it is false, to grasp it is delusion. One must awaken to the point where spirit and form are both perfected—only then can the body be transcended while the body remains.\n\n**Question:** Can one attain the Dao without employing Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake, the crucible and furnace, firing times, lead and mercury, cinnabar and the like—without all these images?\n**Answer:** To ask this is, in the Daoist tradition, to speak of the Primordial Beginning of Floating Blackness; in Buddhism, of the Tathāgata of Empty Sovereignty; in Confucianism, of the Supreme Ultimate of the Prior Heaven. This Dao is inherently complete, requiring no cultivation. Whoever suddenly awakens to it finds that all the world’s scriptures, expedient metaphors, forms, sounds, and images—even the mechanisms of dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake—are no longer needed. To enter this Dao is called the supreme vehicle. If one has not yet done so, one must carve and chisel the undifferentiated, distinguish lead and mercury, exhaust principle and fulfill nature, return to the root and restore life, truly recognize the rootless—only then may one embody the realms of the Primordial Beginning, the Empty Sovereign, and the Supreme Ultimate. Those who do not follow models but directly verify it are said to awaken suddenly. Those who verify it through instruments and images are said to practice gradual learning. Though there may be differences in speed, their destination is one.\n\n**Question:** In the age of high antiquity, when writing had not yet arisen and the Three Teachings had not yet spread, by what did people learn the Dao?\n**Answer:** In the earliest times, people did not distinguish between sage and fool, wise and worthy; they did not know benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, or virtue; they had no grasp of the marvelous, the skillful, writing, numbers, or calculation. Human hearts were simple and honest, making the Dao easy to attain. But when Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor established the Dao, when Yao and Shun instituted laws, when the Three Teachings stood in parallel and the Hundred Schools flowed forth, people galloped in the arena of letters, pursued the debates of right and wrong, clung to texts and principles, and craft and pretense followed one after another. Thus, the more learners there were, the fewer succeeded. For this reason, the Great Master Bodhidharma transmitted the teaching from the West: “No reliance on written words, a special transmission outside the teachings, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and becoming Buddha”—this set a standard for China, embodying the intent of high antiquity’s wordless age. If one can suddenly awaken and directly understand the source of the mind, then the Three Baskets of teachings may be dispensed with, and the Six Divisions of scriptures may be discarded. Laozi spoke of “cutting off learning to be without care,” Yongjia of “cutting off learning to be without action,” Zhuangzi of “cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom,” and Confucius of “I wish to be wordless”—when did they ever take writing as the Dao?\n\nShould one ask: *The Book of Changes* is a Confucian text—why do those who study immortality take it as their standard?\n\nI reply: Man’s form is modeled on Heaven and Earth, and *Changes* accords with Heaven and Earth; thus do scholars take it as their standard.\n\nShould one ask: Is there a Dao beyond the *Changes*?\n\nI say: The Dao of *Changes* begins with Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—this is the Dao of forms, and from it the School of Destiny is established. Before the One Qi coalesced and the Four Images divided, this was the formless Dao, and from it the School of Nature arises. The *Changes* with forms allows for the taking of images; the *Changes* without forms admits no names or words—this namelessness is the Dao beyond the *Changes*.\n\nShould one ask: The Way of the Golden Elixir follows the *Changes*—is this not cumbersome?\n\nI reply: My Dao resides in the Great Simplicity before separation, before the division of the Two Qi—what cumbersomeness is there?\n\nShould one ask: If Confucians master the *Changes*, are they not also immortals?\n\nI reply: Between Confucian and immortal, only a sheet of paper lies. Yet those Confucians study to seek worldly connections, amassing vast learning—though they refine their [ ] to their own use, they foster disbelief instead. This is how they differ from immortals.\n\nShould one ask: This disciple reads the *Triple Concordance* of the Golden Elixir, yet [ ] walks through a bramble thicket—might you offer a single word of guidance on the straightforward path?\n\nI reply: The elixir classics merely borrow images to clarify principles, use things to illuminate the mind. If one grasps the origin of nature and destiny, the subtlety of fire-times, then all images and things may be discarded, and the Dao of words forgotten. Why be turned by mere texts?\n\nShould one ask: Master, you are a Daoist priest, yet your words always encompass Buddhism—why is this?\n\nI reply: Though the forms of the head differ, the nature and principle remain the same. Though the teachings diverge, the Dao and Buddha have never differed in their root. Those who divide them are base scholars.\n\nShould one ask: Later generations may not understand and might mistake you for a Chan practitioner.\n\nI reply: Alas, is this so? I rectify nature and destiny through the Dao of immortality, and broaden wisdom through the study of the Buddha’s Way. The Dao of immortality does not die; the Dao of Buddha does not live. Neither dying nor living—this is the Mud-Pill Palace. The world does not comprehend this principle, clinging to one side, failing to realize the Great Vehicle, directing the mind narrowly, thinking only of themselves and not of all beings. Thus the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: There are ten kinds of immortals in the world, all of whom, among men, do not cultivate true awakening and, when their retribution is exhausted, return to the various destinies.\n\nShould one ask: Can the methods of fasting and ritual offerings lead to sagehood and transcendence?\n\nI reply: Before the Three Dynasties, such practices did not exist—they were merely methods of sacrifice. Among the followers of Laozi, they are called *jiao*; among Buddhists, *zhai*. Their words are nothing more than songs praising goodness. They bring three kinds of benefit: first, they inspire reverence in worldly people; second, they awaken the mind of generosity in worldly people; third, they benefit those who have left the household. If one relies on these to attain sagehood and transcendence, it is but a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow.\n\nShould one ask: What is the meaning of the inversion of yin and yang?\n\nI reply: The middle line of the two in Qian becomes Li; the middle line of the one in Kun becomes Kan. Li pertains to yin, yet is the sun; Kan pertains to yang, yet is the moon. Qian retreats and dwells in Kan; Kun retreats and dwells in Li. When Kan and Li unite, Qian and Kun restore their mandate. From below returning to above is called *return*; from the end returning to the origin is called *restoration*. This path of return and restoration is the inversion. Thus it is said: The sage swims against the current; the common person flows with it. Those who go against it form the elixir; those who follow it become mere things.\n\nShould one ask: The elixir texts match the sixty-four hexagrams to a month, two months to a day, and take the waxing and waning of each line as the fire-times—is this method not the most direct path?\n\nI reply: From the Great Ultimate, the One Qi splits to become Qian; two Qians become Kun. From Qian and Kun arise the sixty-four hexagrams, unfolding into three hundred eighty-four lines, accumulating into ten thousand and more—this is the Dao descending from its root to its branches. The sage, out of necessity, borrows the images of the *Changes* to match the Great Elixir. The wise person traces the current back to its source, cuts through the tangled silk with a single stroke, and works on the single word *one*. If one clings to images and follows the branches to their end, one will see only towering waves and vast surging waters. To seek outside rather than within the body—what delusion could be greater?\n\nShould one ask: What is the meaning of *bathing*?\n\nI reply: The fire-embryo is at *zi*, nurtured at *chou*, grows at *yin*, and bathes at *mao*. The water-embryo is at *wu*, nurtured at *wei*, grows at *shen*, and bathes at *you*. From *zi* to *yin* are the Three Yangs—this is the hexagram *Tai*. It is the position where fire is born, where the Two Qi are balanced, and above and below harmonize. Beyond *mao* is *Zhuang*, where yang’s vigor gradually increases and the yin path begins to depart—this is called *bathing*. Thus in the second month, the elm’s pods fall, for within yang there is punishment. From *wu* to *shen* are the Three Yins—this is the hexagram *Pi*. It is the position where water is born, where the Two Qi are balanced. Beyond *you* is *Guan*, where yin’s softness gradually increases and the yang path begins to depart—this too is called *bathing*. In the eighth month, the shepherd’s purse sprouts, for within yin there is virtue. Yang contains yin; yin contains yang—thus punishment and virtue bear each other, and day and night begin to divide. When refining the elixir to this point, cease the tally and do not move; nurture the original qi, bathe the Pearl of the Child, so that thoughts do not arise in the numinous terrace, cinnabar and mercury abide long in the golden crucible—like a newborn infant who must be bathed, so that this mind is pure, bare, and bright, like the full moon in the autumn sky, like a pearl on a fixed scale.\n\nShould one ask: The elixir texts speak of internal elixirs that prolong life and external elixirs that enable ascension—are external elixirs not merely worldly medicines?\n\nThe answer is: The internal elixir is one’s own primordial qi. The external elixir is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet this elixir fundamentally has no inside or outside—one’s own primordial qi is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, and the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth is one’s own primordial qi. Inner and outer cannot be separated even for a moment; what can be separated is not the Dao. The ancient immortals, fearing that世人 would know only the internal medicine and not comprehend the great Dao, forcibly established the names \"internal\" and \"external\" so that people might know this and thereby understand that.\n\nLater students often mistake external elixirs for worldly medicines—how could minerals, metals, herbs, and plants ever align with the wondrous workings of the original spirit of one’s destiny?\n\nSomeone asks: There are those who seek long life by absorbing yin to strengthen yang, indulging in the five pungent foods, wine, and meat to nourish themselves—can this be called the Dao?\n\nThe answer is: These are the perverse teachings of false masters who deceive the world, leading the purest yang into the filthiest yin, and mingling the clearest spirit with the most turbid qi. These are cattle, sheep, dogs, and horses—not of humankind. They are all seeds of hell; how can this be called the Dao? The perfected ones replenish with primordial essence and return it with primordial spirit, for this is the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, not a technique of contrived effort.\n\nSomeone asks: How do the internal and external true elixirs unite?\n\nThe answer is: Humans are shaped in the likeness of Heaven and Earth; my body is equal to Heaven and Earth and does not fall short, my heart encompasses Heaven and Earth and does not exceed. The qi of Heaven and Earth is my qi, the essence of Heaven and Earth is my essence, the spirit of Heaven and Earth is my spirit. In movement and stillness, seeing and hearing, knowing and perceiving, this Dao never departs from my side. Yet世人 are ignorant of this and cannot reflect within, thus growing distant from the Dao. If one can turn the light inward, awaken to the original source, then the myriad images of the Three Powers all reside within one’s breast—where then is the distinction between inner and outer?\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who know internal refinement but do not comprehend the great Dao?\n\nThe answer is: Those who refine internally without understanding the great Dao can only prolong life. They are merely corpses whose essence and soul do not scatter; when their allotted span ends, they are reborn into the world—those with good fortune become human, those with meager fortune become other kinds. This is the fault of not comprehending the great Dao.\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who know the great Dao but do not practice, or know the internal medicine but do not refine it?\n\nThe answer is: Knowing but not acting is like someone describing food but never being full, speaking of treasure but never alleviating poverty. Though one may know, what benefit is there?\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who diligently practice but do not attain the true Dao, or study but do not encounter the authentic oral instructions?\n\nThe answer is:世上 are countless blind cultivators and misguided refiners who follow crooked paths and side trails. Though they may have a heart of diligence, they do not understand the great method, each clinging to their own views, relying on their own efforts, unwilling to draw near to good companions or seek out true friends. Their whole lives are thus wasted.\n\nSomeone asks: There are those who spend their years speaking of seeking and visiting masters, yet by the time their hair turns white, they gain nothing—whose fault is this?\n\nThe answer is: Among recent scholars, some carry a dead corpse and wander the rivers and lakes, only discussing where to spend the summer, where to endure the winter, where to beg for alms, where to find good food and drink. As for the medicines of inner and outer, the mechanisms of movement and stillness—when have they ever understood even a speck of it? The Dao does not fault people; people fault themselves.\n\nSomeone asks: Yang is dynamic, yin is quiescent—human nature is supremely quiescent. Does the learning of the Śākya clan not then belong to yin?\n\nThe answer is: Human nature precedes heaven and earth; it is the supremely quiescent and utterly empty Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things all arise from it—it is the true ancestor of yang, the true source of life, the true root of spirit, the fundamental origin of all wonders. Yet people often fail to grasp its subtlety, mistakenly calling quiescent nature yin and dynamic life yang. For movement must take stillness as its substance, and stillness must take movement as its function—this is an inescapable principle of heaven and earth. Moreover, they do not know that within heaven and earth there exists an unchanging wonder, the master of the Three Powers and the myriad things. This quiescence does not follow the rise and fall of yin and yang, does not follow the coming and going of cold and heat, does not pass away with life and death, is not altered by the changes of past and present. It is neither within yin and yang nor beyond movement and stillness. It departs not from purity, yet does not mingle with turbidity. This is the learning of the Śākya clan. To call it yin is to miss its true wonder and lightly dismiss it as wrong. Those who cultivate the Golden Elixir without attaining such clarity are but followers of the Two Vehicles.\n\nSomeone asks: It is said that Master Xu Jingyang once mixed a grain-sized elixir with other medicines to sell, yet none who bought it ever encountered its power. Xu sighed, lamenting the rarity of true immortal talent. Does the elixir of immortals truly exist to deliver people, only for the world to miss it?\n\nThe answer is: When the primordial elixir remains unrefined and the great Dao of the Most High is obscured, to hope that immortals will deliver one with elixirs is like dreaming of food and drink, then waking to seek satiety—like dreaming of treasures, then waking to seek wealth. There is no difference. Elixirs are not said to be nonexistent; the ancients used them to prolong life. Though they may assist yang, they cannot achieve completion. For these are but the borrowed forms of metals, stones, herbs, and trees—how could they ever match the true elixir within our own bodies? Master Xu used them to test the worthy: if one had the karmic affinity for immortality, he would teach them the Dao. How could a mere grain of medicine grant immortality?\n\nSomeone asks: Immortality must depend on past-life affinities—it cannot be attained in a single day. Those like us, whose lot does not reach so far, fear it is too difficult to learn.\n\nThe answer is: In the inherent lot of every person, all is originally complete; in every heart, nothing is initially lacking. Only resolve the will, and you will not be led astray. If one directly abandons killing, theft, lust, desire, and casts off greed, anger, delusion, and attachment; if one grows weary of the world’s snares, deeply awakens the Dao-mind, seeks a clear teacher, and inquires of wise companions—suddenly breaking through the true mechanism and knowing where nature and life reside—then one may instantly become immortal or a buddha. How could it require three or four lifetimes, chasing shadows and following forms? To say one’s lot does not reach so far is merely a failure of the heart, a self-imposed retreat and surrender. If one claims to have no affinity in past lives, none in this life, and none in future lives, then one will be forever distant from the Dao.\n\nSomeone asks: Setting aside the flowers, sprouts, branches, and leaves, what is the most true, most correct, most essential, and most direct aspect of the Golden Elixir? Pray, grant a single word.\n\nThe answer is: The Golden Elixir is not a matter of many affairs—people multiply affairs themselves. The most true lies in one’s own spirit and qi. The most correct lies in the primordial lead and mercury. The most essential lies in the union of the two arcs. The most direct lies in the even regulation of the fire times. All else is but metaphor and discourse—though abundant, what use is it?\n\nSomeone asks: What is the meaning of the seven returns and nine refinements?\n\nThe answer is: Seven is the complete number of fire; nine is the complete number of metal. Seven and nine together make one catty. *Return* means returning to the root; *refinement* means reverting to the source. Combined, they form the two eights, paired as the two arcs—seven and nine are yang numbers. When metal and fire reach this point, yin and kidney are both dissolved, spirit and essence merge, like the moon becoming full as treasure, the Silver River’s waves stilled, a lone boat reaching shore, a traveler returning home. Having attained the root, one forgets the branches—this is called returning and refining.\n\nSomeone asks: Gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, the Three Flowers gathering at the crown, the Five Qi returning to the origin—all reside within this single body. Yet Master Ziyang also said: It is neither heart nor chest, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the cinnabar field, neither the valley passage, nor the bladder, nor the muddy pellet. What does this mean?\n\nThe answer is: Does *The Awakening to Reality* not say: To refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence stirred by licentiousness; to refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose; to refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and intentions. Thus, this spirit and qi share the same root as heaven and earth, the same body as the myriad things. To attain them is to live; to lose them is to die. The sages’ intent shines as brightly as the sun and moon. Yet without this body, who would know the Dao? Without knowing the Dao, this body is but an empty vessel. One must align the person with the Dao, and the Dao with the person—thus it is said: spirit and form both wondrous, united with the Dao in truth. Master Ziyang, fearing that later generations would fail to understand the mysterious female’s aperture, would merely swallow essence, ingest qi, manipulate and massage, cling to the physical body, and secure their dwelling as the great Dao, spoke expediently to break their attachments. This is the body; this is the Dao—how could they ever be separated for even a moment?\n\nSomeone asked: \"Within the year, one takes the month; within the month, the day; within the day, the hour; within the hour, the moment—thus, in the space of a single breath, the elixir of the Dao congeals. If this is so, then are all the fire-phases of the celestial cycle merely empty efforts?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The sages’ mechanism is swift as lightning; within a single breath, the workings of spirit may be verified. Yet while the elixir may congeal in the space of a single breath, it cannot be obtained in that instant alone. One must investigate ceaselessly, practice daily, and maintain it with unbroken continuity—subtly present, applied without strain—until one returns to the root and restores life. Then one may abide in stillness and constancy. One must not seek only the work of a single breath and thus squander a lifetime, nor should one cling to words and images, deluding oneself in vain.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The books of the Yellow River and Luo River are all systems of numbers. Yet the great Dao is formless, while qi and numbers possess form. Is the golden elixir also bound by numbers?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Before the Supreme Ultimate took form, images and numbers were hidden within the great Dao. Once the Supreme Ultimate arose, images and numbers emerged from the One. The One is the root of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the origin of the Five Phases and the Eight Trigrams. Though the great Dao is formless, it lodges its form in images and its position in numbers. Beginning with the Supreme Ultimate, it descends to become numbers, culminating in images and numbers, then returns to become the Dao. When sages discuss the golden elixir in terms of images and numbers, it is out of necessity. The sages must transcend the realm of images and things, the bounds of qi and numbers—how could they be confined to the mere patterns of images and numbers?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why must the Way of the golden elixir be spoken of in terms of numbers?\"\n\nThe answer: \"That which precedes the Supreme Ultimate is not discussed in terms of numbers. That which follows the Supreme Ultimate must be expressed through numbers. The superior adept forgets images and numbers to grasp the One; the middling adept relies on images and numbers to guard the One; the inferior adept studies images and numbers to seek the One. Without numbers, there would be no means to guide later learners—thus images are established as expedient teachings.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Kan (☵) and Li (☲) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome and unite; Zhen (☳) and Dui (☱) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome without uniting. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Qian (☰), the two central lines form Li; in Kun (☷), the single central line forms Kan. When Kan and Li unite, the bodies of Qian and Kun are restored. As the *Book of Changes* says: 'Water and fire shoot at each other,' thus achieving completion. Only the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent the union of central correctness. Zhen, Xun, Gen, and Dui are all partial unions. The golden elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, for it draws upon the union of central correctness as the Dao. When Zhen and Dui shoot at each other, they create separation; in the hexagrams, this is *Guimei* (归妹), while Gen and Xun form *Gu* (蛊)—both are images of imbalance.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the golden liquid returning elixir?\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Kan, the one and six combine to make seven, which is the completion number of fire—this is the true fire within Kan. In Li, the two and seven combine to make nine, the completion number of metal—this is the true gold within Li. When gold is refined by fire, it melts into liquid and descends to the kidneys, where it is called lead. When fire is tempered by water, it transforms into essence and ascends to the heart, where it is called mercury. The wonder of the returning elixir lies in the interplay of gold and fire; the wonder of their union lies in Kan and Li. When the golden liquid in the heart descends to return to the kidneys, this is called the golden liquid returning elixir.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If one does not know the great medicine or the fire-phases, but merely accumulates merit and performs good deeds, can one attain long life and ascend as an immortal?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Among the immortals of the Three Realms and the buddhas of the ten directions, none have attained fruition without accumulating merit, performing good deeds, and cultivating causes. Among the five destinies, only humans can learn the Dao. If one wishes to attain long life and ascend as an immortal, one must clearly understand the fire-phases and the conditions of the great Dao. Without knowing its wonders, even if one accumulates merit and performs good deeds, one will only enjoy the blessings of humanity and heaven in the future. When those blessings are exhausted, one will still undergo rebirth—this is not the unborn and undying Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The Buddhist teachings on precepts are strict, detailed, and comprehensive, while the alchemical texts only speak of cultivation and refinement, barely mentioning fasting and precepts. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts; without fasting and precepts, how can one practice the Dao? The Heavenly Worthy has the Nine Precepts and Forty-Nine Precepts; Xishan has the Ten Precepts for Cultivating Reality and the Twenty-Four Precepts—these are no less strict, detailed, and comprehensive than the Buddhist precepts. For those who study the Dao, without fasting, the mind of killing cannot be severed; without precepts, the desires of the will cannot be cut off. If even one precept is not cultivated, a hundred transgressions will disorder the mind. If even one desire is not dispelled, a multitude of evils will trouble the heart. If the six desires are not eliminated and the three poisons are not extinguished, the heart-snake will not die, and the mind-horse will gallop endlessly—can this be called the Dao? Those who claim that understanding the Dao alone suffices, without fasting and precepts, are followers of demonic spirits. How can they be worthy of mention?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Laozi said, 'Those who cling are unclear about the Dao and virtue.' Is the method of the golden elixir not close to clinging?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Clinging to the head of a dead snake without knowing change, being glued to the five desires without liberation, indulging in greed, anger, and delusion without turning back, committing killing, theft, and lust without awakening—all such actions, seeking blessings and coveting merit, are clinging, and thus cannot be called the Dao and virtue. The Way of the golden elixir silently moves water and fire, truly uniting with the mysterious origin—acting without acting, yet without non-acting. It begins in non-being and ends in being; yet in the end, it does not abide in being, and in the beginning, it does not abide in non-being. Like the autumn moon flowing in the sky, like idle clouds emerging from the peaks—pure and free, lively and fluid—this is the wonder of the golden elixir. Where is there any clinging?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"I wish to hear about the initial practice. What is it?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Move the mind without distraction, focus the qi to attain softness—like the handle of the Dipper circling the heavens, like the two wheels turning the hub. The ancient immortals said: 'Qi is the medicine that adds years; the mind is the spirit that directs qi. If you know the point where qi moves, you are already an immortal.'\"\n\nTo harmonize the heart and qi is to truly unite mercury and lead, and knowing the origin and pathway of the qi’s cavity—this is the initial practice. This Dao is not lightly transmitted, though its value exceeds a thousand gold.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Regarding the gathering of medicine, the congealing of the elixir, the firing and refining, the sealing and safeguarding, the nurturing and warding off danger, the guarding of the city, and the battles in the wild—could you reveal these without concealment?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Works such as *The Awakening to Reality*, *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*, *Returning to the Source*, *Restoring Life*, *Discerning Delusions*, *The Marrow of the Yin Talisman*, and *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*—these golden words uttered by the ancestral immortals shine as brightly as the sun, with nothing hidden or obscured. They have opened the way for the world in abundance. If you can see through them clearly and awaken fully, the texts you ask about already contain all explanations. Why would one need to expound on each in turn?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the meaning of the separation between metal and wood?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Metal corresponds to the lungs, the nose, the corporeal soul, and the senses of smell. Wood corresponds to the liver, the eyes, the ethereal soul, and the perception of forms. When the eyes are enslaved by forms, the ethereal soul scatters; when the nose is enslaved by fragrances, the corporeal soul disperses. Wood resides in the east, metal in the west—these two cannot naturally mediate their union, hence they are said to be separated. To unite them, one must rely on the earthly branches *wu* and *ji*. Metal, born of earth, can thus restrain wood; wood, subdued by metal, returns to earth. Without this mutual restraint, the elixir cannot be formed. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mind—when they pursue their objects—are all termed ‘separation,’ not merely metal and wood.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of the golden elixir.\n\nThe answer: \"It is the central harmony of the five qi, the blending of the hundred spirits. Then, forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness—this encompasses the entire meaning.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of nurturing.\n\nThe answer: \"It is the regulation of harmony—nothing more.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of firing times.\n\nThe answer: \"Using the heart to guide qi, uniting essence with spirit, circulating through the waxing and waning phases without cease—this fulfills the firing times.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of returning to the true.\n\nThe answer: \"When spirit and form are both wondrous, they merge with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of preservation and adherence.\n\nThe answer: \"Preserve it as one would preserve the throne, adhere to it as one would entrust a great minister. Neither beginning nor end falters, neither center nor periphery falls away. Even if treading through boiling water or facing blades and saws, this matter remains unlost—this is what is called preservation and adherence.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of practice and perseverance.\n\nThe answer: \"Harmonious yet not drifting, like spring returning to a cold valley; moving yet not ceasing, like the moon shining in a clear sky. In all twelve hours, forget things—detached from the world as if merely passing through.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of transcendence.\n\nThe answer: \"Ultimately, one must leave the household while preserving the master, discard the false while retaining the true. As the ancient immortals said: 'When the work is complete, one must depart the capital of spirit; do not cling to the body amid the inner court’s splendor.'\"\n\nSomeone asked about the true origin.\n\nThe answer: \"True constancy, true stillness, true emptiness, original essence, original spirit, original qi—these six are all contained within the one heart. If one attains them, one immediately ascends to the realm of the sages.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"How do the cauldron, medicine, and firing times correspond?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The ancients took heaven and earth as the cauldron, *kan* and *li* as the medicine, and the cyclic movement of the four trigrams *zhen*, *dui*, *xun*, and *gen* as the firing times. Borrowing external images to match internal ones, not a hair’s breadth lies outside this body.\"\n\nSomeone said: \"Modern scholars are in disarray, each holding to their own doctrine—out of a thousand, not one agrees. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Without a sage, no one speaks of the sage’s medicine; without a teacher, no one speaks of the spirit’s method. Each fails to receive the true transmission, so though many study, none succeed.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"When the practice reaches its fruition, what is the state like?\"\n\nThe answer: \"At first, it is like an infant returning to its mother; next, like fine wine nearing intoxication. Then, like warmth bathing in a cool breeze, or cold basking in the gentle sun. The mouth forgets speech, the eyes forget sight, the nose forgets scent, the ears forget sound, the mind forgets thoughts, the body forgets existence—only the sense of a single, harmonious qi flowing naturally remains. Even this awareness fades, and one no longer knows how or why. Such is the state when the practice reaches its fruition.\"\n\nThey asked: \"Is this state called ‘spirit and form both wondrous’?\"\n\nThe answer: \"At that time, it is like a fish drinking water—cool or warm, only the self knows.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is there anything beyond the wonder of the golden elixir?\"\n\nThe answer: \"There are paths that go beyond this, but they lead to side doors and are not worth pursuing as the Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not inanimate like earth and wood—how can one keep them constantly still throughout the twelve hours?\"\n\nThe answer: \"I never said to make them as dull as earth and wood in all twelve hours. Rather, when the eyes see forms, do not chase after them; when the ears hear sounds, do not chase after them; when the nose smells fragrances, do not chase after them; when the tongue tastes flavors, do not chase after them; when the body seeks pleasure and ease, do not chase after them; when the mind generates thoughts and delusions, do not chase after them. The six desires cannot seize the heart, the myriad phenomena cannot delude the will. The heart does not cling to things—how could things obstruct me? If one can do this, dwelling amid the forest of the five desires for twelve hours brings no harm. One only needs to be the master—why wait for years on end in rigid stillness?\"\n\nSomeone said: \"There are ancient accounts of those who left their forms behind in the world, living alongside others for years, only to vanish without a trace afterward. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The form is merely a burden in the world. Consider the dragon and phoenix—if bound by worldly confinement, their forms are imprisoned, their natures caged, and they may ultimately face dismemberment and destruction. As Laozi said: 'My greatest worry is that I have a body.'\"\n\nUltimately, one must shed the womb and change the bones—how could one remain in the old dwelling without transformation?\n\nSomeone asked: \"The Venerable Master of Piling once said: *'If one cannot live a thousand or ten thousand years, why be a person in this world?'* Yet is this saying merely empty?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Were it not for the purple streets where flowers bloom like brocade, how could the golden oriole descend from the willow branches? If one did not speak of living a thousand or ten thousand years, how could people be persuaded to enter this gate? This is the ancient masters’ skillful expedient speech. If one truly attains the marvel of the Golden Elixir, then one’s life may surpass the touchstone and equal the emptiness of space. A thousand or ten thousand years are but a fleeting bubble upon the great sea—how could they be considered long?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master. I wish to hear the meaning of this.\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Qian, the two central lines form Li; in Kun, the one central line forms Kan. Once the Four Images are established, Wu and Ji reside in the Central Palace. Thus, Kan is received by Wu, and Li by Ji. For Kan and Li intermingle without departing from the positions of Wu and Ji. Yet Kan’s water and Li’s fire naturally contend with each other. It is only because Wu and Ji dwell in the center, generating control and mediation, that water and fire do not repel each other and can instead interact harmoniously. As Ziyang said: *'If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.'* Thus, Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Metal and Wood are separated—are Geng and Jia also separated?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Metal lies in the West, Wood in the East; this is called separation. Yet through the movement of Kan and Li at the center, Wood conceals its form within Li, and Metal conceals its form within Kan, so they unite as one family. Geng is the place where the moon emerges—on the third day, the moon appears at Geng. Jia is the place where the moon becomes full—on the fifteenth, it is full at Jia. Thus, Geng is produced in Kun and receives Jia in Zhen. For Zhen, inheriting Kun’s body, is the eldest son, the place where the Great Medicine is produced and the beginning of the fire-timing. Hence it is said: *'The Medicine is produced in the southwest—this is its native land.'* Geng and Jia are the places of the moon’s birth and fullness—this is not what is meant by separation.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"There are those who do not understand themselves but engage in extreme asceticism—self-immolation, self-defenestration, self-starvation, self-mutilation—hastening the destruction of their bodies in pursuit of the fruit of the Dao. What is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The body is the tree of the Dao. When the tree stands, the fruit grows; if the tree withers early, the fruit perishes with it. Fools, not understanding the fundamental meaning, only make enemies of their bodies. With their minds still deluded, they burn themselves, sever their arms, leap from cliffs, drown in waters, abstain from grain, and starve themselves—inflicting suffering upon themselves, only to drift ever farther from the Dao. The Buddhist scriptures say: *'All the various external paths engage in all manner of strenuous ascetic practices—leaping from cliffs, plunging into water and fire, scorching their bodies with the Five Heats.'* These words are spoken precisely for such people.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Yet the ancients also burned their bodies, severed their arms, cut off their flesh, and sacrificed their lives—why was this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening. Those ancients had all heard the Dao and understood it clearly, so they regarded death as merely shedding a soiled garment or discarding worn-out sandals.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"In foreign lands, monks and Daoists all slaughter oxen and horses for sacrifices, consuming blood and flesh as their vegetarian offerings. Is it that such practices are permitted there but forbidden here?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The flesh of sentient beings is no different from the flesh of one’s own body. Those who leave the household life distinguish themselves from the worldly by upholding the precepts. Thus, they may serve as models for humans and gods, protecting and sustaining all living beings, transcending the realms of humans and gods. Those who drink blood and devour raw flesh belong to a different kind of external path—they sever the seed of great compassion and prolong the fruits of karmic retribution. How can they be spoken of in the same breath?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Nowadays, some claim that fish and meat are warming and can be beneficial, while vegetables are cold and, if eaten for long, diminish vitality. Should those who seek long life simply consume meat?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Those who favor fish and meat will say vegetables are cold; those who favor vegetables will say fish and meat are foul. Yet those who eat fish and meat are consuming sentient beings—sentient beings devouring one another without end. For those who study the Dao, killing is the foremost precept. How can they not be cautious?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"From where does the awareness of the human body arise?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Before this form was born, there was no awareness. Because form unites with qi, and qi gives rise to spirit, and spirit gives rise to consciousness, once these are complete, the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and the sufferings of hunger, cold, illness, and pain—all are universally known and universally perceived. All things of blood and qi are like this.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can spirit attain long life? Can form avoid death?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Form is the root of spirit. If one nurtures form to the point of not dying, how could the nurturing of spirit ever end? When both spirit and form attain subtlety, this is the way of the highest immortals. Yet even those who leave their forms in the world, though they may live five hundred or a thousand years, ultimately cannot escape the transformation of the womb and the replacement of the cauldron. Form has its term, but spirit is without limit. How can they be spoken of as the same?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Spirit is one—yet there are said to be yang spirit and yin spirit. I wish to hear the meaning of this.\"\n\nThe answer: \"Yang spirit is not the spirit of discursive thought and deluded念. This spirit is pure, still, luminous, and all-pervading, nowhere it does not reach. Though it emerges, it does not depart from the root fundamental wisdom. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *'Without leaving the bodhi tree, one ascends the summit of Mount Sumeru'*—this is the unmoving wisdom that pervades all. Yin spirit is the spirit of stored thoughts and transformations. This spirit varies in function and becomes obstructed wherever it goes. When it emerges, it must depart from the root fundamental wisdom and often dwells near ghosts and spirits. Yang spirit is the way of heaven; yin spirit is the way of ghosts. Yang is numinous awareness, empty and mysterious; yin is dream-thought, inverted and confused. Scholars cannot fail to distinguish between them.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is root fundamental wisdom?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Root fundamental wisdom is the wisdom that existed before the empty kalpa. The Three Powers and the myriad things all embrace it.\"\n\nThis wisdom is neither separate nor conjoined, neither form nor sound, neither existent nor nonexistent, neither emerging nor entering—all sentient beings equally possess it. My body’s birth does not increase it; my body’s death does not diminish it. Without leaving the original seat, it responds and manifests throughout the ten directions; without moving body or mind, it embraces and fuses with all. It mingles with the myriad things yet remains unstained; it engages with the ten thousand affairs yet remains unburdened. Is this not root fundamental wisdom?\n\nSomeone asked: \"The alchemical texts number in the hundreds and thousands, yet they speak only of longevity and rarely address matters of death. Though 'birth' is repeatedly expounded, what of birth and death?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Longevity without death is the Dao of the Supreme Perfection and eternal constancy—it is no empty claim of the ancients. Yet the world, deluded in principle, fails to comprehend the essence of transcendence, often seeking strange marvels and treasuring fortified dwellings. Though scholars number in the tens of thousands, not one attains success. My words on birth and death are precisely to illuminate birth and death, that one may end birth and death—not mere forced speech.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"After your hundred years, will you be as you were in life?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The body is the root of suffering; I discard this body as one discards a boil or wart—this is what is meant by 'delivering from all suffering and distress.' Yet my original nature has never begun or ended; though formless, what expectation could there be?\"\n\nThey said: \"If there is no difference from birth and death, do you still partake in worldly affairs?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Though I do not partake in worldly affairs, the mind that vows to deliver the world has never been absent.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If form cannot be preserved and death cannot be avoided, what use are the golden elixir and the firing times?\"\n\nThe answer: \"All that has form and color in heaven and earth is not exempt from death. The golden elixir is my nature and spirit; the firing times are my yin and yang. Cultivating the golden elixir, one harmonizes virtue with heaven and earth and unites brightness with the sun and moon—what value is there in the dreamlike, illusory form?\"\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Daoist Tradition: All Methods Return to the Same Source, Scroll Three* (concluded)\n*Direct Pointers to the Daoist Tradition: All Methods Return to the Same Source, Scroll Four*\n\nWithin the Jian'an Yangshan Daoist Abbey,\nRecorded by Mu Chang Chao,\nCompiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren\n\n**On the Supreme Polarity**\n\nSomeone asked about categories of the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** The generation of the Three Powers originates from the Supreme Polarity, but from what does the Supreme Polarity itself originate?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity originates from the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** And from what does the Ultimateless originate?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no origin; if it had an origin, it would not be called the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** What is the form of the Ultimateless?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no form; if it had form, it would have a limit.\n\n**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no form, why is it named the Ultimateless?\n\n**Answer:** It cannot be named; we forcefully name it the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** Are the Ultimateless and the Supreme Polarity one or two?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless is the Supreme Polarity’s non-being; the Supreme Polarity is the Ultimateless’s being. They are not two principles.\n\n**Question:** If they involve being and non-being, how can they not be two?\n\n**Answer:** From non-being, being is established; through being, non-being is revealed. They mutually serve as roots—two meanings, yet one principle.\n\n**Question:** The Supreme Polarity originates from non-being and is rooted in stillness. Why then does it have being? Why does it move?\n\n**Answer:** When non-being reaches its limit, being is born; when stillness reaches its limit, movement arises.\n\n**Question:** If non-being and being, movement and stillness, are opposed to the Supreme Polarity, does its original essence still remain?\n\n**Answer:** Being is born from non-being, yet non-being is fundamentally not separate from being. Stillness is born from movement, yet stillness is fundamentally unmoving. The original essence of the Supreme Polarity remains unchanged.\n\n**Question:** Does the Dao of the Supreme Polarity have above and below, inside and outside?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity is without direction; if it had above and below, inside and outside, it would become two Supreme Polarities.\n\n**Question:** If the One has no above or below, why does it have before and after?\n\n**Answer:** Before qi took form, the Supreme Polarity preceded heaven and earth. Once qi was divided, heaven and earth came after the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** Is human nature the same as or different from the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** Human nature is the nature of the Supreme Polarity. If its principle aligns with the Supreme Polarity, it is the same; if its principle differs, it is different.\n\n**Question:** Is the nature of things also the same as the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** Though their forms and vessels differ, their nature is the same.\n\n**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no image, how can it generate the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless is purely principle. From principle arises qi. When qi and principle intermingle, it is called the Supreme Polarity—not that the Ultimateless generates the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity, by contracting, generate yang, and by stillness, generate yin?\n\n**Answer:** When stillness reaches its limit, movement is born; movement, unceasing, generates qi. Qi rooted in stillness is yin; qi rooted in movement is yang. When movement reaches its limit, yin is born; when stillness reaches its limit, yang is born. From beginning to end, it does not depart from movement and stillness.\n\n**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity generate the Two Modes?\n\n**Answer:** Qi and principle envelop each other; yin and yang qualities are complete. What is united must separate, and thus it divides into two. That which is above form becomes heaven; that which is below form becomes earth.\n\n**Question:** How should one practice to align with the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** One must first comprehend the reality of the Supreme Polarity and awaken to the subtleties of principle and qi. Then, silently recognize it and embody it in practice. If one has not grasped this essential point and merely debates over texts or discusses names and principles, it is entirely without benefit.\n\n**Question:** Once this principle is understood, where does one rest?\n\n**Answer:** One rests in perfect stillness. If even a hair’s breadth of selfish desire arises, it is not genuine.\n\n**Question:** The human mind is perilous. How can it be entirely without movement? Would that not make one like wood or stone?\n\n**Answer:** There is a mind of peril, and there is a mind of subtlety. Subtlety is stillness. Curb movement and return to stillness—this is the stillness of the Supreme Polarity. Though there is no movement of thought, it is not the same as wood or stone.\n\n**Question:** Words suffice to convey meaning; why pursue this so exhaustively? Is this not pedantic?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao is what the Three Powers and the myriad things cannot be without for even a moment. If one could be without this Dao, then stars could emerge from the earth, mountains and seas could hang from the sky, spring could become autumn, and winter could become summer. If mere eloquence were the Dao, then the Confucian tradition would not need Confucius, the Chan school would not need Śākyamuni, and the Daoist tradition would not need Laozi.\n\n**Question:** Are the methods of self-cultivation and application in Confucianism the same as those in Daoism and Buddhism?\n\n**Answer:** The methods of self-cultivation are not different; their applications are not without distinction.\n\n**Question:** May I ask for details?\n\n**Answer:** The Confucians cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to govern the world. The Daoists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to preserve form and spirit. The Buddhists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to equalize life and death.\n\n**Question:** If there is fundamentally only one Supreme Polarity, why do the Three Teachings and the hundred schools speak of so many similarities and differences? How is one to understand this?\n\n**Answer:** If one seeks understanding through words and phrases, even after eating three lifetimes’ worth of rice, one will not fully comprehend.\n\n**Question:** Then how is it to be understood?\n\n**Answer:** Unify the One to return to the One; meet its limit to return to its limit.\n\n**Question:** Is it wrong to grasp this mind as the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** At first, one grasps it; upon realization, one lets go. To grasp without letting go is stagnation; to let go without grasping is free flow.\n\n**Question:** If one lets go, does it not fall into neglect?\n\n**Answer:** Letting go into non-action is acceptable; one must not let go into deviance.\n\n**Question:** Does Buddhism also address the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** They speak of \"beginninglessness\" and \"true emptiness\"; these are merely different names for the original nature of the Supreme Polarity. Yet their subtlety surpasses even the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** When heaven and earth divide, the Five Phases and their images and numbers are precise to the finest detail, and the myriad things of human relations are as intricately carved—does this not imply a Creator within the primordial chaos?\n\nThe Supreme Polarity, when yet unformed, conceals the Five Phases and their images and numbers within true nothingness. Once the Supreme Polarity divides, the Five Phases and their images and numbers manifest within wondrous being. The formation of the Three Powers and the nurturing of the myriad things—all arise from the spontaneous operation of the singular qi. For once the Supreme Polarity is established, it cannot but give rise to heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth are established, they cannot but generate images and numbers. Once images and numbers are complete, they cannot but produce human beings and things. Once human beings and things take form, their physical endowments cannot but differ. Once physical endowments differ, their lifespans and destinies cannot but vary. Flourishing and withering, beauty and ugliness, good and evil—these are the natural course of principle, and also the inevitable course of circumstance. Yet the creation of things from formlessness begins with the singular qi, transforming into the ten thousand existences, each conforming to its natural measure. How could there be a creator?\n\n**Question:** At the inception of heaven and earth, which came first—sun and moon, or water and fire?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity divides into one yang and one yin. The Qian Dao is first established, and the two Qian form Kun, establishing the Kun Dao. Splitting the center of Qian yields Li, and the image of the sun is formed. Merging the center of Kun yields Kan, and the image of the moon is formed. The Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams are arrayed, the Five Phases emerge, and the myriad things are born—none of which are not brought forth by water and fire. In the movement of heaven and earth, the sun and moon, the images of water and fire, come first.\n\n**Question:** Does the Dao of heaven have intention?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao is without intention; it takes the hearts of all people as its heart.\n\n**Question:** Yet it is said, \"Stimulated, it penetrates all\"—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Do you understand water? When you approach it, your form and shadow appear of themselves. Do you understand valleys? When you call out, there is always an echo. Do water and valleys have intention?\n\n**Question:** Heaven is said to belong to metal—is it truly metal?\n\n**Answer:** Kun is earth, and it is true earth. Qian is metal—is it not true metal?\n\n**Question:** Below the earth, one looks up to heaven as the pole. Above heaven, where is the pole?\n\n**Answer:** Above, there is only the natural emptiness of the void—it is the pole beyond poles.\n\n**Question:** If so, then heaven and earth have no root or stem?\n\n**Answer:** The singular qi of emptiness naturally transforms and forms them—how could there be a root or stem?\n\n**Question:** The Confucians speak of \"rectifying the heart,\" the Buddhists of \"illuminating the heart,\" and the Daoists of \"emptying the heart\"—are these three the same or different?\n\n**Answer:** \"Thought without deviance\" is rectitude; \"turning the light inward upon oneself\" is illumination; \"private desires unobstructed\" is emptiness. Though called three hearts, they are in truth one principle. From the perspective of worldly people, their teachings differ, but at the level of the sage, there is no difference.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhist teaching says, \"The heart itself is Buddha,\" and also, \"Neither heart nor Buddha\"—are these statements contradictory?\n\n**Answer:** \"The heart itself is Buddha\" is like obtaining the fish or catching the hare. \"Neither heart nor Buddha\" is like forgetting the trap or the snare.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists always speak of the heart, while the Daoists always speak of qi—are the heart and qi one or two?\n\n**Answer:** When the heart moves, qi follows; when qi moves, the heart follows. When the heart is unified, qi is also unified; when qi is unified, the heart is also unified. Yet qi is principle, while the heart is the mechanism of principle. All great undertakings proceed from our heart.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists say that all hearts speak of emptiness—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Only through emptiness can one contain the ten thousand things.\n\n**Question:** If it contains the ten thousand things, then it is not empty.\n\n**Answer:** To contain the ten thousand things without obstructing them is like the great void embracing all things—it is not hindered by the vastness of space.\n\n**Question:** The heart has principle and has realm—what are principle and realm?\n\n**Answer:** \"Essence and unity\" are the principle of the heart. \"Affairs and things\" are the realm of the heart. \"Subtle, wondrous, and spiritually penetrating, unobstructed by things\"—this is the principle of the heart. \"Floating, restless, and competitive, chasing after forms\"—this is the realm of the heart.\n\n**Question:** If the heart moves once, one stops it; if it moves again, one stops it again—can this be the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** This is precisely the appearance of ceaseless arising and ceasing. One must stop it so that it does not move repeatedly. With long practice and discipline, when it is thoroughly tamed, it then becomes a single whole.\n\n**Question:** Is becoming a single whole the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** If at this point one clings to it as the Dao, it is like grasping a water-seeking mirror to obtain water. Not only will one fail to get water, but one will ultimately be hindered by the object. How much better to forget both!\n\n**Question:** Did the sages of old who illuminated the heart all attain this?\n\n**Answer:** Those who do not reach this level are not worthy of the name Dao.\n\n**Question:** People say that each heart is different—can this differing principle also become the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** All may be called the Dao, but they do not reach the level of the sage.\n\n**Question:** Some people begin good and end evil, while others begin evil and end good—is this not a matter of habit becoming nature?\n\n**Answer:** It is indeed formed by habit, all due to a lack of careful self-control. Those who begin good and end evil descend from human relationships to the level of beasts. Those who begin evil and end good rise from the level of beasts to human relationships.\n\n**Question:** For the hundred diseases, there are medicinal remedies. What remedies the sickness of the heart?\n\n**Answer:** The sickness of the heart is remedied by principle.\n\n**Question:** What if there are those who do not accept the remedy of principle?\n\n**Answer:** If the source of the sickness runs deep, one must apply the painful needle and moxa. If it does not heal, then death is all that remains.\n\n**Question:** When the heart is not at peace, what should one do?\n\n**Answer:** It is only because your thoughts do not cease and your delusions do not stop.\n\n**Question:** The heart and nature are but a single principle—is there a nature outside the heart?\n\n**Answer:** Nature is the substance of the heart; the heart is the function of nature. Nature is still; the heart is active. When the function of the heart is not moved, the substance of nature merges and harmonizes. The foolish seek nature outside the heart, while the wise see that nature is the heart—there is no other.\n\n**Answer:** It is only this square inch of space that is the heart—there is no heart outside this square inch.\n\n**Answer:** The square inch is the pivot of the heart’s mechanism. This heart pervades the vastness of space and the six directions; when the pivot moves, the heart moves; when the pivot is still, the heart is still. To seek the heart beyond the square inch is not the heart. To cling to the square inch as the heart is also not so.\n\n**Question:** The heart is but a single principle, yet it is also called the enclosure of all principles—why?\n\n**Answer:** The heavens have but one moon, yet its reflection appears in ten thousand waters. A person has but one heart, yet affairs manifest in ten thousand forms. Yet the moon in ten thousand waters is gathered into one moon; the heart in ten thousand affairs is gathered into one heart. Is this not the heart as their enclosure?\n\n**Question:** The Confucians say: \"Only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stability does one attain stillness; only after stillness does one attain peace; only after peace does one attain contemplation; only after contemplation does one attain attainment.\" The Buddhists also speak of stability and stillness, yet they say there is not a single dharma to be attained—why?\n\n**Answer:** The Confucians take stopping, stability, and stillness as the root, and peace, contemplation, and attainment as the branch. If one does not pacify the heart and refine contemplation, the virtue of utmost goodness cannot be made manifest. If the virtue of utmost goodness is not manifest, the world cannot be governed. The Buddhists are not thus: only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stillness does one attain peace—necessarily, this heart is without contemplation and unattainable, reaching the state of profound emptiness and quiescence. That contemplation attains the governance of the world is the natural principle. That without contemplation one enters the empty gate unattainable is also the natural principle.\n\n**Question:** The *Book of Documents* says: \"The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle.\" Are the human heart and the Dao-heart necessarily two different things?\n\n**Answer:** Perilous is movement; subtle is stillness. When the human heart is still, it is the Dao-heart. When the Dao-heart moves, it is the human heart. It is but a single heart—through movement and stillness it is divided into perilous and subtle.\n\n**Question:** The Way of heaven and earth—must it not depart from movement and stillness?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate establishes heaven and earth through movement and stillness. For every odd there is an even; for every host there is a guest. The Three Powers and the myriad things cannot for a moment depart from movement and stillness. What can depart is not the Way.\n\n**Question:** Why does the Way necessarily emphasize stillness?\n\n**Answer:** Because of the functioning of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the utmost Way emphasizes stillness.\n\n**Question:** Does the Way of utmost stillness, in relation to the movement and stillness of the Three Powers and the myriad things, have separation or union?\n\n**Answer:** Utmost stillness refers to the original substance of the Limitless. From this original substance arises the wondrous transformation of production and change—it does not mean there is something separate from the original substance, nor does it mean merging with the original substance to become indistinct. Before the two qi of yin and yang sprout, this principle is quiescent and unmoving. When the two mechanisms of movement and stillness intermingle, this principle responds and thus communicates.\n\n**Question:** Movement and stillness do not depart from the two qi—this the world knows. But the utmost stillness that does not move, this I truly do not understand.\n\n**Answer:** Alternation and decline, coming and going—these are the qi of yin and yang. Thus the myriad things depend on them for life and death; day and night depend on them for brightness and darkness. If there were no principle of non-movement in the world, the Way of the sages would rise and fall with yin and yang, come and go with life and death—what worth would it have?\n\n**Question:** Is there a principle of non-movement in the human heart?\n\n**Answer:** The principle of non-movement in the human heart is the same as the principle of non-movement in heaven and earth.\n\n**Question:** Beyond the principle of non-movement, is there another wondrous principle?\n\n**Answer:** To govern the Three Powers and equalize life and death—this is that principle.\n\n**Question:** The Buddha speaks of emptiness of nature; Mencius speaks of goodness of nature; Xunzi speaks of evil of nature; Yangzi speaks of the mixture of good and evil in nature. Is nature not one, differing only between humans and other beings?\n\n**Answer:** Emptiness is the wondrousness of nature; goodness is the root of nature. The others have lost this wondrous root. Nature is what all things universally possess. Humans attain its wondrous root yet do not know how to use it; other beings lose its wondrous root yet use it unknowingly. It lies in the difference between attainment and loss—how could there be a distinction of good and evil?\n\n**Question:** You often say the human body is a temporary convergence. Yet this body of mine has not a single hair that is an external thing—why call it a temporary convergence?\n\n**Answer:** First, it borrows the essence and blood of father and mother; next, it borrows the two qi of yin and yang. In the womb, it borrows the mother’s breath; after birth, it borrows the mother’s milk. The eyes borrow the sun and moon for brightness; life borrows food and drink to sustain it; the ears borrow sound to hear; the nose borrows fragrance to smell; the tongue borrows taste to savor; the body borrows clothing for adornment; the mind borrows knowledge to think; heat borrows wind to cool; cold borrows fire to warm. From the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, nothing is not borrowed. If even one thing were not borrowed, it would not be a complete person. Among the myriad things in heaven and earth, none are not empty and borrowed yet exist. You say there is not a single hair that is an external thing—is this not delusion?\n\n**Question:** Since the body is a temporary convergence, why then are seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smelling with the nose, tasting with the tongue, grasping with the hands, and walking with the feet—all these functions—mine?\n\n**Answer:** It is like the wooden puppet made by the craftsman Yan: is it not also borrowed from lacquer and wood? When assembled, it takes form; when scattered, it has no appearance. This body of ours, in life, borrows it for use; in death, discards it unknowingly. If it were not borrowed, it would not die when assembled. Since it is borrowed and dies, where is the use of \"I\"?\n\n**Question:** If the body is all borrowed, what is real?\n\n**Answer:** Not only is the human body borrowed—all things and affairs in the world are without exception borrowed. What is not borrowed is only the principle of nature.\n\n**Question:** If all things and affairs are borrowed, are heaven, earth, and human relationships also borrowed?\n\n**Answer:** All things with form, appearance, sound, and color belong to the borrowed. Though heaven and earth are enduring vessels, they too cannot escape being borrowed.\n\nHuman relationships—ruler and minister, father and mother, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, children—along with houses and fields, goods and wealth, servants and slaves, and all daily necessities, are without exception temporary assemblages. While this body of mine endures, these things exist; when this body perishes, they cease to be. Were they not temporary assemblages, both I and these things could be preserved forever. That which cannot be preserved forever—what is it if not temporary?\n\n**Question:** If heaven, earth, and human relationships are all temporary, then by what Dao should one cherish them?\n\n**Answer:** We borrow heaven and earth for their shelter and support, borrow ruler and minister for governance and order, borrow father and mother for birth and nurture, borrow brothers for friendship and aid, borrow wife and children for posterity, borrow fields and gardens for sustenance, and borrow wealth, goods, servants, and slaves for practical use. While I have a body, I am close to them; when I have no body, I am distant. Judging by this, what is not temporary? The world cherishes things—this is how I cherish the Dao.\n\n**Question:** Is the human heart also temporary?\n\n**Answer:** Those who grasp its temporariness see it as temporary; those who grasp its reality see it as real. In all the world, that which is not temporary is rare indeed.\n\n**Question:** The human heart has no form—what can it borrow?\n\n**Answer:** If one reaches the state of no temporariness, then it is not temporary. But if even a trace of emotion remains, or a trace of attachment to things lingers, one cannot escape temporariness.\n\n**Someone asked:** Confucius said, *\"If I cannot yet serve men, how can I serve ghosts? If I do not yet know life, how can I know death?\"* Did Confucius not understand this?\n\n**Answer:** Ghosts and spirits have no form yet keep their word; life and death follow fate and remain constant. Confucius was not ignorant of this—he simply did not speak of it often in his teachings of worldly governance, lest he confuse the world. When Ji Shi pressed him with such questions, he answered as he did. Had Gautama or Laozi asked, he would not have answered thus.\n\n**Question:** Did only Gautama and Laozi understand life, death, ghosts, and spirits?\n\n**Answer:** That which returns after death is called a ghost; that which abides in life is called a spirit. Ghosts, spirits, life, and death are one and the same principle. Those who deny life and death also deny ghosts and spirits; those who understand ghosts and spirits understand life and death. The enlightened know this—why must it be Gautama or Laozi?\n\n**Someone asked:** You often speak of the impermanence of all things—what does this mean?\n\n**Answer:** *\"Permanent\"* means enduring, unchanging. All things arise and perish in illusion—they cannot last forever. Hence, they are called impermanent.\n\n**Question:** Even those who cultivate the Way cannot escape impermanence—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Without exception, this body is a vessel of blood and pus. Youth inevitably ages, life inevitably ends in death. Thus, the sage transcends the body to preserve it—how could they alone escape impermanence?\n\n**Someone further asked:** If impermanence cannot be escaped, why cultivate the Way?\n\n**Answer:** Cultivate my conduct to align with the sage’s conduct. Cultivate my heart to align with the sage’s heart. There is no other pursuit.\n\n**Someone asked:** Among Confucius, Laozi, and the Buddha, who is superior?\n\n**Answer:** Like a physician’s shopfront—its success depends on who opens it. Their hearts are equally devoted to saving lives. I cannot judge their superiority.\n\n**Someone asked:** You often speak of *\"the one matter beyond all others, which a thousand sages did not transmit\"*—is this not your delusion?\n\nIf it is untransmitted, why then speak of *\"a special transmission outside the teachings\"*?\n\n**Answer:** The principle of this special transmission does not involve scriptures or doctrines. The worldly fail to awaken and stubbornly demand answers from others, unaware of turning inward. Everywhere under heaven—wherever one’s head or face may turn—nothing is not the Great Dao. Whatever is casually grasped is a treasure. To seek further for this special transmission is surely mistaken.\n\n**Question:** The scriptures say that those who awaken may transmit the sagely Way. Does this not mean there *is* transmission?\n\n**Answer:** Only upon awakening does one realize it is one’s own possession, and thus may transmit it to the sagely Way. Without true awakening, what is there to transmit?\n\n**Someone asked:** Can those who maintain a vegetarian fast and abstain from meat attain the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Fasting is merely the precept against killing. If one eats only vegetables yet does not sever the mind of killing, it is ultimately of no benefit.\n\n**Further asked:** Can upholding the precepts lead to attaining the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Precepts serve to guard against evil. All sages and worthies attained the Dao through precepts. Yet without severing the mind of evil, it is also of no benefit.\n\n**Someone asked:** When a practitioner of cultivation dies, do they re-enter the womb?\n\n**Answer:** Only when one becomes master of the body will they not re-enter at death.\n\n**Question:** How does one become master and avoid re-entry?\n\n**Answer:** Through lifelong cultivation and realization, with steadfast concentration, one thoroughly recognizes the original nature. At the moment of death, the mind remains undisturbed. Then one becomes master of the body and does not re-enter.\n\n**Someone asked:** Before parents were born, where was this body?\n\n**Answer:** Before parents existed, there was clearly nothing. Only through the union of conditions did the womb form, and the burden of form and substance arose.\n\n**Question:** When form and substance perish, where does this body go?\n\n**Answer:** It returns to the same state as before birth—clearly nothing.\n\n**Question:** If there is nothing, then there is no existence. Why then speak of rebirth?\n\n**Answer:** Fire has no inherent form; wood is its root. Bubbles have no inherent form; water is their root. Humans have no inherent form; parents are their root. How could they not be born?\n\n**Further asked:** Does rebirth exist or not?\n\n**Answer:** Those who act with the mind of beasts will, upon death, become beasts. Those who live with the mind of humans or heavenly beings will, upon death, return to humans or heaven. This is an unchanging principle—how can there be no rebirth?\n\n**Question:** Do *you* undergo rebirth?\n\n**Answer:** If I possess the mind of rebirth, I cannot escape it. If I am without the mind of rebirth, I will not fall into it.\n\n**Someone asked:** Where do you go after death, having cultivated the Way?\n\n**Answer:** I will neither be born in heaven nor descend to hell, neither remain in the Southern Continent nor depart to the Western Land.\n\n**Question:** Then where do you go?\n\n**Answer:** Abiding in stillness, unmoving, without coming or going, pure and originally so, pervading the Dharma realm. With the body of liberated meaning, I am free and at ease.\n\n**Someone asked:** Ghosts and spirits have no form—they appear as mere emptiness. Why then are there ghosts and spirits?\n\n**Answer:** Beings of blood and qi possess form and thought. Wood and stone possess form but no thought. Ghosts and spirits possess no form but have thought. *Form* refers to material obstruction; *thought* refers to latent perception. Though ghosts and spirits lack material obstruction, their consciousness and perception are the same as in beings. Just as a person’s latent thought can dwell in form and linger, traveling ten thousand miles in an instant—whether in pursuit of fame, wealth, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, or grief—all is as if personally experienced. The way of ghosts and spirits is precisely thus.\n\n**Someone asked about supernatural powers.**\n\n**Answer:** The spirit is the wondrous, awakened essence of nature. Among the three realms and the myriad things, it arrives without haste and pervades without movement. It can conceal heaven and extend heaven’s lifespan, conceal earth and extend earth’s lifespan. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning. The sun, moon, and stars; wind, clouds, and weather; metal, stone, grass, and trees; mountains, rivers, and seas—among the eighty-four thousand teachings of right and wrong, none can obstruct its spirit. Unhindered in all directions, it is called *tong* (penetration). This can be known through inner realization, but is difficult to exhaust in words.\n\n**Someone asked:** Are the principles of the Golden Elixir and Buddha-nature the same or different?\n\n**Answer:** Though the Buddha entered through the nature school, he never departed from the life school. How do we know this? The Buddha’s teachings always begin in the East and circulate through the ten directions. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly enumerates tens of distinctions—five celestial numbers and five terrestrial numbers. The fifty-three spiritual advisors visited by Sudhana, including himself and Vairocana, total fifty-five—does this not correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth? Moreover, the *Lotus Sūtra* speaks of two Buddhas in one stupa. The dragon girl transforms and becomes a Buddha in the South—*dragon* is *qian* (☰), *South* is *li* (☲). Is this not *qian*’s middle yin becoming *li*? Transforming from female to male—is this not *kun*’s (☷) middle yang becoming *kan* (☵)? The wonders of *qian*, *li*, *kun*, and *kan* are subtly concealed within. Further examples: the four-line verse and the one form; the two honored ones; the twin trees of the twin forests; the two adornments and two wisdoms; the swastika on the chest; the twin wheels on the feet. Are these not all expressions of the interpenetration of nature and life? From this, we know that Buddha-nature is no different from the Golden Elixir. Those who claim the Buddha belongs solely to the nature school are merely shallow scholars of inferior understanding.\n\n**Someone asked:** Does the cultivation and nurturing in Chan practice also align with the Golden Elixir?\n\n**Answer:** The Chan school takes awakening as its principle. Those of the highest capacity attain Buddhahood in a single awakening. Without traversing paths or engaging with yin and yang, where mind and action cease, and words and speech are cut off—this is the pure wonder of true emptiness. This is the supreme vehicle, difficult for lesser learners to reach. The method of Chan sitting in silent contemplation is roughly similar to fetal breathing and breath retention, and its nurturing is not far different. Moreover, the Chan school has the matter of \"after the barrier is opened,\" such as a minister bowing to the emperor or a child approaching the father—this is the wonder of a single pulse with dual perfection, the same as the principle of return and reversal in the Golden Elixir.\n\n**Question:** What is the difference between \"true emptiness\" and \"stubborn emptiness\"?\n\n**Answer:** \"True emptiness\" refers to the mysterious, numinous, and unobstructed. \"Stubborn emptiness\" refers to dead ashes and withered wood. Stillness without movement is the essence of true emptiness; responsiveness without obstruction is its function. As for stubborn emptiness, it is a thing of annihilation, devoid of nature, lifeless and inert.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhist school exhaustively discusses emptiness and nothingness, asserting that the four elements, six senses, consciousness, and perception are not truly ours. Then what is the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Before our parents were born, this form did not exist. After birth, the six senses and four elements arose, and with them, consciousness and perception. All that constitutes this body is illusory, a temporary aggregation. Observing its origin, it was fundamentally nonexistent—this is not mere rhetoric from the Buddhist school. Their exhaustive discussion of emptiness and nothingness aims only to align the essence of the heart-mind with the great void, ensuring not even a thread of worldly burden clings to it. This is their Dao.\n\n**Question:** Is the supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir the same?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao of the perfected immortals is no different. Laozi said: *\"Observe emptiness as empty; the emptiness of emptiness is empty. When what is emptied is nonexistent, even ‘nothing’ is nonexistent.\"* What could be more extreme in emptiness and nothingness than this?\n\n**Question:** The *Heart Sutra* says, *\"Illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty.\"* Does the practice of the Elixir reach this state?\n\n**Answer:** The first line speaks of *\"Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.\"* *\"Observing\"* means reflecting inwardly upon the heart-mind, free and at ease. Next, *\"illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty\"*—at the moment of observing the heart-mind, one directly perceives that the five heaps of this body are utterly empty, leaving only a single spark of original yang wisdom, luminous and unwavering. These two lines are beyond the reach of heavenly and earthly paths, revealing the Buddhist school’s mastery. For *\"observing\"* is concentration, and *\"illuminating\"* is wisdom. All sages and worthies attain the Dao through observation and illumination. How could the method of the Elixir be otherwise? This is indeed the Dao of the perfected immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Golden Elixir Verses**\n\nThe Returned Elixir is nothing but true gold and fire;\nGold is original essence, fire is the heart-mind.\nSpirit-fire and essence-gold refine each other,\nTrue gold melts into fire, fire fuses with gold.\n\nIf fire blazes too fiercely, the gold’s qi dissipates;\nIf gold is stubborn and fire

free of dust,\nThe waves of concentration’s water settle, and the moon of wisdom shines.\nAlone, it illuminates, ever luminous and unwavering—\nThe Returned Elixir may be perfected directly.\n\nDiscipline severs the hundred evils and removes all wrongs;\nConcentration halts dispersion and gathers the numinous.\nThe lamp of wisdom reverses the illumination of dark paths—\nWhy fear the waters of the Flower Pool remain impure?\n\nIn refining the Elixir, discipline comes first;\nTo govern dispersion, rely solely on concentration’s steadfast power.\nTo brighten the ailment of darkness, wisdom’s illumination is needed—\nMastering these three is called immortal Chan.\n\nThe iron ox and wooden horse circle the long river,\nThe stone tiger and mud dragon sing in grand chorus.\nThe four beasts—where have they gone?\nIn vain, one waves and calls to the Yellow Dame.\n\nThe six bandits are captured and brought to the mercury chamber,\nThe five aggregates are seized and

traversed at will.\n\nThe golden liquid descends from *Li*,\nThe yang essence ascends from *Kan*.\n*Kan* and *Li* return to the one *qi*,\nThe waxing and waning moons stand balanced.\n\nThe outer medicine is the *qi* of the Great Void,\nThe inner elixir, the Mysterious Female’s gate.\nPierce the root of the Great Void\nWith the cave of my Mysterious Female.\n\nThe two principles must be clearly united,\nThe three passes must be truly opened.\nThe moon emerges from the azure sea,\nThe sun reddens above the mountain’s crest.\n\nIn silent stillness, the true is embraced,\nIn profound obscurity, the One is held.\nWithdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating—\nLet none but the heart itself know.\n\nWhen the two *qi* penetrate the three passes,\nThe Three Corpses shiver in cold.\nThe Yellow Hall issues its stern decree,\nThe Five Thieves report peace.\n\nTrue emptiness contains wondrous being,\nWondrous being merges with true emptiness.\nEmptiness and being fuse without obstruction,\nTogether returning to the realm of silent illumination.\n\nDragon and tiger cease their strife,\nTortoise and snake end their toil.\nThe Yellow Dame, free of intent and wisdom,\nUnmoving, gives birth to the Mysterious Pearl.\n\nThe body nurtured by father and mother\nIs naught but yin’s filth and defilement.\nShould the child seek to learn longevity,\nThere is another true threefold mystery.\n\nBirth and extinction are but ignorance,\nThe round and penetrating body is originally pure.\nShould one know the method of transcendence,\nSeek the unborn beyond form.\n\nThe unborn gives birth to all,\nExtinction is not the true Dao.\nClinging to the separation of spirit and form,\nHow can one equal the spring beyond kalpas?\n\nThat which has form is not eternal,\nThat which is without emotion knows no final decay.\nBeyond things, transcending appearances,\nWhy cherish the floating dust?\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Dao: The Ten Thousand Dharmas Return

Benren of Yishan**\n\n**Two Poems on the Elixir Ancestor**\n\nThere is an Ancestor of the Golden Elixir,\nEver abiding within the ten thousand images.\nHeaven and Earth are called its father,\nSun and Moon are named its elder.\nMaster of the spirits of all kinds,\nRoot of the nature and life of all beings.\nShould one comprehend this,\nOne may speak of the elixir’s work.\n\nTo learn the Golden Elixir’s initial task,\nBegin first with the Supreme Ultimate and the Qian Dragon.\nXun is the maiden, originally dwelling in Zhen,\nKun gives birth to the infant, lodged in Dui’s palace.\nCrow and Hare, Tiger and Dragon form images beyond,\nMercury and Lead, Water and Fire reside within the body.\nWho can fathom Geng, Ding, Xin, and Bing?\nAsk the Primordial Elder of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Five Poems on Illusory Existence**\n\nWhere was there self before father and mother were born?\nThrough deluded movement, form first took shape.\nThe six roots and four great elements cling together,\nReceiving yin and yang, called a human being.\nEyes, ears, nose, and tongue each serve their function,\nColor, sound, fragrance, and taste all falsely abide.\nThe body is the dwelling of greed, anger, folly, and desire,\nThe mouth is the gate of eating, drinking, and right and wrong.\nEarth, water, fire, and wind joyfully unite in illusion,\nWife and children, gold and treasure briefly seem dear.\nThis body borrows the qi of yin and intestines,\nWhen qi perishes, where was this body ever real?\nAll things in this body are naught but illusion,\nOnly the single spark of primordial yang is numinous.\nCalled the indestructible vajra,\nThrough a hundred refinements, it grows ever more luminous.\nAll things in the world are but illusory existence,\nFrom the beginning of the prior heaven, they were originally none.\nShould one awaken to illusion and return to true nature,\nOne is a great man in the world of men.\n\n**Five Poems of Admonition**\n\nIf the ten evils of body and mind are not eradicated,\nCultivation is but wasted effort.\nThis is the seed of the six destinies’ wheel,\nTo seek immortality is but a dream.\n\nWine, lust, anger, wealth, and craving—\nIf even a trace remains, the Dao is hard to approach.\nThis is the mouth of a ten-thousand-fathom abyss,\nHow many in Jambudvīpa has it ensnared?\n\nA speck of dust burdens the heart, and it is not enlightened,\nHalf a mote of anger or folly, and the Dao is not attained.\nOnly when originally there is not a single thing,\nMay one meet and speak of the unborn.\n\nTo eat one’s fill of meat, garlic, and the five pungents\nIs called strengthening qi and nourishing spirit.\nThe arts of nine-and-one yin absorption are but side doors,\nAll are causes for future hell.\n\nThe ancients avoided desire as they avoided arrows,\nOr as one shuns a deep pit or a poisonous snake.\nIf one does not avoid it, one must lose one’s life—\nHow then can one find leisure to inquire of cinnabar?\n\n**Five Poems on Avoiding Harm**\n\nBury light, conceal shadow, hide one’s mechanism,\nLet not dragon, snake, tiger, or leopard know.\nHonor and disgrace are both snares,\nHow much more when one lacks kin to avoid the Zhou era’s perils?\n\nFame and profit are nooses around the throat,\nWealth and nobility are like shackles on the hands.\nFortunate is one free from the bonds of throat and hands—\nIn the depths of mountain clouds, one nurtures the rare and subtle.\n\nMisfortune first, fortune follows—act not,\nThe blazing power of the halls of might—approach not.\nOnly bind oneself to the companionship of apes and cranes in green mountains,\nLet others laugh at me as foolish.\n\nWorldly toil, inch by inch, is a pitfall for men,\nEverywhere, cast aside your weapons and move not recklessly.\nThe six desires and five properties must be shunned,\nAbide in peace, follow fate, and delight in one’s life.\n\nTo attain the art of longevity in cultivation,\nFirst learn the way of preserving the body and avoiding harm.\nFish must hide deeply where hooks cannot reach,\nBirds must soar high where arrows cannot wound.\n\n**Five Poems on Equalizing Self and Things**\n\nShould one wish to cultivate and learn the utmost truth,\nForget the heart, forget things, forget even emotion.\nIf the slightest hindrance lingers in the breast,\nThe ten thousand images, dense and manifold, will never be at peace.\n\nWhen I forget mechanism, things forget mechanism,\nWhen self and things forget each other, all seems lost.\nBirds sing of themselves, flowers fall of themselves—\nWho knows the message therein?\n\nThe four marks in the Buddha’s sutras must be none,\nThe three voids of Laozi must coincide.\nLife and death, existence and extinction are of one body—\nWhere then can I seek my present self?\n\nThe three powers share one root, things share one origin,\nWithin the Supreme Ultimate’s vast embrace, who is self, who is other?\nI know not even that this body is myself—\nFrom what place then arise estrangement and kinship?\n\nAmid the ten thousand images, the body alone stands revealed,\nBody and heart, the ten thousand images—all are at leisure.\nThe ancient and wondrous secret is not many—\nWherever one is without heart, there is the great return.\n\n**Five Poems on Returning to the Real**\n\nThe four great elements, six roots, and consciousness—\nSpeech, breath, all are not real.\nWhen all is released from the body,\nFrom where then arises this self?\n\nThe prior heaven’s Supreme Ultimate originally had no thing,\nThis form of mine is but deluded arising.\nIf perception, hearing, and seeing are not grasped,\nWho then can bear sorrow, joy, suffering, or bliss?\n\nHeaven and Earth, the ten thousand things—originally not existent,\nDreamlike forms and bodies—all are false.\nOnly the great, perfect, equal wisdom\nAdmits no emotion, knowledge, or heart’s knowing.\n\nThe wondrous secret of returning to the real lies in constant capacity,\nNot knowing the constant, deluded action brings misfortune.\nTo recognize that ancient and present are one constant body,\nWondrously fuse the ten thousand dharmas in the midst of the midst.\n\nBeyond the body, the real is preserved,\nWhere there is no thing, the real is not unreal.\nWhen heart and realm fuse in utter stillness,\nOnly then does one see the original person.\n\n**Five Poems on Shattering Attachments**\n\nWhen Zhun and Meng have not yet settled dawn and dusk,\nI urge men of this age not to speak recklessly.\nIn a moment’s effort, the elixir may be congealed—\nFive years, nine years are but empty transmission.\n\nGrasp the mystery of Qian, Li, Kun, and Kan,\nWhy labor to circulate the heavens according to the trigrams?\nSimply take the single flavor of primordial yang fire,\nRefine it to the void before the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nTo seek a steed by following a picture is but wasted effort,\nTo cling to forms and be bound by texts is vain labor.\nI tell those who would learn immortality:\nAt midnight by the sea gate, the sun is red.\n\nRecognize the single true spark of primordial yang,\nThe five phases and eight trigrams are but empty divisions.\nThere is a thing, formed before heaven and earth,\nWhy trouble to seek Wu and Wen?\n\nEasy to speak of, hard to do,\nTo learn the books of the elixir is not the elixir.\nWearing out straw sandals in vain search,\nIt is attained only in a moment’s time.\n\n**Five Poems on Teachings and Instructions**\n\nThroughout the dharma realm, all is the great Dao,\nYet fools still seek it in the Great Brahma Heaven.\nThey know not that the Primordial Beginning’s Floating Black Soil\nIs but the inch-long heart of sentient beings.\n\nThe ancients provisionally set forth teachings and instructions\nTo guide the common stream toward the sagely current.\nHad the purple paths not been adorned with flowers like brocade,\nHow would the noble scions have come to vie in their sport?\n\nCranes cry, phoenixes sing, displaying fine sounds,\nDragons descend, tigers crouch, ghosts and spirits revere.\n\nSeek the mysterious mechanism within the numinous terrace,\nNot in silk scrolls or painted wrappings.\nAlign the texts, seal them with layered imprints,\nAnd in an instant, the imperial talisman takes flight.\n\nIf the subtle mechanism of stillness and response remains ungrasped,\nThe Three Heavens will not permit casual passage.\nThe world’s practitioners prize the spirit’s essence,\nFor only through spirit can one merge with the true Dao.\n\nThose who chase mere deportment and sensual allure\nAre but deceived unto their ruin.\n**Twelve Poems on the Wutong Tree**\n\nO people of the world, awaken!\nThis rare human form must not be squandered—\nLet no time slip by in vain.\nThe Penglai Isle lies not beyond the inch-long heart,\nYet how many pass it by unknowing?\nI urge you: seek the path of longevity early.\n\nBegin your practice now, heed this counsel.\nBlack hair and rosy cheeks soon fade,\nTime flows like a rushing stream.\nWife and child, gold and treasure—fleeting encounters all,\nFor when the hour comes, what can you take?\nCast aside these entangling cares.\n\nThis human birth was a grievous error—\nDo not trust the foolish who persist in evil,\nWhile the virtuous reap joy.\nFortunate are those born in the Central Kingdom,\nWho hear early and turn to study the mysterious learning—\nBe not bound by worldly toil.\n\nO seekers of the Dao, know the truth:\nYou must recognize the Primordial One,\nNot seek it without.\nAt first, a single qi shaped your form,\nCombining yin and yang to birth the ten thousand things—\nThis body truly issued from the Mysterious Origin.\n\nMercury is the heart, lead is the qi,\nTheir union forges the root of the elixir,\nBorn in the southwest.\nKan and Li, dragon and tiger—all arise from this,\nFor life and destiny, yin and yang, are but this.\nI urge you: attend to it early.\n\nGuard the true origin, focus the single qi,\nNurture the infant within your body\nUntil the ten-month gestation is complete.\nAll metaphors fall short—\nThe great matter rests in the realm of heart and mind.\nTo seek without is but vain labor.\n\nThis golden elixir follows no second Way—\nWithin a single inch, true water and fire never part.\nBefore their inversion,\nToil not in their midst,\nFor breath reaches from sea’s depths to heaven’s heart,\nRevealing the treasure of long life.\n\nThis elixir’s root must be firmly bound;\nWhere thought stirs, the numinous elixir flees.\nSeal it tight, let no leakage be.\nA continuous qi pierces the three barriers,\nTurning the celestial wheel to tend the fire’s timing—\nThe golden tripod encircled by toad’s radiance.\n\nThe Dao holds no other:\nThe heart is master.\nClinging to forms and texts brings only self-inflicted suffering.\nHeed the immortals’ words:\nThough elixir scriptures speak in myriad metaphors,\nThey all distill to yin and yang’s two words.\nSeek the root’s source.\n\nSeekers of the mystery, hear this charge:\nA hundred years of light pass swift as thought,\nBlossoms open and fall in the blink of an eye.\nIf the great cause and karmic conditions remain unripe,\nHasten to awaken, open mind and sight—\nLet no false masters lead you astray.\n\nStudy non-action, leave the dusty world,\nWeave grass for a hut amid green mountains and waters,\nCarefree and unbound.\nWatch the jade-like ox on South Mountain,\nMan and ox rejoicing in their mutual familiarity—\nCast off the straw cloak and blow a tune.\n\nVast and untrammeled, without contrivance.\n\nWander carefree, drink and peck at will—\nTruly, this is pure peace and joy.\nThroat and hands free of fame and profit’s snares,\nA thousand miles of lone clouds and wild cranes—\nWho understands this state of awareness?\n\n*Five Western River Moon Poems*\n\nThe great Dao needs no other thing,\nOnly the heart’s steadfast practice.\nThe moment a thought stirs, mercury and lead take flight—\nSimply still the mind and focus the qi.\nKill, steal, lust, and deceit must not be indulged,\nProfit, fame, love, and attachment must not delude.\nA mind without thoughts, a life without affairs—\nThis is the foundation of the elixir.\nThe truth, once revealed, is simple indeed.\n\nHow many seek trigrams and images without,\nYet fail to turn inward and reflect on the true source?\nThis body is the very gate of the *Yi*.\nDay and night, Kan and Li ceaselessly revolve.\n\nCrow and hare, horse and ox, dragon and tiger—\nAll are but metaphors for the root.\nBefore *Zhun* and *Meng* settle into dawn or dusk,\nFix the will and concentrate the mind as the foundation.\n\nWith single-minded focus, the Central Palace remains unmoved,\nThe four directions and four beasts submit as ministers.\nInner elixir and outer medicine merge with celestial truth—\nA perfect wheel of the precious mirror appears.\n\nThis scene, this moment, this place,\nWithout mind, without self, without others—\nWho knows the original heart?\nThe profound stillness of the true and constant wonder.\n\nThe Śākya’s sutras, vinaya, and treatises,\nThe Confucians’ records, poems, and books,\nLord Lao’s thirty-six true talismans—\nAll speak but of the two words: *one mind*.\n\nOnce the mind-ground is illuminated,\nWhat need for all the rest, mere dust and straw?\nForget form, forget qi—all returns to emptiness.\nHere, the truth is no mere metaphor.\n\nThe four great elements compose this borrowed body,\nThe six senses and five aggregates are yin’s deceit.\nWhere the primordial yang abides is my true home—\nDo not mistake the body’s wild horses for the self.\n\nThe inner court’s divine capital must be exited,\nHeaven and hell are but empty flowers.\nThis mystery, so profound and remote—\nWho knows its wondrous workings?\n\n*Five Riverside Immortal Poems*\n\nAt midnight, the golden crow rises from the sea’s depths,\nAt the hour of Chou, it gradually emerges from Fusang.\nGreat brightness turns eastward, belonging to the three yangs.\nVernal splendor fills the courtyard with spring,\nNo place untouched by its radiance.\n\nDirectly ride the river chariot to the imperial palace,\nDrink the jade nectar in the Niwan Palace.\nThe divine water of the Flower Pool bathes the central yellow—\nThe infant not yet united with the mother,\nEarth endures, heaven stretches ever longer.\n\nSeize every month within a single year,\nReturn in but a fleeting moment.\nKan and Li unite, tiger and dragon commune.\nThe three flowers gather in the crucible,\nIn an instant, the divine power manifests.\n\nThe earth teems with yellow sprouts and white snow,\nRadiance surges east, west, south, and north.\nThe two strings round and merge, Jia and Geng as one.\nThe black pearl first emerges from the water,\nIts flame and wisdom naturally consume the void.\n\nShatter this yang furnace and yin crucible,\nLeap beyond black mercury and red lead.\nTortoise and snake, dragon and tiger—all empty words.\nThe six roots and four great elements,\nYin’s illusions—cast them all aside.\n\nThere is a natural, true, singular essence,\nNeither heart nor kidney nor mystery.\nIt cannot be transmitted by mouth, intent, or perception.\nTo reach the elixir’s perfection thus,\nIs to be called a Great Luo Immortal.\n\nAbsorb qi, swallow essence, ingest the seven luminaries,\nStore thoughts to transform the three vehicles.\nFly the Big Dipper, spray water, scatter blossoms.\nDiligently compose verses to present,\nRecite and sip the flowing rosy clouds.\n\nWhat concern have external affairs with the inner realm?\nHow distant are the labors of contrivance!\nThough you perform blessings like grains of sand,\nWithout perceiving the mysterious female aperture,\nYou remain as far as heaven from earth.\n\nTo study the Dao, first clarify the seal of the heart-ground,\nThen must yin and yang proceed as one.\nIf you cannot extend it to others but only to yourself,\nThe lesser vehicle lacks wisdom—\nWhen will the Great Dao ever be achieved?\n\nOne kind of arrogance boasts of self-mastery,\nSpouting delusions to bewilder human feelings.\nSeeking only to gain profit and fame,\nNever pondering the suffering of birth and death,\nThrough ten thousand kalpas, the path remains dark and obscure.\n\n**[Quatrain]**\nOn the eighth night, I dreamed and gained two lines.\nAwakening, I savored them—\nthey were the wondrous sleeves of the golden elixir.\nCould this not be the Supreme teaching me?\nWith reverence, I completed them into a verse:\n\nPavilions beyond heaven suspend sun and moon,\nWithin the body, the qi’s majesty stuns autumn’s brilliance.\n*(Lines from the dream.)*\n\nThe immortals’ wondrous formula—none comprehend it,\nBy the red smartweed at the river’s head, the Chu waters flow.\n\n**Two Poems on Inferiority**\n\nIn the renowned garden, flowers just now vie in fragrance,\nThe golden phoenix first carries them into emerald haze.\nAlas for the bees and butterflies circling the fence—\nIn vain they flutter near the vegetable blossoms.\n\nThe tavern’s jug and the poet’s chant,\nYear after year, never fail the heart that delights in flowers.\nYet none know spring lingers on the plum’s branches—\nAll vie to seek it among coarse peaches and vulgar plums.\n\n**By the Recluse of Mount Yang**\n\nOne move strikes the moment like swift thunder,\nAt the sea’s gate, mist and fog part at once.\nThough waves and billows stretch ten thousand miles,\nWithout the black pearl, he will not return.\n\n**The Realm of Mount Yang**\n\nAncient paths lie desolate, brambles grow,\nLong serpents and fierce beasts intertwine.\nMountains deep, clouds dense, streams flow far—\nHow many travelers dare not proceed?\n\n**Pointing to Reality**\n\nI possess a plot of land,\nBoundless in four directions.\nIt does not lie on high mountains,\nNor on level plains.\nNeither in rivers nor cities,\nNor in the center, nor at the edge.\nNot dwelling in the human world,\nYet only within the world of humans.\nBought without deeds, sold without contracts.\nStand and contemplate—do not speculate.\nWhen we meet, I beg you to point to the true south,\nTo show where the true dragon lies.\n\n**Thirty Zen Koans**\n\n**The World-Honored One Holds Up a Flower**\nWhy stir the seeds of calamity when all is well?\nA million in heaven and earth may doubt and guess.\nClearly, there was fear none would grasp it—\nIn vain, he held up the flower as a laughing go-between.\n\n**Kāśyapa Smiles**\nThe golden-headed mendicant, most pitiable,\nWhy did he smile before the old foreigner?\nHad he not blinked his blue-lotus eyes then,\nHe might have mistaken the flower’s holding for a secret transmission.\n\n**Bodhidharma Faces the Wall**\nA single word unmet, standing becomes hard,\nFacing the wall, he deceived himself with years of suffering.\nAt Shaoshi, he casually tossed the ladle’s water—\nTo this day, the four seas churn with waves.\n\n**Nánquán Slays the Cat**\nA hundred mouths like hammers, yet none spoke,\nOne blade, two segments—souls dissolved.\nWho beneath the groves of a thousand ages\nWill avenge this cat’s wrong?\n\n**Línjì Enters the Gate and Shouts**\nThe shout like thunder, all hibernating creatures startled—\nWho knew it could raise the dead and restore life?\nSilver mountains and iron walls, layer upon layer of barriers,\nOne sword in the void levels them all.\n\n**Déshān Enters the Gate and Strikes**\nThe mountain vine truly does not yield to the oak,\nBrandished, it slays the hero’s embryonic soul.\nEven if his whole body were hands to submit,\nEach blow would still leave its mark.\n\n**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: Does a Dog Have Buddha-Nature?**\nZhàozhōu says: No.\nFrom the first, birth and death are unrelated,\nYet with Buddha-nature, one knows becoming Buddha is hard.\nEven to say \"no\" is still not permitted—\nClearly, like a sword unsheathed in empty space, it chills.\n\n**Bājiāo Says: If You Have a Staff, I Will Take Your Staff. If You Have No Staff, I Will Give You a Staff.**\nOld and feeble, Bājiāo stirs doubts,\nDeceiving with giving and taking, with and without.\nThough his capture and release display skill,\nHow does it compare to a time when weapons are still?\n\n**Zǐhú, Whenever He Sees a Monk, Shouts: Look at the Dog!**\nThe monk turns his head, and the master returns to the abbot’s quarters, shutting the door.\nA single shout—\"Look at the dog!\"—and he turns in haste,\nBiting through, his whole body flows with blood.\nHad he not shut the door upon returning,\nWould such agony ever cease?\n\n**A Monk Asks Xiǎnzǐ: What Is the Meaning of the Western Patriarch’s Coming?**\nXiǎnzǐ says: The wine table before the spirits.\nClearly pointing to the wine table,\nHe directly breaks open the highest barrier.\nHow many who beg for blessings and seek fortune\nAre constantly deceived by ghosts and spirits?\n\n**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: What Is the Meaning of the Western Patriarch’s Coming?**\n\n**Zhàozhōu Says: The Cypress in the Courtyard**\nThe cypress stands tall in the cold green,\nNo neighbor to plum’s jade or bamboo’s luster.\nIts solitary grace rises naturally apart—\nHow many travelers take it for mere scenery?\n\n**Layman Páng Asks: Who Is the One Who Does Not Keep Company with the Myriad Things?**\nMǎzǔ says: Wait until you can gulp down the waters of the Western River in a single breath, then I will tell you.\nAlone it reveals itself, ever pervading the great void,\nEyes aslant, nose straight—a donkey’s mug.\nEven if you could drain the Western River in one gulp,\nStill, no one could ever be its companion.\n\n**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: Did You Personally Meet Nánquán?**\nZhàozhōu says: In Zhènzhōu, they sell large fortune-telling millet cakes.\nMeeting by chance on the road, words are soon done,\nClouds drift, mountains stand, waters ever flow.\nFor you I point directly, without detour—\nThe fortune-telling millet cakes clearly come from Zhènzhōu.\n\n**Xuánshā Sends a Letter to Xuěfēng; When Xuěfēng Opens It, There Are Only Three Blank Sheets of Paper**\nXuěfēng says: A true connoisseur, a noble one—though a thousand *li* apart, the wind is the same.\nA true connoisseur, a thousand *li* away, shares the same wind,\nThree blank sheets from start to finish—utterly empty.\nDo not say Xuěfēng ever missed the mark—\nLike lotus threads drawing an elephant, it enters the pass.\n\n**Shǒushān Holds Up a Bamboo Stick and Says: Call It a Bamboo Stick and You Cling; Do Not Call It a Stick and You Turn Away. What Would You Call It?**\nHolding it up, one knows both fail to hit the mark,\nTo say it is neither clinging nor turning away is still hard to accept.\nBeyond the tip of the pole, there is another way to hook the fish—\nWhat care if reeds are red or smartweed blooms?\n\n**A Monk Asks Línjì: What Is the True Person of No Rank?**\nLínjì says: What is the true person of no rank? A dried shit-stick.\nThe true person of no rank—a dried shit-stick!\nHow many truly know gratitude for this?\nPeace is established by the general,\nYet the general is not allowed to see peace.\n\n**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu: The Myriad Things Return to the One; Where Does the One Return?**\nZhàozhōu says: When I was in Qīngzhōu, I made a cloth robe that weighed seven *jīn*.\nScattered and vast, the ten thousand streams rush together,\nYet when gathered, not even a hair’s breadth is filled.\nPitiful is old Zhàozhōu, with no place to hide—\nHe simply says the robe from Qīngzhōu weighed seven *jīn*.\n\n**Ruìyán Calls Out to Himself as Master; He Answers Himself**\nHe says: Stay alert! From now on, do not be deceived by others.\nCalling and answering—so much pretense,\nEven when roused to alertness, one is still deceived.\nThe yellow bird cannot bear to be heard in sorrow,\nThe green willow simply faces the rain.\n\n**A Monk Asks Mañjuśrī: How Many Are the Assembly?**\nMañjuśrī says: Three and three before, three and three behind.\nThree and three before, three and three behind—already manifest,\nYet how many mistake it for the fixed pointer of a scale?\nThe moon the ancients saw is the moon of today,\nThe moon of today once shone upon the ancients.\n\n**Yán’guān Asks His Attendant to Fetch the Rhinoceros-Horn Fan; The Attendant Says It Is Broken**\nYán’guān says: If the fan is broken, then give me back the rhinoceros calf.\nStriking the grass to startle the snake—was it by chance?\nAlas, the missed step makes words hard to round out.\nHad he then fetched the rhinoceros calf,\nHe would have simply led Yán’guān by the nose.\n\n**Dānxiá Burns a Wooden Buddha; The Abbot Scolds Him**\nDānxiá says: I am burning it to obtain relics.\nThe abbot says: How can a wooden Buddha yield relics?\nDānxiá says: If there are no relics, then I will burn two more.\nBurning the wooden Buddha, the warmth is the same—\nPitiful, the abbot deceived by him.\nHad there been no fire in the stove that day,\nHow could Dānxiá have escaped the night’s cold?\n\n**As Soon as Mǎzǔ Ascends the Hall, Bǎizhàng Rolls Up the Mat Before Him; Mǎzǔ Immediately Descends His Seat**\nBefore the connoisseur speaks, he already knows,\nClouds rise over South Mountain, and rain follows.\nRolling up the mat—nothing remains—\nLike gulls and the sea, both forget their devices.\n\n**Yàoshān Climbs the Mountain, Gazes Afar, and Suddenly Laughs Loudly; Fifteen *Lǐ* Away, the Villagers Hear His Laughter**\nAlone he ascends the peak, his heart suddenly opened,\nA long wind sweeps the Milky Way, scattering the dust of clouds.\nHad he not seen the face of the Moon Goddess,\nHow could his laughter have startled the world?\n\n**Mǎzǔ Sits in Meditation; Nányuè Grinds a Brick Before Him**\nMǎzǔ asks: What are you doing?\nNányuè says: I want to make a mirror.\nMǎzǔ says: How can a brick become a mirror?\nNányuè says: If grinding a brick cannot make a mirror, then sitting in meditation cannot make a Buddha.\nMǎzǔ awakens.\nWas there no reason for grinding the brick into a mirror?\nIt shook the southern neighbor and startled the northern one.\nTry lightly tossing the play-ball—\nThe golden-maned lion flips over at once.\n\n**The Sixth Patriarch Says: It Is Not the Wind, Not the Banner—It Is Your Mind That Moves**\nThe true mechanism does not move, the principle naturally fuses,\nEars observe, nose peers—eyes as if deaf.\nWooden men, flowers, birds—no obstruction at all—\nLet the wind and banner dance freely in the vast sky.\n\n**A Monk Asks Zhàozhōu About the Cold Spring of Gǔjiàn**\nZhàozhōu says: Bitter.\nThe monk asks: What about those who drink it?\nZhàozhōu says: They die.\nThe cold spring’s taste is extraordinarily bitter and poisonous—\nWho would risk their life to drink it?\nDo not blame Zhàozhōu for speaking so harshly—\nSince ancient times, good medicine has always been bitter to the mouth.\n\n**The Buddha’s Birth**\nClutching a branch, from the right side he emerges in the blue grove,\nNo sooner born than his whole body is a root of poison.\nHad there been no water from the nine dragons’ mouths,\nHow could this karmic soul ever be washed clean?\n\n**The Buddha’s Nirvāṇa**\nThat day, in the twin śāla grove, he concealed his body,\nInstantly, the world’s calamities and chaos were stilled.\nWho knew the wildfire could not burn it all away—\nOne by one, the spring winds blow, and it revives again.\n\n**The Patriarch Comes from the West**\nCrossing rivers and mountains, the years uncounted,\nAlone he brings the robe and bowl to the southern land.\nThe patriarch’s intent from the West is in every household—\nWhy trouble to transmit the poisonous medicine outside the teachings?\n\n**The Single Sandal Returns West**\nThe robe and bowl, the Dharma-matters, entrusted to Shén’guāng,\nThe stone horse turns back on the road—his plans run long.\nAwakening from the spring dream before the mountain of forgotten ears,\nHe divides the single sandal and returns home.\n\n**Twenty-Four Poems of the Mysterious Origin**\n\n**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy Hangs a Precious Pearl**\nA pearl like a millet grain, suspended in the empty mystery—\nCountless humans and devas are deceived by their eyes.\nThey do not see the Jade Capital so near,\nBut follow the wind and rain out of the Hangu Pass.\n\n**The Countless Multitudes All Enter the Precious Pearl**\nGathering heaven and earth into a painted scroll,\nEast, west, south, north—nothing remains.\nTravelers, do not seek the road to Cháng’ān—\nWithin a single square inch lies the imperial capital.\n\nOnce entered the pearl’s mouth, none know their whereabouts.\nTreading the Mysterious Pass, step by step deeper—\nAll is clearly nothing, and the heart is void.\nI think of him only on the autumn river,\nWhere moonlit reeds and blossoms—where to seek?\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy completes his sutra within the pearl.\nWind-clear and moon-bright, ever as they were—\nWho spoke, who heard, in what distant year?\nIf you ask what transpired beneath the pearl,\nA mud ox bellows at the moon, descending the long river.\n\nThe Dharma-matters roughly concluded, the hosts of heaven resume their places.\nWind and clouds gather and scatter within the pearl,\nWhispers of homeland stir deep longing.\nTurning back, where are the old friends?\nGreen mountains remain, white clouds atop the peaks.\n\nIn a fleeting instant, silence—no trace left.\nAuspicious signs unfold, revealing the family’s virtue—\nA million humans and devas gaze upward as one.\nSuddenly the six dragons cease their dance—\nWhere now to seek the numinous power?\n\nThe Venerable Lord of the Dao says:\n“The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.”\nThe nameable and speakable are not eternal—\nCease heeding the bystanders’ chatter of short and long.\n\nThe wondrous song originally has no melody,\nNo need to laboriously judge its notes and tones.\n\n“Nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth.”\nAbove, no further hues; below, no abyss—\nSerene and empty, the void follows nature’s course.\nIf you grasp this state at this moment,\nHow wondrous!—the Supreme Ultimate before its birth.\n\n“Named, the mother of the myriad things.”\nVast and unchanging, no going or returning—\nCreation’s work has ever been without cause.\nOnly because of this mother of all arising\nDo ghostly faces and divine heads appear in myriad forms.\n\n“Mysterious and again mysterious, the gate of all wonders.”\nThe path to Peach Blossom Spring fades into the distant haze,\nTravelers gaze wistfully toward the clouds and mist.\nWho knows that beyond the layered mountains and waters,\nWithout traversing the journey, one arrives home?\n\n“The valley spirit does not die.”\nIts numinous radiance chills past and present—\nWho recognizes the Heavenly Root, the upward Pass?\nThe kalpa-fire blazes unharmed,\nIndifferent to birth and death.\n\n“The infant not yet a child.”\nThe Wood Maiden carries the embryo at the right time,\nNo knowledge, no perception—yet wondrous indeed.\nSoft as jade cream, round as the moon,\nIts grace known only to itself.\n\n“Not knowing the constant, reckless action brings misfortune.”\nTo whom can this grace be spoken?\nThe fragrant heart is known only to the Jade Lord.\nPitiful, the palace grass grows green year after year—\nWhy does the noble scion never return?\n\n“I know not its name; I forcefully call it the Dao.”\nEver since moving my home into the emerald haze,\nNo calendars mark the passing years.\nPeach red, plum white, rose-purple—\nAsk the Lord of Spring, and he knows nothing.\n\n“There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.”\nForcibly given names, idly passed down—\nA thing clearly exists, yet is fundamentally none.\nThe finest painter’s brush cannot capture it,\nLaughing at those who trace the gourd’s outline.\n\n“Know the white, guard the black.”\nCast the fishing line and let it rest—\nWho can long hold the bamboo pole aloft?\nThe old fisherman covets the moon in the river’s heart,\nStirring waves of eternal sorrow.\n\n“The Dao gives birth to the One.”\nTwo, three, four, five—let them be,\nA million threads tangled like hemp.\n\nSeeking it where it arises—\nwho knows its birthplace has no home?\n\nDeparting all extremes,\nthis is called the wondrous Dao.\n\nAmid the ten thousand forms, it alone reveals itself,\nnot admitting even a hair’s intimacy.\nOthers seek the marvel beyond extremes,\nbut even after donkey’s years, it remains unreal.\n\nWhen the three are awakened,\nonly emptiness is seen.\nMind, form, thing—all fundamentally empty;\neven clear awakening cannot be grasped.\n\nDo not call emptiness annihilation—\nit constantly reveals itself in the great void.\n\nSeen yet unseen, it is called *xī*;\nheard yet unheard, it is called *yí*;\ngrasped yet unattainable, it is called *wēi*.\n\nLi Si’s deluded heart conjures phantom demons;\nZhang San’s ailing eyes see flowers in the void.\nFrom the first, nothing exists to fathom its mystery—\nboasting of *xī* and *yí* is but vain self-praise.\n\nShun asked Ji: “Can the Dao be possessed?”\nJi replied: “Your body is not your own—\nhow can you possess the great Dao?”\n\nThe question is lowly, the answer exalted—\nwho can discuss the message within?\nTheir meaning transcends the body’s bounds,\nuttered without a trace of artifice.\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni four questions,\nand four times received no answer.\nThe mind does not permit itself to know—\nfour questions, vainly labored over.\n\nDry wood, cold ash—fundamentally untouched—\nwhere else could one seek Wang Ni?\n\nNanguo Zicha sat leaning on his table,\ngazing at the sky and sighing,\nsuddenly bereft, as if his companion were lost.\n\nZijing leaned on his table, sighed to the heavens,\ncompanion lost, emotions forgotten—dumb as a fool.\nTo know his true state:\nthe waters and clouds disperse, leaving only the solitary wheel.\n\nThe sage forgets form to nurture qi,\nforgets qi to nurture spirit,\nforgets spirit to nurture emptiness.\n\nForgetting form, qi, and spirit,\nnurturing the mysterious emptiness—this accords with the Dao’s truth.\nWisdom, knowledge, emotions, dust—all laid down—\nwho then is the original person?\n\n**Miscellaneous Verses**\n\n*Two Poems on Sudhana’s Southern Pilgrimage*\nNowadays, the rivers and lakes make travel hard—\nbetter to return home with lute and sword.\nYoung sir, you’ve long craved knowledge,\nstirring up idle fame across the world.\n\nI’ve always laughed at the boy Sudhana,\nstrolling through a hundred cities at will.\nAll those teachings from beginning to end—\nnothing but poison poured down the throat.\n\n*Sudhana Sees Maitreya’s Towering Pavilion*\nMaitreya’s tower opens at a finger’s snap,\nawakening from a dream in Huaxu’s land.\nWhere now are those billions of adornments?\nSitting in the spring breeze, singing of fallen plums.\n\n*Two Poems on the Dragon Girl Offering the Pearl and Turning South to Become a Buddha*\nWith one offering of the bright pearl, the deed is swiftly done—\nthe Dharma King’s commands are fundamentally impartial.\nThis pearl belongs to all living beings—\nwhy should only she know how to turn around?\n\nEyebrows painted in the fashion of the times,\na fine maiden from the Dragon Palace’s depths.\nNot to present the pearl and seek Buddhahood—\n*Bing* and *Ding* are inherently the southern quarter.\n\n*Two Poems on the Twenty-Five Wheels of the* Yuanjue Sutra\nSilken threads exchanged—how to repay?\nExhausting schemes, yet never reaching the end.\nIf you seek before or after the five wheels,\none body still bears another’s sorrow.\n\nSide branches and leaves spawn endless complications—\nthe straight path has never gone back and forth.\nIf you’re an unrivaled archer,\nwhy not pierce three barriers with one arrow?\n\n*The Four Great Elements and True Emptiness in the* Śūraṅgama Sūtra\nThe four true natures are fundamentally empty,\npure and perfectly fused in the dharma realm.\nWho says true emptiness is not the four great elements?\nClearly, at midnight, the sun shines red.\n\n*The Buddha’s Nirvana*\nThe Buddha used birth and death to end birth and death,\nenlightening humans and gods about coming and going.\nIf you think there is birth and thus extinction,\nyou’ve not yet reached the

Forbearance was dismembered,\neven now, he remains unaware.\n\n*Two Poems on the Four-Line Verse of the* Diamond Sutra\nThe four-line verse in the sutra’s beginning remains as ever—\nseeking it in the

Concludes*\n*The Orthodox Dao’s Direct Pointer: All Dharmas Return to the One, Scroll Six*\n\n**Composed by Mu Changchao of Jianshan Daoyuan in Jian’an**\n**Compiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren**\n**Twelve Poems on Dual Illumination**\n\nTrue wind, true fire, with true water unite;\nTrue earth, true emptiness merge with nature’s void.\nThis is the primordial true bloodline—\nThe Tathāgata’s treasury, perfect and all-penetrating.\n\nThe primordial Buddha is called Many Treasures;\nThe later Buddha, Śākyamuni.\nTwo Buddhas, one stupa originally—\nIntertwined in nature and life, without distinction.\n\nThe number of heaven and earth is fifty-five;\nGood Wealth’s pilgrimage spans fifty-three gates.\nAdding Vairocana and the self besides,\nFifty-five in all—harmonizing heaven and earth.\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* begins and ends with ten,\nAligning with heaven’s root and earth’s root.\nFrom this arise nature and life, yin and yang—\nWho says the Buddha’s principle is partial?\n\nUnmoving true emptiness births wondrous being;\nNot apart from wondrous being is true emptiness.\nTrue emptiness and wondrous being blend without hindrance,\nAll phenomena return to quiescent illumination.\n\nThe awakened mind, the awakened body—fundamentally illusory;\nNature and life, yin and yang—vainly boast.\nWhen neither being nor non-being clings,\nOne knows emptiness originally bears no blossoms.\n\nVastly pervading the Dharma realm, all is contained and fused,\nPervading the three powers and the ten thousand things.\nDo not call this school annihilation—\nRadiant wondrous being arises from true emptiness.\n\nThe true emptiness of wondrous substance embodies sincerity;\nSincere, the spirit is numinous, nature self-luminous.\nFrom non-empty emptiness wisdom is born;\nYet sudden emptiness and quiescence are not the real.\n\nFor kalpas vast, the great silence endures,\nLimpid and pure, beyond all knowing.\nHeaven and earth, the myriad forms—let them be;\nThe true light of constant quiescence never shifts.\n\nUnlock the five aggregates within emptiness’s lock,\nDissolve the eighteen layers of yin demons.\nAll dharmas swept away at once—\nEver and always, the great void alone revealed.\n\nLike a thousand lamps in one chamber,\nOr myriad mirrors reflecting one another’s light,\nLayer upon layer, unimpeded in their radiance,\nNot a hair’s breadth moves, yet all ten directions pervaded.\n\nBefore heaven and earth, emptiness already was;\nFrom emptiness, being arose—thus the dragon of heaven.\nThe dragon’s division is earth’s very body,\nOne pulse flowing through the ten thousand things.\n\n**Ancient Sentiment**\n\nBefore the plum is seen,\nThe mountain is cold, the ravine wide.\nOnce the plum appears,\nIts solitary grace is pure and transcendent.\nThree or four blossoms—skin like ice and snow,\nSparse shadows slanting in the dusk’s moon.\nPlum, O plum,\nBefore me, silently without a word.\n\nThe sun sinks behind the western hills,\nEvening mist just withdrawn.\nTen thousand miles of Chang’an,\nFar bathed in clear autumn.\nThe gulls on the idle sands betray no intent;\nThe moon newly bright, the waters serene.\nOld man, O old man,\nAlone fishing from a solitary boat.\n\nGazing after one departed,\nImagining their voice and face.\nTo return or not—\nLonging surges like a tide.\nIf by chance they come,\nMeeting suddenly, words would fail to plumb the depths.\nPerson, O person,\nSpeechless, alone facing the spring wind.\n\nMountains upon mountains,\nWhite clouds vast and boundless.\nYou do not return—\nLost on distant roads.\nThe geese are silent, their cries unheard;\nYearning for one gone, as if in mourning.\nWanderer, O wanderer,\nWhy not return at last?\n\nBroken clouds, wind-whipped without trace,\nWhite silk across the sky, its brilliance clear.\nSilent, all sounds stilled;\nLuminous, the lone moon flows through the void.\nAt such a time, who shares this feeling?\nAt heaven’s edge, the evening glow crimson.\nOn the distant shore,\nReeds sway in the desolate grass.\nThe old fisherman, his line drawn from the mossy rocks.\nSails skim the water like flight,\nEmpty, bearing the moon homeward.\n\nTrees stand stark,\nScenery declines in the setting sun.\nThings scatter in profusion—\nWho knows their constancy?\nMountains deep and dark,\nClouds billowing boundlessly.\nThis longing endures—\nWho will gaze back in return?\n\nEvening hastens,\nFew are those who, though benighted, awaken.\nWalking in restless throngs—\nWho can still them with stillness?\nBirds fly, fly,\nGrass sways, sways.\nRain falls, faint—\nMy Way is level; who will return?\n\n**Unexpected**\n\nDull clouds, dense and ungathered,\nA long wind scatters them—thoughts drift.\nThe solitary wheel permits not the slightest hindrance,\nTen thousand miles of sky—one autumn.\n\n**Looking Back**\n\nOne thought unborn—principle and phenomena merge,\nLike space, fundamentally unattached to space.\nUnknowing, unrecognizing—who is the master?\nAll phenomena return to quiescent illumination.\n\n**Only One**\n\nTen thousand people, one heart—\nHeaven cannot oppose.\nTen thousand people, ten thousand hearts—\nHeaven cannot oppose.\nThe rise and fall of nations—\nWho but the heart is responsible?\n\nOne person, one heart—\nHeaven cannot oppose.\nOne person, ten thousand hearts—\nHeaven cannot oppose.\nSelf-destruction, wayward teachings—\nWho but the heart is responsible?\n\n**Not Two**\n\nThe sage’s heart is not two—\nHeaven and earth cannot oppose.\nThe sage’s dharma is not two—\nSpirits and gods cannot oppose.\nThe sage’s words are not two—\nAll under heaven cannot oppose.\nThe sage’s Way is not two—\nAll ages cannot oppose.\nOne who can always be not two—\nHeaven and earth wholly return.\n\n**Mind’s School**\n\nThe body is the mind’s abode;\nThe mind is the Way’s school.\nBody and mind flung open—\nThe ten thousand transformations instantly void.\nThe ten thousand transformations instantly void—\nThus the mind’s school is restored.\nA hair’s breadth of deviation—\nNorth, south, east, west diverge.\n\n**Non-Being**\n\nNo Way, yet Way;\nNo mind, yet mind.\nNeither being nor non-being clings—\nNo past, no present.\nTo speak is necessarily to negate;\nTo be silent is necessarily to affirm.\nBeyond verbal explanation,\nHeaven endures, earth abides.\n\n**Unknowing**\n\nNot knowing, thus knowing;\nKnowing is not knowing.\nTo know the \"thus\" is not—\nPast and present return as one.\nMind and mind’s knowing—\nTo know is not to know.\nSuddenly unknowing—\nCan this be called the subtle and profound?\n\nPeople say I know—\nIn truth, I do not know.\nPeople affirm what they affirm;\nI negate what they negate.\n\n**Not Deluded**\n\nOthers grieve, I grieve;\nOthers laugh, I laugh.\nNot opposing worldly sentiments—\nNaturally wondrous and subtle.\nNo need for deep seclusion,\nNo need for conspicuous dwelling.\nNo need for solitary awakening,\nNo need to feign foolishness.\nThe Way comes—follow its transformations;\nFollowing comes—rectify its transformations.\nBetween compliance and opposition,\nSilently discern the true and false.\n\nDharma speech, worldly speech—\nWorldly speech, Dharma speech.\nThe two ends of world and Dharma—\nEssential to settle their master.\nWithin and without.\n\nThe world’s gold and treasures,\nThe wealth and honor before the body.\nThe gold and treasures within the heart,\nThe wealth and honor within the body.\nWorldly treasures nourish the mortal form;\nHeart-treasures nourish the sacred spirit.\nWorldly treasures end in illusion;\nHeart-treasures preserve the true.\nThe body perishes, worldly treasures perish;\nHeart-treasures never fade.\nAlas, these two ends—\nOnly the lord of the heart can decide.\n\n**The Human Heart**\n\nThe human heart—\nA single moment, it races across the four heavens.\nNow like a hawk seizing a hare,\nNow like a wind-chasing steed.\nWater and fire wheels clash in turn,\nLightning and sunlight shoot through one another.\nFrenzied winds stir up dust and sand,\nRushing waves crash against rock crevices.\nBattle lines bristle with spears and halberds,\nThe Milky Way pours in chaotic torrents.\nEndlessly swirling, never still,\nDrifting day and night.\nNot for a single instant\nCan it rest in the abode of spirit.\nThus the sages of old\nSought the heart without respite.\nSix years, nine years—\nGazing at the heart without pause.\nAlas, among all under heaven,\nWho truly knows the heart?\n\n**Mount Yang’s Hall-Opening Verse**\n\nBefore the meal is done, they leave the hall to seek;\nReturning when the bell calls, bowls washed.\nIf one clings to a single grain,\nThe Five Peaks and Three Terraces are but dust.\n\n**Verses on the *Vajracchedikā*’s \"One Combined Suchness\"**\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nEach has its counterpart.\nOdd meets even,\nYin pairs with yang.\nOne, two, three, four—forming the whole.\nThe ancients erred by omitting a single word,\nYet still endured five hundred kalpas as wild foxes.\nModern men err in speech without count,\nTheir karma a myriad times that of wild foxes.\nThose who claim attainment without proof are as sands of the Ganges;\nThose who claim realization without attainment are as hemp.\nTo slander the ancient *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*\nIs to make the Three Wretched Realms one’s eternal home.\n\n**Purity and Filth**\n\nA pool of pure water,\nDefiled with excrement.\nPassersby avert their eyes.\nA pool of pure water,\nInfused with wondrous fragrance.\nPassersby vie to taste it.\nPurity delights the people;\nFilth repels them.\nThe two paths of good and evil—\nThe lord of the heart must weigh them.\n\n**Oneself**\n\nEach person is their own Laozi,\nEvery one their own Maitreya.\nYet all day they face one another, unknowing,\nYear after year seeking outside.\nHurrying south of the river, north of the river,\nToiling across the Three Huai, Two Zhe.\nSome guard ancient tombs and grass huts,\nSome become mountain goblins or water spirits.\nSitting in dark caves,\nPointing to the spirit of life and death.\nCalling this the root of the Great Dao—\nTruly, mistaking the thief for one’s child.\nTo speak of this to those who study the Dao,\nSeeing nature is the principle of awakening.\nTo know, then to unknow;\nTo awaken, then to practice.\nI urge you to ask the skull—\nWhen will it escape the burning house?\n\n**The Dao Is Hard to Attain**\n\nThough the ten thousand methods stretch boundless,\nOnly the principle of the Heavenly Heart is most balanced.\nWinning a name on the golden placard is easily done;\nTo learn the Dao in the red dust is exceedingly hard.\nNot understanding the master of the ten thousand methods,\nOne vainly follows where the ancients walked.\nOf the billions who speak of this principle,\nWho among them truly grasps non-arising?\n\n**The Difficulty of Learning the Dao**\n\nA ladder of rabbit horns might yet be climbed,\nA whisk of tortoise hair might bear mountains in a bird’s beak.\nTo seek here is still easy—\nOnly to still the heart and learn the Dao is hard.\n\n**The Difficulty of Awakening to the Dao**\n\nTo abandon rank and renounce kingship is but ordinary;\nTo burn the body or sever an arm is not yet difficult.\nTo clarify the principle of no-attainment, no-cultivation—\nOnly then does one know the difficulty of awakening to the Dao.\n\n**The Difficulty of Attaining the Dao**\n\nA single hair might drain the sea,\nA mustard seed’s tip might bear a needle’s weight—easily done.\nMastery of the Three Baskets in five carts is not wondrous;\nNothing under heaven is as hard as attaining the Dao.\n\n**Hard to Obtain**\n\nBarbarian songs and Yue chants fill past and present,\nYet few can harmonize with the Snow Melody.\nToday, where is Bo Ya?\nIn the world, it is hard to find another Ziqī.\n\n**Hard to Practice**\n\nWinding paths twist and turn, impassable;\nWhite clouds and green peaks layer upon thousands.\nTravelers gaze in vain from afar,\nWho reaches the highest peak of the azure sky?\n\n**Hard to Believe**\n\nThe Great Dao is level and smooth,\nYet few among men recognize it when told.\nWho would believe, looking back at the homeland,\nThat the evening sun lingers over wild grass?\n\n**Hard to Speak**\n\nDark, silent, rootless—\nNot dependent on yin-yang or images and numbers.\nAll marvelous skills under heaven can be learned,\nOnly this one matter is hardest to speak.\n\n**Four Poems on Absolute Illumination**\n\nHeaven and earth, the ten thousand things—clearly existent;\nWhen the heart is forgotten, the ten thousand things vanish.\nForgetting qi, forgetting spirit, still absolute illumination—\nVast and empty, where to seek the present self?\n\nThe slightest thought or worry clouds the heart,\nInstantly differing from the original state.\nEven the radiant and unveiled is still delusion—\nWho knows the Great Mystery’s emptiness?\n\nRecognizing the foundation of the mysterious origin,\nFrom action one must reach non-action.\nNot knowing transcendence, one clings in vain—\nWhen the house collapses, the master cannot be moved.\n\nThose of shallow roots and inferior understanding,\nSeeing these words, call it \"yin-spirit\" or \"fallen into Chan.\"\nNot grasping the wondrous perfection of the Great Elixir,\nŚākyamuni was originally the Golden Immortal.\n\n**Preserving to the End**\n\nForty years—impermanence presses daily;\nPrepare now for death’s arrival.\nWillows wither, flowers fade—signs of age,\nDuckweed gathers, wealth floats—chaos of the world.\nAncient ways scatter with the vulgar tide,\nYouth departs, white hair arrives.\nEven the turtle hiding in its shell cannot escape—\nHow much less should one stretch forth the head to invite calamity?\n\n**Mid-Autumn at Fifty**\n\nFavor and disgrace are but bubbles and illusions,\nAll seen and heard is empty and fleeting.\nThe Heavenly Heart rests only in perfect balance;\nThe principle of Dao returns to the ultimate stillness.\nThe ten thousand things, vast and boundless, are all delusion;\nThis toiling body—what more does it seek?\nI ask you, moon of the mid-heaven—\nHow many autumns remain in a fifty-year life?\n\n**The Dao Abides**\n\nThinning hair, falling teeth—no need for alarm,\nFor the true heart remains unchanged.\nThe Dao of old and present never ages;\nOnly the body’s beginning and end lack long life.\nA hundred rivers flow straight to the sea;\nA single moon hangs pure in the sky.\nCarrying no worldly cares in the breast,\nEmptying all possession—this is the constant practice.\n\n**Returning to Reality**\n\nWithout awakening, one vainly divides the schools of nature and destiny,\nMonkeys fling themselves from trees, fire wheels blaze red.\nSuch principles must return to reality—\nWhich human heart is not tinged with emptiness?\nOnly because dust and toil obscure life,\nHas the awakened nature lost its clarity.\n\n**Gazing Serenely at Human Inquiry**\n\nShould one gaze serenely at the laws of humankind,\nAll worldly laws become as one.\n**Plain Truth**\nThe ancestral lineage never bestowed laws upon others—\nOnly when hearts mirror one another is it fitting.\nWithout understanding the principles of yin and yang’s nurturing,\nHow can one grasp the heart of heaven and earth’s creation?\nThough the Three Powers are divided into high and low,\nA single pulse has never been severed through ancient and modern times.\nThis is but plain and evident truth—\nWhy seek it east or west?\n\n**Quiet Contemplation**\nIn quiet sitting, examine closely:\nWhat in this world is short, and what is long?\nFrom ancient times to now, all share the same heaven and earth,\nYet dynasties succeed one another, how many emperors have there been?\nInch by inch, the land becomes a battlefield;\nField by field, the grasses and trees vie in the arena of fame and gain.\nAll ten thousand transformations rush by as emptiness—\nOnly the original heart remains unchanged.\n\n**Fundamentally the Same**\nConfucianism and Daoism, revered for their wisdom in the world,\nShare the same primordial pulse.\nLearning must reach subtlety before words can convey;\nAwakening to the true mechanism, principles naturally merge.\nGoverning the world, how can one forget great righteousness?\nJoyful harmony must reach the mysterious void.\nHow many are needlessly vexed by cleverness—\nFacing life and death, they remain obstructed.\n\n**No Contention**\nSince all waters must flow toward their source,\nOnly unity and purity hold fast to the center.\nThe Three Teachings need not oppose one another—\nThe One Origin ultimately returns to harmony.\nThe *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* are indeed the foundation of human relations,\nWhile Buddhism and Daoism can fathom the workings of creation.\nWithin this, why debate right and wrong?\nA single household’s gate opens to ten thousand families.\n\n**Certainty**\nAmid the haste of daily exchanges,\nThe master differs from the multitude.\nLike floating clouds and flowing water, the heart knows no rivalry;\nAfter the rain, the moon’s light and wind’s clarity merge of themselves.\nOnce settled, life’s arising is not true principle;\nUpon awakening, what matter does not return to emptiness?\nDid the ancients not speak truly?\nOnly the common and mediocre remain obstructed.\n\n**The Supreme Learning**\nThough the supreme learning is said to eschew books,\nThe teachings still require written support.\nThe One Origin’s foundation is not truly existent,\nYet how dare one say the Three Treasuries’ texts are absent?\nGoverning the world must unfold through benevolence and righteousness;\nCultivation must discern the paths of life and death.\nDo not dismiss the learning of the heart as mere words—\nWhen awakened to the mysterious void, all are ultimately not distinct.\n\n**One’s Fundamental Duty**\nReading books must ultimately seek to penetrate principle;\nLearning the Dao first requires recognizing the original heart.\nIf principle is not grasped, books are read in vain;\nIf the heart is not awakened, the Dao is hard to find.\nThere is no wisdom beyond life and death—\nIn vain does one boast of brilliance across ancient and modern times.\nI urge the people of the world to awaken:\nDo not let ease lead to complacency.\n\n**Following Conditions**\nIn old age, one’s comings and goings are left to heaven;\nWith whatever strength and time, one forms good affinities.\nI do not wish for fame in a flourishing age—\nOnly to pray for a peaceful end to my remaining years.\nAt this stage of life, one knows true fortune;\nOnly at life’s end is one’s existence preserved whole.\nYet I recall the days of captivity—\nWho could have foreseen today’s poems?\n\n**Recovery from Illness**\nGoodness can avert evil and extend years—\nBut what goodness should come first?\nThe native landscape’s radiance ever shines bright;\nThe moon of the nature-sky remains clear and lovely.\nEach day, advance with acts of kindness;\nAt every opportunity, press forward with good deeds.\nI urge the people of the world to apply themselves:\nA virtuous heart truly moves the August Heaven.\n\n**Curbing Greed**\nA level heart and upright path are sound strategies;\nDiligent toil in livelihood surpasses preemptive cultivation.\nThough a thousand days of scheming may bring wealth,\nA single overturned bowl of water may be hard to recover.\nSeek little, eat little, spend little;\nDeceive not, covet not, plot not.\nThis is the way to peace and joy in life—\nI urge you not to wait until disaster strikes.\n\n**Flattering Ghosts**\nHow shameful that people of this age lack self-awareness,\nFailing to cultivate good plans from the heart.\nOf my kind, how can one bear to deceive and rob?\nWhat merit do ghosts have that one flatters and supplicates them?\nIgnoring the suffering of the world’s poor,\nYet in the unseen realm, retribution is swift and sure.\nA little foresight in one’s conduct\nOutweighs a thousand taels spent on preemptive rites.\n\n**Exploiting the People**\nAll beings are originally free of affliction—\nGood and evil arise from the heart.\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial, aiding only virtue;\nHuman nature, once altered, becomes calamity.\nHarming others for self-gain is still greed for fortune;\nUsing the Buddha’s name to amass wealth.\nThis is no long-term strategy—\nPlanting seeds of goodness may instead sow seeds of misfortune.\n\n**Kindness to Others is Best**\nNot fearing the law of the land nor the King of Hell,\nYet seeking blessings and long life from the Azure Heaven.\nEven if one pushes the heart to give generously,\nHow does it compare to lending without demanding repayment?\nSqueezing fat and scraping flesh for wealth,\nMolding Buddhas, adorning gods, staging rituals.\nHow much better to show a little kindness to others—\nNearly extending one’s own blessings, distantly benefiting one’s descendants.\n\n**Universal Exhortation**\nLoving fame, loving profit, loving to delve into the mysterious—\nSeeking both Dao and worldly gain.\nFailing to grasp the great human relations, like a snail measuring the sea;\nNot understanding the true Dharma, like peering at the sky through a tube.\nOnly with no heart and no things is one in the Dao;\nExhausting oneself and others, how can one become immortal?\nI urge the bustling worldly folk:\nThe King of Hell will one day tally your wages.\n\n**Admonishing the World**\nAlas, the cycle of life and fate—\nLocked within the heavy gates of the five desires.\nA hundred years of life are but a dream;\nA thousand schemes and ten thousand calculations are not as good as leisure.\nDo not let white hair fill your head;\nEven with cinnabar, one cannot preserve youth.\nWhen the time comes, yield to the recluses—\nClose your door, pillow high, amid the clouds.\n\n**Few Walk the Path**\nWho among the bustling throng awakens to the floating life?\nDebating the extraordinary and the mundane, all hasten toward dusk.\nAll ten thousand forms under heaven bear flaws—\nOnly water in the world remains free of contention.\nThe heart, once settled and free of worry, is unburdened;\nPrinciple, when exhausted, becomes self-evident.\nThis Dao, from ancient times to now, is ever smooth—\nYet how few truly walk its path.\n\n**Four Inabilities**\nWater cannot wash away accumulated goodness;\nFire cannot burn the homes of the good.\nThieves cannot plunder the wealth of the good;\nOfficials cannot confiscate the deeds of the good.\n\n**Four Prohibitions**\nIn the heart, do not scheme against others’ livelihoods;\nIn speech, do not speak ill of others.\nBehind their backs, do not harm others;\nAfter death, do not betray others’ trust with their wealth.\n\n**Four Equalities**\nA level heart surpasses burning incense;\nFair scales surpass almsgiving.\nAn even ruler surpasses fasting;\nAn impartial measure surpasses offering rituals.\n\n**Four Inequalities**\nWith the brush, do not write unjust petitions;\nIn the treasury, do not store ill-gotten gold.\nBefore others, do not speak unfair words;\nIn the world, do not harbor an unjust heart.\n\n**Four Acts of Disloyalty**\nPracticing disloyal deeds invites swift ruin;\nScheming for disloyal wealth brings swift dispersal.\nRaising disloyal sons leads to swift poverty;\nEmploying disloyal men invites swift betrayal.\n\n**Four Lackings of Substance**\nA heart without true awakening is easily deluded;\nA Dao without true study is easily lost.\nPrinciples without true clarity are easily biased;\nSpirits without true communion are easily obstructed.\n\n**Four Essentials**\nA state need not be vast—only let ruler and ministers be harmonious.\nA family need not be wealthy—only let descendants be virtuous.\nA person need not be noble—only let clothing and food be sufficient.\nFortune need not be sought—only let the heart’s intentions be good.\n\n**Four Inevitabilities**\nA vast state with disharmonious ruler and ministers will surely decline;\nA wealthy family with unworthy descendants will surely fall into poverty.\nA noble person with excessive indulgence in food and finery will surely meet an early end;\nFortune sought with a corrupt heart will surely bring misfortune.\n\n**Three Great Misfortunes**\nA scholar who does not read is a great misfortune for the world.\nMonks and Daoists who lose their original heart are a great misfortune for the teachings.\nA nation without worthy ministers is a great misfortune for court and countryside.\n\n**Four That Do Not Bring Blessing**\nMonks and Daoists who are not true to their calling do not bring blessing to the teachings.\nA Dao lineage without a proper lineage does not bring blessing to sentient beings.\nPower and prosperity without restraint do not bring blessing to later generations.\nTaxes and levies without proper offering do not bring blessing to the world.\n\n**Two Fixed Outcomes**\nNow we see evil-hearted people\nEnjoying wealth and honor with many offerings—\nThis is the cause of their past lives,\nNow repaid in this life’s use.\n\nThe wrongs committed in this life\nWill surely lead to downfall in the next.\nIf you doubt this, observe over time:\nTheir descendants grow ever poorer.\n\nNow we see good-hearted people\nFacing lifelong misfortune and blame—\nThis is the cause of their past lives,\nNow repaid in this life’s suffering.\n\nThe good intentions of this life\nWill surely not be lost in the next.\nIf you doubt this, observe over time:\nTheir descendants rise to official rank.\n\n**Verily**\nThe wicked die wickedly,\nThe good die well—\nThis principle is truly so,\nHeard by the ear and seen by the eye.\n\n**Death is Equal**\nThe poor and lowly cannot escape death;\nThe rich and noble cannot escape death.\nPoverty and wealth differ in two ways,\nBut life and death share the same path.\n\n**The Dao is Equal**\nThe Dao of ancient times is this same Dao.\n\nThis Dao of the present is this same Dao.\nThe Great Dao is utterly impartial,\nDepending only on whether one awakens or not.\n\nI—ah, I—\nThroughout the twelve hours of the day,\nLong ago awakened to this principle.\nSince then, I have endured hardships,\nNow impoverished, now abandoned.\nFor thirty years I have striven,\nYet none have been my true kin in understanding.\nAmid chaos, I have faced near-death,\nYet this path I dared not forsake.\nOnly upon nearing fifty\nDid I at last stand on level ground.\n\nI practice the Three Teachings as one,\nRegarding death and life with equal vision.\nThe ills of the world cannot be escaped—\nFine robes and caps are but fleeting support.\nI shame myself for my shallow wisdom,\nLonging to meet a perfected one.\n\nMy teachers and friends of old\nMerely assailed me with differences.\nEach exalted their own skills,\nEach affirmed their own rightness.\nSome called me mad,\nOthers spoke of what they feared.\nNever did I meet a clear-eyed person—\nI could only consult my own heart.\n\nWithout sages, without spirits,\nTrue gold must be tested by fire.\nWho in this world truly knows?\nAlas, I weep for myself.\n\nSince taking form,\nSince taking form,\nI have come to this.\n\nMyriad lives born, myriad lives die.\nI and all under heaven share one ancestral root.\nAll men and women in the world are none but father and mother,\nUncles and aunts, kin and in-laws,\nBrothers and sisters, wives and children.\nSome as lord, some as minister,\nSome as friend, some as old acquaintance.\nDaoist masters, immortals, Confucians, Buddhists,\nChinese and foreign, lands exchanged.\nSome as foe, some as enemy,\nSome foolish, some wise.\nAt the dawn of the One Origin,\nWe were truly of the same root and stem.\nBranches split, sources diverged,\nRoots spread, limbs grew.\nHeaven high, earth vast,\nSun races, moon hastens.\nThe longer it endures, the more lost we become,\nUnknowing of our origin.\nI know this floating world:\nOne family bound in kinship.\nWhy must we, you and I,\nContend for fame and seize for gain?\nTurning our backs on kin and kindred,\nWe wound heaven and earth instead.\nI and others,\nLive by the same principle.\nEars alike in hearing sound,\nEyes alike in seeing form.\nNoses alike in smelling fragrance,\nTongues alike in tasting flavor.\nThe lonely, the destitute, the distressed, the poor,\nThe maimed, the sick, the lowly, the base—\nTruly, they and I\nAre bound across lifetimes in succession.\nBeating, humiliation, oppression,\nAnger, scolding, cold, hunger,\nSeizing, plundering, subjugation, suppression,\nNakedness, driving, urging.\nAll such afflictions\nCut to my very flesh.\nAlas, this heart of mine—\nHow can it bear it?\n\n**Unreal**\nIf one does not attain reality oneself,\nOne cannot teach reality to others.\nPeople inherit this unreality,\nAnd in turn present unreality.\nFollowing the current, they enter the flow,\nDelusion and falsehood overwhelm the true.\nOne dog barks at shadows,\nA thousand monkeys become rats.\n**Reception**\nThe Daoist holds fast in heart,\nUpholding the precept against killing.\n\n**Reception of Kin**\nWhen kin and friends arrive,\nNo grand reception is prepared.\nSoft-cooked white rice,\nWild greens boiled to tenderness.\nNoon meal and evening rest—\nOnce given, not repeated.\nThis is the family’s true way,\nWith nothing amiss or hindered.\nThose who understand matters,\nDo not complain, do not complain.\n\n**Inscribed at Liangyuan Temple, Moved by the Times**\nBorn not in Yao’s reign of peace,\nHow many hardships have I known?\nFive years of reform and governance,\nThrice have I seen the clash of arms.\nThe people toil beyond all measure—\nWhat does Heaven intend?\nAmid the thatch, I sigh in sorrow,\nMy poem done, I scratch my empty head.\n\n**Inscribed at Liangyuan**\nWind sweeps the scroll, moon serves as lamp,\nAfter rain, green moss carpets the ground.\nThe petty spirits have lost their power, the man is gone—\nFalling blossoms and weeping birds grieve of themselves.\n\n**Inscribed at Chongqing Hall**\nThe first yang wanes, the second yang begins,\nSpring reaches the root of heaven at the second line.\nAt year’s end, the clear wind stirs the willow’s eyes,\nThe mountain’s chill lingers, rain clears from the plum’s tips.\nThe Lord of Spring may not favor peach and plum,\nYet spring’s hues must come to the thatch and grass.\nFrom here, the three yangs draw near to open prosperity—\nWho says my Dao is bound to the gourd?\n\n**Three Poems on Late Spring**\n**I**\nLife has passed fifty years,\nAnd now five more have gone.\nTwin temples whiten like autumn reeds,\nA lone lamp in the night rain.\nEyes dim, I still make out the words,\nHeart weary, I neglect my poems.\nThe homeland lies far, far away—\nWho here truly knows me?\n\n**II**\nLate third month in Jiangnan,\nPetals fall sparse around the trees.\nSpring departs like a swift steed,\nTime flies with the crow and hare.\nDust stings both eyes,\nThe self and world—both forget their schemes.\nAll past affairs are but dusty traces—\nOne should return on a white horse.\n\n**III**\nIn this world of men,\nA hundred schemes cannot match idleness.\nThe heart, unburdened by things,\nFinds the cosmos wide.\nToiling in dust laments white hair,\nWhile springs and stones love green mountains.\nWhen will this restless clamor end?\nSpring departs, autumn wanes again.\n\n**Three Poems on the Joy of Idleness**\n**I**\nWhat joy is there in the world?\nOnly idleness preserves the self.\nIf one cannot be idle for a day,\nWhy be a man in this world?\nChasing and striving bring many troubles—\nHow much better to cut all ties.\nLife and death are but a dream,\nWealth and rank cannot compare to idleness.\n\n**II**\nWealth and rank are easily sought,\nBut pure idleness is hardest won.\nI only fear my hair will whiten—\nWho understands the heart’s release?\n\n**III**\nWealth and rank are easily sought,\nBut pure idleness is hardest won.\nI only fear my hair will whiten—\nWho grasps the heart’s true ease?\n\n**Two Poems on Worldly Estrangement**\n**I**\nThe road is cut off, travelers few,\nThe mountain high, the clouds deep.\nI stand apart from worldly affairs,\nYet the Dao does not bar the human heart.\nA hundred years—so brief a scene,\nLike an arrow flying past.\nRed dust laments swift aging,\nThe white sun shirks pursuit.\n\n**II**\nLate spring—two poems:\nSpring departs, turning not back,\nRed sparse, green fills the branches.\nIf the self is enslaved to things,\nWhen can the Dao be realized?\n\nThough spring rushes away,\nMy heart remains unchanged.\nAfter blossoms fly and wind stills,\nClouds scatter, the moon shines clear.\n\n**Two Poems on Touching Things**\n**I**\nGardens and groves shed crimson everywhere,\nCourtyards desolate—scenes transformed.\nThis is but the misfortune of flowers in their time—\nWhy single out the spring wind for blame?\n\n**II**\nWhy does Heaven’s work grow weary of arrangement?\nBranches remain dry, buds yet unopened.\nYou only know to pluck and break them—\nIs there no one to come and cherish the blossoms?\n\n**Thatched Hut at Lingyan**\nI gather thatch to roof my hut near the mountain hall,\nPaper for curtains, bamboo for my bed.\nNot to flee fame and embrace bitterness,\nBut to forget the toil of this dust-bound life.\nBamboo draws wind like a green feathered fan,\nPines lift the moon as a night-shining pearl.\nEvening mist veils the curtains, rosy clouds drape the hangings—\nSuch a scene even kings cannot rival.\n\n**Thoughts on the Past**\nWildflowers transplanted by the green willow bridge,\nBranches ablaze, red as burning fire.\nThe old garden’s springtime grows thin,\nAutumn winds strip it bare, turning all desolate.\n\n**Sudden Rain**\nClouds mass like iron cavalry, rain pours in torrents,\nA thousand miles of mountains and rivers drowned in ink-dark gloom.\nIn an instant, the long wind scatters cloud and rain—\nOnce more, I walk the old mountain path.\n\n**Lamenting Disaster**\nIn the winter of *jiawu* (1294), tenth month of the *Zhiyuan* era,\nThunder, lightning, and freezing rain for thirty days—\nThe next year brought great famine.\nThirty days of rain in the tenth month,\nThunder rolled across distant lands.\nGrain sprouted white ears,\nVegetables rotted yellow at the roots.\nThe world knows not the ways of old,\nHeaven’s seasons too have changed.\nThe Dao’s mood turns to earth and wood—\nI write this to mourn the times.\n\n**Diamond Clapper**\nThe knowing clap their hands without error,\nChasing echoes and sounds, tangled as hemp.\nThe Great Being never spoke the hymn—\nWho knows where the bright moon has fallen?\n\n**Hemp Robe**\nA thousand strands, ten thousand ropes woven into a robe,\nCasually draped, clinging to the skin.\nOriginally nothing—why bind the self?\nRecall the moment of emerging into the world.\n\n**Hoe**\nWood for the handle, iron for the blade,\nForged with hammer and tongs.\nThough weeds overgrow the temple hall,\nWith a few strokes, the palm is made level.\n\n**Four Poems on the Illusory Body**\n**I**\nThe city of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nThe den of sorrow, grief, suffering, and torment.\nA thousand years of toil—vainly spent,\nA hundred years of life—a true passing guest.\nSilks and brocades encircle a pit of piss and shit,\nWine and meat conceal a sack of pus and blood.\nGreedy for wealth, lustful, ever more deluded—\nThey study the Dao, meditate on Zen, yet understand nothing.\n\n**II**\nThe illusory body is but a breath,\nIf the breath ceases, death comes instantly.\nIn a moment, the body rots, unbearable to smell—\nWhere are the rich, the noble, the heroes now?\n\n**III**\nPeople only know to nourish the body,\nYet cannot fathom nourishing their life.\nThe body is a false thing, bound to decay,\nBut life is the immortal sage of endless being.\n\n**IV**\nI thank my ancestors and parents,\nFor giving me this body—a joy to be born a man.\nNot to die by the sword in this degenerate age—\nIf not now, when shall I cultivate the Way?\n\n**Two Poems: Cease Studying the Dao**\n**I**\nNo seeking surpasses seeking,\nJoy surpasses joy—yet joy breeds sorrow.\nHow many times have I pondered this?\nWhy not cease studying the Dao?\n\n**II**\nCunning schemes, cunning schemes—laboring the mind,\nGreed and delusion, greed and delusion—never turning back.\nAffliction upon affliction—endless affliction,\nWhy not cease studying the Dao?\n\n**Two Poems: Breaking Delusion**\n**I**\nWind and thunder drive the sudden rain,\nDarkness engulfs the great void.\nIn an instant, wind and thunder scatter—\nAll returns to the old emptiness.\n\n**II**\nGreed, attachment, delusion, affliction,\nHave clouded minds from ancient times to now.\nWhen afflictions scatter in a single morning,\nThe original heart remains unchanged.\n\nHan Shan and Shi De, Seated Side by Side in Slumber\nSeated side by side, reclining head to head.\nBetween sitting and lying,\nthey never depart from *this*.\nJust *this*—what is it?\nUtterly beyond all reckoning.\nLet discussion cease—\nI shall reveal it to you.\n\n**In Praise of the Buddha**\nOn the World-Honored One’s day of nirvāṇa,\na silver casket shrouded his golden body.\nBurdening even sons and grandsons,\nall alike demand gold and silver.\nHmph! From now on, conceal your golden form—\nlet men of this age know your poverty.\n\n**Ultimate Practice**\nSun and moon shine brightly,\nyet drifting clouds obscure them.\nThe human heart, no larger than a square inch—\nhow could it not be veiled by dust?\nClouds are the sun and moon’s demons,\ndust the heart’s afflictions.\nThe wise and foolish alike—\ngreat clarity must yield to great obscurity.\nDrifting clouds at times obscure,\nyet sun and moon lose no light.\nThough dust and toil may veil,\nwhat harm do they bring the heart?\nClouds disperse, the Milky Way gleams;\ndust scatters, the heart’s essence shines bright.\nHow could the long night endure?\nDawn must break at last.\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Dao: All Dharmas Return to the One*, Scroll Six (conclusion)\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Dao: All Dharmas Return to the One*, Scroll Seven\nComposed by Mu Changchao of Jian’an Yangshan Daoist Abbey\nCompiled by disciple Yishan Huang Benren\n\nEar-Observation\nThe ancients observed others with the heart,\nwhile men today observe with the ear.\nHeart-observation is like golden orchids—\near-observation like peach and plum.\nGolden orchids: loyalty and righteousness never forgotten;\npeach and plum: fragrance lingering long after.\nAlas! Among all the world’s friendships,\nwhich are not ear-observations?\n\nThe Zither\nMy zither seeks not sound,\nmy intent not mountains and waters.\nAmid bright moon and still wind,\nwho truly grasps the scene?\n\nChess\nOne monk leans shoulder to shoulder, sitting or lying—\nfingers toil, the heart labors endlessly,\nall eyes fixed on gain and loss.\nHow much better to sleep long, leaning thus,\nall inner and outer mechanisms stilled.\n\nCalligraphy\nUnfurl the vast sky as paper,\ndip the inverted Mount Tai as brush.\nThough the writing shines in full splendor,\nhow does it compare to the undifferentiated Great Ultimate?\n\nPainting\nGazing at colors, admiring forms—ah!\nPointing out exquisite, priceless details.\nYet within the vast emptiness, a mere speck—\nhow could you ever paint that?\n\n*Sent to Stone Hall’s Qiu, Daoist Judge*\nHerb sprouts left unpicked soon wither and dry,\nin the snap of a finger, mulberry and elm turn hoary.\nWho would willingly cast off a golden cage worth ten thousand taels?\nEscaping the burning house of a hundred years is surely hard.\nWhen the lead furnace crumbles, the golden essence flees;\nwhen the mercury cauldron frosts over, the fire’s warmth grows cold.\nFair scenes all pass with worldly affairs—\nask yourself: on what day will you speak of the Returned Elixir?\n\n*Two Poems Sent to Xu Linggu, on Abstaining from Grain*\nGreen mountains everywhere offer shelter,\nmonkeys, cranes, woodcutters, fishermen—all old friends.\nSitting in meditation, walking in mindfulness, worldly burdens forgotten,\nhunger fed, thirst quenched, delighting in Heaven’s truth.\nAge befits robust qi, spirit, and vitality;\nthe wonder lies in the even fire of the heart’s field.\nIf you seek the Great Dao by abstaining from grain,\nyou may as well try cooking sand for rice—how could it work?\n\nThe River Qu\nUpon the River Qu, the sun’s wheel ascends,\nrising straight to Kunlun to illumine the Valley Spirit.\nFire returns to the Heavenly Root, entering the mercury chamber;\nwater flows from the Moon Grotto, entering the lead ford.\nHeaven rounds, Earth vanishes—mechanisms follow the Dipper;\nyin reaches its extreme, yang arises—principles reside in the body.\nSpirit and qi return to emptiness, ever silently illumining—\nonly then do you see the original person.\n\nThe Zither\nBo Ya is no more,\nZiqi rarely met.\nAlas! Among all the world’s hearts,\nwho knows the zither’s essence?\n\nChess\nVictory and defeat cannot coexist—\none gain, one loss.\nPity the pure, white heart,\nall day long self-wounded by blades.\n\nCalligraphy\nStrokes clear and wondrous,\nthe heart’s intent meets the hand’s response.\nBefore observing insects and birds,\nwhere did these characters come from?\n\nPainting\nWhite silk like white jade,\nskillfully painted with new and old forms.\nYet the silk’s original pure whiteness—\nwhy defile it with cinnabar and indigo?\n\nThe Mirror\nInward nature conceals its radiance;\nonly after scraping and polishing does light emerge.\nFace to face, it flatters the gaze,\nyet few glance back at themselves.\nThough beauty and ugliness show no partiality,\ndust and grime can still obscure.\nAlas! The mirror’s reflected form—\nwho awakens to its illusory transformations?\n\nThe Brush\nOnce sharp and keen,\nit spread words in mixed odes and hymns.\nWho would have thought it would dull to the root,\ndiscarded and utterly unused?\nAlas! The passions of like and dislike—\nwho in the world is free of them?\n\nInk\nThe \"Lord of Writing\" steeped in defilement,\nstaining a thousand sheets of white.\nAll day it aids in transmitting texts—\nwho knows its form gradually pressed?\nWhy does it bring about its own destruction?\nOnly because body and heart grow black.\n\n*Three Poems on Lingyan Garden*\nAll sounds hushed, ten thousand echoes stilled in four empty mountains—\nwho would share this scene?\nOnly the heartless moon of the world,\ndeep in the night, hangs low to illumine the garden’s center.\n\nClear, flowing waters stir the zither,\nyellow leaves drift, paving the earth with gold.\nHow much wealth and honor lie in mountains and forests?\nMost bitter is having no one who understands this heart.\n\nThe mountain is cold, the road distant, letters few;\nflames blaze in the halls of power, crowds rush to compete.\nI have received the true secret seal of immortals—\nno need for carriages and horses to reach my thatched hut.\n\n*On Birth, Old Age, Sickness, Death*\nWhere the golden basin bathes—\nuncommon joy at birth.\n\n**Twin Temples Graying**\nSwiftly the temples gray, frost and snow age me.\nA hundred joints out of tune—ailments cry out in pain,\na thousand autumns part forever—paths stretch boundless in death.\nTo hold feeling and embrace consciousness is truly inescapable,\nlike ants endlessly circling—truly pitiable.\nBeyond the original true *One* character,\nwhat else does not belong to impermanence?\n\n**The Suffering of Birth**\nWhen form is born, suffering is born with it—\nsuffering is rooted here.\nAs consciousness and nature gradually awaken,\ndesire and emotion accumulate into habit.\nIn youth, beauty and charm flourish,\nwhile fame and profit know no idle day.\nAlas, to labor this heart—\nhow is it different from a fleeting instant?\n\n**The Suffering of Old Age**\nOnce-lustrous features differ from former days,\nskin wrinkles, the face darkens.\nHair falls, teeth and gums loosen,\neyes dim, spirit and qi exhausted.\nFalling leaves in late autumn’s frost,\nthe fleeting light laments the setting sun.\nAlas, the feelings of all things—\nwhat does not reach its extreme in this?\n\n**The Suffering of Illness**\nThe four great elements fall out of harmony,\nqi wanes, blood flows sluggishly.\nIn prime years, joy and indulgence,\nin old age, sorrow arrives at last.\nBitter pain must be borne alone,\nmoans and groans—who can take one’s place?\nGold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—how wondrous,\nyet sorrowful thoughts make one too weary to look.\n\n**The Suffering of Death**\nThe four great elements part as one,\nall conditions are cast aside.\nWealth and honor end here,\nwhere are the heroes now?\nThe vast wind through white poplars,\nthe desolate green grassland.\nWith no return ever again,\nfor all eternity, tears flow in vain.\n\n**Four Poems on the Yin of Form**\nGreed, love, anger, delusion, and false thoughts—\nlust, deceit, killing, theft, and deluded folly.\nForm, sound, fragrance, and taste—all yin things;\nto seek flying spirit is surely impossible.\nFame, profit, love, and thoughts of gods,\njoy, anger, speech, song, and laughter.\nEarth, water, fire, and wind—no true substance,\nskin, hair, bones, and flesh—all belong to yin.\nHeavy yin and excessive emotion must sink,\nlight yang and refined essence naturally rise.\nSpirit congeals, qi wondrous, empty and luminous—\nin the azure vastness, an empty song summons the Jade Clarity.\n\nRefine the heart, refine the qi, refine the spirit,\nrefine until pure yang unites with the true Dao.\nIf even a trace of yin matter lingers,\nyou will never see the original person.\n\n**Laughter, Laughter**\nLaughing *hehe*—\na hundred years of light and shadow pass in an instant.\nThe two words *impermanence* cannot be detained—\nwhat use is startling wealth and honor?\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nwhere in the world is free from toil and dust?\nIn the turn of a hand, youth becomes white hair,\nthe passing years cast aside like a shuttle.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nhow many living beings fill the cosmos?\nThis life of labor—truly laboring people,\nyet all labor in vain, none understand.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nwho has not been hooked by this laboring life?\nI, too, was deceived by it for half my years,\nonly now have I cast it aside.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nI alone am awake—do you know?\nFame, profit, sensuality—candles in the wind,\ngold and jade splendor—waves upon the water.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nthe path of cultivation never falters.\nBuddha-nature and golden elixir are not two—\nthe mystery lies in how little there truly is.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nprofound and ever more profound, wondrous and ever more wondrous.\nGo straight to the primal chaos before the Image Emperor,\nseek the undifferentiated mystery of the *Xuanpin* cavity.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nthe three phrases and three mysteries are not the essential.\nTrue lead, true mercury, true crucible—\nhow could these be mere worldly ingredients?\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nbest to swiftly refine in the golden crucible.\nSeeking *zi* and *wu* in past years—\nno different from rabbit horns or turtle hair.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nyour own numinous elixir radiates jade brilliance.\nSimply nurture it with the true fire, gently and steadily,\nafter ten months, the embryo forms and nature becomes firm.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\npluck the *wu-sheng* tune on the stringless lute.\nWhere the iron ox plows, jade mushrooms grow,\nthe golden crow in the sea’s depths ever returns to shine.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nno need to abstain from grain or endure freezing starvation.\nMountain springs and valley streams—follow your nature,\nmoonlit rivers and pine winds—chant and sing freely.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nclinging to images and adhering to texts—all is demonic.\nWhen you grasp the nine returns and seven reversals,\nyou are a divine immortal and a buddha.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nwhether cultivating immortality or buddhahood, it is all up to you.\nBuddhadharma calls it the *mind-ground seal*,\nthe Daoist gate provisionally names it the *Yellow Dame*.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nthe six senses purified, the mind-pearl shines.\nOne thought of *wu-sheng*—the ten thousand dharmas empty,\nif delusive thoughts are not eliminated, calamity comes of itself.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nonly the original brightness must always be radiant.\nA million elixir classics—all one mechanism,\none mechanism mastered, a thousand mechanisms penetrate.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nwithin the body, always wield the sword of wisdom.\nSever the thieves of ignorance and delusion,\nthe *huachi* nature-water gleams without ripples.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nfacing scenes without a heart—naturally *li luo*.\nNo need to seek heaven or the Pure Land,\nnor are there hells or Yama.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nno need to wait for the Son of Heaven’s decree.\nA thousand pieces of gold cannot buy this body’s leisure—\nlet golden

He called himself the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty and addressed Master Lan, saying: \"The primordial qi is the Great Dao, and within the sun it is the Radiant King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the original qi is the Perfect Dao, and within the moon it is the Transcendent King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the mysterious qi is the Dao of Filial Piety, and within the Dipper it is the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty. When filial piety reaches Heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly; when filial piety reaches Earth, the myriad things flourish; when filial piety reaches the people, the kingly Way is accomplished. From the Upper Clarity heavens downward, I have manifested in the human realm to demonstrate and expound the Dao of Filial Piety. In the Later Jin dynasty, there shall be a transcendent named Xu, who will transmit my lineage of filial piety and fraternal duty, becoming the foremost among all immortals.\"\n\nThereafter, the transcendent Xu indeed transmitted the Dao of Filial Piety, teaching and transforming the world. He lived to the age of one hundred thirty-six, and his entire family of forty-two members ascended to heaven in broad daylight. To this day, on the Western Mountains of Longxing, his deeds remain resplendently evident.\n\nFilial piety is the foundation of all conduct, the root of all virtues. Whether attaining immortality, becoming a buddha, achieving sagehood, or realizing worthiness, none do not arise from the Dao of Filial Piety. Heaven and Earth and the Three Luminaries exert themselves in filial piety—how much more should humans? Moreover, the toil and labor of parents, their boundless and measureless kindness—of their many kindnesses, these ten are the most widely known in the world. Now, I have briefly illustrated them with diagrams and added instructive annotations, universally exhorting the people of the world to practice filial piety and fraternal duty together.\n\nIf one is unfilial to parents or disrespectful to elders, even if one serves the Buddha and the Dao with reverence, observes fasts, and performs rituals with diligence, such merit does not extend to one’s kin and is of no benefit to the Dao. These are all authoritative sayings; I humbly wish that they be respected and not neglected.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Jiang Yue and Lin Daochao.\n\nThe Ten Good Deeds of Humans and Devas\nThe Three Good Deeds of the Body\n\n**The Three Good Deeds of the Body**\n\n**1. Refraining from Killing**\nTo cherish life and abhor killing is the fundamental heart of Heaven and Earth. If one can uphold this precept, blessings and virtue will flourish deeply. In this life, one’s years will be prolonged; after death, one will be free from guilt. Among all households that accumulate goodness, refraining from killing is the foremost.\n\n**2. Refraining from Theft**\nTo take what is not given is theft. If one can uphold this precept, one will avoid bringing disaster upon oneself. In life, one may suffer official punishment; in death, one may fall into hell. Among the violent and wicked of the world, thieves bear the greatest shame.\n\n**3. Refraining from Sexual Misconduct**\nThe cycle of the four forms of birth revolves with lust as its root. If one can uphold this precept, one’s lifespan will be extended. Harming the spirit and defiling virtue, one wastes essence and depletes qi. For one who values life, this is the greatest taboo.\n\n**The Three Good Deeds of the Mind**\n\n**1. Refraining from Greed**\nThe afflictions of the world arise from the bonds of craving and attachment. If one can be free from greed, afflictions will naturally cease. The sea of desire is profound; the river of attachment is boundless. If one does not seek liberation, one will surely drown.\n\n**2. Refraining from Anger**\nThe mind of anger is like fire, blazing and unbearable. If one can uphold this precept, forbearance and humility are supreme. Strife, lawsuits, and violence endanger the body and disgrace one’s kin. The ruin of families and the loss of livelihood arise from nothing but anger.\n\n**3. Refraining from Delusion**\nThe deluded lack wisdom, wandering in darkness like one who walks at night. Without self-reflection, one will surely fall into the abyss. Wine, lust, wealth, and temper—greed, folly, and perversity—those who persist in delusion are no different from beasts.\n\n**The Four Good Deeds of the Mouth**\n\n**1. Refraining from False Speech**\nTo speak falsely confuses human sentiments. Disasters and wars arise from falsehood. If one does not speak falsely, even ghosts and spirits will trust and turn toward one. The sages and worthies of the Three Teachings all speak of the absence of falsehood.\n\n**2. Refraining from Frivolous Speech**\nTo adorn one’s words with ornate embellishment is to conceal wrongdoing and gloss over faults. It covers flaws and harbors resentment and calamity. Words without embellishment, a heart of loyalty and integrity—these are the foundations of profound virtue, the accumulation of hidden blessings through generations.\n\n**3. Refraining from Divisive Speech**\nTo sow discord between ruler and minister, to sever the bonds of flesh and blood, is to invite disaster and enmity, to ruin families and overthrow states. Those who engage in divisive speech speak ill behind others’ backs and flatter to their faces. In life, they suffer punishment; in death, they fall into the Hell of the Plowshare.\n\n**4. Refraining from Harsh Speech**\nTo utter foul and vile words is to spread poison and filth. To curse and revile, whether high or low, is to inflict pain to the marrow. The four deeds of the mouth are the gates of right and wrong. If one can uphold these precepts, the Dao and virtue will endure.\n\nTo refrain from these ten transgressions is to practice the Ten Good Deeds; to violate them is to commit the Ten Evils. Whether one becomes a Buddha, an ancestor, an immortal, or a human, all arises from the cultivation of good karma. The teachings of the Great Brahma Heaven, the Jade Emperor, and the Buddhist precepts are the Dao of the heavens above. Those who practice the Ten Good Deeds will root their goodness firmly, deepen their blessings and virtue, ensure prosperity through generations, and bring honor and success to their descendants. In this life, they will swiftly avoid royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their spirits will ascend to the Three Realms, attaining the six supernatural powers and realizing enlightenment. If reborn as humans, they will become kings, nobles, great clans, or eminent officials, enjoying heavenly blessings and boundless joy.\n\nThose who practice the Ten Evils will accumulate deep karmic transgressions, increasing obstacles and hardships. Their families will decline through generations, and their descendants will perish. In this life, they will not escape royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their bodies will fall into the Three Wretched Realms, their souls sink into the Nine Hells, enduring suffering in the long night where the fires of hell burn. If reborn among beasts, they will suffer dismemberment. If reborn as humans, they will be poor, lonely, and wretched, afflicted with disabilities, blindness, or deafness, lacking the full use of their six senses, and shunned by others.\n\nThe roots of all good and evil are recorded in great detail in the Buddhist sutras and Daoist scriptures. Here, they are listed and annotated to universally exhort the people of the world to practice the Ten Good Deeds together.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Jiang Yue and Lin Daochao.\n*Direct Pointers to the Dao of the Mysterious Origin: All Dharmas Return to the One, Scroll Seven—Concluded.*",

from ceaseless movement, qi is born.\nWhen qi and principle intermingle in chaos, the Three Powers (heaven, earth, humanity) take shape, and the Way of transformation is born.\nThis is the named mother of the myriad things—hence, the **Taiji**.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* states: *\"The Changes possess the Taiji, which generates the Two Modes.\"*\nThe *Changes* refer to the **Wuji**.\nFrom the Wuji arises the Taiji; from the Taiji arise Qian (Heaven) and Kun (Earth).\nQian separates into Li (Fire), giving birth to the sun; Kun divides into Kan (Water), giving birth to the moon.\nThe Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams arrayed; yin and yang unite, and male and female are born—thus begins human ethics.\nFrom Li and Zhen (Thunder) to Kan and Dui (Lake), day and night are distinguished, and the four seasons revolve.\nThus, in heaven, images are formed; on earth, shapes take substance.\nThat which congeals without dispersing becomes mountains and peaks; that which flows without stagnation becomes rivers and streams.\nThat which sprouts from the land becomes grasses and trees; that which lurks in marshes and deeps becomes scaled and shelled creatures.\nCrawling things are called \"fur\"; flying things, \"feather.\"\nFrom this, cold and heat alternate, dampness and dryness interact; emotions and artifices intertwine, essences and qi converge.\nAll creatures—whether sentient or insentient—proliferate endlessly.\n\n### **On the Wondrous Being of Wuji**\n**Wuji** is the true void of the **Taiji**.\n**Taiji** is the wondrous being of the **Wuji**.\nThe true void is the origin of inherent nature.\nThe wondrous being is the origin of qi.\nWhen wondrous being first coalesces in chaos, the image of Qian (Heaven) is formed.\nTwo Qian become Kun (Earth); once Qian and Kun are established, human ethics and the myriad things arise—thus is the Way of nature and destiny founded.\nAs for the balancing of the Four Images, the arrangement of the Five Phases, the circulation of the Eight Trigrams, the guidance of the Three Origins, the succession of decline and renewal, the alternation of prosperity and decay—these are merely the flowing and revolving of the two qi of yin and yang.\nYet the fundamental void of the Wuji remains unchanged.\nAbove the Taiji, it is quiescent and formless; below the Two Modes, it does not shift with things.\nThough named *Taiyi (Great Simplicity)*, *Taichu (Great Beginning)*, *Taisu (Great Simplicity)*, or *Taishi (Great Commencement)*, their designations differ, but their Way is one.\n\nHowever, the Taiji receives its mandate from the Wuji; Qian and Kun receive theirs from the Taiji; humans and things receive theirs from Qian and Kun—this is the unbroken continuity.\nIt is not that the Taiji is born outside the Wuji, or that Qian and Kun are born outside the Taiji, or that humans and things are born outside Qian and Kun.\nIt begins with the true void of principle and culminates in the wondrous being of qi.\n\n### **On Wuji and Taiji as Principle and Qi**\n**Wuji** refers to pure principle.\nOnly with this principle does qi arise; when principle and qi intermingle in chaos, this is called the **Taiji**—the named mother of the myriad things.\nWhen the Three Powers are established and the myriad things are born:\nThe principle that equalizes things is called *nature*.\nThe qi that endows things is called *destiny*.\nThe nature and destiny of humans and things are none other than the principle and qi within heaven and earth.\nThe principle and qi within heaven and earth are what humans and things receive as their nature and destiny.\nAt the beginning, principle and qi are indistinct in the Taiji; in the end, heaven and earth are replete with principle and qi.\nPrinciple does not exist alone apart from qi; qi does not stand uniquely apart from principle.\nThat which endures with the Three Powers and the myriad things without end is principle and qi.\nYet the substance of principle is still and formless; the mechanism of qi is dynamic yet formless.\nThat which is still and formless is the **Dao**.\nThat which moves and takes form is the *instrument*.\nIt begins with the Wuji, culminates in the Taiji, divides into the Two Modes, and disperses into the myriad kinds.\nYet principle and qi have never been separate, never ceased, and never increased or diminished.\n\n### **The Source of Nature and Destiny**\nThe Taiji is formless; it first generates the One.\nThe One divides into the numbers of water and fire.\nWhen One and Two pair, the body of Qian is completed—this is the primordial origin of nature and destiny, the wellspring of human ethics and the myriad things.\nThus, Qian is split to form Kun; the Two Modes are established, and the Four Images stand.\nThe Eight Trigrams are arrayed, and day and night alternate.\nFrom the initial division of Qian, nature and destiny diverge.\nThe *Classic of Changes* states: *\"The Way of Qian transforms, each rectifying its nature and destiny.\"*\nBefore the Way of Qian divided, water and fire were inherently complete.\nWhen the Way of Qian transforms and divides to form Kun, the myriad things receive the qi apportioned by Qian and Kun, each rectifying its nature and destiny to be born.\nThis is the descent of Qian’s origin, the flowing of forms into the myriad things.\nThus, that which is complete in Qian is yang; that which is divided in Kun is yin.\nThe establishment of yin enables the myriad things to rely upon it for birth.\nThat which possesses the completeness of Qian is called *nature*; that which receives the division of Kun is called *destiny*.\nReceiving the One of water is *essence*; receiving the Two of fire is *spirit*.\nThat which possesses the completeness of nature, destiny, essence, and spirit is called the **Dao**.\n\n○ Water (One) and fire (Two) combine to form Qian—this is the wondrous self-possession of water and fire within Qian’s origin.\nThe origin of destiny is the beginning of inherent nature.\nWhen One divides into Two, the one body ceases to exist, and the two bodies come into being.\nWhen they unite as One, the one body exists, and the two bodies cease to be.",

      "translated_text": "This is the mutual transformation of being and non-being. Thus, the Great Dao takes non-being as its essence and being as its function. Therefore, the true non-being of *Wuji* is the *Taiji*, and the wondrous being of *Taiji* is the *Wuji*.\n\nThe inception of Qian was originally non-being, yet through the establishment of the One, an image is formed. The inception of Kun was originally non-being, yet through the division of Qian, a form is shaped. The interplay of division and union, being and non-being—this is the great root of yin, yang, and the myriad things.\n\n○ The primordial Qian, water and fire, yin and yang, nature and destiny, essence and spirit—these are self-contained. Thus, Qian’s nature aligns with the Dao; human nature aligns with Qian. By uniting with Qian and following Kun, nature is perfected and destiny is restored.\n\nQian divides to become Kun; Kun unites to return to Qian. Through the division and union of these two bodies, nature and destiny are made complete. Thus, when Boyang cultivated immortality, the *Cantong Qi* took the *Yi* as its model, declaring that nature and destiny are nothing more than Qian and Kun, and essence and spirit are nothing more than Kan and Li. Yet Qian and Kun, Kan and Li are nothing more than the One. The One is nothing more than the *Taiji*. The *Taiji* is nothing more than the *Wuji*.\n\nBefore the One took form, it was the beginningless beginning of the *Taiji*. Once the One was established, it became the beginning of the *Taiji*. The beginningless is the inception of nature; the beginning is the inception of destiny. When these two beginnings unite, the Dao of Qian is fulfilled.\n\nNature begins in non-being, whence arises the empty and numinous awareness. Destiny begins in being, whence arises the flowing cycle of generation and decay. The opposition of being and non-being, the interplay of movement and stillness—thus is the Dao of transformation established.\n\nYet the one body encompasses two: the body of Qian encompasses Kun. Without awaiting transformation, water and fire, yin and yang are already complete. To unify the *Taiji* and preserve the primordial Qian, to embrace the formless and encompass the two beginnings—this is the work of the sagely origin. To unite form and the origin, encompassing the two beginnings—this is the enterprise of the sage.\n\n**Sequence of Nature, Principle, Spirit, Qi, and Destiny**\nThe Dao precedes the *Taiji* and is called *nature*; nature exists between heaven and earth and is called *principle*; the wondrous awareness of principle is called *spirit*; the empty and numinous spirit unites with *qi*; *qi* bestowed upon things is called *destiny*.\n\nThe *Yi* states: \"That which is quiescent and unmoving is the essence of nature. That which responds and thereby penetrates is the function of spirit.\" Nature extends to all things without exception; principle is impartial toward all things; spirit responds to all things without fail; *qi* accomplishes all things without omission.\n\nThat which is inherently non-active is *nature*; that which is universally possessed by things is *principle*; that which is mysteriously penetrating and wondrously aware is *spirit*; that which ceaselessly moves and flows is *qi*. Rooted in nature, following principle, preserved in spirit, and generated by *qi*—this is *destiny*.\n\n**Diagram of the Ten Thousand Dharmas Returning to the One**\nThe One is the mother of the ten thousand dharmas. Thus, two Ones make Two; two Twos make Four; doubling Four makes Eight; doubling Eight makes Sixteen; combining these yields Thirty-Two; doubling Thirty-Two makes Sixty-Four. Sixty-Four forms Three Hundred Eighty-Four. Excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, the twenty-four remaining yield Three Hundred Sixty, corresponding to one cycle.\n\nThus, Qian’s tally is two hundred sixteen; Kun’s tally is one hundred forty-four. Combined, the tallies of Qian and Kun number fifteen thousand one hundred twenty. Therefore, one number gives rise to one thing; one thing possesses one dharma; within one dharma, further dharmas arise. In sum, they are called the ten thousand.\n\nIn the beginning, names are established upon the One; meanings are established upon names; affairs are established upon meanings; capacities are established upon affairs; offices are established upon capacities; functions are established upon offices; achievements are established upon functions; distinctions are established upon achievements; marvels are established upon distinctions; rightness is established upon marvels; wrongness is established upon rightness.\n\nOnce right and wrong are established, the foolish are distinguished from the wise; obstruction from penetration; excess from scarcity; scarcity from multitude; sameness from difference; equality from gradation; centrality from bias; uprightness from deviance; greatness from smallness; refinement from coarseness. Accumulating and layering these, multiplying them further—from this point onward, even the most skillful reckoning cannot fathom them.\n\nThirty thousand eight hundred names arise according to circumstances, all entangled in the interplay of things and the adaptability of the human mind. How could the beginning of *Wuji* possess such distinctions?\n\nThe wise must gather the ten thousand dharmas into the One, returning to their origin and reverting to their root. Once the One is restored, the ten thousand dharmas revolve back to their source. Thus, the sage unifies them with the One. It is said: though the ten thousand things are many, their governance is one. Without unifying them with the One, they would merely be ten thousand upon ten thousand.\n\n**Unifying the Ten Thousand Dharmas**\nAs for the ten thousand dharmas in the world: if the vast ocean were a mouth and the Yellow River a tongue, they could not fully distinguish their right and wrong. If Kunlun were a brush and the azure sky paper, they could not fully describe their conditions.\n\nThe baser the age, the more dharmas mutate; the more cunning people become, the more the Dao diverges. Thus, as soon as the one source stirs, the ten thousand dharmas rush forth in chaos—like rain lashing a thicket, like wind howling through a hundred hollows—tumultuous and clamorous, none knowing how to restrain them.\n\nEven if Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor were to re-establish the laws, or Confucius and Laozi were to discourse again on the profound, they could not suppress the source once set in motion. The multitude of the ten thousand dharmas, their vastness—those who seek to exhaust them with clever schemes only render them unequal, and thus they remain unequal.\n\nWhat unifies them? The One alone. What is the One? It is the convergence of their ultimate and the return to their ultimate. Yet the ten thousand dharmas are empty and illusory; the One, too, arises from delusion. If the One does not move, the ten thousand dharmas do not arise. I shall unify them with the One.\n\nThe ten thousand dharmas are the same as self and other, equal to heaven and earth—how could they not be unified? Those who claim the One cannot be reverted to, or the dharmas cannot be unified, have not awakened to the principle of unification.\n\n**Diagram of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin**\nThe Three Vehicles and Four Fruits of the Buddhist path; the hundred schools and various masters of the Confucian path; the Three Realms and multitude of immortals of the Daoist path—\n\nBuddhism, Confucianism, Daoism: A Parable of the Three Teachings Sharing the Same Origin.",

      "translated_text": "To govern the world by exhausting principle, none surpasses Confucianism. To transcend life and death, none surpasses Buddhism. To revert to destiny and master the Three Powers, none surpasses Daoism. These three traditions share the same Supreme Ultimate, the same nature and principle, standing like a tripod between China and the barbarian lands, each with education as its core. Their origin is one, their contemplation is one, their embrace of all principles is one—like a city embracing its people, the sea embracing all rivers, a cauldron embracing all flavors, the body embracing its nine orifices, or heaven and earth embracing the ten thousand things.\n\nWhat is prized is stillness, not movement; clarity, not turbidity. In stillness, the ten thousand thoughts do not arise; in movement, the ten thousand mechanisms all activate. In clarity, spirit and illumination gather; in turbidity, stupidity and darkness congeal.\n\nTo govern heaven and earth, to store the ten thousand things, to unite spirit and essence, to harmonize the six qi—all depend on the functioning of the heart-mind. The ancients could not name it, so they gave it a word. With this, they symbolized the Three Powers and the ten thousand dharmas.\n\n*\"Fufu\"*—to be complete within the Infinite is called *nature*; to be divided from the Supreme Ultimate is called *destiny*; what the Dao deems so is called *principle*; to encompass all principles is called the *heart-mind*. The heart-mind, when spoken of in relation to the ten thousand dharmas, is vast in form and empty in substance, wondrously aware and mysteriously penetrating, containing all existence. Originally, it has no names such as good or evil, small or great—it is how humans and things put it to use. That their later applications differ is why later ages differ.\n\nIt is like three brothers born of the same parents who, by misfortune, lose their parents early and drift apart to foreign lands. When they grow up, each inherits a different house and changes his surname. If the lords of these three houses should dispute over land and people, and the three brothers, each wielding absolute wisdom, devise strategies, deploy troops, and command armies, meet on the plains of the Central Kingdom—some attacking from the left, some from the right, some from the center—though their arrows clash and blades cross, none can ultimately subdue the others. Why? Because their strength and wisdom are equal, and victory or defeat is hard to determine.\n\nA discerning person says: \"Once born of the same parents, now they are enemies—what is to be done?\" Though they wish to disband their armies, release their grievances, blend their light, and share the dust, they exhaust their hearts and minds. The heart-mind in heaven is the heart-mind of heaven; on earth, the heart-mind of humanity; in the world, the heart-mind of the world; in the ten thousand things, the heart-mind of the ten thousand things—yet it is but one heart-mind. Abandon the thing, and you grasp its name.\n\nThe heart-mind is originally without constancy, yet by use it becomes constant. The heart-mind is originally without measure, yet by use it takes measure. The heart-mind is originally without movement, yet by use it moves. The heart-mind is originally without thought, yet by use it thinks. Using its goodness makes a good heart-mind; using its evil makes an evil heart-mind; using its smallness makes a small heart-mind; using its greatness makes a great heart-mind. With this heart-mind, one models the enclosing city walls. Thus, we know the heart-mind governs all principles.\n\n**Diagram of Nature, Destiny, and Body in Union: An Explanation**\nNature is the wonder of the primordial spirit. All things equally receive it—its substance is utterly still, utterly empty, utterly mysterious. In the sage it does not increase; in the fool it does not decrease. In antiquity it does not change; in the present it does not shift. The world’s movements cannot move its movement; the world’s ultimacy cannot reach its ultimacy—this is what we call *nature*.\n\nDestiny is the correctness of primordial qi. Qi, in relation to things, is called *destiny* or *command*. The command is for humans to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions. In things, it resides in prosperity or adversity; in principle, it is originally without life or death. The ten thousand things are impermanent—this refers to the division and limits of their physical forms. Yet the primordial destiny never breaks or continues; it moves without being summoned—this is what we call *destiny*.\n\nThe body is the root of the command. It begins without form, takes shape through the causes and conditions of parents, and truly receives heaven and earth’s correct qi. Thus, it models itself on heaven and earth to form its shape: eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue speaks, mind knows, emotions recognize, hands grasp, feet walk—this is what we call the *body*. Without the body, nature and destiny have no place to reside; without nature and destiny, the body has no master. Blended and united, they are called *human*; one who illuminates nature is called *Daoist*.\n\nThose who treasure the body and destiny but not their nature merely lodge their breath in a single thing. Some say: \"The body is impermanent, destiny is limited. If body and destiny do not endure, where does spirit reside?\" I say: This body is a borrowed thing, and in the end it must return. This destiny flows and circulates. Things arise and perish—with a body, they unite to become human; when qi scatters, they return to the Dao. The sage sets the body aside, yet the body remains; the primordial spirit and primordial destiny have never been lost. To seek destiny and nature apart from the body is like seeking fish and dragons outside water, or sun and moon outside heaven.\n\n**The Parable of the Ox-Cart and Treasure: An Explanation of Body, Nature, and Destiny**\nNature is what humans are endowed with—no thing lacks it. The body is humanity’s foundation, the lodging place of nature and destiny. Destiny is the sequence of qi, the source of all arising. Receiving the mandate of heaven to become human is to uphold heaven and earth’s natural dispositions.\n\nWithout destiny, the body cannot establish its root; without the body, destiny has no way to preserve its life. Without body and destiny, nature cannot lodge its numinosity, nor be perfected in goodness. These three cannot be separated from their root even for an instant.\n\nNow, let us borrow a treasure to represent nature, a cart to represent the body, and an ox to represent destiny. The treasure is a precious object; the cart is a vessel for bearing loads; the ox is a creature that carries and moves. If you place the treasure on the cart and then harness the ox to it, as the ox moves, the cart moves, and the treasure is carried upon it. The ox can move but cannot bear loads; the cart can bear loads but cannot move. Though the treasure is precious, without the ox and cart, it cannot be carried.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, without the cart, the ox has nothing to transport; without the treasure, the cart has nothing to bear. Therefore, the treasure remains at ease while the ox and cart labor. The cart is a composite thing: it moves along the Way by means of the ox and carries its load by means of the treasure. Without such composition, they cannot serve their functions together. Yet all composites must eventually part, and all that is followed must eventually decay. Like the ox that must die and the cart that must break, they come to their end. Only the treasure, not being composite, endures alone.\n\nFrom this we see that the body’s demise is the constant of all that lives, and destiny’s exhaustion is the constant of all that flows. That which does not perish with body and destiny is only the principle of nature. Failing to illuminate one’s nature is to abandon the treasure and not take it. Ignorant of destiny is to abandon the ox and not harness it. Neglecting the body is to abandon the cart and not use it—until the ox dies, the cart breaks, and the treasure is lost. How lamentable!\n\n**Yin and Yang Take Stillness as Their Master**\n\nThat yang moves and yin is still, that yang is clear and yin is turbid, is known to all. But that stillness is their master is unknown to the world. The substance of the Great Ultimate is fundamentally still; its movement depends on stillness, and only after stillness can it move. Without stillness first, movement cannot follow. Thus, in the Way of the Three Powers, stillness is the master of movement.\n\nMoreover, stillness gives rise to nature, movement gives rise to *qi*; stillness gives rise to benevolence, movement gives rise to wisdom. All things under heaven arise from what movement thus generates. Now, yang moves, but its root must be still; yin is turbid, but its root must be clear. Stillness is the substance of movement, movement the function of stillness. From this we see that stillness is at ease while movement labors, stillness is noble while movement is base. Without stillness, how could the movements of the world be unified? Without clarity, how could the turbidity of the world be illuminated?\n\nThus, the sage takes perfect stillness as the Dao—not because yang is debased and yin exalted, but because it is the beginning of the Great Ultimate. Though heaven moves, it contains stillness within movement; though earth is still, it contains movement within stillness. Without stillness, heaven could not respond to the conditions of the myriad things; without movement, earth could not bring forth the life of the myriad things. Thus, within *qian*, yin at its center forms *li*, the image of the sun; within *kun*, yang at its center forms *kan*, the image of the moon. This shows that yang must take stillness as its substance, and yin must take movement as its foundation.\n\nThe stillness of heaven’s body is why it is ever more firm and strong; the movement of earth’s body is why it ceaselessly generates. Thus, the marvel of heaven and earth lies in their constant response and constant stillness. Yang moving and yin still is the true substance of heaven and earth; yang clear and yin turbid is their true form; yang firm and yin soft is their true principle; yang noble and yin base is their true position.\n\nTheir rising and falling is the ascent and descent of yin and yang; their staying and coming is the alternation of yin and yang; day and night are the brightness and obscurity of yin and yang; cold and heat are the shifting of yin and yang. As for that which fills the space between heaven and earth without change, that which pervades the six directions without alteration, whose end cannot be seen when exhausted, whose beginning cannot be seen when traced, which is utterly still and fundamentally so—this transcends the forms of yin and yang and the *qi* of cold and heat.\n\n**The *Wan* Character and the Wheel Diagram: A Buddhist Explanation**\n\nChen Dunzhai says: This diagram is most wondrous, bridging the profound mysteries of Buddhism to the gateway of Confucianism—something no great spiritual master of the past has ever expounded. The Buddhists inscribe the character *wan* (卍) upon the heart as a symbolic teaching. They call it a wheel, with its two parts intersecting and balancing the four images, aligning with the eight trigrams. Its intersections form warp and weft, beginning and end. At its center, it unites the five phases, the five constants, the five *qi*, and the five precepts. In the sutras, it is the four phrases; in humans, it is the four great elements.\n\nThe mysteries of yin and yang, nature and destiny, Dao and virtue, benevolence and righteousness, spirit and soul, mercury and lead, dragon and tiger, *qian* and *li*, *kun* and *kan*—all are equally contained within it. Its advance is level, its retreat is level; it can proceed forward or backward, accommodate four or five, eight or nine. Vertically it is boundless, horizontally it is boundless; the principles of heaven and humanity are all encompassed within it. Thus, the Buddhists inscribe it upon the heart, symbolizing the Dharma Wheel within, turning without cease.\n\nIts sound is *wan* (万, \"ten thousand\"), signifying that the myriad things arise from this Way. Tracing its root, it is the character *shi* (十, \"ten\"). It begins with one, is completed in five, made whole in ten, and embraces the ten thousand. The *wan* character is the sinuous form of *shi*, embodying the meaning of both curved and straight paths. Thus, the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly employs the number ten from beginning to end, signifying the equality of above and below, the interchange of substance and function, with nothing lacking or in excess, nothing high or low—like the wheel-treasure of the wish-fulfilling gem, adorned all around, from which all principles and meanings derive. Its significance is profound, beyond words.\n\n**The Mean, the True Constant, and the Eternal**\n\nThat which neither exceeds nor falls short is called the Mean; that which neither changes nor deviates is called the Constant. The Mean is the supreme norm between the two modes, the supreme principle within the human heart. The Constant is the ultimate existence under heaven, the unchanging norm through all ages.\n\nIn Buddhism, this is called the Eternal; in the teachings of the Most High, it is called the True Constant. The Eternal does not change, embodying the meaning of unceasing flow. The True Constant means no delusion, no alteration. Yao and Shun practiced it in their abdication; Confucius and Mencius transmitted it in their teachings; the Buddha used it to transform the myriad kinds; the Most High employed it to govern the Three Powers—this is the Way.\n\nThe Mean is the ultimate Way of the Confucians; the Eternal is the ultimate Way of the Buddhists; the True Constant is the ultimate Way of the Most High.",

      "translated_text": "Though times differ between ancient and modern, and the Dao rises and falls, its essence remains the same while its applications vary—this is not because the principles ordained by the sages differ. The sages merely employ different teachings to convey the Way of the Supreme Ultimate, which begins in nature and ends in destiny. The establishment of the Three Powers is encompassed by nothing beyond this, and the birth of the myriad things does not exceed it.\n\nThough the Two Modes are vast, the winds and soils vary, and the multitude of beings differ, each receives its nature and destiny to come into being. Though their kinds differ, the Supreme Ultimate has never been other than the same. Thus, the Buddhists employ it to transform the world and return to original nature; the Daoists employ it to transform the world and return to primordial qi; the Confucians employ it to transform the world and return to original destiny. Without nature, the subtlety of the great Dao cannot be illuminated; without qi, the origin of the Supreme Ultimate cannot be manifested; without destiny, the great work of teaching and transformation cannot be carried out. These three—transcending form and instrument, the mother of qi, the rectification of the great ethical order—are the root of heaven and humanity. The Three Powers cannot depart from them even for an instant.\n\nThus, in grasping them, there is essence and function; in attaining them, there is before and after. This is not a matter of excess or deficiency. Tracing their beginning and end, Buddhism is the Dao; the Dao is Confucianism. Yet today, some say that Buddhism’s quiescent extinction is far from human sentiment, that the Dao’s purity and emptiness are insufficient to govern the world, and that Confucianism’s names and principles are insufficient to transcend life and death. These are but partial views, each clinging to one side amid gains and losses. The principle of the sages is one and the same—there is no distinction of depth or shallowness. When applied to the world, it is merely that their teachings differ.\n\nIf one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return to the Constant. The Constant means unchanging; purity is the nature of heaven, and stillness is the nature of earth. The principle of heaven and earth values constancy, and thus it is taken as the One Dao. If heaven were not pure, it could not reach its utmost height and suspend the myriad images. If earth were not still, it could not thicken its depths and bear the myriad things. If its virtue were not constant, heaven could collapse, earth could sink, the sun could grow cold, the moon could turn hot, the four seasons could reverse, and the myriad things could fall into chaos. Only because of its constancy can it remain unchanged through the myriad things, past and present.\n\nMoreover, humans are shaped in the image of heaven and earth, their destiny formed by the union of yin and yang. They receive the subtlety of the one numinous spirit, and should naturally abide in purity and stillness. Yet they are drowned by the turmoil of cares at dawn, entangled by the confusion of love and desire, and thus their constancy is disturbed, their purity muddied, and their stillness set in motion. Therefore, they cannot endure as long as heaven and earth or unite with the great Dao in its truth. If one can truly accord with constancy, unite with purity and stillness, how could heaven and earth not return all their subtlety to them?\n\n*Scripture on Salvation: The Primordial Treasure Pearl of the Origin*\n\nThe Origin is the head of the Great Void and Emptiness. It emerges above the Supreme Ultimate and dwells before the Nine Qi. Its qi descends to become Qian, divides to become Kun, and unites to become humanity. The Three Luminaries, the Five Phases, the Four Seasons, and the Eight Trigrams—none are not established by the mysterious Primordial Three Qi.\n\nAs the *Book of Changes* says: \"Great indeed is the Primal Power of Qian, from which all things receive their beginning.\" This is its source. The Primordial One Qi is utterly pure, utterly still, utterly non-action, utterly refined and unified. It is the ancestor of the myriad ways, the root of the myriad spirits, the head of the myriad transformations, and the foundation of the myriad things. It is originally without name or speech, so the Heavenly Worthy borrows names and words to name and speak of it.\n\nThe Scripture says: The Heavenly Worthy of the Origin suspended a treasure pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the emptiness of the mysterious void, silent and without lingering resonance. This passage of the Scripture is the Heavenly Worthy’s expedient means to guide and transform all beings, each expression having its significance.\n\nThe treasure pearl is the one aperture of the Mysterious Female, the wondrous existence of True Emptiness, the root of water, fire, and the Primal Power of Qian, and the nature and wisdom of the myriad spirits. It dwells within the empty mystery. \"Empty\" signifies that the source has no origin; \"mysterious\" signifies that being arises from non-being. That it is five feet above the earth signifies the round number of the great reckoning of the Five Phases—wood, fire, earth, metal, and water—unified as one. Earth, belonging to the center, governs the Four Images of Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui. This pearl must be five feet above the earth, neither too high nor too low, signifying that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female first emerges at the head of the Five Phases and finally resides within the Five Qi.\n\nThe Origin ascends and leads the perfected celestial spirits into the treasure pearl, signifying that the subtlety of the One Qi contains and emits the Ten Voids, encompasses the Three Ultimates, enters the minute without fail, and embraces the vast without omission. When humans and celestials look up, they see only a surging movement entering the mouth of the pearl—this signifies that the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is the gate of the myriad wonders. The Origin draws all beings with the wondrousness of the One True, entering through this wondrous gate.\n\nOnce within the mouth of the pearl, none know where they are—this signifies that all beings return through this wondrous gate. Thus, their wisdom roams in the formless, and their nature unites with the Great Void, hence the saying \"none know where they are.\" Therefore, when the people of the kingdom beheld the wondrousness of the treasure pearl, they all awakened to the Dao of the Origin. Thus, the toils of the dusty world scattered, and the ground of their minds was wholly restored to levelness.\n\nThe pearl of the mind is vast and great, empty and without form, and the Three Powers and the myriad things all enter it equally. Once the pearl enters into principle, what more is there to say? Thus, it is said, \"The explanation of the Scripture is complete.\" The Origin speaks without speaking, and the assembled perfected ones hear without hearing. Each awakens to the true principle, returns to the root, and reverts to the source—thus it is said, \"The heavens return to their positions.\" Wisdom and nature are subtle and mysterious, neither sound nor form. Those who awaken see the entire Dharma Realm manifest; those who are deluded see not even the tip of a hair. Thus, it is said, \"silent and without lingering resonance.\"\n\nTherefore, the Most High first revealed the subtlety of the treasure pearl to show the traces of the mind, and finally united with the silence without lingering resonance to merge with the emptiness of the void.",

Yao and Shun practiced it in their abdication; Confucius and Mencius transmitted it in their teachings; the Buddha used it to transform the myriad kinds; the Most High employed it to govern the Three Powers—this is the Way.\n\nThe Mean is the ultimate Way of the Confucians; the Eternal is the ultimate Way of the Buddhists; the True Constant is the ultimate Way of the Most High.",

      "translated_text": "This is the complete embodiment of wondrous existence and true emptiness, the full mechanism of non-non-being. The sages’ intent is profound and subtle, difficult to fathom; they must employ expedient means to reveal it to sentient beings, enabling them to seek and attain it for themselves.

The \"four lines\" signify the minimal essence. If one penetrates this, there are no more scriptures to read, no more books to study in the world.

      "translated_text": "The *Yangshan Daoist Abbey of Jian’an*, compiled by Mu Changchao, edited by disciple Yishan Huang Benren, with explanations by Changying and Changjing.\n\nThe celestial body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with sun, moon, clouds, and mist. The earthly body is fundamentally quiescent, responding with rivers, mountains, and the myriad things. The four seasons are fundamentally quiescent, responding with spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The human heart is fundamentally quiescent, responding with joy, anger, sorrow, and delight. Wherever there is quiescence, there is a corresponding response. Quiescence is the host; response is the guest. Quiescence is the lord; response is the minister. Quiescence is the inner substance; response is the outer function. Thus, the heart of the sage is ever unchanging yet responds to the conditions of the myriad things, ever unmoving yet responds to the transformations of the myriad things. Though engaging and responding with the myriad things, this heart never follows them in shifting or moving, and so it becomes the master of the myriad things. Though daily responding to ten thousand affairs, it suffers not the slightest loss—this is how the Most High governs the Three Powers and the myriad things. Constant response and constant quiescence: is this not the supreme virtue of the sage, the true heart of Heaven and Earth? For the scholar, this is the crucial matter of daily practice, and it must not be neglected.\n\n**Explanation of the Chapter \"The Valley Spirit Never Dies\"**\nThe Non-Ultimate is the valley of the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is the valley of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the valley of the myriad things; the human heart is the valley of the host of principles. A valley receives things without ever filling, echoes sound without effort—this is the image of the human heart. *Shen* (spirit) is the supreme principle within Heaven and Earth, the supreme subtlety within the human heart. This spirit, knowing and aware, empty and numinous, responds to the heart as a valley echoes sound. Though the Three Powers may flourish or decline, this spirit never ceases or perishes—hence it is said to \"never die.\" This is called the *Xuanpin* (Mysterious Female). *Xuan* is the primordial image of Heaven and Earth; *pin* is the true quiescent substance. Before the Three Powers were established, before the Four Images arose, the Dao was already complete. It is said, \"There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth\"—this is it. Whether called the Great Ultimate, nature and life, lead and mercury, or water and fire, all are wondrous names for the *Xuanpin*. The gate of the *Xuanpin* is the root of Heaven and Earth. The single aperture of the *Xuanpin* is the root and stem of Qian and Kun. All Dao issues forth from this; the Three Powers are born from this. Some explain it as the coming and going of breath through mouth and nose, the clear and the turbid—this too is the Dao, but it does not grasp the subtlety of the valley spirit.\n\n\"Subtly, subtly existing, its use is never exhausted.\" \"Subtly\" means without end. The valley possesses spirit, unbroken and undying; though the fire of kalpas burns fiercely, it remains unharmed; though the Two Modes transform, it abides forever. If one can employ it without haste or neglect, one may become infinite with the Dao.\n\n**On the Nature School and the Life School as One Body**\nThe world calls Chan learning the Nature School. *Chan* is the Sanskrit *dhyāna*, here translated as \"quiescent contemplation.\" Its foundation is purifying the heart and clarifying the spirit, stilling thoughts and ceasing concerns; its essence is forgetting form and shedding burdens, halting desires and departing from greed. In the body, it is precepts; in the heart, it is concentration; in nature, it is wisdom. The Chan School takes precepts, concentration, and wisdom as its foremost principle.\n\n*Ming* (life) is the primordial life within the chaotic Great Ultimate. Its foundation is non-action and naturalness, wondrous being and pure emptiness; its essence is concentrating qi to attain softness, embracing the origin and guarding the One. In the kidneys, it is essence; in the body, it is qi; in the heart, it is spirit. The Life School takes essence, qi, and spirit as its foremost principle.\n\nPrecepts, concentration, and wisdom are none other than essence, qi, and spirit. Precepts nurture essence; concentration nurtures qi; wisdom nurtures spirit. Without precepts, concentration cannot arise; without concentration, wisdom cannot arise. Without precepts, essence is lost; without concentration, qi scatters; without wisdom, spirit withers. Thus, precepts, concentration, and wisdom are established through essence, qi, and spirit, while essence, qi, and spirit are perfected through precepts, concentration, and wisdom. The sages of the Three Teachings could not depart from these six words to accomplish the Dao.\n\nNow, those who study Buddhism say, \"Originally, there is not a single thing—what use are essence, qi, and spirit?\" Those who study Daoism say, \"I preserve essence, qi, and spirit—why need precepts, concentration, and wisdom?\" Both fail to understand the root, making reckless distinctions. Thus, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who succeed are as rare as unicorn horns. How lamentable!",

      "translated_text": "**Explication of the *Vajracchedikā-sūtra*: The Principle of the One Composite Phenomenon**\n\nThat which possesses composite phenomena comprises the myriad things of Heaven and Earth. The composite of the formless is the nature and principle of the Tathāgata. The myriad composites cannot escape the bounds of bodily life. The composite of yin-yang and nature-principle does not transcend True Emptiness and Wondrous Being.\n\nWhat is called the principle of the one composite phenomenon: *phenomena* (相) refers to affairs and things; *principle* (理) refers to nature and principle. All things—whether in form, appearance, qi, or substance—abiding between Heaven and Earth, are without exception bound by number and accord with principle. Even the creatures that fly and crawl, the sentient and the insensate—what can escape the one composite phenomenon?\n\nThus, the Tathāgata’s teachings necessarily proceed from the phenomenal to the formless. All sentient beings must first grasp phenomena before principle is revealed. Without phenomena, the principle of True Emptiness cannot be illuminated; without principle, the mechanism of Wondrous Being cannot be activated. Therefore, phenomena elucidate principle, and principle unites with phenomena, so that beings may realize \"form is emptiness\" and \"mind is Buddha.\"\n\nThe sūtra states: \"The Tathāgata speaks of the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds as not truly worlds, yet names them worlds.\" The explication: This describes Heaven and Earth as one composite phenomenon, vast as the world itself. Before the Great Ultimate took form, there was no such world; after the primordial mass divided, it was named \"world.\"\n\nThe sūtra states: \"If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon.\" The explication: In the beginning, there was no composite form; the present world’s existence is but a composite phenomenon. For Heaven and Earth unite, sun and moon unite, yin and yang unite, male and female unite—what need to speak of the rest? This is called the one composite phenomenon.\n\nThe explication: The Tathāgata’s true nature is originally without name or form; it merely employs provisional means to approach reality, borrowing the existent to reveal the nonexistent, and in accord with the world, names it the one composite phenomenon. Yet this one composite phenomenon is inexpressible.\n\nThe explication: This one composite is the union of True Emptiness and Wondrous Being, the union of sentient beings and Buddha-nature. Laozi’s \"spirit and form both wondrous\" refers to this. A thousand sages do not transmit it, hence it is called \"inexpressible.\"\n\nBut ordinary beings cling to its phenomenal aspect. Failing to comprehend Buddha-nature, they unite only with the world’s dust, toil, and afflictions, insatiably craving and clinging to phenomena, deludedly attached to every affair. Unable to awaken, they cause the single numinous true nature to drift through birth and death, entering and emerging, veiling and returning—all due to clinging to phenomena.\n\nThe explications of various sūtras differ from the Tathāgata’s intent, leading to errors. The sūtra clearly states: \"If the world were truly existent, it would be a composite phenomenon,\" revealing the union of form and qi. Yet it also refutes this, saying: \"It is not truly a composite phenomenon,\" thereby illuminating the union of nature and principle. This humble explication of half a chapter is offered to clarify the matter for later learners.\n\n---\n\n**Explication of Laozi’s \"Valuing Life\" Chapter**\n\nThe sūtra states: \"Emerging into life, entering death. Those who follow life are thirteen; those who follow death are thirteen. As people live, their actions lead them to the realm of death—also thirteen.\"\n\nThe explication: Life is like the sun’s rising; death, like its setting. Zhuangzi said: \"Death and life are like night and day\"—this is the meaning. The \"thirteen\" comprise the twelve stages of long life, bathing, crowning, approaching office, imperial flourishing, decline, illness, death, the grave, the womb, the embryo, and nurturing—together with one’s own body, making thirteen.\n\nAll things follow the Way of beginning and ending, the principle of yin and yang’s ebb and return. The cycles of flourishing, decline, death, and rebirth in beings and things are represented in the *Book of Changes* by *Fu* (Return) in the Kun hexagram and *Gou* (Encounter) in the Qian hexagram. The waxing and waning of yin and yang, the alternation of cold and heat, the endless transformations of creation—all follow this pattern.\n\nAll who follow life must proceed through these stages to live, and through them to die. Now, those whose actions lead them to the realm of death—even the traces of their flourishing, decline, preservation, and demise—cannot escape these thirteen stages. Who can escape this number? Only the sage, perhaps. The Buddhist \"birth, aging, sickness, death\" also derive from this. Is not the \"veiling and returning\" of which they speak these thirteen stages?\n\nThe sūtra asks: \"Why is this so?\" Because of the thickness of their attachment to life.",
      "overlap_context": " The sages of the Three Teachings could not depart from these six words to accomplish the Dao.\n\nNow, those who study Buddhism say, \"Originally, there is not a single thing—what use are essence, qi, and spirit?\" Those who study Daoism say, \"I preserve essence, qi, and spirit—why need precepts, concentration, and wisdom?\" Both fail to understand the root, making reckless distinctions. Thus, though learners are as numerous as ox hairs, those who succeed are as rare as unicorn horns. How lamentable!",

Once there is birth, there must be death; once there is death, there must be birth—this is the inevitable principle of Heaven and Earth. Those who cannot escape the afflictions of these thirteen stages do so because the desire for life among the myriad things never ceases. Having deeply attached themselves to existence, how can they avoid death?\n\nThe Venerable Lord, fearing that the world would not understand the principle of emerging into life and entering into death, posed the question: \"Why is this so?\" He then answered himself: \"Because their pursuit of the Way of life is too fervent, and they cannot reach the realm beyond death, thus remaining bound to the thirteen stages of birth and death.\" If one wishes to no longer associate with these stages, one must step beyond the cycles of the Five Phases and the bounds of life and death.\n\nThe sūtra states: Those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without avoiding rhinoceroses or tigers; they enter battle without shunning armor or weapons.

      "translated_text": "The exposition states: Since one is deeply devoted to the preservation of life, one should master the arts of nurturing and safeguarding life, follow the natural cycles of vitality, flourishing, decline, and decay, and comprehend the mechanism of emerging into life and entering into death. Cultivate the body, nourish the qi, secure the essence, preserve the spirit, diminish worldly cleverness, and cast aside cravings and desires. Thus, the seven emotions will not stir within, nor will the six sensory realms disturb without. One does not rush about in the arena of fame and profit—hence, when traveling on land, one does not avoid rhinoceroses or tigers. One does not enter perilous states nor dwell in chaotic realms; one does not indulge bodily desires nor invite misfortune—thus, when entering battle, one does not shun armor or weapons. Therefore, those who skillfully nurture life must purify the mind and conceal its depths, forgetting both things and form. This ensures that the rhinoceroses and tigers of the six desires find no place to thrust their horns or set their claws, and the blades of the three poisons have no ground to lodge their edges. When both spirit and form attain subtlety and merge with the Dao in truth, it is said there is no realm of death.\n\nIt is further said: The sage can transcend the physical form and does not consort with the thirteen stages, so external things cannot harm them, nor can the world bring them affliction. Laozi said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body. If I had no body, what affliction would there be?\" Precisely because one has no attachment to the body can one dwell in no realm of death. Various schools interpret the thirteen stages differently—some as the nine orifices and four limbs, the seven emotions and six desires, others as the six waters and seven fires, or the six senses, four great elements, and three poisons—yet these do not align with the purport of the scripture.

      "translated_text": "The infant is one who has not yet emerged from the womb. Emerging from the womb is called \"child.\" While in the mother’s belly, the infant embraces only a single mass of harmonious *qi*. The emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen; the faculties of perception, hearing, knowing, and awareness have not yet sprouted. Upon leaving the mother’s womb, these emotions and faculties awaken—thus, they are no longer fit to serve as metaphors for the Dao.\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"nurturing the pearl of the child\" and \"preserving the great harmony.\" They also spoke of the \"sacred embryo,\" the \"embryo of the Dao,\" \"embryonic breathing,\" and \"embryonic immortality\"—never once did they speak of emerging from the womb. Among the cultivation methods of the Three Teachings’ sages and worthies, none surpass this. Laozi embraced the origin and guarded the One, concentrating *qi* to attain suppleness. The quietude of Śākyamuni and Yanzi’s \"sitting in forgetfulness\" are but the state of the infant.\n\nWithin the Two Poles, the \"Non-Pole\" is the center within the centerless, while the \"Great Pole\" is the ultimate center. Motionless and quiescent, it is the primordial *qi* that governs all creatures. It cannot be described in form, for it knows no bias, no excess, no deficiency—it is the inception of the *qi* of Qian, the root of the myriad things. Though the names of the poles differ, their center remains the same. The Three Powers and the ten thousand things cannot depart from this center even for an instant. As for the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this center—in Confucianism, is called \"refining essence and unifying\"; it is also called \"preserving spirit.\" In Daoism, it is called \"embracing the origin\" or \"guarding the One.\" In Buddhism, it is called \"dhyāna\" or \"quiescent contemplation.\" All are the inherent center of the human heart.\n\nWhen one’s inherent center aligns with the natural center of the Two Poles, heaven, earth, things, and self become one body. Once things and self share the same origin, and the center is quiescent, there is no arising or ceasing, no flowing or stagnation, no coming or going, no bias or deviation. Thus, one may equalize the myriad things, unify life and death, and stand in the ultimate center.\n\n**On Sitting in Forgetfulness**\n\"Sitting\" means halting movement; \"forgetting\" means stilling thoughts. Without sitting, one cannot cease activity; without forgetting, one cannot quiet contemplation. If activity does not cease, the spirit cannot be tranquil. If thoughts do not still, the heart cannot be at peace. Without halting bodily action and quieting mental activity, this Dao cannot be attained.\n\nThus, the ancients established the two methods of *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation) to remedy the illnesses of distraction and dullness. *Zhi* halts distraction, returning it to samādhi. *Guan* observes dullness, restoring it to wisdom. Without the power of samādhi, one cannot halt distraction; without introspection, one cannot illuminate dullness. The superior practitioners of old all sought the Dao through this path. Thus, Yan Hui relaxed his limbs, subdued his brilliance, departed from form, and abandoned knowledge to await the great penetration. Ziqin leaned on his armrest and sat, losing his sense of self. Mingdao sat as still as a clay statue. Master Xu said: \"Abide in quiescent concentration, free from stray thoughts.\" Guangchengzi said: \"See not, hear not—embrace the spirit in stillness.\" The Queen Mother of the West said: \"Do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence.\" On Spirit Mountain for six years, in Shaoshi for nine—some never rested their ribs on the mat, never rose from their seat, their bodies and minds unmoving, entering the great quiescence. In the Buddhist tradition, such examples are countless, yet all involve halting distraction and illuminating dullness.\n\nWithout the cultivation of sitting, how can the sacred embryo be perfected? Only when the great matter of samādhi and wisdom is clarified can one roam freely at will. If the matter remains unclear, sitting should not be abandoned. Yet mere dull sitting, like a block of wood, is called the \"ghostly cave of black mountains\"—outward stillness concealing inner agitation, termed \"sitting in distraction.\" This is not what is meant by sitting in forgetfulness.\n\n**On Subduing the Heart-Mind**\nThe human heart-mind is most cunning and perilous, easily swayed. In an instant, it traverses the ten thousand things. Its greed is like that of tigers, wolves, eagles, and hawks; its venom like that of vipers, scorpions, and serpents. If unleashed, it gallops like ten thousand steeds in the wind; if indulged, it leaps like a troop of monkeys in the trees. Its weapons are like spears, swords, and halberds; its schemes like nets, hooks, and awls. It finds no satisfaction in a thousand measures of wealth and rank, no glory in dwelling in nine-tiered pavilions. The hearts of all things may be fathomed, but the human heart-mind cannot.\n\nHow, then, is it to be subdued? First, one must know contentment; then, apply restraint like poison. Curb its indulgence, rein in its dissipation. Disperse its weapons, cast aside its nets. Forget riches and honor, unify its scattered impulses. Quiet its thoughts, sever its attachments and resentments. Let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight lie dormant, unexpressed. Still the dreams of delusion, distance them in silence. Let the six desires not arise, the seven emotions not entangle. Let all worldly principles, affairs, and realms pass without clinging—like the moon resting on still water, clouds dispersing in the vast sky, effortless and natural, thus and unmoving.\n\nOnly then can it be subdued—like external enemies surrendering to the Middle Kingdom, like ministers submitting to their sovereign. Thereafter, danger and safety are secured, armor is cast aside, weapons laid down. The six desires do not arise, the three poisons vanish—this heart-mind is the great peace of the world.\n\n**Inscription on the Right of Yangshan’s Meditation Chamber**\nThe dark clouds disperse...",

Thus the Three Powers begin. The ancients established images necessarily embodying the primordial Qian.\n\nThe Dao has Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Great Clarity; Buddhism has the Dharma Body, the Reward Body, and the Transformation Body; Śākyamuni has Mañjuśrī and Samantabhadra; Amitābha has Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta. This is the meaning of the Supreme Ultimate containing the Three.\n\nThe Three are the primordial Qian. Qian corresponds to Metal, thus the Dao speaks of the Golden Elixir, the Golden Tripod, the Golden Duke. Buddhism speaks of the Vajra, the Golden Immortal, the Golden Form. All that is called \"gold\" symbolizes Qian.\n\nLet us take one Buddha as an example—other principles may be inferred without being stated. Amitābha’s Avalokiteśvara wears white, while Mahāsthāmaprāpta wears blue-green. Blue-green is the color of the eastern dawn; white is the color of the West. Blue-green corresponds to Wood, symbolizing the image of compassionate teaching and nurturing sentient beings. White corresponds to Metal, symbolizing the image of wisdom and awakening sentient beings.\n\nThe Buddha stands at the center, hands empty and raised high and low, symbolizing virtue uniting with Heaven and Earth in non-action. The two attendants each hold something, symbolizing the meaning of transformative action. They stand upon lotus flowers, symbolizing purity and unstainedness. Their fingers necessarily hold to the center, symbolizing that holding to the center is the Dao. Their robes are necessarily pure red, symbolizing Yang. Their forms are necessarily firm as gold, symbolizing hardness. Their feet are necessarily bare, symbolizing departure from the dust.\n\nThe rest may be known without being spoken.\n\nThe body of the Dao is empty and quiescent, originally without form or color—seen but not visible, heard but not audible. Yet both Buddhism and Daoism show people these limited images. In principle, is this not mistaken?\n\nAlas! The sages have grown distant, and the source and flow have diverged ever further.",

      "translated_text": "Should images not be employed, how could later generations be guided toward what is to come? This was the ancients’ expedient, born of necessity. Truly, to behold a borrowed form and thereby contemplate the ancient Dao is one gateway to faith.\n\nYet while establishing images and instituting teachings inevitably involves artifice, the heart of the sage has never differed. The true essence lies beyond form, and thus is not easily spoken of. When unified, the ten thousand differences share a single root; when dispersed, the single root becomes ten thousand differences. In awakening, one body encompasses the Three; in delusion, the Three bodies remain divided.\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* speaks of the three minds that cannot be attained:\nThe past mind cannot be attained,\nthe present mind cannot be attained,\nthe future mind cannot be attained.\n\nThese three minds—when applied to what has gone before, they are the past; when applied to the present, they are the now; when applied to what comes after, they are the future. Or again: the thought just extinguished is the past, the thought now arising is the present, the thought yet to arise is the future. Though the times of the three realms differ, the principle underlying them remains unchanged.\n\nThe mind of the sage is eternally one. It does not age with the passing of high antiquity, nor does it grow weary in the present, nor vanish in the time to come. It is not altered by affairs or things, nor does it shift with past or present. Employed to govern the world, to teach and nurture all beings, and to harmonize with the four seasons—though it may manifest in emotion and take form in action—it never clings to anything.\n\nObserve its beginning: still and unmoving.\nExamine it now: vast and without action.\nGaze upon its end: boundless and without limit.\n\nWhen it transforms the multitude of beings, none know its virtue. When it is applied to the world, none reward its merit. It does not seek fame in the past, form in the present, or dharma in the future. Thus it is said to be unattainable.\n\nThe Diagram of Six Correspondences\nThe Meaning of the Six Correspondences",

      "translated_text": "Wisdom stands opposite ignorance: when awakened, ignorance becomes wisdom; when deluded, wisdom becomes ignorance. Buddha-nature stands opposite sentient beings: when deluded, Buddha-nature becomes sentient beings; when awakened, sentient beings become Buddha-nature. Afflictions stand opposite bodhi: when awakened, afflictions become bodhi; when deluded, bodhi becomes afflictions. Joy stands opposite anger: when awakened, anger becomes joy; when deluded, joy becomes anger. Self-interest stands opposite benevolence and righteousness: when awakened, self-interest becomes benevolence and righteousness; when deluded, benevolence and righteousness become self-interest. Delusion stands opposite truth: when awakened, delusion becomes truth; when deluded, truth becomes delusion.\n\nThe meanings of all these pairings above are rooted in mutual transformation—body and function interchange, beginning and end alternate. From the utmost sagely to the utmost foolish, none are without this shared essence. These six pairings are like water and boiling water: fundamentally the same yet functionally distinct. When boiling water cools, it returns to water; when water heats, it becomes boiling water again. The two interpenetrate, indistinguishable, differing only in cold and heat.\n\nNow, boiling water is but water transformed—just as ignorance is but the presence of wisdom. Now, water is but boiling water transformed—just as Buddha-nature is but the presence of sentient beings. Boiling water does not depart from water, nor water from boiling water—just as the six pairings do not depart from their opposites. Thus, when ignorance arises, wisdom is extinguished; when sentient beings are deluded, Buddha-nature is extinguished; when delusion arises, truth is extinguished; when anger arises, joy is extinguished; when afflictions arise, bodhi is extinguished; when self-interest arises, benevolence and righteousness are extinguished. It is like when boiling water arises, the nature of water is extinguished, and when water arises, the nature of boiling water is extinguished. Though they mutually give rise to and extinguish one another, their fundamental nature was never different.\n\nAnger and joy are not two separate natures—anger does not depart so that joy may arise again. The two are but a single principle. It is like a single rod: one end is anger, the other joy—used as one’s hand turns it. Just as water, when heated, becomes boiling water, and boiling water, when cooled, returns to water, so too are the six pairings of the same principle. To seek Buddha-nature apart from sentient beings, to seek wisdom apart from ignorance, to seek bodhi apart from afflictions—this is fundamentally impossible.\n\n**On the Golden Elixir and Nature-Life**\n\nSomeone asked about the categories of the Golden Elixir and nature-life.\n\nQuestion: The alchemical classics abound with metaphors—thousands of chapters and ten thousand discourses. As a beginner, I cannot fathom their direct meaning. I beg for a single word of instruction.\n\nAnswer: When the five qi are not errant, the five emotions do not arise, the five flavors are not coveted, desires do not taint, the six roots are purified, and the square inch of the heart is limpid and clear—this is the true elixir. This method is the most direct.\n\nQuestion: What is the method for refining the two true elixirs?\n\nAnswer: Cut off worldly affairs, sit in silent meditation, subdue the Azure Dragon, tame the White Tiger, extinguish the Vermilion Bird, still the Dark Warrior, guard the Curved Array, keep the five weapons unused, and pacify the eight directions—such is the elixir method.\n\nQuestion: Is this something everyone can achieve?\n\nAnswer: Though it is so, one must first reach this state to call it \"readily available.\" Without attaining this essential point, one cannot speak of it as \"readily available.\"\n\nQuestion: Are true lead, true mercury, true water, and true fire actual substances, or are they metaphors among ten thousand words?\n\nAnswer: The Dao is not sought from without; seeking it externally is not the great Dao. True lead and mercury are the root and origin of heaven and earth. True water and fire are the fundamental ancestors of yin and yang. Mercury and lead within humans are nature and life; water and fire within humans are spirit and qi—not actual substances in the world. The ancients did not wish to reveal it directly, so they spoke of it in ten thousand words through things, guiding people to seek afar and near, to match the yin and yang beyond forms with the spirit and qi within the body. Apart from one’s original destiny and primordial spirit, all else—crucibles, vessels, medicines, dragons, tigers, tortoises, snakes, and all things with form in the world—are but metaphors.\n\nQuestion: It is said that one sets up altars and oratories, establishes furnaces and crucibles, models the patterns of yin and yang, refines worldly medicines, and upon completion of the elixir, consumes it to ascend and attain longevity. Is this true or not?\n\nAnswer: In the Returning Elixir, the body is the furnace, the heart is the crucible, non-thought is the method, gathering emptiness is the medicine, refining it with the fire of spirit, tempering it with the water of nature, and merging them in an instant—this is the wonder of ingestion. Persisting thus over time, one firmly attains immortality. Refining worldly, common medicines wastes wealth and exhausts strength. Many emperors and heroes of past ages were deceived by alchemists—ten thousand times none succeeded.\n\nQuestion: Yet in famous mountains and grottoes, there remain furnaces and crucibles for elixirs. Were the ancients all mistaken?\n\nAnswer: The perfected ones established furnaces and crucibles externally to refine common medicines and internally to refine the elixir of the heart. They followed the hours of day and night, practicing civil and martial methods, adding and withdrawing, borrowing the work of the external furnace to regulate the movements of the inner heart. If the inner heart does not slacken, the external fire does not err; if the inner heart slackens, the external work is lost. Externally, they guarded the furnace and crucible; internally, they circulated Kan and Li. When the inner elixir was achieved, the external medicine also formed—consuming it, how could one not ascend?\n\nToday, people know only how to refine external medicines but do not understand the inner elixir. The six roots are not purified, the three poisons are not extinguished, concentration and wisdom do not arise, deluded thoughts are not eliminated, Kan and Li do not merge, mercury and lead do not congeal. Even with external medicine, the immortal path remains but a dream.\n\nQuestion: Having understood the medicine, one must clarify the firing process. How does the medicine congeal? How is the firing process applied?\n\nAnswer: When essence, qi, and spirit interact, and the heart, intent, and consciousness are unmoving—this is the congealing of the elixir. The silent circulation of Kan and Li through the twelve hours, without stray thoughts—this is the firing process. If one does not apply effort at the proper time, the firing process is lost. If one’s spirit and qi are agitated at the proper time, the great medicine is without effect.",

      "translated_text": "Should one know the medicine yet remain ignorant of the firing process, all effort is in vain.\n\n**Question:** In the practice of refinement, must one follow the seasonal nodes, align with the hexagrams’ qi, and adhere to the hours?\n**Answer:** True fire has no fixed timing; the great medicine has no set method. The ancients established seasonal nodes and hexagram qi merely to clarify yin and yang, recognize their images and numbers, and verify the hours—so that one might then act accordingly, ensuring that this essence, this qi, this spirit, this heart align with the celestial mechanism, correspond to the hexagram images, and do not contradict them. If the celestial Way’s timing is lost, yin and yang fall into disorder, and wind and rain lose their season. If the human heart stirs recklessly at the proper hour, the firing process is lost, and the elixir path remains unfulfilled. One must align moment by moment with the workings of creation, harmonizing the Five Phases. Thus, hexagrams and hours are established as a standard for the human heart.\n\n**Question:** May I hear of the civil and martial firing methods—advancing and withdrawing the fire?\n**Answer:** The firing process is most wondrous, a secret not transmitted even by a thousand sages. Speaking roughly, it is nothing more than harmonizing metal and fire. Metal is lead; fire is mercury. Lead is the dark; mercury is spirit. Spirit is nature; qi is life. When nature and life merge, metal and fire blend their radiance, and the elixir path is achieved. If the fire is too martial, it scorches; if too civil, it overflows. The key is neither to scorch with martial fire nor to overflow with civil fire. When behind, withdraw; when ahead, add. At the beginning, advance; at the end, retreat. Maintain it as if ceaselessly present, warm and balanced. It is like tuning a zither: if the strings are too tight, they snap; if too loose, they do not sound. Neither tight nor loose, they respond to the touch and produce music. The firing process is no different.\n\n**Question:** After the ten-month gestation of the sacred embryo, should one continue to apply fire?\n**Answer:** It is like smelting gold ore: once refined into gold, it is not returned to the ore. Firm, luminous, and pure, its nature does not change—this is called the indestructible vajra body. At this stage, one rests in great stillness. Though no fire is added, neither is it withdrawn. Abiding in silent radiance, ceaselessly present yet effortless in application—like a fish drinking water, one knows its warmth or coolness for oneself.\n\n**Question:** Is the completion of the sacred embryo the final attainment?\n**Answer:** When the embryo is perfected in ten months, it is like forging a single whole. To reach final attainment, one must shatter that whole, ascend into formlessness, and depart from all extremes—this is called the wondrous Dao.\n\n**Question:** The *Cantong Qi* of Boyang and the *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* were composed in accordance with the *Book of Changes*, their language archaic and meaning profound, making their ultimate purport difficult to fathom. Are there simpler teachings beyond these?\n**Answer:** The immortals feared that if the world obtained the Way too easily, they would lose it just as easily. Thus, they borrowed the images of the *Changes* to elucidate it. Humans, shaped in the likeness of heaven and earth, follow the Way of heaven and earth. If one understands the *Changes*, then the Way of heaven and earth resides in one’s heart. The simplest of all is nature and life. Nature is the true non-being of the Supreme Ultimate; life is the wondrous being of the Ultimateless. The Confucians’ five carts of texts, the Buddhists’ three treasuries, and the hundreds of thousands of alchemical scriptures cannot surpass this.\n\n**Question:** Beyond nature and life, is there a further mystery?\n**Answer:** The heart. The heart is the palace of spirit, the lord of essence, the commander of qi. When the heart is still, spirit abides; when the heart is unified, essence is unified; when the heart is settled, qi is settled. When the heart stirs, a hundred thoughts arise; when the heart is still, ten thousand conditions cease. In its vastness, it fills the Two Modes; in its contraction, it harmonizes the Four Images. It gathers the Five Phases, unites the Eight Trigrams, fuses lead and mercury, water and fire, and returns spirit, essence, hun, and po to tranquility. Whether becoming an immortal, a buddha, a master, or a scholar, all is accomplished through the heart.\n\n**Question:** In the Way of the Golden Elixir, which comes first—nature or life?\n**Answer:** Those who enter through the school of nature make nature primary and life responsive. Those who enter through the school of life make life primary and nature responsive. Nature cannot exist without life—without life, it is mere dry wisdom. Life cannot exist without nature—without nature, it is withered yang. These two emerge together yet differ in function; one cannot cling to just one.\n\n**Question:** Humans take form, qi, spirit, nature, and life as their foundation. Where do they ultimately begin and end?\n**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate blends into qi; the singularity of qi is called essence; the wondrous aspect of essence is called spirit; the wondrous aspect of spirit is called nature. When qi descends into humans, it becomes life. In humans, qi governs form. When qi is sufficient, essence is sufficient; when essence is sufficient, spirit is luminous; when spirit is luminous, nature reaches its apex. Nature is the beginning; life is the end. The ultimate lies therein.\n\n**Question:** If one can embrace the origin and guard the One, the rest—hexagrams, yin and yang—are merely metaphors. Why trouble oneself with abstruse studies, needlessly burdening the mind?\n**Answer:** The Way of the immortals is not for those of dull perception. If one does not clearly understand the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate and the root of heaven and earth, and does not recognize hexagram images, qi numbers, Kan and Li, lead and mercury, one is not a master of principle. If one merely embraces the origin without change or guards the One without comprehension, remaining ignorant of the Dao’s whereabouts, how can this be called the wondrous mystery? The Way of the immortals is not for the obstinate or the unlearned.\n\n**Question:** The Gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth. Is the Mysterious Female not a physical entity?\n**Answer:** The Mysterious Female is the ancestor of the primordial Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things are born from it; the myriad principles and ten thousand methods return to it. In things, it is nature and life; in medicine, it is lead and mercury; in humans, it is spirit and essence; in hexagrams, it is Kan and Li; in the *Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is the original nature; in Daoism, it is the Mysterious Pass.

      "translated_text": "The Mysterious Female is not a thing of form or substance.\n\n**Question:** If the refinement of elixirs and ingestion of medicinal substances cannot be relied upon, then what *can* be relied upon?\n**Answer:** Lead is one’s own lead; mercury is one’s own mercury; essence is one’s own essence; spirit is one’s own spirit; the crucible and vessel are one’s own; the medicinal ingredients are one’s own; dragon and tiger are one’s own; Kan and Li correspond to one’s own system.

If one can remain in the world without being of it, dwell in dust without being stained by it, then there is no need to forsake gratitude and righteousness, abandon food, or leave one’s spouse—no need to stand apart in eccentric isolation to cultivate the Dao.

      "translated_text": "Should one inquire about the elixir of gold, essence, and life—\n\n**Question:** Is it permissible in principle to proceed without a master’s transmission?\n**Answer:** Those who awaken without a teacher are not unknown in the world. As Zhuangzi said: *\"Follow the sincerity of your heart and take it as your teacher—who alone is without one?\"* The Buddha declared: *\"In past lives, I had countless teachers. Now, by the natural radiance of my spirit, I attain the Dao—this is to be without a teacher.\"* Yet it is not that there is no teacher; rather, seeking from others is not as reliable as seeking from oneself. If the lineage is impure, one may instead be led into confusion—how easily does one meet a true master?\n\n**Question:** The ingredients are easy to recognize, but the firing times are most difficult. How should one practice to get it right?\n**Answer:** From ancient times to the present, no elixir manual has spoken of the initial work of firing times. Only the illustrated diagrams of the Perfected Zhang and Bai Yuchan reveal it with utmost clarity. The *Lotus Sutra* calls it *\"the one great causal condition\"*—it is no small matter. One must awaken to it with perfect clarity, so that in all twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, one remains like an infant cradled in the arms. Spirit and qi harmonize; Kan and Li circulate in secret. Inner visions do not arise; external thoughts do not stir. If thoughts move, the fire scatters; if notions arise, the timing is lost. Warm as the sun in a cold land, bright as the full moon in autumn’s sky. Like a hen brooding her eggs, like a young dragon nurturing its pearl. As in the primal chaos of the Two Modes, as at the beginning of the undifferentiated qi. The Confucians speak of *\"joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure before they arise\"*; the Buddhists speak of *\"emptiness of sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness.\"* If one refines in this way, the elixir path may be accomplished; otherwise, I know not what will become of it.\n\n**Question:** What are the two arcs?\n**Answer:** The human body naturally possesses two arcs. Speaking in terms of the celestial Dao: at the new moon, Kun begins as *Fu*, resembling the moon’s first crescent. By the eighth day, Kun transforms into *Lin*, resembling the first quarter. On the fifteenth, Kun becomes *Tai*, resembling the full moon. On the sixteenth, Qian begins as *Gou*, resembling the moon’s waning. By the twenty-third, Qian transforms into *Dun*, resembling the last quarter. On the thirtieth day, Qian is exhausted and transforms into Kun, resembling the dark moon. From this point onward, Kun again gives rise to Zhen; darkness again gives birth to brightness. Thus it cycles endlessly, without cease. From the eighth to the twenty-third day, exactly sixteen days pass—this is called *\"one catty.\"* Yin and yang are evenly balanced, hence the term *\"two arcs.\"* The elixir path takes its model from this, serving as the standard for the inner symbolism of the human body.\n\n**Question:** May we hear of the inner symbolism of the two arcs?\n**Answer:** Half a catty of gold, half a catty of silver—upper and lower unite in harmony, like the full moon. If even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir path will not succeed. This Dao is profound and wondrous; it cannot be transmitted except by the heart.\n\n**Question:** What are the two solstices?\n**Answer:** To speak of what is near: the day has its two solstices, the hour has its two solstices, the moment has its two solstices. Kan and Li, midnight and noon—these interactions never leave our bodies, so one need not seek the winter and summer solstices.\n\n**Question:** Are the heart and the intent one thing or two?\n**Answer:** The heart is awareness; intent is that which follows. The heart is aware and knows; thought follows accordingly. The heart’s mechanism operates through intent; intent is bound to the heart. The two cannot be separated. The spleen governs intent; intent delights in sound, hence the character for *\"sound\"* (音) is placed under *\"heart\"* (心) to form *\"intent\"* (意). The spleen belongs to earth; the spleen delights in thought, hence the character for *\"field\"* (田) is added to *\"heart\"* (心) to form *\"thought\"* (思). All terms such as intent, thought, will, reflection, gratitude, and resentment—those derived from the heart—are written with the *\"heart\"* radical. Thus we know that intent depends on the heart as its master. Hence it is said: *\"All things are created by the heart alone.\"*\n\n**Question:** May we hear of the wondrous harmony of the five spirits?\n**Answer:** The hun emerges from the liver and corresponds to the eyes. The po emerges from the lungs and corresponds to the nose. Essence emerges from the kidneys and corresponds to the ears. Spirit emerges from the heart and corresponds to the tongue. Intent emerges from the spleen and corresponds to the four limbs. The heart’s spirit, hun, and po—through their seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—enable the eye’s root to discern colors, the ear’s root to hear sounds, the nose’s root to detect fragrances, and the tongue’s root to know tastes. Without intent, these four could not exercise their functions. Thus, if intent does not think, the hun does not rise; if intent does not ponder, essence does not move; if intent does not imagine, the po does not scatter; if intent does not conceive, the spirit does not waver. Internally, spirit, essence, hun, and po gather in intent; externally, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue submit to the spleen. In symbolism, metal, wood, water, and fire harmonize with earth. Governing the five qi and blending the hundred spirits—all depend on the spleen’s intent. As the ancients said: *\"When not a single thought arises, the entire body is revealed; when the six roots stir, clouds obscure it.\"* This is also the subtlety of elixir refinement.\n\n**Question:** What are the similarities and differences between nature, spirit, and heart?\n**Answer:** Nature is the true emptiness that is utterly still. Spirit is the wondrous, numinous presence within true emptiness. It is through spirit that nature responds and communicates. The heart is the pivot of nature and the mechanism of spirit. When the pivot and mechanism are still, nature and spirit are at peace; when they move, nature and spirit waver. Though they have two functions, they do not depart from one body. Nature does not illuminate itself—spirit illuminates it. Nature does not communicate itself—spirit communicates it. To pacify nature and preserve spirit is the work of the heart. All methods arise from the heart.\n\n**Question:** What is wisdom?\n**Answer:** Wisdom is not of the human heart; it cannot be possessed. Wisdom is Kan; insight is Li. Water governs wisdom, flowing without cease. Fire governs insight, shining without cease. Wisdom-water and insight-fire circulate endlessly, and in all things, they are impartial. Wisdom is all-pervading; insight is all-illuminating. To be penetrating and illuminating is called wisdom. In Buddhism, it is wisdom; in Daoism, it is spirit and essence. To awaken to it is to embody the great void; to be deluded by it is to grope in the darkest night.",

      "translated_text": "All beings, whether ordinary or enlightened, share the same essence—only awakening separates them.\n\n**Question:** What of fasting?\n**Answer:** The ancients, with their spirit, qi, and essence complete, practiced long and naturally ceased to eat without needing to fast. People today, not grasping the principle, forcibly abstain for five or seven days, mistaking starvation for discipline. They grow gaunt, their faces grimy, their essence withered, their hearts weak and trembling—yet they deem this the Way. They torment themselves in ascetic practice, hoping for blissful reward. How foolish!\n\n**Question:** Some claim that supplementing essence and strengthening yang through diet forms the foundation of the elixir. Is this correct?\n**Answer:** Humans rely on food to live, but enough to sustain the body suffices. To indulge the palate, nourishing the Three Corpses and feeding the Five Ghosts, is a method that harms the spirit and depletes qi—how can it be the path to longevity? Without abstinence and precepts, how can one be called pure? No sage or immortal ever spoke of drunkenness and gluttony as the way to transcendence.\n\n**Question:** Those in the world who lack understanding merely seek to preserve their form and avoid death. If one’s practice does not reach this goal, what then?\n**Answer:** This question is like a lotus in snow—rare in ancient or modern times. Most who study the Dao only learn to preserve their form and gather qi, treasuring their bodily shell in hopes of longevity, unaware that the great matter of life and death looms. When the final hour arrives, they scramble in panic, rushing toward the six destinies. As the scripture says: \"The ghostly path is ever perilous.\" Seekers must thoroughly investigate the final step—do not treat it lightly.\n\n**Question:** The great matter of life and death—pray, enlighten me on this final step.\n**Answer:** Humans receive their bodies from their parents, modeled after heaven and earth, sustained by the five qi, and established through myriad conditions. From head to toe, all is impermanent. Thus, Maitreya’s verse says: \"Though you endure for eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, you fall into emptiness.\" Only the primordial beginning of the Great Void, the original yang, remains unscathed even when the kalpa-fire rages. All else is borrowed—how can it not die? Laozi said: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body.\" And again: \"The sage sets the body aside, yet the body endures.\" Thus, this body is ultimately an affliction; only the Dao can exist alone. The ancients practiced the Dao, not for the body. If one can embody the unborn and undying, attain the stillness of cessation, and reach the state beyond death and birth—what concern remains for the final step?\n\n**Question:** All things are impermanent—this is an unchanging truth across past and present. Is there truly a path beyond death?\n**Answer:** The ancients said:\n*There is a thing before heaven and earth,\nIts form originally still and vast.\nIt masters the ten thousand images,\nUnchanging through the four seasons’ decay.*\nLaozi spoke of the \"valley spirit that does not die\"—this is it. Things are impermanent, but our Dao alone endures. Things cannot escape death, yet we alone do not die. Is this not the path beyond death?\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists focus entirely on the final step, even to the point of sacrificing their bodies for the Dao or giving their lives to benefit beings. Why?\n**Answer:** The Buddhists see that before heaven and earth took form, the ten thousand things had no names or appearances. What we call names and appearances now are merely illusory combinations arising from conditions, mistaken for true principle. If one awakens to true principle, this body and life are seen as impermanent, destined to vanish—cast them aside like rotting wood. The wish is only to benefit all beings; the Dao is practiced, not the body. Thus, they exhaust life to its end, for this one matter is crucial at the moment of death.\n\n**Question:** By your reasoning, then, the path to longevity is unnecessary?\n**Answer:** The unborn and undying are the true heart of heaven and earth. Many sages of antiquity attained this. To deny it is to slander the Dao; to affirm it is to find it rare. I fear that people cannot avoid death, so I urge early awakening to the final step—lest at the last moment they enter another womb. I do not dare say it does not exist, only that beings seldom attain it.\n\n**Question:** If one does not know tomorrow’s life today, how can one know death?\n**Answer:** The tradition says: \"Only the sage knows existence and extinction.\" The principle of life and death is not something ordinary people can grasp. But if you understand your origin, you understand your return. If you understand birth, you understand death. Yin and yang share a single principle; life and death are one path. Without realizing this essential point, how can one speak of the Dao?\n\n**Question:** After the four great elements dissolve, where does this final step ultimately rest?\n**Answer:** Few past masters have discussed this. When the illusory body’s four great elements dissolve, the four great elements of true emptiness endure forever. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"Originally pure and all-pervading, it fills the dharma-realm.\" A moment’s delusion at the final hour, and one creates the causes of rebirth, falling once more into a womb. This final step is truly inconceivable—difficult to fathom.\n\n**Question:** Does the true emptiness of the four great elements possess awareness?\n**Answer:** It cannot be seen by sight or heard by sound. Wondrous! The Three Caverns echo in emptiness—how resonant! Yet it is said: \"If there is sound and resonance, how can it be called true emptiness?\"\n**Answer:** Foolish as wood and stone! How can you speak of the Dao without grasping the sage’s subtlety?\n\n**Question:** You first practiced Chan, then later studied immortality. May I ask whom you studied under, and might I hear of your circumstances?\n**Answer:** In my youth, I saw Master Zihu weep over a dog, then return to his quarters and close the door. There, I awakened to the nature school. Later, in *The Awakening to Reality*, I grasped the meaning of the \"millet pearl\" and awakened to the life school. After twenty-odd years of war, though I endured hardships, I never neglected my practice. Once, on the road, I encountered a perfected one who transmitted the marvel of the firing times. Following it, I achieved verification within the expected time.",

      "translated_text": "Alas! The world lacks true discernment and cannot together propagate the great Dao—how lamentable!\n\n**Question:** The Complete Reality Teaching greatly resembles Buddhism. Why is this?\n**Answer:** The emptiness and spontaneity of Laozi’s *Dao*, its non-action and purity, are not unlike those of Buddhism. The arts of preserving form and nurturing life were but a reluctant concession by the sages—a secondary gate pressed open to guide those of gradual cultivation. The supreme vehicle flows in a single current; who but the sages could partake of it? The Complete Reality path is one of sudden cultivation, hence its resemblance to Buddhism.\n\n**Question:** What is meant by *sudden cultivation*?\n**Answer:** *Sudden* means *directly through*. Without traversing side-paths, without entering the gate of the fence, one seizes the supreme vehicle—this is the way of the golden immortals. To proceed by path to gate, by gate to hall, by hall to chamber: this is called *gradual*. As the *Classic of Purity* says, “Gradually enter the true Dao.”\n\n**Question:** Among ascension, immortality, and postmortem liberation, which is superior?\n**Answer:** When spirit and form are both perfected, one may ascend; when spirit is preserved and *qi* nurtured, one may achieve immortality; when form perishes but spirit remains, one may attain postmortem liberation. Ascension and immortality are not of this world, yet those who sit in death and leave their bodies behind—how can any age lack them? Superiority or inferiority lies in what one verifies; it cannot lightly be debated.\n\n**Question:** Is every case of postmortem liberation necessarily the Dao?\n**Answer:** Those who sit in death or stand in release must have cultivated and verified in life. Their conduct aligns within, their words manifest without. If they truly know the root of the great Dao, then at the moment of departure, with wind clear and moon bright, it may be called the Dao. But if their understanding of the mysterious principle is shallow, and they leave no words for the world, merely sitting in transformation like ordinary folk—what is extraordinary about that?\n\n**Question:** Why did Śākyamuni lie on his right side to enter *nirvāṇa*?\n**Answer:** *Nir* means quiescence and non-arising; *vāṇa* means eternal life and non-death. To reach the realm of neither arising nor ceasing—this is called the Dao. His lying on the right side and being encoffined with solemnity were to demonstrate conformity with worldly law, not differing from the multitude, so as to set an example for later generations and prevent reckless displays of the strange. When a person of the Dao departs, what need is there for any particular posture?\n\n**Question:** All scriptures say the Dao is not apart from the body, yet they also say that tears, saliva, essence, fluids, *qi*, blood, and the four great elements constituting the body are all yin—hence subject to aging and death. Then where is the Dao to be found?\n**Answer:** Before father and mother were born, this body did not exist. Once form arose, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, mind, spirit, *hun*, *po*, intent, old age, sickness, death, suffering, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness gathered and were named “one body”; divided, they were called the “four great elements.” Borrowed and conjoined, they are named “human”—hence they are called *yin*. Only the original true nature, that single spark of primordial yang, is called the Valley Spirit or the Mysterious Female. Within our body, this is the Dao—this is what achieves eternal life and non-death.\n\n**Question:** If so, can form be discarded and not taken up, and the Dao exist apart from the body?\n**Answer:** The body is the root, the mind the sovereign. Without the root, life has no foundation; without the sovereign, the Dao has no home. Only with body and mind can this Dao be realized. Without understanding the interplay of movement and stillness, without recognizing the master’s presence or absence, stubbornly clinging to the form of this born body—whether you discard it or cherish it, neither brings benefit. This Dao is not outside the body, nor within it; to separate from it is false, to grasp it is delusion. One must awaken to the point where spirit and form are both perfected—only then can the body be transcended while the body remains.\n\n**Question:** Can one attain the Dao without employing Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake, the crucible and furnace, firing times, lead and mercury, cinnabar and the like—without all these images?\n**Answer:** To ask this is, in the Daoist tradition, to speak of the Primordial Beginning of Floating Blackness; in Buddhism, of the Tathāgata of Empty Sovereignty; in Confucianism, of the Supreme Ultimate of the Prior Heaven. This Dao is inherently complete, requiring no cultivation. Whoever suddenly awakens to it finds that all the world’s scriptures, expedient metaphors, forms, sounds, and images—even the mechanisms of dragon and tiger, tortoise and snake—are no longer needed. To enter this Dao is called the supreme vehicle. If one has not yet done so, one must carve and chisel the undifferentiated, distinguish lead and mercury, exhaust principle and fulfill nature, return to the root and restore life, truly recognize the rootless—only then may one embody the realms of the Primordial Beginning, the Empty Sovereign, and the Supreme Ultimate. Those who do not follow models but directly verify it are said to awaken suddenly. Those who verify it through instruments and images are said to practice gradual learning. Though there may be differences in speed, their destination is one.\n\n**Question:** In the age of high antiquity, when writing had not yet arisen and the Three Teachings had not yet spread, by what did people learn the Dao?\n**Answer:** In the earliest times, people did not distinguish between sage and fool, wise and worthy; they did not know benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, or virtue; they had no grasp of the marvelous, the skillful, writing, numbers, or calculation. Human hearts were simple and honest, making the Dao easy to attain. But when Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor established the Dao, when Yao and Shun instituted laws, when the Three Teachings stood in parallel and the Hundred Schools flowed forth, people galloped in the arena of letters, pursued the debates of right and wrong, clung to texts and principles, and craft and pretense followed one after another. Thus, the more learners there were, the fewer succeeded. For this reason, the Great Master Bodhidharma transmitted the teaching from the West: “No reliance on written words, a special transmission outside the teachings, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing nature and becoming Buddha”—this set a standard for China, embodying the intent of high antiquity’s wordless age. If one can suddenly awaken and directly understand the source of the mind, then the Three Baskets of teachings may be dispensed with, and the Six Divisions of scriptures may be discarded. Laozi spoke of “cutting off learning to be without care,” Yongjia of “cutting off learning to be without action,” Zhuangzi of “cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom,” and Confucius of “I wish to be wordless”—when did they ever take writing as the Dao?",

      "translated_text": "Should one ask: *The Book of Changes* is a Confucian text—why do those who study immortality take it as their standard?\n\nI reply: Man’s form is modeled on Heaven and Earth, and *Changes* accords with Heaven and Earth; thus do scholars take it as their standard.\n\nShould one ask: Is there a Dao beyond the *Changes*?\n\nI say: The Dao of *Changes* begins with Qian and Kun, Kan and Li—this is the Dao of forms, and from it the School of Destiny is established. Before the One Qi coalesced and the Four Images divided, this was the formless Dao, and from it the School of Nature arises. The *Changes* with forms allows for the taking of images; the *Changes* without forms admits no names or words—this namelessness is the Dao beyond the *Changes*.\n\nShould one ask: The Way of the Golden Elixir follows the *Changes*—is this not cumbersome?\n\nI reply: My Dao resides in the Great Simplicity before separation, before the division of the Two Qi—what cumbersomeness is there?\n\nShould one ask: If Confucians master the *Changes*, are they not also immortals?\n\nI reply: Between Confucian and immortal, only a sheet of paper lies. Yet those Confucians study to seek worldly connections, amassing vast learning—though they refine their [ ] to their own use, they foster disbelief instead. This is how they differ from immortals.\n\nShould one ask: This disciple reads the *Triple Concordance* of the Golden Elixir, yet [ ] walks through a bramble thicket—might you offer a single word of guidance on the straightforward path?\n\nI reply: The elixir classics merely borrow images to clarify principles, use things to illuminate the mind. If one grasps the origin of nature and destiny, the subtlety of fire-times, then all images and things may be discarded, and the Dao of words forgotten. Why be turned by mere texts?\n\nShould one ask: Master, you are a Daoist priest, yet your words always encompass Buddhism—why is this?\n\nI reply: Though the forms of the head differ, the nature and principle remain the same. Though the teachings diverge, the Dao and Buddha have never differed in their root. Those who divide them are base scholars.\n\nShould one ask: Later generations may not understand and might mistake you for a Chan practitioner.\n\nI reply: Alas, is this so? I rectify nature and destiny through the Dao of immortality, and broaden wisdom through the study of the Buddha’s Way. The Dao of immortality does not die; the Dao of Buddha does not live. Neither dying nor living—this is the Mud-Pill Palace. The world does not comprehend this principle, clinging to one side, failing to realize the Great Vehicle, directing the mind narrowly, thinking only of themselves and not of all beings. Thus the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: There are ten kinds of immortals in the world, all of whom, among men, do not cultivate true awakening and, when their retribution is exhausted, return to the various destinies.\n\nShould one ask: Can the methods of fasting and ritual offerings lead to sagehood and transcendence?\n\nI reply: Before the Three Dynasties, such practices did not exist—they were merely methods of sacrifice. Among the followers of Laozi, they are called *jiao*; among Buddhists, *zhai*. Their words are nothing more than songs praising goodness. They bring three kinds of benefit: first, they inspire reverence in worldly people; second, they awaken the mind of generosity in worldly people; third, they benefit those who have left the household. If one relies on these to attain sagehood and transcendence, it is but a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow.\n\nShould one ask: What is the meaning of the inversion of yin and yang?\n\nI reply: The middle line of the two in Qian becomes Li; the middle line of the one in Kun becomes Kan. Li pertains to yin, yet is the sun; Kan pertains to yang, yet is the moon. Qian retreats and dwells in Kan; Kun retreats and dwells in Li. When Kan and Li unite, Qian and Kun restore their mandate. From below returning to above is called *return*; from the end returning to the origin is called *restoration*. This path of return and restoration is the inversion. Thus it is said: The sage swims against the current; the common person flows with it. Those who go against it form the elixir; those who follow it become mere things.\n\nShould one ask: The elixir texts match the sixty-four hexagrams to a month, two months to a day, and take the waxing and waning of each line as the fire-times—is this method not the most direct path?\n\nI reply: From the Great Ultimate, the One Qi splits to become Qian; two Qians become Kun. From Qian and Kun arise the sixty-four hexagrams, unfolding into three hundred eighty-four lines, accumulating into ten thousand and more—this is the Dao descending from its root to its branches. The sage, out of necessity, borrows the images of the *Changes* to match the Great Elixir. The wise person traces the current back to its source, cuts through the tangled silk with a single stroke, and works on the single word *one*. If one clings to images and follows the branches to their end, one will see only towering waves and vast surging waters. To seek outside rather than within the body—what delusion could be greater?\n\nShould one ask: What is the meaning of *bathing*?\n\nI reply: The fire-embryo is at *zi*, nurtured at *chou*, grows at *yin*, and bathes at *mao*. The water-embryo is at *wu*, nurtured at *wei*, grows at *shen*, and bathes at *you*. From *zi* to *yin* are the Three Yangs—this is the hexagram *Tai*. It is the position where fire is born, where the Two Qi are balanced, and above and below harmonize. Beyond *mao* is *Zhuang*, where yang’s vigor gradually increases and the yin path begins to depart—this is called *bathing*. Thus in the second month, the elm’s pods fall, for within yang there is punishment. From *wu* to *shen* are the Three Yins—this is the hexagram *Pi*. It is the position where water is born, where the Two Qi are balanced. Beyond *you* is *Guan*, where yin’s softness gradually increases and the yang path begins to depart—this too is called *bathing*. In the eighth month, the shepherd’s purse sprouts, for within yin there is virtue. Yang contains yin; yin contains yang—thus punishment and virtue bear each other, and day and night begin to divide. When refining the elixir to this point, cease the tally and do not move; nurture the original qi, bathe the Pearl of the Child, so that thoughts do not arise in the numinous terrace, cinnabar and mercury abide long in the golden crucible—like a newborn infant who must be bathed, so that this mind is pure, bare, and bright, like the full moon in the autumn sky, like a pearl on a fixed scale.\n\nShould one ask: The elixir texts speak of internal elixirs that prolong life and external elixirs that enable ascension—are external elixirs not merely worldly medicines?",

      "translated_text": "The answer is: The internal elixir is one’s own primordial qi. The external elixir is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. Yet this elixir fundamentally has no inside or outside—one’s own primordial qi is the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth, and the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth is one’s own primordial qi. Inner and outer cannot be separated even for a moment; what can be separated is not the Dao. The ancient immortals, fearing that世人 would know only the internal medicine and not comprehend the great Dao, forcibly established the names \"internal\" and \"external\" so that people might know this and thereby understand that.\n\nLater students often mistake external elixirs for worldly medicines—how could minerals, metals, herbs, and plants ever align with the wondrous workings of the original spirit of one’s destiny?\n\nSomeone asks: There are those who seek long life by absorbing yin to strengthen yang, indulging in the five pungent foods, wine, and meat to nourish themselves—can this be called the Dao?\n\nThe answer is: These are the perverse teachings of false masters who deceive the world, leading the purest yang into the filthiest yin, and mingling the clearest spirit with the most turbid qi. These are cattle, sheep, dogs, and horses—not of humankind. They are all seeds of hell; how can this be called the Dao? The perfected ones replenish with primordial essence and return it with primordial spirit, for this is the natural Dao of Heaven and Earth, not a technique of contrived effort.\n\nSomeone asks: How do the internal and external true elixirs unite?\n\nThe answer is: Humans are shaped in the likeness of Heaven and Earth; my body is equal to Heaven and Earth and does not fall short, my heart encompasses Heaven and Earth and does not exceed. The qi of Heaven and Earth is my qi, the essence of Heaven and Earth is my essence, the spirit of Heaven and Earth is my spirit. In movement and stillness, seeing and hearing, knowing and perceiving, this Dao never departs from my side. Yet世人 are ignorant of this and cannot reflect within, thus growing distant from the Dao. If one can turn the light inward, awaken to the original source, then the myriad images of the Three Powers all reside within one’s breast—where then is the distinction between inner and outer?\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who know internal refinement but do not comprehend the great Dao?\n\nThe answer is: Those who refine internally without understanding the great Dao can only prolong life. They are merely corpses whose essence and soul do not scatter; when their allotted span ends, they are reborn into the world—those with good fortune become human, those with meager fortune become other kinds. This is the fault of not comprehending the great Dao.\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who know the great Dao but do not practice, or know the internal medicine but do not refine it?\n\nThe answer is: Knowing but not acting is like someone describing food but never being full, speaking of treasure but never alleviating poverty. Though one may know, what benefit is there?\n\nSomeone asks: What of those who diligently practice but do not attain the true Dao, or study but do not encounter the authentic oral instructions?\n\nThe answer is:世上 are countless blind cultivators and misguided refiners who follow crooked paths and side trails. Though they may have a heart of diligence, they do not understand the great method, each clinging to their own views, relying on their own efforts, unwilling to draw near to good companions or seek out true friends. Their whole lives are thus wasted.\n\nSomeone asks: There are those who spend their years speaking of seeking and visiting masters, yet by the time their hair turns white, they gain nothing—whose fault is this?\n\nThe answer is: Among recent scholars, some carry a dead corpse and wander the rivers and lakes, only discussing where to spend the summer, where to endure the winter, where to beg for alms, where to find good food and drink.

      "translated_text": "Someone asks: Yang is dynamic, yin is quiescent—human nature is supremely quiescent. Does the learning of the Śākya clan not then belong to yin?\n\nThe answer is: Human nature precedes heaven and earth; it is the supremely quiescent and utterly empty Dao. The Three Powers and the myriad things all arise from it—it is the true ancestor of yang, the true source of life, the true root of spirit, the fundamental origin of all wonders. Yet people often fail to grasp its subtlety, mistakenly calling quiescent nature yin and dynamic life yang. For movement must take stillness as its substance, and stillness must take movement as its function—this is an inescapable principle of heaven and earth. Moreover, they do not know that within heaven and earth there exists an unchanging wonder, the master of the Three Powers and the myriad things. This quiescence does not follow the rise and fall of yin and yang, does not follow the coming and going of cold and heat, does not pass away with life and death, is not altered by the changes of past and present. It is neither within yin and yang nor beyond movement and stillness. It departs not from purity, yet does not mingle with turbidity. This is the learning of the Śākya clan. To call it yin is to miss its true wonder and lightly dismiss it as wrong. Those who cultivate the Golden Elixir without attaining such clarity are but followers of the Two Vehicles.\n\nSomeone asks: It is said that Master Xu Jingyang once mixed a grain-sized elixir with other medicines to sell, yet none who bought it ever encountered its power. Xu sighed, lamenting the rarity of true immortal talent. Does the elixir of immortals truly exist to deliver people, only for the world to miss it?\n\nThe answer is: When the primordial elixir remains unrefined and the great Dao of the Most High is obscured, to hope that immortals will deliver one with elixirs is like dreaming of food and drink, then waking to seek satiety—like dreaming of treasures, then waking to seek wealth. There is no difference. Elixirs are not said to be nonexistent; the ancients used them to prolong life. Though they may assist yang, they cannot achieve completion. For these are but the borrowed forms of metals, stones, herbs, and trees—how could they ever match the true elixir within our own bodies? Master Xu used them to test the worthy: if one had the karmic affinity for immortality, he would teach them the Dao. How could a mere grain of medicine grant immortality?\n\nSomeone asks: Immortality must depend on past-life affinities—it cannot be attained in a single day. Those like us, whose lot does not reach so far, fear it is too difficult to learn.\n\nThe answer is: In the inherent lot of every person, all is originally complete; in every heart, nothing is initially lacking. Only resolve the will, and you will not be led astray. If one directly abandons killing, theft, lust, desire, and casts off greed, anger, delusion, and attachment; if one grows weary of the world’s snares, deeply awakens the Dao-mind, seeks a clear teacher, and inquires of wise companions—suddenly breaking through the true mechanism and knowing where nature and life reside—then one may instantly become immortal or a buddha. How could it require three or four lifetimes, chasing shadows and following forms? To say one’s lot does not reach so far is merely a failure of the heart, a self-imposed retreat and surrender. If one claims to have no affinity in past lives, none in this life, and none in future lives, then one will be forever distant from the Dao.\n\nSomeone asks: Setting aside the flowers, sprouts, branches, and leaves, what is the most true, most correct, most essential, and most direct aspect of the Golden Elixir? Pray, grant a single word.\n\nThe answer is: The Golden Elixir is not a matter of many affairs—people multiply affairs themselves. The most true lies in one’s own spirit and qi. The most correct lies in the primordial lead and mercury. The most essential lies in the union of the two arcs. The most direct lies in the even regulation of the fire times. All else is but metaphor and discourse—though abundant, what use is it?\n\nSomeone asks: What is the meaning of the seven returns and nine refinements?\n\nThe answer is: Seven is the complete number of fire; nine is the complete number of metal. Seven and nine together make one catty. *Return* means returning to the root; *refinement* means reverting to the source. Combined, they form the two eights, paired as the two arcs—seven and nine are yang numbers. When metal and fire reach this point, yin and kidney are both dissolved, spirit and essence merge, like the moon becoming full as treasure, the Silver River’s waves stilled, a lone boat reaching shore, a traveler returning home. Having attained the root, one forgets the branches—this is called returning and refining.\n\nSomeone asks: Gathering the Five Phases, harmonizing the Four Images, the Three Flowers gathering at the crown, the Five Qi returning to the origin—all reside within this single body. Yet Master Ziyang also said: It is neither heart nor chest, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the cinnabar field, neither the valley passage, nor the bladder, nor the muddy pellet. What does this mean?\n\nThe answer is: Does *The Awakening to Reality* not say: To refine essence is to refine primordial essence, not the essence stirred by licentiousness; to refine qi is to refine primordial qi, not the breath of mouth and nose; to refine spirit is to refine primordial spirit, not the spirit of thoughts and intentions. Thus, this spirit and qi share the same root as heaven and earth, the same body as the myriad things. To attain them is to live; to lose them is to die. The sages’ intent shines as brightly as the sun and moon. Yet without this body, who would know the Dao? Without knowing the Dao, this body is but an empty vessel. One must align the person with the Dao, and the Dao with the person—thus it is said: spirit and form both wondrous, united with the Dao in truth. Master Ziyang, fearing that later generations would fail to understand the mysterious female’s aperture, would merely swallow essence, ingest qi, manipulate and massage, cling to the physical body, and secure their dwelling as the great Dao, spoke expediently to break their attachments. This is the body; this is the Dao—how could they ever be separated for even a moment?",
      "overlap_context": "sters, yet by the time their hair turns white, they gain nothing—whose fault is this?\n\nThe answer is: Among recent scholars, some carry a dead corpse and wander the rivers and lakes, only discussing where to spend the summer, where to endure the winter, where to beg for alms, where to find good food and drink. As for the medicines of inner and outer, the mechanisms of movement and stillness—when have they ever understood even a speck of it? The Dao does not fault people; people fault themselves.",

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: \"Within the year, one takes the month; within the month, the day; within the day, the hour; within the hour, the moment—thus, in the space of a single breath, the elixir of the Dao congeals. If this is so, then are all the fire-phases of the celestial cycle merely empty efforts?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The sages’ mechanism is swift as lightning; within a single breath, the workings of spirit may be verified. Yet while the elixir may congeal in the space of a single breath, it cannot be obtained in that instant alone. One must investigate ceaselessly, practice daily, and maintain it with unbroken continuity—subtly present, applied without strain—until one returns to the root and restores life. Then one may abide in stillness and constancy. One must not seek only the work of a single breath and thus squander a lifetime, nor should one cling to words and images, deluding oneself in vain.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The books of the Yellow River and Luo River are all systems of numbers. Yet the great Dao is formless, while qi and numbers possess form. Is the golden elixir also bound by numbers?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Before the Supreme Ultimate took form, images and numbers were hidden within the great Dao. Once the Supreme Ultimate arose, images and numbers emerged from the One. The One is the root of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the origin of the Five Phases and the Eight Trigrams. Though the great Dao is formless, it lodges its form in images and its position in numbers. Beginning with the Supreme Ultimate, it descends to become numbers, culminating in images and numbers, then returns to become the Dao. When sages discuss the golden elixir in terms of images and numbers, it is out of necessity. The sages must transcend the realm of images and things, the bounds of qi and numbers—how could they be confined to the mere patterns of images and numbers?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why must the Way of the golden elixir be spoken of in terms of numbers?\"\n\nThe answer: \"That which precedes the Supreme Ultimate is not discussed in terms of numbers. That which follows the Supreme Ultimate must be expressed through numbers. The superior adept forgets images and numbers to grasp the One; the middling adept relies on images and numbers to guard the One; the inferior adept studies images and numbers to seek the One. Without numbers, there would be no means to guide later learners—thus images are established as expedient teachings.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Kan (☵) and Li (☲) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome and unite; Zhen (☳) and Dui (☱) oppose each other, yet mutually overcome without uniting. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Qian (☰), the two central lines form Li; in Kun (☷), the single central line forms Kan. When Kan and Li unite, the bodies of Qian and Kun are restored. As the *Book of Changes* says: 'Water and fire shoot at each other,' thus achieving completion. Only the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li represent the union of central correctness. Zhen, Xun, Gen, and Dui are all partial unions. The golden elixir takes Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, for it draws upon the union of central correctness as the Dao. When Zhen and Dui shoot at each other, they create separation; in the hexagrams, this is *Guimei* (归妹), while Gen and Xun form *Gu* (蛊)—both are images of imbalance.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is the golden liquid returning elixir?\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Kan, the one and six combine to make seven, which is the completion number of fire—this is the true fire within Kan. In Li, the two and seven combine to make nine, the completion number of metal—this is the true gold within Li. When gold is refined by fire, it melts into liquid and descends to the kidneys, where it is called lead. When fire is tempered by water, it transforms into essence and ascends to the heart, where it is called mercury. The wonder of the returning elixir lies in the interplay of gold and fire; the wonder of their union lies in Kan and Li. When the golden liquid in the heart descends to return to the kidneys, this is called the golden liquid returning elixir.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"If one does not know the great medicine or the fire-phases, but merely accumulates merit and performs good deeds, can one attain long life and ascend as an immortal?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Among the immortals of the Three Realms and the buddhas of the ten directions, none have attained fruition without accumulating merit, performing good deeds, and cultivating causes. Among the five destinies, only humans can learn the Dao. If one wishes to attain long life and ascend as an immortal, one must clearly understand the fire-phases and the conditions of the great Dao. Without knowing its wonders, even if one accumulates merit and performs good deeds, one will only enjoy the blessings of humanity and heaven in the future. When those blessings are exhausted, one will still undergo rebirth—this is not the unborn and undying Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The Buddhist teachings on precepts are strict, detailed, and comprehensive, while the alchemical texts only speak of cultivation and refinement, barely mentioning fasting and precepts. Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts; without fasting and precepts, how can one practice the Dao? The Heavenly Worthy has the Nine Precepts and Forty-Nine Precepts; Xishan has the Ten Precepts for Cultivating Reality and the Twenty-Four Precepts—these are no less strict, detailed, and comprehensive than the Buddhist precepts. For those who study the Dao, without fasting, the mind of killing cannot be severed; without precepts, the desires of the will cannot be cut off. If even one precept is not cultivated, a hundred transgressions will disorder the mind. If even one desire is not dispelled, a multitude of evils will trouble the heart. If the six desires are not eliminated and the three poisons are not extinguished, the heart-snake will not die, and the mind-horse will gallop endlessly—can this be called the Dao? Those who claim that understanding the Dao alone suffices, without fasting and precepts, are followers of demonic spirits. How can they be worthy of mention?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Laozi said, 'Those who cling are unclear about the Dao and virtue.' Is the method of the golden elixir not close to clinging?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Clinging to the head of a dead snake without knowing change, being glued to the five desires without liberation, indulging in greed, anger, and delusion without turning back, committing killing, theft, and lust without awakening—all such actions, seeking blessings and coveting merit, are clinging, and thus cannot be called the Dao and virtue. The Way of the golden elixir silently moves water and fire, truly uniting with the mysterious origin—acting without acting, yet without non-acting. It begins in non-being and ends in being; yet in the end, it does not abide in being, and in the beginning, it does not abide in non-being. Like the autumn moon flowing in the sky, like idle clouds emerging from the peaks—pure and free, lively and fluid—this is the wonder of the golden elixir. Where is there any clinging?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"I wish to hear about the initial practice. What is it?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Move the mind without distraction, focus the qi to attain softness—like the handle of the Dipper circling the heavens, like the two wheels turning the hub. The ancient immortals said: 'Qi is the medicine that adds years; the mind is the spirit that directs qi. If you know the point where qi moves, you are already an immortal.'\"",

Wood corresponds to the liver, the eyes, the ethereal soul, and the perception of forms. When the eyes are enslaved by forms, the ethereal soul scatters; when the nose is enslaved by fragrances, the corporeal soul disperses. Wood resides in the east, metal in the west—these two cannot naturally mediate their union, hence they are said to be separated. To unite them, one must rely on the earthly branches *wu* and *ji*. Metal, born of earth, can thus restrain wood; wood, subdued by metal, returns to earth. Without this mutual restraint, the elixir cannot be formed. The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mind—when they pursue their objects—are all termed ‘separation,’ not merely metal and wood.\"\n\nSomeone asked about the essential meaning of the golden elixir.\n\nThe answer: \"It is the central harmony of the five qi, the blending of the hundred spirits.

Borrowing external images to match internal ones, not a hair’s breadth lies outside this body.\"\n\nSomeone said: \"Modern scholars are in disarray, each holding to their own doctrine—out of a thousand, not one agrees.

Then, like warmth bathing in a cool breeze, or cold basking in the gentle sun. The mouth forgets speech, the eyes forget sight, the nose forgets scent, the ears forget sound, the mind forgets thoughts, the body forgets existence—only the sense of a single, harmonious qi flowing naturally remains. Even this awareness fades, and one no longer knows how or why. Such is the state when the practice reaches its fruition.\"\n\nThey asked: \"Is this state called ‘spirit and form both wondrous’?\"\n\nThe answer: \"At that time, it is like a fish drinking water—cool or warm, only the self knows.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Is there anything beyond the wonder of the golden elixir?\"\n\nThe answer: \"There are paths that go beyond this, but they lead to side doors and are not worth pursuing as the Dao.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are not inanimate like earth and wood—how can one keep them constantly still throughout the twelve hours?\"\n\nThe answer: \"I never said to make them as dull as earth and wood in all twelve hours.

The six desires cannot seize the heart, the myriad phenomena cannot delude the will. The heart does not cling to things—how could things obstruct me?

Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The form is merely a burden in the world.

      "translated_text": "Ultimately, one must shed the womb and change the bones—how could one remain in the old dwelling without transformation?\n\nSomeone asked: \"The Venerable Master of Piling once said: *'If one cannot live a thousand or ten thousand years, why be a person in this world?'* Yet is this saying merely empty?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Were it not for the purple streets where flowers bloom like brocade, how could the golden oriole descend from the willow branches? If one did not speak of living a thousand or ten thousand years, how could people be persuaded to enter this gate? This is the ancient masters’ skillful expedient speech. If one truly attains the marvel of the Golden Elixir, then one’s life may surpass the touchstone and equal the emptiness of space. A thousand or ten thousand years are but a fleeting bubble upon the great sea—how could they be considered long?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master. I wish to hear the meaning of this.\"\n\nThe answer: \"In Qian, the two central lines form Li; in Kun, the one central line forms Kan. Once the Four Images are established, Wu and Ji reside in the Central Palace. Thus, Kan is received by Wu, and Li by Ji. For Kan and Li intermingle without departing from the positions of Wu and Ji. Yet Kan’s water and Li’s fire naturally contend with each other. It is only because Wu and Ji dwell in the center, generating control and mediation, that water and fire do not repel each other and can instead interact harmoniously. As Ziyang said: *'If Kan and Li lack Wu and Ji, though they contain the Four Images, the Elixir will not form.'* Thus, Kan and Li must take Wu and Ji as their master.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Metal and Wood are separated—are Geng and Jia also separated?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Metal lies in the West, Wood in the East; this is called separation. Yet through the movement of Kan and Li at the center, Wood conceals its form within Li, and Metal conceals its form within Kan, so they unite as one family. Geng is the place where the moon emerges—on the third day, the moon appears at Geng. Jia is the place where the moon becomes full—on the fifteenth, it is full at Jia. Thus, Geng is produced in Kun and receives Jia in Zhen. For Zhen, inheriting Kun’s body, is the eldest son, the place where the Great Medicine is produced and the beginning of the fire-timing. Hence it is said: *'The Medicine is produced in the southwest—this is its native land.'* Geng and Jia are the places of the moon’s birth and fullness—this is not what is meant by separation.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"There are those who do not understand themselves but engage in extreme asceticism—self-immolation, self-defenestration, self-starvation, self-mutilation—hastening the destruction of their bodies in pursuit of the fruit of the Dao. What is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The body is the tree of the Dao. When the tree stands, the fruit grows; if the tree withers early, the fruit perishes with it. Fools, not understanding the fundamental meaning, only make enemies of their bodies. With their minds still deluded, they burn themselves, sever their arms, leap from cliffs, drown in waters, abstain from grain, and starve themselves—inflicting suffering upon themselves, only to drift ever farther from the Dao. The Buddhist scriptures say: *'All the various external paths engage in all manner of strenuous ascetic practices—leaping from cliffs, plunging into water and fire, scorching their bodies with the Five Heats.'* These words are spoken precisely for such people.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Yet the ancients also burned their bodies, severed their arms, cut off their flesh, and sacrificed their lives—why was this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"If one hears the Dao in the morning, one may die in the evening. Those ancients had all heard the Dao and understood it clearly, so they regarded death as merely shedding a soiled garment or discarding worn-out sandals.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"In foreign lands, monks and Daoists all slaughter oxen and horses for sacrifices, consuming blood and flesh as their vegetarian offerings. Is it that such practices are permitted there but forbidden here?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The flesh of sentient beings is no different from the flesh of one’s own body. Those who leave the household life distinguish themselves from the worldly by upholding the precepts. Thus, they may serve as models for humans and gods, protecting and sustaining all living beings, transcending the realms of humans and gods. Those who drink blood and devour raw flesh belong to a different kind of external path—they sever the seed of great compassion and prolong the fruits of karmic retribution. How can they be spoken of in the same breath?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Nowadays, some claim that fish and meat are warming and can be beneficial, while vegetables are cold and, if eaten for long, diminish vitality. Should those who seek long life simply consume meat?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Those who favor fish and meat will say vegetables are cold; those who favor vegetables will say fish and meat are foul. Yet those who eat fish and meat are consuming sentient beings—sentient beings devouring one another without end. For those who study the Dao, killing is the foremost precept. How can they not be cautious?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"From where does the awareness of the human body arise?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Before this form was born, there was no awareness. Because form unites with qi, and qi gives rise to spirit, and spirit gives rise to consciousness, once these are complete, the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and the sufferings of hunger, cold, illness, and pain—all are universally known and universally perceived. All things of blood and qi are like this.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Can spirit attain long life? Can form avoid death?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Form is the root of spirit. If one nurtures form to the point of not dying, how could the nurturing of spirit ever end? When both spirit and form attain subtlety, this is the way of the highest immortals. Yet even those who leave their forms in the world, though they may live five hundred or a thousand years, ultimately cannot escape the transformation of the womb and the replacement of the cauldron. Form has its term, but spirit is without limit. How can they be spoken of as the same?\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Spirit is one—yet there are said to be yang spirit and yin spirit. I wish to hear the meaning of this.\"\n\nThe answer: \"Yang spirit is not the spirit of discursive thought and deluded念. This spirit is pure, still, luminous, and all-pervading, nowhere it does not reach. Though it emerges, it does not depart from the root fundamental wisdom. As the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: *'Without leaving the bodhi tree, one ascends the summit of Mount Sumeru'*—this is the unmoving wisdom that pervades all. Yin spirit is the spirit of stored thoughts and transformations. This spirit varies in function and becomes obstructed wherever it goes. When it emerges, it must depart from the root fundamental wisdom and often dwells near ghosts and spirits. Yang spirit is the way of heaven; yin spirit is the way of ghosts. Yang is numinous awareness, empty and mysterious; yin is dream-thought, inverted and confused. Scholars cannot fail to distinguish between them.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"What is root fundamental wisdom?\"\n\nThe answer: \"Root fundamental wisdom is the wisdom that existed before the empty kalpa. The Three Powers and the myriad things all embrace it.\"",

Why is this?\"\n\nThe answer: \"The form is merely a burden in the world. Consider the dragon and phoenix—if bound by worldly confinement, their forms are imprisoned, their natures caged, and they may ultimately face dismemberment and destruction. As Laozi said: 'My greatest worry is that I have a body.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Within the Jian'an Yangshan Daoist Abbey,\nRecorded by Mu Chang Chao,\nCompiled by Disciple Yishan Huang Benren\n\n**On the Supreme Polarity**\n\nSomeone asked about categories of the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** The generation of the Three Powers originates from the Supreme Polarity, but from what does the Supreme Polarity itself originate?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity originates from the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** And from what does the Ultimateless originate?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no origin; if it had an origin, it would not be called the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** What is the form of the Ultimateless?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless has no form; if it had form, it would have a limit.\n\n**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no form, why is it named the Ultimateless?\n\n**Answer:** It cannot be named; we forcefully name it the Ultimateless.\n\n**Question:** Are the Ultimateless and the Supreme Polarity one or two?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless is the Supreme Polarity’s non-being; the Supreme Polarity is the Ultimateless’s being. They are not two principles.\n\n**Question:** If they involve being and non-being, how can they not be two?\n\n**Answer:** From non-being, being is established; through being, non-being is revealed. They mutually serve as roots—two meanings, yet one principle.\n\n**Question:** The Supreme Polarity originates from non-being and is rooted in stillness. Why then does it have being? Why does it move?\n\n**Answer:** When non-being reaches its limit, being is born; when stillness reaches its limit, movement arises.\n\n**Question:** If non-being and being, movement and stillness, are opposed to the Supreme Polarity, does its original essence still remain?\n\n**Answer:** Being is born from non-being, yet non-being is fundamentally not separate from being. Stillness is born from movement, yet stillness is fundamentally unmoving. The original essence of the Supreme Polarity remains unchanged.\n\n**Question:** Does the Dao of the Supreme Polarity have above and below, inside and outside?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity is without direction; if it had above and below, inside and outside, it would become two Supreme Polarities.\n\n**Question:** If the One has no above or below, why does it have before and after?\n\n**Answer:** Before qi took form, the Supreme Polarity preceded heaven and earth. Once qi was divided, heaven and earth came after the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** Is human nature the same as or different from the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** Human nature is the nature of the Supreme Polarity. If its principle aligns with the Supreme Polarity, it is the same; if its principle differs, it is different.\n\n**Question:** Is the nature of things also the same as the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** Though their forms and vessels differ, their nature is the same.\n\n**Question:** If the Ultimateless has no image, how can it generate the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** The Ultimateless is purely principle. From principle arises qi. When qi and principle intermingle, it is called the Supreme Polarity—not that the Ultimateless generates the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity, by contracting, generate yang, and by stillness, generate yin?\n\n**Answer:** When stillness reaches its limit, movement is born; movement, unceasing, generates qi. Qi rooted in stillness is yin; qi rooted in movement is yang. When movement reaches its limit, yin is born; when stillness reaches its limit, yang is born. From beginning to end, it does not depart from movement and stillness.\n\n**Question:** How does the Supreme Polarity generate the Two Modes?\n\n**Answer:** Qi and principle envelop each other; yin and yang qualities are complete. What is united must separate, and thus it divides into two. That which is above form becomes heaven; that which is below form becomes earth.\n\n**Question:** How should one practice to align with the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** One must first comprehend the reality of the Supreme Polarity and awaken to the subtleties of principle and qi. Then, silently recognize it and embody it in practice. If one has not grasped this essential point and merely debates over texts or discusses names and principles, it is entirely without benefit.\n\n**Question:** Once this principle is understood, where does one rest?\n\n**Answer:** One rests in perfect stillness. If even a hair’s breadth of selfish desire arises, it is not genuine.\n\n**Question:** The human mind is perilous. How can it be entirely without movement? Would that not make one like wood or stone?\n\n**Answer:** There is a mind of peril, and there is a mind of subtlety. Subtlety is stillness. Curb movement and return to stillness—this is the stillness of the Supreme Polarity. Though there is no movement of thought, it is not the same as wood or stone.\n\n**Question:** Words suffice to convey meaning; why pursue this so exhaustively? Is this not pedantic?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao is what the Three Powers and the myriad things cannot be without for even a moment. If one could be without this Dao, then stars could emerge from the earth, mountains and seas could hang from the sky, spring could become autumn, and winter could become summer. If mere eloquence were the Dao, then the Confucian tradition would not need Confucius, the Chan school would not need Śākyamuni, and the Daoist tradition would not need Laozi.\n\n**Question:** Are the methods of self-cultivation and application in Confucianism the same as those in Daoism and Buddhism?\n\n**Answer:** The methods of self-cultivation are not different; their applications are not without distinction.\n\n**Question:** May I ask for details?\n\n**Answer:** The Confucians cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to govern the world. The Daoists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to preserve form and spirit. The Buddhists cultivate through the Supreme Polarity and apply it to equalize life and death.\n\n**Question:** If there is fundamentally only one Supreme Polarity, why do the Three Teachings and the hundred schools speak of so many similarities and differences? How is one to understand this?\n\n**Answer:** If one seeks understanding through words and phrases, even after eating three lifetimes’ worth of rice, one will not fully comprehend.\n\n**Question:** Then how is it to be understood?\n\n**Answer:** Unify the One to return to the One; meet its limit to return to its limit.\n\n**Question:** Is it wrong to grasp this mind as the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** At first, one grasps it; upon realization, one lets go. To grasp without letting go is stagnation; to let go without grasping is free flow.\n\n**Question:** If one lets go, does it not fall into neglect?\n\n**Answer:** Letting go into non-action is acceptable; one must not let go into deviance.\n\n**Question:** Does Buddhism also address the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** They speak of \"beginninglessness\" and \"true emptiness\"; these are merely different names for the original nature of the Supreme Polarity. Yet their subtlety surpasses even the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** When heaven and earth divide, the Five Phases and their images and numbers are precise to the finest detail, and the myriad things of human relations are as intricately carved—does this not imply a Creator within the primordial chaos?",

      "translated_text": "The Supreme Polarity, when yet unformed, conceals the Five Phases and their images and numbers within true nothingness. Once the Supreme Polarity divides, the Five Phases and their images and numbers manifest within wondrous being. The formation of the Three Powers and the nurturing of the myriad things—all arise from the spontaneous operation of the singular qi. For once the Supreme Polarity is established, it cannot but give rise to heaven and earth. Once heaven and earth are established, they cannot but generate images and numbers. Once images and numbers are complete, they cannot but produce human beings and things. Once human beings and things take form, their physical endowments cannot but differ. Once physical endowments differ, their lifespans and destinies cannot but vary. Flourishing and withering, beauty and ugliness, good and evil—these are the natural course of principle, and also the inevitable course of circumstance. Yet the creation of things from formlessness begins with the singular qi, transforming into the ten thousand existences, each conforming to its natural measure. How could there be a creator?\n\n**Question:** At the inception of heaven and earth, which came first—sun and moon, or water and fire?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Polarity divides into one yang and one yin. The Qian Dao is first established, and the two Qian form Kun, establishing the Kun Dao. Splitting the center of Qian yields Li, and the image of the sun is formed. Merging the center of Kun yields Kan, and the image of the moon is formed. The Four Images are established, the Eight Trigrams are arrayed, the Five Phases emerge, and the myriad things are born—none of which are not brought forth by water and fire. In the movement of heaven and earth, the sun and moon, the images of water and fire, come first.\n\n**Question:** Does the Dao of heaven have intention?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao is without intention; it takes the hearts of all people as its heart.\n\n**Question:** Yet it is said, \"Stimulated, it penetrates all\"—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Do you understand water? When you approach it, your form and shadow appear of themselves. Do you understand valleys? When you call out, there is always an echo. Do water and valleys have intention?\n\n**Question:** Heaven is said to belong to metal—is it truly metal?\n\n**Answer:** Kun is earth, and it is true earth. Qian is metal—is it not true metal?\n\n**Question:** Below the earth, one looks up to heaven as the pole. Above heaven, where is the pole?\n\n**Answer:** Above, there is only the natural emptiness of the void—it is the pole beyond poles.\n\n**Question:** If so, then heaven and earth have no root or stem?\n\n**Answer:** The singular qi of emptiness naturally transforms and forms them—how could there be a root or stem?\n\n**Question:** The Confucians speak of \"rectifying the heart,\" the Buddhists of \"illuminating the heart,\" and the Daoists of \"emptying the heart\"—are these three the same or different?\n\n**Answer:** \"Thought without deviance\" is rectitude; \"turning the light inward upon oneself\" is illumination; \"private desires unobstructed\" is emptiness. Though called three hearts, they are in truth one principle. From the perspective of worldly people, their teachings differ, but at the level of the sage, there is no difference.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhist teaching says, \"The heart itself is Buddha,\" and also, \"Neither heart nor Buddha\"—are these statements contradictory?\n\n**Answer:** \"The heart itself is Buddha\" is like obtaining the fish or catching the hare. \"Neither heart nor Buddha\" is like forgetting the trap or the snare.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists always speak of the heart, while the Daoists always speak of qi—are the heart and qi one or two?\n\n**Answer:** When the heart moves, qi follows; when qi moves, the heart follows. When the heart is unified, qi is also unified; when qi is unified, the heart is also unified. Yet qi is principle, while the heart is the mechanism of principle. All great undertakings proceed from our heart.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhists say that all hearts speak of emptiness—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Only through emptiness can one contain the ten thousand things.\n\n**Question:** If it contains the ten thousand things, then it is not empty.\n\n**Answer:** To contain the ten thousand things without obstructing them is like the great void embracing all things—it is not hindered by the vastness of space.\n\n**Question:** The heart has principle and has realm—what are principle and realm?\n\n**Answer:** \"Essence and unity\" are the principle of the heart. \"Affairs and things\" are the realm of the heart. \"Subtle, wondrous, and spiritually penetrating, unobstructed by things\"—this is the principle of the heart. \"Floating, restless, and competitive, chasing after forms\"—this is the realm of the heart.\n\n**Question:** If the heart moves once, one stops it; if it moves again, one stops it again—can this be the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** This is precisely the appearance of ceaseless arising and ceasing. One must stop it so that it does not move repeatedly. With long practice and discipline, when it is thoroughly tamed, it then becomes a single whole.\n\n**Question:** Is becoming a single whole the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** If at this point one clings to it as the Dao, it is like grasping a water-seeking mirror to obtain water. Not only will one fail to get water, but one will ultimately be hindered by the object. How much better to forget both!\n\n**Question:** Did the sages of old who illuminated the heart all attain this?\n\n**Answer:** Those who do not reach this level are not worthy of the name Dao.\n\n**Question:** People say that each heart is different—can this differing principle also become the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** All may be called the Dao, but they do not reach the level of the sage.\n\n**Question:** Some people begin good and end evil, while others begin evil and end good—is this not a matter of habit becoming nature?\n\n**Answer:** It is indeed formed by habit, all due to a lack of careful self-control. Those who begin good and end evil descend from human relationships to the level of beasts. Those who begin evil and end good rise from the level of beasts to human relationships.\n\n**Question:** For the hundred diseases, there are medicinal remedies. What remedies the sickness of the heart?\n\n**Answer:** The sickness of the heart is remedied by principle.\n\n**Question:** What if there are those who do not accept the remedy of principle?\n\n**Answer:** If the source of the sickness runs deep, one must apply the painful needle and moxa. If it does not heal, then death is all that remains.\n\n**Question:** When the heart is not at peace, what should one do?\n\n**Answer:** It is only because your thoughts do not cease and your delusions do not stop.\n\n**Question:** The heart and nature are but a single principle—is there a nature outside the heart?\n\n**Answer:** Nature is the substance of the heart; the heart is the function of nature. Nature is still; the heart is active. When the function of the heart is not moved, the substance of nature merges and harmonizes. The foolish seek nature outside the heart, while the wise see that nature is the heart—there is no other.\n\n**Answer:** It is only this square inch of space that is the heart—there is no heart outside this square inch.",
      "overlap_context": "Buddhism also address the Supreme Polarity?\n\n**Answer:** They speak of \"beginninglessness\" and \"true emptiness\"; these are merely different names for the original nature of the Supreme Polarity. Yet their subtlety surpasses even the Supreme Polarity.\n\n**Question:** When heaven and earth divide, the Five Phases and their images and numbers are precise to the finest detail, and the myriad things of human relations are as intricately carved—does this not imply a Creator within the primordial chaos?",

      "original_text": "答云：方寸，心机纽也。 此心弥满太空六合，机纽动则此心动，机纽静则此心静。 离方寸求心，非心也。 执方寸为心又非也。 或曰：心惟一理，又曰心为众理之郭，何也。 答云：天惟一月也，形应万水。 人惟一心也，事分万状。 然万水之月，一月所摄。 万状之心，一心所摄。 岂非心为之郭耶。 或问：吾儒止而后定，定而后静，静而安，安而虑，虑而得。 佛氏亦曰定静，又曰无一法可得，何也？ 答云：儒者以止、定、静为本，以安、虑、得为末。 苟不安其心而精虑之，则至善之德不可得明而也。 至善之德不明，则天下不可得而治也。 佛氏则不然，止然后定，静然后安，必便此心无虑而不可得，至於湛然空寂也。 虑而得治天下者，当然之理也。 无虑而不可得处空门者，当然之理也。 或曰：《书》云人心惟危，道心惟微。 人心道心，必有两样乎？ 答云：危者，动也。 微者，静也。 人心若静，便是道心。 道心若动，便是人心。 只是一个心，由动静所以分危微也。 或曰：天地之道，必不离动静乎？ 答云：太极因动静以立天地，一奇便有一偶，一主便有一宾。 三才万物不能须臾离乎动静。 可离者非道也。 曰：道必主静何也？ 答云：因三才万物之用，是以至道主乎静也。 问曰：至静之道，与三才万物之动静，有离合否？ 答云：至静者，指无极本体而言也。 即本体而有生生化化之妙，非谓离本体而别有也。 又非合本体而混成也。 阴阳二炁未萌，则此理寂然不动。 动静两机交媾，则此理感而遂通。 问曰：动静不离二炁，天下共知之，而至静之不动，吾实未喻也。 答云：一代一谢，一往一来，此阴阳之炁也。 故万物因之以生死，昼夜因之以明晦。 天地间非有不动之理，则圣人之道逐阴阳而起伏，随生死以往来，何足道也。 或曰：人心有不动之理乎？ 答云：人心不动之理，即天地间不动之理也。 曰：不动之理外，别有妙理乎？ 答云：御三才，齐生死，即此理也。 或曰：佛曰性空，孟子曰性善，荀子曰性恶，杨子曰性善恶混，然性非一也，由人物之异乎？ 答云：空者，性之妙。 善者，性之本。 笋杨失其妙本者也。 性者，万物之所公具，人得其妙本而不知用，物失其妙本而用不知，在乎得失之间矣，乌有善恶之异哉。 或问：先生常谓人身假合，然吾有身，无毫发外物，何为假合？ 答云：初假父母精血，次假阴阳二炁。 在胞则假母之呼吸，出胎则假母之乳哺。 眼假日月为明，命假饮食而生，耳假声而闻，鼻假香而嗅，舌假味而甘，身假衣而饰，意假知而思，热假风而凉，寒假火而温。 摩顶至足，无非假借，若一不假，则非全人。 天地中万物无不虚假而有。 子谓无毫发外物，非妄乎。 曰：身既假合，眼视耳听、鼻嗅舌味、手执足蹈，无非我之用，何也？ 答云：譬偃师之舜偶人，非假漆木为之乎。 合则成形，散则无象。 而吾此身，生则假之为用，死则弃之不知。 若非假者，合不死也。 既假而死，我何用处耳。 曰：身皆属假，何物为真？ 答云：不特人身假也，世间万物万事，无不是假。 其不假者，独性理也。 曰：万物万事皆假者，天地人伦亦假乎？ 答云：凡有貌象声色之物，皆属之假。 天地虽形器之久，亦不免假也。",
      "translated_text": "**Answer:** The square inch is the pivot of the heart’s mechanism. This heart pervades the vastness of space and the six directions; when the pivot moves, the heart moves; when the pivot is still, the heart is still. To seek the heart beyond the square inch is not the heart. To cling to the square inch as the heart is also not so.\n\n**Question:** The heart is but a single principle, yet it is also called the enclosure of all principles—why?\n\n**Answer:** The heavens have but one moon, yet its reflection appears in ten thousand waters. A person has but one heart, yet affairs manifest in ten thousand forms. Yet the moon in ten thousand waters is gathered into one moon; the heart in ten thousand affairs is gathered into one heart. Is this not the heart as their enclosure?\n\n**Question:** The Confucians say: \"Only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stability does one attain stillness; only after stillness does one attain peace; only after peace does one attain contemplation; only after contemplation does one attain attainment.\" The Buddhists also speak of stability and stillness, yet they say there is not a single dharma to be attained—why?\n\n**Answer:** The Confucians take stopping, stability, and stillness as the root, and peace, contemplation, and attainment as the branch. If one does not pacify the heart and refine contemplation, the virtue of utmost goodness cannot be made manifest. If the virtue of utmost goodness is not manifest, the world cannot be governed. The Buddhists are not thus: only after stopping does one attain stability; only after stillness does one attain peace—necessarily, this heart is without contemplation and unattainable, reaching the state of profound emptiness and quiescence. That contemplation attains the governance of the world is the natural principle. That without contemplation one enters the empty gate unattainable is also the natural principle.\n\n**Question:** The *Book of Documents* says: \"The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle.\" Are the human heart and the Dao-heart necessarily two different things?\n\n**Answer:** Perilous is movement; subtle is stillness. When the human heart is still, it is the Dao-heart. When the Dao-heart moves, it is the human heart. It is but a single heart—through movement and stillness it is divided into perilous and subtle.\n\n**Question:** The Way of heaven and earth—must it not depart from movement and stillness?\n\n**Answer:** The Supreme Ultimate establishes heaven and earth through movement and stillness. For every odd there is an even; for every host there is a guest. The Three Powers and the myriad things cannot for a moment depart from movement and stillness. What can depart is not the Way.\n\n**Question:** Why does the Way necessarily emphasize stillness?\n\n**Answer:** Because of the functioning of the Three Powers and the myriad things, the utmost Way emphasizes stillness.\n\n**Question:** Does the Way of utmost stillness, in relation to the movement and stillness of the Three Powers and the myriad things, have separation or union?\n\n**Answer:** Utmost stillness refers to the original substance of the Limitless. From this original substance arises the wondrous transformation of production and change—it does not mean there is something separate from the original substance, nor does it mean merging with the original substance to become indistinct. Before the two qi of yin and yang sprout, this principle is quiescent and unmoving. When the two mechanisms of movement and stillness intermingle, this principle responds and thus communicates.\n\n**Question:** Movement and stillness do not depart from the two qi—this the world knows. But the utmost stillness that does not move, this I truly do not understand.\n\n**Answer:** Alternation and decline, coming and going—these are the qi of yin and yang. Thus the myriad things depend on them for life and death; day and night depend on them for brightness and darkness. If there were no principle of non-movement in the world, the Way of the sages would rise and fall with yin and yang, come and go with life and death—what worth would it have?\n\n**Question:** Is there a principle of non-movement in the human heart?\n\n**Answer:** The principle of non-movement in the human heart is the same as the principle of non-movement in heaven and earth.\n\n**Question:** Beyond the principle of non-movement, is there another wondrous principle?\n\n**Answer:** To govern the Three Powers and equalize life and death—this is that principle.\n\n**Question:** The Buddha speaks of emptiness of nature; Mencius speaks of goodness of nature; Xunzi speaks of evil of nature; Yangzi speaks of the mixture of good and evil in nature. Is nature not one, differing only between humans and other beings?\n\n**Answer:** Emptiness is the wondrousness of nature; goodness is the root of nature. The others have lost this wondrous root. Nature is what all things universally possess. Humans attain its wondrous root yet do not know how to use it; other beings lose its wondrous root yet use it unknowingly. It lies in the difference between attainment and loss—how could there be a distinction of good and evil?\n\n**Question:** You often say the human body is a temporary convergence. Yet this body of mine has not a single hair that is an external thing—why call it a temporary convergence?\n\n**Answer:** First, it borrows the essence and blood of father and mother; next, it borrows the two qi of yin and yang. In the womb, it borrows the mother’s breath; after birth, it borrows the mother’s milk. The eyes borrow the sun and moon for brightness; life borrows food and drink to sustain it; the ears borrow sound to hear; the nose borrows fragrance to smell; the tongue borrows taste to savor; the body borrows clothing for adornment; the mind borrows knowledge to think; heat borrows wind to cool; cold borrows fire to warm. From the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, nothing is not borrowed. If even one thing were not borrowed, it would not be a complete person. Among the myriad things in heaven and earth, none are not empty and borrowed yet exist. You say there is not a single hair that is an external thing—is this not delusion?\n\n**Question:** Since the body is a temporary convergence, why then are seeing with the eyes, hearing with the ears, smelling with the nose, tasting with the tongue, grasping with the hands, and walking with the feet—all these functions—mine?\n\n**Answer:** It is like the wooden puppet made by the craftsman Yan: is it not also borrowed from lacquer and wood? When assembled, it takes form; when scattered, it has no appearance. This body of ours, in life, borrows it for use; in death, discards it unknowingly. If it were not borrowed, it would not die when assembled. Since it is borrowed and dies, where is the use of \"I\"?\n\n**Question:** If the body is all borrowed, what is real?\n\n**Answer:** Not only is the human body borrowed—all things and affairs in the world are without exception borrowed. What is not borrowed is only the principle of nature.\n\n**Question:** If all things and affairs are borrowed, are heaven, earth, and human relationships also borrowed?\n\n**Answer:** All things with form, appearance, sound, and color belong to the borrowed. Though heaven and earth are enduring vessels, they too cannot escape being borrowed.",

      "translated_text": "Human relationships—ruler and minister, father and mother, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, children—along with houses and fields, goods and wealth, servants and slaves, and all daily necessities, are without exception temporary assemblages. While this body of mine endures, these things exist; when this body perishes, they cease to be. Were they not temporary assemblages, both I and these things could be preserved forever. That which cannot be preserved forever—what is it if not temporary?\n\n**Question:** If heaven, earth, and human relationships are all temporary, then by what Dao should one cherish them?\n\n**Answer:** We borrow heaven and earth for their shelter and support, borrow ruler and minister for governance and order, borrow father and mother for birth and nurture, borrow brothers for friendship and aid, borrow wife and children for posterity, borrow fields and gardens for sustenance, and borrow wealth, goods, servants, and slaves for practical use. While I have a body, I am close to them; when I have no body, I am distant. Judging by this, what is not temporary? The world cherishes things—this is how I cherish the Dao.\n\n**Question:** Is the human heart also temporary?\n\n**Answer:** Those who grasp its temporariness see it as temporary; those who grasp its reality see it as real. In all the world, that which is not temporary is rare indeed.\n\n**Question:** The human heart has no form—what can it borrow?\n\n**Answer:** If one reaches the state of no temporariness, then it is not temporary. But if even a trace of emotion remains, or a trace of attachment to things lingers, one cannot escape temporariness.\n\n**Someone asked:** Confucius said, *\"If I cannot yet serve men, how can I serve ghosts? If I do not yet know life, how can I know death?\"* Did Confucius not understand this?\n\n**Answer:** Ghosts and spirits have no form yet keep their word; life and death follow fate and remain constant. Confucius was not ignorant of this—he simply did not speak of it often in his teachings of worldly governance, lest he confuse the world. When Ji Shi pressed him with such questions, he answered as he did. Had Gautama or Laozi asked, he would not have answered thus.\n\n**Question:** Did only Gautama and Laozi understand life, death, ghosts, and spirits?\n\n**Answer:** That which returns after death is called a ghost; that which abides in life is called a spirit. Ghosts, spirits, life, and death are one and the same principle. Those who deny life and death also deny ghosts and spirits; those who understand ghosts and spirits understand life and death. The enlightened know this—why must it be Gautama or Laozi?\n\n**Someone asked:** You often speak of the impermanence of all things—what does this mean?\n\n**Answer:** *\"Permanent\"* means enduring, unchanging. All things arise and perish in illusion—they cannot last forever. Hence, they are called impermanent.\n\n**Question:** Even those who cultivate the Way cannot escape impermanence—why is this?\n\n**Answer:** Without exception, this body is a vessel of blood and pus. Youth inevitably ages, life inevitably ends in death. Thus, the sage transcends the body to preserve it—how could they alone escape impermanence?\n\n**Someone further asked:** If impermanence cannot be escaped, why cultivate the Way?\n\n**Answer:** Cultivate my conduct to align with the sage’s conduct. Cultivate my heart to align with the sage’s heart. There is no other pursuit.\n\n**Someone asked:** Among Confucius, Laozi, and the Buddha, who is superior?\n\n**Answer:** Like a physician’s shopfront—its success depends on who opens it. Their hearts are equally devoted to saving lives.

      "translated_text": "If it is untransmitted, why then speak of *\"a special transmission outside the teachings\"*?\n\n**Answer:** The principle of this special transmission does not involve scriptures or doctrines. The worldly fail to awaken and stubbornly demand answers from others, unaware of turning inward. Everywhere under heaven—wherever one’s head or face may turn—nothing is not the Great Dao. Whatever is casually grasped is a treasure. To seek further for this special transmission is surely mistaken.\n\n**Question:** The scriptures say that those who awaken may transmit the sagely Way. Does this not mean there *is* transmission?\n\n**Answer:** Only upon awakening does one realize it is one’s own possession, and thus may transmit it to the sagely Way. Without true awakening, what is there to transmit?\n\n**Someone asked:** Can those who maintain a vegetarian fast and abstain from meat attain the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Fasting is merely the precept against killing. If one eats only vegetables yet does not sever the mind of killing, it is ultimately of no benefit.\n\n**Further asked:** Can upholding the precepts lead to attaining the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Precepts serve to guard against evil. All sages and worthies attained the Dao through precepts. Yet without severing the mind of evil, it is also of no benefit.\n\n**Someone asked:** When a practitioner of cultivation dies, do they re-enter the womb?\n\n**Answer:** Only when one becomes master of the body will they not re-enter at death.\n\n**Question:** How does one become master and avoid re-entry?\n\n**Answer:** Through lifelong cultivation and realization, with steadfast concentration, one thoroughly recognizes the original nature. At the moment of death, the mind remains undisturbed. Then one becomes master of the body and does not re-enter.\n\n**Someone asked:** Before parents were born, where was this body?\n\n**Answer:** Before parents existed, there was clearly nothing. Only through the union of conditions did the womb form, and the burden of form and substance arose.\n\n**Question:** When form and substance perish, where does this body go?\n\n**Answer:** It returns to the same state as before birth—clearly nothing.\n\n**Question:** If there is nothing, then there is no existence. Why then speak of rebirth?\n\n**Answer:** Fire has no inherent form; wood is its root. Bubbles have no inherent form; water is their root. Humans have no inherent form; parents are their root. How could they not be born?\n\n**Further asked:** Does rebirth exist or not?\n\n**Answer:** Those who act with the mind of beasts will, upon death, become beasts. Those who live with the mind of humans or heavenly beings will, upon death, return to humans or heaven. This is an unchanging principle—how can there be no rebirth?\n\n**Question:** Do *you* undergo rebirth?\n\n**Answer:** If I possess the mind of rebirth, I cannot escape it. If I am without the mind of rebirth, I will not fall into it.\n\n**Someone asked:** Where do you go after death, having cultivated the Way?\n\n**Answer:** I will neither be born in heaven nor descend to hell, neither remain in the Southern Continent nor depart to the Western Land.\n\n**Question:** Then where do you go?\n\n**Answer:** Abiding in stillness, unmoving, without coming or going, pure and originally so, pervading the Dharma realm. With the body of liberated meaning, I am free and at ease.\n\n**Someone asked:** Ghosts and spirits have no form—they appear as mere emptiness. Why then are there ghosts and spirits?\n\n**Answer:** Beings of blood and qi possess form and thought. Wood and stone possess form but no thought. Ghosts and spirits possess no form but have thought. *Form* refers to material obstruction; *thought* refers to latent perception. Though ghosts and spirits lack material obstruction, their consciousness and perception are the same as in beings. Just as a person’s latent thought can dwell in form and linger, traveling ten thousand miles in an instant—whether in pursuit of fame, wealth, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, or grief—all is as if personally experienced. The way of ghosts and spirits is precisely thus.\n\n**Someone asked about supernatural powers.**\n\n**Answer:** The spirit is the wondrous, awakened essence of nature. Among the three realms and the myriad things, it arrives without haste and pervades without movement. It can conceal heaven and extend heaven’s lifespan, conceal earth and extend earth’s lifespan. It enters water without drowning, enters fire without burning. The sun, moon, and stars; wind, clouds, and weather; metal, stone, grass, and trees; mountains, rivers, and seas—among the eighty-four thousand teachings of right and wrong, none can obstruct its spirit. Unhindered in all directions, it is called *tong* (penetration). This can be known through inner realization, but is difficult to exhaust in words.\n\n**Someone asked:** Are the principles of the Golden Elixir and Buddha-nature the same or different?\n\n**Answer:** Though the Buddha entered through the nature school, he never departed from the life school. How do we know this? The Buddha’s teachings always begin in the East and circulate through the ten directions. The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* repeatedly enumerates tens of distinctions—five celestial numbers and five terrestrial numbers. The fifty-three spiritual advisors visited by Sudhana, including himself and Vairocana, total fifty-five—does this not correspond to the numbers of heaven and earth? Moreover, the *Lotus Sūtra* speaks of two Buddhas in one stupa. The dragon girl transforms and becomes a Buddha in the South—*dragon* is *qian* (☰), *South* is *li* (☲). Is this not *qian*’s middle yin becoming *li*? Transforming from female to male—is this not *kun*’s (☷) middle yang becoming *kan* (☵)? The wonders of *qian*, *li*, *kun*, and *kan* are subtly concealed within. Further examples: the four-line verse and the one form; the two honored ones; the twin trees of the twin forests; the two adornments and two wisdoms; the swastika on the chest; the twin wheels on the feet. Are these not all expressions of the interpenetration of nature and life? From this, we know that Buddha-nature is no different from the Golden Elixir. Those who claim the Buddha belongs solely to the nature school are merely shallow scholars of inferior understanding.\n\n**Someone asked:** Does the cultivation and nurturing in Chan practice also align with the Golden Elixir?\n\n**Answer:** The Chan school takes awakening as its principle. Those of the highest capacity attain Buddhahood in a single awakening. Without traversing paths or engaging with yin and yang, where mind and action cease, and words and speech are cut off—this is the pure wonder of true emptiness. This is the supreme vehicle, difficult for lesser learners to reach. The method of Chan sitting in silent contemplation is roughly similar to fetal breathing and breath retention, and its nurturing is not far different. Moreover, the Chan school has the matter of \"after the barrier is opened,\" such as a minister bowing to the emperor or a child approaching the father—this is the wonder of a single pulse with dual perfection, the same as the principle of return and reversal in the Golden Elixir.",

Their hearts are equally devoted to saving lives. I cannot judge their superiority.\n\n**Someone asked:** You often speak of *\"the one matter beyond all others, which a thousand sages did not transmit\"*—is this not your delusion?",

      "translated_text": "**Question:** What is the difference between \"true emptiness\" and \"stubborn emptiness\"?\n\n**Answer:** \"True emptiness\" refers to the mysterious, numinous, and unobstructed. \"Stubborn emptiness\" refers to dead ashes and withered wood. Stillness without movement is the essence of true emptiness; responsiveness without obstruction is its function. As for stubborn emptiness, it is a thing of annihilation, devoid of nature, lifeless and inert.\n\n**Question:** The Buddhist school exhaustively discusses emptiness and nothingness, asserting that the four elements, six senses, consciousness, and perception are not truly ours. Then what is the Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Before our parents were born, this form did not exist. After birth, the six senses and four elements arose, and with them, consciousness and perception. All that constitutes this body is illusory, a temporary aggregation. Observing its origin, it was fundamentally nonexistent—this is not mere rhetoric from the Buddhist school. Their exhaustive discussion of emptiness and nothingness aims only to align the essence of the heart-mind with the great void, ensuring not even a thread of worldly burden clings to it. This is their Dao.\n\n**Question:** Is the supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir the same?\n\n**Answer:** The Dao of the perfected immortals is no different. Laozi said: *\"Observe emptiness as empty; the emptiness of emptiness is empty. When what is emptied is nonexistent, even ‘nothing’ is nonexistent.\"* What could be more extreme in emptiness and nothingness than this?\n\n**Question:** The *Heart Sutra* says, *\"Illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty.\"* Does the practice of the Elixir reach this state?\n\n**Answer:** The first line speaks of *\"Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva.\"* *\"Observing\"* means reflecting inwardly upon the heart-mind, free and at ease. Next, *\"illuminating and seeing the five aggregates as empty\"*—at the moment of observing the heart-mind, one directly perceives that the five heaps of this body are utterly empty, leaving only a single spark of original yang wisdom, luminous and unwavering. These two lines are beyond the reach of heavenly and earthly paths, revealing the Buddhist school’s mastery. For *\"observing\"* is concentration, and *\"illuminating\"* is wisdom. All sages and worthies attain the Dao through observation and illumination. How could the method of the Elixir be otherwise? This is indeed the Dao of the perfected immortals.\n\n---\n\n**Golden Elixir Verses**\n\nThe Returned Elixir is nothing but true gold and fire;\nGold is original essence, fire is the heart-mind.\nSpirit-fire and essence-gold refine each other,\nTrue gold melts into fire, fire fuses with gold.\n\nIf fire blazes too fiercely, the gold’s qi dissipates;\nIf gold is stubborn and fire cold, harmony is hard to achieve.\nWithin the crucible, the radiance of gold and fire ever abounds—\nA single grain of numinous elixir never withers.\n\nMercury is spirit, lead is qi;\nQi and spirit originally precede the Great Nothing.\nOne must gather them from the root-source of heaven and earth,\nAnd refine them in the suspended crucible.\n\nThe five metals and eight minerals are all mundane things;\nHerbs and trees, roots and stems, have form and substance.\nTo recognize the Returned Elixir as a formless medicine,\nRefine it from the heart-mind.\n\nTake one’s own heart-mind as the crucible,\nUse original spirit to enact the Great Return.\nRefine a crucible of heaven-and-earth’s marrow,\nEver manifesting the cold radiance of precious light.\n\nDo not seek among the Three Powers or Eight Trigrams,\nNor trace gold and fire to their year of birth.\nKnow that this medicine precedes heaven and earth,\nExisting before the Three Powers and Eight Trigrams.\n\nPeople are the ancient and modern seekers of the medicine,\nYet few find it, for it is not merely sought by man.\nThough gold and fire fill heaven and earth,\nWithout the human heart-mind, where could they reside?\n\nThe primordial qi is my qi,\nMy original spirit is heaven-and-earth’s spirit.\nHeaven, earth, and my spirit are of one body—\nWondrously, a single qi turns the great potter’s wheel.\n\nElixir verses number in the thousands and tens of thousands,\nBut without understanding the Mysterious Female, discussion is futile.\nIf one is a hero of numinous spirit,\nDragon, tiger, tortoise, and snake are swallowed in a single gulp.\n\nThe fire-timing may as well be told to you:\nThe crow of Kan and the hare of Li must be balanced.\nWith heart at ease, intent settled, and spirit unified,\nThe tiger roars and dragon sings—heaven and earth are spring.\n\nThe hare chases the golden crow into the sea gate,\nThe crow follows the hare’s spirit up Kunlun.\nIn an instant, the fire-timing circles heaven and earth—\nWho in the world recognizes the original source?\n\nWhen the seven emotions are stilled and the heart-mind untainted,\nThe five qi gather at the origin, and intent does not arise.\nAt the double-eight gate, one must bathe;\nA ball of harmonious qi levels the two arcs.\n\nThe black dragon’s pearl is nurtured in the bosom,\nThe heavenly treasure held in the hand.\nIn a blink, never forget constant vigilance—\nA single cycle of celestial fire gives birth to the infant.\n\nThe fire-timing originally is only the heart-mind;\nWhen the heart-mind is focused, qi is warm and bright.\nConcentration’s waves and wisdom’s torch aid each other—\nThe great medicine and Returned Elixir form in an instant.\n\nPeople today do not recognize the root of fire,\nFalsely transmitting reckless methods of civil and martial timing.\nThis fire originally has no qi or timing,\nVastly pervading the Dharma Realm across the three thousand worlds.\n\nWhen the root of discipline is pure and free of dust,\nThe waves of concentration’s water settle, and the moon of wisdom shines.\nAlone, it illuminates, ever luminous and unwavering—\nThe Returned Elixir may be perfected directly.\n\nDiscipline severs the hundred evils and removes all wrongs;\nConcentration halts dispersion and gathers the numinous.\nThe lamp of wisdom reverses the illumination of dark paths—\nWhy fear the waters of the Flower Pool remain impure?\n\nIn refining the Elixir, discipline comes first;\nTo govern dispersion, rely solely on concentration’s steadfast power.\nTo brighten the ailment of darkness, wisdom’s illumination is needed—\nMastering these three is called immortal Chan.\n\nThe iron ox and wooden horse circle the long river,\nThe stone tiger and mud dragon sing in grand chorus.\nThe four beasts—where have they gone?\nIn vain, one waves and calls to the Yellow Dame.\n\nThe six bandits are captured and brought to the mercury chamber,\nThe five aggregates are seized and taken to the lead ford.\nCasually moving the original yang fire,\nThey are smelted into the full moon wheel of autumn’s sky.\n\nThe crimson palace is silent, its double doors sealed;\nThe yellow hall issues commands, guarding the city strictly.\nThe four barbarians surrender with hands clasped, planting their banners—\nWithout wielding weapons, the five bandits are captured.\n\nThe first arc seeks the latter arc,\nThe latter arc must seek the former.\nThe two things never leave the body’s left and right—\nA full moon wheel over the five lakes in autumn.\n\nThe dragon rides the fire-borne Yang Lord,\nThe tiger drives the wave-borne moon wheel.\nBreath circulates, encircling heaven and earth—\nFrom Kunlun’s summit to the sea’s depths, all returns to spring.\n\nThe purple river chariot rises from the sea’s edge,\nAscending the layered towers to reach the Jade Capital.\nPassing through the palaces of sun and moon,\nIt enters the crimson palace and proceeds to the yellow court.",

      "translated_text": "**Composed by Mu Changchao of Jianshan Daoyuan in Jian’an**\n**Edited by Huang Benren of Yishan**\n\n**Two Poems on the Elixir Ancestor**\n\nThere is an Ancestor of the Golden Elixir,\nEver abiding within the ten thousand images.\nHeaven and Earth are called its father,\nSun and Moon are named its elder.\nMaster of the spirits of all kinds,\nRoot of the nature and life of all beings.\nShould one comprehend this,\nOne may speak of the elixir’s work.\n\nTo learn the Golden Elixir’s initial task,\nBegin first with the Supreme Ultimate and the Qian Dragon.\nXun is the maiden, originally dwelling in Zhen,\nKun gives birth to the infant, lodged in Dui’s palace.\nCrow and Hare, Tiger and Dragon form images beyond,\nMercury and Lead, Water and Fire reside within the body.\nWho can fathom Geng, Ding, Xin, and Bing?\nAsk the Primordial Elder of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Five Poems on Illusory Existence**\n\nWhere was there self before father and mother were born?\nThrough deluded movement, form first took shape.\nThe six roots and four great elements cling together,\nReceiving yin and yang, called a human being.\nEyes, ears, nose, and tongue each serve their function,\nColor, sound, fragrance, and taste all falsely abide.\nThe body is the dwelling of greed, anger, folly, and desire,\nThe mouth is the gate of eating, drinking, and right and wrong.\nEarth, water, fire, and wind joyfully unite in illusion,\nWife and children, gold and treasure briefly seem dear.\nThis body borrows the qi of yin and intestines,\nWhen qi perishes, where was this body ever real?\nAll things in this body are naught but illusion,\nOnly the single spark of primordial yang is numinous.\nCalled the indestructible vajra,\nThrough a hundred refinements, it grows ever more luminous.\nAll things in the world are but illusory existence,\nFrom the beginning of the prior heaven, they were originally none.\nShould one awaken to illusion and return to true nature,\nOne is a great man in the world of men.\n\n**Five Poems of Admonition**\n\nIf the ten evils of body and mind are not eradicated,\nCultivation is but wasted effort.\nThis is the seed of the six destinies’ wheel,\nTo seek immortality is but a dream.\n\nWine, lust, anger, wealth, and craving—\nIf even a trace remains, the Dao is hard to approach.\nThis is the mouth of a ten-thousand-fathom abyss,\nHow many in Jambudvīpa has it ensnared?\n\nA speck of dust burdens the heart, and it is not enlightened,\nHalf a mote of anger or folly, and the Dao is not attained.\nOnly when originally there is not a single thing,\nMay one meet and speak of the unborn.\n\nTo eat one’s fill of meat, garlic, and the five pungents\nIs called strengthening qi and nourishing spirit.\nThe arts of nine-and-one yin absorption are but side doors,\nAll are causes for future hell.\n\nThe ancients avoided desire as they avoided arrows,\nOr as one shuns a deep pit or a poisonous snake.\nIf one does not avoid it, one must lose one’s life—\nHow then can one find leisure to inquire of cinnabar?\n\n**Five Poems on Avoiding Harm**\n\nBury light, conceal shadow, hide one’s mechanism,\nLet not dragon, snake, tiger, or leopard know.\nHonor and disgrace are both snares,\nHow much more when one lacks kin to avoid the Zhou era’s perils?\n\nFame and profit are nooses around the throat,\nWealth and nobility are like shackles on the hands.\nFortunate is one free from the bonds of throat and hands—\nIn the depths of mountain clouds, one nurtures the rare and subtle.\n\nMisfortune first, fortune follows—act not,\nThe blazing power of the halls of might—approach not.\nOnly bind oneself to the companionship of apes and cranes in green mountains,\nLet others laugh at me as foolish.\n\nWorldly toil, inch by inch, is a pitfall for men,\nEverywhere, cast aside your weapons and move not recklessly.\nThe six desires and five properties must be shunned,\nAbide in peace, follow fate, and delight in one’s life.\n\nTo attain the art of longevity in cultivation,\nFirst learn the way of preserving the body and avoiding harm.\nFish must hide deeply where hooks cannot reach,\nBirds must soar high where arrows cannot wound.\n\n**Five Poems on Equalizing Self and Things**\n\nShould one wish to cultivate and learn the utmost truth,\nForget the heart, forget things, forget even emotion.\nIf the slightest hindrance lingers in the breast,\nThe ten thousand images, dense and manifold, will never be at peace.\n\nWhen I forget mechanism, things forget mechanism,\nWhen self and things forget each other, all seems lost.\nBirds sing of themselves, flowers fall of themselves—\nWho knows the message therein?\n\nThe four marks in the Buddha’s sutras must be none,\nThe three voids of Laozi must coincide.\nLife and death, existence and extinction are of one body—\nWhere then can I seek my present self?\n\nThe three powers share one root, things share one origin,\nWithin the Supreme Ultimate’s vast embrace, who is self, who is other?\nI know not even that this body is myself—\nFrom what place then arise estrangement and kinship?\n\nAmid the ten thousand images, the body alone stands revealed,\nBody and heart, the ten thousand images—all are at leisure.\nThe ancient and wondrous secret is not many—\nWherever one is without heart, there is the great return.\n\n**Five Poems on Returning to the Real**\n\nThe four great elements, six roots, and consciousness—\nSpeech, breath, all are not real.\nWhen all is released from the body,\nFrom where then arises this self?\n\nThe prior heaven’s Supreme Ultimate originally had no thing,\nThis form of mine is but deluded arising.\nIf perception, hearing, and seeing are not grasped,\nWho then can bear sorrow, joy, suffering, or bliss?\n\nHeaven and Earth, the ten thousand things—originally not existent,\nDreamlike forms and bodies—all are false.\nOnly the great, perfect, equal wisdom\nAdmits no emotion, knowledge, or heart’s knowing.\n\nThe wondrous secret of returning to the real lies in constant capacity,\nNot knowing the constant, deluded action brings misfortune.\nTo recognize that ancient and present are one constant body,\nWondrously fuse the ten thousand dharmas in the midst of the midst.\n\nBeyond the body, the real is preserved,\nWhere there is no thing, the real is not unreal.\nWhen heart and realm fuse in utter stillness,\nOnly then does one see the original person.\n\n**Five Poems on Shattering Attachments**\n\nWhen Zhun and Meng have not yet settled dawn and dusk,\nI urge men of this age not to speak recklessly.\nIn a moment’s effort, the elixir may be congealed—\nFive years, nine years are but empty transmission.\n\nGrasp the mystery of Qian, Li, Kun, and Kan,\nWhy labor to circulate the heavens according to the trigrams?\nSimply take the single flavor of primordial yang fire,\nRefine it to the void before the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nTo seek a steed by following a picture is but wasted effort,\nTo cling to forms and be bound by texts is vain labor.\nI tell those who would learn immortality:\nAt midnight by the sea gate, the sun is red.\n\nRecognize the single true spark of primordial yang,\nThe five phases and eight trigrams are but empty divisions.\nThere is a thing, formed before heaven and earth,\nWhy trouble to seek Wu and Wen?\n\nEasy to speak of, hard to do,\nTo learn the books of the elixir is not the elixir.\nWearing out straw sandals in vain search,\nIt is attained only in a moment’s time.\n\n**Five Poems on Teachings and Instructions**\n\nThroughout the dharma realm, all is the great Dao,\nYet fools still seek it in the Great Brahma Heaven.\nThey know not that the Primordial Beginning’s Floating Black Soil\nIs but the inch-long heart of sentient beings.\n\nThe ancients provisionally set forth teachings and instructions\nTo guide the common stream toward the sagely current.\nHad the purple paths not been adorned with flowers like brocade,\nHow would the noble scions have come to vie in their sport?\n\nCranes cry, phoenixes sing, displaying fine sounds,\nDragons descend, tigers crouch, ghosts and spirits revere.",

to Speak**\n\nDark, silent, rootless—\nNot dependent on yin-yang or images and numbers.\nAll marvelous skills under heaven can be learned,\nOnly this one matter is hardest to speak.\n\n**Four Poems on Absolute Illumination**\n\nHeaven and earth, the ten thousand things—clearly existent;\nWhen the heart is forgotten, the ten thousand things vanish.\nForgetting qi, forgetting spirit, still absolute illumination—\nVast and empty, where to seek the present self?\n\nThe slightest thought or worry clouds the heart,\nInstantly differing from the original state.\nEven the radiant and unveiled is still delusion—\nWho knows the Great Mystery’s emptiness?\n\nRecognizing the foundation of the mysterious origin,\nFrom action one must reach non-action.\nNot knowing transcendence, one clings in vain—\nWhen the house collapses, the master cannot be moved.\n\nThose of shallow roots and inferior understanding,\nSeeing these words, call it \"yin-spirit\" or \"fallen into Chan.\"\nNot grasping the wondrous perfection of the Great Elixir,\nŚākyamuni was originally the Golden Immortal.\n\n**Preserving to the End**\n\nForty years—impermanence presses daily;\nPrepare now for death’s arrival.\nWillows wither, flowers fade—signs of age,\nDuckweed gathers, wealth floats—chaos of the world.\nAncient ways scatter with the vulgar tide,\nYouth departs, white hair arrives.\nEven the turtle hiding in its shell cannot escape—\nHow much less should one stretch forth the head to invite calamity?\n\n**Mid-Autumn at Fifty**\n\nFavor and disgrace are but bubbles and illusions,\nAll seen and heard is empty and fleeting.\nThe Heavenly Heart rests only in perfect balance;\nThe principle of Dao returns to the ultimate stillness.\nThe ten thousand things, vast and boundless, are all delusion;\nThis toiling body—what more does it seek?\nI ask you, moon of the mid-heaven—\nHow many autumns remain in a fifty-year life?\n\n**The Dao Abides**\n\nThinning hair, falling teeth—no need for alarm,\nFor the true heart remains unchanged.\nThe Dao of old and present never ages;\nOnly the body’s beginning and end lack long life.\nA hundred rivers flow straight to the sea;\nA single moon hangs pure in the sky.\nCarrying no worldly cares in the breast,\nEmptying all possession—this is the constant practice.\n\n**Returning to Reality**\n\nWithout awakening, one vainly divides the schools of nature and destiny,\nMonkeys fling themselves from trees, fire wheels blaze red.\nSuch principles must return to reality—\nWhich human heart is not tinged with emptiness?\nOnly because dust and toil obscure life,\nHas the awakened nature lost its clarity.",

      "translated_text": "**Gazing Serenely at Human Inquiry**\n\nShould one gaze serenely at the laws of humankind,\nAll worldly laws become as one.\n**Plain Truth**\nThe ancestral lineage never bestowed laws upon others—\nOnly when hearts mirror one another is it fitting.\nWithout understanding the principles of yin and yang’s nurturing,\nHow can one grasp the heart of heaven and earth’s creation?\nThough the Three Powers are divided into high and low,\nA single pulse has never been severed through ancient and modern times.\nThis is but plain and evident truth—\nWhy seek it east or west?\n\n**Quiet Contemplation**\nIn quiet sitting, examine closely:\nWhat in this world is short, and what is long?\nFrom ancient times to now, all share the same heaven and earth,\nYet dynasties succeed one another, how many emperors have there been?\nInch by inch, the land becomes a battlefield;\nField by field, the grasses and trees vie in the arena of fame and gain.\nAll ten thousand transformations rush by as emptiness—\nOnly the original heart remains unchanged.\n\n**Fundamentally the Same**\nConfucianism and Daoism, revered for their wisdom in the world,\nShare the same primordial pulse.\nLearning must reach subtlety before words can convey;\nAwakening to the true mechanism, principles naturally merge.\nGoverning the world, how can one forget great righteousness?\nJoyful harmony must reach the mysterious void.\nHow many are needlessly vexed by cleverness—\nFacing life and death, they remain obstructed.\n\n**No Contention**\nSince all waters must flow toward their source,\nOnly unity and purity hold fast to the center.\nThe Three Teachings need not oppose one another—\nThe One Origin ultimately returns to harmony.\nThe *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* are indeed the foundation of human relations,\nWhile Buddhism and Daoism can fathom the workings of creation.\nWithin this, why debate right and wrong?\nA single household’s gate opens to ten thousand families.\n\n**Certainty**\nAmid the haste of daily exchanges,\nThe master differs from the multitude.\nLike floating clouds and flowing water, the heart knows no rivalry;\nAfter the rain, the moon’s light and wind’s clarity merge of themselves.\nOnce settled, life’s arising is not true principle;\nUpon awakening, what matter does not return to emptiness?\nDid the ancients not speak truly?\nOnly the common and mediocre remain obstructed.\n\n**The Supreme Learning**\nThough the supreme learning is said to eschew books,\nThe teachings still require written support.\nThe One Origin’s foundation is not truly existent,\nYet how dare one say the Three Treasuries’ texts are absent?\nGoverning the world must unfold through benevolence and righteousness;\nCultivation must discern the paths of life and death.\nDo not dismiss the learning of the heart as mere words—\nWhen awakened to the mysterious void, all are ultimately not distinct.\n\n**One’s Fundamental Duty**\nReading books must ultimately seek to penetrate principle;\nLearning the Dao first requires recognizing the original heart.\nIf principle is not grasped, books are read in vain;\nIf the heart is not awakened, the Dao is hard to find.\nThere is no wisdom beyond life and death—\nIn vain does one boast of brilliance across ancient and modern times.\nI urge the people of the world to awaken:\nDo not let ease lead to complacency.\n\n**Following Conditions**\nIn old age, one’s comings and goings are left to heaven;\nWith whatever strength and time, one forms good affinities.\nI do not wish for fame in a flourishing age—\nOnly to pray for a peaceful end to my remaining years.\nAt this stage of life, one knows true fortune;\nOnly at life’s end is one’s existence preserved whole.\nYet I recall the days of captivity—\nWho could have foreseen today’s poems?\n\n**Recovery from Illness**\nGoodness can avert evil and extend years—\nBut what goodness should come first?\nThe native landscape’s radiance ever shines bright;\nThe moon of the nature-sky remains clear and lovely.\nEach day, advance with acts of kindness;\nAt every opportunity, press forward with good deeds.\nI urge the people of the world to apply themselves:\nA virtuous heart truly moves the August Heaven.\n\n**Curbing Greed**\nA level heart and upright path are sound strategies;\nDiligent toil in livelihood surpasses preemptive cultivation.\nThough a thousand days of scheming may bring wealth,\nA single overturned bowl of water may be hard to recover.\nSeek little, eat little, spend little;\nDeceive not, covet not, plot not.\nThis is the way to peace and joy in life—\nI urge you not to wait until disaster strikes.\n\n**Flattering Ghosts**\nHow shameful that people of this age lack self-awareness,\nFailing to cultivate good plans from the heart.\nOf my kind, how can one bear to deceive and rob?\nWhat merit do ghosts have that one flatters and supplicates them?\nIgnoring the suffering of the world’s poor,\nYet in the unseen realm, retribution is swift and sure.\nA little foresight in one’s conduct\nOutweighs a thousand taels spent on preemptive rites.\n\n**Exploiting the People**\nAll beings are originally free of affliction—\nGood and evil arise from the heart.\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial, aiding only virtue;\nHuman nature, once altered, becomes calamity.\nHarming others for self-gain is still greed for fortune;\nUsing the Buddha’s name to amass wealth.\nThis is no long-term strategy—\nPlanting seeds of goodness may instead sow seeds of misfortune.\n\n**Kindness to Others is Best**\nNot fearing the law of the land nor the King of Hell,\nYet seeking blessings and long life from the Azure Heaven.\nEven if one pushes the heart to give generously,\nHow does it compare to lending without demanding repayment?\nSqueezing fat and scraping flesh for wealth,\nMolding Buddhas, adorning gods, staging rituals.\nHow much better to show a little kindness to others—\nNearly extending one’s own blessings, distantly benefiting one’s descendants.\n\n**Universal Exhortation**\nLoving fame, loving profit, loving to delve into the mysterious—\nSeeking both Dao and worldly gain.\nFailing to grasp the great human relations, like a snail measuring the sea;\nNot understanding the true Dharma, like peering at the sky through a tube.\nOnly with no heart and no things is one in the Dao;\nExhausting oneself and others, how can one become immortal?\nI urge the bustling worldly folk:\nThe King of Hell will one day tally your wages.\n\n**Admonishing the World**\nAlas, the cycle of life and fate—\nLocked within the heavy gates of the five desires.\nA hundred years of life are but a dream;\nA thousand schemes and ten thousand calculations are not as good as leisure.\nDo not let white hair fill your head;\nEven with cinnabar, one cannot preserve youth.\nWhen the time comes, yield to the recluses—\nClose your door, pillow high, amid the clouds.\n\n**Few Walk the Path**\nWho among the bustling throng awakens to the floating life?\nDebating the extraordinary and the mundane, all hasten toward dusk.\nAll ten thousand forms under heaven bear flaws—\nOnly water in the world remains free of contention.\nThe heart, once settled and free of worry, is unburdened;\nPrinciple, when exhausted, becomes self-evident.\nThis Dao, from ancient times to now, is ever smooth—\nYet how few truly walk its path.\n\n**Four Inabilities**\nWater cannot wash away accumulated goodness;\nFire cannot burn the homes of the good.\nThieves cannot plunder the wealth of the good;\nOfficials cannot confiscate the deeds of the good.\n\n**Four Prohibitions**\nIn the heart, do not scheme against others’ livelihoods;\nIn speech, do not speak ill of others.\nBehind their backs, do not harm others;\nAfter death, do not betray others’ trust with their wealth.\n\n**Four Equalities**\nA level heart surpasses burning incense;\nFair scales surpass almsgiving.\nAn even ruler surpasses fasting;\nAn impartial measure surpasses offering rituals.\n\n**Four Inequalities**\nWith the brush, do not write unjust petitions;\nIn the treasury, do not store ill-gotten gold.\nBefore others, do not speak unfair words;\nIn the world, do not harbor an unjust heart.",

      "translated_text": "**Reception of Kin**\nWhen kin and friends arrive,\nNo grand reception is prepared.\nSoft-cooked white rice,\nWild greens boiled to tenderness.\nNoon meal and evening rest—\nOnce given, not repeated.\nThis is the family’s true way,\nWith nothing amiss or hindered.\nThose who understand matters,\nDo not complain, do not complain.\n\n**Inscribed at Liangyuan Temple, Moved by the Times**\nBorn not in Yao’s reign of peace,\nHow many hardships have I known?\nFive years of reform and governance,\nThrice have I seen the clash of arms.\nThe people toil beyond all measure—\nWhat does Heaven intend?\nAmid the thatch, I sigh in sorrow,\nMy poem done, I scratch my empty head.\n\n**Inscribed at Liangyuan**\nWind sweeps the scroll, moon serves as lamp,\nAfter rain, green moss carpets the ground.\nThe petty spirits have lost their power, the man is gone—\nFalling blossoms and weeping birds grieve of themselves.\n\n**Inscribed at Chongqing Hall**\nThe first yang wanes, the second yang begins,\nSpring reaches the root of heaven at the second line.\nAt year’s end, the clear wind stirs the willow’s eyes,\nThe mountain’s chill lingers, rain clears from the plum’s tips.\nThe Lord of Spring may not favor peach and plum,\nYet spring’s hues must come to the thatch and grass.\nFrom here, the three yangs draw near to open prosperity—\nWho says my Dao is bound to the gourd?\n\n**Three Poems on Late Spring**\n**I**\nLife has passed fifty years,\nAnd now five more have gone.\nTwin temples whiten like autumn reeds,\nA lone lamp in the night rain.\nEyes dim, I still make out the words,\nHeart weary, I neglect my poems.\nThe homeland lies far, far away—\nWho here truly knows me?\n\n**II**\nLate third month in Jiangnan,\nPetals fall sparse around the trees.\nSpring departs like a swift steed,\nTime flies with the crow and hare.\nDust stings both eyes,\nThe self and world—both forget their schemes.\nAll past affairs are but dusty traces—\nOne should return on a white horse.\n\n**III**\nIn this world of men,\nA hundred schemes cannot match idleness.\nThe heart, unburdened by things,\nFinds the cosmos wide.\nToiling in dust laments white hair,\nWhile springs and stones love green mountains.\nWhen will this restless clamor end?\nSpring departs, autumn wanes again.\n\n**Three Poems on the Joy of Idleness**\n**I**\nWhat joy is there in the world?\nOnly idleness preserves the self.\nIf one cannot be idle for a day,\nWhy be a man in this world?\nChasing and striving bring many troubles—\nHow much better to cut all ties.\nLife and death are but a dream,\nWealth and rank cannot compare to idleness.\n\n**II**\nWealth and rank are easily sought,\nBut pure idleness is hardest won.\nI only fear my hair will whiten—\nWho understands the heart’s release?\n\n**III**\nWealth and rank are easily sought,\nBut pure idleness is hardest won.\nI only fear my hair will whiten—\nWho grasps the heart’s true ease?\n\n**Two Poems on Worldly Estrangement**\n**I**\nThe road is cut off, travelers few,\nThe mountain high, the clouds deep.\nI stand apart from worldly affairs,\nYet the Dao does not bar the human heart.\nA hundred years—so brief a scene,\nLike an arrow flying past.\nRed dust laments swift aging,\nThe white sun shirks pursuit.\n\n**II**\nLate spring—two poems:\nSpring departs, turning not back,\nRed sparse, green fills the branches.\nIf the self is enslaved to things,\nWhen can the Dao be realized?\n\nThough spring rushes away,\nMy heart remains unchanged.\nAfter blossoms fly and wind stills,\nClouds scatter, the moon shines clear.\n\n**Two Poems on Touching Things**\n**I**\nGardens and groves shed crimson everywhere,\nCourtyards desolate—scenes transformed.\nThis is but the misfortune of flowers in their time—\nWhy single out the spring wind for blame?\n\n**II**\nWhy does Heaven’s work grow weary of arrangement?\nBranches remain dry, buds yet unopened.\nYou only know to pluck and break them—\nIs there no one to come and cherish the blossoms?\n\n**Thatched Hut at Lingyan**\nI gather thatch to roof my hut near the mountain hall,\nPaper for curtains, bamboo for my bed.\nNot to flee fame and embrace bitterness,\nBut to forget the toil of this dust-bound life.\nBamboo draws wind like a green feathered fan,\nPines lift the moon as a night-shining pearl.\nEvening mist veils the curtains, rosy clouds drape the hangings—\nSuch a scene even kings cannot rival.\n\n**Thoughts on the Past**\nWildflowers transplanted by the green willow bridge,\nBranches ablaze, red as burning fire.\nThe old garden’s springtime grows thin,\nAutumn winds strip it bare, turning all desolate.\n\n**Sudden Rain**\nClouds mass like iron cavalry, rain pours in torrents,\nA thousand miles of mountains and rivers drowned in ink-dark gloom.\nIn an instant, the long wind scatters cloud and rain—\nOnce more, I walk the old mountain path.\n\n**Lamenting Disaster**\nIn the winter of *jiawu* (1294), tenth month of the *Zhiyuan* era,\nThunder, lightning, and freezing rain for thirty days—\nThe next year brought great famine.\nThirty days of rain in the tenth month,\nThunder rolled across distant lands.\nGrain sprouted white ears,\nVegetables rotted yellow at the roots.\nThe world knows not the ways of old,\nHeaven’s seasons too have changed.\nThe Dao’s mood turns to earth and wood—\nI write this to mourn the times.\n\n**Diamond Clapper**\nThe knowing clap their hands without error,\nChasing echoes and sounds, tangled as hemp.\nThe Great Being never spoke the hymn—\nWho knows where the bright moon has fallen?\n\n**Hemp Robe**\nA thousand strands, ten thousand ropes woven into a robe,\nCasually draped, clinging to the skin.\nOriginally nothing—why bind the self?\nRecall the moment of emerging into the world.\n\n**Hoe**\nWood for the handle, iron for the blade,\nForged with hammer and tongs.\nThough weeds overgrow the temple hall,\nWith a few strokes, the palm is made level.\n\n**Four Poems on the Illusory Body**\n**I**\nThe city of birth, old age, sickness, and death,\nThe den of sorrow, grief, suffering, and torment.\nA thousand years of toil—vainly spent,\nA hundred years of life—a true passing guest.\nSilks and brocades encircle a pit of piss and shit,\nWine and meat conceal a sack of pus and blood.\nGreedy for wealth, lustful, ever more deluded—\nThey study the Dao, meditate on Zen, yet understand nothing.\n\n**II**\nThe illusory body is but a breath,\nIf the breath ceases, death comes instantly.\nIn a moment, the body rots, unbearable to smell—\nWhere are the rich, the noble, the heroes now?\n\n**III**\nPeople only know to nourish the body,\nYet cannot fathom nourishing their life.\nThe body is a false thing, bound to decay,\nBut life is the immortal sage of endless being.\n\n**IV**\nI thank my ancestors and parents,\nFor giving me this body—a joy to be born a man.\nNot to die by the sword in this degenerate age—\nIf not now, when shall I cultivate the Way?\n\n**Two Poems: Cease Studying the Dao**\n**I**\nNo seeking surpasses seeking,\nJoy surpasses joy—yet joy breeds sorrow.\nHow many times have I pondered this?\nWhy not cease studying the Dao?\n\n**II**\nCunning schemes, cunning schemes—laboring the mind,\nGreed and delusion, greed and delusion—never turning back.\nAffliction upon affliction—endless affliction,\nWhy not cease studying the Dao?\n\n**Two Poems: Breaking Delusion**\n**I**\nWind and thunder drive the sudden rain,\nDarkness engulfs the great void.\nIn an instant, wind and thunder scatter—\nAll returns to the old emptiness.\n\n**II**\nGreed, attachment, delusion, affliction,\nHave clouded minds from ancient times to now.\nWhen afflictions scatter in a single morning,\nThe original heart remains unchanged.",

not belong to impermanence?\n\n**The Suffering of Birth**\nWhen form is born, suffering is born with it—\nsuffering is rooted here.\nAs consciousness and nature gradually awaken,\ndesire and emotion accumulate into habit.\nIn youth, beauty and charm flourish,\nwhile fame and profit know no idle day.\nAlas, to labor this heart—\nhow is it different from a fleeting instant?\n\n**The Suffering of Old Age**\nOnce-lustrous features differ from former days,\nskin wrinkles, the face darkens.\nHair falls, teeth and gums loosen,\neyes dim, spirit and qi exhausted.\nFalling leaves in late autumn’s frost,\nthe fleeting light laments the setting sun.\nAlas, the feelings of all things—\nwhat does not reach its extreme in this?\n\n**The Suffering of Illness**\nThe four great elements fall out of harmony,\nqi wanes, blood flows sluggishly.\nIn prime years, joy and indulgence,\nin old age, sorrow arrives at last.\nBitter pain must be borne alone,\nmoans and groans—who can take one’s place?\nGold, jade, brocade, and embroidery—how wondrous,\nyet sorrowful thoughts make one too weary to look.\n\n**The Suffering of Death**\nThe four great elements part as one,\nall conditions are cast aside.\nWealth and honor end here,\nwhere are the heroes now?\nThe vast wind through white poplars,\nthe desolate green grassland.\nWith no return ever again,\nfor all eternity, tears flow in vain.\n\n**Four Poems on the Yin of Form**\nGreed, love, anger, delusion, and false thoughts—\nlust, deceit, killing, theft, and deluded folly.\nForm, sound, fragrance, and taste—all yin things;\nto seek flying spirit is surely impossible.\nFame, profit, love, and thoughts of gods,\njoy, anger, speech, song, and laughter.\nEarth, water, fire, and wind—no true substance,\nskin, hair, bones, and flesh—all belong to yin.\nHeavy yin and excessive emotion must sink,\nlight yang and refined essence naturally rise.\nSpirit congeals, qi wondrous, empty and luminous—\nin the azure vastness, an empty song summons the Jade Clarity.\n\nRefine the heart, refine the qi, refine the spirit,\nrefine until pure yang unites with the true Dao.\nIf even a trace of yin matter lingers,\nyou will never see the

seven reversals,\nyou are a divine immortal and a buddha.\n\nLaughing *hehe*—\nwhether cultivating immortality or buddhahood, it is all up to you.\nBuddhadharma calls it the *mind-ground seal*,\nthe

      "translated_text": "According to the records and traditions, in former times, the Perfected Lord of the Northern Dipper descended into the home of Master Lan in Qufu County, Gunzhou. He called himself the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty and addressed Master Lan, saying: \"The primordial qi is the Great Dao, and within the sun it is the Radiant King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the original qi is the Perfect Dao, and within the moon it is the Transcendent King of the Dao of Filial Piety; the mysterious qi is the Dao of Filial Piety, and within the Dipper it is the King of Filial Piety and Fraternal Duty. When filial piety reaches Heaven, the sun and moon shine brightly; when filial piety reaches Earth, the myriad things flourish; when filial piety reaches the people, the kingly Way is accomplished. From the Upper Clarity heavens downward, I have manifested in the human realm to demonstrate and expound the Dao of Filial Piety. In the Later Jin dynasty, there shall be a transcendent named Xu, who will transmit my lineage of filial piety and fraternal duty, becoming the foremost among all immortals.\"\n\nThereafter, the transcendent Xu indeed transmitted the Dao of Filial Piety, teaching and transforming the world. He lived to the age of one hundred thirty-six, and his entire family of forty-two members ascended to heaven in broad daylight. To this day, on the Western Mountains of Longxing, his deeds remain resplendently evident.\n\nFilial piety is the foundation of all conduct, the root of all virtues. Whether attaining immortality, becoming a buddha, achieving sagehood, or realizing worthiness, none do not arise from the Dao of Filial Piety. Heaven and Earth and the Three Luminaries exert themselves in filial piety—how much more should humans? Moreover, the toil and labor of parents, their boundless and measureless kindness—of their many kindnesses, these ten are the most widely known in the world. Now, I have briefly illustrated them with diagrams and added instructive annotations, universally exhorting the people of the world to practice filial piety and fraternal duty together.\n\nIf one is unfilial to parents or disrespectful to elders, even if one serves the Buddha and the Dao with reverence, observes fasts, and performs rituals with diligence, such merit does not extend to one’s kin and is of no benefit to the Dao. These are all authoritative sayings; I humbly wish that they be respected and not neglected.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Jiang Yue and Lin Daochao.\n\nThe Ten Good Deeds of Humans and Devas\nThe Three Good Deeds of the Body",

      "translated_text": "**The Three Good Deeds of the Body**\n\n**1. Refraining from Killing**\nTo cherish life and abhor killing is the fundamental heart of Heaven and Earth. If one can uphold this precept, blessings and virtue will flourish deeply. In this life, one’s years will be prolonged; after death, one will be free from guilt. Among all households that accumulate goodness, refraining from killing is the foremost.\n\n**2. Refraining from Theft**\nTo take what is not given is theft. If one can uphold this precept, one will avoid bringing disaster upon oneself. In life, one may suffer official punishment; in death, one may fall into hell. Among the violent and wicked of the world, thieves bear the greatest shame.\n\n**3. Refraining from Sexual Misconduct**\nThe cycle of the four forms of birth revolves with lust as its root. If one can uphold this precept, one’s lifespan will be extended. Harming the spirit and defiling virtue, one wastes essence and depletes qi. For one who values life, this is the greatest taboo.\n\n**The Three Good Deeds of the Mind**\n\n**1. Refraining from Greed**\nThe afflictions of the world arise from the bonds of craving and attachment. If one can be free from greed, afflictions will naturally cease. The sea of desire is profound; the river of attachment is boundless. If one does not seek liberation, one will surely drown.\n\n**2. Refraining from Anger**\nThe mind of anger is like fire, blazing and unbearable. If one can uphold this precept, forbearance and humility are supreme. Strife, lawsuits, and violence endanger the body and disgrace one’s kin. The ruin of families and the loss of livelihood arise from nothing but anger.\n\n**3. Refraining from Delusion**\nThe deluded lack wisdom, wandering in darkness like one who walks at night. Without self-reflection, one will surely fall into the abyss. Wine, lust, wealth, and temper—greed, folly, and perversity—those who persist in delusion are no different from beasts.\n\n**The Four Good Deeds of the Mouth**\n\n**1. Refraining from False Speech**\nTo speak falsely confuses human sentiments. Disasters and wars arise from falsehood. If one does not speak falsely, even ghosts and spirits will trust and turn toward one. The sages and worthies of the Three Teachings all speak of the absence of falsehood.\n\n**2. Refraining from Frivolous Speech**\nTo adorn one’s words with ornate embellishment is to conceal wrongdoing and gloss over faults. It covers flaws and harbors resentment and calamity. Words without embellishment, a heart of loyalty and integrity—these are the foundations of profound virtue, the accumulation of hidden blessings through generations.\n\n**3. Refraining from Divisive Speech**\nTo sow discord between ruler and minister, to sever the bonds of flesh and blood, is to invite disaster and enmity, to ruin families and overthrow states. Those who engage in divisive speech speak ill behind others’ backs and flatter to their faces. In life, they suffer punishment; in death, they fall into the Hell of the Plowshare.\n\n**4. Refraining from Harsh Speech**\nTo utter foul and vile words is to spread poison and filth. To curse and revile, whether high or low, is to inflict pain to the marrow. The four deeds of the mouth are the gates of right and wrong. If one can uphold these precepts, the Dao and virtue will endure.\n\nTo refrain from these ten transgressions is to practice the Ten Good Deeds; to violate them is to commit the Ten Evils. Whether one becomes a Buddha, an ancestor, an immortal, or a human, all arises from the cultivation of good karma. The teachings of the Great Brahma Heaven, the Jade Emperor, and the Buddhist precepts are the Dao of the heavens above. Those who practice the Ten Good Deeds will root their goodness firmly, deepen their blessings and virtue, ensure prosperity through generations, and bring honor and success to their descendants. In this life, they will swiftly avoid royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their spirits will ascend to the Three Realms, attaining the six supernatural powers and realizing enlightenment. If reborn as humans, they will become kings, nobles, great clans, or eminent officials, enjoying heavenly blessings and boundless joy.\n\nThose who practice the Ten Evils will accumulate deep karmic transgressions, increasing obstacles and hardships. Their families will decline through generations, and their descendants will perish. In this life, they will not escape royal punishments, the perils of blades and warfare, plagues, floods, fires, and famine. After death, their bodies will fall into the Three Wretched Realms, their souls sink into the Nine Hells, enduring suffering in the long night where the fires of hell burn. If reborn among beasts, they will suffer dismemberment. If reborn as humans, they will be poor, lonely, and wretched, afflicted with disabilities, blindness, or deafness, lacking the full use of their six senses, and shunned by others.\n\nThe roots of all good and evil are recorded in great detail in the Buddhist sutras and Daoist scriptures. Here, they are listed and annotated to universally exhort the people of the world to practice the Ten Good Deeds together.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Jiang Yue and Lin Daochao.\n*Direct Pointers to the Dao of the Mysterious Origin: All Dharmas Return to the One, Scroll Seven—Concluded.*",
