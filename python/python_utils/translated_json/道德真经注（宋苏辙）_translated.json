  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (Volume 1) – *Dao That Can Be Spoken* (Chapter 1)**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (also known as *Laozi’s Explanation*).*\n**Author:** Su Xie of the Song Dynasty.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Tradition), *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n**Collation Reference:** *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed *Baoyan Tang* Secret Summer Edition (hereafter, *Baoyan Edition*).\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Commentary by Su Xie of Lishan**\n\n**Chapter 1: *Dao That Can Be Spoken***\n\nThe *Dao* that can be spoken of is not the eternal *Dao*.\nIt is not that it is not the *Dao*—\nYet what can be spoken of cannot be eternal.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.\n\nNow, *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (rites), and *zhi* (wisdom) are the *Dao* that can be spoken of.\nYet *ren* cannot be made into *yi*, nor can *li* be made into *zhi*.\nThus, what can be spoken of cannot be eternal in this way.\n\nOnly what cannot be spoken of—\nThen *ren* is *ren*, *yi* is *yi*, *li* is *li*, and *zhi* is *zhi*.\nThese are all transient, yet the *Dao* remains eternal and unchanging.\nThus, what cannot be spoken of can be eternal in this way.\n\nWhat can be named is not the eternal Name.\nThe *Dao* cannot be spoken of—how much less can it be named?\nAll names are of what can be spoken of.\nOnce names are established, then the distinctions of round and square, curved and straight cannot be eternal.\n\nThe Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nEternal Non-being, to observe its subtlety;\nEternal Being, to observe its limits.\n\nFrom the Nameless, form arises as Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven and Earth take their place, and names begin to be established.\nFrom the Named, it spreads into all things;\nAll things are nurtured, and names cannot be exhausted.\n\nThus, the Nameless is the essence of the *Dao*,\nAnd the Named is its manifestation.\n\nThe Sage embodies the *Dao* for the use of the world,\nEntering all things while remaining in Non-being,\nThus observing its subtlety.\nEmbodying the utmost Non-being while remaining in Being,\nThus observing its limits.\n\nIf one acts within its limits but does not know its subtlety,\nThen it is coarse and not divine.\nIf one lingers in its subtlety but does not know its manifestation,\nThen it is refined yet not pervasive.\n\nThese two are of the same origin but different names,\nBoth called *xuan* (mysterious).\nSpeaking in terms of form, there is Being and Non-being—\nTruly two.\n\nHow do we know that Non-being transforms into Being,\nAnd Being returns to Non-being?\nIt has never ceased to be one.\n\nThough their names differ, their source is one.\nKnowing the source as one, then it is *xuan*.\nThe further one goes without reaching an extreme,\nThe deeper its hue of *xuan*—\nThus Laozi often uses *xuan* to express the ultimate.\n\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—the gateway to all subtleties.\nSpeaking of *xuan* is to reach it,\nYet still the thought of *xuan* lingers.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—\nNo more can be added—\nThe origin of all subtleties.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: *All Under Heaven Know***\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then it is ugliness;\nAll know goodness as goodness—then it is not goodness.\n\nThus, Being and Non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low contrast each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nAll under Heaven speak of beauty and goodness in terms of form and name—\nWhat they call beautiful and good—\nHow can it truly be beautiful and good?\n\nThey do not know that Being and Non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sounds and sequence\nGenerate and counter each other—\nAll are not their true nature.\n\nJust as one may consider oneself long,\nYet one longer than oneself appears—then one is short.\nJust as one may consider oneself foremost,\nYet one who precedes appears—then one is last.\n\nIf one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,\nThen one is far from the truth.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in Non-action,\nTeaches through Non-speech.\nWhen acting, the intention is Non-action;\nWhen teaching, the intent is Non-speech.\n\nThus, transcending the measures of long and short,\nSeparating from the numbers of before and after,\nNeither beautiful nor ugly,\nNeither good nor not-good—\nThen how can all under Heaven know it?\n\nAll things arise without refusal,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd when accomplished, do not dwell upon it.\n\nAll things act for me, yet I refuse nothing.\nI give birth to them, yet never possess them,\nNever rely upon them.\nWhen success is achieved, I do not claim it.\n\nThis is the reward of Non-action and Non-speech—\nHow could it be ugly or not-good?\n\nOnly because one does not dwell upon it,\nDoes it not depart.\nThe Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without their burdens,\nDwells in wealth and honor without their encumbrances—\nThis is called *not dwelling*.\n\nIf I do not dwell upon it, how could others depart?\nThis is the ultimate dwelling.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 3: *Not Holding Exalted the Virtuous***\n\nNot holding the virtuous in high esteem, so the people do not contend;\nNot treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nIf one holds the virtuous in high esteem,\nThe people will be ashamed of not being like them and thus contend.\nIf one treasures difficult-to-obtain goods,\nThe people will suffer from not having them and thus steal.\nIf one displays what is desirable,\nThe people will be troubled by not obtaining it and thus become disordered.\n\nThough all under Heaven know these three as means of rest,\nYet if they seek to implement and abolish them, they are confused.\n\nThe Sage is not thus.\nHe has never failed to use the virtuous—\nOnly he does not hold them in high esteem.\nHe has never abandoned difficult-to-obtain goods—\nOnly he does not treasure them.\nHe has never removed what is desirable—\nOnly he does not display it.\n\nThus, the virtuous are employed, yet the people do not contend;\nDifficult-to-obtain goods and desirable matters are presented before them,\nYet theft and chaos do not arise—\nIs this not emptying the mind without harming the belly’s fullness,\nWeakening the will without harming the bones’ strength?\n\nNow if one promotes the virtuous and holds them in high esteem,\nTreasures goods and values them highly,\nDisplays what is desirable to the people,\nThen both the mind and the belly are filled.\n\nIf one implements and abolishes them,\nThen both will and bones are weakened.\nWhen the mind and belly are both filled,\nThe people will contend.\nWhen will and bones are both weakened,\nThere will be no means to stand.\n\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nIf one does not display these three things,\nThen the people will not know what to covet,\nAnd their desires will be tranquil—\nEven the wise will have no clever schemes to employ.\n\nTo act without action,\nThen nothing will remain untamed.\n\nTo follow the natural course of these three things\nWithout esteeming, valuing, or displaying them—\nThis is called *acting without action*.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unfathomable**\nThe Dao is unfathomable yet employed,\nSometimes appearing not full,\nDeep like the source of all things.\n\nThe Dao is unfathomable, reaching the void,\nYet with it, all things exist—\nThough heaven and earth are vast,\nMountains and rivers wide,\nIt pervades them all without form,\nThus appearing not full.\nDeep and boundless,\nI know it as the origin of all things,\nYet dare not speak of it directly,\nSo it is called *seemingly the origin of all things*.\n\nDull its sharpness,\nUntangle its complications,\nBlend its brilliance,\nAlign with its dust—\nCalm and tranquil, as if it might exist.\nAll people possess the Dao,\nYet the Sage preserves it whole.\n\nDull its sharpness, lest it stray into recklessness.\nUntangle its complications, lest it clash with things.\nNot straying into recklessness, not clashing with things,\nExternal harm removed, and brightness arises—\nThen harmonize it, lest it differ from things.\nBrightness is purity, dust is obscurity—\nThough dust may align, fear it would abandon all things.\nThus, only then is it preserved,\nCalm and ever-present—\nThough present, none recognize it,\nHence *seemingly it might exist*.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Sovereign.\nThough the Dao is ever-present,\nNone can name it—\nYet it cannot be said to be nonexistent,\nSo it is asked: *Is this not what precedes the Sovereign?*\nIf it precedes the Sovereign and yet precedes the Sovereign,\nThen none can precede it.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nThey treat all things as sacrificial dogs;\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nThey treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no favoritism,\nYet allow all things to follow their nature—\nThus things spontaneously live and die.\nDeath is not their cruelty,\nLife is not their benevolence.\n\nLike binding straw to make a dog,\nSet before sacrifices,\nAdorned with utmost reverence—\nYet not out of love,\nBut merely the proper time.\nWhen the rites are done, it is discarded,\nTrampled by passersby—\nYet not out of hatred,\nBut merely the proper time.\n\nSo too the Sage treats the people:\nOnly by not harming them\nDo they preserve their nature.\nLife and death, gain and loss—\nI have no part in them.\nThough I have never been benevolent,\nBenevolence is vast.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nWhat is it but the bellows and the bellows-key?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nThe bellows and the bellows-key—\nWhen they move, the breath they send forth\nSweeps all before it.\nThe unknowing take it for the pinnacle of craft,\nYet what do the bellows and the bellows-key truly do?\nThey are empty yet unyielding,\nThus when they move, they ever produce.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nTheir way of giving life and death to all things,\nCarving and shaping all forms—\nIs no different.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the central way.\nSeeing it move yet produce,\nThe unknowing fail to grasp its response from emptiness,\nThus I tell them: *Much speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the central way, which knows no exhaustion.*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\nThe Valley is supremely empty yet still has form,\nThe Valley Spirit is empty yet formless.\nEmpty yet formless,\nHow could there be birth, let alone death?\nIt is called the Valley Spirit,\nSpeaking of its virtue.\nIt is called the Mysterious Feminine,\nSpeaking of its function.\n\nThe Feminine gives birth to all things,\nYet is called Mysterious—\nFor though it gives birth, its method is unseen.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine\nIs called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine,\nFor all things emerge from it.\nThe Root of Heaven and Earth,\nFor heaven and earth emerge from it.\n\nEnduring yet subtle,\nUsed without exhaustion.\nEnduring—unceasing yet unbroken.\nSubtle—present yet unseen.\nIf one can be thus,\nEven if used all day, there is no labor.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure Long**\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nThough vast, they do not depart from form and number,\nThus their endurance has measure.\nYet Laozi speaks of endurance reaching heaven and earth,\nMerely from what people see.\n\nIf endurance reaches its utmost,\nThen it is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nHeaven and Earth endure long\nBecause they do not generate themselves,\nThus they endure.\nTherefore the Sage places himself last,\nYet is first;\nSets himself outside,\nYet is preserved.\nIs it not because he has no self-interest?\nThus he fulfills his self-interest.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to things yet do not generate themselves,\nStanding outside all things,\nThus they endure.\nThe Sage places himself last yet serves others,\nSets himself outside yet benefits others,\nStanding beyond all people,\nThus he is first and preserved.\n\nIf heaven and earth competed with things for life,\nAnd the Sage contended with people for gain,\nThen heaven and earth would be but one thing,\nThe Sage but one person—\nHow could they surpass others?\n\nThough so, their lack of self-interest\nIs not to seek fulfillment of self-interest,\nYet self-interest fulfills the Dao—\nThus it is so.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people dislike it,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nOne yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\nTo follow it is good,\nTo complete it is nature.\n\n「又曰：天以一生水。\nThe Dao generates water with its singular essence—\nFor the Dao’s movement is the supreme good,\nJust as *qi* moves to produce water,\nThus it is said: \"The supreme good is like water.\"\n\n二者皆自无而始成形，故其理同。\nBoth arise from the formless yet manifest shape,\nThus their principles are the same.\n\n道无所不在，无所不利，而水亦然。\nThe Dao is everywhere, benefiting all,\nAnd so too is water.\n\n然而既已丽於形，则於道有问矣，故曰几於道。\nYet once it adheres to form,\nIt falls short of the Dao—\nThus it is said: \"It nearly attains the Dao.\"\n\n然而可名之善，未有若此者也，故曰上善。\nYet as a named virtue,\nNone surpass this—\nThus it is called the \"supreme good.\"\n\n居善地，心善渊，与善仁，一黄善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。\nDwelling in virtue’s humble ground,\nMind in virtue’s profound depths,\nGiving in virtue’s boundless kindness,\nUnifying in virtue’s trustworthy truth,\nGovernance in virtue’s harmonious order,\nAction in virtue’s transformative capacity,\nMovement in virtue’s timely flow.\n\n避高趋下，未尝有所逆，善地也。\nAvoiding heights, seeking lows,\nNever opposing—this is virtue’s humility.\n\n空虚静默，深不可测，善渊也。\nEmpty yet vast, silent yet profound,\nUnfathomable—this is virtue’s depth.\n\n利泽万物，施而不求报，善仁也。\nBenefiting all things, bestowing without seeking return—\nThis is virtue’s kindness.\n\n圆必旋，方必折，塞必止，次爻流，善信也。\nRounded, it must turn;\nSquare, it must bend;\nBlocked, it must halt;\nFollowing the path of *qi*—this is virtue’s trustworthiness.\n\n洗涤群秽，平准高下，善治也。\nCleansing all impurities,\nBalancing heights and lows—this is virtue’s harmonizing governance.\n\n遇物赋形，而不留於一，善能也。\nMeeting things, it shapes them,\nYet never clings to one form—this is virtue’s transformative ability.\n\n冬凝春伴，涸溢不失节，善时也。\nIn winter, it congeals;\nIn spring, it thaws;\nIn drought, it recedes;\nIn flood, it swells—\nNever failing its due measure—this is virtue’s timely nature.\n\n夫惟不争，故无尤。\nOnly through non-contention\nIs there no blame.\n\n有善而不免於人非者，以其争也。\nA virtue that does not escape human censure\nIs born of contention.\n\n水惟不争，故兼七善而无尤。\nWater, through non-contention,\nEmbraces the seven virtues without blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Fulfilling (持而盈之)**\nHolding yet fulfilling,\nBetter than forcing completion;\nPlucking yet sharpening,\nBetter than enduring loss.\n\nKnowing that fullness must overflow,\nYet striving to hold it firm,\nBetter to let it not be full—\nThen stability is assured.\n\nKnowing that sharpness must break,\nYet plucking to hasten it,\nBetter to let it not be sharp—\nThen reliance is not bound to certainty.\n\nIf the Sage possesses yet does not cling,\nHow could there be excess?\nFollowing nature, then acting,\nHow could there be haste?\n\nWithout excess, there is no need to hold,\nWithout haste, there is no need to pluck.\n\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nYet none can keep them safe;\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nYet they invite their own ruin.\n\nWhen merit is complete,\nName is achieved,\nBody withdraws—\nThis is the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nAt high noon, the sun must shift,\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes—\nThe cycles of the four seasons,\nMerit complete, departs.\n\nHeaven and earth do so,\nHow much more so humanity?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Spirit and Substance (载营魄)**\nNurturing spirit and substance,\nEmbracing unity—can separation be avoided?\n\nSubstance differs from spirit,\nFor substance is matter, spirit is essence.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*Qi* congeals to form matter,\nSpirit wanders to bring transformation—\nThus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.\n\nSubstance, as matter, is mixed yet fixed;\nSpirit, as essence, is singular yet ever-changing.\nTo speak of nurturing spirit and substance,\nIt is to speak of their stillness.\n\nThe Dao is everywhere,\nIn humanity, it is nature—\nAnd nature’s subtlety is spirit.\n\nWhen pure and unmixed, it is called unity;\nWhen gathered yet not dispersed, it is called substance—\nBoth return to the Dao,\nEach following its own truth.\n\nThe Sage’s nature is settled,\nSpirit is congealed,\nNot swayed by things.\nThough substance is his dwelling,\nSpirit moves as it wills,\nAnd substance follows without fail—\nThus spirit ever nurtures substance.\n\nThe common folk let things enslave their nature,\nSpirit is dimmed, ungoverned,\nAnd substance commands.\nEyes and ears are dulled by sounds and colors,\nNose and mouth are exhausted by scents and flavors—\nSubstance moves as it desires,\nAnd spirit follows—\nThus substance ever nurtures spirit.\n\nHence the teaching of nurturing spirit and substance,\nSo the two never part—\nThis is the Sage’s essential method for cultivating the self.\n\nAs for the ancient *True Persons*,\nDeep-rooted, firm-founded,\nLong-lived, ever-visioned—\nTheir Dao also comes from this.\n\nFocusing *qi* to achieve softness,\nCan one be like an infant?\n\nWhen spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered—\nThe strong delight in fighting,\nThe weak delight in fear,\nUnaware of themselves.\n\nWhen spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly—\nJoy and anger follow their kind—\nThis is called focusing *qi*,\nThe utmost of spirit’s emptiness,\nThe beginning of *qi*’s substance.\n\nAt its emptiest, it is softness;\nAt its most substantial, it is rigidity—\nPure nature, devoid of *qi*,\nThis is called achieving softness.\n\nThe infant knows not good or evil,\nThus its nature is whole.\n\nWhole nature, with *qi* refined,\nRefined *qi*, with body soft—\nFocusing *qi* to achieve softness,\nCan one reach the infant’s utmost?\n\nCleansing and transcending,\nCan one be without blemish?\n\nThe Sage externally is not enslaved by substance,\nInternally is not ruled by *qi*—\nThus all dust and defilement are cleansed.\n\nThen its spirit is bright and clear,\nTranscending all things,\nKnowing they all arise from nature,\nEqually observing purity and impurity,\nWithout blemish or flaw.\n\nLoving the people, governing the state,\nCan one act without doing?\n\nHaving cultivated the self,\nThen extending to others.\nEven in loving the people, governing the state,\nOne meets them with a heartless heart.\n\nIf one has a heart,\nThen loving the people brings harm,\nAnd governing the state brings disorder.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Gate of Heaven Opens and Closes (天门开阖)**\nThe gate of heaven opens and shuts—\nCan one be like the female?\n\nThe gate of heaven refers to\nThe source of governance, chaos, ruin, and flourishing.\n\nHaving taken the body as the world’s burden,\nWhen opening and shutting, gathering and dispersing,\nThe common folk prize gain yet fear loss,\nThus they act in advance to court fortune.\n\nThe Sage follows nature and knows the Mandate of Heaven,\nThus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nTo precede Heaven yet not defy it,\nIs not to precede Heaven;\nTo follow Heaven yet still conform to its time,\nIs not to follow Heaven.\n\nIt speaks of always meeting Heaven’s Mandate,\nWhether before or after—\nThis is all.\n\nOtherwise, the early must hasten,\nThe late must falter,\nBoth lose the way.\n\nThus to say \"can one be like the female\"\nIs to say \"one must not lose the time.\"\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Clarity and Fourfold Reach (明白四达)**\nClarity and fourfold reach—\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nInternally cultivating the self,\nExternally governing the state,\nEven in facing change,\nNever lacking the Dao—\nHow could this not be clarity and fourfold reach?\n\nClarity and fourfold reach are the heart,\nThe heart knows nothing—\nYet it never has a heart that knows.\n\nThe heart is singular—\nIf again there is one that knows,\nThen it is two.\n\n「From unity to duality,\nThis is where obscurity arises,\nAnd where ignorance begins.\n\nNow, take the mirror and objects:\nWhen things come, it responds—\nThat is all.\nYet how could it know what it responds to?\n\nThe essence is without form,\nYet the mind imposes upon it—\nThis is the source of delusion.\n\nTo nurture life without possessing it,\nTo act without relying on it,\nTo grow without controlling it—\nThis is called *Xuan* Virtue.\n\nIts Dao suffices to nurture all things,\nYet it neither possesses nor relies nor controls—\nThough great in virtue,\nThings know it not,\nHence it is called *Xuan* Virtue.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet it is their emptiness that gives use to the wheel.\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nYet it is their emptiness that gives use to the vessels.\nWalls and windows are carved for rooms,\nYet it is their emptiness that gives use to the rooms.\nThus, what is present brings advantage,\nBut what is absent brings use.\n\nExhaust knowledge and things to make vessels,\nYet the vessel’s use lies always in their emptiness.\nWithout the present, there is no absence to fulfill its use#1,\nWithout the absence, there is only the present to offer its advantage#2.\nThus, the Sage observes its mystery through constancy of absence,\nAnd observes its clarity through constancy of presence.\n\nTo know the two as one, indivisible—\nThis is the ultimate.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**»\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors**\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deaf the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate.\nTo see colors, hear tones, and taste flavors,\nTheir source all arises from *nature* (性),\nWhen it has *nature* yet lacks *things* (物),\nThis is the utmost.\n\nWhen the eyes feast on the five colors,\nThe ears feast on the five tones,\nThe mouth feasts on the five flavors,\nThey are robbed by what they feast upon and forget their source,\nThen though they see, they are truly blind;\nThough they hear, they are truly deaf;\nThough they taste, they are truly dulled.\n\nChasing through fields and hunts makes the heart go mad,\nRare treasures make one’s conduct falter.\nThus the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nAnd so discards that to take this.\n\nThe Sage sees colors, hears tones, and tastes flavors,\nAll as others do.\nAs for chasing through fields and hunts,\nHe has never failed to do them,\nYet rare treasures he has never failed to reject.\nYet people all take this as illness,\nWhile the Sage alone takes it as blessing—why?\nThe Sage acts for the belly, while the common folk act for the eyes;\nThe eyes are blamed yet cannot accept,\nThe belly accepts yet is never blamed—this is why.\n\nThat which comes from without is external,\nThis which is *nature* congealing within is internal.\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\nHonor and humiliation are like a startling fright,\nTreating great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nThe ancient *Dao* masters (达人),\nTreated honor as they did humiliation—startling,\nKnew that honor as humiliation comes first.\nThey valued their own body as they did great calamity,\nKnew that their own body as the root of calamity.\nThus they abandoned honor so humiliation did not reach them,\nAnd lost their own body so calamity did not come.\n\nWhat is meant by “honor and humiliation”?\nHumiliation is the lower,\nGaining it is like a startling fright,\nLosing it is like a startling fright—\nThis is what is meant by “honor and humiliation as startling fright.”\n\nSo-called honor and humiliation are not two separate things,\nHumiliation arises from honor yet the world does not know,\nThose who take honor as the higher and humiliation as the lower—all are such.\nIf one knows humiliation arises from honor,\nThen honor is truly the lower.\n\nThus the ancient *Dao* masters,\nGained honor as though it were a startling fright,\nLost honor as though it were a startling fright,\nNever settled in honor while fearing humiliation.\n\nSo-called “startling fright” is not true fright,\nIt is only *as if* startling—this is all.\n\nWhat is meant by “treating great calamity as one’s own body”?\nIt is because of my having a body that I have great calamity,\nAnd when I lack a body, what great calamity have I?\n“Treating” means “difficult to bear.”\nThe root of great calamity is having a body,\nYet the scholars of the world find it difficult to bear great calamity,\nNot difficult to bear their own bodies.\nThus the Sage, seeing their difficulty in bearing calamity,\nTeaches them that it is difficult to bear having a body,\nKnowing that having a body is the difficulty,\nThen great calamity departs.\n\n*Nature* (性) in relation to man,\nLife cannot add to it, death cannot diminish it;\nIts vastness can fill heaven and earth,\nIts subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—\nNo thing can exhaust it.\n\nYet the world always exhausts and loses its original *nature*,\nAnd only the body is seen,\nThe love for the body is deep,\nThen only can things exhaust it.\n\nThe changes of life and death, sickness and disease attack from within,\nThe alternations of honor and humiliation, gain and loss assail from without—\nNot a single thing that is not calamity.\n\nOnly the *Dao* masters know that *nature* is unbroken,\nAnd the body is not real;\nSuddenly forgetting the body,\nAll exhaustion of the world departs,\nThen one can traverse the world without burden.\n\nThus to treat the body as the world,\nAs though one could entrust the world to it;\nTo love the body as the world,\nAs though one could commit the world to it.\n\nWhy men chase after power and wealth,\nDrown in riches and honor,\nAnd commit offenses without repentance—\nAll are but to thicken their own bodies.\nNow if one bestows the world upon them,\nAnd weighs it heavily with the body’s burden,\nThen their forgetting of the body is complete.\nIn this way, if one gives them the world,\nThough the world be vast,\nThey cannot take it as calamity.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nThat which is seen yet unseen is called *equanimity* (夷),\nThat which is heard yet unheard is called *rare* (希),\nThat which is grasped yet unobtainable is called *subtle* (微).\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nThus they return and blend into one.\n\nWhat is seen yet seen—colors,\nThat which allows colors to be seen—the unseen.\nWhat is heard yet heard—sounds,\nThat which allows sounds to be heard—the unheard.\nWhat is grasped yet obtained—tactile things,\nThat which allows tactile things to be obtained—the unobtainable.\nThese three,\nThough wise men cannot question them,\nMust blend and return to one,\nThen only can it be so.\n\nSo-called “one”—*nature* (性).\nThe three—*nature*’s functions.\nMan begins with *nature* alone,\nAnd when it interacts with *things*,\nThen it splits and disperses,\nBecomes seeing, hearing, and touching,\nDaily used yet unaware of returning to its source—\nIf not blending and returning to one,\nThen it grows ever more distant.\n\nIf one extends this reasoning further,\nThen the Buddhist teaching of the six sense-gates is the same.\nThe *Lengyan Sutra* (首楞严) says:\n“Reverse the flow, return to unity,\nThe six functions do not operate.”\nThis is what is meant.\n\nAbove it does not shine,\nBelow it does not dim.\nThings with form,\nAll depend on *yin* and *yang*,\nThus above they shine, below they dim,\nAnd cannot escape.\n\nThe *Dao* though above does not shine,\nThough below does not dim,\nCannot be traced by form or number.\nTaut and unbroken, it cannot be named,\nThus it returns to *non-things* (无物).\nTaut and unbroken—\nMoving yet never ceasing.\n\nMen see its moving yet never ceasing,\nThen they think there are things,\nYet do not know it finally returns to *non-being* (无).\nThis is called the *form* of *formlessness*,\nThe *image* of *imagelessness*—\nThis is called *dimly vague* (惚恍).\n*Form*—its manifestation,\n*Image*—its subtlety.\nThe *form* of *formlessness*,\nThe *image* of *imagelessness*—\nAll are not *non-being*.\nHaving *being* and *non-being* cannot be named,\nThus it is called *dimly vague*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head,\nFollow it and you see no tail.\nThe *Dao* is nowhere not present,\nThus it has no head or tail that can be seen.\n\nTo grasp ancient *Dao* and apply it to present *things*,\nTo know the beginning of antiquity—\nThis is called *Dao*’s order (道纪).\nAntiquity—\nThe source from which all *things* arise.\n\nThe present is the *being* of *things*,\nThen the past is the *non-being* of *things*.\nTo grasp their source of origin,\nThen advance and retreat, swift or slow, lies within oneself.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Master of Conduct**\n\nThe ancient master of conduct was subtle, profound, and penetrating—\nDeep beyond recognition.\nCoarse understanding exhausted, the subtle remains;\nThe subtle exhausted, the wondrous appears;\nThe wondrous exhausted, the *Dao* emerges—\nAnd the *Dao* is all-pervasive, yet deep beyond recognition.\n\nOnly because it is beyond recognition,\nDo we force it into semblance:\n**Cautious as winter crossing a river.**\nTo be cautious before acting is called *cautious*—\nWhat one intends to do, like being pressed before responding,\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter, moving with reluctance,\nAs if there were no alternative.\n\n**Hesitant as fearing neighbors,**\nDoubtful and thus not acting is called *hesitant*—\nWhat one does not desire, delayed and resisted,\nHesitant as one fearing neighbors’ judgment.\n\n**Dignified as if in reverence,**\nRespectful in all things, never negligent.\n\n**Dissolved as ice about to melt,**\nKnowing all *things* arise from illusion,\nNever clinging to anything.\n\n**Unadorned as if crude,**\nArtifice exhausted, returning to nature.\n\n**Vast as a valley,**\nEmpty yet receptive to all.\n\n**Turbulent as mud.**\nDulling its brilliance,\nBlending with dust,\nNot differing from *things*.\n\nWho can settle mud by stillness and gradually clarify?\nWho can, by enduring stillness, gradually bring forth movement?\n\nCommon scholars let *things* overwhelm their nature,\nThus they remain muddied and never clarify.\nWithered scholars, through rigid stillness, extinguish their nature,\nThus they remain stagnant and never revive.\n\nNow knowing mud disrupts nature,\nWe still it—stillness gradually clarifies it.\nKnowing extinction of nature is not the *Dao*,\nWe move it—movement gradually revives it.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Motionless yet not inactive,\nResponding and thus harmonizing with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nWhat is called *movement* here is just so.\n\nThose who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness.\nFullness arises from excess,\nMuddied and unable to clarify,\nStagnant and unable to revive—\nThis is why one must not be full.\n\nOnly because one is not full,\nCan one be worn without renewal.\nAll *things* inevitably wear out.\nOnly because one is not full,\nDoes wear depart on its own without renewal.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Ultimate Void**\n\nAttain the ultimate void,\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\nIf the void is not ultimate,\nSome *being* remains.\nIf stillness is not sincere,\nSome movement remains.\n\nThough hills and mountains may recede,\nFine dust still lingers—\nThis is not yet ultimate or sincere.\n\nTo attain the void while preserving the void,\nIs still not free of *being*;\nTo guard stillness while preserving stillness,\nIs still entangled in movement—\nHow much more so for others?\n\nWithout ultimacy or sincerity,\nYet demanding the use of void and stillness—\nThis is difficult.\n\nAll *things* arise together,\nI observe their return.\nWith ultimate void and sincere stillness,\nI observe the transformations of *things*,\nOnly then am I not disturbed by change.\n\nKnowing all actions inevitably return,\nIf I were now to act with all *things*,\nI would be unfit to know them.\n\n*Things* teem and return to their roots.\nAll *things* arise from nature,\nAll return to nature—\nLike flowers and leaves growing from roots and returning to roots,\nLike waves arising from water and returning to water.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness.\nIf one cannot return to nature on their own,\nEven halting movement and ceasing thought to seek stillness—\nThis is not stillness.\n\nOnly returning to the root is true stillness.\nStillness is called *restoring the vital command*.\nThe *command*—the subtlest aspect of nature.\nNature can still be spoken of,\nBut the *command* cannot be spoken of.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Exhaust reason, fulfill nature, and reach the *command*.\"*\n\nThe sage’s study of the *Dao*\nMust begin with exhausting reason,\nProceed with fulfilling nature,\nAnd end with restoring the *command*.\n\nRitual and music—\nThe sage’s means of engaging with *things*—\nYet their application must have its basis.\nNot knowing the basis,\nYet following their names—\nThis is the common scholar.\n\nKnowing the basis and then acting—\nThis is the noble.\n\nThis is called *exhausting reason*.\nThough one exhausts the mind to exhaust reason and thus attain it,\nWithout seeking, it cannot be obtained.\n\n*Things* daily construct themselves before one,\nOne must seek and then respond—\nThus the effort is laborious,\nYet the achievement is slight.\n\nThe sage is not obscured by externals,\nHis nature is serene—\nWithout striving, yet centered;\nWithout thought, yet attaining;\nWhen *things* arrive, he responds—\nThis is called *fulfilling nature*.\n\nYet this is still *my* nature,\nStill entangled in the distinction of self and other,\nAlmost deluded.\n\nThe ruler’s *command* is *command*,\nHeaven’s *command* is *command*—\nEngaging with *things* through nature,\nYet unaware of its source in me—\nThus it is entrusted to the *command*.\n\nThis is called *restoring the command*.\nRestoring the *command* is constancy.\nWhen it acts,\nEven Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—\nNothing does not transform and decay.\n\nOnly by returning to nature\nDoes constancy abide serene.\n\nKnowing constancy is enlightenment.\nIf one does not take returning to nature as enlightenment,\nThen all is the common scholar’s cleverness—\nThough they claim enlightenment,\nIt is not true enlightenment.\n\nIgnorant of constancy, they act recklessly—disaster.\nIgnorant of returning to nature,\nThey cling to *things* and move—\nNo action is without disaster.\nThough they may succeed in the moment,\nThey lose in the long run.\n\nKnowing constancy, one is tolerant.\nWhen lost in illusion,\nThey insist on their own right,\nOthers are all enemies—\nHow can they tolerate them?\nIf one knows all is illusion,\nEven enemies—\nOne pities and spares them—\nHow can they not tolerate all?\n\nTolerance is impartiality.\nWithout tolerance, no impartiality—\nWho remains private?\n\nImpartiality is sovereignty.\nWithout impartiality, no sovereignty—\nWho would the world follow?\n\nSovereignty is Heaven.\nThough Heaven has form,\nThe *Dao* is ultimate—\nYet beyond the *Dao*, nothing further can be attained.\n\nThe *Dao* is enduring.\nThough one’s life ends,\nIt is never perished.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: The Supreme Sage**\n\nThe Supreme Sage—\nThe common folk know of his existence.\nHe governs the world through *Dao* and *virtue*,\nYet never forces his rule upon them.\nThe people do not know how it is done,\nSo they merely acknowledge his existence.\n\nThe next kind of ruler—\nLoved and praised by the people.\nHe governs the world with *ren* and *yi*,\nHis *virtue* is cherished,\nHis deeds are visible,\nSo the people naturally love and praise him.\nThough his name is fair,\nThis is where favoritism begins.\n\nThe next kind—\nFeared and reviled.\nHe governs with laws and order,\nThe people are not without fear,\nYet where his strength does not reach,\nThey scorn him.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThere is distrust.\nIf I truly trust myself,\nThen governing the world through *Dao* is enough.\nOnly when I do not trust myself,\nAnd add *ren* and *yi*,\nThen pile on laws and punishments—\nThen the people begin to distrust me.\n\nEven more, he values words.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people say, *\"It was natural.\"*\nThe Sage trusts himself abundantly,\nYet in his speech,\nHe still holds words in high regard,\nNever speaking lightly—\nAnd the people already trust him.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,\nThe people daily shift toward goodness and away from guilt,\nYet they do not know it themselves.\n\n---\n*The Dao De Jing, Volume One of the True Classic of Virtue and the Way, Annotated by Su She of Meishan*\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao in Decay**\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned,\n*Ren* and *yi* arise.\nWhen the Great Dao flourishes,\n*Ren* and *yi* are practiced within it,\nYet the people remain unaware.\n\nOnce the Dao is abandoned,\nThen *ren* and *yi* become manifest.\n\nWisdom emerges,\nAnd great deceit follows.\nThe world does not know\nThat sufficiency alone suffices for all things,\nYet it layers wisdom upon them—\nAnd thus the people begin to repay with deceit.\n\nWhen the six bonds are fractured,\nFilial piety and kindness arise.\nWhen the state is in chaos,\nLoyal ministers appear.\n\nWhen the six bonds are harmonious,\nWho is not filial and kind?\nWhen the state is well-ordered,\nWho is not a loyal minister?\n\nEmperor Yao was not unfilial,\nYet only Shun was praised—\nFor there was no blind Zhī.\nYī Yín and the Duke of Zhou were not disloyal,\nYet only Lóng Fēng and Bǐ Gān were honored—\nFor there was no Jié or Zhòu.\n\nFish stranded in a drying marsh\nKiss to moisten one another,\nRub to keep each other damp—\nBetter to forget each other in the great rivers and lakes.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Discarding the Sage and Abandoning Wisdom**\n\nDiscard the Sage,\nAbandon wisdom,\nAnd the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning and Having No Worry**\n\nNot possessing the Sage’s wisdom is insufficient to know the Dao,\nAnd if the Sage’s wisdom were to rule the world,\nWho would not govern all things with the Dao?\n\nYet the people of the world are insufficient to know the root of the Sage’s wisdom,\nBut they see only its branches,\nAnd take it for cleverness in overcoming things.\nThus they race along its superficial currents,\nAnd the people begin to suffer its harm beyond measure.\n\nTherefore, discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nAnd the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nDiscard virtue and abandon righteousness,\nAnd the people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThere has never been one who practiced virtue and abandoned their parents,\nNor one who upheld righteousness and delayed serving their lord—\nVirtue and righteousness are what make filial piety and kindness possible.\n\nYet when they decline,\nThey steal the names of virtue and righteousness to gain advantage in the world,\nAnd thus sons defy their fathers,\nAnd fathers cruelly mistreat their sons—\nThis is the result of the traces of virtue and righteousness.\n\nTherefore, discard virtue and abandon righteousness,\nAnd the people return to filial piety and kindness.\n\nDiscard cleverness and abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\nCleverness is what facilitates affairs,\nProfit is what aids things—\nThese two are not for thievery; if thieves and robbers cannot succeed, they will not act.\n\nTherefore, discard cleverness and abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\n\nThese three things are insufficient for cultivation,\nSo they must be assigned their proper place.\nSeeing simplicity and embracing purity,\nFew desires and little self-interest.\n\nThe world values these three things,\nYet it believes the world’s unrest comes from their insufficiency.\nThus some attribute them to the Sage’s wisdom,\nSome to virtue and righteousness,\nSome to cleverness and profit—\nAll seeking to govern with them.\n\nYet the world grows ever more unstable—\nWhy not return to their roots?\n\nSee simplicity, embrace purity,\nFew desires and little self-interest,\nAnd the people will each return to their true nature.\nEven with these three things, there will be no need for them.\n\nThus it is said:\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people become upright;\nI meddle in nothing, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\nThis is the greatness of the Sage’s wisdom,\nThe utmost of virtue and righteousness,\nThe extreme of cleverness and profit.\n\nYet Confucius governed the world with virtue, righteousness, ritual, and music,\nWhile Laozi discarded and abandoned them—\nSome may say they differed.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nThat which is above form is called the Dao,\nThat which is below form is called instrumentality.\nConfucius’ foresight for posterity was profound,\nSo he showed people instrumentality while concealing the Dao,\nCausing the mediocre and below to cling to instrumentality,\nSo they would not be dazzled by the Dao,\nAnd thus not lose their way as gentlemen,\nWhile those above the mediocre would naturally ascend to it.\n\nLaozi was not so.\nHe was intent on clarifying the Dao and urgently sought to open people’s minds,\nSo he showed people the Dao while slighting instrumentality,\nBelieving that if scholars only knew instrumentality,\nThe Dao would remain hidden.\nThus he discarded virtue and righteousness,\nAbandoned ritual and music,\nTo clarify the Dao.\n\nThe Dao cannot be spoken—\nAll speech is but its semblance.\nThe enlightened discern the true through its semblance,\nWhile the ignorant cling to the semblance and fall into deception.\n\nThus in later ages, those who seized Laozi’s words to disrupt the world existed,\nYet those who followed Confucius committed no great errors.\nThose who reached the Dao through Laozi’s words were many,\nWhile those who sought it in Confucius often struggled to find an entrance.\n\nThese two sages were both constrained—\nTo preserve one, they must neglect the other.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning and Having No Worry**\n\nDiscard learning and have no worry.\n\nTo study is to daily increase,\nTo follow the Dao is to daily diminish.\nNot knowing the true nature of life and destiny,\nYet seeking benefit through study,\nAccumulating what one has not heard,\nPiling it endlessly without unifying it,\nThen the round harms the square,\nThe straight harms the curved—\nThe mind becomes chaotic,\nAnd worry knows no end.\n\nAlas, that scholars should reach this point!\nThus it is said: Discard learning and have no worry.\n\nYet the Sage never ceased learning,\nBut took the Dao as primary.\nNot learning does not mean little learning,\nMuch learning does not mean confusion—\nSerene and without worry,\nWhy speak of discarding learning?\n\nYes and no—\nHow far apart are they?\nGood and evil—\nHow different are they?\n\nScholars drown in what they have heard,\nUnable to unify it,\nSo they take \"yes\" as respectful\nAnd \"no\" as arrogance—\nAlready beyond comparison,\nMuch less the opposite extremes of good and evil!\n\nThe Sage knows all things arise from nature,\nYet all are formed by delusion—\nLike drawing horses and oxen,\nOr carving tigers and leopards,\nNone are their true forms.\nPitifully, there is no distinction of right and wrong, same and different—\nWho knows how far apart they truly are?\n\nIf one knows this,\nThen all things coexist without harm,\nThe Dao proceeds without contradiction—\nNothing strange in that.\n\nWhat people fear,\nCannot but be feared.\nThe Sage equalizes self and other,\nUnifies same and different,\nHis heart leaves nothing behind—\nYet would he thereby neglect the world’s laws,\nTransgress boundaries, and disrupt order without care?\n\nWhat people fear,\nI too fear.\nWhat people do,\nI too do.\n\nEven amid the relations of lord and subject, parent and child,\nWithin the domains of ritual, music, punishment, and governance,\nThe world would not know the difference.\nIt is only his heart that does not cling to things.\n\nBoundless—\nIts endlessness cannot be measured.\n\nAll people follow what they know,\nThus rigidly confined within their narrow paths.\nThe Sage traverses both existence and nonexistence,\nAnd nothing is beyond his reach—\nBoundless—\nIts end cannot be measured.\n\nThe crowd rejoices,\nAs if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nAs if ascending the terrace in spring—\nI alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest,\nLike an infant not yet weaned.\n\nAll people drown in their desires—\nTheir beauty is like feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nTheir joy is like ascending the terrace in spring—\nNoisily following, yet unaware of their error.\n\nOnly the Sage delves deeply into their delusion,\nEncounters it with equanimity, unmoved,\nLike an infant not yet weaned.\n\nWandering—\nAs if having nowhere to return.\n\nRiding the principles of all things without self-interest,\nThus as if having nowhere to return.\n\nThe crowd all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned.\n\nThe crowd clings to their own knowledge,\nEach believing themselves to have excess.\n\nThe Sage encompasses all things yet claims none,\nTranscendent—like one abandoned.\n\nMy heart of a foolish man is pure,\nPure—yet not truly foolish.\n\nThe vulgar shine with clarity,\nWhile I alone seem dim.\n\nThe vulgar scrutinize keenly,\nWhile I alone am muddled and obscure.\n\nThe worldly deem discrimination as wisdom,\nYet the Sage knows the futility of distinguishing delusions—\nThus outwardly he seems dim,\nInwardly he seems muddled.\n\nSudden yet indistinct,\nQuiet yet without end.\n\nSudden and indistinct,\nYet within them are forms.\n\nIndistinct and sudden,\nYet within them are things.\n\nThe Dao is neither being nor non-being,\nThus it is spoken of as indistinct and sudden.\n\nYet when it manifests as forms,\nAnd takes root as things,\nNone escape its indistinct and sudden nature.\n\nVague and dark,\nWithin it lies essence.\n\nIn the realm of indeterminate being and non-being,\nIndistinct and sudden, yet unseen.\n\nWhen being and non-being intersect,\nThen its vague and dark depths are revealed—\nThough formless, essence abides within.\n\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it lies sincerity.\n\nWhen things reach full form,\nTruth and falsity are mingled—\nFrom one to two, then three,\nChaotic and intertwined, beyond verification.\n\nYet in its essence,\nIt does not deceive me.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name remains unchanged—\nTo observe all transformations.\n\nThough ancient and modern differ,\nThe Dao itself does not vanish,\nThus it is called \"unchanging.\"\n\nOnly because it never vanishes,\nIt can witness all things' transformations.\n\n*\"Transformation\"*—beauty—\nThough all things are beautiful,\nThey cannot escape change.\n\nHow do I know this of all transformations?\nBy this.\n\nThe Sage knows all things' nature\nBecause he embodies the Dao and does not depart from it.\n\n**Flexibility Preserves Completeness (Chapter 22)**\nFlexible, yet complete—\nThe Sage acts only in accordance with principle,\nWhere principle lies, sometimes straight, sometimes curved,\nYet its essence is unity.\n\nIn unity with all things, no contradiction—\nNo contradiction, hence completeness.\n\nCrooked yet straight—\nStraightness without principle is not true straightness.\nFollowing principle, though crooked, is the world’s truest straightness.\n\nHollow yet full—\nWhere all things converge is low.\nThough one may not wish to be full, it cannot be avoided.\n\nWorn yet renewed—\nClarity and scrutiny are not the Dao.\nMuddled and obscure, yet daily renewed—\nThis is where renewal originates.\n\nLittle yet sufficient—\nThe Dao is singular.\nTo grasp the singular is to possess all.\nTo grasp much without unity is confusion.\n\nThus the Sage holds unity as the model for all under heaven.\nTo hold unity is to restore one’s nature.\n\nFor flexible yet complete,\nCrooked yet straight,\nHollow yet full,\nWorn yet renewed,\nLittle yet sufficient—\nAll are consequences of holding unity,\nThus it concludes with \"holding unity.\"\n\nNot self-revealing, hence clarity—\nThe eye does not see itself, thus it can see all things.\nThe mirror does not reflect itself, thus it can reflect all things.\nIf the eye saw itself or the mirror reflected itself,\nThey would have no time to see or reflect others.\nThus, not self-revealing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—\nAll are aspects of not striving,\nThus it concludes with \"not striving.\"\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"flexible yet complete\"—\nWas this mere empty talk?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\nThe world deems straightness as right,\nCrookedness as wrong.\nYet if one follows principle in the world,\nThere will be no avoiding crookedness,\nThus the passage concludes: *\"Was this mere empty talk?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\"*\n\nWhat is meant by \"complete\"?\nNot merely preserving oneself—\nInternally, preserving oneself,\nExternally, preserving all things,\nSelf and all things both preserved,\nAnd returning to one’s nature—\nThen its straightness is profound indeed.\n\n**Dao’s Simplicity and Naturalness (Chapter 23)**\nThe Dao is simple yet naturally expressed.\n\nWhen words arise from nature,\nThey are simple yet precise;\nWhen forced from unnatural origins,\nThey are verbose and lacking in sincerity.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The Dao’s utterance is flavorless,\nYet its vision is unseen,\nIts hearing is unheard,\nIts use is inexhaustible—\nThis is called simplicity.\"*\n\nGales do not last the morning,\nTorrent rains do not last the day.\nWho causes this?\nThe heavens and earth.\nThe heavens and earth cannot endure long,\nHow much more so for humans?\n\nYin and Yang do not contend,\nYet winds and rains come in season—\nNeither hasty nor slow,\nExpending their full force before ceasing.\n\nBut when Yang dominates above,\nAnd Yin lingers below,\nSuppressed without release,\nThen gales and torrents arise—\nAs if they might never end,\nYet their force cannot last the day.\n\nThe ancient Sage spoke sparingly,\nActed with ease,\nAll in accordance with nature,\nThus enduring without exhaustion.\n\nThe world may weary of this,\nDeeming it inferior to deceptive speech that pleases the ear,\nOr bizarre conduct that startles the age,\nUnknowing that such cannot last.\n\nThus, those who follow the Dao:\nThose aligned with the Dao gain the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue gain virtue,\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue obtain virtue,\nThose aligned with loss obtain loss.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"If one’s resolve is in ren, there is no evil.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The errors of the virtuous are easily forgiven.\"*\n\nIf resolve in ren is thus,\nHow much more so for those resolved in the Dao?\n\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nThen what aligns with the Dao yields the Dao,\nWhat aligns with virtue yields virtue,\nAnd though misfortune may come,\nEven in loss, one gains in virtue and power.\n\nFaith insufficient, doubt arises.\nThe unknowing, lacking firm trust in the Dao,\nWhen they falter, they doubt it further,\nThus their unbelief grows.\n\nOnly the knowing do not let gain or loss shake their trust in the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Do Not Stand**\n\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk.\nThose who self-display see nothing,\nThose who self-approve are unillustrious,\nThose who self-praise achieve nothing,\nThose who self-glorify do not endure.\n\nNo one fails to both stand and walk,\nYet if one deems standing insufficient and adds limping,\nOr walking insufficient and adds striding,\nNone can retain their standing or walking.\n\nSo too with those who self-display, self-approve, self-praise, and self-glorify—\nThey are but excess, like superfluous food or burdensome limbs.\n\nAs with eating and drinking,\nModeration suffices,\nExcess brings sickness.\nAs with the four limbs,\nWholeness suffices,\nSuperfluity becomes a hindrance.\n\nSome may detest this,\nThus the Dao is shunned by many.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Whole**\n\nThere is a whole undifferentiated,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\nThe Dao is neither clear nor turbid,\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nNeither good nor evil—\nYet it forms a unity,\nIn humans, this is nature.\nThus it is said: *There is a whole undifferentiated.*\n\nNone know its origin,\nYet it exists silently and eternally,\nAnd from it, heaven and earth arise.\n\nSilent and vast,\nIndependent yet unchanging,\nCirculating yet unexhausted,\nIt may be called the Mother of all beneath heaven.\n\nSilent, without sound,\nVast, without form,\nIndependent, without rival,\nYet never failing in all things—\nDescending, it nurtures all creatures,\nThus it is their Mother.\n\nI know not its name,\nSo I call it the Dao.\nForcing a name upon it, I say: *Great.*\n\nThe Dao originally has no name,\nYet the Sage saw that all things arise from it,\nThus named it the Dao.\nSeeing that none can surpass it,\nThus forced the name *Great* upon it.\nYet truly, it cannot be named.\n\nGreat is fleeting,\nFleeting is distant,\nDistant is returning.\nSeeking it from Greatness, it flees and departs.\nSeeking it from departure, it is distant and unattainable.\nThough it flees and is distant,\nYet seeking it in return,\nA single-minded heart suffices.\n\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nAnd the Sage is Great.\nWithin the realm, there are four Great ones,\nAnd the Sage occupies one.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models the Dao,\nThe Dao models nature.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao,\nEven Heaven, Earth, and the Sage\nAre not as Great as it.\n\nYet the world knows the Greatness of these three,\nBut does not believe in the Dao’s Greatness.\nThus, speaking truly:\nHumans are not as great as Earth,\nEarth is not as great as Heaven,\nHeaven is not as great as the Dao,\nThe Dao is not as great as nature.\n\nYet if one were to recover their original nature in a day,\nThen these three, humans could fully embody them.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe still is the master of the restless.\n\nAll things—light cannot bear heavy,\nSmall cannot govern great,\nThe unmoving directs the moving,\nThe still controls the active.\nThus the light relies on the heavy as root,\nThe restless on the still as master.\n\nHence the Sage, though traveling all day,\nNever strays from his baggage.\nThough adorned with fine carriages,\nHe rests in quietude.\n\nTo walk lightly yet not abandon one’s baggage,\nTo enjoy splendor yet return to repose—\nThus the necessity of the heavy and the still is shown.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself for the world?\n\nIf the ruler burdens himself with the world\nYet lightens his own body,\nHe cannot bear the world.\n\nLightness loses subjects,\nRestlessness loses sovereignty.\nLightness and restlessness have no place to apply,\nYet if the ruler is light, his subjects know they cannot rely on him,\nIf his subjects are restless, he knows they seek only gain—\nThus it is said: *Lightness loses subjects, restlessness loses sovereignty.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way Leaves No Tracks**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks,\nIt rides the natural and thus leaves none.\nThe good speech has no flaws,\nIt speaks only when timely,\nThus its words fill the world without error.\nThe good plan requires no calculations,\nAll things’ numbers lie before it,\nKnown without reckoning—what need for calculations?\n\nThe good closure needs no bars yet cannot be opened,\nThe good binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThe fully virtuous toward all things\nAre like a mother to her children—\nThough they roam, they do not stray,\nThus no bars are needed yet it is closed,\nNo cords are needed yet it is bound.\n\nThus the Sage always rescues people,\nSo none are abandoned;\nAlways rescues things,\nSo none are discarded.\nThose who cling to calculations to plan,\nSet bars to close,\nHold cords to bind—\nTheir reach is limited.\n\nThe Sage toward people\nNot only tolerates them,\nBut rescues them.\nIf I do not abandon people,\nHow can people fail to return to me?\n\nThis is called **Embracing Clarity**. To rescue people from peril and hardship is not the greatest form of rescue. When they drift through life and death, obscured by things, and I urge them toward **my utmost Clarity** and share it with them, so that even those in darkness may shine bright as lamps—passing it on, one to another, without end—then this may be called **rescuing people well**.\n\nThus, the **good person** is the **teacher** of the **not-good person**,\nAnd the **not-good person** is the **means** of the **good person**.\nIf one does not **esteem their teacher**,\nNor **cherish their means**,\nThen the Sage acts without attachment to teaching,\nAnd thus the world acts without reverence for the Sage.\nThe Sage not only **forgets the world**,\nBut also **makes the world forget him**—\nThough **wise yet deeply confused**,\nThis is called **the utmost subtlety**.\nThe subtlety of the Sage\nIs such that even the wise cannot fully grasp it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\n\nTo **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to become the **valley** of the world.\nTo become the **valley** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** never departs,\nAnd returns to the **baby-like** state.\n\nTo **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to become the **model** of the world.\nTo become the **model** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** does not **compel**,\nAnd returns to the **boundless** state.\n\nTo **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to become the **receptacle** of the world.\nTo become the **receptacle** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** is then **sufficient**,\nAnd returns to **simplicity**.\n\nThe **Heroic** and **Feminine** are what comes before and after to me.\nThe **White** and **Black** are what comes as light and dark to me.\n**Honor** and **Humiliation** are what comes as nobility and lowliness to me.\n\nTo **love what comes before** and **hate what comes after**,\nTo **love the light** and **hate the dark**,\nTo **love nobility** and **hate lowliness**—\nThis is the nature of things.\n\nYet what comes before and after to me\nIs not as pressing as what comes as light and dark;\nWhat comes as light and dark to me\nIs not as deep as what comes as nobility and lowliness.\n\nThe ancient **Sages** discarded illusion to seek **recovery of their true nature**,\nAnd the clearer their **true nature** became,\nThe lower their **holding** was,\nThe thicker their **virtue** grew,\nAnd the greater their **return** was.\n\nTo **not act** when one does not **know** is not as profound as\nTo **know yet not act**—this is the utmost.\n\nTo **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to **know true nature**.\nTo **know true nature** and **cease striving with the heart**,\nThen all who seek to **prevail in the world’s strife**\nWill gather to it, like water flowing to a **valley**,\nNone will depart.\n\nThough it is like the **baby-like** state—able to **receive** yet not yet able to **use**—\nThus it is said: **\"return to the baby-like state.\"**\n\nTo **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to **see true nature**.\nTo **dwell in darkness** yet **perceive the light**,\nThen all who are **clear in the world**\nWill be unable to **escape with their forms**—\nThus the multitude **follows the model** as their **law**,\nThough it **responds to all things**,\nThe **law** never strays,\nThe **use** never exhausts—\nThus it is said: **\"return to the boundless state.\"**\n\nTo **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to **recover true nature**.\nWhen all illusions are exhausted,\nTo **abide in humiliation** without resentment,\nVast as the emptiness of a **valley**,\nThings come and **respond to it**,\n**Virtue** is sufficient here,\nPure **true nature** without admixture—\nThus it is said: **\"return to simplicity.\"**\n\n**Simplicity** dispersed becomes **vessels**,\nThe Sage **uses it** and it becomes **officials and leaders**,\nThus great **laws** are not **severed**.\nThe Sage, having **returned to simplicity**,\nAgain **disperses simplicity** into **vessels**,\nTo **respond to all things**.\n\nLike a **ruler** dividing governance to establish **officials and leaders**,\nIt is also **following the natural course of things**,\nThough **laws** are set, there is no **forcible division**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter of Taking the World**\n\nWhen one is about to **take the world** and do so,\nI see that it is **not inevitable**.\nThe Sage’s **possession of the world** is not **taking** it,\nBut all things **return to him**—\nHe **receives it** without inevitability.\n\nHis **governance of the world** is not **doing** it,\nBut **following the natural course of all things**,\nAnd **removing their harm** alone.\nIf one **desires to take** and **does so**,\nThen it cannot be **obtained**.\n\nThe world is a **divine vessel**,\n**Unforced**—it cannot be **done**.\nThe **doer** ruins it,\nThe **holder** loses it.\nAll things are **unforced**—\nThough there be **a hundred people gathered**,\nIf they do not **follow their own nature** and **act** inappropriately,\nThere will be **disputes** and **unsubmissive** ones,\nAnd how much more so the world?\n\nThough small things may **few in number**,\nThere are some that can be **taken by force** or **won by cunning**,\nBut as for the world’s vastness,\nThere is a **divine master** within it—\nIf one does not **await its own return**,\nIt will **rebel**;\nIf one does not **listen to its own governance**,\nIt will **become chaotic**.\n\nAll things either **move** or **follow**,\nAre either **molded** or **shaped**,\nAre either **strengthened** or **weakened**,\nAre either **borne** or **broken**.\nThus the Sage **discards excess**, **discards extravagance**, **discards overreach**.\n\n**Yin** and **Yang** surge and **counterbalance**,\nThe **high** and **low** **tilt and incline**,\nThe **great** and **small** **command and obey**—\nSome **move** in front,\nSome **follow** behind,\nSome **yield** and are **warmed**,\nSome **resist** and are **chilled**,\nSome are **augmented** and **strengthened**,\nSome are **diminished** and **weakened**,\nSome are **borne** and **completed**,\nSome are **circumvented** and **destroyed**—\nAll are the **natural course of things**,\nAnd **inevitable** in their **power**.\n\nYet the world’s **foolish people**,\n**Selfishly** and **pursuing gain**,\nNow **desire to force** yet **contradict** it—\nTheir **calamity** will not **overturn** but **break**.\nOnly the Sage **knows** that it cannot be **reversed**,\nAnd thus **follows and awaits** it,\nDiscarding **excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**,\nSo that it does not **reach extremes** and **injure things**,\nAnd the world has no **suffering**—\nThis is the **utmost of non-action**.\n\n**Yao** and **Tang** faced **floods and droughts**,\nThough they could not **avoid them entirely**,\nYet they never **reached ruin**—\nThis is why.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of **Overreach**:\n*\"The later **ruler** with **wealth** fulfills the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\n**Aids and aligns** with the **proper roles of Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd **governs the people** with **right and left**.\nThree **Yang** within, three **Yin** without—\nThe **extreme of things** is reached.\nThe Sage **fears** its **excess** and **harm to life**,\nThus **wealth** is fulfilled and **aided**,\nSo that it does not **reach extremes**—\nThis is called **discarding excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Ruler with the Dao**\n\nTo **assist the ruler** with the **Dao** is to\n**Not use force** to **subdue the world**,\nAnd to **love the return** of things.\n\nThe Sage **uses arms**,\nAll **arise from inevitability**.\nIf not from inevitability yet **desires to force and conquer the world**,\nThough sometimes **able to conquer**,\nThe **calamity** will **return and be repaid**.\n\n「The rulers of Chu Ling, Qi Min, Qin Shi Huang, and Han Xiaowu—\nSome perished by death themselves, some brought calamity upon their descendants.\nWhat men abhor, the spirits detest—\nNone have escaped its retribution.\n\nWhere armies march, brambles and thorns arise.\nAfter great campaigns, there are years of famine.\nWhere war is waged, civil affairs decay—\nThus fields lie unplowed.\nAfter war, the **killing-qi** prevails—\nHence crops are blighted.\nAll wars are thus, yet how much worse is he who **uses arms to force and conquer the world**?\nTherefore, the **good** man **fruits** his actions,\nAnd dares not **take by force**.\n**Fruiting** is a secondary measure.\nWhat **virtue/power** cannot pacify, what **governance** cannot subdue,\nThen, with no alternative, **force** is applied as a last resort.\nYet when he **fruits**, let him **not boast**,\nLet him **not gloat**,\nLet him **not be arrogant**,\nAnd let him **not act without necessity**—\nThis is the **fruiting without force**.\n**Not boasting**, **not gloating**, **not being arrogant**, and **acting without necessity**—\nThese four principles constitute **not taking by force**.\n\nWhen things are at their peak, they decline—\nThis is called **not the Dao/Way**,\nAnd **not the Dao/Way** brings early decay.\nThe peak of vigor must decline—\nNo thing defies this law.\nOnly the **good** who **embodies the Dao/Way**,\nWhen fulfilled, appears as if lacking,\nWhen abundant, seems as if empty—\nNever overreaching, thus never declining,\nNever perishing.\nTo **use arms to force and conquer the world** is to overreach greatly—\nYet how can it avoid decline?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-one: On the Fine Use of Arms**\nThe fine use of arms is the **unauspicious instrument**,\nWhich men often detest—\nThus the **good** do not dwell upon it.\nTo employ it to **resolve difficulties**,\nYet not to make it a constant practice—\nThis is called **not dwelling upon it**.\nThe **gentleman** values the left in peace,\nYet values the right in war.\nArms are the **unauspicious instrument**,\nNot the **gentleman’s** tool—\nWhen used without alternative, **serenity** is the highest virtue.\nTo **victory without delight**,\nYet those who delight in it—\nThese are those who **take pleasure in killing**.\nHe who **takes pleasure in killing**,\nCannot **fulfill his ambitions** in the world.\n\n**Auspicious matters** honor the left,\n**Inauspicious matters** honor the right.\nThe **commander of the left wing** is stationed on the left,\nThe **commander of the right wing** on the right—\nThis is spoken of in terms of **funeral rites**.\nWhen many are slain, let them be **mourned with sorrowful weeping**,\nAnd **victory** should be treated as if a **funeral rite**.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-two: The Dao/Way is Ever Nameless**»\n\nThe Dao/Way is ever nameless.\n\n「Though crude and small, the Dao/Way commands reverence from all under heaven.\nIf lords and kings could but preserve it,\nAll things would willingly come to serve them.\n\nCrude—this is its true nature.\nSince the Dao/Way is ever nameless,\nIts nature too cannot be named.\nThus, when it expands, it fills all things,\nYet when it contracts, it does not exceed the finest hair’s end—\nThis is why, though small, it cannot be enslaved.\n\nEven the lowliest man, if he guards it,\nMay use dust and dross to mold Yao and Shun;\nBut lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,\nAnd so all things do not come to serve them.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nAnd sweet dew descends—\nNo man commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nThe **Yin** and **Yang** *qi* rise and fall,\nUniting as one to descend sweet dew,\nWhich glistens upon all things,\nNever failing to spread evenly.\n\nThe sage embodies the ultimate Dao/Way,\nResponding to all existence—\nLike sweet dew, it reaches all without exception.\nThis is why he can make all things come to serve him.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way first took form,\nNames were established.\nOnce names are given,\nEven the wise know when to stop—\nFor knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.\n\nThe sage disperses the crude Dao/Way into **instruments**,\nThen uses these **instruments** to establish names—\nHow could he abandon the crude for the named,\nOr chase after trifles while losing his foundation?\n\nHe understands returning to its true nature,\nThus he rides through all transformations without ruin.\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\nThe great seas are the **reservoir** of water;\nRivers and valleys are its **divisions**.\nThe Dao/Way is the **origin** of all things;\nAll things are its **manifestations**.\nAll are water, so rivers and valleys return to their **reservoir**;\nAll are the Dao/Way, so things return to their **origin**.\nHe who knows others is wise,\nHe who knows himself is clear.\n\nTo discern is to know,\nTo encompass fully is to be clear.\nAs long as the heart of discernment remains,\nOne stops at knowing others but cannot know himself.\nWhen fully encompassing, there is no longer discernment,\nThus one can know himself and yet also reach others.\n\nHe who overcomes others has strength,\nHe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nStrength can reach others but not oneself,\nYet one who can conquer self and restore true nature—\nThis is beyond the reach of mere strength,\nAnd so he may be called powerful.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nThe one who knows contentment finds sufficiency in what he encounters,\nAnd so he is never without richness.\nThough he possess all under heaven,\nIf he constantly harbors the thought of insufficiency,\nThen he can never be truly rich.\n\nThe resolute have ambition.\nTo not contend with things yet remain ever self-strengthening—\nNo thing can take away his ambition.\nHe who does not lose his place endures long.\nThings transform endlessly,\nYet if his heart never strays,\nThen he endures long.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\nThe transformation of life and death is vast indeed;\nYet if his true nature remains undiminished and unlost,\nThis is the ancient **Perfect Man** who neither lives nor dies.\n\nThe great Dao/Way is vast and all-encompassing,\nIts influence cannot be confined to left or right.\nVast and all-encompassing, it has neither \"yes\" nor \"no,\"\nThus it moves freely above and below,\nCirculating without end.\n\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not claim them as its own.\nWhen its work is done, it takes no credit.\nThe world has those who nourish things yet do not claim them—\nThey will surely name them as their own.\nThe world has those who flee from things yet do not possess them—\nThey will surely reject things and fail to live.\nTo live without claiming,\nTo achieve without taking credit—\nOnly the Dao/Way does this.\n\nTo cherish and nourish all things yet not lord over them,\nTo always lack desire—\nThis may be called \"small.\"\nAll things returning to it without its lording over them—\nThis may be called \"great.\"\n\nThus the sage never claims to be great,\nAnd so he achieves true greatness.\nIf one claims greatness with a heart of greatness,\nThen he is small.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: He Who Knows Others is Wise**»\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: He Who Knows Contentment is Rich**»\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Grasping the Great Image**»\n\nTo grasp the **Great Image**,\nAll under heaven will come to it.\nThe Dao/Way is neither having nor lacking,\nThus it is called the **Great Image**.\nIf it were clearly manifest in form,\nThere would be likeness and difference.\nThe like would be loved,\nThe unlike would be hated.\nTo be loved, they would come;\nTo be hated, they would go—\nYet this would not suffice to make all under heaven come to it.\n\nTo come without harm,\nTo rest in ease, peace, and harmony.\nIf there is love and hate,\nThen there are things to benefit and things to harm;\nIf love and hate are fully exhausted,\nThen it is without harm to all things.\n\nThus the ultimate comes to rest in ease,\nIn peace, and in harmony.\nDelight and bait,\nThe passing traveler stops.\nThe Dao/Way, when spoken of,\nIs bland and without flavor;\nTo look upon it, one sees no form;\nTo listen to it, one hears no sound;\nTo use it, one cannot exhaust it.\n\nTo create delight and set bait,\nTo await those who come—\nSurely this would suffice to stop the passing traveler?\nYet when the delight is spent and the bait exhausted,\nThey will gather it up and depart.\n\nBut if one grasps the **Great Image** to await all under heaven,\nAll under heaven will not know to love it—\nHow much less would they know to hate it?\nThough it lacks scent, flavor, form, color, or sound to please men,\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Sage’s Way of Giving**»\n\nWhen one is about to **withdraw** it,\nHe must first **fully extend** it;\nWhen one is about to **weaken** it,\nHe must first **fully strengthen** it;\nWhen one is about to **abolish** it,\nHe must first **fully establish** it;\nWhen one is about to **take away** it,\nHe must first **fully give** it—\nThis is called **subtle clarity**.\n\nIf one takes away without first giving,\nThen its **force** will not be fully realized,\nAnd its **principle** will be lacking.\nIf the **force** is not fully realized,\nThen taking it will be difficult;\nIf the **principle** is lacking,\nThen things will not submit to it.\nYet this is nearly the same as using **wisdom**,\nAnd what difference is there between it and Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?\n\nThe sage’s way and the world’s way\nDo indeed have traces of similarity.\n\nThe sage rides upon **principle**,\nWhile the world uses **wisdom**.\nTo ride upon **principle** is like a skilled physician\nApplying remedies precisely to the disease;\nTo use **wisdom** is like a shrewd merchant\nSeeking clever gains.\n\nThe supple overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong.\nThe sage knows that rigid strength is not to be relied upon,\nThus he treats himself with supple weakness.\nWhen the world’s rigid strength is contending,\nMutually undermining each other,\nYet I alone remain supple and weak to await them—\nWhen the great are injured and the small perish,\nI sit without retaliation, letting them die.\nThis is called victory.\n\nYet the sage does not intend to do this and overcome things—\nHe simply knows the **nature of things**,\nAnd abides in their natural course.\n\n「A fish cannot be taken from its depths—\nthe sharp instruments of a state\nshould not be displayed to the people.\n\nThe fish is not a creature\nwith claws and teeth to overpower others,\nyet when it dwells in the deep waters,\neven the strong and powerful\ncannot seize it.\nOnce it leaves the depths and comes to land,\nit becomes but a clumsy thing,\nwhat can it do?\n\nThe sage abides in supple weakness,\nand the rigid and strong cannot harm him.\nNot only can they not harm him,\nbut he also uses it to **restrain the latter with the former**#3—\nIs this not also the sharp instrument of the world?\n\nThe fish is only subdued\nwhen it leaves the depths.\nThe sage is only able to conquer all\nwhen he remains in supple weakness without satiety,\nfor this is not something shared with the common people.\n\n**Dao/Way is ever without action yet without fail does all.**\nIt is without action yet without fail does all—\nthis is the intent of its **natural course**.\n\nIf lords and kings could guard it,\nall things would naturally transform.\nWhen transformation occurs and they seek to act,\nI shall **settle them with the nameless simplicity**#2.\nThe sage **transforms all through non-action**,\nand all things transform—\nbeginning from non-action,\ngradually reaching action,\nlike the growth of an infant\nand the rise of human artifice.\n\nThus, the decline of the Three Dynasties,\nthe change in human sentiment,\ngrows ever more severe,\nwhen they begin to act\nand the rulers above and the people below\nall succumb to **decadence**#1,\ntheir changes become so extreme\nas to be beyond measure.\n\nIf they act yet are not moved by it,\nand are settled with the nameless simplicity,\nperhaps they may be stopped.\n\nThe nameless simplicity will also not desire,\nand through non-desire attains tranquility—\nthe world will naturally **correct itself**.\n\nThe sage harbors no thought of **embracing simplicity** within,\nnor speaks of it without,\nthus his simplicity is whole\nand his use is vast.\nIf the heart of **embracing simplicity** still lingers in the chest,\nit is lost indeed.\n\n**Dao/Way is ever without action, Chapter Thirty-Seventh** concludes.\n**Dao/Way is ever without action, Volume Two of the Annotated Scripture** concludes.»\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eighth: The Supreme Virtue Does Not Virtue**\n\nThe supreme virtue does not cling to virtue,\nand thus virtue is complete.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue,\nand thus virtue is lost.\n\nThe sage follows his heart’s desire without overstepping measure,\nnot deliberately cultivating virtue—virtue suffices on its own.\nThose below know virtue’s worth and strive to retain it,\nyet merely preserve themselves—what true virtue do they possess?\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe lesser virtue acts and yet still strives to act.\nTo act while striving to act is still action.\nOnly when acting without striving to act\ncan one truly be said to act without action.\n\nThose below cannot succeed without action,\nyet they still strive to act—\nnot merely performing without safeguarding.\n\nSupreme benevolence acts without striving to act,\nsupreme righteousness acts while striving to act.\nBoth benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action—\ntheir difference lies in this:\nBenevolence excels in acting without striving,\nwhile righteousness takes pride in acting with striving.\n\nVirtue has high and low,\nbut benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—\nwhy?\nBecause those beneath benevolence and righteousness\nare not worth further discussion.\n\nSupreme ritual acts, yet none respond,\nso it forces compliance with bared arms.\nFrom virtue descending to ritual,\nthe sage’s means to order the people are exhausted.\n\nThus, when action meets no response,\nit resorts to bared arms and coercion;\nwhen coercion fails, punishments arise and arms are raised—\nthen it is mere performance without fulfillment.\n\nHence, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises#1;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\nRitual, though thin in loyalty and trust,\nis the beginning of chaos.\nLoyalty and trust without ritual remain unseen,\nbut ritual established makes their virtues flare outward.\n\nBetween ruler and subject, parent and child,\nhusband and wife, friends—\ntheir outward forms are rigid,\nyet their inner substance is exhausted.\nThus, adherence brings order,\nwhile defiance brings chaos.\nThe distance between order and chaos is infinitesimal—\nhence, ritual is called the origin of chaos.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is the adornment of the Dao,\nyet the beginning of folly.\nThe sage gazes profoundly upon all things,\nlaying out right and wrong, gain and loss before him,\nlike a mirror reflecting forms—\nnothing escapes his sight.\nYet what is before or behind?\nCommon folk see only with their eyes,\nhear only with their ears,\nthink only with their minds,\nand wander blindly among things,\nexhausting their intelligence to seek knowledge,\noccasionally glimpsing truth—\nthough they deem themselves enlightened,\nthey know not that their greatest folly begins with self-assurance.\n\nThus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nin reality, not in adornment—\nand so he discards the latter for the former.\nThe vulgar delight in what they gain below,\nforgetting what is above—\nthey rejoice in superficiality and abandon substance.\nWho but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Ninth: The Ancient Attainment of Oneness**\n\nIn ancient times, those who attained Oneness:\nThe heavens attained Oneness and became clear,\nthe earth attained Oneness and became tranquil,\nthe spirit attained Oneness and became numinous,\nthe valleys attained Oneness and became full,\nall things attained Oneness and flourished,\nand the sovereigns attained Oneness to become the standard of the world.\n\nOneness—this is the Dao.\nAll things attain their being through the Dao.\nYet people of the world see things and forget the Dao.\n\nThe heavens know only their clarity,\nthe earth knows only their tranquility,\nthe spirit knows only their numinosity,\nthe valleys know only their fullness,\nall things know only their flourishing,\nand the sovereigns know only their authority over the world.\nThey do not know the source of what they possess—\nall is the Dao abiding within.\n\nIf the heavens lost Oneness, they would fear collapse,\nif the earth lost Oneness, they would fear upheaval,\nif the spirit lost Oneness, they would fear cessation,\nif the valleys lost Oneness, they would fear exhaustion,\nif all things lost Oneness, they would fear annihilation,\nif the sovereigns lost Oneness, they would fear ruin.\n*\"Extreme\"* refers to their limits.\n\nHad the heavens not attained Oneness, they would not yet have collapsed,\nhad the earth not attained Oneness, they would not yet have upheaved,\nhad the spirit not attained Oneness, they would not yet have ceased,\nhad the valleys not attained Oneness, they would not yet have exhausted,\nhad all things not attained Oneness, they would not yet have annihilated,\nhad the sovereigns not attained Oneness, they would not yet have ruined—\nyet their extremes must reach this point.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as foundation,\nthe high relies on the lowly as base.\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nthe nobility of sovereigns—\nall are governed by Oneness.\n\nWhat, then, is this Oneness?\nSee it, and it cannot be seen;\ngrasp it, and it cannot be held—\nyet it is the most subtle of all things under heaven,\nthis so-called lowly and humble.\n\nThus, sovereigns call themselves \"lonely, few, and unworthy\"—\nis this not taking the lowly as foundation?\nIs it not?\nThose who made such claims in ancient times\nmerely emphasized the root while neglecting the branches.\n\nHence, the carriage’s parts—wheels, spokes, canopy, axles, poles, yokes, hubs, and fittings—\nare countable, yet the carriage itself is not counted.\nOnly then does one know that the carriage is formed by what is *not* there—\nthis is called \"using the nonexistent for utility.\"\n\nYet would heaven and earth seek to become vast through vastness?\nWould sovereigns seek to become noble through nobility?\n\nThe Oneness within vastness and nobility is preserved—\nthis is the way they become heaven and earth, sovereigns and lords,\nyet few recognize it.\n\nHence, there is nobility in the humble and humility in the noble—\nnot like jade’s polished brilliance, noble yet unable to humble,\nnor like stone’s rugged solidity, humble yet unable to become noble.\n\n**The chapter on the Dao’s movement as reversal (Chapter 40):**\nReversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle.\nReturning to one’s true nature brings stillness,\nyet its motionless repose,\nsensing and responding to all things under heaven,\nis where movement originates.\n\nWeakness is the Dao’s utility.\nThe Dao has no form, no sound—\nnothing under heaven is weaker than the Dao,\nyet nothing surpasses its ultimate strength.\nThis is why it can govern all things.\n\nAll things arise from existence,\nexistence arises from nonexistence.\nThe world does not know stillness as movement,\nweakness as strength,\nso I reveal to them what gives rise to things.\n\nFor the world knows only that existence gives birth to nonexistence,\nyet never hears that nonexistence gives birth to existence.\n**The chapter on the noble hearer of the Dao (Chapter 41):**\n\nThe noble hearer of the Dao,\nassiduously practices it;\nthe middle hearer of the Dao,\nholds it as if it exists, as if it does not;\nthe lowly hearer of the Dao,\nlaughs at it.\nTo not laugh is insufficient for the Dao.\n\nThe Dao is not a form—\nit cannot be seen;\nit is not a sound—\nit cannot be heard.\nWithout first knowing the futility of all things,\none remains unenlightened, yet still doubts—\nthus, the lowly hearer of the Dao\nconsiders it absurd and laughable.\n\nThe middle hearer of the Dao,\nwith it appearing and vanishing,\ndoubts it.\n\nOnly those who clearly perceive it\nthen diligently practice and embrace it without slacking.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"When I speak to him and he does not grow weary,\nis it not my disciple Zilu?\"*\nThis is the so-called noble hearer.\n\n**The chapter on establishing teachings (Chapter 42):**\nThe ancient ones who established teachings\nhad such words, yet Laozi took only the lower part of their argument.\n\nThe Dao’s clarity is like darkness—\nit illuminates all things yet is not scrutiny.\nAdvancing the Dao is like retreating—\nthough seemingly idle, it surpasses all things under heaven.\n\nThe Dao’s evenness is like its unevenness—\nthough it reaches everywhere, it does not carve or force.\n**Virtue’s** loftiness is like a valley—\n**virtue’s** loftiness is not **virtue**,\nlike the emptiness of a valley.\n\nGreat brightness is like shame—\nto let brightness remain untainted,\nthis is the man who neither clings to purity nor despises impurity,\nnot the sage.\n\nExpansive **virtue** is like insufficiency—\nwhen **virtue** is vast and cannot be further added,\nit rests there alone—\nthis is not expansion.\n\nEstablishing **virtue** is like thievery—\nfollowing the natural course of things without imposing,\nthough outwardly it seems like laziness,\nin truth it is establishment.\n\nTrue substance is like overflow—\nembracing nature and holding the spirit,\nadapting to transformations without losing its essence,\nthough outwardly it seems like excess.\n\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nit preserves its vastness,\nnot erecting petty angles.\n\nGreat vessels take time to form—\ntheir magnitude renders them unfit for hasty use.\n\nGreat sound is rare—\nit cannot be heard by the ear.\nGreat image has no form—\nit cannot be seen by the eye.\n\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless.\nOnly the Dao is good at lending and completing.\nWhere the Dao meets things,\nit is seen in all things—\nthese twelve aspects are all the Dao’s manifestations in affairs.\nYet the Dao’s complete essence\nis hidden in its namelessness,\nonly in its meetings does it extend its surplus to lend to deficiencies,\nand all things rely upon it to come into being.\n\n**The chapter on the Dao generating Oneness (Chapter 42):**\nThe Dao generates Oneness,\nOneness generates Twoness,\nTwoness generates Threeness,\nThreeness generates all things.\n\nAll things carry the yin while embracing the yang,\nand the harmonizing *qi* as their balance.\nThe Dao is neither Oneness nor Twoness—\nwhen it pairs with things, the Dao is Oneness while things are not Oneness,\nso it is named Oneness, yet the Dao is not Oneness.\n\nOneness with Oneness makes Twoness,\nTwoness with Oneness makes Threeness—\nthus all things are generated.\nThough there are myriad differences,\nnone fail to carry the yin while embracing the yang,\nand the harmonizing *qi* as their balance—\nfor things arise from Threeness,\nand Threeness arises from Oneness,\nthe natural principle of things.\n\nWhat men detest is the lonely, few, and unworthy—\nyet kings and dukes claim such titles.\nMen of the world do not know\nwhat gives rise to all things,\nall deeming the few, the small, and the humble as lowly,\nwhile the many, the great, and the noble are esteemed.\n\nYet kings and dukes, though honored,\nstill call themselves lonely, few, and unworthy—\nthe ancient enlightened ones\nalready knew this.\n\nThings may be diminished yet benefit,\nor increased yet harm.\nWhat men are taught,\nis also what I teach them.\n\nThe strong and rigid\ndo not attain their natural end.\nI shall make this their guiding principle.\n\nThe world regards yielding and weakness as harm,\nwhile strength and rigidity as benefit,\nyet they do not know the truth.\nThus, I shall teach all under heaven:\n*\"Do you not see how the strong and rigid fail to attain their natural end?\"*\n\nStrength and rigidity are the extreme of futility.\nIf men know that strength and rigidity cannot escape death,\nthen they know that futility cannot be relied upon;\nif they know that futility cannot be relied upon,\nonly then can they be spoken to about the Dao.\n\nThus it is said:\nI shall make this their guiding principle.\n\n**The chapter on the utmost yielding (Chapter 43):**\nThe utmost yielding under heaven,\noverruns the utmost firmness under heaven.\nThere is no entering without resistance—\nthus I know the benefits of non-action.\n\nUsing firmness to resist firmness,\nwithout yielding, it breaks;\nusing yielding to resist firmness,\nthe yielding does not waste away,\nthe firmness does not suffer.\nSeeking this in things,\nwater is the example.\n\nUsing existence to enter existence,\ndefenses repel each other;\nusing nonexistence to enter existence,\nnonexistence never tires,\nexistence never resents.\nSeeking this in things,\nghosts and spirits are the example.\n\nThus the sage alone can practice non-action,\nand so govern all the strong,\nenter and exit all things.\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nthe benefit of non-action,\nfew under heaven can attain it.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 44: The Chapter on Name and Body**\nWhich is more intimate—name and body?\nWhich is more abundant—body and wealth?\nTo value the body above name,\nto honor the body while despising wealth,\nis still not to have forgotten oneself.\nThe one who forgets oneself,\ndoes not even possess the body—\nhow much less name and wealth?\n\nYet to esteem the body as the world’s treasure,\none must forget oneself.\nThus, when the world knows\nthat name is not worth cherishing,\nthat wealth is not worth hoarding,\nthen one knows how to honor the body.\nTo know how to honor the body,\nthen one knows how to forget oneself—\nthis is the intent of Laozi.\n\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\nThe one who does not attain wealth\nconsiders loss a harm;\nbut when wealth is gained and then lost,\nthe harm is even greater than loss itself.\nOnly by equalizing gain and loss,\nbalancing possession and privation,\ncan one avoid harm.\n\nThus, the more one loves,\nthe greater the cost;\nthe more one hoards,\nthe greater the loss.\nExcessive love\nleads one to do anything to obtain it—\nhow can this avoid depletion?\nExcessive hoarding\ndraws countless assailants—\nhow can this avoid destruction?\n\nContentment with what one has brings no disgrace,\nknowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one can endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 45: The Chapter on Great Achievement Resembling Deficiency**\nGreat achievement resembles deficiency—\nits application is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness—\nits utility is never spent.\n\nThe world regards non-deficiency as achievement,\nyet such achievement inevitably falters.\nIt regards non-emptiness as fullness,\nyet such fullness inevitably ceases.\n\nThe sage seeks great achievement\nwithout worrying about its resemblance to deficiency,\nstrives for great fullness\nwithout abhorring its resemblance to emptiness—\nthus his achievement never falters,\nhis fullness never ceases.\n\nGreat rectitude resembles bending,\ngreat skill resembles clumsiness,\ngreat eloquence resembles stammering.\nRectitude that does not bend\nis itself broken;\nfollowing principle in action,\nthough curved, remains straight.\n\nSkill that does not seem clumsy\nis itself exhausted;\ntrusting nature’s course,\nthough clumsy, is truly skillful.\n\nEloquence that does not stammer\nis itself spent;\nspeaking according to principle,\nthough stammering, is truly eloquent.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\ntranquility overcomes heat,\nyet purity and stillness are the world’s true norm.\n\nTo achieve without deficiency,\nto be full without emptiness,\nto be straight without bending,\nto be skillful without clumsiness,\nto be eloquent without stammering—\nthis is like agitation that cannot be tranquil,\ntranquility that cannot be agitated.\nAgitation can overcome cold but not heat,\ntranquility can overcome heat but not cold—\nboth are stuck in one extreme,\nnot reaching the true norm.\n\nOnly when one is settled in purity and stillness,\nuntainted by any one thing,\nneither achieving nor deficient,\nneither full nor empty,\nneither straight nor bent,\nneither skillful nor clumsy,\nneither eloquent nor stammering—\nthen one can overcome all things,\nand stand as the world’s true norm.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 46: The Chapter on the World’s Dao**\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nwarhorses are turned into manure.\nWhen the world has the Dao,\neach follows its proper place—\nthere is no strife, yet all is governed,\nthus warhorses are turned into manure.\n\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo guilt is greater than craving what is forbidden,\nno calamity is greater than ignorance of contentment,\nno blame is greater than greed for what one desires.\n\nTo display one’s forbidden cravings to others,\nis already a guilt;\nbut to fail in satisfying others’ desires,\nthe calamity is even worse.\nTo demand that all desires be fulfilled,\nthe blame is the greatest.\n\nEven a common man\nwill suffer when he clings to one thing—\nhow much more the lord and king!\nThus warhorses arise.\n\nHence, to know contentment is true contentment.\nThe contented man\nfinds sufficiency in what he encounters—\nthus he knows no lack.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47: The Chapter on Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door,\nyet knowing the world;\nnot peering through the window,\nyet seeing the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\n\nThe nature of things\npervades the cosmos—\nno difference in far or near,\nancient or modern.\n\nThe sage of old\nknew all without leaving door or window—\nfor his nature was complete.\n\nThe world’s people\nare obscured by things,\ntheir nature divided by ears and eyes.\nWithin, they are troubled by body and mind;\nwithout, they are blocked by mountains and rivers.\nThey see but do not perceive,\nthey hear but do not comprehend.\nEven the smallest opening of door or window\ncan obscure and cut them off—\nthey do not know that the sage restores his nature\nand finds sufficiency within,\nyet they still seek to go out and gain more—\nthus the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nHence the sage acts without moving,\nyet knows all;\nhe names without seeing,\nyet is precise;\nhe accomplishes without doing,\nyet all is done.\nWhat the nature attains,\nis not merely knowing and naming—\nit is to follow things’ natural course,\nand achieve without effort.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 48: The Chapter on Daily Gain and Loss**\nTo study daily is to gain—\nbut if one does not know the Dao\nand yet still studies,\nthe more one hears and sees,\nthe more one is scattered,\nand one is not yet a true learner.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Much hearing—\nchoose the good and follow it.\nMuch seeing—\ndiscern and understand.\nThis is the second stage of knowing.\"*\n\nTo cultivate the Dao daily is to diminish—\nif one attains the Dao in a single day,\nand looks upon all things,\nnone are not false.\nAbandoning falsehood to seek the restoration of nature,\none’s nature is truly few in number.\n\nConfucius said to Zigong:\n*\"Zigong, do you think I am the kind who hears much and understands it all?\"*\n*\"Yes, is it not so?\"*\n*\"No! I grasp one thing to thread it all.\"*\n\n**Chapter 49: The Chapter on the Saint’s Lack of Fixed Intent**\n\nFurther diminish, and diminish again,\nuntil arriving at **non-action**—\n**non-action** yet nothing remains undone.\n\nAbandon falsehood to seek the restoration of nature,\nthis may be called diminishing.\nYet the mind of abandoning falsehood still lingers;\nuntil it also forgets this mind,\nand returns to pure nature without remainder,\nthen nothing remains undone,\nyet one does not lose **non-action**.\n\nTo take the world is often done through **non-action**—\nwhen there is action,\nit is insufficient to take the world.\n\nAll men possess the mind of taking the world,\nthus they create affairs to seek it,\nand their intent is revealed outwardly,\nwhile things resent them—\nhence, it can never be attained.\n\nThe Sage practices **non-action**,\nthus there are no affairs.\nHis intent is revealed outwardly,\nyet things find peace in it—\nthough he does not take the world,\nthe world is drawn to him.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 50: The Chapter on Life and Death**\n\nLife and death are born and enter,\nbut nature knows neither.\nTo emerge is to be born,\nto return is to die.\n\nThose who cling to life number thirteen,\nthose who cling to death number thirteen,\nand men who live yet are moved toward death number thirteen.\n\nThose who take **substance** and refine **essence** to nourish themselves\nare among those who cling to life.\nThose who indulge in **sounds, colors, aromas, and tastes** to harm themselves\nare among those who cling to death.\nThese two have already divided the Dao of life and death.\n\nI also know **action** yet do not know **rest**,\nknow **speech** yet do not know **silence**,\nknow **thought** yet do not know **forgetting**,\nand thus pursue **exhaustion**—\nthis is what is called being moved toward death.\n\nThe Dao of life and death may be spoken of in ten terms,\nand the three categories each occupy three—\nis it not that nine belong to the Dao of life and death,\nwhile only one belongs to the Dao of neither life nor death?\n\nNeither life nor death,\nthis is what the *I Ching* calls **\"tranquil stillness, unmoved\"**—\n\nLaozi speaks of the nine,\nyet does not speak of the one,\nletting man find it himself,\nto entrust the mystery of **non-thought, non-action**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the profoundness of **eternal life**.\n\n「Thus, where there is life, there is death,\nand so those who cling to life are but those who cling to death.\n\nThe reliance of man upon life is profound,\nand thus the Dao of death is ever nineteen-fold.\n\nFor I have heard that those skilled in preserving life\nwalk upon land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nand weapons no place to hold their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for them.\n\nThe **Perfect Ones** dwell perpetually in the realm of neither life nor death—\nif there is no place of life, how much less a place of death?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Nourishes and Accumulates**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to life,\n**virtue** nurtures and sustains it,\nthings take their form from it,\nand **force** brings them to completion.\n\nThe Dao is the mother of all things,\nand thus it is the Dao that gives birth to all things.\nWhen its movement becomes **virtue**, it tends to the multitude without wearying,\nand thus it is **virtue** that sustains all things.\n\nYet **virtue** and the Dao cannot manifest themselves alone;\nthey rely on things to reveal their presence.\nThings cannot complete themselves alone;\nnear and far interact,\nhard and soft intermingle,\nand through accumulation, **force** arises,\nonly then do the changes of flourishing and decline, order and chaos, come to fruition.\n\nTherefore, all things revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem.\nThough form arises from things and completion from **force**,\nwithout the Dao, there would be no birth,\nand without **virtue**, there would be no sustenance.\nThus, to revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem,\nto revere it as one would a father or elder brother,\nto hold it in high esteem as one would a noble lord,\nfor the Dao is without rank while **virtue** bears a name.\n\nThe reverence of the Dao and the honor of **virtue**,\nnone bestow them yet they remain ever natural.\nThose who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor,\nare not truly revered or honored.\nHence the Dao nourishes, sustains, grows, matures, and fosters all things—\ngiving birth yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\nlengthening yet not controlling.\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of the World**\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the mother of all things.\n\nThe **Nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nthe **Named** is the mother of all things.\nBefore the Dao takes on the **Named**, it is the source from which things arise;\nwhen it takes on the **Named**, it is the means by which things are born.\nThus it is called both **beginning** and **mother**.\nIts offspring are all things.\n\nHaving obtained its **mother**,\none knows its offspring;\nhaving known its offspring,\none returns to guard its **mother**,\nand thus one’s life is never in peril.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,\nlike one who knows the child through the mother—\nclearly perceptive without fail.\nThough their wisdom may encompass all things,\nthey never forget the Dao in their pursuit of things,\nand thus they always return to guard its **mother**.\n\nStop their **joys** and close their **gates**,\nand they will never tire in their lifetime.\nOpen their **joys** and aid their pursuits,\nand they will never be saved in their lifetime.\n\nAll under heaven possess this Dao,\nyet they constantly rest and forget the Dao while yielding to things.\nThe eyes delight in colors,\nthe ears delight in sounds,\nand when their delightful hearts are opened,\ntheir affairs are aided—\nthus they fall into ruin all their lives and cannot be saved.\n\nThe reason the sage remains unmoved throughout life,\nis that they stop and close their **gates**,\nnever venturing forth to yield to things.\n\nSeeing small as clear,\ndelight is harmful.\nThe beginning is small yet grows vast.\nKnowing that small will become great and closing it,\nthis may be called clear.\n\nGuarding softness as strength.\nFollowing what one delights in without restraint,\none may think oneself strong,\nyet this is not true strength.\nOnly those who see delight and fear it,\nmay be called truly strong.\n\nUsing its **radiance** yet returning to its **clarity**,\nwithout leaving one’s body to harm,\nthis is called **embracing constancy**.\n\nCommon folk open their **delights** and yield their bodies to things,\ngoing forth without return.\nThe sage stops and closes their **gates**,\nnot rejecting things outright,\nbut responding with their **spirit** and using its **radiance** alone—\ntheir body does not engage.\n\nThe ears can hear,\nthe eyes can see,\nthe nose can smell,\nthe mouth can taste,\nthe body can touch,\nand the mind can think—\nall these are called **radiance**.\n\nIndeed, **radiance** interacts with things,\nbut when things depart, **clarity** is undiminished.\nThus it responds to all changes without exhaustion,\nand harm does not reach its body.\nHence its constant nature remains pure and unbroken.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Let Me Be Simple**\n\nIf I were to be simple and yet possess knowledge,\nwalking the Great Dao,\nI would only fear **excess**.\n\nThose who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action, no contrivance,\nyet things transform naturally.\n\nNow, if I were simple yet possess knowledge while walking the Great Dao,\nI would have no contrivance or establishment,\nyet there would be that which is worthy of fear.\n\nThe Great Dao is most smooth,\nyet people love shortcuts.\nThe Great Dao is smooth and easy,\nwithout obstacles or perils,\nbut those who do not know it\nthink it circuitous and slow,\nand prefer shortcuts for quickness.\n\nThus, all who conform to their natural inclinations yet contrive,\nare but those who seek speed.\n\nThe court is ever adorned,\nthe fields ever overgrown,\nthe granaries ever empty.\nWearing fine embroidery,\nbearing sharp blades,\ndisdaining food,\nyet hoarding wealth—\nthis is called **empty display**.\n\nIs this not the Dao? No.\n\nThe vulgar crowd are bright and clear,\nI alone seem muddled and dim;」\n\nThe vulgar crowd are sharp and discerning,\nI alone am muddled and obscured.\nWhy then adorn the superficial and neglect the root,\nmerely contriving for empty display,\nboasting to deceive and steal?\n\n**Chapter 54: The Virtue of Firm Establishment**\nThose who establish virtue firmly are unshaken,\nthose who embrace it closely are not abandoned.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nDoes the world truly have those who establish yet are unshaken,\nor embrace yet are not abandoned?\nOnly the Sage knows the true nature of essence,\ndiscerns the falsehood of things,\nabandons external things to cultivate the self—\ntheir virtue accumulates and overflows,\nyet they establish nothing, and yet their foundation is unshaken;\nthey grasp nothing, and yet their embrace is unbroken.\nThus, even to their descendants,\nsacrifices never cease.\n\nCultivate the self, and virtue becomes true;\ncultivate the family, and virtue becomes abundant;\ncultivate the village, and virtue becomes enduring;\ncultivate the state, and virtue becomes flourishing;\ncultivate the world, and virtue becomes universal.\nOnce the self is cultivated,\nits overflow extends outward—\neven governing the world is possible.\n\nThus, observe the self to understand the self,\nobserve the family to understand the family,\nobserve the village to understand the village,\nobserve the state to understand the state,\nobserve the world to understand the world.\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nWhat lies beyond heaven and earth\nis unseen by the vulgar crowd,\nyet its principle can be inferred and known.\n\nWhen cultivation of the self reaches its peak,\nobserving the self to understand the self,\nobserving the family to understand the family,\nobserving the village to understand the village,\nobserving the state to understand the state—\nall are within my grasp.\nYet how do I know the Sage,\nobserving the world to understand the world,\ndoes not do so as I observe the self?\nWhy should the self be observed by the self,\nwhile the world cannot be observed by the world?\nThus it is said: *How do I know the world is thus? By this.*\nFor it is known through the self alone.\n\n**Chapter 55: The Depth of Contained Virtue**\nThe depth of contained virtue is like that of an infant.\nThough Laozi often likens morality to an infant,\nhe speaks only of its form,\nnot yet its function.\n\nNow, the infant is tranquil and without desire—\nits essence is complete.\nYet when things approach, it does not respond,\nso its function remains unspoken.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nferocious beasts do not seize,\neagles do not snatch.\nThe Dao is formless, unseen by things—\nhow much less can it be harmed?\n\nWhat makes humans susceptible to form\nis their having a mind.\nThus, with a mind comes form,\nwith form comes adversaries,\nand with adversaries comes injury.\n\nThe mindless have no adversaries—\nhow then can they be harmed?\n\nThe infant’s state is thus:\nbones weak, sinews soft, yet grip firm;\nunaware of sexual union, yet life arises—\nessence is at its peak.\nWithout grasping, yet naturally held,\nwithout desire, yet naturally formed—\nthus it is known that essence is abundant,\nnot of the mind.\n\nCrying all day yet never hoarse—\nharmony is complete.\nWhen the mind moves, qi is injured;\nwhen qi is injured, crying becomes hoarse.\nCrying all day yet never hoarse—\nthus it is known that the mind is undisturbed,\nand qi is in harmony.\n\nHarmony is called *constant*.\nHarmony means external things do not harm the internal.\n\nReturning to the original is called *constant*,\nencountering things yet knowing to revert to the root.\n\nHarmony is called *constant*,\nobtaining the original to respond to all things.\n\nThey are one principle—\nthus all are called *constant*.\n\nKnowing *constant* is called *clarity*,\nexcessive life is called *omen*—\nlife cannot be excessive,\nyet if one seeks to excess it,\nthis is not the right way.\nAn *omen* is a *portent*.\nForcing qi through the mind is called *strength*.\nQi resists unnatural movement,\nyet when the mind forces it,\nit becomes violently strong.\n\nWhen things are at their peak, they decline—\nthis is called *not the Way*,\nand *not the Way* decays early.\nForcing life exhausts qi,\nunable to let it follow its nature.\nEntering rigidity and strength,\naging follows—\nthus the infant’s nature is lost.\n\n**Chapter 56: The Wise Do Not Speak**\nThe wise do not speak,\nthose who speak are not wise.\n\n**Chapter 57: The Mysterious Unity**\n\nBlock its senses,\nclose its gates,\ndull its sharpness,\nuntangle its confusion,\nharmonize its brilliance,\nblend with its dust—\nthis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\n\nThe Dao cannot be spoken of,\nyet it is not apart from speech,\nbut those who know it may not speak,\nand those who speak may not know it.\n\nOnly by blocking the senses and closing the gates to shut out the external,\nby dulling sharpness, untangling confusion, harmonizing brilliance, and blending with dust to govern the internal,\ndoes one remain silent and align with the Dao.\n\nThus, it cannot be approached as close or distant,\ncannot be grasped as beneficial or harmful,\ncannot be esteemed as noble or base—\nand so it is held in highest honor by the world.\n\nIf it can be approached as close, it can be pushed away.\nIf it can be grasped as beneficial, it can be turned to harm.\nIf it can be esteemed as noble, it can be brought low.\n\nThose who embody the Dao cover all things equally—\nwho then is truly close or distant?\nThey observe reversals and顺 (*shùn*) impartially—\nwho then knows gain or loss?\nIgnorant of honor and disgrace—\nwho then distinguishes noble from base?\n\nThe mind’s schemes cannot fathom this—\nthus the world holds it in highest honor.\n\n**Chapter 58: Governing with the Rectified Way**\n\nGovern with the rectified Way,\nemploy the extraordinary in warfare,\nand take the world without action.\n\nThe ancient sages softened the distant while strengthening the near,\nhaving no intention of waging war—\nonly when unavoidable did they resort to arms.\nThus, governing the state is the rectified Way,\nwhile waging war is the extraordinary.\n\nYet even this is insufficient to take the world.\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be forced, for those who force it fail,\nand those who grasp it lose it.\nOnly those who embody the Dao stand effortlessly beyond action,\nand though they do not take the world, the world submits to them.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nWhen the world abounds in taboos, the people grow poorer;\nwhen the ruler multiplies taboos, the common voice cannot reach above—\nthus the people grow poor and without recourse.\n\nWhen the people wield sharp tools, the state grows confused;\nsharp tools are stratagems.\nWhen a wise ruler presides, he keeps the people in ignorance,\nso they know nothing and desire nothing.\n\nIf the people abound in stratagems, their ruler grows dazzled and confused.\nIf the people rely on cleverness, strange things proliferate—\nwhen people abandon their roots and chase after superficial gains,\nthen useless and harmful things arise.\n\nWhen laws multiply, thieves and robbers increase.\nDistrusting the deceit of people, rulers multiply laws to overcome them—\nthe people, with nowhere to turn, daily fall into thievery.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI do nothing, yet the people grow rich;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.*\n\n**Chapter 58 (continued): The Governance of Obscurity**\n\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure;\nwhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\n\nCalamity is the reverse of fortune,\nfortune is the foundation of calamity.\nWho knows their limits?\nThere is no fixed rectitude.\n\nRectitude becomes the extraordinary,\nthe good becomes the ominous—\nthe people’s confusion has long endured.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nyet the common view is dazzled and does not know.\n\nFortune leans on calamity,\ncalamity lurks within fortune—\nlike the succession of day and night, cold and heat.\n\nRectitude becoming the extraordinary,\nthe good becoming the ominous—\nlike the cycle of old and young, life and death,\nnever truly fixed—yet the confused do not know.\n\nOnly the sage stands beyond all things,\nsurveying their beginning and end,\ngrasping their completeness,\nabandoning petty scrutiny.\nTo the eye, governance appears obscure—\nyet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.\n\nAs for the common folk,\nthey know not the Dao’s full body,\ntaking what the ears and eyes perceive as ultimate.\nThey deem themselves fortunate,\nyet know not the calamity hidden behind;\nthey deem themselves good,\nyet know not the ominous arising within.\n\nNarrowly, they take scrutiny for clarity—\nwhen scrutiny is extreme,\nit harms things without realizing its error—\nhow pitiable!\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not wound,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nKnowing that petty scrutiny cannot exhaust things,\nthough capable of being square, upright, and bright,\nthey do not employ these abilities,\nfearing to fall into one-sidedness without return—\nthis is what the world calls *obscure governance*.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nOnly through frugality is early cultivation achieved.\nEarly cultivation is called *heavy accumulation of virtue*—\nheavy accumulation of virtue means nothing is unconquerable,\nnothing is unconquerable means its limits are unknown,\nand unknown limits mean one can possess a state.\n\nThe foundation of possessing a state,\nthis can endure long.\n\nAll things, when square, are cut;\nwhen sharp, they wound;\nwhen straight, they overreach;\nwhen bright, they dazzle.\n\nOnly the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not wound,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle—\nthis is called *sound*.\n\nSound is having without using.\nThe world’s affliction is its inability to subdue others—\nif one truly possesses *sound* and can embody it,\nthough never competing with others,\nothers know they cannot overcome it—\nthus they submit early.\n\nOnce they submit, their power is withdrawn,\nuntil death, never tested—\nthen virtue is heavily accumulated.\n\nWhen virtue is deeply accumulated,\neven the world’s strongest cannot conquer—\nthus none can measure its extent.\nOnly then can one possess a state.\n\nAs for the petty men of the world,\nthey wield even a finger’s power lightly—\nonce they fail to subdue, the world measures their depth and contests them.\nThough they wish to preserve their state,\nthey cannot.\n\nThus I know *sound* can bring possession of a state,\nand possession of a state is the mother of a state.\nThis is called *deep roots and firm foundations*—\nthe Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n*The Mencius* says:\n*Exhaust the heart, nurture the nature—\nthis is how one serves Heaven.*\n\n「To govern people through *sound* (Dao/Way),\nis what enables one to possess a state.\nTo serve Heaven through *sound*,\nis to establish *deep roots and firm foundations*—\n\nThe sages of antiquity\npreserved the constancy of their nature and life,\nnot wasting themselves on external matters.\nWithin, their roots are deep and cannot be uprooted,\ntheir foundations are firm and cannot be shaken—\nthus, even longevity and enduring vision are attainable.\n\nIndeed, governing people and serving Heaven,\nthough differing in internal and external aspects,\nare both ultimately unified in *sound*.\n\n---\n**Chapter LX of *The Treatise on Governing Great States***:\nTo govern a great state,\nis like cooking a small fish delicately.\nCooking a small fish delicately,\none must not disturb it;\ngoverning a great state,\none must not weary the people.\nTo weary them brings their exhaustion,\nto disturb brings the fish’s ruin.\nWhen the Dao/Way is applied to the world,\nits spirits are not *divinely powerful* (神).\n\nThe sage acts without action,\nletting people each find rest in their natural state.\nExternally, they seek nothing;\ninternally, they fear nothing—\nthus, none can intrude upon them.\nEven spirits have no need to display *divine power*.\n\nIt is not that the spirits are not *divinely powerful*,\nbut that their *divine power* does not harm people.\nIt is not that their *divine power* does not harm people,\nbut that the sage also does not harm people.\nIt is not that the spirits’ *divine power* is not *divinely powerful*,\nbut also that their *divine power* does not harm people.\n\nIt is not that the *divine power* does not harm people,\nbut that the sage has never harmed people—\nthus, spirits have no power to act.\n\nWhen two do not harm each other,\n*virtue* (德) and *spirit* (神) naturally return to one another.\nThe reason people and spirits do not harm each other,\nis that there is a sage above them—\nthus, *virtue* and *spirit* naturally return to one another.\n\n---\n**End

follows the low, and the world naturally turns to the great realm,\njust as all waters flow toward the lowlands.\nThe world’s confluence, the world’s *yin* (牝).\nThe *yin* always conquers the *yang* (牡) through stillness,\nand stillness is the path of the low.\nAll things in motion seek stillness,\njust as all high places descend to the low.\nThus, when the great realm follows the low of lesser realms, it takes them;\nwhen the lesser realm follows the low of the great realm, it is taken by them.\nIf the great realm follows the low, then lesser realms will attach to it;\nif the lesser realm follows the low, then the great realm will accept it.\nHence, sometimes one follows the low to take, sometimes one follows the low to be taken.\nThe great realm follows the low to take others,\nthe lesser realm follows the low to be taken by others.\nThe great realm seeks only to encompass and nurture all,\nthe lesser realm seeks only to enter and serve others.\nBoth attain what they desire,\nso the great realm should follow the low.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao is the Hidden Essence of All Things**\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things,\na treasure for the virtuous, a safeguard for the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold, noble deeds can be bestowed upon others.\nIf a person is unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?\nAll things that appear outwardly are but their thresholds and halls.\nThe Dao in things is like their hidden essence—\nevery thing possesses it, yet no one truly sees it.\nOnly the wise can grasp and hold it,\nhence it is called the treasure of the virtuous.\nThe foolish, though unable to possess it,\ncannot remain at peace without the Dao,\nhence it is called the safeguard of the unvirtuous.\nThe Dao is not distant from people,\nyet people often distance themselves from it.\nIf one truly speaks of the Dao’s beauty,\nit can be traded in the world;\nif one practices its noble ways,\nit can be bestowed upon others.\nMorning they act without righteousness,\nevening they hear the great Dao—\ntheir falsehoods exhausted, their nature restored,\nthough one might wish to point out their unvirtue,\nit cannot be found—\nand why should they be abandoned then?\nThus, to establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers,\neven with a jade tablet held before four thoroughbreds,\nit is not as good as simply sitting and offering this Dao.\nTo establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers\nis to save the people through the Dao.\nThough the jade tablet is precious and the thoroughbreds fine,\noffering them is not as beneficial as offering this Dao.\nThe ancients valued this Dao so highly,\nnot because they sought to gain it or to escape punishment through it,\nbut because it is the most noble for all under Heaven.\nThe Dao originates within us,\nyet people suffer from not seeking it—\nif they seek it, they will find it.\nThe Dao has no merit or fault,\nyet people suffer from not knowing it—\nif they know it, no fault can taint them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**\nTo act without action, to manage without managing, to savor without savoring.\nGreat or small, much or little—\nto repay resentment with *virtue*.\nThe sage acts without action,\nso there is nothing they cannot do;\nthey manage without managing,\nso there is nothing they cannot oversee;\nthey savor without savoring,\nso there is nothing they cannot appreciate.\nIn matters of greatness or smallness, abundance or scarcity,\nthey simply meet them with the Dao.\nWhat people cannot forget is resentment,\nyet when their love and hatred are forgotten,\neven repaying resentment is like repaying *virtue*.\nTo seek difficulty in what is easy,\nto see greatness in what is small—\nthe world’s most difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s greatest matters must arise from the minute.\nThus, the sage never seeks what is great,\nand so they achieve what is great.\nLight promises must be few,\nmany easy things bring many difficulties—\nso the sage considers what is difficult,\nand thus they never face difficulty.\nAll people fear what is great and scorn what is small,\nshun what is difficult and embrace what is easy.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before acting,\nor until things are great before pursuing them,\ntheir undertakings often fail.\nThe sage treats greatness and smallness equally,\nunifies abundance and scarcity,\nfears nothing, finds nothing difficult—\nhow could their undertakings ever fail?\nIts ease lies in its firmness—\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: Its Ease Lies in Its Firmness**\nIts ease lies in its firmness,\nits unseen potential lies in early planning,\nits fragility lies in its lightness,\nits subtlety lies in its dispersion.\nTo act before things arise,\nto govern before chaos comes.\nWhen things have not yet arisen,\nfirmness and planning suffice.\nWhen they are about to arise,\nonly lightness and dispersion can remove them—\nyet this is still better than when they are already formed.\nThus, acting before things arise is the highest,\ngoverning before chaos comes is the next best.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.\nThose who act will ruin it,\nthose who grasp will lose it—\nso the sage acts without action,\nand thus there is no ruin;\nthey grasp without holding,\nand thus there is no loss.\nThe coming of disorder, calamity, fortune, and misfortune\nare all like these three things.\nThe sage accumulates the small to achieve the great,\nholds firm without action,\nguards without grasping—\nsecretly letting roots grow of their own accord,\nletting calamity vanish on its own.\nLike planting seeds,\ndeeply tilling and richly fertilizing—\nwhen autumn comes, they flourish.\nLike being robbed,\nsitting calmly and watching keenly—\nthe thief will soon retreat.\nThe people of the world do not understand the natural order of things,\nbelieving that nothing is accomplished without action,\nnothing is retained without grasping—\nso they constantly vie with calamity for victory,\nstruggle with fortune for excess#1,\nand thus calamity arrives when it cannot be saved,\nfortune arrives when it cannot be completed—\nthis is the natural consequence of their ways.\nThe people’s undertakings often succeed when they are just beginning,\nthen fail when they are nearly complete.\nTo be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\nThe sage knows the harm of action,\ndoes not aid Heaven by forcing outcomes,\nand from beginning to end follows what is natural—\nso there is nothing they cannot complete.\nThe people’s hearts dwell on gain and loss,\nand even when their undertakings are still slight,\nthey have those who do not know and let them follow their own nature—\nbut when they see things almost formed,\nthey fear loss and ruin them—\nthere has never been one who did not consider this a failure.\nHence it is said: *To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,*\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\nThus the sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth;\nthey study without studying,\nreturn to the errors of the common people.\nTo assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nand never dare to act.\nAll people follow what they praise to harm things,\nbelieve what they learn to harm principle.\n\nThe sage is not without praise,\nbut praises without desiring—\nthus though joyous, they do not harm the **Dao/Way** of things.\n\nThey are not without learning,\nbut learn without learning—\nthus though learned, they do not harm the **principle**.\n\nThen within and without, they are empty and clear,\nboundless and without action,\nable to assist the **natural unfolding of all things**,\nand await their own completion.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Sage as Way**\nThe ancient sage who excelled in the **Dao/Way**,\nwas not to enlighten the people,\nbut rather to bewilder them.\n\nThe so-called wise of old,\ngrasped the **completeness of the Dao/Way**,\nand surveyed the **beginning and end of all things**—\nthus they were truly honored.\n\nCommon folk cannot know this,\nand are drowned in petty cleverness,\ntaking scrutiny for enlightenment—\nthus the harm of their wisdom is manifold.\n\nTherefore the sage governs the people with the **Dao/Way**,\nnot to enlighten them,\nbut rather to bewilder them.\n\nThey make them without knowing, without desiring,\nand let them follow the **ruler’s** actions—\nthough there may be faults, they are slight.\n\nThe people know that they are hard to govern,\nbecause their wisdom is too great.\n\nThus to govern with wisdom is to rob the state;\nI use wisdom to guide the people,\nand the people also use wisdom to counter me—\nthen ruler and subjects mutually rob each other.\n\nNot to govern with wisdom is the state’s blessing.\n\nKnowing these two points,\nis the **standard model**.\n\nTo know the **standard model**,\nis called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.\n\n**Mysterious Virtue/Power** is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nthen alone does it reach **Great Harmony**.\n\nWhat I value is **virtue/power**,\nwhat things blame is wisdom—\n**Virtue/power** and wisdom are inherently opposed,\nyet wisdom follows what is small,\nwhile **virtue/power** follows what is great.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Ruler of All Things**\nThe reason the **river and sea** can be the **ruler of all valleys**,\nis that they excel in **yielding**—\nthus they can be the **ruler of all valleys**.\n\nTherefore the sage desires to be above others,\nby letting their words **yield**;\ndesires to lead others,\nby placing themselves behind.\n\nThe sage does not **force** themselves above others,\nnor **desire** to lead them—\nthey **yield** and **step back**,\nand thus their **Dao/Way** naturally rises and leads.\n\nTherefore when they are above, others do not grow weary;\nwhen they are before, others are not harmed.\nThus the world gladly follows them without growing tired,\nfor they do not **contend**,\nand so none in the world can **contend** with them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: The World’s Judgment**\nThe world all says my **Dao/Way** is great,\nyet seems unfit.\n\nOnly because it is great,\ndoes it seem unfit.\n\nIf it were fit for long,\nits subtleties would be exhausted.\nThe **Dao/Way** is vast and formless,\ndecayed and nameless,\npervading all things,\nyet not resembling any one thing—\nthis is why it is great.\n\nIf it resembles things,\nthen it is but one thing—\nhow can it be great?\n\nI have three treasures,\nwhich I preserve and uphold:\nOne is **compassion**,\ntwo is **frugality**,\nthree is **not daring to act before the world**.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is great because it does not resemble things,\nso when it flows into **virtue/power**,\nit is also **obscured**—\nusing **dullness** as sharpness,\nusing **retreat** as advancement,\nnot conforming to worldly conventions.\n\nNow the worldly values boldness,\nprizes vastness,\nboasts swift progress,\nwhile what I treasure is **compassion, forbearance, frugality, modesty, contentment, and retreat**.\n\nThese three are what the world calls unfit.\n\n**Compassion** is why one can be **courageous**;\nThe world ranks **courage** as secondary virtue,\nand considers **compassion and forbearance** as insufficient for action—\nthey do not know that **courage** ranked second is easily broken,\nwhile **compassion and forbearance** are invincible—\nin the end, they must return to **compassion**.\n\n**Frugality** is why one can be **vast**;\nThe world values **vastness** as covering all things,\nand considers **restraint and modesty** as vulgar—\nthey do not know that **vastness** is easily exhausted,\nwhile **frugality and modesty** are easily sufficient—\nin the end, they must return to **vastness**.\n\n**Not daring to act before the world** is why one can become **instrumental and long-lasting**;\nThe world regards **swift progress** as capable,\nand considers **not daring to lead** as shameful—\nthey do not know that **swift progress** harms many,\nwhile **not daring to lead** brings joy to the world—\nin the end, they must finally become **instrumental and long-lasting**.\n\nFrom the **primordial simplicity** scattering, things become **instruments**;\nThe sage employs them, and they become **officials and leaders**.\nSince the **primordial simplicity** becomes **instruments**,\nthere are those who belong to them and those who lead them.\n\nNow if one abandons **compassion** for **courage**,\nabandons **frugality** for **vastness**,\nabandons **retreat** for **leadership**—\ndeath follows.\n\n**Courage, vastness, leadership**—\nthese three are what all people detest.\n\nTo be detested by all,\nis to always be near death.\n\n**Compassion**—\nwhen wielded in war, it wins;\nwhen used in defense, it holds firm.\nWhen heaven intends to save them,\nit shields them with **compassion**.\nWith **compassion** to guide things,\nthings love them as their own parents—\nthey will even die for them without hesitation,\nthus they can wage war and defend.\nWhen heaven intends to save this person,\nit opens their heart and mind,\nmakes them **compassionate toward all**,\n**compassionate toward all**—\nthen all things will guard them.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Eight: The Virtuous Scholar**\nThe virtuous scholar does not **wield force**;\nScholars should take **force** as their foundation**,\nbut act with **timidity**—\nif they act with **force** in **force**, they will die.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not **rage**;\nThe sage fights only when unavoidable—\nif they fight out of **rage**, it is because I would kill others.\n\nKilling others because I would kill them.\n\nThe skilled victor does not **contend**;\nBecause I do not **contend**,\nI can overcome their **contention**.\nIf all arise from **contention**,\nthen victory is not certain.\n\nThe skilled user of people places them below.\nAll people have the heart to **rise above others**,\nso none can truly **use others**.\nIf one can truly **place them below**,\nthen all under heaven will **use me**.\n\nThis is called the **virtue/power of non-contention**,\nThis is called the **force of using people**,\nThis is called **aligning with Heaven’s ancient extreme**.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Nine: The Art of War**\nIn the art of war, there is a saying:\nI do not dare to be the **host** but be the **guest**;\nThe **host** is the one who **initiates conflict**,\nThe **guest** is the one who **responds to conflict**.\n\nI do not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot;\nAdvancing is to have **intent to contend**,\nRetreating is to have **no intent to contend**.\n\nThis is called **action without action**;\nWithout **intent to contend**,\neven when wielding arms,\nit is equal to not wielding them.\n\n「Repel without arms, yet have no foes;\nSeize without weapons.\nIf there is no intent to contend,\nthen even when in the military,\nit is as though there were no arms to repel,\nno foes to exploit,\nno weapons to wield—\nhow then could there be fault in wielding arms?\n\nNo calamity is greater than underestimating an enemy;\none who underestimates an enemy nearly loses his **virtue/power**.\nThe Sage treasures **virtue/power** as his **treasure**—\nto underestimate an enemy is to underestimate battle,\nto underestimate battle is to underestimate killing,\nand thus he loses what constitutes his **virtue/power**.\n\nWhen armies clash,\nthe first to act is victorious.\nWhen two enemies clash,\nand I act only out of necessity,\nthen I have **compassion**.\nWhen **compassion** is shown,\nHeaven and humanity aid me—\neven if I wish not to be victorious,\nit cannot be avoided.\n\n**Chapter Seventy: The Ease of My Words**\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\nYet none under heaven can know them,\nnone can practice them.\n\nThe **Dao** is vast—\nto restore one’s **nature** is sufficient.\nYet the subtlety of **nature** is seen\nin one’s daily actions, eating, and drinking.\n\nThe Sage points to this and shows it to people—\nhow could it not be easy to know?\nIf one can embody this to respond to things,\nhow could it not be easy to practice?\n\nYet the world often suffers from ignorance in daily life,\nnot knowing it—\nand even if they know, they cannot practice it,\nlet alone act upon it.\n\nWords have their **root**,\naffairs have their **master**.\nOnly the ignorant fail to recognize me.\nWords are the **trap** of the **Dao**,\naffairs are the **traces** of the **Dao**.\nIf the **Dao** could be fully expressed in words,\nthen listening to words would suffice;\nif it could be fully seen in affairs,\nthen examining affairs would suffice.\nBut since words cannot exhaust it,\nand affairs cannot reveal it,\none must abandon words to seek their **root**,\nand abandon affairs to seek their **master**—\notherwise, it cannot be attained.\n\nTruly, the ancient Sages\nhad no thought, no action,\nyet a **mysterious stillness** remained within them,\nunaware of itself—\nthis is beyond the reach of thought and deliberation,\nand thus none truly know me.\n\nFew know me,\nso I am precious.\nWhat the masses can know\nis not worth treasuring.\n\nThus the Sage wears coarse cloth while holding **jewel-like virtue**.\nThe Sage appears outwardly like others,\nyet inwardly is entirely different.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown—\nthis is **supreme**;」\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: Knowing the Unknown**\n\nTo know that one does not know—this is **illness**.\nThe Dao cannot be reached by thought and deliberation,\nso it cannot be grasped.\nYet when one does not yet know,\nthere is no way to enter without knowing.\nBut once one knows and clings to that knowing,\nthen knowing becomes **illness**.\nThus, knowing while not knowing is **supreme**,\nwhile not knowing while knowing is **illness**.\n\nOnly by **disease of disease** does one avoid disease.\nIt cannot be both unknown and known—\nonly by knowing that knowing is **illness**\ndoes the disease, over time, depart.\nThe Sage does not fall ill,\nfor by **disease of disease**, one does not fall ill.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two: The People Do Not Fear Authority**\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nthen **great authority** will arise.\nAuthority is inherent in nature—\nelevated, luminous, vast, and resplendent,\nsoaring beyond all things—\nthis is what is called **great authority**.\n\nYet people are drowned in the crowd,\nfearfully clinging to life and death,\ndreading gain and loss.\nThe authority of all things presses upon them,\nand they tremble their whole lives long,\nnever at ease—\nthough **great authority** stands before them,\nthey do not perceive it.\n\nIf one truly knows this,\nand equalizes life and death,\ngain and loss,\nthen, serene and unafraid,\n**great authority** shines forth.\n\nDo not confine your dwelling,\ndo not weary of your life.\nOnly by not wearying\ndoes one not weary.\nNature’s grandeur\ncan embrace heaven and earth.\nYet those who do not know\nclutch their limbs and orifices as their own,\nhoarding them without wearying.\nThus, their vision does not extend beyond sight,\ntheir hearing does not extend beyond sound—\nhow narrow and meager they are!\nTherefore, it is taught: *Do not confine your dwelling.*\n\nThose who know\nrealize the vastness of nature and the narrowness of life,\nyet grow discontent, longing to escape but unable—\nunaware that their discontent and longing\nare bound by things.\nThus, it is taught: *Do not weary of your life.*\n\nOnly the Sage\ndoes not confine nor weary,\nsharing life with others\nwhile dwelling with the Dao,\nbeyond distinctions of broad or narrow, pure or impure.\nHaving no weariness of life,\none then knows that life cannot be wearying.\n\nThus the Sage\nknows himself but does not display himself,\nloves himself but does not exalt himself—\nlest others harbor weariness or longing.\nAs long as weariness and longing remain,\nfear lingers.\nOnly when fear departs\ndoes **great authority** manifest.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three: Courage in Daring**\nCourage in daring leads to death,\ncourage in not daring leads to life—\nboth may bring gain or harm.\nWhat the heavens abhor—\nwho can fathom their reason?\nThus even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nCourage in daring brings death,\ncourage in not daring brings life—\nthis is the great constant of things.\nYet sometimes the daring live,\nsometimes the timid die,\nand the world, relying on chance,\noverlooks the constant principle.\n\nThe heavens’ ways are distant—\nwho knows where their likes and dislikes originate?\nThus even the Sage takes the constant as true,\nyet still hesitates over daring.\n\nLiezi said:\n*\"To welcome the heavens’ intent,\nto weigh gain and harm—\nthis is not as good as letting be.\"*\n\nThe difficulty of the heavens’ ways\nis why they are laid out in detail.\n\nThe Dao of the heavens\nconquers without contending—\nnot contending with things at a single moment,\nyet assured of ultimate victory.\nIt responds without speaking—\nhow could the heavens speak?\nThe seasons pass in their course,\nall things arise from it—\nnever has there been a request unanswered.\nIt summons without calling—\nthe divine response is beyond measure.\nHow much more so to summon by number?\nWho could call it?\n\nYet it plans with ease.\nLeisurely and relaxed,\nas if pursuing nothing,\nyet its plans surpass all others.\n\nThe heavenly net is vast—\nthough sparse, it loses nothing.\nThe world, observing the heavens with ears and eyes,\nsees only a curve and misses the whole.\nSome prosper through goodness, others suffer through evil—\nhow could one not doubt the net’s sparseness and its losses?\nOnly by grasping its beginning and end,\nand exhausting its transformations,\ndoes one know its vastness—\nthough sparse, it loses nothing.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Four: The People Do Not Fear Death**\nThe people do not ordinarily fear death—\nhow can you frighten them with death?\nWhen governance is burdensome and punishments heavy,\nthe people have no recourse—\nthey do not fear death,\nand even if you threaten them with death,\nit avails nothing.\n\nIf you make the people constantly fear death,\nand punish those who act strangely,\nI will seize and kill them—\nwho would dare?\nWhen the people are at ease under governance,\nconstantly cherishing life and fearing death,\nthen seizing those who deceive and disrupt the order to kill them—\nwho would not submit?\n\nThere are always those who execute the killing.\nThe executor of killing—\nthis is the heavens.\nWhen the world is well-ordered,\nand deceivers disrupt the order,\nthey are abandoned by the heavens.\nIf the heavens abandon them and I kill them,\nthen it is the heavens who kill them,\nnot I.\n\nTo act as the executor of killing\nis to usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment.\nTo usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment\nrarely fails to injure one’s hands.\nTo kill those not abandoned by the heavens\nis to act as the executor of killing—\nto usurp the Great Carpenter’s judgment,\nthen one’s hands are injured;\nto act as the executor of killing,\nthen one’s own life is endangered.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Five: The People’s Hunger**\nThe people’s hunger\ncomes from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThe people’s difficulty in being governed\ncomes from their rulers’ excessive actions.\nWhen rulers guide the people with their own actions,\nthe people respond in kind—\nthus, affairs multiply and governance becomes difficult.\n\nPeople grow indifferent to death\nbecause life’s abundance makes them so.\nWhen rulers prioritize profit and desire over the people,\nthe people compete to thicken their own lives—\nthus, even in death, they relentlessly seek gain.\n\nOnly those who do not use life as a means\nare superior to those who value life dearly.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Way of Life**\nThe extreme reverence for life\nleads to indifference toward death.\nOnly those who do not use life as a means\nare those whose life is naturally preserved.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six: The People’s Way of Life**\nThe people’s way of life is soft and yielding when they live,\nbut hard and strong when they die.\nAll things—grasses and trees—are soft and yielding when they live,\nbut withered and brittle when they die.\nThus, the hard and strong are the companions of death,\nwhile the soft and yielding are the companions of life.\nIf **Daoist** *qi* is present within them,\nthen their bodies will know no ailment of hardness and strength;\nif **Daoist** *principle* is present within them,\nthen their affairs will bear no burden of hardness and strength.\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nfor armies conquer through righteousness, not mere strength;\nif strong yet unrighteous, their defeat will be swift.\n\nStrong trees are felled.\nWood, once it reaches the height of its bowing branches,\nmust be cut down.\nThe strong are placed below,\nthe soft and yielding above.\nThe natural order of things:\nthe refined is above, the coarse below.\nThe refined must be soft and yielding,\nthe coarse must be strong and mighty.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven: The Dao of Heaven**\nHeaven’s Dao—\nis it not like drawing a bow?\nWhen a bow is drawn, its upper back bends;\nwhen it is released, its upper angle rises—\nthus, Heaven is likened to suppressing the high and elevating the low.\nThe high are suppressed,\nthe low are raised,\nthose with excess are diminished,\nthose lacking are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Dao: diminishes excess and supplements deficiency;\nhuman Dao is otherwise: diminishes deficiency to honor excess.\nHeaven acts without partiality,\nthus it is balanced;\nhumans act with partiality,\nthus they are unbalanced.\nWho can diminish excess to benefit all under Heaven?\nOnly those who follow the Dao.\nThose who follow the Dao give to all without complaint,\nand the more they give, the more they possess;\nthe more they bestow, the more they have.\nNone but those who follow the Dao can bear this.\nHence, the Sage acts but does not claim credit,\nachieves but does not dwell upon it—\nfor he does not wish to be seen as virtuous.\nIf he acts yet relies upon it,\nand achieves yet dwells upon it,\nthen he will be seen as virtuous in the world.\nWhen he is seen as virtuous in the world,\nthis is the act of honoring excess with himself.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight: The Softness of All Under Heaven**\nNothing under Heaven is softer or weaker than water,\nyet nothing can surpass it in overcoming hardness and strength—\nits power cannot be replaced.\nThus, softness overcomes hardness,\nweakness overcomes strength—\nall under Heaven knows this,\nyet few can practice it.\nHence, the Sage says:\nTo bear the filth of the state,\nthis is called the steward of the soil and grain;\nto bear the ill omens of the state,\nthis is called the ruler of all under Heaven.\nRight speech as if reversed.\nRight speech aligns with the Dao yet opposes common custom,\nfor the common folk regard bearing filth as shame,\nand bearing ill omens as calamity.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine: Reconciling Great Grievances**\nTo reconcile great grievances,\nthere must always be lingering resentment—\nhow can this be considered good?\nGrievances arise from delusion,\nand delusion stems from human nature.\nThose who understand human nature\ndo not see delusion manifest,\nand thus, what grievance is there?\nNow, if one does not remove the root,\nyet seeks to reconcile the branches,\nthen though the surface may seem reconciled,\nthe resentment within remains unvanquished.\nHence, the Sage holds the left half of the contract,\nand does not demand it of others.\nThus, those with **virtue/power** oversee the contract,\nwhile those without oversee it to its end.\nThe contract’s left and right halves\nare meant to establish trust and deter disputes.\nThe Sage shares this human nature with all,\nyet people regard delusion as the norm,\nand indulge in the field of contention and rivalry,\nunaware that their nature has never truly diminished.\nHence, the Sage reveals their nature to others,\nurging them to remove delusion and return to their true nature.\nWhen delusion is exhausted and true nature restored,\nnone fail to find themselves in harmony,\nlike the right half of the contract meeting the left—\nno demand is needed before the service is fulfilled.\nYet even with great grievances and lingering resentments,\nthey will melt away like ice in spring,\nknowing that their root was never truly present—\nwhy then use reconciliation?\nThose without **virtue/power**,\nwho wish to make all conform,\nwill only labor in vain.\n\nLaozi was born in the declining Zhou, when culture flourished yet customs decayed, and sought to remedy this with *wuwei* (non-action). Thus, at the end of his book, he expresses his aspiration—wishing to test his vision in a realm of *xiaoguo guamin* (small states, few people)—though such a place was unattainable.\n\nLet the people possess tenfold or hundredfold tools yet not employ them. Let each abide in their allotted station, then even those in modest villages will not seek to serve the world. The tenfold or hundredfold tools refer to those whose wealth suffices to support a superior of ten, hundred, or thousand households. Though carriages and chariots exist, there will be none to ride them; though armor and weapons exist, there will be none to array them. Let the people return to knotted cords for their needs. With few demands and simple folk, even knotted cords suffice.\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyous. With inner sufficiency and no external cravings, they will regard what they possess as beauty and their dwelling as delight, seeking nothing further. Neighboring lands lie in sight, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between them, yet the people will pass their days to old age without visiting one another. When the multitude of things and people do not vie for one another, each finds sufficiency in themselves.\n\n**Chapter 80: \"The Blind Do Not Admire Beauty\"**\n*\"True speech is not adorned; adorned speech is not true.*\nTrue speech is substance alone—no need for embellishment.\nAdorned speech is mere spectacle—no need for truth.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nPrioritizing virtue, one need not prove oneself.\nPrioritizing argument, one may not be virtuous.\nThe wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.\nWith one thread to bind all, there is no need for vast learning.\nTo study and grow daily does not guarantee the Dao.\nThe Sage accumulates nothing—\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess;\nThe more they bestow, the more they have.\n\nThe Sage holds fast to *One* alone, accumulating nothing else.\nYet they deploy their abilities for others,\nextend their possessions to others—\nWhen others are exhausted but *One* remains inexhaustible,\nthen one knows the value of *One*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\nWhat can benefit may also harm;\nWhat can act may also contend.\nYet the Sage, though capable of benefit and harm, never harms;\nThough capable of action and contention, never contends—\nThus, Heaven and the Sage surpass all others,\nbecoming the root from which all things stem.\n\nAll this is what Laozi wrote and the broad outline of his Dao.\nHence, he reiterates it at the book’s close.\n\n---\n**Annotations in Original Text:**\n#1 *\"争\"* (contend) originally *\"生\"* (life), corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n#2 *\"以勇决\"* (with bold resolve) originally *\"之\"*, corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n#3 *\"愈多\"* (ever more abundant) originally *\"与多\"*, corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n\n**Postscript by Su Shi of Elline Hill (Mountain of Bamboo):**\nAt forty-two years of age, I was exiled to Junzhou.\n\nThe state of Jun may be small, yet it boasts many ancient Buddhist monasteries, where monks from all directions gather.\n\nThere was a Daoist named Quanzhen residing on Mount Huangman, the grandson of Nan Gong. His conduct was noble and his mind profound, and he took pleasure in conversing with me on the Dao. I told him:\n\n*\"What you speak of, I have already found in the Confucian texts.\"*\n\nQuanzhen replied: *\"This is the Buddha’s teaching—how could a Confucian have attained it?\"*\n\nI said: *\"Not so. I have heard the Dao, which Confucians do not possess—why forcefully accuse them of it? Truly, it exists, though the world knows it not.\"*\n\nQuanzhen pressed: *\"The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is as vast as that between the Hu and Han peoples—how then do you claim to know it? Speak briefly of its essence.\"*\n\nI answered: *\"The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote *The Doctrine of the Mean*. Within it, he says:\n\n*'Before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is called the *zhong* [centrality].\nWhen they arise yet remain measured, this is called *he* [harmony].\n*Zhong* is the great root of all under Heaven;\n*He* is the universal Way of all under Heaven.\nTo attain *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth find their place, and all things flourish.\nIs this not the Buddha’s teaching? Only the path of discourse differs.'\"*\n\nQuanzhen asked: *\"How do you explain this?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"The Sixth Patriarch said: ‘Do not dwell on goodness, nor dwell on evil—only then do you glimpse your original face. Since the Sixth Patriarch, half of those who attained enlightenment through these words have done so.’*\n\nWhat is meant by ‘not dwelling on goodness, nor dwelling on evil’ is precisely the state where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen.\n\nIndeed, *zhong* [centrality] is but another name for the Buddha-nature;\nwhile *he* [harmony] encompasses the six perfections and myriad practices.\n\nTo attain the utmost *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth take their place, and all things flourish within—what else could this be but the Buddha’s teaching?\n\nQuanzhen, astonished and delighted, exclaimed: *\"I never knew this before! Only now do I realize that Confucianism and Buddhism are one in essence.\"*\n\nI laughed and said: *\"Not so. Though there is but one Way under Heaven, the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and subject, parent and child, without ritual and law, there is only chaos. To know ritual and law yet ignore the Way—that is the common scholar, unworthy of praise.\n\nTo dwell in mountains and forests, eating coarse food and drinking from streams, yet harboring the supreme Dao—one might become a teacher of gods and humans. But to govern the world with such a path would bring disorder.\n\nThe ancient sages held the Dao in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they succeed.\"*\n\nQuanzhen bowed in reverence and said: *\"This is profound discourse!\"*\n\nAt that time, I was expounding the *Laozi*, and whenever I completed a chapter, I showed it to Quanzhen. He would always sigh and say: *\"All of this is the Buddha’s teaching.\"*\n\nI stayed in Jun for five years before returning north. Quanzhen passed away not long after. Twenty years have now passed since then.\n\nWhenever I revised *The Explanation of the Laozi*, I never found anything that did not align with the Buddha’s teaching.\n\nSince there are no others with whom I can converse, I long to see Quanzhen again to show him these words, so I have appended them to the end of *The Laozi*.\n\nWritten on the tenth day of the twelfth month, the second year of the *Daguan* era, by Zi Xiang.",

Explanation*).*\n**Author:** Su Xie of the Song Dynasty.\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (Canon of the Orthodox Daoist Tradition), *Dongshen* (Cavernous Gods) Section, *Yujue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n**Collation Reference:** *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed *Baoyan Tang* Secret Summer Edition (hereafter, *Baoyan Edition*).\n\n---\n\n**Volume One: Commentary by Su Xie of Lishan**\n\n**Chapter 1: *Dao That Can Be Spoken***\n\nThe *Dao* that can be spoken of is not the eternal *Dao*.\nIt is not that it is not the *Dao*—\nYet what can be spoken of cannot be eternal.\nOnly what cannot be spoken of can be eternal.\n\nNow, *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (rites), and *zhi* (wisdom) are the *Dao* that can be spoken of.\nYet *ren* cannot be made into *yi*, nor can *li* be made into *zhi*.\nThus, what can be spoken of cannot be eternal in this way.\n\nOnly what cannot be spoken of—\nThen *ren* is *ren*, *yi* is *yi*, *li* is *li*, and *zhi* is *zhi*.\nThese are all transient, yet the *Dao* remains eternal and unchanging.\nThus, what cannot be spoken of can be eternal in this way.\n\nWhat can be named is not the eternal Name.\nThe *Dao* cannot be spoken of—how much less can it be named?\nAll names are of what can be spoken of.\nOnce names are established, then the distinctions of round and square, curved and straight cannot be eternal.\n\nThe Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nThe Named is the mother of all things.\nEternal Non-being, to observe its subtlety;\nEternal Being, to observe its limits.\n\nFrom the Nameless, form arises as Heaven and Earth;\nHeaven and Earth take their place, and names begin to be established.\nFrom the Named, it spreads into all things;\nAll things are nurtured, and names cannot be exhausted.\n\nThus, the Nameless is the essence of the *Dao*,\nAnd the Named is its manifestation.\n\nThe Sage embodies the *Dao* for the use of the world,\nEntering all things while remaining in Non-being,\nThus observing its subtlety.\nEmbodying the utmost Non-being while remaining in Being,\nThus observing its limits.\n\nIf one acts within its limits but does not know its subtlety,\nThen it is coarse and not divine.\nIf one lingers in its subtlety but does not know its manifestation,\nThen it is refined yet not pervasive.\n\nThese two are of the same origin but different names,\nBoth called *xuan* (mysterious).\nSpeaking in terms of form, there is Being and Non-being—\nTruly two.\n\nHow do we know that Non-being transforms into Being,\nAnd Being returns to Non-being?\nIt has never ceased to be one.\n\nThough their names differ, their source is one.\nKnowing the source as one, then it is *xuan*.\nThe further one goes without reaching an extreme,\nThe deeper its hue of *xuan*—\nThus Laozi often uses *xuan* to express the ultimate.\n\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan*—the gateway to all subtleties.\nSpeaking of *xuan* is to reach it,\nYet still the thought of *xuan* lingers.\n*Xuan* beyond *xuan* is exhausted—\nNo more can be added—\nThe origin of all subtleties.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 2: *All Under Heaven Know***\n\nAll under Heaven know beauty as beauty—then it is ugliness;\nAll know goodness as goodness—then it is not goodness.\n\nThus, Being and Non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low contrast each other,\nSounds harmonize with each other,\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nAll under Heaven speak of beauty and goodness in terms of form and name—\nWhat they call beautiful and good—\nHow can it truly be beautiful and good?\n\nThey do not know that Being and Non-being, difficulty and ease, long and short, high and low, sounds and sequence\nGenerate and counter each other—\nAll are not their true nature.\n\nJust as one may consider oneself long,\nYet one longer than oneself appears—then one is short.\nJust as one may consider oneself foremost,\nYet one who precedes appears—then one is last.\n\nIf one follows what is deemed beautiful and believes it,\nThen one is far from the truth.\n\nThus, the Sage acts in Non-action,\nTeaches through Non-speech.\nWhen acting, the intention is Non-action;\nWhen teaching, the intent is Non-speech.\n\nThus, transcending the measures of long and short,\nSeparating from the numbers of before and after,\nNeither beautiful nor ugly,\nNeither good nor not-good—\nThen how can all under Heaven know it?\n\nAll things arise without refusal,\nAre born without possession,\nAct without reliance,\nAnd when accomplished, do not dwell upon it.\n\nAll things act for me, yet I refuse nothing.\nI give birth to them, yet never possess them,\nNever rely upon them.\nWhen success is achieved, I do not claim it.\n\nThis is the reward of Non-action and Non-speech—\nHow could it be ugly or not-good?\n\nOnly because one does not dwell upon it,\nDoes it not depart.\nThe Sage dwells in poverty and lowliness without their burdens,\nDwells in wealth and honor without their encumbrances—\nThis is called *not dwelling*.\n\nIf I do not dwell upon it, how could others depart?\nThis is the ultimate dwelling.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 3: *Not Holding Exalted the Virtuous***\n\nNot holding the virtuous in high esteem, so the people do not contend;\nNot treasuring difficult-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the heart does not become disordered.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties the mind, fills the belly,\nWeakens the will, strengthens the bones.\n\nIf one holds the virtuous in high esteem,\nThe people will be ashamed of not being like them and thus contend.\nIf one treasures difficult-to-obtain goods,\nThe people will suffer from not having them and thus steal.\nIf one displays what is desirable,\nThe people will be troubled by not obtaining it and thus become disordered.\n\nThough all under Heaven know these three as means of rest,\nYet if they seek to implement and abolish them, they are confused.\n\nThe Sage is not thus.\nHe has never failed to use the virtuous—\nOnly he does not hold them in high esteem.\nHe has never abandoned difficult-to-obtain goods—\nOnly he does not treasure them.\nHe has never removed what is desirable—\nOnly he does not display it.\n\nThus, the virtuous are employed, yet the people do not contend;\nDifficult-to-obtain goods and desirable matters are presented before them,\nYet theft and chaos do not arise—\nIs this not emptying the mind without harming the belly’s fullness,\nWeakening the will without harming the bones’ strength?",

      "translated_text": "Now if one promotes the virtuous and holds them in high esteem,\nTreasures goods and values them highly,\nDisplays what is desirable to the people,\nThen both the mind and the belly are filled.\n\nIf one implements and abolishes them,\nThen both will and bones are weakened.\nWhen the mind and belly are both filled,\nThe people will contend.\nWhen will and bones are both weakened,\nThere will be no means to stand.\n\nAlways keep the people ignorant and desireless,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nIf one does not display these three things,\nThen the people will not know what to covet,\nAnd their desires will be tranquil—\nEven the wise will have no clever schemes to employ.\n\nTo act without action,\nThen nothing will remain untamed.\n\nTo follow the natural course of these three things\nWithout esteeming, valuing, or displaying them—\nThis is called *acting without action*.\n\n**Chapter Four: The Dao is Unfathomable**\nThe Dao is unfathomable yet employed,\nSometimes appearing not full,\nDeep like the source of all things.\n\nThe Dao is unfathomable, reaching the void,\nYet with it, all things exist—\nThough heaven and earth are vast,\nMountains and rivers wide,\nIt pervades them all without form,\nThus appearing not full.\nDeep and boundless,\nI know it as the origin of all things,\nYet dare not speak of it directly,\nSo it is called *seemingly the origin of all things*.\n\nDull its sharpness,\nUntangle its complications,\nBlend its brilliance,\nAlign with its dust—\nCalm and tranquil, as if it might exist.\nAll people possess the Dao,\nYet the Sage preserves it whole.\n\nDull its sharpness, lest it stray into recklessness.\nUntangle its complications, lest it clash with things.\nNot straying into recklessness, not clashing with things,\nExternal harm removed, and brightness arises—\nThen harmonize it, lest it differ from things.\nBrightness is purity, dust is obscurity—\nThough dust may align, fear it would abandon all things.\nThus, only then is it preserved,\nCalm and ever-present—\nThough present, none recognize it,\nHence *seemingly it might exist*.\n\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Sovereign.\nThough the Dao is ever-present,\nNone can name it—\nYet it cannot be said to be nonexistent,\nSo it is asked: *Is this not what precedes the Sovereign?*\nIf it precedes the Sovereign and yet precedes the Sovereign,\nThen none can precede it.\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Are Not Benevolent**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nThey treat all things as sacrificial dogs;\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nThey treat the people as sacrificial dogs.\n\nHeaven and Earth have no favoritism,\nYet allow all things to follow their nature—\nThus things spontaneously live and die.\nDeath is not their cruelty,\nLife is not their benevolence.\n\nLike binding straw to make a dog,\nSet before sacrifices,\nAdorned with utmost reverence—\nYet not out of love,\nBut merely the proper time.\nWhen the rites are done, it is discarded,\nTrampled by passersby—\nYet not out of hatred,\nBut merely the proper time.\n\nSo too the Sage treats the people:\nOnly by not harming them\nDo they preserve their nature.\nLife and death, gain and loss—\nI have no part in them.\nThough I have never been benevolent,\nBenevolence is vast.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nWhat is it but the bellows and the bellows-key?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nThe bellows and the bellows-key—\nWhen they move, the breath they send forth\nSweeps all before it.\nThe unknowing take it for the pinnacle of craft,\nYet what do the bellows and the bellows-key truly do?\nThey are empty yet unyielding,\nThus when they move, they ever produce.\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nTheir way of giving life and death to all things,\nCarving and shaping all forms—\nIs no different.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the central way.\nSeeing it move yet produce,\nThe unknowing fail to grasp its response from emptiness,\nThus I tell them: *Much speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to hold to the central way, which knows no exhaustion.*\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\nThe Valley is supremely empty yet still has form,\nThe Valley Spirit is empty yet formless.\nEmpty yet formless,\nHow could there be birth, let alone death?\nIt is called the Valley Spirit,\nSpeaking of its virtue.\nIt is called the Mysterious Feminine,\nSpeaking of its function.\n\nThe Feminine gives birth to all things,\nYet is called Mysterious—\nFor though it gives birth, its method is unseen.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine\nIs called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine,\nFor all things emerge from it.\nThe Root of Heaven and Earth,\nFor heaven and earth emerge from it.\n\nEnduring yet subtle,\nUsed without exhaustion.\nEnduring—unceasing yet unbroken.\nSubtle—present yet unseen.\nIf one can be thus,\nEven if used all day, there is no labor.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth Endure Long**\nHeaven and Earth endure long—\nThough vast, they do not depart from form and number,\nThus their endurance has measure.\nYet Laozi speaks of endurance reaching heaven and earth,\nMerely from what people see.\n\nIf endurance reaches its utmost,\nThen it is the beginning of heaven and earth.\nHeaven and Earth endure long\nBecause they do not generate themselves,\nThus they endure.\nTherefore the Sage places himself last,\nYet is first;\nSets himself outside,\nYet is preserved.\nIs it not because he has no self-interest?\nThus he fulfills his self-interest.\n\nHeaven and Earth give birth to things yet do not generate themselves,\nStanding outside all things,\nThus they endure.\nThe Sage places himself last yet serves others,\nSets himself outside yet benefits others,\nStanding beyond all people,\nThus he is first and preserved.\n\nIf heaven and earth competed with things for life,\nAnd the Sage contended with people for gain,\nThen heaven and earth would be but one thing,\nThe Sage but one person—\nHow could they surpass others?\n\nThough so, their lack of self-interest\nIs not to seek fulfillment of self-interest,\nYet self-interest fulfills the Dao—\nThus it is so.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Supreme Good Is Like Water**\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people dislike it,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nOne yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\nTo follow it is good,\nTo complete it is nature.",

virtue,\nNone surpass this—\nThus it is called the \"supreme good.\"\n\n居善地，心善渊，与善仁，一黄善信，政善治，事善能，动善时。\nDwelling in virtue’s humble ground,\nMind in virtue’s profound depths,\nGiving in virtue’s boundless kindness,\nUnifying in virtue’s trustworthy truth,\nGovernance in virtue’s harmonious order,\nAction in virtue’s transformative capacity,\nMovement in virtue’s timely

virtue that does not escape human censure\nIs born of contention.\n\n水惟不争，故兼七善而无尤。\nWater, through non-contention,\nEmbraces the seven virtues without blame.\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Yet Fulfilling (持而盈之)**\nHolding yet fulfilling,\nBetter than forcing completion;\nPlucking yet sharpening,\nBetter than enduring loss.\n\nKnowing that fullness must overflow,\nYet striving to hold it firm,\nBetter to let it not be full—\nThen stability is assured.\n\nKnowing that sharpness must break,\nYet plucking to hasten it,\nBetter to let it not be sharp—\nThen reliance is not bound to certainty.\n\nIf the Sage possesses yet does not cling,\nHow could there be excess?\nFollowing nature, then acting,\nHow could there be haste?\n\nWithout excess, there is no need to hold,\nWithout haste, there is no need to pluck.\n\nGold and jade fill the halls,\nYet none can keep them safe;\nWealth and honor bring arrogance,\nYet they invite their own ruin.\n\nWhen merit is complete,\nName is achieved,\nBody withdraws—\nThis is the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nAt high noon, the sun must shift,\nWhen the moon is full, it wanes—\nThe cycles of the four seasons,\nMerit complete, departs.\n\nHeaven and earth do so,\nHow much more so humanity?\n\n**Chapter Ten: Nurturing Spirit and Substance (载营魄)**\nNurturing spirit and substance,\nEmbracing unity—can separation be avoided?\n\nSubstance differs from spirit,\nFor substance is matter, spirit is essence.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\n*Qi* congeals to form matter,\nSpirit wanders to bring transformation—\nThus one knows the nature of ghosts and gods.\n\nSubstance, as matter, is mixed yet fixed;\nSpirit, as essence, is singular yet ever-changing.\nTo speak of nurturing spirit and substance,\nIt is to speak of their stillness.\n\nThe Dao is everywhere,\nIn humanity, it is nature—\nAnd nature’s subtlety is spirit.\n\nWhen pure and unmixed, it is called unity;\nWhen gathered yet not dispersed, it is called substance—\nBoth return to the Dao,\nEach following its own truth.\n\nThe Sage’s nature is settled,\nSpirit is congealed,\nNot swayed by things.\nThough substance is his dwelling,\nSpirit moves as it wills,\nAnd substance follows without fail—\nThus spirit ever nurtures substance.\n\nThe common folk let things enslave their nature,\nSpirit is dimmed, ungoverned,\nAnd substance commands.\nEyes and ears are dulled by sounds and colors,\nNose and mouth are exhausted by scents and flavors—\nSubstance moves as it desires,\nAnd spirit follows—\nThus substance ever nurtures spirit.\n\nHence the teaching of nurturing spirit and substance,\nSo the two never part—\nThis is the Sage’s essential method for cultivating the self.\n\nAs for the ancient *True Persons*,\nDeep-rooted, firm-founded,\nLong-lived, ever-visioned—\nTheir Dao also comes from this.\n\nFocusing *qi* to achieve softness,\nCan one be like an infant?\n\nWhen spirit is ungoverned, *qi* is disordered—\nThe strong delight in fighting,\nThe weak delight in fear,\nUnaware of themselves.\n\nWhen spirit is governed, *qi* does not act recklessly—\nJoy and anger follow their kind—\nThis is called focusing *qi*,\nThe utmost of spirit’s emptiness,\nThe beginning of *qi*’s substance.\n\nAt its emptiest, it is softness;\nAt its most substantial, it is rigidity—\nPure nature, devoid of *qi*,\nThis is called achieving softness.\n\nThe infant knows not good or evil,\nThus its nature is whole.\n\nWhole nature, with *qi* refined,\nRefined *qi*, with body soft—\nFocusing *qi* to achieve softness,\nCan one reach the infant’s utmost?\n\nCleansing and transcending,\nCan one be without blemish?\n\nThe Sage externally is not enslaved by substance,\nInternally is not ruled by *qi*—\nThus all dust and defilement are cleansed.\n\nThen its spirit is bright and clear,\nTranscending all things,\nKnowing they all arise from nature,\nEqually observing purity and impurity,\nWithout blemish or flaw.\n\nLoving the people, governing the state,\nCan one act without doing?\n\nHaving cultivated the self,\nThen extending to others.\nEven in loving the people, governing the state,\nOne meets them with a heartless heart.\n\nIf one has a heart,\nThen loving the people brings harm,\nAnd governing the state brings disorder.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Gate of Heaven Opens and Closes (天门开阖)**\nThe gate of heaven opens and shuts—\nCan one be like the female?\n\nThe gate of heaven refers to\nThe source of governance, chaos, ruin, and flourishing.\n\nHaving taken the body as the world’s burden,\nWhen opening and shutting, gathering and dispersing,\nThe common folk prize gain yet fear loss,\nThus they act in advance to court fortune.\n\nThe Sage follows nature and knows the Mandate of Heaven,\nThus he waits for the lead before harmonizing.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nTo precede Heaven yet not defy it,\nIs not to precede Heaven;\nTo follow Heaven yet still conform to its time,\nIs not to follow Heaven.\n\nIt speaks of always meeting Heaven’s Mandate,\nWhether before or after—\nThis is all.\n\nOtherwise, the early must hasten,\nThe late must falter,\nBoth lose the way.\n\nThus to say \"can one be like the female\"\nIs to say \"one must not lose the time.\"\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Clarity and Fourfold Reach (明白四达)**\nClarity and fourfold reach—\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nInternally cultivating the self,\nExternally governing the state,\nEven in facing change,\nNever lacking the Dao—\nHow could this not be clarity and fourfold reach?\n\nClarity and fourfold reach are the heart,\nThe heart knows nothing—\nYet it never has a heart that knows.\n\nThe heart is singular—\nIf again there is one that knows,\nThen it is two.",

flavors,\nTheir source all arises from *nature* (性),\nWhen it has *nature* yet lacks *things* (物),\nThis is the utmost.\n\nWhen the eyes feast on the five colors,\nThe ears feast on the five tones,\nThe mouth feasts on the five flavors,\nThey are robbed by what they feast upon and forget their source,\nThen though they see, they are truly blind;\nThough they hear, they are truly deaf;\nThough they taste, they are truly dulled.\n\nChasing through fields and hunts makes the heart go mad,\nRare treasures make one’s conduct falter.\nThus the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes,\nAnd so discards that to take this.\n\nThe Sage sees colors, hears tones, and tastes flavors,\nAll as others do.\nAs for chasing through fields and hunts,\nHe has never failed to do them,\nYet rare treasures he has never failed to reject.\nYet people all take this as illness,\nWhile the Sage alone takes it as blessing—why?\nThe Sage acts for the belly, while the common folk act for the eyes;\nThe eyes are blamed yet cannot accept,\nThe belly accepts yet is never blamed—this is why.\n\nThat which comes from without is external,\nThis which is *nature* congealing within is internal.\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation**\nHonor and humiliation are like a startling fright,\nTreating great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nThe ancient *Dao* masters (达人),\nTreated honor as they did humiliation—startling,\nKnew that honor as humiliation comes first.\nThey valued their own body as they did great calamity,\nKnew that their own body as the root of calamity.\nThus they abandoned honor so humiliation did not reach them,\nAnd lost their own body so calamity did not come.\n\nWhat is meant by “honor and humiliation”?\nHumiliation is the lower,\nGaining it is like a startling fright,\nLosing it is like a startling fright—\nThis is what is meant by “honor and humiliation as startling fright.”\n\nSo-called honor and humiliation are not two separate things,\nHumiliation arises from honor yet the world does not know,\nThose who take honor as the higher and humiliation as the lower—all are such.\nIf one knows humiliation arises from honor,\nThen honor is truly the lower.\n\nThus the ancient *Dao* masters,\nGained honor as though it were a startling fright,\nLost honor as though it were a startling fright,\nNever settled in honor while fearing humiliation.\n\nSo-called “startling fright” is not true fright,\nIt is only *as if* startling—this is all.\n\nWhat is meant by “treating great calamity as one’s own body”?\nIt is because of my having a body that I have great calamity,\nAnd when I lack a body, what great calamity have I?\n“Treating” means “difficult to bear.”\nThe root of great calamity is having a body,\nYet the scholars of the world find it difficult to bear great calamity,\nNot difficult to bear their own bodies.\nThus the Sage, seeing their difficulty in bearing calamity,\nTeaches them that it is difficult to bear having a body,\nKnowing that having a body is the difficulty,\nThen great calamity departs.\n\n*Nature* (性) in relation to man,\nLife cannot add to it, death cannot diminish it;\nIts vastness can fill heaven and earth,\nIts subtlety can traverse water and fire, enter metal and stone—\nNo thing can exhaust it.\n\nYet the world always exhausts and loses its original *nature*,\nAnd only the body is seen,\nThe love for the body is deep,\nThen only can things exhaust it.\n\nThe changes of life and death, sickness and disease attack from within,\nThe alternations of honor and humiliation, gain and loss assail from without—\nNot a single thing that is not calamity.\n\nOnly the *Dao* masters know that *nature* is unbroken,\nAnd the body is not real;\nSuddenly forgetting the body,\nAll exhaustion of the world departs,\nThen one can traverse the world without burden.\n\nThus to treat the body as the world,\nAs though one could entrust the world to it;\nTo love the body as the world,\nAs though one could commit the world to it.\n\nWhy men chase after power and wealth,\nDrown in riches and honor,\nAnd commit offenses without repentance—\nAll are but to thicken their own bodies.\nNow if one bestows the world upon them,\nAnd weighs it heavily with the body’s burden,\nThen their forgetting of the body is complete.\nIn this way, if one gives them the world,\nThough the world be vast,\nThey cannot take it as calamity.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Unseen**\nThat which is seen yet unseen is called *equanimity* (夷),\nThat which is heard yet unheard is called *rare* (希),\nThat which is grasped yet unobtainable is called *subtle* (微).\nThese three cannot be summoned or invited,\nThus they return and blend into one.\n\nWhat is seen yet seen—colors,\nThat which allows colors to be seen—the unseen.\nWhat is heard yet heard—sounds,\nThat which allows sounds to be heard—the unheard.\nWhat is grasped yet obtained—tactile things,\nThat which allows tactile things to be obtained—the unobtainable.\nThese three,\nThough wise men cannot question them,\nMust blend and return to one,\nThen only can it be so.\n\nSo-called “one”—*nature* (性).\nThe three—*nature*’s functions.\nMan begins with *nature* alone,\nAnd when it interacts with *things*,\nThen it splits and disperses,\nBecomes seeing, hearing, and touching,\nDaily used yet unaware of returning to its source—\nIf not blending and returning to one,\nThen it grows ever more distant.\n\nIf one extends this reasoning further,\nThen the Buddhist teaching of the six sense-gates is the same.\nThe *Lengyan Sutra* (首楞严)

*yang*,\nThus above they shine, below they dim,\nAnd cannot escape.\n\nThe *Dao* though above does not shine,\nThough below does not dim,\nCannot be traced by form or number.\nTaut and unbroken, it cannot be named,\nThus it returns to *non-things* (无物).\nTaut and unbroken—\nMoving yet never ceasing.\n\nMen see its moving yet never ceasing,\nThen they think there are things,\nYet do not know it finally returns to *non-being* (无).\nThis is called the *form* of *formlessness*,\nThe *image* of *imagelessness*—\nThis is called *dimly vague* (惚恍).\n*Form*—its manifestation,\n*Image*—its subtlety.\nThe *form* of *formlessness*,\nThe *image* of *imagelessness*—\nAll are not *non-being*.\nHaving *being* and *non-being* cannot be named,\nThus it is called *dimly vague*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head,\nFollow it and you see no tail.\nThe *Dao* is nowhere not present,\nThus it has no head or tail that can be seen.\n\nTo grasp ancient *Dao* and apply it to present *things*,\nTo

oneself.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Master of Conduct**\n\nThe ancient master of conduct was subtle, profound, and penetrating—\nDeep beyond recognition.\nCoarse understanding exhausted, the subtle remains;\nThe subtle exhausted, the wondrous appears;\nThe wondrous exhausted, the *Dao* emerges—\nAnd the *Dao* is all-pervasive, yet deep beyond recognition.\n\nOnly because it is beyond recognition,\nDo we force it into semblance:\n**Cautious as winter crossing a river.**\nTo be cautious before acting is called *cautious*—\nWhat one intends to do, like being pressed before responding,\nCautious as one crossing a river in winter, moving with reluctance,\nAs if there were no alternative.\n\n**Hesitant as fearing neighbors,**\nDoubtful and thus not acting is called *hesitant*—\nWhat one does not desire, delayed and resisted,\nHesitant as one fearing neighbors’ judgment.\n\n**Dignified as if in reverence,**\nRespectful in all things, never negligent.\n\n**Dissolved as ice about to melt,**\nKnowing all *things* arise from illusion,\nNever clinging to anything.\n\n**Unadorned as if crude,**\nArtifice exhausted, returning to nature.\n\n**Vast as a valley,**\nEmpty yet receptive to all.\n\n**Turbulent as mud.**\nDulling its brilliance,\nBlending with dust,\nNot differing from *things*.\n\nWho can settle mud by stillness and gradually clarify?\nWho can, by enduring stillness, gradually bring forth movement?\n\nCommon scholars let *things* overwhelm their nature,\nThus they remain muddied and never clarify.\nWithered scholars, through rigid stillness, extinguish their nature,\nThus they remain stagnant and never revive.\n\nNow knowing mud disrupts nature,\nWe still it—stillness gradually clarifies it.\nKnowing extinction of nature is not the *Dao*,\nWe move it—movement gradually revives it.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Motionless yet not inactive,\nResponding and thus harmonizing with all under Heaven.\"*\n\nWhat is called *movement* here is just so.\n\nThose who preserve this *Dao* do not seek fullness.\nFullness arises from excess,\nMuddied and unable to clarify,\nStagnant and unable to revive—\nThis is why one must not be full.\n\nOnly because one is not full,\nCan one be worn without renewal.\nAll *things* inevitably wear out.\nOnly because one is not full,\nDoes wear depart on its own without renewal.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Ultimate Void**\n\nAttain the ultimate void,\nGuard stillness with sincerity.\nIf the void is not ultimate,\nSome *being* remains.\nIf stillness is not sincere,\nSome movement remains.\n\nThough hills and mountains may recede,\nFine dust still lingers—\nThis is not yet ultimate or sincere.\n\nTo attain the void while preserving the void,\nIs still not free of *being*;\nTo guard stillness while preserving stillness,\nIs still entangled in movement—\nHow much more so for others?\n\nWithout ultimacy or sincerity,\nYet demanding the use of void and stillness—\nThis is difficult.\n\nAll *things* arise together,\nI observe their return.\nWith ultimate void and sincere stillness,\nI observe the transformations of *things*,\nOnly then am I not disturbed by change.\n\nKnowing all actions inevitably return,\nIf I were now to act with all *things*,\nI would be unfit to know them.\n\n*Things* teem and return to their roots.\nAll *things* arise from nature,\nAll return to nature—\nLike flowers and leaves growing from roots and returning to roots,\nLike waves arising from water and returning to water.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness.\nIf one cannot return to nature on their own,\nEven halting movement and ceasing thought to seek stillness—\nThis is not stillness.\n\nOnly returning to the root is true stillness.\nStillness is called *restoring the vital command*.\nThe *command*—the subtlest aspect of nature.\nNature can still be spoken of,\nBut the *command* cannot be spoken of.\n\nThe *Classic of Changes* says:\n*\"Exhaust reason, fulfill nature, and reach the *command*.\"*\n\nThe sage’s study of the *Dao*\nMust begin with exhausting reason,\nProceed with fulfilling nature,\nAnd end with restoring the *command*.\n\nRitual and music—\nThe sage’s means of engaging with *things*—\nYet their application must have its basis.\nNot knowing the basis,\nYet following their names—\nThis is the common scholar.\n\nKnowing the basis and then acting—\nThis is the noble.\n\nThis is called *exhausting reason*.\nThough one exhausts the mind to exhaust reason and thus attain it,\nWithout seeking, it cannot be obtained.\n\n*Things* daily construct themselves before one,\nOne must seek and then respond—\nThus the effort is laborious,\nYet the achievement is slight.\n\nThe sage is not obscured by externals,\nHis nature is serene—\nWithout striving, yet centered;\nWithout thought, yet attaining;\nWhen *things* arrive, he responds—\nThis is called *fulfilling nature*.\n\nYet this is still *my* nature,\nStill entangled in the distinction of self and other,\nAlmost deluded.\n\nThe ruler’s *command* is *command*,\nHeaven’s *command* is *command*—\nEngaging with *things* through nature,\nYet unaware of its source in me—\nThus it is entrusted to the *command*.\n\nThis is called *restoring the command*.\nRestoring the *command* is constancy.\nWhen it acts,\nEven Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—\nNothing does not transform and decay.\n\nOnly by returning to nature\nDoes constancy abide serene.\n\nKnowing constancy is enlightenment.\nIf one does not take returning to nature as enlightenment,\nThen all is the common scholar’s cleverness—\nThough they claim enlightenment,\nIt is not true enlightenment.\n\nIgnorant of constancy, they act recklessly—disaster.\nIgnorant of returning to nature,\nThey cling to *things* and move—\nNo action is without disaster.\nThough they may succeed in the moment,\nThey lose in the long run.\n\nKnowing constancy, one is tolerant.\nWhen lost in illusion,\nThey insist on their own right,\nOthers are all enemies—\nHow can they tolerate them?\nIf one knows all is illusion,\nEven enemies—\nOne pities and spares them—\nHow can they not tolerate all?\n\nTolerance is impartiality.\nWithout tolerance, no impartiality—\nWho remains private?\n\nImpartiality is sovereignty.\nWithout impartiality, no sovereignty—\nWho would the world

world,\nWho would not govern all things with the Dao?\n\nYet the people of the world are insufficient to know the root of the Sage’s wisdom,\nBut they see only its branches,\nAnd take it for cleverness in overcoming things.\nThus they race along its superficial currents,\nAnd the people begin to suffer its harm beyond measure.\n\nTherefore, discard the Sage and abandon wisdom,\nAnd the people’s benefit increases a hundredfold.\n\nDiscard virtue and abandon righteousness,\nAnd the people return to filial piety and kindness.\nThere has never been one who practiced virtue and abandoned their parents,\nNor one who upheld righteousness and delayed serving their lord—\nVirtue and righteousness are what make filial piety and kindness possible.\n\nYet when they decline,\nThey steal the names of virtue and righteousness to gain advantage in the world,\nAnd thus sons defy their fathers,\nAnd fathers cruelly mistreat their sons—\nThis is the result of the traces of virtue and righteousness.\n\nTherefore, discard virtue and abandon righteousness,\nAnd the people return to filial piety and kindness.\n\nDiscard cleverness and abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\nCleverness is what facilitates affairs,\nProfit is what aids things—\nThese two are not for thievery; if thieves and robbers cannot succeed, they will not act.\n\nTherefore, discard cleverness and abandon profit,\nAnd thieves and robbers will cease to exist.\n\nThese three things are insufficient for cultivation,\nSo they must be assigned their proper place.\nSeeing simplicity and embracing purity,\nFew desires and little self-interest.\n\nThe world values these three things,\nYet it believes the world’s unrest comes from their insufficiency.\nThus some attribute them to the Sage’s wisdom,\nSome to virtue and righteousness,\nSome to cleverness and profit—\nAll seeking to govern with them.\n\nYet the world grows ever more unstable—\nWhy not return to their roots?\n\nSee simplicity, embrace purity,\nFew desires and little self-interest,\nAnd the people will each return to their true nature.\nEven with these three things, there will be no need for them.\n\nThus it is said:\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people become upright;\nI meddle in nothing, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.\nThis is the greatness of the Sage’s wisdom,\nThe utmost of virtue and righteousness,\nThe extreme of cleverness and profit.\n\nYet Confucius governed the world with virtue, righteousness, ritual, and music,\nWhile Laozi discarded and abandoned them—\nSome may say they differed.\n\n*The Classic of Changes* says:\nThat which is above form is called the Dao,\nThat which is below form is called instrumentality.\nConfucius’ foresight for posterity was profound,\nSo he showed people instrumentality while concealing the Dao,\nCausing the mediocre and below to cling to instrumentality,\nSo they would not be dazzled by the Dao,\nAnd thus not lose their way as gentlemen,\nWhile those above the mediocre would naturally ascend to it.\n\nLaozi was not so.\nHe was intent on clarifying the Dao and urgently sought to open people’s minds,\nSo he showed people the Dao while slighting instrumentality,\nBelieving that if scholars only knew instrumentality,\nThe Dao would remain hidden.\nThus he discarded virtue and righteousness,\nAbandoned ritual and music,\nTo clarify the Dao.\n\nThe Dao cannot be spoken—\nAll speech is but its semblance.\nThe enlightened discern the true through its semblance,\nWhile the ignorant cling to the semblance and fall into deception.\n\nThus in later ages, those who seized Laozi’s words to disrupt the world existed,\nYet those who followed Confucius committed no great errors.\nThose who reached the Dao through Laozi’s words were many,\nWhile those who sought it in Confucius often struggled to find an entrance.\n\nThese two sages were both constrained—\nTo preserve one, they must neglect the other.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Discarding Learning and Having No Worry**\n\nDiscard learning and have no worry.\n\nTo study is to daily increase,\nTo follow the Dao is to daily diminish.\nNot knowing the true nature of life and destiny,\nYet seeking benefit through study,\nAccumulating what one has not heard,\nPiling it endlessly without unifying it,\nThen the round harms the square,\nThe straight harms the curved—\nThe mind becomes chaotic,\nAnd worry knows no end.\n\nAlas, that scholars should reach this point!\nThus it is said: Discard learning and have no worry.\n\nYet the Sage never ceased learning,\nBut took the Dao as primary.\nNot learning does not mean little learning,\nMuch learning does not mean confusion—\nSerene and without worry,\nWhy speak of discarding learning?\n\nYes and no—\nHow far apart are they?\nGood and evil—\nHow different are they?\n\nScholars drown in what they have heard,\nUnable to unify it,\nSo they take \"yes\" as respectful\nAnd \"no\" as arrogance—\nAlready beyond comparison,\nMuch less the opposite extremes of good and evil!\n\nThe Sage knows all things arise from nature,\nYet all are formed by delusion—\nLike drawing horses and oxen,\nOr carving tigers and leopards,\nNone are their true forms.\nPitifully, there is no distinction of right and wrong, same and different—\nWho knows how far apart they truly are?\n\nIf one knows this,\nThen all things coexist without harm,\nThe Dao proceeds without contradiction—\nNothing strange in

flexible yet complete,\nCrooked yet straight,\nHollow yet full,\nWorn yet renewed,\nLittle yet sufficient—\nAll are consequences of holding unity,\nThus it concludes with \"holding unity.\"\n\nNot

reflected itself,\nThey would have no time to see or reflect others.\nThus, not self-revealing, not self-asserting, not self-praising, not self-exalting—\nAll are aspects of not striving,\nThus it concludes with \"not striving.\"\n\nThe ancients spoke of \"flexible yet complete\"—\nWas this mere empty talk?\nIndeed, it is complete and returns to its source.\n\nThe world deems straightness as

aligned with virtue gain virtue,\nThose aligned with loss gain loss.\n\nThose aligned with the Dao obtain the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue obtain virtue,\nThose aligned with loss obtain loss.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"If one’s resolve is in ren, there is no evil.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The errors of the virtuous are easily forgiven.\"*\n\nIf resolve in ren is thus,\nHow much more so for those resolved in the Dao?\n\nIf one truly follows the Dao,\nThen what aligns with the Dao yields the Dao,\nWhat aligns with virtue yields virtue,\nAnd though misfortune may come,\nEven in loss, one gains in virtue and power.\n\nFaith insufficient, doubt arises.\nThe unknowing, lacking firm trust in the Dao,\nWhen they falter, they doubt it further,\nThus their unbelief grows.\n\nOnly the knowing do not let gain or loss shake their trust in the Dao.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Limping Do Not Stand**\n\nThe limping cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk.\nThose who self-display see nothing,\nThose who self-approve are unillustrious,\nThose who self-praise achieve nothing,\nThose who self-glorify do not endure.\n\nNo one fails to both stand and walk,\nYet if one deems standing insufficient and adds limping,\nOr walking insufficient and adds striding,\nNone can retain their standing or walking.\n\nSo too with those who self-display, self-approve, self-praise, and self-glorify—\nThey are but excess, like superfluous food or burdensome limbs.\n\nAs with eating and drinking,\nModeration suffices,\nExcess brings sickness.\nAs with the four limbs,\nWholeness suffices,\nSuperfluity becomes a hindrance.\n\nSome may detest this,\nThus the Dao is shunned by many.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: The Undifferentiated Whole**\n\nThere is a whole undifferentiated,\nBorn before heaven and earth.\n\nThe Dao is neither clear nor turbid,\nNeither high nor low,\nNeither departing nor arriving,\nNeither good nor evil—\nYet it forms a unity,\nIn humans, this is nature.\nThus it is said: *There is a whole undifferentiated.*\n\nNone know its origin,\nYet it exists silently and eternally,\nAnd from it, heaven and earth arise.\n\nSilent and vast,\nIndependent yet unchanging,\nCirculating yet unexhausted,\nIt may be called the Mother of all beneath heaven.\n\nSilent, without sound,\nVast, without form,\nIndependent, without rival,\nYet never failing in all things—\nDescending, it nurtures all creatures,\nThus it is their Mother.\n\nI know not its name,\nSo I call it the Dao.\nForcing a name upon it, I say: *Great.*\n\nThe Dao originally has no name,\nYet the Sage saw that all things arise from it,\nThus named it the Dao.\nSeeing that none can surpass it,\nThus forced the name *Great* upon it.\nYet truly, it cannot be named.\n\nGreat is fleeting,\nFleeting is distant,\nDistant is returning.\nSeeking it from Greatness, it flees and departs.\nSeeking it from departure, it is distant and unattainable.\nThough it flees and is distant,\nYet seeking it in return,\nA single-minded heart suffices.\n\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nAnd the Sage is Great.\nWithin the realm, there are four Great ones,\nAnd the Sage occupies one.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models the Dao,\nThe Dao models nature.\n\nSpeaking of the Dao,\nEven Heaven, Earth, and the Sage\nAre not as Great as it.\n\nYet the world knows the Greatness of these three,\nBut does not believe in the Dao’s Greatness.\nThus, speaking truly:\nHumans are not as great as Earth,\nEarth is not as great as Heaven,\nHeaven is not as great as the Dao,\nThe Dao is not as great as nature.\n\nYet if one were to recover their original nature in a day,\nThen these three, humans could fully embody them.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Heavy as Root of the Light**\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe still is the master of the restless.\n\nAll things—light cannot bear heavy,\nSmall cannot govern great,\nThe unmoving directs the moving,\nThe still controls the active.\nThus the light relies on the heavy as root,\nThe restless on the still as master.\n\nHence the Sage, though traveling all day,\nNever strays from his baggage.\nThough adorned with fine carriages,\nHe rests in quietude.\n\nTo walk lightly yet not abandon one’s baggage,\nTo enjoy splendor yet return to repose—\nThus the necessity of the heavy and the still is shown.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself for the world?\n\nIf the ruler burdens himself with the world\nYet lightens his own body,\nHe cannot bear the world.\n\nLightness loses subjects,\nRestlessness loses sovereignty.\nLightness and restlessness have no place to apply,\nYet if the ruler is light, his subjects know they cannot rely on him,\nIf his subjects are restless, he knows they seek only gain—\nThus it is said: *Lightness loses subjects, restlessness loses sovereignty.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: The Good Way Leaves No Tracks**\n\nThe good way leaves no tracks,\nIt rides the natural and thus leaves none.\nThe good speech has no flaws,\nIt speaks only when timely,\nThus its words fill the world without error.\nThe good plan requires no calculations,\nAll things’ numbers lie before it,\nKnown without reckoning—what need for calculations?\n\nThe good closure needs no bars yet cannot be opened,\nThe good binding needs no cords yet cannot be undone.\n\nThe fully virtuous toward all things\nAre like a mother to her children—\nThough they roam, they do not stray,\nThus no bars are needed yet it is closed,\nNo cords are needed yet it is bound.\n\nThus the Sage always rescues people,\nSo none are abandoned;\nAlways rescues things,\nSo none are discarded.\nThose who cling to calculations to plan,\nSet bars to close,\nHold cords to bind—\nTheir reach is limited.\n\nThe Sage toward people\nNot only tolerates them,\nBut rescues them.\nIf I do not abandon people,\nHow can people fail to return to me?",

of the **good person**.\nIf one does not **esteem their teacher**,\nNor **cherish their means**,\nThen the Sage acts without attachment to teaching,\nAnd thus the world acts without reverence for the Sage.\nThe Sage not only **forgets the world**,\nBut also **makes the world forget him**—\nThough **wise yet deeply confused**,\nThis is called **the utmost subtlety**.\nThe subtlety of the Sage\nIs such that even the wise cannot fully grasp it.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Knowing the Heroic**\n\nTo **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to become the **valley** of the world.\nTo become the **valley** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** never departs,\nAnd returns to the **baby-like** state.\n\nTo **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to become the **model** of the world.\nTo become the **model** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** does not **compel**,\nAnd returns to the **boundless** state.\n\nTo **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to become the **receptacle** of the world.\nTo become the **receptacle** of the world, one’s **constant virtue** is then **sufficient**,\nAnd returns to **simplicity**.\n\nThe **Heroic** and **Feminine** are what comes before and after to me.\nThe **White** and **Black** are what comes as light and dark to me.\n**Honor** and **Humiliation** are what comes as nobility and lowliness to me.\n\nTo **love what comes before** and **hate what comes after**,\nTo **love the light** and **hate the dark**,\nTo **love nobility** and **hate lowliness**—\nThis is the nature of things.\n\nYet what comes before and after to me\nIs not as pressing as what comes as light and dark;\nWhat comes as light and dark to me\nIs not as deep as what comes as nobility and lowliness.\n\nThe ancient **Sages** discarded illusion to seek **recovery of their true nature**,\nAnd the clearer their **true nature** became,\nThe lower their **holding** was,\nThe thicker their **virtue** grew,\nAnd the greater their **return** was.\n\nTo **not act** when one does not **know** is not as profound as\nTo **know yet not act**—this is the utmost.\n\nTo **know the Heroic** and **hold to the Feminine** is to **know true nature**.\nTo **know true nature** and **cease striving with the heart**,\nThen all who seek to **prevail in the world’s strife**\nWill gather to it, like water flowing to a **valley**,\nNone will depart.\n\nThough it is like the **baby-like** state—able to **receive** yet not yet able to **use**—\nThus it is said: **\"return to the baby-like state.\"**\n\nTo **know the White** and **hold to the Black** is to **see true nature**.\nTo **dwell in darkness** yet **perceive the light**,\nThen all who are **clear in the world**\nWill be unable to **escape with their forms**—\nThus the multitude **follows the model** as their **law**,\nThough it **responds to all things**,\nThe **law** never strays,\nThe **use** never exhausts—\nThus it is said: **\"return to the boundless state.\"**\n\nTo **know Honor** and **hold to Humiliation** is to **recover true nature**.\nWhen all illusions are exhausted,\nTo **abide in humiliation** without resentment,\nVast as the emptiness of a **valley**,\nThings come and **respond to it**,\n**Virtue** is sufficient here,\nPure **true nature** without admixture—\nThus it is said: **\"return to simplicity.\"**\n\n**Simplicity** dispersed becomes **vessels**,\nThe Sage **uses it** and it becomes **officials and leaders**,\nThus great **laws** are not **severed**.\nThe Sage, having **returned to simplicity**,\nAgain **disperses simplicity** into **vessels**,\nTo **respond to all things**.\n\nLike a **ruler** dividing governance to establish **officials and leaders**,\nIt is also **following the natural course of things**,\nThough **laws** are set, there is no **forcible division**.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Chapter of Taking the World**\n\nWhen one is about to **take the world** and do so,\nI see that it is **not inevitable**.\nThe Sage’s **possession of the world** is not **taking** it,\nBut all things **return to him**—\nHe **receives it** without inevitability.\n\nHis **governance of the world** is not **doing** it,\nBut **following the natural course of all things**,\nAnd **removing their harm** alone.\nIf one **desires to take** and **does so**,\nThen it cannot be **obtained**.\n\nThe world is a **divine vessel**,\n**Unforced**—it cannot be **done**.\nThe **doer** ruins it,\nThe **holder** loses it.\nAll things are **unforced**—\nThough there be **a hundred people gathered**,\nIf they do not **follow their own nature** and **act** inappropriately,\nThere will be **disputes** and **unsubmissive** ones,\nAnd how much more so the world?\n\nThough small things may **few in number**,\nThere are some that can be **taken by force** or **won by cunning**,\nBut as for the world’s vastness,\nThere is a **divine master** within it—\nIf one does not **await its own return**,\nIt will **rebel**;\nIf one does not **listen to its own governance**,\nIt will **become chaotic**.\n\nAll things either **move** or **follow**,\nAre either **molded** or **shaped**,\nAre either **strengthened** or **weakened**,\nAre either **borne** or **broken**.\nThus the Sage **discards excess**, **discards extravagance**, **discards overreach**.\n\n**Yin** and **Yang** surge and **counterbalance**,\nThe **high** and **low** **tilt and incline**,\nThe **great** and **small** **command and obey**—\nSome **move** in front,\nSome **follow** behind,\nSome **yield** and are **warmed**,\nSome **resist** and are **chilled**,\nSome are **augmented** and **strengthened**,\nSome are **diminished** and **weakened**,\nSome are **borne** and **completed**,\nSome are **circumvented** and **destroyed**—\nAll are the **natural course of things**,\nAnd **inevitable** in their **power**.\n\nYet the world’s **foolish people**,\n**Selfishly** and **pursuing gain**,\nNow **desire to force** yet **contradict** it—\nTheir **calamity** will not **overturn** but **break**.\nOnly the Sage **knows** that it cannot be **reversed**,\nAnd thus **follows and awaits** it,\nDiscarding **excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**,\nSo that it does not **reach extremes** and **injure things**,\nAnd the world has no **suffering**—\nThis is the **utmost of non-action**.\n\n**Yao** and **Tang** faced **floods and droughts**,\nThough they could not **avoid them entirely**,\nYet they never **reached ruin**—\nThis is why.\n\nThe *Yijing* speaks of **Overreach**:\n*\"The later **ruler** with **wealth** fulfills the **Dao of Heaven and Earth**,\n**Aids and aligns** with the **proper roles of Heaven and Earth**,\nAnd **governs the people** with **right and left**.\nThree **Yang** within, three **Yin** without—\nThe **extreme of things** is reached.\nThe Sage **fears** its **excess** and **harm to life**,\nThus **wealth** is fulfilled and **aided**,\nSo that it does not **reach extremes**—\nThis is called **discarding excess**, **extravagance**, and **overreach**.\"*\n\n**Chapter Thirty: Assisting the Ruler with the Dao**\n\nTo **assist the ruler** with the **Dao** is to\n**Not use force** to **subdue the world**,\nAnd to **love the return** of things.\n\nThe Sage **uses arms**,\nAll **arise from inevitability**.\nIf not from inevitability yet **desires to force and conquer the world**,\nThough sometimes **able to conquer**,\nThe **calamity** will **return and be repaid**.",

the finest hair’s end—\nThis is why, though small, it cannot be enslaved.\n\nEven the lowliest man, if he guards it,\nMay use dust and dross to mold Yao and Shun;\nBut lords and kings, though exalted, cannot guard it,\nAnd so all things do not come to serve them.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nAnd sweet dew descends—\nNo man commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nThe **Yin** and **Yang** *qi* rise and fall,\nUniting as one to descend sweet dew,\nWhich glistens upon all things,\nNever failing to spread evenly.\n\nThe sage embodies the ultimate Dao/Way,\nResponding to all existence—\nLike sweet dew, it reaches all without exception.\nThis is why he can make all things come to serve him.\n\nWhen the Dao/Way first took form,\nNames were established.\nOnce names are given,\nEven the wise know when to stop—\nFor knowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.\n\nThe sage disperses the crude Dao/Way into **instruments**,\nThen uses these **instruments** to establish names—\nHow could he abandon the crude for the named,\nOr chase after trifles while losing his foundation?\n\nHe understands returning to its true nature,\nThus he rides through all transformations without ruin.\n\nThe Dao/Way in the world is like rivers and valleys to the great seas.\nThe great seas are the **reservoir** of water;\nRivers and valleys are its **divisions**.\nThe Dao/Way is the **origin** of all things;\nAll things are its **manifestations**.\nAll are water, so rivers and valleys return to their **reservoir**;\nAll are the Dao/Way, so things return to their **origin**.\nHe who knows others is wise,\nHe who knows himself is clear.\n\nTo discern is to know,\nTo encompass fully is to be clear.\nAs long as the heart of discernment remains,\nOne stops at knowing others but cannot know himself.\nWhen fully encompassing, there is no longer discernment,\nThus one can know himself and yet also reach others.\n\nHe who overcomes others has strength,\nHe who overcomes himself is powerful.\nStrength can reach others but not oneself,\nYet one who can conquer self and restore true nature—\nThis is beyond the reach of mere strength,\nAnd so he may be called powerful.\n\nHe who knows contentment is rich.\nThe one who knows contentment finds sufficiency in what he encounters,\nAnd so he is never without richness.\nThough he possess all under heaven,\nIf he constantly harbors the thought of insufficiency,\nThen he can never be truly rich.\n\nThe resolute have ambition.\nTo not contend with things yet remain ever self-strengthening—\nNo thing can take away his ambition.\nHe who does not lose his place endures long.\nThings transform endlessly,\nYet if his heart never strays,\nThen he endures long.\n\nHe who dies yet does not perish attains longevity.\nThe transformation of life and death is vast indeed;\nYet if his true nature remains undiminished and unlost,\nThis is the ancient **Perfect Man** who neither lives nor dies.\n\nThe great Dao/Way is vast and all-encompassing,\nIts influence cannot be confined to left or right.\nVast and all-encompassing, it has neither \"yes\" nor \"no,\"\nThus it moves freely above and below,\nCirculating without end.\n\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not claim them as its own.\nWhen its work is done, it takes no credit.\nThe world has those who nourish things yet do not claim them—\nThey will surely name them as their own.\nThe world has those who flee from things yet do not possess them—\nThey will surely reject things and fail to live.\nTo live without claiming,\nTo achieve without taking credit—\nOnly the Dao/Way does this.\n\nTo cherish and nourish all things yet not lord over them,\nTo always lack desire—\nThis may be called \"small.\"\nAll things returning to it without its lording over them—\nThis may be called \"great.\"\n\nThus the sage never claims to be great,\nAnd so he achieves true greatness.\nIf one claims greatness with a heart of greatness,\nThen he is

come without harm,\nTo rest in ease, peace, and harmony.\nIf there is love and hate,\nThen there are things to benefit and things to harm;\nIf love and hate are fully exhausted,\nThen it is without harm to all things.\n\nThus the ultimate comes to rest in ease,\nIn peace, and in harmony.\nDelight and bait,\nThe passing traveler stops.\nThe Dao/Way, when spoken of,\nIs bland and without flavor;\nTo look upon it, one sees no form;\nTo listen to it, one hears no sound;\nTo use it, one cannot exhaust it.\n\nTo create delight and set bait,\nTo await those who come—\nSurely this would suffice to stop the passing traveler?\nYet when the delight is spent and the bait exhausted,\nThey will gather it up and depart.\n\nBut if one grasps the **Great Image** to await all under heaven,\nAll under heaven will not know to love it—\nHow much less would they know to hate it?\nThough it lacks scent, flavor, form, color, or sound to please men,\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Sage’s Way of Giving**»\n\nWhen one is about to **withdraw** it,\nHe must first **fully extend** it;\nWhen one is about to **weaken** it,\nHe must first **fully

will be difficult;\nIf the **principle** is lacking,\nThen things will not submit to it.\nYet this is nearly the same as using **wisdom**,\nAnd what difference is there between it and Guan Zhong or Sun Wu?\n\nThe sage’s way and the world’s way\nDo indeed have traces of similarity.\n\nThe sage rides upon **principle**,\nWhile the world uses **wisdom**.\nTo ride upon **principle** is like a skilled physician\nApplying remedies precisely to the disease;\nTo use **wisdom** is like a shrewd merchant\nSeeking clever gains.\n\nThe supple overcome the rigid,\nThe weak overcome the strong.\nThe sage knows that rigid strength is not to be relied upon,\nThus he treats himself with supple weakness.\nWhen the world’s rigid strength is contending,\nMutually undermining each other,\nYet I alone remain supple and weak to await them—\nWhen the great are injured and the small perish,\nI sit without retaliation, letting them die.\nThis is called victory.\n\nYet the sage does not intend to do this and overcome things—\nHe simply knows the **nature of things**,\nAnd abides in their natural course.",

virtue,\nand thus virtue is lost.\n\nThe sage follows his heart’s desire without overstepping measure,\nnot deliberately cultivating virtue—virtue suffices on its own.\nThose below know virtue’s worth and strive to retain it,\nyet merely preserve themselves—what true virtue do they possess?\n\nThe supreme virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe lesser virtue acts and yet still strives to act.\nTo act while striving to act is still action.\nOnly when acting without striving to act\ncan one truly be said to act without action.\n\nThose below cannot succeed without action,\nyet they still strive to act—\nnot merely performing without safeguarding.\n\nSupreme benevolence acts without striving to act,\nsupreme righteousness acts while striving to act.\nBoth benevolence and righteousness cannot escape action—\ntheir difference lies in this:\nBenevolence excels in acting without striving,\nwhile righteousness takes pride in acting with striving.\n\nVirtue has high and low,\nbut benevolence and righteousness have only high—no low—\nwhy?\nBecause those beneath benevolence and righteousness\nare not worth further discussion.\n\nSupreme ritual acts, yet none respond,\nso it forces compliance with bared arms.\nFrom virtue descending to ritual,\nthe sage’s means to order the people are exhausted.\n\nThus, when action meets no response,\nit resorts to bared arms and coercion;\nwhen coercion fails, punishments arise and arms are raised—\nthen it is mere performance without fulfillment.\n\nHence, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises#1;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, ritual arises.\nRitual, though thin in loyalty and trust,\nis the beginning of chaos.\nLoyalty and trust without ritual remain unseen,\nbut ritual established makes their virtues flare outward.\n\nBetween ruler and subject, parent and child,\nhusband and wife, friends—\ntheir outward forms are rigid,\nyet their inner substance is exhausted.\nThus, adherence brings order,\nwhile defiance brings chaos.\nThe distance between order and chaos is infinitesimal—\nhence, ritual is called the origin of chaos.\n\nPreconceived knowledge is the adornment of the Dao,\nyet the beginning of folly.\nThe sage gazes profoundly upon all things,\nlaying out right and wrong, gain and loss before him,\nlike a mirror reflecting forms—\nnothing escapes his sight.\nYet what is before or behind?\nCommon folk see only with their eyes,\nhear only with their ears,\nthink only with their minds,\nand wander blindly among things,\nexhausting their intelligence to seek knowledge,\noccasionally glimpsing truth—\nthough they deem themselves enlightened,\nthey know not that their greatest folly begins with self-assurance.\n\nThus, the noble man dwells in substance, not in superficiality,\nin reality, not in adornment—\nand so he discards the latter for the former.\nThe vulgar delight in what they gain below,\nforgetting what is above—\nthey rejoice in superficiality and abandon substance.\nWho but the noble man can discard the latter for the former?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Ninth: The Ancient Attainment

Dao.\nAll things attain their being through the Dao.\nYet people of the world see things and forget the Dao.\n\nThe heavens know only their clarity,\nthe earth knows only their tranquility,\nthe spirit knows only their numinosity,\nthe valleys know only their fullness,\nall things know only their flourishing,\nand the sovereigns know only their authority over the world.\nThey do not know the source of what they possess—\nall is the Dao abiding within.\n\nIf the heavens lost Oneness, they would fear collapse,\nif the earth lost Oneness, they would fear upheaval,\nif the spirit lost Oneness, they would fear cessation,\nif the valleys lost Oneness, they would fear exhaustion,\nif all things lost Oneness, they would fear annihilation,\nif the sovereigns lost Oneness, they would fear ruin.\n*\"Extreme\"* refers to their limits.\n\nHad the heavens not attained Oneness, they would not yet have collapsed,\nhad the earth not attained Oneness, they would not yet have

would not yet have annihilated,\nhad the sovereigns not attained Oneness, they would not yet have ruined—\nyet their extremes must reach this point.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the lowly as foundation,\nthe high relies on the lowly as base.\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nthe nobility of sovereigns—\nall are governed by Oneness.\n\nWhat, then, is this Oneness?\nSee it, and it cannot be seen;\ngrasp it, and it cannot be held—\nyet it is the most subtle of all things under heaven,\nthis so-called lowly and humble.\n\nThus, sovereigns call themselves \"lonely, few, and unworthy\"—\nis this not taking the lowly as foundation?\nIs it not?\nThose who made such claims in ancient times\nmerely emphasized the root while neglecting the branches.\n\nHence, the carriage’s parts—wheels, spokes, canopy, axles, poles, yokes, hubs, and fittings—\nare countable, yet the carriage itself is not counted.\nOnly then does one know that the carriage is formed by what is *not* there—\nthis is called \"using the nonexistent for utility.\"\n\nYet would heaven and earth seek to become vast through vastness?\nWould sovereigns seek to become noble through nobility?",

the body while despising wealth,\nis still not to have forgotten oneself.\nThe one who forgets oneself,\ndoes not even possess the body—\nhow much less name and wealth?\n\nYet to esteem the body as the world’s treasure,\none must forget oneself.\nThus, when the world knows\nthat name is not worth cherishing,\nthat wealth is not worth hoarding,\nthen one knows how to honor the body.\nTo know how to honor the body,\nthen one knows how to forget oneself—\nthis is the intent of Laozi.\n\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\nThe one who does not attain wealth\nconsiders loss a harm;\nbut when wealth is gained and then lost,\nthe harm is even greater than loss itself.\nOnly by equalizing gain and loss,\nbalancing possession and privation,\ncan one avoid harm.\n\nThus, the more one loves,\nthe greater the cost;\nthe more one hoards,\nthe greater the loss.\nExcessive love\nleads one to do anything to obtain it—\nhow can this avoid depletion?\nExcessive hoarding\ndraws countless assailants—\nhow can this avoid destruction?\n\nContentment with what one has brings no disgrace,\nknowing when to stop brings no peril—\nthus one can endure long.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 45: The Chapter on Great Achievement Resembling Deficiency**\nGreat achievement resembles deficiency—\nits application is never exhausted.\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness—\nits utility is never spent.\n\nThe world regards non-deficiency as achievement,\nyet such achievement inevitably falters.\nIt regards non-emptiness as fullness,\nyet such fullness inevitably ceases.\n\nThe sage seeks great achievement\nwithout worrying about its resemblance to deficiency,\nstrives for great fullness\nwithout abhorring its resemblance to emptiness—\nthus his achievement never falters,\nhis fullness never ceases.\n\nGreat rectitude resembles bending,\ngreat skill resembles clumsiness,\ngreat eloquence resembles stammering.\nRectitude that does not bend\nis itself broken;\nfollowing principle in action,\nthough curved, remains straight.\n\nSkill that does not seem clumsy\nis itself exhausted;\ntrusting nature’s course,\nthough clumsy, is truly skillful.\n\nEloquence that does not stammer\nis itself spent;\nspeaking according to principle,\nthough stammering, is truly eloquent.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\ntranquility overcomes heat,\nyet purity and stillness are the world’s true norm.\n\nTo achieve without deficiency,\nto be full without emptiness,\nto be straight without bending,\nto be skillful without clumsiness,\nto be eloquent without stammering—\nthis is like agitation that cannot be tranquil,\ntranquility that cannot be agitated.\nAgitation can overcome cold but not heat,\ntranquility can overcome heat but not cold—\nboth are stuck in one extreme,\nnot reaching the true norm.\n\nOnly when one is settled in purity and stillness,\nuntainted by any one thing,\nneither achieving nor deficient,\nneither full nor empty,\nneither straight nor bent,\nneither skillful nor clumsy,\nneither eloquent nor stammering—\nthen one can overcome all things,\nand stand as the world’s true norm.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 46: The Chapter on the World’s Dao**\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nwarhorses are turned into manure.\nWhen the world has the Dao,\neach follows its proper place—\nthere is no strife, yet all is governed,\nthus warhorses are turned into manure.\n\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\nNo guilt is greater than craving what is forbidden,\nno calamity is greater than ignorance of contentment,\nno blame is greater than greed for what one desires.\n\nTo display one’s forbidden cravings to others,\nis already a guilt;\nbut to fail in satisfying others’ desires,\nthe calamity is even worse.\nTo demand that all desires be fulfilled,\nthe blame is the greatest.\n\nEven a common man\nwill suffer when he clings to one thing—\nhow much more the lord and king!\nThus warhorses arise.\n\nHence, to know contentment is true contentment.\nThe contented man\nfinds sufficiency in what he encounters—\nthus he knows no lack.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 47: The Chapter on Not Leaving the Door**\nNot leaving the door,\nyet knowing the world;\nnot peering through the window,\nyet seeing the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\n\nThe nature of things\npervades the cosmos—\nno difference in far or near,\nancient or modern.\n\nThe sage of old\nknew all without leaving door or window—\nfor his nature was complete.\n\nThe world’s people\nare obscured by things,\ntheir nature divided by ears and eyes.\nWithin, they are troubled by body and mind;\nwithout, they are blocked by mountains and rivers.\nThey see but do not perceive,\nthey hear but do not comprehend.\nEven the smallest opening of door or window\ncan obscure and cut them off—\nthey do not know that the sage restores his nature\nand finds sufficiency within,\nyet they still seek to go out and gain more—\nthus the farther they go, the less they know.\n\nHence the sage acts without moving,\nyet knows all;\nhe names without seeing,\nyet is precise;\nhe accomplishes without doing,\nyet all is done.\nWhat the nature attains,\nis not merely knowing and naming—\nit is to follow things’ natural course,\nand achieve without effort.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 48: The Chapter on Daily Gain and Loss**\nTo study daily is to gain—\nbut if one does not know the Dao\nand yet still studies,\nthe more one hears and sees,\nthe more one is scattered,\nand one is not yet a true learner.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Much hearing—\nchoose the good and follow it.\nMuch seeing—\ndiscern and understand.\nThis is the second stage of knowing.\"*\n\nTo cultivate the Dao daily is to diminish—\nif one attains the Dao in a single day,\nand looks upon all things,\nnone are not false.\nAbandoning falsehood to seek the restoration of nature,\none’s nature is truly few in number.\n\nConfucius said to Zigong:\n*\"Zigong, do you think I am the kind who

of death is ever nineteen-fold.\n\nFor I have heard that those skilled in preserving life\nwalk upon land without encountering rhinoceros or tigers,\nenter battle without being struck by armor or weapons.\n\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nthe tiger no place to set its claws,\nand weapons no place to hold their blades.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no place of death for them.\n\nThe **Perfect Ones** dwell perpetually in the realm of neither life nor death—\nif there is no place of life, how much less a place of death?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Nourishes and Accumulates**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to life,\n**virtue** nurtures and sustains it,\nthings take their form from it,\nand **force** brings them to completion.\n\nThe Dao is the mother of all things,\nand thus it is the Dao that gives birth to all things.\nWhen its movement becomes **virtue**, it tends to the multitude without wearying,\nand thus it is **virtue** that sustains all things.\n\nYet **virtue** and the Dao cannot manifest themselves alone;\nthey rely on things to reveal their presence.\nThings cannot complete themselves alone;\nnear and far interact,\nhard and soft intermingle,\nand through accumulation, **force** arises,\nonly then do the changes of flourishing and decline, order and chaos, come to fruition.\n\nTherefore, all things revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem.\nThough form arises from things and completion from **force**,\nwithout the Dao, there would be no birth,\nand without **virtue**, there would be no sustenance.\nThus, to revere the Dao and hold **virtue** in high esteem,\nto revere it as one would a father or elder brother,\nto hold it in high esteem as one would a noble lord,\nfor the Dao is without rank while **virtue** bears a name.\n\nThe reverence of the Dao and the honor of **virtue**,\nnone bestow them yet they remain ever natural.\nThose who rely on rank to attain reverence and honor,\nare not truly revered or honored.\nHence the Dao nourishes, sustains, grows, matures, and fosters all things—\ngiving birth yet not possessing,\nacting yet not relying,\nlengthening yet not controlling.\nThis is called **mysterious virtue**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Beginning of the World**\n\nThe world has a beginning,\nwhich serves as the mother of all things.\n\nThe **Nameless** is the beginning of heaven and earth;\nthe **Named** is the mother of all things.\nBefore the Dao takes on the **Named**, it is the source from which things arise;\nwhen it takes on the **Named**, it is the means by which things are born.\nThus it is called both **beginning** and **mother**.\nIts offspring are all things.\n\nHaving obtained its **mother**,\none knows its offspring;\nhaving known its offspring,\none returns to guard its **mother**,\nand thus one’s life is never in peril.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao to encompass all things,\nlike one who knows the child through the mother—\nclearly perceptive without fail.\nThough their wisdom may encompass all things,\nthey never forget the Dao in their pursuit of things,\nand thus they always return to guard its **mother**.\n\nStop their **joys** and close their **gates**,\nand they will never tire in their lifetime.\nOpen their **joys** and aid their pursuits,\nand they will never be saved in their lifetime.\n\nAll under heaven possess this Dao,\nyet they constantly rest and forget the Dao while yielding to things.\nThe eyes delight in colors,\nthe ears delight in sounds,\nand when their delightful hearts are opened,\ntheir affairs are aided—\nthus they fall into ruin all their lives and cannot be saved.\n\nThe reason the sage remains unmoved throughout life,\nis that they stop and close their **gates**,\nnever venturing forth to yield to things.\n\nSeeing small as clear,\ndelight is harmful.\nThe beginning is small yet grows vast.\nKnowing that small will become great and closing it,\nthis may be called clear.\n\nGuarding softness as strength.\nFollowing what one delights in without restraint,\none may think oneself strong,\nyet this is not true strength.\nOnly those who see delight and fear it,\nmay be called truly strong.\n\nUsing its **radiance** yet returning to its **clarity**,\nwithout leaving one’s body to harm,\nthis is called **embracing constancy**.\n\nCommon folk open their **delights** and yield their bodies to things,\ngoing forth without return.\nThe sage stops and closes their **gates**,\nnot rejecting things outright,\nbut responding with their **spirit** and using its **radiance** alone—\ntheir body does not engage.\n\nThe ears can hear,\nthe eyes can see,\nthe nose can smell,\nthe mouth can taste,\nthe body can touch,\nand the mind can think—\nall these are called **radiance**.\n\nIndeed, **radiance** interacts with things,\nbut when things depart, **clarity** is undiminished.\nThus it responds to all changes without exhaustion,\nand harm does not reach its body.\nHence its constant nature remains pure and unbroken.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: Let Me Be Simple**\n\nIf I were to be simple and yet

dust—\nthis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\n\nThe Dao cannot be spoken of,\nyet it is not apart from speech,\nbut those who know it may not speak,\nand those who speak may not know it.\n\nOnly by blocking the senses and closing the gates to shut out the external,\nby dulling sharpness, untangling confusion, harmonizing brilliance, and blending with dust to govern the internal,\ndoes one remain silent and align with the Dao.\n\nThus, it cannot be approached as close or distant,\ncannot be grasped as beneficial or harmful,\ncannot be esteemed as noble or base—\nand so it is held in highest honor by the world.\n\nIf it can be approached as close, it can be pushed away.\nIf it can be grasped as beneficial, it can be turned to harm.\nIf it can be esteemed as noble, it can be brought low.\n\nThose who embody the Dao cover all things equally—\nwho then is truly close or distant?\nThey observe reversals and顺 (*shùn*) impartially—\nwho then knows gain or loss?\nIgnorant of honor and disgrace—\nwho then distinguishes noble from base?\n\nThe mind’s schemes cannot fathom this—\nthus the world holds it in highest honor.\n\n**Chapter 58: Governing with the Rectified Way**\n\nGovern with the rectified Way,\nemploy the extraordinary in warfare,\nand take the world without action.\n\nThe ancient sages softened the distant while strengthening the near,\nhaving no intention of waging war—\nonly when unavoidable did they resort to arms.\nThus, governing the state is the rectified Way,\nwhile waging war is the extraordinary.\n\nYet even this is insufficient to take the world.\nThe world is a divine instrument—\nit cannot be forced, for those who force it fail,\nand those who grasp it lose it.\nOnly those who embody the Dao stand effortlessly beyond action,\nand though they do not take the world, the world submits to them.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nWhen the world abounds in taboos, the people grow poorer;\nwhen the ruler multiplies taboos, the common voice cannot reach above—\nthus the people grow poor and without recourse.\n\nWhen the people wield sharp tools, the state grows confused;\nsharp tools are stratagems.\nWhen a wise ruler presides, he keeps the people in ignorance,\nso they know nothing and desire nothing.\n\nIf the people abound in stratagems, their ruler grows dazzled and confused.\nIf the people rely on cleverness, strange things proliferate—\nwhen people abandon their roots and chase after superficial gains,\nthen useless and harmful things arise.\n\nWhen laws multiply, thieves and robbers increase.\nDistrusting the deceit of people, rulers multiply laws to overcome them—\nthe people, with nowhere to turn, daily fall into thievery.\n\nThus the sage says:\n*I do nothing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI do nothing, yet the people grow rich;\nI desire nothing, yet the people return to simplicity.*\n\n**Chapter 58 (continued): The Governance of Obscurity**\n\nWhen governance is obscure, the people are pure;\nwhen governance is scrutinizing, the people grow weary.\n\nCalamity is the reverse of fortune,\nfortune is the foundation of calamity.\nWho knows their limits?\nThere is no fixed rectitude.\n\nRectitude becomes the extraordinary,\nthe good becomes the ominous—\nthe people’s confusion has long endured.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth,\nyet the common view is dazzled and does not know.\n\nFortune leans on calamity,\ncalamity lurks within fortune—\nlike the succession of day and night, cold and heat.\n\nRectitude becoming the extraordinary,\nthe good becoming the ominous—\nlike the cycle of old and young, life and death,\nnever truly fixed—yet the confused do not know.\n\nOnly the sage stands beyond all things,\nsurveying their beginning and end,\ngrasping their completeness,\nabandoning petty scrutiny.\nTo the eye, governance appears obscure—\nyet the people are pure, each preserving their nature.\n\nAs for the common folk,\nthey know not the Dao’s full body,\ntaking what the ears and eyes perceive as ultimate.\nThey deem themselves fortunate,\nyet know not the calamity hidden behind;\nthey deem themselves good,\nyet know not the ominous arising within.\n\nNarrowly, they take scrutiny for clarity—\nwhen scrutiny is extreme,\nit harms things without realizing its error—\nhow pitiable!\n\nThus the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not wound,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nKnowing that petty scrutiny cannot exhaust things,\nthough capable of being square, upright, and bright,\nthey do not employ these abilities,\nfearing to fall into one-sidedness without return—\nthis is what the world calls *obscure governance*.\n\n**Chapter 59: Governing People and Serving Heaven**\n\nTo govern people and serve Heaven,\nnothing surpasses *frugality*.\n\nOnly through frugality is early cultivation achieved.\nEarly cultivation is called *heavy accumulation of virtue*—\nheavy accumulation of virtue means nothing is unconquerable,\nnothing is unconquerable means its limits are unknown,\nand unknown limits mean one can possess a state.\n\nThe foundation of possessing a state,\nthis can endure long.\n\nAll things, when square, are cut;\nwhen sharp, they wound;\nwhen straight, they overreach;\nwhen bright, they dazzle.\n\nOnly the sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not wound,\nstraight yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle—\nthis is called *sound*.\n\nSound is having without using.\nThe world’s affliction is its inability to subdue others—\nif one truly possesses *sound* and can embody it,\nthough never competing with others,\nothers know they cannot overcome it—\nthus they submit early.\n\nOnce they submit, their power is withdrawn,\nuntil death, never tested—\nthen virtue is heavily accumulated.\n\nWhen virtue is deeply accumulated,\neven the world’s strongest cannot conquer—\nthus none can measure its extent.\nOnly then can one possess a state.\n\nAs for the petty men of the world,\nthey wield even a finger’s power lightly—\nonce they fail to subdue, the world measures their depth and contests them.\nThough they wish to preserve their state,\nthey cannot.\n\nThus I know *sound* can bring possession of a state,\nand possession of a state is the mother of a state.\nThis is called *deep roots

great realm follows the low, and the world naturally turns to the great realm,\njust as all waters flow toward the lowlands.\nThe world’s confluence, the world’s *yin* (牝).\nThe *yin* always conquers the *yang* (牡) through stillness,\nand stillness is the path of the low.\nAll things in motion seek stillness,\njust as all high places descend to the low.\nThus, when the great realm follows the low of lesser realms, it takes them;\nwhen the lesser realm follows the low of the great realm, it is taken by them.\nIf the great realm follows the low, then lesser realms will attach to it;\nif the lesser realm follows the low, then the great realm will accept it.\nHence, sometimes one follows the low to take, sometimes one follows the low to be taken.\nThe great realm follows the low to take others,\nthe lesser realm follows the low to be taken by others.\nThe great realm seeks only to encompass and nurture all,\nthe lesser realm seeks only to enter and serve others.\nBoth attain what they desire,\nso the great realm should follow the low.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao is the Hidden Essence of All Things**\nThe Dao is the hidden essence of all things,\na treasure for the virtuous, a safeguard for the unvirtuous.\nFine words can be sold, noble deeds can be bestowed upon others.\nIf a person is unvirtuous, why should they be abandoned?\nAll things that appear outwardly are but their thresholds and halls.\nThe Dao in things is like their hidden essence—\nevery thing possesses it, yet no one truly sees it.\nOnly the wise can grasp and hold it,\nhence it is called the treasure of the virtuous.\nThe foolish, though unable to possess it,\ncannot remain at peace without the Dao,\nhence it is called the safeguard of the unvirtuous.\nThe Dao is not distant from people,\nyet people often distance themselves from it.\nIf one truly speaks of the Dao’s beauty,\nit can be traded in the world;\nif one practices its noble ways,\nit can be bestowed upon others.\nMorning they act without righteousness,\nevening they hear the great Dao—\ntheir falsehoods exhausted, their nature restored,\nthough one might wish to point out their unvirtue,\nit cannot be found—\nand why should they be abandoned then?\nThus, to establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers,\neven with a jade tablet held before four thoroughbreds,\nit is not as good as simply sitting and offering this Dao.\nTo establish the Son of Heaven and appoint the Three Exalted Ministers\nis to save the people through the Dao.\nThough the jade tablet is precious and the thoroughbreds fine,\noffering them is not as beneficial as offering this Dao.\nThe ancients valued this Dao so highly,\nnot because they sought to gain it or to escape punishment through it,\nbut because it is the most noble for all under Heaven.\nThe Dao originates within us,\nyet people suffer from not seeking it—\nif they seek it, they will find it.\nThe Dao has no merit or fault,\nyet people suffer from not knowing it—\nif they know it, no fault can taint them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Non-Action**\nTo act without action, to manage without managing, to savor without savoring.\nGreat or small, much or little—\nto repay resentment with *virtue*.\nThe sage acts without action,\nso there is nothing they cannot do;\nthey manage without managing,\nso there is nothing they cannot oversee;\nthey savor without savoring,\nso there is nothing they cannot appreciate.\nIn matters of greatness or smallness, abundance or scarcity,\nthey simply meet them with the Dao.\nWhat people cannot forget is resentment,\nyet when their love and hatred are forgotten,\neven repaying resentment is like repaying *virtue*.\nTo seek difficulty in what is easy,\nto see greatness in what is small—\nthe world’s most difficult tasks must begin in ease,\nthe world’s greatest matters must arise from the minute.\nThus, the sage never seeks what is great,\nand so they achieve what is great.\nLight promises must be few,\nmany easy things bring many difficulties—\nso the sage considers what is difficult,\nand thus they never face difficulty.\nAll people fear what is great and scorn what is small,\nshun what is difficult and embrace what is easy.\nWhen they wait until things are difficult before acting,\nor until things are great before pursuing them,\ntheir undertakings often fail.\nThe sage treats greatness and smallness equally,\nunifies abundance and scarcity,\nfears nothing, finds nothing difficult—\nhow could their undertakings ever fail?\nIts ease lies in its firmness—\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 64: Its Ease Lies in Its Firmness**\nIts ease lies in its firmness,\nits unseen potential lies in early planning,\nits fragility lies in its lightness,\nits subtlety lies in its dispersion.\nTo act before things arise,\nto govern before chaos comes.\nWhen things have not yet arisen,\nfirmness and planning suffice.\nWhen they are about to arise,\nonly lightness and dispersion can remove them—\nyet this is still better than when they are already formed.\nThus, acting before things arise is the highest,\ngoverning before chaos comes is the next best.\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\na nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na thousand-*li* journey begins beneath one’s feet.\nThose who act will ruin it,\nthose who grasp will lose it—\nso the sage acts without action,\nand thus there is no ruin;\nthey grasp without holding,\nand thus there is no loss.\nThe coming of disorder, calamity, fortune, and misfortune\nare all like these three things.\nThe sage accumulates the small to achieve the great,\nholds firm without action,\nguards without grasping—\nsecretly letting roots grow of their own accord,\nletting calamity vanish on its own.\nLike planting seeds,\ndeeply tilling and richly fertilizing—\nwhen autumn comes, they flourish.\nLike being robbed,\nsitting calmly and watching keenly—\nthe thief will soon retreat.\nThe people of the world do not understand the natural order of things,\nbelieving that nothing is accomplished without action,\nnothing is retained without grasping—\nso they constantly vie with calamity for victory,\nstruggle with fortune for excess#1,\nand thus calamity arrives when it cannot be saved,\nfortune arrives when it cannot be completed—\nthis is the natural consequence of their ways.\nThe people’s undertakings often succeed when they are just beginning,\nthen fail when they are nearly complete.\nTo be cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\nThe sage knows the harm of action,\ndoes not aid Heaven by forcing outcomes,\nand from beginning to end follows what is natural—\nso there is nothing they cannot complete.\nThe people’s hearts dwell on gain and loss,\nand even when their undertakings are still slight,\nthey have those who do not know and let them follow their own nature—\nbut when they see things almost formed,\nthey fear loss and ruin them—\nthere has never been one who did not consider this a failure.\nHence it is said: *To be cautious at the end as at the beginning,*\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\nThus the sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain wealth;\nthey study without studying,\nreturn to the errors of the common people.\nTo assist the natural unfolding of all things,\nand never dare to act.\nAll people follow what they praise to harm things,\nbelieve what they learn to harm principle.",

bewilder them.\n\nThe so-called wise of old,\ngrasped the **completeness of the Dao/Way**,\nand surveyed the **beginning and end of all things**—\nthus they were truly honored.\n\nCommon folk cannot

model**,\nis called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.\n\n**Mysterious Virtue/Power** is profound and distant,\ncontrary to things—\nthen alone does it reach **Great Harmony**.\n\nWhat I value is **virtue/power**,\nwhat things blame is wisdom—\n**Virtue/power** and wisdom are inherently opposed,\nyet wisdom follows what is small,\nwhile **virtue/power** follows what is great.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The Ruler of All Things**\nThe reason the **river and sea** can be the **ruler of all valleys**,\nis that they excel in **yielding**—\nthus they can be the **ruler of all

forbearance** as insufficient for action—\nthey do not know that **courage** ranked second is easily broken,\nwhile **compassion and forbearance** are invincible—\nin the end, they must return to **compassion**.\n\n**Frugality** is why one can be **vast**;\nThe world values **vastness** as covering all things,\nand considers **restraint and modesty** as vulgar—\nthey do not know that **vastness** is easily exhausted,\nwhile **frugality and modesty** are easily sufficient—\nin the end, they must return to **vastness**.\n\n**Not daring to act before the world** is why one can become

**not daring to lead** brings joy to the world—\nin the end, they must finally become **instrumental and long-lasting**.\n\nFrom the **primordial simplicity** scattering, things become **instruments**;\nThe sage employs them, and they become **officials and leaders**.\nSince the **primordial simplicity** becomes **instruments**,\nthere are those who belong to them and those who lead

When the multitude of things and people do not vie for one another, each finds sufficiency in themselves.\n\n**Chapter 80: \"The Blind Do Not Admire Beauty\"**\n*\"True speech is not adorned; adorned speech is not true.*\nTrue speech is substance alone—no need for embellishment.\nAdorned speech is mere spectacle—no need for truth.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nPrioritizing virtue, one need not prove oneself.\nPrioritizing argument, one may not be virtuous.\nThe wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.\nWith one thread to bind all, there is no need for vast learning.\nTo study and grow daily does not guarantee the Dao.\nThe Sage accumulates nothing—\nThe more they give to others, the more they possess;\nThe more they bestow, the more they have.\n\nThe Sage holds fast to *One* alone, accumulating nothing else.\nYet they deploy their abilities for others,\nextend their possessions to others—\nWhen others are exhausted but *One* remains inexhaustible,\nthen one knows the value of *One*.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\nWhat can benefit may also harm;\nWhat can act may also contend.\nYet the Sage, though capable of benefit and harm, never harms;\nThough capable of action and contention, never contends—\nThus, Heaven and the Sage surpass all others,\nbecoming the root from which all things stem.\n\nAll this is what Laozi wrote and the broad outline of his Dao.\nHence, he reiterates it at the book’s close.\n\n---\n**Annotations in Original Text:**\n#1 *\"争\"* (contend) originally *\"生\"* (life), corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n#2 *\"以勇决\"* (with bold resolve) originally *\"之\"*, corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n#3 *\"愈多\"* (ever more abundant) originally *\"与多\"*, corrected per *Baoyan* edition.\n\n**Postscript by Su Shi of Elline Hill (Mountain of Bamboo):**\nAt forty-two years of age, I was exiled to Junzhou.",

His conduct was noble and his mind profound, and he took pleasure in conversing with me on the Dao. I told him:\n\n*\"What you speak of, I have already found in the Confucian texts.\"*\n\nQuanzhen replied: *\"This is the Buddha’s teaching—how could a Confucian have attained it?\"*\n\nI said: *\"Not so. I have heard the Dao, which Confucians do not possess—why forcefully accuse them of it? Truly, it exists, though the world knows it not.\"*\n\nQuanzhen pressed: *\"The separation between Confucianism and Buddhism is as vast as that between the Hu and Han peoples—how then do you claim to know it? Speak briefly of its essence.\"*\n\nI answered: *\"The grandson of Confucius, Zisi, wrote *The Doctrine of the Mean*. Within it, he says:\n\n*'Before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise, this is called the *zhong* [centrality].\nWhen they arise yet remain measured, this is called *he* [harmony].\n*Zhong* is the great root of all under Heaven;\n*He* is the universal Way of all under Heaven.\nTo attain *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth find their place, and all things flourish.\nIs this not the Buddha’s teaching?

Since the Sixth Patriarch, half of those who attained enlightenment through these words have done so.’*\n\nWhat is meant by ‘not dwelling on goodness, nor dwelling on evil’ is precisely the state where joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have not yet arisen.\n\nIndeed, *zhong* [centrality] is but another name for the Buddha-nature;\nwhile *he* [harmony] encompasses the six perfections and myriad practices.\n\nTo attain the utmost *zhong* and *he*, Heaven and Earth take their place, and all things flourish within—what else could this be but the Buddha’s teaching?\n\nQuanzhen, astonished and delighted, exclaimed: *\"I never knew this before! Only now do I realize that Confucianism and Buddhism are one in essence.\"*\n\nI laughed and said: *\"Not so. Though there is but one Way under Heaven, the means of governing people differ. Between ruler and subject, parent and child, without ritual and law, there is only chaos. To know ritual and law yet ignore the Way—that is the common scholar, unworthy of praise.\n\nTo dwell in mountains and forests, eating coarse food and drinking from streams, yet harboring the supreme Dao—one might become a teacher of gods and humans. But to govern the world with such a path would bring disorder.\n\nThe ancient sages held the Dao in their hearts and practiced it, yet did not reject the laws of the world—only then could they succeed.\"*\n\nQuanzhen bowed in reverence and said: *\"This is profound discourse!\"*\n\nAt that time, I was expounding the *Laozi*, and whenever I completed a chapter, I showed it to Quanzhen. He would always sigh and say: *\"All of this is the Buddha’s teaching.\"*\n\nI stayed in Jun for five years before returning north. Quanzhen passed away not long after. Twenty years have now passed since then.\n\nWhenever I revised *The Explanation of the Laozi*, I never found anything that did not align with the Buddha’s teaching.\n\nSince there are no others with whom I can converse, I long to see Quanzhen again to show him these words, so I have appended them to the end of *The Laozi*.\n\nWritten on the tenth day of the twelfth month, the second year of the *Daguan* era, by Zi Xiang.",
