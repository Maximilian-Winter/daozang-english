(戊辰).\n*The incantation—*\n*The Heavenly Spirits aid the High Purity Dao/Way,*\n*Seal its name.*\n*One person may perform it,*\n*And all Nine Heavens and Ten Thousand Earths shall obey.*\n\n**Great Heat Six Wu Concealment Talisman** (大暑六戊隐形符)\n*The Left True Person* (左真人) *says:*\n*This Six Wu Method,*\n*When deploying the array and acting,*\n*Is equal in power to Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Gate,*\n*The Phoenix Star* (蓬星), *Supreme Yang* (太阳), *Supreme Yin* (太阴),\n*Marching the Hexagrams* (步罡), *Treading the Stars* (蹑斗),\n*According to the Ten Heavenly Stems* (十干) *of day and time,*\n*Enter first, invoking the spirit below the heart,*\n*To fulfill the plans of the ritual.*\n*Identify the directions of Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Gate,*\n*Know where the Jade Maiden stands guard.*\n*Then, with the left hand holding a blade,*\n*At the Ghost Gate* (鬼门) *take soil to build the walls,*\n*Next, take the Six Wu talisman,*\n*In the four straight directions of the Six Wu array,*\n*Mark them with soil,*\n*Press the Six Wu Seal between them,*\n*And from the central soil rise,*\n*So none shall see you,*\n*Much less the common folk.*\n\n**Six Wu Divine Talisman** (六戊神符)\n*This talisman governs the Six Passes,*\n*Press the Six Wu,*\n*On yellow silk or yellow paper,*\n*With female yellow ochre* (雌黄) *write the Branch and Stem* (支干) *of Wu,*\n*And Vermilion write the seals.*\n\nFirst, on the **Wu-Chen** day, make the offering, and continue through to **Wu-Wu**, thus communicating with spirits.\n\nAlways use yellow paper to write the talisman, and offer it with wine.\n\nIf there is an ancient city, determine its cardinal directions by the prefectural and county offices, marking the **Six Wu** positions.\n\nWithin the prefectural and county offices, take soil from the empty ground above the **monthly taboo** area—one *dou* and two *sheng*—and with wealth paper and wine, make offerings to the Six Gods.\n\nAlternatively, open the **orifice** and bury the talisman, covering it with soil, and burn paper money above it.\n\nIf the land is unclean or impure, divide the soil, burn it, and place the talisman and paper upon it, beginning on **Jia-Zi** of the **Wu-Chen** decan.\n\nThe rest follows similarly.\n\nIf there is no seal, write the talisman below the day’s name in ink, and inscribe the deity’s name.\n\n**Right:** This **Six Wu Seal**, on **Six Wu** days, according to the day’s Branch, carve it on a thriving patch of land, without vermilion, in a square diagram of **2.8 cun**.\n\nOn **Six Jia** days, fell a **sandalwood** tree to carve it, and chant:\n\n*\"Today’s use, felling wood to carve the seal,\nThe Heavenly Seal is delivered to the **Effigy**,\nSeizing the **killer star**, exhausting all evil spirits.\nHeaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon—\nTheir power spreads beneath the heavens like an image,\nHiding my traces, concealing my form.\nAs the **Heavenly Capital’s Jade Well Decree** commands.\"*\n\nFor **Six Wu** encampments, draw with a blade, beginning from the **Wu** of the current decan and moving leftward, encircling the perimeter in one continuous stroke to mark the boundaries. At the center, perform the **Yu Step**, and chant:\n\n*\"On the sunny slope of **Tai Mountain**,\nIn the shadow of **Heng Mountain**,\nThieves and bandits shall not rise,\nTigers and wolves shall not intrude.\nThe Heavenly Emperor obeys me,\nHiding my form in concealment,\nThe city walls stand firm as iron,\nLike the **Golden Pass** unbreached.\nTen thousand calamities, a hundred evils—\nNone dare approach.\nSwiftly, as the **Decree** commands.\"*\n\n*«Once the incantation is complete, face the **straight decan Wu** direction on the ground, take one *dou* of soil, and evenly divide it into six piles. Arrange these piles in the **Wu** of the six decans, then recite the incantation and swiftly cut a talisman beneath each pile with a blade. Bury the soil and seal the hole—one *dou* and two *sheng* of earth, evenly measured, without speaking.\n\nIf one wishes to test it, take a heifer and place its calf outside the gate. The beast will never dare enter.\n\nNow, solemnly invoke the **Eastern** gods: **Gongcao**, **Tai Chong**, and the **Heavenly Gang** Great Deity; **Qing Di**, the **Jia-Yi** generals. Invoke the **Southern** gods: **Tai Yi**, **Sheng Guang**, **Xiao Ji**, and **Chi Di**, the **Bing-Ding** Fire Deities. Invoke the **Western** gods: **Chuan Song**, **Cong Kui**, **He Kui**, and **Bai Di**, the **Geng-Xin** generals. Invoke the **Northern** gods: **Deng Ming**, **Shen Hou**, **Da Ji**, and **Hei Di**, the **Ren-Gui** generals, to descend and guard this site, protecting my person.\n\nAfter invoking the four directions’ gods, begin from today’s **decan hour** and proceed with the **divinatory tally method**—in the sequence **Zi-Xu**, **Chou-Hai**, **Yin-Wei**, **Shen-Hai**, **Wu-Chen**, **Yin-Yu**—employing the **six-tally method** until completion.\n\nFirst, establish the **Heavenly Gate (Tian Men)**, then the **Earthly Portal (Di Hu)**. If the four **central decans (Si Zhong)** fail to form the Earthly Portal, take the first tally of the **lower decan (Xia Shou)** and place it on the **upper decan (Gan Ke)**—the formation will naturally succeed.\n\nHaving completed the tally method with a shout, next traverse the **Northern Dipper (Bei Dou)**, subjugating all evils. The original scripture further states: The **God of the Northern Tian Yi**—if a person encounters malevolence with a sincere heart and faith, performs the **Yu Step**, and recites this ritual, then a hundred evils shall not dare harm.\n\nAfter completing the **Yu Step**, enter the center of the formation. Draw the sword through empty space and inscribe the **Great Concealment (Da Yin)** and **Lesser Concealment (Xiao Yin)** talismans. If the words are forgotten, carve two talismans on yellow paper with vermilion seals and burn them toward the sky.\n\n**Restriction Gate (Xiu Men)**—**Kan** Water, Earthly Escape (Di Dun).\n**Opening Gate (Kai Men)**—**Qian** Gold, Heavenly Escape (Tian Dun).\n**Life Gate (Sheng Men)**—**Gen** Soil, Thunder Escape (Lei Dun).\n**Official Gate (Guan Men)**—**Zhen** Wood, Official Escape (Guan Dun).\n**Stopping Gate (Du Men)**—**Xun** Wood, Subjugation Escape (Fu Dun).\n**Joy Gate (Jing Men)**—**Li** Fire, Rectification Escape (Zheng Dun).\n**Death Gate (Si Men)**—**Kun** Soil, Reflection Escape (Jing Dun).\n**Risk Gate (Jing Men)**—**Dui** Gold, Hazard Escape (Xian Dun).\n\nThe original scripture states: Within a **six-foot courtyard** or **six-step wild formation**, or even **sixty steps**, these are the measures. Then, with the left hand holding the **six tallies**, each one a foot and two *cun* long, and the right hand holding the blade, inhale the **vigorous qi**, strike the teeth twelve times, and pray from the heart below, “For the sake of [certain matter].”\n\nThen, return and face the **vigorous decan gods**, the four **vigorous decans**—**Spring Mao**, **Summer Wu**, **Autumn You**, **Winter Zi**—and solemnly invoke: “In the year [X], month [X], day [X], hour [X], I respectfully inform **Heavenly Father** and **Earthly Mother**, the **Six Jia** and **Six Decans**, the **Twelve Earthly Branches**, the **Qing Long** and **Peng Star**, the **Ming Tang** and **Tai Yin**, the **Heavenly Gate** and **Earthly Portal**, the **Jade Maiden** and **Hua Gai**, to conceal my body and hide my form. I depart without regard for auspicious days, and return without regard for auspicious times.\n\nNow, to travel for [certain matter], relying on the Great Deities. I solemnly consult the **celestial omens**, invoke the **Jade Maiden**, draw the earthly measures, exit through the **Heavenly Gate**, enter the **Earthly Portal**, close the **Golden Pass**, and ride upon the **Jade Maiden**.\n\nI invoke the **Jade Maiden**, **Qing Long**, **Bai Hu**, **Zhu Que**, **Xuan Wu**, **Gou Chen**, and **Sheng She**—the **Six Harmonious Talismans**—and recite the incantation:\n\n“Six Jia, Six Gods, Twelve Earthly Branches,\nRiding with me to reach [certain place].\nGuard on my left and right,\nCease when I stop, rise when I act.\nWard off thieves and bandits,\nDispel ghosts and spirits.\nThe virtuous see me and rejoice beyond measure;\nThe petty see me and tremble in fear.”»\n\nNow, when men and women see me, they shall set forth wine and offerings.\nThose who plot against me shall die, those who oppose me shall perish.\n\nToday, I perform the **Yǔbù** [步], ascending to the **Heavenly Ganges** [罡].\nThe **Jade Maiden** attends at my side,\nwhile below, I repel all inauspiciousness.\nTen thousand spirits submit in dread,\nand all evils are crushed beneath my tread.\n\nWhere I heal, peace is restored;\nwhere I attack, victory is won;\nwhere I strike, defeat is assured;\nwhere I seek, fulfillment is granted;\nwhere I wish, success is achieved.\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.*\n\nNoble **Chángwáng** [常王], great officials, and magistrates who see me\nshall love me as their own child,\nand all the people shall honor me as their parents.\n\nToday, I solemnly invoke the **Jade Maiden** and her Great Deity,\nwho shall guide me forward,\nand those who summon me shall be restored to their ranks,\nwhile the **Precious Banner** [宝旗] is dismissed.\n\nHaving summoned and petitioned the spirits, I proceed with the **Yǔbù** method.\nThree steps, nine tracks,\na **Dingzi** [丁字] step of nine paces,\neach pace seven *chǐ* [尺], three times seven—twenty-one *chǐ*.\n\nWith my right hand, I hold the **Six Calculus Talismans** [六算子],\ngrasp a sword from the **Gèn Soil** [艮土],\ntrace the earth in sequence,\nand when complete, reverse and sheath the sword in **Gèn Soil** to command the ghosts and spirits—\nall malevolence shall be subdued.\n\nHaving entered the formation, next I tread the **Big Dipper** [北斗],\nsummoning the **Nine Stars** [九星] and their **Gāng Steps** [步罡].\nWith each step, I recite aloud:\n\n*\"The Dipper’s splendor is wondrous,\nRiding the twelve *shíchén* [时辰] upon its luminous light.\nIts awe and might are manifest,\nLike floating clouds shifting seven times—\nascending to the Heavenly Hosts who know all transformations,\nentering the Dipper’s lodges with fortune or calamity.\n\nPassing the Heavenly Gate, harmonizing the Six *Lǜ* [律],\ncommanding arms and treading the Heavenly Ganges [天英].\nCrossing the Heavenly Task [天任] into the Clear and Cold Abyss [清泠渊],\none may sink or stand firm upon the Heavenly Pillar [天柱].\n\nEmbracing the Heavenly Heart [天心] from this crossing,\nstepping upon the Heavenly Game [天禽] and leaning on the Heavenly Auxiliary [天辅].\nGazing toward the Heavenly Surge [天冲] into the Heavenly Interior [天内],\nexiting through the Heavenly Cover [天蓬]—the Dipper’s path is clear.\n\nThe Heavenly Gentle [天柔] dispels ten thousand evils,\nand all ghosts, abandoned, bring forth blessings and longevity.\nPreserved for future generations, entering the dim and boundless [杳冥],\nfor ten thousand years.*\n\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.*\n\nOn **Yang days** [阳日] of the **Six Heavenly Stems** [甲丙戊庚壬]:\nFirst, establish the **Heavenly Ganges** [天英] and **Heavenly Interior** [天内].\nLeft foot, eight paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱],\nleft foot, three paces for **Heavenly Pillar** [天柱]—\n**Heavenly Heart** [天心], both feet rotating,

**Heavenly Pillar** [天柱]—\n**Heavenly Heart** [天心], right foot, six paces.\n\n**Heavenly Ganges** [天英], left foot, nine paces;\n**Heavenly Game** [天禽], left foot, five paces.\n**Heavenly Cover** [天蓬], left foot, one pace.\n**Heavenly Auxiliary** [天辅], left foot, four paces.\n**Heavenly Surge** [天冲], left foot, three paces;\n**Heavenly Task** [天任], right foot, eight paces.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n\n*\"Six *Lǜ* [律] and Nine *Cháng* [章],\nHeaven’s round and Earth’s square,\nFour seasons and Five *Xíng* [行],\nSun and Moon as radiance.\n\nThe **Yǔbù** [禹步] governs the Dao,\n**Chīyóu** [蚩尤]
