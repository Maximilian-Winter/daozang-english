  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the Scripture of Embryonic Breathing**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Commentary on the Scripture of Embryonic Breathing*\n**Commentator:** Master Huan Zhen\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Jade Instructions* Category\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. *Daoist Canon Essentials*, included in Volume 9 of its collected works.\n2. *Essence of the Daoist Canon*, included in Volume 7 of its collected works.\n\n---\n\n**Commentary on the Scripture of Embryonic Breathing**\n\nThe embryo forms within the congealed *qi*. Three inches below the navel lies the *qi*-sea, also called the lower *dantian* or the Mysterious Female (*xuanpin*). Most people mistakenly regard the mouth and nose as the Mysterious Female, but these are merely the gates through which it enters and exits. The term *xuan* refers to water, and *pin* to the mother. Ordinary people, through the mutual resonance of yin and yang *qi*, conceive within the water-mother; after three months, the embryo takes shape, and by ten months, the body is complete, giving birth to a person.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao constantly subdue their *qi* below the navel and guard their spirit within the body. When spirit and *qi* unite, they generate the mysterious embryo. Once this embryo forms, it spontaneously generates the body—this is the inner elixir, the Way of immortality.\n\nThe breath ceases within the formed embryo. The spirit is the child of *qi*, and *qi* is the mother of the spirit. Spirit and *qi* pursue one another like form and shadow. When the embryonic mother coalesces, the spirit-child naturally stills, and the primordial *qi* does not scatter.\n\n*Qi* entering the body brings life; the spirit departing the form brings death. As the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: \"The body is the dwelling of the spirit; the spirit is the master of the body. When the master is tranquil, the spirit resides within; when the master is restless, the spirit departs. If the spirit departs without scattering, how can life be attained?\" Thus, a person’s ears, eyes, hands, and feet cannot move on their own but rely on the spirit to govern them.\n\nThose who study the Dao and nurture life must constantly restrain their spirit to serve as its master. If the master does not depart, how can the dwelling collapse? Knowing that spirit and *qi* can bestow longevity, one firmly guards emptiness and non-being to cultivate them.\n\nThe *Daoist Scriptures* say: \"My life rests with me, not with heaven and earth.\" What heaven and earth breathe, people cannot comprehend; even if they comprehend, they cannot practice it. Those who understand need only empty the mind, sever thoughts, preserve *qi*, and nourish essence. Unmoved by external realms of desire, they cultivate spirit and *qi* with serenity—this is the complete Way of longevity.\n\nWhen the spirit moves, *qi* moves; when the spirit rests, *qi* rests. This is what is meant by \"intention as the riderless horse, following movement and stillness.\" To prevent the primordial *qi* from leaving the Mysterious Female, first restrain and guard the utmost spirit. If the spirit does not leave the body, *qi* will not scatter, and one will naturally feel inwardly full, free from hunger and thirst.\n\nIf one desires longevity, spirit and *qi* must flow into one another. This mutual infusion means spirit and *qi* do not separate. As the *Mysterious Principles* states: \"If even a speck of yin *qi* is not extinguished, one does not become a ghost; if even a thread of yin *qi* is not exhausted, one does not become an immortal.\" Primordial *qi* is yang *qi*, while ingested *qi* is yin *qi*. By constantly regulating breath and restraining desires, the primordial *qi* circulates internally. If primordial *qi* is robust, yin *qi* naturally dissipates. When yang is strong and yin weak, no illnesses arise, the spirit is at peace, the body is joyful, and one may attain longevity.\n\nWhen the heart does not stir thoughts, there is no coming or going, no exiting or entering—it naturally abides constantly. Spirit and *qi*, originally one substance within the mother’s womb, are drawn outward by external desires after birth and never return to their origin even for a moment. If one understands this Way, constantly extinguishing emotional thoughts and preventing the spirit from exiting, entering, coming, or going, and if one does not forget this practice, over time the spirit will naturally reside within. Diligently practicing this is the true path.\n\nThe Way of cultivating truth is fully encompassed herein. Yet the words of the sages must not be taken lightly!\n\nAfter practicing fetal breathing, when the joints open and the pores of the hair become unobstructed, merely draw *qi* subtly through the nose, allowing it to flow out through the four limbs and the pores of the hundred hairs, departing without returning. When *qi* subsequently arrives, draw it in but do not exhale. Proceed with utmost slowness—though it is said to draw without exhaling, what is drawn does not enter the throat but disperses subtly. In this way, the internal *qi* also flows downward and scatters.\n\n**Inscription on Fetal Breathing**\nThirty-six swallows, the first swallow leads.\nExhale only with utmost fineness, inhale only with unbroken softness.\nSitting outside is the same; walking or standing, remain at ease.\nGuard against clamor and chaos, avoid rank and foul odors.\nThough called fetal breathing, it is truly the inner elixir.\nNot merely for curing illness, it firmly extends the years.\nPracticed long and steadily, one’s name is listed among the highest immortals.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Fetal Breathing Classic* concludes.",
