Author unknown, approximately composed during the Sui or Tang dynasties. It expounds upon the methods of venerating the Heavenly Worthy to deliver the deceased and dispel calamities. One scroll.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord, seated amidst the Purple Empyrean Grove within the Jade Void Grotto of Supreme Clarity, was joined by the assembled immortals of the heavens and the perfected officials of the three realms. There, he proclaimed this *True Scripture of Esoteric Instructions on Cultivating the True and Mysterious*, addressing the immortal assembly:\n\n\"Beings below in the mortal realm, ignorant of the true Dao, commit manifold transgressions, sinking into boundless suffering. Those who accumulate sins know not how to cleanse them, while those who cultivate and nurture wholly deviate from the true Dao. Thus, the paths of evil overflow, and the gates of life vanish without trace.\n\nI now reveal to you these essential teachings, directly dissecting the profound purport of the Primordial Origin, to transmit them to the faithful and sincere. Through cultivating the body and preserving life, one may pacify the state and secure the household. When merit is fulfilled and deeds perfected, the body transcends the three realms, ancestors are delivered, and descendants are blessed with prosperity. This sacred and numinous text—attend to it with utmost reverence.\"\n\nThe Dao Lord spoke:\n\"Heaven and earth are bound and constricted, yet the myriad things transform and harmonize. Inheriting their karmic conditions, they converge through the workings of causes and conditions. When father and mother unite, the person receives life. The fetus complete and qi replete, the spirit descends into the void. The Great One resides in the brain, presiding over the Mud Pill Palace. The Controller of Destiny abides in the heart, receiving the source of life. On the left dwells the Non-Flourishing, on the right coalesces the White Prime. The Three Perfected and Nine Palaces are arrayed in full. The liver houses the ethereal soul, the lungs the corporeal soul; the spleen, the will; the kidneys, the essence. The heart governs the spirit, the Cinnabar Prime guards the numinous. Modeling heaven and emulating earth, bearing yin and embracing yang, the five phases intermingle in correspondence with the four seasons. The eyes are the sun and moon, the hair the stars. The brows are named the Florid Canopy, the head is Mount Kunlun. Each has its palaces and chambers, where the spirit is settled. Among the myriad things, none are more noble or numinous.\n\nLife arises from the Dao, nature is endowed by the One. At the moment of birth, the spirit is pure and quiescent. Yet as the uncarved block scatters, it pursues delusion and depletes the true. Impurity, stench, and filth disorder the form and spirit. In tranquil observation, what is distant and what is near? Guard the Dao and preserve life, do good and safeguard the true. The foolish are enslaved by things, vainly enduring hardship and toil.\n\nI disseminate the true teaching solely to exhort the worthy and the wise. Diligently seek its purport, refining and tempering day and night. By eliminating transgressions and defilements, one may prolong life. Above, transcend the three realms; below, deliver the shades of the underworld. Recite, uphold, venerate, and contemplate without regress. When merit is accomplished and deeds perfected, one shall surely attain immortality.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"The heart governs the form, dwelling place of the spirit. Qi, fluids, blood, and essence—when the heart is at peace, they are naturally regulated. Its governance is unperturbed, its people are pure; its governance is scrutinizing, its people are deficient.\n\nThe way of nurturing the heart lies in caution regarding busyness. Arrogance must not be indulged, desires must not be followed, ambitions must not be fulfilled, and pleasures must not be pursued to excess. No sin is greater than indulging desire, no misfortune greater than insatiability. If one can be content with one’s lot and curb greed, empty the heart and dispel desires, then the true source will become serene, and the numinous radiance will naturally shine. Without thought, without action, one gradually harmonizes with the true Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Qi is borne by form, form is filled by qi. When form is complete, qi lingers; when qi is harmonious, form is preserved. Heaven and earth take clarity and turbidity as their substance; without qi, they cannot circulate yin and yang. The sun and moon are distinguished by brightness and darkness; without qi, they cannot unite the ethereal and corporeal souls. Among plants, all wither and decay, yet only the pine and cypress remain evergreen—such is the firmness of their qi. Fish perish in drought, yet only the tortoise and crane remain unwearied—such is the abiding of their qi.\n\nForm is the dwelling that retains qi, qi is the tally that preserves form. To retain form and abide in the world, one must first cultivate qi. Vast and unyielding, it fills the space between heaven and earth. When qi gathers, it becomes numinous, roaming beyond the dust and wind. Thus, qi resides within the person, and the person resides within qi. The myriad things of heaven and earth are all born of qi.\n\nThose who skillfully cultivate qi nurture the body within and repel evil without, though the common people use it daily without awareness. Those who know and cultivate it, silently perfecting it, may stave off hunger and cold, ward off pestilence and plague. Venomous creatures and toxic things—qi can restrain them. Of the myriad methods and thousand defenses, qi is the origin.\n\nThe way of cultivating qi lies in being cautious in speech and moderate in diet, curbing anger and restraining desires. Seal the orifices, close the gates, maintain it subtly as if present, using it without exhaustion.\n\nThe way of nurturing form lies in blunting sharpness and harmonizing brilliance, governing before disorder arises. Be at ease without toil, toil without exhausting strength, be tranquil without disturbance, disturbed without disordering qi. Externally, there is supplementation; internally, there is benefit. In nurturing form and preserving qi, all is thus prepared.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"When form and qi are both established, one must safeguard the spirit. The mechanism of creation and transformation lies herein. When essence is whole, the spirit flourishes; when essence is depleted, the spirit wanes. Through essence, the spirit is gathered and preserved; through the spirit, the form is employed and at peace.\n\nThe kidneys are the palace of essence; overuse leads to exhaustion—concentration and conservation are fitting. The heart is the abode of the spirit; overuse leads to fatigue—quiescence and nurturance are fitting. Only through quiescence and concentration can one inwardly guard.\n\nThus it is said: The true essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure; the ultimate of the supreme Dao is dim and silent. Without seeing, without hearing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The form will naturally rectify. Be still, be pure, do not labor your form, do not agitate your essence. Reduce selfishness, diminish desires—only then can one attain long life.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"The method is fundamentally without method; its principle returns to spontaneity. The heart is disturbed by circumstances; the method arises from the heart. The intent of establishing methods is to remedy what has been lost and prevent what has yet to arise.\n\nIf one violates and damages the Three Marvels, first repair and treat them. Only when repair is complete may one advance in merit. To advance without completion is labor in vain.\"\n\nThe methods of repair and treatment are expounded in their profundity by the Primordial Unity; the prescriptions for measuring merit are fully revealed in their subtlety by the Numinous Treasure. When prior merits manifest verification, one may advance to the next stage of practice. When merit is fulfilled and perfection attained, one ascends or descends according to one’s conduct. Merit without conduct invites demonic obstacles and hinders attainment; conduct sustained by merit naturally elevates one to the ranks of immortals. When virtuous merit reaches completion, auspicious blessings descend.\n\nCultivation of nature and practice of conduct must clarify distinctions of rank. Those who seek to become Heavenly Immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek to become Earthly Immortals must establish three hundred good deeds. Follow the Dao and advance; depart from it and retreat. Do not tread the path of depravity, nor deceive in the secrecy of darkness. Accumulate deeds and amass merit, extend compassion to all beings, uphold loyalty and filial piety, foster harmony among kin, rectify oneself to transform others, show mercy to orphans and succor widows, respect the elderly and cherish the young. Even insects and plants must not be harmed. Such is the so-called virtuous person: all people revere them, the Dao of Heaven protects them, blessings and prosperity follow them, all evil departs from them, their undertakings invariably succeed, and the attainment of immortality may be hoped for.\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first cease and eliminate. Ceasing means that not a single thing arises; eliminating means that all entanglements are stilled. Only then may one gather the spirit in the sea of qi, store breath in the cinnabar field, perfect one’s nature and preserve the true, abiding in profound tranquility. Through such practice over time, one will naturally attain mastery.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy sat in serene quiescence upon the Seat of Empty Mystery, and the thirty-six thousand spirits all paid homage within the Jeweled Pearl. Thus, the two luminaries merge qi, and spirit commingles in the Cauldron of Ten Flowers. Male and female incline their hearts, uniting essence in the Furnace of Five Qi. Through refining essence, transforming sound, and altering breath, inhaling and exhaling at the Gate of Mystery, concentrating qi and embracing spirit, refining in the vessels of yin and yang, one naturally reverses white hair to black, regrows fallen teeth, restores youth and returns to infancy, attains longevity and enduring vision, preserves life and protects vitality, thereby uniting with the Dao. One shall then share the same durability as Heaven and Earth, and partake in their eternal endurance.\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Those who study the Dao establish virtue and merit, refine qi and sit in forgetfulness, cultivate the true and ingest the numinous, expound scriptures and propagate teachings, assist the state and deliver people—all such practices constitute their vocation. Though merit and conduct may be complete and the fruition of practice perfect, one must first deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of parents, liberating their departed spirits, ascending them to Heaven, and erasing their names from the ghostly registers. Only then may one’s own body attain the Dao.\n\nMoreover, in this world of mundane customs, people commit evil and accumulate transgressions, bringing calamity upon their ancestors. Out of compassion, I now proclaim these essential words to deliver and uplift the souls of the departed, which must rely upon meritorious deeds. One may place an image of the deceased, dressed in robes, beside the statues of the Three Clarities, and inscribe the Nine True Wondrous Seals according to the proper method, allowing the departed to carry them in a scroll. Then, perform the repentance ritual of this scripture, three times daily. If unable to perform the repentance, recite with sincere intent the name of the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering by Responding to Sounds three thousand times each day. After every hundred recitations, bow nine times and pray: *May the soul of so-and-so swiftly depart the dark yin realms and ascend to the celestial realms.* Those with lighter offenses will be delivered in three days; those with heavier offenses will ascend in nine days. Filial sons and daughters should urgently and sincerely perform this with utmost devotion, reverently paying homage to the sages.\n\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Supreme Sage Ancestor Lord Lao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Inclines the Heart to the Dao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Pure Thought and Cultivation.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Repents and Erases Evil Traces.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Sin and Obstacles.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues and Dissolves Obstacles.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Saves the Dark Realms.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Extinguishes the Wheel of Suffering.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers the Nine Dark Realms.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Ascends the Five Paths.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion and Great Mercy Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Kindness.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion and Great Mercy Who Delivers from Sin.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Universal Salvation.\"\n\nUpon completing the homage, express repentance with utmost sincerity:\n\"Your disciple, so-and-so, reflecting upon my foolish sojourn in the human realm, have fortunately encountered the true transformation. I am grateful for the grace of Heaven and Earth’s sheltering and bearing, and the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. Moreover, I contemplate the roots of my parents and ancestors, their birth, nurturing, and upbringing, and recall the greatness of their toil. Truly, I should repay them with deliverance. Now, before the sagely perfected, I pour out my heart in earnest supplication, praying that the countless generations of my ancestors and all departed spirits may have their transgressions accumulated over kalpas fully absolved, that their present sufferings in the realms of darkness may be wholly alleviated, that their karmic entanglements be instantly released, that they ascend by following the light of wisdom, swiftly attain the celestial shore, receive the celestial mandate to pay homage to the perfected, forever escape the cycle of rebirth, and together dwell in eternal bliss. May the qi of Heaven return to their bodies, and may they always enjoy the protection of the Dao. Your disciple is utterly overwhelmed by sorrowful sincerity and earnest supplication.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Devout men and women who offer prayers for the departed and blessings for the living, who seek fortune and avert calamity, must conduct themselves with utmost reverence and care. Bathe in fragrant water, purify body and mind, focus the intent and pour out the heart, reverently recite the true scriptures, and extol the sacred names. With perfect sincerity, one will surely attain spiritual resonance, deliver the living and the dead, dispel misfortune, and bring blessings. If one is irreverent or careless, deluded in nature or doubtful in heart, or if one approaches the scriptures with the stench of meat, alcohol, or lust, one defiles the sacred texts with idle chatter and lip service, laboring in vain and instead inviting calamity. Thus, cultivating blessings is not as effective as avoiding transgressions.\n\nIf one copies and distributes this scripture, disseminating it among learners and transmitting it for recitation, the souls of the departed will be delivered, the hells will be pacified, and the blessings accumulated will extend to future generations. Those who possess treasured adornments, clothing, or wealth should broadly bestow them upon the destitute and relieve the impoverished. Such meritorious deeds are comparable to the aforementioned practices: names are erased from the black registers, records are expunged from the Earth Bureau, spirits ascend to contend for the sacred land, and one is reborn according to their wishes, bringing benefit to descendants and severing misfortune and afflictions. The magnitude of such blessings and virtues is beyond measure.\"\n\nTherefore, one ought to diligently and attentively receive, proclaim, perform rites, and recite, universally delivering boundless beings. In accordance with the teachings, one should uphold them and, moreover, pay reverence to all Heavenly Worthies.\n\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Dao\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Supreme Jade Dawn Dao Lord of the Great Dao\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Supreme Mysterious Origin Sage Ancestor Lord Lao\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Constantly and Kindly Saves All Beings\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Limitless Salvation\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers the Deluded and Dispels Obstructions\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Transformation and Beneficent Life\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal Who Rescues and Delivers\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Unobstructed and Free Heavenly Worthy\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Pities Life and Benefits All Beings\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Vast Merit and Vast Salvation\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Showers Treasures to Relieve the Needy\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Deliverance\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Cherishes Beings and Saves the World\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Primordial and Measureless Merit\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Revives the Dead and Raises the Bones\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Refines the Body and Ascends to Perfection\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Expounds the Mysterious Origin and Propagates the Teachings\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and the Dao Who Delivers All Beings\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Heavenly Worthy Who Dispels Disasters and Prolongs Life\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Perfected One Who Pardons and Blesses, Extending Life\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Perfected One of True Stillness and Perfect Merit\nWith sincere devotion, pay reverence to:\nThe Perfected One Who Cultivates the True and Attains the Dao\n\nUpon the conclusion of the rites, with utmost sincerity and reverence, I, your disciple [Name], prostrate myself in prayer and gratitude:\n\nI have heard that within the fulfillment of conduct, filial piety and reverence come first; within the teachings and precepts, the practice of purification rites is fundamental. To repay the boundless virtue of my loving parents, one must ponder the methods of prayer and invocation. To requite their infinite kindness, I now present these solemn offerings.\n\nIn this world of mortals, all are driven by the pursuit of fame and profit. Once entangled in schemes of gain and loss, how can one avoid the faults of greed and delusion? Thus, life departs in a single breath, and the soul is consigned to the Nine Dark Realms. Relying upon the causes of supreme goodness, may the suffering of the drowned and submerged be uplifted. With a heart full of sorrowful entreaty, I dedicate this merit to my departed ancestors.\n\nReciting the sacred scriptures from the Golden Casket, I look up to implore the True Sages. Honoring the exalted titles of the Lofty and Void, I bow to repay the roots of my lineage. I humbly pray that by the power of this Dao, the drowned and sunken may be broadly delivered; that measureless transgressions be extinguished, and the long night be illuminated; that the great pardon of Heaven be bestowed, universally benefiting all beings. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, from the most distant to the nearest, all attain the ascent to transcendence. May accumulated debts and layered grievances all be granted liberation and deliverance.\n\nFurthermore, I pray that my household—young and old, kin and relations—may constantly partake in auspicious blessings and receive the sheltering shade of the Void and Nonexistence.\n\nI, your servant, gaze toward Heaven and long for the Sages, overwhelmed with fervent devotion.\n\nThe Dao declares: The mysterious scriptures have now fully circulated. They may be transmitted to the world to broadly extend salvation and deliverance.\n\nAt that time, the assembled multitude, upon hearing this Dharma-condition, penetrated the Unconditioned. Together, they ascended to the fruition of the Dao. In the Fengdu prisons of the netherworld, countless sinful souls all attained meritorious transformation and were instantly liberated. The hosts of Heavenly Immortals rejoiced, paid reverence, and withdrew.\n\nHere ends *The Wondrous Scripture of the Golden Casket and Jade Mirror: Pointers to the Mysteries of Cultivating the True*.",

      "translated_text": "The methods of repair and treatment are expounded in their profundity by the Primordial Unity; the prescriptions for measuring merit are fully revealed in their subtlety by the Numinous Treasure. When prior merits manifest verification, one may advance to the next stage of practice. When merit is fulfilled and perfection attained, one ascends or descends according to one’s conduct. Merit without conduct invites demonic obstacles and hinders attainment; conduct sustained by merit naturally elevates one to the ranks of immortals. When virtuous merit reaches completion, auspicious blessings descend.\n\nCultivation of nature and practice of conduct must clarify distinctions of rank. Those who seek to become Heavenly Immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek to become Earthly Immortals must establish three hundred good deeds. Follow the Dao and advance; depart from it and retreat. Do not tread the path of depravity, nor deceive in the secrecy of darkness. Accumulate deeds and amass merit, extend compassion to all beings, uphold loyalty and filial piety, foster harmony among kin, rectify oneself to transform others, show mercy to orphans and succor widows, respect the elderly and cherish the young. Even insects and plants must not be harmed. Such is the so-called virtuous person: all people revere them, the Dao of Heaven protects them, blessings and prosperity follow them, all evil departs from them, their undertakings invariably succeed, and the attainment of immortality may be hoped for.\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first cease and eliminate. Ceasing means that not a single thing arises; eliminating means that all entanglements are stilled. Only then may one gather the spirit in the sea of qi, store breath in the cinnabar field, perfect one’s nature and preserve the true, abiding in profound tranquility. Through such practice over time, one will naturally attain mastery.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy sat in serene quiescence upon the Seat of Empty Mystery, and the thirty-six thousand spirits all paid homage within the Jeweled Pearl. Thus, the two luminaries merge qi, and spirit commingles in the Cauldron of Ten Flowers. Male and female incline their hearts, uniting essence in the Furnace of Five Qi. Through refining essence, transforming sound, and altering breath, inhaling and exhaling at the Gate of Mystery, concentrating qi and embracing spirit, refining in the vessels of yin and yang, one naturally reverses white hair to black, regrows fallen teeth, restores youth and returns to infancy, attains longevity and enduring vision, preserves life and protects vitality, thereby uniting with the Dao. One shall then share the same durability as Heaven and Earth, and partake in their eternal endurance.\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Those who study the Dao establish virtue and merit, refine qi and sit in forgetfulness, cultivate the true and ingest the numinous, expound scriptures and propagate teachings, assist the state and deliver people—all such practices constitute their vocation. Though merit and conduct may be complete and the fruition of practice perfect, one must first deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages of parents, liberating their departed spirits, ascending them to Heaven, and erasing their names from the ghostly registers. Only then may one’s own body attain the Dao.\n\nMoreover, in this world of mundane customs, people commit evil and accumulate transgressions, bringing calamity upon their ancestors. Out of compassion, I now proclaim these essential words to deliver and uplift the souls of the departed, which must rely upon meritorious deeds. One may place an image of the deceased, dressed in robes, beside the statues of the Three Clarities, and inscribe the Nine True Wondrous Seals according to the proper method, allowing the departed to carry them in a scroll. Then, perform the repentance ritual of this scripture, three times daily. If unable to perform the repentance, recite with sincere intent the name of the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering by Responding to Sounds three thousand times each day. After every hundred recitations, bow nine times and pray: *May the soul of so-and-so swiftly depart the dark yin realms and ascend to the celestial realms.* Those with lighter offenses will be delivered in three days; those with heavier offenses will ascend in nine days. Filial sons and daughters should urgently and sincerely perform this with utmost devotion, reverently paying homage to the sages.\n\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Supreme Sage Ancestor Lord Lao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Inclines the Heart to the Dao.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of Pure Thought and Cultivation.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Repents and Erases Evil Traces.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers from Sin and Obstacles.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Rescues and Dissolves Obstacles.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Saves the Dark Realms.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Extinguishes the Wheel of Suffering.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Delivers the Nine Dark Realms.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy Who Ascends the Five Paths.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion and Great Mercy Who Saves from Suffering.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Great Kindness.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion and Great Mercy Who Delivers from Sin.\nWith sincere intent, reverently pay homage to the True Person of Great Compassion, Great Mercy, and Universal Salvation.\"\n\nUpon completing the homage, express repentance with utmost sincerity:\n\"Your disciple, so-and-so, reflecting upon my foolish sojourn in the human realm, have fortunately encountered the true transformation. I am grateful for the grace of Heaven and Earth’s sheltering and bearing, and the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. Moreover, I contemplate the roots of my parents and ancestors, their birth, nurturing, and upbringing, and recall the greatness of their toil. Truly, I should repay them with deliverance. Now, before the sagely perfected, I pour out my heart in earnest supplication, praying that the countless generations of my ancestors and all departed spirits may have their transgressions accumulated over kalpas fully absolved, that their present sufferings in the realms of darkness may be wholly alleviated, that their karmic entanglements be instantly released, that they ascend by following the light of wisdom, swiftly attain the celestial shore, receive the celestial mandate to pay homage to the perfected, forever escape the cycle of rebirth, and together dwell in eternal bliss. May the qi of Heaven return to their bodies, and may they always enjoy the protection of the Dao. Your disciple is utterly overwhelmed by sorrowful sincerity and earnest supplication.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"Devout men and women who offer prayers for the departed and blessings for the living, who seek fortune and avert calamity, must conduct themselves with utmost reverence and care. Bathe in fragrant water, purify body and mind, focus the intent and pour out the heart, reverently recite the true scriptures, and extol the sacred names. With perfect sincerity, one will surely attain spiritual resonance, deliver the living and the dead, dispel misfortune, and bring blessings. If one is irreverent or careless, deluded in nature or doubtful in heart, or if one approaches the scriptures with the stench of meat, alcohol, or lust, one defiles the sacred texts with idle chatter and lip service, laboring in vain and instead inviting calamity. Thus, cultivating blessings is not as effective as avoiding transgressions.\n\nIf one copies and distributes this scripture, disseminating it among learners and transmitting it for recitation, the souls of the departed will be delivered, the hells will be pacified, and the blessings accumulated will extend to future generations. Those who possess treasured adornments, clothing, or wealth should broadly bestow them upon the destitute and relieve the impoverished. Such meritorious deeds are comparable to the aforementioned practices: names are erased from the black registers, records are expunged from the Earth Bureau, spirits ascend to contend for the sacred land, and one is reborn according to their wishes, bringing benefit to descendants and severing misfortune and afflictions. The magnitude of such blessings and virtues is beyond measure.\"",
      "overlap_context": "res—only then can one attain long life.\"\n\nThe Dao declared:\n\"The method is fundamentally without method; its principle returns to spontaneity. The heart is disturbed by circumstances; the method arises from the heart. The intent of establishing methods is to remedy what has been lost and prevent what has yet to arise.\n\nIf one violates and damages the Three Marvels, first repair and treat them. Only when repair is complete may one advance in merit. To advance without completion is labor in vain.\"",

To repay the boundless virtue of my loving parents, one must ponder the methods of prayer and invocation. To requite their infinite kindness, I now present these solemn offerings.\n\nIn this world of mortals, all are driven by the pursuit of fame and profit. Once entangled in schemes of gain and loss, how can one avoid the faults of greed and delusion? Thus, life departs in a single breath, and the soul is consigned to the Nine Dark Realms. Relying upon the causes of supreme goodness, may the suffering of the drowned and submerged be uplifted. With a heart full of sorrowful entreaty, I dedicate this merit to my departed ancestors.\n\nReciting the sacred scriptures from the Golden Casket, I look up to implore the True Sages. Honoring the exalted titles of the Lofty and Void, I bow to repay the roots of my lineage. I humbly pray that by the power of this Dao, the drowned and sunken may be broadly delivered; that measureless transgressions be extinguished, and the long night be illuminated; that the great pardon of Heaven be bestowed, universally benefiting all beings. May the myriad generations of my ancestors, from the most distant to the nearest, all attain the ascent to transcendence. May accumulated debts and layered grievances all be granted liberation and deliverance.\n\nFurthermore, I pray that my household—young and old, kin and relations—may constantly partake in auspicious blessings and receive the sheltering shade of the Void and Nonexistence.\n\nI, your servant, gaze toward Heaven and long for the Sages, overwhelmed with fervent devotion.\n\nThe Dao declares: The mysterious scriptures have now fully circulated. They may be transmitted to the world to broadly extend salvation and deliverance.\n\nAt that time, the assembled multitude, upon hearing this Dharma-condition, penetrated the Unconditioned. Together, they ascended to the fruition of the Dao. In the Fengdu prisons of the netherworld, countless sinful souls all attained meritorious transformation and were instantly liberated.
