  "full_translation": "**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations*. The compiler is unknown, likely dating to the Tang or Song dynasties. It is attributed to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, who expounds to the Perfected One of Azure Net the method of reciting the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations. One fascicle.\n\n**Source of the Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning’s Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations**\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning resided in the Great Brahma Heaven, upon Jade Capital Mountain, beneath the Kānaka Forest Tree. He sounded the great Dharma drum and struck the great Dharma bell, universally assembling the myriad heavens and earths of the Three Realms, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, and all the holy multitudes, to expound upon the karmic retributions of good and evil, and the causes and conditions of disasters and blessings for all sentient beings of past and future.\n\nThereupon, among the assembly, there was a Perfected One named Azure Net, who rose from his seat, gazed upon the Venerable Countenance, prostrated twice in reverence, knelt, and addressed him: “Your disciple has been fortunate since past lives to encounter the realms of humans and gods. I have humbly met the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion, who has established the great Dharma bridge, broadly expounding the various causes and conditions for all beings, enabling them to awaken and universally enter the Dharma gate.\n\nNow, observing below the sentient beings of the Desire Realm, by what causes and conditions do they, in the four seasons, suffer unjust punishments and imprisonment? Within a single lifetime, they are afflicted by lingering illnesses. Or, in the provinces and counties of their allotted regions, they encounter disasters of flood and fire, the rise of warfare, and the spread of epidemics. Your disciple has yet to comprehend this. I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to specially open his compassion and enlighten my ignorance.”\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy, leaning upon his armrest, replied: “Excellent! Azure Net, you are able to inquire about the karmic conditions on behalf of sentient beings. Indeed, the beings of the Desire Realm revolve in the cycle of birth and death, submerged in the river of craving, solely pursuing the preservation of life. They do not cultivate the true Dao, nor do they understand the revolutions of the Five Phases and the influences of the Eleven Luminaries, which govern their disasters and blessings. For instance, when earth and fire remain in concealment, or metal and wood encroach upon one another, when Rāhu and Ketu rebel, or the sun and moon suffer eclipses, it results in the displacement of provinces and counties, calamities for the people, disasters of flood, fire, insects, and locusts, and the clash of weapons—all arise from these causes.\n\nAll sentient beings who take refuge as humans receive the transformations of yin and yang. Whether noble or base, rich or poor, though their allotted destinies differ, their disasters and blessings are one. As for emperors, kings, sovereigns, empresses, consorts, ministers, and officials, they are bound to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, each with their respective ranks. The Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, along with the allotted regions and all the people, are governed by the influences of the sun, moon, and Five Planets.\n\nI shall now instruct you to observe below the stellar configurations and examine their movements. If the Five Planets do not proceed in harmony and encroach upon the palaces and lodges, casting their influence upon the imperial lands and allotted regions, disasters will arise in succession, and pestilential toxins will spread, causing the death and injury of the multitudes.\n\nQuickly commission the sculpting and painting of the forms of the Eleven Luminaries. Establish a ritual arena in a pure and undefiled place, meticulously prepare incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, and invite Daoist priests—or recite yourself *The Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations*—for one, two, or three seven-day periods. Perform purification rites, practice the Dao, offer reverent recitations, and repent. Thereby, you will dispel celestial disasters above, safeguard and stabilize the imperial lands, eliminate toxic harms below, and deliver the multitudes. You should heed and believe in this, and in turn teach others to uphold, recite, and transmit it.”\n\nThe Perfected One of Azure Net knocked his head in reverence, prostrated twice, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to broadly expound and proclaim this.”\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy pronounced the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Disaster-Dispelling Divine Incantations:\n\n**Incantation of the Nine Stars**\nThe Nine Luminaries proceed in harmony,\nThe Primordial Beginning wanders to and fro.\nThe radiance of flowery essence gleams bright,\nThe primordial spirits disperse and unfold.\nTheir flowing gaze is boundless,\nBestowing upon me their luminous splendor.\nAbove, they ascend to the vermilion effulgence,\nDissolving obstructions and opening the heart.\nI attain to ride the flying clouds,\nAscending my body to the Purple Tenuity.\nAll affairs under heaven\nAre made known to me beforehand.\n\n**Incantation of the Five Planets**\nThe Five Planets array their radiance,\nIlluminating the five directions.\nMercury dispels disasters,\nThe virtue of Jupiter brings prosperity.\nMars eliminates calamities,\nVenus averts warfare.\nSaturn guards the four quarters,\nBringing benefit and prosperity to families and states.\nNames are inscribed on jade tablets,\nCharacters recorded in the imperial chambers.\nRiding the whirlwind and fanning the light,\nThey soar through the great void.\nEntering and exiting the unseen,\nThey roam and feast in the ten directions.\nFive-colored clouds cover and shield,\nSummoning spirits and seizing the winds.\nCommanding the myriad spirits,\nThey protect and guard the immortal elders above.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of the Sun**\nGazing east toward the Fusang Palace,\nI bow my head and pay homage to Yu Yi.\nThe sun’s cavernous bright radiance,\nVast and boundless—what thoughts arise?\nI command myself to bow before its golden hue,\nAwaiting the heavens and gazing upon its majestic form.\nThe imperial splendor and jade maidens\nDescend to the terrace at this very moment.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of the Moon**\nLooking up to survey the eight directions,\nOnly the moon nurtures the essence of yin.\nWithin it resides the Supreme Primordial Sovereign,\nThe Lady driving a carriage of green.\nIts radiant splendor illumines the two poles,\nIts blended brightness shines upon the Three Clarities.\nDiligently seeking the supreme Dao,\nThe five colors descend to welcome me.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Jupiter**\nThe Year Star rides the virtue of wood,\nRevolving and illuminating the eastern lands.\nIts celestial demeanor is moist and lush,\nIts true color gleams with august brightness.\nSeeking blossoms, it sings of vast expanse,\nTossing waters, it chants of the chambers of mushrooms.\nThrough constant prayers and supplications,\nBlessings naturally and perpetually grow.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Mars**\nIts points bristle like dragons and phoenixes,\nIts majestic light rebukes the ten directions.\nThe vermilion *gang* shines through the five nights,\nThe red fire flames along the three edges.\nIts crystalline clarity accords with the true *qi*,\nIts swords and halberds gleam with martial authority.\nIts fierce and grasping nature obliterates traces,\nHow dare comets and broom stars stand before it?\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Venus**\nVenus ascends the clear Han,\nFrost soars and gleams with pristine radiance.\nLofty and serene, it floats with auspicious splendor,\nBright and luminous, it flourishes as the Long-Lived Star.\nIts keen edge can repel invaders,\nIts lustrous hue often brings down armies.\nExhaustively investigating the tally of celestial reckoning,\nIt harmonizes with the Dao and long life.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Mercury**\nWondrous indeed, it accords with the five *qi*,\nVaguely glimpsed at the Gate of Chen.\nTowering and majestic in the *chou* position,\nThe spirit lord of *ren* and *gui* governs the cavernous numen.\nIts divided radiance congeals in purity,\nIts subtle influences hasten to fulfill my thoughts.\nWith immortal songs and dances,\nAfter a long while, it descends from the golden heavens.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Saturn**\nLofty heavens align with *wu* and *ji*,\nFrom hidden lands rise layered skies.\nThe Five Phases honor its veiled radiance,\nThe Nine Lands witness its luminous glow.\nGan and Shi predict its lingering presence,\nTaoist and shaman reckon its vast emptiness.\nCelestial immortals bestow rain and dew,\nProstrate on earth, I bow to the void’s sway.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Rahu**\nThe divine head follows the dark path,\nIn profound obscurity, transcending to numinous might.\nDim and bright alternate at new and full moons,\nYang’s virtue obscures yin’s essence.\nHigh above, it guards the Yellow Banner’s gate,\nSpears and halberds gleam with frosty bells.\nWith devoted heart, I await abundant blessings,\nKowtowing, I chant the true scripture.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Ketu**\nDwelling in darkness, it manifests yin’s power,\nThe leopard’s tail anchors the stellar palace.\nIn wrath, it points to shatter mountains,\nIts authority reigns over the darkened heavens.\nDragons and serpents assume monstrous forms,\nTransformations arise in sudden gloom.\nIt bestows long life and fortune upon the host,\nExorcising calamities through reverence and awe.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Purple Qi**\nEmpowered by the Primordial Sovereign,\nIt embodies essence and shines in the Purple Tenuity.\nYin and yang reach their cyclic extremes,\nObscure and manifest unfold the numinous mechanism.\nThe jade chariot ascends the vast Han,\nGolden bells tread the Dipper’s flight.\nThe Four Quarters follow the celestial circuit,\nThe Nine Lands revere heaven’s majesty.\n\n**Incantation of the Perfected Lord of Moon Comets**\nThe Great Yin’s light weaves jade’s warp,\nIts essence and spirit nurture all beings.\nBlue osmanthus and yellow blossoms assist,\nLush canopies safeguard its pristine numen.\nIts hairy head divides into strange forms,\nThe comet’s tail may secretly traverse the heavens.\nDwelling in its course, it dispenses fortune and misfortune,\nThrough purification and devotion, it penetrates the profound void.\n\n**Threefold Hymn of Praise**\nWondrous indeed, the resonance of the Three Caverns,\nVast and clear, how it rings!\nSeeking its sound, it seems as if nothing exists,\nYet in motion, its form remains unseen.\nIts echoing tone pervades the ten directions,\nYet when heard, no sound is perceived.\n\n**Again**\nThe Great Dao requires human propagation,\nFree the mind to return to the Great Void.\nAt dawn, pay homage and traverse the ten directions,\nAscend and transcend upon the Nine Dragons.\nSoaring beyond the Three Realms,\nOne is exalted amidst the clouds.\n\n**Again**\nMy master is the Heavenly Honored One,\nTranscendent, the Supreme Emperor.\nGazing upward beyond earth’s bounds,\nDimly glimpsed is the Purple Flame Hall.\nTowering is the Chamber of Mystery,\nWhere only the abodes of immortals are seen.\n\nThe Heavenly Honored One addressed the Perfected Lord of Azure Net: \"These incantations of the various spirits, if recited with sincere devotion, will ensure the stars move in harmony, illnesses vanish, the state enjoys peace, and the people thrive in the Dao.\"\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Azure Net kowtowed and bowed again, and all the assembled immortals, upon hearing the scripture and incantations, rejoiced greatly, paid their respects, and withdrew.\n\nThereupon, the Perfected Lord of Azure Net transmitted these teachings to the world, exhaustively investigating the celestial reckoning, faithfully receiving and practicing them.\n\nHere ends *The Primordial Heavenly Honored One’s Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries’ Great Exorcism Incantations*.",
