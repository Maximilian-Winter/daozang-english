There, a grand assembly of immortals was convened, where the wondrous Dharma was expounded to deliver and enlighten both gods and humans, guiding them to awaken to the Dao without enduring manifold sufferings. Manifesting great majestic power and radiating boundless luminosity, the light illumined all ten thousand realms.\n\nAll sins and blessings stood plainly before them, profound and subtly wondrous. Through expedient means, all the destitute souls of the hells—enduring immeasurable agonies and inexpressible torments—were delivered, rescued from drowning in the depths, and universally liberated.\n\nThen, the Merciful Honored One of the Origin, in boundless compassion, further expounded the essential Dao, bestowing benefits upon both past and future. Again, he addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying:\n\n\"Humans receive life, all endowed with the same qi. Yet upon birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all arise from the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the root of their former existence, and all receive retribution according to their karmic deeds, never deviating, as the shadow follows the form or the echo responds to the valley.\n\nOn the Three Origin Days each year, the officials of the Three Origins, along with the deities of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the spirits of good and evil, and all numinous officials ascend to the Golden Tower before the Primordial Celestial Worthy to examine the registers of life and death for men and women, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, and the ledgers of names and deeds of the destitute souls in the Nine Dark Hells, the Water Palaces, and other realms.\n\nAt this time, if there are faithful men and women who naturally awaken to the Dao, erecting Purple Tenuity Treasure Terraces, Jade Capital Treasure Mountains, pavilions and towers adorned with a hundred treasures, offering incense and flowers, burning incense and circumambulating, chanting cavernous scriptures, lighting lamps and releasing living beings, performing the *Step-of-Emptiness* rites, practicing almsgiving and making vows, repenting transgressions and submitting memorials, holding grand fasts and jiao offerings, and devoutly petitioning Heaven and Earth day and night without ceasing—then I shall dispatch the Celestial Worthies and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the divine immortals of the Three Realms, the Four Controllers, and the Youths Who Save from Suffering to descend to the human realm, all arriving at the Dao-field to extinguish their sins and protect the living.\n\nThus shall the lands be peaceful, men and women joyous and at ease, all blessings descend, and all evils cease to arise. The suffering souls of hell shall be liberated in an instant, reborn in the heavens to enjoy boundless bliss, their merit towering and their blessings immeasurable.\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One continued: \"On the fifteenth day of the first month, the Celestial Official of the Upper Origin and the Recording Officials of the Hundred Bureaus ascend to the celestial palaces to present the registers of sin and blessing for the world’s people.\"\n\nFor this reason, the sponsor of this repentance rite now dedicates the merit, reverently prostrating to all the lofty perfected ones of the Upper Origin Heaven, taking refuge in the spirit, body, and life, and paying homage to the supremely merciful and compassionate Celestial Worthy beyond compare.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Jade Purity Primordial Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Bestows Boundless Blessings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Dispels Disasters and Resolves Calamities.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Increases Longevity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who

Worthies above, we now repent:\n\nFrom beginningless time until this day, for myself, my teachers, preceptors, parents, and the six relations, for all transgressions committed through the three karmic actions and the six senses—\nThus has the body craved softness and smoothness, the mind given rise to false imaginings, the eyes beheld evil forms, the ears listened to perverse sounds, the nose favored foul odors, the tongue coveted rich flavors, the heart harbored jealousy, and the mouth uttered defiled speech.\nSuch sins as these are boundless and immeasurable.\nToday, with utmost sincerity, we earnestly repent them all.\n\nNext, we dedicate the merit, reverently prostrating to all the lofty perfected ones of the Upper Origin Heaven, taking refuge in the spirit, body, and life, and paying homage to the supremely merciful and compassionate Celestial Worthy beyond compare.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost

At times, we cursed oxen, horses, the six livestock, flying birds, running beasts, and all creeping creatures. At times, we imprisoned the innocent, bound the foolish, and oppressed the good. For these manifold sins of coarse words, invoking Heaven and Earth, summoning spirits, and reviling—boundless and immeasurable,\ntoday we devoutly seek repentance.\nWe further dedicate this merit to all the Sagely and Divine beings of the Middle Prime’s earthly realm.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Fragrant Forests and Meditative Contemplation.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Effortless Universal Salvation.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Preserving and Ascendant Birth.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Unobstructed Supreme Virtue.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Impartial Salvation from Suffering.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Sagely Exposition and Primordial Opening.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Sixfold Penetration and Realized Awakening.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Multiform Penetration and Virtue.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Jeweled Summit and Great Perfection.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Utmost Truth and Profound Stillness.\n\nFrom the above, we have reverently recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.\nWe devoutly seek repentance for the manifold sins and karmic offenses within this body.\nWe humbly beseech the Ninefold Clarity and Three Caverns’ Compassionate Worthies, the Five Elders and Ten Flowers of the Great Dao, the August Lord of Heaven, the ranks of lofty perfected beings, the Nine Emperorial Immortals, the Ten Palaces’ True Lords, the Three Primordials’ Great Emperors, the Sacred Peaks of the Five Marchmounts, the blessed lands and grotto-heavens, Mount Fengdu and the Five Sacred Peaks, the Four Bureaus’ officials, the Nine Courts’ assembled ranks, the host of transcendent immortals, and the multitude of sages within the alchemical crucible: may your vast grace universally suffuse, your beneficent blessings overflow, release us from worldly transgressions, dispel our mundane afflictions, take pity on all beings, deliver the suffering in darkness, and in life after life, may all ascend to the Great Dao.\n\nThe *Water Repentance for the Elimination of Sins in the Merciful Altar of the Most High* concludes here.\nThe *Water Repentance for the Elimination of Sins in the Merciful Altar of the Most High*, Scroll the Lower.\n\nAt that time, the Compassionate Worthy declared: On the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the Water Official of the Lower Prime, overseeing the hundred bureaus, ascends to the celestial palace to present the ledgers of the world’s sins and blessings.\nFor this reason, the sponsor of this repentance rite dedicates this merit to all the Immortal and Sagely beings of the Lower Prime’s watery realm.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Clarity and the Dao and its Virtue.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Ever-Present and Constant Appearance.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Wondrous Protection and Supreme Perfection.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Returning Spirits and Reviving the Dead.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Majestic Authority and Self-Mastery.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Peaceful Stabilization and All Sentient Beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Longevity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Constant Goodness and Salvation of Beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of All-Embracing Virtue and Transformative Power.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Engendering the Myriad Beings.\n\nFrom this point onward, we recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies in worship. We beseech forgiveness for all sins—from beginningless time until this very day—committed by ourselves, our masters and teachers, our parents, our six relations, and our boundless kin, which have obstructed the human realm in countless ways.\n\nMoreover, in the course of trade and commerce, whether as traveling merchants or settled traders, in buying and selling goods, in transactions at inns and markets, in measures of volume and weight—scales, bushels, ounces, and grains—there may have been additions or subtractions, deceptions or concealments from others. Perhaps we exchanged the coarse for the fine, the short for the long, defrauded others in calculations, breached walls to steal, or committed robbery and theft. Perhaps we blocked roads, denied debts, or lent capital at exorbitant interest. Perhaps we feigned false skills to swindle others of their wealth, or envied the intelligence, wealth, or status of others, abusing official power to slander them. Perhaps we secretly set traps or shot arrows, offending the divine. Perhaps we consumed wine and meat, the five pungent vegetables, or the three forbidden foods, defiling sacred merit. Perhaps, as officials or clerks, we administered justice unfairly. Perhaps, in high position, we were irreverent, or in low station, disrespectful—lacking rank in the court or standing in the community.\n\nSuch boundless and measureless transgressions as these I now devoutly confess and repent in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who expounds the Dao in primordial chaos.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma grace flows far and wide.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who attains sagehood through accumulated merit.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who concentrates spirit to illumine the realm.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who harmonizes spirit to benefit all beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who skillfully unravels the net of existence.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose merit and practice are perfectly fulfilled.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who repays merit with virtue.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who conceals traces to preserve the Dao.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy crowned with a floating canopy of purple radiance.\n\nFrom this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.\n\nI beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day—those committed against my parents, teachers, and preceptors, whether living or deceased, whether of the Daoist or secular realms, and all my kin. Perhaps I have lightly esteemed the Three Treasures, my devotion lacking constancy. Perhaps I have betrayed my teachers and preceptors, violating vows and breaking covenants. Perhaps I have been disloyal to my sovereign, unyielding to the times, failing to honor the Great Dao, or treating its teachings with contempt. Perhaps I have defiled rivers and streams, dredged the hundred waterways, taken fish and scales to satisfy my palate. Perhaps I have acted without shame or remorse, disdaining clothing and food, wasting the five grains, cursing oxen and horses, harming silkworms and moths, or neglecting agriculture and sericulture. Perhaps I have seen profit and forgotten righteousness, lacking integrity and honor, favoring the new while abandoning the old, or knowing kindness yet failing to repay it.\n\nSuch boundless and measureless transgressions as these I now devoutly confess and repent in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of unparalleled honor and wonder.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who bestows grace from the Jade Capital.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who saves through the treasure of adaptable power.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the radiant Brahma-light of the Great Tenuity.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose true form is perfectly fulfilled.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of supreme and unconditioned victory.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of tranquil harmony and pure joy.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of serene non-attainment.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the unfathomable dark source.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of silent contemplation and non-action.\n\nFrom this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.\n\nI beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day—those committed against the living and the dead, the Daoist and the secular, for failing to reflect on the toil and suffering of my parents, repaying none of their nurturing care: the ten months of pregnancy, three years of breastfeeding, turning dry for wet, swallowing bitterness to spit out sweetness, washing and tending, their boundless love and concern—only to commit the five heinous acts of filial impiety in return. Perhaps as son or daughter, for the sake of qi or wealth, I have indulged in wine and lust, entangled in enmity and curses, implicating my parents in endless resentment. Perhaps in building homes or graves, I have violated many taboos, filling the measure of my sins to overflowing, inviting calamity to flow forth. Perhaps my retribution has come through lawsuits and summons, my deceased ancestors drawn into the fray. Perhaps my fate has grown weak and perilous, malevolent stars traversing my path, manifesting in this life as various karmic flowers, while in hell, they ripen into various karmic fruits.\n\nThe Merciful Worthy declares: Such retributions for the body in this life all stem from sins committed in past lives. After death, one passes through hell, and in the next life, suffers retribution across the six paths, endlessly revolving in the wheel of rebirth.\n\nToday, I devoutly confess and repent of all these transgressions in their entirety. Next, I dedicate this merit to all the immortals and sages of the Lower Primordial Water Realm, taking refuge in the divine, taking refuge in the spirit, taking refuge in the body, taking refuge in life—O Most Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose merit and deeds are boundless.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma rain pours abundantly.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of vast and perfect fulfillment.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who pities the suffering of all beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who concentrates the Dharma-treasury in emptiness.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy, the King of Non-Attainment and Grace.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who responds and transforms according to conditions.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who illumines the world with clarity.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy who adapts to impermanence.\nWith utmost sincerity, I bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of vast compassion and magnanimity.\n\nFrom this point onward, I reverently recite the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies.\n\nI beseech forgiveness for all my transgressions from beginningless time until this day.\n\nThen the Merciful Worthy spoke again: I see that the people of the lower world suffer many misfortunes, harmed by malevolent spirits. For the sake of your deceased ancestors, parents, and honored kin, on the five La days—when heaven and earth grant amnesty—you should establish vegetarian feasts and Daoist rites, perform the Dao, offer reverent repentance, and submit petitions to rescue and deliver the deceased, that they may all attain liberation.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, the Heavenly La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Azure Dragon Gate of the Peaceful Treasure Flower Grove in the Azure Heaven to review the records of human sins and blessings.\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, the Earthly La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Cinnabar Heaven at the Brahma Treasure Prosperous Cinnabar Terrace Gate to review the records of human sins and blessings.\nOn the seventh day of the seventh month, the Daoist La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Golden Gate of the Plain Heaven at the Plain Spirit Gate to review the records of human sins and blessings.\nOn the first day of the tenth month, the People’s Year La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Dark Gate of the Mysterious Heaven at the Black Spirit Gate of the Cavernous Yin to review the records of human sins and blessings.\nOn the La day in the twelfth month, the Royal La day, the Five Emperor Divine Immortals gather in the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital of the Primordial Spirit at the Wuji Metal Gate of the Primordial Origin in the Eightfold Radiance Hall of the Primordial Beginning to review the records of human sins and blessings.\n\nThese days are all occasions for assembling and determining the registers of good and ill fortune, life and death—all pertaining to the living.\n\nOn this day, the Nine Generations of ancestors—parents, spirits of the dark prisons, and wandering ghosts—are summoned by the Northern Emperor of Fengdu for interrogation. Long confined in the nether realms, their sins accumulated over ages, their offenses entangled with the names of descendants and the locations of ancestral tombs. If, after kalpas of time, no redemption has been sought, the living are implicated on this day: the names of descendants, kin, and the nine clans are called forth, their sins recorded as the living’s transgressions, their offenses bound to the Dark Capital, the nine clans doomed to annihilation.\n\nOn this day, one may submit petitions for deceased parents, offering repentance and supplication for their deliverance, that each departed soul may receive relief. Ordinary sacrifices cannot reach them, for Fengdu’s depths are too profound, its barriers too impassable. Only through the true Dao may their long-standing transgressions be absolved, for the nether officials do not wish to detain them indefinitely. Prolonged confinement of the dead incurs reproach from the celestial courts, and the officials of the dark realms are likewise held accountable. Thus, the living’s fortune turns to misfortune, and calamity arises therefrom. Yet if filial sons and daughters observe this day with fasting and rites, the names in the Black Registers are erased, and all may attain transcendence.\n\nToday, the master of this repentance ritual, [Name], dedicates the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to devotion and follows karmic conditions.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cultivates ascetic practice and accumulates merit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who sees through all without attachment.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who answers distress with grace.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon’s radiance.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy free from stagnation and form.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and liberates without limit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of constant compassion and mercy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Dharma Body.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma Body pervades all.\n\nHaving recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for [Name], from beginningless time until this day, for the six relations and kin of both the living and the dead, for the karmic causes of rebirth through the Six Paths, for the four modes of birth, ceaselessly taking form, unrestrained in the three karmas, indulging the six senses—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, greed, delusion, anger, harsh speech, divisive words, falsehood, frivolous talk, disbelief in causality, failure to practice expedient means, betraying heaven and earth, breaking fasts and precepts, deceiving outsiders, scheming against masters, casting curses, summoning ghosts and spirits, neglecting the four kinds of life, unmindful of a single breath—each thought a transgression, each deed a fault. All these sins reside within the body, with no means of absolution. Some fall into hell, others become beasts; without encountering sacred scriptures, how can they attain liberation? Such offenses are boundless. Today, with utmost devotion, we repent them all, then dedicate the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure’s Imperial Heaven.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Truth and Myriad Blessings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mystic Upper Jade Palace.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers immortals and sagely beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cherishes life and delivers beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Flower.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void’s Luminous Sovereign.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign’s Mystic Spirit.\n\nHaving recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for all manner of sins. Prostrate, we implore the Compassionate Worthies of the Three Realms, the Perfected Saints of the Ten Directions, the Great Emperors of the Three Primes, the Five Venerable Elders, the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus, the Seventy-Two Courts, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Eight Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, and all Perfected Immortals—to universally extend salvation, to manifest great compassion, to unfurl the clouds of the Dharma, to scatter the rain of the Dharma, to dispel burning afflictions, to wash away transgressions and faults, to instantly bring coolness, to clarify like clouds dispersed, to accumulate blessings for the living, to elevate the departed, to secure the nation and enrich the people, to rejoice in great peace, to fulfill merit and perfect virtue, to awaken to the Dao in every life, to hear the scriptures in every generation, that all sentient beings may ascend to the Dao’s shore.\n\nThus concludes the *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Compassionate Repentance Ritual for the Elimination of Sins through the Water Rites*.",

There, a grand assembly of immortals was convened, where the wondrous Dharma was expounded to deliver and enlighten both gods and humans, guiding them to awaken to the Dao without enduring manifold sufferings. Manifesting great majestic power and radiating boundless luminosity, the light illumined all ten thousand realms.\n\nAll sins and blessings stood plainly before them, profound and subtly wondrous. Through expedient means, all the destitute souls of the hells—enduring immeasurable agonies and inexpressible torments—were delivered, rescued from drowning in the depths, and universally liberated.\n\nThen, the Merciful Honored One of the Origin, in boundless compassion, further expounded the essential Dao, bestowing benefits upon both past and future. Again, he addressed the perfected attendants at his side, saying:\n\n\"Humans receive life, all endowed with the same qi. Yet upon birth, their fate is bound to the Three Origins. Longevity or premature death, fortune or misfortune, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all arise from the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, good and evil, life and death. Each follows the root of their former existence, and all receive retribution according to their karmic deeds, never deviating, as the shadow follows the form or the echo responds to the valley.\n\nOn the Three Origin Days each year, the officials of the Three Origins, along with the deities of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the spirits of good and evil, and all numinous officials ascend to the Golden Tower before the Primordial Celestial Worthy to examine the registers of life and death for men and women, the karmic conditions of sin and blessing, and the ledgers of names and deeds of the destitute souls in the Nine Dark Hells, the Water Palaces, and other realms.\n\nAt this time, if there are faithful men and women who naturally awaken to the Dao, erecting Purple Tenuity Treasure Terraces, Jade Capital Treasure Mountains, pavilions and towers adorned with a hundred treasures, offering incense and flowers, burning incense and circumambulating, chanting cavernous scriptures, lighting lamps and releasing living beings, performing the *Step-of-Emptiness* rites, practicing almsgiving and making vows, repenting transgressions and submitting memorials, holding grand fasts and jiao offerings, and devoutly petitioning Heaven and Earth day and night without ceasing—then I shall dispatch the Celestial Worthies and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the divine immortals of the Three Realms, the Four Controllers, and the Youths Who Save from Suffering to descend to the human realm, all arriving at the Dao-field to extinguish their sins and protect the living.\n\nThus shall the lands be peaceful, men and women joyous and at ease, all blessings descend, and all evils cease to arise. The suffering souls of hell shall be liberated in an instant, reborn in the heavens to enjoy boundless bliss, their merit towering and their blessings immeasurable.\"\n\nThe Merciful Honored One continued: \"On the fifteenth day of the first month, the Celestial Official of the Upper Origin and the Recording Officials of the Hundred Bureaus ascend to the celestial palaces to present the registers of sin and blessing for the world’s people.\"\n\nFor this reason, the sponsor of this repentance rite now dedicates the merit, reverently prostrating to all the lofty perfected ones of the Upper Origin Heaven, taking refuge in the spirit, body, and life, and paying homage to the supremely merciful and compassionate Celestial Worthy beyond compare.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Jade Purity Primordial Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Bestows Boundless Blessings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Dispels Disasters and Resolves Calamities.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Increases Longevity.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Purple Purity Celestial Worthy Who Descends Blessings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Eight Trigrams Who Guards the Body.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Nine Palaces Who Defends Against Calamities.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of Lofty Perfection and Wondrous Fruition.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions.\n\nHaving thus paid homage to the sacred titles of the Celestial Worthies above, we now repent:\n\nFrom beginningless time until this day, for myself, my teachers, preceptors, parents, and the six relations, for all transgressions committed through the three karmic actions and the six senses—\nThus has the body craved softness and smoothness, the mind given rise to false imaginings, the eyes beheld evil forms, the ears listened to perverse sounds, the nose favored foul odors, the tongue coveted rich flavors, the heart harbored jealousy, and the mouth uttered defiled speech.\nSuch sins as these are boundless and immeasurable.\nToday, with utmost sincerity, we earnestly repent them all.\n\nNext, we dedicate the merit, reverently prostrating to all the lofty perfected ones of the Upper Origin Heaven, taking refuge in the spirit, body, and life, and paying homage to the supremely merciful and compassionate Celestial Worthy beyond compare.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Luminous August Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Mysterious Numinous Primordial Elder Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of Solemn Purity and Dharma Wisdom.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of Responsive Power and Might.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Fearless Brahmā-Form Celestial Worthy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Ocean of Great Wisdom.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Boundless Dharma Treasury.\n\nHaving thus paid homage to the sacred titles of the Celestial Worthies above, we now repent:\n\nFrom beginningless time until this day, for myself, my teachers, preceptors, parents, and the six relations, for the boundless and immeasurable sins of killing—\nWhether slaughtering pigs, sheep, oxen, horses, chickens, dogs, geese, or ducks;\nOr killing flying birds, running beasts, aquatic creatures, fish and scales, or all crawling beings endowed with life;\nOr aiding the sick, engaging in licentious sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, and killing living beings;\nOr hunting for sport, plowing fields and digging the earth, raising silkworms and boiling cocoons, setting fires or releasing waters, burning dung or sweeping the ground, and killing living beings;\nOr drinking wine and eating meat;\nOr making fermented sauces and pickled fish, burning firewood and lighting lamps, pouring boiling water on the ground, and killing living beings;\nOr separating mothers from their young, cutting off their gestation;\nOr killing embryos and eggs;\nOr slaughtering living beings beyond count;\nOr killing creditors, enemies, or good people from the four directions;\nOr killing through contention, deceit, jealousy, plunder, or robbery;\nOr killing through warfare, slander, or expedient means—\nWe earnestly repent all such sins.",

Perhaps I have lightly esteemed the Three Treasures, my devotion lacking constancy. Perhaps I have betrayed my teachers and preceptors, violating vows and breaking covenants. Perhaps I have been disloyal to my sovereign, unyielding to the times, failing to honor the Great Dao, or treating its teachings with contempt. Perhaps I have defiled rivers and streams, dredged the hundred waterways, taken fish and scales to satisfy my palate. Perhaps I have acted without shame or remorse, disdaining clothing and food, wasting the five grains, cursing oxen and horses, harming silkworms and moths, or neglecting agriculture and sericulture.

Perhaps as son or daughter, for the sake of qi or wealth, I have indulged in wine and lust, entangled in enmity and curses, implicating my parents in endless resentment. Perhaps in building homes or graves, I have violated many taboos, filling the measure of my sins to overflowing, inviting calamity to flow forth.

      "translated_text": "On this day, the Nine Generations of ancestors—parents, spirits of the dark prisons, and wandering ghosts—are summoned by the Northern Emperor of Fengdu for interrogation. Long confined in the nether realms, their sins accumulated over ages, their offenses entangled with the names of descendants and the locations of ancestral tombs. If, after kalpas of time, no redemption has been sought, the living are implicated on this day: the names of descendants, kin, and the nine clans are called forth, their sins recorded as the living’s transgressions, their offenses bound to the Dark Capital, the nine clans doomed to annihilation.\n\nOn this day, one may submit petitions for deceased parents, offering repentance and supplication for their deliverance, that each departed soul may receive relief. Ordinary sacrifices cannot reach them, for Fengdu’s depths are too profound, its barriers too impassable. Only through the true Dao may their long-standing transgressions be absolved, for the nether officials do not wish to detain them indefinitely. Prolonged confinement of the dead incurs reproach from the celestial courts, and the officials of the dark realms are likewise held accountable. Thus, the living’s fortune turns to misfortune, and calamity arises therefrom. Yet if filial sons and daughters observe this day with fasting and rites, the names in the Black Registers are erased, and all may attain transcendence.\n\nToday, the master of this repentance ritual, [Name], dedicates the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who responds to devotion and follows karmic conditions.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cultivates ascetic practice and accumulates merit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who sees through all without attachment.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who answers distress with grace.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sun and Moon’s radiance.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy free from stagnation and form.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who transforms and liberates without limit.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of constant compassion and mercy.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Dharma Body.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy whose Dharma Body pervades all.\n\nHaving recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for [Name], from beginningless time until this day, for the six relations and kin of both the living and the dead, for the karmic causes of rebirth through the Six Paths, for the four modes of birth, ceaselessly taking form, unrestrained in the three karmas, indulging the six senses—killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, greed, delusion, anger, harsh speech, divisive words, falsehood, frivolous talk, disbelief in causality, failure to practice expedient means, betraying heaven and earth, breaking fasts and precepts, deceiving outsiders, scheming against masters, casting curses, summoning ghosts and spirits, neglecting the four kinds of life, unmindful of a single breath—each thought a transgression, each deed a fault. All these sins reside within the body, with no means of absolution. Some fall into hell, others become beasts; without encountering sacred scriptures, how can they attain liberation? Such offenses are boundless. Today, with utmost devotion, we repent them all, then dedicate the merit, invoking the Perfected Immortals of the Lower Prime’s Water Realm, paying homage to the divine, surrendering body and life, to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Supreme Heavenly Worthy:\n\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure’s Imperial Heaven.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Mystic Truth and Myriad Blessings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Mystery.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mystic Upper Jade Palace.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who delivers immortals and sagely beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy who cherishes life and delivers beings.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless Great Flower.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void’s Luminous Sovereign.\nWith utmost sincerity, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign’s Mystic Spirit.\n\nHaving recited the sacred titles of the Heavenly Worthies above, we beseech repentance for all manner of sins. Prostrate, we implore the Compassionate Worthies of the Three Realms, the Perfected Saints of the Ten Directions, the Great Emperors of the Three Primes, the Five Venerable Elders, the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus, the Seventy-Two Courts, the Four Offices and Five Emperors, the Eight Seas and Nine Rivers, the Twelve River Sources, and all Perfected Immortals—to universally extend salvation, to manifest great compassion, to unfurl the clouds of the Dharma, to scatter the rain of the Dharma, to dispel burning afflictions, to wash away transgressions and faults, to instantly bring coolness, to clarify like clouds dispersed, to accumulate blessings for the living, to elevate the departed, to secure the nation and enrich the people, to rejoice in great peace, to fulfill merit and perfect virtue, to awaken to the Dao in every life, to hear the scriptures in every generation, that all sentient beings may ascend to the Dao’s shore.\n\nThus concludes the *Lower Scroll of the Supreme Compassionate Repentance Ritual for the Elimination of Sins through the Water Rites*.",
