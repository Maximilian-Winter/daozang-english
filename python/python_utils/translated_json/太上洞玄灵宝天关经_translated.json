  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Celestial Pass**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Celestial Pass*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. It expounds upon the formation of the cosmos and the realms of heaven and earth, exhorting humanity to take refuge in the Celestial Worthy. One scroll.\n\n**The Supreme Cavern Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Celestial Pass**\n\nThe Great Dao is wondrous in its function.\nThere is the Supreme Simplicity, wherein qi has yet to manifest.\nThe Supreme Beginning is the origin of qi.\nThe Supreme Commencement is the origin of form.\nThe Supreme Plainness is the origin of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet dispersed, this is called *hun-tun* (primordial chaos), wherein the myriad things remain undifferentiated.\n\nThe light and pure ascend to become heaven; the heavy and turbid descend to become earth.\nThus, the chapter \"On the Creation of Heaven and Earth\" states: The Venerable Lord is the root of heaven and earth, and the myriad things are none that do not arise and take form through him.\nTherefore, he stands upon the path of effortless motion, roams the realm of no dependence, ascends and descends through the empty void, rides the yin and yang to mold and refine, and embraces the great simplicity of the Nameless. Thus, he bestows goodness and brings all to completion.\n\nAt the inception of the ninety-nine billion, nine hundred ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine myriad qi, the Mysterious Origin once more arrayed itself, and heaven and earth were born.\nHe is called the Lord of the Nameless, who unfolds the Dao of spontaneity to transform heaven and earth.\nAfter the passage of one great kalpa, heaven and earth collapse and sink; yet again, he accumulates qi to govern their revolution, reestablishing the firmament and the earth. He is called the Supreme Mysterious Venerable, who opens the way and guides the multitudes of humanity.\nAfter the completion of another great kalpa, heaven and earth are once more destroyed; again, he creates and transforms the Two Modes (heaven and earth). He is called the Most High Venerable Lord, who upholds the registers of immortality to deliver the ten directions.\nWhen the cycle of one kalpa reaches its end and heaven and earth again sink, he once more embodies the wondrous and subtle, called the Loftiest Venerable Lord, and merges to perfect heaven and earth.\n\nHe distinguishes the primordial qi: the clear becomes heaven, the turbid becomes earth. The essence of the Great Yang becomes the sun; the essence of the Great Yin becomes the moon.\nHe further divides the essences of the sun and moon to form the stars and constellations, establishing the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, arranging the Twenty-Four Solar Terms, instituting the Eight Festivals, the Four Seasons, and the Five Phases. He sets the Five Planets and the Five Peaks, appointing the Five Thearchs to govern them. The sun, moon, and stars each have their palaces to administer their domains.\nSpring, summer, autumn, and winter assist the Twenty-Four Solar Terms. He further establishes Three Hundred Sixty Sacred Mountains and Seventy-Two Blessed Lands to stabilize the earth’s principles.\n\nWhen the qi of heaven and earth intermingle, then humans, birds and beasts, grasses and trees, flying insects and creeping creatures all flourish and come into being. He then appoints the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the lineages of the hundred clans, who succeed one another in generation and transformation.\n\nHeaven and earth are separated by forty-eight thousand *li*; the distances from east to west and north to south are each one hundred million, nine thousand *li*. The sun and moon each have a diameter of three thousand *li*, and their circumferences are each nine thousand *li*.\nMount Kunlun is the axis of heaven and earth, with the Dark Lord of the Northern Culmen residing atop it. The Dipper’s single star spans a hundred *li*, and the distance between them is ninety thousand *li*. Such is the arrangement, and thus there are Nine Heavens and Nine Earths.\n\nThe Nine Heavens are as follows: the first below is the *Poli* Heaven; the second, the *Jiayi* Heaven; the third, the *Fanbao* Heaven; the fourth, the *Huaying* Heaven; the fifth, the *Bujiao* Heaven; the sixth, the *Jiran* Heaven; the seventh, the *Xuyan* Heaven; the eighth, the *Shanshan* Heaven; and the ninth, the *Yudan* Heaven.\n\nThe Nine Earths are as follows: the first above is the *Serun* Earth; the second, the *Runse* Earth; the third, the *Seze* Earth; the fourth, the *Runze* Earth; the fifth, the *Jinsu Ze* Earth; the sixth, the *Jingang Ze* Earth; the seventh, the *Shui Ze* Earth; the eighth, the *Feng Ze* Earth; and the ninth, the *Dongquan Gangwei* Earth, also called the Nine Ramparts.\n\nThough the heavens hold many positions, here we briefly list thirty-six names, dividing them into the Three Realms, the Four Heavens, and the Three Pure Realms.\n\nThe first below is the Realm of Desire, comprising Six Heavens:\nThe Six Heavens are the Supreme August Heaven, the Supreme Bright Heaven, the Clear Bright Heaven, the Mysterious Womb Heaven, the Primordial Bright Heaven, and the Seven Luminaries Heaven.\n\nThe second is the Realm of Form, comprising Eighteen Heavens:\nThe Eighteen Heavens are the Void Heaven, the Supreme Ultimate Heaven, the Vermilion Bright Heaven, the Reverent Splendor Heaven, the Radiant Bright Heaven, the *Zhuluo* Heaven, the Void Bright Heaven, the Contemplative Bright Heaven, the Reverent Celebration Heaven, the Supreme Resplendent Heaven, the Primordial Bearing Heaven, the Supreme Peace Heaven, the Manifest Concentration Heaven, the Beginning Yellow Heaven, the Supreme Yellow Heaven, the No-Thought Heaven, the Upper *Die* Heaven, and the Ultimate Heaven.\n\nThe third is the Formless Realm, comprising Four Heavens:\nThe Four Heavens are the *Xiaodu* Heaven, the Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Wondrous Completion Heaven, and the Forbidden Upper Heaven.\nThese twenty-eight heavens are collectively called the Three Realms.\n\nAbove them are the Four Human Heavens, which are:\nThe Constant Fusion Heaven, the Jade Prosperity Heaven, the Brahma Passage Heaven, and the *Jiayi* Heaven.\nThese four heavens are called the Heavens of the Seed People.\nTogether with the previous heavens, they total thirty-two, all situated below the Three Pure Realms.\n\nAbove them are the Three Heavens, called the Three Pure Realms:\nThe first is the Great Crimson Heaven, called the Grand Pure Realm;\nThe second is the *Yuyu* Heaven, called the High Pure Realm;\nThe third is the Pure Tenuity Heaven, called the Jade Pure Realm.\nThe highest heaven is called the Supreme Great Canopy of the Boundless Heaven, for it encompasses all heavens and is supremely lofty and without peer.\n\nIn total, there are thirty-six heavens, each with its own emperor.\nThe earth likewise has thirty-six names, each with its own sovereign.\nThese are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and the Thirty-Six Earth\n\nThus it is known that the Most High Lord Lao is the father and mother of primordial *qi*, the root and origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor and head of *yin* and *yang*, the Emperor and Lord of the myriad spirits, the stem and stalk of the ancient kings, and the ethereal soul of the ten thousand things.\n\nHe smelts and shapes the void and non-being, creates and transforms in response to causes and conditions, girds the Eight Extremities, bears the Earth and suspends the Heaven, roams and courses with the sun and moon, moves and turns the stars, inhales and exhales the Six *Jia*, commands and governs the *qian* and *kun*, alters the four seasons, shifts the cold and warmth, drives the winds and rains, stirs the thunder and clouds, distinguishes the blue and yellow, reckons the cycles of emptiness and fullness, and establishes the order of ruler and minister, father and son—wherein ritual and propriety are complete.\n\nScholars have observed: the people of the Desire Realm possess *yin* and *yang* and engage in sensual desire, begetting and giving birth to one another; the people of the Form Realm are said to have form but do not unite, and all are born through transformation; the people of the Formless Realm are said to have subtle and wondrous natures and perceptions, with no further thought of form, and there they abide.\n\nThe Seed People are the next rank of immortals. They are said to live for millions of years and to be able to fly and travel. Though they gradually attain long life, they have not yet severed the cycle of birth and death. When their lifespan is exhausted, they descend and are reborn, each according to the depth or shallowness of their karma. If they cultivate and advance further, they ascend into the Three Pure Realms of the Dao and are forever freed from the wheel of rebirth.\n\nWithin these realms are established the Three Primordial Palaces, where the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, along with the One Hundred Twenty Departments, are set in place. Officials are arrayed to examine and record the lives, deaths, sins, and blessings of people, with not even the finest detail overlooked. Let those who turn toward the Dao take heed and strive diligently.\n\nYou may take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and draw forth the *qi* of the Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure of the Eastern Marchmount, who manifests the form and bearing of the Wood phase, wears the cap and shoes of *jia-yi*, wields the staff of dragon and tiger, and presides over the people of *yin* and *mao*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the Southern Darkness, who manifests the form and bearing of the Fire phase, wears the cap and shoes of *bing-ding*, holds the writ of the Vermilion Bird, and presides over the people of *si* and *wu*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery of the Western Marchmount, who manifests the form and bearing of the Metal phase, wears the cap and coverings of *geng-xin*, brandishes the blade of snow and frost, and presides over the people of *shen* and *you*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Dawn of the Northern Darkness, who manifests the form and bearing of the Water phase, wears the cap and shoes of *ren-gui*, holds the tablet of the Dark Warrior, and presides over the people of *hai* and *zi*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Transcendence and Sagely Ascension of the Northeast, who manifests the form and bearing of Wood and Water, wears the cap and shoes of blue and black, wields the sword of the Ghost Gate, and presides over the people of the *gen* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Life-Preservation and Destiny-Transcendence of the Southeast, who manifests the form and bearing of Wood and Fire, wears the cap and shoes of blue and red, holds the seal of the Wind Gate, and presides over the people of the *xun* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Void of the Southwest, who manifests the form and bearing of Metal and Fire, wears the cap and shoes of white and red, holds the register of the Earth Gate, and presides over the people of the *kun* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Grand Florescence of the Northwest, who manifests the form and bearing of Metal and Water, wears the cap and shoes of white and black, holds the mirror of the Heavenly Gate, and presides over the people of the *qian* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void and Luminous Augustness of the Upper Realm, who manifests the form and bearing of light and purity, wears the cap and shoes of the azure vault, moves the growth and movement of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and presides over the flourishing and withering of ruler and minister, father and son—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the True Augustness and Grotto Spirits of the Lower Realm, who manifests the form and bearing of heaviness and turbidity, wears the cap and shoes of *wu-ji*, bestows the vows of the four directions, and presides over the people of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nEach of the Thirty-Six Heavens has its own emperor, and each of the Thirty-Six Earths has its own sovereign. These Heavenly Emperors and Earthly Sovereigns each possess their own forms, caps, and shoes, and their representations and jurisdictions are all recorded in the registers of the immortal ranks—making seventy-two Heavenly Emperors and Earthly Sovereigns in all. They all revere the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and govern the longevity or brevity, fortune or misfortune of immortals and mortals in the Three Realms.\n\nIf one does not take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, where else could one turn? Thus the Five Marchmounts each depict their forms and bearings, desiring that the people of the world take refuge in them.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe Three Pure Ones descend their numinous power,\nThe Eight Extremities take refuge in them.\nThe Six Palaces are without dust,\nThe Ten Heavens follow the luminous path.\n\nWhen reciting this in audience with the perfected, universally pay homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and seek long life. You should take refuge in them.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture of the Heavenly Pass of the Supreme Purity and Numinous Treasure*.",

Let those who turn toward the Dao take heed and strive diligently.\n\nYou may take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and draw forth the *qi* of the Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure of the Eastern Marchmount, who manifests the form and bearing of the Wood phase, wears the cap and shoes of *jia-yi*, wields the staff of dragon and tiger, and presides over the people of *yin* and *mao*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Myriad Blessings of the Southern Darkness, who manifests the form and bearing of the Fire phase, wears the cap and shoes of *bing-ding*, holds the writ of the Vermilion Bird, and presides over the people of *si* and *wu*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery of the Western Marchmount, who manifests the form and bearing of the Metal phase, wears the cap and coverings of *geng-xin*, brandishes the blade of snow and frost, and presides over the people of *shen* and *you*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Dawn of the Northern Darkness, who manifests the form and bearing of the Water phase, wears the cap and shoes of *ren-gui*, holds the tablet of the Dark Warrior, and presides over the people of *hai* and *zi*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Transcendence and Sagely Ascension of the Northeast, who manifests the form and bearing of Wood and Water, wears the cap and shoes of blue and black, wields the sword of the Ghost Gate, and presides over the people of the *gen* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Life-Preservation and Destiny-Transcendence of the Southeast, who manifests the form and bearing of Wood and Fire, wears the cap and shoes of blue and red, holds the seal of the Wind Gate, and presides over the people of the *xun* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Numinous Void of the Southwest, who manifests the form and bearing of Metal and Fire, wears the cap and shoes of white and red, holds the register of the Earth Gate, and presides over the people of the *kun* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of Boundless Grand Florescence of the Northwest, who manifests the form and bearing of Metal and Water, wears the cap and shoes of white and black, holds the mirror of the Heavenly Gate, and presides over the people of the *qian* extremity—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void and Luminous Augustness of the Upper Realm, who manifests the form and bearing of light and purity, wears the cap and shoes of the azure vault, moves the growth and movement of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and presides over the flourishing and withering of ruler and minister, father and son—you may take refuge in him.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy of the True Augustness and Grotto Spirits of the Lower Realm, who manifests the form and bearing of heaviness and turbidity, wears the cap and shoes of *wu-ji*, bestows the vows of the four directions, and presides over the people of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—you may take refuge in him.\n\nEach of the Thirty-Six Heavens has its own emperor, and each of the Thirty-Six Earths has its own sovereign. These Heavenly Emperors and Earthly Sovereigns each possess their own forms, caps, and shoes, and their representations and jurisdictions are all recorded in the registers of the immortal ranks—making seventy-two Heavenly Emperors and Earthly Sovereigns in all. They all revere the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and govern the longevity or brevity, fortune or misfortune of immortals and mortals in the Three Realms.\n\nIf one does not take refuge in the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, where else could one turn? Thus the Five Marchmounts each depict their forms and bearings, desiring that the people of the world take refuge in them.\n\nThe ode says:\nThe Three Pure Ones descend their numinous power,\nThe Eight Extremities take refuge in them.\nThe Six Palaces are without dust,\nThe Ten Heavens follow the luminous path.\n\nWhen reciting this in audience with the perfected, universally pay homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and seek long life. You should take refuge in them.\n\nHere ends *The Scripture of the Heavenly Pass of the Supreme Purity and Numinous Treasure*.",
