  "full_translation": "**The Three Sovereigns' Jade Precepts of the *Yin Fu Jing***\n\n**Title:** *The Three Sovereigns' Jade Precepts of the Yin Fu Jing*\n**Attributed Authorship:** Composed by the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan.\n(*According to the Daoist Canon’s \"Summary of the Daoist Treasury,\" this is likely a forged work by a Song or Jin-era Daoist.*)\n**Three Scrolls.**\n**Source:** *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Tongzhen* (Verdant Authenticity) Section, *Jue* (Jade Precepts) Category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to the *Three Sovereigns' Jade Precepts of the Yin Fu Jing***\n**Composed by the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan.**\n\nI, the Sovereign, commanded the ministers of both civil and military ranks to govern the realm together. A protective master of the Qi lineage, the *Kui* teacher, stepped forward to report: *\"There is a monstrous bird-beast—copper-headed, iron-browed, three *zhang* tall, with wings like blades. It blots out the sun and moon in flight, and when on land, it devours stone and scatters sand, drying up rivers and harming countless lives. The empire is in chaos.\"*\n\nThus, I commanded the ministers and the imperial retinue to personally inspect the suffering of the people. Upon seeing it, I confirmed that *Chi You* indeed had summoned this monstrous bird, which could not be subdued.\n\nI traveled to a great mountain, where at night I saw crimson light, violet mist, and white vapors with greenish clouds swirling endlessly. All the ministers, when summoned to observe, saw the same.\n\nThe *Kui* teacher reported: *\"This mountain is called the First Cavern of the Empty Heaven Altar, overlooking the Jade Purity Palace of the Primordial Origin.\"*\n\nI ascended the mountain myself and found a stone cavern of unknown depth. I dispatched a valiant warrior named Zhongshan—three *zhang* and five *chi* tall—to enter with torches. After three days and nights, he emerged.\n\nZhongshan reported: *\"Within, there was a great stone chest guarded by eight armored divine warriors, each wielding an axe and a sword, shouting: ‘None may take this!’\"*\n\nAfter his report, I lit incense and prayed to the Three Pure Ones, beseeching their favor to open the chest for me, regardless of fortune or misfortune, so that I might know the secrets of heaven and earth.\n\nHaving completed the rites, I entered the cavern with the ministers. The red light encircled us, and the armored guards vanished. Within the stone chest, I found a scroll titled:\n*\"The Primordial Lord’s *Hun Yuan Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts of the Yin Fu Jing*\".\nI took the scroll from the chest, lit incense, and paid homage to the Three Pure Ones in gratitude.\n\nUpon opening it, the characters were unlike any I had seen—all celestial script (*tianwen zhuanshu*), three hundred characters in total, divided into three scrolls:\n- **Upper Scroll (Heavenly Sovereign):** The Dao of the gods embracing unity.\n- **Middle Scroll (Earthly Sovereign):** The methods for enriching the nation and securing the people.\n- **Lower Scroll (Human Sovereign):** The arts of strengthening armies and achieving victory in battle.\n\nThis text aligns with the origins of heaven, earth, yin, yang, and all things as ancestral principles. It encompasses the Dao of governing the state, harmonizing the family, and preserving life without death.\n\nThe script was naturally formed by the pure *qi* of Qingyang, each character a perfect square, one *zhang* in width.\n\nUpon my return to the capital, I convened the ministers again to discuss the scroll’s meaning. None knew its principles or had ever heard of its origin.\n\nI then issued a decree across the empire, searching the sacred mountains and hidden grottoes for reclusive sages or virtuous scholars who might understand its teachings. If anyone had obtained this scroll, they were to present it with an explanation. Those who mastered the *Yin Fu Jing* would be rewarded with gold and noble titles.\n\nYet no one in the world possessed this scroll—how could they comprehend its meaning?\n\nFor forty years, I sought out mountain hermits and Daoist adepts, bowing to them as teachers in my quest for immortality, yet none could explain the scroll’s principles. All offered only minor, tangential methods.\n\nAt last, I heard that on the *Kongtong* Mountain lived a high sage, Master Guangchengzi, whose Dao was profound and mysterious. I personally journeyed there, humbling myself with knee-crawling and elbow-walking reverence. I pleaded for his instruction: *\"From the stone chamber, I obtained the *Yin Fu Jing*. Its meaning eludes me, and no one in the world understands it. Now that I have met you, I am grateful to heaven and earth—I must know its mysteries.\"*\n\nMaster Guangchengzi replied: *\"This scroll is a celestial secret. Hidden in the world’s caverns, it suppresses demons, dragons, and spirits. It belongs to those of virtue. Whoever obtains it may walk the path of longevity and ascend to heaven, passing it down eternally to those of Daoist faith.*\n\n*Yet its meaning is known by none in the world. Now, on the Emei Mountain, there is a high sage, the True Man of Heaven (*Tian Zhen Huang Ren*), who fully understands its principles.\"*\n\nGuangchengzi accompanied me to pay homage to the True Man of Heaven. I asked: *\"How does one practice the *Yin Fu Jing*—the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign—mastering yin and yang’s transformations, governing the state, the family, and the self, achieving immortality, and ascending to the celestial realm?\"*\n\nAs Master Guangchengzi had said, the True Man of Heaven answered.\n\nAt that moment, I fully grasped the principles of yin and yang’s transformations and the Dao of attainment. When I achieved the Dao and ascended to heaven, I feared that future Daoist practitioners would lack a scripture to follow. Thus, I disseminated this text across the world, hiding one scroll in the *Kongtong* Mountain and leaving the Nine Palaces, the *luo* divinations, the division of yin and yang and the Five Phases, the seizing of transformations, and the activation of celestial mechanisms.\n\nWithin, there are:\n- The Nine Palaces’ formations,\n- The *Xuanji* (Celestial Pivot) and the *Lü* (Lunar Lodge) aligned,\n- The timing of seasons and nodes,\n- The birth and death of metal and wood,\n- The selection of true treasures,\n- The harnessing of transformations,\n- The internal alchemy of light and pure yang essence,\n- The reversal of the *Jingling* (Golden Spirit) tiger’s transformation,\n- The ascent through the *Huo Long* (Flame Dragon) void,\n- The soaring above the *Yan Tian* (Flame Heaven),\n- The entry into the *Sheng Chao Yuan* (Sacred Dynasty’s Origin) Dao.\n\nIt also divides the transformations of yin and yang:\n- The sun and moon as symbols,\n- Heaven and earth as parents,\n- The Eight Trigrams as descendants,\n- The Great One (*Tai Yi*) moving through *Kan* (Water), *Gen* (Mountain), *Zhen* (Thunder), *Xun* (Wind), *Li* (Fire), *Dui* (Lake),\n- The celestial activation of killing intent,\n- The shifting of stars and lodges,\n- The diagram of the Nine Palaces.\n\n「If later generations encounter this scripture, they must not lightly divulge it to unworthy individuals. If it is passed down to ignorant people, they will fall into the Nine Abysses and the Seven Ancestors, entering the realm of *Shūhuí* (徙回, transmigration and return), and will never escape the calamity. The misfortune will extend even to their descendants.\n\nHuangdi asked: What is meant by *Yin Fu* (阴符)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: These two characters, *Yin Fu*, can reach up to the heavens and down to the earth; within them, one can refine and generate all things. They are the most honored of all teachings for humanity.\n*Yin* means \"dark\"; *Fu* means \"harmony.\"\nThe ancient sages, through the inner workings of *Yin Fu*, could illuminate the fundamental principles of Heaven and Earth’s transformations, the source of the Dao’s progression, and the essence of life and death.\nThe mechanism of birth and death: those who know can harmonize with the workings of Heaven and Earth, cultivate the body to achieve longevity, and thus say, *Yin Fu*.\n\nHuangdi said: What of those above who practice the *Dao* of \"embracing unity\" (*Shenxian bao yi* 神仙抱一) to become immortals?\n\nTianzhen Huangren (天真皇人) replied: The *Dao* of \"embracing unity\" is a secret of the heavens, beyond the reach of mortals. The immortals who embrace unity are those who contain the *Yin Fu* of the Great One (*Tai Yi*).\nThe Great One is the source of the *Tai Yuan* (太渊) at the North Pole, the *Dao* of refining *qi* into the void, a secret of the heavens, unknown to the world. How could you, dwelling among mortals, comprehend these words?\nUnity (*Yi*) is the *qi* of Heaven.\nIf one harmonizes the Great One’s *Yin Fu* with their own *Yin Fu*, they must further know the timing of Heaven’s reception, the celestial *qi* interfacing with human *qi*, human *qi* interfacing with celestial *qi*, and thus harmonizing with Heaven’s *qi* without perishing.\nIf one contains the Great Harmony’s *Yin Fu* and refines it over time, it becomes the Great Elixir (*Da Dan* 大丹) of pure yang.\nYang is the Dao of Heaven; thus, the *qi* of the immortal harmonizes with the Dao, becoming the *Dao* of \"embracing unity.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What of those in the middle who seek to enrich the nation and bring peace to the people?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: To enrich the nation and bring peace to the people is the *Dao* of refining *qi*.\nCommon folk refine their true essence (*Zhenjing* 真精) into a divine embryo (*Shentai* 神胎), known as the \"embryonic immortal\" (*Taixian* 胎仙).\nThus, gathering forms the shape; dispersing forms the *qi*.\nHence, they harmonize with the Dao.\nThe Dao is to nourish *qi*; to nourish *qi* is to preserve the spirit and merge with the Great Dao.\nThus, it is said: \"Harmonize the true *qi*, over time refine with fire to form the elixir (*Dan*).\"\nIf one fully preserves the *qi* of essence and refines it into pure yang, they become the elixir that transmutes the form, and all spirits settle in peace. The nation holds treasures, hence it is said: \"Enrich the nation and bring peace to the people.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What of those below who achieve military strength and victory in battle?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: Military strength and victory in battle come from the true *qi* repelling yin *qi*.\nRefining the body into pure yang, one cultivates golden sinews and jade bones, a crane’s body and pine’s form—this is pure yang. Thus, they achieve immortality.\nWith the body as the nation, the mind as the sovereign, the essence as the people, and the form as the furnace.\nThe head is the *Ding* (鼎, cauldron).\nWhen essence fills the brain, one uses fire to refine it into the elixir.\nEssence (*Jing*) meets fire (*Huǒ*), and breath (*Xi*) is wind (*Feng*).\nUsing wind to fan the fire, over time refining until both form and spirit are perfected.\nThus, it is said: \"The *Dao* of refining the spirit is to preserve the mind within; the true *qi* naturally harmonizes and does not perish.\"\nHence: \"Refine the hundred passports (*Bai Guan* 百关) of essence and marrow (*Jingsuí* 精髓), achieving pure yang.\nWhen the *qi* of the nine orifices (*Jiǔqiào* 九窍) is stabilized at the lower passport (*Xiàguān* 下关), and the essence-*qi* does not leak, victory is attained.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Tian Huang* (天皇)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: *Tian Huang* is before the primal beginning (*Xiantian* 先天), the first transformation of the Five Calamities (*Wu Jie* 五劫), the origin of chaos (*Hundun* 混沌).\nThe *Tian Huang*’s single *qi* manifests all phenomena, governing the Heavenly Sacred Jade (*Shengyu* 圣玉) and the Sacred Void (*Shengjing* 圣境).\nIt is the ancestral *qi* of the *Ming Huang* (明皇).\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Di Huang* (地皇)?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: *Di Huang* is when the single *qi* of *Tian Huang* descends to the earth, and the earthly *qi* receives it. The two *qi*s harmonize, generating the *qi* of golden light (*Shenghua* 生化) and forming the realm of the Perfected Spirit (*Dongshen* 洞神).\nIt is the true ancestral *qi* of the *Zhen Huang* (真皇).\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Ren Huang* (人皇)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: *Ren Huang* exists between Heaven and Earth, in the void of ultimate reason (*Xuwu zhi li* 虚无至理), where the single *qi* of *Tian Huang* and *Di Huang* harmonizes within the boundless void.\nThe Five Stars of metal and wood form the central palace (*Zhonggong* 中宫), and the Eight Trigrams of *Kan* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) protect and refine the spirit, making it the realm of the immortal in the Middle Element (*Zhongyuan* 中元).\nIt is the ancestral *qi* of *Ren Huang*.\n\nHuangdi asked: To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its movements—is that all?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: To observe Heaven is to perceive the *qi* of the Green Yang (*Qingyang* 青阳), the pure yang substance.\nThe essence-*qi* circulates without ceasing, rising and descending, returning and beginning anew, encompassing all phenomena—this is the *qi* of the Green Yang.\nHeaven and Earth are the essences of yin and yang; the celestial *qi* descends, and the earthly *qi* ascends, ascending and descending in turn, yet mortals remain unaware of its principles.\nThe yang essence of Heaven is the sun, and the yin essence of Earth is the moon.\nThe sun and moon move without rest, and the cold and heat alternate without pause.\nCommon folk do not know that within their bodies lies the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, rising and descending in due time.\nThose who know observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its movements—thus, it is complete.\n\nHuangdi asked: What is meant by \"unknowing\"?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: The head symbolizes Heaven, the origin of clear yang; the feet symbolize Earth, the source of turbid yin.\nIf one internally contains the Dao of Heaven and Earth, they align with Heaven and Earth’s lifespan.\nWithin the human body lies the true yang *qi*, hidden inside the yin essence.\nThe essence-*qi* is the mother of the true *qi*; the true *qi* is the child of the essence-*qi*.\nIf one constantly guards the child and mother, they will not perish.\nReturning to the source, they become human, unaware of the passage of time.\nAbove the *Tian Shū* (天枢, Celestial Pivot), the single *qi* of *Tian Yuan* (天元) governs it;\nBelow the *Tian Shū*, the single *qi* of *Di Yuan* (地元) governs it;\nWithin the *Tian Shū*, the true source of yin and yang governs it.\nHumans utilize Heaven’s timing; the single *qi* of *Hunyuan Zhengyi* (混元正一) is boundless above and below, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s lifespan.»\n\nThus observing the Dao of Heaven, embodying Heaven’s movements—all is complete.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What does it mean for humans to utilize [this]?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Sage preserves essence and nurtures *qi* to safeguard form and spirit. But common folk, unaware, squander essence through greed, lose spirit through excessive thought, and dissipate *qi* through toil—unable to harmonize their spirit-*qi* with the Dao. They fail to grasp Heaven and Earth’s ascent and descent, the revolutions of sun and moon, hence they die.\n\nThey receive their allotment of sun and moon’s *qi*—if one could observe this Heaven and Earth as I do, we would be the same.\n\nYet people do not comprehend Heaven and Earth’s principles or the essence of yin and yang. If they could unite with Heaven and Earth’s substance, they would attain perfection.\n\nThis is how humans utilize [the Dao].\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"Heaven has Five Bandits—those who see them flourish. Why?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"Heaven receives the One *Qi*, internally containing the Five Stars’ true *qi*, drawing from the sources of purity and turbidity. Earth receives the One *Qi*, thus generating the Two Complements, which ascend back to Heaven, completing the Three Primordials. The Four Seasons unfold, with Five *Qi* within, driving their revolutions to complete the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Bandits are the Five Phases’ true *qi*. Humans who plunder Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, usurp yin and yang’s transformations, disrupt the Three Primordials’ reversals, and reverse the Four Gates’ exchanges—when the One *Qi* aligns, the Dao is achieved. These are the Five Bandits.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one utilize Heaven’s Five Bandits?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Five Bandits are the Five *Qi*. They nourish all things, governing life and death, the mechanisms of transformation. Initially, Heaven gathered the Five *Qi* to form shape, dispersing as wind. If you know their source, it resides within you, filling your body. Your essence-*qi* harmonizes with Heaven’s *qi*, and through prolonged refinement, it becomes the elixir—the Five Phases’ true *qi*.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* descends; Earth’s *qi* receives it without separation. Humans dwell within them, enveloped by the Five *Qi*. If one plunders them, they do not die.\n\nI am now twenty-two thousand years old—all because I understood the Five Bandits’ transformations and reversals.\n\nNow I transmit the Five Bandits’ principles to you. You and I are the same. If you do not know the Five Bandits’ principles, you will die. But if you follow my words and plunder Heaven and Earth’s Five Stars’ *qi*, you will not die. This is the principle of the Five Bandits.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"The Five Bandits reside in the heart, yet act upon Heaven—why?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"Within the human body lie the Five Phases’ true *qi*—the *qi* of the Five Viscera. The Five Viscera’s *qi* are the Five Bandits.\n\nWater’s share belongs to the kidneys. Before birth, the Dao is the foundation; first emerges the left kidney, mirroring the Northern Abyss’s source, the origin of transformation, the *qi* of Azure Yang, named the Azure Dragon, affiliated with Wood.\n\nNext emerges the right kidney, affiliated with Metal, containing true essence, governing the Five Phases’ true *qi*, named the White Tiger—the One *Qi* of the White Lord.\n\nWithin the two kidneys, two white vessels rise, surging upward to the Celestial Yang Palace, descending to connect with *Xun*. At the center of *Kun*, the Five *Qi* gather, aligning with *Qian*, while *Gen* emerges with *Tian Jia*, entering *Wu Ji*’s domain—this is the beginning of the Dao generating spirit.\n\nHumans align with Heaven’s timing, interfacing with Heaven and Earth’s *qi*. The head’s roundness mirrors Heaven; the feet’s squareness mirrors Earth. The central *Qi* gathers, entering the Vermilion Palace, reaching the sinews and bones, ascending to the Cauldron within, then descending to the Gushing Spring, entering the Central Yellow Palace. All spirits merge, so when Azure Yang reaches the summit, all yin disperses. Then, utilizing the Five Phases’ true *qi*, internally refining into a single elixir within the Cauldron, one does not die—this is acting upon Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"The Cosmos lies within the hands—why?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Cosmos is the origin of Heaven, Earth, yin, yang, and all things, shaped by yin and yang. Yin is Earth’s *qi*; yang is Heaven’s *qi*. Heaven’s *qi* descends; Earth’s *qi* receives it. Earth’s *qi* ascends; Heaven’s *qi* meets it. When Heaven’s and Earth’s *qi* intersect, yin and yang resonate, and all spirits transform and manifest.\n\nAncient Sages grasped Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang transformations’ primordial mechanism. The mechanism lies in utilization—those who know guard it. Guarding is the Dao, and thus one does not die.\n\nHence it is said: *The Cosmos lies within the hands.*\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one utilize the Cosmos within the hands?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth unite, the Cosmos does not disperse within. Transformation generates spirit, establishing yin-yang’s divine mechanisms—thus the Great Dao is achieved.\n\nThe Great Dao is non-action. Non-action prevents chaos in fate; fate unperturbed keeps spirit steadfast; spirit unshaken prevents essence from scattering; essence undispersed ensures *qi* does not falter. Further, with Dao-*qi* circulating to fortify the body, if refined with essence and fire in tandem, forming the Golden Elixir—this is natural.\n\nI know the Cosmos’ mechanisms and continuously enact them, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s workings, never letting them stray. Over time, the spirit naturally ascends to the Primordial—thus one does not die. This is *the Cosmos within the hands.*\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What does it mean that ten thousand transformations arise from the body?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The ten thousand transformations are the spirit. When essence does not scatter, the spirit does not depart. The Spirit Chamber is where all spirits congregate, located within Kunlun’s heart.\n\nThe Five *Qi* gather within; if one forms a spirit-fetus from true essence-*qi*, ascending to the Cauldron above, one is called *the Most Sage*. All spirits unite as one. Common folk, however, dissipate essence and lose *qi*, unable to preserve the spirit—thus they do not know the law of generating the body.\n\nThe law of generating the body is the Dao of yin and yang. Hence it is said: *Ten thousand transformations arise from the body.*\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is the Dao of the singular Qi that generates the body?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"From the singular Qi all things arise, yet one does not know how the singular Qi creates and transforms. One generates two, two generate three, and three generate ten thousand things. When a person receives the singular Qi, it transforms into the Three Qi—spirit, *qi*, and essence—and thus it is the Dao of generating the body.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is this 'one'?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The 'one' is the root of Heaven and Earth, the progenitor of yin and yang, and the origin of all things. It is the source of generating the spirit. If one can know the true essence-Qi of the 'one,' then all things will arise of their own accord and one will not die. Hence it is called 'one.' The Yellow Emperor said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism. What does this mean?'*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"Heaven uses the celestial *Lù* (斗) to govern its mechanism; humans use the heart as their mechanism. The heart is the spirit. When the heart’s mechanism aligns with the Dao, then the mysteries of ghosts and gods are realized. Before a person is born, they first receive the singular Qi as their fate, then the yin and yang Qi of their parents combine, and thus form is achieved. The spirit-fetus generates the spirit, so it is the origin of human nature. If a person can still their heart, like the movement of Heaven and Earth’s mechanism, they will be in harmony with Heaven and Earth. Thus, through the stillness of nature, the heart’s mechanism aligns with the Dao. Hence it is said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How should one use the human heart as the mechanism?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The human heart is the origin of the mechanism. If one can preserve the heart and guard the spirit without forgetting the mechanism’s function, the heart is the source of all spirits. Calming the heart nurtures human nature. Thus the Sage calms their heart, embraces the origin, and contains the true essence. Containing the true essence is calming the nature. To take the heart as nature, to take *qi* as fate—when *qi* is exhausted, fate departs, and all is disordered in nature. Thus, they lose their *qi* and die. If one, like the Heavenly *qi*, remains clear and pure, they will not lose their nature. When nature is not lost, *qi* does not scatter; when *qi* does not scatter, fate does not depart; when fate does not depart, the form does not perish. Heaven and Earth are the origin of nature and fate. Hence it is said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is the Dao of establishing Heaven’s mechanism to stabilize the human Dao? What does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is the pure yang *qi*, so it takes pure yang as its foundation. If humans can contain the essence-Qi of Heaven’s transforming mechanism, like Heaven and Earth’s yang without abandoning it, and receive the singular correct *qi*, nurturing the body with the pure yang Dao of all spirits, then it is said: 'To establish Heaven’s mechanism to stabilize the human Dao.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How should one use the Dao of establishing Heaven’s mechanism?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is the foundation of humanity. Parents are the beginning of humanity. If one can retain the form in its foundation without losing it to its beginning, and harmonize the spirit with the Dao, then it is said: 'To establish Heaven’s mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one retain the form without losing it to its beginning?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"If humans do not indulge in worry, anxiety, or overthinking, they will not lose their foundation. If they avoid illness, fatigue, and hardship, they will not lose their beginning. To lose one’s foundation is to destroy one’s fate; to lose one’s beginning is to return the form to the earth. If humans can cultivate and refine themselves according to the Dao, their *qi* will not lose its beginning—this is to know the principle. Hence it is said: 'The Dao of Heaven is the foundation of humanity; parents are the beginning of humanity.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change—what does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The mother of Heaven is the *Tàiyì* (太易). Within, it conceals the yin and yang Qi—these are the sun and moon. Before the sun and moon were divided, the Sage’s transformation generated the spirit, named *Tàiyī* (太一) as its origin. Then the sun and moon divided into yin and yang, and yin and yang further divided into the Five *Tàis* (五太). The Five *Tàis* are the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors then divided into the Eight *Guà* (卦), which pay homage to the center. The Sage’s transformation became the Nine Palaces, which is the divine palace of *Tàiyī*. Established are the Five Celestial *Lùs* (斗), with the Central *Lù* (中斗) within. The sun, moon, and stars are odd, and the Northern *Lù* (斗) receives the mechanism, directing the movement of yin and yang. When yin is the mechanism, death occurs; when yang is the mechanism, life occurs. The combination of yin and yang as mechanisms forms the Dao. Thus, *Tàiyī* governs the killing and life mechanisms, circulating through the Eight *Guà*, shifting the stars and changing their lodges. To return yin to yang is to achieve longevity; to return yang to yin is to die by the killing mechanism. Heaven’s four seasons create transformations, and the Eight *Guà* cycle endlessly—within the human body, these are also present, though humans do not know them. If one remains in yin and is killed, they die; if they cycle through rebirth, they lose their human form. If humans can refine themselves to attain the Dao, they will not lose their human form nor die by the killing mechanism. Hence it is said: 'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What does it mean to not lose one’s human form and avoid the killing mechanism? What does this entail?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The *Tàiyī* (太一) abides within the Nine Palaces, entering and exiting at appointed times. It summons the Lord of the Great Yang to return to the Yang Hall, where the four seasons shift, the Eight *Guà* pay homage to the origin, and all spirits gather. The killing mechanism returns yin to yang, ordering the stars, and they return to the Golden Gate within. The Sage’s realm is supremely pure, and the Lord of the True Yang is *Bái Yuán Jūn* (白元君). If humans know this and can, with the true essence-Qi of *Tàiyī*, follow the mechanism and transform accordingly, returning to the pure yang of the Eight *Guà* and merging with the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, causing the chapter of generating the spirit in the chaotic nine heavens to manifest, then they will realize the Dao of Heaven and attain eternal longevity, becoming true humans according to this transformation. Hence it is said: 'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When Earth unleashes the killing mechanism, causing dragons and serpents to rise from the land—what does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The harmonious singular Qi moves when it is unleashed, so Heaven’s mechanism does not cease. The killing mechanism is transformation. The dragon is the Heavenly *qi*—wind. The serpent is the Earthly *qi*—fire. If humans can circulate their essence-Qi, moving it up and down, seizing the mechanism of transformation, then the mysterious mechanism will depart. The Six Desires stir the mechanism’s balance, like the bodies of Heaven and Earth, where humans dwell. If there is true yang essence-Qi, it is called 'serpent,' ascending to connect with the primordial Heavenly *qi*, breathing and moving up and down, in resonance with Earth’s moving mechanism, rising and departing from the land.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"When the Earth unleashes the killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"Within the human body, what is the use of knowing this?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Below the navel, one inch and three divisions, is the Sea of Qi. Within it lies a true essence of one *hun* measure, pressed into the Earth’s soil. Two meridians connect it to the brain. The brain contains a chamber called the Palace of Spirit Yang, with two orifices: the left is the Orifice of Supreme Polarity, the right is the Orifice of Penetrating Spirit. It ascends to connect with Heavenly *qi* and descends to the Sea’s source—thus is called breathing. When Heavenly *qi* descends and Earthly *qi* ascends, the two *qi* meet, nourishing the true essence, which is called the Dragon. The root of Azure Yang, descending, is the Serpent—this is the Primordial *qi*. When the two *qi* intermingle, they form the elixir; refined long enough, they become the Dan, hence immortality. Then the Yang Spirit transcends the body’s bounds, and within the human form, the Earth unleashes the killing mechanism, and dragons and serpents rise from the land.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"When humans unleash the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse—why?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"When humans unleash the killing mechanism, they abandon the Six Desires and Seven Emotions. In stillness, they rest in emotion and intent; in motion, they move with spirit-mechanism. Internally, they employ spirit-*qi*, merging ascent and descent. Guarding the spirit is the Yang *qi*. The head’s roundness mirrors Heaven, the feet’s squareness mirrors Earth. When Heaven and Earth reverse, it is the ascent and descent of yin and yang; when humans reverse, breathing penetrates to the root. One inhale draws Heavenly *qi* downward, one exhale raises Earthly *qi*. Inhaling is Heavenly *qi*, exhaling is Earthly *qi*. My true *qi* meets them—humans can descend Earthly *qi* to the heavens above. Thus it is said: When humans unleash the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"When Heaven and Man unite in unleashing, the myriad transformations find their foundation—why?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Heaven generates all things; humans are the foremost among the myriad living beings. Thus Heaven and Earth unite to nourish all things, and when humans harmonize essence-*qi*, all spirits rejoice. Heaven and Earth do not abandon them but follow, with spirit dwelling within. Spirit is the Dao of Heaven, and it loves purity. If impure, the spirit scatters, failing to align with Heaven’s Dao. The ancient sages preserved essence to nourish spirit, stored *qi* to nourish essence, and thus aligned with Heaven’s Dao, becoming True Persons. Heaven has one *qi*, Earth has two principles, within are three luminaries. The four seasons are complete, the five phases arrayed, the six extremes generating, the seven celestial officials as mechanisms, the eight trigrams unified, the nine palaces filling Heaven and Earth. The Five Star Revolving Sphere exists in humans as well. If humans receive Heaven and Earth’s singular *qi*, harmonizing with all spirits, aligning with the two principles, the Great Dan is formed. The singular *qi* moves endlessly through the four seasons; within, one *qi* spreads across the central soil. The five phases invert internally, the six yangs ascend to the Golden Threshold, the seven truths dwell eternally within the body, the eight trigrams arise in the Primordial Palace. The three luminaries mingle, white snow drifts; the seven officials complete their function, yellow sprouts grow within, the nine palaces thread through myriad phenomena—thus aligning with Heaven’s Dao. Hence it is said: When Heaven and Man unite in unleashing, the myriad transformations find their foundation.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"Nature has skill and clumsiness—how can it be concealed and stored? Why?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"Heaven’s nature cannot be disordered. If spirit-*qi* is disordered, one does not know how to manifest spirit. Concealing and storing means nature like the bright moon, naturally communicating with the Dao. The skilled internally govern Heaven’s mechanism; externally, nothing enters, thus concealing wisdom and storing spirit, aligning with Heaven’s Dao. The clumsy do not know their own spirit-*qi* aligns with the Dao. They let the heart and intent generate emotions, freely scattering spirit-*qi*, failing to understand Heaven and Earth’s transformations, confusing yin and yang—thus they die. Hence nature has skill and clumsiness.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"How does skillful nature conceal and store itself?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Nature is spirit—it must not be disturbed. Thus when spirit is settled and *qi* harmonized, the Primordial *qi* descends. Concealing means not coveting desires or cravings; storing means hiding in spirit-light, with *qi* entering the Vermilion Palace, the gathering place of myriad spirits. Concealed and stored, unmoving, the myriad spirits do not scatter. Thus it is said: Concealing and storing spirit settles transformations; long refinement yields the Dao—thus nature is skilled, not clumsy.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials—how can they be moved or stilled?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The nine orifices: the heart contains nine orifices, housing nine *qi*—above are the three Pure *qi*, in the middle the three Sovereign *qi*, below the Primordial Source *qi*, which is essence-*qi*-spirit. They enter and exit in due time, mingling as one, externally communicating through ears, eyes, mouth, and nose—the yin within. The three essentials: spirit-*qi* and essence merge, the Mysterious Female Jade Gate, ascending to Heaven, descending to Earth, centrally connecting with the three Sovereign Ancestral *qi*—this is the Dao of the three essentials. Moving or stilling the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose: observing with the eyes disturbs the heart, listening with the ears shifts the spirit, speaking with the mouth scatters *qi*, smelling with the nose turns essence and marrow into turbid yin-water. If deliberately kept still and unmoving, the heart’s two orifices—left called Mysterious, right called Female—descend into the Sea of *Qi*, ascending to the Mud Ball. This is where true *qi* communicates, causing spirit-*qi* to move the mechanism, the Jade Gate closing of its own accord. Piercing the spine’s victory, passing the three passes, and facing the North Pole, the Yang Palace moves to preserve the true spirit. The ancient sages said: Move with spirit-mechanism, still with heart-intent. Essence-*qi*-spirit are the three essentials. Thus it is said: The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"Fire arises from wood—when disaster strikes, it must conquer. Why?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Wood without fire does not burn to ash; humans without evil nature do not die.\"*\n\n「Wood contains fire, and when fire erupts, it must consume. Its true *qi* is thus formed, its smoke and flames ascending to return to Heaven, while the fire consumes wood to become ash and return to Earth. By nature, humans harbor evil as fire; when fire arises, the spirit disperses, and when the spirit disperses, the *qi* departs. With *qi* gone, the body dies, the true Yang-*qi* returning to Heaven, the turbid Yin-essence to Earth. It is said: Fire arises from wood, yet water can extinguish it—thus no ash remains; humans harbor evil as fire, yet gentleness can suppress it—thus the body remains unharmed. When a person’s fire erupts, all their spirits scatter, and thus they die. But if a person can control their fire, disaster cannot overcome them, and they attain the Great Dao. Hence it is said: *Fire arises from wood, disaster strikes but must be conquered.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Deceit originates within a state, and when its time comes, it must collapse—why?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *Within a state lies deceit; if left unchecked, it will ruin the state. Within a person lies evil; if left unchecked, it will destroy their body. A state without deceit is at peace, a person without passions is secure. To remove deceit means to eliminate the Six Desires, the Seven Emotions, and the Three Corpses. If a person can control deceitful evil, they attain the Great Dao.* Hence it is said: *Deceit originates within a state, and when its time comes, it must collapse.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one achieve bodily security?*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *All things are thieves of Heaven’s true *qi*; within the human abdomen lies the pestilence (*wù*), which steals *qi* from all things and is called *wù* (pestilence). The pestilence transforms into flattery and deceit. Flatterers are thieves of my soul and spirit, dispersers of my *qi* and blood, and destroyers of my form. But if a person understands the transformations of Yin and Yang, they can kindle true fire to refine and eliminate the deceitful evil of Yin. Thus they slay the pestilence, preventing its harm, and achieve bodily security, returning to the Great Dao.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *To know and cultivate—this is called the sage. Why?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *The ancient sages used the spirit-mechanism to measure Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, ascending and descending at their proper times. They knew the numbers of the fire’s critical moments, lowered the fire according to the times, and within the *Wu-Jǐ* (Steward) and *Jǐ* (Beginning) Palaces, they returned to the origin of life’s mother. Those who know return to their mother, lest they lose her. They then receive Heaven’s *qi* as the leader of Qingyang (Pure Yang), and merge Earth’s *qi* with the mother of true Yin. My spirit-*qi* and essence are preserved within; the Five *qi* are all complete, the heart still and without desire. Refining with fire, I transform into pure Yang; through Daoist cultivation, my vital essence returns to Yang spirit, my Yin passions utterly extinguished. My form becomes like a pine’s, my bones like jade; the hundred passes are sealed without leakage, ascending to the Heavenly Realm—thus I become a True Person. Hence it is said: *To know and cultivate is called the sage.*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* (Classic of Dark Patterns) concludes the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts, Upper Scroll*.\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* begins the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts, Middle Scroll*.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—this is the Dao’s principle.*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *Heaven gives life when a person returns to the original Dao, their true nature emerging and ascending, thus life. Internally harmonizing with Heaven’s creation, they reach the ultimate Dao and give birth to true essence. Hidden in the world, such a person can measure [the Dao]; their sage-like spirit-mechanism is internally clear, externally communicating with Heaven and Earth. Thus, those who know do not die.*\n\n*Heaven takes life when a person does not trust the Dao, recklessly harming their spirit-*qi*, exceeding Heaven’s limit, and thus dying—this is the killing.*\n\nHence it is said: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one apply Heaven’s giving and taking?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *If a person cultivates the Dao without knowing Heaven’s times, they mistakenly return to the root and origin, thus dying. But if a person knows Heaven’s true *qi* and times, they return to the root and restore their command. They must understand that the Creator’s essence is the true source of emptiness, where Yin and Yang merge as One and become the Five Phases’ true *qi*. Heaven and Earth vie in victory, knowing advance and retreat—thus there is no birth or death. The human Dao is the foundation; if one does not know life and death, this is called supplementing the insufficient while harming the excess—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\nHence it is said: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things; all things are thieves of humans; humans are thieves of all things. When the Three Thefts are balanced, the Three Talents are secure. Why?*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *Heaven nourishes all things with one *qi*. When Heaven and Earth’s *qi* disperse, all things steal it; when all things’ *qi* disperse, humans steal it. Humans know to steal all things’ true *qi* to nourish their form, further knowing to ascend and descend in harmony with Heaven’s times, to receive Heaven’s *qi* and grasp its transformations, achieving immortality and not dying. Thus humans steal Heaven and Earth’s *qi* from all things, and this is how they attain the Dao.*\n\n*If humans do not understand the transformations, all things will steal back humans’ *qi*—thus they live by the Five Grains and die by the Five Grains. This is how humans die from being stolen by all things.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *If humans steal all things, how do they not die?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *Humans receive the harmonious *qi* of the cosmos to live, thus they do not die. Once they receive it, their passions and desires cause them to die. If they can preserve the One *qi*, they protect their spirit. Heaven nourishes all things with One *qi*, further giving Yin and Yang harmony and the Five Grains’ completeness, thus humans become full-bellied and strong-boned, not losing their essence-*qi*-spirit, and thus do not die. When the Three Thefts are balanced, humans can steal Heaven and Earth’s *qi* to communicate with their spirit and nature, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, thus securing the Three Talents. The human spirit and *qi* are in accord with Heaven and Earth, and they love purity and stillness. Thus sages remain serene and empty, true *qi* preserved in its origin, spirit guarded internally—how could they die?*\n\nHence, those who overindulge in food harm their essence and blood; those who overwork scatter their spirit-*qi*; those whose hearts rise with passions and desires—how could all things not steal from them? Thus, halting excessive intake of food and drink makes the body light; halting excessive thought and deliberation makes the spirit agile; halting excessive cravings and desires makes the spirit pure. Hence they attain the Dao—why seek it externally?\n\nThus it is said: *\"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Talents are at peace.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Thus it is said: 'Eat in season, and the hundred bones will be in order.' Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"In the Age of Great Antiquity, the sages ate the *qi* of Heaven in due measure, and naturally the hundred bones became supple and harmonious. Drawing the true *qi* of Great Harmony into the body-field, the five *zàng* organs became cool and clear, the six *fǔ* organs balanced and serene, the joints moved freely, and the spirit settled in peace. To eat out of season seizes upon the workings of Nature—this is the Great Dao. Hence it is said: 'Eat in season, and the hundred bones will be in order.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When the Original *Qi* flows through the hundred passes, how should one employ it?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"The *qi* of Heaven is soft and yielding, penetrating sinews and bones, nourishing the spirit and calming the essence—all to make the joints flow freely. Who does not know that regulating *qi* is the foundation of humanity? The foundation of humanity is the *qi* of Heaven! Thus the common folk use it daily without knowing. The rising and falling of *qi*, the ebb and flow of yin and yang, all have their times. Receiving a single breath of *qi* nourishes all things, as the *lingzhi* mushroom thrives in winter without dying. So too, when a person attains the Dao, they do not die—this is when the Original *Qi* flows through the hundred passes.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Stirring the mechanism, all transformations are at peace. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"The divine mechanism operates within, and through myriad transformations, the Dao is naturally realized. Hence the mechanism—it opens the Heavenly Pass, and the Jade Gate closes of its own accord. When fire ignites the Heavenly Pass, it refines the marrow into pure yang, and fire follows, long refined into elixir—thus it is called the mechanism. All transformations—when *qi* condenses into spirit, returning to the Golden Pass at dawn—naturally settle the spirit, preserving the body for long life without death. The mechanism is subtlety. When a person moves the mechanism, their body transforms endlessly, inner and outer in harmony, the Dao of spirit united. Hence it is said: 'Stirring the mechanism, all transformations are at peace.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"People know their spirit when it manifests, but not how it manifests when unseen. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"People observe external omens of good and ill fortune and pray earnestly for their fulfillment, unaware that within their own bodies lies the spirit—capable of communicating with Heaven and Earth, of inner cultivation to attain the Dao, of manifesting the divine yang-spirit’s sacred communion. Why seek it externally? Essence begets *qi*; essence is the mother of *qi*, and spirit is the child of *qi*—these are the Three Treasures. Refined into the True Person, they are called Immortals. Hence it is said: 'This is how the spirit manifests.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The sun and moon have their cycles, great and small have their measures. From this, the sage’s work arises, and the divine light emerges. What is the mechanism of this Dao?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang. Thus they move and fulfill their numbers, traversing the world, combining cold and heat. Sixty days complete one cycle; four cycles complete a full measure, fulfilling the intent of Heaven and Earth. Fixed in the sun and moon, they circulate within the Dao—hence 'entering and exiting sun and moon, abiding within the numbers.' The numbers are One; One is *qi*; *qi* condenses into spirit, and the divine light emerges. The divine light is yang-essence—nothing escapes its discernment, nothing evades its illumination. Thus the sage probes the union of sun and moon, and the divine light emerges, knowing the workings of Heaven and Earth’s creation, seizing the mechanisms of yin and yang’s transformations, and thus generating the spirit. Entering the hidden and emerging from the obscure, the numbers coalesce into One to form the person. The Dao is non-action. The mechanism is the heart’s intent. Skilled in unleashing the transformations of yin and yang, entering the boundless numbers—this is the rectitude of the Dao’s non-action. The mechanism is release. The sage seizes this mechanism: nine yangs and six yins, unified into One—thus the sun and moon have their cycles, great and small their measures.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"None under Heaven can know it, none can see it. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"For those of the world who are greedy, covetous, and given to licentious indulgence, they do not know the Dao of Heaven and lose their mechanism, dissipate their essence, and scatter their spirit. None can know it because the Dao’s mechanism is profound, and yin and yang remain unseen. Not recognizing the workings of Nature—this is why they do not know. They lose their spirit, scatter their blood and *qi*—how could they know? Those who would know must still the heart, cultivate the nature, steady the *qi*, and preserve the spirit—then clarity arises of its own accord. This is the Dao; this is seeing the spirit. Hence it is said: 'None under Heaven can know it, none can see it.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The noble attains it and endures hardship; the petty know it and slight their lives. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"Thus the sage endures hardship in the Great Dao, capable of harmonizing the principles of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, securing their life. The sage attains knowledge, steadies their *qi*, and does not lose their essence. When essence and *qi* unite, they form the Great Medicine—all through knowing the workings of Nature, refining the spirit without scattering, steadying the *qi* and harmonizing the spirit. The petty do not know the root of life and spirit and thus cannot preserve them, losing their body and life. Not guarding their spirit but indulging the world, they lose their spirit and slight their lives, failing to preserve themselves—thus they die. The noble practices it diligently and endures hardship; the petty slight their lives, always dissipating their spirit and losing their bodies. Hence it is said: 'The noble attains it and endures hardship, while the petty slight their lives.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Those who scrutinize the autumn hair’s tip do not see the great mountain; those who listen to the rustling of insects do not hear the thunder. Those who excel in hearing are not because their ears are keen, but because they discern sounds and thereby self-destruct; those who excel in sight are not because their eyes are sharp, but because they scrutinize colors and thereby self-destruct. The blind, not seeing the light of sun and moon, discern the interplay of yin and yang, and through long practice attain longevity. The deaf, not hearing thunder, discern the passage of sun and moon, and through long practice attain enduring vision.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The Dao/Way is such that the one who attains it remains in poverty, while the petty slight their lives.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Those who perceive the Dao/Way’s workings within, do not see its external manifestations; those who hear the Dao/Way’s resonance within, do not hear its external sounds. These two—perception and hearing—are in harmony with the Dao/Way. Thus it is said: 'The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.'*\n\nFrom the *Yinfu Jing* of the Three Sovereigns, the *Jade Precepts* (卷中竟).\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Cut off one source of profit, and you employ the Master tenfold. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Cut off fame and abandon profit, and the primordial *qi* naturally preserves itself. Abandon cleverness and discard wisdom, and thieves and robbers will have no sway. Cut off attachment to sounds and colors, and further employ the primordial *qi*. Embrace the One and guard the center, and you surpass the noble tenfold. The Supreme Dao/Way employs the Great Dao/Way, reaching perfection in the world and becoming Sage. The Master conceals fire within the central source; long practice renders it motionless, and when it moves, it naturally aligns with the Great Dao/Way. Using wisdom and cleverness, one departs from desire, thereby employing the Master tenfold. Thus it is said: 'Cut off one source of profit, and you employ the Master tenfold.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Threefold return of day and night, and you employ the Master ten-thousandfold. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Threefold return refers to the Three Primordials. The Heavenly Primordial *qi* resides above, the Spirit Source Primordial *qi* in the center, and the Root Source Primordial *qi* below. Thus, *jingqi* (精气) is the Master; the heart is the sovereign; the body is the furnace. Employing *jingqi* day and night, encountering the Three Primordials, boundless above and below, you employ it with tenfold efficacy. The spirit’s primordial *qi* does not scatter, the form does not decay, and thus it harmonizes with day and night. By day, the sun’s *qi* is employed and the yang is illuminated; the night’s *qi* is drawn inward, and the yin *qi* is expended outward. The yang *qi* is the root of the spirit; the yin *qi* is the ruin of the form. If one can let the spirit’s primordial *qi* meet the ancestral *qi* of the Three Primordials, blending above and below into unity, like the Master commanding the ten-thousand spirits to transform together, their spirits never cease, the yin shadows all vanish, and the Three Yangs reside alone within—after long practice, the spirit returns to its original state, hence deathlessness. Thus it is said: 'Threefold return of day and night, and you employ the Master ten-thousandfold.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The heart is born of things, yet dies by things. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Using the heart means letting the mind move. When the mind moves, the spirit shifts, and when the spirit shifts, the *qi* scatters—when the *qi* scatters, life departs, hence death. A steady heart means a settled spirit. The Master regulates the heart, aligning it with the One source of *qi*, harmonizing its internal workings, and letting all transformations flow through. A disordered heart means all spirits are lost; thus, abandoning emotions and desires, the ten-thousand spirits will not be lost to things. Hence it is said: 'The heart is born of things, yet dies by things.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The mechanism lies in the eyes. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"The Dao/Way’s distant aspect lies beyond the Eight Transformations, its near aspect between the brows and eyelashes. It encompasses the vastness of heaven and earth, yet penetrates the fine threads of an eyebrow. When the spirit’s mechanism moves within, the eyelashes stir like lead—thus the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eyes, for there is a divine chamber between them. The internal workings of this mechanism manifest in the eyes. When extraordinary visions align with the Dao/Way, yin evils naturally perish, the true realm returns to purity, and the yang spirit is seen in the heavenly Dao/Way. Thus it is said: 'The mechanism lies in the eyes.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Heaven’s greatest lack of favor, yet great favor is born. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Heaven’s Dao/Way transforms the lower realm, and all things naturally arise—this is the birth of great favor. One must not indulge the heart with color and desire, lest it be disordered by false favors and thus bring death. Calm the heart to preserve the spirit, and it will flow naturally—does one not know that crows are not dyed yet black, cranes do not bathe yet white, spiders need no teaching to weave their webs, and swallows come without being summoned? Thus, great favor is born naturally. Hence it is said: 'Heaven’s greatest lack of favor, yet great favor is born.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Swift as lightning, fierce as wind—none fail to comply. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Swift as thunder and fierce as wind are the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang. If a person can nourish the wind’s *qi*, employing the *qi* of yin and yang, the primordial *jingqi* above and below, they will comply naturally. When the Dao/Way is practiced and the body moves, the yin and yang spirits internally blend, the true essence ascends and enters the brain, then descends swiftly as wind and thunder. The Three Primordials are fully manifested, and the hundred bones glow with fire—refining the yin and returning to pure yang, hence the Sage swiftly completes the Dao/Way. Internally cultivating the true body, its marvels unfold—like the rare grasses that receive the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang, hence they do not die, and none fail to comply. Thus it is said: 'Swift as lightning, fierce as wind—none fail to comply.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Greatest joy leaves a residue, greatest stillness brings purity. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Greatest joy in the spirit is the root of yin and yang. 'Greatest' means settled—settled in heart and mind, and yin and yang naturally harmonize. Greatest stillness brings purity. The eyes do not gaze upon colors, the spirit does not shift, the *qi* is preserved naturally—this is the greatest joy of Heavenly Truth. Abandon desire, still the heart, settle the mind, guard the spirit, and embrace the One in greatest stillness, entering the New to replace the Old—thus attaining the Dao/Way. The Sage aligns nature and life with Heaven’s Dao/Way; firm resolve brings purity. Hence it is said: 'Greatest joy leaves a residue, greatest stillness brings purity.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Heaven’s utmost selfishness, yet its use is most public. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Heaven is the clear yang *qi*—its utmost selfishness is the hidden emergence, giving birth to all things. The person within it, when restored to purity, attains the Dao/Way. If one can gather and preserve the primordial *qi*, nourishing Heaven’s Truth, and further master its functions to perfect the Dao/Way, this is called utmost publicness. The primordial *jingqi* solidifies the body—those who know depend on the times to employ it: ascending into the *nirvana* (泥丸), descending into the *sea of origins* (海源), meeting in the *Central Palace* (中宫), to receive the primordial *qi*, pass the *Primordial Pass* (元关), and approach the *Golden Gate* (金阙). The Three Fields (三田) mutually irrigate, and the hundred joints all harmonize—fire blazes throughout the body. Refined long and thoroughly, one attains the Dao of the Immortal. Thus it is said: 'Heaven’s utmost selfishness, yet its use is most public.'\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The bird is governed by qi. Why so?*\nThe True Man of Heaven replied: *The bird is the crow—crow is the heart’s qi. Thus it soars and descends at its appointed times. Qi is the manifestation of the void; when a person gathers it, prolonged refinement yields the Dao of the Immortal. The bird is the fire of the South; when a person attains its Way, the True Qi endures like a bird flying through the void. If one can seize and gather it within the Central Primordial, refining it into True Yang, then one attains the Dao of the Flying Immortal. Hence it is said: 'The bird is governed by qi.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Why so?*\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied: *Those skilled in life perish by fate. If one steadies the heart and eliminates the Six Desires and Seven Emotions, the spirit settles and the Dao arises. If the heart generates desires and emotions, the spirit scatters and fate is lost—the root of death. When the heart dies, eternal rebirth is attained—this is the root of life and death.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *Kindness arises from harm; harm arises from kindness. Why so?*\nThe True Man of Heaven replied: *The Sage’s kindness arises from the Dao; the commoner’s kindness arises from emotion, destroying the body and harming fate. To take from the surplus and supplement the deficient—those with surplus are those whose hearts harbor desires, while the deficient are those whose spirit scatters. When the heart indulges in desire and lust, kindness breeds harm and the spirit perishes. If one can clear the heart without weariness, the spirit naturally illuminates—this is harm yielding kindness. With steadfast resolve and unperturbed cultivation, harm is forgotten, and the spirit is preserved. Thus the Dao harmonizes and delights the heart, extinguishing joy and preserving the spirit, abandoning emotion and desire—this is the Sage. Hence it is said: 'Kindness arises from harm; harm arises from kindness.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *The foolish man takes Heaven and Earth’s patterns as the Sage’s virtue; I take the timing of things as the philosopher’s wisdom. Why so?*\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied: *The commoner knows only of Heaven and Earth’s patterns, speaking of the Sage’s outward form while unaware that I possess the yin-yang of Heaven and Earth within. Yin and yang are the unfathomable laws of ghosts and gods, the vast and subtle principles through which Heaven and Earth communicate. The foolish man’s works are ignorant; he does not know that I, along with Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang and the timing of things, are all the same. The principles of Heaven and Earth are the Sage’s mechanism. The utmost Dao is the origin of all things, the essence of yin and yang—thus its transformations are boundless. When the Dao reaches its utmost refinement, it is mine. The Dao’s spontaneity gives rise to all things; I am the philosopher. Yin and yang cannot overcome me, for I am the same and thus victorious. Victory is my spirit; the spirit is the source of the utmost Dao. Hence I am divine, and my yin-yang aligns with the Sage. Heaven and Earth—two *qi* conjoin, and all things are the same. My spirit transcends time, and I am Sage to the Great Dao. I comprehend the Great Dao encompassing Heaven and Earth; wisdom is now complete. The essence of True Reality—naturally, I am transformed into the Three Pure Ones.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice in reverence, thanking the Holy Sovereign for enlightening his ignorance. The Sage then ascended to the sky upon a clouded crane, and the Yellow Emperor returned to his capital in his carriage.\n\n*The Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts of the Yin Symbol Classic, Lower Scroll, ends.*",

A protective master of the Qi lineage, the *Kui* teacher, stepped forward to report: *\"There is a monstrous bird-beast—copper-headed, iron-browed, three *zhang* tall, with wings like blades. It blots out the sun and moon in flight, and when on land, it devours stone and scatters sand, drying up rivers and harming countless lives. The empire is in chaos.\"*\n\nThus, I commanded the ministers and the imperial retinue to personally inspect the suffering of the people. Upon seeing it, I confirmed that *Chi You* indeed had summoned this monstrous bird, which could not be subdued.\n\nI traveled to a great mountain, where at night I saw crimson light, violet mist, and white vapors with greenish clouds swirling endlessly. All the ministers, when summoned to observe, saw the same.\n\nThe *Kui* teacher reported: *\"This mountain is called the First Cavern of the Empty Heaven Altar, overlooking the Jade Purity Palace of the Primordial Origin.\"*\n\nI ascended the mountain myself and found a stone cavern of unknown depth. I dispatched a valiant warrior named Zhongshan—three *zhang* and five *chi* tall—to enter with torches. After three days and nights, he emerged.\n\nZhongshan reported: *\"Within, there was a great stone chest guarded by eight armored divine warriors, each wielding an axe and a sword, shouting: ‘None may take this!’\"*\n\nAfter his report, I lit incense and prayed to the Three Pure Ones, beseeching their favor to open the chest for me, regardless of fortune or misfortune, so that I might know the secrets of heaven and earth.\n\nHaving completed the rites, I entered the cavern with the ministers. The red light encircled us, and the armored guards vanished. Within the stone chest, I found a scroll titled:\n*\"The Primordial Lord’s *Hun Yuan Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts of the Yin Fu Jing*\".\nI took the scroll from the chest, lit incense, and paid homage to the Three Pure Ones in gratitude.\n\nUpon opening it, the characters were unlike any I had seen—all celestial script (*tianwen zhuanshu*), three hundred characters in total, divided into three scrolls:\n- **Upper Scroll (Heavenly Sovereign):** The Dao of the gods embracing unity.\n- **Middle Scroll (Earthly Sovereign):** The methods for enriching the nation and securing the people.\n- **Lower Scroll (Human Sovereign):** The arts of strengthening armies and achieving victory in battle.\n\nThis text aligns with the origins of heaven, earth, yin, yang, and all things as ancestral principles. It encompasses the Dao of governing the state, harmonizing the family, and preserving life without death.\n\nThe script was naturally formed by the pure *qi* of Qingyang, each character a perfect square, one *zhang* in width.\n\nUpon my return to the capital, I convened the ministers again to discuss the scroll’s meaning. None knew its principles or had ever heard of its origin.\n\nI then issued a decree across the empire, searching the sacred mountains and hidden grottoes for reclusive sages or virtuous scholars who might understand its teachings. If anyone had obtained this scroll, they were to present it with an explanation. Those who mastered the *Yin Fu Jing* would be rewarded with gold and noble titles.\n\nYet no one in the world possessed this scroll—how could they comprehend its meaning?\n\nFor forty years, I sought out mountain hermits and Daoist adepts, bowing to them as teachers in my quest for immortality, yet none could explain the scroll’s principles. All offered only minor, tangential methods.\n\nAt last, I heard that on the *Kongtong* Mountain lived a high sage, Master Guangchengzi, whose Dao was profound and mysterious. I personally journeyed there, humbling myself with knee-crawling and elbow-walking reverence. I pleaded for his instruction: *\"From the stone chamber, I obtained the *Yin Fu Jing*. Its meaning eludes me, and no one in the world understands it. Now that I have met you, I am grateful to heaven and earth—I must know its mysteries.\"*\n\nMaster Guangchengzi replied: *\"This scroll is a celestial secret. Hidden in the world’s caverns, it suppresses demons, dragons, and spirits. It belongs to those of virtue. Whoever obtains it may walk the path of longevity and ascend to heaven, passing it down eternally to those of Daoist faith.*\n\n*Yet its meaning is known by none in the world. Now, on the Emei Mountain, there is a high sage, the True Man of Heaven (*Tian Zhen Huang Ren*), who fully understands its principles.\"*\n\nGuangchengzi accompanied me to pay homage to the True Man of Heaven. I asked: *\"How does one practice the *Yin Fu Jing*—the Heavenly Sovereign, Earthly Sovereign, and Human Sovereign—mastering yin and yang’s transformations, governing the state, the family, and the self, achieving immortality, and ascending to the celestial realm?\"*\n\nAs Master Guangchengzi had said, the True Man of Heaven answered.\n\nAt that moment, I fully grasped the principles of yin and yang’s transformations and the Dao of attainment. When I achieved the Dao and ascended to heaven, I feared that future Daoist practitioners would lack a scripture to follow. Thus, I disseminated this text across the world, hiding one scroll in the *Kongtong* Mountain and leaving the Nine Palaces, the *luo* divinations, the division of yin and yang and the Five Phases, the seizing of transformations, and the activation of celestial mechanisms.\n\nWithin, there are:\n- The Nine Palaces’ formations,\n- The *Xuanji* (Celestial Pivot) and the *Lü* (Lunar Lodge) aligned,\n- The timing of seasons and nodes,\n- The birth and death of metal and wood,\n- The selection of true treasures,\n- The harnessing of transformations,\n- The internal alchemy of light and pure yang essence,\n- The reversal of the *Jingling* (Golden Spirit) tiger’s transformation,\n- The ascent through the *Huo Long* (Flame Dragon) void,\n- The soaring above the *Yan Tian* (Flame Heaven),\n- The entry into the *Sheng Chao Yuan* (Sacred Dynasty’s Origin) Dao.\n\nIt also divides the transformations of yin and yang:\n- The sun and moon as symbols,\n- Heaven and earth as parents,\n- The Eight Trigrams as descendants,\n- The Great One (*Tai Yi*) moving through *Kan* (Water), *Gen* (Mountain), *Zhen* (Thunder), *Xun* (Wind), *Li* (Fire), *Dui* (Lake),\n- The celestial activation of killing intent,\n- The shifting of stars and lodges,\n- The diagram of the Nine Palaces.",

The misfortune will extend even to their descendants.\n\nHuangdi asked: What is meant by *Yin Fu* (阴符)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: These two characters, *Yin Fu*, can reach up to the heavens and down to the earth; within them, one can refine and generate all things. They are the most honored of all teachings for humanity.\n*Yin* means \"dark\"; *Fu* means \"harmony.\"\nThe ancient sages, through the inner workings of *Yin Fu*, could illuminate the fundamental principles of Heaven and Earth’s transformations, the source of the Dao’s progression, and the essence of life and death.\nThe mechanism of birth and death: those who know can harmonize with the workings of Heaven and Earth, cultivate the body to achieve longevity, and thus say, *Yin Fu*.\n\nHuangdi said: What of those above who practice the *Dao* of \"embracing unity\" (*Shenxian bao yi* 神仙抱一) to become immortals?\n\nTianzhen Huangren (天真皇人) replied: The *Dao* of \"embracing unity\" is a secret of the heavens, beyond the reach of mortals. The immortals who embrace unity are those who contain the *Yin Fu* of the Great One (*Tai Yi*).\nThe Great One is the source of the *Tai Yuan* (太渊) at the North Pole, the *Dao* of refining *qi* into the void, a secret of the heavens, unknown to the world. How could you, dwelling among mortals, comprehend these words?\nUnity (*Yi*) is the *qi* of Heaven.\nIf one harmonizes the Great One’s *Yin Fu* with their own *Yin Fu*, they must further know the timing of Heaven’s reception, the celestial *qi* interfacing with human *qi*, human *qi* interfacing with celestial *qi*, and thus harmonizing with Heaven’s *qi* without perishing.\nIf one contains the Great Harmony’s *Yin Fu* and refines it over time, it becomes the Great Elixir (*Da Dan* 大丹) of pure yang.\nYang is the Dao of Heaven; thus, the *qi* of the immortal harmonizes with the Dao, becoming the *Dao* of \"embracing unity.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What of those in the middle who seek to enrich the nation and bring peace to the people?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: To enrich the nation and bring peace to the people is the *Dao* of refining *qi*.\nCommon folk refine their true essence (*Zhenjing* 真精) into a divine embryo (*Shentai* 神胎), known as the \"embryonic immortal\" (*Taixian* 胎仙).\nThus, gathering forms the shape; dispersing forms the *qi*.\nHence, they harmonize with the Dao.\nThe Dao is to nourish *qi*; to nourish *qi* is to preserve the spirit and merge with the Great Dao.\nThus, it is said: \"Harmonize the true *qi*, over time refine with fire to form the elixir (*Dan*).\"\nIf one fully preserves the *qi* of essence and refines it into pure yang, they become the elixir that transmutes the form, and all spirits settle in peace. The nation holds treasures, hence it is said: \"Enrich the nation and bring peace to the people.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What of those below who achieve military strength and victory in battle?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: Military strength and victory in battle come from the true *qi* repelling yin *qi*.\nRefining the body into pure yang, one cultivates golden sinews and jade bones, a crane’s body and pine’s form—this is pure yang. Thus, they achieve immortality.\nWith the body as the nation, the mind as the sovereign, the essence as the people, and the form as the furnace.\nThe head is the *Ding* (鼎, cauldron).\nWhen essence fills the brain, one uses fire to refine it into the elixir.\nEssence (*Jing*) meets fire (*Huǒ*), and breath (*Xi*) is wind (*Feng*).\nUsing wind to fan the fire, over time refining until both form and spirit are perfected.\nThus, it is said: \"The *Dao* of refining the spirit is to preserve the mind within; the true *qi* naturally harmonizes and does not perish.\"\nHence: \"Refine the hundred passports (*Bai Guan* 百关) of essence and marrow (*Jingsuí* 精髓), achieving pure yang.\nWhen the *qi* of the nine orifices (*Jiǔqiào* 九窍) is stabilized at the lower passport (*Xiàguān* 下关), and the essence-*qi* does not leak, victory is attained.\"\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Tian Huang* (天皇)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: *Tian Huang* is before the primal beginning (*Xiantian* 先天), the first transformation of the Five Calamities (*Wu Jie* 五劫), the origin of chaos (*Hundun* 混沌).\nThe *Tian Huang*’s single *qi* manifests all phenomena, governing the Heavenly Sacred Jade (*Shengyu* 圣玉) and the Sacred Void (*Shengjing* 圣境).\nIt is the ancestral *qi* of the *Ming Huang* (明皇).\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Di Huang* (地皇)?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: *Di Huang* is when the single *qi* of *Tian Huang* descends to the earth, and the earthly *qi* receives it. The two *qi*s harmonize, generating the *qi* of golden light (*Shenghua* 生化) and forming the realm of the Perfected Spirit (*Dongshen* 洞神).\nIt is the true ancestral *qi* of the *Zhen Huang* (真皇).\n\nHuangdi asked: What is the *Ren Huang* (人皇)?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: *Ren Huang* exists between Heaven and Earth, in the void of ultimate reason (*Xuwu zhi li* 虚无至理), where the single *qi* of *Tian Huang* and *Di Huang* harmonizes within the boundless void.\nThe Five Stars of metal and wood form the central palace (*Zhonggong* 中宫), and the Eight Trigrams of *Kan* (乾) and *Kun* (坤) protect and refine the spirit, making it the realm of the immortal in the Middle Element (*Zhongyuan* 中元).\nIt is the ancestral *qi* of *Ren Huang*.\n\nHuangdi asked: To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its movements—is that all?\n\nTianzhen Huangren replied: To observe Heaven is to perceive the *qi* of the Green Yang (*Qingyang* 青阳), the pure yang substance.\nThe essence-*qi* circulates without ceasing, rising and descending, returning and beginning anew, encompassing all phenomena—this is the *qi* of the Green Yang.\nHeaven and Earth are the essences of yin and yang; the celestial *qi* descends, and the earthly *qi* ascends, ascending and descending in turn, yet mortals remain unaware of its principles.\nThe yang essence of Heaven is the sun, and the yin essence of Earth is the moon.\nThe sun and moon move without rest, and the cold and heat alternate without pause.\nCommon folk do not know that within their bodies lies the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, rising and descending in due time.\nThose who know observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp its movements—thus, it is complete.\n\nHuangdi asked: What is meant by \"unknowing\"?\n\nGuangchengzi replied: The head symbolizes Heaven, the origin of clear yang; the feet symbolize Earth, the source of turbid yin.\nIf one internally contains the Dao of Heaven and Earth, they align with Heaven and Earth’s lifespan.\nWithin the human body lies the true yang *qi*, hidden inside the yin essence.\nThe essence-*qi* is the mother of the true *qi*; the true *qi* is the child of the essence-*qi*.\nIf one constantly guards the child and mother, they will not perish.\nReturning to the source, they become human, unaware of the passage of time.\nAbove the *Tian Shū* (天枢, Celestial Pivot), the single *qi* of *Tian Yuan* (天元) governs it;\nBelow the *Tian Shū*, the single *qi* of *Di Yuan* (地元) governs it;\nWithin the *Tian Shū*, the true source of yin and yang governs it.\nHumans utilize Heaven’s timing; the single *qi* of *Hunyuan Zhengyi* (混元正一) is boundless above and below, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s lifespan.»",

Why?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"Heaven receives the One *Qi*, internally containing the Five Stars’ true *qi*, drawing from the sources of purity and turbidity. Earth receives the One *Qi*, thus generating the Two Complements, which ascend back to Heaven, completing the Three Primordials. The Four Seasons unfold, with Five *Qi* within, driving their revolutions to complete the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Bandits are the Five Phases’ true *qi*. Humans who plunder Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, usurp yin and yang’s transformations, disrupt the Three Primordials’ reversals, and reverse the Four Gates’ exchanges—when the One *Qi* aligns, the Dao is achieved. These are the Five Bandits.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one utilize Heaven’s Five Bandits?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Five Bandits are the Five *Qi*. They nourish all things, governing life and death, the mechanisms of transformation. Initially, Heaven gathered the Five *Qi* to form shape, dispersing as wind. If you know their source, it resides within you, filling your body. Your essence-*qi* harmonizes with Heaven’s *qi*, and through prolonged refinement, it becomes the elixir—the Five Phases’ true *qi*.\n\nHeaven’s *qi* descends; Earth’s *qi* receives it without separation. Humans dwell within them, enveloped by the Five *Qi*. If one plunders them, they do not die.\n\nI am now twenty-two thousand years old—all because I understood the Five Bandits’ transformations and reversals.\n\nNow I transmit the Five Bandits’ principles to you. You and I are the same. If you do not know the Five Bandits’ principles, you will die. But if you follow my words and plunder Heaven and Earth’s Five Stars’ *qi*, you will not die. This is the principle of the Five Bandits.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"The Five Bandits reside in the heart, yet act upon Heaven—why?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"Within the human body lie the Five Phases’ true *qi*—the *qi* of the Five Viscera. The Five Viscera’s *qi* are the Five Bandits.\n\nWater’s share belongs to the kidneys. Before birth, the Dao is the foundation; first emerges the left kidney, mirroring the Northern Abyss’s source, the origin of transformation, the *qi* of Azure Yang, named the Azure Dragon, affiliated with Wood.\n\nNext emerges the right kidney, affiliated with Metal, containing true essence, governing the Five Phases’ true *qi*, named the White Tiger—the One *Qi* of the White Lord.\n\nWithin the two kidneys, two white vessels rise, surging upward to the Celestial Yang Palace, descending to connect with *Xun*. At the center of *Kun*, the Five *Qi* gather, aligning with *Qian*, while *Gen* emerges with *Tian Jia*, entering *Wu Ji*’s domain—this is the beginning of the Dao generating spirit.\n\nHumans align with Heaven’s timing, interfacing with Heaven and Earth’s *qi*. The head’s roundness mirrors Heaven; the feet’s squareness mirrors Earth. The central *Qi* gathers, entering the Vermilion Palace, reaching the sinews and bones, ascending to the Cauldron within, then descending to the Gushing Spring, entering the Central Yellow Palace. All spirits merge, so when Azure Yang reaches the summit, all yin disperses. Then, utilizing the Five Phases’ true *qi*, internally refining into a single elixir within the Cauldron, one does not die—this is acting upon Heaven.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"The Cosmos lies within the hands—why?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Cosmos is the origin of Heaven, Earth, yin, yang, and all things, shaped by yin and yang. Yin is Earth’s *qi*; yang is Heaven’s *qi*. Heaven’s *qi* descends; Earth’s *qi* receives it. Earth’s *qi* ascends; Heaven’s *qi* meets it. When Heaven’s and Earth’s *qi* intersect, yin and yang resonate, and all spirits transform and manifest.\n\nAncient Sages grasped Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang transformations’ primordial mechanism. The mechanism lies in utilization—those who know guard it. Guarding is the Dao, and thus one does not die.\n\nHence it is said: *The Cosmos lies within the hands.*\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one utilize the Cosmos within the hands?\"*\n\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth unite, the Cosmos does not disperse within. Transformation generates spirit, establishing yin-yang’s divine mechanisms—thus the Great Dao is achieved.\n\nThe Great Dao is non-action. Non-action prevents chaos in fate; fate unperturbed keeps spirit steadfast; spirit unshaken prevents essence from scattering; essence undispersed ensures *qi* does not falter. Further, with Dao-*qi* circulating to fortify the body, if refined with essence and fire in tandem, forming the Golden Elixir—this is natural.\n\nI know the Cosmos’ mechanisms and continuously enact them, aligning with Heaven and Earth’s workings, never letting them stray. Over time, the spirit naturally ascends to the Primordial—thus one does not die. This is *the Cosmos within the hands.*\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What does it mean that ten thousand transformations arise from the body?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The ten thousand transformations are the spirit. When essence does not scatter, the spirit does not depart. The Spirit Chamber is where all spirits congregate, located within Kunlun’s heart.\n\nThe Five *Qi* gather within; if one forms a spirit-fetus from true essence-*qi*, ascending to the Cauldron above, one is called *the Most Sage*. All spirits unite as one. Common folk, however, dissipate essence and lose *qi*, unable to preserve the spirit—thus they do not know the law of generating the body.\n\nThe law of generating the body is the Dao of yin and yang. Hence it is said: *Ten thousand transformations arise from the body.*\"",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is the Dao of the singular Qi that generates the body?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"From the singular Qi all things arise, yet one does not know how the singular Qi creates and transforms. One generates two, two generate three, and three generate ten thousand things. When a person receives the singular Qi, it transforms into the Three Qi—spirit, *qi*, and essence—and thus it is the Dao of generating the body.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is this 'one'?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The 'one' is the root of Heaven and Earth, the progenitor of yin and yang, and the origin of all things. It is the source of generating the spirit. If one can know the true essence-Qi of the 'one,' then all things will arise of their own accord and one will not die. Hence it is called 'one.' The Yellow Emperor said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism. What does this mean?'*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"Heaven uses the celestial *Lù* (斗) to govern its mechanism; humans use the heart as their mechanism. The heart is the spirit. When the heart’s mechanism aligns with the Dao, then the mysteries of ghosts and gods are realized. Before a person is born, they first receive the singular Qi as their fate, then the yin and yang Qi of their parents combine, and thus form is achieved. The spirit-fetus generates the spirit, so it is the origin of human nature. If a person can still their heart, like the movement of Heaven and Earth’s mechanism, they will be in harmony with Heaven and Earth. Thus, through the stillness of nature, the heart’s mechanism aligns with the Dao. Hence it is said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How should one use the human heart as the mechanism?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The human heart is the origin of the mechanism. If one can preserve the heart and guard the spirit without forgetting the mechanism’s function, the heart is the source of all spirits. Calming the heart nurtures human nature. Thus the Sage calms their heart, embraces the origin, and contains the true essence. Containing the true essence is calming the nature. To take the heart as nature, to take *qi* as fate—when *qi* is exhausted, fate departs, and all is disordered in nature. Thus, they lose their *qi* and die. If one, like the Heavenly *qi*, remains clear and pure, they will not lose their nature. When nature is not lost, *qi* does not scatter; when *qi* does not scatter, fate does not depart; when fate does not depart, the form does not perish. Heaven and Earth are the origin of nature and fate. Hence it is said: 'The nature of Heaven is the human Dao; the human heart is the mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What is the Dao of establishing Heaven’s mechanism to stabilize the human Dao? What does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is the pure yang *qi*, so it takes pure yang as its foundation. If humans can contain the essence-Qi of Heaven’s transforming mechanism, like Heaven and Earth’s yang without abandoning it, and receive the singular correct *qi*, nurturing the body with the pure yang Dao of all spirits, then it is said: 'To establish Heaven’s mechanism to stabilize the human Dao.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How should one use the Dao of establishing Heaven’s mechanism?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is the foundation of humanity. Parents are the beginning of humanity. If one can retain the form in its foundation without losing it to its beginning, and harmonize the spirit with the Dao, then it is said: 'To establish Heaven’s mechanism.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"How does one retain the form without losing it to its beginning?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"If humans do not indulge in worry, anxiety, or overthinking, they will not lose their foundation. If they avoid illness, fatigue, and hardship, they will not lose their beginning. To lose one’s foundation is to destroy one’s fate; to lose one’s beginning is to return the form to the earth. If humans can cultivate and refine themselves according to the Dao, their *qi* will not lose its beginning—this is to know the principle. Hence it is said: 'The Dao of Heaven is the foundation of humanity; parents are the beginning of humanity.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change—what does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The mother of Heaven is the *Tàiyì* (太易). Within, it conceals the yin and yang Qi—these are the sun and moon. Before the sun and moon were divided, the Sage’s transformation generated the spirit, named *Tàiyī* (太一) as its origin. Then the sun and moon divided into yin and yang, and yin and yang further divided into the Five *Tàis* (五太). The Five *Tàis* are the Five Emperors. The Five Emperors then divided into the Eight *Guà* (卦), which pay homage to the center. The Sage’s transformation became the Nine Palaces, which is the divine palace of *Tàiyī*. Established are the Five Celestial *Lùs* (斗), with the Central *Lù* (中斗) within. The sun, moon, and stars are odd, and the Northern *Lù* (斗) receives the mechanism, directing the movement of yin and yang. When yin is the mechanism, death occurs; when yang is the mechanism, life occurs. The combination of yin and yang as mechanisms forms the Dao. Thus, *Tàiyī* governs the killing and life mechanisms, circulating through the Eight *Guà*, shifting the stars and changing their lodges. To return yin to yang is to achieve longevity; to return yang to yin is to die by the killing mechanism. Heaven’s four seasons create transformations, and the Eight *Guà* cycle endlessly—within the human body, these are also present, though humans do not know them. If one remains in yin and is killed, they die; if they cycle through rebirth, they lose their human form. If humans can refine themselves to attain the Dao, they will not lose their human form nor die by the killing mechanism. Hence it is said: 'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"What does it mean to not lose one’s human form and avoid the killing mechanism? What does this entail?\"*\n\nThe Celestial True Man replied:\n*\"The *Tàiyī* (太一) abides within the Nine Palaces, entering and exiting at appointed times. It summons the Lord of the Great Yang to return to the Yang Hall, where the four seasons shift, the Eight *Guà* pay homage to the origin, and all spirits gather. The killing mechanism returns yin to yang, ordering the stars, and they return to the Golden Gate within. The Sage’s realm is supremely pure, and the Lord of the True Yang is *Bái Yuán Jūn* (白元君). If humans know this and can, with the true essence-Qi of *Tàiyī*, follow the mechanism and transform accordingly, returning to the pure yang of the Eight *Guà* and merging with the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth, causing the chapter of generating the spirit in the chaotic nine heavens to manifest, then they will realize the Dao of Heaven and attain eternal longevity, becoming true humans according to this transformation. Hence it is said: 'When Heaven unleashes the killing mechanism, causing the stars to shift and their lodges to change.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When Earth unleashes the killing mechanism, causing dragons and serpents to rise from the land—what does this mean?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"The harmonious singular Qi moves when it is unleashed, so Heaven’s mechanism does not cease. The killing mechanism is transformation. The dragon is the Heavenly *qi*—wind. The serpent is the Earthly *qi*—fire. If humans can circulate their essence-Qi, moving it up and down, seizing the mechanism of transformation, then the mysterious mechanism will depart. The Six Desires stir the mechanism’s balance, like the bodies of Heaven and Earth, where humans dwell. If there is true yang essence-Qi, it is called 'serpent,' ascending to connect with the primordial Heavenly *qi*, breathing and moving up and down, in resonance with Earth’s moving mechanism, rising and departing from the land.\"*",

Within it lies a true essence of one *hun* measure, pressed into the Earth’s soil. Two meridians connect it to the brain. The brain contains a chamber called the Palace of Spirit Yang, with two orifices: the left is the Orifice of Supreme Polarity, the right is the Orifice of Penetrating Spirit. It ascends to connect with Heavenly *qi* and descends to the Sea’s source—thus is called breathing. When Heavenly *qi* descends and Earthly *qi* ascends, the two *qi* meet, nourishing the true essence, which is called the Dragon. The root of Azure Yang, descending, is the Serpent—this is the Primordial *qi*. When the two *qi* intermingle, they form the elixir; refined long enough, they become the Dan, hence immortality. Then the Yang Spirit transcends the body’s bounds, and within the human form, the Earth unleashes the killing mechanism, and dragons and serpents rise from the land.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"When humans unleash the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse—why?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"When humans unleash the killing mechanism, they abandon the Six Desires and Seven Emotions. In stillness, they rest in emotion and intent; in motion, they move with spirit-mechanism. Internally, they employ spirit-*qi*, merging ascent and descent. Guarding the spirit is the Yang *qi*. The head’s roundness mirrors Heaven, the feet’s squareness mirrors Earth. When Heaven and Earth reverse, it is the ascent and descent of yin and yang; when humans reverse, breathing penetrates to the root. One inhale draws Heavenly *qi* downward, one exhale raises Earthly *qi*. Inhaling is Heavenly *qi*, exhaling is Earthly *qi*. My true *qi* meets them—humans can descend Earthly *qi* to the heavens above. Thus it is said: When humans unleash the killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"When Heaven and Man unite in unleashing, the myriad transformations find their foundation—why?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Heaven generates all things; humans are the foremost among the myriad living beings. Thus Heaven and Earth unite to nourish all things, and when humans harmonize essence-*qi*, all spirits rejoice. Heaven and Earth do not abandon them but follow, with spirit dwelling within. Spirit is the Dao of Heaven, and it loves purity. If impure, the spirit scatters, failing to align with Heaven’s Dao. The ancient sages preserved essence to nourish spirit, stored *qi* to nourish essence, and thus aligned with Heaven’s Dao, becoming True Persons. Heaven has one *qi*, Earth has two principles, within are three luminaries. The four seasons are complete, the five phases arrayed, the six extremes generating, the seven celestial officials as mechanisms, the eight trigrams unified, the nine palaces filling Heaven and Earth. The Five Star Revolving Sphere exists in humans as well. If humans receive Heaven and Earth’s singular *qi*, harmonizing with all spirits, aligning with the two principles, the Great Dan is formed. The singular *qi* moves endlessly through the four seasons; within, one *qi* spreads across the central soil. The five phases invert internally, the six yangs ascend to the Golden Threshold, the seven truths dwell eternally within the body, the eight trigrams arise in the Primordial Palace. The three luminaries mingle, white snow drifts; the seven officials complete their function, yellow sprouts grow within, the nine palaces thread through myriad phenomena—thus aligning with Heaven’s Dao. Hence it is said: When Heaven and Man unite in unleashing, the myriad transformations find their foundation.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"Nature has skill and clumsiness—how can it be concealed and stored? Why?\"*\n\nGuangchengzi replied:\n*\"Heaven’s nature cannot be disordered. If spirit-*qi* is disordered, one does not know how to manifest spirit. Concealing and storing means nature like the bright moon, naturally communicating with the Dao. The skilled internally govern Heaven’s mechanism; externally, nothing enters, thus concealing wisdom and storing spirit, aligning with Heaven’s Dao. The clumsy do not know their own spirit-*qi* aligns with the Dao. They let the heart and intent generate emotions, freely scattering spirit-*qi*, failing to understand Heaven and Earth’s transformations, confusing yin and yang—thus they die. Hence nature has skill and clumsiness.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"How does skillful nature conceal and store itself?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied:\n*\"Nature is spirit—it must not be disturbed. Thus when spirit is settled and *qi* harmonized, the Primordial *qi* descends. Concealing means not coveting desires or cravings; storing means hiding in spirit-light, with *qi* entering the Vermilion Palace, the gathering place of myriad spirits. Concealed and stored, unmoving, the myriad spirits do not scatter.

They enter and exit in due time, mingling as one, externally communicating through ears, eyes, mouth, and nose—the yin within. The three essentials: spirit-*qi* and essence merge, the Mysterious Female Jade Gate, ascending to Heaven, descending to Earth, centrally connecting with the three Sovereign Ancestral *qi*—this is the Dao of the three essentials. Moving or stilling the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose: observing with the eyes disturbs the heart, listening with the ears shifts the spirit, speaking with the mouth scatters *qi*, smelling with the nose turns essence and marrow into turbid yin-water. If deliberately kept still and unmoving, the heart’s two orifices—left called Mysterious, right called Female—descend into the Sea of *Qi*, ascending to the Mud Ball. This is where true *qi* communicates, causing spirit-*qi* to move the mechanism, the Jade Gate closing of its own accord. Piercing the spine’s victory, passing the three passes, and facing the North Pole, the Yang Palace moves to preserve the true spirit. The ancient sages said: Move with spirit-mechanism, still with heart-intent. Essence-*qi*-spirit are the three essentials. Thus it is said: The nine orifices’ evils lie in the three essentials.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked:\n*\"Fire arises from wood—when disaster strikes, it must conquer.

      "translated_text": "「Wood contains fire, and when fire erupts, it must consume. Its true *qi* is thus formed, its smoke and flames ascending to return to Heaven, while the fire consumes wood to become ash and return to Earth. By nature, humans harbor evil as fire; when fire arises, the spirit disperses, and when the spirit disperses, the *qi* departs. With *qi* gone, the body dies, the true Yang-*qi* returning to Heaven, the turbid Yin-essence to Earth. It is said: Fire arises from wood, yet water can extinguish it—thus no ash remains; humans harbor evil as fire, yet gentleness can suppress it—thus the body remains unharmed. When a person’s fire erupts, all their spirits scatter, and thus they die. But if a person can control their fire, disaster cannot overcome them, and they attain the Great Dao. Hence it is said: *Fire arises from wood, disaster strikes but must be conquered.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Deceit originates within a state, and when its time comes, it must collapse—why?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *Within a state lies deceit; if left unchecked, it will ruin the state. Within a person lies evil; if left unchecked, it will destroy their body. A state without deceit is at peace, a person without passions is secure. To remove deceit means to eliminate the Six Desires, the Seven Emotions, and the Three Corpses. If a person can control deceitful evil, they attain the Great Dao.* Hence it is said: *Deceit originates within a state, and when its time comes, it must collapse.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one achieve bodily security?*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *All things are thieves of Heaven’s true *qi*; within the human abdomen lies the pestilence (*wù*), which steals *qi* from all things and is called *wù* (pestilence). The pestilence transforms into flattery and deceit. Flatterers are thieves of my soul and spirit, dispersers of my *qi* and blood, and destroyers of my form. But if a person understands the transformations of Yin and Yang, they can kindle true fire to refine and eliminate the deceitful evil of Yin. Thus they slay the pestilence, preventing its harm, and achieve bodily security, returning to the Great Dao.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *To know and cultivate—this is called the sage. Why?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *The ancient sages used the spirit-mechanism to measure Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang, ascending and descending at their proper times. They knew the numbers of the fire’s critical moments, lowered the fire according to the times, and within the *Wu-Jǐ* (Steward) and *Jǐ* (Beginning) Palaces, they returned to the origin of life’s mother. Those who know return to their mother, lest they lose her. They then receive Heaven’s *qi* as the leader of Qingyang (Pure Yang), and merge Earth’s *qi* with the mother of true Yin. My spirit-*qi* and essence are preserved within; the Five *qi* are all complete, the heart still and without desire. Refining with fire, I transform into pure Yang; through Daoist cultivation, my vital essence returns to Yang spirit, my Yin passions utterly extinguished. My form becomes like a pine’s, my bones like jade; the hundred passes are sealed without leakage, ascending to the Heavenly Realm—thus I become a True Person. Hence it is said: *To know and cultivate is called the sage.*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* (Classic of Dark Patterns) concludes the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts, Upper Scroll*.\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* begins the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts, Middle Scroll*.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—this is the Dao’s principle.*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *Heaven gives life when a person returns to the original Dao, their true nature emerging and ascending, thus life. Internally harmonizing with Heaven’s creation, they reach the ultimate Dao and give birth to true essence. Hidden in the world, such a person can measure [the Dao]; their sage-like spirit-mechanism is internally clear, externally communicating with Heaven and Earth. Thus, those who know do not die.*\n\n*Heaven takes life when a person does not trust the Dao, recklessly harming their spirit-*qi*, exceeding Heaven’s limit, and thus dying—this is the killing.*\n\nHence it is said: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *How does one apply Heaven’s giving and taking?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *If a person cultivates the Dao without knowing Heaven’s times, they mistakenly return to the root and origin, thus dying. But if a person knows Heaven’s true *qi* and times, they return to the root and restore their command. They must understand that the Creator’s essence is the true source of emptiness, where Yin and Yang merge as One and become the Five Phases’ true *qi*. Heaven and Earth vie in victory, knowing advance and retreat—thus there is no birth or death. The human Dao is the foundation; if one does not know life and death, this is called supplementing the insufficient while harming the excess—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\nHence it is said: *Heaven gives life, Heaven takes life.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *Heaven and Earth are thieves of all things; all things are thieves of humans; humans are thieves of all things. When the Three Thefts are balanced, the Three Talents are secure. Why?*\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *Heaven nourishes all things with one *qi*. When Heaven and Earth’s *qi* disperse, all things steal it; when all things’ *qi* disperse, humans steal it. Humans know to steal all things’ true *qi* to nourish their form, further knowing to ascend and descend in harmony with Heaven’s times, to receive Heaven’s *qi* and grasp its transformations, achieving immortality and not dying. Thus humans steal Heaven and Earth’s *qi* from all things, and this is how they attain the Dao.*\n\n*If humans do not understand the transformations, all things will steal back humans’ *qi*—thus they live by the Five Grains and die by the Five Grains. This is how humans die from being stolen by all things.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *If humans steal all things, how do they not die?*\nThe Master Guangcheng replied: *Humans receive the harmonious *qi* of the cosmos to live, thus they do not die. Once they receive it, their passions and desires cause them to die. If they can preserve the One *qi*, they protect their spirit. Heaven nourishes all things with One *qi*, further giving Yin and Yang harmony and the Five Grains’ completeness, thus humans become full-bellied and strong-boned, not losing their essence-*qi*-spirit, and thus do not die. When the Three Thefts are balanced, humans can steal Heaven and Earth’s *qi* to communicate with their spirit and nature, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, thus securing the Three Talents. The human spirit and *qi* are in accord with Heaven and Earth, and they love purity and stillness. Thus sages remain serene and empty, true *qi* preserved in its origin, spirit guarded internally—how could they die?*\n\nHence, those who overindulge in food harm their essence and blood; those who overwork scatter their spirit-*qi*; those whose hearts rise with passions and desires—how could all things not steal from them? Thus, halting excessive intake of food and drink makes the body light; halting excessive thought and deliberation makes the spirit agile; halting excessive cravings and desires makes the spirit pure. Hence they attain the Dao—why seek it externally?",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: *\"When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Talents are at peace.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Thus it is said: 'Eat in season, and the hundred bones will be in order.' Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"In the Age of Great Antiquity, the sages ate the *qi* of Heaven in due measure, and naturally the hundred bones became supple and harmonious. Drawing the true *qi* of Great Harmony into the body-field, the five *zàng* organs became cool and clear, the six *fǔ* organs balanced and serene, the joints moved freely, and the spirit settled in peace. To eat out of season seizes upon the workings of Nature—this is the Great Dao. Hence it is said: 'Eat in season, and the hundred bones will be in order.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked: *\"When the Original *Qi* flows through the hundred passes, how should one employ it?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"The *qi* of Heaven is soft and yielding, penetrating sinews and bones, nourishing the spirit and calming the essence—all to make the joints flow freely. Who does not know that regulating *qi* is the foundation of humanity? The foundation of humanity is the *qi* of Heaven! Thus the common folk use it daily without knowing. The rising and falling of *qi*, the ebb and flow of yin and yang, all have their times. Receiving a single breath of *qi* nourishes all things, as the *lingzhi* mushroom thrives in winter without dying. So too, when a person attains the Dao, they do not die—this is when the Original *Qi* flows through the hundred passes.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Stirring the mechanism, all transformations are at peace.

Hence the mechanism—it opens the Heavenly Pass, and the Jade Gate closes of its own accord. When fire ignites the Heavenly Pass, it refines the marrow into pure yang, and fire follows, long refined into elixir—thus it is called the mechanism. All transformations—when *qi* condenses into spirit, returning to the Golden Pass at dawn—naturally settle the spirit, preserving the body for long life without death. The mechanism is subtlety. When a person moves the mechanism, their body transforms endlessly, inner and outer in harmony, the Dao of spirit united. Hence it is said: 'Stirring the mechanism, all transformations are at peace.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"People know their spirit when it manifests, but not how it manifests when unseen. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"People observe external omens of good and ill fortune and pray earnestly for their fulfillment, unaware that within their own bodies lies the spirit—capable of communicating with Heaven and Earth, of inner cultivation to attain the Dao, of manifesting the divine yang-spirit’s sacred communion. Why seek it externally? Essence begets *qi*; essence is the mother of *qi*, and spirit is the child of *qi*—these are the Three Treasures. Refined into the True Person, they are called Immortals. Hence it is said: 'This is how the spirit manifests.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The sun and moon have their cycles, great and small have their measures. From this, the sage’s work arises, and the divine light emerges. What is the mechanism of this Dao?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Man replied: *\"The sun and moon are the essence of yin and yang. Thus they move and fulfill their numbers, traversing the world, combining cold and heat. Sixty days complete one cycle; four cycles complete a full measure, fulfilling the intent of Heaven and Earth. Fixed in the sun and moon, they circulate within the Dao—hence 'entering and exiting sun and moon, abiding within the numbers.' The numbers are One; One is *qi*; *qi* condenses into spirit, and the divine light emerges. The divine light is yang-essence—nothing escapes its discernment, nothing evades its illumination. Thus the sage probes the union of sun and moon, and the divine light emerges, knowing the workings of Heaven and Earth’s creation, seizing the mechanisms of yin and yang’s transformations, and thus generating the spirit. Entering the hidden and emerging from the obscure, the numbers coalesce into One to form the person. The Dao is non-action. The mechanism is the heart’s intent. Skilled in unleashing the transformations of yin and yang, entering the boundless numbers—this is the rectitude of the Dao’s non-action. The mechanism is release. The sage seizes this mechanism: nine yangs and six yins, unified into One—thus the sun and moon have their cycles, great and small their measures.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"None under Heaven can know it, none can see it. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"For those of the world who are greedy, covetous, and given to licentious indulgence, they do not know the Dao of Heaven and lose their mechanism, dissipate their essence, and scatter their spirit. None can know it because the Dao’s mechanism is profound, and yin and yang remain unseen. Not recognizing the workings of Nature—this is why they do not know. They lose their spirit, scatter their blood and *qi*—how could they know? Those who would know must still the heart, cultivate the nature, steady the *qi*, and preserve the spirit—then clarity arises of its own accord. This is the Dao; this is seeing the spirit. Hence it is said: 'None under Heaven can know it, none can see it.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The noble attains it and endures hardship; the petty know it and slight their lives.

The sage attains knowledge, steadies their *qi*, and does not lose their essence. When essence and *qi* unite, they form the Great Medicine—all through knowing the workings of Nature, refining the spirit without scattering, steadying the *qi* and harmonizing the spirit. The petty do not know the root of life and spirit and thus cannot preserve them, losing their body and life. Not guarding their spirit but indulging the world, they lose their spirit and slight their lives, failing to preserve themselves—thus they die. The noble practices it diligently and endures hardship; the petty slight their lives, always dissipating their spirit and losing their bodies. Hence it is said: 'The noble attains it and endures hardship, while the petty slight their lives.'\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor said: *\"The Dao/Way is such that the one who attains it remains in poverty, while the petty slight their lives.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Those who perceive the Dao/Way’s workings within, do not see its external manifestations; those who hear the Dao/Way’s resonance within, do not hear its external sounds. These two—perception and hearing—are in harmony with the Dao/Way. Thus it is said: 'The blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.'*\n\nFrom the *Yinfu Jing* of the Three Sovereigns, the *Jade Precepts* (卷中竟).\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Cut off one source of profit, and you employ the Master tenfold. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Cut off fame and abandon profit, and the primordial *qi* naturally preserves itself. Abandon cleverness and discard wisdom, and thieves and robbers will have no sway. Cut off attachment to sounds and colors, and further employ the primordial *qi*. Embrace the One and guard the center, and you surpass the noble tenfold. The Supreme Dao/Way employs the Great Dao/Way, reaching perfection in the world and becoming Sage. The Master conceals fire within the central source; long practice renders it motionless, and when it moves, it naturally aligns with the Great Dao/Way. Using wisdom and cleverness, one departs from desire, thereby employing the Master tenfold. Thus it is said: 'Cut off one source of profit, and you employ the Master tenfold.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Threefold return of day and night, and you employ the Master ten-thousandfold. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Threefold return refers to the Three Primordials. The Heavenly Primordial *qi* resides above, the Spirit Source Primordial *qi* in the center, and the Root Source Primordial *qi* below. Thus, *jingqi* (精气) is the Master; the heart is the sovereign; the body is the furnace. Employing *jingqi* day and night, encountering the Three Primordials, boundless above and below, you employ it with tenfold efficacy. The spirit’s primordial *qi* does not scatter, the form does not decay, and thus it harmonizes with day and night. By day, the sun’s *qi* is employed and the yang is illuminated; the night’s *qi* is drawn inward, and the yin *qi* is expended outward. The yang *qi* is the root of the spirit; the yin *qi* is the ruin of the form. If one can let the spirit’s primordial *qi* meet the ancestral *qi* of the Three Primordials, blending above and below into unity, like the Master commanding the ten-thousand spirits to transform together, their spirits never cease, the yin shadows all vanish, and the Three Yangs reside alone within—after long practice, the spirit returns to its original state, hence deathlessness. Thus it is said: 'Threefold return of day and night, and you employ the Master ten-thousandfold.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The heart is born of things, yet dies by things. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Using the heart means letting the mind move. When the mind moves, the spirit shifts, and when the spirit shifts, the *qi* scatters—when the *qi* scatters, life departs, hence death. A steady heart means a settled spirit. The Master regulates the heart, aligning it with the One source of *qi*, harmonizing its internal workings, and letting all transformations flow through. A disordered heart means all spirits are lost; thus, abandoning emotions and desires, the ten-thousand spirits will not be lost to things. Hence it is said: 'The heart is born of things, yet dies by things.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"The mechanism lies in the eyes. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"The Dao/Way’s distant aspect lies beyond the Eight Transformations, its near aspect between the brows and eyelashes. It encompasses the vastness of heaven and earth, yet penetrates the fine threads of an eyebrow. When the spirit’s mechanism moves within, the eyelashes stir like lead—thus the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eyes, for there is a divine chamber between them. The internal workings of this mechanism manifest in the eyes. When extraordinary visions align with the Dao/Way, yin evils naturally perish, the true realm returns to purity, and the yang spirit is seen in the heavenly Dao/Way. Thus it is said: 'The mechanism lies in the eyes.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Heaven’s greatest lack of favor, yet great favor is born. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Heaven’s Dao/Way transforms the lower realm, and all things naturally arise—this is the birth of great favor. One must not indulge the heart with color and desire, lest it be disordered by false favors and thus bring death. Calm the heart to preserve the spirit, and it will flow naturally—does one not know that crows are not dyed yet black, cranes do not bathe yet white, spiders need no teaching to weave their webs, and swallows come without being summoned? Thus, great favor is born naturally. Hence it is said: 'Heaven’s greatest lack of favor, yet great favor is born.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Swift as lightning, fierce as wind—none fail to comply. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Swift as thunder and fierce as wind are the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang. If a person can nourish the wind’s *qi*, employing the *qi* of yin and yang, the primordial *jingqi* above and below, they will comply naturally. When the Dao/Way is practiced and the body moves, the yin and yang spirits internally blend, the true essence ascends and enters the brain, then descends swiftly as wind and thunder. The Three Primordials are fully manifested, and the hundred bones glow with fire—refining the yin and returning to pure yang, hence the Sage swiftly completes the Dao/Way. Internally cultivating the true body, its marvels unfold—like the rare grasses that receive the harmonious *qi* of yin and yang, hence they do not die, and none fail to comply. Thus it is said: 'Swift as lightning, fierce as wind—none fail to comply.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Greatest joy leaves a residue, greatest stillness brings purity. Why so?\"*\n\nThe Heavenly True Person replied: *\"Greatest joy in the spirit is the root of yin and yang. 'Greatest' means settled—settled in heart and mind, and yin and yang naturally harmonize. Greatest stillness brings purity. The eyes do not gaze upon colors, the spirit does not shift, the *qi* is preserved naturally—this is the greatest joy of Heavenly Truth. Abandon desire, still the heart, settle the mind, guard the spirit, and embrace the One in greatest stillness, entering the New to replace the Old—thus attaining the Dao/Way. The Sage aligns nature and life with Heaven’s Dao/Way; firm resolve brings purity. Hence it is said: 'Greatest joy leaves a residue, greatest stillness brings purity.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *\"Heaven’s utmost selfishness, yet its use is most public. Why so?\"*\n\nMaster Guangcheng replied: *\"Heaven is the clear yang *qi*—its utmost selfishness is the hidden emergence, giving birth to all things. The person within it, when restored to purity, attains the Dao/Way. If one can gather and preserve the primordial *qi*, nourishing Heaven’s Truth, and further master its functions to perfect the Dao/Way, this is called utmost publicness. The primordial *jingqi* solidifies the body—those who know depend on the times to employ it: ascending into the *nirvana* (泥丸), descending into the *sea of origins* (海源), meeting in the *Central Palace* (中宫), to receive the primordial *qi*, pass the *Primordial Pass* (元关), and approach the *Golden Gate* (金阙). The Three Fields (三田) mutually irrigate, and the hundred joints all harmonize—fire blazes throughout the body. Refined long and thoroughly, one attains the Dao of the Immortal. Thus it is said: 'Heaven’s utmost selfishness, yet its use is most public.'\"",

The blind, not seeing the light of sun and moon, discern the interplay of yin and yang, and through long practice attain longevity. The deaf, not hearing thunder, discern the passage of sun and moon, and through long practice attain enduring vision.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor said: *\"The bird is governed by qi. Why so?*\nThe True Man of Heaven replied: *The bird is the crow—crow is the heart’s qi. Thus it soars and descends at its appointed times. Qi is the manifestation of the void; when a person gathers it, prolonged refinement yields the Dao of the Immortal. The bird is the fire of the South; when a person attains its Way, the True Qi endures like a bird flying through the void. If one can seize and gather it within the Central Primordial, refining it into True Yang, then one attains the Dao of the Flying Immortal. Hence it is said: 'The bird is governed by qi.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Why so?*\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied: *Those skilled in life perish by fate. If one steadies the heart and eliminates the Six Desires and Seven Emotions, the spirit settles and the Dao arises. If the heart generates desires and emotions, the spirit scatters and fate is lost—the root of death. When the heart dies, eternal rebirth is attained—this is the root of life and death.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *Kindness arises from harm; harm arises from kindness. Why so?*\nThe True Man of Heaven replied: *The Sage’s kindness arises from the Dao; the commoner’s kindness arises from emotion, destroying the body and harming fate. To take from the surplus and supplement the deficient—those with surplus are those whose hearts harbor desires, while the deficient are those whose spirit scatters. When the heart indulges in desire and lust, kindness breeds harm and the spirit perishes. If one can clear the heart without weariness, the spirit naturally illuminates—this is harm yielding kindness. With steadfast resolve and unperturbed cultivation, harm is forgotten, and the spirit is preserved. Thus the Dao harmonizes and delights the heart, extinguishing joy and preserving the spirit, abandoning emotion and desire—this is the Sage. Hence it is said: 'Kindness arises from harm; harm arises from kindness.'*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: *The foolish man takes Heaven and Earth’s patterns as the Sage’s virtue; I take the timing of things as the philosopher’s wisdom. Why so?*\nBroad-Nurturing Child replied: *The commoner knows only of Heaven and Earth’s patterns, speaking of the Sage’s outward form while unaware that I possess the yin-yang of Heaven and Earth within. Yin and yang are the unfathomable laws of ghosts and gods, the vast and subtle principles through which Heaven and Earth communicate. The foolish man’s works are ignorant; he does not know that I, along with Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang and the timing of things, are all the same. The principles of Heaven and Earth are the Sage’s mechanism. The utmost Dao is the origin of all things, the essence of yin and yang—thus its transformations are boundless. When the Dao reaches its utmost refinement, it is mine. The Dao’s spontaneity gives rise to all things; I am the philosopher. Yin and yang cannot overcome me, for I am the same and thus victorious. Victory is my spirit; the spirit is the source of the utmost Dao. Hence I am divine, and my yin-yang aligns with the Sage. Heaven and Earth—two *qi* conjoin, and all things are the same. My spirit transcends time, and I am Sage to the Great Dao. I comprehend the Great Dao encompassing Heaven and Earth; wisdom is now complete. The essence of True Reality—naturally, I am transformed into the Three Pure Ones.*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice in reverence, thanking the Holy Sovereign for enlightening his ignorance. The Sage then ascended to the sky upon a clouded crane, and the Yellow Emperor returned to his capital in his carriage.\n\n*The Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts of the Yin Symbol Classic, Lower Scroll, ends.*",
