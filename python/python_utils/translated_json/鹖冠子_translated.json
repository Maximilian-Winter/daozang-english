The *Bó Xuǎn* chapter’s doctrine of fourfold verification and fivefold attainment is correct—if such a person encountered the right time, grasped the Dao, and applied it to governance, what great virtue and achievement would not follow?\n\nIn the *Xué Wèn* chapter, it speaks of how the lowly arise from uselessness, how one loses their vessel in midstream, and how a single jar may hold a thousand gold coins—I have read these words three times and felt sorrow for them.\n\nThe text contains thirty-five errors: three *yǐ* (transpositions), twenty-two *zāng* (omissions), and twelve *zhù* (corruptions). I have corrected them.\n\nLüzi said:\nHouguanzi was a man of Chu, dwelling in Tànshān, wearing a crown of *guàn* (hoopoe) feathers, hence his name. His teachings are inconsistent—beginning with *Huang-Lao* but later veering toward *Xíngmíng*.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: Shen Buhai and Han Fei refined *name* and *reality*, cutting to the core of affairs. Though their methods were harsh and lacked benevolence, they still drew from the intent of *Dao* and *De*. This is how learning can go astray.\n\nThus, after Confucius and Mozi, the *Rú* (Confucian) school split into eight, and the *Mò* (Mohist) into three. Alas, must one not be cautious?\n\nThough this book blends *Huang-Lao* and *Xíngmíng*, its core—like scattered fragments without a home—still occasionally reveals profound and subtle truths. From *Bó Xuǎn* to *Wǔ Líng Wáng Wèn*, there are nineteen chapters in total. Yet Han Yu, upon reading, claimed there were sixteen—this was not the complete work.\n\nThough the book now exists in full, its text is riddled with errors, many beyond recovery. The saying goes: *\"A book copied three times becomes a fish, a tiger, or the Emperor of Lu—is this not true?\"* I lament this, so I have clarified what can be known and marked the rest as doubtful, awaiting scholars of broad learning.\n\n---\n**Houguanzi (Volume One)**\n*Annotated by Lü Diàn*\n\n**Houguanzi (Volume One)**\n*Annotated by Lü Diàn*\n\n**Chapter One: On the Selection of Talent**\n\n*\"The first principle of broad selection\"*—King Fú#1 is not a tool for a single generation; he embodies **virtue/power** and eminent talent. King Fú#1 refers to the **Dao/Way** of governance. Master Jià#2 said: *\"Authority and legal ordinances—these are the ruler’s axe and adze.\"* If one relies solely on legal ordinances without tempering them with **virtue/power**, yet still hopes to endure, how difficult will that be!\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is measured in four ways: first, by Heaven; second, by Earth; third, by humanity; fourth, by **commanding fate**. **Commanding fate** is what gives rise to it. Human **authority** has five degrees of response:\n1. **Bóji**—those who are a hundred times better than oneself.\n2. **Shíji**—those who are ten times better than oneself.\n3. **Ruòji**—those equal to oneself.\n4. **Sīyì**—those who serve as laborers for one.\n5. **Túlì**—those who are mere commoners, even lower.\n\nWhat is called Heaven is the **Dao/Way** of natural principles and human emotions. The **Dao/Way** does not dwell in one place; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Heaven, and thus it is as it is. What is called Earth is the **Dao/Way** of constant and unchanging affairs. The **Dao/Way** does not settle in one state; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Earth, and thus it is as it is.\n\nWhat is called the **Dao/Way** of humanity is the aversion to death and love for life. What is called **commanding fate** is that none dare disobey. To say none dare disobey is to speak of **commanding fate**. The ruler is one who embodies clarity and **spiritual luminosity**. He governs without action yet commands reverence. **Spiritual luminosity** is to take humanity as the foundation. Following humanity brings ease, relying on oneself brings toil.\n\nHumanity is to take the **virtue/power** of sages and worthies as the foundation. The **virtue/power** of sages and worthies is to take broad selection as the foundation. Shùn emerged from the fields, Fù#4 was raised from the laborers’ walls, Jiēgé from the fish and salt markets, Guān Yíwú from the ranks of scholars, Sūn Shū’áo from the seaside, Bǎilǐ Xī from the marketplace—thus, the path of selecting talent cannot be too narrow!\n\nBroad selection is to take the five degrees of response as the foundation. Therefore, when one faces them respectfully and serves them, the **Bóji** will come. To face them respectfully and serve them is called *receiving* them. To hasten forward and then rest, to question first and then remain silent, the **Shíji** will come. To go before others and rest after them, to question before them and remain silent after them—though this also means lowering oneself—it differs from *receiving* them. Hence, the **Bóji** depart, while the **Shíji** arrive.\n\nWhen others hasten and oneself hastens, the **Ruòji** will come. To hasten with others and rest with others is like flying in formation with them. Leaning on a table, propping on a staff, and issuing commands with gestures—then the **Sīyì** will come. To sit and lean on a table, to stand and prop on a staff, and to issue commands with gestures is still a matter of propriety. To delight in exclamations and despise sharp orders—then the **Túlì** will arrive.\n\nHumanity is the foundation of all things—*the people are the people*. To delight in exclamations, to despise sharp orders—this is utterly lacking in propriety. If not for shameless men, who would willingly endure this?\n\nThus, the sage ruler dwells with his teachers, the king with his friends, and the fallen lord with his retainers. Therefore, one with **virtue/power** over a hundred is called *juàn*#9, and one with **virtue/power** over a thousand is called *háo*#10—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of joyful harmony. One with **virtue/power** over ten thousand is called *yīng*#11—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of the outstanding in grass. The *Máo Shī Zhuan* says: *\"One ten thousand is called ‘yīng’.\"* The *Records* say: *\"Five is called ‘mào’#12, ten is called ‘xuǎn’#13, a hundred is called ‘shǐ’#14, a thousand is called ‘yīng’.\"* Now, this text also says that ten thousand is called *shǐ*#14 and a hundred is called *yīng*#11—this is yet more difficult to reconcile.\n\nThe *Lǐwén Zhì*#15 says: *\"The most distinctive of beasts is the ‘xióng’#16, the most outstanding of plants is the ‘yīng’#17.\"* Hàn Xīn is the *xióng*#16, Zhāng Liáng is the *yīng*#17—this is apt.\n\n**Virtue/power** in speech is what is called *shēng*#18—yet no speech has ever been heard where the echo surpassed the voice. The noble have wisdom, the wealthy have resources, the poor have their bodies. Without wisdom, one is lowly; without resources, one is poor. What they possess are merely the unique forms bestowed by Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo encompass all the limbs is called the *body*; to see all the features is called the *form*. If trust and oaths do not align, undertakings will not succeed. If one does not die or live, and does not make decisive judgments, how can one ever reach a conclusion? To always occupy the ground of indecision—how can this suffice to make a judgment?\n\nTo reward based on merit and to weigh **virtue/power** with authority—here lies King Fú#1. Who can wield it?\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Rarity of the Sage**—The **Dao/Way** is measured...\n\nWith the **Dao/Way** as the core,\n**Virtue/power** has its foundation.\n**Virtue/power** serves as the standard.\n\nWhen the sovereign does not heed the essentials,\nthe upright becomes routine,\nand the **Dao/Way** of Yao#12 is lost—\nyet the shift from non-being to being is already evident.\nThe **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** are housed within,\nyet their command remains unfulfilled.\nRighteousness should be met,\nyet there is no correction.\n\nThe troubles of **Sui#15** and **Sha#16** are of this kind.\n*Format* means to rectify.\n\nBecause the sovereign does not heed the essentials,\nthen how can he be ignorant of his duties?\n\nTo abandon the meal and let it cool,\nthen ask for teeth—\nthis is no better than doing nothing.\nIf left as is, though it may seem secure,\nit is not truly settled.\nTo speak of fortunate security—\none who embraces fire and rests it upon piled kindling,\nthen sleeps above it—\nthough it may not yet ignite,\nit will surely burn in the end.\n\nThe upright rely on their station,\nyet their titles remain unfulfilled.\nTheir deviation from the **Dao/Way** is profound;\nwhat remains is but the name alone.\n\nThus, those who seek the people must not betray their nature,\nand those who seek the world must not misalign with their guests.\nIn such times, those who bow to conform to customs\nand look upward to flatter the times will surely arrive.\n\nIn the wilds of ritual and propriety,\nthey align with beasts—\nthough lambs and geese may have kneeling, suckling, and orderly processions,\nwhen subjected to human norms, their wildness is abundant.\nHow much more so for those without such natures—\nhow can they be compared?\n\nTheir speech is as violent as that of barbarians.\nBarbarians are those with twisted tongues.\n\nThe noble are easy to approach but difficult to familiarize,\nthey fear calamity and are difficult to provoke.\nThey die for righteousness—\nthus, they are difficult to provoke.\nThey crave profit but do not act unjustly—\nonly then do they take.\nThey act only when moved,\nand only take when necessary.\nThough their bodies may be at ease,\nthey dare not dwell there—\nonly then does propriety arise.\nThe noble restrain themselves and return to propriety—\nthis is how they fulfill it.\n\nThough their hearts may desire,\nthey dare not fully trust—\nonly then does righteousness arise.\n*One variant reads:* \"stand.\"\n\nTrust is like entrusting—\nthe noble restrain themselves and embrace righteousness—\nthis is how they fulfill it.\n\nRighteousness restrains desire and governs,\npropriety counters nature and distinguishes—\nthus, the noble do not act on impulse.\n\nIn chaotic times,\nthey rely on crude understanding to devise plans—\nplans are subtle; how can crude intelligence grasp them?\nThey use mediocre tastes to discern the **Dao/Way**—\n*This refers to the perverse and deceptive.*\n\n「If one uses profit as the basis for *emotion/virtue*,\nunless they do not share in the same hatred of evil,\nthey cannot truly be close—\nbut if they share in the same hatred of evil,\nthey will come to despise one another.\nThe petty-minded are so hard to approach.\n\nWhen speaking of *ren* (仁),\nthey call it deceit;\nwhen speaking of *righteousness* (義),\nthey call it boasting.\nIf one speaks with an honest heart and straightforwardly,\nthey will not believe it.\nProfit blinds the mind—\none cannot reason with them like this.\n\nThus, the wise in chaotic times\ncut off all joy and have no way to communicate,\nare of different kind and have no means to convey their words,\nhow bitter it is!\nYet they are further harmed by it.\n\nWhen the wise conceal themselves in a chaotic world,\nabove, they follow the ruler’s will,\nbelow, they dare not speak truth directly.\nThe ruler may act in arrogance,\nthe people may refrain from speaking openly,\nso though their hearts may not be at ease,\nthey dare not fail to praise.\n*This echoes Yang Xiong’s* *Xian Xin* (《羡新》).\nThis is not something that can be done lightly and abandoned.\nIf one is like this yet cannot uphold *righteousness* (義) as a standard,\nit is because they have the *Dao/Way* (道).\n\nThe people of Lu said:\n*\"Liu Xia Hui was indeed worthy, but I am not—\nConfucius praised him.\"*\nYet if one lacks the *Dao/Way* (道),\nthey float like a boat in a murky world,\nfawn upon superiors in servile manner,\nand still wish to compare themselves to the worthy,\nhow confused they are!\n\nThough their undertakings may not be virtuous,\nthey dare not fail to exert their utmost strength—\nthis is what *Ru Fen* (《汝坟》) exhorts.\nThough not the *Dao/Way* (義) of *Yin Qi Lei* (《殷其雷》),\nit is what they must do given their circumstances.\n\nThough their actions may not align with propriety,\nthey dare not fail to comply.\nIf all that is within them is beyond another’s ability to change,\nthen even if they praise what others do not,\nexert strength where others do not,\nand comply where others do not—\nthis too is a way of adapting to the world.\n\nThus, observing the wise in chaotic times,\none may see them act in one way,\nyet their utmost caution is not truly caution—\n*caution* is better rendered as *conforming to circumstances*.\nWhat they do is merely to avoid harm,\nhow could they truly be in harmony?\n*This is the third chapter of* *Ye Xing* (《夜行》),\n*text* (文) *is the* *Dao/Way* (文),\n*earth* (地) *is* *principle* (理).」\n\n「The moon, *punishment* (刑) *is*. *Yin* (陰) uses it to carve and restrain.\nThe sun, *virtue/power* (德) *is*. *Yang* (陽) uses it to reveal and awaken.\n\nThe four seasons, *examination* (检) *are*. There are clear laws yet no debate.\nMeasurements and numbers, *regulation* (节) *are*. Indeed, the *principle* (理) of heaven and earth lies in their measurements and numbers.\n\n*Yin* and *Yang*, *qi* (氣) *are*. The Five *Phases* (五行), *actions* (業) *are*.\nThe Five *Phases* dwell in the earth and manifest form, hence called *actions*.\nThe Five *Officials* (五政), *Dao/Way* (道) *are*. The Five *Celestial Stems* (五辰), *Dao/Way* (道) *are*.\nThey reside in heaven and form *symbols* (象), hence called *Dao/Way*.\n\nThe Five *Notes* (五音), *harmony* (調) *are*.\nWhen *sound* (聲) forms *text* (文) and *variation* (變) forms *shape* (方), it is called *Note*, hence *harmony*.\nThe Five *Sounds* (五聲), *custom* (故) *are*.\nThe Five *Sounds* differ through usage; in *Qi* (齐) they are called *Qi* (齐言), in *Jin* (晋) they are called *Jin* (晋语), hence *custom*.\n\nThe Five *Flavors* (五味), *affairs* (事) *are*.\n*Rewards* and *punishments* (赏罚), *restraints* (约) *are*.\nRewards are used to restrain so that they may fulfill their duties,\npunishments are used to restrain so that they may avoid blame.\nThese all have *verification* (验).\n\nWhat has its *reason* (所以然者), when followed does not reveal its end,\nwhen met does not reveal its beginning—\nits *reason* (所以然者), *Dao/Way* (道) *is*.\nThe *Dao/Way* has no beginning nor end,\nyet to follow its manifestations is like trying to catch the wind;\nto oppose it, there is no beginning,\nto comply with it, there is no end.\nEven *Yan Zi* (颜子) was bewildered and could not grasp this,\nhow much more so the likes of *Zi Yu* (赐之流)?\n\nWhen achievements and affairs are accomplished,\nno one knows their *form* (状).\nWho truly knows them?\n\n*Plans* (图) cannot be fully conveyed,\n*names* (名) cannot be fully expressed.\nIf a skillful artisan cannot depict it,\nthen a clever speaker cannot describe it either.\n\nForcing an explanation, one might say:\n*Fen-hu* (茴乎) and *Mang-hu* (芒乎), within there is a *symbol* (象)?\n*Mang-hu* (芒乎) and *Zi-hu* (兹乎), within there is a *thing* (物)?\n*Mang* (芒) is like the *ancestral* (祖), the *poor* (贫) seem to lack it?\n\n*Officialdom* (官乎) and *obscurity* (冥乎), within there is *refinement* (精乎).\nTo *attain sincerity* (致信) and *investigate principle* (究情),\n\nthe *Dao/Way*, indeed has *principle* (情) and *sincerity* (信),\nnot like *emptiness* (断空).\nThough it lacks form, it is not without *principle* (理);\nits essence lies in *governance* (政) and must be investigated.\n\n*Returning* (复反) has no *appearance* (貌).\nIf *appearance* (貌) is already absent,\nhow much more so *form* (形)?\n*Ghosts* (鬼) cannot see what cannot be done by humans,\n*dew* (露) then lacks *spiritual potency* (神),\nhow could they suffice to establish achievements and affairs?\n\nThus, those who skillfully perform human *actions* (業) are subtle,\nmysterious—\neven *ghosts* (鬼) cannot peer into their secrets.\nHence, the *Sages* (圣人) value *Ye Xing* (夜行).\n\nHeaven, the fourth.\nThe *Sage Kings* (圣王者), have the *Dao/Way* of listening to the subtle\nand resolving doubts,\nable to *block out slander* (屏谗权实),\nto *oppose false speech* (逆淫辞),\nsuch as the followers of *Yang* (杨) and *Mo* (墨).\nThey sever *common talk* (绝流语),」\n\nThe followers of Guan and Cai must be dismissed.\nAbandon what is useless—\nthe skill of slaying dragons, the art of carving *zhu* (楮),\nthough praised as lofty and wondrous, are of no practical use.\n\nClose the gates of factions and cliques,\nthose who hoard wealth to curry favor, betraying the public for private gain—\nlet their schemes wither like stagnant water,\ntheir empty words fade like fleeting whispers.\nHow could such be tolerated?\n\nThe envious and the bold shall not gain prominence;\nlet them remain in obscurity.\nOnly the virtuous and the upright may stand before the throne,\nthus evil cannot deceive, and calamity cannot strike.\n\nHeaven and Earth abide by the boundless,\nguarding measure and limit without excess—\nthis is the meaning of *\"evil cannot deceive, calamity cannot strike.\"*\n\nThe sun does not deviate from its appointed hour;\nthe conjunction of sun and moon forms the *chen* (辰).\nThe moon occupies its listed station—\nspeaking of its sequence in the *chen*.\n\nWhen the name is invoked, the duty is fulfilled:\nif named *Ji* (箕), then perform the duties of *Ji*;\nif named *Dou* (斗), then perform the duties of *Dou*—\nand so on for the rest.\n\nThe stars remain steadfast in their domains,\neach confined to its proper territory.\nThe phases of *xian* (弦) and *wang* (望), *hui* (晦) and *suo* (朔),\ncycle endlessly, one following the other—\nsome texts read *\"selected\"* (选).\nThe earth’s fields yield harvests, completing *hui* and *suo*,\nwhile the moon wanes and waxes, forming *xian* and *wang*—\nrepeating in endless succession, like the turning of a millstone or the pull of a saw.\nHow could there ever be an end?\n\nThe year accumulates into decades—\na year yields one harvest of grain,\nwhile a decade spans two full cycles of abundance.\nIts use is solemn, not lax or careless—\n*manman* (缦缦) is the appearance of fading and extinction.\n\nThis is the celestial grasp by which Heaven rules over the *Dou* [Fight/Constellation]—\nor, as some texts read, *calculates* it.\nIt speaks of the *Dou* governing the four quarters,\nmoving through the four seasons, eternal without end,\nwhile Heaven’s Way, as previously stated, shifts its dominion accordingly.\n\nThe *San* [Three] intermingles to form its station—\nsome texts read *Wu* [Five], others *Five*.\nIt speaks of the *San* harmonizing with Heaven and Earth to establish its station within.\n\nThe Four *Qi* [Energies] govern as ministers,\ntheir laws following the four seasons.\n*Zhang* [Extending] precedes, *Ji* [Polar] follows—\n*Zhang*, the star of the Southern Quarter;\n*Ji*, the star of the Northern Quarter.\nSometimes *Zhang* is named, sometimes *Ji*—\nthey mutually embrace each other.\n\n*Jiao* [Horn] on the left, *Tie* [Iron] on the right—\nsome texts read *Yue* [Jade].\n*Jiao*, the star of the Eastern Quarter;\n*Tie*, the star of the Western Quarter.\nThe *San* strikes down *Yǔ* [Axe] and *Tie* [Iron].\nThe Nine Patterns follow their natural order,\nto inspect the officials of the realm—\ngreat and small, all accounted for.\nThis is to say: concise yet nothing is omitted.\n\nBefore, there is no grievance of *Tiao* [Condemnation],\nafter, no blame of ruined reputation and failed conduct—\nthus its authority reaches above and below, intersecting.\nSome texts read *Jiao* [Cross-examining].\nIts blessings spread in all four directions without obstruction.\nEastward it extends, westward it covers,\nnorthward it reaches—\nabundant and unstoppable, none can resist it.\n\nHeaven’s non-deviation lies in its adherence to *One*;\nthis is called *trending toward things without duality*.\nIf Heaven departs from *One*, it reverses to become *things*.\nWhat distinguishes Heaven from all things is its embrace of *One*.\n\n*The Zijié* [Character Explanation] says:\n*One* yet vast is Heaven;\n*Two* yet small is *Shì* [This].\nIt neither creates nor acts,\nharmonizing with Heaven and Earth in *virtue/power*,\nconstantly aiding the natural self-so of all things without daring to interfere—\nHeaven does not create, yet all things transform;\nEarth does not act, yet all things nurture.\n\nThe *Zhì* [Seal] and *Xìn* [Trust] are reliable,\nlike the moon responding to the sun—\nthe sun advances and retreats along the stars,\nthe moon lives and dies in response to the sun—\nthis is the utmost of trust.\nThis is how the Sage governs the world.\n\nKnowledge suffices to smooth what is correct,\nbrevity suffices to avoid calamity—\nthis is why a perilous state cannot be secured,\na ruined state cannot be restored.\n\nStrength suffices to repel enemies,\neloquence suffices to adorn deceit—\nthis is why corruption cannot be cured.\n\nThus, Heaven’s Way first values the *covered*—\nHeaven can only cover those who are covered;\nif they cut themselves off, even Heaven cannot act.\nEarth’s Way first values the *borne*—\nEarth can only bear those who are borne;\nif they abandon themselves, even Earth cannot act.\nHuman Way first values the *served*—\nas Gōuxià Jì said:\n*\"A son who does not heed his father’s command,\na younger brother who does not receive his elder’s teaching—\neven if you were to bind him with ropes,\nwhat could you do?\"*\n\n*Selling wine* [or, as some texts read, *borrowing*] first values the *fed*—\nthe wine-seller is an example.\nThis further illustrates Heaven’s valuing of the *covered*,\nEarth’s valuing of the *borne*,\nand humanity’s valuing of the *served*.\n\n*Dài* [Attending] to things—\nsome texts read *Lǐng* [Leading] or *Gù* [Observing]—\n*qi* [energies] at their proper times.\nThe Four Seasons each lead the *qi* of their quarter.\n\nLife and death are the law.\nFollowing the measure to decide—\nthis is Heaven’s *jié* [node].\nThings cannot be left entirely unrestrained,\nso the measure is consulted.\nNature and fate are the natural *jié*.\nThe land is ordered and guarded,\nthe people are divided and assigned—\nsome texts read *zhǐ* [stopped].\nThus, the Sage follows Heaven’s *jié*,\nconsulting the measure to decide,\nso the land each has its guardian,\nthe people each have their allotment.\n\nThe cold receive clothing,\nthe hungry receive food,\nthe wronged receive justice,\nthe weary receive rest—\nthis is what the Sage aspires to.\n\nTo cut cloth and know how to choose the artisan,\nto govern a state and know how to select its people—\nthis is indeed what all ages recognize.\n\nAs when weaving silk and teaching someone to cut it—\nthe result is inevitable.\n\nOnly through *same* can Heaven be seen—\nHeaven’s Way is *One* without *Two*,\nso when viewed from their sameness,\n*Yí* and *Mò* are of one family.\n\nOnly through *different* can humanity be seen—\nHuman Way is *Two* without *One*,\nso when viewed from their difference,\nthe liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue.\n\nOnly through *change* can time be seen—\nconstantly moving without pause.\n\n「To observe *change* is how one may perceive the **Dao/Way**—the **Gēngsāngzǐ** says: A **Yue** chicken cannot brood a **Hú** goose or a **Ru** cock, yet a **Ru** chicken can; when the **Zhào** traveler goes south to see **Lǎozǐ**, then the **Dao/Way’s** hierarchical distinctions are revealed.\n\nOnly when facing profit can one perceive **truthfulness/faith (xìn)**, only when facing wealth can one perceive **benevolence/ren (rén)**, only when facing danger can one perceive **courage (yǒng)**. Under severe frost and fierce winds, one may then distinguish the true nature of grasses and trees.\n\nOnly when encountering matters can one perceive **guardians and officials (wèishù zhī shì)**.\n\nThe **Nine Sovereigns (Jiǔ Huáng)**’s system, as the *Spring and Autumn Annals’ Commentary (Chūnqiū Wěi)* states: The **Human Sovereign (Rén Huáng)** had nine brothers who ruled the world together.\nAre the **Nine Sovereigns’** titles truly derived from this?\n\nThe **Sovereign (Zhǔ)** does not falsely confer **kingship (wáng)**, for their **virtue/power (dé)** is complete.\nThe **minister (Chén)** does not falsely receive **nobility (guì)**—the ranks and titles are awarded without omission.\n**High and low (Zūn bēi)** are defined by their **names and titles (mínghào)**.\nThis refers to the **humble** in **high** titles.\n\nFrom the **lords, officials, and commoners (jūn lì mín)**, each **lord, official, and commoner** governs their own.\nThose of lesser rank have no **state (guó)**, so they are sent to administer it.\n**Alternating favors and records (Lì chǒng lì lù)**, records here mean **literary and official distinctions (wénjiàn zhī mào)**.\nIt speaks of **cycling through bestowal and honor**, their splendor changing accordingly.\nThe *Mao’s Commentary on the Shijing (Máo Shī Zhuàn)* says: **To hold and record**—this is the meaning.\n\n**Harmonizing with Heaven and humanity (Yǔ tiān rén cān xiàng jiēlián)**, Heaven and humanity are **unified (yī guàn)** and cannot be separated.\nThe **tools of governance (gōumòi)** are incomplete because of this.\n\n**Hooks and chains (Gōu mòi)**—the **means of supervision and discipline (dūzé zhī wèi)**—are absent.\nIt means that **only through the Dao/Way’s transformative influence (hùadào)** without coercive measures can such harmony be achieved.\nThus it is said: **Burn them, probe them, carve them, bind them**, and **three-fourths of the horses will die**.\nThe **nature of horses (mǎ zhī xìng)** is inherently true, yet their **wisdom becomes deceitful and thievish (zhì dào guǐ qiè zhě)**, this is the fault of the **Master Horse Trainer (Bólé)**.\n\nThough so, the **Nine Sovereigns’** system is also **allegorical (yùyán)**—the **Supreme Sovereign (Tàishàng)** governs without laws, how could there be a system of conferring titles?\nThose who **grasp the principles (Qièlǐ zhī shì)**, **focus on their convergence (yào qí huì guī)** and **abandon their external forms (ér yí suǒ jì)**, is acceptable.\n\nThe **flaws of the lower realm (xià zhī suǒ wǔ)**,\n\nThe contradictions arise from obstruction—**dry** (gān) in speech.\n\nWhen the **Highest** can be obscured, this is where one strays from human sentiment and loses the **Heavenly Principle** (tiān jié).\n\nTo slacken is to exhaust, to press is to constrain—when opportunity arises, one counters with the **unexpected** (qí), this is human nature.\n\nTo **distress** (dá) the nature of things: slackness breeds negligence, haste breeds constraint.\n\nThus the ancient sages’ parable of **driving chickens** warns against **excessive urgency** (jí nà).\n\n**\"Question\"** (wèn) refers to **flags and gaps** (zhì xì).\n\nWhen the **bars are locked tight**, even with the most cunning schemes, how could one breach them?\n\nSince the **Heavenly Principle** has been discussed above, here we elaborate on human sentiment.\n\nTo **uphold the Eight Extremes** (bā jí) with **trust yet skepticism**—this is the **Heavenly Pattern** (tiān zhī zé).\n\nThe **Eight Extremes** are the utmost reaches of the eight directions. The **four corners** are the four angles.\n\n*The Huainanzi* says: Beyond the eight **gaps** (yán) lie the eight **strings** (xián), beyond the eight **knots** (jié) lie the eight extremes.\n\nThough the **Eight Extremes** exist, yet by **traces that do not reach**, they seem like **empty boasts**—thus it is said: *\"trust yet do not trust.\"*\n\nStill, observing from **suspended metaphor**, the eight directions—above and below—are **boundless**, yet also **not without bound**, and **not without extremity**, hence it is called the **Heavenly Pattern**.\n\n**\"Difference and error\"**—speaking of what cannot be reconciled.\n\nThe **Dao of Confucius and Mozi** both **observed** the **Sages Yao and Shun**, yet **condemned** the **tyrants Jie and Zhou**, yet ultimately could not be reconciled—this flaw stems from here.\n\n**Flatness not aligning with pitch**. Even if **level**, if it fails to meet the **standard pitch**, it is off.\n\nA **thousand-li misstep** originates from a **hair’s breadth error**; yet over **years of neglect**, the mistake lies in **fleeting moments**.\n\nThus the **Noble One** is cautious of the small.\n\nWhen the **moon is full**, yet dawn arrives—when the **moon is eclipsed**, the **pearls and clams** rise from the depths, the **water channels form shallows**.\n\nAbove and below are **both estranged**.\n\nIt is said that **like qi** adheres to **estrangement** without question—even though **beasts hide in deep pools**, their rise and fall mirror the moon’s waxing and waning, as if governed from above.\n\n*The Huainanzi* says: When the sun reaches its zenith, **deer and elk shed their antlers**; when the moon is eclipsed, **pearls and clams ascend**.\n\nBefore the command is given, their actions are known; before the order is issued, their movement is foreseen. The **Sovereign does not exert effort**, yet the people act with **spontaneous perfection**—this is the **standard of transformation**.\n\nIf ordered yet they do not go, if forbidden yet they do not stop, when **above and below are misaligned**, their **Dao cannot harmonize**.\n\nWhen the **Sovereign above** is **harsh** (xié) and the **people below** are **oppressed**, this is the **corruption of the masses**.\n\nWhen **Yin and Yang fail to interact**, their **principles cannot reach each other**.\n\nWhen **calculations are mismatched**, the people **do not respond to the Sovereign**.\n\nWithout **matching talismans and seals**, how could they ever align?\n\nTo **act without harm**, to **achieve without failure**, when **one leads and ten thousand respond**, like **the body following the mind—this is the standard of governance**.\n\nJust as **a single lever** (gāng) moves **all the spokes**, its **essence lies in unity**.\n\nJust as **a single pole** (gāng) lifts **all the beams**, its **essence lies in the pole itself**.\n\nThus the **Enlightened Sovereign** favors **unity**, using **one to lead ten thousand**.\n\nBecause it **binds the beams with silk** (jǐn) to the pole, it is called the **\"silk-pole\"** (jǐngāng).\n\n*The Erya* says: **\"Plain silk binds the pole.\"**\n\nYet **seeing without understanding** cannot **remove one’s ailments**.\n\nWhen **Wen and Wu** alternate in governance yet **fail to implement reality**, it is because **laws are issued yet not enforced**.\n\n**\"Urgent\"** (niè) refers to **capital punishment**.\n\nThis is when **laws are ineffective**, and **the petty dare to act corruptly without restraint**.\n\nThough **Qin relied on harsh scrutiny**, its **flaws were mere formalities**, yet it collapsed into **total ruin**, worse than having **no laws at all**, because it lacked **true compassion and urgency**.\n\nFrom this, it is seen: **Without inner sincerity and genuine urgency**, to **enforce everything through law** is to **verify authenticity**—yet this only **breeds deceit**. To **examine governance** is to **invite chaos**.\n\nTo **abandon this and cling to that**—how could it ever succeed?\n\n**Southward bound yet steering north**.\n\nTo **obscure the yellow** (míng) yet speak as if easy—**speech without action is difficult**.\n\nThus **fathers cannot command sons**, nor **Sovereigns command ministers**.\n\nEven in **ruler-subject, parent-child relationships**, this is so—**how much more for the lowly?**\n\nWe have already seen **how Heaven’s trust in things** operates.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao is without deceit**.\n\nWe have not yet seen **how humans trust in things**.\n\nUnable to **conform to speech**.\n\n**Discarding things and relying on force**—this is **Heaven’s way**.\n\nAll things are **exhausted**; it **relies solely on force**.\n\n**Discarding things and relying on force**—*\"discarding\"* may also be read as *\"damaging\"*.\n\nThus **none can govern without premature decline**.\n\nAlternatively: **\"Obtaining the first\"**—this is the **principle of the Dao**.\n\nBecause it **discards things and relies on force**, none can govern without **premature decline**.\n\nIts **Dao is as above**, thus none can govern without **all declining**.\n\n**\"Things\"**—because **the crooked can be straightened**, and **people can be directed**.\n\nIt is said: **If things are merely things**, there is **no end to this**—thus **Heaven’s unchangeability** is made clear.\n\n**Heaven’s Dao** **patterns things yet does not claim them**.\n\nThough **laws vary in kind**, when **measured against Heaven’s Dao**, how could they **ever suffice**?\n\n**Temporarily adapting to the world** is all—**this is far from self-assured**.\n\nFor those who merely serve as loyal ministers offering counsel, they are not to be relied upon.\nThis is because their influence extends only to the existence of laws.\nThus, laws are **artificial regulations**—**artificially imposed measures**.\nOfficials are established to fulfill the ruler’s needs.\nEach official guards their duties to fulfill the ruler’s needs.\nPromoting the virtuous is not done through official ranks,\nNor is it done by concealing the bright to elevate others.\nOnly when their merit is evident is it then recognized.\nExposing faults is not done in secret,\nNor is it done by concealing others’ errors—\nonly when their guilt is manifest is punishment then applied.\n\nThis is the **true value of law**.\nIf laws are ignored, even if rewards are lavished,\nthere will still be those who fail to respond.\nThose who bestow rewards seek to sharpen the dull instruments of the world,\nyet rewards cannot fully motivate,\npunishments cannot fully deter,\nand if laws are disregarded and not enforced,\nor if punishments fall on the innocent,\nthen it is like demanding results from unused grinding stones—\neven if jade and silk are offered in abundance,\nthere will still be those who fail to respond.\n\nWhen ruler and subjects are divided,\ndefenses arise, and mutual obstruction follows.\nIf measures are set to weigh things,\nthen both the scales and the weights are stolen;\nif measures are set to measure things,\nthen both the measuring tools and the goods are stolen.\nThus, governance falls into private hands and cannot be reclaimed,\nwhile officials wield power arbitrarily and cannot be restrained,\nrewards are given to the undeserving and cannot be revoked,\nlaws are abandoned and cannot be reinstated,\nand punishments are meted out unjustly and cannot be stopped—\nthis is because they are not shared with the people.\nIf governance is shared with the people,\nand ruler and subjects uphold the Dao in harmony,\nhow could it ever reach such a state?\n\nA leak in the roof is known by those below,\na leak in the boat is known by those above.\nTo make the people abandon self-interest and instead focus on the ruler’s intentions—\nthis is what proper teaching aspires to.\nEven the **Eight Extremes** cannot always be praised in time,\nthus they may be obstructed.\nWhat is called **\"unobstructed\"** is the **Four Openings and Six Directions**—\nhow could one doubt that the **Eight Extremes** cannot be praised in clarity?\nThis is like Tang’s inquiry at Ji.\n\nIn the past, those who governed with the Dao did not rely on their ears and eyes.\nThrough divine intuition—**the vague yet profound, the descending yet ascending**—\nthey questioned beyond the **Eight Extremes**,\nso that what was before their ears could not be heard,\nand what was beyond their walls could not be seen.\nThus, the sage’s governance relied on the Dao,\nnot on ears and eyes.\nThe ears govern hearing, the eyes govern sight—\na single leaf obscures the view, and the great mountain is unseen;\ntwo beans block the ears, and thunder is unheard.\nEven the smallest things can obstruct perception—\nhow can they be trusted?\n\nWhen the Dao is open, there is no obstruction—\nthis has never been heard of.\nThis proves the Dao’s reliability.\nWhen the Dao is open,\nclouds and mist cannot hinder vision,\nthunder cannot disrupt hearing—\neven if the ruler holds a gnat’s antenna before his eyes,\nhe sees it as vast as the slopes of Mount Song,\nand if he listens to the clash of shells,\nhe hears it as the tumult of the armies of Qi and Wei.\nWho could obstruct this?\n\nTo see what is abandoned without taking it—\nthis is not human nature.\nIt is said: **\"There is no such thing.\"**\n\nThis too has never been heard of—what more can be said?\n\nWhen trust in emotions and adherence to the Way are cultivated, it is not the work of Heaven’s punishment, nor does it defy the fate of humankind. To act against one’s nature is to fail in one’s duty. Without fear of Heaven’s calamities, human misfortunes, or perilous fate, yet still pursuing life as if it were a task—this is like an ant trying to wear a mountain as a crown. How could it bear such a burden?\n\nThose who seek success and gain are merely pursuing what they hope for. If success comes from Heaven, it is called fate; if not, it is called destiny—there is nothing else to rely on. This is the Way, not mere action. To act for the people is the essence of the Way. What the people are not yet at ease with, the Sage does not force upon them; what the people are not yet weary of, the Sage does not remove. Only when the people reach their limit does the Sage not intervene.\n\nHe who relies on others without taking responsibility himself—this is Heaven’s way. If the people truly reach their limit, how could the Sage overstep and take their place?\n\nThe Grand Tutor said: *\"Let the people cultivate the virtuous, and appoint leaders to guide them; let the people cultivate their abilities, and let others govern them.\"* This is how the Sage King transmits his teachings, preserving the institutions of governance.\n\nIf teaching is harsh, the people’s conduct becomes shallow. If discipline begins only after childhood, it is too late. Losing sight of the roots, they contend over the branches. Fish vanish from the rivers and lakes, yet they still quarrel in the muddy shallows.\n\nHumans have their place in their dwelling, dwellings have their place on the land, each with its own domain. The land has its place under Heaven, and the land is vast. Heaven has its place in time—like the early cold of Qin or the early heat of Chu. Time has its place in the numbers—like spring aligning with the Wood phase or autumn with the Metal phase. The numbers have their place in measurement—extending the many or shortening the few. Measurement has its place in unity.\n\nUnity is the origin of measurement and numbers, adapting to their divisions. It is like the moon illuminating all waters. Heaven, though high, has its lowly ears—this is why. Heaven’s body is vast, yet its ears are even lower, for its spirit pervades all things universally. Thus, the Sage King follows Heaven’s timing, and the people follow the land’s order. There is no idle skill, and effort yields much.\n\nThe Three Powers converge to make a king—this is drawn from here. Revering the ruler and humbling the subjects is not about favoring kin. Appointing the worthy and employing the capable is not about personal preference. It is about maintaining the old ways. Words should not abandon public justice for private favor.\n\nWater and fire do not mix—this is Heaven’s decree. Water and fire serve as metaphors for favor and justice. In ancient governance, when private favor was extreme, public justice could not be overridden; when public justice was extreme, private favor could not interfere. Like water and fire, they aid each other yet do not blend.\n\nStill, this is merely human conduct. As for Heaven’s Way, it lies beyond this realm. Hence, it is said:\n\nThe enlightened cannot illuminate what is already bright—this is why the blind man Li Zhu could not grasp it. The Way cannot be obtained.\n\nThe compass cannot encircle what is already complete—this is why strength cannot lift it. Though Heaven and Earth may subtly shift, their true essence remains. It is not like a boat in the night being carried away by currents—who could lift it?\n\nWhen wisdom arises from self-awareness, wisdom arises. To turn jade into a broken ring is to make governance slippery. Uncarved jade does not shatter—why would it become a broken ring? A ring is a half-circle.\n\n*The Rites* say: *\"Severing with a half-ring, then reuniting with a full ring.\"* Fields cannot flourish without adapting to the land’s shape. Rice thrives in lowlands, millet in uplands. Governance cannot transform the people without adapting to their customs. Excessive severity or leniency, inappropriate joy or anger—these four, when extreme, are not the Sage’s method. Though they differ, they all stray far from the Great Way. How could they claim the Sage’s seat?\n\n*The Liezi* says: *\"To hold onto them all is to be swayed by them.\"* The body, though restrained, still causes greater chaos, for form and influence do not govern each other. If form cannot restrain influence, and influence cannot restrain form, this is their ruin.\n\nVirtue and life are intertwined in existence and decay—this cannot be the standard. The bones of Yao and Shun have long decayed, yet they are still sung of today. Is it because their bodies endure? This is the law of the ten thousand ages.\n\nThose who govern the world have never separated themselves from Heaven or been without Heaven’s mandate while still benefiting the people. To benefit the people is to benefit the land. Heaven and humanity do not act independently—humanity without Heaven does not succeed, nor does Heaven without humanity. To deviate from Heaven and humanity is to fail in self-governance, let alone governing the world.\n\nThe Sage Kings’ great names were never established without the scholars’ contributions. It is Heaven that elevates them. Excess arises from above, punishment from below—this is how corrupt ages become commonplace.\n\nAh, how brief is life! This is the limit of fate. These are words of lament, saying that fate has reached its peak in the ruler. Now, with such a dire situation, how can it not be mourned?\n\nThe deeper the sorrow, the more restrained the words—this is the poet’s art.\n\n---\n*[Environmental shift: The text transitions to a new section, \"Environmental Flow\" (环流第五)]*\n\nThere is One and there is qi—\n\nThe One is the origin of the Primordial Qi.\n\nQi exists, and with it, *yi*—\n*Yi* is born from the undifferentiated Qi.\nWith *yi*, there are patterns—\nwhich can be mirrored.\nWith patterns, there are names—\nwhich can be spoken.\nWith names, there are forms;\nwith forms, there are affairs;\nwith affairs, there are regulations—\nthese eight aspects are complete,\nyet the undifferentiated remains unseparated—\nthis is what is called *Hun Dun*.\n\nRegulations take center and give rise to time;\ntime gives rise, now acting, now establishing.\nThe next stage is speech—\nto distinguish.\nWhen established, things are born.\n*Hun Dun* is now opened,\nand thus the Four Seasons move,\nand all things are born.\n\nHence, qi accumulates to form time,\nregulations accumulate to form periods,\nperiods accumulate to form deeds,\ndeeds accumulate to form gain and loss,\ngain and loss accumulate to form auspiciousness and inauspiciousness,\nall things accumulate to form victory and defeat—\nall originate from qi,\nand qi is what makes them manifest.\nThey are in accord with the Dao,\nand the Dao is what makes them accord.\nThey are constrained by affairs,\nand knowing the Dao while #26 then becomes chaotic.\nThey are aligned with time,\nand knowing affairs alone leads to error.\n\nWhen *li* is separated, it becomes mixed with names—\n*li* as in the *li* of \"detachment.\"\nIt is perfected in law.\nLaw that is here is called *near*,\nits transformation beyond is called *far*.\nNear and reaching completion is called *shen* (divine),\nclarity in the Dao is *shen*,\nand *shen* in things is clarity.\nFar and returning is called clarity.\nAs Laozi said:\n*\"The passing day is distant, distant returns.\"*\nClarity is here,\nits light illuminating or revealing there;\nits affairs form here,\nits deeds complete there.\n\nThe *Odes* say: *\"Hold the reins like a rope.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nTo make a rope, one gathers the threads here and weaves the pattern there.\nIt speaks of movement in the near and action in the far.\n\nConfucius said: *\"The one who composed this ode must have understood governance!*\nTo hold this law and govern the people—how could there not be transformation?\"\n\nThe sincere warning of *Ganxián* is profound.\nFrom this to that is law.\nThe one who generates law is *I* (the Sage).\nWithout *I*, there would be no law.\nThe one who fulfills law is *them* (the people).\nWithout *them*, there would be no use for law.\nThe one who generates law is the sun, ever present without surfeit.\nThe circulation of spirit-qi follows the sun’s renewal each day.\nTo generate and fulfill within oneself—this is the Sage.\n*I* and *them* are mysteriously one; the utmost of virtue.\n\nOnly the Sage exhausts the nature of the Dao,\nonly the Dao’s law.\nIf not truly the primal chaos, who could do this?\n\nPublic governance is illuminated.\nWhen the Dipper’s handle points east, all under heaven is spring.\nWhen it points south, all under heaven is summer.\nWhen it points west, all under heaven is autumn.\nWhen it points north, all under heaven is winter.\nThe Dipper’s handle moves above, and affairs are established below.\nWhen the Dipper points to one direction, all four quarters are harmonized.\nThis is the Dao’s application of law—\nthe ancient Sages governed the world without leaving their seats,\ntheir complexions like polished cinnabar, their skin like ice and snow—\nthis is the use of the Dao.\n\nYet the world’s withered ones take this as yellow,\nclaiming Yellow Emperor’s skin was smooth and instructive,\nwhile Yao and Shun were pale like dried meat—\nthis is Mozi’s doctrine.\n\nThus, the sun and moon are insufficient to speak of brightness,\nthe four seasons insufficient to speak of function.\nTheir brightness and function surpass the four seasons and the sun and moon.\nOne law is established to complete its work—\nthus all follow the Dao.\nThe people all use it.\nOne law is set, and all things come to belong to it.\nBecause it arises from One, all things cannot be divided.\nLaw is precious as speech.\nWithout trust, it cannot stand.\nSpeech is the root of all things.\n*Is* is what law holds close;\n*Non-is* is what law rejects.\n*Is* is close to law, hence strong;\n*Non-is* is distant from law, hence perishes.\nIf law does not conform to speech, it disrupts its root.\n\nThus, the one who generates law is *ming* (fate);\nthe one generated by law is also *ming*.\nAll is *ming*.\n*Ming* is natural.\nNone can make it so, nor can any prevent it—\nthis is called natural.\nWhat *ming* establishes, the virtuous do not necessarily gain,\nthe unworthy do not necessarily lose.\n*Ming* says:\nPengzu’s wisdom did not surpass Yao and Shun’s,\nyet he lived a hundred years;\nYan Yuan’s talent did not exceed the common man’s,\nyet he died at eighteen;\nConfucius’ virtue did not fall below the feudal lords’,\nyet he was困 in Chen and Cai;\nZhou’s cruelty did not fall below the Three Virtuous Ones’,\nyet he held the throne.\nThis is what is meant.\n\n*Ming* is the father who lifts one from the grasslands to the floating honors above.\nYet bowing and rising a hundred years—\nit is fleeting, like a dream.\nThis is *wen* (pattern), not reality.\nThus there is the *ming* of a day,\nthe *ming* of a year,\nthe *ming* of a season,\nthe *ming* of a lifetime.\nThe *ming* of a lifetime is never fully realized.\nThus *ming* is everywhere, everywhere applied, everywhere sufficient.\nIt is said: *\"There is no place without *ming*, no time without *ming*.\"*\nIf delayed in time yet obtained, it is *ming*.\nSince there is *ming* in time,\ntime is the movement of Heaven,\n*ming* is Heaven’s decree.\nThe *South华* says:\n*\"To avoid ruin for long is futile—one cannot escape *ming*;\nto seek passage for long is futile—one cannot find the time.\"*\nTo draw forth its resonance and align it with its name—\nif in accord with time, it is called *tiao* (harmony);\nif out of time, spirit and qi perish together—\nthis is called *kuai* (contrariness).\nThough the vessel’s interior is the same,\nif a homely man presents it, its ugliness is only increased.\nOnly the Sage can regulate time and *ming*.\nThe *South华* says:\n*\"To know when to seek passage and when ruin is fated,\nto face great peril without fear—this is the Sage’s courage.\"*\n\nThough the ancient kings’ Dao was complete,\nyet the world has troubled rulers—\ntheir loss lies in this.\nRites, propriety, law, and measures adapt to the times;\ntime and *ming* do not cease, and law follows accordingly.\nYet the ignorant cling to the past like a girded pillar or a carved boat,\nguarding the ancient kings’ remnants—\nthough their Dao is complete,\nthey only deepen their困 and ruin.\nThis is like resting on a dog of straw outside the gate\nand then encountering a nightmare—\nhow could it be easy to endure?\n\nThus the so-called Dao is without *ji* (self) and without *ji* (self again);\nit is only to follow.\nThe so-called *de* is the ability to obtain others—\nyet it does not lose oneself.\nThe law of Dao and *de* is what all things take as their work,\nthe so-called resource without depletion.\nFormless yet apportioned—\nits name is *Da* (Great Thickness).\nUnknown whose child it is.\nThus the Dao of east, west, south, and north\nstands uniformly in its divisions.\nThe *South华* says:\n*\"To know the opposition of east and west yet not reject them—\nthen the apportionment of function is fixed.\"*\n\nYin and yang differ in qi,\nyet their harmony is the same.\nSour and bitter, sweet and bitter tastes oppose,\nyet their goodness is balanced.\nThe *South华* says:\n*\"The pear and the loquat, their flavors oppose,\nyet both are pleasing to the mouth.\nThe five colors differ in hue,\nyet their beauty is uniform.\nThe five tones differ in pitch,\nyet their joy is one.\"*\n\nThese five things illustrate the ancient kings’ Dao:\nnot proud of uniformity but proud of governance.\nThus no thing lacks its kind,\nno motion or stillness lacks qi.\nTherefore, if one person’s *jiang* (endeavor) succeeds,\none person’s qi is auspicious;\n\nThere is a household general—one who governs a household.\nIf he succeeds, the household’s qi is auspicious;\nthere is a national general—one who governs a nation.\nIf he succeeds, the nation’s qi is auspicious.\n\nThe ancients said: War is like gambling—\nabundant resources make one’s qi bold and victorious,\nscarce resources make one’s heart timid and lead to defeat.\nThus, the general’s fortune or misfortune rests in qi.\n\nThe *Art of War* says:\nMorning qi is sharp,\nnoon qi is slack,\nevening qi returns.\nA skilled commander avoids its sharpness and strikes when it is slack and returning.\n\nIf the general’s fortune is reversed,\nthen *same* is called *one*,\n*different* is called *Dao*,\n*mutual overcoming* is called *executing*,\n*fortune and misfortune* are called *success and failure*.\n\nThe virtuous—though ten thousand actions yield one failure—\nthe unworthy—though ten thousand actions yield one success—\nyet their aspirations are not the same.\nThus, what they do cannot be uniform.\nKnowing that *one* cannot be uniform,\ntherefore, *Dao* is prized.\n*Different* is called *Dao*.\n\n*Empty* is called *one* [or *same*],\n*empty* [or *same*] is called *one*.\nAll things have no lack.\nNo lack of completeness is called *Dao*.\nAll things have no excess.\n*Establishing* is called *qi*,\n*communicating* is called *kind*.\n\nQi that harms people is called *inappropriate*,\nflavor that harms people is called *poison*.\n\nThe *community altar*—originally *Heaven’s altar*,\nor *Heaven’s Du*—if not carved, then no mist forms.\n*Du* means *reaching*—\nthis speaks of a ruined kingdom’s altar not receiving Heaven’s sun,\nthus lacking mist.\nGreat altars are not housed but are platforms,\nto receive frost and dew’s qi,\nthen mist arises.\n\nProperly speaking, *altar* and *mist*—\n*altar* establishes *qi*’s meaning,\n*mist* communicates *kind*’s meaning.\nQi thus mutually benefits and harms.\nDuke Zhou’s *Tuning* says:\nYin and yang mutually illuminate,\nmutually shelter and regulate;\nthe four seasons mutually succeed,\nmutually generate and destroy.\n\nKinds thus mutually complete and ruin.\nSummer is spring’s kind;\nwinter is autumn’s kind.\nAll others follow this.\n\n*Accumulated past* generates *differences*—\ncraftsmen take them as models.\n*Differences* means *limping*—\nmodels are like shamans’ models.\nShamans walk with a limp,\nso accumulated past generates *differences*,\ncraftsmen take them as models.\n\nYangzi said:\nIn ancient times, the Sì clan governed water and land,\nand shamans imitated Yu’s gait;\nBiàn Que was from Lu,\nand physicians imitated Lu’s ways.\nAccumulated poison becomes medicine,\ncraftsmen take them as physicians.\nThis speaks of medicine’s origins arising,\nthen physicians emerge.\n\nGenerally, the world’s flaws arise from past precedents,\nso great thieves borrow righteousness to steal a nation,\npetty scholars use poetry and ritual to enrich their families.\nThus it is said:\nHow do we know that Zēng and Shǐ were not spies for Jiè and Yòu?\n\nGood and evil adorn each other—\nthis is called *reciprocal completeness*.\nThings pushed to extremes reverse—\nthis is called *cyclic flow*.\nSpeaking of its circulation like an unbroken ring.\n\n**Chapter Six: The Dao’s End**\n\nHeaven is what allows all things to stand.\nAll things depend on it to exist—this is Heaven.\nEarth is what allows all things to rest.\nHeaven is the Father of the Dao,\nEarth is the Mother of the Dao.\nThus Heaven ordains it,\nEarth arranges it,\nTime activates it,\nThings receive it,\nSages emulate it.\n\nThe changes of cold and warmth\nare not the work of a single essence alone;\nthe five essences transform into qi,\nthen cold and heat are formed.\n\nThe affairs of the world\nare not what one person can know alone;\nthe vast waters\nare not the flow of a single stream alone.\nYáo’s nine-year floods did not increase the waters,\nTáng’s seven-year droughts did not decrease them—\nwas it because he relied on a single stream’s measure?\n\nThus, the enlightened ruler’s governance\nurgently seeks people,\ndoes not act alone,\nbut shares with them.\nSharing with Heaven and Earth,\nalso sharing with Heaven and Earth.\n\nEstablishing the four supports—\n*ritual, righteousness, kindness, and shame*—\nthese are called the four supports,\nto assist national governance.\n\nHooks and lines spread out,\ncornerstones and plumb lines regulate,\nbalanced in their arrangements,\npositions then become firm.\n\nQi has its constants,\nordered by Heaven and Earth.\nActing contrary to seasonal times brings misfortune,\ndisasters arise,\naffairs fail without virtuous officials.\nExhaust its Dao externally,\nprobe its changes internally.\n\nDeploying armies to guard the borders,\ndisaster returns within—\nas when Ji Sūn’s worry was not in Zhuántú,\nbut within the inner walls.\n\nWhat is prepared is distant,\nthe enemy lies in what is cherished.\n\nThus, the ancient kings appointed officials—\nselecting the virtuous, employing the capable,\nwithout partiality toward the world.\nThe benevolent man stands at left,\nspring generates life—symbolizing benevolence.\nThe loyal minister stands before,\nthe south is visible—symbolizing loyalty.\nThe righteous minister stands at right,\nautumn completes—symbolizing righteousness.\nThe sage stands behind,\nthe north is secret—symbolizing sagacity.\n\nLeft follows benevolence, then spring generates;\nbefore follows loyalty, then summer’s achievements stand;\nright follows righteousness, then autumn’s harvest matures;\nbehind follows sagacity, then winter’s concealment is complete.\n\nThe ancient kings used them,\nelevated yet not fallen,\nsecure yet not ruined.\nThis is the root of all things,\nHeaven and Earth’s gateway.\n\nThe four great ministers—\nthe king’s external appointments.\nThe king is Heaven.\nLeft, right, before, and behind follow the four seasons,\nthus the king emulates Heaven.\n\nIf Heaven does not open its gateway,\nit allows harm below.\nWest does not follow righteousness,\nsouth does not follow loyalty,\nnorth does not follow sagacity,\nthen Heaven’s gateway is sealed.\n\nAdvancing the virtuous earns supreme reward,\nthen those below do not conceal the good.\n\nThe *Hall of Literature* quotes *The Crow’s Crown*:\n“Advancing the virtuous earns supreme reward,\nthen those below do not conceal the good.”\n\nFor those who govern, rewards are few yet the people rejoice,\npunishments are few yet the people stand in awe.\nThis is called advancing those already in office who are virtuous.\n\nThey do not wait for the meritorious deeds of those who serve well—\nthough they are not yet proven in service—\nto promote and reward them,\nthen those entrusted with affairs will be encouraged.\n\nThus the following text states:\n*\"Then those entrusted with affairs will not fail to give their utmost loyalty.\"*\n\n*The Profound Dew* says:\n\"One act of loyalty is loyalty itself;\na second act is called *xi* (cessation).\"\nThe common folk admire righteousness,\nthe states and kingdoms take delight in it—\nthis is clear.\n\nWhen governance is upright, even flies do not covet rotten meat,\nyet ants are drawn to rancid flesh.\nThus, though others may admire righteousness,\nour governance must itself be upright.\n\nWhen governance is upright,\nit means the ruler’s demeanor is correct,\nfacing south in reverence.\nThis is the Way’s fulfillment,\nvirtue’s completion.\n\nIts origin lies in One—\nthus it is called *Heaven*.\nThere is no second sovereign.\nAll receive their mandate,\nunable to be named—\nthus it is called *Spirit*.\nIt subtly permeates all things and is called *speech*.\n\nAt the utmost of Spirit,\nit is seen without force.\n*(One text reads: \"or.\")*\nThose who align with this Way—\nhow could they differ?\n\nThe *Xiongnu* rebels are undeterred,\nyet they strive to govern a single state.\nWhen calamities strike,\nthey are not dismayed—\nmerely examining the great principles of the world\nto rectify their own nation’s errors.\nWho says that Heaven’s changes belong to a certain event,\nor that my actions caused them?\n\nThe punishments of a single state\nare all embodied in the ruler’s person.\nPunishments begin with a minor wife,\nextending to brothers,\nto govern the family and state.\n\nThe ruler ages by governing the world,\nto save the world and then age.\nCorrecting with precision,\nembracing righteousness and practicing benevolence,\nto unify the king’s domain.\n\nBenevolence is the ruler’s essence;\nrighteousness, the ruler’s conduct;\nloyalty, the ruler’s governance;\ntruth, the ruler’s teaching;\nthe Sage, the ruler’s mentor and tradition.\n\nThe ruler’s Way lies in knowing people,\nthe minister’s art in knowing affairs.\nThus, when handling wealth and distributing resources, use benevolence;\nwhen facing danger or crisis, employ courage;\nwhen receiving words and articulating speech, rely on eloquence;\nwhen deliberating and deciding, depend on wisdom;\nwhen governing the people and maintaining equity, practice humility;\nwhen receiving guests and delivering edicts, uphold propriety.\n*(When receiving guests and delivering edicts, the term is *bīn zòu*;\nwhen assisting and presenting, the term is *zàn jiàn*.)*\n\n*The Records* say:\n\"Propriety has *bīn zòu* and *zhào*,\nmusic has *xiāng bù*—\nthis is the pinnacle of warmth.\"\n\nUsing the people to gain the masses requires virtue,\nsending envoys to distant lands requires trust,\ncommanding Heaven and Earth, controlling the feudal lords requires sagacity.\n\nThis, then, is the broad outline of the principle of appointment.\n\nLet us test this theory:\nThe ancient enlightened kings governed without action yet ruled the world—\nwas it merely to make them benevolent, courageous, eloquent, wise, humble, proper, virtuous, trustworthy, or sagacious?\nEven those left over from Heaven’s punishments and human executions\nwere not abandoned.\n\nThus, the crippled and lame were employed,\nthe blind and deaf were given tasks,\ndwarfs and the deformed were utilized,\nthe blind were made fire-keepers,\nthe one-eyed were set as overseers,\nthose with severed noses guarded gates,\nthose with amputated feet tended forests,\nand the maimed and infirm filled the frontier lands.\n\nThus, above there were no neglected duties,\nbelow there were no wasted talents.\nThis is how the Three Dynasties achieved enduring stability.\n\nYet still—\nto know whom to employ with benevolence but not recognize the scale of their benevolence,\nto know whom to employ with wisdom but not grasp the depth of their insight—\nthis is insufficient.\n\nThus it is said:\nMeng Gong Chuo could be a counselor for Zhao and Wei in their old age,\nbut he could not serve as a great minister for Teng and She;\nYan Yuan could rule as sovereign;\nChi Lu could converse with guests.\n\n「Qiu Ye could be the steward for a household of a hundred chariots,\nand You could govern a thousand-chariot state by managing its taxes.\n\nFrom this, one may observe that the teachings of this book\nare also based on the magnitude of the responsibilities entrusted.\n\n*The Zhuangzi* says:\n*\"When the assignment of duties is clear, then the examination of their origins and principles follows.\nOnly when duties are properly assigned can one examine their origins.\"*\n\nThus, it is said:\nThe **virtue/power** of the benevolent,\nis that they do good without striving for gain,\nand those below do not resent those above.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the eloquent,\nis that they resolve grievances and untangle disputes.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the wise,\nis that they address matters as they arise,\nand respond to difficulties with appropriate measures.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the loyal subject,\nis that they speak truthfully and act uprightly,\ncorrecting the ruler’s errors with firmness.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the righteous subject,\nis that they preserve the living and continue the extinct,\nand rescue the weak while punishing the violent.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the trustworthy subject,\nis that they affirm what is right without wavering in speech.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the upright and modest,\nis that they discard personal interests and uphold the public good.\n\n*The Han Feizi* says:\n*\"Self-promotion is the way of the petty,\nwhile abandoning private interests for the public is the way of the noble.\"*\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the ritualist,\nis that they honor the ruler’s carriage and attendants.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the worthy,\nis that enemy states fear them,\nand the four borders remain unbreached.\n\nThe **virtue/power** of the sage,\nis that they establish laws in the unseen,\nachieve what they seek and obtain what they desire,\nare obeyed without question,\ndraw near and distant alike,\nand their wisdom shines in all four directions.\nFrom this up to the unseen,\nthe responsibility of the sage is clear.\n\nWithin, they hold fast to their principles,\nusing them as a measure for verification—\nthis is what is meant by **\"Dao/Way\" as a guiding standard**.\n\nThen comes the ability to judge by a single root or principle,\nand to assess people with two words.\n\nWithout inner restraint,\none cannot discern the things they observe.\nA wealthy man’s generosity reveals his **virtue/power of benevolence**.\nA noble man’s promotions reveal his loyalty.\n\nObserve their **great conduct**—\nwhether they defer to the young or the old,\nwhether the noble defer to the lowly—\nthis reveals their sense of **ritual/propriety**.\n\nObserve what they refuse to do,\nand this reveals their **righteousness/principle**.\n\nObserve their acceptance of office and governance,\nand their decisions to leave or stay—\nthis reveals their **insight/wisdom**.\n\nObserve whether they are unyielding when pressed,\nand this reveals their **courage**.\n\nObserve whether their speech is sharp and their words skillful,\nand this reveals their **eloquence**.\n\nObserve whether they do not conceal when entrusted,\nand this reveals their **trustworthiness**.\n\nObserve what a poor man refuses to take,\nand this reveals their **cleanliness/integrity**.\nObserve what a lowly man refuses to do,\nand this reveals their **worthiness**.\n\nMeasure their depth and observe their Heavenly alignment,\nand this reveals their **sageliness**.\n\nThe essentials of assigning duties and examining origins\nlie in knowing people,\nand knowing people lies in having a way to observe them.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Observe the way they act,\nconsider the circumstances that lead them there,\nand examine where they find rest—\nhow could one fail to know them?\"*\n\nThus, this is further elaborated upon:\nThe ranks are never misaligned,\nand the principles do not contradict each other.\n\nNear and distant are harmonized,\nand the prepared are vigilant against change—\n*\"Prepared\"* is how they avoid being constrained,\n*\"Vigilant\"* is how they do not grow weary from adapting.\n\nThey understand their duties and act accordingly,\nmeasuring affairs with their own principles.\n\nA ruler without the **Dao/Way** employs the **petty and unworthy**—\nthe petty and unworthy are those of little virtue,\nwhose opposite is **noble and strong**—\nand their actions bring only confusion and disorder.\n\nA ruler with the **Dao/Way** employs the **noble and strong**,\nand their actions are clear and harmonious.\n\nThese two principles, once established,\nare like the **Mingqi**—\nthe **Mingtai** below, the **Mingqi** above.\n\n*\"Mingqi\"* refers to the **sacred vessel**,\nand *\"Mingtai\"* refers to the **spiritual platform**.\n*\"Sympathy\"* and *\"verification\"* are complementary.\n\nThe ruler aligns with their **virtue/power** above,\nand the subjects confirm its truth below.\n\nThe **ruler’s timing**—\nsome texts say *\"ruler’s intentions\"*—\nawaits the moment to act.\n\nWhen the **ruler’s timing** is clear,\nthey respond to the **Dao/Way** and issue commands.\n\nThe worthy in their domains,\nthough different in nature,\nshare a common understanding of **timing and circumstances**.\n\nThe **ruler’s timing**—\noriginally *\"timing and circumstances\"*—\nwhen encountering a person of **virtue/power**,\nthey do not need to speak to be trusted,\nand all the people naturally turn to them in kinship.\n\nWhen encountering a violent and arrogant person,\nthe people scatter and flee.\nAbove and below grow suspicious of each other,\nand their conflicts spiral like an unbroken ring,\nday and night without end.\n\nThose who offer counsel are not heeded,\nthose who speak are placed in danger,\nand there is no way to hear of mistakes—\nthus, great ministers feign loyalty but are not truly so.\n\nTherefore, a ruler who loves their people like a father\ndoes not need to summon them;\nthis is the effect of the **sacred platform**.\n\nThus, they shine with **light/clarity**,\nand their reputation ends in splendor.\n\nIf they punish without first instructing,\nor love while demanding closeness—\nsome texts say *\"love while seeking intimacy\"*—\nthen they invite **calamity**,\nand their end is in misfortune.\n\nWhen the worthy serve their ruler,\nthey adjust and harmonize—\nsome texts say *\"know and unite\"*—\ntheir **Dao/Way** is pure and steadfast,\nlike the **unyielding**—\nsome texts say *\"fortified\"*—\n**worthy subjects** who act with restraint.\n\nThey lead and transform them,\nand the world follows in approval.\nTheir **Dao/Way** grows ever more aligned,\nand thus their end is certain to flourish.\n\nWhen the petty serve their ruler,\nthey strive to obscure their ruler’s clarity,\nblock their hearing,\nexploit their authority,\nand make people cold or hot with their schemes—\nsome texts say *\"create discord\"*—\nrelying on the ruler’s power,\nthey manipulate others’ comfort.\n\nThe world despises them,\nand their rise is marked by ruin—\nsome texts say *\"their height is ominous\"*—\nthus their end is certain to fail,\nand their misfortune extends to their kin.\n\nThis is the transformation between ruler and subject,\nthe distinction between order and chaos,\nthe key to the rise and fall of states,\nand the critical juncture for a nation’s fate.\n\n*\"Critical juncture\"* can also mean *\"warning\"* or *\"checkpoint\"*.\nThe path of **reversal and compliance**, **benefit and harm**, arises from here.\n\nIn general, what can be done without study or learning,\nis only **breathing and eating**.\n\nThus, the ancient kings passed down the **Dao/Way**—\nsome texts say *\"broadened the Dao/Way\"*—\nthe ancient kings, or alternatively *\"the first teachers\"*,\n\nto emulate and inherit.\n\nWorthy rulers follow established laws,\nand their legacy endures for generations.\nUnworthy rulers do not comply,\nand their dynasty perishes in their own time.\n\nThe laws of **Yu** still exist,\nyet the **Xia** never became a perpetual dynasty—\nthis is why.\n\nNearly the same as *\"repeatedly\"*—\nsome texts say *\"seventh\"*—\n\nPang Zi asked the **Lu Guan Zi**:\n*\"What does the sage’s **Dao/Way** prioritize?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Prioritizing people.\"*\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"What does the **Dao/Way of people** prioritize?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Prioritizing arms.\"*\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"Why abandon Heaven and prioritize people?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Heaven is vast and difficult to know,\nits blessings cannot be requested,\nand its calamities cannot be avoided.\nTo model oneself after Heaven is to oppose the **Dao/Way**.\"*\n\nThe Earth is vast and profound,\nits benefits are many—*or, its use is broad*—yet its punishments are few,\nHeaven is exalted yet distant,\nEarth is near yet not unexalted.\nTo model oneself after Earth is to bring shame;\n\n**Time** arises, shifts, and changes without pause—\nto model oneself after **Time** is to falter.\nThese three cannot be relied upon to establish **Dao/Way** or shape customs,\nthus the sage does not follow them.\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"What of **Yin** and **Yang**?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Their **spiritual vitality** and luminous clarity align with Heaven,\ntheir **spiritual essence** is truly responsive.\n**Yin**’s latent stirrings act in concert with Earth,\n**Yang**’s daily arc **Yin** follows.\n**Yin** and **Yang**’s cold and heat, along with **Time**’s shifts,\nthese three: when the sage preserves them, order ensues;\nwhen they perish, chaos reigns—\nthus, he prioritizes people.\n\nWealth brings arrogance,\nhonor brings decay.\nWar is a tool not employed every hundred years,\nyet one cannot forget it for a single day—\nthis is why the **Dao/Way of people** prioritizes arms.\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"How does one prioritize arms?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Arms are the embodiment of **ritual propriety (礼)**, **rightness (义)**, **loyalty (忠)**, and **trustworthiness (信)**.\"*\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"I wish to hear the **Dao/Way of arms**.\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Without **Dao/Way**, one dares to defy the noble with the base;\nwithout **rightness (义)**, one dares to encroach upon the great with the small.\nWhen one acts unjustly, **shame and restraint (枉耻禁)** are enforced;\nwhen one returns to correctness, the punishment is abandoned—\nthus, one does not slay those who surrender.\nA hawk does not strike a fallen bird—how much more so with people?\nThe highest **Dao/Way** esteems **ritual propriety (礼)**,\nnothing is more noble than **restraint (约束)**.\nTo gain land yet lose **trustworthiness (信)**, even a **sage-king (圣王)** would not rely upon it;\nto double one’s words and break one’s **pledges (约)**, each will have their own reasons.\"*\n\nPang Zi said:\n*\"My disciples have heard that: ‘The larger the land, the stronger the state; the more numerous the people, the mightier the army; the mightier the army, the sooner one attains one’s ambitions in the world.’\nBut now, the armies of great states retreat in disgrace and their words are exhausted—**shame and restraint (枉耻禁)** fail to control them, and orders cannot be enforced. Why is this so?\nOrders command what should be done; prohibitions forbid what should not be done.\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"To know what will come, examine what has passed;\nto know the ancient, observe the present.\nThe ruler who **selects (择) people** and then **employs (用) them** will thrive; the ruler who **employs people** without first **selecting (择) them** will perish.\nWhen **rebellious conduct (逆节)** arises, the unworthy encroach upon the virtuous—**daily (日) oppressing (凌)** them;\nwhen **the low oppress (凌) the high**, it is called **victory (胜)**.\n**The high overpower (胜) the low**—this is the way of things.\nNow, the question you ask, my friend, **be cautious not to speak of it (子慎勿言)**.\n\nWhen a state’s land is vast and its people numerous, its army is strong—this is called **sufficiency (足)**.\nBut if its scholars have **excessive strength (余力)** yet cannot **attain their ambitions in the world (先得志於天下)**, then its ruler is **not virtuous (不贤)** and **acts with arrogance and constraint (骄缢)**.\nTo **be self-exalted (己亢)** is arrogance; to **be self-satisfied (己满)** is excess.\nIf a ruler is **not virtuous (不贤)**, he cannot **avoid action (无为)**, nor can he **be trusted to act together (与致为)** with others.\nMencius said: ‘There are things a man **will not do (不为)**, and only then can he **do what is proper (有为)**.’\nWhen one is arrogant, he **despises his enemy (轻敌)**;\nwhen he despises his enemy, he **plots with those he favors (所私谋)**, acting against what he does not know.\nHe **assigns tasks beyond their strength (非其任力)**, seeking **victory over those not his true enemy (非其敌)**,\nwithout considering the **long-term calamities (终身之患)** of his state,\nbut instead delighting in **temporary success (须臾之说)**.\nThus, the ruler **suffers slander from his subjects (被过听之谤)** and is **held in contempt by the world (丑於天下)**,\nwhile his ministers **bear false accusations (负滥监)**.\nThe **blame is directed at enemy states (首之责于敌国)**;\nwhen enemy states **lay the blame upon him (乃责则却)**, they **retreat or are plundered (却或作劫)**,\nusing **words to evade (以辞那之)**.\nIf they **retreat (却)**, the speaker is **shamed by his weakness (说者羞其弱)**;\nif they **evade with words (以辞却之)**, then the speaker **is shamed by his weakness (则说)**,\nwhile those who **lay the blame (责之者)** are **shamed by his weakness (羞其弱)**—\nthis **leads to the exhaustion of their strength (其势铃)** until they **must resort to arms (至於用兵)**.\nA thousand **base (万贱)** may not **straighten (挠)** one **noble (贵)** who **bows (曲)**;\nand those **below (在下者)** have **no means to counter (回)** them.\"\n\nThe state **suffers from grievances (被伸)**, or **is struck by divine punishment (作神创)**,\nas **wrongs grow ever larger (浸大日伸)**.\nWhen they **burst forth (其发)**, there is **war (则战)**.\nWhen **grievances erupt into war (其创之发则战)**,\nwar **brings the common people to their deaths (则是使元元之民往死)**.\n\nThe **mistakes of evil ministers (邪臣之失)**—\n**blame arises from above (蓟音策也，过生於上)**,\n**punishment descends from below (罪死於下)**—\n**once they are exposed (俨既外结)**,\nthe **feudal lords accumulate their crimes (诸侯畜其罪)**,\nthen **they may be accused of endangering the state (或作责危覆社稷)**,\ncausing the **rulers of the age to tremble in fear (世主慑惧)**,\n**isolating them in cold dread (寒心孤立)**.\n\nIf they **are not punished (不伐)**,\nthough **they may be replaced (伐或作代)**,\n**there is still the threat below (下有威字)**.\nSuch a man **becomes a source of perpetual conflict between two states (二国之难不解)**,\nand the **sovereign’s authority is lost (君立不复)**.\n\n**Regret comes too late (悔曩或作晨邮过)**,\n**plans shift and change (谋徙计易)**.\nEven **a single error (滥一作监首)** is **not enough to bear (不足)**—\n**yet it is piled upon him (盖以累重)**;\n**if he is the mastermind (滥为谋首)**, his **faults are grave indeed (其过重矣)**.\n**How can one man’s hands block the world’s eyes (而一人之手岂足以障天下之目哉)**?\n\n**Extinction of his clan and ruin of his kin (灭门残族#33)**—\n**this is the house punishment (灭门，周官所谓屋诛)**.\n**The sovereign apologizes to all (公谢天下)**,\n**to atone to enemy states (以让敌国)**.\nIf not,\nthen **the Dao of war (战道)** will **never cease (不绝)**,\nand **the state’s wounds will never heal (国创不息)**.\n**This is called “exhausting grievances” (谓之伸创)**—\n**for such is their fate (以此故也)**.\n\n**Ah, the great harm of ignorance (大或作天乎哉，夫弗知之害)**!\n**For the harm of not knowing is vast indeed (以言弗知之害大矣)**.\n**Alas, the extremity of their calamity (悲乎哉，其祸之所极)**!\n**For their misfortune is truly sorrowful (以言其祸可悲也已)**.\n**This is leaning on nobility while abandoning the Dao (此倚贵离道)**,\n**a fate of few men and many faults (少人自有之咎也)**—\n**excessive self-reliance, neglect of others (多己少人)**.\n**Thus, before the army even advances (师未发轫)**, its **defeat is already foreseen (而兵可迭也)**.\n**“The Near Defeat” (《近迭》)** is a **famous chapter (名篇)**,\n**taken from this very principle (盖取诸此)**.\n\nNow, **the sovereigns of great states (今大国之君)**,\n**do not heed the teachings of the ancient sages (不闻一作问先圣之道)** but **pursue their own desires (而易事)**,\n**while their ministers lack wisdom (旱臣无明)** to **assist in great matters (佐之大数)**,\nyet **possess cunning (滑正之碎或无碎字智)**—\n**they act contrary to principle (反义而行之)**,\n**govern against virtue (逆德以将之)**,\n**their armies are disgraced (兵讪)**,\n**their words exhausted (而辞穷)**,\n**their commands ignored (令不行)**,\n**their prohibitions defied (禁不止)**—\n**what is there left to wonder at (又奚足怪或作恃哉)**?\n\n**Pangzi said: What of this cunning (庞子曰：何若滑正之智)**?**\n**Zhuanguanzi replied: The laws cannot be bent (鹖冠子曰：法度无以噫一本作遂意为摸)**—\n**to grasp (噫，读为噫彼小星之噫)**.\n**Even sages, following patterns and laws (圣人按数循法)**, still **fall short (尚有不全)**.\n**Thus, he who does not master his own laws (是故人不百其法者)**,\n**cannot rule the world (不能为天下主)**.\n\nNow, **without principle (无数)** yet **self-reliant (而自因)**,\n**without law (无法)** yet **self-sufficient (而自备)**,\n**following no higher sage’s guidance (循无上圣之或作圣人检)**,\n**but judging by his own limited understanding (而断於己明)**—\n**though his affairs may seem complete (人事虽备)**,\n**how can such a ruler ever perfect himself (将尚何以复百己之身乎)**?**\n\n**For perfection is not his alone (夫百己者，岂独彼有之)**.\n**Man is born between heaven and earth (盖人受天地之中以生)**,\n**to nurture his form (形体)**,\n**to preserve his spirit (保神)**,\n**and all marvels are complete within him (而众妙悉备)**.\n**Yet in truth (据今言之)**,\n**his body contains myriad times more than he knows (其身盖有千百於己者)**,\n**and he ends in oblivion (然而所知才止一二)**,\n**for he cannot even perfect himself (而卒於泯没无问者)**—\n**he cannot master it (不能复之而已)**.\n\n**If the sovereign’s knowledge is unclear (主知不明)**,\n**he takes nobility for the Dao (以贵或作责为道)**,\n**and personal whim for law (以意为法)**,\n**tying or restraining (牵或作牢，或作罕)**.\n**The times are deceived (时诳一作诅)**—\n**or perhaps rejected (或作拒)**.\n**The world is misled (世)**,\n**as the low obscures the high (迢下蔽上)**,\n**and affairs become disjointed (使事两乖)**—\n**both are lost (两失之矣)**.\n\n「Nourishing is not a lasting loss. To take stillness as disturbance, to regard ease as peril—\nthe common folk suffer hardship, and people grieve.\nWhat calamity could be greater than this?\n\nIf one acts thus, on the day he flees north,\nhis army will be defeated that very day.\nWhen he realizes his fate is lost,\nhe will have already cast himself into the land of death long ago.\n\nPangzi said: *\"How can one govern with myriad laws?\"*\nThe **Huguanzi** replied: *\"Cangjie created the laws.\nThe original form of the character *fǎ* (法) was written beneath *shū* (书).\nCangjie, the scribe of the Yellow Emperor,\nfirst observed the tracks of birds and beasts receding into the distance,\nand thus invented writing and contracts.\nWriting begins with *jiǎzǐ* (甲子).\nThe sun begins at *jiǎ* (甲),\nand the earthly branches at *zǐ* (子).\nEstablished scribes, the **Liguan** (李官),\n—*chéngshǐ* (成史), meaning those who completed and reported cases to the ruler,\nand *Liguan* (李官), meaning the judicial officers—\ndid not follow the Dao.\nYet without Cangjie, there would be no rise of script and ink.\nThough Cangjie invented writing without teaching the scribes and judicial officers,\nscript and ink began to sprout from this moment.\nThis is the origin of myriad laws.\n\nEven if the laws are recorded in diagrams,\ntheir purpose—illustrating the heart,\nexpressing intentions,\nand promoting the Dao—\nis but a fraction, perhaps one-tenth,\nof what they truly contain.\nHow could one without script and ink\never fully exhaust their intentions in diagrams?\n\nFrom the perspective of later ages,\nwriting is for practical convenience,\nseals are inferior to cursive script,\nand cursive script is inferior to草书 (*cǎoshū*).\nThus, the bluntness of diagrams in responding to affairs is evident.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"To weave together the affairs of the world,\nto record what endures and lasts far into the future,\nto depict what is unseen by the eye,\nand to transmit what the heart cannot comprehend—\nnothing surpasses writing.\"*\n\n*\"Unseen by the eye\"* refers to what is subtle and barely perceptible,\n*\"uncomprehended by the heart\"* refers to what is profound and elusive.\nThus, those who know myriad laws\nare the **Jiexiong** (桀雄) [tyrants and heroes].\nIf one understands them as *\"transcending form, the unseen, and the yet-to-be\"*—\nthen he knows the will of ten thousand people.\nThis is the power of virtue (*dé*), not merely the knowledge of tyrants and heroes.\nThus, his understanding surpasses that of ten thousand people,\nfor it spans these three realms beyond ordinary perception.\n\n*\"The yet-to-be\"* is superior to *\"the unseen\"* (*wúxíng*),\nand *\"the unseen\"* is superior to *\"the formless\"* (*húnlún*).\nIn analogy, if one speaks of the **Taiji** (太易),\nit is *\"the yet-to-be\"*;\nwhile *\"the Taichu\"* (太初),\nis the formless;\n*\"the Húnlún\"* (浑沦),\nis the yet-to-be in its primal state.\n\nOne without the wisdom of ten thousand people\ncannot dwell above the teachings of the world.\nPangzi said: *\"I have received strict instruction,\nand studied my craft with questions and answers.\"*\nYet when he consulted his teacher,\nhis disciples grew ever more fearful.\n\n**Huguanzi, Scroll One, ends here.**\nThe *Siku* edition states: *\"One version reads 'iron' (铁), but this is incorrect.\"*\n\nThe *Daozang* edition originally had *\"seize\"* (执) for *\"勢\"* (势), which is the ancient form of *\"勢\"* (势).\nNow it follows the *Siku* edition, reading *\"勢\"* (势).\n(Note: This passage originates from Jia Yi’s *Xin

together—\nhow does one respond?\"*\n\n**Húguānzǐ replies:**\n*\"The Dao differs; they do not deliberate together.\nThe Dao fulfills itself with humanity.\"*\n\n**Pángzǐ asks:**\n*\"If not the proper person, the Dao does not act in vain.\nI wish to hear the essentials of measuring the Divine’s deliberation and fulfilling its purpose—how so?\"*\n\n**Húguānzǐ says:**\n*\"Heaven is the Divine; Earth is form.\nWhen Earth is damp, fire arises—\nthe utmost Yang blazes forth, blazing from the Earth.\nWhen Heaven is dry, water arises—\nthe utmost Yin solemnizes, solemnizing from Heaven.\n\nWhen laws are fierce and punishments excessive, the Divine grows damp—\nlaws and punishments are Yin.\nIf the Divine grows damp, Heaven does not generate water.\n\nWhen sounds and tones are inverted, form grows dry—\nsounds and tones are Yang.\nIf form grows dry, Earth does not generate fire.\n\nIf water and fire do not arise,\nYin and Yang lack the means to form *qi*,\nmeasurements lack the means to establish order,\nthe Five Phases lack the means to wield their dominion.\nAll things lack the means to manifest their kind,\na hundred undertakings perish, ten thousand beings suffer.\n\nTeeming and chaotic—who comprehends their cause?\nHeaven and humanity share the same principles;\nEarth and humanity share the same order.\nHeaven’s patterns and Earth’s arrangements align with humanity.\n\nThe worthy and unworthy differ in ability—\nthus, the Sage cannot be disordered,\nas when Yáo and Shùn slew those who sought evil—\nlike Gōnggōng and Huàndōu—\nnor can the foolish be discerned,\nas when Jié and Zhòu slew those who sought good—\nlike Lóngróng and Bǐgān.\n\nYin and Yang are the rectitude of *qi*.\nHeaven and Earth are the rectitude of form and spirit.\nThe Sage is the rectitude of *virtue*.\nLaws are the rectitude of the four seasons.\nIf late spring enforces winter’s decrees, cold prevails;\nif late autumn enforces summer’s decrees, warmth prevails.\n\nThus, one principle lost here disrupts ten thousand there—\nthe loss is slight, yet the ruin is vast.\n\nWhat is called Heaven is not the vast *qi* of the sky;\nwhat is called Earth is not the bare soil beneath.\n*Bó* (膊) means ‘boundary of form.’\n\nWhat is called Heaven speaks of that which governs all things without being overcome—\nHeaven is the Way of the Sovereign,\nover whom nothing under Heaven prevails.\nWhat is called Earth speaks of that which balances all things without disorder—\nEarth is the Way of the Minister,\nleveling all things under Heaven without chaos.\n\nSound is its deliberation—\nharmonized comparisons form deliberation.\nTone is its action—\ndispersed implementation forms action.\nSound is Heaven’s three luminaries—\nthe three luminaries harmonized above.\nTone is Earth’s five senses—\nthe five senses dispersed below.\n\nWhen form and spirit align, life’s principles are refined—\nif form does not suffer from excessive dryness,\nif spirit does not suffer from excessive dampness,\nthen life’s principles are refined.\n\nTo nurture life excessively beyond its root is to lose *virtue*—\nif one over-nourishes its root beyond reason,\nwithout attaining comprehensive harmony,\nwhat is moderate becomes too much,\nand its *virtue* fails in response to things—\nhow could it speak to the *Classics* of nurturing life?\n\nThus it is said:\n*A master of nurturing life, like tending sheep,\ngoes behind the stragglers and urges them on.*\n\n[Missing character]—\nOne version omits a character; another reads [missing character], or [missing character] as *rú*

now evident.*\n\n*Severing harmony within humanity,*\n*governance falters from beginning to end.*\n*It speaks of governance that progresses from first to last*\n*yet loses the central path.*\n\nThus,

and punishing what is unreachable.*\n\n*Examining officials after their deeds yet failing to exhaust their love—*\n*‘Shǐ’ (史) means ‘envoy.’*\n*From ‘shěng’ (省).*\n*It speaks of not exhausting one’s own love yet demanding others’ exhaustion.*\n\n*Driving the people to completion yet not seeking their substance—*\n*‘Qū’ (区) means ‘to drive.’*\n*From ‘shěng’ (省).*\n*It speaks of not exhausting

*jing* of *qi* is unnatural,*\n*form departs from proper naming.*\n*The *Shūjīng* says:*\n*‘There is form and there is name.’*\n*Form is what designates this thing.*\n*Name is what commands this

only form,\nYet remain blind to its underlying *Dao/Way*.\nThey behold the sun and moon yet do not gain true clarity,\nThey hear thunder yet do not become truly wise.\nWhen matters arise, those who debate *dharma/virtue* (or *yì* 義) cannot alter fate’s inevitability.\nThey cannot extinguish it before its sprouting.\n\nThus, those who skillfully navigate change observe its roots:\nIf the roots are strong, all will be fulfilled;\nIf weak, then *virtue/power* (德) must be thin,\nAnd soldiers must grow weary.\nHow can they wield *biǎn* (褊, narrow-minded) materials\nTo praise *shāng yǐn* (襄隐, concealing virtues) or broaden *dharma/virtue* (博义)?\n\nThose whose words are smooth yet their actions yield no fruit,\nWhose deceit does not cease—\nThey arise from roots that are insufficient.\nIt is not a fault of few words or lack of martial prowess.\nHence, rulers have two *zhèng* (政, governance),\nAnd ministers have two *zhì* (制, measures).\nIf ministers do not apply them,\nThe ruler cannot enforce them,\nMinisters must perish,\nAnd the ruler cannot halt it.\nTherefore, the sage-king perceives alone,\nAnd establishes officials to entrust *cháng* (长, longevity/authority) to those within,\nAnd *hé* (和, harmony) to those without.\nWhen officials wield *cháng* (长, longevity/authority),\nWithin, they uphold justice;\nWithout, they defend the borders,\nAnd enforce laws to maintain order.\n\nHumans are inherently without harm,\nBy aligning with the proper order of Heaven and Earth,\nCommands flow from singularity—\nMany gates are sealed.\nDispersed without direction,\nTransforming all things—\nAll things (or *wúwù* 无物, nothingness) arise from *order* (令).\nGuarding the singular *Dao/Way*,\nRegulating all things—\nThis is *law* (法).\n*Law* (法) is the guardian within boundaries.\n*Order* (令) is the one who issues regulations.\n*Order* (令) is what implements *law* (法).\n\nIf *law* (法) does not fail in its principles,\nThese principles arise from *dharma/virtue* (義) that cannot be fixed,\nAnd thus they pursue change.\nIf *order* (令) does not harm *principle/rightness* (理),\nThe king issues it from singular *principle* (理一),\nAnd it cannot be altered—\nThis is what upholds *law* (法).\nHence, the virtuous obtain *respect* (尊),\nThe petty obtain *caution* (谨),\nAnd all are preserved—\n*Cháng* (昌, flourishing) or *mǐ* (靡, decline).\n\nThe mind is complete in its *divine* (神) essence,\nThe form is complete in its *Dao/Way* (道).\nIt fulfills the virtues of Heaven and Earth,\nAnd embodies the *divine* (神明) countenance.\n\nHumans rely on established *principles* (则),\nAnd on established *law* (法).\nThe scholar uses them as his measure.\n*Law* (法) is adjusted while *Yin* and *Yang* are harmonized.\n\nThe *fènghuáng* (凤凰, phoenix) is the bird of *zhēnhuǒ* (鹑火, or *wúzhēnhuǒ* 无鹑火, perhaps no bird),\nThe *xiāngxiū* (玄枵, dark void) beast—\nThe essence of *Yang*.\nThe male is called *fèng* (凤),\nAnd *huáng* (凰) is its female counterpart.\n*Zhēnhuǒ* (鹑火) is the second star of *Nánxīng* (南星, Southern Dipper).\nThe *qílín* (麒麟, kirin) is the *xiāngxiū* (玄枵) beast,\nThe essence of *Yin*.\nThe female is called *lín* (麟),\nAnd *qí* (骐) is its male counterpart.\n*Xiāngxiū* (玄枵) is the second star of *Běixīng* (北星, Northern Dipper).\n*Qí* (骐) resembles *lín* (麟) yet lacks horns.\n\nThe *wànmín* (万民, ten thousand people) are the essence of *virtue/power* (德),\nFor *virtue/power* (德) can gather them—\nOr *jùn* (骏, swift/strong).\nWhen their essence fully arrives,\nPangzi asks:\n*How does one gather them?*\n\nThe **Huluguanzi** says:\n\nThe **Heaven and Earth**, *Yin* and *Yang*, take their measure from the body,\nThus the **Five Rectitudes** are arranged to govern the **Five Clarities**#12.\nThe **Five Rectitudes** are explained below.\nThe **Five Clarities** should be understood as:\n*Clarity of the Vital Essence* (名尸气皇),\n*Clarity of the Divine Mind* (名尸神明),\n*Clarity of the Virtuous Sage* (名尸贤圣),\n*Clarity of the Sovereign Ruler* (名尸后王),\n*Clarity of the Noble Minister* (名尸公伯).\nThe **Ten Transformations** and **Nine Ways**—\nTheir details I have not yet heard.\nThe measure begins with the body.\nThe **Five Tones** and **Six Pitches** take their origin from the body.\nGreat **Yǔ** established **sound** as the **pitches** and the **body** as the **measure**—\nThis is what is meant by *\"taking measure from the body.\"*\n**Five times five** makes **twenty-five**, by which the world is governed.\n**Five** refers to the **Five Tones**.\n**Six times six** makes **thirty-six**, by which the **yearly pattern** is established.\n**Six** refers to the **Six Pitches**.\nThe **pattern of a year** corresponds to **thirty-six decads**.\n*Qi* is generated by the **Spirit**,\nThe **Way** is completed by the **Spirit**.\nTo **shed** *qi* is called **emptiness**,\nTo **shed** emptiness is called the **Way**.\nYet the **Spirit**—\nIt exists yet is not *qi*,\nIt does not exist yet is not the **Way**.\nThough not *qi*, it gives rise to *qi*,\nThough not the **Way**, it completes the **Way**.\nOnly the **Sage** can rectify the **tones** and harmonize the **sounds**,\nThus his **virtue/power** ascends to **Tàiqīng**—\n**Tàiqīng**, the Heaven—\nDescends to **Tàiníng**—\n**Tàiníng**, the Earth—\nAnd permeates all **ten thousand beings**.\nGlistening dew descends,\nWhite **elixir** emerges,\n**Liquor-spring** flows,\n**Liquor-spring**, its taste like *lì* (fermented rice wine), can nourish the aged.\n**Crimson grass** grows,\n**Crimson grass**, which can dye for rank distinction.\nAll auspicious signs are complete.\nThe *Transmission* says:\nThe **Sovereign** unifies *Yin* and *Yang*,\nThe **auspicious *qi*** fills the world,\nThe **auspicious signs** all arrive,\nResponding to **virtue/power** and appearing.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches Heaven, the **Polaris** shines bright, the sun and moon radiate light, and sweet dew descends.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches Earth, fine millet grows, *bìngjiá* (a type of bean) sprouts, and *jùshāng* (a sacred wine) emerges.\nWhen **virtue/power** manifests in culture, the **august star** appears, and the **Five Celestial Stems** move in harmony.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches plants, **crimson grass** grows, and trees bear connected branches.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches birds and beasts, the **phoenix** soars, the **luán** (mythical bird) dances, the **qílín** arrives, the **white tiger** appears, the **white pheasant** descends, the **white deer** is seen, and the **white crow** alights.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches mountains and hills, **august clouds** emerge, **lingzhi** mushrooms flourish, hills yield strange **elixir**, mounds produce *yúfú* (a medicinal herb), mountains bear chariots and vehicles, and marshes yield divine tripods.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches deep waters and springs, the **yellow dragon** appears, the **liquor-spring** surges, the **Yellow River** reveals dragon scriptures, the **Luo River** presents turtle books, the **Jiang River** yields great shells, and the **sea** produces bright pearls.\nWhen **virtue/power** reaches the **eight directions**, the **auspicious wind** arrives, the **auspicious *qi*** is timely, the **bells and drums** are attuned, the **musical measures** are applied, the **four barbarians** are civilized, and the **Yùzhōu** (southern peoples) offer tribute.\nThus, when all auspicious signs are complete,\nThe **Way of the Outer Sovereign and Inner Spirit** is fully realized.\nThe **august star** shines luminous.\nThe **august star** is the **star of virtue/power**.\nIts form is not constant,\nYet it always appears in lands of the **Dao**,\nAnd when the month dies, it appears to assist the moon in illuminating the people’s nightly labors.\nIn times of **culture**, it causes the world’s armies to rest;\nIn times of **martial might**, no army in the world can resist it.\nOne version reads: *\"In times of martial might, none in the world can resist.\"*\nWithout the word *\"armies\"*.\nFar becomes near,\nHidden becomes manifest,\nGreat becomes small,\nMany become few—\nNone do not begin from the subtle.\nThus what is **obtained** in its completion cannot be fully described;\nWhat is **lost** in its defeat cannot be fully named.\nOne version reads: *\"cannot be fully named\"* instead of *\"described.\"*\nFrom this onward—or one version reads *\"From life onward\"*—\nYour son cannot answer,\nNor can I speak of it.\nThe essentials of inquiry:\nTo know the near and foresee the far,\nTo govern the **One** and transform the **Ten Thousand**.\nA ruler without desire cannot be spoken to of governance.\nWhat does this mean?\nAccording to my learning,\nThe ruler’s affliction lies in excessive desire.\nThis is why **Mencius**, though he saw the **King of Qi** three times, spoke not,\nSaying: *\"I first attack his perverse heart.\"*\nThus it is said:\n*\"Within, he is filled with excessive desire,\nYet outwardly, he practices benevolence and righteousness—\nHow can he hope to emulate the governance of **Tang** and **Yú**?\"*\nThe *Nánhuá* (Southern Flower) says:\n*\"If desire follows harmony, the *qi* becomes even,\nIf desire seeks the Spirit, the mind becomes still,\nIf desire strives for correctness, it follows necessity.\"*\nThis differs from the *Huluguanzi*.\nIn ancient times, **Guǐgǔ** wrote a book\nTo persuade the **Marquis** through eloquence,\nUsing **open** and **closed** tactics,\nNecessarily aligning with their likes and dislikes, joys and sorrows, to **open or close** accordingly.\nYet when one reaches the **desireless**,\nOne cannot persuade them.\nIf so, a ruler with excessive desire becomes the **Horizontalist’s** target,\nSeeking to sell their schemes.\nBut the *Huluguanzi* speaks of the **Way**,\nYet its later currents descend to this—\nIs it not too base?\nIf the **virtuous** are not employed,\nThe state cannot be made prosperous—\nThis is its essential point.\n\n**Pángzǐ** asked: *\"May I ask about the **Five Rectitudes**?\"*\nThe **Huluguanzi** replied: *\"There is **Spirit-transformation**, **Official governance**, **Teaching governance**, **Adaptive governance**, and **Action-governance**—or one version reads **‘Contention-governance’**.\"*\n\n**Pángzǐ** asked: *\"I wish to hear their forms.\"*\nThe **Huluguanzi** replied: *\"**Spirit-transformation** acts before creation,\n**Official governance** follows the **root**,\n**Teaching governance** cultivates within oneself,\n**Adaptive governance** does not alter customs,\n**Action-governance** corrects—or one version reads **‘rectifies’**—at the end.\"*\n\n**Pángzǐ** asked: *\"I wish to hear their practices.\"*\nThe **Huluguanzi** replied: *\"**Spirit-transformation**—\nIt stabilizes Heaven and Earth,\n**Prefigures** the **Four Seasons**,\nIts **essence** is always thus.\nIt **extracts**—or one version reads **‘teaches’**—*Yin* and *Yang*,\nIt **transfers** cold and heat.\nIts **essence** changes thus.\nThe *Transmission* says:\nThe **True Person** of antiquity\n**Lifted** Heaven and Earth,\n**Grasped** *Yin* and *Yang*.\nThe **flow** was rectified, and all things were born without harm,\nAll classes were fully realized—\nThis is called **Clarity of the Vital Essence**.\n**Fúyì** obtained it,\nTo inherit the **Essence-Mother**.\nIs this not close?\n**Official governance**—\nIt **models** *Yin* and *Yang*,\n*Yin* and *Yang*, the **root of royal affairs**,\nResponding to what should be.\n**Spirit-transformation** acts before creation,\nThus it ascends to a higher rank.\nEarth is tranquil, Heaven is clear,\nAll beauties gather—\nThis is called **Clarity of the Divine Mind**.\n**Teaching governance**—\nIt **establishes** the **Four Seasons**,\nSuch as reciting in spring, playing strings in summer, studying rites in autumn, and reading books in winter,\nFollowing the seasons and aligning with *qi*—\nThus its **achievements** are easy.\"\n\n**Translation:**\n\n*\"To govern by aligning with the Dao—\nBow low to govern, rise high to align with the Dao.\nThis is called **Exalted Sagehood**.\n\nFor those who rule,\nThey summon **Exalted Sagehood** and cultivate the **Art of the Dao-heart**,\nWith reverence in service, harmony in life—\nThis is called **Later Sovereignty**.\n\nFor those who govern,\nThey summon **Ren-Sainthood** and seek wisdom within,\nYet cannot summon **Exalted Sagehood** nor attain the **Art of the Dao-heart**—\nOnly **Ren-Sainthood** and wisdom.\n\n**Sainthood** is the **Dao of Heaven**.\n**Exalted Sagehood** is the **Dao of Earth**.\n**Ren-Sainthood** is the **Dao of Man**.\n\nIf one **refines the herding of the Spirit**—\n*Refinement* is urgent command,\n*Herding* is driving and restraining.\nOfficials are appointed, their roles defined,\nYet the **Spirit-essence** grows weary,\nUnable to **pervade universally**,\nThus additional officials are established.\n\n**Teaching** is bitter yet its benefits are distant—\nThough teaching is bitter, its benefits are distant.\nFrom this arise **laws and institutions**.\nThe myriad laws are in tumult—\nFrom here they arise.\n\n**Law** is to make one abandon private gain for the public good—\n**Law** is to remove, not to bestow.\n**Uniform knowledge and unified warning**—\nIt is to have those of shared principle,\nNot to force private conformity.\n\nThus, in the **most refined governance**, it is not so—\nYet it is called **Public Lordship**.\n*Public* as in the **Public Lord**,\n*Lord* as in the **Dominant Sovereign**.\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Hammer of Kings**\nPangzi asked the **Crowned Crane Master**:\n‘The **Dao of the Supreme Sage**—\nWhen one clan upholds it, it lasts ten thousand years.\nThe *Transmission* says:\n*\"When Heaven and Earth were first established,\nThe **Celestial Sovereign**—also called **Heavenly Spirit**—\nRuled for ten thousand years.\nThus, the **Supreme Sage** was likely another name for the **Celestial Sovereign**.\n\nYet in the world, armies grew strong,\nAnd the age could not be seized.\nWhen Heaven and Earth were first established,\nHow could there already have been armies?\nThis is but a **fishing net and trap**—\nA metaphor, not fact.’\n\nThe *Southern Bloom* says:\n‘Allegory is nineteen parts,\nRepeated speech is seventeen parts.\nTo endure with Heaven and Earth,\nLong since severed from all resemblance.\n*Severed*—the most refined distinction.’\n\nThe *Central Harmony* says:\n‘Even hair retains its order.\nTo equal the disparate—\nThe vast difference between **Peng and Wild Goose** in size,\nThe varying lengths of **Teal and Crane**—\nThis is insufficient to describe their divergence.\nSuch is their utter separation.’\"*\n\nThe world has none who do not speak of **cultivating customs and establishing transformations**—\nyet how could he alone **practice the Dao** to reach such an extreme?\n\nThe *Lüguanzi* says:\n*\"He achieved the Dao of the Peng Sovereign of Heaven.\"* (A pause.)\n\nThus, none could **augment his virtue/power** or **exalt his spiritual essence**.\n\nPangzi said:\n*\"What is this Dao of Heaven?*\n*How does it manifest so that none can augment his virtue/power or exalt his spiritual essence?\"*\nThis is to **inquire into its origin**.\n\nThe *Lüguanzi* replied:\n*\"The Dao of Heaven is the **authenticity of the Sun’s virtue/power**.*\n*The Sun either has its name or does not—*\n*when the solstices come,*\n*winter brings the Sun’s retreat to the north,*\n*summer brings its return to the south.*\n*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as a principle.*\n*He takes the **centrality of the Sun’s virtue/power**.*\n\n*The Dao of Heaven is the **trustworthiness of the Moon’s phases**.*\n*The Moon trusts in death and trusts in birth,*\n*ending to begin anew—*\n*when the new moon arrives, the light is born,*\n*when the full moon arrives, the light dies.*\n*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as governance.*\n*He takes **rectitude from the Moon’s phases**.*\n\n*The Dao of Heaven is the **illumination of the stars’ alignment**.*\n*The stars are the great stars—*\n*those of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.*\n*Though their ranks may be **eroded or arranged**,*\n*they proceed in their proper order,*\n*so that none can disrupt their **chaptered harmony**.*\n*Small stars do not vanish when obscured.* (Missing character: *#18*)\n\n*The Dao of Heaven is the **adherence to seasonal order**.*\n*The four seasons follow their names,*\n*replacing or **transforming** each other without **encroaching or clashing**.*\n*Thus, none dare fail to follow it as an inevitable law.*\n*He takes **timely regulation** from the seasons.*\n\n*The Dao of Heaven is the **unity of its singular method**—*\n*whether it be **manifest or latent**,*\n*its **identity remains unchanged**.*\n*Before and

classics**—\n*(Or: \"mere patterns\")*—**reversing principles**—\n*(Or: \"fatherly principles\")*—\nThese are the ones that **mutually illuminate**.\n**Colors and flavors** are **mutually measured**,\n**Ornament and bloom** are **mutually completed**,\n*\"Ornament\"* refers to **patterns**,\n*\"Ornament\"* like the **stems of grass**,\n*\"Bloom\"* like the **flowers of wood**.\nThe **many**—\nIf the **many** originate from **my self**,\nThen they can be **unified** with a **single standard**.\n*(Standard: **Gong**.)*\n**Request**—\n*(Request: as in \"ask for further instruction.\")*\nIf the **many** originate from **my self** and number in the **thousands and ten-thousands**,\nThen even their **unification** lies within **my self**.\n**Request** with a **single standard**,\nAnd there is **nothing** that cannot be **accomplished**.\n\n「The governance of **affectionate compliance** *(Or: \"politics of harmonious love\")*—**distinct types mutually accommodate** *(Or: \"diverse natures find mutual harmony\")*;\n*The Liezi* states: *\"The tiger and man differ in kind, yet if the tiger curries favor with those who nourish it, that is compliance.\"*\n\nThe governance of **contrary compliance**—**same types mutually perish** *(Or: \"like natures mutually annihilate\")*.\n*The Classic of Transmission* says: *\"How do we know that father and son will not become wolves and jackals?\"*\nThus, the **Sage** establishes **Heaven as Father** and **Earth as Mother**,\n*(Or: \"Heaven as Father, Earth as Mother\")*—\nnot to **force** *(Or: \"compel\")* all to be **identical** *(Or: \"the same\")*,\nbut to **know the singular principle** *(Or: \"the unified Dao\")*\nso as to **harmonize one person** *(Or: \"guide a single individual\")*.\n\n**Permeating** *(Or: \"Wandering freely\")* **erratically** *(Or: \"without fixed bounds\")*\nbetween **Heaven and Earth**,\nyet **every person** is **enveloped** *(Or: \"encompassed\")* by its **harmony**.\n*(Or: \"everyone is nourished by its concord.\")*\nThis means the **Sage** **knows the singular principle** to **harmonize one person**,\nand **only the heart** is thus.\n*(Or: \"yet only the heart is the key.\")*\n\n**Permeating** *(Or: \"Wandering freely\")* **erratically** between **Heaven and Earth**,\nevery person is **enveloped** by its **harmony**,\nnot to **force** them to be **identical**.\nThus it is said:\n*\"The emotion of one person—\nthat is the emotion of thousands and ten-thousands of people.\"*\n\n**Harmony** is **formless yet imbued with flavor** *(Or: \"taste\")*.\n**Harmony** is **the Dao**.\nIndeed, **the Dao** is **formless yet imbued with flavor**.\n\n**Conformity to harmony** is **Ren** *(Or: \"benevolence\")*.\n**Conformity with the Dao’s harmony**—\n**mutual accommodation** *(Or: \"intimate closeness\")*—is **Yi** *(Or: \"righteousness\")*.\n**Conformity with the Dao’s harmony**—\n**mutual accommodation**—is **Yi**.\nIndeed, **without the Dao**, **Yi** cannot **accommodate** *(Or: \"hold sway\")*,\nand **without Yi**, **the Dao** cannot **accommodate**.\n**Ren and Yi** are **what one delights in** *(Or: \"the shared essence of self-naming\")*—\n**what one delights in** *(Or: \"the self-called\")*—\n**formless internal governance** *(Or: \"internalized law\")*.\nThis means: **if one conforms to the delight of Ren and Yi**,\nthen **government and law**, though they exist, are **truly void within**.\n*(Or: \"the true emptiness of the heart.\")*\nIndeed, **what is called \"true emptiness\"** *(Or: \"true void\")*—\n**that is because there is nothing that does not allow for existence** *(Or: \"nothing that hinders being\")*.\n\nThus, the **Sage** **knows the divine method** *(Or: \"the divine plan\")*,\n**adjusting** *(Or: \"harmonizing\")* **without form**,\nand **all things** follow accordingly.\n**Heaven** receives **breath and bloom** *(Or: \"the vital essence of patterns and

things**.\n**Earth** receives **Heaven’s seasons** to **bear all things**.\n\n**Divine Saints** *(Or: \"The Sage and the Divine\")*—\n*(Or: \"The Sage and the Divine, who deeply grasp the principles\")*—\n*(Or: \"The Sage and the Divine, who deeply grasp the principles\")*—\n**are distant from the grasp of command** *(Or: \"hold no sway over life and death\")*.\n*(Or: \"The grasp of

**grinds all things to dust** *(Or: \"reduces them to powder\")* **without causing harm**,\nthough **soothing Earth’s burden** *(Or: \"assuaging Heaven’s responsibility\")*—\nit is **possible**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Laozi** ascended to **destroy the Five Emperors** *(Or: \"overthrow the Five Sovereigns\")*,\n**reaching back to the Three Sovereigns** *(Or: \"extending to the Three August Ones\")*,\nyet **Western Domain’s** *(Or: \"the Western Regions’\")* **scholars** have **those who shout Buddha and curse the Ancestors**,\nare they **near this truth**?\n*(Or: \"are they close to

*(Or: \"as stated earlier\")*,\nthen **Heaven, Earth, and Man’s affairs**—\nhow could they **transcend this**?\n\n**The Grand Concordance, Chapter Eleven** *(Or: \"The Grand Concordance, Section

Unity’s core**—\n*(Or: \"the core of the Grand One\")*—\n**core** *(Or: \"the word ‘core’\")*—**the central** *(Or: \"the middle\")*.\n**To have no exit nor entry is to establish** *(Or: \"the fixed point\")*.\n**This is to govern all things** *(Or: \"to make them conform\")*.\n\n**Entering to discuss the Grand Abyss within**,\n**exiting to observe the divine luminosity without**,\n**establishing the measure of the Grand Unity’s core**—\n**this governs all things** *(Or: \"to make them conform\")*.\n\n**Heaven** has **nine expanses** *(Or: \"nine vast regions\")*.\n*The Record of Lost Recollections* says:\n*\"Gazing at three cauldrons like heaped rice,\nbeholding eight expanses as winding belts.\"*\nScholars say:\n*\"Eight expanses—\nthe eight directions’ names.\n**Expanses**—**vast and grand** *(Or: \"the word ‘expanses’ means ‘vast and grand’\")*.\nThus, **the nine expanses** are **perhaps nine encircling regions**?\"\n\n**Earth** has **nine provinces**—\n*(Or: \"this is what Master Zhou [Zhou Dunyi] called the nine provinces\")*—\n**not the same as Yu’s division**.\n\n**The Grand Unity’s Dao** *(Or: \"The Dao of the Grand One\")*—\n**the transmission of the Nine Sovereigns** *(Or: \"the teachings of the Nine August Ones\")*—\n**I request** *(Or: \"I ask\")* **its completion at the end of the Grand Beginning** *(Or: \"the Grand Origin\")*.\n\n**The Grand Unity’s Dao** is **perfected** *(Or: \"complete\")*,\nthus the **upper section** *(Or: \"previous chapter\")* says:\n*\"The Nine Sovereigns receive transmission,\nto trace where their **‘thusness’** *(Or: \"‘so-being’\")* originates.\"*\nAnd now it is said again:\n*\"Their transmission was perhaps completed at the Grand Beginning\"*—\n**indeed, without the Grand Beginning, one cannot truly know it**.\nThe **‘end’**—\n**this means to comply with the lower winds and request** *(Or: \"to follow the lower currents and ask\")*.\n\n**Seeing** *(Or: \"Upon seeing\")*—\n*(Or: \"Perhaps omitting *‘seeing’*\")*—**the details beyond mere names and principles**,\nthis means: **only the outline is revealed**,\n**yet more must be sought in their convergence**.\nThus the **following text** says:\n\n**Governing without form** *(Or: \"The formless standard\")*,\n**adjusting without flavor** *(Or: \"The flavorless adjustment\")*—\nto **seek the convergence of names and principles**.\n**Governing**—**the rectification of form**.\n**Adjusting**—**flavor**.\n**Rectification**—as in *\"covering grievances with their rectification\"*—\n**this means form is nourished by flavor**.\n\n**Flavor**—**the parent of qi** *(Or: \"the parent and mother of qi\")*.\nIf **qi** is insufficient, **supplement it with essence**.\nIf **essence** is insufficient, **supplement it with flavor**.\n**Essence**—*(Or: \"perhaps omitting ‘essence’\")*—**the subtle and clear** *(Or: \"the pure and refined\")*—\n**the beginning of Heaven and Earth** *(Or: \"the origin of Heaven and Earth’s transformation\")*.\n\n**Speaking of form, speaking of flavor, yet also speaking of this**—\n**this is to seek the convergence of names and principles**,\nand **also to attain these three things**.\n\n**Seeing** *(Or: \"Perhaps omitting *‘seeing’*\")*—**form ground into mincemeat** *(Or: \"form butchered\")*,\n**yet all under Heaven call it beautiful**—\n**this is the Great Dao** *(Or: \"the right path\")*.\n\n**Erratic movement** *(Or: \"Misaligned actions\")*—**harmonizing intentions** *(Or: \"uniting wills\")*,\n**supporting righteousness** *(Or: \"upholding Yi’s foundation\")*—**Ren is its root** *(Or: \"its origin is Ren\")*.\n**Accumulating what compliance brings** *(Or: \"The accumulated fruit of compliance\")*—\n**this is what the ancient Sages produced**.\n\n**Those who walk the Dao** have **its name**,\n**those who perform its deeds** have **its function**.\nThis means: **the governance of Ren and Yi**,\nthus **those who walk the Dao** have **its name**,\n**those who perform its deeds** have **its function**.\n\nIf **the Sage** has **no name**,\nand **the Divine Person** has **no function**,\n**riding upon virtue and power** *(Or: \"surfing the Dao and its transformations\")*,\n**wandering freely above all things**—\nthen **how could they be confined to the domain of Ren and Yi**?\n\nThus the **following text** says:\nHence, **Heaven and Earth** are **completed in the Original Qi** *(Or: \"the Primordial Void\")*,\nand **all things** **ride upon Heaven and Earth**,\n**Original Qi**—**the Great Emptiness** *(Or: \"the Grand Primordial\")*.\nThe **Great Emptiness** contains **Heaven and Earth**,\n**Heaven and Earth** contain **all things**,\nthus **its words** are such.\n\n**Divine Saints** **ride upon** *(Or: \"hold fast to\")* **virtue and power**,\n*(Or: \"as in *Zhuangzi*’s ‘without blame or praise, like a dragon or a snake’\")*—\nto **investigate their principles**.\n*(Or: \"Perhaps: ‘to rescue their divine essence, to investigate the principles of Heaven, Earth, and all things.’\")*\n\nIf the **Supreme Sage**—the **August Heavenly Sovereign**—is the **First Sage’s** foundation of **威威** *(威: awe/authority)* and **establishment of command**,\nthen **Emperor Yao, Emperor Shun, and the Three Dynasties’** edicts never failed to invoke **Heaven**—\nfor they relied solely on **威威** and **command**.\n\nBut when it comes to **achieving governance** in its own right,\nhow could it depend on **Heaven**?\nThis is something **within oneself**.\nThis is how **King Zhou** falsely invoked **the Supreme Deity** to no avail in his chaos.\n\nThus the **following text** says:\n**Achieving governance** lies within oneself.\n**Summon the lofty**, and it rises;\n**summon the lowly**, and it descends.\nThis speaks of governance’s **corruption or flourishing**—\nit depends on how **one summons it**.\n\nThere has never been one **confined to the humility of Guan Zhong and Yan Ying**\nwho could summon the **loftiness of Yao and Shun**.\n\nThus, **what is formed yet unchanging** is **measure** *(度)*;\n**what remains external yet within oneself** is **familiarity with chaos** *(狎沤)*#39.\nAs in **familiarity with chaos**—\nwhen the heart stirs within, the **chaos-black** *(沤乌)* dances yet does not descend—\nthis is **what remains external yet within oneself**.\n\n**Establishing form and principle** unaltered for ten thousand generations—\nthis is the **position of Heaven and Earth**.\n**Distinguishing things by name**, with **patterns and principles clearly marked**—\nthis is the **harmony of the Divine Saints**.\n*Harmony*, as in **leveling measures**.\n\n**Conforming to Heaven, dwelling on Earth**,\n**abandoning the square, embracing the round** *(or: **supervising**)*#40.\nThe **square** by **intelligence** becomes **obstructed**,\nthe **round** by **spirit** becomes **flowing**.\nThis is the **mirror of the Divine Saints**.\n\n**Embodied forms and named things**—\n**imitating them** is **embodiment** *(象)*,\n**discussing them** is **explanation** *(说)*.\n**Accomplishing deeds and completing affairs**—\n**hidden and manifest** never separate—\nthe **teaching of the Divine Saints**,\n**neither immediate nor distant**,\nyet where **the utmost subtlety converges**, the **coarsest** prevails;\nwhere **the utmost height reaches**, the **lowest** returns.\n**Hidden and manifest**—how could they separate?\nThis is the **teaching of the Divine Saints**.\n\n**Heaven** holds one position,\n**Earth** holds one position,\nand the **Sage harmonizes** between the two.\n**Harmonizing**, using **one to mirror the other**,\nusing **this to teach that**—\nthen the **principles of the world** are attained.\n\nOnly then do **all things fulfill their nature**.\nThus the **following text** says:\n**When the flow divides, spirit is born**—\n*Flow divides* refers to **water**.\n**Heaven’s One** generates **water**,\nand its **essence** in things is **precision**.\n**Precision** gathers, then **spirit** follows.\n\n**When movement ascends, clarity is born**—\n*Movement ascends* refers to **fire**.\n**Earth’s Two** generates **fire**,\nand its **spirit** in things is **divine essence**.\n**Divine essence** converges, then **awareness** follows.\n\n**Clarity reveals form**,\n**form establishes function**.\nThus, **patterns** are what **distinguishes things**,\n**principles** are what **names or records them**#40.\n**Heaven and Earth** are **cooperative yet distinct in domain**—\n**Heaven’s domain** is above,\n**Earth’s domain** is below.\n**Without a compass**, the **round** is **Heaven’s pattern**,\n**without a square**, the **straight** is **Earth’s principle**.\n**Heaven** follows **patterns** in motion,\n**Earth** follows **principles** in creation.\nThese two **ends** *(or: **Sage-ends**)* are **the law of spirit**#41.\nThe **law of spirit and clarity** is as such.\n\nThe **Sage-person**—\n**later than Heaven and Earth yet more honored**—\n**later than Heaven and Earth in birth**,\nyet **knows their beginning**;\n**earlier than Heaven and Earth in death**,\nyet **knows their end**.\n**The Way** encompasses them;\nthus **they know measure**;\ntheir **Way** encircles **outside Heaven and Earth**,\nso **they know what can be known**,\n**what can be measured**.\n**Honored and weighty**,\nthey **can alter motion** *(or: **without motion**)*;\n**transcend yin and yang**, **shift cold and heat**.\n**Keen** *(or: **numerous**)* in **clarity**,\nthey **can judge and decide**.\n**Spirit-essence** is the **most noble and vast** of things;\n**outside spirit-essence**, all else is **its residual dross**.\n**Inner Sagehood** is the **source of spirit-essence**;\n**outer kingship** is its **residual dross**.\nThus **Inner Sagehood** is the **source of spirit-essence**—\nnone is more noble, so **all defer to its governance**.\n**Governance** is what **protects essence, elevates spirit, and refines qi**.\n**Essence** desires **frugality**,\n**spirit** desires **nurturing**,\n**qi** desires **unity**—\nthus the **language** is as such.\n*Elevate* means **to excel and surpass**.\n\n**Secluded**, it does not **leak**;\n**heard**, it does not **weary**—\nnot wearying, **essence and clarity** reach through.\n**Clarity overused** becomes **dim**,\n**essence overused** becomes **exhausted**.\nThus they **command the capable**,\n**make them spirit-bright**—\n**without action**,\nthey **can employ the world with surplus**.\n**Hundred transformations** follow and change,\n**beginning and end** proceed and **foresee**#42.\n*Foresee* means **leisurely ease**.\n\n**Spirit-clarity** is the **accumulation of refined essence**,\n**Sage-Way** is the **ultimate convergence**#43.\n**Essence** gathers, **spirit** forms—\n**this is the extreme**.\n**Imperial decree, divine transformation**—\nthis is the **goal of governance**.\n**Utmost**, **exhausted**—\nnothing more can be added.\nThus **the teacher** *(or: **the ruler**)* **as sovereign**,\n**the student** *(or: **the subject**)* **as minister**.\nThe **highest virtue** becomes **Emperor**,\nthe **next virtue** becomes **the Three Ministers**,\nthe **highest rank** becomes **the feudal lords**.\n**High rank** is what **makes them feudal lords**.\n**Changing surnames to rule**,\nnot **using ancestral records** *(or: **rites**)* as **sovereigns**—\nthey **seek uniformity in the security of goodness**.\n**Yao passed rule to Shun**,\n**Shun passed rule to Yu**—\nthis is the **Way** they used.\n\n**Heaven and Earth’s movements** stir within the **chest**,\nthen **deeds are accomplished externally**;\n**all things emerge and return**,\nthen **harmony follows without harm**.\nThe **Sage’s heart** has **no external law**,\nyet **qi aligns with spirit**,\n**spirit aligns with the Void**.\n**Heaven and Earth’s vastness**, **all things’ multitude**—\ntheir **movements, emergences, returns** all within the **chest**,\nthen **how could deeds fail to succeed**,\n**how could things fail to prosper**?\n\n**Opening and closing the four seasons**,\n**guiding yin and yang’s shifts**,\n**drowning grievances**, **clarifying things**—\n*(doubtful)*\n**The world** assumes it is **natural**,\n**the people** say, *“This is how it is of itself.”*\nThis is how the **Divine Saints surpass all others**.\n\n**Zigong** said:\n*“Master Kong is Heaven—\none cannot ascend by steps.”*\n**Sagehood’s root** is **spirit-pattern**,\n**verified yet unseen**.\n**Emotion and nature** exist,\n**without action, without form**.\nThus **exceeding others is visible**,\n**transcending others is not distant**.\n\nThe *Nanhua* [1] asks: *\"When traveling southward, one reaches Ying [2].\nFacing north, yet not seeing the Ming Mountains [3]—why is that?\nIt is because one is far removed from them.\nThis is how the **Divine Saints** align in kind.*\n\nThus, the **Divine Saints** bind and knot their **threads** [4],\n**Zhuan** [5] takes analogy from the **cap** [6],\nwhile binding and knotting the clouds [7] serves to make clear\nthere is no fear of **precipitous fall** [8].\nKind upon kind brings forth creation,\n**using the One without exhaustion** [9].\nOr, **One acts, exhausting all uses** [10].\nThis is what is called **Zhongni’s** [11] **Divine Luminance** [12]:\nsmall things **prosper small things**, great things **prosper great things**,\ndown to **mountains, rivers, crows, beasts, grasses, and trees**—\n**abundant and effortless** [13].\n\n**Shadows** follow **forms**,\n**echoes** either **arise in response to sounds** [14]—\nthus, **forms and sounds** are **Heaven and Earth’s models** [15].\nThey follow and respond in kind,\nhence they are called **models**.\nThe **functions of the four seasons** [16],\n**yin and yang** cannot **single-handedly** fulfill [17].\nThe **Sage Kings** [18],\ndo not lose **beginning and end** [19],\nthus the **Divine Luminance** **endures from start to finish** [20].\nThey **assist, guide, and lead** [21]\n**yin and yang** in their **start-to-finish functions** [22]\nand the **four seasons’ operations** [23].\n**Ultimately**, the **changes of the eight winds** [24],\nthe **three luminaries** [25],\nor the **swirling *qi* that is not constant** [26]—\nwho does not **revere and follow** [27]?\n*\"Revere\"* means **to gather** [28],\nread as in *dūbǐ* [29].\nThis says that **people** **protect** the **Sage** [30],\nso when **yin and yang** lose **harmony**,\nthey **summon and request** [31] him\nto **gather and oversee** [33].\nEven so, the **root of great disorder** [34]\ntruly **begins here**.\nThis is why **Gengsang Chu** [35] **refuses to let go** of Lao Dan’s words.\nHence, the following text says:\n\nThus, **Divine Spirits** **radiate** with **Awe-Luminance** [36],\n**Lao Dan’s** *\"Awe-Luminance above\"* [37] **contradicts the brightness of sun and moon** [38].\n**Swift and slow, relaxed and urgent**—\n**the *qi* moves within** [39].\n**Lao Dan’s** *\"Within, it falls from the four seasons’ application*\" [40].\n**Extinguishing, harming, ruining, and bringing disaster** [41]—\n**below, it scatters the essence of mountains and rivers** [42].\n**Lao Dan’s** *\"Below, it dissipates the **vitality** of mountains and rivers*\" [43].\nThus, **Heaven and Earth’s** **yin and yang** **receiving their mandate** [44],\n**take their models** from the **Divine Saints’** **manifestations** [45],\nwhich have already been **seen**.\nTheir **effects**, as described above,\nhave also been **seen**.\nEven so, **can one truly dispense with the Sage’s governance** [46]?\nHence, the following text says:\n\n**Heaven** is where **the *qi*** **collectively emerges** [47];\n**rainbows**, **frost and dew**, **winds and rains**—\nthese are **accumulated *qi*** **forming Heaven** [48].\n**Earth** is where **principles** **must necessarily** [49] **be** [50].\n**Without limits, without prohibitions** [51],\nthis is the **Dao of Heaven** [52].\nThe **Dao of Earth** then **takes necessity** [53].\nThus, the **Sage** **emerges from Heaven** [54],\nhis **Dao** always **emerges from Heaven** [55].\n**He confines it to Earth** [56].\nHe **does not allow it to emerge from Earth** [57].\nWithin **Heaven and Earth**, like **yin and yang** [58],\nhe **blocks dryness and dampness** [59] **with righteousness** [60],\n**adapting with the times** [61].\nOr, **without the word \"thus\"** [62],\n**if yin**, he **blocks dryness with righteousness**,\n**if yang**, he **blocks dampness with righteousness** [63].\n**Du Wan** [64] says:\n*\"If **Divine Dampness** [65] arises, **Heaven** will not **generate water** [66].\nIf **forms become dry**, **Earth** will not **generate fire** [67].\nThese three** [68],\nthe **Sage** either **preserves** [69] **or** **loses** [70]—\n**Heaven loses its *pattern***, **Earth loses its *principle*** [71].\n**By this**, one **knows the former spirits** [72]—\nthe **former spirits**, the **spirits of the ancient kings** [73].\n**The kings** who **embody all things** [74],\n**hold the supreme virtue** and **grasp the Great Dao** [75].\nAll these are **the leaders of things** [76].\n**Until** the **world of Zuji’s** [77] **descendants**,\nwho **inherit** the **ruling position**,\nthough their **bodies** are not **virtuous** [78],\nyet **facing south** [79] **and claiming sovereignty** [80]\nstill **do not utterly perish** [81],\nit is because they **can accept teachings** from **scholars of the Dao** [82].\nOtherwise, **to guard ancestral temples**

when the virtue/power above declines, martial arts and knowledge both arise.\nThe Yellow Emperor fought a hundred battles—yet the full count of his wars is unknown.\nIt is said he fought the Yan Emperor three times at the wilds of Bàn Quán (阪泉), and Chiyou seven and twenty times at Zhúlù (涿鹿)—these are the rough outlines.\nChiyou’s *\"seven and twenty\"*—some say it lacks the two characters *\"无\"* (without).\n\nYao subdued Yǒu Táng (有唐).\n*The Commentary* says: *\"Yao assisted Emperor Zhì, receiving the fief of Táng, and at twenty years ascended the throne.\"*\nNow it says *\"Yao subdued Yǒu Táng\"*—this is unclear.\n*\"Subdued\"* may also be read as *\"replaced\"* (代).\n\nYú’s service—some read *\"subdued Yǒu Miáo\"* (伐有苗)—\nHeaven does not alter its constancy,\nEarth does not change its norms,\nYin and Yang do not disrupt their *qi*,\nLife and death do not shift their order,\nThe Three Luminaries do not vary their functions,\nThe spirit and brilliance do not abandon their laws.\nThus, the adept martial artist follows the Dao/Way in this manner.\n\nGain and loss do not exist in duality,\nSuccess and failure do not stand in opposition.\nWhat is called *\"the virtuous and the unvirtuous\"*—this is the same in ancient and modern times.\n\nThe gentleman does not grow weary,\nThe true person does not slacken#1.\nSlackening leads to dissolution,\nDissolution leads to ruin—\nHence the gentleman speaks of *\"ruin\"*,\nThe true person speaks of *\"slackening.\"*\n*The Rites* say: *\"Three days without slackening, three months without dissolution.\"*\nNever does one see long-term poverty or lowliness.\n\nThen there is the case of Yī Yǐn (伊尹), the wine steward of Jiān (简), who later became a minister;\nand the case of the Duke of Tào (太公), the butcher of cattle, who later became a world teacher.\n*The Commentary* says: *\"The Duke of Tào was young and poor, selling milk, when the weather turned cold;\nhe sold meat as a butcher, but when the weather grew hot, the meat spoiled.\"*\nGuan Zhòng made armor or grass mats,\nand Bǎilǐ Xī (百里奚) served as a slave.\nBǎilǐ Xī was a man of Yú (虞)—when Yú fell, the Jin lord humiliated him, forcing him to cook meals for Mù Jī (穆姬), and later to tend cattle in Qin. Was this truly the *\"slave\"* spoken of?\n\nWhen the world falls into chaos,\none rises as its teacher—\nall act with Heaven and Earth’s sage-like counsel.\nThe sun and moon never cease,\nthus the four seasons are perfected—\nthrough meticulous practice and mastery of forms,\none attains the spirit’s likeness.\n*The Nán Huá* (南华) says: *\"The ironworker’s art astonishes the beholder like the appearance of ghosts and gods.\"*\nIs this what is meant?\n\nWho can say they possess such ability?\n\nThe spoken is not from innate ability without learning.\nOne must first cultivate its use,\nthen understand its origins.\nThis is what is meant by:\nbeginning with origins,\nnurturing through nature,\nfulfilling through destiny.\n\nTang could overthrow Jie with seventy *li*,\nKing Wu could subdue Zhou with a hundred *li*—\nknowing one principle, no need for excess;\nknowing one principle, simplicity follows.\n\nA thousand schemes and myriad complexities,\nall blending into uniformity—\nwhen gathered under a singular essence,\nthey cannot differ.\n\nThe Dao of victory is not singular;\nthe methods of conquest are not confined to one path.\nThe wise calculate comprehensively—\nin battle, they must prevail;\nin assault, they must seize.\nA sagely commander does not abandon advantage for the sake of time,\nnor does a brave warrior fear death to extinguish his reputation.\n\nThose who seek to surpass the utmost virtue\nmust think differently from the common crowd.\nConforming to the crowd brings sickness of the mind;\nto surpass the utmost virtue is difficult indeed.\n\nTo verify the height of the Nine Heavens,\none does not walk a shortcut—\nhow can one reach it by asking for directions?\nThe Nine Heavens are fully revealed in the *Honglie Zhenjing*.\nThus, the southern realm is called the Vermilion Heaven,\nthe northern realm the Dark Heaven,\nthe central realm the Hooked Heaven, and so forth.\n\nTherefore, loyal ministers do not prioritize themselves over their lord,\nyet when isolated and abandoned,\nthey become suspended generals—\nin open battle, the nation weakens and the people exhaust;\nin city defense, they consume flesh and roast bones.\nSome even boil children for food,\nchopping corpses to cook.\nWhen strategy fails,\nthe state is diminished, the ruler constrained,\nand they become the laughingstock of the world.\nThose who manage state affairs—\nhow can they afford to be careless?\n\nThere are indeed errors in calculation,\nand there are trials—\ntrials may fail through negligence,\nencounters may fail through overrefinement;\nwhat matters is striking the balance.\nThus, Cao Mǐ served as Ru’s general,\nfighting three battles against Qi and losing a thousand *li*.\nHad Caozi not considered the aftermath,\nand instead died by his own hand,\nhe would have been no more than a defeated general, a captured commander.\nBut Caozi reasoned:\na defeated general is not courageous;\na diminished state and ruined name are not wise;\ndying while the lord is in peril is not loyal.\nThose who die for others cannot prolong another’s life,\nso he withdrew to advise the Ru lord.\n\nWhen Duke Huan assembled the feudal lords,\nCaozi seized the duke by the throne with a single sword,\nhis expression unchanging, his words unflinching.\nThe lost lands were recovered in a day,\nshaking the world, startling the neighbors,\nand his name echoed through the ages.\nHad he clung to petty resentment,\ngreat deeds would not have been accomplished.\nThus, Caozi abandoned transient anger\nto establish a lifelong legacy,\ndiscarding minor shame\nto earn renown for generations.\nHence, Caozi understood the times,\nand the Ru lord knew his men.\n\nJu Xin served as Yan’s general,\nfought against Zhao, and lost the battle.\nJu Xin took his own life,\nand Yan lost five cities.\nHe opened the door to disaster for himself,\ndied while endangering his lord,\nand his name and reputation perished—\nthis was failure,\na strategy without foresight.\nIt was not a lack of ability,\nbut rather a disregard for preserving life.\nThough Cao Mǐ’s actions coincided with Guan Zhong’s era,\nhe did not seek short-term gratification\nbut instead ensured Qi’s credibility among the feudal lords,\nthus fulfilling his reputation.\n\nAs for Li Ling’s surrender,\nhe sought to repay Han\nbut ultimately saw his entire clan exterminated,\nand the men of Longxi regarded it as shame.\nHow could Caozi’s bold action be considered ordinary?\nMuch less for a conqueror’s deeds.\n\nAs for those of *Wangde*’s virtue,\nwhose sincerity and clarity are innate,\nthey would not condemn Mǐ to death in Ru’s lands—\nwhat is there to praise in that?\n\nThose who attain the Dao strive to avoid great failure;\nordinary people strive for minor virtues.\nMinor virtues accumulate into many vices,\nmany vices prevent the accumulation of virtue,\nand without accumulation, misfortune follows—\nsome say many vices bring many misfortunes.\nMisfortune brings turbidity,\nturbidity brings ignorance.\nExcessive desires lead to narrowness,\nnarrowness breeds many worries,\nmany worries bring turbidity,\nturbidity brings ignorance.\nDesires and vices—\nthese are what obscure wisdom.\n\nThe powerless are shamed,\nand shame is disgrace.\nThus, Ju Xin could sever his fate,\nyet the Yan king failed to discern talent.\n\nIn ancient times, skilled warriors\nmustered armies in unison,\narrayed them according to the Five Phases,\nfought with the Five Notes,\npointed to the celestial pole,\naligned with the divine,\nand from this, all things took form—\nusing one principle without exhaustion.\nThe enlightened established the method,\nthe subtle Dao was put into practice,\nadvancing and retreating in harmony—\n*harmony* means not overstepping.\nCombining with Heaven and Earth,\nemerging from substance to touch emptiness,\n\nWu fled southeast, while General Jia Fu prepared for the northwest—clearly understanding this truth.\n\nWhen an army is about to break, its movements are swift as arrows loosed or crossbow bolts, thunderous as thunder and lightning, fierce as a collapsing wall. The soldiers grasp their weapons tightly, their stances rigid—*The Art of War* says: *\"When their grip is firm, their stance is short.\"* Their actions are unyielding, avoiding my death ground, seeking my life ground, advancing when the time is ripe, seizing opportunities—*or* lending strength to my advantages. Thus, the soldiers never falter in retreat, the army never finds itself in dire straits.\n\nHe who masters this Dao can drive even common folk like cattle, ride the current as if gliding—*or* soar with the Dao. Soaring and seizing, securing and defending—*or* preparing defenses; breathing in and out—*or* adjusting and shifting—*stillness without movement.* Aligning with the rhythm of time, one step forward, one step back, like musical notes in harmony—*or* in service. One to the right, one to the left—*the Dao knows no impossibility.*\n\nReceiving measure from Heaven, establishing position on Earth, attaining form through humanity. When the moment arrives, how can it be undone?—*or* how can its return be forced? *Return* means reversal; *stillness* means withdrawal. How can it be restrained or grasped? *Restrained* means drawn back; *grasped* means held fast. *Stillness* speaks of the ungovernable; *restraint* speaks of the unchecked.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not lean—*they shift in response to ability.* Measures interact, yin and yang contend, death and life constrain, qi and power annihilate, emptiness and substance depend on each other, gain and loss drift—*or* float indeterminately. *Floating indeterminately* means without fixed form. War is won by advantage—*The Art of War says:* *\"Like rolling a round stone down a thousand-zhang mountain, that is advantage.\"* Time does not always favor one side; early or late, one may falter while the other thrives, each generating the other’s strength. Change is boundless—how can it be fully spoken?\n\nWater struck becomes dry; an arrow struck flies farther. Spirit vibrates and thins, oscillating in turn. Slowness and speed are fated—*fated* means *halted* or *ceased.* It must strike the three ranks. *Three ranks* refers to the three divisions of an army. Gathering and dispersing, ebbing and flowing—who can know the moment?\n\nThe perfected transcends things—*or* does not cling to them—moving alone with the Dao, unrestrained, abandoning fate, coming and going with time. Rise and decline, life and death—who can know their measure? Solemn and profound, who can fathom their depth? Calamity is the reverse of fortune; fortune is the reverse of calamity. Calamity and fortune are intertwined like twisted cords. *Three strands twisted together make a cord.* Chaos and confusion—its form is singular, yet shapes dissolve and reform. Who knows their pattern?\n\nWithout form or boundary—*or* root—only the Sage can discern its intent—*or* is able to discern its intent. Flowing and shifting, it never rests. *A brief pause is called rest.* Ending leads to beginning—who knows its limit?\n\nA net with one eye cannot catch a sparrow—*too sparse.* A bird in a cage only peers out—*too dense.* The common crowd murmurs in agreement—how can they settle fortune and calamity? Joy and sorrow gather at the gate; good and ill share the same domain. *Mourners at the door while guests feast in the hall.* Loss becomes gain; success becomes failure.\n\nWu had mighty armies and strong forces—yet King Fu Zhi was brought low. Yue took refuge in Kuaiji—yet King Gou Jian became a hegemon. The enlightened observer sees the truth. *Truth* or *harshness.* A single technique—how can it suffice for roaming?\n\n*Elliptical and square*—what use are they for adaptability? *Elliptical* is read like *Sui Dù’s* \"Sui\"; *square* like *Fāng Biàn’s* \"Fāng.\" The affairs of the world demand a hundred responses, each varying to meet a hundred changes. Yet now, clinging to one technique—how can it suffice in the realm of adaptability?\n\nFrom ancient times to now, what event lacks its counterpart? *Counterpart* means *a station for relaying messages.* Travelers pass through it without pause; thus, past events are called *counterparts.* Shun had unfilial conduct; Yao lacked tenderness. King Wen was bound in chains; Guan Zhong was imprisoned. Towering and vast—*or* buried in clouds—who can grasp it?\n\nThis speaks of the Great Pivot dispersing things—towering and vast without boundary, all within the *Lǔ* vessel—who can grasp it? The perfected has no partiality, drifting like an untethered boat—*simply yielding.* The capable are saved; the incapable are destroyed. Heaven cannot be schemed with; Earth cannot be plotted against. The Sage abandons things, follows nature, and lets go.\n\nThe common crowd is confined—*confined* means *narrow and shallow*—pressured by desires. The slightly wise rush to act, fearing good and evil. The arrogant die by their power, boasting in self-importance—*or* spending their lives scheming for fame. *One version omits:* \"The scholar pursues fame; the greedy man pursues wealth. To chase after things with one’s body is called *serving* them.\"\n\nThe most expansive lacks sufficiency—*or* is bound. Governing without a key, even vastness becomes insufficient. Why? The Supreme Dao is ever concise.\n\nThe wise know time—what shame is there in that?\nThey feel no guilt, yet do nothing wrong.\nThe unworthy are bound by convention—*or, as one version reads, \"enveloped by custom\"*—\nwhile the virtuous vie for influence in their age.\nKnowledge is but the tool of contention.\nFame is but the clash of reputations.\n*One version reads \"clings to trifles,\" another \"clings to the vulgar,\"*\nand yet another, *\"clings to petty matters\"*—*both versions imply \"like a bitter herb or thorn.\"*\n\nWhat need is there to doubt?\nWhen deeds are done and rewards sought, what need is there to boast?\nThis speaks of harmony with the Way and its opposite—\nthere is no cause for joy or sorrow.\n\nThousands of words and ten thousand arguments—\nin the end, what praise is given?\nThis means that reason is fully exhausted above,\nyet even if their verbose arguments pile up to thousands or ten thousands,\nstill they must be judged by this.\n\nGōu Jiàn lacked office,\nGōu Jiàn once served as a subject to Wú.\nTwo kingdoms remained unsettled;\nWén Wáng lacked confinement,\n*yet he was confined in Měilǐ*.\nWǔ Wáng lacked rectitude—*or, as one version reads, \"did not hold to rectitude\"*—\nGuān Zhòng suffered no humiliation,\nyet his name was not equated with the great virtuous,\nand his deeds were not compared to the Three Sovereigns#16.\nThe *tāng* face is complete.\n\n*Complete knowledge is the thirteenth chapter.*\nHeaven is vast yet can be known,\nEarth is great yet can be governed.\nHow can all things be at ease?\nHow can human nature be without taking?\nBó Yí and Shū Qí could prevent theft,\nyet they could not stop people from harboring intentions against themselves.\n*Can one be certain of meeting only adversity?*\nShēn Tú Dì.\n\nThe decline of the Yin dynasty was marked by withering and decay.\nHe deemed the world’s corruption too deep to endure,\nso he bore a stone and cast himself into the river—\nyet he failed to see that the chaos beneath was even worse.\n\nWhen virtue flourished,\nmountains lacked paths, marshes lacked bridges—\nno travel between them, no passage by boat or cart.\nWhy?\nBecause its people remained as pure as infants.\n*As Laozi says:*\n*\"Thick with virtue, like an infant.\"*\nMales were called *chīzǐ*, females *yīng’ér*.\nThe wise did not deceive or enslave one another,\nthe strong did not lord over others as rulers.\nThus, the nests of crows and magpies could be glimpsed from below,\nand the timid deer and startled elk could be easily captured.\n*Crows and magpies are naturally suspicious,*\n*deer and elk are naturally skittish*—\nthis explains the saying.\n\nYet when the age declined,\nfathers plotted against sons, brothers doubted brothers.\nFathers and sons are by nature,\nbrothers by kinship—\ntrust and sincerity were innate, not imposed from without.\nThus, even when striking a stranger’s foot, one would feign stumbling,\nand when striking a brother’s, one would feign hitting an old woman—\nsuch was the extent of their kinship.\nBut when virtue waned to the point where fathers and sons became rivals,\nbrothers turned against one another—\nwas this because their nature had fundamentally changed from antiquity?\nNo, it was the fault of governance.\nFor when cultivation grew shallow and reliance on artificial means took hold,\nthey could not coexist without strife,\nnor act without scheming—\nand so their ruin reached this point.\n\nGuo Xiang remarked:\n*\"Those who embody Heaven and Earth, who subtly transform without effort—\nthough hands and feet have distinct roles,\nand the five viscera govern differently,\nthey never conspire to disrupt harmony,\nyet all limbs move in unison—\nthis is to coexist without contrivance.\nThey never scheme to aid one another,\nyet the outer and inner both thrive—\nthis is to act without scheming.\nBut if one forces the mind to labor for the limbs,\nor strains the arms to nourish the viscera,\nthen the more they strive, the more exhausted they become within and without.\nThis is the truth.\"*\n\nThus, those who *do* bring ruin,\nthose who *govern* bring chaos.\nChaos leads to factionalism—*fǎn*—\nfactionalism leads to flattery—*ē*—\nflattery undermines principle,\nand servility erodes righteousness.\n\nWhen Yao passed the Mandate to Shun,\nthe virtuous saw it as Yao’s wisdom,\nbut the self-interested saw it as folly.\nTang and Wu abandoned their sons for profit—\nthe virtuous condemned them as unprincipled.\n*But why?*\nIf my teachings are correct,\nthen only the virtuous would deem them righteous,\nwhile the self-interested would call them wise.\n*For* in that age, the worthy were not transmitted,\nso there were exiled rulers.\nWhen rulers favored factionalism and flattery,\nthere were regicides.\nWhere exiles and regicides struck,\nthere the state perished—\nI have never seen one who, seeing the danger,\nfound comfort in false security,\nor, clinging to sorrow, diminished joy.\n\nThus, states could face mourning without ritual,\nwarfare without soldiers—\nsuch outcomes could be foreseen.\n\nHence, Ji Zi fled—\n*not to escape, but to avert calamity.*\nConfucius said:\n*\"Miczi departed, Ji Zi became his slave.\"*\nYet there was also *Bóqiú Mù*—\n*as the Song Genealogy records:*\n*\"Nan Gong Wan slew Duke Min at Mengze Marsh.\nThe minister Bóqiú Mù, hearing of it,\nled soldiers to the duke’s gate.\nWan attacked Mù, who died with his teeth lodged in the door.\"*\nThis was the reality.\n\nShang Rong was imprisoned,\nand Shěn Shù wept.\n\nShěn Shù was a subject of Qin. When Duke Mu of Qin attacked Zheng, Shěn Shù wept for it.\n\nIn ancient times, those who climbed high places—\nwhen others below took their place,\nsome wrote *yù* (殪), meaning *fright* (怖).\nThe hands and feet would sweat from fear,\nand those above, though trembling, knew no dread,\nyet only then would they clutch and break branches,\nhasten and grasp wood.\n\nTo stop them was to suffer mutilation,\nand those who tried to halt them—\nthey themselves bore the punishment.\n\nAll this illustrates those in peril who forget security,\nwhile advisors suffer disgrace.\n\nThus, the world grows cold-hearted,\nand rulers stand alone.\n\nNowadays, those in precarious positions are all traitors—\ntheir wit suffices to mislead their lords,\ntheir words to undermine governance,\ntheir factions to nurture mutual gain and harm.\n\nIn the past, Tang used Yi Yin,\nZhou used Tai Gong,\nQin used Bai Li—Bai Li Delin.\nChu used Shen Bao Xu,\nQi used Guan Zhong.\n\nThese great ministers—\nby whom the age was elevated—\nwere all loyal subjects of ruined states,\nwho died for them.\n\nThis shows that ancient talents were equal:\nsome rose to prominence,\nothers died—\nit depended on the ruler they encountered.\n\nTo observe this:\nit was not their wisdom or ability that failed,\nbut the fate of their times that could not be reached.\n\nThis speaks of the talents of Yi, Lü, Shen, and Guan—\nno one was beyond their reach—\nyet Ji Zi and Bóqiú Mù met with death and humiliation,\nfor they lacked the right fate.\n\nOnly thus—\nonly thus—\nwas their fate denied.\n\nWhen the **Way** reaches its moment, one may **seek**—\nor act as **Yuan**,\nor as **Biao**.\n\nWhen there is a ruler but no minister,\neven when the **Way** reaches its moment,\nthe minister **seeks** from above.\n\nWhen the **Way** reaches its moment, one may **withdraw**—\nwhen there is a minister but no ruler,\neven when the **Way** reaches its moment,\nthe minister **withdraws** below.\n\nWhen **fate** reaches its moment, one may **close**—\nor act as **He**.\n\n*Close* is like *withdraw*.\nWhen **fate** reaches its moment, one may **open**—\nor act as *Que*.\n*Open* is like *seek*.\n\nThe virtuous do not necessarily meet their time,\nthe unvirtuous do not necessarily lose their fate—\nthus, the virtuous **guard the Way**,\nwhile the unvirtuous **guard fate**.\n*Guard fate* is like *entrusting to fate*.\n\nIn this age, there are those with Shun’s conduct,\nyet they do not know the reason for Yao’s rise;\nthere are those with Tang and Wu’s deeds,\nyet they do not know the reason for Yi Yin and Tai Gong’s rise.\n\nFei Zhong and E Lai gained from Xin Zhe’s favor,\nyet they did not know that Wu Wang would conquer him;\nJi Gan and Wu Zixu loved loyal admonition,\nyet they did not know their lords would kill them.\n\nFei Zhong and E Lai could be said to know the heart,\nyet they did not know the circumstances;\nJi Gan and Wu Zixu could be said to know the circumstances,\nyet they did not know the heart.\n\nThe sage must possess both—\nonly then can they master an age.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fourteen: On Warfare**\n\nPangzi asked Lüguanzi:\n*\"The laws of warfare—\nheaven’s, earth’s, and humanity’s—\nreward to encourage battle,\npunish to ensure the multitude.\nSome say ‘terrify the multitude.’\n\nWhen these five are applied,\nyet the Nine Barbarians use them and victory is not certain—\nwhy is this so?\n\nThey have obtained the battle,\nbut not the reason for battle—\nthus, the Nine Barbarians use them and victory is not certain.*\n\nAs the saying goes:\n*'One who drives a chariot by the book\ndoes not fully grasp the horse’s nature.'*\n\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThus it is said:\n*'When the master gallops, the horse gallops;\nwhen the master trots, the horse trots;\nwhen the master races and leaves dust behind,\nthe horse gazes back in bewilderment.'*\n\nIs this not so?\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*'Things have their nature—\n*nature*, like *transformation*.\nThus, before they are used, metal, wood, water, and fire restrain one another.\nThis is called *prevailing before the appointed time*.*\n\nHave you not seen the gate?\nIf you stand and lean against it,\neven a woman can lift it.\nIf you kneel and place it,\nit can be raised without regard to strength.\nIf you grasp its handle,\neven a chosen warrior cannot sever the ground.\n\nThough the gate is but one body,\nits weight differs by how it is held—\nthis is because the method determines it.\n\nSpeaking of the gate,\nits nature is in the hand that holds it.\nThe Nine Barbarians use it and victory is not certain—\nbecause they do not grasp the nature of things.\n\nAs the *Su Wen* says:\n*'The generation of things is called transformation,\ntheir extreme is called change.'*\n\nIf one grasps the generation of things,\nthe five become one.\n\nPangzi said:\n*'How can the five become one?'*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*'Heaven cannot make early into late,\nearth cannot make high into low,\nhumanity cannot make male into female,\nrewards cannot encourage the unworthy—\ngold and silk before them cannot make the aged carry them,\npunishments cannot ensure the guilty—\naxes and blades behind them cannot make the mute speak.*\n\nPangzi said:\n*'How then does one achieve success?'*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*'Heaven cannot command humanity,\nhumanity cannot command heaven.\nFollow the nature of things,\nand success or ruin lies within.\nThis is the second principle—\nit lies in *authority* and *control*.\n\nIt lies in authority, so wealth may exceed abundance;\nit lies in control, so warfare may exceed victory.\nThe generation of wealth\ndepends on strength upon the earth,\nharmony with heaven;\nvictory in war\ndepends on harmony with the **Way**,\nunity with humanity.\n\nThose who do not know this\ntake disorder for harmony,\ndisaster for advantage.\nTaking disorder for harmony,\ntheir wealth becomes poverty;\ntaking disaster for advantage,\ntheir armies are captured.\n\nIn the past, those who knew the times\nharmonized with the **Way**,\nor *clarified* it.\nThose who did not know it\nendangered their spirit and clarity.\nWhen the **Way** is lost,\nor *oppressed*,\nand spirit and clarity are ruined—\nwhat can stay the wound?\n*Stay* means to halt its spread.\n\nThus it is said:\n*'Oh **Way**, oh **Way**—\npreserve spirit and clarity together.'*\n\nPangzi said:\n*'How does one preserve them together?'*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*The virtuous generate the sage,\nthe virtuous above generate the sage.\nThe sage generates the **Way**,\nthe **Way** generates law,\nlaw generates spirit,\none yin and one yang—this is the **Way**.\nTo regulate and apply it is called *law*.\nIts beneficial use in entering and exiting,\nall people employing it—this is *spirit*.\nSpirit generates clarity.\nSpirit below generates clarity.\nSpirit and clarity—\nthis is the end of *rectification*.\nPartiality generates unity,\npublicness generates clarity,\nsincerity and trust generate spirit.\nThus it is said: *This is the end of rectification.*\nThe end may have no end—\nthus, they preserve each other.*\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifteen: On Learning**\n\nPangzi asked Lüguanzi:\n*\"When the sage studies under a teacher,\ndoes he have a beginning and end?\nOr does he merely collect and recite,\nclosing the coffin and stopping there?\"*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*\"The beginning is in the first question,\nthe end is in the Nine **Paths**.\nIf one does not hear the resolution of the Nine **Paths**,\nmerely collecting and reciting,\nclosing the coffin and stopping—\nhow can one be certain?\n\nThis is not just about white and black confusion—\neven when the coffin is closed and study ends,\nit is still insufficient to determine truth.\n\nThus, what is precious in studying\nis not merely reciting words—\nit lies in grasping the body of the text,\nunderstanding the meaning of speech.\"*\n\nPangzi said:\n*\"What are the Nine **Paths**?\"*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*\"First, **Dao** and virtue;\nsecond, yin and yang;\nthird, laws and orders;\nfourth, celestial officials;\nfifth, divine omens;\nsixth, arts and skills;\nseventh, human nature;\neighth, tools and instruments;\nninth, military strategy.\"*\n\nPangzi said:\n*\"I wish to hear of the Nine **Paths**.\"*\n\nLüguanzi said:\n*\"**Dao** and virtue are the conduct and principles by which one cultivates a foundation—\nthe foundation as clear as the offering of unblemished silk.\n**Dao** and virtue are the root of conduct,\nthus they are called the foundation.\n\nYin and yang are the divisions and harmonies\nby which one observes the changes of **qi**.\nThe *Zhou Officials* states: ‘The Preserver of Chapters [observes] by stars and soil,\nby clouds and phenomena,\nby the twelve years and twelve winds,\nto foretell the calamities and auspices of Heaven and Earth.’\nLaws and orders are the means by which one governs **Dao**, restraining chaos and maintaining order—\nthe lifeblood of the state.\nCelestial officials are the signs and portents of ritual propriety,\nthe responses of the people below.\nThis is the order of learning.\n\nWhen **Dao** and virtue are made clear, then yin and yang follow,\nand when yin and yang are made clear, then laws and orders follow;\nonce these three are complete,\nonly then can one speak of governance.\n\nCelestial officials refer to the Grand Steward [冢宰].\nAll officials derive their measures from him,\nthus they are called ‘signs of ritual propriety.’\nHe initiates the beginning,\nthus they are called ‘auspicious portents.’\nFor he governs with stillness while others respond with action,\nthus they are called ‘the people’s response.’\n\nDivine omens are the majestic presence and radiant aura\nby which one categorizes the extraordinary.\nAs the *Rites of Sacrifice* says:\n‘When their **qi** ascends and shines above,\nit becomes the manifest brilliance of *Zhaomíng* [昭明],\nthe sorrowful lament of *Zhúhāo* [煮蒿],\na chilling desolation.’\nThis is the essence of all things,\nthe manifestation of the divine.\n\nArts and skills are like the *Shèngtóng Rèn* [胜同任]—\nsome dwell in harmony, others in distinction.\nThey reveal what is singular and unique without repetition.\nThe *Zhou Officials* states:\n‘The Six Virtues distinguish by wisdom, benevolence, sagacity, righteousness, loyalty, and harmony,\nwhile the Six Arts harmonize by ritual, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics.’\n\nHuman nature is the vast array of small and great,\nfoolish and wise,\nvirtuous and unworthy,\nheroic and brilliant—\nall the myriad dispositions of the people.\n\nTools and instruments are aids for travel—\nsome serve as carriages, others as steeds.\nThey are the implements the world uses and the state must possess.\n\nMilitary strategy is the grasp of power and authority,\nthe establishment of an unassailable position—\nor the seizing of advantageous ground.\nThe Nine **Paths** embody the mind,\nand when embodied, they are said to have spirit.\n*Form* [形] is the visible manifestation.\nLater, one can perceive changes and name them,\nfor when things arrive, one can name them.\n\nSome say: ‘The strange and the unusual are called changes.’\nThe *Liezi* states:\n‘Great Yu acted upon them and saw them,\nwhile Bo Yi understood them and named them.’\nThis is of the same kind.\nOne follows what they do to determine them.\"*\n\n「If the heart lacks *form* [形] and spirit, it may be called *emptiness* [虚].\nWords may have a *transmission* [传] character, though they are *lofted and bound* [抟捆],\nbinding, akin to knocking with a mallet—\nyet one does not know where they lead.\n\nThat heart is the sovereign—\nwhen it *reaches* [至], it commands the inner to govern the outer.\nWithin, there is no *subtlety* [巧] or *verification* [验]:\nits essence is insufficient to *measure* the Dao/Way [揆道],\nits coarseness is insufficient to *verify* things [验物].\nClose, it does not suffice; far, it does not arrive.\n\n**Pangzi** said: *“There are those who have heard of ‘once’* [曾闻].\n*Rite* [礼], *music* [乐], *benevolence* [仁], *rightness* [义], *loyalty* [忠], *trustworthiness* [信]—\nI wish to hear how these harmonize with *numbers* [数].”*\n\n**Lǔ Guānzi** said:\n*“What is called *rite* [礼] is that which does not transgress.\nWhat is called *music* [乐] is that which causes no *harm* [菑] (or *weeds* [蔷]).\nWhat is called *benevolence* [仁] is that which unites in shared good.\nWhat is called *rightness* [义] is that which unites in shared evil.\nWhat is called *loyalty* [忠] is that which, though long healed, remains close.\nWhat is called *trustworthiness* [信] is that which does not produce *dual echoes* [二响].”\n\nThe Sage employs these six principles—\nthough they may seem *unsubstantial* [无者],\nthey are the *divinatory patterns* [卦] (akin to *divination* [卜])\nthat govern the world’s gains and losses, obedience and rebellion.\n\nTo stray from the Dao/Way [道] is not *numbers* [数];\none cannot thus *unravel the threads of fate* [□□绪端].\nTo disregard the *original principles* [元法],\none cannot grasp the *heart’s essence* [心体].\nThe *sacrificial knife* [刽] (akin to *carving* [郀])\n*—the* *Nán Huá* [《南华》] says—\n“discards its limbs, exiles its wisdom.\nIt also says:\n‘The Dao/Way [道] encompasses and sustains heaven and earth;\nthe gentleman cannot fail to *carve* [刳] his heart to align with it.’\n\nThough *superficial* [浅] yet *unexhausted* [不穷],\nthough *vast* [博] yet *hollow* [虚]—\nPangzi bowed twice and said:\n*“There is a question of admonition here.\nThough not such as this, if one lacks *material* [材] yet remains *vigorous* [健],\nwho can *learn* [学]? What can *become* [能]?\nThis is the Dao/Way [道] of the world,\nyet rulers abandon it—why?’”*\n\n**Lǔ Guānzi** said:\n*“To be *unworthy* [贱] arises from being *unused* [弗器];\n*instruments* [器] are thus *elevated* [提].\nTo be *lowly* [贱] arises from having *no purpose* [无所用].\nA lost boat in the mid-river [中河失船]#24,\na gourd [壶] worth a thousand gold pieces.\nThe gourd, *bottle gourd* [瓠], worn as an ornament,\ncan ferry one across.\nSoutherners call it a *waist-boat* [腰舟].\nNobility and lowliness are not fixed;\ntime dictates their nature.\n\nTo *know* [知] the good as good,\nthe bright and the obscure are unchanging,\none *measurement* [揆] suffices until today.\nTo *not know* [不知] the good as good,\nthus there are *death of the body* [身死] and *ruin of the state* [国亡],\n*extinction of sacrifices* [绝祀] and *obliteration of lineage* [灭宗].\nEven the *common folk* [细人] struggle to preserve life,\nhow much more so for the *ruler* [义]?\nThis is said of the common folk,\nyet how much more applies to the ruler himself?\nIts meaning should be *self-reflected* [自况].”\n\n**Chapter Sixteen of the World’s Worthies [世贤]**\n**Zhuō Xiāng Wáng** (should be *Dào* [悼]) asked **Páng Nuǎn**:\n*“Does the ruler of men also act for his state?”*\n(Zhuō should be *Dào*—this is **Zhào Dào Xiāng Wáng** [赵悼襄王].)\nWhen **Zhào Xiào Chéng Wáng** [赵孝成王] passed away,\nhis son **Yǎn** [偃] ascended the throne,\nthus becoming the **Dào Xiāng Wáng** [悼襄王].\nIn the third year of his reign,\n**Páng Nuǎn** prepared to attack **Yàn** [燕],\ncapturing its general **Jù Xīn** [剧辛].\n\n**Páng Nuǎn** said:\n*“Does the King not hear of **Yú Tū** [俞跗] as a physician?\nOnce the disease is formed, it must be treated;\neven spirits and gods avoid it.\nThe **Chǔ Wáng** [楚王] sat upon the throne,\nyet because of the **Suí** [随] soldiers,\nhe waited until night when the illness [□] was upon his body,\nand then he *must* have **Yú Tū** [俞跗].\n**Yú Tū**, it seems, was not a **Chǔ** [楚] man—\nthis is also an allegory.\n\nThe *transmission* [传] says:\n‘In the upper antiquity,\nthere was a physician named **Yú Tū** [俞跗],\nwho treated diseases not with decoctions, *medicated wine* [体酒],\n*appetizing stones* [馋石], *muscle-twisting* [蹻引],\n*pressing peaches* [案桃], or *poisonous moxibustion* [毒熨],\nbut by cutting skin and severing flesh,\nresolving muscle and tendon knots,\nextracting marrow and brain,\ncleansing the intestines and stomach,\nrefining the *essence* [精] and transforming the *form* [形].\nThough already formed, the disease *must* be treated,\nand even spirits and gods avoid it.’\n\n**Dào Xiāng Wáng** [悼襄王] said:\n*“Well said.”*\n\nPáng Nuǎn said: *“Your Majesty, have you forgotten?*\nIn the past, **Yí Yǔ** [伊尹] was the physician of **Yīn** [殷],\n**Tài Gōng** [太公] was the physician of **Zhōu Wǔ Wáng** [周武王],\n**Bǎi Lǐ** [百里] was the physician of **Qín** [秦],\n**Shēn Jū** [申麃] was the physician of **Yǐng** [郢]—\n**Yǐng**, the capital of **Jīng** [荆].\n**Yuán Jì** [原季] was the physician of **Jìn** [晋];\nthe *Guó Yǔ* [《国语》] says:\n‘**Jìn Wén Gōng** [晋文公] appointed **Yuán Jì** as his minister.’\n\n**Fàn Lì** [范蠡] was the physician of **Yuè** [越],\n**Guǎn Zhòng** [管仲] was the physician of **Qí** [齐],\nand thus the five states became hegemon.\nTheir skill was the same,\nyet their **Dào** [道] differed in method.\n\n**Zhuó Xiāng Wáng** [卓襄王] said:\n*“I wish to hear of these methods.”*\n\nPáng Nuǎn replied:\n*“Has Your Majesty not heard of **Wèi Wén Hóu** [魏文侯] questioning **Biàn Que** [扁鹊]?\n**Biàn Que**, a man from **Bó Hǎi** [勃海] with the surname **Qín** [秦],\nnamed **Yuè Rén** [越人], said:\n‘My elder brother is the best physician,\nmy middle brother is second,\nand I am the least skilled.’\n\n**Wèi Wén Hóu** asked:\n‘May I hear more?’\n\n**Biàn Que** replied:\n‘My eldest brother treats illness by observing the **shén** [神],\nremoving it before it takes form—\nthis is the **shén yī** [神医], acting before disease manifests.\nThe *Zhōu Guān* [《周官》] says:\n‘The physician of illness examines the five **qì** [气],\nthe five **shēng** [声], and the five **sè** [色] to determine life and death,\ncross-verifying with the nine **jiǎo** [窍] and the nine **zàng** [藏].\nBut one who is blind to the **shén**,\nyet relies on the five **qì**, five **shēng**, and five **sè**,\nand further cross-verifies with the nine **jiǎo** and nine **zàng**—\nthis is already crude.\nYet the *Zhōu Guān* speaks only of this,\nfor it is the method of the mediocre.\n**Qí** [歧] and **Fù** [附]—could such masters truly exist in the world?\nThus their names do not leave their families;\ntheir fame remains within their gates.’\n\nMy middle brother treats illness at the level of **háo máo** [毫毛],\nthis is the **míng yī** [明医], treating it before disorder spreads—\nwhat is called *recognizing form and awakening*.\nThus his name does not leave the neighborhood;\nhis fame is known only to his neighbors.\n\nAs for me, **Biàn Que**,\nI probe the blood vessels,\nadminister toxic medicines,\nand treat between the muscles and skin—\nthus my name is heard by the feudal lords.\nMy cures are crude,\nand my fame spreads far.\n\n**Wèi Wén Hóu** said: *“Well said.”*\nHe then asked:\n‘If **Guǎn Zhòng** [管子] practiced medicine with **Biàn Que**’s methods,\ncould **Huán Gōng** [桓公] have achieved his hegemony?’\n\n**Guǎn Zhòng** rescued **Huán Gōng**,\noften acting subtly—\nthus he could make his lord a hegemon.\n**Huán Gōng** truly grew angry at **Shǎo Jī** [少姬],\nand launched a southern raid on **Cài** [蔡].\n**Guǎn Zhòng** then attacked **Chǔ** [楚],\naccusing it of failing to pay tribute to the **Zhōu** court.\n**Huán Gōng** truly led a northern campaign against the **Shān Róng** [山戎],\nwhile **Guǎn Zhòng** used the opportunity to command **Yàn** [燕]\nto restore the policies of **Chào Gōng** [召公].\nAt that time, no other feudal lord knew of this.\nThis was his treatment at the level of **háo máo**.\n\nAll these were cases of *not treating illness as illness*—\nsome say *not treating what is not yet illness*.\nBut when illness is already severe, is it not too late?\nSevere illness is called *illness*.\nTo treat it without a name—\nsome say *to treat the nameless as if it were formless*—\nonce the form and name of the illness are manifest,\nthen the physician is summoned—\nthis is why **Huán Gōng** died.\n\nAs for the ultimate achievement—\nsome say *the six extremes*—\nthe efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion has no basis for pride,\nso the ignorant call it *natural*.\nExtending this to governance,\nthis is why the *strike-the-soil* people [common folk]\ndo not recognize the efforts of **Yáo** [尧] and **Shùn** [舜].\n\nThus, the skilled physician transforms [disease],\nwhile the incompetent ruins [the patient].\nEven if by chance they do not die,\ntheir limbs are crippled and their sinews stretched.\n*Sinews* refers to the **jiān lěi** [牵孪, tendons].\n\n**Zhuó Xiāng Wáng** said: *“Well said.”*\n*“Though I cannot avoid injury,\nwho could inflict more than a hair’s breadth upon me?\nPerhaps **Guǎn Zhòng** will emerge from among my subjects.”*\n\n---\n**Tiān Quán** [天权] **Chapter Seventeen**\nTo *lift heaven and earth* and yet be unable—\n*[This refers to those who]*\nlike the *Nán Huá* [《南华》] says, *“flanking the sun and moon,\nembracing the cosmos”*—\nthis is the kind described here.\nIt is called *returning* [还]—\nor *circulating* [绎].\nThose who do not return to the **míng** [名] are called **Cháng Zhù** [常住],\ndwelling eternally in the true **jì** [际] without being ensnared by **míng** [名].\nThose who chase externals and lose themselves,\never burdened by **zào huà** [造化],\nhow could they lift heaven and earth and wander freely?\nEven if their **míng zhào** [明照] is bright as the moon,\ntheir **guāng zhào** [光照] radiant as the sun,\nthey cannot illuminate their own **míng** [明].\n**Lí Zhū** [离朱], even in broad daylight, could wipe his eyes\nand see the hairs on a man’s face a hundred paces away,\nyet he could not clearly see his own **jié** [睫].\nThus, those who chase externals and fail to return to their own **líng** [灵],\neven with brilliance like the moon and radiance like the sun,\nhow could they illuminate their own **míng**?\nTo **dú huà** [独化] the beginning and end,\nto **suí néng xù zhì** [随能序致],\n*—**zhì** [致] may also be read as **gù** [故]—*\nto stand alone in the cosmos without bounds,\nthis is called **Huáng Tiān Dì** [皇天地].\n*Without bounds* means without territorial limits.\n**Gé** [革] says:\n*“Beyond the four seas, without end or limit,\nit is still like **Qí Zhōu** [齐州].\nTravel east to **Yíng** [营], and the people are the same;\nask about the east of **Yíng**, and it is still **Yíng**.\nTravel west to **Yōu** [幽], and the people are the same;\nask about the west of **Yōu**, and it is still **Yōu**.”\n\nFloating and suspended is the **míng** of heaven and earth,\nthe rotation of the four seasons,\nthe shifting of the sun and moon—\n**yì** [埶] as if floating and suspended.\n**Wěi mìng xiàng lí** [委命相鬲] is called **shí** [时].\n**Qǐ rán wú jiàn** [且然无间] is called **mìng** [命].\nThe four seasons’ rotation is entrusted to **shí** [时].\nYet wood spreads, metal contracts, fire blazes, water chills—\nlike the ear, eye, nose, and mouth,\neach has its function, yet they cannot communicate.\nIf they communicate and **lì** [鬲], this is called **Dào** [道].\nThus **Dào** has what is **sè** [塞] and what is **tōng** [通].\nIt connects all things,\nleads heaven and earth—\nheaven and earth below have **jiàn bào** [建报].\n*—**Shè bèi** [搏] may also be read as **yǔ zhòu** [宇宙].*\n**Tóng gēn** [同根], called **yǔ zhòu** [宇宙].\n*Closing heaven* is called **yǔ** [宇],\n*opening heaven* is called **zhòu** [宙].\nThe two rely on each other to stand,\nthus they are called **hé shè tóng gēn** [合搏同根].\nKnowing **yǔ** [宇], thus there is nothing it does not contain—\nit has substance yet no fixed place—this is **yǔ** [宇].\nKnowing **yǔ**, thus there is nothing it does not contain.\nKnowing **zhòu** [宙], thus there is nothing it lacks—\nit has duration yet no origin—this is **zhòu** [宙].\nKnowing **zhòu**, thus there is nothing it lacks.”\n\n「Knowing **virtue/power** [德], **virtue/power** may also be written as **yǐn** [隐].\nThus there is nothing it does not harmonize with—\nknowing **virtue/power**, thus all it encounters upon the earth,\nit does not choose yet finds rest.\nKnowing the **Dao/Way** [道], thus there is nothing it does not obey—\nknowing the **Dao/Way**, thus all it receives from heaven,\nit does not decline yet listens to it.\nKnowing **things** [物], thus there is nothing it does not conform to—\nit follows their natural state, and thus all things cannot but conform to it.\nKnowing **unity** [一] yet not knowing the **Dao/Way**, thus it has not yet been fully embraced—\nit cannot perceive its own clarity, hence it is said not yet to have been fully embraced.\nIn the past, one who traveled without knowing where to go,\nif they sought it, they would certainly be confused.\nThe lost sheep of old was said:\n*\"Within the fork, there is another fork—\nI do not know where to go,\nthus I return.\"*\n\n**Dōu Zǐ** [都子] said:\n*\"The **Great Dao/Way** [大道] is lost through its many forks,\nthe scholar is lost through their many paths.\nTo seek what one does not know\nand inquire of **symbols** [象] is certain not to find it.\n**Symbols** are the **trap and snare** [筌蹄] of the mind.\nIf one seeks what they do not know\nby examining the **trap and snare**,\nyet does not seek it beyond **words and meanings** [言意],\nhow can they attain its essence?\"*\n\nThe **wheelwright** [轮人] said:\n*\"What you study\nare the dregs and refuse of the ancients.\nAfter tracing the meaning of **Hùguān Zǐ** [鹖冠子],\nit is to dispel ignorance and confusion,\nto guide people toward **unity** [致一]\nand seek the **Dao/Way** beyond **words and meanings**,\nthus there is this saying.\nTherefore, people are all obscured by what they cannot see,\n**lì** [鬲] by what they cannot hear,\n**sè** [塞] by what they cannot open,\n**qū** [诎] by what

form—\nthough perilous moments may not yet appear,\nthe principle is already present.\nThus it is said:\n*'There are armies without soldiers,\nthere are mourning without garments'*—\nthis is the reason people lightly regard death and life,\nthis is the reason people lightly regard safety and danger.\nBecause of this, they know it.\n\nThe mosquito and fly fall into a thousand-**rèn** [仞] deep ravine—\na ravine is called **gǔ** [谷].\nThen they begin to soar and attain their **container** [容]—\n*container* may also be read as **guest** [客].\nThey attain the **soaring and gliding** [翱翔] of

may also be read as **bowl** [钵].\nYet they have no **container**.\nFrom this observation,\nit is clear that the great are not harmed,\nwhile the heavy suffer deep wounds.\nThis speaks of the **stumbling of the exalted** [贵高之蹶],\nwhose misfortune is great.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"How can the lord of ten-thousand chariots\nlightly regard the world with his own body?\"*\n\nWarfare is to venture death for life,\nto confront peril for safety.\nThus, **words** [言] are true,\nand the **Dao/Way** is fitting—\n*fitting* may also be read as **rich** [富].\nThe **Dao/Way** is fitting, or it may be read as **\"the Dao/Way establishes richness\"** [道奠富].\n**Words** are true,\nthen the **Dao/Way** is fitting.\nThe **Dao/Way** is like **action** [行].\nThus, a single gnat biting the skin\nkeeps one from sleeping till dawn;\nhalf a grain of husk entering the eye\nleaves one unable to govern the four quarters.\n\nWhat is called **obscured** [蔽],\ndoes it necessarily mean to be blocked by curtains and screens,\nor concealed by **fine** [□] and **coarse** [薄] fabrics?\nTo see **uniformity** [周平] yet not perceive it is called **obscured**.\nIn the past, a man of **Qí** [齐] desired gold—\nat dawn, in the market,\nhe snatched another’s gold,\nthinking that the time for taking gold\nwas when only gold was seen,\nnot people.\nThis shows how **greed** [嗜欲] can so disturb the mind.\nDoes it necessarily mean that one is blocked by objects on all sides?\n\nThus, when afflicted with poor vision,\nthe eyes do not see;\nwhen afflicted with poor hearing,\nthe ears do not hear.\n**Ignorance** [蒙]—\nsometimes without the word *ignorance*—\nthus one knows that they can exhaust all heard and seen.\n*—end of sentence.*\n**Lì** [鬲] may also be read as **gāo** [高].」\n\nThus, when one’s **foundations** [奠] are established, all actions and their **inherent powers** [任力] come to an end—\n*—end of sentence.*\n**Obstruction** [塞]—\nthe four directions [四发] are **unified** [上统] and **unified** [上统], sometimes read as **unified** [上纥], yet they do not **continue** [续], and **vague** [□□] things **fade away** [消亡].\n\nThe **Dao/Way** [道], when it comes,\nmust first have its **response** [应], and only then does it arrive—\n*—end of sentence.*\n**Response** [至], sometimes read as **harmonize** [合至].\n\nIt is **manifest** [易] in the *Book of Changes* [观之於易].\n\n**Actions** [事], when they are **accomplished** [成],\nmust first have **virtue/power** [德], and only then can they be **fulfilled** [成].\n**Virtue/power** [德]—\none knows what **actions** [事] can be **fulfilled** [成] and what **virtue/power** [德] can be **obtained** [得] from them,\nand only then does one say, *\"I can fulfill this\"* [我能成之].\n\n**Fulfillment without effort** [成无为],\nis **fulfillment** [成] in **non-action** [无为].\n**Obtaining without source** [得无来],\nis **obtaining** [得] from **non-source** [无来].\n\nWhen **virtue/power** [德] is **complete** [至],\nthen the **subtle** [妙] must be understood by the **heart** [心解],\nand yet the **sovereign** [君] cannot **obtain** [得] it from his **subjects** [臣],\nnor the **son** [子] can **offer** [献] it to his **father** [父],\nthen **obtaining** [得] it lies within oneself alone—\nits **source** [来] is not from anywhere else, is it?\n\n**Examine** [详详], sometimes read as **discern** [辟#29].\n\n**Examine** [察] its **Dao/Way** [道],\nhow could it be like this?\n\n**Lost** [迷] in the past, yet **observing** [往] the present,\nthis is why one knows that they have not yet **fulfilled** [能] it.\n\nThose who **erect** [立] a **standard** [表] and **observe** [望] do not **err** [惑],\nthose who **follow** [按] the **method** [法] and **cut** [割] do not **doubt** [疑],\nfor it is said that there is something to **aspire to** [希].\n\n**Observing** [望] without a **standard** [表],\n**cutting** [割] without a **method** [法],\nis this not the realm of **erroneous confusion** [惑]?\n\n**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—\nit is not because there is no **brightness** [明] of the sun and moon,\nno **order** [序] of the four seasons,\nno **movement** [行] of stars and constellations—\nbut because one **inverts** [反] these things and **confuses** [兹] them,\n*—end of sentence.*\nsometimes read as **erroneous confusion from the West** [西之惑].\n\n**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—\nit is simply **inversion** [反之].\n\nIs it necessarily because there is **nothing** [无]?\n\nThe *Liezi* [《列子》] says:\n*\"The four directions of heaven and earth,\nthe interplay of water and fire,\nthe shifts of cold and heat—\nthere is nothing that does not **invert and disorder** [倒错] itself,\nfor it is of this kind.\"*\n\n**Erroneous confusion** [惑]—\n**excessive** [疾] **vision** [视] leads to **greater disorder** [愈乱],\n**deepening** [惇] and **changing** [易] **directions** [方].\n\n**Excessive vision** [疾视],\nis what was previously called **illness of vision** [病视] in the four directions.\n\nThus the *Book of Documents* [《书》] says:\n*\"Like one with failing eyesight seeing an empty land adorned with flowers—\nthe land is **empty** [空] and **without adornment** [无华],\nyet it is because of **false perception** [妄见] that they see it so.\"*\n\n**Deepening** [惇], is like **steadfastness** [笃].\n\n**Changing directions** [易方],\nis what the *Southern Huā* [《南华》] calls *\"the four directions of heaven and earth shifting positions\"* [天地四方易位].\n\nWhen **excessive vision** [疾视] reaches the point where\nthe four directions of heaven and earth **shift positions** [易位],\nthen this is the **depth** [笃] of their **illness** [病],\nnot merely the **dimness** [昏] of their **vision** [华].\n\n**Military** [兵] has **charms** [符],\nand the **Dao/Way** [道] has **verification** [验],\nfor it is only those who are not **lost** [迷] who can **perceive** [见] it.\n\n「Be prepared by making ready in advance, and plan by determining early.\nOtherwise, you will be **bewildered** [惑].\n\n**Leverage terrain** [因地利] and **counter with the Five Phases** [制以五行]:\nLeft—**Wood** [木], Right—**Metal** [金],\nFront—**Fire** [火], Rear—**Water** [水],\nCenter—**Earth** [土].\nDeploy troops and array soldiers—\nnever deviate from what is fitting.\n\nThe Five **Methodologies** [度] are aligned:\nLeft—**Wood**, Right—**Metal**, Front—**Fire**, Rear—**Water**, Center—**Earth**—\nthis is what they are.\n\nDo not act rashly without cause.\n\n**Shake the Handle** [招摇] is above,\n**Shake the Handle**, the tip of the Dipper’s [斗] **Pivot** [柄端], guiding the **Battle Array** [主指].\nWhen the **Marshal** [缮] **replenishes** [作] below,\n*The Rites* [《礼》] say:\n*\"March forward with the Vermilion Bird [朱雀], then follow with the Dark Tortoise [玄武],\nLeft with the Azure Dragon [青龙], Right with the White Tiger [白虎],\n**Shake the Handle** [招摇] above—\n**replenish** [缮] their **fury** [怒], lest it grow fierce.\"*\n\nThis is what they mean.\n**Replenish** [缮], is like **sustaining** [继].\nFor when **military momentum** [兵] is first **stirred** [一鼓作气],\nit falters on the second **strike** [再而衰],\nand **exhausts** [竭] on the third.\nThus, skilled warriors always **sustain their fury** [缮其怒],\nso that the second **strike** [再] never **falter** [至於衰],\nand the third **strike** [三] never **exhaust** [至於竭].\nThis is how the Yellow Emperor [黄帝] achieved\na hundred battles without defeat.\n\n**Model oneself after Heaven** [取法於天].\nThe Four Seasons **embody** [求] or **yield** [作] **omens** [象] for **life and growth** [生象]:\nSpring—**Azure Dragon** [苍龙],\nSummer—**Red Bird** [赤鸟],\nAutumn—**White Tiger** [白虎],\nWinter—**Dark Tortoise** [玄武].\nWhen Heaven and Earth are **mastered** [得],\nwhat cannot be **subdued** [宰]?\n\nThat which **logic inhabits** [理] is called **terrain** [地],\nThat which **spirit manifests** [神] is called **Heaven** [天].\nKnowing Heaven, one can **achieve unity in action** [一举] and **fourfold success** [四致],\n**rise together** [并起] yet **stand alone in victory** [独或作税成].\n\n**Crows follow** [乌乘随随], **□□ hover** [□蜚垂□] **□□** [秋].\n*(Unclear—original text has missing or ambiguous characters.)*\n\nThus, those who were once **adept at strategy** [善计者],\ndid not **pursue profit** [求利],\n*(or: **pursue victory** [求胜].)*\nbut **illuminated the numbers** [明数];\n*(or: **illuminated victory** [明胜].)*\nThose who were once **adept at war** [善战者],\ndid not **pursue victory** [求胜],\nbut **illuminated victory** [明胜].\nDo they not see the **recluse** [隐者]?\n\nIf one **begins to know** [设始知之],\nthose who **know** [知之者] have **already bent** [屈]—\nthey **know** [已知之].\nIf those who do not **know** [弗知者],\neven if a **teacher** [师] **explains** [说],\nthey still **do not grasp** [不晓].\nThe **recluse** [隐者] **conceals and withdraws** [韬潜],\nso their **difficulty in knowing** [难知] is thus.\nThis is why skilled warriors **must** [必] **illuminate victory** [至於明胜].\n\nAlas,\nthose who **obscure omens** [蔽象] and **block the two passes** [两塞之人],\n**collapse before defeat** [未败而崩],\n**are captured before death** [未死而禽].\nTo **take a state by force** [设兵取国] is the **glory of martial prowess** [武之美];\nTo **take a state without force** [不动取国] is the **refinement of civil skill** [文之华].\n**Soldiers grow stronger in battle** [士益武],\n**People grow more refined in peace** [人不益文].\n*(These two lines essentially convey the same idea, though phrased differently.)*\n\n**Transforming refinement** [变文],\nthis is how **differences arise** [是以不同].\nThe two are **truly** [甚] **sparingly loved** [寡爱].\n*(or: **truly** [甚] **lacking in compassion** [少恩].)*\n**Martial affairs are harsh and cruel** [武事刻惨],\n**losing in mercy** [失之少恩].\n**It is beyond measure to discuss** [不可胜论].»\n\nThe ear can hear and regulate sounds, yet cannot itself produce them.\nThe eye can perceive varied forms, yet cannot itself create them.\nThe mouth can speak of the divine and luminous, yet cannot itself embody them.\n\nAll this serves to illustrate that masters and artisans can teach others the rules and measures, yet cannot themselves impart their skill.\n\nThus, the sages of old who followed the Dao of the martial arts would call out to those who had strayed, *\"Do not go!\"*—forbidding them from proceeding.\nThey would open the veiled: as *Zhuangzi* says,\n*\"Had not the Master uncovered my shroud,\nI would not have seen the vast completeness of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nThey would loosen bonds and remove thorns—\n*bonds* as in the cords that bind,\n*thorns* as in the piercing of needles—\nrevealing confusion and clarifying understanding.\n\nThus, they could halt perilous schemes,\n*halt* meaning to cease and restrain.\nThey would traverse customs and exceed conventions,\nsurpassing norms and ranks,\ntheir strategic insight leaving common folk far behind—\nsome read *\"or\"* as *\"unbroken lineage\"*—\nthose who could meet challenges ahead would confront them,\nthose who could discern challenges behind would reveal them.\n*Reveal* as in *\"to make manifest past and present.\"*\n\nThey would grasp the essence of all under heaven without oversight,\n*oversight* meaning *\"loss.\"*\nThus, they would illuminate the strategies of enemy states,\nensuring they were not controlled by enemies.\n\nThe ways of victory in battle and conquest,\nresponding to all things without exhaustion,\ngoverning ten thousand with one yet not consolidating all—\nthey would grasp the essentials alone,\nas if summarizing each matter thoroughly,\ndrawing strength and providing for all.\n\nFrom this, distinctions arise,\ntheir brilliance manifest in their renown—\nthe court is where renown is displayed.\nThe *Commentaries* say:\n*\"Those who contend for honor do so in the court,\nthose who contend for profit do so in the market.\"*\n\nThey would exhaust the variations of virtue,\nreaching the fundamental essence of axes and shields—\n*axes* as in the *\"xiao\"* of *\"xiao xiao\"* (the sound of chopping),\n*shields* as in *\"dry\"* (the protective cover).\nThe axe is used to strike others,\nthe shield to defend oneself.\nTo know this is to know warfare.\n\nThe character *steel* (戎) is composed of *halberd* (戈) and *armor* (甲),\nfor the Dao of warfare is thus alone.\n\nThis is called the transmission of the boundless—\nexhausting variations and reaching the fundamental essence,\nthus attaining the convergence of adaptable transformation.\n\nThe *Nanhua* [Southern Flower, i.e., *Zhuangzi*] says:\n\n*\"Now if one were to attempt to traverse Zhou in Ru [i.e., by land],\nit would be like pushing a boat across dry land—\nlaborious yet yielding no result.\nThey do not know the transmission of the boundless,\nthe art of responding to things without exhaustion.\nThey are confined within the uncircumscribed realm.\n[Or: *the boundless expanse*.]\nThose who govern affairs internally cannot fathom their form,\n[Or: *the character ‘wu’ (無) as ‘nonexistent’*].\nThose who wield arms externally cannot fulfill their purpose.\nIf one fails within, how can one succeed without?\n\nFor warfare has three aspects:\nHeaven, humanity, and Earth.\nHeaven’s timing, Earth’s advantage, humanity’s harmony.\nWarfare exhausts humanity—\nwhen warfare’s purpose is fulfilled, the Way of humanity is attained.\n\nHumanity exhausts Earth,\nEarth exhausts Heaven.\nWhen humanity is exhausted, Earth is revealed.\nWhen Earth is exhausted, Heaven is revealed.\nHeaven has its victories—\nvictory comes from Heaven’s timing.\nEarth has its supports—\nsupport comes from Earth’s advantage.\nHumanity has its accomplishments—\naccomplishment comes from humanity’s harmony.\nThus, the adept in warfare must be cautious,\nfor what they must guard against is battle.\nThey conquer with Heaven, sustain with Earth, and perfect with humanity.\nWhen these three are clear,\nwhat strategy cannot be realized?\n\nWhat is meant by ‘Heaven’?\nNot that it verifies victory through tangible means—\nHeaven’s work is profound and mysterious,\nrequiring no material substance,\nyet it cannot be overcome.\nIs it not the force by which the sun’s momentum\ndominates all things in their submission?\nThis is called *shì* [势].\nIt encompasses the Five Phases’ cycles of flourishing, decline, isolation, and void.\nHeaven generates beings yet does not possess them—\nits origin lies in yin and yang.\nThe Four Seasons grow, flourish, recede, and store without losing order:\nAs the *Nanhua* says:\n‘Spring and summer precede, autumn and winter follow—\nthe divine sequence.’\nIts *quan* [权] is its resonance.\nWhen it strikes *jiao* [角] or manifests in *shang* [商],\n[and so on].\nSound resides in what cannot be transmitted—\nits power is supreme.\nIts power is not mere dross,\nhence it cannot be transmitted.\n\nThus, those who study warfare\nmust first master Heaven’s *quan*,\ndeploy the Five Phases,\nand wage battle with the Five Tones.\nTo the left, double *gong* [宫] and *jiao* [角],\nto the right, embrace *shang* [商] and *yu* [羽].\n[Sentence incomplete.]\"*\n\nThus, the **征** [Zheng] comes after.\n\nWith the **□** [or *zhuǎn*], one can summon the countless multitudes without relying on preexisting foundations.\n**□** [or *zhuǎn*]—like a gathering.\n\nHan Xin said:\n*\"I am not one who, like the common soldiers and officers, drives market folk to battle.\nHis strategy is not to place them in a position where they must fight to the death—\nrather, they fight for themselves, and yet I can still use them.\nThis is what he understands.*\n\nThe **陆** [or *bì*], **溺** [or *nì*], **溺人** [or *nìrén*—*to drown people*], **陆溺** [or *lùnì*—*to sink and drown*].\nIndeed, he employs unconventional tactics in warfare,\nand his hidden schemes can stir up chaos like winds over barren earth.\nThus, he can move freely through **窦** [or *dòu*—*passages, gaps*], **决** [or *jué*—*breaks, breaches*].\nIf one cannot summon chaos through **风波** [or *fēngbō*—*winds and waves*],\nthen even if they flow like rivers,\none can make them run dry.\nThe *Xunzi* says:\n‘Block their source, open their gaps—\nthe rivers and lakes can be drained.’\n\nIf it stands alone without connection,\nif it relies solely on **金** [Metal] **德** [virtue/power],\nexalted in slaughter and punishment,\nand does not bind the Four Phases together to support it,\nthen its flaws are as described below.\n\nTo sever the **道** [Way]’s **纪** [or *jì*—*order, regulation*],\nto disrupt the **天** [Heaven]’s **文** [or *wén*—*patterns, harmony*],\nto violate **音** [or *dà*—*to reach, extend*] **物** [things]’s **情** [or *qíng*—*nature, disposition*].\nHeaven’s lack of **纲** [or *xì*—*governing principles, guidance*],\nits **细** [or *mì*—*delicacy, subtlety*]—\nits punishment is **燥** [or *cǎn*—*harsh, cruel*] **凶** [or *xiōng*—*disaster, calamity*].\nHarsh disaster—disastrous drought.\nThe harmony of the Four Seasons is not fulfilled,\nso its **答** [or *dá*—*recompense, consequence*] is disastrous drought.\nThe *Laozi* says:\n‘There will surely be years of calamity.’\nThis is precisely what he means.\n\nTo avoid disorder and rebellion,\none must carefully govern **天英** [Heaven’s virtue/power];\"\n\nTo sever Heaven’s **英** [virtue/power]—or omit the two characters, Heaven’s virtue/power is lost—\nthe Three Armies lack substance.\n\nIf it lacks virtue/power yet has substance, who could possess such things?\nThis is false speech.\n\nThere are indeed things that bear virtue/power without substance,\nbut none that lack virtue/power yet have substance.\n\nThe **常圣** [Eternal Sage] of vast wisdom—\n(□□ possibly refers to *博* [comprehensive] *□* [□] *□* [□])\n—who restores the unity of past and present in a single day,\nopens and closes in accordance with Heaven and Earth’s demands.\n\n(Or: *This refers to the Sage’s eyes and ears—*\n*Heaven and Earth’s dependents—*\n*who open and close together.*)\n\nIf the True Sage reaches **纯** [perfection] in three ten-thousands of years,\nthen Heaven and Earth merge with me as one.\n\nThe Five **行** [Phases] cannot govern,\nthe Five **音** [Notes] cannot regulate,\nthough I abandon **阴阳** [Yin and Yang],\nit is still possible.\n\nIf I were not in this realm,\ncould I then discard the techniques of Yin and Yang?\nThus, the following text states:\n\nThus, the *Tianquan Shenqu Wuyin Shubing Yiyan* [Heaven’s Authority, Divine Harmony, Five-Note Military Arts, and Miscellaneous Sayings]\n(likely the title of a military treatise) says:\n\nIts chapters are structured by **祸福** [calamity and blessing].\n(Above *祸福* possibly has the character *斯* [this].)\nIf it aligns with the **符节** [divine patterns and rhythms].\n\nAll undertakings arise from **虑** [consideration],\nare completed through **务** [diligence],\nand fail due to **惊** [recklessness].\n\n*Neng Tian* [Mastering Heaven], Chapter Eighteen—\nthe **原圣心** [primordial Sage’s intent] in action.\n\nThe sentence is hidden and subtle before it may arise—\n*\"Sentiment\"* (情), like the sentiment of Heaven and Earth.\nThe Sage exhausts all the sentiments of the world,\nthen responds to things.\n\nDispersed without bounds, yet seeking, it becomes eternal oversight—\nThe Way is *Zhongyong* [the Doctrine of the Mean], hence it seeks oversight.\nExceeding the profound and obscure, it then becomes nothing—\n*\"Exceed\"* (轶), like exceeding ranks.\nThe Sage transcends all the principles of the world,\nthen forgets things.\n\nConfronting the serene depths, he thinks with solemn caution—\nThe Way is *Zhongyong*, hence he thinks with solemn caution.\n\nSevering the six extremes without constraint—\nSentiment is vast and subtle, yet it seeks oversight;\nExceeding the profound and obscure, he thinks with solemn caution—\nThis is how the Way is great yet unerratic, small yet unconfined.\nThus, he can sever the six extremes without constraint.\nThe six extremes are the six directions.\n*\"Constraint\"* (绞) is a term for urgency.\nSevering with this as the boundary—\nBeyond the six directions, the Sage exists yet does not deliberate;\nWithin the six directions, the Sage deliberates yet does not argue.\n\nObserving the boundless—\n*\"Naomo\"* (孰莫), like *\"what then?\"*\nListening to the unerring,\nExtending to the unconstrained,\nDiscussing the abyssal darkness,\nDeeply tranquil, unperturbed by chaos—\nThus, he can cut off the dust and stand in *Taqing* [Supreme Clarity].\n\nGoing forward with none accompanying,\nAlone he goes.\n\n「Coming without company,\nAlone he comes.\n\nSparse in preparation, few in his retinue—\nHe feeds at the fields of *Gujian* [Modest Sufficiency], hence it is called *Hibei*.\nHe wanders in the lands of *Jimo* [Silent Solitude], hence it is called *Guashu*.\n\nSolitary yet unpaired,\nHe never sets up an opposing counterpart.\nThus, he remains without blemish.\nWhen the *Zao Xue* [Purifying Waves] reach their peak—\n*\"Bao\"* (彼), like *\"that\"* or *\"there\"*—\n*\"Bao\"* (保), meaning *\"secure\"* or *\"stable\"*—\n*This is what is meant by \"arriving without movement.\"*\n\nTransmitting what has not yet been,\nHe perceives it before its sprouting.\nGuiding the leaderless in sequence,\nHe harmonizes yet does not lead#37.\nMeasuring the *Shiqi* [Ten Directions]#38,\nHe employs *Shi* [affairs]—\nOr, *\"Measuring the comings and goings, he regulates their rise and fall\"*—\nThose who have gone are diminished,\nThose who are yet to come are ascendant.\n\nFollowing the interplay of *dòng* [movement] and *jìng* [stillness],\nHe binds *shēng* [life]—\n*\"Sheng\"* (笙), like *\"harmony\"* or *\"resonance\"*—\n*\"Jie\"* (结), meaning *\"to fulfill\"* or *\"to complete\"*—\n*\"Hua\"* (华), meaning *\"to flourish\"* or *\"to manifest\"*—\nHe can act in accordance with Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Heaven and Earth* (天地), are the *form* (形) of *naturalness* (自然),\nWhich cannot be altered.\n*Odd and even* (奇耦), are the *numbers* (数) of *Dao* (道),\nWhich cannot be increased or decreased.\n*Success and failure* (成败), are the *omens* (兆) of *virtue* (德),\n*\"Er\"* (而), meaning *\"you\"*—\n*\"Chang\"* (长), as in *\"long-lasting\"* or *\"permanent\"*—\nThus, when one attains the Dao to stand firm,\nEarth can establish him;\nWhen one attains the Dao to fall or topple#39,\nEarth cannot establish him.\nWhen one attains the Dao to rest securely,\nEarth can secure him;\nWhen one attains the Dao to be in peril,\nEarth cannot secure him.\nWhen one attains the Dao to flourish in life,\nHeaven can nurture him;\nWhen one attains the Dao to meet death,\nHeaven cannot nurture him.\nWhen one attains the Dao to persist,\nHeaven can preserve him;\nWhen one attains the Dao to perish,\nHeaven cannot preserve him.\n*That which is secure or perilous*—\n*\"Bao\"* (彼), *\"an\"* (危), like *\"these\"*—\nHow can one blame Heaven’s Dao or the spirits and gods?\nStraightforward, he pushes it forward;\nCurved, he follows it naturally.\nSelf-secured, self-perilous, self-persisting, self-perishing—\nHeaven’s Dao, how could it favor one over another,\nAnd what role do the spirits and gods play in this?\n\n*One* (一), or *\"sun\"* (日)—\nThe *virtue* (德) of the *worthy* (贤).\nNot yet departed from *numbers* (数).\nThe *Sage* (圣), the *love* (爱) of the *worthy*,\n*\"Ai\"* (爱), like *\"reverence\"* or *\"admire\"*—\nThe *Dao* (道), that which the *Sage* (圣) *rèn* [undertakes]#40,\n*\"Shì\"* (史), like *\"to govern\"* or *\"to direct\"*—\nThe *attainment* (至) of the *perfect* (至).\nNot departing from *truth* (真), he is called the *perfect* (至人).\nThus, the *Dao* is that which the *Sage* undertakes,\nAnd the *perfect* attains—\nWith *perfection* (至) or *sainthood* (圣),\nIt cannot be borne by the world,\nCannot be named by reputation,\nCannot be conveyed by words,\nCannot be established by appearance—\nLike the *symbols* (象) of the Dao, which are as the *doorways* (门户) of the Way.\n\n*Dao* (道), like *\"speech\"* or *\"expression\"*—\nThe worthy and unworthy, the foolish and the wise,\nEnter and exit through it yet remain unchanged.\nThe *Dao* is the *opener* (开) of things,\nAble to make them *follow* (由) of their own accord.\nIt is not the *equalizer* (齐) of things,\nUnable to *order* (序) them.\nThus, the *Sage* is the *Dao*,\nYet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.\nThe *Sage*, as the *master* (主) of the Dao,\nThus, the *Sage* is the *Dao*,\nYet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.\n\nThe *Dao* is the *unifier* (通) of things,\nThe *Sage* is the *sequencer* (序) of things—\nHence, there are the *Dao* of the ancient kings,\nYet no *ancient kings* of the *Dao*.\nThis further explains the distinction:\nThe *Sage* is the *Dao*,\nYet the *Dao* is not the *Sage*.\n\nThe *Sage* is not as powerful as Heaven and Earth,\nYet knows their *rèn* [burden/role]#41;\nHis *qi* is not as vast as *yin-yang* [dark-light]#42,\nYet can serve as their *jīng* [canon/regulation]#43.\nNot as numerous as all things,\nYet can act as their *zhèng* [standard/rectifier]#44.\nNot as splendid as all beauties,\nYet can point out virtues and faults.\nNot as rich in *virtue* (道德),\nYet can elevate them.\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"Elevated and noble, none are greater than wealth and honor.\"*\n*\"Gao\"* (高), meaning *\"noble\"*—\n*\"Chong\"* (崇), meaning *\"wealth\"*—\nNot as radiant as the *Shenming* [Divine Illumination]#45,\nYet can act as their *ruler* (主) or *king* (王)#46.\nNot as subtle as the spirits and gods,\nYet can embody their *ling* [refined essence]#47.\nNot as enduring as metal and stone,\nYet can temper their *jìng* [rigor/strength]#48.\nNot as refined as the square and round,\nYet can manifest their *treatment* (治) or *vitality* (活)#49.\n\nOf old, those who attained the Dao to stand firm,\nRemain unshaken to this day—\nThe *four seasons* (四时), *Taishan* [Great Mountain]#50 is such;\nThose who attained the Dao to be in peril,\nRemain unsecured to this day—\nThe *Ling* [willow]#51, *Lingluán* [Willow Ravine]#52 or *Zhēnxī* [True Stream]#53—\n*\"Ling\"* (苓), like *\"to scatter\"* or *\"to fall\"*—\n*\"Yin\"* (堙), meaning *\"to block\"* or *\"to obstruct\"*—\nThe *shuìmù* [slender wood]#54 brings down the wind;\nThis is such—\n」\n\nThose who attained the Dao to thrive,\nRemain undying to this day—\nThe sun and moon, the stars and constellations, are such;\nThose who attained the Dao to perish,\nRemain unpreserved to this day—\nThe willow leaves when frost strikes,\nThe morning dew when exposed to the sun—such is their fate.\n\nThus, the Sage takes from *wù* [the concrete/manifest]#55,\nYet does not seek in *chá* [the scattered/insubstantial]#56.\n*Wù* is that which is concentrated within oneself;\n*Chá* is that which disperses into things.\n\nThings among things—\nFragrant and scattered, chaotic in appearance—\nWho does not arise from One,\nAll arising from One.\n\nTo reach the One is easy?\nTo reach the One is indeed easy.\n\nThus, one establishes certainty in humanity,\nObserves transformations in things.\n\nThe mouth is that by which one expresses sincere intent,\nYet some cannot *yú* [affirm/receive]#57 or *ài jiù* [love and comprehend]#58.\n*\"Yú\"* means \"to affirm and accept.\"\nTo proclaim what one says,\nYet sometimes exceeds the truth.\n\nThus, those whose actions differ criticize each other,\nThose whose Dao differs oppose each other.\n\n*Guǎncí* [deceptive speech]#59 is that which transforms things—\n*Guǎncí*, like the followers of *Gàozǐ* [Gaozi]#60.\nGaozi rejected inherent meaning; the Sage does not possess this,\nThus it is called \"transforming things.\"\n\nThe Sage knows what it departs from.\n\n*Yíncí* [excessive speech]#61 is that which follows things—\n*Yíncí*, like the followers of *Mòzǐ* [Mozi]#62.\nMozi practiced universal love; the Sage possesses this,\nThus it is called \"following things.\"\n\nThe Sage knows what it aligns with.\n\n*Zhàcí* [deceitful speech]#63 is that which obstructs things—\n*Zhà*, akin to \"evil.\"\nThe Sage knows what it adorns.\n\nAnd further, it composes speech for it.\n\nThe *túncí* [reclusive speech]#64 is that which requests things—\nThe *Yí* [Rites of Zhou]#65 says: *\"It is called 'commanded.'\"*\nThe Sage knows its ultimate reach.\n*Jí* [extreme], akin to *\"exhaustion.\"*\n\nThe *zhèngcí* [proper speech]#66 is that which benefits things—\nNeither deceptive, excessive, nor deceitful, nor reclusive—\nThis is called *zhèngcí* [proper speech].\nThe Sage knows its foundation.\n\n*Lì* [foundation] is that which can be demonstrated or known in its reach,\nYet none can articulate what lies beyond.\nSubtle and profound, the mind cannot grasp it.\nHow much less can speech?\n\nIlluminating discourse distinguishes inner and outer,\nLater generations can thus determine truth.\nSurface and depth must both be understood,\nOnly then can verification be achieved.\n\nOne exists yet is unseen,\nThe Dao exists yet cannot be monopolized.\n\nA fitting analogy is the abyss—\nIts depths are unfathomable,\nEndless waves surge yet never cease.\nEncompassing and flowing, none can exhaust it.\n\nEven the Sage, refining spirit and senses,\nPolishing body and form,\nAdjusting movements to harmony—\nSmall and great, curves and measures—\nNothing is overlooked, near or far, crooked or straight.\n\nThus, one who benefits ten thousand is called *jùn* [exalted],\nOne who benefits a thousand is called *háo* [heroic],\nOne who benefits a hundred is called *yīng* [exceptional].\n\nHence, the Sage’s speech is *fán* [ordinary].\n*Fán* [ordinary]—the comprehensive and essential words.\n\n---\n**武灵王第十九**\n武灵王问庞暖曰：\n*\"Wu Ling\"*—the King of Zhao—asked *Páng Huàn* [Pang Wan]:\n*\"I have heard flying words say: 'A hundred battles won is not the highest excellence; victory without battle is the highest excellence. I wish to hear its explanation.'\"*\n\nPáng Huàn replied:\n*\"The skilled value not contending.\"*\n\n*\"Skilled\"*—akin to *\"excellence.\"*\nThus, the highest strategy uses *calculations and schemes*,\nThe next relies on *human affairs*,\nThe lowest resorts to *war and conquest*.\n\nThose who use *calculations and schemes* confuse enemy rulers,\nCausing them to abandon proper customs,\nTo be swayed by licentious trends,\nTo act without the Sage’s principles—\nGranting rewards without merit,\nBestowing honors without labor,\nPardoning crimes in favor,\nExecuting the innocent in anger,\nClaiming caution while oppressing the people,\nNarrowing the populace while boasting of prosperity,\nMultiplying useless rituals,\nObsessing over divination,\nRelying solely on fortune-telling.\n\n[Unclear text]—those who do not align with inner harmony.\n\nWhat is meant by *relying on human affairs* is:\nUsing wealth and gifts,\nSilencing close advisors,\nBribing ministers to obey,\nTurning their *\"yes\"* to *\"no\"* and *\"no\"* to *\"yes,\"*\nSevering the ruler’s connection to loyal ministers.\n\nWhat is meant by *war and conquest* is:\nWhen a state is already broken,\nArmy follows to attack—\nAs *Gōu Jiàn* used this, *Wú* perished,\n*Chǔ* used this, *Chén* and *Cài* were subdued.\nIn the eighth year of *Líng Wáng*’s reign,\n*Qì Chì* was annihilated.\nIn the tenth year,\n*Qì Chì* was pacified.\nThus, *Chén* and *Cài* were conquered.\nThe *Sān Jiā* [Three Families] used this—*Zhì* was destroyed.\nThe *Sān Jiā*—*Jìn*, *Hán*, and *Wèi*—\n*Hán* used this to split eastward.\nIn the twelfth year of *Jìn Hèng Gōng*,\n*Hán Xuān Zǐ* divided *Qí Shì* and *Shàn Shè* with *Zhào* and *Wèi*.\n*\"Eastward split\"*—is this correct?\n\nNow, those who speak of war say:\nThe strong must prevail, the weak must perish.\nThus, small states have no kings,\nAnd great lords never fall.\n\nIn the past, *Xià* was vast while *Tāng* was narrow,\n*Yīn* was great while *Zhōu* was small,\n*Yuè* was weak while *Wú* was strong—\nThis is called *\"victory without battle,\"*\nThe highest excellence.\n\nThis is the law of the *Yīn Jīng* [Dark Classic],\n*The Yīn Jīng*—a text of *Huángdì* [Yellow Emperor].\n\nThe Way of nighttime warfare is akin to the *Tian Wǔ* [Heavenly Martial].\n\nNow, some may see a hundred thousand corpses lying in wait,\nBlood flowing a thousand *lǐ* [miles], yet victory still undecided.\nIf judged by military gains alone,\nSuch results are never as favorable.\n\nThus, the sage reflects with clarity and discernment,\nAnd sometimes gains *virtue/power* [德] through this.\nIn quiet contemplation, he rejoices alone.\nBut those who merely hear the clamor of drums and cymbals,\nAnd hope for martial prowess,\nWho see the banners and flags,\nAnd hope for battle formation,\nWho grasp the weapons of war,\nAnd hope for combat,\nWho advance and retreat in the chaos of battle,\nAnd hope for victory—\nSuch are the lords who meet their downfall.\n\n*Wǔ Líng* sighed deeply and lamented:\n\"Life and death rest upon my own insignificance—\nHow slight a thing it is to nurture the roots of fortune!\"\n\nI have heard this, and now I measure my days and months with self-reflection.\nIn the past, those who conquered through *virtue/power* [德] did not deceive their mandate,\nAnd those who seized the essentials spoke with precision.\n\n*\"Yīn Jīng\"* [Dark Classic] continues:\nThe Way of nighttime warfare—\nA text of the *Huángdì* [Yellow Emperor].\n\n---\n*(Note: The following sections contain extensive variant annotations, which are omitted in this translation as per your instructions.

The *Bó Xuǎn* chapter’s doctrine of fourfold verification and fivefold attainment is correct—if such a person encountered the right time, grasped the Dao, and applied it to governance, what great virtue and achievement would not follow?\n\nIn the *Xué Wèn* chapter, it speaks of how the lowly arise from uselessness, how one loses their vessel in midstream, and how a single jar may hold a thousand gold coins—I have read these words three times and felt sorrow for them.\n\nThe text contains thirty-five errors: three *yǐ* (transpositions), twenty-two *zāng* (omissions), and twelve *zhù* (corruptions). I have corrected them.\n\nLüzi said:\nHouguanzi was a man of Chu, dwelling in Tànshān, wearing a crown of *guàn* (hoopoe) feathers, hence his name. His teachings are inconsistent—beginning with *Huang-Lao* but later veering toward *Xíngmíng*.\n\nThe *Transmission* says: Shen Buhai and Han Fei refined *name* and *reality*, cutting to the core of affairs. Though their methods were harsh and lacked benevolence, they still drew from the intent of *Dao* and *De*. This is how learning can go astray.\n\nThus, after Confucius and Mozi, the *Rú* (Confucian) school split into eight, and the *Mò* (Mohist) into three. Alas, must one not be cautious?\n\nThough this book blends *Huang-Lao* and *Xíngmíng*, its core—like scattered fragments without a home—still occasionally reveals profound and subtle truths. From *Bó Xuǎn* to *Wǔ Líng Wáng Wèn*, there are nineteen chapters in total. Yet Han Yu, upon reading, claimed there were sixteen—this was not the complete work.\n\nThough the book now exists in full, its text is riddled with errors, many beyond recovery. The saying goes: *\"A book copied three times becomes a fish, a tiger, or the Emperor of Lu—is this not true?\"* I lament this, so I have clarified what can be known and marked the rest as doubtful, awaiting scholars of broad learning.\n\n---\n**Houguanzi (Volume One)**\n*Annotated by Lü Diàn*",

      "translated_text": "**Houguanzi (Volume One)**\n*Annotated by Lü Diàn*\n\n**Chapter One: On the Selection of Talent**\n\n*\"The first principle of broad selection\"*—King Fú#1 is not a tool for a single generation; he embodies **virtue/power** and eminent talent. King Fú#1 refers to the **Dao/Way** of governance. Master Jià#2 said: *\"Authority and legal ordinances—these are the ruler’s axe and adze.\"* If one relies solely on legal ordinances without tempering them with **virtue/power**, yet still hopes to endure, how difficult will that be!\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is measured in four ways: first, by Heaven; second, by Earth; third, by humanity; fourth, by **commanding fate**. **Commanding fate** is what gives rise to it. Human **authority** has five degrees of response:\n1. **Bóji**—those who are a hundred times better than oneself.\n2. **Shíji**—those who are ten times better than oneself.\n3. **Ruòji**—those equal to oneself.\n4. **Sīyì**—those who serve as laborers for one.\n5. **Túlì**—those who are mere commoners, even lower.\n\nWhat is called Heaven is the **Dao/Way** of natural principles and human emotions. The **Dao/Way** does not dwell in one place; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Heaven, and thus it is as it is. What is called Earth is the **Dao/Way** of constant and unchanging affairs. The **Dao/Way** does not settle in one state; those who grasp it do so by measuring it against Earth, and thus it is as it is.\n\nWhat is called the **Dao/Way** of humanity is the aversion to death and love for life. What is called **commanding fate** is that none dare disobey. To say none dare disobey is to speak of **commanding fate**. The ruler is one who embodies clarity and **spiritual luminosity**. He governs without action yet commands reverence. **Spiritual luminosity** is to take humanity as the foundation. Following humanity brings ease, relying on oneself brings toil.\n\nHumanity is to take the **virtue/power** of sages and worthies as the foundation. The **virtue/power** of sages and worthies is to take broad selection as the foundation. Shùn emerged from the fields, Fù#4 was raised from the laborers’ walls, Jiēgé from the fish and salt markets, Guān Yíwú from the ranks of scholars, Sūn Shū’áo from the seaside, Bǎilǐ Xī from the marketplace—thus, the path of selecting talent cannot be too narrow!\n\nBroad selection is to take the five degrees of response as the foundation. Therefore, when one faces them respectfully and serves them, the **Bóji** will come. To face them respectfully and serve them is called *receiving* them. To hasten forward and then rest, to question first and then remain silent, the **Shíji** will come. To go before others and rest after them, to question before them and remain silent after them—though this also means lowering oneself—it differs from *receiving* them. Hence, the **Bóji** depart, while the **Shíji** arrive.\n\nWhen others hasten and oneself hastens, the **Ruòji** will come. To hasten with others and rest with others is like flying in formation with them. Leaning on a table, propping on a staff, and issuing commands with gestures—then the **Sīyì** will come. To sit and lean on a table, to stand and prop on a staff, and to issue commands with gestures is still a matter of propriety. To delight in exclamations and despise sharp orders—then the **Túlì** will arrive.\n\nHumanity is the foundation of all things—*the people are the people*. To delight in exclamations, to despise sharp orders—this is utterly lacking in propriety. If not for shameless men, who would willingly endure this?\n\nThus, the sage ruler dwells with his teachers, the king with his friends, and the fallen lord with his retainers. Therefore, one with **virtue/power** over a hundred is called *juàn*#9, and one with **virtue/power** over a thousand is called *háo*#10—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of joyful harmony. One with **virtue/power** over ten thousand is called *yīng*#11—this is naming based on the **Dao/Way** of the outstanding in grass. The *Máo Shī Zhuan* says: *\"One ten thousand is called ‘yīng’.\"* The *Records* say: *\"Five is called ‘mào’#12, ten is called ‘xuǎn’#13, a hundred is called ‘shǐ’#14, a thousand is called ‘yīng’.\"* Now, this text also says that ten thousand is called *shǐ*#14 and a hundred is called *yīng*#11—this is yet more difficult to reconcile.\n\nThe *Lǐwén Zhì*#15 says: *\"The most distinctive of beasts is the ‘xióng’#16, the most outstanding of plants is the ‘yīng’#17.\"* Hàn Xīn is the *xióng*#16, Zhāng Liáng is the *yīng*#17—this is apt.\n\n**Virtue/power** in speech is what is called *shēng*#18—yet no speech has ever been heard where the echo surpassed the voice. The noble have wisdom, the wealthy have resources, the poor have their bodies. Without wisdom, one is lowly; without resources, one is poor. What they possess are merely the unique forms bestowed by Heaven and Earth.\n\nTo encompass all the limbs is called the *body*; to see all the features is called the *form*. If trust and oaths do not align, undertakings will not succeed. If one does not die or live, and does not make decisive judgments, how can one ever reach a conclusion? To always occupy the ground of indecision—how can this suffice to make a judgment?\n\nTo reward based on merit and to weigh **virtue/power** with authority—here lies King Fú#1. Who can wield it?\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Rarity of the Sage**—The **Dao/Way** is measured...",

      "translated_text": "This too has never been heard of—what more can be said?\n\nWhen trust in emotions and adherence to the Way are cultivated, it is not the work of Heaven’s punishment, nor does it defy the fate of humankind. To act against one’s nature is to fail in one’s duty. Without fear of Heaven’s calamities, human misfortunes, or perilous fate, yet still pursuing life as if it were a task—this is like an ant trying to wear a mountain as a crown. How could it bear such a burden?\n\nThose who seek success and gain are merely pursuing what they hope for. If success comes from Heaven, it is called fate; if not, it is called destiny—there is nothing else to rely on. This is the Way, not mere action. To act for the people is the essence of the Way. What the people are not yet at ease with, the Sage does not force upon them; what the people are not yet weary of, the Sage does not remove. Only when the people reach their limit does the Sage not intervene.\n\nHe who relies on others without taking responsibility himself—this is Heaven’s way. If the people truly reach their limit, how could the Sage overstep and take their place?\n\nThe Grand Tutor said: *\"Let the people cultivate the virtuous, and appoint leaders to guide them; let the people cultivate their abilities, and let others govern them.\"* This is how the Sage King transmits his teachings, preserving the institutions of governance.\n\nIf teaching is harsh, the people’s conduct becomes shallow. If discipline begins only after childhood, it is too late. Losing sight of the roots, they contend over the branches. Fish vanish from the rivers and lakes, yet they still quarrel in the muddy shallows.\n\nHumans have their place in their dwelling, dwellings have their place on the land, each with its own domain. The land has its place under Heaven, and the land is vast. Heaven has its place in time—like the early cold of Qin or the early heat of Chu. Time has its place in the numbers—like spring aligning with the Wood phase or autumn with the Metal phase. The numbers have their place in measurement—extending the many or shortening the few. Measurement has its place in unity.\n\nUnity is the origin of measurement and numbers, adapting to their divisions. It is like the moon illuminating all waters. Heaven, though high, has its lowly ears—this is why. Heaven’s body is vast, yet its ears are even lower, for its spirit pervades all things universally. Thus, the Sage King follows Heaven’s timing, and the people follow the land’s order. There is no idle skill, and effort yields much.\n\nThe Three Powers converge to make a king—this is drawn from here. Revering the ruler and humbling the subjects is not about favoring kin. Appointing the worthy and employing the capable is not about personal preference. It is about maintaining the old ways. Words should not abandon public justice for private favor.\n\nWater and fire do not mix—this is Heaven’s decree. Water and fire serve as metaphors for favor and justice. In ancient governance, when private favor was extreme, public justice could not be overridden; when public justice was extreme, private favor could not interfere. Like water and fire, they aid each other yet do not blend.\n\nStill, this is merely human conduct. As for Heaven’s Way, it lies beyond this realm. Hence, it is said:\n\nThe enlightened cannot illuminate what is already bright—this is why the blind man Li Zhu could not grasp it. The Way cannot be obtained.\n\nThe compass cannot encircle what is already complete—this is why strength cannot lift it. Though Heaven and Earth may subtly shift, their true essence remains. It is not like a boat in the night being carried away by currents—who could lift it?\n\nWhen wisdom arises from self-awareness, wisdom arises. To turn jade into a broken ring is to make governance slippery. Uncarved jade does not shatter—why would it become a broken ring? A ring is a half-circle.\n\n*The Rites* say: *\"Severing with a half-ring, then reuniting with a full ring.\"* Fields cannot flourish without adapting to the land’s shape. Rice thrives in lowlands, millet in uplands. Governance cannot transform the people without adapting to their customs. Excessive severity or leniency, inappropriate joy or anger—these four, when extreme, are not the Sage’s method. Though they differ, they all stray far from the Great Way. How could they claim the Sage’s seat?\n\n*The Liezi* says: *\"To hold onto them all is to be swayed by them.\"* The body, though restrained, still causes greater chaos, for form and influence do not govern each other. If form cannot restrain influence, and influence cannot restrain form, this is their ruin.\n\nVirtue and life are intertwined in existence and decay—this cannot be the standard. The bones of Yao and Shun have long decayed, yet they are still sung of today. Is it because their bodies endure? This is the law of the ten thousand ages.\n\nThose who govern the world have never separated themselves from Heaven or been without Heaven’s mandate while still benefiting the people. To benefit the people is to benefit the land. Heaven and humanity do not act independently—humanity without Heaven does not succeed, nor does Heaven without humanity. To deviate from Heaven and humanity is to fail in self-governance, let alone governing the world.\n\nThe Sage Kings’ great names were never established without the scholars’ contributions. It is Heaven that elevates them. Excess arises from above, punishment from below—this is how corrupt ages become commonplace.\n\nAh, how brief is life! This is the limit of fate. These are words of lament, saying that fate has reached its peak in the ruler. Now, with such a dire situation, how can it not be mourned?\n\nThe deeper the sorrow, the more restrained the words—this is the poet’s art.\n\n---\n*[Environmental shift: The text transitions to a new section, \"Environmental Flow\" (环流第五)]*\n\nThere is One and there is qi—",

**virtue/power** of the sage,\nis that they establish laws in the unseen,\nachieve what they seek and obtain what they desire,\nare obeyed without question,\ndraw near and distant alike,\nand their wisdom shines in all four directions.\nFrom this up to the unseen,\nthe responsibility of the sage is clear.\n\nWithin, they hold fast to their principles,\nusing them as a measure for verification—\nthis is what is meant by **\"Dao/Way\" as a guiding standard**.\n\nThen comes the ability to judge by a single root or principle,\nand to assess people with two words.\n\nWithout inner restraint,\none cannot discern the things they observe.\nA wealthy man’s generosity reveals his **virtue/power of benevolence**.\nA noble man’s promotions reveal his loyalty.\n\nObserve their **great conduct**—\nwhether they defer to the young or the old,\nwhether the noble defer to the lowly—\nthis reveals their sense of **ritual/propriety**.\n\nObserve what they refuse to do,\nand this reveals their **righteousness/principle**.\n\nObserve their acceptance of office and governance,\nand their decisions to leave or stay—\nthis reveals their **insight/wisdom**.\n\nObserve whether they are unyielding when pressed,\nand this reveals their **courage**.\n\nObserve whether their speech is sharp and their words skillful,\nand this reveals their **eloquence**.\n\nObserve whether they do not conceal when entrusted,\nand this reveals their **trustworthiness**.\n\nObserve what a poor man refuses to take,\nand this reveals their **cleanliness/integrity**.\nObserve what a lowly man refuses to do,\nand this reveals their **worthiness**.\n\nMeasure their depth and observe their Heavenly alignment,\nand this reveals their **sageliness**.\n\nThe essentials of assigning duties and examining origins\nlie in knowing people,\nand knowing people lies in having a way to observe them.\n\nConfucius said:\n*\"Observe the way they act,\nconsider the circumstances that lead them there,\nand examine where they find rest—\nhow could one fail to know them?\"*\n\nThus, this is further elaborated upon:\nThe ranks are never misaligned,\nand the principles do not contradict each other.\n\nNear and distant are harmonized,\nand the prepared are vigilant against change—\n*\"Prepared\"* is how they avoid being constrained,\n*\"Vigilant\"* is how they do not grow weary from adapting.\n\nThey understand their duties and act accordingly,\nmeasuring affairs with their own principles.\n\nA ruler without the **Dao/Way** employs the **petty and unworthy**—\nthe petty and unworthy are those of little virtue,\nwhose opposite is **noble and strong**—\nand their actions bring only confusion and disorder.\n\nA ruler with the **Dao/Way** employs the **noble and strong**,\nand their actions are clear and harmonious.\n\nThese two principles, once established,\nare like the **Mingqi**—\nthe **Mingtai** below, the **Mingqi** above.\n\n*\"Mingqi\"* refers to the **sacred vessel**,\nand *\"Mingtai\"* refers to the **spiritual platform**.\n*\"Sympathy\"* and *\"verification\"* are complementary.\n\nThe ruler aligns with their **virtue/power** above,\nand the subjects confirm its truth below.\n\nThe **ruler’s timing**—\nsome texts say *\"ruler’s intentions\"*—\nawaits the moment to act.\n\nWhen the **ruler’s timing** is clear,\nthey respond to the **Dao/Way** and issue commands.\n\nThe worthy in their domains,\nthough different in nature,\nshare a common understanding of **timing and circumstances**.\n\nThe **ruler’s timing**—\noriginally *\"timing and circumstances\"*—\nwhen encountering a person of **virtue/power**,\nthey do not need to speak to be trusted,\nand all the people naturally turn to them in kinship.\n\nWhen encountering a violent and arrogant person,\nthe people scatter and flee.\nAbove and below grow suspicious of each other,\nand their conflicts spiral like an unbroken ring,\nday and night without end.\n\nThose who offer counsel are not heeded,\nthose who speak are placed in danger,\nand there is no way to hear of mistakes—\nthus, great ministers feign loyalty but are not truly so.\n\nTherefore, a ruler who loves their people like a father\ndoes not need to summon them;\nthis is the effect of the **sacred platform**.\n\nThus, they shine with **light/clarity**,\nand their reputation ends in splendor.\n\nIf they punish without first instructing,\nor love while demanding closeness—\nsome texts say *\"love while seeking intimacy\"*—\nthen they invite **calamity**,\nand their end is in misfortune.\n\nWhen the worthy serve their ruler,\nthey adjust and harmonize—\nsome texts say *\"know and unite\"*—\ntheir **Dao/Way** is pure and steadfast,\nlike the **unyielding**—\nsome texts say *\"fortified\"*—\n**worthy subjects** who act with restraint.\n\nThey lead and transform them,\nand the world follows in approval.\nTheir **Dao/Way** grows ever more aligned,\nand thus their end is certain to flourish.\n\nWhen the petty serve their ruler,\nthey strive to obscure their ruler’s clarity,\nblock their hearing,\nexploit their authority,\nand make people cold or hot with their schemes—\nsome texts say *\"create discord\"*—\nrelying on the ruler’s power,\nthey manipulate others’ comfort.\n\nThe world despises them,\nand their rise is marked by ruin—\nsome texts say *\"their height is ominous\"*—\nthus their end is certain to fail,\nand their misfortune extends to their kin.\n\nThis is the transformation between ruler and subject,\nthe distinction between order and chaos,\nthe key to the rise and fall of states,\nand the critical juncture for a nation’s fate.\n\n*\"Critical juncture\"* can also mean *\"warning\"* or *\"checkpoint\"*.\nThe path of **reversal and compliance**, **benefit and harm**, arises from here.\n\nIn general, what can be done without study or learning,\nis only **breathing and eating**.\n\nThus, the ancient kings passed down the **Dao/Way**—\nsome texts say *\"broadened the Dao/Way\"*—\nthe ancient kings, or alternatively *\"the first teachers\"*,\n\nto emulate and inherit.\n\nWorthy rulers follow established laws,\nand their legacy endures for generations.\nUnworthy rulers do not comply,\nand their dynasty perishes in their own time.\n\nThe laws of **Yu** still exist,\nyet the **Xia** never became a perpetual dynasty—\nthis is why.\n\nNearly the same as *\"repeatedly\"*—\nsome texts say *\"seventh\"*—\n\nPang Zi asked the **Lu Guan Zi**:\n*\"What does the sage’s **Dao/Way** prioritize?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Prioritizing people.\"*\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"What does the **Dao/Way of people** prioritize?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Prioritizing arms.\"*\n\nPang Zi asked:\n*\"Why abandon Heaven and prioritize people?\"*\n\nThe **Lu Guan Zi** replied:\n*\"Heaven is vast and difficult to know,\nits blessings cannot be requested,\nand its calamities cannot be avoided.\nTo model oneself after Heaven is to oppose the **Dao/Way**.\"*",

      "translated_text": "「Nourishing is not a lasting loss. To take stillness as disturbance, to regard ease as peril—\nthe common folk suffer hardship, and people grieve.\nWhat calamity could be greater than this?\n\nIf one acts thus, on the day he flees north,\nhis army will be defeated that very day.\nWhen he realizes his fate is lost,\nhe will have already cast himself into the land of death long ago.\n\nPangzi said: *\"How can one govern with myriad laws?\"*\nThe **Huguanzi** replied: *\"Cangjie created the laws.\nThe original form of the character *fǎ* (法) was written beneath *shū* (书).\nCangjie, the scribe of the Yellow Emperor,\nfirst observed the tracks of birds and beasts receding into the distance,\nand thus invented writing and contracts.\nWriting begins with *jiǎzǐ* (甲子).\nThe sun begins at *jiǎ* (甲),\nand the earthly branches at *zǐ* (子).\nEstablished scribes, the **Liguan** (李官),\n—*chéngshǐ* (成史), meaning those who completed and reported cases to the ruler,\nand *Liguan* (李官), meaning the judicial officers—\ndid not follow the Dao.\nYet without Cangjie, there would be no rise of script and ink.\nThough Cangjie invented writing without teaching the scribes and judicial officers,\nscript and ink began to sprout from this moment.\nThis is the origin of myriad laws.\n\nEven if the laws are recorded in diagrams,\ntheir purpose—illustrating the heart,\nexpressing intentions,\nand promoting the Dao—\nis but a fraction, perhaps one-tenth,\nof what they truly contain.\nHow could one without script and ink\never fully exhaust their intentions in diagrams?\n\nFrom the perspective of later ages,\nwriting is for practical convenience,\nseals are inferior to cursive script,\nand cursive script is inferior to草书 (*cǎoshū*).\nThus, the bluntness of diagrams in responding to affairs is evident.\n\nTherefore it is said:\n*\"To weave together the affairs of the world,\nto record what endures and lasts far into the future,\nto depict what is unseen by the eye,\nand to transmit what the heart cannot comprehend—\nnothing surpasses writing.\"*\n\n*\"Unseen by the eye\"* refers to what is subtle and barely perceptible,\n*\"uncomprehended by the heart\"* refers to what is profound and elusive.\nThus, those who know myriad laws\nare the **Jiexiong** (桀雄) [tyrants and heroes].\nIf one understands them as *\"transcending form, the unseen, and the yet-to-be\"*—\nthen he knows the will of ten thousand people.\nThis is the power of virtue (*dé*), not merely the knowledge of tyrants and heroes.\nThus, his understanding surpasses that of ten thousand people,\nfor it spans these three realms beyond ordinary perception.\n\n*\"The yet-to-be\"* is superior to *\"the unseen\"* (*wúxíng*),\nand *\"the unseen\"* is superior to *\"the formless\"* (*húnlún*).\nIn analogy, if one speaks of the **Taiji** (太易),\nit is *\"the yet-to-be\"*;\nwhile *\"the Taichu\"* (太初),\nis the formless;\n*\"the Húnlún\"* (浑沦),\nis the yet-to-be in its primal state.\n\nOne without the wisdom of ten thousand people\ncannot dwell above the teachings of the world.\nPangzi said: *\"I have received strict instruction,\nand studied my craft with questions and answers.\"*\nYet when he consulted his teacher,\nhis disciples grew ever more fearful.\n\n**Huguanzi, Scroll One, ends here.**\nThe *Siku* edition states: *\"One version reads 'iron' (铁), but this is incorrect.\"*\n\nThe *Daozang* edition originally had *\"seize\"* (执) for *\"勢\"* (势), which is the ancient form of *\"勢\"* (势).\nNow it follows the *Siku* edition, reading *\"勢\"* (势).\n(Note: This passage originates from Jia Yi’s *Xin Shu·Zhi Buding*,\nwhere the original reads: *\"Power, authority, laws, and institutions—\nthese are the ruler’s axe and adze.\"*)\n\nThe *Siku* edition reads *\"命权\"* (mìngquán) for *\"权\"* (quán),\nbelonging to the preceding clause.\n\nThe *Daozang* edition originally had *\"传\"* (zhuàn) in error.\nNow it is corrected according to the *Siku* edition.\n(Note: King Wu Ding of the Shang Dynasty had a minister who transmitted sayings,\noriginally a slave named Dong engaged in laboring on the ramparts.)\n\nThe *Daozang* edition originally had *\"墨\"* (mò) in error for *\"默\"* (mò).\nNow it is corrected based on the later text and the *Siku* edition.\n\nThe *Daozang* edition originally lacked *\"乐嗟苦\"* (lè jiē kǔ).\nNow it is supplemented according to the *Siku*

the far,\nTo govern the **One** and transform the **Ten Thousand**.\nA ruler without desire cannot be spoken to of governance.\nWhat does this mean?\nAccording to my learning,\nThe ruler’s affliction

filled with excessive desire,\nYet outwardly, he practices benevolence and righteousness—\nHow can he hope to emulate the governance of **Tang** and **Yú**?\"*\nThe *Nánhuá* (Southern Flower) says:\n*\"If desire follows harmony, the *qi* becomes even,\nIf desire seeks the Spirit, the mind becomes still,\nIf desire strives for correctness, it follows necessity.\"*\nThis differs from the *Huluguanzi*.\nIn ancient times, **Guǐgǔ** wrote a book\nTo persuade the **Marquis** through eloquence,\nUsing **open** and **closed** tactics,\nNecessarily aligning with their likes and dislikes, joys and sorrows, to **open or close** accordingly.\nYet when one reaches the **desireless**,\nOne cannot persuade them.\nIf so, a ruler with excessive desire becomes the **Horizontalist’s** target,\nSeeking to sell their schemes.\nBut the *Huluguanzi* speaks of the **Way**,\nYet its later currents descend to this—\nIs it not too base?\nIf the **virtuous** are not employed,\nThe state cannot be made prosperous—\nThis is its essential point.\n\n**Pángzǐ** asked: *\"May I ask about the **Five Rectitudes**?\"*\nThe **Huluguanzi** replied: *\"There is **Spirit-transformation**,

here**.\nThis is why **Gengsang Chu** [35] **refuses to let go** of Lao Dan’s words.\nHence, the following text says:\n\nThus, **Divine Spirits** **radiate** with **Awe-Luminance** [36],\n**Lao Dan’s** *\"Awe-Luminance above\"* [37] **contradicts the brightness of sun and moon** [38].\n**Swift and slow, relaxed and urgent**—\n**the *qi* moves within** [39].\n**Lao Dan’s** *\"Within, it falls

[46]?\nHence, the following text says:\n\n**Heaven** is where **the *qi*** **collectively emerges** [47];\n**rainbows**, **frost and dew**, **winds and rains**—\nthese are **accumulated *qi*** **forming Heaven** [48].\n**Earth** is where **principles** **must necessarily** [49] **be** [50].\n**Without limits, without prohibitions** [51],\nthis is the **Dao of Heaven** [52].\nThe **Dao of Earth** then **takes necessity** [53].\nThus, the **Sage** **emerges from Heaven** [54],\nhis **Dao** always **emerges from Heaven** [55].\n**He confines it to Earth** [56].\nHe **does not allow it to emerge from Earth** [57].\nWithin **Heaven and Earth**, like **yin and yang** [58],\nhe **blocks dryness and dampness** [59] **with righteousness** [60],\n**adapting with the times** [61].\nOr, **without the word \"thus\"** [62],\n**if yin**, he **blocks dryness with righteousness**,\n**if yang**, he **blocks dampness with righteousness** [63].\n**Du Wan** [64] says:\n*\"If **Divine

      "translated_text": "The spoken is not from innate ability without learning.\nOne must first cultivate its use,\nthen understand its origins.\nThis is what is meant by:\nbeginning with origins,\nnurturing through nature,\nfulfilling through destiny.\n\nTang could overthrow Jie with seventy *li*,\nKing Wu could subdue Zhou with a hundred *li*—\nknowing one principle, no need for excess;\nknowing one principle, simplicity follows.\n\nA thousand schemes and myriad complexities,\nall blending into uniformity—\nwhen gathered under a singular essence,\nthey cannot differ.\n\nThe Dao of victory is not singular;\nthe methods of conquest are not confined to one path.\nThe wise calculate comprehensively—\nin battle, they must prevail;\nin assault, they must seize.\nA sagely commander does not abandon advantage for the sake of time,\nnor does a brave warrior fear death to extinguish his reputation.\n\nThose who seek to surpass the utmost virtue\nmust think differently from the common crowd.\nConforming to the crowd brings sickness of the mind;\nto surpass the utmost virtue is difficult indeed.\n\nTo verify the height of the Nine Heavens,\none does not walk a shortcut—\nhow can one reach it by asking for directions?\nThe Nine Heavens are fully revealed in the *Honglie Zhenjing*.\nThus, the southern realm is called the Vermilion Heaven,\nthe northern realm the Dark Heaven,\nthe central realm the Hooked Heaven, and so forth.\n\nTherefore, loyal ministers do not prioritize themselves over their lord,\nyet when isolated and abandoned,\nthey become suspended generals—\nin open battle, the nation weakens and the people exhaust;\nin city defense, they consume flesh and roast bones.\nSome even boil children for food,\nchopping corpses to cook.\nWhen strategy fails,\nthe state is diminished, the ruler constrained,\nand they become the laughingstock of the world.\nThose who manage state affairs—\nhow can they afford to be careless?\n\nThere are indeed errors in calculation,\nand there are trials—\ntrials may fail through negligence,\nencounters may fail through overrefinement;\nwhat matters is striking the balance.\nThus, Cao Mǐ served as Ru’s general,\nfighting three battles against Qi and losing a thousand *li*.\nHad Caozi not considered the aftermath,\nand instead died by his own hand,\nhe would have been no more than a defeated general, a captured commander.\nBut Caozi reasoned:\na defeated general is not courageous;\na diminished state and ruined name are not wise;\ndying while the lord is in peril is not loyal.\nThose who die for others cannot prolong another’s life,\nso he withdrew to advise the Ru lord.\n\nWhen Duke Huan assembled the feudal lords,\nCaozi seized the duke by the throne with a single sword,\nhis expression unchanging, his words unflinching.\nThe lost lands were recovered in a day,\nshaking the world, startling the neighbors,\nand his name echoed through the ages.\nHad he clung to petty resentment,\ngreat deeds would not have been accomplished.\nThus, Caozi abandoned transient anger\nto establish a lifelong legacy,\ndiscarding minor shame\nto earn renown for generations.\nHence, Caozi understood the times,\nand the Ru lord knew his men.\n\nJu Xin served as Yan’s general,\nfought against Zhao, and lost the battle.\nJu Xin took his own life,\nand Yan lost five cities.\nHe opened the door to disaster for himself,\ndied while endangering his lord,\nand his name and reputation perished—\nthis was failure,\na strategy without foresight.\nIt was not a lack of ability,\nbut rather a disregard for preserving life.\nThough Cao Mǐ’s actions coincided with Guan Zhong’s era,\nhe did not seek short-term gratification\nbut instead ensured Qi’s credibility among the feudal lords,\nthus fulfilling his reputation.\n\nAs for Li Ling’s surrender,\nhe sought to repay Han\nbut ultimately saw his entire clan exterminated,\nand the men of Longxi regarded it as shame.\nHow could Caozi’s bold action be considered ordinary?\nMuch less for a conqueror’s deeds.\n\nAs for those of *Wangde*’s virtue,\nwhose sincerity and clarity are innate,\nthey would not condemn Mǐ to death in Ru’s lands—\nwhat is there to praise in that?\n\nThose who attain the Dao strive to avoid great failure;\nordinary people strive for minor virtues.\nMinor virtues accumulate into many vices,\nmany vices prevent the accumulation of virtue,\nand without accumulation, misfortune follows—\nsome say many vices bring many misfortunes.\nMisfortune brings turbidity,\nturbidity brings ignorance.\nExcessive desires lead to narrowness,\nnarrowness breeds many worries,\nmany worries bring turbidity,\nturbidity brings ignorance.\nDesires and vices—\nthese are what obscure wisdom.\n\nThe powerless are shamed,\nand shame is disgrace.\nThus, Ju Xin could sever his fate,\nyet the Yan king failed to discern talent.\n\nIn ancient times, skilled warriors\nmustered armies in unison,\narrayed them according to the Five Phases,\nfought with the Five Notes,\npointed to the celestial pole,\naligned with the divine,\nand from this, all things took form—\nusing one principle

      "translated_text": "Wu fled southeast, while General Jia Fu prepared for the northwest—clearly understanding this truth.\n\nWhen an army is about to break, its movements are swift as arrows loosed or crossbow bolts, thunderous as thunder and lightning, fierce as a collapsing wall. The soldiers grasp their weapons tightly, their stances rigid—*The Art of War* says: *\"When their grip is firm, their stance is short.\"* Their actions are unyielding, avoiding my death ground, seeking my life ground, advancing when the time is ripe, seizing opportunities—*or* lending strength to my advantages. Thus, the soldiers never falter in retreat, the army never finds itself in dire straits.\n\nHe who masters this Dao can drive even common folk like cattle, ride the current as if gliding—*or* soar with the Dao. Soaring and seizing, securing and defending—*or* preparing defenses; breathing in and out—*or* adjusting and shifting—*stillness without movement.* Aligning with the rhythm of time, one step forward, one step back, like musical notes in harmony—*or* in service. One to the right, one to the left—*the Dao knows no impossibility.*\n\nReceiving measure from Heaven, establishing position on Earth, attaining form through humanity. When the moment arrives, how can it be undone?—*or* how can its return be forced? *Return* means reversal; *stillness* means withdrawal. How can it be restrained or grasped? *Restrained* means drawn back; *grasped* means held fast. *Stillness* speaks of the ungovernable; *restraint* speaks of the unchecked.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not lean—*they shift in response to ability.* Measures interact, yin and yang contend, death and life constrain, qi and power annihilate, emptiness and substance depend on each other, gain and loss drift—*or* float indeterminately. *Floating indeterminately* means without fixed form. War is won by advantage—*The Art of War says:* *\"Like rolling a round stone down a thousand-zhang mountain, that is advantage.\"* Time does not always favor one side; early or late, one may falter while the other thrives, each generating the other’s strength. Change is boundless—how can it be fully spoken?\n\nWater struck becomes dry; an arrow struck flies farther. Spirit vibrates and thins, oscillating in turn. Slowness and speed are fated—*fated* means *halted* or *ceased.* It must strike the three ranks. *Three ranks* refers to the three divisions of an army. Gathering and dispersing, ebbing and flowing—who can know the moment?\n\nThe perfected transcends things—*or* does not cling to them—moving alone with the Dao, unrestrained, abandoning fate, coming and going with time. Rise and decline, life and death—who can know their measure? Solemn and profound, who can fathom their depth? Calamity is the reverse of fortune; fortune is the reverse of calamity. Calamity and fortune are intertwined like twisted cords. *Three strands twisted together make a cord.* Chaos and confusion—its form is singular, yet shapes dissolve and reform. Who knows their pattern?\n\nWithout form or boundary—*or* root—only the Sage can discern its intent—*or* is able to discern its intent. Flowing and shifting, it never rests. *A brief pause is called rest.* Ending leads to beginning—who knows its limit?\n\nA net with one eye cannot catch a sparrow—*too sparse.* A bird in a cage only peers out—*too dense.* The common crowd murmurs in agreement—how can they settle fortune and calamity? Joy and sorrow gather at the gate; good and ill share the same domain. *Mourners at the door while guests feast in the hall.* Loss becomes gain; success becomes failure.\n\nWu had mighty armies and strong forces—yet King Fu Zhi was brought low. Yue took refuge in Kuaiji—yet King Gou Jian became a hegemon. The enlightened observer sees the truth. *Truth* or *harshness.* A single technique—how can it suffice for roaming?\n\n*Elliptical and square*—what use are they for adaptability? *Elliptical* is read like *Sui Dù’s* \"Sui\"; *square* like *Fāng Biàn’s* \"Fāng.\" The affairs of the world demand a hundred responses, each varying to meet a hundred changes. Yet now, clinging to one technique—how can it suffice in the realm of adaptability?\n\nFrom ancient times to now, what event lacks its counterpart? *Counterpart* means *a station for relaying messages.* Travelers pass through it without pause; thus, past events are called *counterparts.* Shun had unfilial conduct; Yao lacked tenderness. King Wen was bound in chains; Guan Zhong was imprisoned. Towering and vast—*or* buried in clouds—who can grasp it?\n\nThis speaks of the Great Pivot dispersing things—towering and vast without boundary, all within the *Lǔ* vessel—who can grasp it? The perfected has no partiality, drifting like an untethered boat—*simply yielding.* The capable are saved; the incapable are destroyed. Heaven cannot be schemed with; Earth cannot be plotted against. The Sage abandons things, follows nature, and lets go.\n\nThe common crowd is confined—*confined* means *narrow and shallow*—pressured by desires. The slightly wise rush to act, fearing good and evil. The arrogant die by their power, boasting in self-importance—*or* spending their lives scheming for fame. *One version omits:* \"The scholar pursues fame; the greedy man pursues wealth. To chase after things with one’s body is called *serving* them.\"\n\nThe most expansive lacks sufficiency—*or* is bound. Governing without a key, even vastness becomes insufficient. Why?
