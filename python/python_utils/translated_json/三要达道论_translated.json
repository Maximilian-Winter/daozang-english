Its wondrous workings lie hidden in the unfathomable, while its true origin scatters amidst all creation. Thus, vast and boundless theories are like fine sprouts that never bloom; rigid and inflexible doctrines are like toppled trees that never sprout. The Great Dao has long suffered from this. Those who mistake ignorance for knowledge and harm for benefit are regarded by others as distant as a thousand *li*.\n\nNow, the practitioner of cultivation must cast aside worries and forget thoughts, sever worldly dust and brush away attachments. Let them heed my words.\n\nI once read in the *Yin Fu Jing*: \"The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials.\" I say: know their root. That which seduces a person’s truth, disturbs their spirit, and leaves inner vision unclear and wisdom’s radiance dimmed is the five colors—yet the eyes constantly contend with them. That which steals a person’s numinosity, abandons their clarity, and silences the celestial drum while muting rare sounds is the five tones—yet the ears constantly vie with them. A single slip becomes the pivot of honor and disgrace; a single utterance becomes the source of good and evil. From this arise all judgments of right and wrong—yet the mouth endlessly debates them. Thus, the eyes contend with the five colors, the ears vie with the five tones, and the mouth disputes all speech. From this, the eyes grow blind, the ears grow deaf, and the mouth grows mute. The true origin is lost, and the nine deviations arise from this.\n\nThose who would nurture the Dao and dispel the nine deviations must first rectify the three essentials. Nothing is better than: \"Look not at what is contrary to ritual, listen not to what is contrary to ritual, speak not what is contrary to ritual.\" Even Yan Yuan, in his pursuit of benevolence, was cautious in this—how much more so for one nurturing the Dao? Constantly shield the eyes from color, block the ears from sound, and seal the mouth from speech.\n\nYet \"no color\" does not mean simply the absence of color, but the absence of *that* color—color itself. If one views with ritual, why shield? \"No sound\" does not mean simply the absence of sound, but the absence of *that* sound—sound itself. If one listens with the Dao, why block? \"No speech\" does not mean simply the absence of speech, but the absence of *that* speech—speech itself. If one speaks with canonical propriety, why seal?\n\nView with ritual, and the five colors will not disturb; no fault will lie with the eyes. Listen with the Dao, and the five tones will not lead astray; no fault will lie with the ears. Speak with canonical propriety, and all words will not err; no fault will lie with the mouth. Thus, the Dharma-eye sees all, the Dharma-ear hears all, and Dharma-speech discerns all. The Great Dao ever abides within oneself, and external things cannot defile it.\n\nNow, those who study the Dao yet fail to sever the three essentials, seeking transcendence, surely do not understand. I have thus expounded on the Dao, offering this teaching. May all examine it carefully, apply it to the Dao’s work, and attain the wondrous fruit of liberation from the world.\n\n**End of *The Three Essentials for Attaining the Dao***",
