  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Numinous Dipper Mother, Great Sage Primordial Sovereign’s Life-Prolonging Heart Sutra**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Numinous Dipper Mother, Great Sage Primordial Sovereign’s Life-Prolonging Heart Sutra*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Song-Yuan period. Exhorts those who cultivate the Great Elixir to revere the Dipper Mother Primordial Sovereign. One scroll. Source text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Writings of the Divine Empyrean Section*.\n\n---\n\nThe Supreme Numinous Dipper Mother, Great Sage Primordial Sovereign’s Life-Prolonging Heart Sutra\n\nThe Lord Lao said: The Dipper Mother’s supreme numinous light is vast and round, within the Heavenly Treasure Moon resides the *qian* tree, its hue lustrous as lapis lazuli. The Jade Hare forges the Great Medicine for eternal life.\n\nWhenever the qi and fortune of Heaven and Earth wax or wane, when the sun, moon, and stars err in their courses, when rain and shine, darkness and brightness come untimely, when wind, cold, heat, and dampness lack moderation—when drought, floods, fire, epidemics, and calamities arise—even when blades and warfare, locusts and plagues, malevolent spirits and specters, sickness and harm to life, disputes and unjust vexations, and all manner of inauspicious events occur, all these are caused by the disorder of qi.\n\nThe Dipper Mother descends with the Great Medicine, universally bestowing the power of healing. She harmonizes the Five Phases, regulates the ascent and descent of the Two Qi, resolves stagnation and obstruction, shatters darkness and expels evil. What was delayed arrives on time; what lost its measure regains it. She ensures safe gestation and childbirth, cures all illnesses, nourishes roots and stems, revives yang and restores the seasons, engenders all beings, refines and delivers spirits, disperses and averts the hundred knots, supplements the Eight Yang, aids the upright and preserves the true, summons harmony and extends blessings. Silently, her medicinal power operates, her office weighty as the Heavenly Physician.\n\nShe gives birth to the brightness of the moon for all heavenly beings, serving as the mother of the Northern Dipper’s host of stars. The Dipper is her po-soul; water is her essence. She governs the light of human life, congeals the water of nature. All waters share one moon; all moons share one light. Sentient and insentient alike equally receive her numinous radiance. The Dao’s qi, one by one, sustains their nurture, protection, and defense. Her grace is profound, her virtue weighty—yet none can fully know it.\n\nThus, the human heart and face bear seven apertures, inwardly corresponding to the heart. The po-soul possesses seven perfected ones, receiving its po from the Dipper.\n\nThe Dipper Mother’s honorific titles include: *Nine Numinous Supreme Wondrous White Jade Turtle Terrace Night-Shining Golden Essence Ancestral Mother Primordial Sovereign*; also *Central Heaven Brahma Qi Dipper Mother Primordial Sovereign, Purple Radiance Wise and Benevolent Primordial Jade Empress Golden Perfected Sagely Virtue Heavenly Worthy*; further transformed as *Great Perfect Full Moon Radiance King*; and also *Eastern Florescence Compassionate Salvation August Lord, Heavenly Physician Great Sage*. Her appellations are manifold.\n\nShe presides over the Central Heaven Treasure Pavilion. From the primordial kalpa, she cultivated the numinous and wondrous Dao in the Mysterious Brightness True Purity Heaven, diligently serving the Primordial Most High. Her wisdom incense wafted in clouds; her lamp of insight shone brightly. With each vow she made, she wished to bear sagely children to assist and mend creation, to govern and regulate Heaven and Earth. Her vow was steadfast, unwavering from beginning to end.\n\nOnce, while bathing in the Nine-Bend Flowery Pool, a divine *xiezhi*-adorned throne of white jade turtle terrace emerged. The Dipper Mother ascended the throne, nurturing her divine perfected ones, refining her essence and po-soul. In profound absorption, she drew in qi, which entered the mysterious and again mysterious. Moving in harmony with the numinous wind, purple emptiness flourished abundantly. She realized the numinous and wondrous Dao, emitting boundless subtle and wondrous radiance that penetrated the Flowery Pool.\n\nFrom this, nine-petaled golden lotuses were born. Over seven days and nights in the human realm, the radiance in the Flowery Pool grew ever more intense and resplendent. In that moment, it ascended to the Nine-Flower Heaven, transforming into nine great treasure pavilions. Within these pavilions, the nine perfected Brahma qi coalesced naturally into scripture, its text reading: □□□□□□□□□. Before it stood the Celestial Pivot, its light spreading secret characters, the text reading: □□, its rays and edges blazing brilliantly.\n\nThese nine chapters give birth to the spirits, manifesting the nine sovereign Dao bodies:\n\n1. Heavenly Sovereign\n2. Purple Tenuity\n3. Greedy Wolf\n4. Great Gate\n5. Wealth Repository\n6. Literary Curve\n7. Integrity and Chastity\n8. Martial Brilliance\n9. Destroying Army\n\nThe Heavenly Sovereign and Purple Tenuity, two august stars, reside in the Śāla Palace at the Dipper’s mouth. Their true light is as vast as a chariot wheel. Those who behold it attain longevity of body, realize true immortality, and forever escape the cycle of rebirth. The two stars divide their remaining radiance into Left Auxiliary and Right Assistant, into *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo*, their divine transformations boundless. Together, they govern the correct qi of the mysterious and the yellow.\n\nThe Seven Primal Star Lords revolve yin and yang, shaping creation. Their merit pervades the Three Realms; their virtue moistens all beings. Their meritorious power and virtue are inconceivable.\n\nFor those who cultivate the Great Elixir of Ninefold Return and Sevenfold Reversion, holding to this will bring sudden awakening to the Mysterious Pass. Numinous light appears before them; the thirty-nine joints naturally flourish. They realize the Great Mystery’s Three-in-One Dao, understanding the principle of guarding the originally complete. Their true body becomes firm. Further, through refined cultivation of great samādhi, their form and spirit become wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. They ascend to the Jade Capital, carefree and at ease.\n\nAt this stage, through kalpas and lives, their mysterious ancestors and kin all attain liberation, together receiving the mysterious grace. They deliver the living and the dead—this is the profound wonder. Returning the heart in devotion, abiding in stillness within the revolving jade, the inner vision remains undefiled by the six senses; the outer vision does not sink into the ten thousand existences. Serene and pure, the Dao is before one’s eyes. Bow in reverence to the true form.\n\n**Reverent Incantation:**\nNuminous nodes flourish, eternally preserving long life.\nThe Great Mystery’s Three-in-One guards its true form.\nThe spirit lords of the five viscera each attain peace.\n□□□□□□□□□, swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Numinous Dipper Mother, Great Sage Primordial Sovereign’s Life-Prolonging Heart Sutra*.",
