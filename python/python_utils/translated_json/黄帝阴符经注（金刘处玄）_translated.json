  "full_translation": "**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***.\nComposed by **Changshengzi Liu Chu Xuan**, completed in the **Jin Zhangjing year of Mingchang, the Year of the Ox (1191)**.\nOne volume.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Ming Dynasty), **Dongzhen** (Cavernly True) section, **Yu Jue** (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\nThe *True Classic of Yin Fu* contains over three hundred characters—its words are few yet its meaning profound, its text deep yet its principles complete. The Dao/Way of life and death’s subtle mechanisms, the principles of yin and yang’s transformation and generation, all wondrous applications and authentic powers, are encompassed and summarized within. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, amid his myriad affairs, attained profound silence and emptiness, and through this, he encountered the True Classic. On **Kongtong Mountain**, he questioned the **Celestial Sovereign of Truth** and **Master Guangcheng**, gaining their essential insights. Diligent in practice, he one day ascended to Heaven by riding the **Fire Dragon** from **Ding Lake**, and thus the Dao/Way was passed down to the world. Later practitioners who sought immortality and embraced the Dao/Way, those who could silently perceive its mysteries and deeply cultivate its realms, often raised themselves high and far, ascending with the shadows and rising into the void—such achievements were not few.\n\nYet across countless ages, none directly annotated or explained this text, revealing its true meaning. All merely employed flowery metaphors and oblique allusions, leaving its authentic source concealed. Thus, students became entangled in endless branches, their doubts persisting even to old age, their labor yielding no fruit. The more they sought, the more confused they grew, abandoning their path halfway—such cases are innumerable. Consequently, many deemed the Daoist classics as empty words, a fate most lamentable.\n\n**True Person Liu, the Immortal of the Divine Peak**, instructed **Law Order and the Vessel** (器). **Master Liu**, whose vast talents spanned antiquity and modernity, whose mind wandered through the Dao of Virtue and Power, pondered deeply and refined his understanding. He delved into profound mysteries and explored hidden truths, annotating this text with clarity and openness, making it easily known and practiced for the benefit of future generations. Truly, he was a compassionate and virtuous scholar.\n\n**Graduate Bishou from Jinan**, whose name was **Zhenyi**, wrote this preface, intending to spread the text far and wide as a guide for students. Those who carefully examine this work may awaken from doubt, resolve confusion, and all attain liberation from the dusty entanglements of the world. They may directly enter the realm of True Dao/Way, wandering freely in the boundless expanse.\n\nOn the **twenty-second day of the second lunar month in the Year of the Ox (1191)**, **Fan Zhenyude**, the **Learning Official of Ninghai Prefecture**, prefaced this text.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Dao/Way of the Embracing-One Immortals**\n\nTo **observe the Dao/Way of Heaven** and **hold fast to Heaven’s actions**, is to attain completeness. To **observe** is to **perfect the Five Eyes** (五眼) and attain clarity. When one’s **Heavenly Eye** (天眼), **Palm of Wisdom Eye** (慧眼), **Dharma Eye** (法眼), **Dao/Way Eye** (道眼), and **Divine Eye** (神眼) are all radiant and piercing, the **Five Aggregates** (五蕴) dissolve into emptiness, and one perceives the **Heavenly Dao/Way**.\n\nWithin Heaven lies the **Heaven Beyond Heaven** (天外天), above the earth. **Pure Qi** (清炁) is Heaven—its loftiest realm extends **eighty-four thousand li** (至高八万四千里), the **Highest Heaven** (高天). In the human body, each receives a portion of Heaven’s Qi; the Qi varies in thickness. If it is **harmonious and balanced**, one becomes a **sage or worthy**; if it is **contrary and dispersed**, one descends into the realm of ghosts.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **formless essence** beyond Heaven and Earth, the **source of all ten thousand things**. In the human body, if one **glimpses the boundless expanse** with a **mind of emptiness**, then one’s **innate nature** (至性) aligns harmoniously with the Dao/Way.\n\nTo **hold fast** means to **guard the True** while rejecting the false, to **awaken to the Right** while avoiding the perverse.\n\n**Heaven** refers to Heaven’s **generative power** over all things. Heaven generates all things yet does not **hoard or take** them back; it benefits the **ten directions, the Three Realms, and all beings**, yet does not expect repayment. It merely wishes that all beings **awaken to and fully comprehend** the principles of Heaven. One must **neither hate nor love** all things, maintaining the **equality of Heaven**.\n\nWhen humans, who possess **emotion**, comprehend Heaven’s **lack of emotion**, they fulfill their **gratitude to Heaven**. If one does not follow the **principles of Heaven**, even if one indulges in **filth, evil, licentiousness, and depravity**, one will suffer **disease, early death, and untimely demise**, descending into the **Hell Realms** and enduring **exhaustive suffering**. Then one falls into the **animal realm**, losing one’s human form.\n\nIf one follows **Heaven’s singular Dao/Way**, **constant goodness** brings **harmonious Qi**; **constant purity** refines one’s **innate nature**; **constant detachment from emotion** preserves one’s **life-force**; **constant freedom from defilement** clarifies the Dao/Way; and **constant non-transgression of Heaven’s laws** ensures **no guilt**.\n\nWithout cultivating **worldly blessings**, one **embraces the Dao/Way** and preserves its **authentic essence**. **Blessings do not cling to minor, external methods**; one **suddenly comprehends the principle of Non-Action** (無為), and all **laws** (萬法) are thereby **fully liberated** across the Three Realms.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who see them flourish. The **Five Thieves** are not the **worldly bandits** nor the **human Six Thieves** (六贼), but what kind of thieves are they?\n\nHeaven’s **Five Rectifying Qi** (五方正炁) reside within the human body as the **mother of the spirit**. The **Celestial Cycle’s twelve hours** naturally **withdraw, supplement, and revolve**, their **limitless subtlety** termed **Non-Action** (無). Within this cycle, **Heaven and Earth transmit yin and yang**, **refined Qi** (秀炁) generates in all things, and humans consume **the Five Grains**, nourishing their **physical form** yet harboring **filth and impurity**. They are **immersed in water and fire**, and the **essence of the Five Grains** in the human body, if preserved, becomes **life-force**.\n\nWhen **life-force** (命) aligns with **innate nature** (性), one’s lifespan extends; when **innate nature** harmonizes with **life-force**, one’s vitality flourishes. **Life-force** is like the **tortoise of the Northern Sea** (北海之乌龟), which **Master Ding** (丁翁) constantly holds to form its shape. The **Five Thieves** are the **True Yang** (真阳). When Heaven’s **True Yang** encounters its **True Yin** (真阴), the **Five Thieves** steal the **treasure of the Northern Sea**. Those who **guard this treasure** flourish, just as all beings and humans are **plundered by thieves**.\n\nThe **Five Thieves** dwell in the heart; their actions extend to Heaven. The **cosmos lies within one’s grasp**, and **all transformations arise from the body**. The **Five Thieves** in the heart are the **disordered Five Phases** (五行颠倒). Within the heart, **True Water** (真水) ascends—if **contrary**, the **heart’s orifices are blocked**, and **Kidney Water** (肾水) descends, leading to **the path of death**. All who do not follow the **Dao/Way of the Sages** are thus.\n\nThe **ancient enlightened sages** often spoke of the Dao/Way in varied terms, while the **common folk** each cling to their own limited perceptions, distinguishing between **high and low** paths.\n\nThe righteous can contain the wicked, yet when wickedness prevails, it slanders the righteous.\nWicked teachings multiply false perspectives—\nlike fireflies flickering beside the true Dao/Way,\ncomparable to the light of sun and moon.\nWhen night is dark, their faint glow appears bright,\nbut how could one mistake firefly light\nfor the radiant splendor of sun and moon\nilluminating the ten directions and three realms?\n\nThe Sage grasps the cosmos’ yin-yang transformations,\nEarth and Heaven in harmonious union,\nall transformations arising from the body,\nall forms taking shape.\n\nAmong all things, only humankind is supreme and noble—\nto seize the workings of Nature,\nto cultivate the inner and outer self, is to attain the Dao/Way.\nTo master all transformations,\nto externally rescue suffering beings,\nto awaken from the golden fetters,\nthe jade shackles,\nthe fleeting spark of stone,\nthe wind-lit illusions of the world—\nto distance oneself from filth and evil,\nto draw near to purity and virtue,\nto outwardly conform to human morality,\nto inwardly follow the Supreme One,\nto return to the Buddha’s true essence,\nto unify all dharma,\nto blend with the world while one’s nature emerges like a lotus from water—\nthis is to perfect one’s virtue.\n\nThis is the ultimate clarity of the Dao/Way’s transformations and immortality.\n\n**Heaven’s nature is humanity; humanity’s heart is the mechanism.**\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao/Way is to govern humanity.\n\nHuman nature, from ancient times to now,\nis born, dies, and reborns—\nselling bones, changing forms,\nlike ants circling endlessly,\nnever pausing for an instant.\n\nThe heart’s mechanism shifts daily in myriad ways—\neach with its own cleverness or clumsiness,\nrighteousness or wickedness,\ndepth or shallowness,\nfilial piety or cruelty,\ngenerosity or narrowness,\nlength or brevity,\nclarity or turbidity,\nvirtue or folly,\nlove or hate,\nright or wrong.\nTo discern the heart’s mechanism is to know human nature.\n\nTo establish Heaven’s Dao/Way—\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is foolish,\nfor it does not know the greatness of Heaven’s grace:\nspring’s warmth, summer’s heat,\nautumn’s coolness, winter’s cold—\nthe four seasons transform,\nnurturing all things,\nbenefiting humanity.\nThe wealthy wear silk and feast on delicacies,\nthe poor eat coarse grains and wear rough cloth—\neach finds contentment as they will.\n\nThe Dao/Way arises from things,\nundifferentiated simplicity dispersing into forms,\nadornment for the world—\nlike flowers in full bloom,\nrich as brocade,\nbringing joy to all people.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way governs humanity.\nThe virtuous understand Heaven’s principles,\npracticing them silently,\nspeaking not yet acting rightly,\nresponding with universal virtue without seeking recognition,\nbestowing blessings without expecting reward.\n\nIf one follows Heaven’s Dao/Way,\ntheir virtue governs and benefits humanity.\nWith inner wisdom unfettered,\none comprehends all transformations,\nall dharma,\nall things without attachment,\nall dust without defilement—\nnature harmonizes with fate,\nfate with Heaven,\nHeaven with the Dao/Way,\nthe Dao/Way with Nature.\nTo perfect the Dao/Way within,\nto perfect virtue without—\nthis is the Sage and the virtuous.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes its killing intent,\ndragons and serpents rise from the land.\nWhen humanity unleashes its killing intent,\nHeaven and Earth invert.\n\n**Heaven’s killing intent:**\nWhen warmth reaches its peak, it shifts to coolness,\ncoolness to the metal winds;\nmetal transforms into the winter solstice’s breath,\nall trees wither and fall,\ndragons coil in the deep sea,\nserpents hibernate in hidden caves.\nAt the winter solstice, one yang arises,\ngradually generating harmonious qi,\nuntil the spring equinox, when all things sprout—\ndragons and serpents emerge from their slumber onto the land.\n\n**Humanity’s killing intent:**\nHuman nature is the pure yang radiance of spirit—\nthe heart clings to desires for worldly things,\nto the flames of attachment—\nlove, affection, the seven emotions,\nstriving for fame and gain.\nLost in wine, lust, wealth, and ego,\nendless cravings bind them.\nEach thought of desire belongs to yin.\n\nWhen nature clings to yin,\nbelow, the Kidney Sea’s golden tortoise drains,\nabove, the heavy jade elixir dissipates—\nthe soul wanders, the spirit scatters,\ntrue nature lost.\nWhen external yin flourishes, internal yang decays—\npursuing things leads to death,\nsinking into the ghostly depths.\n\nIf one suddenly awakens to the supreme Dao/Way,\ncomprehending all things’ existence—\nthis is yang destroying yin.\nNature like the bright moon,\nthe heart clear as Heaven,\nten thousand miles without clouds—\nits light shines naturally.\nAll phenomena manifest.\nHumanity’s killing intent scatters all yin,\nnaturally purifying soul and spirit,\nyin and yang inverted—\nHeaven and Earth reverse,\nCreation renews,\nthe Three Elixirs coalesce,\nbreaking free from Heaven and Earth’s shell,\nshedding form to reveal the true body beyond.\n\nHeaven and humanity act in unison—\nall transformations find their foundation.\n\n**Heaven and humanity:**\nHuman nature communicates with Heaven—\nwhen united, the heart is exhausted by things.\nOne who penetrates the illusions of the human world\nknows that honor and disgrace,\nfavor and humiliation,\nsuccess and failure,\ncalamity and fortune,\njoy and sorrow,\nlife and death—\nare the eternal cycles of past and present.\n\nOne who comprehends Heaven’s principles\nexperiences true honor without decay,\ntrue favor without humiliation,\ntrue success without failure,\ntrue fortune without calamity,\ntrue joy without sorrow,\ntrue life without death—\nthis is the constant of the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way is constant yet embraces all transformations,\nestablishing the fundamental nature of existence.\n\nWhen supreme nature is fully realized,\nall transformations naturally harmonize—\nlike the highest goodness in roundness and straightness,\nall streams converging into the Yangtze, Huai, and Ji rivers,\nmerging into the great ocean, blending into one—\nthis is profound comprehension.\n\nNature has its cleverness and clumsiness,\ncapable of concealment.\nThe ancient enlightened ones,\nwith inner nature refined and skillful,\nexternally appeared clumsy and foolish,\nhiding their light—\nlike beautiful jade buried in stone,\nor a pearl nestled in a clam.\n\nBirds differ—\nthe clever parrot speaks,\nyet is caged like an iron dragon;\nthe clumsy dove remains silent,\nsoaring freely among the branches.\nThus, worldly cleverness brings endless calamity,\nwhile true clumsiness brings pure blessings.\n\nTherefore, Heaven acts without speech yet transforms naturally,\nHeaven is without emotion yet never ages.\nHumans must understand Heaven’s Dao/Way—\nto forget speech is to fathom Nature’s mysteries,\nto forget emotion is to grasp eternity’s essence.\n\nHuman desires,\nwhen excessive in cleverness, lead to transgression.\nWhen excessive in emotion, bring suffering.\nTo forget the world and sever attachments\nis the key to joy in the Dao/Way and preserving life.\n\nThe nine orifices’ wickedness\nlies within the three essentials,\ngovernable by stillness and motion.\n\n「The Nine Orifices,\nthe luminous paths of the Nine Passages.\nThose not yet opened,\nare the Nine Yin’s wicked bolts and bars.\n\nThe human heart, a square inch of emptiness,\nyet within holds luminous clarity.\nThe superior person’s heart has nine orifices,\nthe mediocre seven,\nthe inferior five—\na heart devoid of orifices is called a fool.\n\nWicked Yin spawns turbid nature,\nwhile radiant Yang descends to purify the spirit—\nthis depends on the Three Essentials.\nHeaven’s light has the Sun, Moon, and Stars,\nEarth’s treasures hold gold, jade, and rare gems,\nThe Dao’s passage contains lead and mercury’s true essence—\ngovernable by stillness and motion.\nWhen Heaven moves, the Three Lights shine,\nwhen Earth stirs, the Three Treasures manifest,\nwhen luminous clarity arises, the Three Spirits coalesce.\n\nMotion is the movement of form,\nstillness is the stillness of nature.\nThe ancient sages and recluse masters\nmixed with the world yet never moved their hearts,\ndwelt in mountains yet never clung to still forms—\nthey understood the interplay of motion within stillness,\nand stillness within the bustle of life.\nTo forget both motion and stillness,\none attains the Dao’s eternal subtlety.\n\nFire arises from wood,\nand calamity follows, inevitably suppressed.\nDeceit arises within nations,\nand when stirred, it must collapse.\n\nTo know and refine this,\nis to be called a Sage.\n\nFire constantly touches the human heart,\nyet to not fall prey to its endless transformations\nis the essence of human nature.\nWhen thoughts arise without clarity,\nfire consumes the wood of one’s nature—\ncalamity follows, and the auspicious is defied,\nwhile blessings are lost to ruin.\nTo suppress is to slay the true.\n\nDeceit arising within nations,\nthe *Tàishàng Jīng* says:\nNot to govern with cleverness is the nation’s blessing;\nto govern with cleverness is the nation’s thief.\nFlatterers and schemers flourish within nations,\nmaking it difficult for the people to live in peace—\nwhen stirred, they must scatter and dissolve.\nThe foolish, not understanding principle,\nbring chaos to the world,\nand must face punishment by law.\nNot to govern with cleverness,\nbut to govern with no disturbance—\nthis brings great peace and harmony to the people.\n\nTo know and refine this,\nis not the alchemy of burning five metals and eight stones—\nbut to cultivate life and nature,\nto reach principle and penetrate the Mysterious,\nwhich the Three Teachings call *enlightenment in the Dao*.\n\nTo constantly save beings and pity the world,\nto know Heaven’s grace and call it *accumulating virtue*.\nSince the Yellow Emperor’s enlightenment in the Dao,\nthere has been this *Yīnfú Jīng*,\nand in the Zhou era, the Golden Wheel King enlightened to Release,\nthus came the *Jīngāng Jīng*—\nafter attaining Buddhahood,\nhe was named *Shìjiā Móní Buddha*.\nThe *Jīngāng Jīng*’s thirty-two chapters\ndiscuss the Dao, emphasizing the removal of:\nthe *I-relative*,\nthe *person-relative*,\nthe *sentient-being-relative*,\nand the *life-span-relative*.\nWithout these four attachments,\nthe heart bears no transgressions.\n\nLike Heaven without clouds,\nnature as bright as the moon—\nit reveals its perfect, luminous essence.\nNature is like the root of a tree,\nthe body like a person’s form,\nall dharmas like branches and leaves.\nThe *Yīnfú Jīng*’s unfolding of creation,\nis like the blooming of flowers and the bearing of fruit.\nWorldly people studying the Dao,\nclaim they cannot fully grasp its principle—\neach clings to roots, tips, branches, or leaves,\nto blooming flowers or bearing fruit,\neach asserting their own view as right,\nothers’ as wrong.\n\nWith the four attachments,\nthe heart not yet purified—\nthis is called *lateral paths*.\n\nIn the chapter on *enriching nations and securing people*,\nHeaven gives and Heaven takes—\nthis is the Dao’s principle.\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things,\nall things are thieves of humans,\nhumans are thieves of all things’ essence.\nWhen the Three Thieves are harmonized,\nthe Three Talents are at peace.\nHeaven gives and Heaven takes—\nwhen spring’s gentle *qi* warms,\nHeaven nurtures all things;\nwhen autumn’s golden wind stirs,\nall things wither and die—\nHeaven’s taking.\n\nThe principle of giving and taking,\nHeaven acts without emotion yet naturally.\nHeaven and Earth transform through the four seasons,\ncreating all things.\nWithin all things lies the refined *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s Yin and Yang,\nand all things steal this refined *qi*.\nAll things are humans’ thieves—\nhumans steal all things’ brilliance,\nplundering Heaven and Earth’s refined *qi*.\n\nTo extinguish desires and thoughts,\nto preserve clarity and stillness,\nis to guard life.\nHumans are thieves of all things—\nhumans covet all things’ splendor and allure,\neyes feasting on five colors,\nears indulging in five sounds,\ntongues relishing five flavors,\ndrunk on richness, sated on decadence,\nyielding to wickedness and lust,\nlosing life—\njoy to its extreme brings sorrow.\n\nIf one abandons the world and awakens,\nwithout attachment, external things cannot steal.\nWhen the Three Thieves are harmonized,\nthe stolen treasures are boundless—\ncreation’s perfect gems,\npriceless beyond measure.\nWhen the Three Talents are at peace,\none returns to the Three Sages,\nthe Teachings illuminate the Three Vehicles,\nthe Mysterious enlightenment of the Three Emperors,\nthe celestial movement of the Three Lights,\nthe inverted momentum of the Three Chariots,\nthe cultivation of the Three Fields,\nthe alchemical refinement of the Three Fires,\nthe furnace’s formation of the Three Elixirs—\nthe divine manifestation of the Three Yangs,\nascending to the Three Heavens,\ntrue and uncorruptible,\nborn yet never perishing—\nexhausting the Dao of things,\nthe true and the Dao as one body brings peace.\n\nThus it is said:\n*Eat of its time*, and the hundred limbs are in order.\n*Move its mechanism*, and all transformations are secure.\n\nHumans know their spirit’s brilliance as brilliance,\nyet do not know the brilliance of not knowing—\nthis is how brilliance arises.\n\n*Eat of its time*—\nwhen hungry, one meets fine meals yet does not covet,\nencounters coarse food yet does not scorn.\nOne neither slaughters for meat nor refines abstinence,\nbut when hungry, eats without distinction of coarse or fine,\nwhen weary, sleeps,\nwhen idle, hums,\nwhen joyful, recites—\nto sit when one wishes to sit,\nto lie when one wishes to lie,\nto dwell when one wishes to dwell,\nto move when one wishes to move—\nto release the Four Great Elements,\nunbound and free—\nthen the hundred limbs are in order.\n\nWithin the twelve hours,\nconfronted with myriad sights,\none must only keep the true heart ever serene.\nMotion—\none must not let the heart be moved.\nInternally manifesting radiant light,\nresponding to things while the form moves.\n\nMechanism—\nthe Sage calls it *wisdom*,\nthe martial general calls it *strategy*,\nthe common person calls it *mechanism*,\nthe petty calls it *trickery*.\nThe Void Sage acts with profound wisdom,\nworldly people cannot fully comprehend its principle—\nthey hold to subtle cleverness,\nyet speak with ordinary mechanisms.\nThe faithful listen,\nthe virtuous follow,\nall things harmonized and transformed—\nsudden enlightenment brings peace and stillness in the Dao’s birth.\n\nHumans know their spirit’s brilliance as brilliance,\nyet worldly people only know the brilliance of Earth’s Yin spirit—\nthey carve wooden statues and mold clay idols,\ncalling them *spirit*—\nthe foolish do not know.\nEvery transgression committed,\nHeaven brings a corresponding calamity.\nTo slaughter and harm pigs and sheep,\nto burn vast amounts of money and paper,\nto pray—\nwhen sick, one seeks healing,\nwhen in misfortune, one seeks blessings—\nyet they do not know the brilliance of not knowing—\nthis is how brilliance truly arises.»\n\n「People do not know that the Heavenly Yang Dao/Way is most divine, with its energies divided across all directions—\nit subtly observes the virtues and vices of mortals below.\nWhen mortals create virtue for three years,\nHeaven does not wait a thousand days before bestowing blessings and auspiciousness;\nwhen mortals commit evil for a thousand days,\nHeaven does not wait three years before sending calamity.\n\nWorldly people do not know that the most responsive and luminous entity among all things is themselves—\ntheir original spirit/qi (*yuánshén*) penetrates Heaven and Earth with radiant clarity.\nThe sages and worthies of old were all those who attained the Dao/Way and cultivated true essence (*xiùzhēn*),*\ntransforming from the ordinary to the enlightened.\n\nIn the Western lands, from one Buddha to the twenty-eighth lineage,\nbefore the Buddhas cultivated the Way,\nthey were all sentient beings—\nwith pure six senses and bright five eyes,*\nextinguishing the four outward forms,*\nthey were called Buddhas.\n\nThe Buddha is the nature of humanity.\nNature is spirit/qi, spirit/qi is nature—\nonly differing in name.\nThe Buddhist school (*shìmén*) calls nature without the four outward forms a Buddha;\nthe Daoist school (*dàomén*) calls spirit/qi that forgets the four outward forms an Immortal (*xiān*).\n\nThe sun and moon follow their ordained cycles,\ngreat and small have fixed limits.\nFrom this, the sages’ virtues arise,\nand the brilliance of the divine manifests.»\n\n「The sun and moon follow their ordained cycles—\non the summer solstice, daylight lasts sixty *kè* and gradually diminishes,\nas one *yin* begins to form;\non the winter solstice, daylight lasts forty *kè* and gradually increases,\nas one *yang* arises.\nAt the *mǎo* hour, the sun is born from the Eastern Sea,\nand at the *yǒu* hour, it sets behind the Western Mountains.\n\n*The Scripture of Purity and Stillness* states:\n*The Great Dao is without sentiment,*\nyet it governs the sun and moon in their cycles.\nThe sun is the radiant light of wisdom (*huìguāng*) in motion,\nits waxing and waning measured by the Dao’s decree;\nthe moon is the essence of human life (*yīngmìng*).\n\nAt sixteen, a man’s *yin-yang* essence reaches its fullness—\nthe true gold of sixty-four *guà* (hexagrams).\nIf he fails to awaken to the Dao’s lack of sentiment (*wúqíng*),\nthree years pass, and one *liǎng* (unit) of essence diminishes,\nuntil the sixty-four *guà* are exhausted at eighty-eight,\nwhen the kidney sea (*shèn hǎi*) withers away.\nExcessive desire drains the essence prematurely,\ncutting short one’s lifespan;\nrestrained desire preserves it,\nlengthening one’s years.\nWhen fullness turns to depletion (*yíng ér kuī*), death follows;\nwhen perfection remains unbroken (*yuán ér bù quē*), life endures.\nGreat and small have fixed limits—\nthe great is the Dao (*dào*), which encompasses heaven and earth;\nthe small is the subtle (*wēi*), whose mysteries penetrate even the finest hairs.\nIn motion, it transcends heaven and earth’s measure;\nin application, it eludes the perception of spirits and gods.\nYet naturally, it is fixed within the inch-square heart (*fāngcùn*).\nFrom this, the sages’ virtues arise—\nthe Dao of heaven.\n\nHeaven’s great grace (*yīngmìng*) is born,\nnourishing humanity and sustaining form.\nThe Dao’s virtues arise, saving people and cultivating true essence (*xiūzhēn*).\nThe divine brilliance (*shénmíng*) manifests—\nhidden, it roams through the Three Palaces (*sāngōng*);\nrevealed, it permeates the Eight Extremes (*bābiāo*).\nIts stolen mechanism (*dàoqì*) is unseen by all under heaven,\nunknowable by all under heaven.\nThe virtuous one attains it and endures poverty (*gùqióng*);\nthe petty one seizes it and risks his life (*qīngmìng*).\nIts stolen mechanism is the mechanism of all things.\nWhat is stolen is the *qi* of heaven and earth—\nunseen by all under heaven,\nunknowable even by heaven’s great grace (*yīngmìng*).\n\nThe foolish know only that they can nourish their own bodies,\nyet fail to recognize heaven’s bestowed grace (*tiānchuí’ēn*) that nurtures all people.\nSpring planting, autumn harvest,\nsummer gathering, winter storing—\nin response to the seasons, frost and snow, rain and dew,\nthey foster and enrich all transformations.\nThose who understand heaven’s grace (*tiān’ēn*) possess a nature that is clear and penetrating (*tōngmíng*).\n\nThe virtuous one attains it and endures poverty,\nfor poverty leads to the Dao (*qióng tōngdào*).\nWhen the Dao is understood, heaven and earth become transparent (*tiāndì tōng*).\nWhen heaven and earth are transparent, all transformations are clear (*wànhuà tōng*).\nWhen all transformations are clear, the divine is luminous (*shéntōng*).\nThe divine luminous responds to all mechanisms (*yìngjī qī wànbiàn*),\nembracing unity without separation (*bàoyī wúlí*).\nThus, he rests in perfection (*zànrán yízhēn*), returning to the origin.\n\nThe petty one seizes it and risks his life,\nfor when the petty one gains it, he deceives heaven and earth,\ndisrespects the virtuous and the wise,\nignores the laws of the land,\nlacks benevolence and righteousness,\nstrengthens himself while weakening others,\nharms creatures and injures people.\nWhen his crimes reach their extreme (*qiānjí*), heaven’s retribution follows.\n\nThe virtuous one values nature and attains communion with the wise and the divine (*tōngxiánshèng*);\nthe petty one risks his life and falls into the fate of lesser beings (*bàngshēng*).\n\n---\n**On the Chapter of Military Strategy and the Art of Victory**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing,\nthe deaf excel in sight.\nCutting off one source of profit (*jué lì yī yuán*),\none’s teacher’s (*shī*) effectiveness is tenfold;\nturning back three times through day and night (*sān fǎn zhòuyè*),\none’s teacher’s effectiveness is ten-thousandfold.\n\nThe blind excel in hearing—\nthe human moon is the window through which the five *zàng* (viscera) perceive.\nWhen the *fēng* (wind) circulates, it reveals external things.\nLike a breeze through paper screens,\nseparated as if by the blind,\nexternal things cannot be seen.\nWhen external sights do not enter within,\nthe void within holds true resonance and clarity—\nthus, the blind hear the soundless sound.\n\nThe deaf excel in sight—\nyet when the world’s coarse *qi* reaches the ears, it is like deafness;\nwhen Daoist reflection reaches the ears, even hearing perverse speech is like deafness.\nSelecting the proper principle (*zhènglǐ*), the ear’s aperture becomes clear.\nLike light piercing through a drilled wall,\nillumination enters within.\nSeeing the formless form,\none attains the marvel of indistinct clarity (*mínghuǎng*).\nCutting off one source of profit,\none forgets greed and achieves purity (*wàngtān ér qīngpíng*).\nIt also extinguishes profit and hoards no wealth,\nreducing excess while benefiting deficiency (*sǔnyǔ ér huì bùzú*).\nOne’s teacher’s effectiveness is tenfold—\nuntil one attains full clarity (*zhànmíng*), tenfold the merit.\nNurturing creatures and loving people,\none gains tenfold blessings.\n\nTurning back three times through day and night—\nthe first reversal is at the *shàngyuán* (upper solstice), bestowing grace (*cìfú*).\nThe *qi* descends, and clarity arises.\nThe second reversal is at the *zhōngyuán* (middle solstice), absolving sins (*shèzuì*).\nThe divine shifts, and its power becomes luminous (*shén yì ér líng*).\nThe third reversal is at the *xiàyuán* (lower solstice), dissolving calamity and connecting fate (*jiě è mìngtōng*).\nThe *yin* transforms

      "translated_text": "**Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Yellow Emperor’s *Yin Fu Jing***.\nComposed by **Changshengzi Liu Chu Xuan**, completed in the **Jin Zhangjing year of Mingchang, the Year of the Ox (1191)**.\nOne volume.\nSource: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Orthodox Daoist Canon of the Ming Dynasty), **Dongzhen** (Cavernly True) section, **Yu Jue** (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yin Fu Jing* Commentary**\n\nThe *True Classic of Yin Fu* contains over three hundred characters—its words are few yet its meaning profound, its text deep yet its principles complete. The Dao/Way of life and death’s subtle mechanisms, the principles of yin and yang’s transformation and generation, all wondrous applications and authentic powers, are encompassed and summarized within. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor, amid his myriad affairs, attained profound silence and emptiness, and through this, he encountered the True Classic. On **Kongtong Mountain**, he questioned the **Celestial Sovereign of Truth** and **Master Guangcheng**, gaining their essential insights. Diligent in practice, he one day ascended to Heaven by riding the **Fire Dragon** from **Ding Lake**, and thus the Dao/Way was passed down to the world. Later practitioners who sought immortality and embraced the Dao/Way, those who could silently perceive its mysteries and deeply cultivate its realms, often raised themselves high and far, ascending with the shadows and rising into the void—such achievements were not few.\n\nYet across countless ages, none directly annotated or explained this text, revealing its true meaning. All merely employed flowery metaphors and oblique allusions, leaving its authentic source concealed. Thus, students became entangled in endless branches, their doubts persisting even to old age, their labor yielding no fruit. The more they sought, the more confused they grew, abandoning their path halfway—such cases are innumerable. Consequently, many deemed the Daoist classics as empty words, a fate most lamentable.\n\n**True Person Liu, the Immortal of the Divine Peak**, instructed **Law Order and the Vessel** (器). **Master Liu**, whose vast talents spanned antiquity and modernity, whose mind wandered through the Dao of Virtue and Power, pondered deeply and refined his understanding. He delved into profound mysteries and explored hidden truths, annotating this text with clarity and openness, making it easily known and practiced for the benefit of future generations. Truly, he was a compassionate and virtuous scholar.\n\n**Graduate Bishou from Jinan**, whose name was **Zhenyi**, wrote this preface, intending to spread the text far and wide as a guide for students. Those who carefully examine this work may awaken from doubt, resolve confusion, and all attain liberation from the dusty entanglements of the world. They may directly enter the realm of True Dao/Way, wandering freely in the boundless expanse.\n\nOn the **twenty-second day of the second lunar month in the Year of the Ox (1191)**, **Fan Zhenyude**, the **Learning Official of Ninghai Prefecture**, prefaced this text.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Dao/Way of the Embracing-One Immortals**\n\nTo **observe the Dao/Way of Heaven** and **hold fast to Heaven’s actions**, is to attain completeness. To **observe** is to **perfect the Five Eyes** (五眼) and attain clarity. When one’s **Heavenly Eye** (天眼), **Palm of Wisdom Eye** (慧眼), **Dharma Eye** (法眼), **Dao/Way Eye** (道眼), and **Divine Eye** (神眼) are all radiant and piercing, the **Five Aggregates** (五蕴) dissolve into emptiness, and one perceives the **Heavenly Dao/Way**.\n\nWithin Heaven lies the **Heaven Beyond Heaven** (天外天), above the earth. **Pure Qi** (清炁) is Heaven—its loftiest realm extends **eighty-four thousand li** (至高八万四千里), the **Highest Heaven** (高天). In the human body, each receives a portion of Heaven’s Qi; the Qi varies in thickness. If it is **harmonious and balanced**, one becomes a **sage or worthy**; if it is **contrary and dispersed**, one descends into the realm of ghosts.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** is the **formless essence** beyond Heaven and Earth, the **source of all ten thousand things**. In the human body, if one **glimpses the boundless expanse** with a **mind of emptiness**, then one’s **innate nature** (至性) aligns harmoniously with the Dao/Way.\n\nTo **hold fast** means to **guard the True** while rejecting the false, to **awaken to the Right** while avoiding the perverse.\n\n**Heaven** refers to Heaven’s **generative power** over all things. Heaven generates all things yet does not **hoard or take** them back; it benefits the **ten directions, the Three Realms, and all beings**, yet does not expect repayment. It merely wishes that all beings **awaken to and fully comprehend** the principles of Heaven. One must **neither hate nor love** all things, maintaining the **equality of Heaven**.\n\nWhen humans, who possess **emotion**, comprehend Heaven’s **lack of emotion**, they fulfill their **gratitude to Heaven**. If one does not follow the **principles of Heaven**, even if one indulges in **filth, evil, licentiousness, and depravity**, one will suffer **disease, early death, and untimely demise**, descending into the **Hell Realms** and enduring **exhaustive suffering**. Then one falls into the **animal realm**, losing one’s human form.\n\nIf one follows **Heaven’s singular Dao/Way**, **constant goodness** brings **harmonious Qi**; **constant purity** refines one’s **innate nature**; **constant detachment from emotion** preserves one’s **life-force**; **constant freedom from defilement** clarifies the Dao/Way; and **constant non-transgression of Heaven’s laws** ensures **no guilt**.\n\nWithout cultivating **worldly blessings**, one **embraces the Dao/Way** and preserves its **authentic essence**. **Blessings do not cling to minor, external methods**; one **suddenly comprehends the principle of Non-Action** (無為), and all **laws** (萬法) are thereby **fully liberated** across the Three Realms.\n\nHeaven has **Five Thieves** (五贼)—those who see them flourish. The **Five Thieves** are not the **worldly bandits** nor the **human Six Thieves** (六贼), but what kind of thieves are they?\n\nHeaven’s **Five Rectifying Qi** (五方正炁) reside within the human body as the **mother of the spirit**. The **Celestial Cycle’s twelve hours** naturally **withdraw, supplement, and revolve**, their **limitless subtlety** termed **Non-Action** (無). Within this cycle, **Heaven and Earth transmit yin and yang**, **refined Qi** (秀炁) generates in all things, and humans consume **the Five Grains**, nourishing their **physical form** yet harboring **filth and impurity**. They are **immersed in water and fire**, and the **essence of the Five Grains** in the human body, if preserved, becomes **life-force**.\n\nWhen **life-force** (命) aligns with **innate nature** (性), one’s lifespan extends; when **innate nature** harmonizes with **life-force**, one’s vitality flourishes. **Life-force** is like the **tortoise of the Northern Sea** (北海之乌龟), which **Master Ding** (丁翁) constantly holds to form its shape. The **Five Thieves** are the **True Yang** (真阳). When Heaven’s **True Yang** encounters its **True Yin** (真阴), the **Five Thieves** steal the **treasure of the Northern Sea**. Those who **guard this treasure** flourish, just as all beings and humans are **plundered by thieves**.\n\nThe **Five Thieves** dwell in the heart; their actions extend to Heaven. The **cosmos lies within one’s grasp**, and **all transformations arise from the body**. The **Five Thieves** in the heart are the **disordered Five Phases** (五行颠倒). Within the heart, **True Water** (真水) ascends—if **contrary**, the **heart’s orifices are blocked**, and **Kidney Water** (肾水) descends, leading to **the path of death**. All who do not follow the **Dao/Way of the Sages** are thus.\n\nThe **ancient enlightened sages** often spoke of the Dao/Way in varied terms, while the **common folk** each cling to their own limited perceptions, distinguishing between **high and low** paths.",

wall,\nillumination enters within.\nSeeing the formless form,\none attains the marvel of indistinct clarity (*mínghuǎng*).\nCutting off one source of profit,\none forgets greed and achieves purity (*wàngtān ér qīngpíng*).\nIt also extinguishes profit and hoards no wealth,\nreducing excess while benefiting deficiency (*sǔnyǔ ér huì bùzú*).\nOne’s teacher’s effectiveness is tenfold—\nuntil one

the *shàngyuán* (upper solstice), bestowing grace (*cìfú*).\nThe *qi* descends, and clarity arises.\nThe second reversal is at the *zhōngyuán* (middle solstice), absolving sins (*shèzuì*).\nThe divine shifts, and its power becomes luminous (*shén yì ér líng*).\nThe third reversal is at the *xiàyuán* (lower solstice), dissolving calamity and connecting fate (*jiě è mìngtōng*).\nThe *yin* transforms into *yang*.\n\nOne’s teacher’s effectiveness is ten-thousandfold—\nfor when the world engages in commerce,\nall suffer countless hardships,\nyet even doubling their profit is difficult.\nAwakening to the Dao and cultivating true essence (*wùdào xiūzhēn*),\none preserves his nature and life (*quán qí xìngmìng*),\nattaining boundless blessings and longevity (*fúshòu*).\nHe dwells in the Immortal’s Palace (*xiāngōng*), rich in treasures (*bǎosuǒ*),\nreceives heaven’s honors and earth’s nobility (*shòu tiānshàng fùguì*).\nBy analogy, when one seeks blessings and profit,\nhe attains ten-thousandfold—\ntransforming the sea into mulberry fields,\ndwelling eternally in the land of endless day (*bùyè zhī xiāng*),\nwhere true joy surpasses even ten-thousandfold profit.\n\n---\nThe mind is born from things,\ndies from things—\nthe mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe mind is born from things,\nattaching to external forms;\nit dies from the mind—\nfor death is communion with the spirit-form (*língwù*).\nSeeking life leads one’s nature into the path of death (*xìng guī sǐlù*),\nwhile attaining the Dao guards death (*shǒu sǐ*),\nand the divine roams the path of life (*shén yóu shēnglù*).\nThe Dao’s life and the world’s life,\nthe Dao’s death and the world’s death,\nare contrary in form.\n\nThe mechanism lies in external sights—\nthe eyes perceive things,\nand the mind stirs at the mechanism.\nProfit brings harm,\ngreed invites conflict.\nThe enlightened eyes see spirit-forms (*língwù*),\ndiscerning heaven’s mechanisms (*tiānqì*).\nUnderstanding the Dao’s subtle essence (*dào yào miào*),\none transcends the duality of self and other (*wùwǒ jù míng*).\n\nWorldly mechanisms benefit oneself,\nyet harm others;\nDaoist mechanisms harm oneself,\nyet benefit others.\nHeaven’s grace is without grace,\nyet great grace arises.\n\nSwift thunder and fierce winds\nmove all things in their course (*mòbù shǔnrán*).\nHeaven’s grace is without possession—\nit disperses *qi* to give birth to things,\nyet does not claim them.\nYet great grace arises,\nas all things flourish in their formation (*wànwù shēngchéng*).\nWithout heaven and earth’s *qi*,\nall things cannot manifest and take form (*zàohuà*).\nHeaven’s great grace, though without possession,\nis like grace without expectation of return (*tiān bù wàng qí bào*).\nHuman grace, when seen, expects return (*rén huì jiàn qí yǒu*).\nHeaven’s grace and human grace differ.\n\nSwift thunder roars, and sweet rain descends—\nheaven and earth sprout with life;\nfierce winds stir, and floating clouds disperse—\nten thousand miles of clear sky.\nAll things move in their course (*shǔnrán*).\nThis movement abandons the lifeless (*shě líng*),\nfor creatures born of eggs, seeds, or dampness (*péiluǎn shīhuà*)\nall receive heaven’s singular *qi* to manifest.\nHow much more so for all things that are formless and lifeless?\n\n---\nThe utmost joy lies in nature’s excess (*xìngyú*),\nthe

mirror,\nwhat hindrance are the forms and shadows of things?\n\nYet there are those who, failing to penetrate the middle path,\nmistake fleeting stillness for ultimate truth—\ndiscarding the real for the illusory,\nclinging to nothingness while rejecting all.\nThey boast of Dao’s subtleties like weeds in the world.\n\nAs the *Tàishàng Dàodéjīng* says:\n*\"The virtuous do not speak beautifully,\nthe beautiful do not speak virtuously.\"*\nTrue Daoist speech is unadorned,\nwhile false teachings dazzle with ornament.\nThose who love beauty’s clarity\nare ensnared by deceit,\nunable to reach the Great Way.\n\nHeaven’s utmost privacy is its utmost fairness.\nHeaven bestows its grace unseen—\nthe utmost privacy;\nyet its nurturing sustains the world—\nthe utmost fairness.\n\nThe Daoist is like jade hidden in stone:\nthe world’s dull eyes see no treasure,\nyet with ceaseless polishing, one day\nthe work is complete—\na body beyond the body,\ncrude clay refined into a noble vessel.\n\nThe unenlightened are like rotten wood:\nHeaven’s eye sees the axe and saw,\nand in an instant, decay consumes them—\ntheir souls scattered, their filth trapped in darkness forever.\n\nIn a degenerate age, the Daoist endures hardship,\nyet sweetness follows suffering;\nthe wicked reap ruin,\nas calamities descend upon them.\n\nHeaven’s will reverses the perverse,\nand aligns the upright.\nThe sage above reveres virtue and the Dao—\nHeaven’s reward is swift, private yet public.\nThe petty below compete for wealth and desire—\nHeaven’s retribution is first public, then private.\n\nThe nature of birds lies in *qi*.\nAmong all birds, the South Mountain’s crimson phoenix prevails.\nIt absorbs the light, clear *qi*—\nits spirit soars into the ninth heaven.\nWhen *qi* is turbid, it sinks to earth;\nwhen pure, it ascends to heaven—\ndescending from the low to rise with the clear.\n\nThe tortoise draws from the Northern Sea’s *yuan qi*,\nexhaling eight hundred and ten *zhang* of light, pure essence—\nthe ninefold yang number.\nThe bird’s three-inch *chōnghé* aligns with *yuan qi*,\nnever dispersing.\n*Qi* communicates with spirit,\nspirit with the Dao,\nthe Dao

life.\n\nThe deluded hoard worldly treasures by day,\nyet lose their inner essence by night;\nthe awakened forget the world,\ndreaming while guarding their true self within.\n\nGrace arises from

self-nourishing,\ntheir guiltless nature invites Heaven’s abundant grace.\n\nWhen people are filthy and wicked,\nHeaven and Earth bring calamity.\nWhen people are pure and good,\nthe sages bestow blessings.\n\nAll beings on Earth persist in unrepentant deeds.\nPraying to sages cannot escape ten thousand calamities.\nThe Chinese people, male and female, revere the true with resolve—\nthey do
