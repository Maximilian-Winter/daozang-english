Way\n*One scroll.* Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang* (Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity), *Tongzhen* (Penetrating the True) Section, *Rites of Majesty* Category.\n\n**Ritual Procedure as Prescribed**\n*Humbly invoking the Most High Supreme Person of the Great Extremity and Great Void:*\n\nThe forms of yin and yang are complete,\nThe shapes of heaven and earth are divided,\nDay and night differ in their nature,\nAnd twilight and dawn are distinct in their brilliance.\n\nThus, the pure and refined *qi* ascends,\nThe Nine Heavens become the abode of the Immortal Ancestors;\nThe turbid and dense *qi* descends,\nThe Nine Earths become the domain of the spirits and ghosts.\n\nAbove the Nine Heavens, the yin *qi* dissolves entirely;\nBelow the Nine Earths, the yang light is forever severed.\nHence, the realm of darkness is without illumination.\nAt the time of daylight, it is still like dense fog;\nWhen twilight falls, the gloom is even more profound.\n\nIn endless night, there is no way to dispel the murk,\nAnd thus one may sink into the Northern Prison,\nSuffer retribution in the *Tangdu* (Domain of the Dark),\nNever behold the light,\nAnd endure torment for countless *kalpas* (eons).\n\nTherefore, the Celestial Sovereign, through the Dao’s boundless power,\nEmits vast compassion,\nKindles the Nine Prison Lamps,\nAnd rescues the suffering souls of the deep waters.\n\nThe radiant light descends to illuminate,\nDispelling the dim and murky paths of the Northern Prison;\nThe harmonious *qi* subtly penetrates,\nMelting the frozen rivers of the cold hills.\n\nThe Three Officials and the Nine Departments of the Hundred and Twenty Tribunals,\nThe Five Emperors, the Examiners of Retribution, and the Great Heavenly Warrior-Messengers,\nAll together receive the sacred teachings and precepts,\nAnd liberate the departed souls.\n\nNone fail to bow in reverence and take refuge,\nRespectfully accepting the benevolent instruction.\n\nThus, the winds and thunders cease,\nThe *tongzhu* (copper pillars) of torment stand idle.\nThe flames of wind and sword,\nSurrounding the lotus flower, bestow sweet *ganlu* (dew of grace);\nThe spears of ice and blades of frost,\nTransform into *qi shu* (wondrous trees), becoming fragrant *jiǎnlín* (bamboo groves).\n\nAll follow the fruit of their deeds to be reborn,\nAnd return to the Dao with enlightened hearts.\nThe Nine Earths and the dark prisons are emptied,\nNo wrongs remain unresolved;\nTogether ascending to the Celestial Path and the Immortal Way,\nAll attain the fruit of liberation.\n\nBlessings extend to both the hidden and the manifest,\nJoy reaches future generations.\nThe virtues and merits are immense and boundless,\nUnsurpassed in measure.\n\nDare we rely on the assembly,\nTo jointly extol their glory.\n\n**The Golden Talisman of the Upper Element’s Sacred Text**\nWith the true and exalted rank of the Immortals,\nThe ritual of the Lamp of Majesty is most solemn.\nNow, the *Zhai Guan* (Ritual Officer) of a certain name,\nConstructs the Yellow Talisman Hall of Treasures,\nAnd simultaneously lights the Nine Lamps of the Dark Realms,\nTo offer posthumous veneration for the departed soul of a certain deceased person.\n\n*Humbly beseeching the officials of the Wind and Thunder Prisons and all dark judges:*\nExtend boundless compassion,\nGrant universal liberation.\n\n*May the black winds vanish,*\n*The thunderbolts cease their roar,*\n*The flying spears and whirling blades of torment be extinguished,*\n*And no limbs be severed.*\n\nThat the dark prisons may shine with brilliance,\nThe prisons of the Nine Earths be purified,\nAnd the departed souls be liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of the Eastern Wind and Thunder Prisons,*\nAll talismans and sacred commands are hereby solemnly declared.\n\n*Proclaiming the Jade Treasure Celestial Sovereign,*\nWhose exalted title resounds through the Ten Directions,\nWhose repentance descends to the Nine Dark Realms.\nThe lamp’s light illuminates the East,\nDispelling the gloom of the Wind and Thunder Prisons.\n\nA thousandfold torment of flying spears,\nA myriadfold agony of severed limbs.\nThrough this repentance and illumination,\nThey attain birth in the heavens,\nAnd behold this lamp’s light in the heavenly realm.\n\n*In harmony

lamp’s radiance shines upon the Southwest,\nDissolving the torments of the Butchery Prisons.\nBlades and swords that rend the flesh—unbearable agony,\nEndless suffering through countless kalpas.\nYet the lamp’s light pierces the abyss,\nLiberating all lost souls to celestial realms.\n\n*In harmony with the inconceivable merits.*\n\n**The Golden Talisman Scriptures of the Upper Element,**\nOf true Daoist rank and solemn lamp rites,\nWhose rituals are most weighty.\nNow, the officiant [name] constructs the Yellow Talisman Hall,\nKindling the Nine Dark Lamps of the Netherworld,\nTo solemnly enshrine and commend the departed [name], body and spirit.\n\nWith reverence, to the officials of the Iron Mountain Prisons,\nBestowing boundless compassion,\nExtending universal deliverance.\nMay the condemned be freed from suspension,\nEscape the grinding of a million blades,\nTheir Three Souls cleansed in the Five Palaces,\nTheir Seven Spirits intact in the Four Limbs.\nThus, their netherworldly prisons shall shine,\nThe prisons purified,\nThe lost souls liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of the Western Iron Mountain Prisons,*\nAll talismans and sacred commands are hereby solemnly declared.\n\n---\n\n**Invocation of the Most Mysterious and Supreme Sovereign**\nWith devout aspiration, worshipping the ten directions,\nThe Great Compassionate One who hears the cries of suffering.\nGuiding the lamp’s light toward the West,\nThe Iron Mountain Prisons are utterly shattered and released.\nAll torments of iron hammers and rods,\nBy the Dao’s power, now cease entirely.\nThe Heavenly Sovereign rescues suffering souls,\nGranting rebirth in celestial realms as desired.\n\n*In harmony with the inconceivable merits.*\n\n**The Golden Talisman Scriptures of the Upper Element,**\nOf true Daoist rank and solemn lamp rites,\nWhose rituals are most weighty.\nNow, the officiant [name] constructs the Yellow Talisman Hall,\nKindling the Nine Dark Lamps of the Netherworld,\nTo solemnly enshrine and commend the departed [name], body and spirit.\n\nWith reverence, to the officials of the Fire Chariot Prisons,\nBestowing boundless compassion,\nExtending universal deliverance.\nMay the wheels of the Five Chariots be detached,\nThe fierce flames extinguished,\nThe prison officials grant mercy,\nThe departed ascend to bliss.\nThus, their netherworldly prisons shall shine,\nThe prisons purified,\nThe lost souls liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of the Western Fire Chariot Prisons,*\nAll talismans and sacred commands are hereby solemnly declared.\n\n---\n\n**Invocation of the Boundless Taihua Sovereign**\nTaking refuge and paying homage to the Three Realms above,\nThe Boundless Sovereign who liberates sins from the Nine Abysses.\nThis lamp’s flame dispels the darkness,\nHalting the revolving wheels of the Fire Chariot Prisons.\nThe Five Chariots rend limbs and scatter bodies,\nEach wheel and blade in torment.\nThus, through endless kalpas, suffering persists—\nYet at the sight of this light, all are liberated.\n\n*In harmony with the inconceivable merits.*\n\n**The Golden Talisman Scriptures of the Upper Element,**\nOf true Daoist rank and solemn lamp rites,\nWhose rituals are most weighty.\nNow,

all be granted ascension,\nThe starving and cold find nourishment and warmth.\nThus, their netherworldly prisons shall shine,\nThe prisons purified,\nThe lost souls liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of the Northern Mingling Cold Prisons,*\nAll talismans and sacred commands are hereby solemnly declared.\n\n---\n\n**Invocation of the Supreme Celestial Jade Dawn Sovereign**\nProstrating and declaring homage to the Three Pure Ones,\nThe Compassionate Sovereign who responds to pleas and rescues suffering.\nBeholding this lamp’s light illuminate the North,\nThe Mingling Cold Prisons are entirely dissolved.\nAll sins of ice and cold,\nAt the sound of the sacred name, cease their torment.\nThe Heavenly Sovereign pities and saves the lost,\nEarly beholding the light to attain pure realms.\n\n*In harmony with the inconceivable merits.*\n\n**The Golden Talisman Scriptures of the Upper Element,**\nOf true Daoist rank and solemn lamp

blessings,\nThe prison masters store auspiciousness,\nThe cauldrons turn to cool clarity,\nThe seething pots transform into sweet dew.\nThus, their netherworldly prisons shall shine,\nThe prisons purified,\nThe lost souls liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of the Northeastern Boiling Cauldron Prisons,*\nAll talismans and sacred commands are hereby solemnly declared.\n\n---\n\n**Invocation of the Supreme Daoist Sovereign of Transcendence**\nKowtowing in homage to the Great Luo Realm,\nThe Original Sovereign who responds to all circumstances.\nUnceasing in compassion, descending to the Daoist hall,\nGuiding this lamp’s light toward the Northeast.\nMay the boiling cauldrons cease their seething,\nThe limbs, though rotting, be

the Sword Wheels.\nThus, their netherworldly prisons shall shine,\nThe prisons purified,\nThe lost souls liberated,\nAscending swiftly to the realm of light.\n\n*Devoutly repenting the calamities of
