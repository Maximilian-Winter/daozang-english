Great Method**\n**Scroll One: Elucidating the Great Dao (Chapter One)**\n\nThe Master said: The Dao originally has no name, nor does it have form.\nThe marvel of the Dao is born before Heaven;\nIts principle abides after Heaven.\nIts teachings were first established in the degenerate age.\n\nFor the Dao cannot be sought through form and traces,\nNor can it be attained through sound and color.\nAll people, from birth, are endowed with this Dao.\nThus, if one’s cultivation and perseverance are steadfast and enduring, ascension may be hoped for.\n\nYet those unlearned do not awaken to the true essence.\nIn their daily lives, they are constantly mired in the dust and clamor,\nWillingly drowning in the sea of right and wrong, emotions and desires,\nAdrift and sinking, unable to extricate themselves.\n\nThus, the sagely masters, pitying those benighted and unable to comprehend,\nThought it better to guide and lead them forward—hence the rise of teachings and methods.\nThough the Daoist methods may not yet enable one to ascend to the True,\nThey may still be used to seek the True.\nThough they may not yet enable one to attain the Dao,\nThey may still be used to enter the Dao.\n\nYet sentient beings, unaware of the compassionate intent to guide them,\nAssume the Great Dao is merely these teachings and methods.\nThus, they often abandon the true to pursue the false, forsaking the root to chase the branches.\nHow could they know that the Dao resides within themselves?\nIf one grasps its essential principles and cultivates them over time, one may attain the True.\n\nOnce my true primordial essence is accomplished,\nThere will be surplus to supplement what is lacking,\nAnd all that is practiced will become the Dao.\nIf one does not know the secrets of cultivating the True,\nBut merely engages in the toil of practicing methods,\nReceiving unclear instruction and clinging to words on paper,\nOne drifts ever farther from the Dao.\n\nThus, the sagely masters’ intent is to first cultivate the self,\nAnd only then can one command ghosts and spirits.\nIf one does not know that cultivation lies within oneself,\nBut merely relies on submitting memorials and petitions for retribution,\nOr on breath and movement for command,\nThe heart grows ever more deluded, the effects ever more distant,\nOne’s true essence daily dissipates, one’s true vitality daily wanes.\n\nThose who inherit these teachings must prioritize enlightenment,\nTaking cultivation as the foundation.\nHow could one then worry about being unable to practice the methods?\n\nThe Dao within me can be fully expressed in a single word;\nYet to extend it and transform others cannot be completed in a single word.\nNow, the oral instructions of the true masters are set forth below,\nSo that learners may easily trace the source.\nIf the Dao is already awakened, then these words are but the trap and snare.\nFor the unenlightened, one must rely on written expressions—\nThus it is said: \"Without scripture, none can be delivered.\"\n\nThe Jade Hall is the natural formation of primordial *qi* into a hall within the Jade Capital Mountain.\nWithin it dwell the Nine Venerable Elders, born of the *qi* of Radiant Clarity.\nThe mountain is bathed in golden light, never darkening;\nThe nine *qi* flourish eternally—this is called the Realm of Jade Purity.\nThus, this teaching emerged from the Jade Capital Mountain, hence the name \"Jade Hall.\"\n\nYet the marvels of the Jade Capital and the Jasper Hall,\nThe mystery of the Nine Venerable Primordial Lords,\nFar lie in the lofty and luminous heavens,\nNear lie within the heavens of one’s own body.\n\nThose who inherit the Jade Hall are companions of Heaven—\nAnd Heaven’s companionship is none other than the Three Luminaries.\nThus, the true masters internally cultivate the Three Luminaries to accomplish the Dao,\nAnd externally employ the Three Luminaries to create talismans.\n\nFor the marvel of the Three Luminaries:\nHeaven obtains it and endures forever;\nHumans follow it and ascend to the True.\nThus, spreading the radiance of the Three Luminaries can cure the world’s illnesses;\nUnleashing the dharmic power of the Three Luminaries can command ghosts and spirits;\nProclaiming the majestic virtue of the Three Luminaries can eradicate demonic and numinous disturbances;\nDescending the wisdom and illumination of the Three Luminaries can open the netherworld.\n\nThough the methods of the Three Luminaries are simple,\nTheir practice lies within oneself, boundless and inexhaustible.\nNow, learners must unite the Three Luminaries within their bodies\nWith the Three Luminaries in Heaven.\nOnly then can one be called a master.\n\nTo inherit the teachings, first compare one’s body to Heaven and Earth, aligning the mysterious Dao with the primordial beginning of the original kalpa—this is Heaven’s Great Ultimate. One must then reflect: what is the Great Ultimate within oneself? After Heaven and Earth divided, they took form, just as one’s body does. Knowing that one’s body parallels Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth endure eternally while the sun and moon revolve, while one’s body is subject to unceasing birth and death—if one wishes to match Heaven’s longevity, one must ponder: by what Dao do Heaven and Earth endure? By what Dao do immortals and transcendents endure? And by what causes does the human body undergo birth and death? When these are comprehended within, the Dao of immortality is attained.\n\nThe Master says: The wondrous Dao values emptiness and nothingness; the ancient Dao prioritizes simplicity and plainness. Today’s Dao is neither simple nor plain, nor is it empty and nothing. All elaborate rituals, intricate verses, and recitations—these only distance one further from the Dao in this age. Those who seek the Dao must move from complexity to simplicity, from superficiality to plainness, and from simplicity and plainness ascend to emptiness and nothingness. Only then can one explore the mystery within the mystery.\n\nPurity of mind is called *zhai* (fasting); restraint of the self is called *jie* (precepts). Today, people’s minds are mired in the mundane, and they call eating coarse grains and vegetables *zhai*—this is not merit or virtue, but a misunderstanding. Only by severing all worldly affairs and ceasing to dwell on them can the mind wander with Heaven, the spirit merge with *qi*, and within movement and stillness, creation and transformation fuse as one. Ghosts and spirits respond—this is what is meant by practicing the method.\n\nWhat does *xingchi* (practice and perseverance) entail? *Xing* means advancing without cease—entering the path of longevity, ascending the gate of true immortality, and enduring without weariness. *Chi* means grasping firmly and enduring, like holding an object in hand, determined not to let it fall. The ancients practiced by first rectifying their own deviations. Today, people practice while their corporeal deviations remain unexpunged, making it easy for external deviations to enter. To seek control over ghosts and spirits thus becomes difficult. If one can maintain a single-minded resolve, in stillness and concentration, responding with the true to the true—this is the subtlety of *xingchi*.\n\nWhen writing talismans, first enter the chamber, burn incense, and sit in silence for a long while. Once *qi* settles and the spirit is at ease, knock the teeth and circulate the energy, unifying heart and talisman, talisman and heart as one. The eastern radiance requires no turning of the head; the exhalation of *qi* should not produce sound. Grinding ink and applying cinnabar should be as if wielding golden and silver light. When dipping the brush and writing, only luminous clarity should be seen. The circulation of intent should not be sluggish—one stroke reveals all that precedes. The incantation lies in the voice of the heart, precisely when writing the talisman. With a mind unstained by external defilements, write the talisman as if transmitting one’s own spirit. Upon completion, circulate *qi* and bestow the mudra.\n\nFor talismans that expel evil, circulate one’s own fierce *qi*; for talismans that deliver and save, circulate the natural, life-giving *qi* of Heaven. The subtlety lies not in outward form but in the secret circulation of *qi*. The use of seals in practice serves to discipline the mind and body. Later generations, lacking understanding, exhaust their minds and bodies. The ancients sealed with the heart; today, people seal with wood. The establishment of ritual seals serves to govern the duties of the method, so that when one holds the seal, there is a place of refuge, and when one impresses it, there is a hierarchy of submission. Those who inherit the teachings must possess the Three Seals—these must not be treated lightly.\n\nBefore enlightenment, one relies on wooden seals; after enlightenment, only the seal of the heart remains. Thus it is said: Heaven has its seal, and the Three Luminaries are thereby ordered. Humans have their seal, and the chamber of the spirit is thereby clarified. The seal lies within oneself—why rely on external objects? When no external object is relied upon, it is called *tongxuan* (penetrating the mystery). The mystery within the mystery—this is the subtlety of the Dao.\n\nThe method of drawing *qi* lies in the Three Luminaries. To draw the *qi* of the Three Luminaries, one must unite the true with the true. Today, people do not understand the method of drawing *qi*—they merely turn their heads upward, inhale cold *qi*, and exhale warm *qi*. Yet the Three Luminaries in Heaven are exceedingly distant; a single breath cannot truly capture them. Little do they know that one’s own Three Luminaries reside within the body, not far away, requiring no laborious inhalation to naturally endure. The key lies in circulating one’s own true *qi* and gathering it—thus, one need not labor to absorb external *qi*.\n\nThe Master says: Unite the heart with the spirit, and the spirit with nothingness. The method of pacing the stars lies in the feet—where the feet tread, the hands also move. As the hands move, the heart also abides. This is what is meant by pacing the *gang* (cosmic pattern). Otherwise, not only will there be no response, but it will also be of no benefit. Those who have attained the Dao, their bodies already pervaded by truth, need not pace to align with the *gang*, nor move to form mudras, nor intentionally abide—yet all abide.\n\nCommunion with the true lies in burning incense, and the principle of burning incense is something practitioners must understand. The nature of the Five Phases: fire is said to blaze upward. When paying homage to the true or summoning generals, burning incense uses the sincerity of the heart to borrow the *qi* of fire and ascend. In practice, one must use a blazing fire and abundant incense—one offering reaches its destination. Otherwise, it cannot transcend and ascend.\n\nThe format of memorials also has its explanation. The ancients’ hearts communed with Heaven; today, people’s hearts are separated from Heaven. When communing, a single thought and Heaven already knows; when separated, repeated memorials fail to reach Heaven. This is because the mundane heart and the celestial true are cut off from one another. Yet the world relies on paper and ink to write, attempting to convey messages upward through fire—this practice has endured for so long that it has proliferated endlessly, falling into the realm of deliberate action. Those who inherit the teachings today, even if their memorials can reach Heaven, should reduce their number to a minimum, so that the heart may remain in profound stillness, making resonance easier to achieve.\n\nThe Master says: The above are the teachings bestowed by the Heavenly Lord, Great Master of the Teachings. Later learners must prioritize cultivation and realization. In the past, when I encountered an immortal master, I received the *Tianxin* method from the ancestral master, seeking oral instructions. Thereupon, the secrets of the Three Luminaries were explained in detail, and the essentials of ascending the hall were transmitted. Thus, I came to know that *Tianxin* pertains to the exorcistic practices of the Jade Hall teachings.\n\nThe Master says: The Great Dao requires only lifting one’s eyes to see; the supreme vehicle needs not expend much effort of the heart. It is also said: Close the gate while it is still early; apprehend the thief by knowing the time.\n\nUpon hearing these words, my heart was moved, and I asked again: \"When does this occur?\"\nThe Master replied: \"The time lies in the Heavenly Heart, like panning for gold in water.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, I asked further: \"At the beginning of the primordial kalpa of the Original Beginning, who was the ancestral master?\"\nHe said: \"Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\"\nI asked again: \"Must there be a surname?\"\nHe did not answer. After a long while, he said: \"Not knowing whose child this body is, it precedes the image of the Emperor.\"\n\nI asked: \"What is the appearance of the sacred image?\"\nThe Master said: \"Look and you do not see; listen and you do not hear.\"\nI asked: \"If it is neither seen nor heard, then there is no Original Beginning?\"\nThe Master said: \"Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is something.\nVague indeed, indistinct indeed, yet within it there is an image.\"\n\nI asked again: \"What, after all, is this thing?\"\nThe Master said: \"A precious pearl hangs suspended, illuminating the Three Luminaries.\"\n\nThereafter, in every question and answer, the discourse was of the most profound mysteries, the subtleties of ascending to perfection. Now, as I preside over the altar to transmit the teachings, the words of the former sagely masters must not be forgotten. Thus, I have gathered these arcane subtleties and recorded them in broad outline. All the Master’s subtle instructions serve to elucidate the essence of the Great Dao. Those who study this will understand that the teachings of the Jade Hall lie in cultivating the mysteries of the Three Luminaries, not in externals—how could they be neglected?\n\n**Tai Shang’s Natural Threefold Ascension Diagram**\n*Formula:*\nThe heart is still, the realm forgotten; alone, guard the Yellow Chamber.\nThe One True emerges, filling the room with golden light.\n\n*Another formula:*\nSilently contain the true, and heaven and earth arrive together.\nMotionless and serene, the myriad spirits revere and obey.\n\n*Another formula:*\nClose the heart within, the imperial palace far away.\nWhen the yang spirit’s qi is full, step across the golden bridge.\n\nOn the night of the Upper Prime in the gengzi year of the Xuanhe era, after offering incense at the star altar and returning to the chamber to preserve the true, an extraordinary fragrance descended. Turning my head, I saw the ancestral master within a radiance of golden light and Brahmanic qi. He said to me: \"I am Zhao Sheng of Wu, now serving at the celestial court. In my former life, I dwelt on Mount Tianmu and possessed a secret book. At the time of my ascension, I concealed it atop the Three Mao Peaks of Mount Juqu in Jiangnan. You must go and retrieve it.\"\n\nSeveral years later, I was appointed to govern Jinling and made a special pilgrimage to the mountain’s summit. At midnight, divine light spanned the heavens. Digging deep, about three *zhang* down, I found a stone casket containing a silk scroll roughly six or seven *zhang* in length, mixed with fine sand from Penglai. Having obtained it, I arranged it into twenty-four sections to transmit to the world.\n\nIn the winter of the bingwu year of the Jingkang era, while residing in Piling, I received a jade decree to transmit this record, permitting the succession of the Dragon-Tiger lineage. The rites of the yang realm and the retributions of the yin realm are thereby made manifest—this surpasses all else. Thus, I know that this Great Teaching is the original vow of the Mysterious Origin and the sagely masters, unlike other methods. For later learners, unless they receive the golden words and purple characters from the divine mouth, they will never be able to wear this teaching.\n\nLater heirs of the teaching, small in attainment, should contemplate the *Natural Ascension Diagram*. Then, they may depart from all talismanic methods. Within a single breath, they can communicate with the true and reach the numinous, subdue demons and vanquish monsters, deliver the dead and rescue the suffering—all these become easy matters. Be reverent, be reverent.\n\n*Recorded by Lu Shizhong, Master of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity.*\n\n**End of Scroll One of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n*Scripture Title:* *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Two of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Two: The True Master’s Precepts and Disciplines**\n\nThe Master says: Precepts and disciplines are the safeguards for beginners.\nIn high antiquity, there were no precepts, yet one could cultivate the Dao and attain perfection.\nIn middle antiquity, there were no disciplines, yet one could awaken to the true and realize the Dao.\nIn later ages, the human heart is drowned by material desires, and innate nature is obscured by false thoughts. Thus, precepts and disciplines arose.\n\nYet precepts are the most difficult for beginners to uphold. Therefore, the former sages first used disciplines to restrain them. Only after disciplines are not violated can one speak of observing precepts. Now, those who inherit the teaching and aspire to the realm of immortals—how could they fail to observe precepts? Thus, I record the precepts but not the disciplines.\n\nTo not see what is desirable keeps the heart from disorder—this still depends on precepts.\nBut when, though seeing what is desirable, the heart remains undisturbed—what need is there for precepts?\n\n**Three Great Precepts for Ascending the Hall**\n**First Precept: Against Lustful Thoughts**\nThe Master says: In cultivating the Dao, precepts come first.\nLust is easy to preclude; lustful thoughts are difficult to preclude.\nTo ascend to perfection, first preclude lustful thoughts. When the heart is unmoved, lust will not arise.\nThus, the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: \"Immortals and Daoists are not divine; they accumulate essence and amass qi to attain perfection.\" These are not empty words.\n\n**Second Precept: Against Worldly Thoughts**\nThe Master says: The toils of the worldly drown the six roots.\nThe so-called roots can generate branches and leaves. Wherever they touch, they grow, day by day, the branches and leaves multiplying. When the roots of worldly dust are strong and large, one becomes stained by external things—this is called \"dust-strength.\" External things are also called \"dust-strength,\" and external things are also called \"consciousness.\" Where there is consciousness, there is toil—this is called \"worldly toil.\"\nDo not cling to the forms of all phenomena. Thus, the *Scripture for Protecting Life* says: \"Purify the six roots and sever all demonic obstructions.\" This is the meaning.\n\n**Third Precept: Against Deluded Intentions**\nThe Master says: To preclude worldly toil, first preclude deluded intentions.\nWhere consciousness arises, delusion follows; where intention moves, dust is born.\nThus, in the course of a day, whether deviant or upright, all involve thought. Where thought arises, intention follows—this is deluded intention.\nTo preclude intention, make the heart like the bright moon at midnight or the limpid waters of an autumn pool—serene and undisturbed. Then delusion will be settled.\nThus, the *Scripture of Purity* says: \"Clarify the heart, and the spirit will naturally be clear.\"\n\nObserve this closely.\n\nThe Master says: These three precepts are for those who seek the true and ascend in learning to cultivate and uphold them. For those of the secular world below, who may find it difficult to transcend worldly customs and uphold the great precepts, first impart the *Jade Hall Universal Precepts*, then gradually ascend to the true. The *Jade Hall Universal Precepts* comprise twenty-four articles:\n\n**First Precept: The Heart Does Not Harbor Poison**\nThe Master says: One must treat all beings—whether friend or foe—with impartiality. Even if anger arises, do not store it in the heart, allowing knots to form and remain unloosed.\n\n**Second Precept: The Eyes Do Not Gaze Upon the Improper**\nThe Master says: The eyes are servants of form and become stained by what they encounter. When observing, if it is not something one should see, do not look.\n\n**Third Precept: The Tongue Does Not Crave Foulness**\nThe Master says: Though scholars may not yet permanently abstain from meat and strong flavors, they must not indulge in pungent or repulsive foods.\n\n**Fourth Precept: The Mouth Does Not Utter Improper Speech**\nThe Master says: Those who study the Dao must quiet speech to nurture qi, and above all, refrain from harsh words, divisive speech, falsehoods, and frivolous talk. Let none of these be violated.\n\n**Fifth Precept: The Ears Do Not Listen to Chaos**\nThe Master says: All words of right and wrong, as well as perverse and improper matters, are best left unheard.\n\n**Sixth Precept: Wine Does Not Lead to Drunkenness**\nThe Master says: Wine disrupts the true and corrupts nature; one must not become excessively intoxicated.\n\n**Seventh Precept: Lust Does Not Stir the Passions**\nThe Master says: Those of lesser attainment may not yet fully abstain, but they must not indulge in base or obsessive desires.\n\n**Eighth Precept: Qi Is Not Used Recklessly**\nThe Master says: Human qi and blood thrive in stillness and stability; one must not allow the spirit and heart to race wildly.\n\n**Ninth Precept: The Nature Does Not Give Rise to Anger**\nThe Master says: The nature is inherently tranquil; anger harms it, and when the nature is harmed, the spirit departs. The *True Records* states: \"A volatile and violent nature is the thief and sickness of the entire body.\" Even when anger is unavoidable, constantly reflect on restraining it, and joy will naturally arise.\n\n**Tenth Precept: Against Envy**\nThe Master says: The human heart, driven by selfish desires, generates envy when others surpass it. Scholars must not allow envy to take root. Let another’s glory be as one’s own.\n\n**Eleventh Precept: Against Jealousy**\nThe Master says: This is the same as envy.\n\n**Twelfth Precept: Against Greed**\nThe Master says: Beyond what is needed for clothing and food, all else is superfluous. One must not covet beyond what is sufficient.\n\n**Thirteenth Precept: Against Stinginess**\nThe Master says: All things beyond the body belong to worldly toil. One should always use them to aid others and never be miserly.\n\n**Fourteenth Precept: Against Arrogance**\nThe Master says: The Dao resides in humility, modesty, and reverence. When encountering others, always treat them with respect.\n\n**Fifteenth Precept: Against Pride**\nThe Master says: When favored, think of disgrace; when at ease, contemplate peril. The slightest emergence of pride and falsity damages and depletes one’s fortune and virtue.\n\n**Sixteenth Precept: Against Deceit**\nThe Master says: Even in the darkness of a room, act as though being observed; never allow deceitful thoughts to arise.\n\n**Seventeenth Precept: Against Flattery**\nThe Master says: The Dao values truth and uprightness; one must not engage in sycophancy or obsequiousness.\n\n**Eighteenth Precept: Against Licentiousness**\nThe Master says: Beyond the bounds of propriety and constancy, one must not transgress ritual.\n\n**Nineteenth Precept: Against Desire**\nThe Master says: If something does not belong to you, do not let desire arise.\n\n**Twentieth Precept: Against Theft**\nThe Master says: Coveting wealth is theft. One must always refrain from unjust gain, let alone outright theft.\n\n**Twenty-First Precept: Against Pursuing Influence and Contending for Fame**\nThe Master says: One must not rely on power to intimidate or chase after fame and profit.\n\n**Twenty-Second Precept: Against Indecent Exposure Before the Stars and Improper Worship of Spirits**\nThe Master says: When relieving oneself day or night, do not face the heavens or turn north. When passing by spirit shrines, do not wander or linger. Entering a temple in such a manner is improper.\n\n**Twenty-Third Precept: Against Killing Living Beings and Destroying Life**\nThe Master says: Plants possess life; animals possess destiny. Do not kill or destroy them.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Precept: Against Consuming the Six Pungent Foods**\nThe Master says: The six pungent foods repel the spirit and qi, disrupting the true origin. They must not be eaten.\n\nThe above twenty-four precepts may be upheld by both the secular and the Daoist.\n\n**Rules and Prohibitions for Ascending the Hall**\nThe Master says: Those who ascend the hall, having already upheld the precepts, must also understand the rules and prohibitions. Without them, the constant teachings and methods will fall into disorder, and the Dharma will not be revered. Thus, those who inherit the teachings must cultivate a nature like jade—warm, lustrous, and flawless.\n\nFor those who inherit the teachings: In the presence of the Most High, they are called disciples; in the Three Realms, they are known as true officials. Disciples are called \"students of the true,\" and those who study the true must first cultivate the body. The essence of cultivating the body lies in eliminating selfish desires, refining the spirit, and nurturing the formless to replenish insufficient vitality. Only when vitality is abundant may one seek the Dao of immortality and receive the teachings.\n\nThe teachings are not transmitted without the offering of words and the submission of faith; one is not ordained without swearing oaths before heaven and earth. Those who recklessly transmit or receive them will be investigated by the Three Officials and punished by the Four Departments.\n\nWhen receiving the teachings, one must revere and honor the ordaining master, treating them with the ancient rites due to a father. In this age, some sell the Dharma for profit, treating their ordaining masters with less respect than servants. Those who study the true must remember that the Celestial Master of Han is far beyond reach and cannot be seen. Those who transmit the teachings of the Celestial Master are the ordaining masters—accord them respect, never slighting or belittling them.\n\nWhen transmitting the teachings and presiding over the altar, overseeing the various Dharma instruments, only those with innate destiny and immortal bones may attain this. If one’s resolve does not remain unwavering from youth to old age, the teachings must not be transmitted. Those who are fickle and insincere must not receive ordination.\n\nWhen establishing an altar or oratory, choose a place free of graves or cremated remains, not in grand halls or spacious chambers. In bustling cities, select a quiet and broad street. If near a noisy marketplace, ensure the altar is built in a pure location, without needlessly serving the gods. For one who becomes a teacher to humans and heavens, even the spirits and ghosts beneath the earth will submit and serve. If one privately tends to incense and offerings, the Three Officials will investigate and impose penalties.\n\nOne should regularly sit upright in an empty chamber, burning incense and silently circulating the qi, so that the Four Controllers descend, the Five Emperors attend at the window, and the immortals and perfected ones draw near. One must constantly study and savor the profound and mysterious, recite and contemplate the teachings, so that the true spirits descend into one’s body. Then the heavenly demons will serve and revere one as a true official, and in the past, one will not be bound by the earthly bureaus but ascend directly to the Upper Palace of Nanchang.\n\nAs a teacher of the Three Realms, one must not enter temples for leisure. If unavoidable, one must not flatter or sacrifice to demonic spirits. Instead, one should silently pay homage to the Three Realms, and blessings will naturally follow. Those who violate this will have their transgressions recorded by the Three Officials.\n\nBefore being called a teacher, one may only receive the *Ten Scrolls of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method of the Ancestral Teachings of One’s Altar*, to assist the true teaching. When one’s merit and conduct become illustrious, one advances to the Seventh Rank of the Jade Hall. Only when the heart remains unwavering does one progress to the Ninth Rank. After advancing through the Ninth Rank without fault, one then receives the *Three Rushing Registers*. Upon receiving all twenty-four ranks in full, one becomes a teacher of humans and heavens.\n\nWhen performing purification rites and offerings, one is called the *Orthodox One Wondrous Purification*.\n\n**Ranks of the Jade Hall:**\n- **First Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings*, one assists the Celestial Master in matters under the Jade Hall.\n- **Seventh Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings, True Official*, one serves as the Five Envoys—Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, and Central Yellow—convening affairs of the Three Heavenly Courts.\n- **Ninth Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings, True Official*, one serves as the *Great Dharma Master of All Heavens* and the Envoys of Great Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Jade Clarity.\n- **Twenty-Fourth Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Inheriting Teacher*, *Jade Hall Presiding Teacher*, *Jade Hall Perpetual Inheriting Teacher*, and *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings*, one then ascends to *Jade Hall Golden Gate Attendant of the Celestial Throne*.\n\nThose above the rank of *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings* are all inheriting teachers, bearing titles such as *Perfected of Observant Illumination and Responsive Dao*, *Perfected of Profound Wonder and Empty Clarity*, *Perfected of Cavernous Clarity and True Unity*, and *Perfected of Radiant Vision and Self-Illuminating*. Only after inheriting the teachings for three cycles without fault and attaining a form akin to that of an immortal may one be so addressed.\n\n**Jade Hall Offices:**\n- **First Rank:** *Under the Jade Hall of the Celestial Master*.\n- **Middle Rank:** *Jade Hall Inheriting Teaching Altar*, *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings Altar*.\n- **Upper Rank Inheriting Teacher:** *Executive Office of the Supreme Mystery Capital*.\n\n**Petitions:**\n- To the *Three Clarities’ Imperial Mysterious Master*, all are memorialized.\n- To the *Heavenly Courts of the Upper Realm*, all are reported.\n- To the *Five Marchmounts of the Middle and Lower Realms* and below, all are issued writs.\n- To village altars and the like, all are sent missives.\n\n*Volume Two of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method concludes.*\n\n---\n\n**Volume Three of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Three: Preserving the True and Cultivating Attainment**\n\nThe Master said: The human heart is deluded and confused, submerged in passions and desires, clinging to dusty realms and ceaselessly pursuing them, like a traveler lost on a desolate road, unaware of where to return. Thus, this method is established to gather the wandering mind. In this way, the heart of desire gradually departs, and the true origin may return. Only then can one ride the void and command qi, exiting the manifest and entering the unmanifest.\n\nYet once the true origin has returned, the Dao is near to me—why go to such lengths?\nThe Master said: Sight and hearing leak the qi of the original spirit. Thought and worry scatter the essence of the original yang. Cravings deplete the spirit of the original harmony. Those who study the higher path, in moments of leisure, should silently gather their vision and return their hearing, contain the true within and inwardly observe, restrain desires and moderate emotions—then the immortal Dao is near.\n\n**Daily Absorption of the Three Lights’ Upright Qi**\nThe Master said: Each day at dawn, face the sacred direction and offer incense, absorbing the qi according to the method—this is most wondrous. If sitting calmly without distractions, in a quiet chamber with a settled mind, one may perform this with eyes half-closed. \"Half-closed\" means not fully shutting the eyes.\n\nThe Master said: Press the left thumb against the upper joint of the middle finger to form the *Sun Lord Mudra*, recite the *Sun Lord Mantra* nine times, hold the mudra before the heart, and inhale the sun’s qi through the nose. Visualize the sun’s five colors entering the five viscera, then swallow the qi along with it.\n\nNext, change to the *Moon Lord Mudra* by pressing the left thumb against the upper joint of the fourth finger, recite the *Moon Lord Mantra* nine times, hold the mudra before the heart, and inhale the moon’s qi through the nose. Visualize its five colors entering the five viscera, then swallow the qi along with it.\n\nNext, press the left thumb against the base of the second finger’s nail to form the *Celestial Stem Mudra*, recite the *Celestial Stem Mantra* seven times, place both hands on the knees, tilt the head back, and visualize the Great Crimson Heaven, from which the Celestial Stem hangs with ten thousand *zhang* of fiery light, fine as silk, crackling with sound. Draw it fully into the mouth, and if any light remains, let it cover the body. Then swallow the qi and store it in the cinnabar field.\n\n**Morning Audience at the Jade Hall to Greet the Original Qi**\nThe Master said: When a student of the true has matters to report, one should enter the chamber, sit upright, and visualize oneself as a sphere of true qi, radiant as the bright moon. Within this light, see the Golden Gate within the Mysterious Capital Mountain, where there is a White Jade Hall, and the Elder Lord within. Ascend the hall and pay homage.\n\nThe incantation says:\n*Concluded, see the Elder Lord between the brows, light dividing into sun and moon, illuminating me. I inhale it into my mouth, visualize golden light enveloping my body. Heaven is clear, earth is level, sun and moon shine bright. I ride the original qi, ascend to greet the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord bestows upon me a body of light. The original qi of the Mysterious Origin eternally preserves my long life.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Concluded, swallow the saliva and withdraw.*\n\nThe Master said: Practicing this regularly, whenever one has matters to report, the inner and outer will align, and one will communicate with the true and summon the numinous.\n\n*On auspicious days of original yang, pay homage at the Jade Hall. Sun and moon bathe me, refining my soul and spirit. Three thousand hairs, twelve thousand radiant essences. United with the Dao in truth, refining my golden chamber. Gathered within me, equal in length to heaven.*\n\n**Restraining the Corpse-Spirits and Seven Po**\n\nThe Master said: When yang wanes and yin waxes in a person, when desires and passions deplete the original essence, it is always because the Three Corpses and Seven Po disturb and disrupt the celestial truth. On every *gengshen*, *jiazi*, one’s own birthday, and the evenings of the fifth, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of each month, the three hun-souls become unsettled—*Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing* drift and wander, their radiance scattering, their forms dissolving. The hidden essence stirs in chaos, and all three hun-souls abandon the body, roaming the bedchamber or becoming ensnared by external malevolence, seized by ghosts and spirits, unable to return. Far from their corporeal form, the two qi engage in strife, drying and scorching the inner child, giving rise to illness and disordering the true origin—all stems from this. Those who cultivate the truth must, on these days, restrain and retain them to prevent their escape.\n\nThe method of restraint: lie down in repose, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath for three cycles. Then, knock the teeth three times. Visualize a red qi, the size of a chicken’s egg, rising from within and emerging through the mouth. Let the red qi enter the left and right eyes, then exit again. Expand the red qi until it envelops the body above and below, transforming into fire that burns through the self, inside and out, until a faint warmth is felt. Knock the teeth three more times and call the names of the hun-souls: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, *Youjing*. Recite the incantation:\n\n*Within the Mysterious Palace of the Great Tenuity,\nThe Primordial Yellow and First Green.\nRefine the three hun within,\nLet Taiguang be at peace.\nThe divine chamber, the Jade Hall,\nBorn with me as one.\nDo not stir recklessly,\nWatched over by the Great Numinous.\nIf you wish to fly and wander,\nGo only to the Upper Clarity.\nIf you hunger or thirst,\nDrink the Mysterious Water and Jade Essence.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Hold the breath.*\n\nWithin the Mud-Pill Palace, sun and moon shine brightly. Sleep in stillness. Practice this regularly, and yang will flourish while yin wanes. The Corpse-Spirits will be restrained, the hun-souls and spirits will be strong and at peace. No illness will invade—this is the ladder to seeking immortality.\n\n*Great Spirit of Taiguang,\nCelestial Lord of the Imperial Net.\nHolding the embryonic talisman,\nWearing a purple crown.\nYellow revolves, red essence,\nAscends to the Gate of Life,\nTransforms the spirit, returns to life.*\n\nThe Master said: On the new moon, full moon, and last day of each month, the Seven Po roam and consort with ghosts and demons, wasting and toying with the original yang. They often cause people to be erratic in joy and anger, unstable in sorrow and worry, indulgent in lust and pleasure, constantly deluded and confused, creating the roots of illness and obstructing progress on the Dao. The method to restrain the Po: on those evenings, lie down in repose and stretch the feet. Cover the ears with both hands, interlocking the fingers atop the head. Hold the breath seven times. Visualize a white radiance at the tip of the nose, the size of a small bean, gradually expanding until it crowns the body in nine layers. After a long while, it transforms into two blue-green dragons within the eyes, white tigers in the nostrils, a vermilion bird in the heart, and a tortoise and serpent beneath the feet. Two jade maidens, clad in brocade, hold flames before the ear gates. Swallow the saliva seven times and call the names of the Seven Po: *Shigou*, *Fushi*, *Queyin*, *Tunzei*, *Feidu*, *Chuhui*, *Choufei*. Recite the incantation:\n\n*Visualize the sun in the heart,\nThe moon in the kidneys.\nThe two qi intertwine their light,\nForming an infant to guard the cinnabar field.\nNine layers of plain qi,\nRestrain the Po and govern their release.\nCelestial beasts guard the gates,\nJade maidens hold the passes.\nRefine the Po to harmony and softness,\nLet them be at peace with me.\nDo not stir recklessly,\nObserve and examine the source of form.\nIf you hunger or thirst,\nDrink the sun’s yellow and the moon’s cinnabar.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Ingest the Heavenly Sovereign’s Life-Preserving Talisman in peace.*\n\nThe true qi lingers,\nThe nine portals shine open.\nThe Corpse-Spirits and Po are restrained,\nForbidden to come and go.\nRefine yang and exchange qi,\nGuard the numinous terrace in haste.\nExternal malevolence cannot intrude,\nThe inner truth returns of itself.\nGathered and undispersed,\nThe yang radiance returns to the womb.\n\n**Heavenly Sovereign’s Life-Preserving Talisman**\nWrite in cinnabar on yellow paper, face east, and ingest.\n\nThe Master says: Those who study immortality must pacify the mind and nurture the spirit, ingesting and refining to cure illness, filling the brain palace to its fullness so that the primordial essence does not tilt. Only then may one preserve the spirit and practice the breathing of the Two Radiant Ones. If one frequently engages in sexual union, the qi becomes defiled and the spirit flees, essence withers and the body is exhausted. Thus, true immortals first abstain from lust. If one does not abstain or restrain oneself, even with diligent practice, one cannot replenish the depletion—this is merely lending qi to a moving corpse. If you can abstain from excess and purify the heart, then practicing this method may lead you into the wondrous subtleties of the High Ascent.\n\nThe *Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Three, ends here.\n\n---\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n*Scripture Title:* *Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource of the base text: *Daoist Canon*, *Methods* section of the *Dongzhen* division.\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Four**\n**Chapter Four: The Inner Realm of the High Ascent**\n\nThe Master says: Those who study the supreme Dao and aspire to immortality must rely on the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon to refine and complete the immortal way. Without the mysterious practice, none can unite with the real. This so-called \"essence and radiance\" is not sought from without but is the true attainment of one’s own body. Daoist methods have a thousand gates and ten thousand doors, winding paths and side trails, with杂说纷繁冗杂. Thus, many learners abandon the real for the false, forsake the internal for the external. The longer they practice, the harder it is to achieve success. Now, the High Ascent of the sun and moon is the wondrous teaching transmitted by the Most High to the ancestral masters of later times. In ancient times, it was passed down only orally, without reliance on written words. Now, it is specially recorded in writing so that those of later generations with karmic affinity may easily seek and investigate it. Thus, the *Huangting [Neijing]* states: \"In the High Ascent of the sun and moon, I ascend the Dao; Yu Yi and Jie Lin guard me well.\" This is what it means.\n\nThe name of the sun’s *hun* is the Jade Emperor, with the jade taboo-name.\nThe Five Emperors wear robes of five-colored brocade and jade capes, with flying feather skirts and lotus crowns.\n\nWithin the sun:\n- The Green Emperor’s taboo-name is *Yuán Cháng Yuán*, his style *Zhào Lóng Tāo*.\n- The Red Emperor’s taboo-name is *Dān Líng Zhì*, his style *Lǜ Hóng Yìng*.\n- The White Emperor’s taboo-name is *Hào Yù Jiāng*, his style *Huí Jīn Xiá*.\n- The Black Emperor’s taboo-name is *Chéng Zēng Tíng*, his style *Xuán Lǜ Yán*.\n- The Yellow Emperor’s taboo-name is *Shòu Yì Fù*, his style *Biāo Huī Xiàng*.\n\nThe names of the inner spirits of the Five Emperors’ *hun* essence are *Zhū Jǐng*, their style *Chì Tóng Chì Qì*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord’s taboo-name is *Jiāng Jūn*, his style *Gāo Qiān Shuǎng*.\n\nThe name of the moon’s *pò* is the Five August Ladies, with the jade taboo-name.\nThe Ladies all wear three-cornered buns with hair hanging to the shoulders, robes of five-colored brocade capes, and dragon-phoenix flying feather skirts.\n\nWithin the moon:\n- The Green August Lady’s taboo-name is *Yǐn É*, her style *Fēn Yīng Yàn*.\n- The Red Qi August Lady’s taboo-name is *Yì Yì Liáo Wú*, her style *Wǎn Yán Xū*.\n- The White August Lady’s taboo-name is *Líng Sù Lán*, her style *Yù Lián Huá*.\n- The Black August Lady’s taboo-name is *Jié Lián Qiáo*, her style *Chún Lì Jīn*.\n- The Yellow August Lady’s taboo-name is *Qīng Yíng Jīn*, her style *Gèn Dìng Róng*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Mother of the moon’s yellow qi has the taboo-name *Dào Yào Zhī*, her style *Zhèng Huì*, and is titled *Tiáo Fūren*.\n\nThe name of the inner spirit of the *hun* essence is *Ài Xiāo*, its style *Tái Biāo*.\n\nThe Master says: The taboo-names of the sun and moon’s *hun* are most secret. The Most High concealed the names of the sun and moon in the Purple Terrace Jade Palace; those who know them communicate with the spirits. At dawn on the first day of the lunar month, sit upright, purify the fast, and settle the mind. Knock the teeth thirty-six times. First visualize one’s own cinnabar field as a great sea, with the sun rising from the sea. One’s own body sits atop the crown of the head, the body like a mountain of stone.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Yang arises from the primordial sea,\nRising from below.\nThe chaotic yang essence\nDispels the host of yin.\nWithin is a great spirit,\nThe Lord Yu Yi.\nDescend with this true qi,\nBathe my form.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times. Next, visualize the sun ascending in golden light, illuminating and reflecting one’s true form, which ascends to the sun palace.\n\n*\"The golden pivot radiates auspiciousness,\nPervading the brilliance of yang.\nThe flaming light soars and flies,\nFlowing essence for ten thousand miles.\nDemon vapors extinguish their flames,\nDust and filth are swept clean.\nSoaring through emptiness, stepping on qi,\nI ride the qi to ascend on high.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times. Next, ride the fire dragon to rush to the sun palace. The fire dragon leads the way, piercing the crown with flying light. The spirit enters the realm of nothingness, paying homage to Yu Yi. In the blink of an eye, ascend and merge with the numinous radiance. The one true follows its origin, burning away the corpse of Peng.\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times, and contemplate entering the sun palace, the entire body becoming one. After a long while, forget the form, melting like spring. Practicing this for one year dispels illness, commands ghosts and spirits, and comes and goes naturally. After two years, one communicates with immortals and receives the attendance of the Three Realms. After three years, the Demon King vouches for one. After nine years, the practice is complete, and the Five Emperors befriend one. A decree is issued to appoint one as a Perfected, and one attains longevity.\n\nThe Master says: Once the student has practiced the Way of Rushing to the Sun, next visualize oneself as Mount Kunlun, sitting atop the mountain’s peak, with a great sea below and the moon’s wheel newly risen. Swallow the saliva three times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n\nThe true radiance first arises, the utmost yang within yin. Water overflows the mysterious wheel, golden dew emits a faint glow. The source of saliva flows freely, its brilliance illuminating the jade chamber. Qi grows in luminous abundance, and one’s service enables flight.\n\nIncantation:\n*(Incantation concluded, swallow saliva nine times.)*\n\nNext, visualize the moonlight as a half-crescent, its golden light shining upon one’s body. The radiance disperses into the Celestial Pond, gold and water forming a half-crescent. The light illumines the dark night, shining upon my mysterious pearl. Drinking the crystalline nectar, its fragrance permeates the numinous body. After several cycles of true convergence, one rides the radiance in soaring flight.\n\nIncantation:\n*(Incantation concluded, swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth, and visualize the moon as full. True water forms a bridge, descending to connect with the mountain’s stone. My body, riding a multicolored phoenix, enters the moon. The celestial source circulates, its light penetrating the layered towers. The night sky reflects in all directions, the five fluids stirring the depths. Soaring through emptiness, one captures the radiance, and the true body floats in flight. With a single ascent to the true, the nine yangs hold no peril.)*\n\n*(Recitation concluded, swallow saliva nine times, and visualize entering the Lunar Palace, becoming one with the body. After a long while, forget the form, sensing the golden light teaching in all four directions, illuminating the entire sky. Practicing this for one year dispels illness, commands ghosts and spirits, and comes and goes naturally. After two years, one communicates with Perfected Ones, and the Three Realms attend. After three years, the Demon King vouches for one. After nine years, the Five Ladies issue a decree, and one’s form attains flight as an immortal.)*\n\nThe Master says: The mystery of the two radiances is not something lesser scholars can comprehend. Those who understand it should practice diligently, and their bodies will emit light, befriending the myriad Perfected Ones. They will attain the Dao and become Perfected, eventually ranking among the Flying Immortals of the sun and moon, their longevity matching heaven and earth, their flight unbounded. This is a secret of the highest immortals—guard it well, guard it well.\n\n*End of Scroll Four of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n\n---\n\n**Scroll Five of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Five: Ascending the Dipper and Rushing to the Stars**\n\nThe Master says: For protecting the body and prolonging life, nothing surpasses the Dipper’s true essence in restraining the hun-soul and refining yang. Thus, the sages say: \"Entering and exiting within the Dipper, the body grows strong and qi flourishes, extending years and increasing destiny—all evil shuns one.\" They also say: \"All methods emerge from the Dipper, and all spirits are commanded by the Dipper.\" Thus, every method and practice cannot connect with the true or respond to the numinous without the Dipper’s truth. Therefore, the sagely masters necessarily teach ascending the Dipper and pacing the stars, hoping that students may communicate with immortals, attain the true, preserve the origin, and guard existence.\n\nThe essence of the Great Star is named the Mysterious Pivot Spirit, called the Yang Brightness Hun, or the Celestial Pivot Hun. Its spirit ascends as the Celestial Grand Commandant, governing the correction of transgressions. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ Flying Immortals; below, it commands those who study immortality, as well as the spirits of heaven and earth.\n\nThe essence of the Origin Star is named the Northern Terrace Spirit, called the Yin Essence Hun, or the Celestial Rotator Hun. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Grand Steward, governing rank and emolument. Above, it oversees the celestial lodges; below, it commands the myriad spirits and those who study immortality.\n\nThe essence of the True Star is named the Nine Ultimates Supreme Perfected Spirit, called the Perfected Person Hun, or the Celestial Mechanism Hun. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Minister of Works, governing immortals. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ lofty Perfected Ones; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ numinous immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Pivot Star is named the Mysterious Root Spirit, called the Dark Obscurity Hun, or the Celestial Balance Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Mobile Strike General, governing the punishment of rebels. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ ghosts and spirits; in the middle, it commands the Northern Emperor’s Three Officials; below, it monitors the myriad multitudes.\n\nThe essence of the Mainstay Star is named the Great Peace Spirit, called the Cinnabar Origin Hun, or the Jade Balance Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Dipper Lord, governing life records. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ registers; in the middle, it governs the ghosts and spirits’ ledgers; below, it commands those who study the true.\n\nThe essence of the Chronicle Star is named the Life Mechanism Spirit, called the Northern Culmen Hun, or the Open Yang Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Grand Master of Ceremonies, governing advancement. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Perfected Ones; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ Flying Immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Pass Star is named the Origin Yang Spirit, called the Celestial Pass Hun, or the Shaking Dipper Great Brightness. It governs the Supreme Emperor of Heaven, controlling the mechanisms of heaven and earth’s fortune and misfortune.\n\nThe spirit of the August Jade Emperor is called the Eight Radiances Void Origin Lord. The spirit of the Great Tenuity Jade Emperor Lord is called the Seven Essences Seven Spirit Lords. Those who behold these two stars attain longevity; those who cultivate them become immortals.\n\nThe Master says: Regularly on the twenty-first night of the month, enter the chamber at midnight, connect with the settled qi, close the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Then, one’s entire body slowly rises, flying upward into the Dipper’s bowl, sitting with one’s back to the Perfected One. After a long while, one senses one’s body within the Dipper. Exerting utmost effort, one feels heat within the body—this is the true qi harmonizing with virtue. Visualize the Dipper’s purple light descending upon one’s body, illuminating both inside and out. Once one has arrived within the Dipper, sit with one’s back to the Perfected One. Then, proceed to pay homage to each star, reciting the prayer:\n\nTo the first, the Great Star’s essence, the Mysterious Pivot Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, riding the void and steering the floating.\nTo the second, the Origin Star’s essence, the Northern Terrace Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, roaming the Jasper Terrace.\nTo the third, the True Star’s essence, the Nine Ultimates Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, governing the Three Mysteries.\nTo the fourth, the Pivot Star’s essence, the Mysterious Root Supreme Perfected: May my jade name be listed among the Flying Immortals.\nTo the fifth, the Mainstay Star’s essence, the Great Peace Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, ascending to Highest Clarity.\nTo the sixth, the Chronicle Star’s essence, the Life Mechanism Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, my name inscribed in the Great Tenuity.\nTo the seventh, the Pass Star’s essence, the Origin Yang Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, commanding the Jade Lads.\nTo the eighth, the August Star’s essence, the Highest Jade Emperor Lord: May I attain flight as an immortal, ascending the Hall of the Latter Sage.\nTo the ninth, the Venerable Star’s essence, the Great Tenuity Jade Emperor Lord: May I attain flight as an immortal, entering the cinnabar chamber and jade palace.\n\nOnce the invocation is complete, visualize the qi of the Dipper in its black, yellow, red, and purple hues descending to infuse your divine body, merging with these same colored qi as they flow downward into the Cavern Chamber. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Primordial essence of the Cavern Chamber,\nSupreme Infant of the Crimson One.\nThe Dipper’s radiant canopy\ncomes to illumine the Muddy Pellet.\nRefine and guard my bones and blood,\nrestrain and govern my poised and hun souls.\nMay I ascend as an immortal,\nriding clouds to greet the dawn.\nPay homage to the Jade Emperor,\nto the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Sovereign.\"*\n\nWhen the incantation is finished, close your eyes, still your thoughts, and forget the form to rest in tranquil sleep. Next, visualize yourself at the Dipper’s mouth, drawing in the black, yellow, red, and purple qi to enter your mortal body.\n\n**Chapter Six of the Supreme Mystery’s Demon-Quelling Canon**\nThe Master said: The Most High cherishes life and does not display might to enforce punitive decrees. Yet when demonic spirits grow frenzied, when malevolent gods transform and shift, harming people and creatures, mocking the true Dao—then, as a last resort, the ultimate statutes of restraint are established.\n\nFor the adept, cultivation and realization must come first. Once one attains the subtleties of the real, ghosts and spirits will rise in reverence, the Three Realms will submit in devotion—how could one then rely on awe and severity to govern?\n\nThe Master said: Before the first kalpa unfolded and heaven and earth first took shape, primordial qi circulated, and people lived in benevolence and longevity. But as yin waned and yang dissipated, ghosts and spirits gradually arose. From the celestial winds above to the springs and soil below, they manifested in myriad forms across all directions, all born of wayward qi in creation, inheriting the baleful shapes of heaven and earth. They spread poison and practice perversity, acting as their nature dictates.\n\nThus, even the stellar palaces have their ghosts, capable of causing disasters. Heaven and earth, too, have their ghosts, who oversee human fortune and misfortune. The sixty cyclical days each have a deity presiding over them. Their retinues include thousands of ghosts and ten thousand demons, flying through the world. Heaven can give them life but cannot entirely extinguish them—hence this method is used to govern them.\n\nYet this canon represents the ultimate punishment of the heavens and must not be employed lightly.\n\n**Register of Ghosts and Demons**\nThe Ten-Thousand-Zhang Ghost of High Heaven, king of the hundred common ghosts, surnamed Xi, celestial name Six Directions, dwells in the waters southeast of Mount Tai.\n\nThe Three Elders of the Southern Village, lords of the Daoist dead, surnamed Che, named Ni, reside northwest of Mount Tai. They oversee the ledgers of the dead, examine the sins of the living, command official subordinates, and can also harm people.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Northern Dipper, clad in black above and below, seven thousand zhang in height, surnamed Wu, named Huan.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Dipper’s Web at Midnight, nine zhang tall, dressed in red, nameless, responsible for slaying traitors and rebels across the world.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Supreme Unity, formless and nameless, one zhang and six feet tall, clad in red.\n\nThe Celestial Three-Five Executioner Ghost, named Gui, one zhang and seven feet tall, dressed in white with a red headband, wielding a halberd.\n\nThe Great Ghost of the Northern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Ban, named Wan.\n\nThe Ghost of the Western Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Zhuo, named Qiu.\n\nThe Ghost of the Southern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Ming, named Wen.\n\nThe Ghost of the Eastern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Jiao, named Che.\n\nThe Ghost of the Central Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Wang, named Xian.\n\nThe five Dipper ghosts above record human transgressions and often bring calamity and slaughter upon people.\n\nThe Master of the Five Dipper’s Reversed Executioner Ghosts, named Xu.\n\nThe Ghost of the Five Directions’ Direct Talisman, named Jie Tian.\n\nThe Celestial One’s Long-Harming Descendants Ghost, named Gao Bi.\n\nThe Celestial Flying Long-Ensnaring Ghost, named Liang Tian.\n\nThe above ghosts are regularly dispatched by the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor to investigate human sins, and they constantly dwell among people. These are called Celestial Demons. Each initially took form from the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, unlike lesser specters. To offend them brings great harm. They may be restrained by talismans but should not be killed.\n\n**The Heavenly Emperor’s Talisman for Restraining Celestial Demons**\nThe talisman employs the Jade Clarity mudra on yellow silk. Worn or displayed, it ensures peace and auspiciousness.\n\nThe Master said: Long ago, the High Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Wenchang Lord of the Dao, rode a cloud-dragon treasure chariot, a jade carriage with wheel-rims of nephrite, its canopy tilted and axle turned, ascending the sacred Mount Emei. There, he saw the people of the lower realms oppressed by various demons and ghosts. The ghosts were numerous, their names diverse, roaming the world and slaughtering the innocent. Thus, he established the method for slaying ghosts and restraining demons to govern them.

Their forms span three *zhang*, and they bring harm to the imperial subjects. Knowing their names, ghosts dare not approach. Calling their names thrice, they weep and flee a thousand *li*. There are talismans to subdue and control them.\n\nTo subdue the **Great Year Ghost Generals of Yin-Yang of the Jiazi Era**, the talisman is a celestial secret, guarded by three thousand **Heavenly Ding Soldiers of the Three Heavens** and sixty-four **Jade Maidens**. To restrain and subdue them, one must inscribe the **Great Slayer Text** in black on yellow paper and make a petition—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Worldly Ghost Names:**\n- **Mountain Spirit:** Zhuo Nei\n- **Wood Spirit:** Qun Yao\n- **Stone Spirit:** Pi\n- **Monkey Spirit:** Ma Li Ze Hao\n- **Celestial Tree:** Fang Yu\n- **Fox Spirit:** Jia Fa Gan\n- **Great Mountain:** Gong Qiang\n- **Lesser Mountain:** He Bing\n- **Brick and Stone:** Yue Su\n- **Pomegranate Wood:** Xia Tuo\n- **Ghost Lust:** Zai Zhi\n- **Woman Lust:** Jie Jiao\n- **Blue Qi:** Wen Gao Yuan\n- **White Qi:** Wen Bo Lai\n- **Red Qi:** Wen Shi Xuan\n- **Black Qi:** Wen Wen Duan\n- **Yellow Qi:** Wen Jun Tai\n- **House and Chamber:** Yao Zi\n- **Qi-Eater:** Hou Fu\n- **Latrine:** Xiang Fu\n- **Well:** Rong Qiong Jiu\n- **Kitchen Hearth:** Gui Rang Gan\n- **Bed and Couch:** He Zi\n- **Umbrella and Canopy:** Yan\n- **Banner and Pennant:** Tuo\n- **Sound of Peng:** Luan\n- **Sheng and Reed Pipes:** Gou\n- **Halberd:** Yi Er Qin\n- **Sword and Blade:** Zi Fu\n- **Armor:** Zi Xian\n- **Millennial White Bones:** Yuan Shi\n- **Centennial White Bones:** Yin Chu\n- **River Earl:** Da\n- **Four Waterways:** Hou\n- **Three Rivers:** Jian\n- **Iron Spirit:** Ming Yi Yuan\n- **Metal Spirit:** Ming Yi Chong\n- **Bronze Vessel Ghost:** Yang Sha\n- **Pillar Wood:** Wen Luo\n- **Clothing and Garments:** Shi Lian\n- **Five Colors:** Ti Jing\n- **Tomb Earl:** Gong Xia Hou\n- **Tomb Ghosts:** Two Thousand Later\n\nAll these ghosts traverse the world, relying on forms and borrowing natures. In spring, their legions number in the millions, roaming and blocking the four directions, filling the six harmonies. The **Most High** possesses methods to restrain them—they dare not stir, fleeing at the sound of their names and scattering at the sight of talismans.\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Fire Bell Toss to Annihilate Demons and Slay Ghosts—Supreme Talisman**\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The Northern Emperor commands, burning the ghost camps.*\n*Slaying demon ghosts, severing evil spirits.*\n*The Heavenly Ding soldiers advance boldly, casting fire and ringing bells.*\n*Foul smoke billows, crimson flames blaze bright.*\n*The Three Realms are pacified, all forms destroyed for ten thousand li.*\n*Those who dare disobey are swiftly sent to the Dark City.*\n*Bound by wind blades, eternally sunk in the Nine Ramparts.*\n*No pardon is granted—execute upon talisman’s arrival.*\n*Hasten to obey the Northern Emperor’s decree!*\n\n**Three Heavens Demon-Slaying Jade Script**　**True Emperor’s Spirit**\n\nThe above **Ghost-Slaying Talisman** is inscribed in cinnabar on red paper. To subdue demons and slay ghosts, address the **Ghost-Slaying Demon-Restraining Generals and Scribes**, burning the petition in the central courtyard. That night, black winds and fierce rains will arise, and the ghosts will perish of themselves. If there is wind without rain, the ghosts flee a thousand *li*. If there is neither wind nor rain, the entity is no great demon or evil spirit, and the celestial authorities will not execute the extreme penalty. Take note—this must not be taken lightly.\n\nOnce the retribution is complete, inscribe the **Jade Script** in cinnabar on yellow paper, or on *xiang* wood, to permanently secure the land. Welcome the **qi of life and prosperity**, ensuring no further demonic afflictions.\n\n**The Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method** concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, **Methods Category of the Dongzhen Section**.\n\n**Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Seven: Altar Rituals and Dignified Conduct**\n\nThe Master said: Solemnity, reverence, secrecy, and harmony—these are the affairs of inner truth. Banners, pennants, standards, and their measured movements—these are the affairs of outer ritual. Yet when sincerity unites with truth and application is seamless, one becomes a companion to Heaven and Earth. Even so, outer ritual is still required to discipline the realm.\n\nIn every bow and rise, every advance and retreat, all that the eye sees and the ear hears must be proper. With no opening for wayward thoughts, one may communicate with Heaven and truly reach the **Supreme Emperor**. Thus it is said: *Model Heaven, emulate Earth, and imitate the world’s dignified conduct*—then all actions will be solemn and respectful.\n\nFor altar and meditation rites, the structure has three tiers, reflecting the distinction between the **Heavenly Honored** and the lowly earth. On the altar’s upper tier stands the **Vacuous August**, the **Celestial Treasure Flower Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain**, where the **Three Treasures and Imperial Masters** are enshrined. To the left, the **Banner of the Heavenly-Appointed Demon-Subduing** is erected; to the right, the **Standard of the Lion and Evil-Expelling**. On the left of the left, the **Talisman for Communicating with Truth** is placed to descend the thousand truths. On the right of the right, the **Talisman for Reaching the Spirits** is set to summon the ten thousand spirits. In the center, the **Three Dawn Talismans** are displayed to connect with the myriad *qi* and dispel demonic miasmas.\n\nTo the east of the altar, plant the **Blue Dragon Banner Talisman**; to the west, the **White Tiger Banner Talisman**; to the south, the **Vermilion Bird Banner Talisman**; to the north, the **Dark Warrior Banner Talisman**. In the five directions, arrange the **Jade Talismans for Pacification and Stabilization**—this constitutes the uppermost tier.\n\nIf three tiers are not used, arrange them according to the directions within the hall or palace. If ascending three tiers, the middle tier is set with eight gates:\n- **Northwest:** **Cloud Jade Vacuity Truth-Communicating Gate**\n- **Due North:** **Clear and Cold Mysterious Unity Gate**\n- **Northeast:** **Tranquil and Natural Gate**\n- **Due East:** **Azure Florescence Beginning Gate**\n- **Southeast:** **Pure Harmony and Rigorous Yang Gate**\n- **Due South:** **Pure Yang Blaze and Radiance Gate**\n- **Southwest:** **Earth Compliance and Metal Harmony Gate**\n- **Due West:** **Rigorous Brightness and Luminous Splendor Gate**\n\nOn the lower tier, the twelve *qi* are arrayed:\n- **Zi Position:** **Dark Heaven’s Dense Beginning Qi**\n- **Chou Position:** **Northern Origin’s Natural Qi**\n- **Yin Position:** **Evil-Expelling and Demon-Dispelling Qi**\n- **Mao Position:** **Beginning Azure and Flourishing Origin Qi**\n- **Chen Position:** **Yellow Spirit’s Lofty Mystery Qi**\n- **Si Position:** **Tranquil Spirit’s Serene Quiet Qi**\n- **Wu Position:** **Fiery Truth’s Descending Brilliance Qi**\n- **Wei Position:** **Central Unity’s Congealed Truth Qi**\n- **Shen Position:** **Profound Harmony’s Solemn Brilliance Qi**\n- **You Position:** **Firm Rectitude’s Plain Harmony Qi**\n- **Xu Position:** **True Origin’s Nurturing Spirit Qi**\n- **Hai Position:** **Returning Yin to Face Truth Qi**\n\nThus the altar is complete.\n\n**Upper-Tier Altar Diagram**\n**Middle-Tier Altar Diagram**\n\nThe three altars described above are not used solely for delivering sentient beings. For all rites of petition and invocation, homage to the sages and audience with the perfected, averting calamities and atoning for transgressions, or praying for the state, one employs the **Mingmo Fu (Commanding Demons Talisman)**.\n\n**Mingmo Incantation**\nDivine radiance flashes and flickers,\nHeaven is clear, darkness is bright.\nJade talismans bear Heaven’s mandate,\nSternly arrayed against demonic camps.\nThe sunlight of the Three Heavens,\nNine Shameful Ones lurk in concealment.\nNine Heavens’ light fills all,\nSix Heavens’ yin disperses.\nMighty Heavenly Ding,\nGrasp the talisman and assume form.\nHasten to summon Taokang,\nTogether they extend and perfect the true.\nThe ten thousand *qi* do not scatter,\nOne perfected ascends in flight.\n\n**Nine Small Pennant Talismans**\nThe nine small pennants each have a head, each one foot two inches in length, made of crimson silk. At their center is the great pennant, five feet five inches long, its belly in yellow, its hands and feet with blue on the left and white on the right, to correspond to the Three *Qi*. The great pennant bears the great talisman; the small pennants bear the small talismans.\n\n**Feiben Talisman**, recite the incantation.\n\n**Jade of the Exorcist Lion of the Three Heavens**\n**Talismanic Seal**\nLion Perfected, Exorcist Feathered Regalia.\n\nThe Office of Fiery Numen,\nNurtures and transforms beastly forms.\nFive *qi* complete the body,\nTen thousand evils vanish without trace.\nRepelling and expelling all foulness,\nDevouring malevolent forces.\nThe true talisman erects the standard,\nEstablishing majesty and might.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the demon-quelling statutes command.\n\n**Right: Exorcist Standard**\nCarve a lion’s head from maple wood, adorned with colors as prescribed. Then take azure silk, three feet six inches in length and one foot five inches in width, and inscribe the talisman in gold paint. Affix twenty-four silver bells along its borders, strung with yellow thread and crimson cords.\n\n**Left: Azure Dragon Feathered Regalia Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nThunder’s prosperity, nine *qi* arise,\nMisty and lush, the Azure Palace.\nVital *qi* layer upon layer,\nTransforming into nine dragons.\nWood Duke rides the *qi*,\nHis hue a verdant green.\nGuard my soul,\nThat I may ascend to the Emperor’s palace.\n\n**Right: White Tiger Feathered Regalia Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nWestern Metal’s radiant *qi*,\nFierce and mighty in execution.\nDrumming roars stir the wind,\nAscending to the Great Void.\nOverseeing Metal’s assembly,\nDescending to the cinnabar steps.\nRefining the spirit’s brilliance,\nAscending into the Jade Void.\n\n**Front: Vermilion Phoenix Feathered Regalia Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nScorching brightness, true and mysterious,\nGlowing upon the Cinnabar Heaven.\nCrimson phoenix soars in flight,\nRed mist thick and warm.\nYin demons and corpse impurities,\nTurn to ash and smoke.\nRefining spirit and *qi* to fulfillment,\nAscending to true immortality.\n\n**Rear: Dark Warrior Feathered Regalia Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nMysterious and profound, the true *qi*,\nSerene and clear as waves.\nBelow lies the numinous tortoise,\nDevouring evil and consuming demons.\nScouring away dust and filth,\n*Qi* harmoniously surging.\nNurturing my primordial essence,\nAscending to the Great Luo.\n\n**Right: Four Numinous Beasts**\nAccording to their directional colors, fashion banners from silk, each three feet six inches in length. Inscribe the talismans in vermilion and position them in their respective directions.\n\n**Three Dawns Talisman**\nInscribe in vermilion lacquer with golden seal script, placing it before the Three Treasures. Prepare inkstone and write in red gold.\n*Incantation:*\nCavernous yang shines resplendent,\nJade light pure and bright.\nMerging with the celestial pivot,\nThree *qi* mysterious and true.\nBelow, responding to the spirit chamber,\nEssence and *qi* unite with spirit.\nDescending radiance upon the altar steps,\nSummoning the true and beckoning the numinous.\nDemon kings bow their heads,\nTen thousand demons conceal their forms.\nHeavenly perfected descend of their own,\nGranting me eternal life.\n\n**Talisman of Communion with the True**\n*Incantation:*\n\nAt the borders of the Jade Capital’s realm,\nPurple auroras surge and soar.\nNinefold radiance gleams resplendent,\nJade pendants and girdle-gems adorn.\nTrue immortals cast their gaze below,\nRiding jade chariots in descent.\nGolden light pierces the celestial gates,\nA single treasure-pearl suspended high.\n\n**Talisman of Reaching the Numinous**\nThis is the talisman by which the Supreme Emperor summons the Three Realms.

this moment henceforth,\nUntil the rites are complete,\nAll shall be conveyed with precision,\nLest any be omitted.\n\n**Omissions:**\nIn the third month of each season, report to the Yellow Emperor;\nIn the fourth month of each season, report to the Five Emperors.\n\n*End of Volume Six of The Great Law of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mystery-Origin*\n*(Note: The original small heading is missing; supplied based on the following text.)*\n\n*Volume Seven of The Great Law of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens of the Supreme Mystery-Origin*\n**Chapter Eight: Communing with the True and Reaching the Numinous**\n\nThe Master said: Those of shallow learning, superficially devoted to the Three Treasures, are further deluded by the turbid world, mistakenly clinging to form and appearance as their own body and mind. Thus, their true origin is submerged. Amidst their frantic rushing about, they cannot commune with the true or reach the numinous—how lamentable!\n\nTherefore, this chapter on \"Communing with the True\" is established, employing ritual dignity to guard against external distractions. Through the secret practice of incantations and hand seals, the scattered mind is gathered, so that the Dao may be revered through solemnity, and the heart may stand in awe through sacred forms, lest one fall into delusion and disorder.\n\nAs for those who cultivate immortality—whose minds are empty and natures still, whose Dao is complete and true—when a single thought moves, the hearts of the Two Heavens merge as one. Even so, they may rely on external ritual to commune with the true; how much more should they observe this with care!\n\n**Talismans for Offering Incense to the Ten Directions**\n\nThe Master said: The jade talismans of the ten directions are the secret methods for summoning the Brahmā, inviting the true, communing with the numinous, petitioning the Emperor, and beseeching grace. At dawn, face east; at noon, face south; at dusk, face north. Visualize the *qi* of each direction filling the sacred altar.\n\n**East:**\nSwallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times. Visualize green *qi* like clouds entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nNine *qi* of green origin,\nRiding fragrant smoke in flight.\nSummon the true, reach the numinous,\nGuard me as I ascend as an immortal.\n\n**South:**\nSwallow saliva three times, knock the teeth three times.

Visualize white *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nSeven *qi* of radiant brightness,\nWestern true ones, golden well.\nThe Emperor’s chariot swiftly descends,\nPreserving life, rooting its essence.\n\n**North:**\nSwallow saliva five times, knock the teeth five times.

Visualize green-crimson *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nTrue *qi* unites with yang,\nDescending to the jasper altar.\nA thousand true spirits gather,\nFlying into the Jade Hall.\n\n**Southwest:**\nSwallow saliva eight times, knock the teeth eight times. Visualize red-white *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nNuminous *qi*, clear and bright,\nUniting with the Dao to realize truth.\nSubduing demons, executing the wicked,\nPaying homage to the flying spirits.\n\n**Northwest:**\nSwallow saliva twice, knock the teeth twice. Visualize white-black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nUpright *qi*, vast and boundless,\nJade light of the mysterious altar.\nCorpse-demons perish and fall,\nPaying homage to my Primordial Emperor.\n\n**Above:**\nSwallow saliva twice, knock the teeth twice. Visualize golden-light *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nAuspicious *qi* descends upon the altar,\nDescending true ones, summoning immortals.\nThe Gate of Life opens above,\nEmbodying the Emperor’s precedence.\n\n**Below:**\nSwallow saliva ten times, knock the teeth ten times. Visualize black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nUpright *qi* surges forth,\nDispelling evil, repelling miasma.\nTrue visions well forth,\nDescending true ones, summoning the numinous.\n\nThe Master said: After completing the incense offerings to the ten directions, establish the earthly portal and burn the talisman for entering the portal. Recite the incantation silently. After entering, take three steps with each movement, visualizing oneself amidst the Brahmā *qi* and numinous light above the Nine Heavens, utterly unaware of the mundane world.\n\nAt this point, inwardly observe, gather the spirit, and return the hearing. Be cautious not to look back, cough, or spit. Proceed directly to the grotto altar, offer incense three times, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and burn the talisman for communing with the true. Visualize green, yellow, and white *qi* of three colors emanating from within oneself.\n\nOne must visualize offering incense three times. With each offering, visualize three-colored *qi* emerging from the crown of the head, forming a flower canopy that ascends to the Three Heavens. Then, open the incense burner.\n\n**Talisman for Communing with the True at the Grotto Altar**\n*Incantation:*\nPure *qi* forms heaven,\nTurbid *qi* forms earth.\nCentral *qi* forms humanity,\nYin and yang unerringly balanced.\nWith the heart, commune with heaven,\nHeaven’s law is revered with utmost sincerity.\nCinnabar sincerity ascends,\n*Qi*-registers dissolve transgressions.\nFrom the beginning of profound obscurity,\nSwiftly transmit the communion with the true.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nIncense is the jade blossom scattering light,\nNine *qi* congealing into mist.\nFragrant clouds densely woven,\nDirectly piercing the Nine Heavens.\nVisualize the three-colored cloud canopy,\nRising with the smoke to reach the Three Heavens.\nThe Golden Lad attendant of incense,\nThe Jade Maiden transmitter of words.\nI now submit this petition,\nHeard before the Emperor.\nDescend light, bestow *qi*,\nCommuning with the true to attain immortality.\nLongevity and eternal vision,\nSins and transgressions all absolved.\nNine generations transcend suffering,\nAscending from the dark night.\nDemon kings vouchsafe,\nThe Three Realms attend the chariot.\nMerits and virtues fulfilled,\nAscending in a cloud-borne chariot.\nMoving in and out naturally,\nAttended and guarded by the Three Heavens.\nAll petitions and wishes,\nAre granted as spoken.\n\n**Talisman for Entering the Portal**\n*Incantation:*\nEntering to pay homage to the Emperor’s true ones,\nLife’s *qi* in ninefold layers.\nInterpenetrating the dharma-body,\nYin demons are not tolerated.\nThe Red Child of the Three Fields,\nPreserves my immortal merit.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman for Opening the Incense Burner**\n*Incantation:*\n\n**Talisman for Completing the Altar Rites**\n*Incantation:*\nThe Mysterious Altar’s work is done,\nThe yang spirit guards within.\nSeal my Gate of Life,\nTrue *qi* shrouds in secrecy.\nAscending to the Emperor’s palace,\nLifespan matches Heaven’s.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman for Restoring the Incense Burner**\n*Incantation:*\nPrimordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin,\nThree merge to return to the One.\nBrahmā’s *qi* pervades the cosmos,\nNo evil may enter.\nUproot the Earth’s Gate,\nReceive the Jade Decree on high.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman for Exiting the Portal #1**\n*Incantation:*\nSummon the gods of my body,\nThe Three and Five within.\nTranscendent immortals, divine spirits,\nYang unites with yin.\nEach returns to their palace,\nGuarding my primordial essence.\nExiting the altar naturally,\nNo outer demons may invade.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the primordial statutes and ordinances!*\n\nThe above are the Ten Directions’ Incense Talismans—those for the altar’s register, kindling the burner, restoring the burner, entering and exiting the portal—all inscribed with the Jade Purity mudra, the *qi* of the cinnabar field’s inner landscape, breath held while vermilion-script is brushed on yellow silk.\n\n**Ritual Attire**\nThe Master says: Those who ascend to the Jade Hall’s realm, whose bodies approach the Three Purities, who enter the innermost sanctum—these are not the duties of the lower realms.\n\nThe Nine-Colored Cloud Robe is the attire of the Heavenly Master when attending the Jade Emperor’s chamber, the vestment of the Jade Hall.\n\n**Three-Fold Girdle with Interwoven Yellow and Purple Qi Talisman**\n*Jade Hall’s Proper Robe*\nThe robe is made of azure silk, embroidered with gold, bearing thirty-six cloud-*qi* patterns. At its center is inscribed the Great Talisman for Ascending the Hall. The girdle bears the talisman of interwoven yellow and purple *qi*, topped with a blue crown, crimson slippers, and a jade tablet.\n\n**Talisman for Rolling Up the Curtain**\nWith the Jade Purity mudra, visualize the altar’s platform radiant as polished jade. Within the void, a single luminous point, like a millet grain. The Great Veil enfolds it, penetrating as a strung pearl, guarding the Yellow Chamber’s secret decree.\n\n*Incantation:*\n*Qi* of the Great Beginning,\nUnwrought and spontaneous.\nThe void bears form,\nSuspended from the empty mystery.\nEncompassing the ten thousand beings,\nNurturing and transforming gods and immortals.\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet untransmitted.\nNo before nor after,\nMystery upon mystery.\nMay the numinous creation open,\nThat I may behold the Mysterious Origin.\n\n**Talisman for Summoning the Yang Spirit**\n*Incantation:*\nPrimordial Beginning’s □ *qi*,\nSilently moves the primordial essence.\nHarmonizing tones, aligning rhythms,\nStirring the turbid, raising the pure.\nSubtle *qi* of the profound void,\n*Qi*-image in its first coagulation.\nSpiraling through the empty vastness,\nThe sound within Heaven.\nGathering essence, descending *qi*,\nUttering the true voice.\nYin voices join in concert,\nSummoning the ten thousand spirits.\n\n**Talisman for Calling the Yin Spirit**\n*Incantation:*\nStillness births movement,\nYin returns to generate yang.\nThe Great Sound enters the wondrous,\nEchoing through the empty valley.\nVoice responds to *qi*’s seeking,\nIntermingling in harmony.\nVoice answers voice,\nTransforming the Mysterious Altar.\nThe sound of stirring yang,\nAligns with Heaven’s firmness.\nYang spirit intermingles,\nTrue *qi* blends in peace.\nStrike the golden bell once,\nTap the left tooth once.\nStrike the jade chime once,\nTap the right tooth once.\nVisualize the two *qi* within—left and right—intermingling,\nFilling the Mysterious Altar.\n\n*Thus concludes Scroll Seven of The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites.*\n\n*Scroll Eight of The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites begins: Chapter Nine, \"Subduing Demons and Overcoming Malevolence.\"*\n\nThe Master said: When Heaven loses its constancy, comets and shooting stars appear. When Earth loses its constancy, springs dry and mountains collapse. When creatures lose their constancy, blossoms scatter and seedlings wither. When seasons lose their constancy, winter thunders and summer snows. These are but Heaven’s portents to issue warning—naturally, there exist methods of preservation and control.\n\nAs for the calamities of common folk, they differ from these. There may be twin-headed serpents writhing in combat, wild beasts entering homes, birds shrieking at rooftops, phantom voices echoing before and behind, strange hues shifting high and low, vipers and pythons blocking paths in frenzied entanglement, chickens and dogs crowing or barking out of season, looms suddenly tangling, doors swinging open on their own, foxes circling walls, dragons and serpents slithering into wells—such manifold omens cannot be fully recounted.\n\nFor the noble person, virtue overcomes malevolence. For the petty person, the self is no match for malevolence. When one’s power wanes, how can disaster be averted? Yet if exorcism is performed, will fortune not return? Thus arise the methods of repelling and subduing.\n\nThe Master said: When Heaven and Earth grow dark and murky, and dragons or mirage-beasts enter household wells, one should use talismans to suppress them. The malevolence will vanish of itself and be unable to cause harm.\n\n**Talisman for Repelling Dragons Entering Wells**\nAssume the Northern Emperor Mudra, wield the *qi*-charged brush, recite the Dipper Taboo seven times, face the *gang* and inscribe the talisman on a fresh brick, then cast it into the water where the creature lurks.\n\n**Talisman for Repelling Serpents Entering Wells**\nProceed with the same method as above.\n\n**Method for Repelling Well Overflow**\nAssume the Dipper Mudra and recite the incantation, face the *gang* and inscribe the talisman on yellow paper, then burn it in the well. Recite the incantation again to command it.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Hark! Dragon spirit, be pacified and guard the pure spring.\nMalevolent vapors disperse, earthly specters conceal their forms.\nO Clear and Cool Youth, receive the talisman and proclaim its decree.\nNeither overflow nor dry up—fortune flows ceaselessly.\nMay the myriad spirits protect this immortal source.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Northern Emperor commands!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Canine Specters**\nInscribe the *wu* character, face the *yin-sha* direction, harness northern *qi*, recite the incantation seven times, and face the *gang* to write the talisman. Prepare four copies: one to burn in the hearth, three to nail above the privy. Recite the incantation again and spray water for great auspiciousness.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"By jade decree, the exorcism descends—receive this sacred writ.\nMalevolent beasts and hidden specters disturb the loyal and good.\nThose who defy my incantation—let the hundred specters perish.\nThose who violate my talisman—let the demonic vanish without trace.\nDisaster cannot harm, calamity cannot wound.\nMay the myriad spirits guard and defend, ever bestowing good fortune.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the Northern Emperor’s command!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Crows Cawing Overhead**\nInscribe the *wu* character, harness southern *qi*, recite the incantation nine times, face south to write the talisman, then burn it in the open air. The specter will disperse, and good fortune will descend at once.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"O divine bird, divine crow, universally bestow good fortune.\nThough you gather and caw, you cannot bring misfortune.\nCrow spirit, obey the command—where the talisman arrives, comply.\nTo fly is to bring blessing; to caw is to bring prosperity.\nThrough all twelve hours, may no harm or injury befall.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Vermilion Bird of the South shines with radiant decree!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Wild Beasts Entering Homes**\nShake the Dipper Mudra, face the *gang* to harness *qi*, recite the incantation twelve times, and inscribe the talisman on a wooden tablet. Nail it at the four corners of the house, and also write on yellow paper to burn in the central courtyard. Pace the Dipper while reciting the incantation, then spray water to command it—the specter will cause no harm.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"By the might of the Celestial Stem, sweep away malevolent spirits.\nWild boars, seductive foxes, and the spirits of mountain specters—\nHasten a thousand *li* away; dare not linger.\nShould any dare to trespass, behead them without form.\nWhere the *Kuigang* points, crush them to dust.\nIf you depart swiftly, I shall pardon your dark transgressions.\nI uphold the great might and virtue of the Celestial Stem’s fiery decree!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Utensils That Sound, Break, or Move on Their Own**\nPace the Dipper *gang*, turn to face north, and inscribe three talismans facing the *gang*. Hang one in the central courtyard, burn one in the hearth, and affix one above the privy. Recite the incantation and spray water to remedy it.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"By the divine might of the Celestial Stem, universally sweep away misfortune.\nSuppress specters and pacify demons—let *chimei* conceal themselves.\nTurn misfortune to fortune, transform calamity to blessing.\nThose who dare defy this decree shall be seized by the *Kuigang*.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Northern Emperor commands!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Ghostly Voices Outside the Door at Night**\nThis portends the listener’s soul departing—a sign of impending death. Perform exorcism at once.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"The Heavenly Emperor commands me to restrain and subdue spirits and specters.\nDare any demonic anomaly disturb my good people?\nYin and yang intermingle—mortals hear ghostly voices.\nThey harm the human soul, startling and disturbing the spirit.\nWhere the divine talisman arrives, seal the ghostly gate.\nDepart swiftly, depart swiftly—dare not linger!\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the Northern Emperor’s command!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Livestock Dying on Their Own**\nInscribe the *sha* character, recite the incantation three times, infuse the brush with eastern *qi* to write the talisman, and burn it where the livestock died. Burn another copy to fumigate—the specter will be unable to cause further harm, and peace will be restored.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"I uphold Heaven’s decree to subdue misfortune and calamity.\nHow dare the specters of beasts and livestock bring harm?\nBy the radiance of the *gang*, drive them away and bestow good fortune.\nMay the myriad spirits guard and defend, gathering blessings for eternal prosperity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by the fiery decree of the Dipper *gang*!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Doors Closing on Their Own**\nAssume the Flying Dipper Mudra, recite the incantation twelve times, harness northern *qi* to write the talisman, and burn it where the specter lingers. Affix another copy to the door—the specter will vanish, unable to cause harm, and the household will flourish with fortune and blessings.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"The Star of Fortune shines brightly, the Three Luminaries illuminate clearly.\nRadiant light pervades the eight directions, suppressing and sealing demonic spirits.\nDisasters and misfortunes scatter—doors and gates become serene.\nMyriad *qi* fill the defenses, naturally reviving prosperity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Emperor commands!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Chickens Flying and Crowing Abnormally**\nInscribe the talisman on cypress wood and nail it to the east. Assume the Dipper Mudra to face the *gang* and harness *qi*, recite the incantation, and spray water—the specter will vanish, transforming misfortune into prosperity.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Before the sun rises, the golden rooster does not crow.\nIf it crows, it becomes a specter, harming my living spirits.\nThe Supreme has decreed to restrain and subdue demonic spirits.\nDrive the specter ten thousand *li* away, dispelling misfortune and pacifying the mind.\nAll is auspicious, the human path is at peace.\nI uphold the radiant canopy of the Dipper’s decree!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Serpent Specters**\nAssume the Dipper Mudra, face the *gang* to write the talisman. If the specter appears as a human-faced being crouching on the wall, spray water to command it. Burn the talisman where the specter lingers, and have the afflicted person wear another copy. Write another on a brick and bury it beneath the local earth god’s shrine—great fortune will ensue, transforming calamity into blessing.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Hasten, hasten! Ten-thousand-*zhang* flying serpents—\nRestrain and subdue disaster and peril; those who see you come to no harm.\nThose who harm me—hasten to drive them away!\nYou are a lowly specter—dare not trouble me.\nThose who violate my talisman shall be dismembered.\nForever mirror this auspicious ground, securely restrained without mishap.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as commanded—by the blazing fire of Heaven’s might!\"*\n\n**Method for Repelling Rat Specters**\nAssume the *zi* Mudra, harness northern *qi* to write the talisman, and hang it on a bamboo pole at the *zi* position—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Wu-su, seize! Yu-su, seize!\nO parents of the vaulted heavens, with a thousand hundred kin—\nI now recognize your specter and command it to cease.\nI order you to restrain your specter and prevent it from acting.\nShould you act recklessly, the Celestial Stem shall execute you.\nI uphold the decree of the Dark Heavenly Emperor!\"*\n\n**Daily Talismans for Warding Off Specters and Repelling Evil**\nPrepare twenty-two talismans, inscribing the day and branch on front and back according to the date. For example, if a specter appears on the *jiazi* day, write the *jia* talisman on the front and the *zi* talisman on the back, then carry it on your person.\n\n**General Principles of Talisman-Writing**\n\nAll talismans must be inscribed with the Dipper Mudra, *gang qi*, and cinnabar ink. Have the afflicted person wear it to avert misfortune and attract auspicious omens. After inscribing the talisman, recite the *Great Exorcism Mantra* seven times to consecrate it.\n\n**Mantra:**\n*With the Sword Mudra, seven times—sprinkle water upon the afflicted.*\n*\"August Heaven births me, Heaven is my father.\nAugust Earth bears me, Earth is my mother.\nSun and Moon harmonize in aid, above and below the Dipper shines.\nThe Northern Dipper’s *Kui Gang* slays evil in ten thousand directions.\nDemons shall not become specters, evil shall not bring calamity.\nThose who violate this talisman shall die; those who defy it shall perish.\nMysterious Yellow generates *qi*, universally bestowing good fortune.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars—destroy demons, slay specters—by decree!\"*\n\n**Additional Mantra:**\nBefore reciting, first direct the *qi* of the Three Lights to envelop the afflicted in a net of radiance. Then chant the mantra seven times, commanding the afflicted to retreat nine steps. Point the Dipper’s handle at them, summon them before you, and sprinkle water thrice. Affix the talisman to their person, and all specters shall forever cease their mischief.\n*\"The Most High issues the decree: slay ghosts, eliminate harm.\nHeaven is my canopy, Earth is my foundation.\nThe Northern Dipper’s starlight is my raiment.\nLeft *Gang*, right Fire—banish and restrain inauspicious forces.\nReturn misfortune to fortune, dispel disaster and repel harm.\nNo evil shall invade; specters and demons shall retreat.\nSee the specter yet not be alarmed—its power shall crumble.\n*Yuan Heng Li Zhen*—ten thousand years of prosperity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the True Fire of the Crimson Heaven—by decree!\"*\n\n**Chapter Ten: Expelling Evil and Upholding Righteousness**\n\nThe Master said: *\"Harmonizing the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth is called a talisman. Humans receive the proper balance of yin and yang to be born—this is the Three Lights. Whenever cold, heat, wind, or summer heat transgress and cause injury, the transgression deviates from the upright; deviation from the upright becomes evil—not merely a curse, but a fundamental disorder. It must be remedied with the *qi* of the Three Lights. Thus it is said: Harmonizing the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth is called a talisman. The Three Lights are how Heaven enacts transformations and governs spirits and demons. Therefore: the Sun is the essence of all yang; the stars are the essence of all yin; the Moon receives yang to shine. Where the Three Lights illuminate, rain, snow, and gloom dissipate without obstruction; fox demons and monstrous birds scatter without provocation. The sages and revered masters, borrowing the truth of divine incantations, looked upward to draw the essence of the Three Lights. We, too, harmonize them with sincerity, and the talisman unites with their numinous power. When yin evil encroaches upon a person—becoming a specter, a monstrosity, an illness, or a plague—it is like rain and snow manifesting, like fox demons and monstrous birds encountering broad daylight: it need not be driven away to vanish without a trace. Though talismanic scripts are many, which surpass the Five Lights? Thus, the Three Lights are placed first.\"*\n\n**Talisman of the Three Lights**\nThis is the *Ancestral Talisman of the Three Lights*, the origin of all methods and the honor of the Three Realms. It annihilates all evil, preserves and harmonizes true *qi*, and its virtues cannot be fully described. A hundred thousand myriad transformations all emerge from this talisman, so its application is simple yet it is the foundation of all methods. Inscribe it in cinnabar on a square inch of lightweight paper, prepare three copies, and swallow them with jujube decoction. It cures all demonic afflictions and is called the *Talisman for Subduing Curses and Curing Evil*.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Uprightness does not become evil. Thus, the method that destroys evil is the upright method. There is no need to curry favor with ghosts and spirits—it rests solely with the ritual master. Cultivate the Three Realms in the mind, ingest the Three Lights, and when inner cultivation is full, external evil will naturally submit.\"*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Canopy and Golden-Browed Lord Lao’s Transformation**\nFirst visualize a golden light within the crown of the head. Lord Lao’s brows respond, his face golden. The practitioner silently recites the *Heavenly Canopy’s* original mantra once, twice, thrice, and beholds the Golden-Browed Lord Lao ascending into the void, transforming into the true form of the Heavenly Canopy. Recite the original mantra, then inscribe the talisman’s *qi*-slaying form with the brush. With a single stroke of the divine blade, write the Sword Talisman, followed by the command characters. *\"Hastily obey the Northern Emperor’s decree!\"* Use the Northern Emperor’s Mudra, inscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, one foot and six inches in length, and fumigate the afflicted.\n\n**Talisman of the Dipper’s *Kui* and Great Virtue’s Fire**\nFirst visualize the Seven Stars of the Dipper in the sky, the *Gang* star pointing forward. Step into the Dipper, absorb *qi* into the abdomen, and feel warmth. Then begin writing, exhaling *gang qi* to guide the brush. Inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Three Primordials’ Ding-Jia Response Talisman**\nWhen inscribing this talisman, step into the Dipper to greet the *Gang*, visualize the Celestial *Gang* on the red paper, grind cinnabar facing the sun, grasp the *Gang* Mudra, and inscribe with a single breath. When dispatching the talisman, burn gold coins and *Jia* horses beforehand.\n\n**Seven Slayings Talisman**\nThis talisman possesses great power, subduing fierce evil, destroying malevolent shrines, and eliciting divine responses—its wonders cannot be fully described. Step into the Dipper, grasp the Dipper Mudra, inscribe with *qi*, paper, and ink, face the *Gang*, exhale fire to activate it, and burn it in the central courtyard. This talisman has been corrected by the Three Heavens and proclaimed to ancestral altars, with extraordinary efficacy.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The Seven Slayings Talisman has been transmitted through the ages, but its talismanic script was unclear, and many uses failed. Now, with the rise of the Teaching Master and the flourishing of the Great Teaching, all Northern Pole talismans and documents from the Jade Altar have been requested, decreed, and bestowed here. Scattered, its form is wondrously subtle; gathered, its form is mighty and brave.\"*\n\n**Dipper-*Gang* Talisman**\nThis talisman is simple yet divinely efficacious, requiring no embellishment or elaborate application. Formed into pills, it can be ingested or fumigated; when worn, *Gang* fire spans the heavens, and ghosts and spirits dare not approach. Use the Dipper Mudra and northern *qi*.\n\n**Talisman Summoning and Commanding Mantra**\n*\"Riding the *Kui*, opposing the *Gang*, blazing with dragon fire.\nAbove Heaven, below Earth—annihilate inauspicious forces.\nShould any dare resist, they shall be reduced to flying ash.\nPlunge ten thousand fathoms into the earth, follow the talisman’s path—never to return for ten thousand kalpas.\nSolemnly summon the Heavenly Generals within the talisman to accompany and guard it.\nThose who violate the talisman’s command shall be shattered by thunderbolts.\nFire decree, fire decree—by the Emperor’s command, act!\nFlowing fire for ten thousand miles—no ghost shall escape its form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by decree!\"*\n\n*Concluding Volume Eight of the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n*Scripture Title:* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.\n\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty fascicles.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.\n\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Fascicle Nine*\n*Chapter Eleven: Summoning and Subjugation of the Nether Prison*\n\nThe Master said: For those mountain specters lingering through kalpas, water spirits haunting for years, celestial demons and heterodox ways, blood-feasting deities, the Five Penetrations beneath trees, vengeful ghosts of execution and violent death—those who gather in bands, cling to ancient shrines, usurp imperial titles and call themselves kings, or presume to style themselves Grand Marshals; those who extort temple construction, drag forth village festivals, debauch women, occupy towers, drip blood and hurl bricks, manifest forms and set fires, afflict people with malignant illness, and swiftly seize living souls—such monstrous harms are beyond remedy by ordinary methods. In our great teaching, there is the method of the Nine Springs Nether Prison to govern them.\n\nThe establishment of the prison must not be undertaken lightly. First, one must receive a petition, then issue talismans to drive and govern the offender, and dispatch proclamations to announce the decree. If they fear the law and flee, permit them to reform and renew themselves, and there is no need to proceed with subjugation—only that the human realm may be at peace. But if the demonic spirits are defiant, resisting the true method and unafraid of talismans, then this method must be employed to govern them.\n\nThe Master said: To establish the prison, first memorialize the Supreme Emperor and the Northern Dipper Mansion’s Sagely Masters, dispatching celestial soldiers and officials to descend to the designated place, build the Nether Prison, and apprehend the demonic thieves. At night, select a clean chamber and use lime to delineate the prison’s boundaries. Then post proclamations, talismanic scripts, and notices. First, divide the sections and dispatch generals and officials to pursue and capture the demonic thieves, as well as to restrain the local earth gods, city gods, and subordinate spirit officials, all bound by the Middle Punishment Talisman. Set a time limit for their capture. Next, recite the *Spell for Capturing Ghosts* and patrol the prison. Place one lamp in each prison. At dawn the following day, the ritual master burns incense and performs the rites as before. Observe their traces, and if necessary, issue talismans to hasten the capture. If the demonic band is not fully apprehended, perform the rites again at night as before. During this time, on certain nights, one may hear the sounds of interrogation and punishment—be reverent and respectful. If after one or two days no traces are found, and it is the celestial demons or heterodox ways clinging to evil, one must again memorialize the Celestial Masters to urge the dispatch of officials, who will then surely appear. After seven days, the prison may be dismantled. If among them there are truly unforgivable demonic ghosts, those whose forms are to be destroyed must have a separate *Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar* constructed.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Nine Springs Prison**\nThe Master said: The Nine Springs are the Nether Springs of Fengdu in the Northern Capital, a prison for the wicked. This matter concerns the Celestial Court and must not be undertaken lightly. Thus, Fengdu is the office of all the world’s ghosts and spirits, wielding the authority to restrain and control demonic and malevolent forces. No proclamation of might is greater than this.\n\nThe prison consists of nine divisions:\n1. **Feng Spring Command Prison**\n2. **Heavy Spring Decapitation Prison**\n3. **Yellow Spring Pursuit Prison**\n4. **Cold Spring Poison Harm Prison**\n5. **Yin Spring Dark Night Prison**\n6. **Nether Spring Slaying Prison**\n7. **Lower Spring Eternal Night Prison**\n8. **Bitter Spring Massacre Prison**\n9. **Drowning Spring Interrogation and Burning Prison**\n\nEach of the nine prisons has its designated jurisdiction:\n1. The first prison governs celestial demons.\n2. The second prison governs negligent temple officials.\n3. The third prison governs mountain specters and goblins.\n4. The fourth prison governs river and lake water spirits.\n5. The fifth prison governs blood-feasting evil deities.\n6. The sixth prison governs the tree-dwelling Five Penetrations.\n7. The seventh prison governs corpses hidden in ancient tombs.\n8. The eighth prison governs sorcerers and rebellious ghosts.\n9. The ninth prison governs those who died by execution or violent death.\n\nBefore each prison, arrange Dipper Lamps, each one foot two inches in diameter, with a two-foot-four-inch *qi* path. Before each of the nine prisons, hang a *Talisman for Pursuing Ghosts*, and within, hang a *Heavy Punishment Talisman*. At the prison gate, suspend a bamboo pole three feet long, bearing the *Proclamation for Pursuing Ghosts*. At the main gate, hang the *Talisman for Blocking Ghost Roads*. Thrice daily, at the three periods, offer incense and perform the rites. At dawn, observe the traces to discern the nature of the ghost. For minor offenses, bind and restrain them; for greater offenses, condemn them to the Three Paths of heavy labor; for the gravest offenses, erase their traces and destroy their forms.\n\n**Talismans:**\n1. **Talisman for Blocking Ghost Roads** – Can subdue all evil, restrain and pacify the myriad demons. When placed in a residence, no evil shall intrude.\n   Write it with the *Northern Emperor’s Seal Script*.\n\n**Prison Talismans:**\n1. **First Talisman**\n2. **Middle Punishment Talisman**\n3. **Lower Punishment Talisman**\n   Use three talismans, written with the *Northern Emperor’s Seal Script*. Hang one in the prison, and use one to pursue ghosts. In ordinary times, they may also be used to guard residences—ghosts and spirits dare not look upon them directly, and those who do shall be bound and shackled.\n\n**Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar**\nThe Master said: The establishment of the *Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar* is the pivot of celestial punishment, subduing all flying and earthbound demonic spirits and malevolent beings, truly eradicating the ferocious deities of mountains, forests, temples, and shrines. This is not for those who have not truly violated our teaching’s laws—it must not be undertaken lightly.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Altar:**\nUse floating sand to draw a three-tiered altar. The top tier is one *zhang* wide, the middle tier two *zhang*, and the lower tier three *zhang*. If the space is confined, adjust as needed. On the top tier, arrange the Celestial Masters and the Four Saints. On the middle tier, outside the Heavenly Gate, array the various generals, and before the Heavenly Gate, place the demon-slaying generals and officials, surrounding them with spirit talismans. At the four corners, establish gates, beginning from the *Qian* position:\n1. **Qi of Expelling Corpses and Sweeping Away Wrongs** – Gate for the descent and summoning of celestial generals.\n2. **Qi of Drowning and Clarity**\n3. **Gate of Orthodox Unity for Driving Away Evil**\n4. **Qi of Primordial Green Yang Brightness**\n5. **Qi of Severing Ghosts and Cutting Off Demons** – Gate for the merging of immortals and entry into sagehood.\n6. **Qi of Red Brightness and Cavern Yang**\n7. **Qi of Longevity and Tranquility** – Gate for the entry and exit of living spirits.\n\nEight: **Qi of Unyielding Rectitude and Stern Clarity**—Gate for the invocation of celestial generals.\n\nAt the Heavenly Gate, set up an incense table to summon and receive the descent of celestial generals. The Earthly Portal shall remain sealed to all passage, the ghostly paths forever closed, with only the Human Gate left open for transit. On the lower tier, array troops and cavalry in full encirclement, burning talismans morning and night. When the rite is performed with clarity for one or two days, the ghosts will perish of themselves, or one may hear the sound of wailing and weeping, or blood may be spilt upon the altar—all signs of its efficacy.\n\nThis method is not to be employed lightly, but reserved solely for cases of formidable demonic hordes, tangible apparitions, or monstrous anomalies that defy all other remedies.\n\n**Altar Design**\nThe Master says: Ghosts formed from the Five Phases and spirits attached to mountains and rivers do not rely on human souls to attain sentience. Objects crafted by human hands, if imbued with even fleeting potency, may over time become haunted, capable of shifting form and assuming guises to harm people and disrupt the world—often more pernicious than ordinary ghosts. Thus, the Most High established this singular method to subdue them.\n\nWhen erecting a demon-slaying altar, burn talismans at the Ghost Gate thrice daily, each time reciting the *Tianpeng* incantation and spraying the breath upon them. Within three days, profound responses will manifest.\n\nThis is a matter personally overseen by the Northern Dipper, of grave import—far beyond the scope of ordinary talismanic arts. It must never be invoked except in the face of the most extreme demonic infestations, lest severe retribution be incurred. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Mountain and Stone Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues mountain spirits, stone spirits, millennia-old steles, stone Buddhas, stone figures, stone beasts, stone tortoises, and stone dragons. Inscribe it in black ink on black paper and deliver it to the afflicted, then burn it at the site of the haunting.\n\nIf the spirit appears in human form, consorting with women or seducing men and women, await its arrival and burn this talisman upon its approach.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Wood Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues tree spirits, woodwights, millennia-old pine-dwelling ghosts, locust tree deities, wooden idols, wooden beasts, withered trees, and hollow trees that harbor spirits. Inscribe it in cinnabar on a slip of catalpa or cypress, then drive it into the tree, which will wither and die.\n\nIf the spirit manifests to harm the people, inscribe the talisman on yellow paper and burn it—the spirit will be violently destroyed.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Metal Spirits**\nThis talisman governs spirits of gold, silver, copper, and iron, including millennia-old bronze Buddhas and statues. If the day of their casting coincided with inauspicious or malevolent influences, true numen will not descend, and demonic forces will attach themselves instead.\n\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar on an iron plaque and secretly bury it beneath the statue—the ghostly spirit will flee, and the haunting will cease, regardless of whether the statue is later destroyed.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Water Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues all water spirits, including those dwelling in rivers, seas, lakes, marshes, deep pools, springs, and wells—such as jiao, shen, serpents, pythons, and wayward dragons—whose forms vary but all possess the power to stir winds and waves, capsize boats, and claim lives.\n\nIf they assume shapes to consort with women or seduce the living, burn this talisman, and the spirits will perish utterly. Inscribe it on yellow paper, affix it to an iron tablet, and cast it into the water before burning.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Ape and Spectral Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues all ape spirits—gibbons, macaques, foxes, wild boars—and spectral entities such as corpse-possessing dogs, oxen, horses, and other beasts with intact remains, collectively termed *xiao*.\n\nFor those afflicted by such spirits where other remedies fail, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper, then wear it, affix it, or burn it—the spirit will die of itself.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Blood-Consuming Demons**\nThis talisman subdues all blood-consuming demons inhabiting shrines, temples dedicated to ancient worthies, abandoned estates, empty halls, pavilions, and gardens—where malevolent ghosts gather in bands, usurping scenic sites, seizing dwellings, snatching souls, seducing women, invading dreams with feasts and songs, or possessing mediums to demand temples and sacrifices, committing myriad transgressions.\n\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar on catalpa wood and drive it into the site. Then deliver another copy to the afflicted household to be nailed in the central hall—the demonic activity will cease.\n\nThough these six talismans govern distinct afflictions, their application is uniform. When inscribing them, visualize oneself as Tianpeng. When deploying them, do likewise. Apart from distributing talismans to households or nailing them in place, burn them thrice daily at the demon-slaying altar while reciting the *Tianpeng* incantation.\n\nTo execute a spirit, cut its talisman in two at the Ghost Gate—the entity will perish. Great omens will follow: wailing in the void, blood upon the altar—all signs of its efficacy.\n\nHere ends *Scroll Nine of the Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao*.\n\n**Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao**\n*Compiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.*\n*Source: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.*\n\n**Scroll Ten of the Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao**\n**Chapter Twelve: Expelling, Purging, Exorcising, and Averting Calamities**\n\nThe Master said: To expel and dispel malign forces is called *gua*. To eliminate inauspicious and malevolent influences is called *fu*. To sever demonic bonds and break curses is called *guai*. To suppress misfortune and dissolve disasters is called *rang*. Though these four bear different names, their use in aiding the world yields the same benefit.\n\nAll who dwell between Heaven and Earth are bound within the Five Phases, and few escape their cycles of generation and destruction. Thus fortune and misfortune arise, and success or ruin, prosperity or decline, cannot be foreseen. Without the secrets of exorcism and averting calamities, how can one ensure enduring good fortune? For this reason, this chapter expounds upon these methods in detail.\n\n**Method for Subduing the Earth Duke and Earthbound Spirits**\nThe Master said: Since the Three Powers were divided and the Five Phases separated, the interplay of generation and destruction has given rise to fortune and misfortune. In all actions, regret and adversity follow—such is the work of the Earth Duke’s spirits, ever causing peril. When households construct dwellings, dig ponds, relocate mountains, or seal tombs, the deities govern every corner and direction. Should one violate their norms, disaster swiftly follows. Thus, the Most High has devised methods to subdue and pacify them, ensuring each remains in its proper place and no longer harms the living or invites calamity. The treatment is uniform; the methods are listed below.\n\n**Talisman for Pacifying Earth and Ensuring Safety**\nThis talisman is addressed to [Name], the Year Star of the *jiazi* cycle, and all deities under the Tai Sui. By command of the Most High, you are to comply: as [Household Name] undertakes construction, disturbing the spirits and baleful forces, upon receipt of this talisman, return to guard your respective directions, each resuming its rightful place. Avert misfortune, dissolve disaster, and bestow eternal good fortune. As decreed.\n\n**Talisman for Dispelling Earth Qi**\nThis talisman is specifically for subduing the Earth Duke and severing the one hundred and twenty baleful influences. When inscribing it, transform into the Heavenly Master, infuse the brush with *qi* of the Dipper, and blow upon it while writing. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper and affix it to the central courtyard.\n\nThe Master said: For the method of subduing *fulian*, first arrange the Dipper’s image in a purified chamber, offer sacrifices to the *fulian* deities, and then have the household wear the talisman.\n\n**Talisman of the Most High for Severing *Fulian***\nThis talisman severs the male and female baleful forces. Place it in a crimson pouch and wear it.\n\n**Talisman for Prohibiting Mourning Visits and *Fulian***\nSeal the corners with yellow paper, inscribe in cinnabar, and announce its burning to the Tai Sui’s direction—auspiciousness will flourish.\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Tai Sui, baleful deities, malevolent forces, male and female baleful influences, *Sangmen*, *Diaoke*, and all such spirits. By this talismanic command, return to your original positions and cease allowing baleful influences to harm the living. As this decree takes effect, depart swiftly without delay. As decreed.\n\n**Talisman for Prohibiting Tomb Litigation**\n\n**Breaking *Zhu* in the East, Refining Corpses in the South, Expelling Calamities in the West, Repelling Disasters in the North, and Severing Corpses in the Center**\n\nThe Azure Mystery and Supreme Mystery Woman Azure *Duan Zhu* Talisman is addressed to the spirit officials of the Eastern One-Nine Bureau. It opens the path for so-and-so, stabilizes their physical form, and nourishes their *ying* and *wei* protective qi, preventing the Earth Officials from driving or pressing upon them. As decreed by Woman Azure.\n\nThe Master says: In cases of tomb litigation, the household of descendants will not prosper, and misfortunes will frequently arise. It is fitting to employ this method to deliver the deceased ancestors, so that blessings may extend to descendants, and the afflictions of *yang zhu* will be forever dispelled.\n\nThe Master says: Take a fine stone, two feet and four inches in length and one foot and two inches in width. Engrave upon it the Five Talismans and bury it within the tomb, approximately thirty paces from the burial site, at a depth of three feet, in a pit three feet square. Each time a talisman is buried, recite the middle chapter of the *Divine Book*, perform the Yu Step to the *Kan* position, and inter it. This method can transcend and subdue yin corpses, extend blessings to descendants, bring prosperity to the household, and forever eliminate the afflictions of tomb litigation and *yang zhu*.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Curses**\n\nThe Master says: Those afflicted by curses will suffer from inverted hun and shen, scattered essence and po, external illnesses that linger, and may even meet their demise—truly pitiable. Some harbor private grudges and practice their malevolent arts in spirit halls or unorthodox temples, extending misfortune to descendants. There exists a method to exorcise such afflictions.\n\n**Eastern Azure Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Southern Vermilion Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Western White Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Northern Black Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Central Yellow Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n\n**General Petition Formula for the Five Directions**\nInscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, perform the offering ritual, and then it shall be auspicious.\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Eastern Curse Spirit Bureau to dispel the curses afflicting so-and-so’s household, the entanglements of vengeful oaths upon the clan, or self-inflicted curses that bring misfortune. By this talismanic command, swiftly depart to another direction. As decreed.\n\n**Method for Ensuring Progeny and Continuing the Lineage**\n\nThe Master says: When descendants are difficult to obtain, whether due to prolonged infertility, miscarriage, failure to thrive, or lack of intelligence, it is often because the feng shui of previous generations has unknowingly violated *guansha*, severing the generative qi. One should perform an offering to the Six Jia Direct Talismans, beseeching the issuance of a talismanic command to nurture the primordial qi, foster the growth of the spiritual root, and ensure the flourishing of descendants.\n\n**Talisman for Conception**\nThis talisman is for women who are barren or unable to conceive. It is fitting to establish a Six Jia ritual arena, inscribe the talisman facing the direction of the recipient’s life destiny, and have her wear it. Results will manifest within one hundred and twenty days.\n\n**Talisman for Protecting the Fetus**\nInscribe this talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar and have the pregnant woman wear it—it shall be auspicious.\n\n**Talisman for Securing the Birthing Chamber**\nInscribe three talismans on yellow paper with cinnabar and hang them in the birthing chamber, on the bed curtains, or where the mother rests. This will ensure no difficulties in childbirth.\n\nAll the aforementioned talismans should be inscribed while holding the Dipper Mudra, facing the direction of the prosperous *qi* of the *Gang*. Their efficacy will be as swift as an echo.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Ten—Concluded**\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource: *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Eleven**\n**Chapter Thirteen: Extending Life and Delivering from Calamity**\n\nThe Master says: Alas! Those of shallow learning lose their minds in the realm of worldly toil, while officials in the marketplace bury their heads in the pursuit of profit and rank. They desire to prolong life but have no means to extend it; they wish to escape calamity but have no method to deliver themselves. Thus, fate is determined by destiny, and misfortunes arise from tangible causes. For all disasters and dangers, one should rely on exorcism and thanksgiving rituals.\n\nYet the ritual gates are vast, and the Daoist methods numerous. Their efficacy varies in depth, and their effects differ in speed. Only the teachings of the Jade Hall’s Orthodox Unity, passed down through the ages, open the gate to exorcising disasters and atoning for transgressions, revealing the secrets of preserving life and extending longevity. They enable the people to avoid premature death, each safeguarding their allotted years. Truly, they serve as a bridge to transcend the world and a refuge for humanity and the heavens—how could their merit be but a small contribution?\n\nThe Master says: For men or women suffering from deep calamities or grave misfortunes, afflicted by chronic illnesses and confined to bed, or entangled in official litigation with years of household unrest, it is fitting to purify the mind and perform an offering to the Northern Dipper. Follow the ancient method to arrange the altar: lay out four clean mats around the perimeter. Choose a secluded courtyard or quiet chamber, a place undisturbed by others, where one may concentrate the spirit and sincerely invoke a response.\n\nPlace the true image against the northern wall, spread the altar before it, and position the Seven Primordial Lamps at the center. Arrange the offerings around the perimeter. Select auspicious days such as the Three Primordials, Eight Nodes, one’s life destiny birthday, the Northern Dipper’s Descending Day, the Five La Festivals, the Two She Festivals, *Gengshen* or *Jiazi* days—provided they do not conflict with the Emperor’s Harsh Days—to ensure the ritual’s efficacy.\n\nThe method for petitioning the Dipper requires submitting the memorial a day in advance and also invoking the Two Immortals, Qing and Tuo, to descend and inspect the altar site. When the night deepens, perform the ritual according to the prescribed rites. Do not let the mind wander or the proceedings falter—surely, a favorable response will manifest.\n\n**Required Items**\nNone may be omitted. As for the altar’s stabilizing offering, it may vary according to one’s means—presence or absence is not an issue, and thus it is not specified here.\nFour mats.\nNine candles.\n\nTwo catties of sesame oil. Nine portions of seasonal fruits. One catty of *jiangzhen* incense. Three taels of agarwood. Half a tael of frankincense. One tael of blended incense. Half a tael of borneol. One catty of *maoxiang* grass. One tael of cinnabar. One tael of vermilion. Twenty sheets of yellow paper. Two *ge* of light fermented soybeans, soaked. Ninety oil cakes. Half a tael of ginseng. Half a tael of *fuling* (poria). One *ge* each of glutinous rice, broomcorn millet, foxtail millet, wheat, and red beans. Forty-nine stalks of *suanzi* grass. Nine brushes. Twenty-four feet of yellow *Dao* silk. Twenty sheets of memorial paper.\n\nThe master instructs: The ritual master shall proceed to the altar site during the *xu* and *hai* hours. Beneath the mats, spread white cogon grass. The ritual table shall be placed one *zhang* away from the mats. First, ingest the *Entering the Chamber* talisman. Prepare the *Altar Diagram* and the *Bright Lamp* talisman. The lamp bowls—whether large or small—must contain the same amount of oil and wicks; no additions or subtractions are permitted, nor may the wicks be adjusted beforehand. The ritual master shall light them with paper tapers. In spring and summer, begin from [omitted character]; in autumn and winter, begin from [omitted character]. Hold the breath, then place the talismans into the lamps in the prescribed order. Beneath each lamp, hang seven talismans on banners.\n\n*Talisman for Beneath the Lamp*\n*Talisman for Within the Lamp*\n\n**Upper Terrace Preservation-Spirit Talisman**\n**Middle Terrace Pacification-Soul Talisman**\n**Lower Terrace Summoning-Corporeal-Soul Talisman**\n\nOnce the Seven Stars shine clearly, recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Heaven is profound, earth is shallow,\nSun and moon revolve in turn.\nThe Five Stars course eternally,\nMoving my celestial image above.\nI establish this altar—\nTen thousand ghosts all submit.\nWith one stroke of the divine blade,\nTen thousand ghosts scatter in flight.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!\"*\n\nNext, circumambulate the distant lamps three times, reciting:\n\n*\"Bright lamps seize the light,\nWandering spirits do not flee.\nThe seven corporeal souls rest in place,\nAll spirits return in submission.\nLike the sun at midday,\nEver abide in radiance.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!\"*\n\nRecite again:\n\n*\"Following the *gang* to erect the Dipper,\nThe ritual torch illuminates the celestial stars.\nThe Seven Sovereigns descend—\nPrimordial, prosperous, advantageous, steadfast.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law and command!\"*\n\n**First: Longevity-Extending Talisman**\nStand facing forward; burn one talisman per lamp.\n\n**Second: Calamity-Averting Talisman**\n**Third: Life-Preserving Talisman**\n**Fourth: Lifespan-Augmenting Talisman**\n**Fifth: Disaster-Dispelling Talisman**\n**Sixth: Misfortune-Dispersing Talisman**\n**Seventh: Decline-Supporting Talisman**\n\nNext, stand at the center and invoke:\n\n*\"Reverently summon the Wealth Star Lamp of the Chu division—surnamed Rao, named Li—clad in white, descend now.\nReverently summon the Longevity Star Lamp of the Jin division—surnamed Wang, named Yin—clad in purple, descend now.\nReverently summon the Fortune Star Lamp of the Zhao division—surnamed Xu, named Gai—clad in blue-green, descend now.\nReverently summon the Destiny Star Lamp of the Zeng division—surnamed Fan, named Zheng—clad in black, descend now.\nReverently summon the Male and Female Star Lamp of the Zheng division—surnamed Sima, named Lu—clad in crimson, descend now.\nReverently summon the Wife Star Lamp of the Wei division—surnamed Ji, named Qian—clad in crimson, descend now.\nReverently summon the Blessing Star Lamp of the Yan division—surnamed Long, named Deng—clad in crimson, descend now.\"*\n\nNext, offer incense, bow three times before each lamp, and observe the lamps.\n\nCircumambulate the distant lamps three times, silently reciting the incantation forty-nine times, then divine fortune or misfortune by the lamp’s light.\n\n*\"Reverently summon the Seven Perfected to descend and receive this petition and proclamation.\nBy the lamp’s brightness or dimness, know fortune or misfortune.\nBy the power of the majestic spirits,\nTen thousand wishes all comply.\"*\n\nWhen divining by the lamps, observe with a pure heart.\nIf the lamp burns brightly, it is auspicious.\nIf dim, it is inauspicious.\nIf it flickers repeatedly, it is inauspicious and unfavorable; one must earnestly perform expiatory rites.\nFor unclear omens, base the interpretation on the affairs governed by the respective star.\n\nIf the lamp’s light does not return, prepare in advance a black robe, black bellyband, and black headwrap, each inscribed with a talisman, and wear them—let no one see, and if asked, do not answer. This may also be done before sleep at night.\n\nIf a lamp’s flame is blue-green: it indicates a dormant corpse.\nIf red: wandering baleful lights, blood taboos, or malevolent ghosts.\nIf white: legal disputes at the household gate, or illness that will not heal.\nIf black: illness or inauspiciousness.\nIf yellow: affliction by earthly pestilence.\nIf bright then dim, dim then bright: ghosts and spirits cause disorder.\nIf it fails to light at first, or the oil bowl is overturned: *xiao* ghosts swarm, laboring insects fly and crouch, and the sick will not recover.\n\nIn such cases, proceed as with the garments above.\nIf the Fortune or Longevity Star’s lamp dims, it likewise requires expiation with black headgear.\n\nThe Master says: *\"For divining household affairs, use the seven lamps collectively, regardless of the specific matter at hand.\nOne must avoid the presence of sparrow hawks, dogs, cats, monks, nuns, or women, for their defilement will pollute the altar, preventing the descent of the lofty Perfected and instead inviting transgression.\"*\n\n**Expiatory Lamp Talisman for Resolving and Dispelling Inauspiciousness**\nWrite the talisman while reciting the incantation;\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Incantation**\nInscribe upon black garments or write on yellow paper and place within the garments.\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Supreme divine talisman,\nresolves and dispels inauspiciousness.\nRadiant light preserves life,\naverts calamity and prolongs existence.\nAlter form, change attire,\nblack baleful forces remove misfortune.\nEncircling the floral canopy,\nclothed in the light of the Dipper.\nEvil cannot harm,\nghosts cannot injure.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\n**Seven Talismans for the Offering Ritual**\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Zǐ Xīn, Primordial Lady,\ngoverns and manifests the soul.\nLuminous splendor curves and reflects,\nilluminating the dark and obscure.\nGrant your majestic radiance,\ntrue qi unites with the soul.\nMaster’s body and mind,\nwhere spirit and qi converge,\nbestow longevity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Sacred spirit within Zǐ,\nradiance and light preserve the true.\nJade brilliance scatters mist,\nsun and moon race as one.\nUphold this servant’s fate,\nnurture the spleen’s hun-soul.\nMaster’s hun-soul and spirit,\nwhere spirit and qi converge,\nbestow peace and tranquility.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Zǐ Huì, Great Sage,\nluminous and mystically penetrating.\nDivine perfection, jade majesty,\nascends to the dark heavens.\nMay this servant’s name in the register of fate\nendure eternally without end.\nMaster’s essence and spirit,\ninfused through the hundred passages,\nnurture qi and pacify the spirit.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Zǐ Zhèng, Scribe of Destiny,\nbroadly delivers the multitudes.\nThe people’s fortune and misfortune\nall belong to the azure vault.\nBestow reversal of ill fortune,\npreserve life and extend its span.\nGuard the human spirit and soul,\nprotect life and increase its years,\nqi attains peace and tranquility.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Zǐ Tōng, Master of the Yin,\nlet this servant’s emotions flow freely.\nThree measures drift into the vast,\nthe body enters the mysterious numen.\nLife is preserved naturally,\nbestow longevity.\nIrrigate the bodily form,\ninscribe merit and conduct,\nmaster joy and harmony.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\n*\"Zǐ Chōng, Black Emperor of the North,\nlet the command enter the subtle and profound.\nThis servant prays to the Dao/Way,\nthe mandate aligns with the mysterious mechanism.\nMerit reaches the wondrous extreme,\nascending to ride the cloudy regalia.\nMajesty subdues Heaven and Earth,\nthe master attains long life,\ngreatly bestowed with numinous power.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Zǐ Cháng, Breaker of Armies,\nnuminous power is most revered.\nRadiant light spouts flames,\ngreatly bestowed with majestic spirit.\nGrant long life,\neternal peace for the soul.\nMajesty subdues ghosts and spirits,\nsever and eradicate malevolent ghosts,\nthe Dipper’s calculations bind the numinous.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\"*\n\nFor the talisman and incantation: burn one talisman, recite the incantation once, and bow. Combine this with the Mudra of the Northern Emperor. Upon completion of the recitation, pace the Dipper to the altar and present the memorial.\n\n**Oral Instructions:**\nThe master says: First, concentrate the spirit and stabilize the will, pace the Dipper and bow nine times. Then, emerge as an official, pace the Dipper again, visualize the primordial qi of the Mysterious and Yellow, and imagine the body seated at the Dipper’s mouth. The five viscera emit their original-colored qi, coalescing into a precious cloud, a golden bridge ascending to the Central Heaven. Next, together with the officials and clerks, carry the memorial up the bridge. Midway, encounter an emissary in embroidered robes, who receives the memorial and departs. In a moment, the petitioner is led to the Stellar Palace. After the audience concludes, after a long while, golden light ten thousand fathoms long emanates as the Nine Sovereigns emerge from their palace. Flying rays like cinnabar enter the petitioner’s crown. One sees the light penetrating the hundred bones, senses the body suffused with warmth and radiance, the light ascending through the crown and reddening the face—this is true yang nurturing the form, and the prayer will surely be answered.\n\nThe master says: The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. The Great Chief of the Central Dipper oversees all spirits; it is the revered Northern Dipper, to which the myriad numina of the Three Realms, celestial gods, and earthly deities all submit. Moreover, the lives of ordinary people belong entirely to the Northern Dipper. When faced with calamity or adversity, how can one not contemplate means of supplication and exorcism? This section on extending life is uniquely detailed in the memorial to the Dipper. Those who study this may regard it as a treasure for saving the world. Revere it, revere it.\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Eleven of the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty volumes.\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Volume Twelve*\n*Chapter Fourteen: Augmenting Blessings and Longevity*\n\nThe Master said: The scriptures state that the Southern Dipper governs the Li Palace, its name shared with the sun, and the spirit it bestows upon humans is called the *hun*. It presides over the yang offices, administering the Fire Emperor, and in its dynamic application, no virtue surpasses it. Together with the Northern Dipper’s Seven Governors, it shares the duty of governance. In times of urgent peril, one should perform rites of thanksgiving to the Southern Dipper, arranging torches and bright lamps as in the Northern Dipper’s method. Now, the Northern Dipper’s rites include both supplication and requital, for it holds life and death in particular gravity—hence its methods are especially detailed. The Southern Dipper, however, is the office of life’s augmentation, governing blessings and longevity, and thus concerns itself solely with the entreaty of grace. Without talismans, one cannot summon its response; without incantations, one cannot unite with its numen. Therefore, this section again sets forth the ritual method, appending the Dipper’s lamps, banners, and talismans below.\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Mansion’s Director of Destinies, Supreme General and True Lord Who Guards the Realm**\n*Incantation:*\nDirector of Destinies, True Lord,\nPreserve my long life.\nLet no calamity assail me,\nLet my nine orifices shine with light.\nMay you descend true *qi*,\nAnd unite with this talisman.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Appearance’s Registrar of Records, Supreme Minister and True Lord Who Guards the Peaks**\n*Incantation:*\nRegistrar of Records, True Lord,\nPreserve my thousand years.\nLet ten thousand *qi* shine with light,\nGuard my true form.\nMay you descend true *qi*,\nAnd preserve me in spontaneity.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Beam’s Prolonger of Life, True Lord Who Protects Destiny**\n*Incantation:*\nProtector of Destiny, True Lord,\nGuard my *hun* and essence.\nSever the roots of death,\nRestore my *qi* to its primal origin.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nAnd unite with your servant in numinous union.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Uniformity’s Increaser of Years, True Lord Who Preserves Life**\n*Incantation:*\nBestower of Life, True Lord,\nAugment my years of longevity.\nLet harmonious true *qi* flow,\nNurturing the spirit with refinement.\nMay you descend upright *qi*,\nTo preserve my life and truth.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Pivot’s Deliverer from Adversity, True Lord of Literary Florescence Who Refines the *Hun***\n*Incantation:*\nRefiner of the *Hun*, True Lord,\nCultivate and forge living beings.\nTransform the yin corpse through refinement,\nTransmute mortals into immortals.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nAnd let my destiny soar in cycles.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Mechanism’s Supervisor of Life, Grand Minister and True Lord of Great Principle**\n*Incantation:*\nTrue Lord of Great Principle,\nProlong life and deliver destiny.\nShield the body, preserve life,\nDispel misfortune and scatter calamity.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nThat I may pass through kalpas unscathed.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nFor each, visualize the star’s radiance and grasp the corresponding hand seal:\n*Midnight, Ox, Midday, Lake, Fire, Horse.*\nInscribe banners on yellow silk with cinnabar, and suspend them beneath each lamp’s position. Further, inscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, then burn and scatter the talismans into each lamp’s bowl.\n\nThe Master said: When presenting offerings to the Southern Dipper, arrange six lamps and torches. At the time of the rite, further dispatch six talismans, inscribed on red paper with yellow ink, using the same hand seals as before:\n1. Talisman of the Director of Destinies\n2. Talisman of the Registrar of Records\n3. Talisman of the Prolonger of Life (Talisman of the Protector of Destiny)\n4. Talisman of the Preserver of Life\n5. Talisman of the Refiner of the *Hun*\n6. Talisman of the Grand Minister\n\n**Talisman of the Six True Lords’ Vermilion Chariot and Jade Conveyance**\n*Incantation:*\nThe heavens possess radiance,\nThe Southern True Lords’ jade brilliance.\nShed light to protect destiny,\nDeliver from adversity and avert wrongdoing.\nToday is most auspicious,\nAs we behold the numinous presence.\nDescend with the lamps’ glow,\nDispelling darkness with splendor.\nAugment my years of longevity,\nGrant me the immortal’s term.\nRelease me from suffering,\nSever my Three Corpses.\nMay I attain long life spontaneously,\nChewing the mysterious fungus.\nSwiftly descend in cloud-borne chariots,\nTo attend the imperial chariot.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nVisualize each star’s blazing, molten *qi*—neither purple nor white, neither gold nor jade, but its natural hue—descending into the lamps to seek numinous verification. If the adept wishes to entreat the recording of years, circumambulate the lamps three times, silently recite the incantation, and burn the talisman in requital. If the lamp’s flame grows by an inch, one has obtained the sign of long life.\n\n**Talisman for Prolonging Life by Entreaty to the Lamps**\nCircumambulate these six lamps, burn six talismans, and regard brightness as auspicious. If the flames grow long and red, one has received the proof of long life.\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Twelve of the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.\n\n**Title:** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Compiled by:** Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty\n**Thirty Scrolls**\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category\n\n**Scroll Thirteen of the** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Chapter Fifteen: Severing Pestilence and Cutting Off Epidemics**\n\nThe Master said: People born into this world recklessly muddy body and mind, deluded by desires and cravings, unable to circulate and nurture their *qi*. Thus, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness injure them from without, while excess and exhaustion deplete them from within. This causes the four great elements of the body to scatter and *qi* to wane, weakening strength and wearying the spirit.\n\nWhen essence and *qi* falter, primordial *qi* is no longer secure, and epidemics arise. Yet if one regulates daily life to avoid cold and heat, moderates diet to nourish the transient body, and severs lustful thoughts to secure primordial essence, then true *qi* will not scatter, blood and *qi* will circulate freely, and one will enter the Dao and commune with the real. How then could one suffer from malignant diseases or seek methods to subdue them?\n\nThus the *Medical Classic* states: *\"If one does not fall ill with pestilence in spring, it is because one stored essence in winter.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nNow, out of compassion, the Most High establishes methods of subjugation to save the people of the latter age, that they may avoid untimely death and be spared from violent demise, ascending to benevolence and longevity—this is the Most High’s fundamental heart of cherishing life.\n\nThe scriptures say: In times past, people were benevolent, righteous, and pure, free from malice, untouched by untimely death, and ghosts did not harm them wantonly. But in this latter age, the era is degenerate, human hearts are corrupted, the five emotions are in chaos, and doubts multiply. People act at will, distrusting proper teachings and embracing perverse conduct. They turn from truth to falsehood, abandon the Dao and benevolence, defy heaven and earth, slaughter living beings, are disloyal and unfilial, devoid of love and compassion. They harm lives and accumulate karmic adversaries, inviting calamities to spread, families to suffer epidemics, and bodies to endure toxic *qi*, bringing illness and death to all.\n\nFor this, the *qi* of the Six Heavens, the Lord of Northern Fengdu, the marshals of the ghost legions, the generals of the human realm, and the deities of the Five Peaks traverse the world, bearing the burden of their transgressions. They release toxic *qi* to slay the wicked.\n\nThus the Most High established methods of control. The *Laws of Lady Green* states: *\"If one knows the names of the pestilence ghosts, they dare not cause harm. Call their names thrice, and the ghosts will perish of themselves.\"*\n\n**Eastern Green Pestilence Ghost:** Liu Yuanda, essence of Wood, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of malign wind.\n**Southern Red Pestilence Ghost:** Zhang Yuanbo, essence of Fire, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of heat toxin.\n**Western White Pestilence Ghost:** Zhao Gongming, essence of Metal, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of black flux.\n**Northern Black Pestilence Ghost:** Zhong Shiji, essence of Water, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of malignant toxin.\n**Central Yellow Pestilence Ghost:** Shi Wenye, essence of Earth, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread malignant sores and swellings.\n\n**Eastern Pestilence Ghost:** Jiu Da\n**Southern Pestilence Ghost:** Shi Yan\n**Western Pestilence Ghost:** Yao\n**Northern Pestilence Ghost:** Tian Xia\n**Central Pestilence Ghost:** Da Huangnu\n**Sixth Pestilence Ghost:** Zhu Nü\n**Seventh Pestilence Ghost:** Bo Ling\n\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Paternal Grandfather:** Liang Zhou\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Paternal Grandmother:** Jiao Cheng\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Father:** Yan Nian\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Mother:** Chu Zhong\n\nThe five directional pestilence ghosts, seven brothers in all, together with their grandparents and parents, total eleven forms. They fly and move, spreading toxins with the moon to harm the wicked. Yet the Most High, in cherishing life, has talismanic methods to control them, so they cannot cause harm.\n\n**Pestilence Ghosts by Month:**\n**First Month:** Wei\n**Second Month:** Zhong (also called Xing)\n**Third Month:** Liu\n**Fourth Month:** Cun\n**Fifth Month:** Lei (pronounced *qi*)\n**Sixth Month:** Mou (also called □)\n**Seventh Month:** Xing\n**Eighth Month:** Huai\n**Ninth Month:** Chen\n**Tenth Month:** Bei\n**Eleventh Month:** Ying\n**Twelfth Month:** Jian\n\n**Pestilence Ghosts by Day:**\n**Zi Day:** Gen\n**Chou Day:** Dang\n**Yin Day:** Yi\n**Mao Day:** Yi\n**Chen Day:** E\n**Si Day:** Ai\n**Wu Day:** Wu\n**Wei Day:** Nu Chang\n**Shen Day:** Mu\n**You Day:** Shi\n**Xu Day:** Zhi\n**Hai Day:** You\n\nThese pestilence ghosts preside over their respective months and days, following Liu Yuanda and the others to release toxins and cause harm. All people of the five phases who do not practice the Dao and its precepts, who are disloyal and unfilial, unbenevolent and unrighteous, will suffer their misfortunes. Yet those who practice the Dao and follow its teachings, knowing their names, will subdue them. Those who should depart will flee far away; those who remain will repel their evil factions. They will bind one another, refraining from harming the good. Call their names thrice, and they will hide in terror.\n\n**Gu Toxin Ghosts:**\n**First Gu Toxin Ghost:** Han Qu\n**Second Gu Toxin Ghost:** Jiu\n**Third Gu Toxin Ghost:** Li Jiu\n**Fourth Gu Toxin Ghost:** Cheng Yan\n**Fifth Gu Toxin Ghost:** Bu Shi\n**Sixth Gu Toxin Ghost:** Wu Wu\n**Seventh Gu Toxin Ghost:** Yuan Zhi\n**Eighth Gu Toxin Ghost:** Shi Gan\n**Ninth Gu Toxin Ghost:** Yu Yi\n\nThese nine ghosts spread evil and disorder across the world, acting alongside the pestilence ghost Da Huangnu to disseminate perverse toxins. All are controlled by talismans.\n\n**Heavenly Master’s Pestilence-Expelling Talisman**\nInscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, with incantations as hidden language. Dispatch the Heavenly Ding warriors to release the *qi* of the Three Luminaries and expel the *qi* of perverse spirits.\n\n**Method for Expelling Pestilence with Cypress Tablets**\nUse cypress tablets inscribed in cinnabar. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Hark! Ghosts of the Six Jia and Six Yi, bearing afflictions—depart swiftly to the Six Bing and Six Ding! I know your names; flee a thousand leagues without delay. Linger but a moment, and I shall dispatch the Great Spirit, towering a thousand fathoms high, with five eyes blazing, wielding iron chains to seize your form. With mighty pincers, I shall tear out your tongue and devour your flesh. Once your form is destroyed, you shall languish in the dark abyss for ten thousand kalpas. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Lord Lao’s statutes!\"*\n\nThe Master says: *\"In years of plague and calamity, when ghosts and demons roam unchecked, those who seek deliverance must recite this divine incantation with utmost sincerity, thrice daily. They may then share a bed and meals with the afflicted, fearing no harm, and shall remain unscathed, their minds at peace. Call the ghost’s name thrice, and it shall perish of its own accord.\"*\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"I wear the Vermilion Bird upon my crown, tread the Dark Warrior beneath my feet. To my left, the Azure Dragon; to my right, the White Tiger. Before me, a cauldron of boiling oil; behind me, the Tiger’s Might and Heavenly Wrath. The celestial soldiers stand guard at my front and rear. Ghost of Huangnu, flee ten thousand leagues from me—or the Emperor shall sever your form. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command!\"*\n\nAnother incantation reads:\n*\"Hark! Pestilence ghosts of the Five Directions—I know your names and the seasons you spread your blight. My head bears the heavens, my feet tread the earth; my tiger’s roar shakes the mountains, my divine sword cleaves the Yangtze’s flow. Above, I cast the Heavenly Net; below, the Earthly Snare. I command a general named Zali, who feasts on yakshas and devours specters. Let the pestilence ghosts hear his name and flee a thousand leagues! Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Lord Emperor’s statutes!\"*\n\n**Lord Lao’s Great Pestilence-Expelling Talisman**\nInscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, then burned in a large censer. It may also be worn on the person. This great talisman records the sacred method by which the Perfected Master subdued ghosts and vanquished demons in Shu.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Celestial Talisman of the Most High, the Supreme Clarity, Lord Lao—commander of the Five Divisions of Ghost Kings. Liu Yuanda, Zhang Yuanbo, Zhao Gongming, Zhong Shiji, Shi Wenye, and the five *gu* spirits wielding a hundred toxins—along with Huangnu, Bojie, Zasu, and the ghosts of the Six Ding—slay the living and spread harm. They shall be cut down at the waist without mercy for past sins. Swiftly, as the mandate commands, let wind and fire obey!\"*\n\n**Swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command!**\n\n**The Most High’s Talismans for Slaying Evil, Severing Pestilence, and Dispelling Epidemics**\nHold the three talismans in the Dipper Mudra and inscribe them with *qi* along the *gang* (celestial stem). Hang them in the central hall and at the doors of rooms to forever sever the afflictions of malevolent ghosts and pestilential epidemics.\n\n**Two Additional Talismans**\n**The Most High’s Merciful Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering, Ensuring Shared Rest Without Contagion**\nInscribe the talisman with the *qi* of the Three Lights, then swallow it with well water. Wear it by day, bind it in your topknot by night, and ingest the Three Lights Talisman according to the prescribed method.\n\n**The Most High’s Talisman for Halting Contagion and Slaying Pestilence Ghosts**\nInscribe it with *qi* using the Dipper Mudra and the revolving *gang*, then swallow it with well-flower water to forever prevent contagious illness. If one ingests it at the year’s dawn, they shall remain free from all afflictions. This is the decree of the Most High’s Northern Emperor, the Pestilence-Quelling King—revere it.\n\nRecite the *Tianpeng* incantation thirty-six times in practice.\n\nThe Master said: To subdue pestilential demons, first focus the eyes, visualize the five viscera each inhabited by its respective spirit, and knock the teeth together thirty-six times, followed by a single clack of the jaws. For those possessed by ghosts, if this method is applied thrice, their eyes will fester and they will die. Should a mortal practice this diligently, they shall attain the Dao of immortality. This incantation is the *Tianpeng* incantation; if recited carelessly, one will surely fall into evil destinies. Thus, superior practitioners ought to practice it diligently. The incantation contains the secrets of slaying ghosts—its words must not be spoken lightly. Upon reciting it ten thousand times, its merit shall be immeasurable.\n\n**Fire-Bell and Flowing-Metal Incantation for Slaying Pestilence**\n*\"Divine spirit of the Most High, essence of the Flame Emperor.\nLightning flashes in radiant glory, illuminating the Three Clarities.\nFire flows for ten thousand *li*—ghosts cannot escape their forms.\nWith one descent of the sacred talisman, demonic spirits are reduced to ashes.\nGenerals of the Three and Five, officers and soldiers of the *Huoluo*.\nThey level heaven and strike earth, ceaselessly slaying ghosts.\nFlying talismans and moving seals, their heads bear the Seven Stars.\nHurl fire to slay in advance, the demonic essences of the Six Heavens.\nPestilential ghosts and thieves are delivered to the divine *Ding*.\nThe Five Numinous True Elders are my original masters.\nUnobstructed divine power—all spirits return in unity.\nThe Five Pestilences and Seven Afflictions—I can slay them all.\nWhat ghost dares defy?

Use the Northern Emperor’s Mudra, transform and ride the *gang*, point to the direction, and spray water—it shall be efficacious.\n\n**The Unsurpassed Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Thirteen** *(conclusion)*\n\n**The Unsurpassed Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n*Title:* The Unsurpassed Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n*Source text:* Zhengtong Daoist Canon, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Unsurpassed Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Fourteen**\n**Chapter Sixteen: Wisdom-Light Illuminating the Obscure**\n\nThe Master said: When celestial perfection prevails, *yin* wanes and *yang* waxes—this is the way of immortals. For ordinary people, *yin* waxes and *yang* wanes—this is the way of ghosts. Thus, the scriptures say: ghosts lurk in obscurity, belonging to the *yin* kind. The multitude of the netherworld, the spirits of the departed, endure sorrow and bitterness, having lost their original luminosity and entered the nameless darkness. Therefore, the Most High established these rites, employing lamplight to convey *yang* *qi* and entrusting true *qi* to sacred talismans. Relying on the radiance of the Dharma torch, it disperses the blind redemption of the nether paths. In the eternal night of the Yellow Springs, all shall behold the light of *yang*. This is the Most High’s profound grace, a merciful absolution for the lower ghosts—how could one not revere it?\n\nThe Master said: In the primordial chaos before the beginning, heaven and earth were unformed, the sun and moon unborn—thus, the boundless expanse was devoid of light. When the One *qi* divided into Two, and the Two *qi* divided into Three, heaven and earth took their places, the sun and moon came into being, and light penetrated the obscure, giving rise to the myriad transformations. Therefore, at the inception of a ritual for delivering beings, one emulates the luminosity of heaven, earth, sun, and moon—using lamps to dispel darkness and *yang* to scatter *yin*. First, visualize the *qi* of one’s cinnabar field and sea of primordial *qi* glowing like a millet grain. Next, visualize the *qi* entering the heart, then ascending to the *Niwan* (mud-palace). Distribute the light of the sun, moon, and stars to universally illuminate the ten directions. Above heaven and below heaven, no obscurity remains—all is bathed in light. The spirits of the departed ride this luminosity, leaving the darkness behind.\n\n**The Dharma Master’s Method for Dividing Lamps and Transforming the Three Luminaries Diagram**\n**Moon Wheel Manifesting Auspicious Jade Talisman**\nUse the Moon Sovereign’s Mudra, gather *qi*, and entrust it to the talisman. When dividing the lamps, ignite paper as a bright candle and visualize the process according to the method.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"True water settles in mysterious clarity, the primordial *qi* just beginning to arise.\nThe white soul shines upon the diagram’s scene—Lady Nuanxiao is her name.\nFlowing light pervades the obscure alleys; the Jade Hare bears the Silver Toad.\nRadiant splendor of the two poles, interreflecting the distant Jade Towers.\nGathering *qi* to part the eternal gloom, divine light dances in *yang*’s flourish.\"*\n\n**Sun Luminance Illuminating the Golden Talisman**\nUse the Sun Sovereign’s Mudra, gather *qi*, and entrust it to the talisman. When dividing the lamps, ignite paper as a bright candle and visualize the process according to the method.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Golden Crow scatters crimson light, *yang* *qi* permeates the ten directions.\nGreat brilliance blazes in the central heaven; the Three Realms pay homage to the Primordial Emperor.\nThe Five Thearchs guide the *yang* essence; the vermilion radiance soars in the Flowery Chamber.\nAll *yin* has already dissipated; the true scene refines the primordial net.\nIlluminating the Eternal Spring realm, it naturally connects to the Emperor’s land.\"*\n\n**Star-Splendor Radiating the Luminous Treasure Talisman**\nUse the Dipper Mudra.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Starlight is heaven’s embryo, weaving *qi* to unfold divine radiance.\nThe Dipper’s bowl turns the central heaven; the pivot mechanism revolves the Primordial Emperor.\nBelow, it shines upon the ten-directional realms—even the obscure night is filled with light.\nThe souls of the departed leave the dark night, riding the light to refine true *yang*.\"*\n\n**Jade Capital’s Universal Light Dispelling Darkness Treasure Talisman**\n\n**Incantation:**\n\n*\"The Primordial One *qi* gives rise to the Three Clarities.\nThe Three *qi* set the turning in motion; the Three Lights unfold brilliance.\nThe sunlight shines downward, scattering *yin* across the Three Realms.\nThe moonlight glows radiant, bringing spring to the long night.\nThe Dipper’s light descends, illuminating heaven and earth.\nAbove, it reaches the Summit of Existence—all heavens bow to its splendor.\nBelow, it shines through the Nine Ramparts, its light piercing the Yellow Springs.\nAt its center, it illumines the Earth Prison, dissolving karmic paths into clarity.\nBeneath the Nine Heavens, every place is filled with light.\n*Yin* is broken by *yang*; darkness is broken by light.\nHeaven’s light descends—earth’s darkness vanishes.\nHeaven’s light is born—earth’s *yin* perishes.\nMerciful radiance shines forth, delivering boundless salvation.\"*\n\n**The Nine Dark Hells’ Lamps**\nThe Master says: *\"Draw upon the *qi* of the upper heavens to subdue the souls of the Nine Heavens. Thus, we borrow the talisman and infuse it with *qi*, riding the light downward into the Earth Prison—whereupon the imprisoned souls depart.\"*\n\nNow, *yang* is an odd number: from one to three, from three to five, from five through seven, reaching nine—all are *yang* numbers.\nFirst, arrange nine lamps in order before the Master. Invoke the *Nine Heavens’ True Yang Jade Light Dispelling Darkness Talisman* to the lamp’s location, then burn the talisman and proclaim the ritual.\nNext, beginning in the east, light one lamp and recite the incantation, guiding its light to illuminate the Wind-Thunder Hell.\nBefore each hell’s lamp, inscribe the celestial realm of its corresponding direction—for the east, write *Infinite Heaven*—then cover it with the hell’s enclosure.\nWhen closing the lamp, remove the enclosure and burn it with the talisman, whereupon the hell transforms into a celestial realm.\nProceed with the south in the same manner.\nWhen all nine hells are completed, they are wholly transmuted into heaven.\n\n**Nine Heavens’ True Yang Jade Light Dispelling Darkness Golden Talisman**\nThe Master says: *\"This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, traced with sunlight and moonlight. Burn it before lighting the lamps to invoke the wisdom-light, then break open the hells.\"*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"The Three Lights’ true wisdom, their radiance merging in splendor.\nThe ten directions respond to their transformation, universally descending in majesty.\nFire-toxins dissolve the haze; the frigid pools grow bright.\nThe dark gates shine clear; the gloomy prisons gleam.\nGreat compassion descends; the exalted saints show mercy.\nImprisoned souls ascend, soaring to the celestial courts.\nSwift as a command!\"*\n\n**Diagram of the Nine Hells’ Lamps**\n\n**Talisman for the Merciful Sovereign Opening the Dark Prisons**\nUse the *Jade Clarity Mudra*.\nFirst, visualize the Merciful Sovereign of Grand Unity within the sun, emanating light. Then, bow in reverence, recite the *Sutra of Salvation* once, and draw the sun’s Merciful Sovereign into your mouth to empower the brush as you write nine talismans.\nWhen breaking open the hells, cast one talisman into each direction, then proclaim the talisman’s decree.\nThe decree is a layered talisman found in the *Chapter on Salvation by Sound*.\nOutside the circular image, within the halo of light, Grand Unity sits upon a lion, sprinkling water.\nFor each use, prepare a talisman on light yellow paper, eight inches long and five inches wide. Grind cinnabar facing the sun and inscribe it as before.\nCast one talisman per hell.\nWhen casting, visualize yourself as the Merciful Sovereign, facing the dark prison. Guide the talisman’s light to shatter it, forgetting your own form—seeing only that you are the Heavenly Worthy.\nThus, with focused intent, the nine hells will resonate, and the ritual proclamations will be announced.\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Wind-Thunder Hell of the East**\nWhen breaking the hell, use the *Jade Clarity Mudra*, face east, and part the hair with the *Gui Mao* mudra. Visualize the blue *qi* within your body, riding the talisman’s light as you transform into the Heavenly Worthy, entering the dark prison to save the suffering souls. The other directions follow this pattern.\n\n*\"Blue *yang* generates *qi*, its light illuminating the Mystic Terrace.\nThe Primordial Worthy’s great compassion descends upon the Wind-Thunder Hell.\nFlying spears scatter; tortures and interrogations cease.\nThe Most High swiftly pardons—souls ascend to Jade Clarity.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Fire-Haze Hell of the South**\nFace south with the *Gui Wu* mudra.\n\n*\"Three *qi* of cinnabar blossoms illuminate the south.\nThe Fire-Haze Hell naturally cools.\nFlying sweet dew and dharma rain flow with fragrance.\nSpirit-souls are at ease, ascending to the land of blessings.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Vajra Hell of the West**\nFace west with the *Gui You* mudra.\n\n*\"The Heavenly Worthy commands pardon, shining down upon the Vajra Hell.\nGhost-officials obey the decree; souls ride the light.\nDark prisons end their trials; tortures cease their bitterness.\nDeparting the hells, they stride toward the immortal realms.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Dark-Cold Hell of the North**\nFace north with the *Gui Zi* mudra.\n\n*\"*Yang* radiance shines downward; the hells return to spring.\nThe Dark-Cold’s frigid night is wholly dispelled by light.\nBitterness scatters; punishments and crimes dissolve.\nRiding this talisman’s light, they escape the dark gates.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Cauldron-Boiling Hell of the Northeast**\nFace northeast with the *Gui Yin* mudra.\n\n*\"True light of jade brilliance opens the night’s cold glow.\nCauldron flames subside; scorching torments turn to ice.\nWisdom’s moisture soaks; divine winds extinguish the blaze.\nSpirit-souls are at ease, riding the light in flight.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Bronze-Pillar Hell of the Southeast**\nFace southeast with the *Gui Si* mudra.\n\n*\"The true light of jade commands; ghost-officials receive grace.\nBronze pillars collapse; the crooked pardon sinful souls.\nBlack records vanish; golden light delivers souls.\nJade radiance ascends—beholding the Merciful Sovereign.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Slaughter Hell of the Southwest**\nFace southwest with the *Gui Shen* mudra.\n\n*\"The golden talisman descends with the celestial decree; the Most High proclaims mercy.\nThe Slaughter Hell’s knives and swords dissolve to dust.\nBroken souls restore their nature; sins and karma are erased.\nRiding the light from darkness, they escape the kalpic age.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Fire-Chariot Hell of the Northwest**\nFace northwest with the *Gui Hai* mudra.\n\n*\"A hundred treasures’ auspicious splendor, within which dwells the Primordial Worthy.\nPouring sweet dew, washing away the flames’ affliction.\nFire-chariots halt their tracks; swords and halberds shatter their suffering.\nGhost-officials obey the pardon, drawing out the ghost-souls.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Universal Torment Hell of the Center**\nFace the center, burn the talisman, then use the *Jade Clarity Mudra* to conclude.\n\n*\"Mystic radiance arises naturally, pardoning the depths of the Yellow Springs.\nGrace extends universally; sins and sufferings are absolved.\nGhost-officials depart; soul-spirits ascend as immortals.\"*\n\nVisualize the three-colored cloud-*qi* atop your crown, with Grand Unity the Merciful Sovereign seated above, radiating a hundred treasures’ light to shine upon the Yellow Springs’ curves. In each hell, the Merciful Sovereign appears, emanating light to dispel darkness. Sinful souls ride the light upward, whereupon you prod them with your staff.\n\n*Thus concludes the Fourteenth Scroll of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.*\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Seventeen: Seeking Sound to Deliver from Suffering**\n\nThe Master said: The Yellow Register delivers the living; the Azure Mystery rescues the suffering. Wisdom’s light dispels darkness; talismanic commands reach the hidden realms. They retrieve sunken, stagnant souls, raising them to swift joy. Such merit is truly not insignificant. Yet those who practice it—how could they regard it as easy to behold?\n\nThe altar must be solemnly arrayed, bells and chimes resonant. Though outwardly adorned with majestic ritual forms, inwardly it relies solely upon virtue and conduct. If one takes seals as life-essence, or now employs written summons for control, yet does not inwardly cultivate the self, not only will it be of no benefit—it may even lead astray.\n\nThe transmission of talismans for the hidden and nether realms has long prioritized deliverance from suffering and longevity. Thus, the talismans for deliverance from suffering are placed first.\n\n**Explanation of the Original Deliverance-from-Suffering Talisman and the Longevity Talisman**\n\nThe Master said: This level talisman is fully recorded in the *Scripture of the Nine Nether Realms*, all conforming to the true. Later incorporated into the *Lingbao* methods, distinctions were forcibly imposed, establishing various grades, scattered forms, and hierarchies of nobility, each with its own gradations.\n\nWhen heaven and earth divided, humanity was placed between them. Having attained human form, one encounters the gates of life and death, and the distinctions of noble and base—such is the natural order of the world. Yet how could heaven treat the people below with disparate degrees? There is only the One.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Mysterious Numinous* states: Though ranks differ in honor, the allotment of life is without distinction. If there is no distinction, how could talismanic forms differ? Yet their terminology varies, sowing confusion.\n\nThe Master continued: Within the treasure-pearl, the primordial script was simple, but later ages made it elaborate. Now, I establish the Deliverance-from-Suffering as a single category, placing these two talismans at the forefront. Future inheritors of the teaching should follow and practice this, comprehending its truth.\n\n**First: True Deliverance-from-Suffering Talisman**\n**Second: Transforming-Reed Dragon Talisman**\nUse yellow paper, two feet and four inches in length, inscribed in cinnabar. Suspend it in the mouth of the reed dragon. Recite the *Jade Clarity* and *Azure Mystery qi* incantations nine times, then write the talisman.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Dao is attuned to the heart; delusion relies on illusion to take form.\nSever delusion with illusion; transform the false into the true.\nBind reeds into a dragon, its brows and eyes distinct.\nBear my talismanic command, descend into the cold courts.\nFrom this day forth, incinerate and transform, flying ceaselessly.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Additional Incantation:**\nCompassionate light delivers from suffering; the Most High is merciful.\nHuman life is benighted; sins and sufferings lead astray.\nFive sufferings, five burdens—karmic retribution is never lacking.\nToday is a great celebration; celestial light descends.\nDeliver from the realms of suffering; karmic debts dissolve.\nAscend my altar, undergo refinement, and be reborn.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Longevity Numinous Talisman**\n\n**Golden Dragon Transformation Talisman**\nUse yellow paper two feet and four inches in length, inscribed in cinnabar. Place it into the dragon’s mouth as before. Perform the Yuqing mudra, invoke the Dongyang qi, and recite the incantation nine times before inscribing the talisman.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Dao is known through the heart; delusion takes form through illusion.\nSever delusion with illusion; transform the false into the true.\nShape the image into a dragon, transmuting into a golden dragon’s form.\nAll transformations arise from fire; all changes depend on the heart.\nTransformation lies within me, refining and smelting the hidden yin.\nThe cinnabar heavens’ true fire burns away the Feng courts to ashes.\nRefined by fire, it ascends naturally to the Vermilion Mound.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Additional Incantation:**\nCrimson qi flows as fire, blazing upon the Vermilion Mound.\nThe three qi of the cinnabar heavens smelt and refine the Golden Court.\nAttain longevity and deathlessness, return the bones to their original truth.\nWithin it dwells the Immortal Elder, clad in crimson robes and fiery skirts.\nHan Jun enacts transformation; Sima gives birth to spirits.\nForging the po, molding the hun, refining yin with yang.\nThe corpse and po disperse, transforming into the true form.\nMerge with the Three Clarities, unite with the Pure, and ascend.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Supreme Spontaneous Compassionate Sin-Reducing Talisman**\nPerform the Yuqing mudra, bow twice toward the northeast, and draw the talisman while invoking the Great Crimson Qi. Before submitting any talismans, first present this talisman to reduce sins, then submit the Prison-Transferring Talisman.\n\n**Supreme and Spontaneous, compassionate in reducing sins.**\nThe jade talisman is proclaimed below to the Northern Yin of the Earth Prison, the Wuji World.\nTo Dengdu, the Great Emperor, and the Six Heavenly Ghost Kings:\nWherever this talismanic command arrives, the dark night is illuminated.\nObey the Dao’s decree, and notify the Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Offices, Thirty-Six Prisons, Nine Dark Hells, Twenty-Four Prisons, the Great and Small Iron Enclosure Hells, the Avīci Hell, the officials of the Underworld, and the spirits of the Earth Prison.\nBy the grace of this talismanic command, through the compassion of the Most High, reduce and erase the sins and transgressions of the departed soul of so-and-so in life, and the grievances after death.\nBy this talismanic command, diminish and cut away sins and offenses, release from Feng punishment, and reconcile transgressions.\nBy the merit of this sin-reducing talismanic command, do not delay.\nAll as proclaimed.\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the Tai Sui.\n\n**Incantation:**\nPrimordial compassionate light coalesces into Brahma qi.\nShining upon the hidden darkness, it reduces and removes sins and offenses.\nProclaimed from the golden mouth, no record remains in the Black Register.\nThe divine treasure’s merciful light is revered by a thousand spirits.\nSwiftly obey and execute; ghostly officials must not delay.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Statutes and Ordinances for Deliverance.\n\n**Qingxuan Emperor’s Qi-Absorbing and Scripture-Holding Mudra**\nThe adept enters the chamber, arranges their robes, and sits upright. Light incense toward the stove, free the mind of all distractions, and abide in undisturbed singularity.\nVisualize the qi from one’s own liver emerging as blue-green mist.\nThe blue-green clouds pass through the ears and nose, gradually increasing until they fill the entire chamber, extending outward so that blue-green clouds are seen everywhere.\nWithin the blue-green clouds, behold the Qingxuan Emperor seated upon a lion throne, holding a willow branch and a lapis lazuli vessel.\nTo his left and right stand two perfected beings and eighty-one spirit officials in attendance.\nSee only the August One within golden light, piercing the blue-green clouds and pervading the ten directions.\nThe adept petitions for the wisdom-light sweet dew.\nAfter a long while, the August One bestows the sweet dew upon the perfected beings to drink, and the adept’s five viscera feel cool and refreshed.\nFrom the crown of the August One’s head, golden light descends upon the adept’s fontanel, illuminating their body. The adept senses their entire being suffused with golden light, entering the mouth like honey.\nNext, silently recite the *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* once, then gather the golden light and clouds, allowing them to enter through the subtle gate.\nSwallow the saliva nine times, bow nine times, and retreat.\nPerform this nine times, and what is practiced will be efficacious, what is delivered will be saved, and extraordinary proofs will manifest.\nKeep this secret.\n\nThe *Nine Yang Perfected Salvation-from-Suffering Jade Talisman*\nJade Clarity Incantation: From the hours of *hai* and *zi* to *yin*, inscribe the talisman with great crimson *qi*.\n\nOnce this talisman is proclaimed, then proclaim the *Cessation-of-Suffering Talisman*.\nWhen the *Nine Yang Perfected Salvation-from-Suffering Jade Talisman* is proclaimed, its radiance shines upon the Northern Yin’s Boundless Realm, the Fengdu August Emperor, the Six Heavenly Demon Kings, the Thirty-Six Hells, the Twenty-Four Hells, the great and small Iron Enclosures, and the hells of Intermittent and Uninterrupted Torment. Where the talisman’s light reaches, the dark prisons gleam.\nBy the grace of the Most High’s decree, swiftly pardon without delay. Remove and deliver the deceased, so-and-so, their form and soul, along with all the suffering shades of the netherworld. Upon beholding this light, may they ascend by this deliverance.\nThe merit of the talisman’s pardon must not be obstructed.\nAs proclaimed, so let it be.\n\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year, at a propitious hour.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Nine Clarities’ talismanic command descends to illumine the deepest yin.\nDark dungeons and black prisons all behold the light.\nOx-Head shows compassion, ghostly fires grow clear and cool.\nRemove and deliver the sinful shades—they must not linger long.\nGhostly emperors obey the command, demon kings reverently comply.\nAs proclaimed, so let it be.\n\n*The Purple Tenuity Upper Palace Deliverance Talisman for Cessation of Suffering in the Lower Realm*\nWhen the *Purple Tenuity Upper Palace Deliverance Talisman for Cessation of Suffering in the Lower Realm* is proclaimed, its radiance shines upon the Northern Yin’s Boundless Realm, the Fengdu August Emperor, and the Six Heavenly Demon Kings. Where the talisman’s light reaches, the darkest nights brighten. All receive the talismanic command, which is universally proclaimed to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Thirty-Six Hells, the Nine Nether Hells, the Twenty-Four Hells, the great and small Iron Enclosures, and the hells of Intermittent and Uninterrupted Torment, along with their wardens and officials. Each shall act in accordance with the talismanic command: cease suffering, halt punishments, and deliver the soul of the deceased, so-and-so, along with all the suffering shades of the netherworld. May the winds and thunder grow still, the karma-fires clear. May the icy waters warm, and all punishments be universally lifted.\nSever with compassion, and let swords transform into forests of *jian* trees.\n\nThe bronze pillars shatter and collapse, the vajra walls crumble and topple. Cauldrons of boiling liquid become tranquil pools, and the wheels of searing flames cease their turning. No suffering is endured, and evil roots are extinguished. By the merit of this Purple Tenuity talismanic command, none may delay or detain. Let it be proclaimed as decreed, transmitted swiftly as wind and fire.\n\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year, at a propitious hour.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Jade Steps petition mercy,\nthe precious talisman penetrates the hidden.\nPardons descend to the nether courts,\nrescuing the suffering and halting imprisonment.\nShackles and restraints fall away,\ntortures and trials bring no sorrow.\nBy the authority of the talismanic pardon,\ndepart from the dark and hidden.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree for the salvation of the living!*\n\nJade Clarity mudra, Heavenly Gate *qi*, written in vermilion.\n\n**The Master says:** These are the Three Talismans—of Sin-Reduction, Prison-Transfer, and Suffering-Cessation—granted by the Most High’s merciful pardon. In all ritual fasts and supplications, these three talismans must first be proclaimed before the Talisman of Salvation from Suffering.\n\n**The Method of Salvation from Suffering in the Nine Nether Hells**\n**The Master says:** Heaven’s halls are all within me; hell is not apart from the mind. If one lives in the world, and all actions accord with principle, then at death, how could there be karmic debt? Without karmic debt, there is no sin. Without sin, how can there be hell?\n\nYet when the minds of worldly people grow deluded, the Six Dusts defile all. They slander the sages and transcendents, betray their lords and fathers, kill living beings, steal, owe lives, and squander wealth. A lifetime of deceit, treachery, and unbridled vice—after death, their souls are bound for hell. It is like a foolish person, wearied in mind and spirit: by day, their spirit wanders; by night, their soul takes flight. As they act, so do evil visions manifest. Only upon waking do they realize it was but a dream. Hell is no different from such delusion.\n\nAll the causes sown in life, and the sufferings endured after death—hell arises from sin, and sin originates in the mind. If the mind’s dharmas are empty, how can sin exist? Yet hell, though unreal, is hard to refute in form; the mind’s dharmas, though formless, are hard to grasp in appearance. To stabilize the mind, first sever delusion. Once delusion is cut, sin vanishes without form, and hell is shattered.\n\nFor heaven is yang and thus bright; earth is yin and thus dark. Darkness brings suffering, suffering brings confinement—this is hell. To shatter hell, first mobilize the light of heaven. Borrow the talisman to convey *qi*, and borrow *qi* to spread light. With brightness shatter darkness, with yang overcome yin, with truth dispel delusion—this is called shattering hell.\n\nYet the superior adept awakens without doubt, while the inferior adept cannot yet comprehend. The Dao’s mystery is unfathomable; the mind’s dharmas are inexhaustible.\n\nThe profound and wondrous principles need not be expounded at length.\n\n**Method for Shattering Hell**\nThe Master said: The method for shattering hell involves striking the prison gates with a ritual staff. The use of such a staff pertains to the Three Caverns Masters. There are those who wield swords to shatter hell—these are the Orthodox Unity Masters. In recent times, some have taken up axes to break open hell, citing the unorthodox claim of \"using iron axes to cleave all hells.\" Later generations, unaware of the origins and traditions, mistakenly attribute the ritual staff to the Numinous Treasure Masters, while the Heavenly Master’s lineage is said to employ axes. These are all vulgar interpretations, failing to grasp the true essence and confounding the correct Dao. In our tradition, only those who have received the Central Alliance Great Cavern Register may use the ritual staff; others hold the Alliance威 Register. Swords and wooden axes are most disruptive to the Dao. When ascending the altar, such acts differ little from theatrical performance. They profane the sacred and true, and their transgression is grave. Thus, the practice of wielding axes is expressly abolished.\n\n**True Talisman of the Three Qi and Nine Yang Jade Light to Shatter Hell**\nWith the Jade Clarity mudra, inscribe the *qi* of the Three Heavens, Nine Yang, and Three Lights. The True Talisman of the Void-Origin Three *Qi* and Nine Yang Jade Light to Shatter Hell is proclaimed below to the Underworld’s Curved Springs and the Northern Capital of Luo Deng:\n\n\"May the yang light penetrate and illuminate, opening the iron prisons. May the gloom of the netherworld disperse, the blades and halberds shatter. May the flames of the fire pools subside, the karmic realms know no wind. May the night gates and dark palaces all transform into heaven. May the departed souls emerge, bowing before the golden countenance. As this decree is issued, let it be swiftly conveyed by wind and fire.\"\n\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year.\n\n**Method for Inscribing Talismans**\nBy the decree of the Three Great Emperors of Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Grand Clarity, absolve and deliver the ten directions. May the Numinous Treasure Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, the Vermilion Numinosity Emperor, the Vermilion Numinosity Lord, the Southern Culmen Longevity Great Emperor, and the Nine Heavens Life-Monitoring Great Spirits deliver the soul of the departed, so-and-so.\n\nUpon reaching the character \"decree,\" visualize the golden light of the Three Treasures of the Three Heavens.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"The Jade Emperor decrees, receiving the mandate of Jade Clarity. Absolve the sins of the ten directions; let fragrant incense fill the court.\n*Oṃ hūṃ halu svāhā*, swiftly as the decree commands.\"\n\n**Concealed Transmission of the Duplicate Talisman**\nInscribe one talisman for each hell, performing the rites in advance, then use the duplicate talisman as verification. On yang days, add one stroke.\n\nWhen summoning souls from the underworld, this talisman may also be reprinted on the directional envelope, and the earthly officials will promptly comply. When shattering hell, this talisman may be inscribed on yellow paper and placed in each direction as a token of its use. This is the talisman of the Six Jia yin-yang spirits, which may also be overlaid on the duplicate talisman.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Savior from Suffering Talisman and the Like**\nThe Master said: Before inscribing talismans, first purify the mind, restraining and sealing all worldly distractions. Face east in the cross-legged posture, visualizing the head as a circular light divided into blue, white, and yellow hues, with the Great One Compassionate Venerable seated upon a lion within the light. Then, within the radiance of a hundred treasures, emit a hundredfold brilliance, illuminating the ten directions. In each beam of light, behold the compassionate visage of the Great One Heavenly Worthy. Next, visualize the body as Mount Kunlun, drawing the compassionate light of the Great One to shine upon the Underworld’s Curved Springs, where every hell is bathed in light. Withdraw the *qi* of the Azure Mystery to infuse the brush and inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Method for Proclaiming the Savior from Suffering Talisman and the Like**\nThe Master said: When reciting the proclamation, visualize the body as the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy. Then, from the crown of the head, emanate the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy ascending through the wondrous gate. From the eastern realm, the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy arrives upon a lion throne, merging with the Heavenly Worthy emanated from the crown. Then, unite with the Heavenly Worthy transformed from the body. At this moment, the three bodies become one. Open the eyes, seated within white light, the self now the form of the Great One.\n\nDraw the nine *qi* of the east to irrigate the liver, transforming the hall into a dragon that wields the talisman to summon souls.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"Nine *qi* surge forth, irrigating my liver meridian. Ten thousand golden rays transform into nine dragons.\nPierce the dark and break the gloom, descending twice into the Northern Feng.\nMay sinful souls be free, roaming the vast heavens.\nSwiftly as the Dharma commands.\"\n\nNext, visualize the liver *qi* transforming into a dragon, emerging from the left ear, then dispatch the talismanic dragon.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Longevity Talisman**\nThe Master said: When inscribing the Longevity Talisman, proceed as with the Savior from Suffering Talisman—calm the mind, free from distractions. Then, visualize the head as the blazing sun, within which the Great Lord of Longevity wears a hibiscus crown, seated amidst crimson clouds, radiating great light. Next, visualize the body as Kunlun, the heart as the Fire Palace. Draw *qi* to infuse the brush and inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Method for Proclaiming the Longevity Talisman**\nThe Master said: When proclaiming the talisman, visualize the body as the jade form of the Great Lord of Longevity. Then, from the crown of the head, emanate the Emperor of Longevity ascending through the wondrous gate. From within the cinnabar fire light, the Emperor of Longevity rides a three-*qi* fire dragon, merging with the form emanated from the crown. Then, unite with the body. At this moment, the three bodies become one. Open the eyes, standing within fire light, the self now the Great Lord of Longevity.\n\nDraw the three *qi* of the southern heavens into the liver, transforming into a golden dragon that emerges from the left ear.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"*Qi* of the Cinnabar Heaven, radiant jade light.\nIrrigate my spirit palace; four golden dragons manifest.\nBearing the talisman and token, ascend to Southern Prosperity.\nRefine the yin haze, transform and circulate pure yang.\nSwiftly as the Dharma commands.\"\n\nNext, visualize the liver *qi* transforming into a golden dragon, emerging from the left ear. Then, with clear vision, dispatch the golden dragon.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Fifteen, Concludes**\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\nTitle: *The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Sixteen**\n**Chapter Eighteen: Salvation of the Netherworld**\n\nThe Master said: To deliver the netherworld is to awaken the illusory through the real.\nAll beings, while alive, stray from the true; in death, they lose it entirely. Once the One True [nature] is lost, delusive thoughts arise, manifesting as suffering and retribution. The sagely masters established teachings for no other purpose than to awaken the illusory through the real.\nWhen the human heart strays from its true origin and enters the dark realm, even a thousand sages find it difficult to intervene. Only by deploying the One True to shatter the One Delusion can benighted souls attain purity, clearly escape their suffering, and be freed from entanglements—this is the original intent of the Most High’s compassionate teachings.\nIf practitioners fail to grasp this principle, clinging instead to mere documents and summonses as their practice, or upholding ritual decorum as merit, chanting through the night and exhausting themselves by day, they will ultimately bring no benefit to the deceased.\nThus, this chapter on salvation is established, that one may devote oneself wholly to the netherworld and not be distracted by external affairs.\nWhen the mind’s realm becomes clear and luminous, and the nature of heaven shines brightly, beyond this truth there is no other teaching.\nTo liberate those sunk in darkness from the realms of suffering—such merit is immeasurable.\n\nThe Master said: The Six *Jia* refer to *Jiazi*, *Jiayin*, *Jiachen*, *Jiawu*, *Jiashen*, and *Jiaxu*. *Jia* is the generative *qi* of the East, the Great Benevolence of life.\nThus, the South refines with fire, the West hardens with metal, the North obstructs with water, and the four intermediate directions are not aligned with the true *qi*. Without the deities of the Six *Jia* arrayed in the eight directions, the ethereal and corporeal souls would not perceive life.\nThe true [essence] of life is difficult to reach the altar; therefore, in this great teaching, the Six *Jia* messengers are first dispatched to guide the way.\n\n**Six Jia Opening Talisman**\nThis talisman, when proclaimed, shall illuminate the nine springs’ dark paths and the gloom of ghostly realms.\nThe Three Lights dispel obscurity; the Six *Jia* penetrate the yin.\nGhostly souls receive amnesty and behold the light.\nSpirit officials shall not conceal; the Golden Horse Post transmits.\nAs this decree commands, the Wind-Fire Post conveys.\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the *Tai Sui*.\n\nThe Master said: The Six *Jia* Opening Talisman is the benevolent pledge that opens the dark paths. It must be proclaimed before summoning and gathering [the souls]. It is written in cinnabar on yellow paper, sealed at the corners, and dispatched.\n\nThe Master said: Alas! The people of the world, benighted and unaware, do not awaken in life.\nTheir hearts traverse perilous paths; in death, they enter the netherway. Naturally obstructed, without the Most High’s compassionate light, they cannot reach the altar. Only with this talisman will the dark paths brighten, the nether roads become smooth, and the departed souls know no peril.\n\n**True Talisman of the Vermilion Radiance and Three Lights Opening the Nether Path**\nThis talisman, when proclaimed, commands the mountain, water, and celestial boundary deities along the paths of Mount Tai to swiftly open the nether roads, illuminate the dark journey, and guide the departed soul of so-and-so to follow the talisman’s light and swiftly reach the altar.\nLet no obstruction or hindrance arise; may the soul’s consciousness be at peace.\nThose who violate this decree shall be punished without delay.\n\nAs the decree is proclaimed, let it be transmitted by wind and fire couriers. On an auspicious day and hour of the year, month, and day under the reign of the Great Year Star, the decree is issued.\n\nThe Master declares: This is the method of the *Talisman Command for Opening the Nether Path*. Write it in vermilion on blue paper, fold the corners, seal with an imprint, and place it upon the altar before summoning the soul. When the Master guides the departed soul, with this talisman, the dark paths shall be smoothly traversed without obstruction.\n\n**Method of Transformation**\nFor opening the nether path, first circulate one’s own Three Lights to merge with the Three Lights of Heaven, naturally illuminating the path so that the nether roads shine brightly, free from stagnation or hindrance. One will then perceive the soul’s consciousness abiding within this radiance, seeing no other hues.\n\nNext, visualize the Most High Compassionate Venerable One holding a willow branch of empty azure, sprinkling the nether realm with its dew. In silent contemplation, recite the incantation:\n*\"The Three Lights gleam bright,\nThe Nine Nether realms lie deep.\nNight’s haze disperses, dawn’s clarity arises,\nBeholding the Compassionate Venerable’s form,\nSweet dew flows cool.\nLet the soul’s consciousness return,\nSmoothly traverse the dark journey.\nHearing the sutras and the Dharma,\nRoam freely in the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, draw the talisman while guiding the *qi*.\n\n**Method of Ablution**\nThe Master declares: Worldly toil and defilement are why the minds of mortals remain uncleansed. Not only is the mind tainted—all six senses bear dust, the six dusts bear consciousness, and the six consciousnesses bear filth. Thus, in death, one sinks even deeper, as if mired in mud, unable to purify oneself.\n\nThis ablution does not merely wash away conscious defilement. For the dark soul, burdened by sin, ignorance, and delusion, is like a body caked in grime. Therefore, with the pure and compassionate Dharma-water, each drop sprinkled and each touch cleansed, the nape and heart become clear, the *po* soul is restored, sins dissolve, and filth vanishes—this is what is meant by ablution.\n\n**Talisman of the Immortal’s Corpse-Cleansing**\nIncantation:\n*\"The Flower Pool nourishes and bathes,\nForm and soul become one in purity.\nThe six dusts are without stain,\nKarmic grime is wholly clarified.\nThe Three Fields glow full,\nThe Nine Orifices open bright.\nWashed and irrigated, the root of life,\nThe dead soul returns to infancy.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Jade Talisman of the Numinous Source’s Irrigation**\nIncantation:\n*\"Fragrant clouds congeal as dew,\nDripping and sprinkling, cool and pure.\nThe celestial source’s dark waves\nMoisten and irrigate the nether realms.\nCorpse-filth is stilled,\nKarmic dust instantly clears.\nRefine all delusions,\nScour away ignorance.\nThe Three Hun return to truth,\nWithered and decayed regain form.\nEntering and exiting the void,\nComing and going in profound darkness.\nNo stain of sin or filth,\nTen thousand kalpas’ dust cleansed.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Scouring Worldly Toil**\nIncantation:\n*\"Heaven’s filth becomes clouds,\nThe Three Lights sweep them clean.\nHuman filth of the six dusts,\nDharma-words scour the passions.\nEarth’s filth of corpse-impurity,\nDharma-water clarifies all.\nHuman filth does not arise,\nCorpse-filth is pacified.\nEarth’s filth is dispelled,\nAll immortals unite as one.\nThe Three Qi intermingle,\nMerging with the Dao in truth.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Method of the Celestial Physician’s Whole-Form Restoration**\nThe Master declares: The ghostly consciousness lacks form, scattered and ungathered, like *qi* dwelling in the wind, without fixed shape. Yet its deluded thoughts persist, and the pains of illness or injury suffered in life continue to afflict it in death. Without the method of whole-form restoration, the soul’s form remains fragmented, unable to coalesce. Thus, those who die of illness have their souls worn away and cannot be made whole. Those who die from harm have their souls damaged and cannot be restored. Those who die by the blade have their souls dispersed and cannot be reunited. Therefore, the Most High, in compassion, established the *Method of the Celestial Physician’s Whole-Form Restoration*.\n\n**Talisman of the Three Sections and Eight Sceneries Communicating with the True**\n**True Talisman of the Celestial Physician’s Original Qi for Healing**\nIncantation:\n*\"Heaven’s *qi* clarifies,\nEarth’s sceneries open bright.\nThe Nine Treasures arrayed,\nThe Three Passes flourish.\nThe yin corpse returns to substance,\nTrue *qi* remains ever pure.\nDense yin reverts to yang,\nSoftness returns to hardness.\nShatter the Six Caverns,\nDispel the yin’s stagnation.\nThe true scene guards within,\nThe *po* corpse regains form.\nThe Nine Elders’ ancestral *qi*,\nTransmutes to immortal and becomes human.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Method of the Life-Monitoring Purification**\n\nThe Master said: The karmic debts of the Blood Lake arise fundamentally from women. When desires burn fiercely and karmic bonds run deep, they congeal into retributive encounters. Yet if the foul and bloody impurities remain unsettled, the departed soul does not forget its attachments from the former life, and so its spectral spirit continues to suffer pain. Whether mother and child remain unsevered or the blood corpse is not yet purified, without the power of the method, how can they ascend and transcend? Therefore, this method is specially prepared to rescue those who perish in childbirth.\n\n**Talisman for Dispelling the Impurities of the Blood Lake**\nIncantation:\n*\"Great Brahma of the Nine Heavens,\nFlying Mystery of the Three Caverns.\nUnbind your fetal knots,\nOpen and clear the womb’s origin.\nAll karmic ties are severed,\nThe roots of death and grievances dissolved.\nThe Blood Lake is purified,\nThe prison wardens hold no dominion.\nThe Primordial Lady regains form,\nThe Celestial Overseer and Life-Monitor attend.\nThe Eight Sceneries are complete,\nThe ten-month gestation is fulfilled.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High’s law!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Restoring Form and Severing the Fetal Bond**\nIncantation:\n*\"Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital,\nJade Light coalesces into truth.\nFetal knots unravel of themselves,\nThe dead soul returns as an infant.\nGreat Spirit of the Life-Monitor,\nDivine Lord of Parted Birth.\nDescend with the talisman’s *qi*,\nSever the roots of death.\nDissolve the stains of sin,\nSeparate mother and child in form.\nWash away the foul and bloody,\nCome to behold the Jade Court.\nReceive the talisman and undergo refinement,\nTranscend to the Vermilion Mound.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Talisman of the Transmigration Banner**\nUsing the solar mudra, draw in the sun’s *qi*, and inscribe it according to the method. When raising the banner, circulate one’s own solar essence upon it, recite the Solar Lord’s incantation, and lift it aloft, visualizing the radiant sun blazing in the heavens, its light penetrating the depths of the Yellow Springs.\n\n**Talisman of the Returning Yellow Banner**\nUsing the lunar mudra, draw in the moon’s *qi*, and inscribe it according to the method. When raising the banner, circulate one’s own lunar essence upon the banner, invoke the Lunar Lord’s incantation, and lift it aloft, visualizing the moon’s light filling the heavens, illuminating the darkest nights.\n\nThe Master said: The Transmigration Banner is made of crimson silk to symbolize the sun. The Returning Yellow Banner for Liberation is made of yellow silk to symbolize the moon. Each is twelve feet in length.\n\n**Talisman for Universal Offerings to the Three Luminaries of the Celestial Kitchen**\nIncantation:\n\nWithin the Three Realms and Six Paths,\nAll beings are ever hungry with delusive thoughts.\nThe Three Luminaries gather numinous essence,\nAnd the dharma-food bestows sweetness and richness.\nAbove, it reaches the myriad gods of heaven;\nBelow, it extends to the Iron Hell of Mud.\nA single offering nourishes all,\nJoyfully attaining the subtle and serene.\n\n*Concluding* **Scroll Sixteen of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites**\n*Beginning* **Scroll Seventeen of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites**\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Divine Tiger’s Pursuit and Summoning**\n\nThe Master said: The Dipper governs the souls and spirits of the world, hence its profound and hidden mysteries serve as the foundation for pursuit and summoning. Yet scholars, though familiar with its forms and frequent in its practice, seldom witness its efficacy—often reducing it to mere paperwork. Therefore, in this flourishing age of the Great Teaching, a dedicated chapter on pursuit and summoning is established, ensuring that responses to talismanic invocation are swift as echoes and shadows—not merely for ornamental display.\n\nThe talismanic script of the Divine Tiger’s Jade Tablet is widely known and thus not reproduced here. Instead, this text records the secret methods, for their subtlety transcends worldly understanding.\n\nThe Master said: Should one ask what the Divine Tiger’s rite entails?\nThe Master answered: The sages employ the Divine Tiger for summoning because the *yin* direction is the Ghost Gate, and its guardian is the tiger. The act of summoning from this direction is thus profoundly meaningful. Today’s lineage masters appoint altar officials to oversee the Tiger Bureau—this is the principle.\n\nThe Master said: In the art of summoning, without knowledge of the inner secrets of the Dark Mystery, the netherworld remains obscured, the Three Realms indistinct, and ghosts reluctant to appear, while the courts of the underworld delay compliance. Mastery of this method differs vastly from the practices commonly seen today.\n\n**Register of the Divine Tiger’s Dark Mystery Inner Bureau Officials and Generals**\n\nThe Master said: The registers of daily altar attendants pertain to routine affairs. The officials of the Dark Mystery Inner Bureau, however, constitute a separate office, not bound to daily duties. Thus, their names are appended to this chapter on pursuit and summoning.\n\nDivine Tiger’s Inverted Life Dark Bureau Jade Maiden: Jiang Renkui\nDivine Tiger’s Purple Origin Lady, Dark Mystery Pursuit and Summoning Inner Bureau Jade Maiden: Wei Ziran\nDark Mystery Pursuit and Summoning Inner Bureau Spirit Officer: Cui Hao\nDivine Tiger’s Left Male Jade Ministry Chief Scribe: He [ ]\nDivine Tiger’s Right Female Martial Phoenix Chief Scribe: Qiao [ ]\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Pursuit-Soul Register-Keeper Spirit Officer: Li Youjun\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Heavenly Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Gao Long\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Human Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Ma Zheng\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Spirit Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Xue Yan\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Hell Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Lei Fei\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Hungry Ghost Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhang Shouhe\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Violent Death Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhao Gongming\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Hidden Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhu Xin\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Heavenly Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Chen Congzheng\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Earthly Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Ge Sheng\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Watery Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Du Ke\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Upper Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhang Xin\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Middle Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Hou Di\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Lower Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Wei Kui\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Immediate Manifestation Envoy: Chen Zhi\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Retribution Envoy: Liu Yi\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Escort and Torment Envoy: Xu Zhong\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Night Illumination Envoy: Xu Nian\n\n**Divine Tiger Talisman**\nIncantation:\n\n**Divine Tiger’s Inner Bureau**,\nBy imperial decree, descend from the Mystic Capital.\nSummon the spirits to heed the command,\nAnd receive the celestial talisman.\nSwiftly execute the order,\nAnd drive forth in pursuit of the soul.\nI now summon you—\nHasten from the hidden paths!\n*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ*, come swiftly!\n\nWrite with black ink on black paper, inscribe the names in vermilion, and hold the Dipper Mudra while writing. Before any summoning, first use this talisman to call forth the generals, then issue the official document.\n\n**Divine Tiger’s Dark and Hidden Inner Bureau Pursuit-Soul Bureau**\nThe right-hand ash altar is the Divine Tiger’s Prison.\nThis altar is for inner, secret use.\n\n**Divine Verification Method**:\nUse two *dou* and four *sheng* of slaked lime, arranged according to the prescribed pattern. Next, during the day, apply the talisman, then summon the soul at the Ghost Gate. Plant the soul banner in the center, and arrange the talismans to its left and right.\n\n**Left Talisman of the Dark and Hidden Pursuit-Soul Altar**\n**Right Talisman of the Dark and Hidden Pursuit-Soul Altar**\n**Great One’s Soul-Drawing Talisman**\nUse yellow silk, eight *chi* and two *cun* in length, inscribed with powder, and hang it at the altar’s gate.\n\n**Purple Origin’s Passage to the Hidden Talisman**\nUse purple silk, six *chi* and four *cun* in length, inscribed in vermilion, and hang it at the center of the altar.\n\n**Three Realms’ Soul-Seeking Talisman**\nInscribe twelve in vermilion, hang them on the banner, and plant it to the left and right of the bureau’s gate. Burn nine within the sealed chamber.\n\n**Pursuit-Soul Incantation**\nWith the Dipper Mudra, recite nine times, and draw nine breaths of *qi* from the northeast to spread across the altar. Next, nine breaths from the east, three from the south, seven from the west, five from the north, and one from the center—all to be dispersed upon the altar. After burning the talismans, when a tinkling wind stirs within the bureau, the soul has arrived.\n\nThe essence of Heaven and Earth,\nThe gathering of yin and yang spirits.\nWith numinous *qi*, bind your form and soul—\nScattered, yet reunited; dim, yet bright.\nFrom nothingness, signs emerge; from emptiness, truth appears.\nSwiftly return to the numinous banner, merge with the radiant truth!\nThe Purple Origin’s talisman and summons descend to the Yellow Springs,\nThe Great One’s pursuit-soul command arrives in haste!\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Dark and Hidden Inner Bureau’s Pursuit-Soul Statutes!\n\n**Incantation**:\nOpen the Gate of Heaven, unseal the Door of Earth.\nHold the Human Gate, release the Ghost Road.\nSeize the ghosts and spirits, free them from suffering.\nThe three *qi* flow with light, illuminating the Earth Prison.\nThe Great One, by command, the Northern Dipper’s Divine Tiger—\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Great One’s Soul-Summoning Statutes!\n\n**Document Format**\nUse purple silk, two *chi* and six *cun* in length, one *chi* and two *cun* in height, inscribed in yellow, and enclose it in a square box as prescribed.\n\n**Great One’s Purple Origin Golden Document**:\nOn an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year, at the appointed hour, proclaim below.\n[Your] dharma rank and surname [are recorded here]. By imperial edict, [I] carry out the command.\nThe Three Heavens’ Great Sage, Celestial Master of the Great Dharma of All Heaven.\n\n**Issuing the Document**\nWrite in vermilion on yellow paper, seal the corners as a document, and dispatch it alongside the golden document.\n\n**Celestial Master’s Jade Hall Bureau’s Pursuit-Soul Altar**:\nThis altar, by order of the Great One’s Purple Origin Pursuit-Soul Golden Document, summons the deceased [Name], [their] years of life and death, and their true soul and spirit to appear before the bureau, receive deliverance, and be reborn. The pursuit and summoning must be executed as follows:\n\nBy imperial decree, command the Earth Bureau to seize the form and soul.\nBearing the talisman and obeying the command, traverse the Three Realms.\nAbove in Heaven, below on Earth—nowhere is left unvisited.\nThrough the Three Paths and Six Ways, urgently search.\nThe Gate of Heaven, the Door of Earth, the prisons and hidden chambers of the underworld—\n[Summon] the true name, the true soul and spirit.\nRide the light to the altar, without fear or alarm.\nAs proclaimed in the command, swiftly transmitted by wind and fire couriers.\n\nOn an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year, at the appointed hour, proclaim below.\n[Your] dharma rank and surname [seal].\n\n**Soul-Summoning Banner Format**\nUse white silk, inscribed in vermilion according to the deceased’s age and measurements. This talisman is used at the Ghost Gate—raise it on a bamboo pole planted in the earth, then perform the summoning.\n\n**Incantation**:\nThe true talisman shines with jade light,\nThe Earth Prison opens its hidden yin.\nThe Seven Stars follow the *qi* of life,\nThe Three Luminaries scatter golden truth.\nSoul, do not be startled or harmed;\nSpirit, do not sink into perdition.\nSwiftly attach to the numinous banner,\nRefine your form and return to the Jade Flower.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes!\n\n**Banner-Attaching Method**\nThe master says: When attaching the banner, first visualize the Divine Tiger’s hidden name, and the officials will arrive. Once the officials arrive, the soul may be drawn onto the banner. Visualize these two names emerging from the heart and kidneys, and the officials will come. Then attach the banner.\n\n*(Secret names:)* □□□□□□□□\nHold the breath seven times, visualize the transmission of the river’s flow. Once the deceased’s soul arrives, it will manifest.\n\nThe master says: This bureau ensures full manifestation—seeing the brows and eyes as in life. Thus, it is especially secret and wondrous.\n\n*(Secret names:)* □□□□□□□□□□□□□□\nThese fourteen characters are most secret. Hold the breath and recite twenty-one times, perform the Dipper Mudra, and spray water three times—then the soul will appear.\n\nFirst, observe the arrival of a cold wind, then watch for the attachment.\n\n**Urgent Manifestation Talisman**\n**Incantation**:\n\nThe radiance of the terrace arises here,\nThe hidden essence restores its form.\nThe luminous spirit completes the three hun souls,\nThe manifest ring swiftly becomes distinct.\n\n**Hasten! Hasten!**\nAs the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor swiftly seizes.\n\n**Life-Command Mudra.**\n\nThe master says: This secret has not been transmitted for a thousand years. In former times, when Emperor Wu of Han’s Lady Li passed away, Master Shaojun performed this method to manifest the lady as in life, enabling her to speak with the emperor.\n\nThe method employs seven panels of raw silk, inscribed to form the Seven Stars. On the deceased’s natal star, burn through one star. Place the silk before the spirit table, extinguishing all lamps and candles on all sides to plunge the space into darkness. The dharma master recites the secret incantation and sprays water, while the mourners stand in a ring. From the burned spot, secretly peer within—then the deceased will appear as in life.\n\nThe manifestation curtain consists of seven panels of silk, arranged in a wooden-fence pattern on all sides.\n\nThe master says: This is the inner secret of the Divine Tiger, unknown to the world. Now that the Great Teaching flourishes, it is transmitted forth to be bestowed upon the lineage’s successors. Those of the Dao who obtain this should recognize its swift and responsive efficacy—unlike ordinary Divine Tiger summonings. Keep it secret.\n\nThe □□(ghost+chrysanthemum) □□□(ghost+kalpa) method: With the middle finger of the middle hand, visualize a blue-clad child descending from the Dipper with a single *qi*, then blow upon the banner seven times—whereupon it falls.\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Seventeen concludes.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Eighteen\n**Chapter Twenty: The Transmutation of Immortals into Human Form**\n\nThe master says: To refine the form into perfection is the work of divine transcendents. When the three fields of the adept shine with radiance, the four symbols merge in harmony, the yang fire and yin talisman fuse with the alchemy of creation, and the spirit is whole with its full complement of numbers—then one ascends at dawn in broad daylight. This is the Dao of refining the form to achieve deathlessness. Why, then, would one need to rely on talismans and incantations?\n\nYet the world’s people, deluded in life and unenlightened by the Dao, enter the gates of darkness at death. Their single nature scatters and flies away, forever without a path to rebirth. If not for borrowing the transformative power of our own cultivation, harnessing the mysterious workings of water and fire in their mutual refinement, employing incantations to deliver them and talismans to revive them—how could the fragmented be gathered into a whole soul, the corpse be refined into a yang substance, and liberation be attained in an instant? Thus, this method is also the esoteric secret for saving the souls of the dead. How could one fail to revere it?\n\n**The Altar for Refining and Deliverance**\nThe master says: Our altar’s refining and deliverance derive from the marvel of true water and fire. The sun’s essence and the moon’s radiance are called true water and true fire. Thus, the Great Teaching takes the Three Luminaries as its foundation. Since the marvel of water and fire was first attained by us, what difficulty is there in delivering the dead? Though the Lingbao Nanchang refining and deliverance method exists, its water and fire emerge from our own sun and moon.\n\nOne must know that this altar is the progenitor of all methods—how much more so for refining and deliverance? The art of smelting and forging is only here that the orthodox transmission’s marvel is attained.\n\n**The Water Pool, Fire Pit, and Lamp Method**\n**Mobilizing the Refining and Deliverance Official Generals**\nThe master says: The transformations of our body follow the movement of thought, becoming the divided forms of our yang spirit’s official generals. Merging with the *qi* of Heaven, we mobilize our spirit, entrusting it to the talismanic form and borrowing the breath of ordinary water and fire.\n\nInternally, unite with the Dao in truth. First, visualize within our body, between the kidneys, a point of light the size of a bean. After a long while, it grows and flies out upon the water’s waves. The officials upon the waves all wear dark robes. The Jade Maiden, riding the *qi* of water, stands at the right of our body. We entrust her to the side of the water pool.\n\nThen visualize within the heart a pellet the size of a tangerine. After a long while, true fire bursts forth. The officials within the fire wear red robes. The Jade Youth, riding the light, stands at the left of our body. We entrust him to the side of the fire pit.\n\nThereafter, burn the *Plain Flower True Mysterious Jade Radiance Yellow Edict* and the *Original Yang Spontaneous Refining Soul Red Register* to summon true water.\n\n**Transmutation and Refinement**\nThe master says: When burning the *Yellow Edict* and *Red Register*, visualize each of the celestial bodies—thus, the water pool becomes the moon, and the fire pit the sun. Riding the light, they enter our body, merging with our body’s water and fire, and together enter the pool. One sees only a dazzling radiance, no longer perceiving the mundane world. Only then proceed.\n\n**Plain Flower True Mysterious Jade Radiance Yellow Edict**\n**Incantation:**\nTrue Official of the Mysterious Unity, Pure and Wondrous Primordial Sovereign,\nSend down true water, descending into the altar courtyard.\nWash away yin defilements, retain the true and admit the pure.\nThe soul returns to *ren* and *gui*, the womb nurtures the essence-spirit.\nDrink and absorb the mysterious flower, float upon the green bloom.\nThe dharma flows in a mixed outpouring, the body possesses radiant light.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, fulfillment is complete; the Three and Five respond in resonance.\nBy the mysterious imperial talismanic command, the Great Yin receives and obeys.\nThus, as the decree is proclaimed.\n\nThe Master says: This Yellow Edict is precisely the method for transforming true water. One should guide the moon’s rays to infuse the brush when inscribing it. When burning it, visualize the moon’s essence entering the mixed-water pool.\n\n**Primordial Yang Naturally Refines the Soul’s Crimson Register**\n**Incantation:**\nMixed *qi* crimson cinnabar, celestial radiance penetrates the Yang.\nThe crow advances swiftly, the golden rooster spreads wide.\nThe immortal furnace’s jade portal, the cavern descends with true light.\nFlowing fire blazes fiercely, the yin corpse returns to hardness.\nBy the talismanic command of the Supreme, the true Yang jade decree.\nInvoke and descend the fire *qi*, to shine with the sun’s brilliance.\nBy the borrowed talisman’s entrusted *qi*, transform and refine at Southern Prosperity.\nThus, as the decree is proclaimed.\n\nThe Master says: Having transformed the true water and fire, approach the water pool to perform the water-refining method, called \"moon’s rays refining the corpse.\"\n\n**Pure Yin True Water Forms the Lustrous Plain Flower Cavern-Yin Jade Talisman**\n**Incantation:**\nThe Great Dao’s true center, the One as the primordial root.\nThe profoundly mysterious true One water emerges from the Gate of Longevity.\nThe hidden soul sinks through nine nights, creation’s transformation no longer exists.\nAdrift on the bitter sea’s waves, submerged in the wind and waves’ depths.\nChannel this primordial water to irrigate the foolish, decayed soul.\nVast and clear, suspended in the Great Void, this heart shines like a full wheel.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Yellow Flower’s law commands.\n\n**Moon’s Essence Returns to True Jade Talisman**\nTen identical talismans, with ten rays of the method.\n**Incantation:**\nThe primordial chaos blends with the celestial origin, jade liquid ripples on golden waves.\nThe lustrous essence descends as true water, pure and luminous *qi* abounds.\nThe numinous source overflows the empty cavern, densely emerging from the celestial river.\nFragrance fills the Yellow Court, the infant sings in response to the season.\n\nThe Master says: Circulate the Moon’s Auspicious Radiance Talisman, merging divine water to float upon the numinous pool. Bathe the soul-spirit in the clear, cold water, wash the soul in the moon’s radiant light. One then sees the soul’s form become an infant, riding white *qi* out of the water, and only then proceed to fire refinement.\n\n**Infant Emerging from Water Diagram**\nChannel the Heavenly One’s water, merging with the Great Yin to irrigate it. The moon resembles autumn, moon and water intertwine in splendor.\n\n**Pure Li True Fire’s Flourishing Crimson Radiance Cavern-Yang Jade Talisman**\n**Incantation:**\nFlaming celestial sun above, resplendent spirit within the body.\nCrimson light knows no decay, true *qi* blends with Yang essence.\nMerging, the celestial gate opens, the Mysterious Woman visits the Plain Lord.\nThe Great Void’s form shines brilliantly, scorching and dispersing the hidden clouds.\nThe corpse’s *po* emerges from layered darkness, the cinnabar soul ascends to the jade dawn.\nThe infant nurtures the mysterious pearl, in vagueness forms golden blossoms.\nLuminous, luminous, the gate of the Mysterious Supreme, never apart from the spirit within the body.\nNine refinements birth radiant scenes, shedding the dust-bound heart of kalpas.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Yang-refining law commands.\n\n**Sun’s Crystalline Refines the Soul, Attaining Oneness with the Spirit Jade Talisman**\nNine identical talismans, with nine rays of the method.\n**Incantation:**\nResplendent and blazing, the Yang essence shines, molten gold casts fiery bells.\nThe Flourishing Crimson descends as true fire, refining yin to form the Yang spirit.\nBing and Ding’s fiery brilliance, blazing forth from the Vermilion Mound.\nRefining the embryo returns to the original beginning, gazing upward to ascend in reverence.\n\nCirculate the Sun’s Essence Yang Radiance Talisman, merging with the true fire’s blazing fiery pool, smelting the soul-spirit within the sun’s crystalline light. One then sees the infant riding the sun’s golden firelight, emerging from the flames to enter mutual refinement.\n\n**Infant Emerging from Fire Diagram**\nChannel the Earthly Two’s fire, merging with the Great Yang to smelt it. The fire resembles spring’s harmonious warmth.\n\n**Mutual Refinement Method**\nThe Master says: The mutual refinement method’s transformations are especially wondrous, thus it fully seizes the marvel of creation’s mutual fusion. Borrowing the talismanic script’s operational efficacy, it achieves the union of water and fire, harmonizing soul and spirit. Yin diminishes as Yang grows, naturally perfecting the true—how could this be a minor dharmic power?\n\n**Water and Fire United in Refinement, Forming the True Jade Talisman**\n**Incantation:**\nFlowing celestial Han essence, vast currents blend with Kun’s springs.\nThe Earth Mother covers the Heavenly Father, cold streams return to the true source.\nThe dragon ascends to reach the azure vault, Li and Bing intimately descend to the lower origin.\nThe azure sea births crimson flames, within fire bursts the celestial abyss.\nThe cock and hare nurture true essence, water and fire distinguish ugliness and beauty.\nPurple clouds shroud the celestial valley, the mysterious pearl hangs in the center of heaven.\nThe Yellow Elder sings the cavern’s hymn, the dead soul regains the infant’s form.\nNine nines’ pure Yang complete, the Marshal stands rightly in the courtyard.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the water-fire mutual refinement law commands.\n\n**Complete Perfection of the Dao, Returning Yang to Merge with the Body Great Talisman**\nVisualize the sun and moon’s intertwined radiance, guiding the soul to stand at the center, then proceed to completion.\n**Incantation:**\nHeaven possesses the three wonders: sun, moon, and stars.\nEarth possesses the three wonders: Yi, Bing, and Ding.\nHumans possess the three wonders: essence, *qi*, and spirit.\nEssence secured, *qi* complete, the primordial spirit is born.\nSpirit united with *qi* sufficiency, only then is the true formed.\nJia water guards the soul to preserve a thousand years,\nGeng metal restrains the *po* to form the peerless hero.\nBing and Ren, water and fire’s Yang essence,\nThree fields coalesce into the celestial treasure vase.\nThree *qi* return to One, reverting to the celestial root,\nBeneath the Jade Capital Mountain, sun and moon shine.\nCelestial light blends to illuminate Kunlun,\nTrue water and true fire refine to form the true.\nAscending through the purple portal, emerging from darkness,\nTranscending the three realms to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the complete form’s deliverance and transformation law commands.\n\n**Merging the Complete Form Talisman**\n\n**Nine Heavens’ Immortal Refinement Method**\nThe Master says: The nine *qi* are heaven and earth’s honor, the root of all things. From the One undivided arise the three *qi*, and from the three *qi* are born the nine *qi*. Thus, the human body, receiving creation’s endowment to possess form, is guided by nothing other than the nine *qi*. Those who receive the nine *qi*’s Yang become human. Losing the nine *qi*’s Yang, they become ghosts. Cultivating the nine *qi*’s Yang, they become immortals. Therefore, in refinement and deliverance, Yang *qi* is used to deliver yin *po*. Thus, talismans are borrowed to aid it, incantations to invoke it. As the scripture says: \"Hidden souls hear it and are delivered. Withered and decayed hear it and emit smoke. Dead souls attain this and regain their soul’s form.\" This is the work upon which both life and death depend—how could its benefit be small?\n\n**First Yang Talisman**\n**Second Yang Talisman**\n\n**Third Yang Talisman**\n**Fourth Yang Talisman**\n**Fifth Yang Talisman**\n**Sixth Yang Talisman**\n**Seventh Yang Talisman**\n**Eighth Yang Talisman**\n**Ninth Yang Talisman**\n\nThe Master said: The nine refinements begin from the Great Beginning’s formation of form. They are the method by which form is perfected, the body completed, and inner and outer made true. Without this method, the fetal womb becomes stagnant, and the dead *qi* solidifies at the root. Thus, the immortal refinement must be practiced.\n\nIt is said: When transmitting *qi*, one must rely on the *qi* of each respective direction to infuse it. The nine heavens distribute the eight directions and the center, each possessing the *qi* of its own direction. Applied to the human body’s creation, this means: The *Yu Shan Wu Liang* Heaven governs the *qi* of the East. All things arise from it, hence it is called \"Beginning Azure\"—rightly so.\n\nWhen gathering into one, it is the *Huang Yan* *qi*. One is the beginning of numbers, and the color of the beginning is black, which transforms into yellow. *Yan* means \"to flow through.\" Thus, the *qi* of *Huang Yan* is used to irrigate the fetal life, allowing the true *qi* to scour the yin of the corpse and open the fetal origin.\n\nIn practice, one visualizes the *qi* of the Eastern *Beginning Azure* Heaven, guiding it with the talisman into the crown of the deceased’s soul to infuse it. After a long while, the body becomes radiant. Next, the *Wu Liang* Heaven draws the *qi* of the South. The *Xu Yan* Heaven draws the *qi* of the West. The *Xiong Shu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the North. The *Bo Luo* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Northeast. The *Ying Sheng* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Southeast. The *Fan Fu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Southwest. The *Gao Xu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Northwest. The *Wu Xiang Wu Jie* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Central Heaven. Once the nine *qi* are complete, the Three Passes and Eight Sceneries are born. This is what is meant by \"without enduring suffering, the body radiates light, and form and spirit are both wondrous.\"\n\nThe creative transformations of the nine heavens are all methods for scholars to refine the body and attain immortality. Thus, they are fully employed to deliver the deceased.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Dong Ming Zi Hu*?\nThe Master said: The immortal embryo originally has no form; its likeness is cavernous, meaning it is indistinct between light and dark. When the first *qi* forms the womb and the second *qi* forms the fetus, there is as yet no clear or turbid. Within it is profound obscurity, but its mysterious gate is purely Yang, unadulterated. Purple is the color of Yang’s radiance, hence it is called the *Purple Gate*.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Chang Ling Ming Xian*?\nThe Master said: With the third *qi*, the Mysterious Origin has already divided. Here, the spirit-soul is born. The *hun* is Yang. Cultivating it, one may attain long life and spiritual communion, radiance and penetrating clarity, and refine the body into an immortal.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Dang Shi Ming Yan You*?\nThe Master said: There is Yin and Yang, life and death—this is the way of the world. The human body cannot be without Yin and Yang. Without cultivation, Yang diminishes and Yin prevails, and one dies to become a lowly ghost. Thus, *qi* belongs to the *po*, and the *po* belongs to Yin, its nature inclined to sinking and heaviness. Hence, *dang dang* refers to the stubbornness of stone, too heavy to ascend. When the *po* is strong, the *hun* dissipates. When the *hun* dissipates, the corpse becomes everlasting. One must circulate the Yang *qi* of the Four Great Elements to dissolve the path of the corpse’s *po*, merging it with the spirit-soul to refine and become an immortal.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Wu Xian Zhong Ling*?\nThe Master said: The five *qi* complete the Five Phases. When the Five Phases are complete, the viscera are whole. Thus, when the Five Phases gather at the center, one may refine the immortal and attain spiritual communion. The viscera are not the lungs and kidneys as commonly understood, but rather the treasures within the body, fully preserved—this is called *zang*. Stored without dissipation, with a place to return, this is called *fu*. Thus, the scripture says: \"When the Earth Treasury is opened, gold and jade reveal their form.\"\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Gao Zhen Chong Rong*?\nThe Master said: When the scholar has achieved success, the six transformations are no ordinary matter. The palaces within the body all attain spiritual communion in the highest realm. The work of becoming a true immortal is harmonious and fused, uniting with Heaven.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Gao Xian Dong Ji*?\nThe Master said: The seventh *qi* is Lesser Yang. Here, the *qi* congeals into truth, returning to the primordial and highest realm. The work of verifying immortality is profound and subtle, beyond full comprehension. Those who enter its depths are called *Dong*. Its secrets are not revealed, hence it is called the *Xuan Shi*. Thus, the *Ji* and treasured texts are the dragon scripts of the *Daoist Canon*.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Zhen Ling Hua Ning*?\nThe Master said: The eighth *qi* is when one is about to become a true immortal. This is what is meant by \"a thousand times attaining spiritual communion, sitting in disappearance and standing in vanishing.\" Preserving the spirit and transcending transformation, guarding the One naturally, undispersed and unlost—this is called congealing. Thus, when the power of the Dao is complete, one may become true, attain spiritual communion, transcend transformation, and achieve firm congealment—all are the Way of long life.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Zi Ran Xuan Zhao*?\nThe Master said: When the nine Yang are complete, one ascends into formlessness, neither forced nor contrived, neither created nor fabricated—this is called *Xuan Zhao*. All are the gradual attainments of the diligent scholar, hence the subtle mysteries.\n\n**Talismans for Receiving Transformation and Rebirth**\n**Water Talisman for Refining the Womb and Nurturing Form**\nIncantation:\n*May the hun return to Ren and Gui,\nMay the po restrain the nine tombs.\nPrimal True Talisman,\nUnfurl your light for ten thousand miles.\nCommand the breaking of dark obscurity,\nRefine the hun with true water.\nBind the Yellow Flower of the Well Star,\nMay the Lady descend with sweet dew.\nGreat Mystery’s true aperture,\nReturn and restore essence and marrow.\nStir the turbid and lift the clear,\nEnter life and exit death.*\n\n**Fire Talisman for Refining the Embryo and Restoring Form**\nVisualize the radiant light of the cinnabar field, knock the teeth twelve times, and form the Mudra of the Southern Dipper. Visualize the Primordial Beginning riding clouds above the crown. Write in red on yellow paper, infusing it with *qi*. Next, form the Mudra of the Northern Dipper, writing in black on yellow paper. When applying it, visualize nine phoenixes spraying flames and nine dragons spouting vast waters, the two *qi* intermingling within one’s own *qi*. Circulate them through nine cycles, and the Infant appears, its image following the body, golden light blazing brilliantly.\n\nThe incantation states:\nThe hidden and scattered return from afar,\nThe yin souls sink and fall.\nBeyond the light of yang,\nIron walls seal them shut.\nThe wisdom sun halts its radiance,\nThe Southern Mound’s cinnabar fire.\nThe Primordial Beginning’s jade talisman,\nRefines the embryo and scatters calamity.\nThe Northern Dipper revolves to the right,\nThe Southern Asterism abides to the left.\nReturn the embryo and transform the form,\nAll bones settle in harmony.\nEscape the body through Heaven’s Pass,\nSeated securely upon the golden lotus.\n\n**Talisman and Incantation**\nSouth *Li*, North *Kan*,\nThe tiger retreats, the dragon coils.\nCounterflowing waters swirl,\nFiery flames refine and seethe.\nThe two blacks intertwine,\nYin and yang penetrate the passes.\nCultivate the hun and nurture the po,\nReturn to the golden elixir.\nThe numinous treasure serves as the *zi-wu* axis,\nCirculating to merge with the true body.\nTen thousand disasters cannot invade,\nTranscendence shapes the immortal.\nForever depart the ghostly bureaus,\nThe soul crosses the Cinnabar Mound.\nMounting the golden simurgh’s carriage,\nRoam freely above.\n\n**Granting the Golden Register to the Departed Soul**\nThe Most High grants life and delivers destiny,\nThe Golden Register of the Primordial Beginning’s Mysterious Cavern.\nThe root scripture of the *Numinous Treasure*,\nIlluminating the Three Luminaries,\nThis is called the Heavenly Root.\nThe *Crimson Writ*’s jade characters,\nUniversally deliver heaven and humanity.\nIn the year of *Tai Sui* [X], the [X] month, [X] day, [X] hour,\nBy the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree,\nDeliver [Name] to forever depart suffering,\nTheir name recorded in the Heavenly Court,\nAs commanded.\n\nThe **Register of Eternal Life**,\nHaving been inscribed and presented according to form at the Three Heavenly Gates,\nIs granted in unison for the departed soul of [Name] to receive and uphold,\nAscending to the Cinnabar Bureau,\nRefined and transformed into truth,\nForm and spirit both wondrous.\nHere the seal is applied,\nHalf retained for presentation above.\n\n**The Celestial Bridge of the Supreme Heavenly Law**\nThe Register-Conferring Master, holding the dharma rank, your subject [Name].\nThe Register-Conferring Master, the Three Heavens’ Great Sage, the Heavenly Great Dharma Master of the Great Law.\n\nThe register is inscribed on silk,\nIts reverse marked with a scroll,\nAnd the frontispiece adorned as prescribed.\nWritten in gold powder and talismans,\nGranted to the soul being delivered.\nWhen sending the soul,\nPresent the talismanic decree toward the Heavenly Gate and the Bridge of Deliverance,\nBurning it in fierce flames.\n\n**The Teachings on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**\nThe Master says:\nThe Three Paths and Five Sufferings,\nThough their names differ, their retribution is one.\nThe toil of the Heavenly Path\nArises when the six senses are stained by the one center,\nThus at death, one receives the Heavenly Path’s toil.\nThe toil of the Earthly Path\nComes from laboring the body and wearing the form,\nHands moving, feet treading,\nAll dependent on earthly things,\nAt death, the familiar scenes are hard to forget,\nThus one receives the Earthly Path’s suffering.\nThe toil of the Watery Path\nIn life, through spring’s crookedness, ghostly cunning, and lust’s drowning of truth,\nHow much more in the sea of desire?\nAt death, thoughts cling unceasingly,\nThus one receives the Watery Path’s suffering.\n\nThe Five Sufferings, though their texts vary,\nWhat are they?\nSuffering of the heart, suffering of essence,\nSuffering of form, suffering of spirit,\nSuffering of the hun.\nTogether called the Eight Difficulties.\nThe scripture states:\n*Forever deliver from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties,\nTranscend the Three Realms.*\nThis speaks to the living.\nIf the living, within their mortal bodies,\nAre not ensnared by desire’s defilements,\nThey forever depart the Five Sufferings and Three Paths,\nThen may they transcend the Three Realms.\nNow, those who practice the dharma,\nUnable to deliver themselves from the Eight Difficulties,\nFalsely establish Eight Gates,\nUsing talismans to deliver ghosts—this is mistaken.\nThe suffering of the heart:\nWorldly people scheme and strategize,\nPursuing fame and sensuality,\nAll arising from the heart’s original purity,\nStained by desire—is this not the heart’s suffering?\nAdd to this lust and filth,\nYearning for feminine beauty—\nThis is called the suffering of essence.\nWhen essence suffers, the body withers and strength fails,\nNearing the path of death.\nIf the body does not generate spirit,\nThe corpse’s po blazes fiercely.\nThus it is said: suffering of spirit.\nWhen spirit departs, death is not far.\nWhen the mortal body is lost,\nThe Dao-body unformed,\nOne becomes bleached bones in the wilds—\nThis is called the suffering of form.\nWhen form suffers, one becomes a lowly ghost.\nIf the hun is incomplete,\nDrifting as a scattered po,\nSinking and stagnating without return,\nOnly then is it the suffering of the hun.\nThe four sufferings—of heart, essence, spirit, and form—\nAre the daily depletion in life,\nThus these sufferings arise.\nThe suffering of the hun\nComes only after death,\nThen one receives its suffering.\nThe Five Sufferings were never meant to establish gates.\nThe Eight Difficulties also arise from the heart.\nThe heart is the master of the body;\nWhen settled, the three karmas and six dusts are also settled.\nWhen the heart is chaotic, myriad conditions arise.\nIf one wishes to burn talismans to deliver ghosts through the Eight Gates,\nIt would be better to deliver oneself from the Eight Difficulties.\nHaving failed to deliver oneself,\nOne cannot avoid death,\nAt death, the Eight Difficulties manifest as retribution.\nAt that time, relying on others to deliver oneself—\nIs this not shameful?\nNow, by the Master’s decree,\nThe Eight Difficulties’ gates are not established.\nThe gates that were established were later people’s fabrications.\nThose who inherit the teachings\nShould cultivate the body to deliver themselves,\nThen rectify themselves before rectifying ghosts and spirits.\nTherefore, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings’ talismans\nAre no longer established,\nLest they delude the enlightened disciples of later generations.\nReflect on these teachings,\nAnd do not practice false doctrines.\n\n**The Departed Soul’s Holding of the Contract**\nThe Master says:\nIn the *Numinous Treasure* dharma,\nThere is a rite for the soul to hold the great contract in both hands\nTo enter the Three Heavenly Gates.\nThis is incorrect.\nThe formless and non-action\nTake emptiness, stillness, and spontaneity as their root.\nIf holding a contract can enter the Heavenly Gates,\nOne is inevitably bound by form and attachment.\nBound by attachment, one does not attain the wondrous.\nThus the Teaching Master specifically removed the contract\nAnd granted the Register of Eternal Life.\n\n**The Essentials of Refining and Deliverance**\nFollowing the *Crimson Clarity*’s decree to summon the generals,\nBurn the talisman to summon the generals,\nAs in the method of transforming water and fire.\nThe officials and generals encircle the water pool and fire marsh,\nThe Emperor descends to his throne,\nThe Compassionate One witnesses the transformation,\nThe Nine Heavens spread their nets,\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper’s Imperial Lords stand in solemn array.\nSummon the Water and Fire Lords to capture and transform the departed soul,\nRefine the infant by burning the talisman,\nCapture the infant and enter the water.\nThe water shines like autumn moonlight,\nWhite and black blending,\nThe infant’s body gleams and glistens.\nCapture and enter the fire for refinement,\nThe fire like spring’s warm qi,\nSteaming and refining the infant to completion.\nWithin the golden orb,\nA semblance of form appears,\nInter-refined within the purple-golden light.\n\nThe sun and moon conjoin their disks, guiding the soul into the *gan*-center,\nThe nine *qi* pour forth in irrigation, the golden light shines through.\nAfter a long while, only countless golden orbs are seen—\nWhat was known is now unknown.\nThe refinement and deliverance are complete.\n\n---\n\n*Wu Shang Xuan Yuan San Tian Yu Tang Da Fa*, Scroll Eighteen, concludes.\n\n*Wu Shang Xuan Yuan San Tian Yu Tang Da Fa*\nText Title: *Wu Shang Xuan Yuan San Tian Yu Tang Da Fa*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty\nThirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n*Wu Shang Xuan Yuan San Tian Yu Tang Da Fa*, Scroll Nineteen\n**Chapter Twenty-One: The Three-Five Step Pace**\n\nThe Master said: The secret of the three and five—how could it be easily known?\nFrom one comes two, from two comes three,\nAnd from three, the three luminaries divide and shine,\nThe three luminaries complete the three talents.\nFrom the Great Ultimate come the Two Modes,\nFrom the Two Modes come the Four Images,\nThe Four Images perfected, the Five Phases are whole.\nThe Five Phases whole, the five stars shine,\nThe five stars shining, the Five Peaks stand.\nThus, in the Dao, they are the Three Pure Ones;\nIn the world, they are the Three Talents;\nIn the divine, they are the Three Origins;\nIn man, they correspond to the three regions.\nAgain, in the Dao, they are the Five Elders;\nIn heaven, they are the five stars;\nOn earth, they are the Five Peaks;\nIn man, they are the five viscera.\nMan possesses heaven and earth, form divided into yin and yang,\nThe Dao of *qi* complete within a single body.\nIf one cannot cause the Three Fields to gestate brilliance\nAnd the five viscera to receive the numinous,\nThen one begins to drift far from the Dao.\nThose who cultivate it gather treasures in the Three Fields,\nThe five *qi* return to the origin,\nThe *po* is restrained, the *hun* is bound,\nSpirit complete, *qi* full—\nThis is the immortal’s Way of honoring life.\nThose who do not cultivate it allow the three *hun* to become the Three Corpses,\nThe five *qi* to become the Five Thieves,\nThe Five Thieves to become the Five Sufferings—\nThis is the ghostly Way of honoring death.\nThus, between heaven and earth, man is the spirit of the myriad things.\nTherefore, every gesture of hand and step of foot\nMust accord with the real—\nThe method of pacing the *gang* arises from this.\nThe pacing of the *gang* is the essence of flying heaven,\nThe numen of treading earth,\nThe true movement of man,\nCausing the Three Talents to unite in virtue,\nThe nine *qi* to merge as one.\nGhosts and spirits revolve with heaven and earth,\nEach step a pointing, each turn a revolution,\nPerfected within the workings of creation,\nThe divine luminaries at the left.\nThus, one step symbolizes the Great Ultimate,\nTwo steps, the Two Modes,\nThree steps, the Three Talents,\nFour steps, the Four Seasons,\nFive steps, the Five Phases;\nSix steps, the Six Pitch Pipes,\nSeven steps, the Seven Stars,\nEight steps, the Eight Trigrams,\nNine steps, the Nine Numinous Ones—\nThe ancestor of the myriad *gang*.\n\nThe Master said: The method of Yu’s Pace has lost its truth in the world.\nMost can speak of it, but few attain it.\nThose who attain it do not practice,\nThose who practice do not focus—\nThus, it rarely proves efficacious.\nThe *Huoluo* Dipper practiced today is the pivotal essence of the Three-Five Yu Pace.\nThe interlocking numbers of the *River Chart*—\nHow could they be lightly dismissed?\nYet, due to common transmission errors,\nThey cannot transform and communicate with the numinous.\nNow, I correct the errors and transmit the truth.\n\nThe Master said: One qi divides into three, named the Mysterious Origin. When the three qi divide and distinguish themselves, the Three Talents are established, mirrored in the human body. The forms of purity and turbidity separate into three sections. Each section has its spirit, also called the Three Fields. Each field contains treasure, thus one becomes two, two becomes three, and three becomes the myriad truths—together called the Three Origins. *Origin* means greatness, primacy. Thus, the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram speaks of *origination, prosperity, fruition, and perseverance*, and so it is.\n\nThe Master said: The ancestral qi of the Five Phases is called the Five Elders. *Elder* is the model of beginnings, the ancestor. Drawing the essence of the Five Elders, they divide to become the Five Stars. The essence of the Five Stars stands firm as the Five Peaks, corresponding to the human body as the Five Viscera. Above, they align with the Five Stars; in the center, with the Five Peaks—thus the spirits reside within.\n\nThe Master said: The spirits of the Three and Five penetrate heaven and earth, yet all return to the single body. In their operation, there are methods of generation and restraint, of control and submission. For prayers, exorcisms, and offerings, the mutual generation and restraint apply. For driving away and curing, mutual conquest applies. Whenever treading the stars, first summon the spirits of the Three Origins and Five Phases, then proceed with the steps.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Virtues generate one another:\nWood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, water generates wood.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Qi conquer one another:\nMetal conquers wood, wood conquers earth, earth conquers water, water conquers fire, fire conquers metal.\n\nThe Upper Origin Pace belongs to heaven,\nThe Middle Origin Pace belongs to humanity,\nThe Lower Origin Pace belongs to earth.\n\n**Incantation for the Upper Origin Pace:**\nStep the essence of heaven, command the myriad spirits.\nThe Upper Origin conceals my body, General Tang Xiong.\nAssist my true qi, repel and subdue demonic spirits.\nShould any dare harm me, return it to their own person.\nLet evil demons upon sight transform into fine dust.\nHeavenly soldiers guard and protect—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Incantation for the Middle Origin Pace:**\nStep the essence of humanity, strengthen yang and dispel yin.\nFortify my three hun-souls, extinguish ghosts and banish spirits.\nMisfortune cannot reach me, calamity cannot touch me.\nHarm cannot invade me—the Middle Origin hides my form.\nGeneral Ge Yong, lead a hundred thousand troops to guard my body—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Incantation for the Lower Origin Pace:**\nTread the numen of earth, secure the human path.\nHeaven revolves, earth turns, above *Kui*, below *Qian*.\nYin closes, yang opens, true qi flows unceasing.\nGhosts cannot harm me, people cannot injure me.\nHeaven is my canopy, earth my foundation.\nShould any dare afflict me, seize them to *Kui* and *Gang*—the Lower Origin conceals my form.\nGeneral Zhou Wu, follow wherever I go, swiftly become my truth—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\nThe Master said: For subduing demons and evil, for overcoming calamities and dangers, first step the Upper Origin Pace. Once the sequence is complete, enter the Middle Origin Pace, then transform into the Lower Origin Pace. If subduing fierce evil, further transform to tread the Conquering Pace—then control heavenly dragons and ghostly spirits, responding to the heart’s call without fail. Guard this secret.\n\n**The Conquering Pace of the Five Phases**\nThe Master said: For subduing fierce evil and overcoming calamities, tread this to subdue them. Water can extinguish fire, wood can conquer earth, fire can conquer metal, earth can conquer water, metal can conquer wood—thus apply the remedy in time. For example, to subdue fire’s misfortune, step metal and step water to restrain fire. The rest follow this pattern. If later students are unclear, simply follow the established form to complete the pace—do not add or omit.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Five Phases mutually destroy, earth and water sever ties.\nWater and fire annihilate, metal and wood do battle.\nGhosts and demons upon sight—behead and sever their feet.\nDemon kings tremble in fear, shattered above and below.\nShould any dare offend, forever sink into the dark abyss—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\nThe master said: This pace follows the sequence of metal conquering wood, wood conquering earth, earth conquering water, water conquering fire, and fire conquering metal. It is used for subduing and restraining. If seeking auspiciousness, reverse it to follow the mutual generation of the Five Phases.\n\n**Pace of Mutual Generation of the Five Phases**\nThe master said: The pace of mutual generation follows wood generating fire, fire generating earth, earth generating metal, metal generating water, and water generating wood. Each generation and each restraint adhere to the sequence of water as one, fire as two, wood as three, metal as four, and earth as five—totaling fifteen steps, the Way of three and five.\n\n**Incantation for Mutual Generation of the Five Phases:**\nThe Five Phases mutually generate, all affairs prosper.\nWater and wood achieve, fire and earth unite.\nMetal and water proceed together, misfortune transforms into fortune.\nGhosts cannot harm, people cannot encroach.\nThe dead revive, the withered flourish again.\n*Hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Yu’s Pace of the Ninefold Numinous Dipper**\nThe master said: This is the Pace of the Vast Dipper, also called the Minor Three-Five Pace. Many in the world do not know its details, taking its common use for granted without understanding its profound subtleties. This pace can subdue wild evil, command ghosts and spirits, and dismantle temples—yet it is often used in reverse, so I now correct the error.\n\n**Incantation:**\nSun and moon shine bright, heaven and earth pair.\nI rise with Heavenly Peng into the celestial realm.\nPassing lightly through the Celestial Balance, I meet the Assistant and retreat,\nReturning to the Celestial Quail, facing the Heart.\nThe Dipper’s Way opens as the demonic path crumbles,\nThe Dipper’s essence wondrous, governing the twelve celestial stems.\nRiding radiance, martial might arrays,\nQi ethereal, floating upon azure clouds.\nSeven transformations stir, responding above to heaven,\nKnowing change and transformation, fortune and misfortune arise.\nThe eight celestial lodges traverse the Celestial Pass,\nAligning with the six pitch-pipes, holding to Jia and Yi.\nTreading the Celestial Flower, riding the Celestial Task,\nClear and cold abyss—yet one may walk upon the land.\nBeside the Celestial Pillar, embracing the Celestial Heart,\nFrom here I pass to ascend the Celestial Quail.\nLeaning on the Celestial Assistant, gazing toward the Celestial Surge,\nEntering the Celestial Inner, exiting through Heavenly Peng.\nThe Dipper’s Way opens, extending years and life,\nAugmenting fortune and emolument, flowing to later generations.\nBorn in the netherworld for a thousand myriad years,\nA thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits naturally retreat.\n*Hasten as the law commands!*\n\nThe master said: The pace currently practiced in the world reverses the sequence of exiting and entering the Dipper, rendering it ineffective. Now corrected, it can command ghosts and spirits and expel demonic paths. Guard this well, guard this well.\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon, Scroll Nineteen—Concluded**\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon**\n*Title:* The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon. Compiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n*Source:* From the *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, category of methods.\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon, Scroll Twenty**\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Receiving Liberation in the Living Body**\n\nThe master said: The scriptures speak of receiving liberation in the living body, enduring through kalpas. This refers to those who cultivate in their present form. Later generations, unaware of self-cultivation, rely solely on ritual merit, seeking liberation before death—greatly missing the Dao. The \"living body\" here means the physical form in this present life. Those who \"receive liberation\" attain the Dao in their bodies, transcending the worldly net to become Perfected Ones. Thus, the body achieves immortality, enduring through kalpas without decay. Now, to liberate the body before death is to prepare the path for the time of dying—how can one know what is correct? This question is thus posed before the master.\n\nThe master said: This is because I do not approve of liberating the body before death in later generations. However, the Most High, in compassion for the world’s changes and humanity’s stubbornness—who can seek awakening?—realized that none could be liberated, and people would forever remain ignorant of the Dao. Thus, the precepts opened the method of liberation and transformation. Later students may cultivate their bodies and perfect their truth, freely entering the Golden Gate and roaming the Three Realms—what need would there be for this method?\n\nThe master said: Heaven generates the myriad beings, and humans are the most numinous. Yet their ranks vary: noble and base, worthy and foolish, rich and poor, long-lived and short-lived—all arise from different origins. What does this mean? Among the Six Paths, humans are the most numinous. Emerging from the Six Paths to become human is fitting. Those from the Heavenly Path are not malicious, their hearts always kind and benevolent. Those from the Spirit Path are secretly harmful, often wise and astute. Those from the Human Path know propriety and do not transgress, always following the correct principle. The rest from evil paths—such as hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts—are blind, deaf, mute, lowly, impoverished, stubborn, cruel, and lawless. Therefore, in liberating the living body, one must select whom to liberate.\n\nMoreover, the world’s great nobles, kings, and dukes, and the immensely wealthy, their ranks and family resources—whether high or low, shallow or deep—all arise from worldly fortune. What does this mean? Those who in past lives believed in and followed the Dao and Buddhism, practiced rituals and expedient means, built roads and bridges, established baths and offered food, performed boundless good deeds, and personally received scriptural teachings yet failed to cultivate—such people, after death and rebirth, return to the human or heavenly realms, receiving retribution according to the magnitude of their merit. Having received their reward, if they act improperly along the way, upon death they must enter the dark gates. Thus, the Most High, in pity, specially bestowed this method of liberation, enabling them after death to bypass the earthly courts, erase their worldly transgressions, and become like Perfected Ones. The precepts have clear prohibitions, and people come to cultivate through these.\n\nHowever, there are generals who command troops at the frontiers—these come from the ranks of deities and spirits. Though wealthy and noble, their names are entered in the Black Register, and they are tasked with killing. They are not suitable for liberation. Similarly, officials who administer punishments and interrogations, presiding over grievances and enmities, acting on their own judgment—these come from the earthly courts of the netherworld. They may be reborn in the Central Kingdom and attain nobility again, but they cannot be granted talismans for transcendence.\n\nThose who inquire further may include scions of hereditary noble houses and heirs of immense wealth—young men of fleeting years who know nothing of the Three Honored Ones. These are the very sort haunted by the lewd and wandering ghosts that lurk beneath their eaves and gather at their gates. Though rich, they do not live long; though noble, they remain ignorant. Heaven’s overseers mark their deeds, and they perish swiftly. These, too, cannot be delivered.\n\nThen there are those who carry meals along the roads—all the destitute and orphaned. In former lives, they accumulated karmic transgressions, and in this life, they endure the suffering of wailing and ceaseless toil, born as lowly men and dying as lesser ghosts. These, likewise, cannot be delivered.\n\nOnly elders of virtue, benevolent men, faithful laypeople, and nameless monks and Daoists who seek to return to the Great Dao, though unaware of its true source, may be delivered in this life so that, in death, they may follow the true path. For them, altars are regularly erected, and petitions are presented to the Three Heavens, notifying the courts of the netherworld to expunge their names from all records. Their names are then submitted to the celestial bureaus, inscribed upon jade tablets, and talismans are issued for them to wear. Half of each talisman is retained upon the body, while the other half is burned in offering. At the time of death, the talisman ascends with them.\n\nAll worldly people who hold no Daoist rank in life become lesser ghosts in death. During their time in the world, their names are bound to the registers of Mount Tai’s courts, interconnected across seventy-two case files, awaiting the opportunity for their records to be amended. To amend a record means that the registers of the earthly courts are linked to those of the celestial bureaus. Each case requires a brush, ink, paper, and an inkstone—whether made of paper or wood. These are burned along with the talisman for amending records.\n\nThe celestial overseers then sever and transfer the names from the earthly registers, issuing jade talismans for record amendment. These are inscribed on seventy-two slips of catalpa wood, written in cinnabar, and sealed with yellow paper before being dispatched. The talisman is sent down to the officials of the Eastern Marchmount’s netherworld courts, commanding them to expunge the transgressions of the named individual, wash away their karmic stains, and directly submit their names to the celestial bureaus to be inscribed upon jade tablets, awaiting the end of their allotted span so they may ascend to the divine realms of heaven. Let this command be carried out as decreed, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.\n\nIssued on the [day] of the [month] in the year of the Great Year Star.\n\nThe Master says: For the faithful who receive deliverance, whose names are recorded in Fengdu, each is to be issued a talisman for the expungement of sins.\n\nThe True Talisman of the Most High for the Expungement of Sins and Love of Life:\nThirteen slips of cypress wood, inscribed in cinnabar, sealed in blue, and sent down.\n\nThis talisman is dispatched to the courts of the Yellow Springs, the Three Offices of Fengdu in the Northern Capital, the Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources, commanding the expungement of the named individual’s three lifetimes of submerged retributions and accumulated karmic transgressions, severing their records from the celestial bureaus and inscribing their names upon jade tablets. When their allotted span ends and their fate is exhausted, they shall ascend directly to the Vermilion Mound.\n\nAs commanded, transmitted by wind-and-fire courier.\nIn the cyclical year ____, month ____, on an auspicious day and hour, the decree is issued.\n\nThe Master declares: For the faithful who have received deliverance, whose names have departed the Northern Bureau, yet the Three Officials wield their brushes and the Four Departments scrutinize transgressions, it is now fitting to issue a decree to the Three Officials—the Jade Talisman for the Pardon of Transgressions.\n\n**The Most High’s Jade Talisman for the Deliverance of Life and Pardon of Transgressions**\nThree slips of cypress wood, inscribed in cinnabar; sealed in yellow and sent down.\n\nThis talisman is dispatched to the Three Primes, the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, and the One Hundred Twenty Offices, commanding them to comply with the Dao’s decree and talismanic grace, expunging the sin registers, inscribing names upon golden tablets, ensuring the yang spirit’s eternal life, and harmonizing with the Dao. Thus, when the named individual’s allotted span ends, they shall ascend directly to the Immortal Capital.\nAs commanded, transmitted by wind-and-fire courier.\nIn the cyclical year ____, month ____, on an auspicious day and hour, the decree is issued.\n\nThe Master declares: For the faithful who have received deliverance, whose names are now recorded in the celestial bureaus, it is fitting to

deliverance, it is fitting to issue the talismanic precepts for pre-mortem cultivation.\n\n**Register of Salvation Formula**\n**The Most High’s Pre-Mortem Yellow Register for Salvation from

Do not waver; uphold the precepts single-mindedly, and protect the Guardian Kings of the Precepts.\n\nIn the cyclical year ____, month ____, on an auspicious day and hour, the decree is issued.\nHolding the dharma rank, your servant [Name].\n\nThe Three Heavens’ Great Sage, Supreme Heavenly Great Dharma Celestial Master.\nThe Master declares: When the faithful initiate approaches ordination, they shall shed the Three Calamities, transcend the Nine Perils, escape the Five Sufferings, then sever the roots of evil, dissolve the Black Register, extinguish the Three Corpses, and dispel the Yin Spirits—only then shall they become a disciple of the Dao.\nIf the Three Calamities remain unshed and the Nine Perils untranscended, illness and affliction shall still trouble them. If the roots of evil are not severed and the Black Register not dissolved, ascension to the True shall be difficult. If the Three Corpses remain unextinguished, desires shall multiply. If the Yin Spirits are not dispelled, one shall remain dull and unaware.\nNow, purify and refine, wash away filth and polish the light. Let form and spirit become one in clarity, forever free from attachment.\nIf, after receiving the precepts, one indulges in wine and lust as before, unchanged—if anger, greed, and desire persist—then the Register of Pre-Death Cultivation shall be in vain, and one shall not escape the Register of Ghosts.\n\nThe Jade Talisman for the Eradication of the Three Calamities\nAt the time of ordination, have the initiate stand before the altar and receive the decree face-to-face.\nIncantation:\nThe True Talisman descends, shining before the Stellar Palace.\nThe life-officer of [Name] dissolves misfortune and eradicates the Three Calamities.\nBoundless blessings and protection attend this ordination.\nBody and immortal become one.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Talisman for Transcending Perils\nIncantation:\nThe qi of the Dao flows; the qi of fortune circulates.\nThe Most High specially delivers the male initiate of pre-death cultivation.\nName inscribed in the Jade Calendar, calamities shall not arise.\nForever freed from peril, transgressions eradicated.\nNo disaster, no hindrance—peer to the True Immortals.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Talisman for Eradicating the Three Corpses and Purifying the Seven Spirits\nBefore the altar, recite the incantation seven times over the initiate, then burn the talisman.\nIncantation:\nThe Emperor’s salvation from the Mysterious Capital extends grace through the Jade Crucible.\nErase your sin-register, deliver your mortal frame.\nPeng Shan, Peng Zhi, Peng Jiao, and Fu—\nall transform and ascend as immortals, while the Corpse-Dog prostrates.\nThe Corpse-Sparrow devours Yin, banishing poison and malice.\nPurify the foul lungs, open the gate of goodness.\nThe demonic gate is sealed; ascend to the Immortal Capital,\nall transformed by the Mysterious Virtue.\n\nThe Master declares: Having eradicated the Three Calamities, transcended the Nine Perils, subdued the Three Corpses, and harmonized the Seven Spirits, one shall escape the Five Sufferings and proceed to cultivate the True.\n\nThe Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of Love and Attachment\nIncantation:\nThe True Talisman delivers from suffering, clarifying your heart.\nThe heart’s spirit, the Cinnabar Origin, ever guards the central chamber.\nNo lust, no disorder—day and night, constant peace.\nFreed from the suffering of attachment, turn the Great Dharma Wheel.\nAt life’s end, undisturbed, ascend into the Three Clarities.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: At the altar, address the initiate thus: The heart is the abode of the spirit; keep it ever pure and undivided. If defiled, the heart is disordered and the spirit depleted, and one sinks into the ghostly realms. Now, this good man has turned his heart to the Great Dao and established pre-death cultivation. He must think little and desire less, avoiding exhausting thoughts. After ordination, let his heart be like the night moon—perfectly bright, clear, and pure. Thus shall ascension to immortality be effortless.\n\nThe Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of Greed and the Body’s Affliction\nIncantation:\nThe Most High delivers the person, protecting the mortal body.\nBody like a precious tree, undecaying, unharmed.\nNeither aging nor depleting, its hue ever springlike.\nUphold the precepts against desire and disorder; sever greed and anger.\nCut off all movement, sweep away the Six Dusts.\nBody at peace, form at ease—ascend with the immortals.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: At the altar, address the initiate thus: The form is the body. Where there is a body, there is desire. Thus, the body is the mechanism of the Six Roots—eyes see, ears hear, and the body follows. Self-seeking, profit-chasing, and restless striving exhaust the form, causing the greatest harm. Now, having received ordination, cherish your body. Do not act recklessly, and you shall not suffer.\n\nThe Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of Lust and the Essence’s Affliction\nIncantation:\nThe Most High delivers the person, the Jade Talisman protects the spirit.\nSpirit undisturbed, essence-source unspilled.\nThus freed from desire, body and mind purified.\nReceiving the talisman, refine and transform, clarifying the central chamber.\nPrimordial essence unmoved, forever attaining the Immortal True.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: At the altar, address the initiate thus: Essence is the radiant essence of the entire body. Ordinary people, driven by desire, deplete their true essence, dissipating primordial harmony and withering their nature and life without awareness. Thus, excessive desire harms essence—this is called the suffering of essence. Therefore, the Sage said: “Do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life.” After ordination, cultivate a pure heart and few desires. Guard and preserve your primordial essence; let it neither spill nor leak. Gradually, you shall enter the Immortal True.\n\nThe Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of Splendor and the Spirit’s Affliction\nIncantation:\n\nThe Jade Talisman preserves the spirit; golden elixir refines the form.\nPreserve your hun-soul’s essence, govern your po-soul’s numen.\nWhen the hun is at peace and the po settled, the spirit-chamber becomes clear and serene.\nThe Three Passes and Nine Portals—each orifice radiant with light.\nThe spirit whole, without leakage, you shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: The spirit is the master of the entire body. Ordinary people, driven by excessive desire and delusion, fail to guard their spirit-abode; their minds constantly stray outward, their bodies wither like rotting wood, the Nine Portals become obstructed, and the body ceases to generate spirit. Thus, *The Central Yellow Scripture* states: “Alas for the twelve towers of the Mysterious Palace—who knows they have become the dwelling of the Three Corpses?” Then the spirit is depleted. Therefore, the Celestial Master’s maxim declares: “When the mind is chaotic, the spirit naturally dissipates; when qi is exhausted, the form withers as well. Those who profane the Supreme Law of the Most High shall daily consort with ghosts.” Is this not the suffering of the spirit? After ordination, constantly guard the spirit-chamber, let no reckless thoughts arise, and both form and spirit shall attain subtlety, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\n**Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of the Corporeal Soul**\nIncantation:\nThe Jade Talisman preserves the spirit; the Jade Talisman connects to the True.\nThe talisman transforms primordial change; the talisman transfigures into true essence.\nThe spirit-heart unmoved, the numinous palace ever clear.\nNo greed, no desire, no chaos, no licentiousness.\nThe hun-soul serene and upright, the myriad qi eternally preserved.\nUnburdened by suffering and affliction, the body radiates light.\nThe Three Realms attend as guards; the Five Emperors oversee the welcoming.\nThe myriad spirits pay homage; your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: When the spirit abides constantly, the hun-soul remains ever at peace. When the spirit-chamber is in turmoil, the corpse-po delights in greed, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, joy, fine clothing, rich food, desire, and licentiousness—all the nature of the po. If one can guard the true and eliminate the reckless, purifying the spirit-chamber, then the hun-soul shall remain perpetually tranquil and unified. If one fails to guard the true, defiling the numinous orifices, the spirit perishes and the boundaries collapse, the po flourishes and the corpse rages—then the hun scatters and dwindles. Once the hun dissipates, one drifts far from immortality and draws near to ghosts. From this day of ordination onward, never forget devotion to the Dao, never exhaust the primordial spirit. When the spirit is not chaotic, the hun naturally finds peace, and only then may one receive the teachings of preparatory cultivation.\n\nThe Master declares: The ordained have already passed through the Five Gates of Suffering. Yet while the mortal form remains in this world, one must still guard against the defilements of transgressing precepts, lest one sink to the level of the common multitude. Though delivered from the suffering of the Corpse of Peng, this is merely a formal record. You must further uphold the Ten Precepts—matters commonly violated by worldly people. If you uphold them without transgression, you may remain free of blemish. If you cannot, relying solely on the register of preparatory cultivation to ascend directly in the future may not meet expectations. The ordained should diligently uphold and not violate them. The ordaining master, at the altar, should further instruct thus:\n\nFirst, you must first honor the incense and flame of the Three Perfected. The Three Perfected are the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master—also called the Three Honored Ones. As an ordained disciple, your name is now inscribed in the Jade Register; you must not newly serve base earthly spirits or heterodox deities. All blood sacrifices and offerings not arising from self-cultivation of the True are called demonic ghosts. From this day forward, if you have previously served gods or spirits before ordination, you may now ritually send them off. By “ritual,” I mean preparing incense, flowers, wine, fruit, and scriptures to dispatch them—never serve them again. If you have previously worshipped the Buddha before ordination, you must establish the altar of the Supreme Three Honored Ones above the Buddha’s position; you must not allow the Buddha to overshadow the position of the Most High.\n\nSecond, after ordination, you must diligently tend the incense and flame, strictly observe fasting and precepts, and practice reciting true scriptures. By “true scriptures,” I refer to texts such as the *Scripture of Salvation* and the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*. As an ordained disciple, you should study the *Daoist Scriptures* to distinguish yourself for future ascension. If you persist in delusion and disbelief, rejecting the Dao, the Three Officials shall investigate and deduct twenty years from your lifespan.\n\nThird, after ordination, you must cultivate a heart of kindness and compassion. You must not secretly scheme against the good, harbor envy toward the worthy and sagely, or sow discord and incite litigation. You yourself must not utter falsehoods or deceptions, devise plots to frame the innocent, amass excessive wealth, covet superficial gains, or swallow the possessions of the poor and weak to enrich yourself. If, after ordination, you do not reform past misdeeds, after receiving the precepts, the Guardian Spirit Kings shall report to the Three Officials, who will revoke your blessings.\n\nFourth, after ordination, you must purify body and mind, gradually distancing yourself from desire. You must not gaze upon the young and beautiful, indulge in brothels, or commit unlawful or improper acts. From this day forward, sever thoughts of spousal relations; there are also times of precept observance. Maintain regular practice, and ghosts and spirits shall hold you in awe—the ranks of immortals draw near.\n\nFifth, after ordination, you must cultivate frugality in diet. You must not arbitrarily slaughter the six livestock, indulging in rich and fatty foods, which disturb and disorder your true nature. If you can maintain a daily vegetarian diet, it is especially excellent. If you cannot yet abstain from meat, you should at least observe a morning vegetarian fast. If even this is not possible, you may fast on the Three Origins, Eight Nodes, Gengshen, Jiazi, and your own birthday. On the day before the fast, abstain from desire; on the fast day itself, abstain from meat; on the third day, act as you please. Practicing thus is quite manageable. If you cannot uphold these precepts, relying solely on this fasting practice as preparatory cultivation, expecting future ascension, may not meet expectations. Moreover, you risk punishment: the Three Officials shall investigate, and the cold night’s wind-knives shall become your burden.\n\nSixth, after ordination, in all matters, restrain the mind. Beyond clothing and food, follow nature without deliberate pursuit. If you seek the heavens to nourish beings, even birds and beasts are constantly provided for with insects and grains. How much more so for humans born between heaven and earth—how could there be no allotted blessings? Each has a destined portion; do not exhaust your mind and thoughts in vain.\n\nSeventh, once ordained, let compassion and mercy guide your heart, and constantly practice hidden virtue. Hidden virtue means acting without others knowing—quietly performing acts of convenience as your strength allows. Where you can, do so: redress wrongs for the wronged; mediate conflicts for those in dispute; reconcile discord among kin; gently guide disobedient juniors with reason; feed the hungry and thirsty; heal the sick and suffering; clothe and nourish the cold and starving. If others wrong you, do not dwell on it; if you wrong others, reflect and repay them. Practicing thus, you may accumulate blessings for the human and heavenly realms. If you fail to do so, relying solely on preparatory cultivation to expect ascension may lead you astray—ponder this deeply.\n\nEighth, once ordained, if your ancestors remain in the netherworld while you seek ascension for yourself, have you not heard the scriptures say: *\"Seven generations ascend, forever freed from the ghostly officials\"*? And the *Three Invocations Hymn* states: *\"Seven generations born in heavenly halls.\"* Thus, the ancients who cultivated the Dao first delivered their distant ancestors before attaining transcendence themselves. If those ancestors remain undelivered, the root of death persists, and you cannot ascend. To deliver them, must you forcibly expend gold and silk to perform the *Nine Netherworld Yellow Register* rites? Rather, the key is to broadly accumulate hidden merit, seeking to perform merit without cost. The most fitting method is the *Great Ultimate Refinement and Deliverance* of Master Ge Xianweng—a practice simple and easy, requiring little expense. If you cannot perform it yourself, engage a virtuous ritual master each month to conduct it on your behalf, accumulating hidden merit to deliver your ancestors. Then, when you ascend in the future, you will do so without shame.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"If an ordained person has a relative who is a monk, and each month has them recite scriptures and confer the Netherworld Precepts to deliver the deceased, is this sufficient? Must one perform the Great Ultimate Refinement?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"An ordained person is now a disciple of the Dao, having received the supreme grace of the Most High, registered in the Jade Calendar as a mortal destined for transcendence beyond the immortal realms. If you wish to deliver your ancestors, even the Buddha’s vehicle could liberate them—but as a Dao disciple, you should not follow another teaching. You must perform the Great Ultimate Refinement rites of your own tradition to be proper and correct. If you act ignorantly or mistakenly, the Nine Bureaus will investigate, the Four Offices will impose penalties. Who will bear the blame? Strive with diligence.\"*\n\nNinth: Having already received deliverance, one must treat all beings with equanimity. Regard all—whether foe or kin—as equal. Let no small grievance breed great enmity, nor private resentment obstruct public justice. Remember that this body is not your own, and balance both gratitude and resentment. Do not persist in delusion, lest you fall into the karmic consequences of this life. If you wish to deliver others, apply your thoughts with utmost care.\n\nTenth: All true immortals ascend to perfection only after cultivating practice and nurturing refinement. Now, though you have received deliverance, it is not through your own cultivation but by dedicating merit at the altar in advance, differing from those who, upon death, must pass through hell before ascending to the Cinnabar Heaven. While this may serve as a provisional means of deliverance, it is not as fitting as cultivating practice yourself. In self-cultivation, preserving authenticity and upholding integrity come first; reciting scriptures and maintaining a vegetarian diet follow. Yet the Daoist gate is vast, its methods manifold, and the entry point may prove arduous. Without innate spiritual capacity, even in old age, one may never encounter a perfected master’s guidance. Now, through this deliverance, I briefly outline the method of cultivation, lest you remain ignorant of the path and find yourself adrift before the boundless ocean of sagely attainment. It is better to withdraw the mind inward, observe within, and let no worldly affairs disturb you. Before engaging in any endeavor, collect the mind in silent sitting; stability and wisdom will arise naturally, and the Jade Clarity realm will appear in clarity. This is what is meant by the great stability of divine radiance. Through this, one may gradually transcend birth and death, escape the cycles of rebirth, and ascend naturally without need for further cultivation. If your roots are not firm and you hear this with doubt or hesitation, unable to maintain practice, then at least observe the precepts, wear the talismans of preemptive merit, and await future deliverance. Do you comprehend my words? Only after full understanding may you ascend the altar to receive deliverance.\n\nFrom the severing of the corpse-soul onward, these instructions may be recorded in ritual manuals and recited at the altar to admonish those receiving deliverance to cultivate in advance. Once the recipient has been enlightened with the Ten Precepts and received the talismans for extinguishing evil roots, they may then enter the altar and undergo the refining through water and fire.\n\nThe master said: The water and fire preemptive refinement of the delivered refers to the formal procedure. The recipient is not a dead soul—how can they enter water and fire? Why is it called \"refinement and deliverance\"? They fail to consider that in ordinary people, the nine orifices are obstructed, the body does not generate spirit, and they merely inhabit a form, borrowing qi to move. This refinement does not temper the form but the spirit. Once the spirit within the body is smelted, the body naturally radiates light, and the golden tower and jade chamber generate spirit without fail. When spirit is generated, the corpse perishes and the po-soul falls away; the yang spirit remains whole, naturally free from calamity and demonic interference, able to ascend to the realm of transcendence. If the spirit is not refined, the hun-soul weakens while the po-soul flourishes, the corpse’s dust obscures clarity, illness arises easily, and death approaches swiftly, consigning one to the rank of lower ghosts. Even with preemptive merit, one cannot rely on it for transcendence. Practitioners must awaken to this truth.\n\n**Method for Preemptive Refinement of the Delivered through Water and Fire**\n\nThe master said: For those who have accumulated preemptive merit, set up the refinement altar as usual. According to the method, guide the recipient to first enter the water pool, where talismans are burned and rituals performed. Then proceed to the fire pool, where talismans are burned and rituals performed. Only after both are completed are the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts conferred, along with the preemptive treasure talismans, before the altar is dismissed.\n\n**True Water Talisman for Scouring Corpse-Dust**\n*Incantation:*\nPure and cool jade liquid, sweet dew cascading.\nYellow blossoms flow forth, the jade body naturally fragrant.\nWithin cleansed, without purified, the po-soul refined, the hun-soul dissolved.\nScouring the filth of the heart, the five viscera cool.\nA hundred passages unobstructed, refining into pure yang.\n\n**Talisman for Bathing the Essence in the Water Pool**\n*Incantation:*\nThree barriers purified, a hundred joints freely flowing.\nBathing the true spirit, effulgent liquid merging.\nIrrigating the womb’s stagnation, extinguishing demonic malevolence.\nThe flower pool overflows, suffusing the three palaces.\nThe true body sealed, ultimately achieving immortal attainment.\n\n**Talisman for Irrigating the True Origin in the Water Pool**\n*Incantation:*\nWashing the womb, dispersing stagnation, untying knots, opening the heart.\nSpirit complete, qi replete, the body radiant with light.\nMyriad spirits pay homage, the name inscribed in the Upper Clarity.\nNo loss, no transmigration, ascending to the rank of immortal perfected.\n\n**Talisman for Refining the Yin Corpse with Fire to Open Peace**\n(This is the true fire of the Three Luminaries’ radiant clarity.)\n*Incantation:*\nWith yang scouring yin, with qi merging spirit.\nSpirit and qi inter-refined, naturally attaining perfection.\nLight suffuses the three fields, the four limbs no longer yin.\nNine orifices freely flowing, a hundred joints at peace.\nThe sun’s qi brightens, the moon’s light gleams pure.\nThe two forces harmonize, the three luminaries shine as one.\nRefining into spirit-yang, to fortify the mortal body.\n\n**Talisman for Forging Yin Demons with Fire to Return Yang**\n*Incantation:*\nCinnabar Heaven’s true fire, smelting spirit-yang.\nCorpse and po-soul burned to ash, hun-soul strong, body healthy.\nMyriad qi harmoniously surging, the body guarded by yang light.\nWith yang refining yin, yin wanes while yang flourishes.\nWith yang refining the true, the true is complete and qi returns.\nYang arises in the jade chamber, light penetrating the Hall of Clarity.\nQi returns to the root, steadfast and boundlessly efficacious.\n\n**Talisman for Refining and Rebirth to Transform the Substance**\n*Incantation:*\nTrue fire blazing bright, illuminating the spirit chamber.\nTrue qi surging and merging, wisdom’s sun radiant.\nTrue fire refines the form, corpse and evil vanish.\nThe decaying corpse flees, the seven po-souls scatter.\nThe dharma-body, the true body, refined and reborn, the substance transformed.\nHaving received deliverance and refinement, ascending to receive the Jade Decree.\n\nAfter the water and fire refinement, the recipient is first made to stand by the water and fire pools. The master performs the rituals, guiding them through the water pool, then the fire pool. Once refinement is complete, the corpse and po-soul are purified, the hun-soul and spirit are secure and strong. Thus, one may enjoy a century of blessings and partake in the preemptive merit of the retreat.\n\nThe master said: The faithful who receive deliverance shall be granted the talismans and precepts of preemptive cultivation.\n\nHere ends the twentieth scroll of *The Great Law of the Supreme Mystery of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens*.\n\n*The Great Law of the Supreme Mystery of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens*\n**Title:** *The Great Law of the Supreme Mystery of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Twenty-One of *The Great Law of the Supreme Mystery of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens***\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Deployment of Generals and Officials**\n\nThe master said: The martial generals exist to manifest the intent of killing and conquest. The civil officials exist to preside over their respective duties. Together, they are called *shen* [spirits]. These spirits are not the dark and hidden ghosts of yin, but rather, those who inherit the teachings and cultivate without ceasing, their bones and form uniting with the immortal, their worldly toils utterly exhausted. In the Jade Hall and Golden Palace, none fail to generate spirits. Whatever the heart commands, all become generals and officials. Thus it is said: Heaven and earth unite with me, and I unite with heaven and earth. Spirits and humans assist me, and I assist spirits and humans. Essence and *qi* merge as one, swiftly guarding my true self. This is the meaning.\n\nIf one wishes to know the spirits within one’s own body, one must gather the spirit and sit in stillness. Once the celestial vault is settled and human desires are undisturbed, at that very moment, the true generals will appear before you. Thus, when the perfected masters speak of ascending immortals and transcendent numina, they refer to the transformation wrought by the two *qi* within the body.\n\nThe Twelve Hundred Official Lords of the Jade Steps of Great Clarity.\nThe Twelve Thousand Official Lords of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens.\nThe Twelve Hundred Officials and Clerks of the Solar Palace of Yang Radiance.\nThe Twelve Hundred Jade Radiance Youthful Lords of the Lunar Palace.\nThe Thirty Million Hosts of the Three Yuan Generals.\nThe Three Hundred Sixty Thousand Hosts of the Seven Kings of the Northern Dipper.\nThe Two Hundred Thousand Hosts of the Black-Clad Soldiers and Horses of the Northern Emperor.\n\nAll the above officials and generals were born of the essence of water and fire at the dawn of the Primordial Kalpa of Vermilion Brightness. In heaven, each day, three spirit-generals follow the body’s *shen*:\n\nThe general who never leaves the body, named Ziying.\nThe general who never leaves the heart, named Xuanpin.\nThe general who never leaves the spirit, named Changxian.\n\nTheir attendant officials and soldiers are innumerable. The above three generals were transformed from the three *qi* prior to the Dragon Han era. The Three Treasures divide into three *qi*, and the three generals descend as spirits into the wondrous gate of the human body—the Gate of the Eyebrows.\n\nEach day, the jade maidens on duty in attendance:\nThe Jade Maiden of Serene Harmony, Xuanyi.\nThe Jade Maiden of Longevity, Xianzhi.\nThe Jade Maiden of Transmitting Words, Daocheng.\nThe Jade Maiden of the Three Lights, Chiming.\nThe Jade Maiden of Slaying Demons, Miegao.\nThe Jade Maiden of Attending Incense, Xinzhen.\nThe Jade Maiden of Primordial Unity, Yiqi.\nThe Jade Maiden of Communing with the Real, Zhengxin.\n\nThe above eight jade maidens and generals, three at a time, totaling twenty-four, descend into the body’s Purple Chamber of Jasper.\n\nEach day, the thirty-six duty *gongcao* [functionaries]:\nThe Three-Five *Gongcao*, Guarding the Upright.\nThe Orthodox Unity *Gongcao*, Balancing *Qi*.\nThe Descending Perfection *Gongcao*, Rectifying Heaven.\nThe Slaying Evils *Gongcao*, Beheading Demons.\nThe Direct Memorial *Gongcao*, Communing with the Mysterious.\nThe Attending Perfection *Gongcao*, Consolidating the Real.\nThe Curing Illness *Gongcao* and the Red Talisman *Gongcao*, Single-Minded.\nThe Yellow Register *Gongcao*, Delivering the Hidden.\n\nThe above nine ranks of *gongcao*, four per rank, totaling thirty-six, descend into the body’s Jade Treasury at the hairline.\n\nEach day, the celestial clerks on duty:\nThe Yin Spirit Central Clerk.\nThe Yang Spirit Secondary Clerk.\nThe Left Tiger-Rushing Clerk.\nThe Right Tiger-Rushing Clerk.\nThe Left Celestial Physician Clerk.\nThe Right Celestial Physician Clerk.\nThe Left Demon-Slaying Clerk.\nThe Right Demon-Slaying Clerk.\nThe Black-Clad Demon-Capturing Clerk.\nThe Embroidered-Clad Demon-Capturing Clerk.\nThe Red-Clad Demon-Capturing Clerk.\nThe Cloud-Within Demon-Beheading Clerk.\nThe Five Directions Demon-Beheading Clerk.\nThe Three Origins and Four Beginnings Clerk.\nThe Memorial-Transmitting Clerk.\nThe Disaster-Dispelling and Calamity-Delivering Clerk.\n\nThe above celestial clerks, twenty-four each, encamp at the left and right of the body’s portents.\n\n**Talisman for Deploying Officials**\n**Incantation:**\nThe mudra is formed at the *chou* [second earthly branch] and traced to *wu* [seventh earthly branch] as it issues forth.\nGolden chambers merge in chaos, the Jade Hall stands majestic.\nLight penetrates the boundless, wondrously pervading the Great Canopy.\nThe left officials, ascending immortals, clad in radiant light and girded with rosy clouds.\nThe right officials, transcendent numina, illuminating the mysterious splendor.\nThe gate of wondrous mystery soars without error.\nCommuning with the real and the Mysterious Female, this is my immortal family.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\nThe master said: Deploying officials is the method of moving the spirit. When the heart moves the spirit, the spirit soars without limit—this cannot be fully expressed by mouth or ear, but only grasped by the heart. Thus it is called the method of moving the spirit.\n\n**Talisman for Receiving Officials**\n**Incantation:**\nThe mudra is formed at *wu* and *si* [sixth and seventh earthly branches] and traced to *zi* [first earthly branch] as it issues forth.\nHeavenly essence has descended, earthly *po* silently disperses.\nThe yang spirit is turned back, entering my celestial bridge.\nThe two *qi* of the immortal and the numinous stretch far across the celestial river.\nLight returns to the Mysterious Pass, neither drifting nor scattering.\nThe eight gates are tranquil, the heavenly *qi* pays homage within.\nLongevity and enduring vision, the inner landscape roams free.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\n**Jade Maiden Talisman**\n**Gongcao Talisman**\n**Celestial Clerk Talisman**\n**Generals’ Talismans**\n**Generals’ Talismans**\n\n**Purple Yang Union of Light Talisman for Summoning the Deities of the Three Realms**\n\nFor the talisman on the right: whenever inscribing any talisman, perform the Dipper Step and, in accordance with the method, visualize and circulate the *qi*. When summoning generals, soldiers, or clerks, inscribe their names beneath the talisman. When summoning deities, inscribe the name of the god and call forth by name. When dispatching generals, attach the talisman to the front of the memorial. In all applications, proceed as the intention directs. The practitioner must achieve inner comprehension and guard against attachment.\n\n**Incantation:**\nGreat Generals of the Celestial Origin, left and right clerks and soldiers,\nSix Jia and Six Ding, celestial generals and gods,\nHasten to the altar’s base, tarry not.\nBy the primordial talismanic command, descend as the Primal Unity.\nThe Orthodox Unity receives and upholds, empowering me with authority.\nDivine marshals of the Dharma Division, gods of the Divine Division, celestial immortals,\nAttendant clerks and direct talismans, heed my decree.\nWhere incense smoke arises, swiftly come before the altar.\nBy the Most High’s talismanic command, hasten without delay.\nShould you disobey, you shall be punished in the Dark Springs.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\n**Talisman for Summoning the Twelve Thousand Official Lords of the Jade Hall**\n\nFor all exorcisms, deliverances, or subduing acts, summon according to the matter at hand, and the response shall be as an echo.\n\n**Incantation:**\nBy the Jade Decree of the Mysterious Capital, proclaim to the heavens below.\nThe altar’s radiance shines, a thousand officials hasten forth.\nClouds race, steeds gallop, descending *qi* connects with the immortals.\nAs the heart directs, the Three Realms are made manifest.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\n\n**Method for Gathering the Spirit and Nurturing Within**\n\nThe Master said: When the heart wanders and the mind strays, the spirit does not abide in the body. Though one may not yet have heard the supreme Dao, one should at least understand the method for gathering the spirit. The human spirit is inherently numinous; if it is not, desires have muddied it. The spirit is inherently visible; if it is not seen, delusions have veiled it. Those who would follow the teaching must sever all delusions. As for social interactions and worldly affairs, though they may not be entirely eliminated, they should be reduced. Have you not seen how worldly people, ignorant of their true origin, chase after external realms and willingly enter death? For they heedlessly lose their true nature, unaware and unknowing, and do not believe that the body can attain the immortal rank. Those who follow the teaching must act contrary to worldly people, not drifting aimlessly entangled in the web of karma. Thus, Master Huan said: *Abiding in the vastness of the Great Void, I do not mingle with the multitude of beings.* For one must not blend with worldly people as one among them.\n\nIf you wish to see your spirit, first stabilize your heart. When your heart is stable, delusions too will stabilize. When delusions are stable, the heart remains ever clear. Throughout the twelve hours, apart from eating, maintain subtle mindfulness, burn incense, regulate the breath, close the eyes and contemplate emptiness. Nurture the breath continuously, embrace the light in silence. Practice this regularly, and delusive thoughts will not arise. The celestial true ones will return to the body, and within stillness, the heart will be seen—the spirit will manifest of itself. Though this method may not yet lead to true attainment, it serves as a means for disciples to gather the spirit, preventing entanglement in deliberate action and fruitless toil. Take heed, do not neglect it.\n\n**Method for Deploying Generals with the Red Talisman**\n\nThe Master said: Immortals and Daoists whose yang spirit and *qi* are abundant respond as they are directed, thus they command without commanding, are numinous without being numinous. Worldly Daoists, entangled in the web of the mundane, have not yet attained communion with the immortals and must rely on visualization to seek response. When dispatching generals or circulating the spirit, first close the breath and stabilize the heart. Do not speak to others, nor glance back. Visualize your heart as a red sun, within which resides a certain general, fully robed and capped, the size of a bean. Presently, they ascend upon golden light, growing to about three inches. Then they emerge from the mouth, standing beside the body, gradually expanding to human size.\n\nThen they grow to a hundred *zhang* in height, their majesty awe-inspiring. Dispatch them as the matter requires, and when the talisman is sent forth, it too transforms into the general’s form.\n\nNow, the heart is the convergence of human spirit. Among the five organs, it is called the \"Lord,\" its station most exalted, its function vast. Thus it governs fire and corresponds to the southern direction. The ritual master unites with the heart, hence the name \"Red Talisman.\" Comprehend this union.\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites, Scroll Twenty-One Concludes**\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites**\n*Scripture Title: The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites, Scroll Twenty-Two**\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Preserving and Controlling the Kalpic Turnings**\n\nThe Master said: The Great Dao gives birth to the Primordial Heaven; the Primordial Heaven gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to the Two Modes. Thereafter, the Five Phases divide, and the Eight Trigrams array themselves. Fortune and misfortune are determined, and the powers of punishment and virtue arise. Thus, Heaven holds the yang above, its three luminaries radiant and bright. Earth holds the yin below, its five peaks standing in majestic stillness. Humanity receives the numinous within, possessing all things in abundance, thereby completing the Three Powers and establishing the Ultimate.\n\nYet those confined by form cannot transcend their form; those bound by fate cannot escape their fate. Thus, when stars deviate from their courses, floods and fires bring great disasters. When Metal and Wood clash in punishment, the Five Phases restrain and overcome one another. Any deviation brings nothing but fortune or misfortune, leading to celestial portents: stars wander from their paths, drought and flood contend. Earthly portents: mountains collapse, waters boil, the earth quakes, seas dry up. Human portents: bandits and barbarians arise, warfare erupts in season.\n\nSuch are the calamitous fates. Therefore, the Most High established the Teachings of Great Peace, providing talismans to control them. To ensure Heaven’s enduring existence, one must first preserve and control the kalpic turnings. This chapter is established to weave through Heaven and Earth, protect the state and pacify the household, deliver people from the disasters of the *yang jiu*, and elevate the world to the fortune of Great Peace. Is this not excellent?\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dispelling Comets**\n\nThe Master said: Whenever comets or inauspicious stars appear, one should present the *Star-Dispelling Talisman* and recite the *Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries of the Numinous Treasure*.\n\n**The Most High’s Star-Dispelling Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nCelestial talismans traverse the world, preserving and controlling inauspicious stars.\nWhen celestial paths lose their order, follow the talisman and align with the scripture.\nThe Emperor’s decree is in hand, bringing tranquility and peace.\nTurning misfortune into fortune, malevolent spirits conceal their forms.\nBy the command of the Talisman of Great Peace, star officials obey.\nAs proclaimed, so shall it be.\n\n**The Dipper’s Light for Controlling Stars**\n\nThe Master said: Use the great majestic true light of the Celestial Dipper to shatter evil and malevolence, thereby transforming calamity into blessing. Arrange the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the four directions, and within them, array the Twelve Earthly Branches, controlling them with the Dipper’s light. Place three lamps at each position, except for the central Dipper’s position and those of the Sun and Moon, where only one lamp is set. Use sesame oil, keeping the lamps alight for three days and nights, reciting the incantation at the three periods.\n\nAt each position, hang a red banner inscribed with the *Star-Dispelling Talisman*. After three days, burn them facing the Gate of Heaven.\n\n**Incantation at the Three Periods upon the Altar**\nThe Dipper exists in Heaven, its might governing the starry heavens.\nThe power of the Dipper’s fire annihilates all misfortune.\nMalevolent stars and baleful *qi* dare display their omens.\nThe Dipper’s fire, ten thousand *zhang* in height, purifies the ten directions.\nStars and baleful forces retreat, malevolent spirits hide in concealment.\nFollowing the scriptures of Heaven, the nation prospers.\nReceiving Heaven’s talisman, no disaster can harm.\nThe harmonious *qi* of the Four Heavens eternally preserve *li* and *zhen*.\nShould any dare disobey, seize and deliver them to the Dipper’s might.\nI invoke the teachings of the Most High Lord Lao, by command, to save and seize.\nRecite secretly at the three periods, without counting repetitions.\n\n**Ritual of Pouring Wine and Sprinkling Water**\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dispelling Solar Eclipses**\n\nThe Master said: When yin evil encroaches upon yang, the Sun and Moon are eclipsed. This method should be used to protect and dispel, ensuring all is auspicious.\n\n**The Nine Dragons’ Yang Valley Radiance Talisman**\nMake banners of red silk, inscribing this talisman eighty-one times. Plant the banners beside lamps. Nine Daoists and ritual masters, clad in crimson robes, circumambulate the lamps reciting the incantation until the light returns, then gather the talismans. Burn them facing south to dispel great disasters and bring forth auspiciousness.\n\n*Incantation:*\nThe *qi* of yin demons seeks to violate the firm yang.\nNine dragons surge with light, restoring the yang’s radiance.\nIn an instant, clarity and brightness return, the great thousand worlds resplendent.\nYin evil and comets that encroach vanish without trace.\nThe crow-wheel blazes with light, all nations return to yang.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and command.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dispelling Bandits**\n\n**Master’s Instruction on Dispelling Bandits**\n\nThe Master said: Venus, the omen of misfortune—when its course strays from its proper path, comets and baleful stars appear, also portending calamity. If bandits have not yet mobilized, they may be suppressed through ritual; if already in motion, their threat may be lightened, and they will be unable to inflict harm.\n\nThe method requires forty-nine Daoists to establish an altar, prepare the offering, and present memorials in the usual manner. At the time of the ritual, recite the *Incantation for Laying Down Arms* and bury the *Talisman for Halting Weapons* outside the western gate. Arrange the Seven Stars in their pattern, inscribing talismans on bricks and burying them likewise.\n\nThe western gate refers to the west of the capital for a kingdom, the west of the prefectural seat for a commandery, and the west of the county seat for a district. At night, light the Venus Lamp, burn the talismans, and peace will be secured.\n\n**Method for Burying Talismans to Dispel Bandits**\nUse new bricks, inscribe in cinnabar, and bury at the western gate of the city. Arrange the Seven Stars in their pattern, also inscribing talismans on bricks and burying them.\n\n**Seven Stars Talisman for Averting Disaster**\nInscribe in cinnabar on red paper. Invoke the Star Lords governing the generals, draw *qi* to infuse the brush, and trace upon swords and halberds—wherever they are directed, none shall oppose them. Carry it on the person, and enemies will not prevail.\n\n**Talisman for the Commander to Ward Off Poison**\nForm the Dipper mudra, inscribe in purple on white paper, and hang upon a ceremonial bow and arrows for veneration.\n\n**Talisman for Warding Off Harm**\nForm the *sha* mudra, inscribe in chalk on white paper, and hang upon spears and polearms.\n\n**Talisman for Dispelling Baleful Qi**\nInscribe in black on white paper, hang within the altar, and execute the *Flying Seven Stars Mudra*.\n\nFor these methods, keep the lamps alight for three days and nights, ascending the altar at the three ritual hours. Upon completion, present the talismans and weapon-banners to Venus, burning them at the northwestern Celestial Gate.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Fire Disasters**\n\nThe Master said: Heaven’s punishments manifest as water and fire, but fire alone is most severe. When misfortune arises not from celestial reproach but from the calamity of Mars, this method should be employed to avert it.\n\n**Five Qi’s Mysterious Register of Yin Radiance**\nInscribe the talisman on black silk, two feet and four inches in length, in yellow ink. Display it openly before the altar to suppress fire disasters. Inscribe it with the *Mudra of the Northern Emperor*.\n\n*Incantation:*\n\nThe Star of Grand Yin at Chen, spirit of the Five Qi.\nSubduing the flames of fire, demonic dust naturally clears.\nThe Supreme Emperor commands: universally protect all living beings.\nRed clouds withdraw their blaze, the Fire Emperor retreats his banner.\nThe qi of Grand Yin, vast and boundless in the Mysterious Court.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Law of the Dark-Life Emperor of Grand Yin commands.\n\nRecite this incantation at the three ritual hours, thirty-six times each. Sprinkle the talisman with water until thoroughly damp.\n\n**Talisman for Petitioning Mars to Avert Fire Disasters**\nInscribe three identical talismans on red paper with yellow ink, affix them to a vermilion banner, and plant it before the star of calamity.\n\n*Incantation:*\nBy imperial decree, Mars, swiftly return your scorching banner.\nFire clouds extinguish their flames, the four borders grow solemn and clear.\nThe myriad people dwell in peace, baleful qi no longer taints.\nBy the command of this talisman, Flaming Star, heed with reverence.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Law commands.\n\nUse the *Noon Mudra* to conclude with *Zi*, reciting the incantation at the three ritual hours, twenty-four times each. Sprinkle the banner with water until moistened for auspiciousness.\n\n**Diagram of Lamps to Subdue the Fire Emperor and Avert Disasters**\n**Talisman to Suppress Fiery Radiance**\nFashion banners from coarse paper, each bearing twelve identical talismans, and encircle the lamp altar with them.\nAlternatively, inscribe talismans on yellow paper with vermilion ink and distribute them to households for protection and aversion.\nUse the *Mudra of the Northern Emperor* in all cases.\n\n*Incantation:*\n\nThe Southern Dipper’s Fire Officials dispel poison and harm,\nThe Northern Dipper’s Water Spirits extinguish misfortune and calamity.\nPress down with the *Kan* mudra, flick into water, or infuse into the talisman.\nAll requests shall be fulfilled,\nAll stagnation and distress shall dissolve.\nThose who reverently follow the scripture’s rites with sincere devotion\nShall surely have their wishes answered, aligning with the numinous mind.\nAll who hold this in their hearts and constantly pay homage\nShall find no gate through which misfortune dares to enter.\n\n**Talisman to Suppress Fiery Radiance**\nTrace the steps of the Dipper, clasp the *Mudra of the Northern Emperor*,\nInscribe on yellow paper with vermilion ink,\nAnd affix to the left and right of the central courtyard gate\nTo suppress fiery misfortune and welcome descending auspiciousness.\n\n**Two Incantations to Command Fire and Extinguish Its Might**\n\n**First Incantation:**\nNorthern Black Emperor, essence of *Ren* and *Gui*,\nAncestor of the Water Spirits, vast and abyssal.\nReverently summon the Dark Tortoise to subdue the Fire’s essence.\nCelestial waves of numinous power vanquish *Bing* and *Ding*.\nFiery radiance is quelled, transformed into pure *yin*.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the *Taiyin Xuanming* commands.\n\n**Second Incantation:**\n*Taiyin Xuanming*, essence of primordial *qi*,\nPure *yin* coalesces to subdue the brilliance of *Li*.\nBlack waves surge and billow, red light scatters into *yin*.\nWithin lies the Divine Lord, clad in black, dwelling in the Water Court.\nAble to subdue the Fire’s malevolence, the Primordial Sovereign.\nMighty springs churn waves, *Jia Shen* and *Cheng Ming* resplendent.\nRoaring and bellowing, dragons cry *ji sha hong*.\nWaves surge in all four directions, *yin* *qi* congeals in chaos.\nThe Fire of *Li* retreats, its radiance vanishes.\nBy the command of the Most High, the Fire Spirit obeys.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the *Taiyin Xuanming* commands.\n\nAfter reciting the incantations over the lamps and banners, sprinkle with water,\nAnd the Fire Star shall return to its place, the Fire Spirit retreat,\nTurning misfortune into fortune.\n\n**Method to Avert Earthquakes**\nThe Master says: Heaven moves while Earth is still,\nFor the heavens revolve above while the earth rests below—\nThis is the constant principle of *yin* and *yang*.\nIf the earth, receiving celestial influence, trembles and quakes,\nIt is because *yin* and *yang* have fallen out of order.\nThis method should be employed to avert it.\n\nThe practitioner shall first establish an altar,\nSet up a sacrifice to the Earth Deity *Houtu*,\nThen petition the *Kun* direction, and consecrate the *Purple-Written Jade Register*.\nPrepare the *Jade Characters to Pacify Kun*,\nThen disperse the altar.\n\n**Purple-Written Jade Register to Pacify Kun**\nUse cypress wood, two *chi* and four *cun* in length, six *cun* in width,\nInscribe the talisman in yellow, with the *Yu Qing* mudra.\nFace the *Kun* direction of the city,\nBury it three *chi* and six *cun* deep in the earth.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Five Peaks stabilize *Kun*,\nThe Nine Sovereigns uphold Earth’s order.\nGold and jade nurture flourishing refinement,\nMountains and rivers channel numinous *qi*.\nThe four corners stand firm without tilting,\nThe Nine Tripods naturally hold their place.\nThe August Spirits ensure eternal peace,\n*Houtu* governs with equanimity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the *Zhonghuang Anzhen* commands.\n\nRecite nine times at each of the three ritual hours.\nBurn the *Talisman to Pacify Kun’s Directions*.\n\n**Jade Talisman to Pacify Kun’s Directions**\nInscribe on yellow paper with vermilion ink,\nBurn at the *Kun* direction, using the incantation as the petition.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Kun*’s directions are pacified and still,\nThe Nine Lands are at peace.\nThe earthen ramparts bear the talisman,\nFor ten thousand years without tilting.\nMalevolence and omens disperse,\nJoy and great peace prevail.\nAs the command decrees. **Great Talisman of Pacification**\n\nOn yellow paper inscribed with vermilion ink, place before *Houtu* and perform the rites with incense at the three ritual hours.\n\n**Method to Dispel Locusts**\nThe Master says: Heaven’s calamities manifest as floods, droughts, locusts, and pests—all harming crops and bringing famine. The karmic force of sentient beings invokes these afflictions; Heaven has no intent. The Most High, in boundless compassion, provides this exorcism so the people may dwell in peace.\n\nLocusts arise when winter snow fails to fall, and insects breed within the yin. The malevolent, borne by fire, grow wings and take flight in summer, ravaging seedlings and crops. The eggs of these pests, once touched by the *qi* of snow, burrow three *chi* into the earth. After three snows, they descend nine *chi*. If snow is absent for a year, they rise three *chi*; if scarce for three years, drought follows, and locusts emerge as a plague.\n\nTo suppress and dispel them, erect an altar and hold a *jiao* ritual. Dispatch officials to drive them into water with drums and wind, and petition the *Fú* Spirit to gather the malevolent insects.\n\n**Talisman to Dispel Locusts**\nInscribe on yellow paper with vermilion ink. Face the *Xun* direction, pace the Dipper, and burn the talisman. Turn toward the south, recite the incantation thirty-six times, and spray water. After three days, if the ritual succeeds, wind will rise and locusts will enter the water.\n\nAlso, take two chestnut boards, inscribe a talisman on each, and nail one where the locusts originated. Erect the other on a high frame and burn it with chestnut wood.\n\n**Incantation:**\nFlames of the Vermilion Bird of the south,\nBlazing with the might of *Bing* and *Ding*.\nWings born of lost salvation,\nSpawned like dust in swarms.\nThe Nine August Ones conceal primordial chaos,\nAuspicious snow drives them into hiding.\nFire’s *qi* breeds malevolence,\nNurturing harm to the roots of crops.\nI summon the Earth God and the Lord of Locusts,\nThe *Fú* Spirit of command.\nDrums stir boundless winds,\nSweeping them into the sea’s depths.\nMalevolent pests scatter,\nCrops rejoice in autumn’s harvest.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\n\n**Method to Pray for Rain During Drought**\nThe Master says: When prolonged drought persists despite prayers, local officials must act with compassion for the people. Submit a petition at the altar, beseeching rain. The ritual master prepares the words, submitting memorials to the Three Heavens and the Heavenly Master’s court, and petitions all relevant realms.\n\nThen, open the altar, pace the *gang*, perform the rites, and summon the dragon spirits, with three, five, or seven days as the standard. Once rain falls sufficiently, hold a separate *jiao* to give thanks. If the rain is inadequate, use the method to hasten it.\n\n**Talisman to Summon Dragons**\nInscribe on black paper with vermilion ink. Pace the Dipper beneath the moon, face the *gang* to gather *qi*, and affix the talisman to the petition. Dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers to summon the dragon spirits, who will arrive at once.\n\n**Talisman to Drive Dragons and Bring Rain**\nInscribe on black paper with white powder. Burn in the incense censer, offering incense thrice daily—great efficacy is assured.\n\n**Incantation:**\nHeaven and earth’s *qi* unite,\nYin and yang harmonize.\nDragons ride clouds and mist—\nDare they disobey?\nSweet rains moisten the land,\nDrought demons vanish.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\n\nAfter reciting, face the moon, turn toward the *gang*, and spray water. If no response comes in three days, cast the iron talisman.\n\n**The Most High’s Talisman to Drive Rain**\nInscribe with vermilion on an iron plaque. Pace the *gang*, wield the sword, and dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers to gather *qi* from the celestial *gang* before casting it into rivers or lakes.\n\n**Upper Clarity Talisman to Invoke Rain**\nAn iron tablet, two *cun* and four *fen* wide, two *chi* and four *cun* long, inscribed with vermilion. Seal in a double-layered pouch and cast into a dragon’s cave. Retrieve it once the rain is sufficient.\n\nAll talismans follow the above methods. When casting iron talismans, choose deep, numinous pools within the domain—shallow waters are ineffective. If no springs or caves are present, use a numinous well. Near rivers or lakes, cast into them for greater efficacy.\n\nWhen casting the talisman, do not look back, lest sudden thunderstorms arise. Such is the swiftness of this response—proceed with care.\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Twenty-Two Concludes*\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls in total.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Twenty-Three*\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Severing Corpse Parasites**\n\nThe Master said: Those born in the Lower Era are ever beset by calamities. In this degenerate age, the roots of death pass unbroken from one generation to the next. Of all afflictions, corpse parasites are the most pernicious—transmitted by the Nine Worms, yet also arising when ordinary men exhaust their minds, deplete their strength, injure their *qi*, and squander their essence. Once the true [essence] is depleted at its root, perverse [influences] begin to spread without limit. Thus, the Mysterious Origin pities the world and provides methods for healing.\n\nYet the manifestations of illness are manifold, and the modes of contagion vary. Even houses and food may gradually transmit [the affliction], while clothing and *qi* readily entangle [the victim]. Only by severing the roots of death can one hope to restore the *qi* of life. Therefore, this chapter presents methods to relieve suffering and toil.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Treating House-Transmitted [Disease]**\nThe Master said: In abandoned dwellings and empty rooms, where human traces seldom reach, the *qi* of illness lingers even after years have passed. When a house stands vacant, its chambers sealed and stagnant, yin darkness congeals, and perverse *qi* fails to disperse—thus, the poison of suffering remains. Whoever first opens the door and enters receives its toxin; those with weakened spirits suffer its misfortune.\n\nAt the onset of infection, the hair bristles, the spine and back grow cold with shivers—these are its signs. The disease lurks in the numinous palace, lodges in the Mud Pill, and spreads to the four limbs. Over time, the illness finally erupts: gasping, coughing blood, flesh and bones withering, alternating chills and fever, dreams and spirits inverted—these are the symptoms of house-transmitted [disease].\n\nTo sever house-transmitted [disease], one must reside where contagion has occurred. After one month, swiftly return to the Great Dao and administer urgent treatment—then eight or nine out of ten will recover. Otherwise, as the contagion deepens over time, the disease grows more severe, and death draws near. Even divine power will be of no avail.\n\n**Talisman for Treating House-Transmitted [Disease]**\nTake a new brick, grind raw cinnabar in sunlight, face east, clasp the Northern Emperor mudra, and gather solar *qi* to inscribe it. On a *jia* or *ding* day at noon, bury it in the central courtyard at a depth of three *chi* and six *cun*. At the moment of burial, the ritual master paces the *gang*, wields the sword, sprays water, transforms into the Celestial Snail, and recites the incantation:\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Hark! Ghostly convulsions, swiftly depart the central courtyard!\nThe *gang* fire towers ten thousand *zhang*, lightning flashes and bells stream.\nScatter the ghostly *qi* with burning, sever and strike down demonic spirits.\nCorpse-transmitting and pestilence ghosts—hear this talisman and flee at once!\nPlunge ten thousand *zhang* into the earth, dissolve into fine dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**Talismans for the Four Corners and Eight Directions of the Patient’s Room**\nInscribe on catalpa or cypress slips with cinnabar, then nail them to the eight directions. Use the *qi* of the Three Origins’ Demon-Slaying Talisman to purge perverse *qi*, after which tranquility will prevail.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Talismans:**\nTransform the spirit, pace the *gang*, revolve the body into the Dipper, and draw *qi* to inscribe them.\n\n**East**\n**West**\n\n**South**\n**North**\n**Northeast**\n**Southeast**\n**Southwest**\n**Northwest**\n\n**Incantation for Nailing the Talismans:**\nThe heavens hold true *qi*, the Dipper’s majesty shines.\nShatter demons, subdue spirits, expel all misfortune.\nHeavenly soldiers stand in ranks, lightning flashes fly.\nGolden spears and iron steeds spread across the vault of heaven.\nSeize and capture pestilent spirits, sever *zhu* and dispel calamity.\nYou are a flying *jing* ghost, a corpse-transmitting plague.\nHear my divine incantation—flee at once to other lands.\nBehold my sacred talisman—scatter to the four directions.\nBegone, begone! If you do not leave, you will be seized and bound to the *kuigang*.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\n\n**Method for Treating Clothing Transmission**\nThe master says: Clothing transmission occurs when the living share bedding with the afflicted or contract illness through garments. Once the patient dies, their clothes, curtains, outerwear, and utensils must be steamed, for foul *qi* and pestilential infestations lurk within. Miserly households may reuse them, while the poor cannot replace them, thus nurturing disaster—how tragic!\n\nWhen the disease first takes hold, nights are restless, the spirit is unsettled, essence is lost in dreams, and night sweats alternate with chills and fever. If perverse *qi* lodges in the skin and hair and is left untreated for a month, it penetrates the bones; after two months, it enters the organs. When perverse *qi* gathers in the spirit’s abode and remains untreated for a month, it spreads to the limbs; after two months, it invades the marrow. When perverse *qi* entangles the soul and spirit for three months, the illness solidifies into malevolent *qi*. If it enters the organs and is left untreated for a month, the disease manifests. From this, we see that prompt treatment is paramount. Though this great method exists, if not applied early, its efficacy may falter.\n\n---\n\n**Methods for Treating Clothing Transmission**\n\nFor the method of treating clothing transmission, use talismans to fumigate the garments, then roll them up with the talisman and cast them into flowing water—do not look back. If the illness has not yet taken form, ingest the *Three Luminaries Qi Talisman* for a month, and recovery may follow. If the disease has persisted for two or three months, it may be difficult to cure. After one month, the *Inquiry and Relief Talisman* must be employed.\n\n**Talisman for Treating Clothing Transmission**\nAssume the Dipper Hand Seal, face the moon’s establishment, and recite the names of the Dipper thirty-six times. Dip the brush and inscribe the talisman, then fumigate with its smoke to attain peace. Next, place the talisman with the object and cast it into flowing water—do not turn back to look. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"The celestial talisman bears command, entering the Dipper’s midst.\nGhosts and spirits tremble in fear, vanquishing malevolent forces.\nThe Azure Dragon guards the left, the White Tiger the right.\nThe Vermilion Bird leads ahead, the Dark Warrior follows behind.\nTransmitted afflictions and flying corpses—traces and tracks obliterated.\nShould any dare remain, the Dipper’s fire and flying blades shall strike.\nBuried ten thousand fathoms deep, their bodies melted in flame.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**Method for Treating Food Transmission**\nThe Master says: The method for treating food transmission arises when one inadvertently consumes the remnants of a patient’s food, drink, or medicine, thereby contracting their pathogenic *qi* in the heart and abdomen, which may also cause illness. Generally, food transmission is still treatable, but transmission through dwellings or clothing allows perverse *qi* to penetrate deeply, making the affliction severe and difficult to remedy. In food transmission, if the patient has not yet died, the pathogenic *qi* has not fully taken hold, so it remains treatable. If treatment is delayed, however, it may become incurable over time, evolving into a grave illness—this must not be overlooked.\n\nThe method employs thirty-six talismans, burned together to produce smoke, which the patient must inhale and swallow—force them if necessary—until both talismans and smoke are fully consumed. Initially, fumigation may be difficult, but after some time, it becomes easier. The patient may feel phlegm rising in the throat and should cough and spit it out. Copious sputum and coughing, especially thick saliva, are particularly favorable. If the pathogenic *qi* is shallow, phlegm will be scant; if deep, violent vomiting with profuse saliva will occur, ensuring recovery. Once the perverse *qi* is expelled, further fumigation is unnecessary. Instead, ingest the *Three Luminaries Talisman* to replenish depleted *qi* and restore vitality. For a month, strictly avoid alcohol, lust, joy, and anger to ensure peace.\n\n**Talisman for Treating Food Transmission**\nAssume the Dipper Hand Seal, align with the Dipper’s *qi*, and inscribe thirty-six talismans on yellow paper with cinnabar. Burn them as incense. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Solemnly command the soul’s essence, luminous and radiant.\nThe Three Fields grow tranquil, the corpse’s spirit flees its form.\nLaboring ghosts disperse, the Nine *Qi* unite as one.\nThe talisman’s Dipper swiftly slays, no laboring affliction shall intrude.\nFlying infestations hasten away, ghostly maladies turn to dust.\nPiercing limbs and entering the abdomen, all malevolent vapors swept clean.\nTrue *qi* guards the body, upright *qi* endures forever.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**General Method for Treating Corpse Transmission**\nThe Master says: In treating corpse transmission, one must understand its intricacies. Among the Nine Worms, six transmit across six generations, while three do not. The stomach worm, roundworm, and tapeworm may arise from visceral toxins or familial transmission, passing down the six worms. Roughly every ten days, they traverse the four limbs in cycles, repeating endlessly. They feed every three days, retreating after five, and during their active phase, the body aches as they consume flesh. When they retreat, they return to their lairs, inducing a drunken stupor lasting five days, during which the illness temporarily subsides. This is the opportune moment to administer talismans and medicine. Otherwise, the worms grow accustomed to the power of talismans and remedies, making treatment difficult.\n\nA single worm occupies twelve lairs in the body; six worms occupy seventy-two. In a month, the first ten days see them travel from the heart to the head, roaming four lairs. The middle ten days, from the heart to the navel, roaming four limbs. The last ten days, from the navel to the feet, roaming four limbs. When administering medicine or talismans, this cycle must be observed. Thus, the classic states: Treatment within sixty days yields an eighty to ninety percent success rate. Within one hundred eighty days, thirty to forty percent. Beyond this, survival is uncertain.\n\nThose who pursue the worms’ original essence among the people often employ deceptive techniques, fabricating worms for profit—conduct befitting beasts. Instead, ingest the *Purple Court Talisman* at night, prepare an oil cauldron, and keep the surroundings brightly lit. The moment live worms appear, capture and fry them in oil, then cast them into flowing water—do not look back. However, success occurs in only one or two out of ten cases, for such forces cannot be defied. If the patient’s illness is mild, the worms may be invisible and untraceable, appearing only in dreams as figures bidding farewell—this is the sign. The *Purple Court Talisman* for pursuing worms is recorded in the *Celestial Heart Method: Talismans and Scripts* of this teaching. The procedures for pursuing worms are detailed in the *Celestial Heart* of our ancestral tradition. Later inheritors of this teaching must practice with reverence, for its efficacy is as evident as a shadow following form. Do not disclose it lightly. Guard it well.\n\n**Conclusion of *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Twenty-Three**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Compiler:** Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty\n**Volumes:** Thirty\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category\n\n**Principles of *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Twenty-Four**\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Prolonging Life and Averting Misfortune**\n\nThe Master says: Those bound by fate cannot escape it; those confined by form cannot transcend it. Thus, the *Lingbao Scripture* states: Even the sun, moon, and five planets wax and wane. The most sagely and divine beings experience rise and decline. How much more so for the unlearned, who suffer illness and injury.\n\nThese all are those bound by fate and confined by form. Thus arises the method for averting misfortune and prolonging life. Yet if one’s form transcends the formless, if one’s fate merges with the fathomless, if things bear no blemish, if spirits emit no ominous resonance—what misfortune could there be to avert?\n\nNevertheless, worldly people remain ensnared in the dusty net, stained by illusory attachments and habitual defilements. Without the salvific power of ritual dissolution, how could they escape the torment of calamity and peril? Moreover, hunger and satiety, toil and exertion, heat and dampness, wind and cold—any deviation from proper regulation may readily harm the primordial *qi*. Further, when stars of annual misfortune descend in conjunction, when monthly afflictions align upon the body, when yearly and cyclical forces clash, when dwellings prove inauspicious, when vows made to heaven are spoken with duplicity, when curses cast upon others rebound upon oneself, when malevolent spirits possess women, when flying earth and flying calamity startle and injure infants—even the slightest lapse may trigger disaster. Without recourse to the subtle and profound, who could transcend such trials?\n\nTherefore, this chapter expounds in detail the methods for delivering others.\n\n**The Secret Memorial to the Dipper for Averting Misfortune**\nAlas! The unlearned, deluded by the dust of toil; the urban and courtly, buried in the pursuit of profit and rank—desiring to cherish life yet lacking means to prolong it, wishing to escape misfortune yet devoid of methods to avert it. All this stems from fate’s predetermination and the constraints of form. Since their embodiment has not yet penetrated the true and real, they naturally struggle to withstand the turning of karmic cycles. Whenever the hundred-and-six calamities threaten, secretly memorializing the Dipper of the lofty heavens becomes the secret to preserving life and ensuring wholeness, the mystery of dispelling disaster and atoning for transgressions. This method serves as the urgent recourse for ordinary people, the vital path to reviving life. Yet if one cultivates the supreme Dao, awakens to true emptiness, possesses abundant *qi* and complete spirit, enjoys bodily peace and well-being—why would one need to borrow another’s power for ritual dissolution?\n\n**Purification Altar Talisman**\nFor purifying all altars and dissolving impurities, use this talisman. First, transform the spirit into the attire of a perfected one, visualize nine phoenixes crowning the head, the four numinous beasts arrayed in guard, radiance manifesting before the fingers, and the four Dippers shielding the body.\n\n*Incantation:* □□□□□□□.\nVisualize the Dipper entering the water.\n\nSummon with reverence the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, the essence of the stars, to descend into the water. All ghosts of myriad afflictions, swiftly depart ten thousand leagues—those who do not shall be slain. Western Venus Youth, hasten! As the statute commands.\n\n*Great Purification Incantation:*\nOṃ vāli oṃ vāli huṃ nauli tuṣṭa kroḍa kṣa kha svāhā.\n\nThe Seven Talismans for Prolonging Life are found in the *Chapter on Prolonging Life and Delivering from Calamity*.\n\n**Jade Clarity Mudra for Paper-Twist Talismans**\nAt the moment of first lighting the lamp, take one lamp talisman and fashion it into a paper twist to light the lamp. In spring and summer, begin from *Kui*; in autumn and winter, begin from *Pou*.\n\nNext, take one talisman and burn it in the incense burner, reciting the incantation:\nSpirits summoned, spirits arrive; sages summoned, sages attend. Transform this divine talisman, unite with the luminous heart of Heaven. Hasten! As the statute commands.\n\nSupreme Highest Clarity, safeguard life and prolong existence. The Six Harmonies and Three Officials, the myriad jade spirits of the Dao. Heaven dissolves, earth is at peace, the Seven Stars assemble in solemnity. Purple clouds bear the load, soaring to ascend to Highest Clarity.\n\nWhen awaiting the brightening of the Seven Stars, recite the incantation:\nHeaven is profound, earth is shallow, the sun and moon revolve. The Five Stars perpetually move, stirring my celestial image. I establish one altar—ten thousand ghosts all submit. With one stroke of the divine blade, ten thousand ghosts scatter. Hasten! As the statute commands.\n\nNext, present the memorial.\n\nArrange the ritual positions, and supplicate the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Numinous Seven Primordial Life-Protecting Star Lords: Here stands so-and-so, who approaches the Great Dao, beseeching repentance and protection. Your servant now follows ancient rites, solemnly establishing the Seven Star Lamps, erecting the altar for a secret offering, and proceeding as prescribed—arraying and kindling the pure lamps to divine fortune and misfortune.\n\nYour servant now calms the spirit and steadies the will, nurturing qi and returning to the spirit. At this auspicious moment, I submit this memorial, humbly entreating the Imperial Perfected Ones to descend and condescend to witness my sincere heart, granting your servant’s petition. The remaining details shall be proclaimed in the secret offering ritual.\n\nNext, in utmost reverence, I invite the Seven Primordials to descend, receive this memorial, and through the brightness or dimness of the lamps, discern fortune or misfortune. By the power of your majestic numen, may all wishes be fulfilled.\n\nNext, circumambulate the lamps three times, reciting the incantation forty-nine times:\nBright lamps gather light, wandering spirits do not flee.\nThe seven po return to their abodes, the myriad spirits all submit.\nAt midday, shadows align, ever dwelling in radiance.\nHasten! As the statute commands.\n\nRecite further:\nFollowing the celestial stem, erecting the Dipper, the ritual torch ignites the stars.\nThe Seven Kings descend—primordial, prosperous, steadfast, and upright.\n\nNext, establish the central lamp facing the Dipper, burn the talismans in sequence into each lamp’s basin, and visualize the circulation as prescribed. Place the life talisman in a water basin before the lamps.\n\nDivining by the Lamps:\nAt the *Greedy Wolf* lamp, divine one’s position—brightness portends fortune, dimness misfortune.\nAt the *Giant Gate* lamp, divine lifespan—brightness is auspicious, dimness ominous.\nAt the *Salary Storage* lamp, divine fortune and virtue—brightness is fortunate; dimness calls for expiation, almsgiving, and prayer.\nAt the *Literary Brilliance* lamp, divine official rank—brightness brings promotion, dimness stagnation.\nAt the *Integrity Chastity* lamp, divine marriage—brightness signifies union, dimness separation.\nAt the *Military Brilliance* lamp, divine illness—brightness brings recovery, dimness suffering.\nAt the *Broken Army* lamp, divine servants, disputes, conflicts, or pursuit of thieves—brightness brings success, dimness failure.\n\nFor households divining illness or misfortune, observe the seven lamps of the Dipper. One must be devout, wholeheartedly attending to the signs and offering repayment. Sweep and purify the ritual chamber, ensuring no gaps; do not permit women to peer in, and guard against cats or dogs disrupting the space. Burn fine incense in a blazing fire, and perform the rite in the stillness of night.\n\nIf the lamps burn brightly with long, steady flames, all affairs shall be auspicious. If the lamps are dim with short, scattered, or flickering flames, misfortune looms.\n\nA blue flame signals a lingering corpse in the dwelling—qi stagnation invites exorcism, quarrels, restless nights, and disturbances among the young and yin.\nA red flame signals wandering souls, plague ghosts, earthly calamities, blood taboos, flying soil, or sudden disasters and anomalies.\nA white flame signals legal disputes, external mourning, fright, terror, or household unrest.\nA black flame signals theft, loss, inauspicious travel, lingering illness, earthly offenses, or unfulfilled vows.\nIf the flame dims then brightens, or brightens then dims, ancestors seek offerings, and kin bring misfortune.\nIf the initial light is unsteady or the oil spills, spirits and ghosts swarm, demons press urgently, laboring insects fly or hide, the sick do not recover, and birth ghosts intrude—such signs defy reversal by prayer.\n\nFor any of the above anomalies, redouble devotion, pray earnestly, and perform the Dipper-pacing rite to subdue them. Do not be negligent.\n\nLife Talisman:\nInvite the descent into the offering.\n\nNext, examine the lamps and present the memorial, subduing and controlling as prescribed.\n\nThe master says: In presenting the memorial, use truthful words, not ornate language, lest one incur the sin of frivolous speech. Beware.\n\nFirst, compose the spirit and steady the will, performing nine bows. Next, dispatch the officials as prescribed. Then pace the Nine Numinosities, contemplating the nine qi. Kneel lengthily, silently submit the memorial, then perform eight bows while presenting it. Visualize your body as a circular azure light, with the Niwan Palace housing a Dipper-shaped star lord, ascending in sequence to the Celestial Gate.\n\nNext, visualize the Northern Dipper’s nine palaces in the heavens, each radiant:\n1. Jade Tower of Azure City.\n2. Five-Colored Jade Tower.\n3. Yellow Terrace Jade Tower.\n4. Vermilion Terrace Jade Tower.\n5. White Terrace Jade Tower.\n6. Mysterious Terrace Jade Tower.\n7. Nine-Colored Primal Qi Jade Tower.\n8. Purple Qi Jade Tower.\n9. Purple Mansion Jade Tower.\n\nEach emits golden light, intersecting with the golden light of the nine palaces within your body. Next, press your tongue against the upper palate, transforming it into a golden bridge connecting the Yellow Path across the void to the Dipper’s mouth. Circulate the plain yellow qi of the Nine Palaces, filling them above and linking to the golden bridge below.\n\nNext, dispatch the Three and Five Merit Officials and the Hidden Numinous Scribes to ascend the bridge. Behold embroidered-robed messengers and the two *Dhuta* envoys bearing the memorial, prostrating beneath the bridge to await commands. After a long while, a golden light ten thousand zhang long descends from the Nine Emperors of the nine palaces, entering the Niwan through the crown. Behold the nine stars of the Niwan merging into one.\n\nNext, bow at the altar’s base and secretly recite the incantation:\nI possess the Three Primordials and Three Imperial Ministers,\nTheir flowing light and blessings guard my form.\nAbove the Niwan, the Heavenly Imperial Minister,\nEngraves the character *Zhao* in the Central Mystery, giving birth.\nIn the Crimson Palace, the Left Assistant Minister,\nFirms the character *Guang* in the Four Transformations’ numen.\nBelow the Yellow Court, the Right Assistant Minister,\nReturns to the character *Ming* in the Valley’s Mystery.\nEntering the Emperor’s chamber, ascending to Highest Clarity,\nI soar on clouds, phoenixes and simurghs cry.\nHasten! As the statute commands.\n\nNext, recite further invocations, then the *Nahan Official Numen Incantation*, followed by the *Twenty-Four Perils Crossing*, and finally the *Central Heaven Great Spirit Incantation* to the *Primordial Emperor’s Upright Qi*. Gather the nine-colored lights into a sphere, perfectly bright, so that your form is unseen—only the seven stars’ light within the circulating nine qi.\n\nAfter a long while, withdraw, open your eyes, and perform the offering as prescribed.\n\n**Nahan Official Numen Incantation**\nHeavenly numen, flourishing in glory,\nMay it safeguard long life.\nOf the Great Mystery’s One,\nGuard its true form.\nThe Five Viscera Spirit Lords,\nEach preserve peace and tranquility.\nHasten! As the statute commands.\n\n**Star-Canopy Rite**\nThe Master says: When a household suffers unrest, enduring years of calamity and illness, entangled in official disputes, lawsuits, or strife, with deaths following one after another, or fires and thefts recurring unceasingly—first examine whether the person has cultivated goodness and accumulated virtue, free from grave transgressions. Only then may the petition be accepted and the Star-Canopy bestowed. This rite is of utmost gravity and must not be undertaken lightly.\n\nFirst, submit a memorial to the Emperor-Teacher, and petition the Seven Stars Palace of the Northern Dipper, the Eastern Florescence Prefecture, and the Southern Prosperity Bureau, beseeching that the person’s name be entrusted beneath the Northern Dipper. For example:\n- Those born in the *zi* (Rat) hour: entrust their name to the Northern Dipper’s *Noble Wolf Star*, the Heavenly Gate King’s Palace.\n- Those born in the *chou* (Ox) or *hai* (Pig) hours: entrust their name to the Northern Dipper’s *Great Gate Star Lord*, the Lesser Minister King’s Palace.\nThe rest follow accordingly.\n\nThe duration is set for one year. The rite is performed at the direction of the Canopy of Flowers, aligning with the first, second, third, and fourth months to the positions of *zi* (north), *wu* (south), *mao* (east), and *you* (west), cycling in perpetuity. Take a pillar, two *cun* and four *fen* in circumference—crafted from gold, bronze, silver, or iron according to means—one *chi* and two *cun* in length, symbolizing the twelve months of a year. Engrave seven segments upon it, each with one aperture, representing the Seven Kingly Palaces. Bury it in a pure vessel, one *chi* and two *cun* deep in the *kan* (Water) earth. On a yellow silk cloth, one *chi* and two *cun* in size, inscribe the talismanic characters of the Threefold Northern Dipper’s imperial decree and the Heavenly Stem Spirit Seal, then place it within the vessel. Additionally, file a document with the City God. Its summary states:\n\nThe Great Ming State, in such-and-such a prefecture, ward, village, and household of so-and-so, petitions on behalf of certain individuals for such-and-such a matter, pledging their lives and destinies to the Seven Kingly Palaces of the Northern Dipper. They humbly request the dispatch of officials and clerks, along with the household’s Controller of Fate and Earth God, to guard and protect them. Upon the completion of the one-year term, the vessel shall be opened, and a grand jiao offering shall be held to express gratitude.\n\nEach person shall, according to their age, thread a strip of silk through the aperture, and all shall be placed within the vessel. Additionally, take an iron lid, bore a hole in its base to match the precious pillar, and inscribe three talismans within. When lowering the vessel, stand the precious pillar inside it, then fit the lid over the vessel’s mouth, aligning it with the apertures of the Seven Kingly Palaces. Further, use an iron plate, two *cun* wide and seven *cun* long, inscribe upon it the Threefold Northern Dipper’s imperial decree and the Heavenly Stem Spirit Seal, and affix it to the reverse side of the aperture, securing it to the lid’s base with crimson silk.\n\nNext, prepare a new gold-lacquered bucket, two *chi* and four *cun* in height and width, to enclose the vessel, precious pillar, and iron talisman. Fill the surrounding space with pure earth, seal it tightly, and cover it with a large table, draping it with a tablecloth. Arrange the divine seats of the supervising deities upon it, and offer incense morning and evening. If no existing structure stands at the *huagai* direction, construct a small shelter to cover it.\n\nWhen lowering the vessel, first arrange the sacred seats. On the preceding night, light the Lamp of Extended Life inscribed with the imperial decree. The next morning, proceed to the designated direction, burn incense, perform the divine step of the Dipper, and clasp the Dipper mudra while facing *kan* (Water). Recite the incantation:\n\nHeaven is my canopy,\nEarth is my support.\nThe Northern Dipper’s suspended stars\nAre my raiment.\nI conceal my name within the Seven Kingly Palaces,\nAt the heart of flowing fire,\nTo attain long life, transcend fate,\nAnd enjoy a hundredfold well-being.\nThe *zhi* cannot harm me,\nThe *gan* cannot harm me.\nThose who aid me are the Great Yang;\nThose who oppose me shall perish.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Emperor decrees.\n\nThen visualize the *qi* of the *gang* filling the *kan* earth, envision the precious pillar as a palace of jade and crystal, and cast the money and silk into the vessel. As the pillar is lowered, affix the talisman, seal the lid, burn incense again, clasp the Dipper mudra, and recite the Great Divine Incantation of the Northern Dipper’s Celestial Center. Command the guardian spirits to their posts, then present offerings of wine, fruit, paper money, and spirit horses to the vessel’s guardians.\n\nAfter one year, when opening the vessel, perform the same visualization and transformation as before. At the vessel’s location, recite the Opening Incantation:\n\nNorthern Dipper’s seven stars,\nPivot of the Supreme Emperor.\nPreserve life, protect destiny,\nAugment fortune and blessings.\nAs the stellar cycle completes,\nAll calamities dissolve.\nOpen this vessel,\nTo report above to the Pure Capital.\nGuardian spirits,\nReturn each to your abode.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Emperor decrees.\n\nThen dismantle the vessel, retrieve the talismans and silk from within, and burn them during the jiao offering. Additionally, submit a petition in advance to the relevant authorities to recall the soldiers and generals, and issue documents to dismiss and return the guardian troops.\n\n**Required Documents:**\nPetition of the Stellar Patron.\n\n**Petition of the Perfected Master.**\n**Memorial to the Seven Palaces of the Kings.**\n**Memorial to the Eastern Peak.**\n**Document to the Officers and Generals of the Altar.**\n**Document to the City God.**\n**Writs to the Earth Gods and other deities.**\n\n**Sacred Positions of the Vessel’s Lid:**\nThe Eleven Luminaries of Supreme Purity.\nThe Three Terraces and Canopy Star Lords.\nThe Six Controllers of the Southern Dipper.\nThe Seven Kings of the Northern Dipper, the Nine August Ones, and the Star Officials of the Original Destiny.\nThe Lord of the Eastern Peak.\nThe Officers of the Year-Star and the Cyclical Signs.\n\nAll the above are arrayed in their proper positions. The guardian officers and generals are arrayed to the sides. Incense is burned morning and evening daily. On the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, and the birthdays of the destiny-stars, offerings are made to each position according to one’s means.\n\n**Pillar Inscription (Text Beneath the Talisman):**\nOn the day of such-and-such a month in the year of the Year-Star, the disciples of such-and-such a prefecture, county, village, and so forth, entrust their bodies and lives to the Seven Palaces of the Northern Dipper. We humbly invoke the Great Yang, the Great Yin, the Five Planets, the Four Luminaries, the Three Terraces, the Canopy, the Southern Asterism, the Northern Dipper, the Star Lords of Original Destiny, the Three Officials, the Four Sages, the Eight Great Vajras, the Nine Heavenly Perfected Ladies, the Dharma-Protecting Kings of the Ten Directions, the Six Dings and Six Jias, the Heavenly Soldiers, the Mighty Warriors, the Envoys of the Five Thunders, the Earl of Wind, the Master of Rain, the Twenty-Four Qi, the Seventy-Two Seasonal Nodes, the Year-Star, the Great Yin, the Cyclical Signs, the various officers, the City God, the Earth Rulers, the Household Deities, the Controller of Destiny, and all the inner and outer spirits to descend. May the true qi of the Radiant Light descend into the vessel, so that the disciples, so-and-so and others, may have their calamities dissolved and their blessings and felicity amassed.\n\nAll as decreed by the August Emperor.\n\nThe dharma-positions are duly recorded, names inscribed, and seals affixed according to ritual protocol.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Pestilence**\n\nThe Master said: People live in the world, recklessly exhausting body and mind, deluded by the physical form, unable to circulate and nurture their qi. Thus, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness assail them from without, while excesses of desire, wine, and food ravage them from within. This causes the true qi of the Four Great Elements in the body to decline, leaving one weak in strength and weary in spirit. When the essence and marrow falter, the primordial qi becomes unstable, and pestilential diseases arise.\n\nIf one could regulate daily life to avoid cold and heat, moderate diet, nurture the illusory body, sever excessive desires to stabilize the primordial essence, and cultivate the true heart to follow the Supreme Dao, then body and spirit would both attain perfection. Qi and blood would radiate brilliance, and one would ascend to transcendence—how then could one suffer from malignant diseases or seek methods to subdue them?\n\nThe *Medical Classic* states: *\"Store essence in winter, and one will not fall ill with pestilence in spring.\"* This is no empty saying.\n\nNow, out of the Most High’s compassion, a method of subjugation is established to deliver those who have lost their true nature and fallen into the kalpas. May they avoid encountering demonic afflictions, and may all people attain benevolence and longevity—this is the fundamental intent of the Most High’s love for life.\n\nFormerly, I once asked the Master: *\"From what cause does this illness arise?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"If one is harmed by cold in winter, pestilence arises in spring. If one is injured by wind in spring, diarrhea occurs in summer. If one is affected by summerheat in summer, malaria and dysentery follow in autumn. If one is struck by dampness in autumn, coughing ensues in winter. This is the general pattern. All are due to the unbalanced qi of the four seasons invading the numinous spirit, where the perverse assails the upright, giving rise to calamity and peril. Thus, the Five Phases are the root of harm to the body, each overcoming and destroying the other. Pestilence arises from the mutual conquest of the Five Phases, hence it is called the Five Pestilences.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"The discourse on gods and ghosts began when the Patriarch subdued the Ghost Kings of the Six Heavens and the Five Divisional Ghost Marshals, dispersing the malevolent and expelling the toxic. These were not the yin spirits of the dead. Now, the Patriarch has subjugated the Five Divisions and restored them to the correct path, thus consolidating the authority over pestilence. After swearing oaths to the Patriarch, the ghosts of the Five Divisions long ago returned to the true Dao. Thus, Zhang Yuanbo, through loyalty and sincerity, was appointed as the Direct Attendant of the Thunder Bureau. Zhao Gongming, through awe-inspiring integrity, became the Great General of the Dark Altar. The rest became chieftains of the grim prisons of Fengdu, no longer acting as demons.*\n\n*In recent times, human hearts have grown perverse and deceitful, recklessly worshipping licentious shrines and inviting misfortune upon themselves. Ghosts arise from the mind, and illness stems from delusion. Thus, the demonic factions of the lower realms and the blood-consuming ghosts, receiving offerings, freely perpetrate their poisonous harm. This is not the doing of the Five Divisions after their subjugation, who would never again act recklessly.*\n\n*The human heart is subtly wondrous, with qi and blood circulating throughout. The Three Regions and Eight Sceneries are all imbued with spirit within the true. Thus, one can repel the gods of life and death, becoming an Immortal of Great Sagehood. But if one deviates from proper nurturing, the Nine Orifices become obstructed, the body fails to generate spirit, and one becomes a walking corpse, a ghost borrowing qi, or a witless shade—far beyond the Five Pestilences alone.*\n\n*Now, the Most High’s ancestral method for subduing the Six Heavens and Five Divisions is transmitted to suppress the Five Pestilences, decapitate demonic hordes, and purify the body of pestilential evil with talismans. Then, with the Celestial Talisman, one crushes the disease, and with upright qi, restores tranquility. This is called the Method for Saving the World and Subduing Pestilence.*\n\n**Laojun’s Pestilence-Dispelling Celestial Talisman**\n**Heavenly Master’s Pestilence-Expelling Talisman**\n\n**Laojun’s Merciful Talisman for Co-Sleeping Without Contagion**\n*The talisman’s form is fully revealed to sever pestilence and cut off plague.*\n\n**Talisman for Inducing Sweat to Clear Pathways**\n*See \"Heavenly Heart, Marrow, Jade Maid, and the □□ Precious Chapters of the Dao and Virtue,\" Fourth Scroll.*\n\n**Heavenly Master’s Great Petition to Sever Pestilence**\n*The opening and closing of the petition follow the standard form, though the invoked officials differ. Here, their ranks and titles are specifically listed below.*\n\nRespectfully petitioned for [Name], invoking the descent of:\n— One hundred twenty Star Lords, officials, and functionaries,\n— The Lord of the Ding Palace, charged with governance,\nto seize and capture the plague-spirits within the domain, severing and annihilating all those that seek to spread contagion.\n\nFurther invoked are:\n— Twelve Lords of the Nine Yi of the East,\n— Twelve Lords of the Eight Man of the South,\n— Twelve Lords of the Six Rong of the West,\n— Twelve Lords of the Five Di of the North,\n— Twelve Lords of the Three Qin of the Center,\nwith each of the Five Divisions commanding twelve hundred officers and three hundred thousand soldiers;\n— Twenty-four Generals of the Three Household Guardians for [Name]’s city and residence,\nalong with thirty million officers and soldiers.\n\nTogether, they shall respond to this petition, descending upon the land within the domain, the sealed precincts, and the four directions and eight quarters, to resist, strike, and defend with strict encampment and protection, capturing and executing all.\n\nFurther invoked are the local earth gods of the altars of soil and grain—all the rightful deities customarily worshipped and entreated by the people for blessings—to join the aforementioned celestial officials and functionaries in unified effort, combining forces to guard and prepare, seizing and suppressing the plague-spirits that seek to harm the people of Heaven.\n\nAbove, the Celestial Net is unfurled to intercept and cover the flying malevolent spirits that bring affliction.\nBelow, the Earthly Snare is laid to permeate and purify the springs, sources, rivers, and waterways, as well as the hidden paths and concealed dens where harm is wrought upon humanity.\n\nAll shall be captured and driven out to the realm of the Underworld’s judgment.\nThe Yellow Slaves and Seven Sons, the Yearly Lords of Disease, the Five Pestilential Spirits of the Five Directions—all shall be shattered, crushed, and scattered to the winds a myriad leagues away, forbidden from lurking in secret to spread poison and wrongfully harm the good people.\n\nThus shall the nation’s borders be at peace, serving as proof of efficacy.\n*[The petition concludes in the standard form.]*\n**Method of the Petition**\n\nThe Master says: Those who have not yet studied the arts cannot ascend in spirit to present themselves before the Emperor, for their mortal forms remain unrefined, their primordial spirits yoked to yin, and thus unable to ascend. They must first engage in visualization to seek communion.\n\nBegin by summoning forth the divine officers and generals, pacing the *gang* in accordance with the method—its steps are recorded in the *Gang* Canon. First, visualize the *qi* of the five viscera, transforming it into the true essence of the Five Phases. Then assemble the jade chariot’s ritual procession, with banners of the sun and moon, within the lower Sea of *Qi*. Mounting a single strand of white *qi*, ascend alongside the officers and functionaries from the western pillar of Mount Kunlun, reaching the realm of the *Gang* Winds, the domain of the sun, moon, and stars. Do not yet ascend further; first pace the *gang* to break through the *Gang* Winds—its steps are found in the *Gang* Canon.\n\nEmerging from the *Gang* Winds, enter the Desire Realm. Tread upon the Nine Spirits to ascend into the Form Realm. Within both the Desire and Form Realms, all appears as the grandeur of earthly officials and wealthy households, yet no structures or traces of buildings are visible—one must perceive this with the heart and awaken to it inwardly. In the Form Realm, the Five Colors surge and billow, *qi* congealing into palaces, though these bear no resemblance to earthly architecture.\n\nNext, pace the *gang* of the Three Realms in their subtle state to reach the Formless Realm. Here, one sees only golden light filling the space before them, with no sound or form to be heard. Beyond lies the realm of the Seed People, a domain of emptiness and Brahmanic *qi*. Riding this Brahmanic *qi*, ascend to the Great Clarity, where vast golden light radiates in all directions—soundless, formless. Within this golden light, the ancestral master appears to bestow the petition.\n\nIn an instant, the light parts, and the sage sits within a white radiance, though no words are spoken. Then present this plea: *\"The celestial light dazzles me; my mortal nature cannot ascend further. I humbly beseech you to manifest in accordance with the private intentions of lesser practitioners, that I may receive the imperial decree.\"* At once, the white light transforms into a chamber—roofless, without beams or tiles, stepless, without stairs or platforms—seeming both present and absent, existent and non-existent. Entering this hall is called \"ascending the hall.\" The appearance of red light is an auspicious omen.\n\nNext, the Jade Hall remains unseen, and as before, golden light fills the space ahead. Following the path of heaven, descend and return to the altar. There, command the summoned officers and generals to capture the pestilential spirits, and so forth.\n\nI, by the Emperor’s decree, assist in the transformations of heaven, aiding the state and saving the people. Now, in the domain of [so-and-so], pestilence spreads unchecked, and peace has not been restored. I have ascended in spirit to the Jade Palace, reverently received the imperial decree, and come to this place. Hearken with utmost sincerity:\n\nThe decree resounds: *Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*\n\nThe assembled deities bow their heads in reverence; evil demons return to rightness. Should any dare act with malice, they shall be reduced to dust. Hasten, hasten—upon receipt of this decree, act without delay.\n\nThe proclamation complete, you must swiftly obey the imperial command: expel the poisonous *qi* with all haste, driving it from this barren land. Should any disobey, they shall be bound by the *Ghost Statutes of the Yongshou Era*, and the pestilence-expelling talismans shall be burned to banish them beyond the four seas. Proceed as prescribed.\n\n**Lao Jun’s Talisman for Pacifying the Household and Warding Off Pestilence**\n*East, South, West, North, Upon the Bed, Above the Hearth, Rear-Facing Chamber*\n\nFor each talisman, recite this incantation and inscribe the Three Lights as prescribed:\n*\"I entrust myself to the midst of the Three Lights, within the Dipper’s bowl. A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits become my servants; all perverse essences under heaven submit and perish. Swiftly, swiftly—seize, transform, heal, heal! As urgent as an oral command.\"*\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s Mudra and the *Qi* of the Three Lights**\n\n**Method for Treating Consumptive Wasting**\nThe master says: Consumptive wasting arises when the heart is afflicted, causing *qi* to congeal and blood to stagnate. That it manifests as worms is due to wine and lust, immoderate diet, sorrow and joy, grief and chaos—all gradually leading to this state.\n\nWhen worms form, it is because blood has congealed and *qi* has taken advantage. The *qi* that nourishes blood, when in the womb, is upright *qi*; when in the center, it forms accumulations; when it congeals in the heart’s domain, it becomes worms—all stemming from a heart not kept upright, and the karmic conditions of worry and thought.\n\nThe harm caused by the Three Corpses and Nine Worms must be understood in detail. Among the Nine Worms, six are transmitted across six generations, while three are not—such as the stomach’s *cunbai* worm. Some arise from toxins concentrated in the five viscera, or from habitual exposure within a family.\n\nAt the onset of transmission, one feels spirit and energy unsettled, no longer under one’s control, with vexation in the five centers, night sweats from the heart and kidneys, and palpitations. After ten days, the bones suddenly waste away, the face takes on a lustrous sheen, and the symptoms are confirmed.\n\nThe six worms, roughly every ten days, traverse the four limbs in cycles. The disease’s course depends on the *qi*’s generation: after the Beginning of Spring, they begin feeding, consuming for three days, then retreating for five. When they act, the body feels their bite; when they retreat, they return to their lair, drunk and dormant for five days, during which the illness temporarily subsides.\n\nOnly during their drunken retreat may talismans and medicines be administered; otherwise, the worms resist the power of the remedies, and the condition becomes untreatable.\n\nA single worm occupies twelve limbs; six worms occupy seventy-two. In a month’s time: the first ten days, from the heart to the head, they roam the four limbs; the next ten, from the heart to the navel, they roam the four limbs; the last ten, from the navel to the feet, they roam the four limbs. When administering medicine or moxibustion, this must be carefully considered.\n\nThe master further says: To treat consumptive wasting, one must first understand the movement of toxic *qi* and upright *qi*. When congealed in the viscera, they form worms—male if encountered on a yang day, female on a yin day.\n\nThey first consume human fat, appearing white. Once the five viscera and six bowels are damaged, the skin wrinkles and hair falls out; in women, the blood ceases to flow. When the blood vessels are all harmed, they cannot nourish the five viscera and six bowels.\n\nAfter seventy days, they consume human flesh and blood, turning yellow-red, damaging the muscles—hence emaciation, weakness, and inability to eat. The skin and sinews slacken, unable to contract.\n\nAfter two hundred ten days, when flesh and blood are exhausted, they consume the marrow, turning black. When the marrow is eaten, the bones wither, and the patient cannot rise from bed.\n\nLong-standing worms grow hair, their colors motley. They absorb the *qi* of the five viscera and five phases, and after being transmitted to three people, they mature, taking the form of birds. If they enter the kidney meridian, the condition becomes incurable.\n\nThe methods recorded here serve to instruct future generations. Thus, the classics say: If treated within sixty days, seven or eight out of ten may recover.\n\nWithin one hundred eighty days, if treated, three or four out of ten may recover; beyond this point, survival is rare. Here, the methods transmitted through six generations are recorded with care.\n\n**First Generation:** Refers to the onset of illness, marked by sudden and unusual sensations. The worms resemble infants, all covered in long hair, or take the form of ghosts, or toads—varying in size. They disturb the patient’s soul and dreams, inverting day and night, scattering the *hun* and *po* spirits, dispersing vitality. Appetite wanes, the body aches, and such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *bing*-*ding* days, targeting the heart during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Second Generation:** Refers to the transmission of consumptive phlegm. The worms resemble tangled silk, about three *cun* long, or house lizards, centipedes, or shrimp. They induce a perpetual stupor, visions of the deceased at night, and joyful yet spirit-draining dreams. The chest feels full and oppressed, weakness and confusion deepen, and spontaneous sweating with fever arises. Such symptoms appear. The worms become active on *geng*-*xin* days, targeting the lungs during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Third Generation:** Refers to the patient’s awareness of the illness, compounded by sorrow, allowing the *qi* to grow and reach the original viscera. As the heart stirs, *qi* descends; sorrow pertains to the kidney meridian. The worms resemble ant or mosquito larvae, clotted blood fragments, turtles, cicada shells, or dragonflies. They cause the *sanjiao* to grow clouded, inducing constant drowsiness, vomiting of bitter fluid, clear water, or sticky phlegm. Sores appear in the mouth and nose, lips blacken, the face turns ashen, the spirit wanders, the voice grows hoarse and dry, oily sweat flows, and the eyes dim with excessive tears. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *gengyin* days, targeting the *jueyin* during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Fourth Generation:** Refers to the worms having ravaged the lungs and depleted the heart, shifting to the spleen. The worms resemble tangled silk, lung tissue, or snakes. They cause phlegm accumulations in the intestines, alternating chills and fever, abdominal distension with visible veins, a faint wheezing cough that cannot cease, belching, bitter taste, or cravings for unusual foods. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *wu*-*ji* days, targeting the spleen during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Fifth Generation:** Refers to the patient’s illness worsening with anger and advancing *qi*. The worms resemble mice, or small jars—unformed and without clear boundaries—some with heads but no feet, others with feet but no heads, or resembling fragments of seminal essence. The three worms enter the lung meridian and settle in the kidneys, transforming upon encountering blood. The condition becomes unbearable, leaving the patient utterly debilitated, limbs slack, and incapable of any exertion. Some retain a ruddy complexion as in health, while others gain foresight, speaking of future events. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *guiwei* days, targeting the liver during sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Sixth Generation:** The worms may resemble horses with two tails, said to be male and female, or turtles, rotting silk, varying in length, or flying creatures with complete wings and feet, capable of transmitting *zhu* over a thousand *li*. *Zhu* refers to the so-called \"flying corpse.\" This is no ordinary affliction; the method must be applied with discernment.\n\n**Seals for Instruction:**\n- *Seal of the Master’s Personal Verification to Eliminate Corpse-Worms*\n- *Seal for Inquiring into Consumption*\n- *Seal Matching the Form*\n\n**Matching the Form**\n\nThe *Three Luminaries’ Fundamental Method* prescribes the structure for crafting talismans in *Matching the Form*. When preparing to administer a talisman to extract worms, first employ the *Talisman for Calming the Spirit and Securing Qi*, recite the *Incantation to Command the Essence-Soul*, and thereby stabilize the patient’s qi.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*Three Corpses bring calamity,*\n*Nine Worms wreak havoc.*\n*They devour the five viscera,*\n*Flee to the bladder.*\n*Be they crimson or white,*\n*Azure or yellow,*\n*Swallow this talisman into the belly,*\n*Scour the stomach, purge the intestines.*\n*Uphold against the hundred ailments,*\n*Strengthen bones and joints.*\n*Triple Burner, Four Seas,*\n*Five viscera, six bowels—*\n*At the talisman’s arrival, gather and harvest,*\n*Dare they not perish?*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nNext, form the *Dipper Mudra* and recite the *Incantation of Heaven Round and Earth Square*, visualizing the *Six Ding Spirits*, *Three Generals*, *Twenty-Eight Constellations*, and *Eleven Luminaries* within the talisman brush. Then inscribe the talisman, envisioning flames issuing from the brush. Upon completion, deliver it to the patient to consume with peach broth.\n\nFirst, invoke:\n*Most High Lord Lao,*\n*Teach me to slay demons.*\n*Grant me divine formulas,*\n*Instruct me to save the world,*\n*Attach and extinguish disasters.*\n*Inscribe talismans to cure illness,*\n*Transmitting light across ten thousand li.*\n*Spirits and gods submit,*\n*Beings and people find peace.*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nThen recite:\n*Shatter their form,*\n*Recall the soul to the body,*\n*Seven po settle in tranquility.*\n*Guard the body, dispel illness,*\n*Forever preserve longevity.*\n*All spirits, awe-inspired,*\n*At this command, obey and act.*\n\n**Method for Discerning Treatable and Untreatable Cases**\nThe Master states: In cases of *corpse-transmission*, some are treatable, while others, where the disease has deeply advanced, the malevolent worms seize the true qi, the patient falls silent in self-seclusion, blood and qi are exhausted, are beyond remedy. To test this, take a bowl of water, silently draw in the patient’s *natal star qi*, recite the *Heavenly Peng Incantation*, and blow into the water, visualizing the natal star. Grasp the *Heavenly Peng Seal and Incantation*, point at the water, and envision yourself as the Heavenly Peng. Have the patient gaze into the water—if black qi appears, it is a demonic affliction. If they refuse to look or demand the water to inspect themselves, the case is untreatable.\n\nFurther verification lies in the brows’ markings, which foretell life or death. If the brow’s roots are dark or black, the eyes often gaze upward, and upon turning, black lines appear between the brows with qi like threads; if the brow’s corners bear azure qi, the brows are largely fallen, the brows are low while the brow’s roots are high, or hidden qi stirs restlessly between the brows, or the skin twitches intermittently—all such signs are untreatable.\n\nThis method is difficult to convey in writing or speech; it resides in the heart’s comprehension. Those who can pivot and adapt may grasp it through insight.\n\nTo identify worms when their color and qi remain unclear, employ the *Inquiry Talisman*. Craft the talisman according to the lunar phase, grinding cinnabar in alignment with the month’s stem, and inscribe it accordingly. Have the patient swallow it with frankincense broth. After the time it takes to eat a meal, have them hold frankincense up to the sun, shielding their eyes with their hands. If hair emerges from all ten fingertips, the disease is severe; if it appears from the middle fingers, the affliction runs deep. White hair indicates treatability, while yellow or red suggests difficulty. Absence of hair or sparse hair signifies no worms.\n\n**Sequence for Pursuing Worms**\nFor those in the initial stages of transmission, when pursuing worms, one must first submit a memorial to the Supreme Emperor, the City God of Mount Tai, the local earth deities, and the officers and soldiers of the community, as well as the spirits of the deceased, before proceeding. Masters who have ascended in rank and entered the hall may act at will without hesitation.\n\nFirst, have the patient swallow the *Three Luminaries Talisman* to weaken the malevolent qi. Then administer the talisman—none will fail to strike true. As evening approaches, have the patient consume the talisman and sit in their natal position (e.g., those born in the *zi* hour sit in the *zi* position), envisioning the Dipper’s light enveloping them. During the quiet of night, ensure lamps burn brightly before and behind, and prepare a wok of boiling oil. Do not allow the patient to leave, nor engage in conversation; only three to five people should keep watch. Soon, the patient may seem to dream of ghostly entities taking leave—ask their names. The worms may emerge from the patient’s body, clothing, or seat. Their forms vary; any creature with a discernible shape should be swiftly seized and cast into the boiling oil. Once fried, discard both the worms and the vessel into a flowing river, and depart without looking back.\n\n**Incantation to the Patient While Administering Talisman**\n*Nine Heavens’ Emperor,*\n*Four Numinous Ones, Eight Gates.*\n*Seven Governors, Two Mysteries,*\n*Three Primes, Nine Essences.*\n*Great Unity, Peach and Health,*\n*Ascend to the Three Clarities.*\n*Petition the Imperial Lord,*\n*Seize the Yellow Tranquility’s mandate.*\n*Swiftly summon the seven po,*\n*Subdue them in the divine court.*\n*Should any inauspiciousness remain,*\n*Seven Star Divine Soldiers.*\n*Call upon the true numina,*\n*Refine the turbid, temper the form.*\n*Great spirits, strike and expel,*\n*Sever and banish the malevolent essence.*\n*Three spirits harmonize in peace,*\n*Blood-corpses sink and scatter.*\n*Spirits return to the Crimson Abode,*\n*Turn toward propitious purity.*\n*Grant me immortality,*\n*Preserve my kalpic years.*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nNext, summon the *Three Corpses*: *Peng Shan*, *Peng Zhi*, and *Peng Jiao*, transforming them with the talisman into outer immortals.\n\nRecite again:\n*Platform Light,*\n*Hidden Essence,*\n*Luminous Spirit.*\n\nAnd again:\n*Corpse-Dogs crouch in excrement,*\n*Sparrow Shadows swallow thieves.*\n*Non-poison dispels filth,*\n*Fetid lungs, seven delusions.*\n*Open the gate of goodness,*\n*Seal the gate of evil.*\n*Ascend to the Immortal Capital,*\n*Together cultivate the seven virtues.*\n\n**Method for Hastening Birth and Resolving Childbirth Calamities**\nThe Master states: The mother receives the embryo through love and desire; the child takes form through karmic affinity. Without the mother, the child cannot be born; without the father, the mother cannot bestow life; without the child’s attachment to love and karma, it cannot acquire a body. Thus, causes and conditions give rise to karmic fruits and retributions.\n\nThe method for childbirth does not originate from the act of delivery. The child and mother unite qi to nurture form, and when the time comes to separate and be born, if the wind of past affections remains unsevered or the vitality of the destined birth is unknown, birth cannot occur.\n\nTherefore, if the child and mother come through affection, the child is born easily, grows swiftly, and becomes intelligent. They attain wealth and nobility without toil, bringing honor to their parents. But if the child and mother come through enmity, there may be calamities of transverse or breech birth, or even the sorrow of stillbirth.\n\nNext, if the child fails to grow to maturity, they may bring peril and distress to their kin—all of which arises from the excesses of *chongqian*. For those most afflicted by such transgressions, I now establish methods of salvation and remedy to safeguard life within the womb.\n\nFirst, to protect the fetus and preserve vitality; then, to hasten delivery; and finally, to expedite birth—all follow a proper sequence. After birth, to ensure the child’s healthy growth, there are talismans to calm the heart, seals to secure the windows, methods to stimulate the appetite, soothe the soul, and treat fright—all detailed below, offered as benevolent remedies for the world.\n\n**Talisman for Protecting the Fetus**\nThe Master says: When the fetal *qi* is weak or deficient, employ the **Three Lights Talisman**, prepared according to its prescribed method, to supplement and invigorate the generative *qi*.\n\n**Talisman and Incantation for Safeguarding Life**\n*\"Preserve the spirit, pacify and secure,\nGuard my bodily form.\nThe Spirit Lords of the Five Viscera,\nEach ensure peace and tranquility.\"*\n\nDraw the talisman by dipping the brush in *qi* of the Three Lights. First make the Dipper Mudra, then the Sun Deity Mudra, and again the Dipper Mudra before completing the talisman. Administer this during the first or second month of pregnancy.\n\n**Talisman for Hastening Birth**\n*(Form combined)*\nInscribe this talisman with the *qi* of the dominant phase of the current month. Administer during the sixth or seventh month of pregnancy.\n\n**Talisman for Expediting Birth**\n*(Form combined)*\n\n**Additional Talismans**\n\n**Combined-Form Talisman for Soothing Infant Fright and Crying**\n*(Form combined)*\n\n**Cinnabar Lock Fontanel Talisman**\n*(Form combined)*\n\n*Incantation:*\n*\"O Blazing Spirits, O Blazing Spirits,\nFire Bells, Fire Bells!\nAbove, you ascend to the Purple Palace;\nBelow, you penetrate the nether darkness.\nSevering demonic fiends and baleful ghosts,\nNone dare defy your command.\nFire Bell Lords, Fire Bell Lords,\nHasten! As the statutes decree!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Soothing Infant Fright**\nTake a segment of kindling wood, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper, and affix it to the door of the child’s chamber. Infuse with the *qi* of the Three Lights.\n\n---\n**Volume 24 of the *Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and Jade Hall Great Method* Concludes**\n**Volume 25 of the *Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and Jade Hall Great Method*: The Chapter on Preserving and Controlling the Kalpic Turns**\n\nThe Master said: The Great Dao generates the Prenatal; the Prenatal generates the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases divide into the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams divide into the Nine Palaces. All arise from the mutual generation and conquest of the Five Phases, through which form and *qi* are conceived and nurtured.\n\nThus, Heaven holds the yang above, and the Three Luminaries shine forth. Earth holds the yin below, and the Five Peaks stand in majesty. Humanity receives the numinous within, and the myriad transformations are complete—thereby establishing the Three Powers and setting the axis of the cosmos.\n\nYet where there is destiny, there is turn; where there is form, there is kalpa. Inevitably, the kalpa brings calamity, for the Five Phases never cease, and the cycles of generation and destruction, mutual conquest and harm, follow in their wake.\n\nHeaven’s body is pure and void, serene and without trace, enduring myriad kalpas without decay. Earth’s mass is heavy and turbid, ever subject to change. The stars’ benevolence or malevolence cannot escape their contrary courses. When water and fire clash, floods arise. When metal and wood contend, strife ensues. The wind-wheel sustains the earth; the water-*qi* floats the heavens. The Four Great Elements harmonize, and the Five Phases restrain one another. Should any deviate, omens of fortune or misfortune arise, causing Heaven to alter its form above, Earth to shift its form below, stars to entangle, floods and droughts to vie, and warfare to erupt in season.\n\nSuch are the destinies, such are the calamities. Therefore, our Great Peace Teaching spreads its teachings below. To preserve Heaven’s enduring existence, one must first preserve and control the kalpic turns. This chapter is established to weave the warp of Heaven and the weft of Earth, safeguarding the state and pacifying the household, delivering people from the disasters of the *yang*-nine, and ushering them into the era of Great Peace—how auspicious!\n\n**Method for Dispelling Comets and Invoking Blessings**\n\nThe Master said: This talisman is the pivotal essence of the Red Heaven’s star-subduing art. One must pace the repelling star *Ding*, visualize transforming into the Black Baleful True Lord, then proceed with the flying steps to sever and annihilate.\n\nBefore inscribing the talisman, recite the *Supreme Black Edict for Slaying Ghosts* and intone the talisman incantation:\n\n*Incantation:*\n*\"Om Hum Hum! All spirits bow their heads;\nDemons and deviants return to rectitude.\nShould any dare act perversely,\nLet them be reduced to dust.\nHasten! Upon receipt of this edict, act accordingly.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Pacing the *Ding***\n*\"I am the Great One True Lord of the Grotto,\nHead crowned with the Seven Stars, pacing the Four Wheels.\nGrasping the Dragon Sword, I stand in the *Xun* position,\nThen traverse *Li* until reaching *Kun*.\nAt *Zhen*, *Dui*, and *Gen*, I seal the boundaries—\nNo demonic vapors may lurk within.\nWith Yu’s steps and the *Kui Ding* facing *Qian* and *Hai*,\nI approach the Celestial Gate to pay homage to the Emperor.\nAgain, I ride the five-colored ascending clouds,\nMy true form wrathful, shaking the Gate of Heaven.\nEntering the Azure Palace, I fill with generative *qi*,\nThen mount the Azure Dragon into *Bing* and *Ding*.\nThe great radiance of the Red Heaven flames through the Three Realms;\nThe pure essence of baleful *qi* arrays its blades.\nReturning to the *Zhen* position in *Qian*,\nI tread the Seven Stars to extinguish the monstrous star.\nWith one celestial talisman, the baleful star retreats;\nWith one celestial halberd, Heaven and Earth are cleansed.\nReturning, I report my merit to the Sagely Lord.\nOm Ma! Summon the heavenly demons!\nHum Hum! Comply with the Emperor’s command!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Summoning the Black Baleful True Form**\n\n*Edict Incantation:*\n*\"Dark Heaven of the North, profound and distant Spirit Lords,\nUtterly shatter the demonic hosts!\nAll baleful stars and malevolent specters,\nBe seized and delivered beneath the Dipper’s *Kui* to meet your death!\nOm Hum Hum! All spirits bow their heads.\nHasten! Act accordingly!\"*\n\n**Method of Practice**\nThe Master said: When a comet or any baleful star appears as an omen, one should bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Stars* to beseech peace. Next, submit a petition to the Northern Culmen Great Emperor, entreating the suppression of the baleful star. Then, establish an altar and set up a ritual feast, lighting lamps for the Eleven Luminaries and the Northern and Southern Dippers. At dawn, present a memorial, and summon the Black Baleful Great Spirit—who is the Sagely One of the New Moon. The practice must be executed with utmost sincerity.\n\nAfter the morning audience, recite the *Jade Purity Scripture for Dispelling Disasters and Subduing Demons*. At noon, bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Stars*, visualizing its application in tandem with the *Prayer for Severing Pestilence*. After the audience, recite the *Scripture on Salvation*. At dusk, pace the *Ding*, visualizing the Variegated Sage patrolling the eight directions to execute the punitive method.\n\nFor dispelling, both sides remain unharmed, each secure in its place. For conquest, one side must face peril—for this is not the transformative benevolence of the Supreme. Those who inherit this teaching must comprehend this truth.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Fire Disasters**\n\nThe Master said: Among the Five Phases and Four Great Elements, water and fire are without sentiment. To control fire, first mobilize the virtue of water. Establish an altar and set up a ritual feast according to the prescribed form:\n\nAt dawn, pace the *Ding* of Water Virtue and issue the Water Star talisman command. Hang the banner of the Water Virtue Mysterious Standard. The Daoist assembly recites the *Supreme Yin Dark and Abysmal Incantation*.\n\nAt noon, display the *Mysterious Talisman for Suppressing Fire* and the *Talisman for Extinguishing the Might of the Fire Spirit*.\n\nAt dusk, bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Fire*, then distribute and affix the talismans.\n\n**Water Star Command for Controlling Fire**\n\n**Supreme Yin Dark Incantation**\n*\"Supreme Yin, Dark and Abysmal,\nEssence of the singular *qi*.\nPure yin coalesces and transforms,\nThe radiance of yang extinguished in form.\nBlack *qi* fills the vast expanse;\nRed light returns to yin.\nWithin it dwells a spirit,\nBlack-bodied, in the Water Court.\nAble to extinguish the fire’s ugliness,\nThe Prenatal Lord.\nThe abyssal springs churn waves,\n*Jia Shen* manifests its brightness.\nRoaring and howling, vast and mighty,\nDragons shriek, sand spirits tremble.\nThe four seas surge in waves,\nThe *Tu Bo Yi Zhen* arise.\nHeavenly fire’s flames cease,\nThe Emperor commands the weary spirits.\nA thousand eyes scatter water;\nPoisoned lips unite in terror.\nHasten!

As the statutes of the Dark Waters of the North decree.*\n\n**Method for Exorcising Earthquakes**\n\nThe scriptures state: *Heaven moves while earth remains still.*\nFor heaven revolves above and earth rests below—this is the constant principle of Yin and Yang.\nIf earth assumes the movement of heaven and trembles, it is because Yin and Yang have lost their order.\nThis method should be employed to exorcise such calamities.\n\n**Procedure for Conducting the Ritual:**\nFirst, construct an altar and set up a sacrifice to the Ninefold August Lords.\nUse a shared altar for the Three Realms.\nAs prescribed: At dawn, present the Jade Tablet for Pacifying the Spirits and burn it in the southwest.\nPrepare records for each officiant, and have the Daoist assembly recite the *Vermilion Script of Jade Characters*.\nAt noon, recite the *Vermilion Script of Jade Characters* again, and bury the Jade Tablet for Suppressing *Kun* in the earth.\nConclude by prostrating before the *Chapter on Earthquakes* and dispersing the altar.\n\n**Great Register for Pacifying and Suppressing the Southwest**\n**The Five Marchmounts Suppress the Southwest**\n\nInscribe this talisman on a tablet and bury it to suppress the earth of *Kun*.\n\n**Purple-Written Jade Register of the Nine August Ones for Suppressing *Kun***\nAlso called the *Jade Tablet for Pacifying Kun*, identical to the *Vermilion Script of Jade Characters*.\n\n*Xu Lou* rests in the *Wei*,\nThe marvel of *A Luo*.\nExtending from the Mystic Capital,\nSpreading the crystalline sounds of dawn.\nSilent emptiness, profound and dark,\nLush and flourishing, the radiance of the primordial.\nThe luminous light of *Fan*, the numinous truth,\nThe Nine Heavens’ *Kun* origin.\nCountless kalpas of dust,\nPrimordial splendor illumines the void.\n*Po Na* □□,\nDragons, *Luo*, ghosts, and spirits.\nThe great Brahmanic radiance,\nThe central yellow’s primordial effulgence.\nDwelling in the floating abode, the blade’s suppression,\nCelestial assembly of supervising immortals.\n\n**Method for Exorcising Solar Eclipses**\n\nThe master says: *The sun is the symbol of the ruler and also the symbol of the Middle Kingdom.*\nWhen the Great Yang is at its zenith, it illuminates the lands below,\nCausing all under heaven to turn like sunflowers and bow like grass, revering the celestial light.\nIf the sun is eclipsed, it signifies the loss of virtue in Yang’s radiance, resulting in disaster and misfortune.\nThis method should be employed to suppress and exorcise, praying for blessings and protection.\n\n**Altar Construction as Prescribed:**\nAt dawn, present the *Talisman for the Nine Dragons of Yang Valley to Generate Light* and recite the incantation.\nAt noon, prostrate again before the *Chapter for Exorcising Solar Eclipses*.\nAt dusk, recite the *Hidden Taboo of the Cinnabar Heaven’s True Fire* as prescribed.\n\n**Talisman for the Nine Dragons of Yang Valley to Generate Light**\n\nNaked and barefoot, swiftly tread upon the Gate of Heaven.\nDrumming and blowing the Yin’s poison,\nAdvancing to invade the Southern Yang.\nThe Nine Dragons soar upon clouds,\nThe Red Phoenix soars on high.\nIn an instant, the heavens clear,\nThe great thousand worlds radiate brilliance.\nYin demons and malevolent spirits,\nVanish without a trace to other realms.\n\n*Om, Wheel of the Sun Spirit, celestial light pervades Yang.*\n\n*Hasten! As the imperial decree commands.*\n\nInscribe the preceding talisman in vermilion on yellow paper. The subsequent proclamation is placed in a square box, titled as prescribed: *Proclaimed to the Palace of the Nine Yangs.*\n\n**Hidden Taboo of the Cinnabar Heaven’s True Fire**\n\nResplendent and radiant, blazing and flaming,\nGlowing and scorching, fiery and fierce.\n\n**Radiant Blaze of the True Fire**\n\nBlazing and blazing, scorching and burning,\nFlickering and flaming, searing and fierce.\nGlowing and gleaming, bright and resplendent,\nBlazing and blazing, roaring with flame.\n*Om, crystalline offering to the Sun Spirit, [ ]-tā, seize!*\n\n**Ritual for Dispelling Locust Plagues**\n\nThe master says: The calamity of locusts arises when winter snow fails to fall, and yin breeds monstrosities. Borne by the fire of the southern direction, they sprout wings and become insects, thus able to devour seedlings and ruin crops. For the seeds of these pests lie everywhere. A single encounter with the qi of snow drives them three *chi* into the earth. Within one year, three encounters with snow’s qi bury them nine *chi* deep. In two years, two *zhang*. But if snow fails for a year, they emerge three *chi* from the ground. Should snow remain absent for three consecutive years, the accumulated plague of locusts will manifest.\n\nThe method of suppression and exorcism: Erect an altar and set up the offering ritual as prescribed. At dawn, dispatch a memorial to the Spirit Who Captures Locusts. Next, memorialize the City God and the Earth God, commanding them to summon winds to blow the locusts into clusters. The talisman leads the way. At noon, perform the memorial ritual as prescribed. At dusk, recite the incantation according to the method.\n\n**Southern Vermilion Phoenix, Flame Clouds.**\n\n**Ritual for Dispelling Drought**\n\nThe master says: When prolonged drought persists despite prayers, only those who approach with utmost sincerity, having widely aroused boundless compassion and received petitions for rain, may inscribe and employ the talisman. First, submit memorials to the Three Heavenly Gates, to the Heavenly Master’s court, and file reports to the Three Officials, the River and Sea Bureaus, the Tai Mountain Prefecture, the Dragon Lords of the Four Waterways and Five Lakes, the Immortals of the Grotto-Heavens of Famous Mountains, the Wind Earl and Rain Master, and the Earth God. Only then proceed with pacing the altar and reciting the incantation. Perform the three-day ritual upon the altar as prescribed. If rain falls sufficiently, do not cast the talisman further. If insufficient, next employ an iron plaque, one *chi* and two *cun* in length, two *cun* and four *fen* in width, inscribed with the seal-script as prescribed:\n\n**Tai Shang Talisman for Driving Rain**\n**Iron Charter for Overturning the Sea to Bring Rain**\n\nUse an iron charter, two *cun* and four *fen* in width, two *chi* and four *cun* in length, inscribed in vermilion. Seal it in a lined pouch and cast it into the dragon’s grotto. Once rain has fallen sufficiently, retrieve it as before. Perform the three-day ritual upon the altar and issue the oral decree.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao resides upon the ninefold heavens, amidst ten thousand layers of dense clouds, riding a qilin with a decree. He commands the Great Perfected King Qiao Ma Yi of the lower realm and the Dragon King to dispatch the lunar-attendant, solar-attendant, and hourly-attendant dragon officials to bring forth rain. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Later Sage Lord Lao.\n\nThis oral decree issues from the golden mouth of the Most High. When establishing the altar, position the Four Attendant Deities at the four corners:\n- **Southwest:** Fire Radiance Flowing Essence Lord\n- **Southeast:** Jade Thunder Luminous Master Lord\n- **Northwest:** Void Essence Great Hua Lord\n- **Northeast:** Cavern Yang Mysterious Spirit Lord\n\nThese four deities are the essence of Heavenly Unity and the ancestors of the dragon spirits.\n\n**Incantation:**\nProtect the Luminous Consort, Pure Flower Gold,\nCelestial Heroes, Dipper Stalwarts, Mysterious Spirits.\nThe Primordial Lady of Grand Unity commands the water troops,\nPenglai Envoys, Masters of the Water Court.\nWeak Waters gleam clear without the slightest turbidity,\nGoverning seas and rivers, overturning the Four Seas.\nThe Four Dark Deities, essence of Heavenly Unity,\nThe Great Yang conducts water through the Nine Trenches.\nWithin lies the Cavern Yang Mysterious Spirit,\nJade Thunder’s Luminous Master swiftly raises his voice.\nMighty rides the Great Hua Celestial Steed,\nFlowing Essence and Jade Radiance rush to the Fire Bell.\nBlack clouds billow as the sea’s *qi* ascends,\nPouring down upon the hundred rivers, rain like cords.\nA span of moisture swells to fullness,\nThe Rain Master and his retinue array the stellar ranks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.\n\nAfter performing the three-period ritual upon the altar, sprinkle water. Cast the iron-plaque talisman and pace the *gang*.\n\n**Method for Dispersing Water to Pray for Clear Skies**\nThe master says: The method for praying for clear skies involves establishing an altar and setting up the offering as usual, but before the cavern table, position the Radiant Emperor of Solar Light and the Great Wind Earl. Proceed as in the rain-praying ritual, reciting the incantation for three days. At dawn, dispatch the talisman and command; at noon, hasten the clearing.\n\n**Solar Fire Transport Talisman**\nInscribe this talisman in vermilion on red paper and submit it with the preceding petition. Use this talisman as well.\n\n**Three-Period Ritual Oral Decree**\nThe Most High Lord Lao, by his golden mouth, decrees: Today, at such-and-such an hour, may heaven be clear and earth pristine, the sun and moon illuminate their paths. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Later Sage Lord Lao.\n\n**Solar Fire Transport Incantation**\nAt midday, fire radiance, celestial yang essence,\nGreat brightness shines resplendent, golden light and fire glow.\nAt midday, Great Hua’s High Yang Brightness,\nDipper Stalwarts assist the Celestial Primordial Court.\nJade Splendor, Great Treasure, Primordial Guest,\nFierce beasts, celestial dragons, Mars the Sparkling Deluder.\nThe Primordial Lord of Grand Unity pacifies the Fire Radiance,\nThe Great Sage of Fire Radiance, Golden Youth Lord,\nThe Supreme Ultimate Great Emperor, Luminous Flowing Gold.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.\n\n**Three-Five Pacing the Gang Method**\nThe master says: Pacing the *gang* is the method for strengthening the body and activating *qi*, the formula for stabilizing the hun and subduing the po.\n\nThe \"three\" in \"three-five\" refers in the Dao to the Three *Qi*, in heaven to the Three Heavens, in radiance to the Three Lights, in spirits to the Three Primes, and in humans to the Three Hun. The \"five\" refers in the Dao to the Five Elders, in heaven to the Five Phases, in celestial bodies to the Five Stars, and in humans to the Five Viscera.\n\nThe ancestral master says: The Three *Qi* are the essence of the Three Lights, and the Three Lights are the masters of spirit and essence. The Five Phases are the ancestors of the Five Stars, and the Five Phases are the thieves that harm the body. Thus, if the practitioner can cultivate and ascend to perfection, they cause the Three Lights to return to the Three *Qi* and the Five Phases to return to the Five Powers. The Three Hun become the Three Lights, the Five Viscera become the Five *Qi*, the Five *Qi* return to the Three *Qi*, and the Three *Qi* merge into the One *Qi*, naturally attaining perfection. Hence, it is said: Humans thereby attain longevity. Those who cannot cultivate cause the Three Lights to become the Three Corpses, the Three Corpses to become the Three Paths; the Five *Qi* become the Five Phases, and the Five Phases become the Five Sufferings. These are the Eight Difficulties for humans—this is the meaning of \"three-five.\"\n\n*Gang* means \"guiding principle.\" Arranging the Dipper to pace is to pull the guiding principle and operate the mechanism, hence the name *gang*. It is also said: *Gang* is yang. The natural yang within pacing subdues yin demons, so the Dipper’s stars ride their light upon the Great Crimson Heaven, hence the name *gang*.\n\nThe Celestial Master of old said: The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. The Central Dipper’s nine stars transform into the Nine Spirit Pacings—this is called the Stellar *Gang*. Thus, one symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate, two symbolize heaven and earth, three symbolize the Three Lights, four symbolize the Four Seasons, five symbolize the Five Phases, six symbolize the Six Pitch Pipes, seven symbolize the Seven Stars, eight symbolize the Eight Trigrams, and nine symbolize the Nine Spirits.\n\nHowever, the Nine Spirits’ transmission has long been interrupted, and its formula lost. Thus, I now establish the diagram, taking the Nine Spirit Ancestral *Gang* as its head. This *gang* is the ancestor of pacing methods, the origin of Yu’s pacing, and by pacing it repeatedly, there is nothing it cannot accomplish. The so-called \"Huoluo Dipper\" of recent times traces its source to this.\n\nThe pacing method need not be overly complex; if the heart comprehends the Nine Stars, the feet tread the Nine Spirits, and the body embodies the Nine *Qi*, one will naturally attain mastery. Thus, the methods transmitted in the present age are mostly erroneous, and I now specially simplify and demonstrate the wondrous essence of non-complexity.\n\n**Prostrating to Submit Petitions and Breaking the Gang Pacing the Void Method**\n**Transcending the Three Realms Pacing the Void Gang Method**\n\n**The Daoist Gang of the Celestial Immortal Generals**\n**The Gang for Audience with Heaven and Memorial Submission**\n**The Gang for Subduing Demons and Quelling Spirits**\n**The Three Terraces Gang**\n\nThe above *gang* methods are all ancestral to the various arts. They involve pacing but no incantations; one holds the intention without clinging to the form. In the teachings of the Great Peace, the *Yu’s Pacing* was transmitted anew, becoming the *Gang for Regulating the Five Phases, Cultivating the Body, and Subduing Demons*.\n\n**The Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method’s Essential Principles Concludes**\n**The Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Invoking the True and Delivering from Calamity**\n\nThe Master said:\nTo *invoke the true* is to perform the *Dipper Memorial Rite*. The Dipper governs the throat and tongue of Heaven; all matters of human fortune and misfortune, prosperity and adversity, longevity and premature death, are determined by it. Thus, when Heaven sends down reprimands, when ghosts below lodge false accusations, when ancestral spirits summon litigation, or when the deceased implicate the living—any of these occurrences bring misfortune in their wake. The severity of the affliction corresponds to the gravity of the offense. Without practicing the urgent memorial method to effect resonance, even if one were to amass incense into mountains or burn offerings for generations, one could not achieve communion or response.\n\nThus, the adage states: *One’s nature is like fire; the method is like sulfur—touch them, and they ignite.* The same principle applies here. Though Dipper rites are numerous, the initial steps for beginners are not easily distinguished. With minds cluttered and intentions scattered, how can one attain clarity? Therefore, I now specially present the *Urgent Memorial Secret Petition* within this chapter. Perform it with sincerity, and the true will respond to Heaven.\n\nIn all matters of invoking the Dipper and beseeching the true, authority lies with the *Two Envoys of the Striking Bell*. These two deities are solely responsible for inspecting the purity of the ritual altar. If one is not devout, these spirits will report it, and the celestial perfected will not descend. They also oversee human fortune and misfortune, life and death, and are especially attended by the *Nine August Ladies, Inner Consorts, and Jade Maidens* who present the memorials. If these deities do not descend, the petitions will not reach their destination, and all ritual preparations will be in vain. Furthermore, the transmission of the memorial to the *Mysterious Bureau* to request the descent of gracious decrees is the purview of the *Four Direct Envoys, Nine August Celestial Officers, Embroidered-Robed Envoys, and Messengers of Communication*. If they do not descend, the true sincerity will not be conveyed; if the *Lifting Bell* does not descend, the Celestial Perfected will remain unaware, and all offerings of incense and flowers will be wasted, unable to elicit a response.\n\nMoreover, if the practitioner has violated taboos of impurity, consumed meat or pungent foods, harbored impure thoughts, or maintained an unclean body, even if the true scribes are summoned, they will not descend. The *Four Bureaus* will record the transgressions, and the resulting offenses will be immeasurable. Be cautious.\n\nWhen invoking the Dipper, one must not approach slaughterhouses, taverns, rowdy markets, or licentious chambers. The best locations are empty halls, grand temples, or official Daoist abbeys. Avoid disturbances and keep away from wailing. If monks, nuns, coffins, chickens, dogs, cats, or individuals in mourning attire (wearing white cloth) enter the altar space, the deities will neither descend nor respond.\n\nWhen the practitioner enters the state of *storing and circulating*, if one does not *summon the qi*, the true will not respond; if one does not *ingest the talisman*, the body will not become numinous; if one does not *concentrate on the deities*, the true will not descend. One must achieve the union of *qi* and spirit, the resonance of inner sincerity, so that the response is swift and luminous, as if engaging in conversation.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, there was a Minister of Waterworks named Zhang Shuo, who resided by the Xiao River. His nine-year-old son was unable to speak. Later, he prayed at the shrine of Zhang, the Waterworks Minister (who was also Zhang, the Judge of the Underworld), and offered sacrifices to the deity of Bian Mountain. Suddenly, the deity descended and spoke: *\"When your son was born, he offended the Dipper Bureau. You must urgently memorialize it.\"* The deity had once served the Dipper and possessed a secret method, which was extremely simple. He transmitted it to Zhang Shuo, who later rose to the position of Prime Minister. This secret method was buried atop the great peak of Juqu. Now that the Great Teaching is flourishing, this method has been revealed to the world. Practitioners should keep it confidential.\n\nTo first memorialize the Dipper, prepare four clean mats, seven plates woven from artemisia flowers (each the size of a small dish), seven cups of pure tea, seven bowls of jujube broth, seven oil cakes, seven offerings of fruit, seven incense burners, and seven lamps. Face north and make the offerings. The practitioner should advance on their knees, bowing seven times to each star, and secretly pray for the matter at hand. Submit the urgent memorial petition and burn it in the incense burner with a blazing fire.\n\nNext, the practitioner enters the chamber, visualizes, and bows nine times. Imagine the five viscera emitting five-colored *qi*, forming a golden bridge that connects to the celestial realm. Envision the seven palaces of the Dipper Bureau as jade halls with golden towers. After a long while, see the *Embroidered-Robed Envoy* leading you across the bridge. Gradually, you will perceive a path of purple clouds, where the *Nine August Officials* in vermilion robes with square collars and nine-tiered crowns guide you to ascend and enter the palace of your natal star to present your petition. You will see only golden light, too radiant to gaze upon directly. Once the petition is presented, if you see a red light, it signifies that your request has been granted. Return by the same path and enter the *Mysterious Gate*. After a long while, swallow your saliva, click your teeth, and withdraw.\n\n**Burning the Altar Talisman**\nBurn the talisman and recite the incantation, visualizing the first layer of the jade platform rising from the earth.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Clear and numinous, true qi sweeps away the miasma.*\n*Empty mystery’s true image: the first layer of the jade platform.*\n*Divine qi descends in response; we bow to the exalted ones.*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The Great Void is without form; the cloud paths are clear and level.*\n*The second layer of the jade altar forms as the heart desires.*\n*Demonic miasma is stilled; the human realm is at peace.*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*As the true light descends, the third layer of the jade platform appears.*\n*The empty mystery takes form: the gate of all wonders.*\n*Invite the immortals—they arrive; summon the sages—they attend.*\n*Sincerity moves the heart; the Dipper’s numen descends.*\n\nBurn the three flying talismans, visualizing the three-tiered jade altar rising, purple clouds ascending, and golden light in the void connecting to the Dipper’s extremity.\n\n**Next, burn the Demon-Quelling Talisman**\nWrite it in vermilion and send it flying. Recite the *Great Slaying Text*, sprinkle water to the four directions, and recite the incantation.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Supreme purity of the Dao, dispatching the celestial soldiers.*\n*Driving dragons and riding tigers, casting fire and ringing bells.*\n*Cloud paths are swept clean; demonic hordes are revealed.*\n*True fire strikes first; halberds and polearms punish behind.*\n*Dare any disobey? Sever their heads and annihilate their forms.*\n\nGhosts and demons fall silent; welcome the descent of the exalted perfected.\nBurn the Ascending Report Talisman and the Slaying Text, write in vermilion, and send two flying. Visualize *Vajra* descending, then ascending, then descending again, and bow twice.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The heavens’ qi is pure; it guards the adept’s flying spirit.*\n*What is prayed for is granted; the adept’s numen is made manifest.*\n*The two perfected ascend with the report, swiftly fulfilling the heart’s desire.*\n\nVisualize the High Perfected’s Descent-to-Earth Talisman.\nForm the Dipper mudra, send seven flying, all written in vermilion.\nThen burn the Urgent Petition.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The Jade Emperor bestows upon me the right to invoke the perfected.*\n*On this auspicious day, the incense of my heart ascends.*\n*The seven perfected descend, curing illness and expelling spirits.*\n*They bring blessings and dissolve calamities, granting peace and safety.*\n\n**The Master says:**\nWhen worldly people suffer from illness or hardship, they have no time to present formal memorials. Since matters are urgent, the method of the Urgent Petition is employed—simple and direct, seeking the perfected is sufficient.\nUse a sheet of light yellow paper, one foot and two inches long, six inches high. Write the adept’s title and position in detail, stating the matter clearly, in no more than one hundred characters, all in vermilion.\nWhen finished, fold it eight times, then four times, seal the corners, and inscribe only: *\"Your humble servant [Name] respectfully submits and seals.\"*\nDispatch the Dipper’s Direct-Service Merit Officer to transmit it in the fast.\nBurn it in a censer of blazing incense, ensuring thick smoke but no flame. While visualizing, bow, and once the smoke dissipates, close the altar.\n\n**Format for the Urgent Petition:**\nWrite according to the prescribed form, fold it, then fold it into four sections. Burn it in a censer of blazing incense, and a response will arrive immediately.\n\n*\"Your humble servant [Name], on behalf of [Person] of [Place], born on the [Year, Month, Day, Hour], now beseeches the Imperial Perfected for [Matter], to resolve grievances, harmonize fate, and swiftly dispel calamities, granting peace and safety.\nIn haste, I submit this urgent petition to the Jade Palace beneath the Northern Dipper’s [Star] Constellation, humbly imploring Your decree for immediate action. I await the response, prostrate before the altar.\"*\n\n**The Master says:**\nThis method is Zhang Shuibu’s *Urgent Petition to the Teapot Altar of the Dipper*, simple and ancient, neither cumbersome nor crude, with the swiftest response. It resembles the talismanic commands in the *Prohibitions Canon* but differs in minor ways.\nThe adept may adopt it without seeking excess. When the time is right, the *Prohibitions Canon* will ultimately be their proper guide.\n\nHere ends *The Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens: Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Twenty-Nine.\n*[Note: Previous scroll referenced is Twenty-Seven.]*\n\n**The Ascent and Descent of the Two Luminaries**\n\n**The Master says:**\nThe Jade Hall takes the *High Ascent to the Sun and Moon* as its ancestral method. By extension, it may be applied to others to cure illness and expel evil. Cultivated within oneself, it enables communion with the perfected and attainment of immortality. Yet the *High Ascent* is not easily practiced; one must first advance through the ranks to receive and preserve it.\n\nAscent signifies the meaning of *ascent* [to the luminaries], while descent signifies its application to others and to oneself. Heaven and earth mark day and night by the sun and moon, and all transformations of yin and yang, cold and heat, arise from them. Thus, nothing moves heaven and earth or stirs ghosts and spirits more than these.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Sun and Moon Light on Dawn and Full Moon Days**\nAt sunrise on the first day of the lunar month, the adept sits facing east, visualizing the sunlight nine feet before them. The sun has nine rays, and within them, five-colored luminous *qi* descends into the adept’s mouth, entering the five viscera, radiant as a crimson sun. Recite the incantation:\n> *Oṃ va-dri-ra guṇa-sūri svāhā.*\n> Five Emperors of the Sun, true *qi* descend swiftly.\n> Pierce my abdomen, enter my viscera, *qi* surging, *qi* strengthening.\n\nThen inhale the *qi* nine times, swallowing nine times, until warmth is felt within the abdomen. Perform this thrice. After a year of practice, the *qi* will be robust and the spirit vigorous; when deploying talismans or consecrated water, responses will arise naturally.\n\nAt moonrise on the full moon, the adept sits facing east, visualizing the moonlight nine feet before them. The moon has ten rays, and within them, five-colored luminous *qi* descends into the adept’s mouth, entering the five viscera, luminous as the full moon. Recite the incantation:\n> *Oṃ va-candra ra □-ra svāhā.*\n> August Sovereign of the Moon, Five Perfected Ladies,\n> True *qi* descends, piercing my body’s court.\n> Preserve my immortal life, ten thousand years unshaken.\n\nThen inhale the *qi* nine times, swallowing nine times, until warmth is felt within the abdomen. Perform this thrice. After a year of practice, the *qi* will be pure and the body numinous; when treating illness or subduing malevolent spirits, responses will arise naturally.\n\n**External Ascent to the Two Luminaries**\nOn a quiet night, the adept enters a chamber and sits in stillness, banishing thoughts and emptying the mind. They visualize crimson *qi* emerging from their heart, coalescing into a cloud chariot. Their body ascends the chariot, rising gently to the Solar Palace, where they behold the Solar Emperor bestowing the *Talisman of the Sun’s Nurturing Perfection*. After ingesting it, they descend with the Emperor into the *Niwan* [palace], lingering until form is forgotten. They then knock their teeth, swallow saliva, and withdraw.\n\nAfter completing the ascent to the sun, the adept again visualizes white *qi* emerging from their kidneys, ascending from the crown to form a cloud chariot. Their body ascends the chariot, rising gently to the Lunar Palace, where they behold the August Lady of the Moon bestowing the *Talisman of the Moon’s Nurturing Perfection*. After ingesting it, they descend with the Lady into the *Niwan*, lingering until form is forgotten. They then knock their teeth, swallow saliva, and withdraw.\n\nThis Way of the Two Luminaries should be practiced daily in moments of leisure, diligently and consistently. Over time, wondrous and extraordinary responses will arise, beyond full description.\n\n**Method for Inscribing Talismans and Infusing the Brush**\n\nWhenever the adept wishes to inscribe the talismans of the Three Luminaries, they must first silently recite the incantation of the Lord of the Sun one thousand two hundred times. The incantation of the Lady of the Moon is to be recited likewise.\n\nNext, the adept forms the mudra of the Lord of the Sun, visualizing the sun before their face. From within the sun, five-colored *qi* emerges, infusing the brush. The incantation is recited twelve times, and twelve breaths of *qi* are drawn into the brush. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"True light of the Great Yang,\nNine rays of solar fire.\nFlow down to the brush’s tip,\nInscribe the talisman’s turning script.\nLongevity and enduring vision,\nDispelling all inauspicious omens.\"*\n\nNext, the adept forms the mudra of the Lady of the Moon, visualizing the moon before their face. From within the moon, five-colored *qi* emerges, infusing the brush. The incantation is recited twelve times, and twelve breaths of *qi* are drawn into the brush. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"True brightness of the Great Yin,\nTrue water purifies form.\nTrue light enters the brush,\nInfusing the talisman with reality.\nExpelling filth and banishing evil,\nPreserving spirit and protecting the body.\"*\n\nUpon completion, the adept may inscribe the talisman as they wish. If inscribing the talisman of the Three Luminaries, they further form the *Ding* mudra with the second finger of the left hand. The incantation is recited:\n\n*\"Oṃ gaṃ da li svāhā.\"*\n\nThirty-six times, with each recitation, the adept draws in *qi* and exhales upon the brush before inscribing the talisman. After visualizing the ascent of the sun and moon, they return to the altar and ingest the mudras of the *Talismans of the Sun’s and Moon’s Nurturing Perfection*.\n\n**Talisman of the Sun’s Nurturing Perfection**\nThe *Talisman of the Sun’s Nurturing Perfection* is inscribed in cinnabar on light yellow paper, then burned and taken in jujube decoction. While ingesting, the adept recites the incantation.\n\n**Talisman of the Moon’s Nurturing Perfection**\nThe *Talisman of the Moon’s Nurturing Perfection* is inscribed in ink on light yellow paper, then burned and taken in jujube decoction. While ingesting, the adept recites the incantation.\n\n**Methods for Expelling, Restraining, and Subduing**\n\nThe Master said: Those born in the *xia-yuan* *jia-zi* year are of meager fortune and scant virtue; blessings shun them, yet malevolent spirits, demons, and baleful influences readily assail them. Thus misfortune befalls their households, or they themselves encounter grotesqueries and suffer untimely or unjust deaths. Therefore, the Most High revealed the *Decree of Expulsion* and established the *Methods of Restraint and Subduing*, that demons might not trespass, and humankind ascend to longevity and well-being—how splendid indeed!\n\nYet once these teachings emerged and spread through the ages, hearsay and misinterpretation obscured the true and gave rise to the false, fracturing the orthodox methods. Thus, their application lost efficacy, and expelling demons yielded no response. Fragments of texts and broken talismans left the profound and wondrous untransmitted, a failing of those who uphold and transmit the methods.\n\nThis foundational stage, then, is not meant to establish distinctions among talismans or degrees of transmission. Worldly folk, fickle in their pursuits, begin but do not persist, treating sacred texts with levity, as mere child’s play. Thus, this initial stage is set to gauge the aspirant’s capacity for the Dao. If one proves steadfast in purpose, the transmission of the orthodox lineage and the continuation of the great teaching truly commence here—how could one not proceed with utmost care?\n\nThe Master said: This foundational stage of *Methods for Expelling, Restraining, and Subduing* does not imply concealment or omission. These methods, transmitted by the Master’s decree, are the simplest to practice and the most readily efficacious. Yet one must reflect: such encounters are not easily come by, and their execution is no small feat. Among these secrets are those unrecorded in the canonical texts; here they are first recorded to instruct the novice—take heed.\n\nThe Master said: Ghostly *qi* prevails in the lands south of the Yangtze, most densely in the Hundred Yue regions, where customs revere spirits and believe in perverse forces. Thus, people invite chaos, attracting malevolent influences to assail and afflict them. The benighted, unaware of their own harm, instead place their faith in these forces, and those poisoned by them grovel in servitude, blind to their plight. Such is the unchecked rampancy of ghostly *qi*, rising to offend the celestial *qi* of the clouds and heavens, its foul vapors violating heaven and earth. The Perfected Ones grow wrathful and no longer descend, while demons rejoice in their unchallenged dominance. Thus, in the world, private altars and temples—whether in monasteries or shrines—abound with false spirits masquerading as gods. Without the great methods to uphold the true teaching, how can these malevolent forces be easily eradicated?\n\nThe Master’s instruction for the initial signs of this stage states: In treating afflictions, when confronting great afflictions, one must pity the lesser. What are the great afflictions? They are the factions of spirit temples, the entities clinging to mountains and forests, the usurpers of monastic altars—these are the great afflictions. Their roots extend a thousand *li*, their lairs connect to the four directions, harming the innocent and ensnaring the dead into their ranks. Over time, their strong spirits and wayward souls occupy every place, demanding blood sacrifices and spreading poison to harm the people, ceaselessly. Thus, to treat one affliction is to provoke the multitude. If the multitude, thwarted in their demands, face execution, the response echoes from the four directions and a thousand *li*, rallying their followers and depleting their ranks to battle the true method. If the novice harbors even a trace of hesitation, the demonic horde seizes the advantage, the true method fails, and the people suffer—how lamentable!\n\nThe so-called lesser afflictions are but wandering souls; one should pity their lingering state and enable their deliverance. To treat lesser afflictions with ease while struggling against the great is to lose sight of the Most High’s original intent in establishing these methods.\n\n**Talisman for Subduing the Factions of Great Afflictions**\n*Jade Clarity Highest Emperor, Supreme Clarity Great Emperor, Grand Clarity Great Emperor, Jade Sovereign Emperor, Supreme Limit of the Great Lofty Jade Clarity, Upper Prime General, Middle Prime General, Lower Prime General—seize, bind, and execute all wayward ghosts and spirits. Upper Terrace of Void Essence, Middle Terrace of Sixfold Purity, Lower Terrace of Crooked Life—wherever you arrive, bestow mighty numen. Eight Execution Generals, Four Execution Spirit Lords, Execution Ghosts, Celestial Soldiers—execute all wayward and malevolent ghosts and spirits. Open the Gate of Heaven, Close the Door of Earth, Bar the Human Gate, Block the Ghostly Path. Left Celestial Stem, Right River Demon—execute demonic ghosts, thunderous roars. Twenty-Eight Constellations, Level Heaven General, Level Earth General—lead the celestial soldiers to capture ghosts and spirits, annihilate demonic essences.*\n\n**Incantation for the Talisman**\nThe Emperor issues the talisman, the celestial decree is majestic.\nHeavenly Penumbra, Black Executioner, Dark Warrior—guard the heavens.\nCommanding the celestial soldiers, the celestial stalwarts follow.\nFire formations spread in four directions, thunder and wind roar.\nSearch the void, inspect the earth, overturn mountains and rivers.\nDare any rebellious ghost charge before me?\nThe stem fire incinerates, flames and smoke fly.\nSevered without mercy, eternally imprisoned in the dark springs.\nThe Emperor’s decree is issued, wind and fire swiftly transmit.\nI act by the authority of the Northern Culmen Purple Tenuity Great Emperor.\n\nFor this talisman, visualize the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen above your head, the Four Saints arrayed at the sides, black clouds filling the four voids, weapons and armor teeming. The novice receives this talisman from the Northern Emperor, swallows it, and firelight bursts forth in all directions, thunder resounds. Then, open your eyes and inscribe the talisman on a full sheet of yellow paper with ground cinnabar, facing north. This talisman bears the Emperor’s ultimate punishment; when affixed to the household courtyard, ghosts and spirits within the four directions are expelled nine *li* beyond. If burned at a haunted site, the celestial generals will manifest their might, sweeping and purging an area thirty *li* in all directions to stillness. When inscribing the talisman, maintain utmost sincerity: enter the chamber, silently present your petition, sit in stillness, and then proceed.\n\n**Great Execution Text, Northern *Qi***\n*Three Officials’ General Talisman for Searching Out and Expelling Evil*\nUpper Prime Heavenly Official—executes spirits,\nMiddle Prime Earthly Official—executes ghosts,\nLower Prime Water Official—executes essences.\nThree Primes, Unicorn Envoys—center.\nLeft Azure Dragon Mengzhang, Right White Tiger Jianbing,\nFront Vermilion Bird Lingguang, Rear Dark Warrior Zhiming,\nCelestial Stem Great Sage Gouchen, Yellow Court—center.\n*Zi-Wu-Mao-You*—center.\nThunder Duke, Fierce Officer Xin Hanchen—body rides a ten-thousand-*zhang* flying serpent, mouth spewing firelight a myriad *li* to burn.\nExecute!

Use gold paper and spirit horses, and at midnight, burn it in the central courtyard. Also inscribe this talisman and fumigate the afflicted one’s bed curtains, chambers, and rooms with its smoke, or burn it to ashes. When performed with utmost sincerity, extraordinary retribution shall follow.\n\n**Talisman for Expelling Demonic Curses and Devouring Ghosts**\n*Upper Clarity, Northern Culmen, Purple Tenuity Great Emperor*\n*Heavenly Pen Marshal and the Thirty-Six Generals descend into the talisman to execute all lawless ghosts and spirits*\n*Swiftly, by the Northern Culmen Great Emperor’s decree!*\n\n*(Above)* Upper Realm’s Great General of Devouring Demons and Consuming Ghosts, Zhong Jian\n*(Below)* Lower Realm’s Great General of Devouring Demons and Consuming Ghosts, Xu Guangfu\n*Left sun, right moon—illuminate and vanquish demons and fiends*\n*Open the Gate of Heaven, close the Door of Earth, preserve the Gate of Man, block the Path of Ghosts*\n*□□□□□□□*\n*Devouring demons, consuming ghosts—fangs sharp, blades keen*\n*Heavenly Pen Mantra Seal*\n*Heaven-Slaying Divine Lord, Earth-Slaying Divine Lord, Year-Slaying Divine Lord, Month-Slaying Divine Lord, Day-Slaying Divine Lord, Hour-Slaying Divine Lord—slay all lawless ghosts and demons!*\n*Heaven rejects them, Earth bears them not—swiftly!*\n*Five Directions’ malevolent ghosts—devour, consume, obliterate, and eradicate!*\n\nThis talisman follows the Northern Emperor’s method, to be inscribed while facing the Dipper’s *Gang*. It may be ingested, whereby the ghosts and demons within the body shall be devoured and annihilated. If used for suppression and posting, ghosts and demons shall see it and be consumed without remainder. This talisman is the Heavenly Pen Marshal’s great and mighty *virtue/power*—the method of devouring demons and consuming ghosts.\n\n*Thus concludes the twenty-seventh scroll of the* Supreme

For those who study the lower mysteries, by this means they may commune with the loftiest Perfected and reach the hidden numinous—how could its benefit be small?\n\nAltar design includes red banners.\n\n**Eastern Heaven-Pacifying Azure Numinous Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nThe azure void refines true qi,\nMerging to form the embryo’s essence.\nVerdant radiance of jade shimmers,\nAs the nine qi return the yang spirit.\nTowering and dense, the verdant pillars rise,\nTheir jade branches scattering cool shade.\nAbove, they connect to the Palace of Luxuriance,\nSoaring high to the Crimson Wheel of Fire.\n\nGrasp the *mao* mudra in the right hand, visualize the nine azure qi of the East coiling and surging, vigorously entering the altar.\nKnock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times.\nNine azure-clad figures emerge from the left ear, dwelling in the liver.\n\n**Southern Heaven-Pacifying Cinnabar Numinous Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\n\nThe cloud chamber chants the mystery song,\nAs crimson qi scatters in radiant brilliance.\nThe Vermilion Bird spews flames of mist,\nThe Red Emperor’s blaze flickers and glows.\nThe mighty ramparts hold the three qi complete,\nThe heavy yin suddenly parts to reveal light.\nAbove lies the Scarlet Mound Palace,\nWhere the body is refined to return to the One True.\n\nGrasp the *wu* mudra in the right hand, visualize the three crimson qi of the South coiling and surging, vigorously entering the altar.\nKnock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times.\nThree scarlet-clad figures emerge from the left nostril, dwelling in the heart.\n\n**Western Heaven-Pacifying Luminous White Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nThe twin swords of the flowing bells resound,\nTheir golden tones shaking the heavenly court.\nLuminous white congeals the mysterious image,\nAs the tiger’s roar draws in crystalline clarity.\nAbove lies the Land of Pure Splendor,\nWhere jade towers and autumnal qi are clear.\nJade radiance weaves through the long night,\nRound brightness unfolds the eight vast seas.\n\nGrasp the *you* mudra in the right hand, visualize the seven white qi of the West coiling and surging, vigorously entering the altar.\nKnock the teeth seven times, swallow saliva seven times.\nSeven white-clad figures emerge from the right ear, dwelling in the lungs.\n\n**Northern Heaven-Pacifying Dark Numinous Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\n\n**Northern Heaven-Pacifying Dark Numinous Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nVast waves drum the azure deep,\nThe black heavens stir with limpid chill.\nThe Qi Emperor bows in song,\nJade tones enter the distant void.\nThe Crimson Prime’s single qi is complete,\nWithin dwells the Jade-Faced Infant.\nReturning to the womb, he ascends the upper palace,\nHis pure name resounds like jade wheels turning.\n\nGrasp the *zi* mudra in the right hand, visualize the Black One’s boundless qi of the North coiling and surging, vigorously entering the altar.\nKnock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times.\nFive qi-clad figures emerge from the right nostril, dwelling in the kidneys.\n\n**Central Yellow Numinous Heaven-Pacifying Jade Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nYellow clouds veil the numinous root,\nThe Five Emperors pay homage at the upper gate.\nQi upon qi returns to cinnabar and jasper,\nThe cavernous void refines the immortal soul.\nThe central jade tablet stabilizes the eight poles,\nSeated therein is the Yellow Court’s Venerable One.\nThe jade scripture is chanted with radiant clarity,\nWinged feathers ascend the flowered carriage.\n\nGrasp the central *wen* mudra in the right hand, visualize the Central Yellow’s singular qi coiling and surging, vigorously entering the altar.\nKnock the teeth twelve times.\nTwelve yellow-clad figures emerge from the crown, dwelling in the spleen.\n\nThe Master says: These Five Directions’ Heaven-Pacifying Jade Talismanic Feathered Scripts may be employed above to pacify and secure the state, uphold auspicious fortune; below to cultivate nature and destiny, dispel demons and expel evil, succor the dying and deliver the living—none are beyond their use. These are the inner tones of the Five Emperors, not the common words of the world.\n\n**General Knocking of the Teeth**\nThree knocks, visualize the Three Responsive Jade Realms.\nHair bristles in dense array, yang radiance bursts forth,\nPenetrating and resonating in the four directions.\nThis is called the wondrous art of communion with the real.\n\nThe Master says: Knocking the teeth gathers the yang spirits within the body, yet their uses differ. When beseeching the real and invoking the sacred, communicating with heaven and moving earth, it is called \"sounding the Dharma Drum.\" The Dharma Drum consists of the four front teeth above and below, making eight teeth in total. Three knocks yield twenty-four resonances. The left teeth are called the Golden Bell; the right teeth, the Jade Chime. Know their wondrous efficacy. When the body is free of illness, this is called the True Person. Sounding the Dharma Drum gathers my yang spirits, ascending to commune with the Jade Palace, paying homage to the lofty venerables. All demons bow their heads, and eternal life is forever attained.\n\n**Jade Staircase Curtain-Raising Heaven-Ascending True Talisman**\nExecute the Jade Clarity mudra, drawing the qi of the Heavenly Gate.\nBrush aside the curtain’s veil, visualize the Great Void’s primordial chaos—no decree is visible.\nThen employ the second talisman.\n*Incantation:*\nThe Dao is wondrous yet formless,\nHeaven is quiescent, soundless.\nScattered, it is not lost;\nGathered, it does not form.\nThe distant void bears an image,\nThe indistinct holds true essence.\nCongealed into an auspicious sign,\nThe image becomes real.\nMay the Jade Portal open,\nThat I may pay homage to the lofty venerables.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Jade Capital’s Empty Mystery Vision-Form Talisman**\nExecute the Jade Clarity mudra, envision the formless world of the Great Void as lustrous jade, without distance or height, all of one hue. Within it, a luminous point shines like a millet grain, its interior and exterior crystalline. Visualize the Primordial Beginning’s Celestial Venerable within, then employ the third talisman.\n*Incantation:*\nThe qi of the Great Beginning,\nSpontaneous and non-actional.\nThe Void Origin bears an image,\nSuspended in the empty mystery.\nEncompassing the ten thousand beings,\nNurturing and transforming immortals and gods.\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet untransmitted.\nBefore and after indistinguishable,\nMystery within mystery.\nMay the numinous creation open,\nThat I may personally worship the Mysterious Origin.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Audience with the Origin’s Natural Secret Talisman**\nExecute the Jade Clarity mudra, visualize the curtain’s front as a true pearl’s mouth, drawing the Dao’s hosts and transforming multitudes of perfected beings to enter. After a long while, see only a golden-hued world, nothing else.\n*Incantation:*\nThe jeweled curtain is drawn,\nThe jade countenance’s light returns.\nEnter the treasure pearl,\nListen to the Dharma’s lingering.\nThe spirit’s mind is serene and clear,\nFortune and wisdom both arrive.\nPreserve my flying immortal,\nAscending to the Jade Terrace.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Secret Method for Harmonious Summoning with Bell and Chime**\nThe Master says: The bell sounds yang; the chime, yin. When the altar’s steps are complete, strike the golden bell and jade chime to summon harmony. Not only to summon harmony, but to gather yin spirits and yang numina, intermingling their qi. Thus, the golden bell is struck twenty-five times, modeling heaven—heaven’s number is twenty-five. The jade chime is struck thirty times, modeling earth—earth’s number is thirty. Moreover, as yin and yang desire their union, the bell and chime are struck alternately thirty-six times, one yin and one yang totaling seventy-two, to connect with the seventy-two seasonal nodes. Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises. Thus, decline and renewal alternate, adversity and prosperity succeed one another. Yin cannot be wholly yin, so it returns to its yang sound, and the jade chime is struck nine times. Nine is the Qian number, yang. Yang cannot be wholly yang, so it returns to its yin sound, and the golden bell is struck six times. Six is the Kun number, yin.\n\n**Jade Talisman for Summoning Yin Spirits**\n*Incantation:*\nThe Primordial Beginning’s singular qi,\nSilently moves the primordial essence.\nHarmonizing tones and tuning rhythms,\nStirring the turbid and raising the pure.\nThe wondrous qi of the secluded and distant,\nThe wondrous qi’s initial congealment.\nCoiling through the empty cavern,\nThe sound within heaven.\nGathering essence and descending qi,\nIssuing forth the true voice.\nYin sounds interweave,\nSummoning the ten thousand numina.\n\n**Jade Talisman for Summoning Yang Spirits**\nStrike the golden bell once, tap the left teeth once. Strike the jade chime once, tap the right teeth once. Visualize the two qi of left and right within the body intermingling, filling the mysterious altar.\n*Incantation:*\nStillness gives birth to movement,\nReturning yin generates yang.\nThe Great Tone enters the wondrous,\nWandering the empty valley.\nSound responds to qi’s seeking,\nIntermingling in gong and shang.\nSound upon sound resonates,\nTransforming and circulating the mysterious altar.\nThe sound that arouses yang,\nUnites with heaven’s firmness.\nYang spirits intermingle,\nTrue qi blends in harmony.\n\n**Nine Audiences in Three Days**\nThe *Scripture of Pacing the Void* states: Lofty immortals and great sages ascend the Jade Capital Mountain thrice daily to offer pure fasts, practice the Dao, and soar through the empty void. Thus, the rites of audience with the perfected in the lower realm must emulate this. One gives birth to two, two gives birth to three—hence, one day has three audiences. Three begets nine—hence, three days have nine audiences. In practice, for the morning audience, visualize the yang spirit of the upper cinnabar field paying homage to the Origin’s Venerable in the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nAt the noon audience, visualize the yang spirit of the middle cinnabar field paying homage to the Crimson Palace. At the evening audience, visualize the yang spirit of the lower cinnabar field paying homage to the cinnabar field, then ascending from its original place upon the qi.\n\nAt dawn, ride the azure qi of the Mud Pill Palace to pay homage to the Primordial Lord. At noon, ride the yellow qi of the heart to pay homage to the Lord of the Dao. At dusk, ride the white-and-black qi of the kidneys to pay homage to the Old Lord. Thus, the inner qi merges with the outer qi, and the outer spirits align with the inner spirits—so that in a single instant, response is as swift as an echo.\n\n**First Day at Dawn: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe chapter of the Mysterious Cavern of Chaos dispels yin and generates yang.\nCrimson radiance illumines above; the golden chamber shines resplendent.\nThe mysterious altar gleams bright; the gates of heaven stand wide open.\nTrue immortals descend and manifest; demonic trials withdraw in concealment.\nTurn the light toward the Jade Portal to refine and nurture the Spirit King.\nThe nine qi are complete—ascend to the Jade Hall.\n\n**First Day at Noon: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe golden wheel blazes crimson, its light illuminating the Purple Tenuity.\nThe Lord Emperor issues his decree to crush and destroy demonic pests.\nLight descends from the Three Heavens;

the golden wheel does not delay.\nGathering qi in fusion, light fills the feathered robes.\nFusang initiates its motion; green yang intermingles in swift exchange.\nPay homage to the Great Crimson, refining the subtle mysteries of the Dao.\n\n**Second Day at Noon: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe radiant vermilion spirits ascend to pay homage at the Jade Capital.\nEight gates stand guard; the Six Heavens disperse yin.\nHeaven’s light aligns with the luminous realm; the earthly prisons grow clear.\nThe crimson talisman circulates within; dark fiends conceal their forms.\nThe Heavenly Soldiers are mighty, smiting demonic essences.\nCorpses and evil perish and fall—eternally preserve the immortal lifespan.\n\n**Second Day at Dusk: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe pure and luminous true radiance sees bright stars arrayed across the heavens.\nTrue immortals ride their chariots; exalted sages approach the throne.\nClouds form fragrant talismans; the jeweled canopy shelters the true field.\nThe Divine Mother of Jade Purity bestows enlightenment upon the profound mysteries.\nHeaven and earth unite in harmony; ten thousand kalpas stretch endlessly.\nIn the unity of creation, ascend to the Jade Terrace.\n\n**Third Day at Dawn: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nEastern Florescence dawns in brilliance; the perfected turn their chariots.\nThe Cavern of Yang shines resplendent, its light penetrating the clouded robes.\nAscend to pay homage at the Jade Realm, communing with the true and awakening to the subtle.\nWander amidst Brahman qi, refining the golden elixir.\nThe yang spirits array themselves in order; clarity extends in all four directions.\nThe kalpic revolutions of the cosmos are preserved eternally without loss.\n\n**Third Day at Noon: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe midday crimson wheel sees heavenly spirits and perfected ones ascend.\nThey guard and seal the demonic paths; no malevolent forces dare invade.\nThe five yang return to the six; the one yin scatters its form.\nThe Mysterious Palace rests in peace; the Three Radiant Ones grow clear.\nRefine the body of unyielding strength to preserve the Great Brilliance.\nWith power, grind away calamity—unite with heaven in spirit.\n\n**Third Day at Dusk: Recitation of the Dao-Protecting and Spirit-Guarding Incantation**\nThe inner vision of the Mysterious Void sees heaven and earth conjoined.\nYin and yang are harmonized;

Great Method**\n**Scroll One: Elucidating the Great Dao (Chapter One)**\n\nThe Master said: The Dao originally has no name, nor does it have form.\nThe marvel of the Dao is born before Heaven;\nIts principle abides after Heaven.\nIts teachings were first established in the degenerate age.\n\nFor the Dao cannot be sought through form and traces,\nNor can it be attained through sound and color.\nAll people, from birth, are endowed with this Dao.\nThus, if one’s cultivation and perseverance are steadfast and enduring, ascension may be hoped for.\n\nYet those unlearned do not awaken to the true essence.\nIn their daily lives, they are constantly mired in the dust and clamor,\nWillingly drowning in the sea of right and wrong, emotions and desires,\nAdrift and sinking, unable to extricate themselves.\n\nThus, the sagely masters, pitying those benighted and unable to comprehend,\nThought it better to guide and lead them forward—hence the rise of teachings and methods.\nThough the Daoist methods may not yet enable one to ascend to the True,\nThey may still be used to seek the True.\nThough they may not yet enable one to attain the Dao,\nThey may still be used to enter the Dao.\n\nYet sentient beings, unaware of the compassionate intent to guide them,\nAssume the Great Dao is merely these teachings and methods.\nThus, they often abandon the true to pursue the false, forsaking the root to chase the branches.\nHow could they know that the Dao resides within themselves?\nIf one grasps its essential principles and cultivates them over time, one may attain the True.\n\nOnce my true primordial essence is accomplished,\nThere will be surplus to supplement what is lacking,\nAnd all that is practiced will become the Dao.\nIf one does not know the secrets of cultivating the True,\nBut merely engages in the toil of practicing methods,\nReceiving unclear instruction and clinging to words on paper,\nOne drifts ever farther from the Dao.\n\nThus, the sagely masters’ intent is to first cultivate the self,\nAnd only then can one command ghosts and spirits.\nIf one does not know that cultivation lies within oneself,\nBut merely relies on submitting memorials and petitions for retribution,\nOr on breath and movement for command,\nThe heart grows ever more deluded, the effects ever more distant,\nOne’s true essence daily dissipates, one’s true vitality daily wanes.\n\nThose who inherit these teachings must prioritize enlightenment,\nTaking cultivation as the foundation.\nHow could one then worry about being unable to practice the methods?\n\nThe Dao within me can be fully expressed in a single word;\nYet to extend it and transform others cannot be completed in a single word.\nNow, the oral instructions of the true masters are set forth below,\nSo that learners may easily trace the source.\nIf the Dao is already awakened, then these words are but the trap and snare.\nFor the unenlightened, one must rely on written expressions—\nThus it is said: \"Without scripture, none can be delivered.\"\n\nThe Jade Hall is the natural formation of primordial *qi* into a hall within the Jade Capital Mountain.\nWithin it dwell the Nine Venerable Elders, born of the *qi* of Radiant Clarity.\nThe mountain is bathed in golden light, never darkening;\nThe nine *qi* flourish eternally—this is called the Realm of Jade Purity.\nThus, this teaching emerged from the Jade Capital Mountain, hence the name \"Jade Hall.\"\n\nYet the marvels of the Jade Capital and the Jasper Hall,\nThe mystery of the Nine Venerable Primordial Lords,\nFar lie in the lofty and luminous heavens,\nNear lie within the heavens of one’s own body.\n\nThose who inherit the Jade Hall are companions of Heaven—\nAnd Heaven’s companionship is none other than the Three Luminaries.\nThus, the true masters internally cultivate the Three Luminaries to accomplish the Dao,\nAnd externally employ the Three Luminaries to create talismans.\n\nFor the marvel of the Three Luminaries:\nHeaven obtains it and endures forever;\nHumans follow it and ascend to the True.\nThus, spreading the radiance of the Three Luminaries can cure the world’s illnesses;\nUnleashing the dharmic power of the Three Luminaries can command ghosts and spirits;\nProclaiming the majestic virtue of the Three Luminaries can eradicate demonic and numinous disturbances;\nDescending the wisdom and illumination of the Three Luminaries can open the netherworld.\n\nThough the methods of the Three Luminaries are simple,\nTheir practice lies within oneself, boundless and inexhaustible.\nNow, learners must unite the Three Luminaries within their bodies\nWith the Three Luminaries in Heaven.\nOnly then can one be called a master.",

      "translated_text": "To inherit the teachings, first compare one’s body to Heaven and Earth, aligning the mysterious Dao with the primordial beginning of the original kalpa—this is Heaven’s Great Ultimate. One must then reflect: what is the Great Ultimate within oneself? After Heaven and Earth divided, they took form, just as one’s body does. Knowing that one’s body parallels Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth endure eternally while the sun and moon revolve, while one’s body is subject to unceasing birth and death—if one wishes to match Heaven’s longevity, one must ponder: by what Dao do Heaven and Earth endure? By what Dao do immortals and transcendents endure? And by what causes does the human body undergo birth and death? When these are comprehended within, the Dao of immortality is attained.\n\nThe Master says: The wondrous Dao values emptiness and nothingness; the ancient Dao prioritizes simplicity and plainness. Today’s Dao is neither simple nor plain, nor is it empty and nothing. All elaborate rituals, intricate verses, and recitations—these only distance one further from the Dao in this age. Those who seek the Dao must move from complexity to simplicity, from superficiality to plainness, and from simplicity and plainness ascend to emptiness and nothingness. Only then can one explore the mystery within the mystery.\n\nPurity of mind is called *zhai* (fasting); restraint of the self is called *jie* (precepts). Today, people’s minds are mired in the mundane, and they call eating coarse grains and vegetables *zhai*—this is not merit or virtue, but a misunderstanding. Only by severing all worldly affairs and ceasing to dwell on them can the mind wander with Heaven, the spirit merge with *qi*, and within movement and stillness, creation and transformation fuse as one. Ghosts and spirits respond—this is what is meant by practicing the method.\n\nWhat does *xingchi* (practice and perseverance) entail? *Xing* means advancing without cease—entering the path of longevity, ascending the gate of true immortality, and enduring without weariness. *Chi* means grasping firmly and enduring, like holding an object in hand, determined not to let it fall. The ancients practiced by first rectifying their own deviations. Today, people practice while their corporeal deviations remain unexpunged, making it easy for external deviations to enter. To seek control over ghosts and spirits thus becomes difficult. If one can maintain a single-minded resolve, in stillness and concentration, responding with the true to the true—this is the subtlety of *xingchi*.\n\nWhen writing talismans, first enter the chamber, burn incense, and sit in silence for a long while. Once *qi* settles and the spirit is at ease, knock the teeth and circulate the energy, unifying heart and talisman, talisman and heart as one. The eastern radiance requires no turning of the head; the exhalation of *qi* should not produce sound. Grinding ink and applying cinnabar should be as if wielding golden and silver light. When dipping the brush and writing, only luminous clarity should be seen. The circulation of intent should not be sluggish—one stroke reveals all that precedes. The incantation lies in the voice of the heart, precisely when writing the talisman. With a mind unstained by external defilements, write the talisman as if transmitting one’s own spirit. Upon completion, circulate *qi* and bestow the mudra.\n\nFor talismans that expel evil, circulate one’s own fierce *qi*; for talismans that deliver and save, circulate the natural, life-giving *qi* of Heaven. The subtlety lies not in outward form but in the secret circulation of *qi*. The use of seals in practice serves to discipline the mind and body. Later generations, lacking understanding, exhaust their minds and bodies. The ancients sealed with the heart; today, people seal with wood. The establishment of ritual seals serves to govern the duties of the method, so that when one holds the seal, there is a place of refuge, and when one impresses it, there is a hierarchy of submission. Those who inherit the teachings must possess the Three Seals—these must not be treated lightly.\n\nBefore enlightenment, one relies on wooden seals; after enlightenment, only the seal of the heart remains. Thus it is said: Heaven has its seal, and the Three Luminaries are thereby ordered. Humans have their seal, and the chamber of the spirit is thereby clarified. The seal lies within oneself—why rely on external objects? When no external object is relied upon, it is called *tongxuan* (penetrating the mystery). The mystery within the mystery—this is the subtlety of the Dao.\n\nThe method of drawing *qi* lies in the Three Luminaries. To draw the *qi* of the Three Luminaries, one must unite the true with the true. Today, people do not understand the method of drawing *qi*—they merely turn their heads upward, inhale cold *qi*, and exhale warm *qi*. Yet the Three Luminaries in Heaven are exceedingly distant; a single breath cannot truly capture them. Little do they know that one’s own Three Luminaries reside within the body, not far away, requiring no laborious inhalation to naturally endure. The key lies in circulating one’s own true *qi* and gathering it—thus, one need not labor to absorb external *qi*.\n\nThe Master says: Unite the heart with the spirit, and the spirit with nothingness. The method of pacing the stars lies in the feet—where the feet tread, the hands also move. As the hands move, the heart also abides. This is what is meant by pacing the *gang* (cosmic pattern). Otherwise, not only will there be no response, but it will also be of no benefit. Those who have attained the Dao, their bodies already pervaded by truth, need not pace to align with the *gang*, nor move to form mudras, nor intentionally abide—yet all abide.\n\nCommunion with the true lies in burning incense, and the principle of burning incense is something practitioners must understand. The nature of the Five Phases: fire is said to blaze upward. When paying homage to the true or summoning generals, burning incense uses the sincerity of the heart to borrow the *qi* of fire and ascend. In practice, one must use a blazing fire and abundant incense—one offering reaches its destination. Otherwise, it cannot transcend and ascend.\n\nThe format of memorials also has its explanation. The ancients’ hearts communed with Heaven; today, people’s hearts are separated from Heaven. When communing, a single thought and Heaven already knows; when separated, repeated memorials fail to reach Heaven. This is because the mundane heart and the celestial true are cut off from one another. Yet the world relies on paper and ink to write, attempting to convey messages upward through fire—this practice has endured for so long that it has proliferated endlessly, falling into the realm of deliberate action. Those who inherit the teachings today, even if their memorials can reach Heaven, should reduce their number to a minimum, so that the heart may remain in profound stillness, making resonance easier to achieve.\n\nThe Master says: The above are the teachings bestowed by the Heavenly Lord, Great Master of the Teachings. Later learners must prioritize cultivation and realization. In the past, when I encountered an immortal master, I received the *Tianxin* method from the ancestral master, seeking oral instructions. Thereupon, the secrets of the Three Luminaries were explained in detail, and the essentials of ascending the hall were transmitted. Thus, I came to know that *Tianxin* pertains to the exorcistic practices of the Jade Hall teachings.\n\nThe Master says: The Great Dao requires only lifting one’s eyes to see; the supreme vehicle needs not expend much effort of the heart. It is also said: Close the gate while it is still early; apprehend the thief by knowing the time.",

      "translated_text": "Upon hearing these words, my heart was moved, and I asked again: \"When does this occur?\"\nThe Master replied: \"The time lies in the Heavenly Heart, like panning for gold in water.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, I asked further: \"At the beginning of the primordial kalpa of the Original Beginning, who was the ancestral master?\"\nHe said: \"Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body.\"\nI asked again: \"Must there be a surname?\"\nHe did not answer. After a long while, he said: \"Not knowing whose child this body is, it precedes the image of the Emperor.\"\n\nI asked: \"What is the appearance of the sacred image?\"\nThe Master said: \"Look and you do not see; listen and you do not hear.\"\nI asked: \"If it is neither seen nor heard, then there is no Original Beginning?\"\nThe Master said: \"Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is something.\nVague indeed, indistinct indeed, yet within it there is an image.\"\n\nI asked again: \"What, after all, is this thing?\"\nThe Master said: \"A precious pearl hangs suspended, illuminating the Three Luminaries.\"\n\nThereafter, in every question and answer, the discourse was of the most profound mysteries, the subtleties of ascending to perfection. Now, as I preside over the altar to transmit the teachings, the words of the former sagely masters must not be forgotten. Thus, I have gathered these arcane subtleties and recorded them in broad outline. All the Master’s subtle instructions serve to elucidate the essence of the Great Dao. Those who study this will understand that the teachings of the Jade Hall lie in cultivating the mysteries of the Three Luminaries, not in externals—how could they be neglected?\n\n**Tai Shang’s Natural Threefold Ascension Diagram**\n*Formula:*\nThe heart is still, the realm forgotten; alone, guard the Yellow Chamber.\nThe One True emerges, filling the room with golden light.\n\n*Another formula:*\nSilently contain the true, and heaven and earth arrive together.\nMotionless and serene, the myriad spirits revere and obey.\n\n*Another formula:*\nClose the heart within, the imperial palace far away.\nWhen the yang spirit’s qi is full, step across the golden bridge.\n\nOn the night of the Upper Prime in the gengzi year of the Xuanhe era, after offering incense at the star altar and returning to the chamber to preserve the true, an extraordinary fragrance descended. Turning my head, I saw the ancestral master within a radiance of golden light and Brahmanic qi. He said to me: \"I am Zhao Sheng of Wu, now serving at the celestial court. In my former life, I dwelt on Mount Tianmu and possessed a secret book. At the time of my ascension, I concealed it atop the Three Mao Peaks of Mount Juqu in Jiangnan. You must go and retrieve it.\"\n\nSeveral years later, I was appointed to govern Jinling and made a special pilgrimage to the mountain’s summit. At midnight, divine light spanned the heavens. Digging deep, about three *zhang* down, I found a stone casket containing a silk scroll roughly six or seven *zhang* in length, mixed with fine sand from Penglai. Having obtained it, I arranged it into twenty-four sections to transmit to the world.\n\nIn the winter of the bingwu year of the Jingkang era, while residing in Piling, I received a jade decree to transmit this record, permitting the succession of the Dragon-Tiger lineage. The rites of the yang realm and the retributions of the yin realm are thereby made manifest—this surpasses all else. Thus, I know that this Great Teaching is the original vow of the Mysterious Origin and the sagely masters, unlike other methods. For later learners, unless they receive the golden words and purple characters from the divine mouth, they will never be able to wear this teaching.\n\nLater heirs of the teaching, small in attainment, should contemplate the *Natural Ascension Diagram*. Then, they may depart from all talismanic methods. Within a single breath, they can communicate with the true and reach the numinous, subdue demons and vanquish monsters, deliver the dead and rescue the suffering—all these become easy matters. Be reverent, be reverent.\n\n*Recorded by Lu Shizhong, Master of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of Supreme Clarity.*\n\n**End of Scroll One of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n*Scripture Title:* *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Two of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Two: The True Master’s Precepts and Disciplines**\n\nThe Master says: Precepts and disciplines are the safeguards for beginners.\nIn high antiquity, there were no precepts, yet one could cultivate the Dao and attain perfection.\nIn middle antiquity, there were no disciplines, yet one could awaken to the true and realize the Dao.\nIn later ages, the human heart is drowned by material desires, and innate nature is obscured by false thoughts. Thus, precepts and disciplines arose.\n\nYet precepts are the most difficult for beginners to uphold. Therefore, the former sages first used disciplines to restrain them. Only after disciplines are not violated can one speak of observing precepts. Now, those who inherit the teaching and aspire to the realm of immortals—how could they fail to observe precepts? Thus, I record the precepts but not the disciplines.\n\nTo not see what is desirable keeps the heart from disorder—this still depends on precepts.\nBut when, though seeing what is desirable, the heart remains undisturbed—what need is there for precepts?\n\n**Three Great Precepts for Ascending the Hall**\n**First Precept: Against Lustful Thoughts**\nThe Master says: In cultivating the Dao, precepts come first.\nLust is easy to preclude; lustful thoughts are difficult to preclude.\nTo ascend to perfection, first preclude lustful thoughts. When the heart is unmoved, lust will not arise.\nThus, the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: \"Immortals and Daoists are not divine; they accumulate essence and amass qi to attain perfection.\" These are not empty words.\n\n**Second Precept: Against Worldly Thoughts**\nThe Master says: The toils of the worldly drown the six roots.\nThe so-called roots can generate branches and leaves. Wherever they touch, they grow, day by day, the branches and leaves multiplying. When the roots of worldly dust are strong and large, one becomes stained by external things—this is called \"dust-strength.\" External things are also called \"dust-strength,\" and external things are also called \"consciousness.\" Where there is consciousness, there is toil—this is called \"worldly toil.\"\nDo not cling to the forms of all phenomena. Thus, the *Scripture for Protecting Life* says: \"Purify the six roots and sever all demonic obstructions.\" This is the meaning.\n\n**Third Precept: Against Deluded Intentions**\nThe Master says: To preclude worldly toil, first preclude deluded intentions.\nWhere consciousness arises, delusion follows; where intention moves, dust is born.\nThus, in the course of a day, whether deviant or upright, all involve thought. Where thought arises, intention follows—this is deluded intention.\nTo preclude intention, make the heart like the bright moon at midnight or the limpid waters of an autumn pool—serene and undisturbed. Then delusion will be settled.\nThus, the *Scripture of Purity* says: \"Clarify the heart, and the spirit will naturally be clear.\"",

Let none of these be violated.\n\n**Fifth Precept: The Ears Do Not Listen to Chaos**\nThe Master says: All words of right and wrong, as well as perverse and improper matters, are best left unheard.\n\n**Sixth Precept: Wine Does Not Lead to Drunkenness**\nThe Master says: Wine disrupts the true and corrupts nature; one must not become excessively intoxicated.\n\n**Seventh Precept: Lust Does Not Stir the Passions**\nThe Master says: Those of lesser attainment may not yet fully abstain, but they must not indulge in base or obsessive desires.\n\n**Eighth Precept: Qi Is Not Used Recklessly**\nThe Master says: Human qi and blood thrive in stillness and stability; one must not allow the spirit and heart to race wildly.\n\n**Ninth Precept: The Nature Does Not Give Rise to Anger**\nThe Master says: The nature is inherently tranquil; anger harms it, and when the nature is harmed, the spirit departs. The *True Records* states: \"A volatile and violent nature is the thief and sickness of the entire body.\" Even when anger is unavoidable, constantly reflect on restraining it, and joy will naturally arise.\n\n**Tenth Precept: Against Envy**\nThe Master says: The human heart, driven by selfish desires, generates envy when others surpass it. Scholars must not allow envy to take root. Let another’s glory be as one’s own.\n\n**Eleventh Precept: Against Jealousy**\nThe Master says: This is the same as envy.\n\n**Twelfth Precept: Against Greed**\nThe Master says: Beyond what is needed for clothing and food, all else is superfluous. One must not covet beyond what is sufficient.\n\n**Thirteenth Precept: Against Stinginess**\nThe Master says: All things beyond the body belong to worldly toil. One should always use them to aid others and never be miserly.\n\n**Fourteenth Precept: Against Arrogance**\nThe Master says: The Dao resides in humility, modesty, and reverence. When encountering others, always treat them with respect.\n\n**Fifteenth Precept: Against Pride**\nThe Master says: When favored, think of disgrace; when at ease, contemplate peril. The slightest emergence of pride and falsity damages and depletes one’s fortune and virtue.\n\n**Sixteenth Precept: Against Deceit**\nThe Master says: Even in the darkness of a room, act as though being observed; never allow deceitful thoughts to arise.\n\n**Seventeenth Precept: Against Flattery**\nThe Master says: The Dao values truth and uprightness; one must not engage in sycophancy or obsequiousness.\n\n**Eighteenth Precept: Against Licentiousness**\nThe Master says: Beyond the bounds of propriety and constancy, one must not transgress ritual.\n\n**Nineteenth Precept: Against Desire**\nThe Master says: If something does not belong to you, do not let desire arise.\n\n**Twentieth Precept: Against Theft**\nThe Master says: Coveting wealth is theft. One must always refrain from unjust gain, let alone outright theft.\n\n**Twenty-First Precept: Against Pursuing Influence and Contending for Fame**\nThe Master says: One must not rely on power to intimidate or chase after fame and profit.\n\n**Twenty-Second Precept: Against Indecent Exposure Before the Stars and Improper Worship of Spirits**\nThe Master says: When relieving oneself day or night, do not face the heavens or turn north. When passing by spirit shrines, do not wander or linger. Entering a temple in such a manner is improper.\n\n**Twenty-Third Precept: Against Killing Living Beings and Destroying Life**\nThe Master says: Plants possess life; animals possess destiny. Do not kill or destroy them.\n\n**Twenty-Fourth Precept: Against Consuming the Six Pungent Foods**\nThe Master says: The six pungent foods repel the spirit and qi, disrupting the true origin. They must not be eaten.\n\nThe above twenty-four precepts may be upheld by both the secular and the Daoist.\n\n**Rules and Prohibitions for Ascending the Hall**\nThe Master says: Those who ascend the hall, having already upheld the precepts, must also understand the rules and prohibitions. Without them, the constant teachings and methods will fall into disorder, and the Dharma will not be revered. Thus, those who inherit the teachings must cultivate a nature like jade—warm, lustrous, and flawless.\n\nFor those who inherit the teachings: In the presence of the Most High, they are called disciples; in the Three Realms, they are known as true officials. Disciples are called \"students of the true,\" and those who study the true must first cultivate the body. The essence of cultivating the body lies in eliminating selfish desires, refining the spirit, and nurturing the formless to replenish insufficient vitality. Only when vitality is abundant may one seek the Dao of immortality and receive the teachings.\n\nThe teachings are not transmitted without the offering of words and the submission of faith; one is not ordained without swearing oaths before heaven and earth. Those who recklessly transmit or receive them will be investigated by the Three Officials and punished by the Four Departments.\n\nWhen receiving the teachings, one must revere and honor the ordaining master, treating them with the ancient rites due to a father. In this age, some sell the Dharma for profit, treating their ordaining masters with less respect than servants. Those who study the true must remember that the Celestial Master of Han is far beyond reach and cannot be seen. Those who transmit the teachings of the Celestial Master are the ordaining masters—accord them respect, never slighting or belittling them.\n\nWhen transmitting the teachings and presiding over the altar, overseeing the various Dharma instruments, only those with innate destiny and immortal bones may attain this. If one’s resolve does not remain unwavering from youth to old age, the teachings must not be transmitted. Those who are fickle and insincere must not receive ordination.\n\nWhen establishing an altar or oratory, choose a place free of graves or cremated remains, not in grand halls or spacious chambers. In bustling cities, select a quiet and broad street. If near a noisy marketplace, ensure the altar is built in a pure location, without needlessly serving the gods. For one who becomes a teacher to humans and heavens, even the spirits and ghosts beneath the earth will submit and serve. If one privately tends to incense and offerings, the Three Officials will investigate and impose penalties.",

      "translated_text": "One should regularly sit upright in an empty chamber, burning incense and silently circulating the qi, so that the Four Controllers descend, the Five Emperors attend at the window, and the immortals and perfected ones draw near. One must constantly study and savor the profound and mysterious, recite and contemplate the teachings, so that the true spirits descend into one’s body. Then the heavenly demons will serve and revere one as a true official, and in the past, one will not be bound by the earthly bureaus but ascend directly to the Upper Palace of Nanchang.\n\nAs a teacher of the Three Realms, one must not enter temples for leisure. If unavoidable, one must not flatter or sacrifice to demonic spirits. Instead, one should silently pay homage to the Three Realms, and blessings will naturally follow. Those who violate this will have their transgressions recorded by the Three Officials.\n\nBefore being called a teacher, one may only receive the *Ten Scrolls of the Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method of the Ancestral Teachings of One’s Altar*, to assist the true teaching. When one’s merit and conduct become illustrious, one advances to the Seventh Rank of the Jade Hall. Only when the heart remains unwavering does one progress to the Ninth Rank. After advancing through the Ninth Rank without fault, one then receives the *Three Rushing Registers*. Upon receiving all twenty-four ranks in full, one becomes a teacher of humans and heavens.\n\nWhen performing purification rites and offerings, one is called the *Orthodox One Wondrous Purification*.\n\n**Ranks of the Jade Hall:**\n- **First Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings*, one assists the Celestial Master in matters under the Jade Hall.\n- **Seventh Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings, True Official*, one serves as the Five Envoys—Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, and Central Yellow—convening affairs of the Three Heavenly Courts.\n- **Ninth Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Successor of the Teachings, True Official*, one serves as the *Great Dharma Master of All Heavens* and the Envoys of Great Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Jade Clarity.\n- **Twenty-Fourth Rank:** Known as *Jade Hall Inheriting Teacher*, *Jade Hall Presiding Teacher*, *Jade Hall Perpetual Inheriting Teacher*, and *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings*, one then ascends to *Jade Hall Golden Gate Attendant of the Celestial Throne*.\n\nThose above the rank of *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings* are all inheriting teachers, bearing titles such as *Perfected of Observant Illumination and Responsive Dao*, *Perfected of Profound Wonder and Empty Clarity*, *Perfected of Cavernous Clarity and True Unity*, and *Perfected of Radiant Vision and Self-Illuminating*. Only after inheriting the teachings for three cycles without fault and attaining a form akin to that of an immortal may one be so addressed.\n\n**Jade Hall Offices:**\n- **First Rank:** *Under the Jade Hall of the Celestial Master*.\n- **Middle Rank:** *Jade Hall Inheriting Teaching Altar*, *Jade Hall Grand Master of Teachings Altar*.\n- **Upper Rank Inheriting Teacher:** *Executive Office of the Supreme Mystery Capital*.\n\n**Petitions:**\n- To the *Three Clarities’ Imperial Mysterious Master*, all are memorialized.\n- To the *Heavenly Courts of the Upper Realm*, all are reported.\n- To the *Five Marchmounts of the Middle and Lower Realms* and below, all are issued writs.\n- To village altars and the like, all are sent missives.\n\n*Volume Two of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method concludes.*\n\n---\n\n**Volume Three of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Three: Preserving the True and Cultivating Attainment**\n\nThe Master said: The human heart is deluded and confused, submerged in passions and desires, clinging to dusty realms and ceaselessly pursuing them, like a traveler lost on a desolate road, unaware of where to return. Thus, this method is established to gather the wandering mind. In this way, the heart of desire gradually departs, and the true origin may return. Only then can one ride the void and command qi, exiting the manifest and entering the unmanifest.\n\nYet once the true origin has returned, the Dao is near to me—why go to such lengths?\nThe Master said: Sight and hearing leak the qi of the original spirit. Thought and worry scatter the essence of the original yang. Cravings deplete the spirit of the original harmony. Those who study the higher path, in moments of leisure, should silently gather their vision and return their hearing, contain the true within and inwardly observe, restrain desires and moderate emotions—then the immortal Dao is near.\n\n**Daily Absorption of the Three Lights’ Upright Qi**\nThe Master said: Each day at dawn, face the sacred direction and offer incense, absorbing the qi according to the method—this is most wondrous. If sitting calmly without distractions, in a quiet chamber with a settled mind, one may perform this with eyes half-closed. \"Half-closed\" means not fully shutting the eyes.\n\nThe Master said: Press the left thumb against the upper joint of the middle finger to form the *Sun Lord Mudra*, recite the *Sun Lord Mantra* nine times, hold the mudra before the heart, and inhale the sun’s qi through the nose. Visualize the sun’s five colors entering the five viscera, then swallow the qi along with it.\n\nNext, change to the *Moon Lord Mudra* by pressing the left thumb against the upper joint of the fourth finger, recite the *Moon Lord Mantra* nine times, hold the mudra before the heart, and inhale the moon’s qi through the nose. Visualize its five colors entering the five viscera, then swallow the qi along with it.\n\nNext, press the left thumb against the base of the second finger’s nail to form the *Celestial Stem Mudra*, recite the *Celestial Stem Mantra* seven times, place both hands on the knees, tilt the head back, and visualize the Great Crimson Heaven, from which the Celestial Stem hangs with ten thousand *zhang* of fiery light, fine as silk, crackling with sound. Draw it fully into the mouth, and if any light remains, let it cover the body. Then swallow the qi and store it in the cinnabar field.\n\n**Morning Audience at the Jade Hall to Greet the Original Qi**\nThe Master said: When a student of the true has matters to report, one should enter the chamber, sit upright, and visualize oneself as a sphere of true qi, radiant as the bright moon. Within this light, see the Golden Gate within the Mysterious Capital Mountain, where there is a White Jade Hall, and the Elder Lord within. Ascend the hall and pay homage.\n\nThe incantation says:\n*Concluded, see the Elder Lord between the brows, light dividing into sun and moon, illuminating me. I inhale it into my mouth, visualize golden light enveloping my body. Heaven is clear, earth is level, sun and moon shine bright. I ride the original qi, ascend to greet the Heavenly Lord. The Heavenly Lord bestows upon me a body of light. The original qi of the Mysterious Origin eternally preserves my long life.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Concluded, swallow the saliva and withdraw.*\n\nThe Master said: Practicing this regularly, whenever one has matters to report, the inner and outer will align, and one will communicate with the true and summon the numinous.\n\n*On auspicious days of original yang, pay homage at the Jade Hall. Sun and moon bathe me, refining my soul and spirit. Three thousand hairs, twelve thousand radiant essences. United with the Dao in truth, refining my golden chamber. Gathered within me, equal in length to heaven.*",

      "translated_text": "**Restraining the Corpse-Spirits and Seven Po**\n\nThe Master said: When yang wanes and yin waxes in a person, when desires and passions deplete the original essence, it is always because the Three Corpses and Seven Po disturb and disrupt the celestial truth. On every *gengshen*, *jiazi*, one’s own birthday, and the evenings of the fifth, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of each month, the three hun-souls become unsettled—*Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, and *Youjing* drift and wander, their radiance scattering, their forms dissolving. The hidden essence stirs in chaos, and all three hun-souls abandon the body, roaming the bedchamber or becoming ensnared by external malevolence, seized by ghosts and spirits, unable to return. Far from their corporeal form, the two qi engage in strife, drying and scorching the inner child, giving rise to illness and disordering the true origin—all stems from this. Those who cultivate the truth must, on these days, restrain and retain them to prevent their escape.\n\nThe method of restraint: lie down in repose, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, and hold the breath for three cycles. Then, knock the teeth three times. Visualize a red qi, the size of a chicken’s egg, rising from within and emerging through the mouth. Let the red qi enter the left and right eyes, then exit again. Expand the red qi until it envelops the body above and below, transforming into fire that burns through the self, inside and out, until a faint warmth is felt. Knock the teeth three more times and call the names of the hun-souls: *Shuangling*, *Taiguang*, *Youjing*. Recite the incantation:\n\n*Within the Mysterious Palace of the Great Tenuity,\nThe Primordial Yellow and First Green.\nRefine the three hun within,\nLet Taiguang be at peace.\nThe divine chamber, the Jade Hall,\nBorn with me as one.\nDo not stir recklessly,\nWatched over by the Great Numinous.\nIf you wish to fly and wander,\nGo only to the Upper Clarity.\nIf you hunger or thirst,\nDrink the Mysterious Water and Jade Essence.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Hold the breath.*\n\nWithin the Mud-Pill Palace, sun and moon shine brightly. Sleep in stillness. Practice this regularly, and yang will flourish while yin wanes. The Corpse-Spirits will be restrained, the hun-souls and spirits will be strong and at peace. No illness will invade—this is the ladder to seeking immortality.\n\n*Great Spirit of Taiguang,\nCelestial Lord of the Imperial Net.\nHolding the embryonic talisman,\nWearing a purple crown.\nYellow revolves, red essence,\nAscends to the Gate of Life,\nTransforms the spirit, returns to life.*\n\nThe Master said: On the new moon, full moon, and last day of each month, the Seven Po roam and consort with ghosts and demons, wasting and toying with the original yang. They often cause people to be erratic in joy and anger, unstable in sorrow and worry, indulgent in lust and pleasure, constantly deluded and confused, creating the roots of illness and obstructing progress on the Dao. The method to restrain the Po: on those evenings, lie down in repose and stretch the feet. Cover the ears with both hands, interlocking the fingers atop the head. Hold the breath seven times. Visualize a white radiance at the tip of the nose, the size of a small bean, gradually expanding until it crowns the body in nine layers. After a long while, it transforms into two blue-green dragons within the eyes, white tigers in the nostrils, a vermilion bird in the heart, and a tortoise and serpent beneath the feet. Two jade maidens, clad in brocade, hold flames before the ear gates. Swallow the saliva seven times and call the names of the Seven Po: *Shigou*, *Fushi*, *Queyin*, *Tunzei*, *Feidu*, *Chuhui*, *Choufei*. Recite the incantation:\n\n*Visualize the sun in the heart,\nThe moon in the kidneys.\nThe two qi intertwine their light,\nForming an infant to guard the cinnabar field.\nNine layers of plain qi,\nRestrain the Po and govern their release.\nCelestial beasts guard the gates,\nJade maidens hold the passes.\nRefine the Po to harmony and softness,\nLet them be at peace with me.\nDo not stir recklessly,\nObserve and examine the source of form.\nIf you hunger or thirst,\nDrink the sun’s yellow and the moon’s cinnabar.*\n\nAnother incantation says:\n*Ingest the Heavenly Sovereign’s Life-Preserving Talisman in peace.*\n\nThe true qi lingers,\nThe nine portals shine open.\nThe Corpse-Spirits and Po are restrained,\nForbidden to come and go.\nRefine yang and exchange qi,\nGuard the numinous terrace in haste.\nExternal malevolence cannot intrude,\nThe inner truth returns of itself.\nGathered and undispersed,\nThe yang radiance returns to the womb.\n\n**Heavenly Sovereign’s Life-Preserving Talisman**\nWrite in cinnabar on yellow paper, face east, and ingest.",

      "translated_text": "The Master says: Those who study immortality must pacify the mind and nurture the spirit, ingesting and refining to cure illness, filling the brain palace to its fullness so that the primordial essence does not tilt. Only then may one preserve the spirit and practice the breathing of the Two Radiant Ones. If one frequently engages in sexual union, the qi becomes defiled and the spirit flees, essence withers and the body is exhausted. Thus, true immortals first abstain from lust. If one does not abstain or restrain oneself, even with diligent practice, one cannot replenish the depletion—this is merely lending qi to a moving corpse. If you can abstain from excess and purify the heart, then practicing this method may lead you into the wondrous subtleties of the High Ascent.\n\nThe *Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Three, ends here.\n\n---\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n*Scripture Title:* *Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource of the base text: *Daoist Canon*, *Methods* section of the *Dongzhen* division.\n\n**Supreme Mysterious Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Four**\n**Chapter Four: The Inner Realm of the High Ascent**\n\nThe Master says: Those who study the supreme Dao and aspire to immortality must rely on the essence of the sun and the radiance of the moon to refine and complete the immortal way. Without the mysterious practice, none can unite with the real. This so-called \"essence and radiance\" is not sought from without but is the true attainment of one’s own body. Daoist methods have a thousand gates and ten thousand doors, winding paths and side trails, with杂说纷繁冗杂. Thus, many learners abandon the real for the false, forsake the internal for the external. The longer they practice, the harder it is to achieve success. Now, the High Ascent of the sun and moon is the wondrous teaching transmitted by the Most High to the ancestral masters of later times. In ancient times, it was passed down only orally, without reliance on written words. Now, it is specially recorded in writing so that those of later generations with karmic affinity may easily seek and investigate it. Thus, the *Huangting [Neijing]* states: \"In the High Ascent of the sun and moon, I ascend the Dao; Yu Yi and Jie Lin guard me well.\" This is what it means.\n\nThe name of the sun’s *hun* is the Jade Emperor, with the jade taboo-name.\nThe Five Emperors wear robes of five-colored brocade and jade capes, with flying feather skirts and lotus crowns.\n\nWithin the sun:\n- The Green Emperor’s taboo-name is *Yuán Cháng Yuán*, his style *Zhào Lóng Tāo*.\n- The Red Emperor’s taboo-name is *Dān Líng Zhì*, his style *Lǜ Hóng Yìng*.\n- The White Emperor’s taboo-name is *Hào Yù Jiāng*, his style *Huí Jīn Xiá*.\n- The Black Emperor’s taboo-name is *Chéng Zēng Tíng*, his style *Xuán Lǜ Yán*.\n- The Yellow Emperor’s taboo-name is *Shòu Yì Fù*, his style *Biāo Huī Xiàng*.\n\nThe names of the inner spirits of the Five Emperors’ *hun* essence are *Zhū Jǐng*, their style *Chì Tóng Chì Qì*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord’s taboo-name is *Jiāng Jūn*, his style *Gāo Qiān Shuǎng*.\n\nThe name of the moon’s *pò* is the Five August Ladies, with the jade taboo-name.\nThe Ladies all wear three-cornered buns with hair hanging to the shoulders, robes of five-colored brocade capes, and dragon-phoenix flying feather skirts.\n\nWithin the moon:\n- The Green August Lady’s taboo-name is *Yǐn É*, her style *Fēn Yīng Yàn*.\n- The Red Qi August Lady’s taboo-name is *Yì Yì Liáo Wú*, her style *Wǎn Yán Xū*.\n- The White August Lady’s taboo-name is *Líng Sù Lán*, her style *Yù Lián Huá*.\n- The Black August Lady’s taboo-name is *Jié Lián Qiáo*, her style *Chún Lì Jīn*.\n- The Yellow August Lady’s taboo-name is *Qīng Yíng Jīn*, her style *Gèn Dìng Róng*.\n\nThe Supreme Dao Mother of the moon’s yellow qi has the taboo-name *Dào Yào Zhī*, her style *Zhèng Huì*, and is titled *Tiáo Fūren*.\n\nThe name of the inner spirit of the *hun* essence is *Ài Xiāo*, its style *Tái Biāo*.\n\nThe Master says: The taboo-names of the sun and moon’s *hun* are most secret. The Most High concealed the names of the sun and moon in the Purple Terrace Jade Palace; those who know them communicate with the spirits. At dawn on the first day of the lunar month, sit upright, purify the fast, and settle the mind. Knock the teeth thirty-six times. First visualize one’s own cinnabar field as a great sea, with the sun rising from the sea. One’s own body sits atop the crown of the head, the body like a mountain of stone.\n\nRecite the incantation:\n*\"Yang arises from the primordial sea,\nRising from below.\nThe chaotic yang essence\nDispels the host of yin.\nWithin is a great spirit,\nThe Lord Yu Yi.\nDescend with this true qi,\nBathe my form.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times. Next, visualize the sun ascending in golden light, illuminating and reflecting one’s true form, which ascends to the sun palace.\n\n*\"The golden pivot radiates auspiciousness,\nPervading the brilliance of yang.\nThe flaming light soars and flies,\nFlowing essence for ten thousand miles.\nDemon vapors extinguish their flames,\nDust and filth are swept clean.\nSoaring through emptiness, stepping on qi,\nI ride the qi to ascend on high.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times. Next, ride the fire dragon to rush to the sun palace. The fire dragon leads the way, piercing the crown with flying light. The spirit enters the realm of nothingness, paying homage to Yu Yi. In the blink of an eye, ascend and merge with the numinous radiance. The one true follows its origin, burning away the corpse of Peng.\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, swallow the saliva nine times, and contemplate entering the sun palace, the entire body becoming one. After a long while, forget the form, melting like spring. Practicing this for one year dispels illness, commands ghosts and spirits, and comes and goes naturally. After two years, one communicates with immortals and receives the attendance of the Three Realms. After three years, the Demon King vouches for one. After nine years, the practice is complete, and the Five Emperors befriend one. A decree is issued to appoint one as a Perfected, and one attains longevity.\n\nThe Master says: Once the student has practiced the Way of Rushing to the Sun, next visualize oneself as Mount Kunlun, sitting atop the mountain’s peak, with a great sea below and the moon’s wheel newly risen. Swallow the saliva three times and knock the teeth three times.\n\nRecite the incantation:",

The source of saliva flows freely, its brilliance illuminating the jade chamber. Qi grows in luminous abundance, and one’s service enables flight.\n\nIncantation:\n*(Incantation concluded, swallow saliva nine times.)*\n\nNext, visualize the moonlight as a half-crescent, its golden light shining upon one’s body. The radiance disperses into the Celestial Pond, gold and water forming a half-crescent. The light illumines the dark night, shining upon my mysterious pearl.

Thus, the sages say: \"Entering and exiting within the Dipper, the body grows strong and qi flourishes, extending years and increasing destiny—all evil shuns one.\" They also say: \"All methods emerge from the Dipper, and all spirits are commanded by the Dipper.\" Thus, every method and practice cannot connect with the true or respond to the numinous without the Dipper’s truth. Therefore, the sagely masters necessarily teach ascending the Dipper and pacing the stars, hoping that students may communicate with immortals, attain the true, preserve the origin, and guard existence.\n\nThe essence of the Great Star is named the Mysterious Pivot Spirit, called the Yang Brightness Hun, or the Celestial Pivot Hun. Its spirit ascends as the Celestial Grand Commandant, governing the correction of transgressions. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ Flying Immortals; below, it commands those who study immortality, as well as the spirits of heaven and earth.\n\nThe essence of the Origin Star is named the Northern Terrace Spirit, called the Yin Essence Hun, or the Celestial Rotator Hun. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Grand Steward, governing rank and emolument.

Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Minister of Works, governing immortals. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ lofty Perfected Ones; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ numinous immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Pivot Star is named the Mysterious Root Spirit, called the Dark Obscurity Hun, or the Celestial Balance Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Mobile Strike General, governing the punishment of rebels. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ ghosts and spirits; in the middle, it commands the Northern Emperor’s Three Officials; below, it monitors the myriad multitudes.\n\nThe essence of the Mainstay Star is named the Great Peace Spirit, called the Cinnabar Origin Hun, or the Jade Balance Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Dipper Lord, governing life records. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ registers; in the middle, it governs the ghosts and spirits’ ledgers; below, it commands those who study the true.\n\nThe essence of the Chronicle Star is named the Life Mechanism Spirit, called the Northern Culmen Hun, or the Open Yang Po. Its spirit is the Dipper Heaven’s Grand Master of Ceremonies, governing advancement. Above, it oversees the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Perfected Ones; in the middle, it supervises the Five Peaks’ Flying Immortals.\n\nThe essence of the Pass Star is named the Origin Yang Spirit, called the Celestial Pass Hun, or the Shaking Dipper Great Brightness. It governs the Supreme Emperor of Heaven, controlling the mechanisms of heaven and earth’s fortune and misfortune.\n\nThe spirit of the August Jade Emperor is called the Eight Radiances Void Origin Lord. The spirit of the Great Tenuity Jade Emperor Lord is called the Seven Essences Seven Spirit Lords. Those who behold these two stars attain longevity; those who cultivate them become immortals.\n\nThe Master says: Regularly on the twenty-first night of the month, enter the chamber at midnight, connect with the settled qi, close the eyes, and inwardly gaze. Then, one’s entire body slowly rises, flying upward into the Dipper’s bowl, sitting with one’s back to the Perfected One. After a long while, one senses one’s body within the Dipper. Exerting utmost effort, one feels heat within the body—this is the true qi harmonizing with virtue. Visualize the Dipper’s purple light descending upon one’s body, illuminating both inside and out. Once one has arrived within the Dipper, sit with one’s back to the Perfected One. Then, proceed to pay homage to each star, reciting the prayer:\n\nTo the first, the Great Star’s essence, the Mysterious Pivot Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, riding the void and steering the floating.\nTo the second, the Origin Star’s essence, the Northern Terrace Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, roaming the Jasper Terrace.\nTo the third, the True Star’s essence, the Nine Ultimates Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, governing the Three Mysteries.\nTo the fourth, the Pivot Star’s essence, the Mysterious Root Supreme Perfected: May my jade name be listed among the Flying Immortals.\nTo the fifth, the Mainstay Star’s essence, the Great Peace Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, ascending to Highest Clarity.\nTo the sixth, the Chronicle Star’s essence, the Life Mechanism Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, my name inscribed in the Great Tenuity.\nTo the seventh, the Pass Star’s essence, the Origin Yang Supreme Perfected: May I attain flight as an immortal, commanding the Jade Lads.\nTo the eighth, the August Star’s essence, the Highest Jade Emperor Lord: May I attain flight as an immortal, ascending the Hall of the Latter Sage.\nTo the ninth, the Venerable Star’s essence, the Great Tenuity Jade Emperor Lord: May I attain flight as an immortal, entering the cinnabar chamber and jade palace.",

Yet when demonic spirits grow frenzied, when malevolent gods transform and shift, harming people and creatures, mocking the true Dao—then, as a last resort, the ultimate statutes of restraint are established.\n\nFor the adept, cultivation and realization must come first. Once one attains the subtleties of the real, ghosts and spirits will rise in reverence, the Three Realms will submit in devotion—how could one then rely on awe and severity to govern?\n\nThe Master said: Before the first kalpa unfolded and heaven and earth first took shape, primordial qi circulated, and people lived in benevolence and longevity. But as yin waned and yang dissipated, ghosts and spirits gradually arose. From the celestial winds above to the springs and soil below, they manifested in myriad forms across all directions, all born of wayward qi in creation, inheriting the baleful shapes of heaven and earth. They spread poison and practice perversity, acting as their nature dictates.\n\nThus, even the stellar palaces have their ghosts, capable of causing disasters. Heaven and earth, too, have their ghosts, who oversee human fortune and misfortune. The sixty cyclical days each have a deity presiding over them. Their retinues include thousands of ghosts and ten thousand demons, flying through the world. Heaven can give them life but cannot entirely extinguish them—hence this method is used to govern them.\n\nYet this canon represents the ultimate punishment of the heavens and must not be employed lightly.\n\n**Register of Ghosts and Demons**\nThe Ten-Thousand-Zhang Ghost of High Heaven, king of the hundred common ghosts, surnamed Xi, celestial name Six Directions, dwells in the waters southeast of Mount Tai.\n\nThe Three Elders of the Southern Village, lords of the Daoist dead, surnamed Che, named Ni, reside northwest of Mount Tai. They oversee the ledgers of the dead, examine the sins of the living, command official subordinates, and can also harm people.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Northern Dipper, clad in black above and below, seven thousand zhang in height, surnamed Wu, named Huan.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Dipper’s Web at Midnight, nine zhang tall, dressed in red, nameless, responsible for slaying traitors and rebels across the world.\n\nThe Executioner Ghost of the Supreme Unity, formless and nameless, one zhang and six feet tall, clad in red.\n\nThe Celestial Three-Five Executioner Ghost, named Gui, one zhang and seven feet tall, dressed in white with a red headband, wielding a halberd.\n\nThe Great Ghost of the Northern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Ban, named Wan.\n\nThe Ghost of the Western Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Zhuo, named Qiu.\n\nThe Ghost of the Southern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Ming, named Wen.\n\nThe Ghost of the Eastern Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Jiao, named Che.\n\nThe Ghost of the Central Dipper’s Three Terraces, surnamed Wang, named Xian.\n\nThe five Dipper ghosts above record human transgressions and often bring calamity and slaughter upon people.\n\nThe Master of the Five Dipper’s Reversed Executioner Ghosts, named Xu.\n\nThe Ghost of the Five Directions’ Direct Talisman, named Jie Tian.\n\nThe Celestial One’s Long-Harming Descendants Ghost, named Gao Bi.\n\nThe Celestial Flying Long-Ensnaring Ghost, named Liang Tian.\n\nThe above ghosts are regularly dispatched by the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor to investigate human sins, and they constantly dwell among people. These are called Celestial Demons. Each initially took form from the qi of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, unlike lesser specters. To offend them brings great harm. They may be restrained by talismans but should not be killed.\n\n**The Heavenly Emperor’s Talisman for Restraining Celestial Demons**\nThe talisman employs the Jade Clarity mudra on yellow silk. Worn or displayed, it ensures peace and auspiciousness.\n\nThe Master said: Long ago, the High Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Wenchang Lord of the Dao, rode a cloud-dragon treasure chariot, a jade carriage with wheel-rims of nephrite, its canopy tilted and axle turned, ascending the sacred Mount Emei. There, he saw the people of the lower realms oppressed by various demons and ghosts. The ghosts were numerous, their names diverse, roaming the world and slaughtering the innocent. Thus, he established the method for slaying ghosts and restraining demons to govern them. One who knows a ghost’s name will never suffer its harm; calling its name three times, the ghost will perish of itself.\n\nJiazi: Yuan Guang.\nYichou: Bing Zhang.",

Their forms span three *zhang*, and they bring harm to the imperial subjects. Knowing their names, ghosts dare not approach. Calling their names thrice, they weep and flee a thousand *li*. There are talismans to subdue and control them.\n\nTo subdue the **Great Year Ghost Generals of Yin-Yang of the Jiazi Era**, the talisman is a celestial secret, guarded by three thousand **Heavenly Ding Soldiers of the Three Heavens** and sixty-four **Jade Maidens**. To restrain and subdue them, one must inscribe the **Great Slayer Text** in black on yellow paper and make a petition—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Worldly Ghost Names:**\n- **Mountain Spirit:** Zhuo Nei\n- **Wood Spirit:** Qun Yao\n- **Stone Spirit:** Pi\n- **Monkey Spirit:** Ma Li Ze Hao\n- **Celestial Tree:** Fang Yu\n- **Fox Spirit:** Jia Fa Gan\n- **Great Mountain:** Gong Qiang\n- **Lesser Mountain:** He Bing\n- **Brick and Stone:** Yue Su\n- **Pomegranate Wood:** Xia Tuo\n- **Ghost Lust:** Zai Zhi\n- **Woman Lust:** Jie Jiao\n- **Blue Qi:** Wen Gao Yuan\n- **White Qi:** Wen Bo Lai\n- **Red Qi:** Wen Shi Xuan\n- **Black Qi:** Wen Wen Duan\n- **Yellow Qi:** Wen Jun Tai\n- **House and Chamber:** Yao Zi\n- **Qi-Eater:** Hou Fu\n- **Latrine:** Xiang Fu\n- **Well:** Rong Qiong Jiu\n- **Kitchen Hearth:** Gui Rang Gan\n- **Bed and Couch:** He Zi\n- **Umbrella and Canopy:** Yan\n- **Banner and Pennant:** Tuo\n- **Sound of Peng:** Luan\n- **Sheng and Reed Pipes:** Gou\n- **Halberd:** Yi Er Qin\n- **Sword and Blade:** Zi Fu\n- **Armor:** Zi Xian\n- **Millennial White Bones:** Yuan Shi\n- **Centennial White Bones:** Yin Chu\n- **River Earl:** Da\n- **Four Waterways:** Hou\n- **Three Rivers:** Jian\n- **Iron Spirit:** Ming Yi Yuan\n- **Metal Spirit:** Ming Yi Chong\n- **Bronze Vessel Ghost:** Yang Sha\n- **Pillar Wood:** Wen Luo\n- **Clothing and Garments:** Shi Lian\n- **Five Colors:** Ti Jing\n- **Tomb Earl:** Gong Xia Hou\n- **Tomb Ghosts:** Two Thousand Later\n\nAll these ghosts traverse the world, relying on forms and borrowing natures.

The **Most High** possesses methods to restrain them—they dare not stir, fleeing at the sound of their names and scattering at the sight of talismans.\n\n**Northern Emperor’s Fire Bell Toss to Annihilate Demons and Slay Ghosts—Supreme Talisman**\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The Northern Emperor commands, burning the ghost camps.*\n*Slaying demon ghosts, severing evil spirits.*\n*The Heavenly Ding soldiers advance boldly, casting fire and ringing bells.*\n*Foul smoke billows, crimson flames blaze bright.*\n*The Three Realms are pacified, all forms destroyed for ten thousand li.*\n*Those who dare disobey are swiftly sent to the Dark City.*\n*Bound by wind blades, eternally sunk in the Nine Ramparts.*\n*No pardon is granted—execute upon talisman’s arrival.*\n*Hasten to obey the Northern Emperor’s decree!*\n\n**Three Heavens Demon-Slaying Jade Script**　**True Emperor’s Spirit**\n\nThe above **Ghost-Slaying Talisman** is inscribed in cinnabar on red paper. To subdue demons and slay ghosts, address the **Ghost-Slaying Demon-Restraining Generals and Scribes**, burning the petition in the central courtyard. That night, black winds and fierce rains will arise, and the ghosts will perish of themselves. If there is wind without rain, the ghosts flee a thousand *li*. If there is neither wind nor rain, the entity is no great demon or evil spirit, and the celestial authorities will not execute the extreme penalty. Take note—this must not be taken lightly.\n\nOnce the retribution is complete, inscribe the **Jade Script** in cinnabar on yellow paper, or on *xiang* wood, to permanently secure the land. Welcome the **qi of life and prosperity**, ensuring no further demonic afflictions.\n\n**The Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method** concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Mystery, Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty.

Banners, pennants, standards, and their measured movements—these are the affairs of outer ritual. Yet when sincerity unites with truth and application is seamless, one becomes a companion to Heaven and Earth. Even so, outer ritual is still required to discipline the realm.\n\nIn every bow and rise, every advance and retreat, all that the eye sees and the ear hears must be proper. With no opening for wayward thoughts, one may communicate with Heaven and truly reach the **Supreme Emperor**. Thus it is said: *Model Heaven, emulate Earth, and imitate the world’s dignified conduct*—then all actions will be solemn and respectful.\n\nFor altar and meditation rites, the structure has three tiers, reflecting the distinction between the **Heavenly Honored** and the lowly earth. On the altar’s upper tier stands the **Vacuous August**, the **Celestial Treasure Flower Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain**, where the **Three Treasures and Imperial Masters** are enshrined. To the left, the **Banner of the Heavenly-Appointed Demon-Subduing** is erected; to the right, the **Standard of the Lion and Evil-Expelling**. On the left of the left, the **Talisman for Communicating with Truth** is placed to descend the thousand truths. On the right of the right, the **Talisman for Reaching the Spirits** is set to summon the ten thousand spirits. In the center, the **Three Dawn Talismans** are displayed to connect with the myriad *qi* and dispel demonic miasmas.\n\nTo the east of the altar, plant the **Blue Dragon Banner Talisman**; to the west, the **White Tiger Banner Talisman**; to the south, the **Vermilion Bird Banner Talisman**; to the north, the **Dark Warrior Banner Talisman**. In the five directions, arrange the **Jade Talismans for Pacification and Stabilization**—this constitutes the uppermost tier.\n\nIf three tiers are not used, arrange them according to the directions within the hall or palace. If ascending three tiers, the middle tier is set with eight gates:\n- **Northwest:** **Cloud Jade Vacuity Truth-Communicating Gate**\n- **Due North:** **Clear and Cold Mysterious Unity Gate**\n- **Northeast:** **Tranquil and Natural Gate**\n- **Due East:** **Azure Florescence Beginning Gate**\n- **Southeast:** **Pure Harmony and Rigorous Yang Gate**\n- **Due South:** **Pure Yang Blaze and Radiance Gate**\n- **Southwest:** **Earth Compliance and Metal Harmony Gate**\n- **Due West:** **Rigorous Brightness and Luminous Splendor Gate**\n\nOn the lower tier, the twelve *qi* are arrayed:\n- **Zi Position:** **Dark Heaven’s Dense Beginning Qi**\n- **Chou Position:** **Northern Origin’s Natural Qi**\n- **Yin Position:** **Evil-Expelling and Demon-Dispelling Qi**\n- **Mao Position:** **Beginning Azure and Flourishing Origin Qi**\n- **Chen Position:** **Yellow Spirit’s Lofty Mystery Qi**\n- **Si Position:** **Tranquil Spirit’s Serene Quiet Qi**\n- **Wu Position:** **Fiery Truth’s Descending Brilliance Qi**\n- **Wei Position:** **Central Unity’s Congealed Truth Qi**\n- **Shen Position:** **Profound Harmony’s Solemn Brilliance Qi**\n- **You Position:** **Firm Rectitude’s Plain Harmony Qi**\n- **Xu Position:** **True Origin’s Nurturing Spirit Qi**\n- **Hai Position:** **Returning Yin to Face Truth Qi**",

Thus, their true origin is submerged. Amidst their frantic rushing about, they cannot commune with the true or reach the numinous—how lamentable!\n\nTherefore, this chapter on \"Communing with the True\" is established, employing ritual dignity to guard against external distractions. Through the secret practice of incantations and hand seals, the scattered mind is gathered, so that the Dao may be revered through solemnity, and the heart may stand in awe through sacred forms, lest one fall into delusion and disorder.\n\nAs for those who cultivate immortality—whose minds are empty and natures still, whose Dao is complete and true—when a single thought moves, the hearts of the Two Heavens merge as one. Even so, they may rely on external ritual to commune with the true; how much more should they observe this with care!\n\n**Talismans for Offering Incense to the Ten Directions**\n\nThe Master said: The jade talismans of the ten directions are the secret methods for summoning the Brahmā, inviting the true, communing with the numinous, petitioning the Emperor, and beseeching grace. At dawn, face east; at noon, face south; at dusk, face north. Visualize the *qi* of each direction filling the sacred altar.\n\n**East:**\nSwallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth nine times. Visualize green *qi* like clouds entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nNine *qi* of green origin,\nRiding fragrant smoke in flight.\nSummon the true, reach the numinous,\nGuard me as I ascend as an immortal.\n\n**South:**\nSwallow saliva three times, knock the teeth three times. Visualize red *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nThree *qi* in harmonious ascent,\nPurple *qi* suffuses the firmament.\nThe Crimson Plowman turns his chariot,\nThe spirit ascends beyond all bounds.\n\n**West:**\nSwallow saliva seven times, knock the teeth seven times. Visualize white *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nSeven *qi* of radiant brightness,\nWestern true ones, golden well.\nThe Emperor’s chariot swiftly descends,\nPreserving life, rooting its essence.\n\n**North:**\nSwallow saliva five times, knock the teeth five times. Visualize black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nThe Black Emperor holds authority,\nFive *qi* of the Great Mystery.\nLush and auspicious mists arise,\nRushing toward my immortal flight.\n\n**Northeast:**\nSwallow saliva four times, knock the teeth four times. Visualize green-black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nBrahmā *qi* arises naturally,\nPaying homage to the Most Exalted.\nPreserving and uniting life’s *qi*,\nPacifying the demon gate.\n\n**Southeast:**\nSwallow saliva six times, knock the teeth six times. Visualize green-crimson *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nTrue *qi* unites with yang,\nDescending to the jasper altar.\nA thousand true spirits gather,\nFlying into the Jade Hall.\n\n**Southwest:**\nSwallow saliva eight times, knock the teeth eight times. Visualize red-white *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nNuminous *qi*, clear and bright,\nUniting with the Dao to realize truth.\nSubduing demons, executing the wicked,\nPaying homage to the flying spirits.\n\n**Northwest:**\nSwallow saliva twice, knock the teeth twice. Visualize white-black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nUpright *qi*, vast and boundless,\nJade light of the mysterious altar.\nCorpse-demons perish and fall,\nPaying homage to my Primordial Emperor.\n\n**Above:**\nSwallow saliva twice, knock the teeth twice. Visualize golden-light *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nAuspicious *qi* descends upon the altar,\nDescending true ones, summoning immortals.\nThe Gate of Life opens above,\nEmbodying the Emperor’s precedence.\n\n**Below:**\nSwallow saliva ten times, knock the teeth ten times. Visualize black *qi* entering the altar.\n*Incantation:*\nUpright *qi* surges forth,\nDispelling evil, repelling miasma.\nTrue visions well forth,\nDescending true ones, summoning the numinous.\n\nThe Master said: After completing the incense offerings to the ten directions, establish the earthly portal and burn the talisman for entering the portal. Recite the incantation silently. After entering, take three steps with each movement, visualizing oneself amidst the Brahmā *qi* and numinous light above the Nine Heavens, utterly unaware of the mundane world.\n\nAt this point, inwardly observe, gather the spirit, and return the hearing. Be cautious not to look back, cough, or spit. Proceed directly to the grotto altar, offer incense three times, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and burn the talisman for communing with the true. Visualize green, yellow, and white *qi* of three colors emanating from within oneself.\n\nOne must visualize offering incense three times. With each offering, visualize three-colored *qi* emerging from the crown of the head, forming a flower canopy that ascends to the Three Heavens. Then, open the incense burner.\n\n**Talisman for Communing with the True at the Grotto Altar**\n*Incantation:*\nPure *qi* forms heaven,\nTurbid *qi* forms earth.\nCentral *qi* forms humanity,\nYin and yang unerringly balanced.\nWith the heart, commune with heaven,\nHeaven’s law is revered with utmost sincerity.\nCinnabar sincerity ascends,\n*Qi*-registers dissolve transgressions.\nFrom the beginning of profound obscurity,\nSwiftly transmit the communion with the true.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nIncense is the jade blossom scattering light,\nNine *qi* congealing into mist.\nFragrant clouds densely woven,\nDirectly piercing the Nine Heavens.\nVisualize the three-colored cloud canopy,\nRising with the smoke to reach the Three Heavens.\nThe Golden Lad attendant of incense,\nThe Jade Maiden transmitter of words.\nI now submit this petition,\nHeard before the Emperor.\nDescend light, bestow *qi*,\nCommuning with the true to attain immortality.\nLongevity and eternal vision,\nSins and transgressions all absolved.\nNine generations transcend suffering,\nAscending from the dark night.\nDemon kings vouchsafe,\nThe Three Realms attend the chariot.\nMerits and virtues fulfilled,\nAscending in a cloud-borne chariot.\nMoving in and out naturally,\nAttended and guarded by the Three Heavens.\nAll petitions and wishes,\nAre granted as spoken.\n\n**Talisman for Entering the Portal**\n*Incantation:*\nEntering to pay homage to the Emperor’s true ones,\nLife’s *qi* in ninefold layers.\nInterpenetrating the dharma-body,\nYin demons are not tolerated.\nThe Red Child of the Three Fields,\nPreserves my immortal merit.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman for Opening the Incense Burner**\n*Incantation:*",

When creatures lose their constancy, blossoms scatter and seedlings wither. When seasons lose their constancy, winter thunders and summer snows. These are but Heaven’s portents to issue warning—naturally, there exist methods of preservation and control.\n\nAs for the calamities of common folk, they differ from these. There may be twin-headed serpents writhing in combat, wild beasts entering homes, birds shrieking at rooftops, phantom voices echoing before and behind, strange hues shifting high and low, vipers and pythons blocking paths in frenzied entanglement, chickens and dogs crowing or barking out of season, looms suddenly tangling, doors swinging open on their own, foxes circling walls, dragons and serpents slithering into wells—such manifold omens cannot be fully recounted.\n\nFor the noble person, virtue overcomes malevolence. For the petty person, the self is no match for malevolence. When one’s power wanes, how can disaster be averted? Yet if exorcism is performed, will fortune not return? Thus arise the methods of repelling and subduing.\n\nThe Master said: When Heaven and Earth grow dark and murky, and dragons or mirage-beasts enter household wells, one should use talismans to suppress them. The malevolence will vanish of itself and be unable to cause harm.\n\n**Talisman for Repelling Dragons Entering Wells**\nAssume the Northern Emperor Mudra, wield the *qi*-charged brush, recite the Dipper Taboo seven times, face the *gang* and inscribe the talisman on a fresh brick, then cast it into the water where the creature lurks.\n\n**Talisman for Repelling Serpents Entering Wells**\nProceed with the same method as above.",

After inscribing the talisman, recite the *Great Exorcism Mantra* seven times to consecrate it.\n\n**Mantra:**\n*With the Sword Mudra, seven times—sprinkle water upon the afflicted.*\n*\"August Heaven births me, Heaven is my father.\nAugust Earth bears me, Earth is my mother.\nSun and Moon harmonize in aid, above and below the Dipper shines.\nThe Northern Dipper’s *Kui Gang* slays evil in ten thousand directions.\nDemons shall not become specters, evil shall not bring calamity.\nThose who violate this talisman shall die; those who defy it shall perish.\nMysterious Yellow generates *qi*, universally bestowing good fortune.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars—destroy demons, slay specters—by decree!\"*\n\n**Additional Mantra:**\nBefore reciting, first direct the *qi* of the Three Lights to envelop the afflicted in a net of radiance. Then chant the mantra seven times, commanding the afflicted to retreat nine steps. Point the Dipper’s handle at them, summon them before you, and sprinkle water thrice. Affix the talisman to their person, and all specters shall forever cease their mischief.\n*\"The Most High issues the decree: slay ghosts, eliminate harm.\nHeaven is my canopy, Earth is my foundation.\nThe Northern Dipper’s starlight is my raiment.\nLeft *Gang*, right Fire—banish and restrain inauspicious forces.\nReturn misfortune to fortune, dispel disaster and repel harm.\nNo evil shall invade; specters and demons shall retreat.\nSee the specter yet not be alarmed—its power shall crumble.\n*Yuan Heng Li Zhen*—ten thousand years of prosperity.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the True Fire of the Crimson Heaven—by decree!\"*\n\n**Chapter Ten: Expelling Evil and Upholding Righteousness**\n\nThe Master said: *\"Harmonizing the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth is called a talisman. Humans receive the proper balance of yin and yang to be born—this is the Three Lights. Whenever cold, heat, wind, or summer heat transgress and cause injury, the transgression deviates from the upright; deviation from the upright becomes evil—not merely a curse, but a fundamental disorder. It must be remedied with the *qi* of the Three Lights. Thus it is said: Harmonizing the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth is called a talisman. The Three Lights are how Heaven enacts transformations and governs spirits and demons. Therefore: the Sun is the essence of all yang; the stars are the essence of all yin; the Moon receives yang to shine. Where the Three Lights illuminate, rain, snow, and gloom dissipate without obstruction; fox demons and monstrous birds scatter without provocation. The sages and revered masters, borrowing the truth of divine incantations, looked upward to draw the essence of the Three Lights. We, too, harmonize them with sincerity, and the talisman unites with their numinous power. When yin evil encroaches upon a person—becoming a specter, a monstrosity, an illness, or a plague—it is like rain and snow manifesting, like fox demons and monstrous birds encountering broad daylight: it need not be driven away to vanish without a trace. Though talismanic scripts are many, which surpass the Five Lights? Thus, the Three Lights are placed first.\"*\n\n**Talisman of the Three Lights**\nThis is the *Ancestral Talisman of the Three Lights*, the origin of all methods and the honor of the Three Realms. It annihilates all evil, preserves and harmonizes true *qi*, and its virtues cannot be fully described. A hundred thousand myriad transformations all emerge from this talisman, so its application is simple yet it is the foundation of all methods. Inscribe it in cinnabar on a square inch of lightweight paper, prepare three copies, and swallow them with jujube decoction. It cures all demonic afflictions and is called the *Talisman for Subduing Curses and Curing Evil*.\n\nThe Master said: *\"Uprightness does not become evil. Thus, the method that destroys evil is the upright method. There is no need to curry favor with ghosts and spirits—it rests solely with the ritual master. Cultivate the Three Realms in the mind, ingest the Three Lights, and when inner cultivation is full, external evil will naturally submit.\"*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Canopy and Golden-Browed Lord Lao’s Transformation**\nFirst visualize a golden light within the crown of the head. Lord Lao’s brows respond, his face golden. The practitioner silently recites the *Heavenly Canopy’s* original mantra once, twice, thrice, and beholds the Golden-Browed Lord Lao ascending into the void, transforming into the true form of the Heavenly Canopy. Recite the original mantra, then inscribe the talisman’s *qi*-slaying form with the brush. With a single stroke of the divine blade, write the Sword Talisman, followed by the command characters. *\"Hastily obey the Northern Emperor’s decree!\"* Use the Northern Emperor’s Mudra, inscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, one foot and six inches in length, and fumigate the afflicted.\n\n**Talisman of the Dipper’s *Kui* and Great Virtue’s Fire**\nFirst visualize the Seven Stars of the Dipper in the sky, the *Gang* star pointing forward. Step into the Dipper, absorb *qi* into the abdomen, and feel warmth. Then begin writing, exhaling *gang qi* to guide the brush. Inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Three Primordials’ Ding-Jia Response Talisman**\nWhen inscribing this talisman, step into the Dipper to greet the *Gang*, visualize the Celestial *Gang* on the red paper, grind cinnabar facing the sun, grasp the *Gang* Mudra, and inscribe with a single breath. When dispatching the talisman, burn gold coins and *Jia* horses beforehand.\n\n**Seven Slayings Talisman**\nThis talisman possesses great power, subduing fierce evil, destroying malevolent shrines, and eliciting divine responses—its wonders cannot be fully described. Step into the Dipper, grasp the Dipper Mudra, inscribe with *qi*, paper, and ink, face the *Gang*, exhale fire to activate it, and burn it in the central courtyard. This talisman has been corrected by the Three Heavens and proclaimed to ancestral altars, with extraordinary efficacy.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The Seven Slayings Talisman has been transmitted through the ages, but its talismanic script was unclear, and many uses failed. Now, with the rise of the Teaching Master and the flourishing of the Great Teaching, all Northern Pole talismans and documents from the Jade Altar have been requested, decreed, and bestowed here. Scattered, its form is wondrously subtle; gathered, its form is mighty and brave.\"*\n\n**Dipper-*Gang* Talisman**\nThis talisman is simple yet divinely efficacious, requiring no embellishment or elaborate application. Formed into pills, it can be ingested or fumigated; when worn, *Gang* fire spans the heavens, and ghosts and spirits dare not approach. Use the Dipper Mudra and northern *qi*.\n\n**Talisman Summoning and Commanding Mantra**\n*\"Riding the *Kui*, opposing the *Gang*, blazing with dragon fire.\nAbove Heaven, below Earth—annihilate inauspicious forces.\nShould any dare resist, they shall be reduced to flying ash.\nPlunge ten thousand fathoms into the earth, follow the talisman’s path—never to return for ten thousand kalpas.\nSolemnly summon the Heavenly Generals within the talisman to accompany and guard it.\nThose who violate the talisman’s command shall be shattered by thunderbolts.\nFire decree, fire decree—by the Emperor’s command, act!\nFlowing fire for ten thousand miles—no ghost shall escape its form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, by decree!\"*\n\n*Concluding Volume Eight of the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n*Scripture Title:* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.",

      "translated_text": "Compiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty fascicles.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.\n\n*Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Fascicle Nine*\n*Chapter Eleven: Summoning and Subjugation of the Nether Prison*\n\nThe Master said: For those mountain specters lingering through kalpas, water spirits haunting for years, celestial demons and heterodox ways, blood-feasting deities, the Five Penetrations beneath trees, vengeful ghosts of execution and violent death—those who gather in bands, cling to ancient shrines, usurp imperial titles and call themselves kings, or presume to style themselves Grand Marshals; those who extort temple construction, drag forth village festivals, debauch women, occupy towers, drip blood and hurl bricks, manifest forms and set fires, afflict people with malignant illness, and swiftly seize living souls—such monstrous harms are beyond remedy by ordinary methods. In our great teaching, there is the method of the Nine Springs Nether Prison to govern them.\n\nThe establishment of the prison must not be undertaken lightly. First, one must receive a petition, then issue talismans to drive and govern the offender, and dispatch proclamations to announce the decree. If they fear the law and flee, permit them to reform and renew themselves, and there is no need to proceed with subjugation—only that the human realm may be at peace. But if the demonic spirits are defiant, resisting the true method and unafraid of talismans, then this method must be employed to govern them.\n\nThe Master said: To establish the prison, first memorialize the Supreme Emperor and the Northern Dipper Mansion’s Sagely Masters, dispatching celestial soldiers and officials to descend to the designated place, build the Nether Prison, and apprehend the demonic thieves. At night, select a clean chamber and use lime to delineate the prison’s boundaries. Then post proclamations, talismanic scripts, and notices. First, divide the sections and dispatch generals and officials to pursue and capture the demonic thieves, as well as to restrain the local earth gods, city gods, and subordinate spirit officials, all bound by the Middle Punishment Talisman. Set a time limit for their capture. Next, recite the *Spell for Capturing Ghosts* and patrol the prison. Place one lamp in each prison. At dawn the following day, the ritual master burns incense and performs the rites as before. Observe their traces, and if necessary, issue talismans to hasten the capture. If the demonic band is not fully apprehended, perform the rites again at night as before. During this time, on certain nights, one may hear the sounds of interrogation and punishment—be reverent and respectful. If after one or two days no traces are found, and it is the celestial demons or heterodox ways clinging to evil, one must again memorialize the Celestial Masters to urge the dispatch of officials, who will then surely appear. After seven days, the prison may be dismantled. If among them there are truly unforgivable demonic ghosts, those whose forms are to be destroyed must have a separate *Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar* constructed.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Nine Springs Prison**\nThe Master said: The Nine Springs are the Nether Springs of Fengdu in the Northern Capital, a prison for the wicked. This matter concerns the Celestial Court and must not be undertaken lightly. Thus, Fengdu is the office of all the world’s ghosts and spirits, wielding the authority to restrain and control demonic and malevolent forces. No proclamation of might is greater than this.\n\nThe prison consists of nine divisions:\n1. **Feng Spring Command Prison**\n2. **Heavy Spring Decapitation Prison**\n3. **Yellow Spring Pursuit Prison**\n4. **Cold Spring Poison Harm Prison**\n5. **Yin Spring Dark Night Prison**\n6. **Nether Spring Slaying Prison**\n7. **Lower Spring Eternal Night Prison**\n8. **Bitter Spring Massacre Prison**\n9. **Drowning Spring Interrogation and Burning Prison**\n\nEach of the nine prisons has its designated jurisdiction:\n1. The first prison governs celestial demons.\n2. The second prison governs negligent temple officials.\n3. The third prison governs mountain specters and goblins.\n4. The fourth prison governs river and lake water spirits.\n5. The fifth prison governs blood-feasting evil deities.\n6. The sixth prison governs the tree-dwelling Five Penetrations.\n7. The seventh prison governs corpses hidden in ancient tombs.\n8. The eighth prison governs sorcerers and rebellious ghosts.\n9. The ninth prison governs those who died by execution or violent death.\n\nBefore each prison, arrange Dipper Lamps, each one foot two inches in diameter, with a two-foot-four-inch *qi* path. Before each of the nine prisons, hang a *Talisman for Pursuing Ghosts*, and within, hang a *Heavy Punishment Talisman*. At the prison gate, suspend a bamboo pole three feet long, bearing the *Proclamation for Pursuing Ghosts*. At the main gate, hang the *Talisman for Blocking Ghost Roads*. Thrice daily, at the three periods, offer incense and perform the rites. At dawn, observe the traces to discern the nature of the ghost. For minor offenses, bind and restrain them; for greater offenses, condemn them to the Three Paths of heavy labor; for the gravest offenses, erase their traces and destroy their forms.\n\n**Talismans:**\n1. **Talisman for Blocking Ghost Roads** – Can subdue all evil, restrain and pacify the myriad demons. When placed in a residence, no evil shall intrude.\n   Write it with the *Northern Emperor’s Seal Script*.\n\n**Prison Talismans:**\n1. **First Talisman**\n2. **Middle Punishment Talisman**\n3. **Lower Punishment Talisman**\n   Use three talismans, written with the *Northern Emperor’s Seal Script*. Hang one in the prison, and use one to pursue ghosts. In ordinary times, they may also be used to guard residences—ghosts and spirits dare not look upon them directly, and those who do shall be bound and shackled.\n\n**Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar**\nThe Master said: The establishment of the *Great Mystery Demon-Slaying Altar* is the pivot of celestial punishment, subduing all flying and earthbound demonic spirits and malevolent beings, truly eradicating the ferocious deities of mountains, forests, temples, and shrines. This is not for those who have not truly violated our teaching’s laws—it must not be undertaken lightly.\n\n**Method for Establishing the Altar:**\nUse floating sand to draw a three-tiered altar. The top tier is one *zhang* wide, the middle tier two *zhang*, and the lower tier three *zhang*. If the space is confined, adjust as needed. On the top tier, arrange the Celestial Masters and the Four Saints. On the middle tier, outside the Heavenly Gate, array the various generals, and before the Heavenly Gate, place the demon-slaying generals and officials, surrounding them with spirit talismans. At the four corners, establish gates, beginning from the *Qian* position:\n1. **Qi of Expelling Corpses and Sweeping Away Wrongs** – Gate for the descent and summoning of celestial generals.\n2. **Qi of Drowning and Clarity**\n3. **Gate of Orthodox Unity for Driving Away Evil**\n4. **Qi of Primordial Green Yang Brightness**\n5. **Qi of Severing Ghosts and Cutting Off Demons** – Gate for the merging of immortals and entry into sagehood.\n6. **Qi of Red Brightness and Cavern Yang**\n7. **Qi of Longevity and Tranquility** – Gate for the entry and exit of living spirits.",

      "translated_text": "Eight: **Qi of Unyielding Rectitude and Stern Clarity**—Gate for the invocation of celestial generals.\n\nAt the Heavenly Gate, set up an incense table to summon and receive the descent of celestial generals. The Earthly Portal shall remain sealed to all passage, the ghostly paths forever closed, with only the Human Gate left open for transit. On the lower tier, array troops and cavalry in full encirclement, burning talismans morning and night. When the rite is performed with clarity for one or two days, the ghosts will perish of themselves, or one may hear the sound of wailing and weeping, or blood may be spilt upon the altar—all signs of its efficacy.\n\nThis method is not to be employed lightly, but reserved solely for cases of formidable demonic hordes, tangible apparitions, or monstrous anomalies that defy all other remedies.\n\n**Altar Design**\nThe Master says: Ghosts formed from the Five Phases and spirits attached to mountains and rivers do not rely on human souls to attain sentience. Objects crafted by human hands, if imbued with even fleeting potency, may over time become haunted, capable of shifting form and assuming guises to harm people and disrupt the world—often more pernicious than ordinary ghosts. Thus, the Most High established this singular method to subdue them.\n\nWhen erecting a demon-slaying altar, burn talismans at the Ghost Gate thrice daily, each time reciting the *Tianpeng* incantation and spraying the breath upon them. Within three days, profound responses will manifest.\n\nThis is a matter personally overseen by the Northern Dipper, of grave import—far beyond the scope of ordinary talismanic arts. It must never be invoked except in the face of the most extreme demonic infestations, lest severe retribution be incurred. Exercise utmost caution.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Mountain and Stone Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues mountain spirits, stone spirits, millennia-old steles, stone Buddhas, stone figures, stone beasts, stone tortoises, and stone dragons. Inscribe it in black ink on black paper and deliver it to the afflicted, then burn it at the site of the haunting.\n\nIf the spirit appears in human form, consorting with women or seducing men and women, await its arrival and burn this talisman upon its approach.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Wood Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues tree spirits, woodwights, millennia-old pine-dwelling ghosts, locust tree deities, wooden idols, wooden beasts, withered trees, and hollow trees that harbor spirits. Inscribe it in cinnabar on a slip of catalpa or cypress, then drive it into the tree, which will wither and die.\n\nIf the spirit manifests to harm the people, inscribe the talisman on yellow paper and burn it—the spirit will be violently destroyed.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Metal Spirits**\nThis talisman governs spirits of gold, silver, copper, and iron, including millennia-old bronze Buddhas and statues. If the day of their casting coincided with inauspicious or malevolent influences, true numen will not descend, and demonic forces will attach themselves instead.\n\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar on an iron plaque and secretly bury it beneath the statue—the ghostly spirit will flee, and the haunting will cease, regardless of whether the statue is later destroyed.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Water Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues all water spirits, including those dwelling in rivers, seas, lakes, marshes, deep pools, springs, and wells—such as jiao, shen, serpents, pythons, and wayward dragons—whose forms vary but all possess the power to stir winds and waves, capsize boats, and claim lives.\n\nIf they assume shapes to consort with women or seduce the living, burn this talisman, and the spirits will perish utterly. Inscribe it on yellow paper, affix it to an iron tablet, and cast it into the water before burning.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Subduing Ape and Spectral Spirits**\nThis talisman subdues all ape spirits—gibbons, macaques, foxes, wild boars—and spectral entities such as corpse-possessing dogs, oxen, horses, and other beasts with intact remains, collectively termed *xiao*.\n\nFor those afflicted by such spirits where other remedies fail, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on blue-green paper, then wear it, affix it, or burn it—the spirit will die of itself.\n\n**Talisman of the Northern Emperor for Slaying Blood-Consuming Demons**\nThis talisman subdues all blood-consuming demons inhabiting shrines, temples dedicated to ancient worthies, abandoned estates, empty halls, pavilions, and gardens—where malevolent ghosts gather in bands, usurping scenic sites, seizing dwellings, snatching souls, seducing women, invading dreams with feasts and songs, or possessing mediums to demand temples and sacrifices, committing myriad transgressions.\n\nInscribe this talisman in cinnabar on catalpa wood and drive it into the site. Then deliver another copy to the afflicted household to be nailed in the central hall—the demonic activity will cease.\n\nThough these six talismans govern distinct afflictions, their application is uniform. When inscribing them, visualize oneself as Tianpeng. When deploying them, do likewise. Apart from distributing talismans to households or nailing them in place, burn them thrice daily at the demon-slaying altar while reciting the *Tianpeng* incantation.\n\nTo execute a spirit, cut its talisman in two at the Ghost Gate—the entity will perish. Great omens will follow: wailing in the void, blood upon the altar—all signs of its efficacy.\n\nHere ends *Scroll Nine of the Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao*.",

      "translated_text": "**Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao**\n*Compiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.*\n*Source: Zhengtong Daoist Canon, Dongzhen Section, Methods Category.*\n\n**Scroll Ten of the Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and the Jade Hall of the Great Dao**\n**Chapter Twelve: Expelling, Purging, Exorcising, and Averting Calamities**\n\nThe Master said: To expel and dispel malign forces is called *gua*. To eliminate inauspicious and malevolent influences is called *fu*. To sever demonic bonds and break curses is called *guai*. To suppress misfortune and dissolve disasters is called *rang*. Though these four bear different names, their use in aiding the world yields the same benefit.\n\nAll who dwell between Heaven and Earth are bound within the Five Phases, and few escape their cycles of generation and destruction. Thus fortune and misfortune arise, and success or ruin, prosperity or decline, cannot be foreseen. Without the secrets of exorcism and averting calamities, how can one ensure enduring good fortune? For this reason, this chapter expounds upon these methods in detail.\n\n**Method for Subduing the Earth Duke and Earthbound Spirits**\nThe Master said: Since the Three Powers were divided and the Five Phases separated, the interplay of generation and destruction has given rise to fortune and misfortune. In all actions, regret and adversity follow—such is the work of the Earth Duke’s spirits, ever causing peril. When households construct dwellings, dig ponds, relocate mountains, or seal tombs, the deities govern every corner and direction. Should one violate their norms, disaster swiftly follows. Thus, the Most High has devised methods to subdue and pacify them, ensuring each remains in its proper place and no longer harms the living or invites calamity. The treatment is uniform; the methods are listed below.\n\n**Talisman for Pacifying Earth and Ensuring Safety**\nThis talisman is addressed to [Name], the Year Star of the *jiazi* cycle, and all deities under the Tai Sui. By command of the Most High, you are to comply: as [Household Name] undertakes construction, disturbing the spirits and baleful forces, upon receipt of this talisman, return to guard your respective directions, each resuming its rightful place. Avert misfortune, dissolve disaster, and bestow eternal good fortune. As decreed.\n\n**Talisman for Dispelling Earth Qi**\nThis talisman is specifically for subduing the Earth Duke and severing the one hundred and twenty baleful influences. When inscribing it, transform into the Heavenly Master, infuse the brush with *qi* of the Dipper, and blow upon it while writing. Inscribe in cinnabar on yellow paper and affix it to the central courtyard.\n\nThe Master said: For the method of subduing *fulian*, first arrange the Dipper’s image in a purified chamber, offer sacrifices to the *fulian* deities, and then have the household wear the talisman.\n\n**Talisman of the Most High for Severing *Fulian***\nThis talisman severs the male and female baleful forces. Place it in a crimson pouch and wear it.\n\n**Talisman for Prohibiting Mourning Visits and *Fulian***\nSeal the corners with yellow paper, inscribe in cinnabar, and announce its burning to the Tai Sui’s direction—auspiciousness will flourish.\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Tai Sui, baleful deities, malevolent forces, male and female baleful influences, *Sangmen*, *Diaoke*, and all such spirits. By this talismanic command, return to your original positions and cease allowing baleful influences to harm the living. As this decree takes effect, depart swiftly without delay. As decreed.\n\n**Talisman for Prohibiting Tomb Litigation**",

It opens the path for so-and-so, stabilizes their physical form, and nourishes their *ying* and *wei* protective qi, preventing the Earth Officials from driving or pressing upon them. As decreed by Woman Azure.\n\nThe Master says: In cases of tomb litigation, the household of descendants will not prosper, and misfortunes will frequently arise. It is fitting to employ this method to deliver the deceased ancestors, so that blessings may extend to descendants, and the afflictions of *yang zhu* will be forever dispelled.\n\nThe Master says: Take a fine stone, two feet and four inches in length and one foot and two inches in width. Engrave upon it the Five Talismans and bury it within the tomb, approximately thirty paces from the burial site, at a depth of three feet, in a pit three feet square. Each time a talisman is buried, recite the middle chapter of the *Divine Book*, perform the Yu Step to the *Kan* position, and inter it. This method can transcend and subdue yin corpses, extend blessings to descendants, bring prosperity to the household, and forever eliminate the afflictions of tomb litigation and *yang zhu*.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Curses**\n\nThe Master says: Those afflicted by curses will suffer from inverted hun and shen, scattered essence and po, external illnesses that linger, and may even meet their demise—truly pitiable. Some harbor private grudges and practice their malevolent arts in spirit halls or unorthodox temples, extending misfortune to descendants. There exists a method to exorcise such afflictions.\n\n**Eastern Azure Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Southern Vermilion Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Western White Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Northern Black Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n**Central Yellow Emperor’s Talisman for Dispelling Curses**\n\n**General Petition Formula for the Five Directions**\nInscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, perform the offering ritual, and then it shall be auspicious.\n\nThis talisman is addressed to the Eastern Curse Spirit Bureau to dispel the curses afflicting so-and-so’s household, the entanglements of vengeful oaths upon the clan, or self-inflicted curses that bring misfortune. By this talismanic command, swiftly depart to another direction. As decreed.\n\n**Method for Ensuring Progeny and Continuing the Lineage**\n\nThe Master says: When descendants are difficult to obtain, whether due to prolonged infertility, miscarriage, failure to thrive, or lack of intelligence, it is often because the feng shui of previous generations has unknowingly violated *guansha*, severing the generative qi. One should perform an offering to the Six Jia Direct Talismans, beseeching the issuance of a talismanic command to nurture the primordial qi, foster the growth of the spiritual root, and ensure the flourishing of descendants.\n\n**Talisman for Conception**\nThis talisman is for women who are barren or unable to conceive. It is fitting to establish a Six Jia ritual arena, inscribe the talisman facing the direction of the recipient’s life destiny, and have her wear it. Results will manifest within one hundred and twenty days.\n\n**Talisman for Protecting the Fetus**\nInscribe this talisman on yellow paper with cinnabar and have the pregnant woman wear it—it shall be auspicious.\n\n**Talisman for Securing the Birthing Chamber**\nInscribe three talismans on yellow paper with cinnabar and hang them in the birthing chamber, on the bed curtains, or where the mother rests. This will ensure no difficulties in childbirth.\n\nAll the aforementioned talismans should be inscribed while holding the Dipper Mudra, facing the direction of the prosperous *qi* of the *Gang*. Their efficacy will be as swift as an echo.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Ten—Concluded**\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource: *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Mystery and Primordial Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Eleven**\n**Chapter Thirteen: Extending Life and Delivering from Calamity**\n\nThe Master says: Alas! Those of shallow learning lose their minds in the realm of worldly toil, while officials in the marketplace bury their heads in the pursuit of profit and rank. They desire to prolong life but have no means to extend it; they wish to escape calamity but have no method to deliver themselves. Thus, fate is determined by destiny, and misfortunes arise from tangible causes. For all disasters and dangers, one should rely on exorcism and thanksgiving rituals.\n\nYet the ritual gates are vast, and the Daoist methods numerous. Their efficacy varies in depth, and their effects differ in speed. Only the teachings of the Jade Hall’s Orthodox Unity, passed down through the ages, open the gate to exorcising disasters and atoning for transgressions, revealing the secrets of preserving life and extending longevity. They enable the people to avoid premature death, each safeguarding their allotted years. Truly, they serve as a bridge to transcend the world and a refuge for humanity and the heavens—how could their merit be but a small contribution?\n\nThe Master says: For men or women suffering from deep calamities or grave misfortunes, afflicted by chronic illnesses and confined to bed, or entangled in official litigation with years of household unrest, it is fitting to purify the mind and perform an offering to the Northern Dipper. Follow the ancient method to arrange the altar: lay out four clean mats around the perimeter. Choose a secluded courtyard or quiet chamber, a place undisturbed by others, where one may concentrate the spirit and sincerely invoke a response.\n\nPlace the true image against the northern wall, spread the altar before it, and position the Seven Primordial Lamps at the center. Arrange the offerings around the perimeter. Select auspicious days such as the Three Primordials, Eight Nodes, one’s life destiny birthday, the Northern Dipper’s Descending Day, the Five La Festivals, the Two She Festivals, *Gengshen* or *Jiazi* days—provided they do not conflict with the Emperor’s Harsh Days—to ensure the ritual’s efficacy.\n\nThe method for petitioning the Dipper requires submitting the memorial a day in advance and also invoking the Two Immortals, Qing and Tuo, to descend and inspect the altar site. When the night deepens, perform the ritual according to the prescribed rites. Do not let the mind wander or the proceedings falter—surely, a favorable response will manifest.\n\n**Required Items**\nNone may be omitted. As for the altar’s stabilizing offering, it may vary according to one’s means—presence or absence is not an issue, and thus it is not specified here.\nFour mats.\nNine candles.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: The scriptures state that the Southern Dipper governs the Li Palace, its name shared with the sun, and the spirit it bestows upon humans is called the *hun*. It presides over the yang offices, administering the Fire Emperor, and in its dynamic application, no virtue surpasses it. Together with the Northern Dipper’s Seven Governors, it shares the duty of governance. In times of urgent peril, one should perform rites of thanksgiving to the Southern Dipper, arranging torches and bright lamps as in the Northern Dipper’s method. Now, the Northern Dipper’s rites include both supplication and requital, for it holds life and death in particular gravity—hence its methods are especially detailed. The Southern Dipper, however, is the office of life’s augmentation, governing blessings and longevity, and thus concerns itself solely with the entreaty of grace. Without talismans, one cannot summon its response; without incantations, one cannot unite with its numen. Therefore, this section again sets forth the ritual method, appending the Dipper’s lamps, banners, and talismans below.\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Mansion’s Director of Destinies, Supreme General and True Lord Who Guards the Realm**\n*Incantation:*\nDirector of Destinies, True Lord,\nPreserve my long life.\nLet no calamity assail me,\nLet my nine orifices shine with light.\nMay you descend true *qi*,\nAnd unite with this talisman.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Appearance’s Registrar of Records, Supreme Minister and True Lord Who Guards the Peaks**\n*Incantation:*\nRegistrar of Records, True Lord,\nPreserve my thousand years.\nLet ten thousand *qi* shine with light,\nGuard my true form.\nMay you descend true *qi*,\nAnd preserve me in spontaneity.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Beam’s Prolonger of Life, True Lord Who Protects Destiny**\n*Incantation:*\nProtector of Destiny, True Lord,\nGuard my *hun* and essence.\nSever the roots of death,\nRestore my *qi* to its primal origin.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nAnd unite with your servant in numinous union.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Uniformity’s Increaser of Years, True Lord Who Preserves Life**\n*Incantation:*\nBestower of Life, True Lord,\nAugment my years of longevity.\nLet harmonious true *qi* flow,\nNurturing the spirit with refinement.\nMay you descend upright *qi*,\nTo preserve my life and truth.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Pivot’s Deliverer from Adversity, True Lord of Literary Florescence Who Refines the *Hun***\n*Incantation:*\nRefiner of the *Hun*, True Lord,\nCultivate and forge living beings.\nTransform the yin corpse through refinement,\nTransmute mortals into immortals.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nAnd let my destiny soar in cycles.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Talisman of the Heavenly Mechanism’s Supervisor of Life, Grand Minister and True Lord of Great Principle**\n*Incantation:*\nTrue Lord of Great Principle,\nProlong life and deliver destiny.\nShield the body, preserve life,\nDispel misfortune and scatter calamity.\nMay you descend life-*qi*,\nThat I may pass through kalpas unscathed.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nFor each, visualize the star’s radiance and grasp the corresponding hand seal:\n*Midnight, Ox, Midday, Lake, Fire, Horse.*\nInscribe banners on yellow silk with cinnabar, and suspend them beneath each lamp’s position. Further, inscribe on yellow paper with cinnabar, then burn and scatter the talismans into each lamp’s bowl.\n\nThe Master said: When presenting offerings to the Southern Dipper, arrange six lamps and torches. At the time of the rite, further dispatch six talismans, inscribed on red paper with yellow ink, using the same hand seals as before:\n1. Talisman of the Director of Destinies\n2. Talisman of the Registrar of Records\n3. Talisman of the Prolonger of Life (Talisman of the Protector of Destiny)\n4. Talisman of the Preserver of Life\n5. Talisman of the Refiner of the *Hun*\n6. Talisman of the Grand Minister\n\n**Talisman of the Six True Lords’ Vermilion Chariot and Jade Conveyance**\n*Incantation:*\nThe heavens possess radiance,\nThe Southern True Lords’ jade brilliance.\nShed light to protect destiny,\nDeliver from adversity and avert wrongdoing.\nToday is most auspicious,\nAs we behold the numinous presence.\nDescend with the lamps’ glow,\nDispelling darkness with splendor.\nAugment my years of longevity,\nGrant me the immortal’s term.\nRelease me from suffering,\nSever my Three Corpses.\nMay I attain long life spontaneously,\nChewing the mysterious fungus.\nSwiftly descend in cloud-borne chariots,\nTo attend the imperial chariot.\n*Hasten, hasten, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!*\n\nVisualize each star’s blazing, molten *qi*—neither purple nor white, neither gold nor jade, but its natural hue—descending into the lamps to seek numinous verification. If the adept wishes to entreat the recording of years, circumambulate the lamps three times, silently recite the incantation, and burn the talisman in requital. If the lamp’s flame grows by an inch, one has obtained the sign of long life.\n\n**Talisman for Prolonging Life by Entreaty to the Lamps**\nCircumambulate these six lamps, burn six talismans, and regard brightness as auspicious. If the flames grow long and red, one has received the proof of long life.\n\n*Thus concludes Volume Twelve of the* Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method.",

      "translated_text": "**Title:** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Compiled by:** Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty\n**Thirty Scrolls**\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category\n\n**Scroll Thirteen of the** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Chapter Fifteen: Severing Pestilence and Cutting Off Epidemics**\n\nThe Master said: People born into this world recklessly muddy body and mind, deluded by desires and cravings, unable to circulate and nurture their *qi*. Thus, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness injure them from without, while excess and exhaustion deplete them from within. This causes the four great elements of the body to scatter and *qi* to wane, weakening strength and wearying the spirit.\n\nWhen essence and *qi* falter, primordial *qi* is no longer secure, and epidemics arise. Yet if one regulates daily life to avoid cold and heat, moderates diet to nourish the transient body, and severs lustful thoughts to secure primordial essence, then true *qi* will not scatter, blood and *qi* will circulate freely, and one will enter the Dao and commune with the real. How then could one suffer from malignant diseases or seek methods to subdue them?\n\nThus the *Medical Classic* states: *\"If one does not fall ill with pestilence in spring, it is because one stored essence in winter.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nNow, out of compassion, the Most High establishes methods of subjugation to save the people of the latter age, that they may avoid untimely death and be spared from violent demise, ascending to benevolence and longevity—this is the Most High’s fundamental heart of cherishing life.\n\nThe scriptures say: In times past, people were benevolent, righteous, and pure, free from malice, untouched by untimely death, and ghosts did not harm them wantonly. But in this latter age, the era is degenerate, human hearts are corrupted, the five emotions are in chaos, and doubts multiply. People act at will, distrusting proper teachings and embracing perverse conduct. They turn from truth to falsehood, abandon the Dao and benevolence, defy heaven and earth, slaughter living beings, are disloyal and unfilial, devoid of love and compassion. They harm lives and accumulate karmic adversaries, inviting calamities to spread, families to suffer epidemics, and bodies to endure toxic *qi*, bringing illness and death to all.\n\nFor this, the *qi* of the Six Heavens, the Lord of Northern Fengdu, the marshals of the ghost legions, the generals of the human realm, and the deities of the Five Peaks traverse the world, bearing the burden of their transgressions. They release toxic *qi* to slay the wicked.\n\nThus the Most High established methods of control. The *Laws of Lady Green* states: *\"If one knows the names of the pestilence ghosts, they dare not cause harm. Call their names thrice, and the ghosts will perish of themselves.\"*\n\n**Eastern Green Pestilence Ghost:** Liu Yuanda, essence of Wood, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of malign wind.\n**Southern Red Pestilence Ghost:** Zhang Yuanbo, essence of Fire, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of heat toxin.\n**Western White Pestilence Ghost:** Zhao Gongming, essence of Metal, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of black flux.\n**Northern Black Pestilence Ghost:** Zhong Shiji, essence of Water, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread diseases of malignant toxin.\n**Central Yellow Pestilence Ghost:** Shi Wenye, essence of Earth, leading ten thousand ghosts to spread malignant sores and swellings.\n\n**Eastern Pestilence Ghost:** Jiu Da\n**Southern Pestilence Ghost:** Shi Yan\n**Western Pestilence Ghost:** Yao\n**Northern Pestilence Ghost:** Tian Xia\n**Central Pestilence Ghost:** Da Huangnu\n**Sixth Pestilence Ghost:** Zhu Nü\n**Seventh Pestilence Ghost:** Bo Ling\n\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Paternal Grandfather:** Liang Zhou\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Paternal Grandmother:** Jiao Cheng\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Father:** Yan Nian\n**Pestilence Ghosts’ Mother:** Chu Zhong\n\nThe five directional pestilence ghosts, seven brothers in all, together with their grandparents and parents, total eleven forms.

For ordinary people, *yin* waxes and *yang* wanes—this is the way of ghosts. Thus, the scriptures say: ghosts lurk in obscurity, belonging to the *yin* kind. The multitude of the netherworld, the spirits of the departed, endure sorrow and bitterness, having lost their original luminosity and entered the nameless darkness. Therefore, the Most High established these rites, employing lamplight to convey *yang* *qi* and entrusting true *qi* to sacred talismans. Relying on the radiance of the Dharma torch, it disperses the blind redemption of the nether paths. In the eternal night of the Yellow Springs, all shall behold the light of *yang*. This is the Most High’s profound grace, a merciful absolution for the lower ghosts—how could one not revere it?\n\nThe Master said: In the primordial chaos before the beginning, heaven and earth were unformed, the sun and moon unborn—thus, the boundless expanse was devoid of light. When the One *qi* divided into Two, and the Two *qi* divided into Three, heaven and earth took their places, the sun and moon came into being, and light penetrated the obscure, giving rise to the myriad transformations. Therefore, at the inception of a ritual for delivering beings, one emulates the luminosity of heaven, earth, sun, and moon—using lamps to dispel darkness and *yang* to scatter *yin*. First, visualize the *qi* of one’s cinnabar field and sea of primordial *qi* glowing like a millet grain. Next, visualize the *qi* entering the heart, then ascending to the *Niwan* (mud-palace). Distribute the light of the sun, moon, and stars to universally illuminate the ten directions. Above heaven and below heaven, no obscurity remains—all is bathed in light. The spirits of the departed ride this luminosity, leaving the darkness behind.\n\n**The Dharma Master’s Method for Dividing Lamps and Transforming the Three Luminaries Diagram**\n**Moon Wheel Manifesting Auspicious Jade Talisman**\nUse the Moon Sovereign’s Mudra, gather *qi*, and entrust it to the talisman. When dividing the lamps, ignite paper as a bright candle and visualize the process according to the method.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"True water settles in mysterious clarity, the primordial *qi* just beginning to arise.\nThe white soul shines upon the diagram’s scene—Lady Nuanxiao is her name.\nFlowing light pervades the obscure alleys; the Jade Hare bears the Silver Toad.\nRadiant splendor of the two poles, interreflecting the distant Jade Towers.\nGathering *qi* to part the eternal gloom, divine light dances in *yang*’s flourish.\"*\n\n**Sun Luminance Illuminating the Golden Talisman**\nUse the Sun Sovereign’s Mudra, gather *qi*, and entrust it to the talisman. When dividing the lamps, ignite paper as a bright candle and visualize the process according to the method.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Golden Crow scatters crimson light, *yang* *qi* permeates the ten directions.\nGreat brilliance blazes in the central heaven; the Three Realms pay homage to the Primordial Emperor.\nThe Five Thearchs guide the *yang* essence; the vermilion radiance soars in the Flowery Chamber.\nAll *yin* has already dissipated; the true scene refines the primordial net.\nIlluminating the Eternal Spring realm, it naturally connects to the Emperor’s land.\"*\n\n**Star-Splendor Radiating the Luminous Treasure Talisman**\nUse the Dipper Mudra.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*\"Starlight is heaven’s embryo, weaving *qi* to unfold divine radiance.\nThe Dipper’s bowl turns the central heaven; the pivot mechanism revolves the Primordial Emperor.\nBelow, it shines upon the ten-directional realms—even the obscure night is filled with light.\nThe souls of the departed leave the dark night, riding the light to refine true *yang*.\"*\n\n**Jade Capital’s Universal Light Dispelling Darkness Treasure Talisman**",

Then, bow in reverence, recite the *Sutra of Salvation* once, and draw the sun’s Merciful Sovereign into your mouth to empower the brush as you write nine talismans.\nWhen breaking open the hells, cast one talisman into each direction, then proclaim the talisman’s decree.\nThe decree is a layered talisman found in the *Chapter on Salvation by Sound*.\nOutside the circular image, within the halo of light, Grand Unity sits upon a lion, sprinkling water.\nFor each use, prepare a talisman on light yellow paper, eight inches long and five inches wide. Grind cinnabar facing the sun and inscribe it as before.\nCast one talisman per hell.\nWhen casting, visualize yourself as the Merciful Sovereign, facing the dark prison. Guide the talisman’s light to shatter it, forgetting your own form—seeing only that you are the Heavenly Worthy.\nThus, with focused intent, the nine hells will resonate, and the ritual proclamations will be announced.\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Wind-Thunder Hell of the East**\nWhen breaking the hell, use the *Jade Clarity Mudra*, face east, and part the hair with the *Gui Mao* mudra. Visualize the blue *qi* within your body, riding the talisman’s light as you transform into the Heavenly Worthy, entering the dark prison to save the suffering souls. The other directions follow this pattern.\n\n*\"Blue *yang* generates *qi*, its light illuminating the Mystic Terrace.\nThe Primordial Worthy’s great compassion descends upon the Wind-Thunder Hell.\nFlying spears scatter; tortures and interrogations cease.\nThe Most High swiftly pardons—souls ascend to Jade Clarity.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Fire-Haze Hell of the South**\nFace south with the *Gui Wu* mudra.\n\n*\"Three *qi* of cinnabar blossoms illuminate the south.\nThe Fire-Haze Hell naturally cools.\nFlying sweet dew and dharma rain flow with fragrance.\nSpirit-souls are at ease, ascending to the land of blessings.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Vajra Hell of the West**\nFace west with the *Gui You* mudra.\n\n*\"The Heavenly Worthy commands pardon, shining down upon the Vajra Hell.\nGhost-officials obey the decree; souls ride the light.\nDark prisons end their trials; tortures cease their bitterness.\nDeparting the hells, they stride toward the immortal realms.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Dark-Cold Hell of the North**\nFace north with the *Gui Zi* mudra.\n\n*\"*Yang* radiance shines downward; the hells return to spring.\nThe Dark-Cold’s frigid night is wholly dispelled by light.\nBitterness scatters; punishments and crimes dissolve.\nRiding this talisman’s light, they escape the dark gates.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Cauldron-Boiling Hell of the Northeast**\nFace northeast with the *Gui Yin* mudra.\n\n*\"True light of jade brilliance opens the night’s cold glow.\nCauldron flames subside; scorching torments turn to ice.\nWisdom’s moisture soaks; divine winds extinguish the blaze.\nSpirit-souls are at ease, riding the light in flight.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Bronze-Pillar Hell of the Southeast**\nFace southeast with the *Gui Si* mudra.\n\n*\"The true light of jade commands; ghost-officials receive grace.\nBronze pillars collapse; the crooked pardon sinful souls.\nBlack records vanish; golden light delivers souls.\nJade radiance ascends—beholding the Merciful Sovereign.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Slaughter Hell of the Southwest**\nFace southwest with the *Gui Shen* mudra.\n\n*\"The golden talisman descends with the celestial decree; the Most High proclaims mercy.\nThe Slaughter Hell’s knives and swords dissolve to dust.\nBroken souls restore their nature; sins and karma are erased.\nRiding the light from darkness, they escape the kalpic age.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Fire-Chariot Hell of the Northwest**\nFace northwest with the *Gui Hai* mudra.\n\n*\"A hundred treasures’ auspicious splendor, within which dwells the Primordial Worthy.\nPouring sweet dew, washing away the flames’ affliction.\nFire-chariots halt their tracks; swords and halberds shatter their suffering.\nGhost-officials obey the pardon, drawing out the ghost-souls.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Salvation from the Universal Torment Hell of the Center**\nFace the center, burn the talisman, then use the *Jade Clarity Mudra* to conclude.\n\n*\"Mystic radiance arises naturally, pardoning the depths of the Yellow Springs.\nGrace extends universally; sins and sufferings are absolved.\nGhost-officials depart; soul-spirits ascend as immortals.\"*\n\nVisualize the three-colored cloud-*qi* atop your crown, with Grand Unity the Merciful Sovereign seated above, radiating a hundred treasures’ light to shine upon the Yellow Springs’ curves.

      "translated_text": "**Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n**Chapter Seventeen: Seeking Sound to Deliver from Suffering**\n\nThe Master said: The Yellow Register delivers the living; the Azure Mystery rescues the suffering. Wisdom’s light dispels darkness; talismanic commands reach the hidden realms. They retrieve sunken, stagnant souls, raising them to swift joy. Such merit is truly not insignificant. Yet those who practice it—how could they regard it as easy to behold?\n\nThe altar must be solemnly arrayed, bells and chimes resonant. Though outwardly adorned with majestic ritual forms, inwardly it relies solely upon virtue and conduct. If one takes seals as life-essence, or now employs written summons for control, yet does not inwardly cultivate the self, not only will it be of no benefit—it may even lead astray.\n\nThe transmission of talismans for the hidden and nether realms has long prioritized deliverance from suffering and longevity. Thus, the talismans for deliverance from suffering are placed first.\n\n**Explanation of the Original Deliverance-from-Suffering Talisman and the Longevity Talisman**\n\nThe Master said: This level talisman is fully recorded in the *Scripture of the Nine Nether Realms*, all conforming to the true. Later incorporated into the *Lingbao* methods, distinctions were forcibly imposed, establishing various grades, scattered forms, and hierarchies of nobility, each with its own gradations.\n\nWhen heaven and earth divided, humanity was placed between them. Having attained human form, one encounters the gates of life and death, and the distinctions of noble and base—such is the natural order of the world. Yet how could heaven treat the people below with disparate degrees? There is only the One.\n\nThus, the *Scripture of the Mysterious Numinous* states: Though ranks differ in honor, the allotment of life is without distinction. If there is no distinction, how could talismanic forms differ? Yet their terminology varies, sowing confusion.\n\nThe Master continued: Within the treasure-pearl, the primordial script was simple, but later ages made it elaborate. Now, I establish the Deliverance-from-Suffering as a single category, placing these two talismans at the forefront. Future inheritors of the teaching should follow and practice this, comprehending its truth.\n\n**First: True Deliverance-from-Suffering Talisman**\n**Second: Transforming-Reed Dragon Talisman**\nUse yellow paper, two feet and four inches in length, inscribed in cinnabar. Suspend it in the mouth of the reed dragon. Recite the *Jade Clarity* and *Azure Mystery qi* incantations nine times, then write the talisman.\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Dao is attuned to the heart; delusion relies on illusion to take form.\nSever delusion with illusion; transform the false into the true.\nBind reeds into a dragon, its brows and eyes distinct.\nBear my talismanic command, descend into the cold courts.\nFrom this day forth, incinerate and transform, flying ceaselessly.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Additional Incantation:**\nCompassionate light delivers from suffering; the Most High is merciful.\nHuman life is benighted; sins and sufferings lead astray.\nFive sufferings, five burdens—karmic retribution is never lacking.\nToday is a great celebration; celestial light descends.\nDeliver from the realms of suffering; karmic debts dissolve.\nAscend my altar, undergo refinement, and be reborn.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.\n\n**Longevity Numinous Talisman**",

In all ritual fasts and supplications, these three talismans must first be proclaimed before the Talisman of Salvation from Suffering.\n\n**The Method of Salvation from Suffering in the Nine Nether Hells**\n**The Master says:** Heaven’s halls are all within me; hell is not apart from the mind. If one lives in the world, and all actions accord with principle, then at death, how could there be karmic debt? Without karmic debt, there is no sin. Without sin, how can there be hell?\n\nYet when the minds of worldly people grow deluded, the Six Dusts defile all. They slander the sages and transcendents, betray their lords and fathers, kill living beings, steal, owe lives, and squander wealth. A lifetime of deceit, treachery, and unbridled vice—after death, their souls are bound for hell. It is like a foolish person, wearied in mind and spirit: by day, their spirit wanders; by night, their soul takes flight. As they act, so do evil visions manifest. Only upon waking do they realize it was but a dream. Hell is no different from such delusion.\n\nAll the causes sown in life, and the sufferings endured after death—hell arises from sin, and sin originates in the mind. If the mind’s dharmas are empty, how can sin exist? Yet hell, though unreal, is hard to refute in form; the mind’s dharmas, though formless, are hard to grasp in appearance. To stabilize the mind, first sever delusion. Once delusion is cut, sin vanishes without form, and hell is shattered.\n\nFor heaven is yang and thus bright; earth is yin and thus dark. Darkness brings suffering, suffering brings confinement—this is hell. To shatter hell, first mobilize the light of heaven. Borrow the talisman to convey *qi*, and borrow *qi* to spread light. With brightness shatter darkness, with yang overcome yin, with truth dispel delusion—this is called shattering hell.\n\nYet the superior adept awakens without doubt, while the inferior adept cannot yet comprehend. The Dao’s mystery is unfathomable; the mind’s dharmas are inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "The profound and wondrous principles need not be expounded at length.\n\n**Method for Shattering Hell**\nThe Master said: The method for shattering hell involves striking the prison gates with a ritual staff. The use of such a staff pertains to the Three Caverns Masters. There are those who wield swords to shatter hell—these are the Orthodox Unity Masters. In recent times, some have taken up axes to break open hell, citing the unorthodox claim of \"using iron axes to cleave all hells.\" Later generations, unaware of the origins and traditions, mistakenly attribute the ritual staff to the Numinous Treasure Masters, while the Heavenly Master’s lineage is said to employ axes. These are all vulgar interpretations, failing to grasp the true essence and confounding the correct Dao. In our tradition, only those who have received the Central Alliance Great Cavern Register may use the ritual staff; others hold the Alliance威 Register. Swords and wooden axes are most disruptive to the Dao. When ascending the altar, such acts differ little from theatrical performance. They profane the sacred and true, and their transgression is grave. Thus, the practice of wielding axes is expressly abolished.\n\n**True Talisman of the Three Qi and Nine Yang Jade Light to Shatter Hell**\nWith the Jade Clarity mudra, inscribe the *qi* of the Three Heavens, Nine Yang, and Three Lights. The True Talisman of the Void-Origin Three *Qi* and Nine Yang Jade Light to Shatter Hell is proclaimed below to the Underworld’s Curved Springs and the Northern Capital of Luo Deng:\n\n\"May the yang light penetrate and illuminate, opening the iron prisons. May the gloom of the netherworld disperse, the blades and halberds shatter. May the flames of the fire pools subside, the karmic realms know no wind. May the night gates and dark palaces all transform into heaven. May the departed souls emerge, bowing before the golden countenance. As this decree is issued, let it be swiftly conveyed by wind and fire.\"\n\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the Great Year.\n\n**Method for Inscribing Talismans**\nBy the decree of the Three Great Emperors of Jade Clarity, Highest Clarity, and Grand Clarity, absolve and deliver the ten directions. May the Numinous Treasure Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy, the Vermilion Numinosity Emperor, the Vermilion Numinosity Lord, the Southern Culmen Longevity Great Emperor, and the Nine Heavens Life-Monitoring Great Spirits deliver the soul of the departed, so-and-so.\n\nUpon reaching the character \"decree,\" visualize the golden light of the Three Treasures of the Three Heavens.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"The Jade Emperor decrees, receiving the mandate of Jade Clarity. Absolve the sins of the ten directions; let fragrant incense fill the court.\n*Oṃ hūṃ halu svāhā*, swiftly as the decree commands.\"\n\n**Concealed Transmission of the Duplicate Talisman**\nInscribe one talisman for each hell, performing the rites in advance, then use the duplicate talisman as verification. On yang days, add one stroke.\n\nWhen summoning souls from the underworld, this talisman may also be reprinted on the directional envelope, and the earthly officials will promptly comply. When shattering hell, this talisman may be inscribed on yellow paper and placed in each direction as a token of its use. This is the talisman of the Six Jia yin-yang spirits, which may also be overlaid on the duplicate talisman.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Savior from Suffering Talisman and the Like**\nThe Master said: Before inscribing talismans, first purify the mind, restraining and sealing all worldly distractions. Face east in the cross-legged posture, visualizing the head as a circular light divided into blue, white, and yellow hues, with the Great One Compassionate Venerable seated upon a lion within the light. Then, within the radiance of a hundred treasures, emit a hundredfold brilliance, illuminating the ten directions. In each beam of light, behold the compassionate visage of the Great One Heavenly Worthy. Next, visualize the body as Mount Kunlun, drawing the compassionate light of the Great One to shine upon the Underworld’s Curved Springs, where every hell is bathed in light. Withdraw the *qi* of the Azure Mystery to infuse the brush and inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Method for Proclaiming the Savior from Suffering Talisman and the Like**\nThe Master said: When reciting the proclamation, visualize the body as the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy. Then, from the crown of the head, emanate the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy ascending through the wondrous gate. From the eastern realm, the Great One Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy arrives upon a lion throne, merging with the Heavenly Worthy emanated from the crown. Then, unite with the Heavenly Worthy transformed from the body. At this moment, the three bodies become one. Open the eyes, seated within white light, the self now the form of the Great One.\n\nDraw the nine *qi* of the east to irrigate the liver, transforming the hall into a dragon that wields the talisman to summon souls.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"Nine *qi* surge forth, irrigating my liver meridian. Ten thousand golden rays transform into nine dragons.\nPierce the dark and break the gloom, descending twice into the Northern Feng.\nMay sinful souls be free, roaming the vast heavens.\nSwiftly as the Dharma commands.\"\n\nNext, visualize the liver *qi* transforming into a dragon, emerging from the left ear, then dispatch the talismanic dragon.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Longevity Talisman**\nThe Master said: When inscribing the Longevity Talisman, proceed as with the Savior from Suffering Talisman—calm the mind, free from distractions. Then, visualize the head as the blazing sun, within which the Great Lord of Longevity wears a hibiscus crown, seated amidst crimson clouds, radiating great light. Next, visualize the body as Kunlun, the heart as the Fire Palace. Draw *qi* to infuse the brush and inscribe the talisman.\n\n**Method for Proclaiming the Longevity Talisman**\nThe Master said: When proclaiming the talisman, visualize the body as the jade form of the Great Lord of Longevity. Then, from the crown of the head, emanate the Emperor of Longevity ascending through the wondrous gate. From within the cinnabar fire light, the Emperor of Longevity rides a three-*qi* fire dragon, merging with the form emanated from the crown. Then, unite with the body. At this moment, the three bodies become one. Open the eyes, standing within fire light, the self now the Great Lord of Longevity.\n\nDraw the three *qi* of the southern heavens into the liver, transforming into a golden dragon that emerges from the left ear.\n\n**Incantation:**\n\"*Qi* of the Cinnabar Heaven, radiant jade light.\nIrrigate my spirit palace; four golden dragons manifest.\nBearing the talisman and token, ascend to Southern Prosperity.\nRefine the yin haze, transform and circulate pure yang.\nSwiftly as the Dharma commands.\"\n\nNext, visualize the liver *qi* transforming into a golden dragon, emerging from the left ear.

Once the One True [nature] is lost, delusive thoughts arise, manifesting as suffering and retribution. The sagely masters established teachings for no other purpose than to awaken the illusory through the real.\nWhen the human heart strays from its true origin and enters the dark realm, even a thousand sages find it difficult to intervene. Only by deploying the One True to shatter the One Delusion can benighted souls attain purity, clearly escape their suffering, and be freed from entanglements—this is the original intent of the Most High’s compassionate teachings.\nIf practitioners fail to grasp this principle, clinging instead to mere documents and summonses as their practice, or upholding ritual decorum as merit, chanting through the night and exhausting themselves by day, they will ultimately bring no benefit to the deceased.\nThus, this chapter on salvation is established, that one may devote oneself wholly to the netherworld and not be distracted by external affairs.\nWhen the mind’s realm becomes clear and luminous, and the nature of heaven shines brightly, beyond this truth there is no other teaching.\nTo liberate those sunk in darkness from the realms of suffering—such merit is immeasurable.\n\nThe Master said: The Six *Jia* refer to *Jiazi*, *Jiayin*, *Jiachen*, *Jiawu*, *Jiashen*, and *Jiaxu*. *Jia* is the generative *qi* of the East, the Great Benevolence of life.\nThus, the South refines with fire, the West hardens with metal, the North obstructs with water, and the four intermediate directions are not aligned with the true *qi*. Without the deities of the Six *Jia* arrayed in the eight directions, the ethereal and corporeal souls would not perceive life.\nThe true [essence] of life is difficult to reach the altar; therefore, in this great teaching, the Six *Jia* messengers are first dispatched to guide the way.\n\n**Six Jia Opening Talisman**\nThis talisman, when proclaimed, shall illuminate the nine springs’ dark paths and the gloom of ghostly realms.\nThe Three Lights dispel obscurity; the Six *Jia* penetrate the yin.\nGhostly souls receive amnesty and behold the light.\nSpirit officials shall not conceal; the Golden Horse Post transmits.\nAs this decree commands, the Wind-Fire Post conveys.\nProclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year of the *Tai Sui*.\n\nThe Master said: The Six *Jia* Opening Talisman is the benevolent pledge that opens the dark paths.

      "translated_text": "As the decree is proclaimed, let it be transmitted by wind and fire couriers. On an auspicious day and hour of the year, month, and day under the reign of the Great Year Star, the decree is issued.\n\nThe Master declares: This is the method of the *Talisman Command for Opening the Nether Path*. Write it in vermilion on blue paper, fold the corners, seal with an imprint, and place it upon the altar before summoning the soul. When the Master guides the departed soul, with this talisman, the dark paths shall be smoothly traversed without obstruction.\n\n**Method of Transformation**\nFor opening the nether path, first circulate one’s own Three Lights to merge with the Three Lights of Heaven, naturally illuminating the path so that the nether roads shine brightly, free from stagnation or hindrance. One will then perceive the soul’s consciousness abiding within this radiance, seeing no other hues.\n\nNext, visualize the Most High Compassionate Venerable One holding a willow branch of empty azure, sprinkling the nether realm with its dew. In silent contemplation, recite the incantation:\n*\"The Three Lights gleam bright,\nThe Nine Nether realms lie deep.\nNight’s haze disperses, dawn’s clarity arises,\nBeholding the Compassionate Venerable’s form,\nSweet dew flows cool.\nLet the soul’s consciousness return,\nSmoothly traverse the dark journey.\nHearing the sutras and the Dharma,\nRoam freely in the Upper Clarity.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, draw the talisman while guiding the *qi*.\n\n**Method of Ablution**\nThe Master declares: Worldly toil and defilement are why the minds of mortals remain uncleansed. Not only is the mind tainted—all six senses bear dust, the six dusts bear consciousness, and the six consciousnesses bear filth. Thus, in death, one sinks even deeper, as if mired in mud, unable to purify oneself.\n\nThis ablution does not merely wash away conscious defilement. For the dark soul, burdened by sin, ignorance, and delusion, is like a body caked in grime. Therefore, with the pure and compassionate Dharma-water, each drop sprinkled and each touch cleansed, the nape and heart become clear, the *po* soul is restored, sins dissolve, and filth vanishes—this is what is meant by ablution.\n\n**Talisman of the Immortal’s Corpse-Cleansing**\nIncantation:\n*\"The Flower Pool nourishes and bathes,\nForm and soul become one in purity.\nThe six dusts are without stain,\nKarmic grime is wholly clarified.\nThe Three Fields glow full,\nThe Nine Orifices open bright.\nWashed and irrigated, the root of life,\nThe dead soul returns to infancy.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Jade Talisman of the Numinous Source’s Irrigation**\nIncantation:\n*\"Fragrant clouds congeal as dew,\nDripping and sprinkling, cool and pure.\nThe celestial source’s dark waves\nMoisten and irrigate the nether realms.\nCorpse-filth is stilled,\nKarmic dust instantly clears.\nRefine all delusions,\nScour away ignorance.\nThe Three Hun return to truth,\nWithered and decayed regain form.\nEntering and exiting the void,\nComing and going in profound darkness.\nNo stain of sin or filth,\nTen thousand kalpas’ dust cleansed.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Scouring Worldly Toil**\nIncantation:\n*\"Heaven’s filth becomes clouds,\nThe Three Lights sweep them clean.\nHuman filth of the six dusts,\nDharma-words scour the passions.\nEarth’s filth of corpse-impurity,\nDharma-water clarifies all.\nHuman filth does not arise,\nCorpse-filth is pacified.\nEarth’s filth is dispelled,\nAll immortals unite as one.\nThe Three Qi intermingle,\nMerging with the Dao in truth.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!\"*\n\n**Method of the Celestial Physician’s Whole-Form Restoration**\nThe Master declares: The ghostly consciousness lacks form, scattered and ungathered, like *qi* dwelling in the wind, without fixed shape. Yet its deluded thoughts persist, and the pains of illness or injury suffered in life continue to afflict it in death.

Yet scholars, though familiar with its forms and frequent in its practice, seldom witness its efficacy—often reducing it to mere paperwork. Therefore, in this flourishing age of the Great Teaching, a dedicated chapter on pursuit and summoning is established, ensuring that responses to talismanic invocation are swift as echoes and shadows—not merely for ornamental display.\n\nThe talismanic script of the Divine Tiger’s Jade Tablet is widely known and thus not reproduced here. Instead, this text records the secret methods, for their subtlety transcends worldly understanding.\n\nThe Master said: Should one ask what the Divine Tiger’s rite entails?\nThe Master answered: The sages employ the Divine Tiger for summoning because the *yin* direction is the Ghost Gate, and its guardian is the tiger. The act of summoning from this direction is thus profoundly meaningful. Today’s lineage masters appoint altar officials to oversee the Tiger Bureau—this is the principle.\n\nThe Master said: In the art of summoning, without knowledge of the inner secrets of the Dark Mystery, the netherworld remains obscured, the Three Realms indistinct, and ghosts reluctant to appear, while the courts of the underworld delay compliance. Mastery of this method differs vastly from the practices commonly seen today.\n\n**Register of the Divine Tiger’s Dark Mystery Inner Bureau Officials and Generals**\n\nThe Master said: The registers of daily altar attendants pertain to routine affairs. The officials of the Dark Mystery Inner Bureau, however, constitute a separate office, not bound to daily duties. Thus, their names are appended to this chapter on pursuit and summoning.\n\nDivine Tiger’s Inverted Life Dark Bureau Jade Maiden: Jiang Renkui\nDivine Tiger’s Purple Origin Lady, Dark Mystery Pursuit and Summoning Inner Bureau Jade Maiden: Wei Ziran\nDark Mystery Pursuit and Summoning Inner Bureau Spirit Officer: Cui Hao\nDivine Tiger’s Left Male Jade Ministry Chief Scribe: He [ ]\nDivine Tiger’s Right Female Martial Phoenix Chief Scribe: Qiao [ ]\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Pursuit-Soul Register-Keeper Spirit Officer: Li Youjun\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Heavenly Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Gao Long\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Human Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Ma Zheng\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Spirit Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Xue Yan\nDark Mystery Inner Bureau Hell Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Lei Fei\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Hungry Ghost Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhang Shouhe\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Violent Death Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhao Gongming\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Hidden Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhu Xin\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Heavenly Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Chen Congzheng\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Earthly Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Ge Sheng\nDivine Tiger’s Inner Bureau Watery Road Evil Path Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Du Ke\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Upper Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Zhang Xin\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Middle Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Hou Di\nDivine Tiger’s Outer Bureau Lower Region Pursuit-Soul Envoy: Wei Kui\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Immediate Manifestation Envoy: Chen Zhi\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Retribution Envoy: Liu Yi\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Escort and Torment Envoy: Xu Zhong\nDivine Tiger’s Prison Night Illumination Envoy: Xu Nian\n\n**Divine Tiger Talisman**\nIncantation:",

      "translated_text": "The □□(ghost+chrysanthemum) □□□(ghost+kalpa) method: With the middle finger of the middle hand, visualize a blue-clad child descending from the Dipper with a single *qi*, then blow upon the banner seven times—whereupon it falls.\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Seventeen concludes.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\n**Title:** *The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*\nCompiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, Methods category.\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method*, Scroll Eighteen\n**Chapter Twenty: The Transmutation of Immortals into Human Form**\n\nThe master says: To refine the form into perfection is the work of divine transcendents. When the three fields of the adept shine with radiance, the four symbols merge in harmony, the yang fire and yin talisman fuse with the alchemy of creation, and the spirit is whole with its full complement of numbers—then one ascends at dawn in broad daylight. This is the Dao of refining the form to achieve deathlessness. Why, then, would one need to rely on talismans and incantations?\n\nYet the world’s people, deluded in life and unenlightened by the Dao, enter the gates of darkness at death. Their single nature scatters and flies away, forever without a path to rebirth. If not for borrowing the transformative power of our own cultivation, harnessing the mysterious workings of water and fire in their mutual refinement, employing incantations to deliver them and talismans to revive them—how could the fragmented be gathered into a whole soul, the corpse be refined into a yang substance, and liberation be attained in an instant? Thus, this method is also the esoteric secret for saving the souls of the dead. How could one fail to revere it?\n\n**The Altar for Refining and Deliverance**\nThe master says: Our altar’s refining and deliverance derive from the marvel of true water and fire. The sun’s essence and the moon’s radiance are called true water and true fire. Thus, the Great Teaching takes the Three Luminaries as its foundation. Since the marvel of water and fire was first attained by us, what difficulty is there in delivering the dead? Though the Lingbao Nanchang refining and deliverance method exists, its water and fire emerge from our own sun and moon.\n\nOne must know that this altar is the progenitor of all methods—how much more so for refining and deliverance? The art of smelting and forging is only here that the orthodox transmission’s marvel is attained.\n\n**The Water Pool, Fire Pit, and Lamp Method**\n**Mobilizing the Refining and Deliverance Official Generals**\nThe master says: The transformations of our body follow the movement of thought, becoming the divided forms of our yang spirit’s official generals. Merging with the *qi* of Heaven, we mobilize our spirit, entrusting it to the talismanic form and borrowing the breath of ordinary water and fire.\n\nInternally, unite with the Dao in truth. First, visualize within our body, between the kidneys, a point of light the size of a bean. After a long while, it grows and flies out upon the water’s waves. The officials upon the waves all wear dark robes. The Jade Maiden, riding the *qi* of water, stands at the right of our body. We entrust her to the side of the water pool.\n\nThen visualize within the heart a pellet the size of a tangerine. After a long while, true fire bursts forth. The officials within the fire wear red robes. The Jade Youth, riding the light, stands at the left of our body. We entrust him to the side of the fire pit.\n\nThereafter, burn the *Plain Flower True Mysterious Jade Radiance Yellow Edict* and the *Original Yang Spontaneous Refining Soul Red Register* to summon true water.\n\n**Transmutation and Refinement**\nThe master says: When burning the *Yellow Edict* and *Red Register*, visualize each of the celestial bodies—thus, the water pool becomes the moon, and the fire pit the sun. Riding the light, they enter our body, merging with our body’s water and fire, and together enter the pool. One sees only a dazzling radiance, no longer perceiving the mundane world. Only then proceed.\n\n**Plain Flower True Mysterious Jade Radiance Yellow Edict**\n**Incantation:**\nTrue Official of the Mysterious Unity, Pure and Wondrous Primordial Sovereign,\nSend down true water, descending into the altar courtyard.\nWash away yin defilements, retain the true and admit the pure.\nThe soul returns to *ren* and *gui*, the womb nurtures the essence-spirit.\nDrink and absorb the mysterious flower, float upon the green bloom.\nThe dharma flows in a mixed outpouring, the body possesses radiant light.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas, fulfillment is complete; the Three and Five respond in resonance.\nBy the mysterious imperial talismanic command, the Great Yin receives and obeys.\nThus, as the decree is proclaimed.",

They are the method by which form is perfected, the body completed, and inner and outer made true. Without this method, the fetal womb becomes stagnant, and the dead *qi* solidifies at the root. Thus, the immortal refinement must be practiced.\n\nIt is said: When transmitting *qi*, one must rely on the *qi* of each respective direction to infuse it. The nine heavens distribute the eight directions and the center, each possessing the *qi* of its own direction. Applied to the human body’s creation, this means: The *Yu Shan Wu Liang* Heaven governs the *qi* of the East. All things arise from it, hence it is called \"Beginning Azure\"—rightly so.\n\nWhen gathering into one, it is the *Huang Yan* *qi*. One is the beginning of numbers, and the color of the beginning is black, which transforms into yellow. *Yan* means \"to flow through.\" Thus, the *qi* of *Huang Yan* is used to irrigate the fetal life, allowing the true *qi* to scour the yin of the corpse and open the fetal origin.\n\nIn practice, one visualizes the *qi* of the Eastern *Beginning Azure* Heaven, guiding it with the talisman into the crown of the deceased’s soul to infuse it. After a long while, the body becomes radiant. Next, the *Wu Liang* Heaven draws the *qi* of the South. The *Xu Yan* Heaven draws the *qi* of the West. The *Xiong Shu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the North. The *Bo Luo* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Northeast. The *Ying Sheng* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Southeast. The *Fan Fu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Southwest. The *Gao Xu* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Northwest. The *Wu Xiang Wu Jie* Heaven draws the *qi* of the Central Heaven. Once the nine *qi* are complete, the Three Passes and Eight Sceneries are born. This is what is meant by \"without enduring suffering, the body radiates light, and form and spirit are both wondrous.\"\n\nThe creative transformations of the nine heavens are all methods for scholars to refine the body and attain immortality. Thus, they are fully employed to deliver the deceased.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Dong Ming Zi Hu*?\nThe Master said: The immortal embryo originally has no form; its likeness is cavernous, meaning it is indistinct between light and dark. When the first *qi* forms the womb and the second *qi* forms the fetus, there is as yet no clear or turbid. Within it is profound obscurity, but its mysterious gate is purely Yang, unadulterated. Purple is the color of Yang’s radiance, hence it is called the *Purple Gate*.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Chang Ling Ming Xian*?\nThe Master said: With the third *qi*, the Mysterious Origin has already divided. Here, the spirit-soul is born. The *hun* is Yang. Cultivating it, one may attain long life and spiritual communion, radiance and penetrating clarity, and refine the body into an immortal.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Dang Shi Ming Yan You*?\nThe Master said: There is Yin and Yang, life and death—this is the way of the world. The human body cannot be without Yin and Yang. Without cultivation, Yang diminishes and Yin prevails, and one dies to become a lowly ghost. Thus, *qi* belongs to the *po*, and the *po* belongs to Yin, its nature inclined to sinking and heaviness. Hence, *dang dang* refers to the stubbornness of stone, too heavy to ascend. When the *po* is strong, the *hun* dissipates. When the *hun* dissipates, the corpse becomes everlasting. One must circulate the Yang *qi* of the Four Great Elements to dissolve the path of the corpse’s *po*, merging it with the spirit-soul to refine and become an immortal.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Wu Xian Zhong Ling*?\nThe Master said: The five *qi* complete the Five Phases. When the Five Phases are complete, the viscera are whole. Thus, when the Five Phases gather at the center, one may refine the immortal and attain spiritual communion. The viscera are not the lungs and kidneys as commonly understood, but rather the treasures within the body, fully preserved—this is called *zang*. Stored without dissipation, with a place to return, this is called *fu*. Thus, the scripture says: \"When the Earth Treasury is opened, gold and jade reveal their form.\"\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Gao Zhen Chong Rong*?\nThe Master said: When the scholar has achieved success, the six transformations are no ordinary matter. The palaces within the body all attain spiritual communion in the highest realm. The work of becoming a true immortal is harmonious and fused, uniting with Heaven.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Gao Xian Dong Ji*?\nThe Master said: The seventh *qi* is Lesser Yang. Here, the *qi* congeals into truth, returning to the primordial and highest realm. The work of verifying immortality is profound and subtle, beyond full comprehension. Those who enter its depths are called *Dong*. Its secrets are not revealed, hence it is called the *Xuan Shi*. Thus, the *Ji* and treasured texts are the dragon scripts of the *Daoist Canon*.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Zhen Ling Hua Ning*?\nThe Master said: The eighth *qi* is when one is about to become a true immortal. This is what is meant by \"a thousand times attaining spiritual communion, sitting in disappearance and standing in vanishing.\" Preserving the spirit and transcending transformation, guarding the One naturally, undispersed and unlost—this is called congealing. Thus, when the power of the Dao is complete, one may become true, attain spiritual communion, transcend transformation, and achieve firm congealment—all are the Way of long life.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the *qi* of the *Zi Ran Xuan Zhao*?\nThe Master said: When the nine Yang are complete, one ascends into formlessness, neither forced nor contrived, neither created nor fabricated—this is called *Xuan Zhao*. All are the gradual attainments of the diligent scholar, hence the subtle mysteries.\n\n**Talismans for Receiving Transformation and Rebirth**\n**Water Talisman for Refining the Womb and Nurturing Form**\nIncantation:\n*May the hun return to Ren and Gui,\nMay the po restrain the nine tombs.\nPrimal True Talisman,\nUnfurl your light for ten thousand miles.\nCommand the breaking of dark obscurity,\nRefine the hun with true water.\nBind the Yellow Flower of the Well Star,\nMay the Lady descend with sweet dew.\nGreat Mystery’s true aperture,\nReturn and restore essence and marrow.\nStir the turbid and lift the clear,\nEnter life and exit death.*\n\n**Fire Talisman for Refining the Embryo and Restoring Form**\nVisualize the radiant light of the cinnabar field, knock the teeth twelve times, and form the Mudra of the Southern Dipper. Visualize the Primordial Beginning riding clouds above the crown. Write in red on yellow paper, infusing it with *qi*. Next, form the Mudra of the Northern Dipper, writing in black on yellow paper. When applying it, visualize nine phoenixes spraying flames and nine dragons spouting vast waters, the two *qi* intermingling within one’s own *qi*. Circulate them through nine cycles, and the Infant appears, its image following the body, golden light blazing brilliantly.",
      "overlap_context": "ivating the nine *qi*’s Yang, they become immortals. Therefore, in refinement and deliverance, Yang *qi* is used to deliver yin *po*. Thus, talismans are borrowed to aid it, incantations to invoke it. As the scripture says: \"Hidden souls hear it and are delivered. Withered and decayed hear it and emit smoke. Dead souls attain this and regain their soul’s form.\" This is the work upon which both life and death depend—how could its benefit be small?\n\n**First Yang Talisman**\n**Second Yang Talisman**",

uphold,\nAscending to the Cinnabar Bureau,\nRefined and transformed into truth,\nForm and spirit both wondrous.\nHere the seal is applied,\nHalf retained for presentation above.\n\n**The Celestial

the soul being delivered.\nWhen sending the soul,\nPresent the talismanic decree toward the Heavenly Gate and the Bridge of Deliverance,\nBurning it in fierce flames.\n\n**The Teachings on the Three Paths and Five Sufferings**\nThe Master says:\nThe Three Paths and Five Sufferings,\nThough their names differ, their retribution is one.\nThe toil of the Heavenly Path\nArises when the six senses are stained by the one center,\nThus at death, one receives the Heavenly Path’s toil.\nThe toil of the Earthly Path\nComes from laboring the body and wearing the form,\nHands moving, feet treading,\nAll dependent on earthly things,\nAt death, the familiar scenes are hard to forget,\nThus one receives the Earthly Path’s suffering.\nThe toil of the Watery Path\nIn life, through spring’s crookedness, ghostly cunning, and lust’s drowning of truth,\nHow much more in the sea of desire?\nAt death, thoughts cling unceasingly,\nThus one receives the Watery Path’s suffering.\n\nThe Five Sufferings, though their texts vary,\nWhat are they?\nSuffering of the heart, suffering of essence,\nSuffering of form, suffering of spirit,\nSuffering of the hun.\nTogether called the Eight Difficulties.\nThe scripture states:\n*Forever deliver from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties,\nTranscend the Three Realms.*\nThis speaks to the living.\nIf the living, within their mortal bodies,\nAre not ensnared by desire’s defilements,\nThey forever depart the Five Sufferings and Three Paths,\nThen may they transcend the Three Realms.\nNow, those who practice the dharma,\nUnable to deliver themselves from the Eight Difficulties,\nFalsely establish Eight Gates,\nUsing talismans to deliver ghosts—this is mistaken.\nThe suffering of the heart:\nWorldly people scheme and strategize,\nPursuing fame and sensuality,\nAll arising from the heart’s original purity,\nStained by desire—is this not the heart’s suffering?\nAdd to this lust and filth,\nYearning for feminine beauty—\nThis is called the suffering of essence.\nWhen essence suffers, the body withers and strength fails,\nNearing the path of death.\nIf the body does not generate spirit,\nThe corpse’s po blazes fiercely.\nThus it is said: suffering of spirit.\nWhen spirit departs, death is not far.\nWhen the mortal body is lost,\nThe Dao-body unformed,\nOne becomes bleached bones in the wilds—\nThis is called the suffering of form.\nWhen form suffers, one becomes a lowly ghost.\nIf the hun is incomplete,\nDrifting as a scattered po,\nSinking and stagnating without return,\nOnly then is it the suffering of the hun.\nThe four sufferings—of heart, essence, spirit, and form—\nAre the daily depletion in life,\nThus these sufferings arise.\nThe suffering of the hun\nComes only after death,\nThen one receives its suffering.\nThe Five Sufferings were never meant to establish gates.\nThe Eight Difficulties also arise from the heart.\nThe heart is the master of the body;\nWhen settled, the three karmas and six dusts are also settled.\nWhen the heart is chaotic, myriad conditions arise.\nIf one wishes to burn talismans to deliver ghosts through the Eight Gates,\nIt would be better to deliver oneself from the Eight Difficulties.\nHaving failed to deliver oneself,\nOne cannot avoid death,\nAt death, the Eight Difficulties manifest as retribution.\nAt that time, relying on others to deliver oneself—\nIs this not shameful?\nNow, by the Master’s decree,\nThe Eight Difficulties’ gates are not established.\nThe gates that were established were later people’s fabrications.\nThose who inherit the teachings\nShould cultivate the body to deliver themselves,\nThen rectify themselves before rectifying ghosts and spirits.\nTherefore, the Three Paths and Five Sufferings’ talismans\nAre no longer established,\nLest they delude the enlightened disciples of later generations.\nReflect on these teachings,\nAnd do not practice false doctrines.\n\n**The Departed Soul’s Holding of the Contract**\nThe Master says:\nIn the *Numinous Treasure* dharma,\nThere is a rite for the soul to hold the great contract in both hands\nTo enter the Three Heavenly Gates.\nThis is incorrect.\nThe formless and non-action\nTake emptiness, stillness, and spontaneity as their root.\nIf holding a contract can enter the Heavenly Gates,\nOne is inevitably bound by form and attachment.\nBound by attachment, one does not attain the wondrous.\nThus the Teaching Master specifically removed the contract\nAnd granted the Register of Eternal Life.\n\n**The Essentials of Refining and Deliverance**\nFollowing the *Crimson Clarity*’s decree to summon the generals,\nBurn the talisman to summon the generals,\nAs in the method of transforming water and fire.\nThe officials and generals encircle the water pool and fire marsh,\nThe Emperor descends to his throne,\nThe Compassionate One witnesses the transformation,\nThe Nine Heavens spread their nets,\nThe Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper’s Imperial Lords stand in solemn array.\nSummon the Water and Fire Lords to capture and transform the departed soul,\nRefine the infant by burning the talisman,\nCapture the infant and enter the water.\nThe water shines like autumn moonlight,\nWhite and black blending,\nThe infant’s body gleams and glistens.\nCapture and enter the fire for refinement,\nThe fire like spring’s warm qi,\nSteaming and refining the infant to completion.\nWithin the golden orb,\nA semblance of form appears,\nInter-refined within the purple-golden light.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: One qi divides into three, named the Mysterious Origin. When the three qi divide and distinguish themselves, the Three Talents are established, mirrored in the human body. The forms of purity and turbidity separate into three sections. Each section has its spirit, also called the Three Fields. Each field contains treasure, thus one becomes two, two becomes three, and three becomes the myriad truths—together called the Three Origins. *Origin* means greatness, primacy. Thus, the *Book of Changes*’ *Qian* hexagram speaks of *origination, prosperity, fruition, and perseverance*, and so it is.\n\nThe Master said: The ancestral qi of the Five Phases is called the Five Elders. *Elder* is the model of beginnings, the ancestor. Drawing the essence of the Five Elders, they divide to become the Five Stars. The essence of the Five Stars stands firm as the Five Peaks, corresponding to the human body as the Five Viscera. Above, they align with the Five Stars; in the center, with the Five Peaks—thus the spirits reside within.\n\nThe Master said: The spirits of the Three and Five penetrate heaven and earth, yet all return to the single body. In their operation, there are methods of generation and restraint, of control and submission. For prayers, exorcisms, and offerings, the mutual generation and restraint apply. For driving away and curing, mutual conquest applies. Whenever treading the stars, first summon the spirits of the Three Origins and Five Phases, then proceed with the steps.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Virtues generate one another:\nWood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, water generates wood.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Qi conquer one another:\nMetal conquers wood, wood conquers earth, earth conquers water, water conquers fire, fire conquers metal.\n\nThe Upper Origin Pace belongs to heaven,\nThe Middle Origin Pace belongs to humanity,\nThe Lower Origin Pace belongs to earth.\n\n**Incantation for the Upper Origin Pace:**\nStep the essence of heaven, command the myriad spirits.\nThe Upper Origin conceals my body, General Tang Xiong.\nAssist my true qi, repel and subdue demonic spirits.\nShould any dare harm me, return it to their own person.\nLet evil demons upon sight transform into fine dust.\nHeavenly soldiers guard and protect—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Incantation for the Middle Origin Pace:**\nStep the essence of humanity, strengthen yang and dispel yin.\nFortify my three hun-souls, extinguish ghosts and banish spirits.\nMisfortune cannot reach me, calamity cannot touch me.\nHarm cannot invade me—the Middle Origin hides my form.\nGeneral Ge Yong, lead a hundred thousand troops to guard my body—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Incantation for the Lower Origin Pace:**\nTread the numen of earth, secure the human path.\nHeaven revolves, earth turns, above *Kui*, below *Qian*.\nYin closes, yang opens, true qi flows unceasing.\nGhosts cannot harm me, people cannot injure me.\nHeaven is my canopy, earth my foundation.\nShould any dare afflict me, seize them to *Kui* and *Gang*—the Lower Origin conceals my form.\nGeneral Zhou Wu, follow wherever I go, swiftly become my truth—*hasten as the law commands!*\n\nThe Master said: For subduing demons and evil, for overcoming calamities and dangers, first step the Upper Origin Pace. Once the sequence is complete, enter the Middle Origin Pace, then transform into the Lower Origin Pace. If subduing fierce evil, further transform to tread the Conquering Pace—then control heavenly dragons and ghostly spirits, responding to the heart’s call without fail.

      "translated_text": "The master said: This pace follows the sequence of metal conquering wood, wood conquering earth, earth conquering water, water conquering fire, and fire conquering metal. It is used for subduing and restraining. If seeking auspiciousness, reverse it to follow the mutual generation of the Five Phases.\n\n**Pace of Mutual Generation of the Five Phases**\nThe master said: The pace of mutual generation follows wood generating fire, fire generating earth, earth generating metal, metal generating water, and water generating wood. Each generation and each restraint adhere to the sequence of water as one, fire as two, wood as three, metal as four, and earth as five—totaling fifteen steps, the Way of three and five.\n\n**Incantation for Mutual Generation of the Five Phases:**\nThe Five Phases mutually generate, all affairs prosper.\nWater and wood achieve, fire and earth unite.\nMetal and water proceed together, misfortune transforms into fortune.\nGhosts cannot harm, people cannot encroach.\nThe dead revive, the withered flourish again.\n*Hasten as the law commands!*\n\n**Yu’s Pace of the Ninefold Numinous Dipper**\nThe master said: This is the Pace of the Vast Dipper, also called the Minor Three-Five Pace.

Now corrected, it can command ghosts and spirits and expel demonic paths. Guard this well, guard this well.\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon, Scroll Nineteen—Concluded**\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon**\n*Title:* The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon. Compiled by Lu Shizhong of the Song Dynasty. Thirty scrolls.\n*Source:* From the *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* section, category of methods.\n\n**The Wondrous and Supreme Three Heavens Jade Hall Canon, Scroll Twenty**\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: Receiving Liberation in the Living Body**\n\nThe master said: The scriptures speak of receiving liberation in the living body, enduring through kalpas. This refers to those who cultivate in their present form. Later generations, unaware of self-cultivation, rely solely on ritual merit, seeking liberation before death—greatly missing the Dao. The \"living body\" here means the physical form in this present life. Those who \"receive liberation\" attain the Dao in their bodies, transcending the worldly net to become Perfected Ones. Thus, the body achieves immortality, enduring through kalpas without decay. Now, to liberate the body before death is to prepare the path for the time of dying—how can one know what is correct? This question is thus posed before the master.\n\nThe master said: This is because I do not approve of liberating the body before death in later generations. However, the Most High, in compassion for the world’s changes and humanity’s stubbornness—who can seek awakening?—realized that none could be liberated, and people would forever remain ignorant of the Dao. Thus, the precepts opened the method of liberation and transformation. Later students may cultivate their bodies and perfect their truth, freely entering the Golden Gate and roaming the Three Realms—what need would there be for this method?\n\nThe master said: Heaven generates the myriad beings, and humans are the most numinous. Yet their ranks vary: noble and base, worthy and foolish, rich and poor, long-lived and short-lived—all arise from different origins. What does this mean? Among the Six Paths, humans are the most numinous. Emerging from the Six Paths to become human is fitting. Those from the Heavenly Path are not malicious, their hearts always kind and benevolent. Those from the Spirit Path are secretly harmful, often wise and astute. Those from the Human Path know propriety and do not transgress, always following the correct principle. The rest from evil paths—such as hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts—are blind, deaf, mute, lowly, impoverished, stubborn, cruel, and lawless. Therefore, in liberating the living body, one must select whom to liberate.\n\nMoreover, the world’s great nobles, kings, and dukes, and the immensely wealthy, their ranks and family resources—whether high or low, shallow or deep—all arise from worldly fortune. What does this mean? Those who in past lives believed in and followed the Dao and Buddhism, practiced rituals and expedient means, built roads and bridges, established baths and offered food, performed boundless good deeds, and personally received scriptural teachings yet failed to cultivate—such people, after death and rebirth, return to the human or heavenly realms, receiving retribution according to the magnitude of their merit. Having received their reward, if they act improperly along the way, upon death they must enter the dark gates. Thus, the Most High, in pity, specially bestowed this method of liberation, enabling them after death to bypass the earthly courts, erase their worldly transgressions, and become like Perfected Ones. The precepts have clear prohibitions, and people come to cultivate through these.\n\nHowever, there are generals who command troops at the frontiers—these come from the ranks of deities and spirits. Though wealthy and noble, their names are entered in the Black Register, and they are tasked with killing. They are not suitable for liberation. Similarly, officials who administer punishments and interrogations, presiding over grievances and enmities, acting on their own judgment—these come from the earthly courts of the netherworld. They may be reborn in the Central Kingdom and attain nobility again, but they cannot be granted talismans for transcendence.",

      "translated_text": "Those who inquire further may include scions of hereditary noble houses and heirs of immense wealth—young men of fleeting years who know nothing of the Three Honored Ones. These are the very sort haunted by the lewd and wandering ghosts that lurk beneath their eaves and gather at their gates. Though rich, they do not live long; though noble, they remain ignorant. Heaven’s overseers mark their deeds, and they perish swiftly. These, too, cannot be delivered.\n\nThen there are those who carry meals along the roads—all the destitute and orphaned. In former lives, they accumulated karmic transgressions, and in this life, they endure the suffering of wailing and ceaseless toil, born as lowly men and dying as lesser ghosts. These, likewise, cannot be delivered.\n\nOnly elders of virtue, benevolent men, faithful laypeople, and nameless monks and Daoists who seek to return to the Great Dao, though unaware of its true source, may be delivered in this life so that, in death, they may follow the true path. For them, altars are regularly erected, and petitions are presented to the Three Heavens, notifying the courts of the netherworld to expunge their names from all records. Their names are then submitted to the celestial bureaus, inscribed upon jade tablets, and talismans are issued for them to wear. Half of each talisman is retained upon the body, while the other half is burned in offering. At the time of death, the talisman ascends with them.\n\nAll worldly people who hold no Daoist rank in life become lesser ghosts in death. During their time in the world, their names are bound to the registers of Mount Tai’s courts, interconnected across seventy-two case files, awaiting the opportunity for their records to be amended. To amend a record means that the registers of the earthly courts are linked to those of the celestial bureaus. Each case requires a brush, ink, paper, and an inkstone—whether made of paper or wood. These are burned along with the talisman for amending records.\n\nThe celestial overseers then sever and transfer the names from the earthly registers, issuing jade talismans for record amendment. These are inscribed on seventy-two slips of catalpa wood, written in cinnabar, and sealed with yellow paper before being dispatched. The talisman is sent down to the officials of the Eastern Marchmount’s netherworld courts, commanding them to expunge the transgressions of the named individual, wash away their karmic stains, and directly submit their names to the celestial bureaus to be inscribed upon jade tablets, awaiting the end of their allotted span so they may ascend to the divine realms of heaven. Let this command be carried out as decreed, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.\n\nIssued on the [day] of the [month] in the year of the Great Year Star.\n\nThe Master says: For the faithful who receive deliverance, whose names are recorded in Fengdu, each is to be issued a talisman for the expungement of sins.\n\nThe True Talisman of the Most High for the Expungement of Sins and Love of Life:\nThirteen slips of cypress wood, inscribed in cinnabar, sealed in blue, and sent down.\n\nThis talisman is dispatched to the courts of the Yellow Springs, the Three Offices of Fengdu in the Northern Capital, the Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources, commanding the expungement of the named individual’s three lifetimes of submerged retributions and accumulated karmic transgressions, severing their records from the celestial bureaus and inscribing their names upon jade tablets.

Therefore, the Sage said: “Do not agitate your essence, and you may attain long life.” After ordination, cultivate a pure heart and few desires. Guard and preserve your primordial essence; let it neither spill nor leak.

      "translated_text": "The Jade Talisman preserves the spirit; golden elixir refines the form.\nPreserve your hun-soul’s essence, govern your po-soul’s numen.\nWhen the hun is at peace and the po settled, the spirit-chamber becomes clear and serene.\nThe Three Passes and Nine Portals—each orifice radiant with light.\nThe spirit whole, without leakage, you shall ascend to the Upper Clarity.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: The spirit is the master of the entire body. Ordinary people, driven by excessive desire and delusion, fail to guard their spirit-abode; their minds constantly stray outward, their bodies wither like rotting wood, the Nine Portals become obstructed, and the body ceases to generate spirit. Thus, *The Central Yellow Scripture* states: “Alas for the twelve towers of the Mysterious Palace—who knows they have become the dwelling of the Three Corpses?” Then the spirit is depleted. Therefore, the Celestial Master’s maxim declares: “When the mind is chaotic, the spirit naturally dissipates; when qi is exhausted, the form withers as well. Those who profane the Supreme Law of the Most High shall daily consort with ghosts.” Is this not the suffering of the spirit? After ordination, constantly guard the spirit-chamber, let no reckless thoughts arise, and both form and spirit shall attain subtlety, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\n**Talisman for Deliverance from the Suffering of the Corporeal Soul**\nIncantation:\nThe Jade Talisman preserves the spirit; the Jade Talisman connects to the True.\nThe talisman transforms primordial change; the talisman transfigures into true essence.\nThe spirit-heart unmoved, the numinous palace ever clear.\nNo greed, no desire, no chaos, no licentiousness.\nThe hun-soul serene and upright, the myriad qi eternally preserved.\nUnburdened by suffering and affliction, the body radiates light.\nThe Three Realms attend as guards; the Five Emperors oversee the welcoming.\nThe myriad spirits pay homage; your name is inscribed in the Upper Clarity.\nAs commanded.\n\nThe Master declares: When the spirit abides constantly, the hun-soul remains ever at peace. When the spirit-chamber is in turmoil, the corpse-po delights in greed, anger, sorrow, thought, grief, joy, fine clothing, rich food, desire, and licentiousness—all the nature of the po. If one can guard the true and eliminate the reckless, purifying the spirit-chamber, then the hun-soul shall remain perpetually tranquil and unified. If one fails to guard the true, defiling the numinous orifices, the spirit perishes and the boundaries collapse, the po flourishes and the corpse rages—then the hun scatters and dwindles. Once the hun dissipates, one drifts far from immortality and draws near to ghosts. From this day of ordination onward, never forget devotion to the Dao, never exhaust the primordial spirit. When the spirit is not chaotic, the hun naturally finds peace, and only then may one receive the teachings of preparatory cultivation.\n\nThe Master declares: The ordained have already passed through the Five Gates of Suffering. Yet while the mortal form remains in this world, one must still guard against the defilements of transgressing precepts, lest one sink to the level of the common multitude. Though delivered from the suffering of the Corpse of Peng, this is merely a formal record. You must further uphold the Ten Precepts—matters commonly violated by worldly people. If you uphold them without transgression, you may remain free of blemish. If you cannot, relying solely on the register of preparatory cultivation to ascend directly in the future may not meet expectations. The ordained should diligently uphold and not violate them. The ordaining master, at the altar, should further instruct thus:\n\nFirst, you must first honor the incense and flame of the Three Perfected. The Three Perfected are the Dao, the Scriptures, and the Master—also called the Three Honored Ones. As an ordained disciple, your name is now inscribed in the Jade Register; you must not newly serve base earthly spirits or heterodox deities. All blood sacrifices and offerings not arising from self-cultivation of the True are called demonic ghosts. From this day forward, if you have previously served gods or spirits before ordination, you may now ritually send them off. By “ritual,” I mean preparing incense, flowers, wine, fruit, and scriptures to dispatch them—never serve them again. If you have previously worshipped the Buddha before ordination, you must establish the altar of the Supreme Three Honored Ones above the Buddha’s position; you must not allow the Buddha to overshadow the position of the Most High.\n\nSecond, after ordination, you must diligently tend the incense and flame, strictly observe fasting and precepts, and practice reciting true scriptures. By “true scriptures,” I refer to texts such as the *Scripture of Salvation* and the *Chapter on Generating the Spirit*. As an ordained disciple, you should study the *Daoist Scriptures* to distinguish yourself for future ascension. If you persist in delusion and disbelief, rejecting the Dao, the Three Officials shall investigate and deduct twenty years from your lifespan.\n\nThird, after ordination, you must cultivate a heart of kindness and compassion. You must not secretly scheme against the good, harbor envy toward the worthy and sagely, or sow discord and incite litigation. You yourself must not utter falsehoods or deceptions, devise plots to frame the innocent, amass excessive wealth, covet superficial gains, or swallow the possessions of the poor and weak to enrich yourself. If, after ordination, you do not reform past misdeeds, after receiving the precepts, the Guardian Spirit Kings shall report to the Three Officials, who will revoke your blessings.\n\nFourth, after ordination, you must purify body and mind, gradually distancing yourself from desire. You must not gaze upon the young and beautiful, indulge in brothels, or commit unlawful or improper acts. From this day forward, sever thoughts of spousal relations; there are also times of precept observance. Maintain regular practice, and ghosts and spirits shall hold you in awe—the ranks of immortals draw near.\n\nFifth, after ordination, you must cultivate frugality in diet. You must not arbitrarily slaughter the six livestock, indulging in rich and fatty foods, which disturb and disorder your true nature. If you can maintain a daily vegetarian diet, it is especially excellent. If you cannot yet abstain from meat, you should at least observe a morning vegetarian fast. If even this is not possible, you may fast on the Three Origins, Eight Nodes, Gengshen, Jiazi, and your own birthday. On the day before the fast, abstain from desire; on the fast day itself, abstain from meat; on the third day, act as you please. Practicing thus is quite manageable. If you cannot uphold these precepts, relying solely on this fasting practice as preparatory cultivation, expecting future ascension, may not meet expectations. Moreover, you risk punishment: the Three Officials shall investigate, and the cold night’s wind-knives shall become your burden.\n\nSixth, after ordination, in all matters, restrain the mind. Beyond clothing and food, follow nature without deliberate pursuit. If you seek the heavens to nourish beings, even birds and beasts are constantly provided for with insects and grains. How much more so for humans born between heaven and earth—how could there be no allotted blessings? Each has a destined portion; do not exhaust your mind and thoughts in vain.",

      "translated_text": "Seventh, once ordained, let compassion and mercy guide your heart, and constantly practice hidden virtue. Hidden virtue means acting without others knowing—quietly performing acts of convenience as your strength allows. Where you can, do so: redress wrongs for the wronged; mediate conflicts for those in dispute; reconcile discord among kin; gently guide disobedient juniors with reason; feed the hungry and thirsty; heal the sick and suffering; clothe and nourish the cold and starving. If others wrong you, do not dwell on it; if you wrong others, reflect and repay them. Practicing thus, you may accumulate blessings for the human and heavenly realms. If you fail to do so, relying solely on preparatory cultivation to expect ascension may lead you astray—ponder this deeply.\n\nEighth, once ordained, if your ancestors remain in the netherworld while you seek ascension for yourself, have you not heard the scriptures say: *\"Seven generations ascend, forever freed from the ghostly officials\"*? And the *Three Invocations Hymn* states: *\"Seven generations born in heavenly halls.\"* Thus, the ancients who cultivated the Dao first delivered their distant ancestors before attaining transcendence themselves. If those ancestors remain undelivered, the root of death persists, and you cannot ascend. To deliver them, must you forcibly expend gold and silk to perform the *Nine Netherworld Yellow Register* rites? Rather, the key is to broadly accumulate hidden merit, seeking to perform merit without cost. The most fitting method is the *Great Ultimate Refinement and Deliverance* of Master Ge Xianweng—a practice simple and easy, requiring little expense. If you cannot perform it yourself, engage a virtuous ritual master each month to conduct it on your behalf, accumulating hidden merit to deliver your ancestors. Then, when you ascend in the future, you will do so without shame.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"If an ordained person has a relative who is a monk, and each month has them recite scriptures and confer the Netherworld Precepts to deliver the deceased, is this sufficient? Must one perform the Great Ultimate Refinement?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"An ordained person is now a disciple of the Dao, having received the supreme grace of the Most High, registered in the Jade Calendar as a mortal destined for transcendence beyond the immortal realms. If you wish to deliver your ancestors, even the Buddha’s vehicle could liberate them—but as a Dao disciple, you should not follow another teaching. You must perform the Great Ultimate Refinement rites of your own tradition to be proper and correct. If you act ignorantly or mistakenly, the Nine Bureaus will investigate, the Four Offices will impose penalties. Who will bear the blame? Strive with diligence.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "shall investigate, and the cold night’s wind-knives shall become your burden.\n\nSixth, after ordination, in all matters, restrain the mind. Beyond clothing and food, follow nature without deliberate pursuit. If you seek the heavens to nourish beings, even birds and beasts are constantly provided for with insects and grains. How much more so for humans born between heaven and earth—how could there be no allotted blessings? Each has a destined portion; do not exhaust your mind and thoughts in vain.",

      "translated_text": "Ninth: Having already received deliverance, one must treat all beings with equanimity. Regard all—whether foe or kin—as equal. Let no small grievance breed great enmity, nor private resentment obstruct public justice. Remember that this body is not your own, and balance both gratitude and resentment. Do not persist in delusion, lest you fall into the karmic consequences of this life. If you wish to deliver others, apply your thoughts with utmost care.\n\nTenth: All true immortals ascend to perfection only after cultivating practice and nurturing refinement. Now, though you have received deliverance, it is not through your own cultivation but by dedicating merit at the altar in advance, differing from those who, upon death, must pass through hell before ascending to the Cinnabar Heaven. While this may serve as a provisional means of deliverance, it is not as fitting as cultivating practice yourself. In self-cultivation, preserving authenticity and upholding integrity come first; reciting scriptures and maintaining a vegetarian diet follow. Yet the Daoist gate is vast, its methods manifold, and the entry point may prove arduous. Without innate spiritual capacity, even in old age, one may never encounter a perfected master’s guidance. Now, through this deliverance, I briefly outline the method of cultivation, lest you remain ignorant of the path and find yourself adrift before the boundless ocean of sagely attainment. It is better to withdraw the mind inward, observe within, and let no worldly affairs disturb you. Before engaging in any endeavor, collect the mind in silent sitting; stability and wisdom will arise naturally, and the Jade Clarity realm will appear in clarity. This is what is meant by the great stability of divine radiance. Through this, one may gradually transcend birth and death, escape the cycles of rebirth, and ascend naturally without need for further cultivation. If your roots are not firm and you hear this with doubt or hesitation, unable to maintain practice, then at least observe the precepts, wear the talismans of preemptive merit, and await future deliverance. Do you comprehend my words? Only after full understanding may you ascend the altar to receive deliverance.\n\nFrom the severing of the corpse-soul onward, these instructions may be recorded in ritual manuals and recited at the altar to admonish those receiving deliverance to cultivate in advance. Once the recipient has been enlightened with the Ten Precepts and received the talismans for extinguishing evil roots, they may then enter the altar and undergo the refining through water and fire.\n\nThe master said: The water and fire preemptive refinement of the delivered refers to the formal procedure. The recipient is not a dead soul—how can they enter water and fire? Why is it called \"refinement and deliverance\"? They fail to consider that in ordinary people, the nine orifices are obstructed, the body does not generate spirit, and they merely inhabit a form, borrowing qi to move. This refinement does not temper the form but the spirit. Once the spirit within the body is smelted, the body naturally radiates light, and the golden tower and jade chamber generate spirit without fail. When spirit is generated, the corpse perishes and the po-soul falls away; the yang spirit remains whole, naturally free from calamity and demonic interference, able to ascend to the realm of transcendence. If the spirit is not refined, the hun-soul weakens while the po-soul flourishes, the corpse’s dust obscures clarity, illness arises easily, and death approaches swiftly, consigning one to the rank of lower ghosts. Even with preemptive merit, one cannot rely on it for transcendence. Practitioners must awaken to this truth.\n\n**Method for Preemptive Refinement of the Delivered through Water and Fire**\n\nThe master said: For those who have accumulated preemptive merit, set up the refinement altar as usual. According to the method, guide the recipient to first enter the water pool, where talismans are burned and rituals performed. Then proceed to the fire pool, where talismans are burned and rituals performed. Only after both are completed are the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts conferred, along with the preemptive treasure talismans, before the altar is dismissed.\n\n**True Water Talisman for Scouring Corpse-Dust**\n*Incantation:*\nPure and cool jade liquid, sweet dew cascading.\nYellow blossoms flow forth, the jade body naturally fragrant.\nWithin cleansed, without purified, the po-soul refined, the hun-soul dissolved.\nScouring the filth of the heart, the five viscera cool.\nA hundred passages unobstructed, refining into pure yang.\n\n**Talisman for Bathing the Essence in the Water Pool**\n*Incantation:*\nThree barriers purified, a hundred joints freely flowing.\nBathing the true spirit, effulgent liquid merging.\nIrrigating the womb’s stagnation, extinguishing demonic malevolence.\nThe flower pool overflows, suffusing the three palaces.\nThe true body sealed, ultimately achieving immortal attainment.\n\n**Talisman for Irrigating the True Origin in the Water Pool**\n*Incantation:*\nWashing the womb, dispersing stagnation, untying knots, opening the heart.\nSpirit complete, qi replete, the body radiant with light.\nMyriad spirits pay homage, the name inscribed in the Upper Clarity.\nNo loss, no transmigration, ascending to the rank of immortal perfected.\n\n**Talisman for Refining the Yin Corpse with Fire to Open Peace**\n(This is the true fire of the Three Luminaries’ radiant clarity.)\n*Incantation:*\nWith yang scouring yin, with qi merging spirit.\nSpirit and qi inter-refined, naturally attaining perfection.\nLight suffuses the three fields, the four limbs no longer yin.\nNine orifices freely flowing, a hundred joints at peace.\nThe sun’s qi brightens, the moon’s light gleams pure.\nThe two forces harmonize, the three luminaries shine as one.\nRefining into spirit-yang, to fortify the mortal body.\n\n**Talisman for Forging Yin Demons with Fire to Return Yang**\n*Incantation:*\nCinnabar Heaven’s true fire, smelting spirit-yang.\nCorpse and po-soul burned to ash, hun-soul strong, body healthy.\nMyriad qi harmoniously surging, the body guarded by yang light.\nWith yang refining yin, yin wanes while yang flourishes.\nWith yang refining the true, the true is complete and qi returns.\nYang arises in the jade chamber, light penetrating the Hall of Clarity.\nQi returns to the root, steadfast and boundlessly efficacious.\n\n**Talisman for Refining and Rebirth to Transform the Substance**\n*Incantation:*\nTrue fire blazing bright, illuminating the spirit chamber.\nTrue qi surging and merging, wisdom’s sun radiant.\nTrue fire refines the form, corpse and evil vanish.\nThe decaying corpse flees, the seven po-souls scatter.\nThe dharma-body, the true body, refined and reborn, the substance transformed.\nHaving received deliverance and refinement, ascending to receive the Jade Decree.\n\nAfter the water and fire refinement, the recipient is first made to stand by the water and fire pools. The master performs the rituals, guiding them through the water pool, then the fire pool. Once refinement is complete, the corpse and po-soul are purified, the hun-soul and spirit are secure and strong. Thus, one may enjoy a century of blessings and partake in the preemptive merit of the retreat.\n\nThe master said: The faithful who receive deliverance shall be granted the talismans and precepts of preemptive cultivation.\n\nHere ends the twentieth scroll of *The Great Law of the Supreme Mystery of the Jade Hall of the Three Heavens*.",

The civil officials exist to preside over their respective duties. Together, they are called *shen* [spirits]. These spirits are not the dark and hidden ghosts of yin, but rather, those who inherit the teachings and cultivate without ceasing, their bones and form uniting with the immortal, their worldly toils utterly exhausted. In the Jade Hall and Golden Palace, none fail to generate spirits. Whatever the heart commands, all become generals and officials. Thus it is said: Heaven and earth unite with me, and I unite with heaven and earth. Spirits and humans assist me, and I assist spirits and humans. Essence and *qi* merge as one, swiftly guarding my true self. This is the meaning.\n\nIf one wishes to know the spirits within one’s own body, one must gather the spirit and sit in stillness. Once the celestial vault is settled and human desires are undisturbed, at that very moment, the true generals will appear before you.

In heaven, each day, three spirit-generals follow the body’s *shen*:\n\nThe general who never leaves the body, named Ziying.\nThe general who never leaves the heart, named Xuanpin.\nThe general who never leaves the spirit, named Changxian.\n\nTheir attendant officials and soldiers are innumerable.

For they heedlessly lose their true nature, unaware and unknowing, and do not believe that the body can attain the immortal rank. Those who follow the teaching must act contrary to worldly people, not drifting aimlessly entangled in the web of karma. Thus, Master Huan said: *Abiding in the vastness of the Great Void, I do not mingle with the multitude of beings.* For one must not blend with worldly people as one among them.\n\nIf you wish to see your spirit, first stabilize your heart. When your heart is stable, delusions too will stabilize. When delusions are stable, the heart remains ever clear. Throughout the twelve hours, apart from eating, maintain subtle mindfulness, burn incense, regulate the breath, close the eyes and contemplate emptiness. Nurture the breath continuously, embrace the light in silence. Practice this regularly, and delusive thoughts will not arise. The celestial true ones will return to the body, and within stillness, the heart will be seen—the spirit will manifest of itself. Though this method may not yet lead to true attainment, it serves as a means for disciples to gather the spirit, preventing entanglement in deliberate action and fruitless toil. Take heed, do not neglect it.\n\n**Method for Deploying Generals with the Red Talisman**\n\nThe Master said: Immortals and Daoists whose yang spirit and *qi* are abundant respond as they are directed, thus they command without commanding, are numinous without being numinous. Worldly Daoists, entangled in the web of the mundane, have not yet attained communion with the immortals and must rely on visualization to seek response. When dispatching generals or circulating the spirit, first close the breath and stabilize the heart. Do not speak to others, nor glance back. Visualize your heart as a red sun, within which resides a certain general, fully robed and capped, the size of a bean. Presently, they ascend upon golden light, growing to about three inches. Then they emerge from the mouth, standing beside the body, gradually expanding to human size.",

Dispatch them as the matter requires, and when the talisman is sent forth, it too transforms into the general’s form.\n\nNow, the heart is the convergence of human spirit. Among the five organs, it is called the \"Lord,\" its station most exalted, its function vast. Thus it governs fire and corresponds to the southern direction.

Thirty scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n**The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Rites, Scroll Twenty-Two**\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: Preserving and Controlling the Kalpic Turnings**\n\nThe Master said: The Great Dao gives birth to the Primordial Heaven; the Primordial Heaven gives birth to the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate gives birth to the Two Modes. Thereafter, the Five Phases divide, and the Eight Trigrams array themselves. Fortune and misfortune are determined, and the powers of punishment and virtue arise. Thus, Heaven holds the yang above, its three luminaries radiant and bright. Earth holds the yin below, its five peaks standing in majestic stillness. Humanity receives the numinous within, possessing all things in abundance, thereby completing the Three Powers and establishing the Ultimate.\n\nYet those confined by form cannot transcend their form; those bound by fate cannot escape their fate. Thus, when stars deviate from their courses, floods and fires bring great disasters. When Metal and Wood clash in punishment, the Five Phases restrain and overcome one another. Any deviation brings nothing but fortune or misfortune, leading to celestial portents: stars wander from their paths, drought and flood contend. Earthly portents: mountains collapse, waters boil, the earth quakes, seas dry up. Human portents: bandits and barbarians arise, warfare erupts in season.\n\nSuch are the calamitous fates. Therefore, the Most High established the Teachings of Great Peace, providing talismans to control them. To ensure Heaven’s enduring existence, one must first preserve and control the kalpic turnings. This chapter is established to weave through Heaven and Earth, protect the state and pacify the household, deliver people from the disasters of the *yang jiu*, and elevate the world to the fortune of Great Peace. Is this not excellent?\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dispelling Comets**\n\nThe Master said: Whenever comets or inauspicious stars appear, one should present the *Star-Dispelling Talisman* and recite the *Scripture of the Eleven Luminaries of the Numinous Treasure*.\n\n**The Most High’s Star-Dispelling Talisman**\n*Incantation:*\nCelestial talismans traverse the world, preserving and controlling inauspicious stars.\nWhen celestial paths lose their order, follow the talisman and align with the scripture.\nThe Emperor’s decree is in hand, bringing tranquility and peace.\nTurning misfortune into fortune, malevolent spirits conceal their forms.\nBy the command of the Talisman of Great Peace, star officials obey.\nAs proclaimed, so shall it be.\n\n**The Dipper’s Light for Controlling Stars**\n\nThe Master said: Use the great majestic true light of the Celestial Dipper to shatter evil and malevolence, thereby transforming calamity into blessing. Arrange the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the four directions, and within them, array the Twelve Earthly Branches, controlling them with the Dipper’s light. Place three lamps at each position, except for the central Dipper’s position and those of the Sun and Moon, where only one lamp is set. Use sesame oil, keeping the lamps alight for three days and nights, reciting the incantation at the three periods.\n\nAt each position, hang a red banner inscribed with the *Star-Dispelling Talisman*. After three days, burn them facing the Gate of Heaven.\n\n**Incantation at the Three Periods upon the Altar**\nThe Dipper exists in Heaven, its might governing the starry heavens.\nThe power of the Dipper’s fire annihilates all misfortune.\nMalevolent stars and baleful *qi* dare display their omens.\nThe Dipper’s fire, ten thousand *zhang* in height, purifies the ten directions.\nStars and baleful forces retreat, malevolent spirits hide in concealment.\nFollowing the scriptures of Heaven, the nation prospers.\nReceiving Heaven’s talisman, no disaster can harm.\nThe harmonious *qi* of the Four Heavens eternally preserve *li* and *zhen*.\nShould any dare disobey, seize and deliver them to the Dipper’s might.\nI invoke the teachings of the Most High Lord Lao, by command, to save and seize.\nRecite secretly at the three periods, without counting repetitions.\n\n**Ritual of Pouring Wine and Sprinkling Water**\n\n---\n\n**Method for Dispelling Solar Eclipses**\n\nThe Master said: When yin evil encroaches upon yang, the Sun and Moon are eclipsed.

If bandits have not yet mobilized, they may be suppressed through ritual; if already in motion, their threat may be lightened, and they will be unable to inflict harm.\n\nThe method requires forty-nine Daoists to establish an altar, prepare the offering, and present memorials in the usual manner. At the time of the ritual, recite the *Incantation for Laying Down Arms* and bury the *Talisman for Halting Weapons* outside the western gate. Arrange the Seven Stars in their pattern, inscribing talismans on bricks and burying them likewise.\n\nThe western gate refers to the west of the capital for a kingdom, the west of the prefectural seat for a commandery, and the west of the county seat for a district. At night, light the Venus Lamp, burn the talismans, and peace will be secured.\n\n**Method for Burying Talismans to Dispel Bandits**\nUse new bricks, inscribe in cinnabar, and bury at the western gate of the city. Arrange the Seven Stars in their pattern, also inscribing talismans on bricks and burying them.\n\n**Seven Stars Talisman for Averting Disaster**\nInscribe in cinnabar on red paper.

The karmic force of sentient beings invokes these afflictions; Heaven has no intent. The Most High, in boundless compassion, provides this exorcism so the people may dwell in peace.\n\nLocusts arise when winter snow fails to fall, and insects breed within the yin. The malevolent, borne by fire, grow wings and take flight in summer, ravaging seedlings and crops. The eggs of these pests, once touched by the *qi* of snow, burrow three *chi* into the earth. After three snows, they descend nine *chi*. If snow is absent for a year, they rise three *chi*; if scarce for three years, drought follows, and locusts emerge as a plague.\n\nTo suppress and dispel them, erect an altar and hold a *jiao* ritual. Dispatch officials to drive them into water with drums and wind, and petition the *Fú* Spirit to gather the malevolent insects.\n\n**Talisman to Dispel Locusts**\nInscribe on yellow paper with vermilion ink. Face the *Xun* direction, pace the Dipper, and burn the talisman. Turn toward the south, recite the incantation thirty-six times, and spray water. After three days, if the ritual succeeds, wind will rise and locusts will enter the water.\n\nAlso, take two chestnut boards, inscribe a talisman on each, and nail one where the locusts originated. Erect the other on a high frame and burn it with chestnut wood.\n\n**Incantation:**\nFlames of the Vermilion Bird of the south,\nBlazing with the might of *Bing* and *Ding*.\nWings born of lost salvation,\nSpawned like dust in swarms.\nThe Nine August Ones conceal primordial chaos,\nAuspicious snow drives them into hiding.\nFire’s *qi* breeds malevolence,\nNurturing harm to the roots of crops.\nI summon the Earth God and the Lord of Locusts,\nThe *Fú* Spirit of command.\nDrums stir boundless winds,\nSweeping them into the sea’s depths.\nMalevolent pests scatter,\nCrops rejoice in autumn’s harvest.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\n\n**Method to Pray for Rain During Drought**\nThe Master says: When prolonged drought persists despite prayers, local officials must act with compassion for the people. Submit a petition at the altar, beseeching rain. The ritual master prepares the words, submitting memorials to the Three Heavens and the Heavenly Master’s court, and petitions all relevant realms.\n\nThen, open the altar, pace the *gang*, perform the rites, and summon the dragon spirits, with three, five, or seven days as the standard. Once rain falls sufficiently, hold a separate *jiao* to give thanks. If the rain is inadequate, use the method to hasten it.\n\n**Talisman to Summon Dragons**\nInscribe on black paper with vermilion ink. Pace the Dipper beneath the moon, face the *gang* to gather *qi*, and affix the talisman to the petition. Dispatch the Heavenly Soldiers to summon the dragon spirits, who will arrive at once.\n\n**Talisman to Drive Dragons and Bring Rain**\nInscribe on black paper with white powder. Burn in the incense censer, offering incense thrice daily—great efficacy is assured.\n\n**Incantation:**\nHeaven and earth’s *qi* unite,\nYin and yang harmonize.\nDragons ride clouds and mist—\nDare they disobey?\nSweet rains moisten the land,\nDrought demons vanish.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands.\n\nAfter reciting, face the moon, turn toward the *gang*, and spray water.

Thirty scrolls in total.\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category.\n\n---\n\n*The Supreme Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method, Scroll Twenty-Three*\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Severing Corpse Parasites**\n\nThe Master said: Those born in the Lower Era are ever beset by calamities. In this degenerate age, the roots of death pass unbroken from one generation to the next. Of all afflictions, corpse parasites are the most pernicious—transmitted by the Nine Worms, yet also arising when ordinary men exhaust their minds, deplete their strength, injure their *qi*, and squander their essence. Once the true [essence] is depleted at its root, perverse [influences] begin to spread without limit. Thus, the Mysterious Origin pities the world and provides methods for healing.\n\nYet the manifestations of illness are manifold, and the modes of contagion vary. Even houses and food may gradually transmit [the affliction], while clothing and *qi* readily entangle [the victim]. Only by severing the roots of death can one hope to restore the *qi* of life. Therefore, this chapter presents methods to relieve suffering and toil.\n\n---\n\n**Method for Treating House-Transmitted [Disease]**\nThe Master said: In abandoned dwellings and empty rooms, where human traces seldom reach, the *qi* of illness lingers even after years have passed. When a house stands vacant, its chambers sealed and stagnant, yin darkness congeals, and perverse *qi* fails to disperse—thus, the poison of suffering remains. Whoever first opens the door and enters receives its toxin; those with weakened spirits suffer its misfortune.\n\nAt the onset of infection, the hair bristles, the spine and back grow cold with shivers—these are its signs. The disease lurks in the numinous palace, lodges in the Mud Pill, and spreads to the four limbs. Over time, the illness finally erupts: gasping, coughing blood, flesh and bones withering, alternating chills and fever, dreams and spirits inverted—these are the symptoms of house-transmitted [disease].\n\nTo sever house-transmitted [disease], one must reside where contagion has occurred. After one month, swiftly return to the Great Dao and administer urgent treatment—then eight or nine out of ten will recover. Otherwise, as the contagion deepens over time, the disease grows more severe, and death draws near. Even divine power will be of no avail.\n\n**Talisman for Treating House-Transmitted [Disease]**\nTake a new brick, grind raw cinnabar in sunlight, face east, clasp the Northern Emperor mudra, and gather solar *qi* to inscribe it. On a *jia* or *ding* day at noon, bury it in the central courtyard at a depth of three *chi* and six *cun*. At the moment of burial, the ritual master paces the *gang*, wields the sword, sprays water, transforms into the Celestial Snail, and recites the incantation:\n\n**Incantation:**\n*\"Hark! Ghostly convulsions, swiftly depart the central courtyard!\nThe *gang* fire towers ten thousand *zhang*, lightning flashes and bells stream.\nScatter the ghostly *qi* with burning, sever and strike down demonic spirits.\nCorpse-transmitting and pestilence ghosts—hear this talisman and flee at once!\nPlunge ten thousand *zhang* into the earth, dissolve into fine dust.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**Talismans for the Four Corners and Eight Directions of the Patient’s Room**\nInscribe on catalpa or cypress slips with cinnabar, then nail them to the eight directions. Use the *qi* of the Three Origins’ Demon-Slaying Talisman to purge perverse *qi*, after which tranquility will prevail.\n\n**Method for Inscribing the Talismans:**\nTransform the spirit, pace the *gang*, revolve the body into the Dipper, and draw *qi* to inscribe them.\n\n**East**\n**West**",

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Methods for Treating Clothing Transmission**\n\nFor the method of treating clothing transmission, use talismans to fumigate the garments, then roll them up with the talisman and cast them into flowing water—do not look back. If the illness has not yet taken form, ingest the *Three Luminaries Qi Talisman* for a month, and recovery may follow. If the disease has persisted for two or three months, it may be difficult to cure. After one month, the *Inquiry and Relief Talisman* must be employed.\n\n**Talisman for Treating Clothing Transmission**\nAssume the Dipper Hand Seal, face the moon’s establishment, and recite the names of the Dipper thirty-six times. Dip the brush and inscribe the talisman, then fumigate with its smoke to attain peace. Next, place the talisman with the object and cast it into flowing water—do not turn back to look. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"The celestial talisman bears command, entering the Dipper’s midst.\nGhosts and spirits tremble in fear, vanquishing malevolent forces.\nThe Azure Dragon guards the left, the White Tiger the right.\nThe Vermilion Bird leads ahead, the Dark Warrior follows behind.\nTransmitted afflictions and flying corpses—traces and tracks obliterated.\nShould any dare remain, the Dipper’s fire and flying blades shall strike.\nBuried ten thousand fathoms deep, their bodies melted in flame.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**Method for Treating Food Transmission**\nThe Master says: The method for treating food transmission arises when one inadvertently consumes the remnants of a patient’s food, drink, or medicine, thereby contracting their pathogenic *qi* in the heart and abdomen, which may also cause illness. Generally, food transmission is still treatable, but transmission through dwellings or clothing allows perverse *qi* to penetrate deeply, making the affliction severe and difficult to remedy. In food transmission, if the patient has not yet died, the pathogenic *qi* has not fully taken hold, so it remains treatable. If treatment is delayed, however, it may become incurable over time, evolving into a grave illness—this must not be overlooked.\n\nThe method employs thirty-six talismans, burned together to produce smoke, which the patient must inhale and swallow—force them if necessary—until both talismans and smoke are fully consumed. Initially, fumigation may be difficult, but after some time, it becomes easier. The patient may feel phlegm rising in the throat and should cough and spit it out. Copious sputum and coughing, especially thick saliva, are particularly favorable. If the pathogenic *qi* is shallow, phlegm will be scant; if deep, violent vomiting with profuse saliva will occur, ensuring recovery. Once the perverse *qi* is expelled, further fumigation is unnecessary. Instead, ingest the *Three Luminaries Talisman* to replenish depleted *qi* and restore vitality. For a month, strictly avoid alcohol, lust, joy, and anger to ensure peace.\n\n**Talisman for Treating Food Transmission**\nAssume the Dipper Hand Seal, align with the Dipper’s *qi*, and inscribe thirty-six talismans on yellow paper with cinnabar. Burn them as incense. The incantation reads:\n\n*\"Solemnly command the soul’s essence, luminous and radiant.\nThe Three Fields grow tranquil, the corpse’s spirit flees its form.\nLaboring ghosts disperse, the Nine *Qi* unite as one.\nThe talisman’s Dipper swiftly slays, no laboring affliction shall intrude.\nFlying infestations hasten away, ghostly maladies turn to dust.\nPiercing limbs and entering the abdomen, all malevolent vapors swept clean.\nTrue *qi* guards the body, upright *qi* endures forever.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\n**General Method for Treating Corpse Transmission**\nThe Master says: In treating corpse transmission, one must understand its intricacies. Among the Nine Worms, six transmit across six generations, while three do not. The stomach worm, roundworm, and tapeworm may arise from visceral toxins or familial transmission, passing down the six worms. Roughly every ten days, they traverse the four limbs in cycles, repeating endlessly. They feed every three days, retreating after five, and during their active phase, the body aches as they consume flesh. When they retreat, they return to their lairs, inducing a drunken stupor lasting five days, during which the illness temporarily subsides. This is the opportune moment to administer talismans and medicine. Otherwise, the worms grow accustomed to the power of talismans and remedies, making treatment difficult.\n\nA single worm occupies twelve lairs in the body; six worms occupy seventy-two. In a month, the first ten days see them travel from the heart to the head, roaming four lairs. The middle ten days, from the heart to the navel, roaming four limbs. The last ten days, from the navel to the feet, roaming four limbs. When administering medicine or talismans, this cycle must be observed. Thus, the classic states: Treatment within sixty days yields an eighty to ninety percent success rate. Within one hundred eighty days, thirty to forty percent. Beyond this, survival is uncertain.\n\nThose who pursue the worms’ original essence among the people often employ deceptive techniques, fabricating worms for profit—conduct befitting beasts. Instead, ingest the *Purple Court Talisman* at night, prepare an oil cauldron, and keep the surroundings brightly lit. The moment live worms appear, capture and fry them in oil, then cast them into flowing water—do not look back. However, success occurs in only one or two out of ten cases, for such forces cannot be defied. If the patient’s illness is mild, the worms may be invisible and untraceable, appearing only in dreams as figures bidding farewell—this is the sign.

      "translated_text": "These all are those bound by fate and confined by form. Thus arises the method for averting misfortune and prolonging life. Yet if one’s form transcends the formless, if one’s fate merges with the fathomless, if things bear no blemish, if spirits emit no ominous resonance—what misfortune could there be to avert?\n\nNevertheless, worldly people remain ensnared in the dusty net, stained by illusory attachments and habitual defilements. Without the salvific power of ritual dissolution, how could they escape the torment of calamity and peril? Moreover, hunger and satiety, toil and exertion, heat and dampness, wind and cold—any deviation from proper regulation may readily harm the primordial *qi*. Further, when stars of annual misfortune descend in conjunction, when monthly afflictions align upon the body, when yearly and cyclical forces clash, when dwellings prove inauspicious, when vows made to heaven are spoken with duplicity, when curses cast upon others rebound upon oneself, when malevolent spirits possess women, when flying earth and flying calamity startle and injure infants—even the slightest lapse may trigger disaster. Without recourse to the subtle and profound, who could transcend such trials?\n\nTherefore, this chapter expounds in detail the methods for delivering others.\n\n**The Secret Memorial to the Dipper for Averting Misfortune**\nAlas! The unlearned, deluded by the dust of toil; the urban and courtly, buried in the pursuit of profit and rank—desiring to cherish life yet lacking means to prolong it, wishing to escape misfortune yet devoid of methods to avert it. All this stems from fate’s predetermination and the constraints of form. Since their embodiment has not yet penetrated the true and real, they naturally struggle to withstand the turning of karmic cycles. Whenever the hundred-and-six calamities threaten, secretly memorializing the Dipper of the lofty heavens becomes the secret to preserving life and ensuring wholeness, the mystery of dispelling disaster and atoning for transgressions. This method serves as the urgent recourse for ordinary people, the vital path to reviving life. Yet if one cultivates the supreme Dao, awakens to true emptiness, possesses abundant *qi* and complete spirit, enjoys bodily peace and well-being—why would one need to borrow another’s power for ritual dissolution?\n\n**Purification Altar Talisman**\nFor purifying all altars and dissolving impurities, use this talisman. First, transform the spirit into the attire of a perfected one, visualize nine phoenixes crowning the head, the four numinous beasts arrayed in guard, radiance manifesting before the fingers, and the four Dippers shielding the body.\n\n*Incantation:* □□□□□□□.\nVisualize the Dipper entering the water.",

Your servant now follows ancient rites, solemnly establishing the Seven Star Lamps, erecting the altar for a secret offering, and proceeding as prescribed—arraying and kindling the pure lamps to divine fortune and misfortune.\n\nYour servant now calms the spirit and steadies the will, nurturing qi and returning to the spirit. At this auspicious moment, I submit this memorial, humbly entreating the Imperial Perfected Ones to descend and condescend to witness my sincere heart, granting your servant’s petition. The remaining details shall be proclaimed in the secret offering ritual.\n\nNext, in utmost reverence, I invite the Seven Primordials to descend, receive this memorial, and through the brightness or dimness of the lamps, discern fortune or misfortune. By the power of your majestic numen, may all wishes be fulfilled.\n\nNext, circumambulate the lamps three times, reciting the incantation forty-nine times:\nBright lamps gather light, wandering spirits do not flee.\nThe seven po return to their abodes, the myriad spirits all submit.\nAt midday, shadows align, ever dwelling in radiance.\nHasten! As the statute commands.\n\nRecite further:\nFollowing the celestial stem, erecting the Dipper, the ritual torch ignites the stars.\nThe Seven Kings descend—primordial, prosperous, steadfast, and upright.\n\nNext, establish the central lamp facing the Dipper, burn the talismans in sequence into each lamp’s basin, and visualize the circulation as prescribed. Place the life talisman in a water basin before the lamps.\n\nDivining by the Lamps:\nAt the *Greedy Wolf* lamp, divine one’s position—brightness portends fortune, dimness misfortune.\nAt the *Giant Gate* lamp, divine lifespan—brightness is auspicious, dimness ominous.\nAt the *Salary Storage* lamp, divine fortune and virtue—brightness is fortunate; dimness calls for expiation, almsgiving, and prayer.\nAt the *Literary Brilliance* lamp, divine official rank—brightness brings promotion, dimness stagnation.\nAt the *Integrity Chastity* lamp, divine marriage—brightness signifies union, dimness separation.\nAt the *Military Brilliance* lamp, divine illness—brightness brings recovery, dimness suffering.\nAt the *Broken Army* lamp, divine servants, disputes, conflicts, or pursuit of thieves—brightness brings success, dimness failure.\n\nFor households divining illness or misfortune, observe the seven lamps of the Dipper. One must be devout, wholeheartedly attending to the signs and offering repayment. Sweep and purify the ritual chamber, ensuring no gaps; do not permit women to peer in, and guard against cats or dogs disrupting the space. Burn fine incense in a blazing fire, and perform the rite in the stillness of night.\n\nIf the lamps burn brightly with long, steady flames, all affairs shall be auspicious. If the lamps are dim with short, scattered, or flickering flames, misfortune looms.\n\nA blue flame signals a lingering corpse in the dwelling—qi stagnation invites exorcism, quarrels, restless nights, and disturbances among the young and yin.\nA red flame signals wandering souls, plague ghosts, earthly calamities, blood taboos, flying soil, or sudden disasters and anomalies.\nA white flame signals legal disputes, external mourning, fright, terror, or household unrest.\nA black flame signals theft, loss, inauspicious travel, lingering illness, earthly offenses, or unfulfilled vows.\nIf the flame dims then brightens, or brightens then dims, ancestors seek offerings, and kin bring misfortune.\nIf the initial light is unsteady or the oil spills, spirits and ghosts swarm, demons press urgently, laboring insects fly or hide, the sick do not recover, and birth ghosts intrude—such signs defy reversal by prayer.\n\nFor any of the above anomalies, redouble devotion, pray earnestly, and perform the Dipper-pacing rite to subdue them. Do not be negligent.\n\nLife Talisman:\nInvite the descent into the offering.\n\nNext, examine the lamps and present the memorial, subduing and controlling as prescribed.\n\nThe master says: In presenting the memorial, use truthful words, not ornate language, lest one incur the sin of frivolous speech. Beware.\n\nFirst, compose the spirit and steady the will, performing nine bows. Next, dispatch the officials as prescribed. Then pace the Nine Numinosities, contemplating the nine qi. Kneel lengthily, silently submit the memorial, then perform eight bows while presenting it. Visualize your body as a circular azure light, with the Niwan Palace housing a Dipper-shaped star lord, ascending in sequence to the Celestial Gate.\n\nNext, visualize the Northern Dipper’s nine palaces in the heavens, each radiant:\n1. Jade Tower of Azure City.\n2. Five-Colored Jade Tower.\n3. Yellow Terrace Jade Tower.\n4. Vermilion Terrace Jade Tower.\n5. White Terrace Jade Tower.\n6. Mysterious Terrace Jade Tower.\n7. Nine-Colored Primal Qi Jade Tower.\n8. Purple Qi Jade Tower.\n9. Purple Mansion Jade Tower.\n\nEach emits golden light, intersecting with the golden light of the nine palaces within your body. Next, press your tongue against the upper palate, transforming it into a golden bridge connecting the Yellow Path across the void to the Dipper’s mouth. Circulate the plain yellow qi of the Nine Palaces, filling them above and linking to the golden bridge below.\n\nNext, dispatch the Three and Five Merit Officials and the Hidden Numinous Scribes to ascend the bridge. Behold embroidered-robed messengers and the two *Dhuta* envoys bearing the memorial, prostrating beneath the bridge to await commands. After a long while, a golden light ten thousand zhang long descends from the Nine Emperors of the nine palaces, entering the Niwan through the crown. Behold the nine stars of the Niwan merging into one.\n\nNext, bow at the altar’s base and secretly recite the incantation:\nI possess the Three Primordials and Three Imperial Ministers,\nTheir flowing light and blessings guard my form.\nAbove the Niwan, the Heavenly Imperial Minister,\nEngraves the character *Zhao* in the Central Mystery, giving birth.\nIn the Crimson Palace, the Left Assistant Minister,\nFirms the character *Guang* in the Four Transformations’ numen.\nBelow the Yellow Court, the Right Assistant Minister,\nReturns to the character *Ming* in the Valley’s Mystery.\nEntering the Emperor’s chamber, ascending to Highest Clarity,\nI soar on clouds, phoenixes and simurghs cry.\nHasten!

They humbly request the dispatch of officials and clerks, along with the household’s Controller of Fate and Earth God, to guard and protect them. Upon the completion of the one-year term, the vessel shall be opened, and a grand jiao offering shall be held to express gratitude.\n\nEach person shall, according to their age, thread a strip of silk through the aperture, and all shall be placed within the vessel.

On the preceding night, light the Lamp of Extended Life inscribed with the imperial decree. The next morning, proceed to the designated direction, burn incense, perform the divine step of the Dipper, and clasp the Dipper mudra while facing *kan* (Water). Recite the incantation:\n\nHeaven is my canopy,\nEarth is my support.\nThe Northern Dipper’s suspended stars\nAre my raiment.\nI conceal my name within the Seven Kingly Palaces,\nAt the heart of flowing fire,\nTo attain long life, transcend fate,\nAnd enjoy a hundredfold well-being.\nThe *zhi* cannot harm me,\nThe *gan* cannot harm me.\nThose who aid me are the Great Yang;\nThose who oppose me shall perish.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the Emperor decrees.\n\nThen visualize the *qi* of the *gang* filling the *kan* earth, envision the precious pillar as a palace of jade and crystal, and cast the money and silk into the vessel. As the pillar is lowered, affix the talisman, seal the lid, burn incense again, clasp the Dipper mudra, and recite the Great Divine Incantation of the Northern Dipper’s Celestial Center. Command the guardian spirits to their posts, then present offerings of wine, fruit, paper money, and spirit horses to the vessel’s guardians.\n\nAfter one year, when opening the vessel, perform the same visualization and transformation as before.

      "translated_text": "**Method for Dispelling Pestilence**\n\nThe Master said: People live in the world, recklessly exhausting body and mind, deluded by the physical form, unable to circulate and nurture their qi. Thus, wind, cold, summerheat, and dampness assail them from without, while excesses of desire, wine, and food ravage them from within. This causes the true qi of the Four Great Elements in the body to decline, leaving one weak in strength and weary in spirit. When the essence and marrow falter, the primordial qi becomes unstable, and pestilential diseases arise.\n\nIf one could regulate daily life to avoid cold and heat, moderate diet, nurture the illusory body, sever excessive desires to stabilize the primordial essence, and cultivate the true heart to follow the Supreme Dao, then body and spirit would both attain perfection. Qi and blood would radiate brilliance, and one would ascend to transcendence—how then could one suffer from malignant diseases or seek methods to subdue them?\n\nThe *Medical Classic* states: *\"Store essence in winter, and one will not fall ill with pestilence in spring.\"* This is no empty saying.\n\nNow, out of the Most High’s compassion, a method of subjugation is established to deliver those who have lost their true nature and fallen into the kalpas. May they avoid encountering demonic afflictions, and may all people attain benevolence and longevity—this is the fundamental intent of the Most High’s love for life.\n\nFormerly, I once asked the Master: *\"From what cause does this illness arise?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"If one is harmed by cold in winter, pestilence arises in spring. If one is injured by wind in spring, diarrhea occurs in summer. If one is affected by summerheat in summer, malaria and dysentery follow in autumn. If one is struck by dampness in autumn, coughing ensues in winter. This is the general pattern. All are due to the unbalanced qi of the four seasons invading the numinous spirit, where the perverse assails the upright, giving rise to calamity and peril. Thus, the Five Phases are the root of harm to the body, each overcoming and destroying the other. Pestilence arises from the mutual conquest of the Five Phases, hence it is called the Five Pestilences.\"*\n\nThe Master said: *\"The discourse on gods and ghosts began when the Patriarch subdued the Ghost Kings of the Six Heavens and the Five Divisional Ghost Marshals, dispersing the malevolent and expelling the toxic. These were not the yin spirits of the dead. Now, the Patriarch has subjugated the Five Divisions and restored them to the correct path, thus consolidating the authority over pestilence. After swearing oaths to the Patriarch, the ghosts of the Five Divisions long ago returned to the true Dao. Thus, Zhang Yuanbo, through loyalty and sincerity, was appointed as the Direct Attendant of the Thunder Bureau. Zhao Gongming, through awe-inspiring integrity, became the Great General of the Dark Altar. The rest became chieftains of the grim prisons of Fengdu, no longer acting as demons.*\n\n*In recent times, human hearts have grown perverse and deceitful, recklessly worshipping licentious shrines and inviting misfortune upon themselves. Ghosts arise from the mind, and illness stems from delusion. Thus, the demonic factions of the lower realms and the blood-consuming ghosts, receiving offerings, freely perpetrate their poisonous harm. This is not the doing of the Five Divisions after their subjugation, who would never again act recklessly.*\n\n*The human heart is subtly wondrous, with qi and blood circulating throughout. The Three Regions and Eight Sceneries are all imbued with spirit within the true. Thus, one can repel the gods of life and death, becoming an Immortal of Great Sagehood. But if one deviates from proper nurturing, the Nine Orifices become obstructed, the body fails to generate spirit, and one becomes a walking corpse, a ghost borrowing qi, or a witless shade—far beyond the Five Pestilences alone.*\n\n*Now, the Most High’s ancestral method for subduing the Six Heavens and Five Divisions is transmitted to suppress the Five Pestilences, decapitate demonic hordes, and purify the body of pestilential evil with talismans. Then, with the Celestial Talisman, one crushes the disease, and with upright qi, restores tranquility. This is called the Method for Saving the World and Subduing Pestilence.*\n\n**Laojun’s Pestilence-Dispelling Celestial Talisman**\n**Heavenly Master’s Pestilence-Expelling Talisman**",

      "translated_text": "The Master says: Those who have not yet studied the arts cannot ascend in spirit to present themselves before the Emperor, for their mortal forms remain unrefined, their primordial spirits yoked to yin, and thus unable to ascend. They must first engage in visualization to seek communion.\n\nBegin by summoning forth the divine officers and generals, pacing the *gang* in accordance with the method—its steps are recorded in the *Gang* Canon. First, visualize the *qi* of the five viscera, transforming it into the true essence of the Five Phases. Then assemble the jade chariot’s ritual procession, with banners of the sun and moon, within the lower Sea of *Qi*. Mounting a single strand of white *qi*, ascend alongside the officers and functionaries from the western pillar of Mount Kunlun, reaching the realm of the *Gang* Winds, the domain of the sun, moon, and stars. Do not yet ascend further; first pace the *gang* to break through the *Gang* Winds—its steps are found in the *Gang* Canon.\n\nEmerging from the *Gang* Winds, enter the Desire Realm. Tread upon the Nine Spirits to ascend into the Form Realm. Within both the Desire and Form Realms, all appears as the grandeur of earthly officials and wealthy households, yet no structures or traces of buildings are visible—one must perceive this with the heart and awaken to it inwardly. In the Form Realm, the Five Colors surge and billow, *qi* congealing into palaces, though these bear no resemblance to earthly architecture.\n\nNext, pace the *gang* of the Three Realms in their subtle state to reach the Formless Realm. Here, one sees only golden light filling the space before them, with no sound or form to be heard. Beyond lies the realm of the Seed People, a domain of emptiness and Brahmanic *qi*. Riding this Brahmanic *qi*, ascend to the Great Clarity, where vast golden light radiates in all directions—soundless, formless. Within this golden light, the ancestral master appears to bestow the petition.\n\nIn an instant, the light parts, and the sage sits within a white radiance, though no words are spoken. Then present this plea: *\"The celestial light dazzles me; my mortal nature cannot ascend further. I humbly beseech you to manifest in accordance with the private intentions of lesser practitioners, that I may receive the imperial decree.\"* At once, the white light transforms into a chamber—roofless, without beams or tiles, stepless, without stairs or platforms—seeming both present and absent, existent and non-existent. Entering this hall is called \"ascending the hall.\" The appearance of red light is an auspicious omen.\n\nNext, the Jade Hall remains unseen, and as before, golden light fills the space ahead. Following the path of heaven, descend and return to the altar. There, command the summoned officers and generals to capture the pestilential spirits, and so forth.\n\nI, by the Emperor’s decree, assist in the transformations of heaven, aiding the state and saving the people. Now, in the domain of [so-and-so], pestilence spreads unchecked, and peace has not been restored. I have ascended in spirit to the Jade Palace, reverently received the imperial decree, and come to this place. Hearken with utmost sincerity:\n\nThe decree resounds: *Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*",

      "translated_text": "The assembled deities bow their heads in reverence; evil demons return to rightness. Should any dare act with malice, they shall be reduced to dust. Hasten, hasten—upon receipt of this decree, act without delay.\n\nThe proclamation complete, you must swiftly obey the imperial command: expel the poisonous *qi* with all haste, driving it from this barren land. Should any disobey, they shall be bound by the *Ghost Statutes of the Yongshou Era*, and the pestilence-expelling talismans shall be burned to banish them beyond the four seas. Proceed as prescribed.\n\n**Lao Jun’s Talisman for Pacifying the Household and Warding Off Pestilence**\n*East, South, West, North, Upon the Bed, Above the Hearth, Rear-Facing Chamber*\n\nFor each talisman, recite this incantation and inscribe the Three Lights as prescribed:\n*\"I entrust myself to the midst of the Three Lights, within the Dipper’s bowl. A thousand ghosts and ten thousand spirits become my servants; all perverse essences under heaven submit and perish. Swiftly, swiftly—seize, transform, heal, heal! As urgent as an oral command.\"*\n\n**The Northern Emperor’s Mudra and the *Qi* of the Three Lights**\n\n**Method for Treating Consumptive Wasting**\nThe master says: Consumptive wasting arises when the heart is afflicted, causing *qi* to congeal and blood to stagnate. That it manifests as worms is due to wine and lust, immoderate diet, sorrow and joy, grief and chaos—all gradually leading to this state.\n\nWhen worms form, it is because blood has congealed and *qi* has taken advantage. The *qi* that nourishes blood, when in the womb, is upright *qi*; when in the center, it forms accumulations; when it congeals in the heart’s domain, it becomes worms—all stemming from a heart not kept upright, and the karmic conditions of worry and thought.\n\nThe harm caused by the Three Corpses and Nine Worms must be understood in detail. Among the Nine Worms, six are transmitted across six generations, while three are not—such as the stomach’s *cunbai* worm. Some arise from toxins concentrated in the five viscera, or from habitual exposure within a family.\n\nAt the onset of transmission, one feels spirit and energy unsettled, no longer under one’s control, with vexation in the five centers, night sweats from the heart and kidneys, and palpitations. After ten days, the bones suddenly waste away, the face takes on a lustrous sheen, and the symptoms are confirmed.\n\nThe six worms, roughly every ten days, traverse the four limbs in cycles. The disease’s course depends on the *qi*’s generation: after the Beginning of Spring, they begin feeding, consuming for three days, then retreating for five. When they act, the body feels their bite; when they retreat, they return to their lair, drunk and dormant for five days, during which the illness temporarily subsides.\n\nOnly during their drunken retreat may talismans and medicines be administered; otherwise, the worms resist the power of the remedies, and the condition becomes untreatable.\n\nA single worm occupies twelve limbs; six worms occupy seventy-two. In a month’s time: the first ten days, from the heart to the head, they roam the four limbs; the next ten, from the heart to the navel, they roam the four limbs; the last ten, from the navel to the feet, they roam the four limbs. When administering medicine or moxibustion, this must be carefully considered.\n\nThe master further says: To treat consumptive wasting, one must first understand the movement of toxic *qi* and upright *qi*. When congealed in the viscera, they form worms—male if encountered on a yang day, female on a yin day.\n\nThey first consume human fat, appearing white. Once the five viscera and six bowels are damaged, the skin wrinkles and hair falls out; in women, the blood ceases to flow. When the blood vessels are all harmed, they cannot nourish the five viscera and six bowels.\n\nAfter seventy days, they consume human flesh and blood, turning yellow-red, damaging the muscles—hence emaciation, weakness, and inability to eat. The skin and sinews slacken, unable to contract.\n\nAfter two hundred ten days, when flesh and blood are exhausted, they consume the marrow, turning black. When the marrow is eaten, the bones wither, and the patient cannot rise from bed.\n\nLong-standing worms grow hair, their colors motley. They absorb the *qi* of the five viscera and five phases, and after being transmitted to three people, they mature, taking the form of birds. If they enter the kidney meridian, the condition becomes incurable.\n\nThe methods recorded here serve to instruct future generations. Thus, the classics say: If treated within sixty days, seven or eight out of ten may recover.",

Here, the methods transmitted through six generations are recorded with care.\n\n**First Generation:** Refers to the onset of illness, marked by sudden and unusual sensations. The worms resemble infants, all covered in long hair, or take the form of ghosts, or toads—varying in size. They disturb the patient’s soul and dreams, inverting day and night, scattering the *hun* and *po* spirits, dispersing vitality. Appetite wanes, the body aches, and such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *bing*-*ding* days, targeting the heart during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Second Generation:** Refers to the transmission of consumptive phlegm. The worms resemble tangled silk, about three *cun* long, or house lizards, centipedes, or shrimp. They induce a perpetual stupor, visions of the deceased at night, and joyful yet spirit-draining dreams. The chest feels full and oppressed, weakness and confusion deepen, and spontaneous sweating with fever arises. Such symptoms appear. The worms become active on *geng*-*xin* days, targeting the lungs during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Third Generation:** Refers to the patient’s awareness of the illness, compounded by sorrow, allowing the *qi* to grow and reach the original viscera. As the heart stirs, *qi* descends; sorrow pertains to the kidney meridian. The worms resemble ant or mosquito larvae, clotted blood fragments, turtles, cicada shells, or dragonflies. They cause the *sanjiao* to grow clouded, inducing constant drowsiness, vomiting of bitter fluid, clear water, or sticky phlegm. Sores appear in the mouth and nose, lips blacken, the face turns ashen, the spirit wanders, the voice grows hoarse and dry, oily sweat flows, and the eyes dim with excessive tears. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *gengyin* days, targeting the *jueyin* during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Fourth Generation:** Refers to the worms having ravaged the lungs and depleted the heart, shifting to the spleen. The worms resemble tangled silk, lung tissue, or snakes. They cause phlegm accumulations in the intestines, alternating chills and fever, abdominal distension with visible veins, a faint wheezing cough that cannot cease, belching, bitter taste, or cravings for unusual foods. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *wu*-*ji* days, targeting the spleen during drunken sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Fifth Generation:** Refers to the patient’s illness worsening with anger and advancing *qi*. The worms resemble mice, or small jars—unformed and without clear boundaries—some with heads but no feet, others with feet but no heads, or resembling fragments of seminal essence. The three worms enter the lung meridian and settle in the kidneys, transforming upon encountering blood. The condition becomes unbearable, leaving the patient utterly debilitated, limbs slack, and incapable of any exertion. Some retain a ruddy complexion as in health, while others gain foresight, speaking of future events. Such symptoms manifest. The worms become active on *guiwei* days, targeting the liver during sleep, affecting the four *shu* points.\n\n**Sixth Generation:** The worms may resemble horses with two tails, said to be male and female, or turtles, rotting silk, varying in length, or flying creatures with complete wings and feet, capable of transmitting *zhu* over a thousand *li*. *Zhu* refers to the so-called \"flying corpse.\" This is no ordinary affliction; the method must be applied with discernment.\n\n**Seals for Instruction:**\n- *Seal of the Master’s Personal Verification to Eliminate Corpse-Worms*\n- *Seal for Inquiring into Consumption*\n- *Seal Matching the Form*",

      "translated_text": "**Matching the Form**\n\nThe *Three Luminaries’ Fundamental Method* prescribes the structure for crafting talismans in *Matching the Form*. When preparing to administer a talisman to extract worms, first employ the *Talisman for Calming the Spirit and Securing Qi*, recite the *Incantation to Command the Essence-Soul*, and thereby stabilize the patient’s qi.\n\nThe incantation reads:\n*Three Corpses bring calamity,*\n*Nine Worms wreak havoc.*\n*They devour the five viscera,*\n*Flee to the bladder.*\n*Be they crimson or white,*\n*Azure or yellow,*\n*Swallow this talisman into the belly,*\n*Scour the stomach, purge the intestines.*\n*Uphold against the hundred ailments,*\n*Strengthen bones and joints.*\n*Triple Burner, Four Seas,*\n*Five viscera, six bowels—*\n*At the talisman’s arrival, gather and harvest,*\n*Dare they not perish?*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nNext, form the *Dipper Mudra* and recite the *Incantation of Heaven Round and Earth Square*, visualizing the *Six Ding Spirits*, *Three Generals*, *Twenty-Eight Constellations*, and *Eleven Luminaries* within the talisman brush. Then inscribe the talisman, envisioning flames issuing from the brush. Upon completion, deliver it to the patient to consume with peach broth.\n\nFirst, invoke:\n*Most High Lord Lao,*\n*Teach me to slay demons.*\n*Grant me divine formulas,*\n*Instruct me to save the world,*\n*Attach and extinguish disasters.*\n*Inscribe talismans to cure illness,*\n*Transmitting light across ten thousand li.*\n*Spirits and gods submit,*\n*Beings and people find peace.*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nThen recite:\n*Shatter their form,*\n*Recall the soul to the body,*\n*Seven po settle in tranquility.*\n*Guard the body, dispel illness,*\n*Forever preserve longevity.*\n*All spirits, awe-inspired,*\n*At this command, obey and act.*\n\n**Method for Discerning Treatable and Untreatable Cases**\nThe Master states: In cases of *corpse-transmission*, some are treatable, while others, where the disease has deeply advanced, the malevolent worms seize the true qi, the patient falls silent in self-seclusion, blood and qi are exhausted, are beyond remedy. To test this, take a bowl of water, silently draw in the patient’s *natal star qi*, recite the *Heavenly Peng Incantation*, and blow into the water, visualizing the natal star. Grasp the *Heavenly Peng Seal and Incantation*, point at the water, and envision yourself as the Heavenly Peng. Have the patient gaze into the water—if black qi appears, it is a demonic affliction. If they refuse to look or demand the water to inspect themselves, the case is untreatable.\n\nFurther verification lies in the brows’ markings, which foretell life or death. If the brow’s roots are dark or black, the eyes often gaze upward, and upon turning, black lines appear between the brows with qi like threads; if the brow’s corners bear azure qi, the brows are largely fallen, the brows are low while the brow’s roots are high, or hidden qi stirs restlessly between the brows, or the skin twitches intermittently—all such signs are untreatable.\n\nThis method is difficult to convey in writing or speech; it resides in the heart’s comprehension. Those who can pivot and adapt may grasp it through insight.\n\nTo identify worms when their color and qi remain unclear, employ the *Inquiry Talisman*. Craft the talisman according to the lunar phase, grinding cinnabar in alignment with the month’s stem, and inscribe it accordingly. Have the patient swallow it with frankincense broth. After the time it takes to eat a meal, have them hold frankincense up to the sun, shielding their eyes with their hands. If hair emerges from all ten fingertips, the disease is severe; if it appears from the middle fingers, the affliction runs deep. White hair indicates treatability, while yellow or red suggests difficulty. Absence of hair or sparse hair signifies no worms.\n\n**Sequence for Pursuing Worms**\nFor those in the initial stages of transmission, when pursuing worms, one must first submit a memorial to the Supreme Emperor, the City God of Mount Tai, the local earth deities, and the officers and soldiers of the community, as well as the spirits of the deceased, before proceeding. Masters who have ascended in rank and entered the hall may act at will without hesitation.\n\nFirst, have the patient swallow the *Three Luminaries Talisman* to weaken the malevolent qi. Then administer the talisman—none will fail to strike true. As evening approaches, have the patient consume the talisman and sit in their natal position (e.g., those born in the *zi* hour sit in the *zi* position), envisioning the Dipper’s light enveloping them. During the quiet of night, ensure lamps burn brightly before and behind, and prepare a wok of boiling oil. Do not allow the patient to leave, nor engage in conversation; only three to five people should keep watch. Soon, the patient may seem to dream of ghostly entities taking leave—ask their names. The worms may emerge from the patient’s body, clothing, or seat. Their forms vary; any creature with a discernible shape should be swiftly seized and cast into the boiling oil. Once fried, discard both the worms and the vessel into a flowing river, and depart without looking back.\n\n**Incantation to the Patient While Administering Talisman**\n*Nine Heavens’ Emperor,*\n*Four Numinous Ones, Eight Gates.*\n*Seven Governors, Two Mysteries,*\n*Three Primes, Nine Essences.*\n*Great Unity, Peach and Health,*\n*Ascend to the Three Clarities.*\n*Petition the Imperial Lord,*\n*Seize the Yellow Tranquility’s mandate.*\n*Swiftly summon the seven po,*\n*Subdue them in the divine court.*\n*Should any inauspiciousness remain,*\n*Seven Star Divine Soldiers.*\n*Call upon the true numina,*\n*Refine the turbid, temper the form.*\n*Great spirits, strike and expel,*\n*Sever and banish the malevolent essence.*\n*Three spirits harmonize in peace,*\n*Blood-corpses sink and scatter.*\n*Spirits return to the Crimson Abode,*\n*Turn toward propitious purity.*\n*Grant me immortality,*\n*Preserve my kalpic years.*\n*Hasten, hasten, as decreed by law!*\n\nNext, summon the *Three Corpses*: *Peng Shan*, *Peng Zhi*, and *Peng Jiao*, transforming them with the talisman into outer immortals.\n\nRecite again:\n*Platform Light,*\n*Hidden Essence,*\n*Luminous Spirit.*\n\nAnd again:\n*Corpse-Dogs crouch in excrement,*\n*Sparrow Shadows swallow thieves.*\n*Non-poison dispels filth,*\n*Fetid lungs, seven delusions.*\n*Open the gate of goodness,*\n*Seal the gate of evil.*\n*Ascend to the Immortal Capital,*\n*Together cultivate the seven virtues.*\n\n**Method for Hastening Birth and Resolving Childbirth Calamities**\nThe Master states: The mother receives the embryo through love and desire; the child takes form through karmic affinity. Without the mother, the child cannot be born; without the father, the mother cannot bestow life; without the child’s attachment to love and karma, it cannot acquire a body. Thus, causes and conditions give rise to karmic fruits and retributions.\n\nThe method for childbirth does not originate from the act of delivery. The child and mother unite qi to nurture form, and when the time comes to separate and be born, if the wind of past affections remains unsevered or the vitality of the destined birth is unknown, birth cannot occur.\n\nTherefore, if the child and mother come through affection, the child is born easily, grows swiftly, and becomes intelligent. They attain wealth and nobility without toil, bringing honor to their parents. But if the child and mother come through enmity, there may be calamities of transverse or breech birth, or even the sorrow of stillbirth.",

As the statutes decree!\"*\n\n**Talisman for Soothing Infant Fright**\nTake a segment of kindling wood, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper, and affix it to the door of the child’s chamber. Infuse with the *qi* of the Three Lights.\n\n---\n**Volume 24 of the *Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and Jade Hall Great Method* Concludes**\n**Volume 25 of the *Supreme Mystery of the Three Heavens and Jade Hall Great Method*: The Chapter on Preserving and Controlling the Kalpic Turns**\n\nThe Master said: The Great Dao generates the Prenatal; the Prenatal generates the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases divide into the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams divide into the Nine Palaces. All arise from the mutual generation and conquest of the Five Phases, through which form and *qi* are conceived and nurtured.\n\nThus, Heaven holds the yang above, and the Three Luminaries shine forth. Earth holds the yin below, and the Five Peaks stand in majesty. Humanity receives the numinous within, and the myriad transformations are complete—thereby establishing the Three Powers and setting the axis of the cosmos.\n\nYet where there is destiny, there is turn; where there is form, there is kalpa. Inevitably, the kalpa brings calamity, for the Five Phases never cease, and the cycles of generation and destruction, mutual conquest and harm, follow in their wake.\n\nHeaven’s body is pure and void, serene and without trace, enduring myriad kalpas without decay. Earth’s mass is heavy and turbid, ever subject to change. The stars’ benevolence or malevolence cannot escape their contrary courses. When water and fire clash, floods arise. When metal and wood contend, strife ensues. The wind-wheel sustains the earth; the water-*qi* floats the heavens. The Four Great Elements harmonize, and the Five Phases restrain one another. Should any deviate, omens of fortune or misfortune arise, causing Heaven to alter its form above, Earth to shift its form below, stars to entangle, floods and droughts to vie, and warfare to erupt in season.\n\nSuch are the destinies, such are the calamities. Therefore, our Great Peace Teaching spreads its teachings below. To preserve Heaven’s enduring existence, one must first preserve and control the kalpic turns. This chapter is established to weave the warp of Heaven and the weft of Earth, safeguarding the state and pacifying the household, delivering people from the disasters of the *yang*-nine, and ushering them into the era of Great Peace—how auspicious!\n\n**Method for Dispelling Comets and Invoking Blessings**\n\nThe Master said: This talisman is the pivotal essence of the Red Heaven’s star-subduing art. One must pace the repelling star *Ding*, visualize transforming into the Black Baleful True Lord, then proceed with the flying steps to sever and annihilate.\n\nBefore inscribing the talisman, recite the *Supreme Black Edict for Slaying Ghosts* and intone the talisman incantation:\n\n*Incantation:*\n*\"Om Hum Hum! All spirits bow their heads;\nDemons and deviants return to rectitude.\nShould any dare act perversely,\nLet them be reduced to dust.\nHasten! Upon receipt of this edict, act accordingly.\"*\n\n**Incantation for Pacing the *Ding***\n*\"I am the Great One True Lord of the Grotto,\nHead crowned with the Seven Stars, pacing the Four Wheels.\nGrasping the Dragon Sword, I stand in the *Xun* position,\nThen traverse *Li* until reaching *Kun*.\nAt *Zhen*, *Dui*, and *Gen*, I seal the boundaries—\nNo demonic vapors may lurk within.\nWith Yu’s steps and the *Kui Ding* facing *Qian* and *Hai*,\nI approach the Celestial Gate to pay homage to the Emperor.\nAgain, I ride the five-colored ascending clouds,\nMy true form wrathful, shaking the Gate of Heaven.\nEntering the Azure Palace, I fill with generative *qi*,\nThen mount the Azure Dragon into *Bing* and *Ding*.\nThe great radiance of the Red Heaven flames through the Three Realms;\nThe pure essence of baleful *qi* arrays its blades.\nReturning to the *Zhen* position in *Qian*,\nI tread the Seven Stars to extinguish the monstrous star.\nWith one celestial talisman, the baleful star retreats;\nWith one celestial halberd, Heaven and Earth are cleansed.\nReturning, I report my merit to the Sagely Lord.\nOm Ma!

All spirits bow their heads.\nHasten! Act accordingly!\"*\n\n**Method of Practice**\nThe Master said: When a comet or any baleful star appears as an omen, one should bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Stars* to beseech peace. Next, submit a petition to the Northern Culmen Great Emperor, entreating the suppression of the baleful star. Then, establish an altar and set up a ritual feast, lighting lamps for the Eleven Luminaries and the Northern and Southern Dippers. At dawn, present a memorial, and summon the Black Baleful Great Spirit—who is the Sagely One of the New Moon. The practice must be executed with utmost sincerity.\n\nAfter the morning audience, recite the *Jade Purity Scripture for Dispelling Disasters and Subduing Demons*. At noon, bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Stars*, visualizing its application in tandem with the *Prayer for Severing Pestilence*. After the audience, recite the *Scripture on Salvation*. At dusk, pace the *Ding*, visualizing the Variegated Sage patrolling the eight directions to execute the punitive method.\n\nFor dispelling, both sides remain unharmed, each secure in its place. For conquest, one side must face peril—for this is not the transformative benevolence of the Supreme. Those who inherit this teaching must comprehend this truth.\n\n**Method for Dispelling Fire Disasters**\n\nThe Master said: Among the Five Phases and Four Great Elements, water and fire are without sentiment. To control fire, first mobilize the virtue of water. Establish an altar and set up a ritual feast according to the prescribed form:\n\nAt dawn, pace the *Ding* of Water Virtue and issue the Water Star talisman command. Hang the banner of the Water Virtue Mysterious Standard. The Daoist assembly recites the *Supreme Yin Dark and Abysmal Incantation*.\n\nAt noon, display the *Mysterious Talisman for Suppressing Fire* and the *Talisman for Extinguishing the Might of the Fire Spirit*.\n\nAt dusk, bow and recite the *Prayer for Dispelling Fire*, then distribute and affix the talismans.\n\n**Water Star Command for Controlling Fire**\n\n**Supreme Yin Dark Incantation**\n*\"Supreme Yin, Dark and Abysmal,\nEssence of the singular *qi*.\nPure yin coalesces and transforms,\nThe radiance of yang extinguished in form.\nBlack *qi* fills the vast expanse;\nRed light returns to yin.\nWithin it dwells a spirit,\nBlack-bodied, in the Water Court.\nAble to extinguish the fire’s ugliness,\nThe Prenatal Lord.\nThe abyssal springs churn waves,\n*Jia Shen* manifests its brightness.\nRoaring and howling, vast and mighty,\nDragons shriek, sand spirits tremble.\nThe four seas surge in waves,\nThe *Tu Bo Yi Zhen* arise.\nHeavenly fire’s flames cease,\nThe Emperor commands the weary spirits.\nA thousand eyes scatter water;\nPoisoned lips unite in terror.\nHasten!

      "translated_text": "The Most High Lord Lao resides upon the ninefold heavens, amidst ten thousand layers of dense clouds, riding a qilin with a decree. He commands the Great Perfected King Qiao Ma Yi of the lower realm and the Dragon King to dispatch the lunar-attendant, solar-attendant, and hourly-attendant dragon officials to bring forth rain. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Later Sage Lord Lao.\n\nThis oral decree issues from the golden mouth of the Most High. When establishing the altar, position the Four Attendant Deities at the four corners:\n- **Southwest:** Fire Radiance Flowing Essence Lord\n- **Southeast:** Jade Thunder Luminous Master Lord\n- **Northwest:** Void Essence Great Hua Lord\n- **Northeast:** Cavern Yang Mysterious Spirit Lord\n\nThese four deities are the essence of Heavenly Unity and the ancestors of the dragon spirits.\n\n**Incantation:**\nProtect the Luminous Consort, Pure Flower Gold,\nCelestial Heroes, Dipper Stalwarts, Mysterious Spirits.\nThe Primordial Lady of Grand Unity commands the water troops,\nPenglai Envoys, Masters of the Water Court.\nWeak Waters gleam clear without the slightest turbidity,\nGoverning seas and rivers, overturning the Four Seas.\nThe Four Dark Deities, essence of Heavenly Unity,\nThe Great Yang conducts water through the Nine Trenches.\nWithin lies the Cavern Yang Mysterious Spirit,\nJade Thunder’s Luminous Master swiftly raises his voice.\nMighty rides the Great Hua Celestial Steed,\nFlowing Essence and Jade Radiance rush to the Fire Bell.\nBlack clouds billow as the sea’s *qi* ascends,\nPouring down upon the hundred rivers, rain like cords.\nA span of moisture swells to fullness,\nThe Rain Master and his retinue array the stellar ranks.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.\n\nAfter performing the three-period ritual upon the altar, sprinkle water. Cast the iron-plaque talisman and pace the *gang*.\n\n**Method for Dispersing Water to Pray for Clear Skies**\nThe master says: The method for praying for clear skies involves establishing an altar and setting up the offering as usual, but before the cavern table, position the Radiant Emperor of Solar Light and the Great Wind Earl. Proceed as in the rain-praying ritual, reciting the incantation for three days. At dawn, dispatch the talisman and command; at noon, hasten the clearing.\n\n**Solar Fire Transport Talisman**\nInscribe this talisman in vermilion on red paper and submit it with the preceding petition. Use this talisman as well.\n\n**Three-Period Ritual Oral Decree**\nThe Most High Lord Lao, by his golden mouth, decrees: Today, at such-and-such an hour, may heaven be clear and earth pristine, the sun and moon illuminate their paths. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees of the Later Sage Lord Lao.\n\n**Solar Fire Transport Incantation**\nAt midday, fire radiance, celestial yang essence,\nGreat brightness shines resplendent, golden light and fire glow.\nAt midday, Great Hua’s High Yang Brightness,\nDipper Stalwarts assist the Celestial Primordial Court.\nJade Splendor, Great Treasure, Primordial Guest,\nFierce beasts, celestial dragons, Mars the Sparkling Deluder.\nThe Primordial Lord of Grand Unity pacifies the Fire Radiance,\nThe Great Sage of Fire Radiance, Golden Youth Lord,\nThe Supreme Ultimate Great Emperor, Luminous Flowing Gold.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees.\n\n**Three-Five Pacing the Gang Method**\nThe master says: Pacing the *gang* is the method for strengthening the body and activating *qi*, the formula for stabilizing the hun and subduing the po.\n\nThe \"three\" in \"three-five\" refers in the Dao to the Three *Qi*, in heaven to the Three Heavens, in radiance to the Three Lights, in spirits to the Three Primes, and in humans to the Three Hun. The \"five\" refers in the Dao to the Five Elders, in heaven to the Five Phases, in celestial bodies to the Five Stars, and in humans to the Five Viscera.\n\nThe ancestral master says: The Three *Qi* are the essence of the Three Lights, and the Three Lights are the masters of spirit and essence. The Five Phases are the ancestors of the Five Stars, and the Five Phases are the thieves that harm the body. Thus, if the practitioner can cultivate and ascend to perfection, they cause the Three Lights to return to the Three *Qi* and the Five Phases to return to the Five Powers. The Three Hun become the Three Lights, the Five Viscera become the Five *Qi*, the Five *Qi* return to the Three *Qi*, and the Three *Qi* merge into the One *Qi*, naturally attaining perfection. Hence, it is said: Humans thereby attain longevity. Those who cannot cultivate cause the Three Lights to become the Three Corpses, the Three Corpses to become the Three Paths; the Five *Qi* become the Five Phases, and the Five Phases become the Five Sufferings. These are the Eight Difficulties for humans—this is the meaning of \"three-five.\"\n\n*Gang* means \"guiding principle.\" Arranging the Dipper to pace is to pull the guiding principle and operate the mechanism, hence the name *gang*. It is also said: *Gang* is yang. The natural yang within pacing subdues yin demons, so the Dipper’s stars ride their light upon the Great Crimson Heaven, hence the name *gang*.\n\nThe Celestial Master of old said: The Northern Dipper is the Central Dipper. The Central Dipper’s nine stars transform into the Nine Spirit Pacings—this is called the Stellar *Gang*. Thus, one symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate, two symbolize heaven and earth, three symbolize the Three Lights, four symbolize the Four Seasons, five symbolize the Five Phases, six symbolize the Six Pitch Pipes, seven symbolize the Seven Stars, eight symbolize the Eight Trigrams, and nine symbolize the Nine Spirits.\n\nHowever, the Nine Spirits’ transmission has long been interrupted, and its formula lost. Thus, I now establish the diagram, taking the Nine Spirit Ancestral *Gang* as its head. This *gang* is the ancestor of pacing methods, the origin of Yu’s pacing, and by pacing it repeatedly, there is nothing it cannot accomplish. The so-called \"Huoluo Dipper\" of recent times traces its source to this.\n\nThe pacing method need not be overly complex; if the heart comprehends the Nine Stars, the feet tread the Nine Spirits, and the body embodies the Nine *Qi*, one will naturally attain mastery. Thus, the methods transmitted in the present age are mostly erroneous, and I now specially simplify and demonstrate the wondrous essence of non-complexity.\n\n**Prostrating to Submit Petitions and Breaking the Gang Pacing the Void Method**\n**Transcending the Three Realms Pacing the Void Gang Method**",

      "translated_text": "**The Daoist Gang of the Celestial Immortal Generals**\n**The Gang for Audience with Heaven and Memorial Submission**\n**The Gang for Subduing Demons and Quelling Spirits**\n**The Three Terraces Gang**\n\nThe above *gang* methods are all ancestral to the various arts. They involve pacing but no incantations; one holds the intention without clinging to the form. In the teachings of the Great Peace, the *Yu’s Pacing* was transmitted anew, becoming the *Gang for Regulating the Five Phases, Cultivating the Body, and Subduing Demons*.\n\n**The Twenty-Fifth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method’s Essential Principles Concludes**\n**The Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the Supreme Mystery-Origin Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: Invoking the True and Delivering from Calamity**\n\nThe Master said:\nTo *invoke the true* is to perform the *Dipper Memorial Rite*. The Dipper governs the throat and tongue of Heaven; all matters of human fortune and misfortune, prosperity and adversity, longevity and premature death, are determined by it. Thus, when Heaven sends down reprimands, when ghosts below lodge false accusations, when ancestral spirits summon litigation, or when the deceased implicate the living—any of these occurrences bring misfortune in their wake. The severity of the affliction corresponds to the gravity of the offense. Without practicing the urgent memorial method to effect resonance, even if one were to amass incense into mountains or burn offerings for generations, one could not achieve communion or response.\n\nThus, the adage states: *One’s nature is like fire; the method is like sulfur—touch them, and they ignite.* The same principle applies here. Though Dipper rites are numerous, the initial steps for beginners are not easily distinguished. With minds cluttered and intentions scattered, how can one attain clarity? Therefore, I now specially present the *Urgent Memorial Secret Petition* within this chapter. Perform it with sincerity, and the true will respond to Heaven.\n\nIn all matters of invoking the Dipper and beseeching the true, authority lies with the *Two Envoys of the Striking Bell*. These two deities are solely responsible for inspecting the purity of the ritual altar. If one is not devout, these spirits will report it, and the celestial perfected will not descend. They also oversee human fortune and misfortune, life and death, and are especially attended by the *Nine August Ladies, Inner Consorts, and Jade Maidens* who present the memorials. If these deities do not descend, the petitions will not reach their destination, and all ritual preparations will be in vain. Furthermore, the transmission of the memorial to the *Mysterious Bureau* to request the descent of gracious decrees is the purview of the *Four Direct Envoys, Nine August Celestial Officers, Embroidered-Robed Envoys, and Messengers of Communication*. If they do not descend, the true sincerity will not be conveyed; if the *Lifting Bell* does not descend, the Celestial Perfected will remain unaware, and all offerings of incense and flowers will be wasted, unable to elicit a response.\n\nMoreover, if the practitioner has violated taboos of impurity, consumed meat or pungent foods, harbored impure thoughts, or maintained an unclean body, even if the true scribes are summoned, they will not descend. The *Four Bureaus* will record the transgressions, and the resulting offenses will be immeasurable. Be cautious.\n\nWhen invoking the Dipper, one must not approach slaughterhouses, taverns, rowdy markets, or licentious chambers. The best locations are empty halls, grand temples, or official Daoist abbeys. Avoid disturbances and keep away from wailing. If monks, nuns, coffins, chickens, dogs, cats, or individuals in mourning attire (wearing white cloth) enter the altar space, the deities will neither descend nor respond.\n\nWhen the practitioner enters the state of *storing and circulating*, if one does not *summon the qi*, the true will not respond; if one does not *ingest the talisman*, the body will not become numinous; if one does not *concentrate on the deities*, the true will not descend. One must achieve the union of *qi* and spirit, the resonance of inner sincerity, so that the response is swift and luminous, as if engaging in conversation.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, there was a Minister of Waterworks named Zhang Shuo, who resided by the Xiao River. His nine-year-old son was unable to speak. Later, he prayed at the shrine of Zhang, the Waterworks Minister (who was also Zhang, the Judge of the Underworld), and offered sacrifices to the deity of Bian Mountain. Suddenly, the deity descended and spoke: *\"When your son was born, he offended the Dipper Bureau. You must urgently memorialize it.\"* The deity had once served the Dipper and possessed a secret method, which was extremely simple. He transmitted it to Zhang Shuo, who later rose to the position of Prime Minister. This secret method was buried atop the great peak of Juqu. Now that the Great Teaching is flourishing, this method has been revealed to the world. Practitioners should keep it confidential.\n\nTo first memorialize the Dipper, prepare four clean mats, seven plates woven from artemisia flowers (each the size of a small dish), seven cups of pure tea, seven bowls of jujube broth, seven oil cakes, seven offerings of fruit, seven incense burners, and seven lamps. Face north and make the offerings. The practitioner should advance on their knees, bowing seven times to each star, and secretly pray for the matter at hand. Submit the urgent memorial petition and burn it in the incense burner with a blazing fire.\n\nNext, the practitioner enters the chamber, visualizes, and bows nine times. Imagine the five viscera emitting five-colored *qi*, forming a golden bridge that connects to the celestial realm. Envision the seven palaces of the Dipper Bureau as jade halls with golden towers. After a long while, see the *Embroidered-Robed Envoy* leading you across the bridge. Gradually, you will perceive a path of purple clouds, where the *Nine August Officials* in vermilion robes with square collars and nine-tiered crowns guide you to ascend and enter the palace of your natal star to present your petition. You will see only golden light, too radiant to gaze upon directly. Once the petition is presented, if you see a red light, it signifies that your request has been granted. Return by the same path and enter the *Mysterious Gate*. After a long while, swallow your saliva, click your teeth, and withdraw.\n\n**Burning the Altar Talisman**\nBurn the talisman and recite the incantation, visualizing the first layer of the jade platform rising from the earth.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Clear and numinous, true qi sweeps away the miasma.*\n*Empty mystery’s true image: the first layer of the jade platform.*\n*Divine qi descends in response; we bow to the exalted ones.*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*The Great Void is without form; the cloud paths are clear and level.*\n*The second layer of the jade altar forms as the heart desires.*\n*Demonic miasma is stilled; the human realm is at peace.*\n\n**Incantation:**\n*As the true light descends, the third layer of the jade platform appears.*\n*The empty mystery takes form: the gate of all wonders.*\n*Invite the immortals—they arrive; summon the sages—they attend.*\n*Sincerity moves the heart; the Dipper’s numen descends.*\n\nBurn the three flying talismans, visualizing the three-tiered jade altar rising, purple clouds ascending, and golden light in the void connecting to the Dipper’s extremity.\n\n**Next, burn the Demon-Quelling Talisman**\nWrite it in vermilion and send it flying. Recite the *Great Slaying Text*, sprinkle water to the four directions, and recite the incantation.\n\n**Incantation:**\n*Supreme purity of the Dao, dispatching the celestial soldiers.*\n*Driving dragons and riding tigers, casting fire and ringing bells.*\n*Cloud paths are swept clean; demonic hordes are revealed.*\n*True fire strikes first; halberds and polearms punish behind.*\n*Dare any disobey? Sever their heads and annihilate their forms.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Ascent and Descent of the Two Luminaries**\n\n**The Master says:**\nThe Jade Hall takes the *High Ascent to the Sun and Moon* as its ancestral method. By extension, it may be applied to others to cure illness and expel evil. Cultivated within oneself, it enables communion with the perfected and attainment of immortality. Yet the *High Ascent* is not easily practiced; one must first advance through the ranks to receive and preserve it.\n\nAscent signifies the meaning of *ascent* [to the luminaries], while descent signifies its application to others and to oneself. Heaven and earth mark day and night by the sun and moon, and all transformations of yin and yang, cold and heat, arise from them. Thus, nothing moves heaven and earth or stirs ghosts and spirits more than these.\n\n**Method for Ingesting Sun and Moon Light on Dawn and Full Moon Days**\nAt sunrise on the first day of the lunar month, the adept sits facing east, visualizing the sunlight nine feet before them. The sun has nine rays, and within them, five-colored luminous *qi* descends into the adept’s mouth, entering the five viscera, radiant as a crimson sun. Recite the incantation:\n> *Oṃ va-dri-ra guṇa-sūri svāhā.*\n> Five Emperors of the Sun, true *qi* descend swiftly.\n> Pierce my abdomen, enter my viscera, *qi* surging, *qi* strengthening.\n\nThen inhale the *qi* nine times, swallowing nine times, until warmth is felt within the abdomen. Perform this thrice. After a year of practice, the *qi* will be robust and the spirit vigorous; when deploying talismans or consecrated water, responses will arise naturally.\n\nAt moonrise on the full moon, the adept sits facing east, visualizing the moonlight nine feet before them. The moon has ten rays, and within them, five-colored luminous *qi* descends into the adept’s mouth, entering the five viscera, luminous as the full moon. Recite the incantation:\n> *Oṃ va-candra ra □-ra svāhā.*\n> August Sovereign of the Moon, Five Perfected Ladies,\n> True *qi* descends, piercing my body’s court.\n> Preserve my immortal life, ten thousand years unshaken.\n\nThen inhale the *qi* nine times, swallowing nine times, until warmth is felt within the abdomen. Perform this thrice. After a year of practice, the *qi* will be pure and the body numinous; when treating illness or subduing malevolent spirits, responses will arise naturally.\n\n**External Ascent to the Two Luminaries**\nOn a quiet night, the adept enters a chamber and sits in stillness, banishing thoughts and emptying the mind. They visualize crimson *qi* emerging from their heart, coalescing into a cloud chariot. Their body ascends the chariot, rising gently to the Solar Palace, where they behold the Solar Emperor bestowing the *Talisman of the Sun’s Nurturing Perfection*. After ingesting it, they descend with the Emperor into the *Niwan* [palace], lingering until form is forgotten. They then knock their teeth, swallow saliva, and withdraw.\n\nAfter completing the ascent to the sun, the adept again visualizes white *qi* emerging from their kidneys, ascending from the crown to form a cloud chariot. Their body ascends the chariot, rising gently to the Lunar Palace, where they behold the August Lady of the Moon bestowing the *Talisman of the Moon’s Nurturing Perfection*. After ingesting it, they descend with the Lady into the *Niwan*, lingering until form is forgotten. They then knock their teeth, swallow saliva, and withdraw.\n\nThis Way of the Two Luminaries should be practiced daily in moments of leisure, diligently and consistently.

      "translated_text": "The Master said: Those born in the *xia-yuan* *jia-zi* year are of meager fortune and scant virtue; blessings shun them, yet malevolent spirits, demons, and baleful influences readily assail them. Thus misfortune befalls their households, or they themselves encounter grotesqueries and suffer untimely or unjust deaths. Therefore, the Most High revealed the *Decree of Expulsion* and established the *Methods of Restraint and Subduing*, that demons might not trespass, and humankind ascend to longevity and well-being—how splendid indeed!\n\nYet once these teachings emerged and spread through the ages, hearsay and misinterpretation obscured the true and gave rise to the false, fracturing the orthodox methods. Thus, their application lost efficacy, and expelling demons yielded no response. Fragments of texts and broken talismans left the profound and wondrous untransmitted, a failing of those who uphold and transmit the methods.\n\nThis foundational stage, then, is not meant to establish distinctions among talismans or degrees of transmission. Worldly folk, fickle in their pursuits, begin but do not persist, treating sacred texts with levity, as mere child’s play. Thus, this initial stage is set to gauge the aspirant’s capacity for the Dao. If one proves steadfast in purpose, the transmission of the orthodox lineage and the continuation of the great teaching truly commence here—how could one not proceed with utmost care?\n\nThe Master said: This foundational stage of *Methods for Expelling, Restraining, and Subduing* does not imply concealment or omission. These methods, transmitted by the Master’s decree, are the simplest to practice and the most readily efficacious. Yet one must reflect: such encounters are not easily come by, and their execution is no small feat. Among these secrets are those unrecorded in the canonical texts; here they are first recorded to instruct the novice—take heed.\n\nThe Master said: Ghostly *qi* prevails in the lands south of the Yangtze, most densely in the Hundred Yue regions, where customs revere spirits and believe in perverse forces. Thus, people invite chaos, attracting malevolent influences to assail and afflict them. The benighted, unaware of their own harm, instead place their faith in these forces, and those poisoned by them grovel in servitude, blind to their plight. Such is the unchecked rampancy of ghostly *qi*, rising to offend the celestial *qi* of the clouds and heavens, its foul vapors violating heaven and earth. The Perfected Ones grow wrathful and no longer descend, while demons rejoice in their unchallenged dominance. Thus, in the world, private altars and temples—whether in monasteries or shrines—abound with false spirits masquerading as gods. Without the great methods to uphold the true teaching, how can these malevolent forces be easily eradicated?\n\nThe Master’s instruction for the initial signs of this stage states: In treating afflictions, when confronting great afflictions, one must pity the lesser. What are the great afflictions? They are the factions of spirit temples, the entities clinging to mountains and forests, the usurpers of monastic altars—these are the great afflictions. Their roots extend a thousand *li*, their lairs connect to the four directions, harming the innocent and ensnaring the dead into their ranks. Over time, their strong spirits and wayward souls occupy every place, demanding blood sacrifices and spreading poison to harm the people, ceaselessly. Thus, to treat one affliction is to provoke the multitude. If the multitude, thwarted in their demands, face execution, the response echoes from the four directions and a thousand *li*, rallying their followers and depleting their ranks to battle the true method. If the novice harbors even a trace of hesitation, the demonic horde seizes the advantage, the true method fails, and the people suffer—how lamentable!\n\nThe so-called lesser afflictions are but wandering souls; one should pity their lingering state and enable their deliverance. To treat lesser afflictions with ease while struggling against the great is to lose sight of the Most High’s original intent in establishing these methods.\n\n**Talisman for Subduing the Factions of Great Afflictions**\n*Jade Clarity Highest Emperor, Supreme Clarity Great Emperor, Grand Clarity Great Emperor, Jade Sovereign Emperor, Supreme Limit of the Great Lofty Jade Clarity, Upper Prime General, Middle Prime General, Lower Prime General—seize, bind, and execute all wayward ghosts and spirits. Upper Terrace of Void Essence, Middle Terrace of Sixfold Purity, Lower Terrace of Crooked Life—wherever you arrive, bestow mighty numen. Eight Execution Generals, Four Execution Spirit Lords, Execution Ghosts, Celestial Soldiers—execute all wayward and malevolent ghosts and spirits. Open the Gate of Heaven, Close the Door of Earth, Bar the Human Gate, Block the Ghostly Path. Left Celestial Stem, Right River Demon—execute demonic ghosts, thunderous roars.

The novice receives this talisman from the Northern Emperor, swallows it, and firelight bursts forth in all directions, thunder resounds. Then, open your eyes and inscribe the talisman on a full sheet of yellow paper with ground cinnabar, facing north. This talisman bears the Emperor’s ultimate punishment; when affixed to the household courtyard, ghosts and spirits within the four directions are expelled nine *li* beyond. If burned at a haunted site, the celestial generals will manifest their might, sweeping and purging an area thirty *li* in all directions to stillness.

Visualize the Primordial Beginning’s Celestial Venerable within, then employ the third talisman.\n*Incantation:*\nThe qi of the Great Beginning,\nSpontaneous and non-actional.\nThe Void Origin bears an image,\nSuspended in the empty mystery.\nEncompassing the ten thousand beings,\nNurturing and transforming immortals and gods.\nSeen yet unseen,\nHeard yet untransmitted.\nBefore and after indistinguishable,\nMystery within mystery.\nMay the numinous creation open,\nThat I may personally worship the Mysterious Origin.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Audience with the Origin’s Natural Secret Talisman**\nExecute the Jade Clarity mudra, visualize the curtain’s front as a true pearl’s mouth, drawing the Dao’s hosts and transforming multitudes of perfected beings to enter. After a long while, see only a golden-hued world, nothing else.\n*Incantation:*\nThe jeweled curtain is drawn,\nThe jade countenance’s light returns.\nEnter the treasure pearl,\nListen to the Dharma’s lingering.\nThe spirit’s mind is serene and clear,\nFortune and wisdom both arrive.\nPreserve my flying immortal,\nAscending to the Jade Terrace.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the true statutes and ordinances!*\n\n**Secret Method for Harmonious Summoning with Bell and Chime**\nThe Master says: The bell sounds yang; the chime, yin. When the altar’s steps are complete, strike the golden bell and jade chime to summon harmony. Not only to summon harmony, but to gather yin spirits and yang numina, intermingling their qi. Thus, the golden bell is struck twenty-five times, modeling heaven—heaven’s number is twenty-five. The jade chime is struck thirty times, modeling earth—earth’s number is thirty. Moreover, as yin and yang desire their union, the bell and chime are struck alternately thirty-six times, one yin and one yang totaling seventy-two, to connect with the seventy-two seasonal nodes. Yet when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises. Thus, decline and renewal alternate, adversity and prosperity succeed one another. Yin cannot be wholly yin, so it returns to its yang sound, and the jade chime is struck nine times. Nine is the Qian number, yang. Yang cannot be wholly yang, so it returns to its yin sound, and the golden bell is struck six times. Six is the Kun number, yin.\n\n**Jade Talisman for Summoning Yin Spirits**\n*Incantation:*\nThe Primordial Beginning’s singular qi,\nSilently moves the primordial essence.\nHarmonizing tones and tuning rhythms,\nStirring the turbid and raising the pure.\nThe wondrous qi of the secluded and distant,\nThe wondrous qi’s initial congealment.\nCoiling through the empty cavern,\nThe sound within heaven.\nGathering essence and descending qi,\nIssuing forth the true voice.\nYin sounds interweave,\nSummoning the ten thousand numina.\n\n**Jade Talisman for Summoning Yang Spirits**\nStrike the golden bell once, tap the left teeth once. Strike the jade chime once, tap the right teeth once. Visualize the two qi of left and right within the body intermingling, filling the mysterious altar.\n*Incantation:*\nStillness gives birth to movement,\nReturning yin generates yang.\nThe Great Tone enters the wondrous,\nWandering the empty valley.\nSound responds to qi’s seeking,\nIntermingling in gong and shang.\nSound upon sound resonates,\nTransforming and circulating the mysterious altar.\nThe sound that arouses yang,\nUnites with heaven’s firmness.\nYang spirits intermingle,\nTrue qi blends in harmony.\n\n**Nine Audiences in Three Days**\nThe *Scripture of Pacing the Void* states: Lofty immortals and great sages ascend the Jade Capital Mountain thrice daily to offer pure fasts, practice the Dao, and soar through the empty void. Thus, the rites of audience with the perfected in the lower realm must emulate this. One gives birth to two, two gives birth to three—hence, one day has three audiences. Three begets nine—hence, three days have nine audiences. In practice, for the morning audience, visualize the yang spirit of the upper cinnabar field paying homage to the Origin’s Venerable in the Mud Pill Palace.",
